'''Abhinavagupta''' (c. 950 – 1016 AD&lt;ref&gt;Triadic Heart of Shiva, Paul E. Muller-Ortega, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 27&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Indian philosophy|philosopher]], [[Mysticism|mystic]] and [[Aesthetics|aesthetician]] from [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Abhinavagupta – the Philosopher |url=http://www.koausa.org/Glimpses/abhinava.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also considered an influential [[Music of India|musician]], [[Indian poetry|poet]], [[Theatre in India|dramatist]], [[exegesis|exegete]], theologian, and [[Indian logic|logician]]&lt;ref name="Re-accessing Abhinavagupta page 4"&gt;Re-accessing Abhinavagupta, Navjivan Rastogi, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Key to the Vedas, Nathalia Mikhailova, page 169&lt;/ref&gt; – a [[polymath]]ic personality who exercised strong influences on [[Indian culture]].&lt;ref&gt;The Pratyabhijñā Philosophy, Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Companion to Tantra, S.C. Banerji, page 89&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Kashmir]]&lt;ref&gt;Doctrine of Divine Recognition, K. C. Pandey, page V&lt;/ref&gt; in a family of scholars and mystics and studied all the schools of philosophy and art of his time under the guidance of as many as fifteen (or more) teachers and [[guru]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 35&lt;/ref&gt; In his long life he completed over 35 works, the largest and most famous of which is ''[[Tantraloka|Tantrāloka]]'', an encyclopaedic treatise on all the philosophical and practical aspects of [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kaula]] and [[Trika]] (known today as [[Kashmir Shaivism]]). Another one of his very important contributions was in the field of philosophy of aesthetics with his famous ''[[Abhinavabharati|Abhinavabhāratī]]'' commentary of ''[[Natya Shastra|Nāṭyaśāstra]]'' of [[Bharata Muni]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Luce dei Tantra, Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta, Raniero Gnoli, page LXXVII&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
"Abhinavagupta" was not his real name, rather a title he earned from his master, carrying a meaning of "competence and authoritativeness".&lt;ref name="Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi page 20"&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir; Navjivan Rastogi, page 157&lt;/ref&gt; In his analysis, Jayaratha (1150–1200 AD)&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 92&lt;/ref&gt; – who was Abhinavagupta's most important commentator – also reveals three more meanings: "being ever vigilant", "being present everywhere" and "protected by praises".&lt;ref name="The Kula Ritual page 4"&gt;The Kula Ritual, As Elaborated in Chapter 29 of the Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta; John R. Dupuche, page 4&lt;/ref&gt; Raniero Gnoli, the only [[Sanskrit]] scholar who completed a translation of [[Tantraloka|Tantrāloka]] in a European language, mentions that "Abhinava" also means "new",&lt;ref&gt;Luce dei Tantra, Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta, Raniero Gnoli, 1999, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; as a reference to the ever-new creative force of his mystical experience.

From Jayaratha, we learn that Abhinavagupta was in possession of all the six qualities required for the recipients of the tremendous level of [[Shaktipat|śaktipāta]], as described in the sacred texts (Śrīpūrvaśāstra):&lt;ref name="Abhinavagupta, Ganesh Tryambak Deshpande page 19"&gt;Abhinavagupta, Ganesh Tryambak Deshpande, page 19&lt;/ref&gt; an unflinching faith in God, realisation of [[mantra]]s, control over objective principles (referring to [[the 36 tattvas]]), successful conclusion of all the activities undertaken, poetic creativity and spontaneous knowledge of all disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Abhinavagupta's creation is well equilibrated between the branches of the triad ([[Trika]]): will (''icchā''), knowledge (''[[Jnana|jñāna]]''), action (''[[Kriya|kriyā]]''); his works also include devotional songs, academical/philosophical works&lt;ref name="Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi page 20" /&gt; and works describing ritual/yogic practices.&lt;ref&gt;Re-accessing Abhinavagupta, Navjivan Rastogi, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

As an author, he is considered a systematiser of the philosophical thought. He reconstructed, rationalised and orchestrated the philosophical knowledge into a more coherent form,&lt;ref&gt;Re-accessing Abhinavagupta, Navjivan Rastogi, page 10&lt;/ref&gt; assessing all the available sources of his time, not unlike a modern scientific researcher of [[Indology]].

Various contemporary scholars have characterised Abhinavagupta as a "brilliant scholar and saint",&lt;ref name="Utpaladeva page XXXIII"&gt;Īśvara Pratyabhijñā Kārikā of Utpaladeva, Verses on the Recognition of the Lord; B. N. Pandit, page XXXIII&lt;/ref&gt; "the pinnacle of the development of Kasmir Śaivism"&lt;ref name="Utpaladeva page XXXIII" /&gt; and "in possession of yogic realization".&lt;ref name="Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi page 20" /&gt;

==Social background, family and disciples==

==="Magical" birth===
The term by which Abhinavagupta himself defines his origin is "yoginībhū", 'born of a [[Yogini|yoginī]]'.&lt;ref name="Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi page 20" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luce dei Tantra, Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta, Raniero Gnoli, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; In Kashmir Shaivism and especially in Kaula it is considered that a progeny of parents "established in the divine essence of [[Bhairava]]",&lt;ref&gt;Re-accessing Abhinavagupta, Navjivan Rastogi, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; is endowed with exceptional spiritual and intellectual prowess. Such a child is supposed to be "the depository of knowledge", who "even as a child in the womb, has the form of [[Shiva]]",&lt;ref name="The Kula Ritual page 4" /&gt; to enumerate but a few of the classical attributes of his kind.

===Parents===
His mother, ''Vimalā'' (''Vimalakalā'') died when Abhinavagupta was just two years old;&lt;ref name="Tantra, Tantrāloka page 4"&gt;Luce dei Tantra, Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta, Raniero Gnoli, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 31&lt;/ref&gt; as a consequence of losing his mother, of whom he was reportedly very attached,&lt;ref name="Abhinavagupta, Ganesh Tryambak Deshpande page 19" /&gt; he grew more distant from worldly life and focused all the more on spiritual endeavour.

The father, ''Narasiṃha Gupta'', after his wife's death favoured an ascetic lifestyle, while raising his three children. He had a cultivated mind and a heart "outstandingly adorned with devotion to Mahesvara (Shiva)"&lt;ref name="Tantra, Tantrāloka page 4" /&gt; (in Abhinavagupta's own words). He was Abhinavagupta's first teacher, instructing him in [[Sanskrit grammar|grammar]], [[Indian logic|logic]] and [[Sanskrit literature|literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===

Abhinavagupta had a brother and a sister. The brother, ''Manoratha'', was a well-versed devotee of Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 22&lt;/ref&gt; His sister, ''Ambā'' (probable name, according to Navjivan Rastogi), devoted herself to worship after the death of her husband in late life.

His cousin ''Karṇa'' demonstrated even from his youth that he grasped the essence of Śaivism and was detached of the world. His wife was presumably Abhinavagupta's older sister ''Ambā'',&lt;ref name="Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi page 24"&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 24&lt;/ref&gt; who looked with reverence upon her illustrious brother. ''Ambā'' and ''Karṇa'' had a son, ''Yogeśvaridatta'', who was precociously talented in yoga&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 23&lt;/ref&gt; (''yogeśvar'' implies "lord of yoga").

Abhinavagupta also mentions his disciple ''Rāmadeva'' as faithfully devoted to scriptural study and serving his master.&lt;ref name="Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi page 24" /&gt; Another cousin was ''Kṣema'', possibly the same as Abhinavagupta's illustrious disciple ''Kṣemarāja''. ''Mandra'', a childhood friend of ''Karṇa'', was their host in a suburban residence; he was not only rich and in possession of a pleasing personality, but also equally learned.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 25&lt;/ref&gt; And last but not least, ''Vatasikā'', ''Mandra'''s aunt, who got a special mention from Abhinavagupta for caring for him with exceptional dedication and concern; to express his gratitude, Abhinavagupta declared that ''Vatasikā'' deserved the credit for the successful completion of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The emerging picture here is that Abhinavagupta lived in a nurturing and protected environment, where his creative energies got all the support they required. Everyone around him was filled with spiritual fervor and had taken Abhinavagupta as their spiritual master. Such a supporting group of family and friends was equally necessary as his personal qualities of genius, to complete a work of the magnitude of [[Tantraloka|Tantrāloka]].

===Ancestors===
By Abhinavagupta's own account, his most remote known ancestor was called ''Atrigupta'', born in ''Madhyadeśa'': [Manusmirti (circa 1500 BC, 2/21) defines the Madhyadesh region as vast plains between Himalaya and Vindhya mountains and to the east of the river Vinasana (invisible Saraswati) and to the west of Praya]. Born in Madhyadeśa he travelled to [[Kashmir]] at the request of the king [[Lalitaditya Muktapida|Lalitāditya]],&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Kula Ritual, As Elaborated in Chapter 29 of the Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta; John R. Dupuche, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; around year 740 CE .&lt;ref name="Triadic Mysticism page 12"&gt;Triadic Mysticism, Paul E. Murphy, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Masters==
Abhinavagupta is famous for his voracious thirst for knowledge. To study he took many teachers (as many as 15),&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 33&lt;/ref&gt; both mystical philosophers and scholars. He approached [[Vaishnavism|Vaiṣṇavas]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], [[Shaiva Siddhanta|Śiddhānta Śaivists]] and the [[Trika]] scholars.

Among the most prominent of his teachers, he enumerates four. ''Vāmanātha'' who instructed him in dualistic ''Śaivism''&lt;ref name="Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi page 54"&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 54&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Bhūtirāja'' in the dualist/nondualist school. Besides being the teacher of the famous Abhinavagupta, ''Bhūtirāja'' was also the father of two eminent scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lakṣmaṇagupta'', a direct disciple of [[Utpaladeva]], in the lineage of ''Trayambaka'', was highly respected by Abhinavagupta and taught him all the schools of monistic thought : ''Krama'', [[Trika]] and ''Pratyabhijña'' (except [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kula]]).&lt;ref name="Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi page 54" /&gt;

''Śambhunātha'' taught him the fourth school (''Ardha-trayambaka''). This school is in fact Kaula, and it was emanated from ''Trayambaka'''s daughter.

For Abhinavagupta, ''Śambhunātha'' was the most admired guru. Describing the greatness of his master, he compared ''Śambhunātha'' with the Sun, in his power to dispel ignorance from the heart, and, in another place, with "the Moon shining over the ocean of ''Trika'' knowledge".&lt;ref name="The Kula Ritual page 7"&gt;The Kula Ritual, As Elaborated in Chapter 29 of the Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta; John R. Dupuche, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Abhinavagupta received Kaula initiation through ''Śambhunātha''s wife (acting as a ''dūtī'' or [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]]). The energy of this initiation is transmitted and sublimated into the heart and finally into consciousness. Such a method is difficult but very rapid and is reserved for those who shed their mental limitations and are pure.

It was ''Śambhunātha'' who requested of him to write [[Tantraloka|Tantrāloka]]. As guru, he had a profound influence in the structure of [[Tantraloka|Tantrāloka]]&lt;ref&gt;The Triadic Heart of Śiva, Kaula Tantricism of Abhinavagupta in the Non-Dual Shaivism of Kashmir; Paul Eduardo Muller-Ortega, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; and in the life of its creator, Abhinavagupta.&lt;ref name="Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi page 44-54"&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 44-54&lt;/ref&gt;

As many as twelve more of his principal teachers are enumerated by name but without details.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 35,54&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that Abhinavagupta had more secondary teachers. Moreover, during his life he had accumulated a large number of texts from which he quoted in his magnum opus, in his desire to create a synthetic, all inclusive system, where the contrasts of different scriptures could be resolved by integration into a superior perspective.

==Lifestyle==
Abhinavagupta remained unmarried all his life,&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 32&lt;/ref&gt; and as an adept of [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kaula]], at least initially maintained ''[[brahmacharya]]'' and supposedly used the vital force of his energy (''ojas'') to deepen his understanding of the spiritual nervous system he outlined in his works -- a system involving ritual union between Purusha as (Shiva) and Shakti. Such union is essentially non-physical and universal, and thus Abhinavagupta conceived himself as always in communion with Shiva-Shakti. In the context of his life and teachings, Abhinavagupta parallels Shiva as both ascetic and enjoyer.

He studied assiduously at least until the age of 30 or 35,&lt;ref name="Triadic Mysticism page 12" /&gt;. To accomplish that he travelled, mostly inside Kashmir.&lt;ref&gt;The Kula Ritual, as Elaborated in Chapter 29 of the Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta; John R. Dupuche, page 6&lt;/ref&gt; By his own testimony, he had attained spiritual liberation through his ''Kaula'' practice, under the guidance of his most admired master, ''Śambhunātha''.&lt;ref name="Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi page 44-54" /&gt;

He lived in his home (functioning as an [[ashram]]) with his family members and disciples,&lt;ref&gt;Īśvara Pratyabhijñā Kārikā of Utpaladeva, Verses on the Recognition of the Lord; B. N. Pandit, page XXXIV&lt;/ref&gt; and he did not become a wandering monk, nor did he take on the regular duties of his family, but lived out his life as a writer and a teacher.&lt;ref name="The Kula Ritual page 7" /&gt; His personality was described as a living realisation of his vision.&lt;ref name="Re-accessing Abhinavagupta page 4" /&gt;

In an epoch pen-painting he is depicted seated in ''Virasana'', surrounded by devoted disciples and family, performing a kind of trance-inducing music at [[veena]] while dictating verses of [[Tantrāloka]] to one of his attendees – behind him two ''dūtī'' (women [[yogi]]) waiting on him. A legend about the moment of his death (placed somewhere between 1015 and 1025, depending on the source), says that he took with him 1,200 disciples and marched off to a cave (the [[Bhairava]] Cave, an actual place known to this day), reciting his poem ''Bhairava-stava'', a devotional work. They were never to be seen again, supposedly translating together into the spiritual world.&lt;ref&gt;Triadic Mysticism, Paul E. Murphy, page 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
[[File:Trident Yantra of Parama Siva.jpg|thumb|The trident (''triśūlābija maṇḍalam''), symbol and yantra of Parama Shiva, representing the triadic energies of ''parā'', ''parā-aparā'' and ''aparā śakti'']]
{{Hinduism}}
Abhinavagupta's works fall into multiple sections: manuals of religious ritual, devotional songs, philosophical works and philosophy of aesthetics. Here are enumerated most of his works.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Bold type faced titles represent the most important ones.

===Religious works===

====Tantraloka====
{{main|Tantraloka}}
His most important work was ''Tantrāloka'',(translates into  "To Throw Light on Tantra"), a synthesis of all the Trika system.&lt;ref name="Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi page 20" /&gt; Its only complete translation in a European language – Italian – is credited to [[Raniero Gnoli]], now at its second edition.&lt;ref&gt;Luce dei Tantra, Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta, Raniero Gnoli, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The esoteric chapter 29 on the Kaula ritual was translated in English together with ''Jayaratha'''s commentary by John R. Dupuche, Rev. Dr.&lt;ref name="The Kula Ritual page 4" /&gt; A complex study on the context, authors, contents and references of ''Tantrāloka'' was published by Navjivan Rastogi, Prof. of the Lucknow University.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi&lt;/ref&gt; Though there are no English translations of ''Tantrāloka'' to date, the last recognized master of the oral tradition of Kashmir Shaivism, [[Swami Lakshman Joo]], gave a condensed version of the important philosophical chapters of ‘‘Tantrāloka’‘ in his book, ''Kashmir Shaivism – The Secret Supreme''.&lt;ref&gt;Kashmir Shaivism – ''The Secret Supreme'', ed, John Hughes, SUNY press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important text was the commentary on Parātrīśikā, ''Parātrīśikāvivaraṇa'', detailing the signification of the phonematic energies and their two sequential ordering systems, Mātṛkā and Mālinī. This was the last great translation project of [[Jaideva Singh]].&lt;ref&gt;Para-trisika-Vivarana, Jaideva Singh&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tantrasara====
{{main|Tantrasara}}
Tantrasāra ("Essence of Tantra") is a summarised version, in prose, of ''Tantrāloka'', which was once more summarised in ''Tantroccaya'', and finally presented in a very short summary form under the name of ''Tantravaṭadhānikā'' – the "Seed of Tantra".

''Pūrvapañcikā'' was a commentary of ''Pūrvatantra'', alias Mālinīvijaya Tantra, lost to this day. ''Mālinīvijayā-varttika'' ("Commentary on Mālinīvijaya") is a versified commentary on ''Mālinīvijaya Tantra'''s first verse. ''Kramakeli'', "Krama's Play" was a commentary of ''Kramastotra'', now lost. ''Bhagavadgītārtha-saṃgraha'' which translates "Commentary on [[Bhagavad Gita]]" has now an English translation by Boris Marjanovic.&lt;ref&gt;Abhinavagupta's Commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, Boris Marjanovic&lt;/ref&gt;

Other religious works are: ''Parātrīśikā-laghuvṛtti'', "A Short Commentary on Parātrīśikā", ''Paryantapañcāśīkā'' ("Fifty Verses on the Ultimate Reality"), ''Rahasyapañcadaśikā'' ("Fifteen Verses on the Mystical Doctrine"), ''Laghvī prakriyā'' ("Short Ceremony"), ''Devīstotravivaraṇa'' ("Commentary on the Hymn to Devi") and ''Paramārthasāra'' ("Essence of the Supreme Reality").

===Devotional hymns===
Abhinavagupta has composed a number of devotional poems, most of which have been translated into French by [[Lilian Silburn]]:&lt;ref&gt;Hymnes de Abhinavagupta: Traduits et commentés, Lilian Silburn&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Bodhapañcadaśikā'' – "Fifteen Verses on Consciousness";
* ''Paramārthacarcā'' – "Discussion on the Supreme Reality";
* ''Anubhavanivedana'' – "Tribute of the Inner Experience";
* ''Anuttarāṣṭikā'' – "Eight Verses on [[Anuttara]]";
* ''Krama-stotra'' – an hymn, different from the fundamental text of the [[Krama]] school;
* ''Bhairava-stava'' – "Hymn to [[Bhairava]]";
* ''Dehasthadevatācakra-stotra'' – "Hymn to the Wheel of Divinities that Live in the Body";
* ''Paramārthadvādaśikā'' – "Twelve Verses on the Supreme Reality" and
* ''Mahopadeśa-viṃśatikā'' – "Twenty Verses on the Great Teaching".
* Another poem ''Śivaśaktyavinābhāva-stotra'' – "Hymn on the Inseparability of [[Shiva]] and [[Shakti]]" was lost.

===Philosophical works===
One of the most important works of Abhinavagupta is ''Īśvarapratyabhijñā-vimarśini'' ("Commentary to the Verses on the Recognition of the Lord") and ''Īśvarapratyabhijñā-vivṛti-vimarśini'' ("Commentary on the explanation of ''Īśvarapratyabhijñā''"). This treatise is fundamental in the transmission of the ''Pratyabhijña'' school (the branch of Kashmir Shaivism based on direct recognition of the Lord) to our days. Another commentary on a ''Pratyabhijña'' work – ''Śivadṛṣtyā-locana'' ("Light on Śivadṛṣṭi") – is now lost. Another lost commentary is ''Padārthapraveśa-nirṇaya-ṭīkā'' and ''Prakīrṇkavivaraṇa'' ("Comment on the Notebook") referring to the third chapter of ''Vākyapadīya'' of [[Bhartrihari]]. Two more philosophical texts of Abhinavagupta are ''Kathāmukha-tilaka''("Ornament of the Face of Discourses") and ''Bhedavāda-vidāraṇa'' ("Confrontation of the Dualist Thesis"). Abhinavagupta's thought was strongly influenced by Buddhist logic.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Padoux. ''Vac: The Concept of the Word In Selected Hindu Tantras''. SUNY Press, 1990. page 180 "One knows that the thought of such authors as Abhinavagupta was strongly influenced by Buddhist logic."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poetical and dramatic works===
{{main|Abhinavabharati}}
''Abhinavagupta''s most important work on the philosophy of art is ''Abhinavabhāratī'' – a long and complex commentary on [[Natya Shastra]] of [[Bharata Muni]]. This work has been one of the most important factors contributing to Abhinavagupta's fame up until present day. His most important contribution was that to the theory of [[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]] (aesthetic savour).

Other poetical works include: ''Ghaṭa-karpara-kulaka-vivṛti'', a commentary on "Ghaṭakarpara" of [[Kalidasa]]; ''Kāvyakauṭukavivaraṇa'', a "Commentary to the Wonder of Poetry" (a work of Bhaṭṭa Tauta), now lost; and ''Dhvanyālokalocana'', "Illustration of Dhvanyāloka", which is a famous work of [[Anandavardhana]].

'''Brain implants''', often referred to as '''neural implants''', are technological devices that connect directly to a biological subject's [[brain]] – usually placed on the surface of the brain, or attached to the [[brain]]'s [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]]. A common purpose of modern brain implants and the focus of much current research is establishing a [[biomedical]] prosthesis circumventing areas in the brain that have become dysfunctional after a [[stroke]] or other [[head injury|head injuries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krucoff|first=Max O.|last2=Rahimpour|first2=Shervin|last3=Slutzky|first3=Marc W.|last4=Edgerton|first4=V. Reggie|last5=Turner|first5=Dennis A.|date=2016-01-01|year=|title=Enhancing Nervous System Recovery through Neurobiologics, Neural Interface Training, and Neurorehabilitation|journal=Frontiers in Neuroscience|volume=10|pages=584|doi=10.3389/fnins.2016.00584|issn=1662-4548|pmc=5186786|pmid=28082858|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes [[sensory substitution]], e.g., in [[Visual perception|vision]]. Other brain implants are used in animal experiments simply to record brain activity for scientific reasons. Some brain implants involve creating interfaces between [[biological neural network|neural systems]] and [[integrated circuit|computer chips]]. This work is part of a wider research field called [[brain-computer interface]]s. (Brain-computer interface research also includes technology such as [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] arrays that allow interface between mind and machine but do not require direct implantation of a device.)

Neural implants such as [[deep brain stimulation]] and [[Vagus nerve stimulation]] are increasingly becoming routine for patients with [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[clinical depression]] respectively.

==Purpose==
Brain implants electrically stimulate, block&lt;ref name="medscape.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/577292 |title=Implantable Device that Blocks Brain Signals Shows Promise in Obesity |publisher=Medscape |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; or record (or both record and stimulate simultaneously&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=June 21, 2007 |author=Patrick Mahoney |url=http://machinedesign.com/ContentItem/67966/Wirelessisgettingunderourskin.aspx |title=Wireless is getting under our skin |publisher=Machine Design |accessdate=2011-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604164839/http://machinedesign.com/ContentItem/67966/Wirelessisgettingunderourskin.aspx |archivedate=2008-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) signals from single [[neuron]]s or groups of neurons ([[biological neural network]]s) in the brain. The blocking technique is called intra-abdominal vagal blocking.&lt;ref name="medscape.com"/&gt; This can only be done where the functional associations of these neurons are approximately known. Because of the complexity of neural processing and the lack of access to [[action potential]] related signals using [[neuroimaging]] techniques, the application of brain implants has been seriously limited until recent advances in neurophysiology and computer processing power.

==Research and applications==
Research in [[sensory substitution]] has made significant progress since 1970. Especially in vision, due to the knowledge of the working of the [[visual system]], [[Visual prosthetic|eye implants]] (often involving some brain implants or monitoring) have been applied with demonstrated success. For [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[cochlear implant]]s are used to stimulate the auditory nerve directly. The [[vestibulocochlear nerve]] is part of the [[peripheral nervous system]], but the interface is similar to that of true brain implants.

Multiple projects have demonstrated success at recording from the brains of animals for long periods of time. As early as 1976, researchers at the [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] led by Edward Schmidt made action potential recordings of signals from [[rhesus monkey]] motor cortexes using immovable "hatpin" electrodes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schmidt |first1=E.M. |last2=Bak |first2=M.J. |last3=McIntosh |first3=J.S. |title=Long-term chronic recording from cortical neurons |journal=Experimental Neurology |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=496–506 |date=1976 |pmid=821770 |doi=10.1016/0014-4886(76)90220-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; including recording from single neurons for over 30 days, and consistent recordings for greater than three years from the best electrodes.

The "hatpin" electrodes were made of pure iridium and insulated with [http://vsiparylene.com/parylene-advantages/properties/ Parylene-c], materials that are currently used in the [[Cyberkinetics]] implementation of the Utah array.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.cyberkineticsinc.com/pdf/cyber.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060324150335/http://www.cyberkineticsinc.com/pdf/cyber.pdf |date=March 24, 2006}} Cyberkinetics array&lt;/ref&gt; These same electrodes, or derivations thereof using the same biocompatible electrode materials, are currently used in visual prosthetics laboratories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Troyk |first1=Philip |last2=Bak |first2=Martin |last3=Berg |first3=Joshua |last4=Bradley |first4=David |last5=Cogan |first5=Stuart |last6=Erickson |first6=Robert |last7=Kufta |first7=Conrad |last8=McCreery |first8=Douglas |last9=Schmidt |first9=Edward |title=A Model for Intracortical Visual Prosthesis Research |journal=Artificial Organs |volume=27 |issue=11 |pages=1005–15 |date=2003 |pmid=14616519 |doi=10.1046/j.1525-1594.2003.07308.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; laboratories studying the neural basis of learning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blake |first1=David T. |last2=Heiser |first2=Marc A. |last3=Caywood |first3=Matthew |last4=Merzenich |first4=Michael M. |title=Experience-Dependent Adult Cortical Plasticity Requires Cognitive Association between Sensation and Reward |journal=Neuron |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=371–81 |date=2006 |pmid=17046698 |pmc=2826987 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2006.08.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and motor prosthetics approaches other than the [[Cyberkinetics]] probes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Neuroscientists Demonstrate New Way to Control Prosthetic Device with Brain Signals |publisher=Caltech |date=July 8, 2004 |url=http://media.caltech.edu/press_releases/12553 |accessdate=February 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719160220/http://media.caltech.edu/press_releases/12553 |archivedate=July 19, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These studies are presently limited to several months by the longevity of the implants. The array now forms the sensor component of the [[Braingate]].

Much research is also being done on the [[Surface Chemistry of Neural Implants|surface chemistry of neural implants]] in effort to design products which minimize all negative effects that an active implant can have on the brain, and that the body can have on the function of the implant.

Another type of neural implant that is being experimented on is [[Prosthetic Neuronal Memory Silicon Chips]], which imitate the signal processing done by functioning neurons that allows peoples' brains to create long-term memories.

In 2016, scientists at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] announced development of tiny brain sensors for use postoperative monitoring, which melt away when they are no longer needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.illinois.edu/blog/view/6367/312684|title=Tiny electronic implants monitor brain injury, then melt away|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|date=January 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military===
[[DARPA]] has announced its interest in developing "cyborg insects" to transmit data from sensors implanted into the insect during the [[pupa]]l stage. The insect's motion would be controlled from a Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) and could conceivably survey an environment or detect explosives and gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20060313-120147-9229r.htm Military seeks to develop 'insect cyborgs']. ''Washington Times'' (13 March 2006). Retrieved on 29 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, DARPA is developing a neural implant to remotely control the movement of [[sharks]].  The shark's unique senses would then be exploited to provide data feedback in relation to enemy ship movement or underwater explosives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/technology/060307_shark_implant.html Military Plans Cyborg Sharks].

The use of neural implants has recently been attempted, with success, on cockroaches. Surgically applied electrodes were put on the insect, which were remotely controlled by a human. The results, although sometimes different, basically showed that the cockroach could be controlled by the impulses it received through the electrodes. [[DARPA]] is now funding this research because of its obvious beneficial applications to the military and other areas&lt;ref name=Anthes&gt;{{cite news|last=Anthes|first=E.|title=The race to create 'insect cyborgs'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/feb/17/race-to-create-insect-cyborgs|accessdate=23 February 2013|location=London|work=The Guardian|date=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 at the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) Micro-electronic mechanical systems (MEMS) conference in [[Italy]], researchers demonstrated the first "wireless" flying-beetle cyborg.&lt;ref&gt;Ornes, Stephen.

==Rehabilitation==
{{See also|Nanotechnology|Neurotechnology}}

[[Neurostimulator]]s have been in use since 1997 to ease the symptoms of such diseases as [[epilepsy]], [[Parkinson's Disease]], [[dystonia]] and recently [[clinical depression|depression]].

Current brain implants are made from a variety of materials such as [[tungsten]], [[silicon]], [[platinum]]-[[iridium]], or even [[stainless steel]]. Future brain implants may make use of more exotic materials such as nanoscale [[carbon fiber]]s ([[Carbon nanotube|nanotubes]]), and [[polycarbonate]] [[polyurethane|urethane]].

==Historical research==
{{See also|History of neuroimaging}}

In 1870, [[Eduard Hitzig]] and Gustav Fritsch demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the brains of dogs could produce movements. [[Robert Bartholow]] showed the same to be true for humans in 1874. By the start of the 20th century, Fedor Krause began to systematically map human brain areas, using patients that had undergone [[brain surgery]].

Prominent research was conducted in the 1950s. [[Robert Galbraith Heath|Robert G. Heath]] experimented with aggressive mental patients, aiming to influence his subjects' moods through electrical stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0005791672900298|title=Septal stimulation for the initiation of heterosexual behavior in a homosexual male|doi=10.1016/0005-7916(72)90029-8 | volume=3|journal=Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry|pages=23–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yale University physiologist [[José Manuel Rodriguez Delgado|Jose Delgado]] demonstrated limited control of animal and human subjects' behaviours using electronic stimulation. He invented the ''stimoceiver'' or ''transdermal stimulator'', a device implanted in the brain to transmit electrical impulses that modify basic behaviours such as aggression or sensations of pleasure.

Delgado was later to write a popular book on mind control, called ''Physical Control of the Mind'', where he stated: "the feasibility of remote control of activities in several species of animals has been demonstrated [...] The ultimate objective of this research is to provide an understanding of the mechanisms involved in the directional control of animals and to provide practical systems suitable for human application."

In the 1950s, the CIA also funded research into [[mind control]] techniques, through programs such as [[MKULTRA]]. Perhaps because he received funding for some research through the US [[Office of Naval Research]], it has been suggested (but not proven) that Delgado also received backing through the CIA. He denied this claim in a 2005 article in ''Scientific American'' describing it only as a speculation by conspiracy-theorists. He stated that his research was only progressively scientifically motivated to understand how the brain works.

==Concerns and ethical considerations==
{{See also|Neuroethics}}
Ethical questions raised include who are good candidates to receive neural implants and what are good and bad uses of neural implants.
Whilst [[deep brain stimulation]] is increasingly becoming routine for patients with Parkinson's disease, there may be some behavioural side effects. Reports in the literature describe the possibility of apathy, hallucinations, compulsive gambling, hypersexuality, cognitive dysfunction, and depression. However, these may be temporary and related to correct placement and calibration of the stimulator and so are potentially reversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burn |first1=D. J. |last2=Tröster |first2=AI |title=Neuropsychiatric Complications of Medical and Surgical Therapies for Parkinson's Disease |journal=Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry and Neurology |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=172–80 |date=2004 |pmid=15312281 |doi=10.1177/0891988704267466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[transhumanism|transhumanists]], such as [[Raymond Kurzweil]] and [[Kevin Warwick]], see brain implants as part of a next step for humans in progress and [[evolution]], whereas others, especially [[bioconservative]]s, view them as [[appeal to nature|unnatural]], with humankind losing essential [[human]] qualities. It raises controversy similar to other forms of [[human enhancement]]. For instance, it is argued that implants would technically change people into cybernetic organisms ([[cyborgs]]). It's also expected that all research will comply to the [[Declaration of Helsinki]]. Yet further, the usual legal duties apply such as information to the person wearing implants and that the implants are voluntary, with (very) few exceptions.

Other concerns involve vulnerabilities of neural implants to cybercrime or intrusive surveillance as neural implants could be hacked, misused or misdesigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/publications/gp_solo/2013/january_february/science_technology_law_neural_implants_legal_implications.html|title=SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY LAW: Neural Implants and Their Legal Implications  {{!}} Solo, Small Firm and General Practice Division|website=www.americanbar.org|access-date=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sadja states that "one's private thoughts are important to protect" and doesn't considers it a good idea to just charge the government or any company to protect them. Walter Glannon, a neuroethicist of the [[University of Calgary]] notes that "there is a risk of the microchips being hacked by third parties" and that "this could interfere with the user's intention to perform actions, violate privacy by extracting information from the chip".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=Elon Musk says humans must become cyborgs to stay relevant.

==In fiction and philosophy==
{{See also|Category:Brain–computer interfacing in fiction}}
Brain implants are now part of modern culture but there were early philosophical references of relevance as far back as [[René Descartes]].

In his 1641 ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy|Meditations]]'', Descartes argued that it would be impossible to tell if all one's apparently real experiences were in fact being produced by an [[evil demon]] intent on deception. A modern twist on Descartes' argument is provided by the  "[[brain in a vat]]" thought experiment, which imagines a brain, sustained apart from its body in a vat of nutrients, and hooked up to a computer which is capable of stimulating it in such a way as to produce the illusion that everything is normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reason, Truth and History|last=Putnam|first=Hilary|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1981|isbn=9780511625398|location=Cambridge|pages=1–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular science fiction discussing brain implants and [[mind control]] became widespread in the 20th century, often with a dystopian outlook. Literature in the 1970s delved into the topic, including ''[[The Terminal Man]]'' by [[Michael Crichton]], where a man suffering from brain damage receives an experimental surgical brain implant designed to prevent seizures, which he abuses by triggering for pleasure. Another example is [[Larry Niven]]'s science fiction writing of [[Wirehead (science fiction)|wire-heads]] in his "[[Known Space]]" stories.

Fear that the technology will be misused by the government and military is an early theme. In the 1981 BBC serial ''[[The Nightmare Man]]'' the pilot of a high-tech mini submarine is linked to his craft via a brain implant but becomes a savage killer after ripping out the implant.

Perhaps the most influential novel exploring the world of brain implants was [[William Gibson]]'s 1984 novel ''[[Neuromancer]]''. This was the first novel in a genre that came to be known as "[[cyberpunk]]". It follows a computer hacker through a world where mercenaries are augmented with brain implants to enhance strength, vision, memory, etc. Gibson coins the term "matrix" and introduces the concept of "jacking in" with head electrodes or direct implants. He also explores possible entertainment applications of brain implants such as the "simstim" (simulated stimulation) which is a device used to record and playback experiences.

Another example is "The Alliance ", in which a society is controlled by implants. 
Gibson's work led to an explosion in popular culture references to brain implants. Its influences are felt, for example, in the 1989 roleplaying game ''[[Shadowrun]]'', which borrowed his term "datajack" to describe a brain-computer interface. The implants in Gibson's novels and short stories formed the template for the 1995 film ''[[Johnny Mnemonic]]'' and later, ''[[The Matrix Trilogy]]''.

[[Pulp magazine|Pulp fiction]] with implants or brain implants include the novel series ''Typers'', film ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', the TV series ''[[Earth: Final Conflict]]'', and numerous computer/video games.

* ''[[The Gap Cycle]]'' (''The Gap into''): In [[Stephen R. Donaldson]]'s series of novels, the use (and misuse) of "zone implant" technology is key to several plotlines.
* ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' [[anime]] and [[manga]] franchise: [[Cyberbrain]] neural augmentation technology is the focus. Implants of powerful computers provide vastly increased memory capacity, total recall, as well as the ability to view his or her own memories on an external viewing device. Users can also initiate a telepathic conversation with other cyberbrain users, the downsides being cyberbrain hacking, malicious memory alteration, and the deliberate distortion of subjective reality and experience.
* In [[Larry Niven]] and [[Jerry Pournelle]]'s ''[[Oath of Fealty (novel)|Oath of Fealty]]'' (1981) an [[arcology]] with high surveillance and [[feudal society|feudal]]-like society is built by a private company due to riots around Los Angeles. Its systems are run by MILLIE, an advanced computer system, with some high-level executives being able to communicate directly with it and given omniscience of the arcology's workings via expensive implants in their brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pringle|first1=David|title=Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels|isbn=0-947761-11-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8m_EAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT200&amp;lpg=PT200&amp;dq=MILLIE+oath+of+fealty|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===
* In the video games ''[[PlanetSide]]'' and ''[[Chrome (video game)|Chrome]]'', players can use implants to improve their aim, run faster, and see better, along with other enhancements.
* The [[Deus Ex|''Deus Ex'' video game series]] addresses the nature and impact of [[human enhancement]] with regard to a wide variety of prosthesis and brain implants. ''[[Deus Ex: Human Revolution]]'', set in 2027, details the impact on society of human augmentation and the controversy it could generate. Several characters in the game have implanted neurochips to aid their professions (or their whims). Examples are of a helicopter pilot with implanted chips to better pilot her aircraft and analyse flight paths, velocity and spatial awareness, as well as a hacker with a brain-computer interface that allows direct access to computer networks and also to act as a 'human proxy' to allow an individual in a remote location to control his actions.
:The game raises the question of the downsides of this kind of augmentation as those who cannot afford the enhancements (or object to getting them) rapidly find themselves at a serious disadvantage against people with artificial enhancement of their abilities. The spectre of being forced to have mechanical or electronic enhancements just to get a job is explored as well. The storyline addresses the effect of implant rejection by use of the fictional drug 'Neuropozyne' which breaks down glial tissue and is also fiercely addictive, leaving people who have augmentations little choice but to continue buying the drug from biotech corporations who control the price of it. Without the drug, augmented people experience rejection of implants, crippling pain and possible death.

"'''Coon vs. Coon and Friends'''" is the thirteenth episode of the [[South Park (season 14)|fourteenth season]] and the 208th overall episode of [[Comedy Central]]'s series ''[[South Park]]''. It originally aired on November 10, 2010.

The episode was written and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]], and was rated [[TV-MA]] L in the United States. In its original American broadcast on November 10, 2010, "Coon vs. Coon and Friends" was watched by 3.249 million viewers, according to the Nielsen Media Research. It was the highest viewed scripted show. It received a 1.9 rating/5% share among adult viewers between ages 18 and 49.

In this episode, Cartman shows himself to be even more evil than the dark lord, [[Cthulhu]], as he punishes his former partners in Coon &amp; Friends. Kenny is wrestling with the weight of his own super power through his alter-ego, Mysterion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southparkstudios.co.uk/news/coon-vs-coon-and-friends-announcement/ |title=Access Denied |publisher=South Park Studios |date= |accessdate=2011-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303194219/http://www.southparkstudios.co.uk/news/coon-vs-coon-and-friends-announcement/ |archivedate=2012-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This episode also spoofs pop star [[Justin Bieber]].

The episode continues from previous South Park episodes "[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]" and "[[Mysterion Rises]]" and reveals the identities of all of Coon and Friends.

==Plot==
[[Bradley Biggle]], as Mint Berry Crunch is summarizing the previous episode in a [[comic book]] format.  The boys raise concern over Mint Berry Crunch's super powers, as they do not accept "the power of [[lamiaceae|mint]] and [[berry]] with a satisfying tasty crunch" as a legitimate super power. While discussing powers, the boys ask Mysterion about his power. Mysterion boldly states that "I can't die." The other boys, who are only imagining their powers, casually take note. Mysterion sees that they are not taking him seriously, and with mounting frustration, he elaborates to them that "I really, really can't die." He tries to remind them that they witnessed him being stabbed to death the night before, but the other boys do not remember at all. In an attempt to prove his point, Mysterion shouts at them to remember, pulls out a [[handgun]], and shoots himself in the head, leaving the boys in utter shock. However, much to the annoyance of Mysterion, they later completely forget about it when everyone including himself returns for another meeting on good deeds.

After providing his own distorted summary of the story so far, Cartman (after using the "[[LeBron James]] Technique" to confuse his mother into not grounding him) arrives and lures the heroes outside, where he orders [[Cthulhu]] to banish them to a dark oblivion. Mint Berry Crunch runs away and pretends to be heroic by watching ''[[Judge Judy]]'', while the rest of the heroes are transported to [[R'lyeh]]. With that done, Cartman has Cthulhu head to the [[Burning Man]] festival to massacre hippies. At R'lyeh, seeing death as his only potential escape back to Earth and save his friends, Mysterion commits suicide by jumping into a pit of deadly spikes (complaining about the pain of this particular manner of death as he does so). Kenny awakens back in his bed and dons his Mysterion outfit, setting off to learn more about Cthulhu and his own powers in order to save his friends. He goes to Henrietta's house, where she and the other Goth kids are complaining about Cthulhu not changing everything as they were made to believe, and claiming "It's just like [[Barack Obama|Obama]]". Just then, Henrietta's mother comes in and tells her that her brother, who turns out to be Bradley, wants to play with them. Upon entering the room, Bradley sees Mysterion and runs back to his room to change into his Mint Berry Crunch outfit. Meanwhile, the Goth kids tell Mysterion that Cthulhu can only be killed by another immortal, meaning that Kenny is seemingly the only one who has the power to stop Cthulhu's rampage.

Followed by Mint Berry Crunch, Mysterion tracks down the Coon and Cthulhu as the latter have just finished massacring [[Justin Bieber]] and a number of his fans. After berating the Coon for re-making the world in his own image (something no superhero is meant to do), Mysterion challenges Cthulhu by offering him an easy win if he brings his friends back, only for Cthulhu to simply walk away after being influenced by the Coon's "cute kitten" act. A bright light descends from the air and a man appears inside, who reveals himself to be Bradley's biological father from a far away planet who sent his son to Earth to stop evil from taking over the Earth. Bradley, whose Mint Berry Crunch powers were actually real, manages to subdue Cthulhu, drag him back to the dimension from which he came, save the other heroes from oblivion, shut the hole which [[BP]] drilled into the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and briefly return home to give the [[The finger|middle finger]] to his sister. With Cartman jailed at the Coon &amp; Friends' secret base, Mint Berry Crunch vanishes in a flash of light as the rest of the heroes express surprise that Bradley really did have superpowers. Mysterion, disappointed that he did not learn anything about his true past and identity, says he is going to bed and shoots himself in the head. That night, his mother suddenly gives birth to another new baby Kenny. Wrapping him in an orange hoodie, she remarks to his father that they never should have gone to those cult meetings.

==Cultural references==
Like "[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]" and "[[Mysterion Rises]]" the third part heavily references the works of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], especially the [[Cthulhu Mythos]].&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;{{cite web|author= Ramsey Isler |url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/113/1133546p1.html |title=South Park: "Coon vs. Coon and Friends" Review – TV Review at IGN |publisher=Uk.tv.ign.com |date=2010-11-11 |accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This episode also references the [[Merrie Melodies]] cartoon short ''[[Feed the Kitty]]'', with Cartman acting as [[Marc Antony and Pussyfoot|Pussyfoot]] and Cthulhu as [[Marc Antony and Pussyfoot|Marc Antony]] in his "cute kitten" routine.&lt;ref name="avclub" /&gt;

In his quest to "make the world a better place", the Coon ([[Eric Cartman]]'s alter ego), persuades [[Cthulhu]] to destroy the [[Whole Food Market]] supermarket chain,&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt; which specializes in organic and healthy food.&lt;ref name="avclub" /&gt; They attack the [[Burning Man]] festival,&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Neal |first=Sean |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/coon-vs-coon-and-friends,47327/ |title="Coon vs. Coon and Friends" &amp;#124; South Park &amp;#124; TV Club &amp;#124; TV |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=2010-11-10 |accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is, according to Cartman, "the biggest [[hippie]] festival in the world". A news reporter at the site of the slaughter mistakes The Coon for "[[Bruce Vilanch]] in a rat costume",&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt; an assumption first made in "[[The Coon]]". Another target, and in Cartman's eyes, the "most challenging and most evil opponent", is teen-star [[Justin Bieber]].&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt; The [[LeBron James]] [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] commercial is also spoofed again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/blog/ball_dont_lie/post/Video-South-Park-takes-on-LeBron-James-ad?urn=nba-282494|title=Video: 'South Park' takes on LeBron James' ad|last=Dwyer|first=Kelly|date=Nov 4, 2010|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|accessdate=Nov 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsgrid.com/media/watch-south-park-spoofs-lebron-james-nike-commercial/|title=WATCH: South Park Spoofs LeBron James' Nike Commercial|last=Rothbard|first=Barry|date=Nov 4, 2010|publisher=[[Dan Abrams#Sports Grid|Sports Grid]]|accessdate=Nov 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nesn.com/2010/11/clevelanders-michelle-beadle-south-park-take-stabs-at-lebron-james-rise-ad.html|title=Clevelanders, Michelle Beadle, South Park Take Stabs at LeBron James 'Rise' Ad|last=Coman|first=Nick|date=Nov 6, 2010|publisher=[[New England Sports Network]]|accessdate=Nov 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartman tries to lure the boys out of his basement with promises of a double rainbow, coinciding with the popularity of the "Double Rainbow" viral video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-07-14/tech/double.rainbows_1_double-rainbow-youtube-fighter?_s=PM:TECH |title=How the 'double rainbow' video blew up |last=Brown |first=Damon |date=July 14, 2010 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=Nov 21, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124014259/http://articles.cnn.com/2010-07-14/tech/double.rainbows_1_double-rainbow-youtube-fighter?_s=PM%3ATECH |archivedate=November 24, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the song that Cartman sings while walking to his house is "[[Faith (George Michael song)|Faith]]" by [[George Michael]].&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|0b6V9ms3KRU|Eric Cartman has the faith}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end when Mint Berry Crunch discovers that he has powers, ''[[The NeverEnding Story (film)|The NeverEnding Story]]'' theme song singer, [[Limahl]], appears before him.

===Critical reception===
The episode received mostly positive reviews. [[IGN]] gave the episode a "great" score of 8.0 and said "The Coon and Friends trilogy comes to an end in grand fashion, with epic battles, strange alliances, and secret origins revealed. It's a tale told in the finest comic book traditions, and it's one of the most creative episodes ''South Park'' has produced recently."&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt; ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode a B+, a vast improvement over the C and C+ rating given to ''Coon 2: Hindsight'' and ''Mysterion Rises'', stating that the episode was "fleeter and funnier, it wasted less time on padded-out tangents, and it satisfactorily resolved the question of Kenny's immortality" and called the episode "as well-executed an ending as one could probably hope for here".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://tv.avclub.com/south-park-coon-vs-coon-and-friends-1798166492|title=South Park: Coon vs. Coon and Friends|work=[[The A.V. Club]]|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic gave the episode a score of 4 out of 5, calling it an "entertaining, fitting finish", stating that it "dropped all the things we hated about the first two parts" and delivered a "solid, fun half hour", praising the twist ending, the portrayal of Cartman and how he "believed he truly was making the world a better place", as well as the death of Justin Bieber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.tvfanatic.com/2010/11/south-park-review-coon-vs-coon-and-friends/|title=South Park Review: "Coon vs. Coon &amp; Friends|work=TV Fanatic|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}Journalist Aftab Alam and four others were killed in several related attacks in North [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]]. Alam was targeted for murder by the [[Sipah-e-Muhammad Pakistan]] (SMP) to provoke sectarian violence in Pakistan as he was from the [[Deobandi movement]] and to receive the widespread news coverage that a journalist typically receives when killed. At least four others were killed in the same terrorist operation.&lt;ref name=Dawn /&gt;&lt;ref name=dailyregionaltimesARREST&gt;{{cite news|title=Police arrest 4 suspects in Aftab Alam murder case |newspaper=Daily Regional Times |date=September 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=remandextendcase&gt;{{cite news|title=ATC extends remand of journalist Aftab Alam's murder suspect |publisher=The News International |date=October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftab Alam==
Aftab Alam was born around 1970. He lived with his extended family in the 11-C area of North Karachi, which is close to the Sir Syed market. On the day of his murder, he was arriving home from picking up his children from school. After the attack he died on the way to the hospital. He was 44 years old at the time of his murder.&lt;ref name=Dawn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1206050|title=TV journalist shot dead in Karachi|author=Imtiaz Ali|work=dawn.com |date=September 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=geo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.tv/article-196836-Senior-journalist-Aftab-Alam-gunned-down-in-Karachi-|title=Senior journalist Aftab Alam gunned down in Karachi – PAKISTAN – geo.tv|date=9 September 2015|work=geo.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zeenews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/south-asia/senior-journalist-aftab-alam-shot-dead-in-pakistan_1669871.html|title=Senior journalist Aftab Alam shot dead in Pakistan|work=Zee News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=samaa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samaa.tv/pakistan/2015/09/senior-journalist-aftab-alam-shot-dead/|title=Senior journalist Aftab Alam shot dead|work=Samaa TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--end wikitable--&gt;The attack on Aftab Alam was carried out by Sipah-e-Muhammad Pakistan's Manzar Imam group, which is a [[Shiite]] terrorist group operating in Pakistan and Indian. Alam's name was on the group's hit list of members of the Deobandi movement.&lt;ref name=dailyregionaltimesARREST/&gt;

The [[National Counter Terrorism Authority|Counter Terrorism Department]] arrested four suspects in the case, including Syed Zeeshan Haider Zaidi (known as Zeeshan Haider), who they say confessed to the crime, acted as mastermind, and was trained in [[Iran]]. Police fingered Zaidi as the leader of one of three teams and shooter and Adeel Raza as the driver of the motorcycle. According to the scenario sketched by police, the two pulled up on a motorcycle as Aftab was outside his home and Haider is believed to have shot him in the head. Alam took two bullets to his head and one other to his neck. The CTD spokesperson pointed to suspect Shah Gee, also transliterated as Ji, as the supplier of the 0.9mm pistol. Another team was led by Salman, also transliterated as Suleman. The same group from SMP was also held responsible by the CTD for killing two other men at a bakery in [[Nazimabad]] (5-B-1 area) of Karachi. The two men were also from the Deobandi sect. Another group was responsible for an attack that killed two at Rasheed Qaurma Hotel, also in Nazimabad.&lt;ref name=dailyregionaltimesARREST/&gt;&lt;ref name=FP&gt;{{cite news |title=Iranian trained hit-man has killed Pakistani journalist: Police |newspaper=The Frontier Post |date=September 22, 2015 |url=http://epaper.thefrontierpost.com/e-paper/2015-09-22/ |access-date=2015-11-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074457/http://epaper.thefrontierpost.com/e-paper/2015-09-22/# |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TNI&gt;{{cite news|first=Salis |last=bin Perwaiz |title='Terrorist' held for murdering journalist |publisher=The News International |date=September 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bakers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1205954|title=Two men shot dead in North Karachi ‘sectarian' attack|author=The Newspaper's Staff Reporter|work=dawn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/953677/senior-journalist-aftab-alam-shot-dead-in-karachi/|title=Senior journalist Aftab Alam shot dead in Karachi|date=9 September 2015|work=The Express Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context ==
The murders of Alam and others targeted by the group were timed to take place before the month of [[Muharram]], which for the SMP is full of religious significance. Pakistani counter-terrorism in Karachi was bracing for further violence from [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]], Sipah-e-Muhammad Pakistan (SMP), Mehdi Force, affiliates of the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan]], [[Jundallah (Pakistan)|Jundullah]], and [[al-Qaeda]] and reported that 86 people had been killed in 2015 from sectarian violence.&lt;ref name=ruralmedianetworkpk /&gt;&lt;ref name=muharram&gt;{{cite news|title=Words of caution: Law enforcers brace for Muharram as terror threat looms large |publisher=The Express Tribune |date=October 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact == 
Aftab Alam was murdered the day after Geo TV's satellite technician Arshad Ali Jaffery, also transliterated as Jafri or Jaffari, was killed.&lt;ref name=Dawn /&gt;&lt;ref name=tribune /&gt; At least four other journalists were killed in Pakistan in 2015.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34195950|title=Aftab Alam: Second Pakistan media worker shot dead in Karachi|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan's Long War on the Media |newspaper=New York Times |date=September 15, 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/16/opinion/pakistans-long-war-on-the-media.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thenews&gt;{{cite news|first=Zia Ur |last=Rehman |title=A journalist's nightmare on Karachi streets |date=September 10, 2015 |newspaper=thenews.com.pk |url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-4-339214-A-journalists-nightmare-on-Karachi-streets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time frame as Jaffery and Alam, another journalist, Abdul Azam, was shot three times in [[Peshawar]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], Pakistan, which is close to the Afghanistan border.&lt;ref name=CPJ&gt;{{cite web|title=Reporter killed in third attack on Pakistani journalists in 24 hours|url=https://cpj.org/2015/09/reporter-killed-in-third-attack-on-pakistani-journ.php |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists|accessdate=September 9, 2015|date=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
[[File:Karachi PressClub3.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The Karachi Press Club is active after the death of two journalists over two days.]]The Karachi Union of Journalists held a protest immediately after the murders of Arsad Ali Jaffery and Aftab Alam at the Karachi Press Club.&lt;ref name=KUJ&gt;{{cite news|title=Journalist fraternity protests killing of Jaffery, Alam |publisher=ARY News |date=September 9, 2015 |url=http://arynews.tv/en/journalist-fraternity-protests-killing-of-jaffery-alam/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sindh Governor Dr. Ishratul Ebad Khan has condemned the killing of Jaffery and Alam. "The authorities need to further strengthen the existent security arrangements for the people, particularly journalists," he said.&lt;ref name=thefrontierpost&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefrontierpost.com/article/334999/governor-condemns-killing-of-media-men/ |title=Governor condemns killing of media men |work=thefrontierpost.com }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khurshid Abbasi, secretary general of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), called the two murders a "conspiracy against the media."&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt;

[[Irina Bokova]], director-general of [[UNESCO]], "I condemn the killing of Arshad Ali Jaffari and Aftab Alam.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4155">'''Denailing''' is the extraction of the nails from the fingers and/or toes, either as a medical procedure to treat severe nail infections, or as a method of [[torture]]. The United Nations [[Istanbul Protocol]] describes nail removal and the insertion of objects such as wire under the nail as forms of torture. Removed nails are capable of growing back normally over several months if the [[nail matrix]] is left intact through surgical extraction. However, if the matrix is damaged by trauma, it can result in an overgrowth of tissue from the proximal nail fold, resulting in the formation of [[pterygium]]. Particularly, if the nail matrix is burnt by a heated instrument, subsequent growth may produce nails which are striped, thin, or broken into longitudinal segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Istanbul Protocol: Manual on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment|date=2004|publisher=United Nations|location=New York and Geneva|pages=29–38|edition=Professional Training Series No. 8/Rev.1|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/training8Rev1en.pdf|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval sources described the denailing interrogation process as conducted by laying the prisoner on a tabletop—securing the hands by chains around the wrists and the bare feet by chains around the ankles—and using a metal forceps or pliers&amp;mdash;often heated red-hot&amp;mdash;to individually grasp each nail in turn and slowly pry it from the nail bed before tearing it off the finger or toe. A more painful variant used in medieval Spain was performed by introducing a sharp wedge of wood or metal between the flesh and each nail and slowly hammering the wedge under the nail until it was torn free.&lt;ref&gt;A. Hirsch, ''ed.'', ''The Book of Torture and Executions'' (Toronto: Golden Books, 1944).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cruel variant involved using rough skewers of wood or bone dipped in boiling sulfur. A number of such skewers were slowly driven into the flesh under the prisoner's toenails. Alternately, the skewer was dipped in boiling oil, which served a dual purpose of both burning the incredibly sensitive flesh and lubricating the needle so that the torturer could freely explore a wide surface area beneath the toenail. When enough skewers had been driven home to pry each nail loose from its bed, the nail was torn out at the root with a pair of pliers. This was a favorite technique of torture in the German witch-hunter's arsenal, being extremely inexpensive, portable, and easy to inflict.  It is also recorded that, in more recent times—particularly, during the [[Armenian genocide]] of the 1910s—phonograph needles were driven under fingernails and toenails to torture the prisoner before his nails were torn out with pliers.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Scott, ''A History of Torture'' (London: Merchant, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of [[Italian constitutional referendum, 1946|Italy's republican referendum]] after World War II, efforts to prosecute former officials in the Fascist government for [[collaborationism]] and [[war crimes]] resulted in the legal differentiation between the concepts of normal brutality, cruel brutality, and ''particularly cruel brutality''. Only in the case of particularly cruel brutality would the accused be rejected for amnesty. Denailing was generally considered to fall under the first two categories, as for a brutality to be considered ''particularly cruel'', it had to "horrify even those who are familiar with torture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Caroli|first1=Paolo|title=The Role of the Judiciary Within the Construction of Collective Memory.

'''Donald Ashman''' (9 October 1902 – 1984) was an English [[association football|footballer]] who made 252 appearances in [[the Football League]] playing at [[left half]] or [[full back (association football)|full back]] for [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] and [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]] in the 1920s and 1930s. He began his career in [[non-league football]] with [[Cockfield F.C.|Cockfield]].&lt;ref name=Joyce&gt;{{cite book |last=Joyce |first=Michael |title=Football League Players' Records 1888 to 1939 |publisher=SoccerData |location=Nottingham |page=12 |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-899468-67-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3333">'''Eleanor Markham''' (born c. 1872) was an American woman who became one of the most prominent cases of an averted [[premature burial]] in the late 19th century.

According to news reports at the time, the 22-year-old Miss Markham was pronounced dead in [[Sprakers, New York]] on July 8, 1894, by a Dr. Howard, the family physician.  Since the weather was quite warm, it was decided to have the burial quickly, and her coffin was closed and fastened after family members said goodbye on the morning of July 10.  But on the way to the graveyard, the hearse was stopped after a noise was heard coming from the coffin.  The lid was unfastened to find Miss Markham alive, exclaiming "You are burying me alive!," to which Dr. Howard reportedly said, "Hush child, you are all right.  It is a mistake easily rectified."  

Markham soon after fainted, but recovered after being administered  some stimulants.  She stated that she had been conscious the entire time of the preparations for burial, but was unable to cry out.  She fully believed she would be buried alive, when finally, using all her will, she was able to make a knocking noise to draw attention.&lt;ref name="1912-one"&gt;(13 October 1912). [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045433/1912-10-13/ed-1/seq-26/ Burial Alive is Bugaboo Of the Average Person], ''Washington Herald''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="intell1"&gt;(1 August 1894).

''Notes and Notions'', ''Fort Wayne Gazette'' (one sentence report, states her age was 22 years old)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aus1"&gt;(13 July 1932). [http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article36053566 Earth of Urn Burial], ''[[Burra Record]]'' (1932 mention of Markham's "amazing escape" from burial)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bee1"&gt;(14 July 1894).

The fear of [[premature burial]] was a topic of substantial discussion in the late 19th and early 20th century.  Markham's case was among those included in the book ''Premature Burial and how it May be Prevented'' by [[William Tebb]] and Edward Vollum.  [[Bill Bryson]] also mentions the "well-known case" of Markham in his 2010 book ''[[At Home: A Short History of Private Life]]''.&lt;ref name="bry1"&gt;[[Bill Bryson|Bryson, Bill]]. ''[[At Home: A Short History of Private Life]]'' (2010) (noting great concern in 19th century about risk of premature burial, and noting that Markham's 1894 event was a "well-known case")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="premprev"&gt;Tebb, William, et al.

==Life==

Princess Elisabeth Therese was born at the [[Château de Lunéville]] and was the ninth of eleven children of [[Leopold, Duke of Lorraine|Leopold Joseph of Lorraine]] and his wife [[Élisabeth Charlotte d'Orléans]].&lt;ref name="Histoire des duchés de Lorraine et de Bar"/&gt; Her mother was a niece of [[Louis XIV]] and her father, a son of [[Eleanor of Austria, Queen of Poland]]. Her eldest brother became [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor]], four years after her death. As a ''[[House of Lorraine|princess of Lorraine]]'' she was entitled to the style of ''Highness'' as well as the rank of ''[[foreign prince]]ss'' in France. During the coronation of the king in October 1722, Elisabeth Therese, her mother, and her sister Anne Charlotte went to the French court. Elisabeth Therese's grandmother found her two granddaughters very charming as well as attractive, though Anne Charlotte was deemed the more beautiful. 

In the spring of 1725, the young [[King Louis XV]] was fifteen and unmarried. He was engaged to [[Mariana Victoria of Spain]], but the young princess was sent back to Spain because she was too young to conceive. As a result, Élisabeth Charlotte began negotiations to marry her daughter to the king. However, this was met with opposition from the king's prime minister, the [[Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon|Duke of Bourbon]], who arranged for the king marry an obscure Polish princess, [[Marie Leszczynska]] later that year. 

Her father died in 1729 amid negotiations regarding a marriage between the then seventeen-year-old Elisabeth Therese and her recently widowed cousin [[Louis d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans]]. He refused outright, much to the annoyance of her mother.&lt;ref name="comte d'Argenson"&gt;{{Cite book| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ntxQVAWPIWAC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=elisabeth+therese+de+lorraine&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VI9yTLanNM_-Od3fjM4D&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title= ''Le comte d'Argenson, 1696-1764: Ministre de Louis XV''|accessdate= 2010-03-29|last= Combeau|first=Yves |work= Googlebooks.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match having come to nothing, leading her mother to name her daughter the ''[[Coadjutor bishop|coadjutrice]]'' of [[Remiremont Abbey]] on 19 October 1734.&lt;ref name="Foucault 1791, p 340"&gt;Foucault: ''Histoire de Léopold I, duc de Lorraine et de Bar, père de l'Empereur'', Paris, 1791, p 340&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Abbey of Remiremont]] was closely associated with the House of Lorraine. Her younger sister [[Anne Charlotte de Lorraine|Anne Charlotte]] was later the abbess of the prestigious institution.

===Queen===

In 1736 her brother the [[Duke of Lorraine]] married the [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria]], daughter and [[heiress apparent]] of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]]. The union between the [[House of Lorraine]] and the [[House of Habsburg]] allowed a more prestigious marriage for the unwed princess. The already twice widowed [[Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia]] asked for her hand in late 1736. 

She married the King of Sardinia by proxy on 5 March 1737 at Lunéville with the [[Victor Amadeus I, Prince of Carignan|Prince of Carignan]], who was the prince's brother-in-law, acting as the king. The day after the proxy marriage, she left for [[Lyon]] where she arrived on 14 March. Her brother the Duke of Lorraine raised a dowry for her and the marriage contract was signed in Vienna by the Duke and Duchess of Lorraine and [[Emperor Charles VI]].&lt;ref name="Calmet Augustin: ''Histoire de Lorraine...depuis l'entrée de Jules César dans les Gaules jusqu'à la cession de la Lorraine, arrivée en 1737'', A. Leseure, 1757, p 309"&gt;Calmet Augustin: ''Histoire de Lorraine...depuis l'entrée de Jules César dans les Gaules jusqu'à la cession de la Lorraine, arrivée en 1737'', A. Leseure, 1757, p 309, 70&lt;/ref&gt; 

The couple married in person on 1 April 1737. Charles Emmanuel III was her first cousin, his mother being [[Anne Marie d'Orléans]], her mother Élisabeth Charlotte's half-sister. The marriage would produce three children, but only one would live to adulthood. She and her husband arrived in Turin on 21 April.&lt;ref name="Calmet Augustin: ''Histoire de Lorraine...depuis l'entrée de Jules César dans les Gaules jusqu'à la cession de la Lorraine, arrivée en 1737'', A. Leseure, 1757, p 309"/&gt;

Elisabeth Therese died at the [[Palace of Venaria]] aged 29, having fallen ill with puerperal fever after childbirth.&lt;ref name="Foucault 1791, p 340"/&gt; She was buried in the [[Turin Cathedral|Cathedral of Saint Giovanni Battista]] in [[Turin]]. She was moved to the [[Basilica of Superga|Royal Basilica of Superga]] in 1786 by her stepson [[Victor Amadeus III]].

'''Emotiv Systems''' is an [[Australian]] electronics innovation company developing technologies to evolve human computer interaction incorporating non-conscious cues into the human-computer dialog to emulate human to human interaction. Developing [[brain–computer interface]]s based on [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) technology, Emotiv Systems produced the EPOC near headset, a peripheral targeting the gaming market for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[OS X]] and [[Linux]] platforms.&lt;ref name=grinding.be&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grinding.be/2008/03/22/emotiv-epoc-neuroheadset-update/ |title=Blog Archive » Emotiv EPOC Neuroheadset Update |publisher=grinding.be |date=2008-03-22 |accessdate=14 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69aROjo8V?url=http://grinding.be/2008/03/22/emotiv-epoc-neuroheadset-update/ |archivedate=1 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPOC has 16 electrodes and was originally designed to work as a brain-computer interface (BCI) [[input device]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first1=Stephen |last1=Johnson |title=Headset makes empty Promises of Mind-Control Games |url=http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/686845/Play_Games_With_Your_Mind.html |publisher=G4 Media, Inc. |date=8 July 2008 |accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was founded in 2003 by technology entrepreneurs [[Tan Le]], Nam Do, [[Allan Snyder]], and [[Neil Weste]]. However, doing a search of business entity name on Emotiv Systems at the business entity registry of the California Secretary of State http://kepler.sos.ca.gov reveals Emotiv Systems has ceased to exist, and, therefore, it should not be mixed up or confused with the currently active U.S. bioinformatics company [[Emotiv]] founded by [[Tan Le]] in 2011 http://emotiv.com/about-emotiv/ in which Nam Do, Allan Snyder, and Neil Weste have no ownerships nor roles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3527">'''Eudokia Baïana''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Ευδοκία Βαϊανή; died 12 April 901) was a Byzantine Empress consort as the third wife of [[Leo VI the Wise]].&lt;ref&gt;John Carr (2015). ''Fighting Emperors of Byzantium''. Pen and Sword. "''Overriding canon law and the grumbles of the clergy who damned third marriages as 'legal fornication', Leo wed a very attractive young woman from Phrygia named Eudokia Baïana''..."&lt;/ref&gt;
== Biography ==
The work ''[[Theophanes Continuatus]]'' was a continuation of the chronicle of [[Theophanes the Confessor]] by other writers, active during the reign of [[Constantine VII]]. The work records the few details known about her.

According to Theophanes, Eudokia came from the [[Opsician Theme]]. The Opsician Theme was originally composed of all of [[Bithynia]] and [[Paphlagonia]], stretching from [[Abydos (Hellespont)|Abydos]] on the [[Dardanelles]] to [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] on the [[Black Sea]] and inland to [[Ancyra]]. In the 20th century, the lands once belonging to the Theme form most of the northwestern quarter of [[Asia]]tic [[Turkey]].

In Spring, 900, Leo VI married Eudokia. His previous two wives had predeceased him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/BYZANTIUM.htm#LeonVIdied912B Leon, car Bizantskog Carstva].&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[De Ceremoniis]]'' by Constantine VII names as many as three daughters born of the previous marriages but no son. Leo wanted to secure his succession by this marriage. [[George Ostrogorsky|George Alexandrovič Ostrogorsky]] points that a third marriage was technically illegal under [[Byzantine law]] and against the practices of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] at the time. Leo VI had to seek permission by [[Antony II of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch Antony II of Constantinople]].

A year later Eudokia [[Maternal death|died while giving birth]]. Theophanes considers the son [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] and unnamed. However ''[[De Ceremoniis]]'' while listing the children of Leo VI names a son called Basil,&lt;ref&gt;Ramón Rionda. 2015. ''La sorprendente genealogía de mis tatarabuelos''. Palibrio. "''De su tercera mujer, Eudokia Baïana, tuvo a Basil''."&lt;/ref&gt; which might indicate her son survived long enough to be named. ''De Ceremoniis'' gives her burial place as the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] in [[Constantinople]].

Lenat envisions ultimately coupling the Cyc knowledgebase with the Eurisko discovery engine.

== History ==

Development commenced at [[Carnegie Mellon]] in 1976 and continued at [[Stanford University]] in 1978 when Lenat returned to teach. "For the first five years, nothing good came out of it", Lenat said. But when the implementation was changed to a [[frame language]] based representation he called RLL ([[Representation Language Language]]), heuristic creation and modification became much simpler. Eurisko was then applied to a number of [[Field of study|domains]] with surprising success, including [[Very Large-Scale Integration|VLSI]] chip design.

Lenat and Eurisko gained notoriety by submitting the winning fleet (a large number of stationary, lightly-armored ships with many small weapons)&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt; to the United States [[Traveller (role-playing game)#Rules system and gameplay|Traveller TCS]] national championship in 1981, forcing extensive changes to the game's rules. However, Eurisko won again in 1982 when the program discovered that the rules permitted the program to destroy its own ships, permitting it to continue to use much the same strategy.&lt;ref name=newyorker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/05/11/090511fa_fact_gladwell?currentPage=all|title=How underdogs can win|publisher=The New Yorker|author=Malcolm Gladwell|accessdate=2010-01-11|date=2009-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tournament officials announced that if Eurisko won another championship the competition would be abolished; Lenat retired Eurisko from the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Eurisko, The Computer With A Mind Of Its Own |last=Johnson |first=George |year=1984 |journal=[http://aliciapatterson.org/stories/eurisko-computer-mind-its-own the APF Reporter] |volume=7 |issue=4 |publisher=The Alicia Patterson Foundation |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Traveller TCS wins brought Lenat to the attention of [[DARPA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Understanding Computers: Artificial Intelligence |publisher = [[Time-Life Books]] |year= 1986 |location = Amsterdam |page=84 |isbn = 0-7054-0915-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has funded much of his subsequent work.

==In popular culture==
In the first-season ''[[The X-Files]]'' episode "[[Ghost in the Machine (The X-Files)|Ghost in the Machine]]", Eurisko is the name of a fictional software company responsible for the episode's "[[Villain of the week|monster of the week]]", facilities management software known as "Central Operating System", or "COS". COS (described in the episode as an "adaptive network") is shown to be capable of learning when its designer arrives at Eurisko headquarters and is surprised to find that COS has given itself the ability to speak. The designer is forced to create a virus to destroy COS after COS commits a series of murders in an apparent effort to prevent its own destruction.

Lenat is also mentioned and Eurisko is discussed at the end of [[Richard Feynman]]'s Computer Heuristics Lecture as part of the Idiosyncratic Thinking Workshop Series.&lt;ref&gt;https://youtube.com/EKWGGDXe5MA?t=1h8m38s&lt;/ref&gt;

The science of extraterrestrial life in all its forms is known as [[exobiology]].

Since the mid-20th century, there has been an ongoing search for signs of extraterrestrial life. This encompasses a search for current and historic extraterrestrial life, and a narrower [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence|search for extraterrestrial intelligent life]]. Depending on the category of search, methods range from  the analysis of telescope and specimen data&lt;ref name="NYT-20150106-DB"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=As Ranks of Goldilocks Planets Grow, Astronomers Consider What’s Next |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/science/space/as-ranks-of-goldilocks-planets-grow-astronomers-consider-whats-next.html |date=6 January 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to radios used to detect and send  communication signals.

The concept of extraterrestrial life, and particularly extraterrestrial intelligence, has had a major cultural impact, chiefly in works of [[science fiction]]. Over the years, science fiction communicated scientific ideas, imagined a wide range of possibilities, and influenced public interest in and perspectives of extraterrestrial life. One shared space is the debate over the wisdom of attempting communication with extraterrestrial intelligence.  Some encourage aggressive methods to try for contact with intelligent extraterrestrial life. Others—citing the tendency of technologically advanced human societies to enslave or wipe out less advanced societies—argue that it may be dangerous to actively call attention to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-31442952 |title=Scientists in US are urged to seek contact with aliens |work=BBC News |first=Pallab |last=Ghosh |date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Would Contact with Extraterrestrials Benefit or Harm Humanity?

==General==
Alien life, such as [[microorganism]]s, has been hypothesized to exist in the [[Solar System]] and throughout the universe. This hypothesis relies on the [[Size of the universe|vast size]] and consistent [[physical law]]s of the [[observable universe]].

===Evolution===
A study published in 2017 suggests that due to how complexity evolved in species on Earth, the level of predictability for alien evolution elsewhere would make them look similar to life on our planet. One of the study authors, Sam Levin, notes "Like humans, we predict that they are made-up of a hierarchy of entities, which all cooperate to produce an alien. At each level of the organism there will be mechanisms in place to eliminate conflict, maintain cooperation, and keep the organism functioning. We can even offer some examples of what these mechanisms will be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2017-10-31-aliens-may-be-more-us-we-think |title=Aliens may be more like us than we think |publisher=[[University of Oxford]] |date=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also research in assessing the capacity of life for developing intelligence. It has been suggested that this capacity arises with the number of potential [[Planetary habitability|niches a planet]] contains, and that the complexity of life itself is reflected in the information density of planetary environments, which in turn can be computed from its niches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evolutionary exobiology: Towards the qualitative assessment of biological potential on exoplanets |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |first1=David S. |last1=Stevenson |first2=Sean |last2=Large |date=25 October 2017 |doi=10.1017/S1473550417000349 |pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life on Earth requires [[water]] as a [[solvent]] in which biochemical reactions take place.

The carbon atom has the unique ability to make four strong chemical bonds with other atoms, including other carbon atoms. These covalent bonds have a direction in space, so that carbon atoms can form the skeletons of complex 3-dimensional structures with definite architectures such as nucleic acids and proteins. Carbon forms more compounds than all other elements combined. The great versatility of the carbon atom makes it the element most likely to provide the bases—even exotic ones—for the chemical composition of life on other planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=To Utopia and Back: The Search for Life in the Solar System |publisher=W.

The [[panspermia]] hypothesis proposes that life elsewhere in the Solar System may have a common origin. If extraterrestrial life was found on another body in the [[Solar System]], it could have originated from Earth just as life on Earth could have been seeded from elsewhere ([[Exogenesis (astrobiology)|exogenesis]]). The first known mention of the term 'panspermia' was in the writings of the 5th century BC [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Anaxagoras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anaxagoras and the Origin of Panspermia Theory |publisher=iUniverse |first=Margaret R. |last=O'Leary |date=2008 |isbn=978-0-595-49596-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century it was again revived in modern form by several scientists, including [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]] (1834),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Analysis of the Alais meteorite and implications about life in other worlds |journal=[[Liebigs Annalen|Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie]] |first=Jöns Jacob |last=Berzelius |author-link=Jöns Jacob Berzelius |volume=10 |pages=134–135 |date=1834}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]] (1871),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The British Association Meeting at Edinburgh |journal=Nature |first=William |last=Thomson |author-link=William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin |volume=4 |issue=92 |pages=261–278 |date=August 1871 |doi=10.1038/004261a0 |bibcode=1871Natur...4..261. |quote=We must regard it as probably to the highest degree that there are countless seed-bearing meteoritic stones moving through space. |pmc=2070380}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1879)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Darwin's Contribution to the Development of the Panspermia Theory |journal=Astrobiology |first=René |last=Demets |volume=12 |issue=10 |pages=946–950 |date=October 2012 |doi=10.1089/ast.2011.0790 |pmid=23078643 |bibcode=2012AsBio..12..946D}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, somewhat later, by [[Svante Arrhenius]] (1903).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/worldsinmakingev00arrhrich |title=Worlds in the Making: The Evolution of the Universe |publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers |first=Svante |last=Arrhenius |others=trans.

[[Sir Fred Hoyle]] (1915–2001) and [[Chandra Wickramasinghe]] (born 1939) are important proponents of the hypothesis who further contended that life forms continue to enter [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]], and may be responsible for epidemic outbreaks, new diseases, and the genetic novelty necessary for [[macroevolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.hoyle.org.uk/resources/virusesfromspacecompressed.pdf |title=Viruses from Space and Related Matters |publisher=University College Cardiff Press |first1=Fred |last1=Hoyle |first2=Chandra |last2=Wickramasinghe |first3=John |last3=Watson |date=1986 |isbn=978-0-906449-93-6 |bibcode=1986vfsr.book.....H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directed panspermia concerns the deliberate transport of microorganisms in space, sent to Earth to start life here, or sent from Earth to seed new stellar systems with life.

However, between an altitude of 50 and 65 kilometers, the pressure and temperature are Earth-like, and it has been speculated that thermoacidophilic  [[extremophile]] [[microorganisms]] might exist in the acidic upper layers of the Venusian atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2843-acidic-clouds-of-venus-could-harbour-life.html |title=Acidic clouds of Venus could harbour life |work=New Scientist |first=Stuart |last=Clark |date=26 September 2003 |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Redfern, Martin (25 May 2004).

Jupiter's moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] has been subject to speculation about the existence of life due to the strong possibility of a liquid water ocean beneath its ice surface.&lt;ref name="Tritt2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schulze-Makuch2001"/&gt; [[Hydrothermal vent]]s on the bottom of the ocean, if they exist, may warm the ice and could be capable of supporting multicellular [[microorganism]]s.&lt;ref name="EuropaPlanetary"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.planetary.org/programs/projects/explore_europa/update_12142005.html |title=Projects: Europa Mission Campaign |publisher=The Planetary Society |first=Louis |last=Friedman |date=14 December 2005 |accessdate=8 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811002508/http://www.planetary.org/programs/projects/explore_europa/update_12142005.html |archivedate=11 August 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that Europa could support aerobic macrofauna using oxygen created by cosmic rays impacting its surface ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Europa Capable of Supporting Life, Scientist Says |first=Nancy |last=Atkinson |year=2009 |publisher=Universe Today |url=http://www.universetoday.com/2009/10/08/europa-capable-of-supporting-life-scientist-says/ |accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case for life on Europa was greatly enhanced in 2011 when it was discovered that vast lakes exist within Europa's thick, icy shell. Scientists found that ice shelves surrounding the lakes appear to be collapsing into them, thereby providing a mechanism through which life-forming chemicals created in sunlit areas on Europa's surface could be transferred to its interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/11/17/huge-lakes-of-water-may-exist-under-europas-ice/ |title=Huge lakes of water may exist under Europa's ice |series=Bad Astronomy Blog |work=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |first=Phil |last=Plait |date=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/2011/11/scientists-find-evidence-for-great-lake-on-europa/ |title=Scientists Find Evidence for "Great Lake" on Europa and Potential New Habitat for Life |publisher=The University of Texas at Austin |date=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Models of heat retention and heating via [[radioactive decay]] in smaller icy Solar System bodies suggest that [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]], [[Titania (moon)|Titania]], [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]], [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], [[Pluto (dwarf planet)|Pluto]], [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]], and [[90482 Orcus|Orcus]] may have oceans underneath solid icy crusts approximately 100&amp;nbsp;km thick.&lt;ref name="Hussmann Sohl et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2006.06.005| last1 = Hussmann| first1 = Hauke| last2 = Sohl| first2 = Frank| last3 = Spohn| first3 = Tilman| date = November 2006| title = Subsurface oceans and deep interiors of medium-sized outer planet satellites and large trans-neptunian objects| journal = [[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]]| volume = 185| issue = 1| pages = 258–273| url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225019299| bibcode = 2006Icar..185..258H| ref = {{sfnRef|Hussmann Sohl et al.|2006}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular interest in these cases is the fact that the models indicate that the liquid layers are in direct contact with the rocky core, which allows efficient mixing of minerals and salts into the water.

The rover landed on Mars at [[Gale (crater)|Gale Crater]] in August 2012.&lt;ref name="Gale Crater2"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chow |first1=Dennis |title=NASA's Next Mars Rover to Land at Huge Gale Crater |url=http://www.space.com/12394-nasa-mars-rover-landing-site-unveiled.html |date=22 July 2011 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gale Crater3"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Amos |first1=Jonathan |title=Mars rover aims for deep crater |date=22 July 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14249524 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gaia hypothesis]] stipulates that any planet with a robust population of life will have an atmosphere in chemical disequilibrium, which is relatively easy to determine from a distance by [[spectroscopy]]. However, significant advances in the ability to find and resolve light from smaller rocky worlds near their star are necessary before such spectroscopic methods can be used to analyze extrasolar planets. To that effect, the [[Carl Sagan Institute]] was founded in 2014 and is dedicated to the atmospheric characterization of exoplanets in [[circumstellar habitable zone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://instituteforpalebluedots.com/2015/01/what-is-the-institute-for-pale-blue-dots/ |title=Introducing: The Carl Sagan Institute |last=Glaser |first=Linda |date=27 January 2015 |accessdate=11 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227012302/http://instituteforpalebluedots.com/2015/01/what-is-the-institute-for-pale-blue-dots/ |archivedate=27 February 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='CSI-Research'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://instituteforpalebluedots.com/research/ |title=Carl Sagan Institute – Research |date=May 2015 |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planetary spectroscopic data will be obtained  from telescopes like [[Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope|WFIRST]] and [[Extremely Large Telescope|ELT]].&lt;ref name="ColorCatalog"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cofield |first=Calla |url=http://www.space.com/28906-alien-life-earth-microbe-catalog.html |title=Catalog of Earth Microbes Could Help Find Alien Life |work=Space.com |date=30 March 2015 |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, and in a world first, astronomers at [[Copenhagen University]] reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule, [[glycolaldehyde]], in a distant star system. The molecule was found around the [[protostar|protostellar]] binary ''IRAS 16293-2422'', which is located 400 light years from Earth.&lt;ref name="NG-20120829"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sugar Found In Space |journal=National Geographic |last=Than |first=Ker |date=29 August 2012 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/08/120829-sugar-space-planets-science-life/ |accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-20120829"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sweet!

In 1961, [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], [[astronomer]] and [[astrophysicist]]  [[Frank Drake]] devised the [[Drake equation]] as a way to stimulate scientific dialogue at a meeting on the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI).&lt;ref name='December 2002'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.setileague.org/askdr/drake.htm |title=Chapter 3 — Philosophy: "Solving the Drake Equation |accessdate=24 July 2015 |date=December 2002 |publisher=SETI League}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Drake equation is a [[probability theory|probabilistic argument]] used to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the [[Milky Way]]  [[galaxy]]. The equation is best understood not as an equation in the strictly mathematical sense, but to summarize all the various concepts which scientists must contemplate when considering the question of life elsewhere.&lt;ref name='Burchell'&gt;{{cite journal |title=W(h)ither the Drake equation? |last=Burchell |first=M. J. |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=243–250 |date=2006 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=597376&amp;fileId=S1473550406003107 |doi=10.1017/S1473550406003107 |bibcode=2006IJAsB...5..243B}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Drake equation is:
:&lt;math&gt;N = R_{\ast} \cdot f_p \cdot n_e \cdot f_{\ell} \cdot f_i \cdot f_c \cdot L&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:''N'' = the number of Milky Way galaxy [[civilization]]s already capable of communicating across [[interplanetary space]]

and
:''R''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; = the average rate of [[star formation]] in [[Milky Way|our galaxy]]
:''f''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; = the fraction of those stars that have [[planet]]s
:''n''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; = the average number of planets that can potentially support [[life]]
:''f''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; = the fraction of planets that actually support life
:''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = the fraction of planets with life that evolves to become [[intelligence|intelligent]] life (civilizations)
:''f''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology to broadcast detectable signs of their existence into space
:''L'' = the length of time over which such civilizations broadcast detectable signals into space

Drake's proposed estimates are as follows, but numbers on the right side of the equation are agreed as speculative and open to substitution:

&lt;math&gt;10{,}000 = 5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.2 \cdot 1 \cdot 10{,}000&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="NOVA"&gt;{{cite web |last=Aguirre |first=L. |date=1 July 2008 |title=The Drake Equation |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/origins/drake.html |work=[[Nova ScienceNow]] |publisher=[[PBS]] |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Drake equation has proved controversial since several of its factors are uncertain and based on conjecture, not allowing conclusions to be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 6: What does a Martian look like? |title=Evolving the Alien: The Science of Extraterrestrial Life |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=Hoboken, NJ |first1=Jack |last1=Cohen |author1-link=Jack Cohen (scientist) |first2=Ian |last2=Stewart |author2-link=Ian Stewart (mathematician) |date=2002 |isbn=978-0-09-187927-3|title-link=Evolving the Alien: The Science of Extraterrestrial Life }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led critics to label the equation a [[guesstimate]], or even meaningless.

Based on observations from the ''[[Hubble Space Telescope]]'', there are between 125 and 250 billion galaxies in the observable universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/how-many-galaxies/ |title=How many galaxies are there in the universe? |last=Temming |first=M. |work=Sky &amp; Telescope |date=18 July 2014 |accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that at least ten percent of all Sun-like stars have a system of planets,&lt;ref name="marcyprogth05"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=G. |last1=Marcy |first2=R. |last2=Butler |first3=D. |last3=Fischer |display-authors=etal |title=Observed Properties of Exoplanets: Masses, Orbits and Metallicities |journal=Progress of Theoretical Physics Supplement |year=2005 |volume=158 |issue= |pages=24–42 |url=http://ptp.ipap.jp/link?PTPS/158/24 |doi=10.1143/PTPS.158.24 |arxiv=astro-ph/0505003 |bibcode=2005PThPS.158...24M |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002085400/http://ptp.ipap.jp/link?PTPS%2F158%2F24 |archivedate=2 October 2008 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. there are {{val|6.25|e=18}} stars with planets orbiting them in the observable universe. Even if it is assumed that only one out of a billion of these stars has planets supporting life, there would be some 6.25 billion life-supporting planetary systems in the observable universe.

A 2013 study based on results from the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|''Kepler'']] spacecraft estimated that the Milky Way contains at least as many planets as it does stars, resulting in 100–400 billion exoplanets.&lt;ref name="Swift2013"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Characterizing the Cool KOIs.

The apparent contradiction between high estimates of the probability of the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations and the lack of evidence for such civilizations is known as the [[Fermi paradox]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20150803"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=The Flip Side of Optimism About Life on Other Planets |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/science/space/the-flip-side-of-optimism-about-life-on-other-planets.html |date=3 August 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==

===Cosmic pluralism===
{{main article|Cosmic pluralism}}
Cosmic pluralism, the plurality of worlds, or simply pluralism, describes the philosophical belief in numerous "worlds" in addition to Earth, which might harbor extraterrestrial life. Before the development of the [[heliocentric]] theory and a recognition that the Sun is just one of many stars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solar-center.stanford.edu/FAQ/Qsunasstar.html |title=Who discovered that the Sun was a Star? |publisher=Stanford Solar Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; the notion of pluralism was largely [[mythology|mythological]] and philosophical.&lt;ref name=crowe1999&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J4TZPlihVUoC |title=The Extraterrestrial Life Debate, 1750–1900 |first=Michael J. |last=Crowe |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |date=1999 |isbn=978-0-486-40675-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Benjamin D. |last=Wiker |date=4 November 2002 |title=Alien Ideas: Christianity and the Search for Extraterrestrial Life |url=http://www.crisismagazine.com/november2002/feature7.htm |work=Crisis Magazine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030210140752/http://www.crisismagazine.com/november2002/feature7.htm |archivedate=10 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Irwin&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion |first=Robert |last=Irwin |publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Paperbacks]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-86064-983-7 |page=204 &amp; 209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval Muslim writers like [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] and [[Muhammad al-Baqir]] supported cosmic pluralism on the basis of the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name =Weintraub&gt;David A. Weintraub (2014). "Islam," ''Religions and Extraterrestrial Life'' (pp 161-168). Springer International Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[scientific revolution|scientific]] and [[Copernican revolution]]s, and later, during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], cosmic pluralism became a mainstream notion, supported by the likes of [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle]] in his 1686 work ''[[Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds |publisher=University of California Press |first=Bernard le Bovier |last=de Fontenelle |others=trans. H. A. Hargreaves |date=1990 |isbn=978-0-520-91058-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pluralism was also championed by philosophers such as [[John Locke]], [[Giordano Bruno]] and astronomers such as [[William Herschel]]. The astronomer [[Camille Flammarion]] promoted the notion of cosmic pluralism in his 1862 book ''La pluralité des mondes habités''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/F/Flammarion.html |title=Flammarion, (Nicolas) Camille (1842–1925) |publisher=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of these notions of pluralism were based on any specific observation or scientific information.

===Early modern period===
There was a dramatic shift in thinking initiated by the invention of the [[telescope]] and the [[Copernican Revolution|Copernican]] assault on geocentric cosmology. Once it became clear that Earth was merely one planet amongst countless bodies in the universe, the theory of extraterrestrial life started to become a topic in the scientific community. The best known early-modern proponent of such ideas was the Italian philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]], who argued in the 16th century for an infinite universe in which every star is surrounded by its own [[planetary system]]. Bruno wrote that other worlds "have no less virtue nor a nature different to that of our earth" and, like Earth, "contain animals and inhabitants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/brunoiuw0.htm#IUW0III |title=Giordano Bruno: On the Infinite Universe and Worlds (De l'Infinito Universo et Mondi) Introductory Epistle: Argument of the Third Dialogue |publisher= |accessdate=4 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013120648/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/brunoiuw0.htm#IUW0III |archivedate=13 October 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 17th century, the Czech astronomer [[Anton Maria Schyrleus of Rheita]] mused that "if Jupiter has (...) inhabitants (...) they must be larger and more beautiful than the inhabitants of Earth, in proportion to the [characteristics] of the two spheres".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cosmovisions.com/Rheita.htm |publisher=cosmovisions.com |title=Rheita.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Baroque]] literature such as ''The Other World: The Societies and Governments of the Moon'' by [[Cyrano de Bergerac]], extraterrestrial societies are presented as humoristic or ironic parodies of earthly society.
The didactic poet [[Henry More]] took up the classical theme of the Greek [[Democritus]] in "Democritus Platonissans, or an Essay Upon the Infinity of Worlds" (1647).
In "The Creation: a Philosophical Poem in Seven Books" (1712), Sir [[Richard Blackmore]] observed: "We may pronounce each orb sustains a race / Of living things adapted to the place". With the new relative viewpoint that the Copernican revolution had wrought, he suggested "our world's sunne / Becomes a starre elsewhere". [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontanelle]]'s "Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds" (translated into English in 1686) offered similar excursions on the possibility of extraterrestrial life, expanding, rather than denying, the creative sphere of a Maker.

The possibility of extraterrestrials remained a widespread speculation as scientific discovery accelerated. [[William Herschel]], the discoverer of [[Uranus]], was one of many 18th–19th-century astronomers who believed that the [[Solar System]] is populated by alien life. Other luminaries of the period who championed "cosmic pluralism" included [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. At the height of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], even the [[Sun]] and Moon were considered candidates for extraterrestrial inhabitants.

===19th century===
[[File:Lowell Mars channels.jpg|thumb|Artificial Martian channels, depicted by Percival Lowell]]

Speculation about life on Mars increased in the late 19th century, following telescopic observation of apparent [[Martian canals]]—which soon, however, turned out to be optical illusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Experiments as to the actuality of the "Canals" observed on Mars |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |first1=J. E. |last1=Evans |first2=E. W. |last2=Maunder |author2-link=Edward Walter Maunder |volume=63 |issue=8 |pages=488–499 |date=June 1903 |doi=10.1093/mnras/63.8.488 |bibcode=1903MNRAS..63..488E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, in 1895, American astronomer [[Percival Lowell]] published his book ''Mars,'' followed by ''Mars and its Canals'' in 1906, proposing that the canals were the work of a long-gone civilization.&lt;ref name="Wallace1907"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S730.htm |title=Is Mars Habitable? A Critical Examination of Professor Lowell's Book "Mars and Its Canals," With an Alternative Explanation |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |first=Alfred Russel |last=Wallace |date=1907 |oclc=8257449}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of life on Mars led British writer [[H. G. Wells]] to write the novel ''[[The War of the Worlds (novel)|The War of the Worlds]]'' in 1897, telling of an invasion by aliens from Mars who were fleeing the planet's desiccation.

[[Spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] analysis of Mars's atmosphere began in earnest in 1894, when U.S. astronomer [[William Wallace Campbell]] showed that neither water nor oxygen was present in the [[Martian atmosphere]].&lt;ref name="chambers"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Paul |last=Chambers |title=Life on Mars; The Complete Story |place=London |publisher=Blandford |year=1999 |doi= |isbn=978-0-7137-2747-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1909 better telescopes and the best perihelic opposition of Mars since 1877 conclusively put an end to the canal hypothesis.

The [[science fiction]] genre, although not so named during the time, developed during the late 19th century. [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Around the Moon]]'' (1870) features a discussion of the possibility of life on the Moon, but with the conclusion that it is barren.
Stories involving extraterrestrials are found in e.g. [[Garrett P. Serviss]]'s ''[[Edison's Conquest of Mars]]'' (1898), an unauthorized sequel to
''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' by H. G. Wells was published in 1897 which stands at the beginning of the popular idea of the "Martian invasion" of Earth prominent in 20th-century pop culture.

Most [[unidentified flying object]]s or [[List of UFO sightings|UFO sightings]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Anne |last=Cross |title=The Flexibility of Scientific Rhetoric: A Case Study of UFO Researchers |journal=Qualitiative Sociology |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=3–34 |doi=10.1023/B:QUAS.0000015542.28438.41 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be readily explained as sightings of Earth-based aircraft, known [[astronomical object]]s, or as [[hoax]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Philippe |last=Ailleris |date=January–February 2011 |title=The lure of local SETI: Fifty years of field experiments |journal=Acta Astronautica |volume=68 |issue=1–2 |pages=2–15 |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2009.12.011 |bibcode=2011AcAau..68....2A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, a certain fraction of the public believe that UFOs might actually be of extraterrestrial origin, and, indeed, the notion has had influence on popular culture.

The possibility of extraterrestrial life on the Moon was ruled out in the 1960s, and during the 1970s it became clear that most of the other bodies of the Solar System do not harbor highly developed life, although the question of primitive life on bodies in the Solar System remains open.

===Recent history===
The failure so far of the [[SETI]] program to detect an intelligent radio signal after decades of effort has at least partially dimmed the prevailing optimism of the beginning of the space age. Notwithstanding, belief in extraterrestrial beings continues to be voiced in [[pseudoscience]], conspiracy theories, and in popular [[folklore]], notably "[[Sector Four|Area 51]]" and [[Planets proposed in religion and ufology|legends]]. It has become a pop culture trope given less-than-serious treatment in popular entertainment.

In the words of SETI's Frank Drake, "All we know for sure is that the sky is not littered with powerful microwave transmitters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://antarcticaedu.com/bio2024.htm |title=LECTURE 4: MODERN THOUGHTS ON EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE |work=The University of Antarctica |accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drake noted that it is entirely possible that advanced technology results in communication being carried out in some way other than conventional radio transmission. At the same time, the data returned by space probes, and giant strides in detection methods, have allowed science to begin delineating [[Planetary habitability|habitability criteria]] on other worlds, and to confirm that at least other planets are plentiful, though aliens remain a question mark. The [[Wow! signal]], detected in 1977 by a SETI project, remains a subject of speculative debate.

In 2000, [[geologist]] and [[paleontologist]] [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]] and [[Astrobiology|astrobiologist]] [[Donald Brownlee]] published a book entitled ''Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe |publisher=Copernicus |first1=Peter |last1=Ward |first2=Donald |last2=Brownlee |date=2000 |bibcode=2000rewc.book.....W |isbn=978-0-387-98701-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, they discussed the [[Rare Earth hypothesis]], in which they claim that Earth-like life is rare in the [[universe]], whereas [[bacteria|microbial]] life is common. Ward and Brownlee are open to the idea of evolution on other planets that is not based on essential Earth-like characteristics (such as DNA and carbon).

Theoretical physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] in 2010 warned that humans should not try to contact alien life forms. He warned that aliens might pillage Earth for resources. "If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] landed in [[Americas|America]], which didn't turn out well for the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]", he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8642558.stm |work=BBC News |title=Hawking warns over alien beings |date=25 April 2010 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jared Diamond]] had earlier expressed similar concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 12 |title=The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal |publisher=Harper Perennial |first=Jared M. |last=Diamond |date=2006 |isbn=978-0-06-084550-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the [[White House]] released an official response to two petitions asking the [[U.S. government]] to acknowledge formally that aliens have visited Earth and to disclose any intentional withholding of government interactions with extraterrestrial beings. According to the response, "The U.S. government has no evidence that any life exists outside our planet, or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race."&lt;ref name="WhiteHouse"&gt;{{cite web |last=Larson |first=Phil |title=Searching for ET, But No Evidence Yet |url=https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/response/searching-et-no-evidence-yet |date=5 November 2011 |publisher=[[White House]] |accessdate=6 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124052154/https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/Petitions#!/response/searching-et-no-evidence-yet |archivedate=24 November 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkinson"&gt;{{cite web |last=Atkinson |first=Nancy |title=No Alien Visits or UFO Coverups, White House Says |url=http://www.universetoday.com/90717/no-alien-visits-or-ufo-coverups-white-house-says/ |date=5 November 2011 |publisher=[[UniverseToday]] |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to the response, there is "no credible information to suggest that any evidence is being hidden from the public's eye."&lt;ref name="WhiteHouse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkinson"/&gt; The response noted "odds are pretty high" that there may be life on other planets but "the odds of us making contact with any of them—especially any [[Extraterrestrial intelligence|intelligent ones]]—are extremely small, given the distances involved."&lt;ref name="WhiteHouse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkinson"/&gt;

In 2013, the [[exoplanet]] [[Kepler-62f]] was discovered, along with [[Kepler-62e]] and [[Kepler-62c]]. A related [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6132.toc special issue] of the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', published earlier, described the discovery of the exoplanets.&lt;ref name="SCI-20130503"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Special Issue: Exoplanets |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/exoplanets/ |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=3 May 2013 |accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 April 2014, the discovery of the Earth-size exoplanet [[Kepler-186f]], 500 light-years from [[Earth]], was publicly announced;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140417"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Scientists Find an 'Earth Twin', or Maybe a Cousin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/18/science/space/scientists-find-an-earth-twin-or-maybe-a-cousin.html |date=17 April 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the first Earth-size planet to be discovered in the [[habitable zone]] and it has been hypothesized that there may be liquid water on its surface.

On 20 July 2015, British physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] and Russian billionaire [[Yuri Milner]], along with the [[SETI Institute]], announced a well-funded effort, called the [[Breakthrough Initiatives]], to expand efforts to search for extraterrestrial life.  The group contracted the services of the 100-meter Robert C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54866">'''Fluorescent glucose biosensors''' are [[Machine|device]]s that measure the [[concentration]] of [[glucose]] in [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetic patients]] by means of sensitive [[protein]] that relays the concentration by means of [[fluorescence]], an alternative to [[Blood glucose monitoring|amperometric sension of glucose]]. No device has yet entered the medical market,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;No fluorescent biosensor has yet entered the medical market, however, in the market for research tools several fluorescent biosensors are present, such as a [http://www.modernwater.com/monitoring/toxicity/ kit] using [Vibrio fischeri]&lt;/ref&gt; but, due to the prevalence of diabetes, it is the prime drive in the construction of fluorescent biosensors.

==Application==

Keeping glucose levels in check is crucial to minimize the onset of the damage caused by diabetes.&lt;ref name="Trial Research Group"&gt;The effect of intensive treatment of diabetes on the development and progression of long-term complications in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group. N Engl J Med, 1993. 329(14): p. 977-86.&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, in conjunction with insulin administrations, the prime requirement for diabetic patients is to regularly monitor their blood glucose levels.&lt;ref name="Trial Research Group"/&gt; The monitoring systems currently in general use have the drawback of below optimal number of readings, due to their reliance on a drop of fresh blood. Some continuous glucose monitors are commercially available, but suffer from the severe drawback of a short working life of the probe. The majority of these work amperometrically.  As a result, there is an effort to create a sensor that relies on a different mechanism, such as via external infrared spectroscopy or via fluorescent biosensors .&lt;ref name="Pickup05"&gt;Pickup, J.C., et al., Fluorescence-based glucose sensors.

In general, the change seen with  {{Smallcaps|Fret}} competition assays is small (see below).

==Theory of fluorescence==
[[File:Fluorescein spectra.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Absorption and emission spectra of [[fluorescein]]]]
{{main|Fluorescence in the life sciences}}
Fluorescence is a property present in certain molecules, called [[fluorophore]]s, in which they emit a photon shortly after absorbing one with a higher energy wavelength.&lt;ref name="#4"/&gt;

To be more specific, in order for an electron in the outer orbital of a molecule to jump from a ground-state orbital to an excited state orbital, it requires a fixed amount of energy, which, in the case of chromophores (molecules that absorb light), can be acquired by absorbing a photon with an energy equal or slightly higher. This state is short-lived, and the electron returns to the ground-level orbital, losing the energy either as heat or in the case of fluorophores by emitting a photon, which, due to the loss of the difference between the energy of the absorbed photon and the excitation energy required, will have a lower energy than the absorbed photon, or, expressed in terms of wavelength, the emitted photon will have a longer wavelength. The difference between the two wavelengths is called [[Stokes shift|Stokes’ shift]].&lt;ref name="#4"/&gt;

This property can be found in [[quantum dots]], certain [[lanthanides]] and certain [[organic molecules]] with [[delocalized electron]]s.&lt;ref name="#4"/&gt;

These excited molecules have an increase in dipole momentum and in some cases can undergo internal charge rearrangement. When they possess an electron withdrawing group and an electron donating group at opposite ends of the resonance structure, they have a large shift in charge distribution across the molecule, which causes the solvent molecules to reorient to a less energetic arrangement, called solvent relaxation.  By doing so, the energy of the excited state decreases, and the extent of the difference in energy depends on the polarity of the solvent surrounding the molecule.&lt;ref name="#4"/&gt;

An alternative approach is to use solvatochromic dyes,&lt;ref name="pickup08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salins, L.L. 2001. p. 19-26"/&gt; which change their properties (intensity, half-life, and excitation, and emission spectra), depending on the polarity and charge of their environments. Hence, they are sometimes loosely referred to as environmentally sensitive dyes. These can be positioned on specific residues that either change their spatial arrangement due to a conformational change induced by glucose or reside in the glucose-binding pocket whereby the displacement of the water present by glucose decreases the polarity.&lt;ref name="#4"&gt;Lakowicz, J.R., Principles of fluorescence spectroscopy. 3rd ed. 2006, New York: Springer. xxvi, 954 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional property of fluorescence that has found a large usage is [[Förster resonance energy transfer]] ({{Smallcaps|Fret}}) in which the energy of the excited electron of one fluorophore, called the donor, is passed on to a nearby acceptor dye, either a dark-quencher (non-emitting chromophore) or another fluorophore, which has an excitation spectrum that overlaps with the emission spectrum of the donor dye, resulting in a reduced fluorescence.&lt;ref name="#4"/&gt;

For sensing purposes, this property is, in general, used either in combination with a biomolecule, such as a protein, which undergoes a conformational change upon ligand binding, changing the distance between the two labels on this protein, or in a competition assay, in which the analyte has to compete with a known concentration of a fixed labelled ligand for the labelled binding site of protein.  Therefore, the  {{Smallcaps|Fret}} between the binding site and the competing ligand decreases when the analyte concentration is increased. In general, the competing ligand in the case of glucose is [[dextran]], a long glucose polymer attached to the scaffolding or to the enzyme.

{{see also|Förster resonance energy transfer}}
Over the years, using a combination of rational design and screening procedures, many possible typologies of fluorescent sensors for glucose have been created with varying degrees of success. In general, these sensors rely either on  {{Smallcaps|Fret}}&lt;ref name="Schultz93"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schultz05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sato"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Liao"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mcshane04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Birch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanashi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sakaguchi"/&gt; or on sensitivity to polarity changes&lt;ref name="pickup08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salins, L.L. 2001. p. 19-26"/&gt; to translate the glucose concentration into fluorescent intensity.

These sensors contain, in addition to the fluorophore(s), a molecule that confers glucose specificity, in general, a protein. A variety of proteins have been used for this purpose, often with different labs concentrating on one particular protein.

The first glucose biosensor reported in the literature was made in 1982 by Schultz’group using a  {{Smallcaps|Fret}} competition assay between glucose and a labelled glucose polymer for the binding site of Concanavalin A entrapped in a hollow dialysis fibre.&lt;ref name="Schultz, J.S. 1982. p. 245-53"/&gt; As a result, Con A was widely used in subsequent sensors in several labs,&lt;ref name="Schultz93"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schultz05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sato"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Liao"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNichols06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Birch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#15"&gt;Russell, R.J., et al., A fluorescence-based glucose biosensor using concanavalin A and dextran encapsulated in a poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel. Anal Chem, 1999. 71(15): p. 3126-32.&lt;/ref&gt; however Con A suffers from the downside of high toxicity and low reversibility. As a result, other glucose-binding proteins were and are explored by several labs.

In Biotex Inc., (Houston) McNichols and Ballastardt have created a dialysis fibre-enclosed ConA {{Smallcaps|Fret}} sensor, which has undergone testing in animal models for several years.&lt;ref name="McNichols06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#17"&gt;Dutt-Ballerstadt, R., et al., Preclinical in vivo study of a fluorescence affinity sensor for short-term continuous glucose monitoring in a small and large animal model. Diabetes Technol Ther, 2008. 10(6): p. 453-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amperometric biosensors, in contrast, can utilise only glucose oxidase as a protein, as it is a redox enzyme. This protein has also been used in fluorescent sensing either simply as an apoenzyme or as a holoenzyme. An exception to this group of sensors is the Biocapacitor A Sode’s group, which relies on glucose dehydrogenase instead.&lt;ref name="Hanashi"/&gt;

The activity of glucose oxidase has also been used to make lifetime-based fluorescent/phosphorescent sensor, taking advantage of the fact that the protein oxidises glucose utilizing molecular oxygen and that oxygen quenches the fluorescence of ruthenium: This was done by Uwira and colleagues in 1984&lt;ref name="Uwira, N. 1984. p. 913-921"/&gt; and followed by several groups.&lt;ref name="#20"&gt;Trettnak, W., M.J.P. Leiner, and O.S. Wolfbeis, OPTICAL SENSORS .34. FIBER OPTIC GLUCOSE BIOSENSOR WITH AN OXYGEN OPTRODE AS THE TRANSDUCER.

Kopelman, Analytical properties and sensor size effects of a micrometer-sized optical fiber glucose biosensor.

Voet, et al., Editors. 2005, Spie-Int Soc Optical Engineering: Bellingham. p. 431-434.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="#24"&gt;Endo, H., et al., A needle-type optical enzyme sensor system for determining glucose levels in fish blood.

Anal Bioanal Chem, 2006. 386(5): p. 1293-302.&lt;/ref&gt;

To be specific,&lt;ref name="#24"/&gt; and&lt;ref name="#25"/&gt; have used this GOx-based oxygen-quenching assay to make a fibre-based sensor, whilst McShane uses GOx-based oxygen-quenching assay in microsphere made with the aim of subcutaneous injection in order to create what the group has coined “smart tattoo”, a sensor operating non-invasively by reporting across the skin, taking advantage of the fact the skin is permeable to near-infrared light. In addition, this group has created several {{Smallcaps|Fret}} completion assays, a first using ConA (TRITC-Con A /FITC-dextran (500kDa)),&lt;ref name="#15"/&gt; but then switching to GOx apoenzyme in 2004 (TRITC-apo-GOx /FITC-dextran (500kDa))&lt;ref name="Mcshane04"/&gt; and testing in 2009 sensors (QSY-21-apo-GOx /Alexa647- dextran) in microspheres.&lt;ref name="#26"&gt;Chaudhary, A., et al., Evaluation of glucose-sensitive affinity-binding assay entrapped in fluorescent-dissolved core alginate microspheres. Biotechnol Bioeng, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Several other groups have constructed smart tattoos and are review below.&lt;ref name="#27"&gt;Stein, E.W., et al., Microscale enzymatic optical biosensors using mass transport-limiting nanofilms. 1. Fabrication and characterization using glucose as a model analyte. Anal Chem, 2007. 79(4): p. 1339-48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="#28"&gt;Stein, E.W., S. Singh, and M.J. McShane, Microscale enzymatic optical biosensors using mass transport limiting nanofilms. 2. Response modulation by varying analyte transport properties. Anal Chem, 2008. 80(5): p. 1408-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

One particular GOx oxygen ruthenium-quenching assay worth mentioning was used in a study in Ingo Klimant's group, in which it was used in a fully functional sensor to measure glucose levels in a healthy volunteer.  The sensor was constructed by functionalizing an oxygen sensor with glucose oxidase and inserting it into the external part of a catheter used for monitoring.&lt;ref name="#25"/&gt;

Apoenzymes can still bind glucose but, due to the lack of cofactors (in vitro), cannot catalyse their reaction so are less likely to get damaged.

Other proteins that have been used are glucokinase from a thermophile in D’auria group&lt;ref name="Pickup05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#30"&gt;D'Auria, S., et al., A novel fluorescence competitive assay for glucose determinations by using a thermostable glucokinase from the thermophilic microorganism Bacillus stearothermophilus. Anal Biochem, 2002. 303(2): p. 138-44.&lt;/ref&gt; and glucose-galactose-binding protein ({{Smallcaps|Ggbp}}), which is not an enzyme but a periplasmic protein involved in chemotaxis that undergoes a large conformational change.

The majority of the fluorophores used for the sensors are small molecules, although some sensors have been made using quantum dots or fluorescent protein.

Sensors have been made using QD as  {{Smallcaps|Fret}} donors and a small molecule or gold nanoparticle (dark quencher) as acceptors. An example of the former, is Loeb’s sensil, an optic fibre system in which the quantum dot is attached to ConA whilst tetramethylrhodamine is attached to cyclodextran, which in turn is attached to the PEG diacrylate scaffold.&lt;ref name="Liao"/&gt; An example of the latter is Tang with QDs-ConA-beta-CDs-AuNPs.&lt;ref name="#31"&gt;Tang, B., et al., A new nanobiosensor for glucose with high sensitivity and selectivity in serum based on fluorescence resonance Energy transfer (FRET) between CdTe quantum dots and Au nanoparticles. Chemistry, 2008. 14(12): p. 3637-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluorescent protein can be made into a fusion protein with a desired protein, circumventing the labelling steps. Shultz made a  {{Smallcaps|Ggbp}} molecule with two GFP at each end. In theory, it is possible to improve this by doing a directed in vitro evolution using FACS, but it has not been reported in the literature, which is not easily done by labelling although a screening has been attamped by Pitner.&lt;ref name="#32"&gt;Amiss, T.J., et al., Engineering and rapid selection of a low-affinity glucose/galactose-binding protein for a glucose biosensor. Protein Sci, 2007. 16(11): p. 2350-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluorescence is not the only type of luminescence achievable in biological systems: Chemiluminescence, the generation of light by means of chemical reactions, is produced by some protein, such as Aqueorin from symbiont in jellyfish and luciferase from symbiont in fireflies. These have been used to make glucose sensors: Daunert makes a {{Smallcaps|Ggbp}}-split [[Aqueorin]] sensor&lt;ref name="Daunert08"/&gt; and Koji Sode in 2009 made  {{Smallcaps|Ggbp}}-luciferase with Asp459Asn (Glc not Gal).&lt;ref name="#34"&gt;Taneoka, A., et al., The construction of a glucose-sensing luciferase.

In addition to small-molecule dyes, fluorescent proteins have been used: One group made a near-infrared (NIR) {{Smallcaps|Fret}} sensor detected by means of [[Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy|time-resolved]]/nanotomography allophycocyanin-ConA/malachite green-Dextran,&lt;ref name="Birch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#35"&gt;Rolinski, O.J., et al., A time-resolved near-infrared fluorescence assay for glucose: opportunities for trans-dermal sensing.

Biochim Biophys Acta, 2004. 1657(2-3): p. 73-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to protein as the glucose-binding moiety, [[boronic acid]] functionalized molecules have been used: Boronic acid in fact binds to vicinal groups, preferably hydroxyl; therefore, it has a high affinity for carbohydrates.&lt;ref name="#41"&gt;Lorand, J.P. and J.O. Edwards, POLYOL COMPLEXES AND STRUCTURE OF THE BENZENEBORONATE ION. Journal of Organic Chemistry, 1959. 24(6): p. 769-774.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the boronic acid group for the recognition of saccharide has been widely studied by Shinkai, [[Tony James (chemist)|James]] and their collaborators&lt;ref&gt;Samankumara Sandanayake, K. R. A., James, T. D., and Shinkai, S. (1996) Pure Appl. Chem. 68(6), 1207–1212.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James, T. D., Samankumara Sandanayake, K. R. A., and Shinkai, S. (1996) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

To take advantage of this several approaches have been taken.

One approach is by {{Smallcaps|Fret}} quenching, in which the system can work through the modulation of the quenching of a dye by a boronic acid functionalized viologen.&lt;ref name="#42"&gt;Gamsey, S., et al., Continuous glucose detection using boronic acid-substituted viologens in fluorescent hydrogels: linker effects and extension to fiber optics. Langmuir, 2006. 22(21): p. 9067-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative approach is by photo-induced electron transfer (PET), a mechanism of fluorescence-quenching due to the electron-rich tertiary amino group near the fluorophore, which is affected by the change in charge of the nearby boronate group when glucose is bound. This has been used in combination with lifetime by one group.&lt;ref name="#43"&gt;DiCesare, N. and J.R. Lakowicz, Evaluation of two synthetic glucose probes for fluorescence-lifetime-based sensing.

Chemistry, 2008. 14(9): p. 2795-804.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only in fluorescence but as NMR agent for imaging with a [[Europium|Europium (3+)]] boronic acid dye.&lt;ref name="#45"&gt;Ren, J., et al., Imaging the tissue distribution of glucose in livers using a PARACEST sensor. Magn Reson Med, 2008. 60(5): p. 1047-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environment sensing dyes==
[[File:Badan.svg|thumb|350px|Example of an environmentally sensitive dye, [http://products.invitrogen.com/ivgn/product/B6057 Badan], which having a tertiary amine and a ketone at opposite ends displays a large change in dipole momentum when exited (including an internal charge transfer), which results in turn in a significant lowering of the energy when solvent relaxation occurs]]
{{see also|Fluorescence in the life sciences#Sensitivity to Environment}}
The majority of the sensors adopting environmentally sensitive dyes have utilized  {{Smallcaps|Ggbp}}, transport protein that binds to D-glucose and D-galactose and transports them to the membrane-bound Trg receptor triggering the chemotaxis of the bacterium towards that glucose source.&lt;ref name="#46"&gt;Vyas, N.K., M.N. Vyas, and F.A. Quiocho, A novel calcium-binding site in the galactose-binding protein of bacterial transport and chemotaxis.

Gordon, Transport properties of the galactose-binding protein of Escherichia coli. Occurrence of two conformational states.

Kiessling, and K.T. Forest, Conformational changes of glucose/galactose-binding protein illuminated by open, unliganded, and ultra-high-resolution ligand-bound structures.

Quiocho, Sugar and signal-transducer binding sites of the Escherichia coli galactose chemoreceptor protein.

Clin Chem, 2002. 48(3): p. 436-72.&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, several studies have been done to lower the affinity of  {{Smallcaps|Ggbp}}, which otherwise would result in near-saturation of  {{Smallcaps|Ggbp}} throughout the pathophysiological glucose concentrations. The binding affinity of  {{Smallcaps|Ggbp}} changes when it is labelled endosterically or peristerically, so several mutants that work at range close to pathophysiological glucose have been created.

{{Smallcaps|Ggbp}} contains five tryptophan residues, two of which, W183 in the binding site and W284 in the N terminal domain (which can bind calcium), affect the autofluorescence spectra upon glucose binding.&lt;ref name="#52"&gt;D'Auria, S., et al., Tryptophan phosphorescence studies of the D-galactose/D-glucose-binding protein from Escherichia coli provide a molecular portrait with structural and dynamics features of the protein. J Proteome Res, 2007. 6(4): p. 1306-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies with G {{Smallcaps|Ggbp}} and solvatochromic dyes not to create a sensor, but to elucidate the chemistry behind the conformational change of  {{Smallcaps|Ggbp}}. Examples of this include a study utilizing L255C with acrylodan and  Ruthenium at the at N-terminus revealing three conformational states closed and twisted,&lt;ref name="#48"/&gt; the fluorescence and phosphorescence of the tryptophan W183 under normal conditions [52], under high pressure&lt;ref name="#53"&gt;Marabotti, A., et al., Pressure affects the structure and the dynamics of the D-galactose/D-glucose-binding protein from Escherichia coli by perturbing the C-terminal domain of the protein. Biochemistry, 2006. 45(39): p. 11885-94.&lt;/ref&gt; and with or without calcium.&lt;ref name="#54"&gt;D'Auria, S., et al., Binding of glucose to the D-galactose/D-glucose-binding protein from Escherichia coli restores the native protein secondary structure and thermostability that are lost upon calcium depletion. J Biochem, 2006. 139(2): p. 213-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sode and friends made a series of mutants of  {{Smallcaps|Ggbp}} to increase the Kd in the unlabelled form near physiological range (Phe16Ala) and remove Galactose specificity (Asp14Glu).&lt;ref name="Sakaguchi"/&gt;

The response of an environment sensitive dye attached to a specific residue of  {{Smallcaps|Ggbp}} depends not only on the labelling site, which has a certain environment, but also on the nature of the dye, which interacts differently depending on its geometry. The interaction between a given dye and its environment is hard to predict in silico. As a result, in order to obtain a working sensor, several independent studies have screened a set of environmentally sensitive dyes attached to several possible sites in the binding pocket, (endosteric site), near it (peristeric site) or away from it (allosteric site).&lt;ref name="#55"&gt;Tian, Y., et al., Structure-based design of robust glucose biosensors using a Thermotoga maritima periplasmic glucose-binding protein. Protein Sci, 2007. 16(10): p. 2240-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

One advantage of  {{Smallcaps|Ggbp}} is that in the wild-type there are no cysteine residues, making the introduction of this residue in a specific location ideal for labelling.

A team led by Homme Hellinga&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Despite the controversy surrounding Homme Hellinga [http://writedit.wordpress.com/2009/10/13/hellinga-controversy-expands/] these results are not under investigation&lt;/ref&gt; conducted two large screens, in the first (2002) they made of a series (320 constructs) of labelled mutants of 11 bacterial periplasmic binding protein including  {{Smallcaps|Ggbp}} for which they made 9 mutants introducing a cysteine in a specific spot (Y10C, N15C, E93C, E149C, H152C, W183C, L255C, D257C, V296C) and tested the response when labelled with one out of 8 dyes (pyrene (340, 390); acrylodan (390, 500); fluorescein (485, 520); NBD (490, 540); NBDE (490, 530); JPW4039 (485, 590); JPW4042 (470, 640); and JPW4045 (470, 640)). Out of the 72 combinations made, {{Smallcaps|Ggbp}} labelled with Acrylodan in position W183C had a 5 fold change and kd=5mM.&lt;ref name="#56"&gt;de Lorimier, R.M., et al., Construction of a fluorescent biosensor family. Protein Sci, 2002. 11(11): p. 2655-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a subsequent study (2007), using the heat-stable  {{Smallcaps|Ggbp}} from Thermotoga maritima they screened 5 mutants (Y13C, W14C, Y189C, S131C and M239C) with 4 dyes ({{Smallcaps|Ianbd}}, {{Smallcaps|Acrylodan}}, Cy5 and Cy3) identifying Y13C-Cy5 conjugate, which gave a maximal increase of 50% and affinity at 15mM.&lt;ref name="#55"/&gt;

A different study was conducted by a group led by Professor Sylvia Daunert using 3 endosteric mutants (G148C, H152C and M182C) in combination with 4 dyes (acrylodan, 1,5-[[IAEDANS]], MDCC and {{Smallcaps|Ianbd}} ester) identifying M182C –MDCC, which gave a 30% change in fluorescence.&lt;ref name="Salins, L.L. 2001. p. 19-26"/&gt; 
A radically alternative approach was taken by Pitner in BD, who used a single dye ({{Smallcaps|Ianbd}}) attached to E149C as a starting point for a directed evolution screen, in which a mutant library is created and selected for “winners”, namely mutants that meet the selection criteria, with this approach they identified E149C/A213R/L238S with kd of 10mM and an eightfold increase in fluorescence,&lt;ref name="#32"/&gt; this mutant was later used for SPR.&lt;ref name="#57"&gt;Hsieh, H.V., et al., Direct detection of glucose by surface plasmon resonance with bacterial glucose/galactose-binding protein. Biosens Bioelectron, 2004. 19(7): p. 653-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, independently{{#tag:ref|Despite the same mutant being present, the paper&lt;ref name="pickup08"/&gt; does not cite&lt;ref name="#57"/&gt; but obtained the mutant by investigating the secondary structure.|group="nb"}} another group (J Pickup) tested 2 mutants (H152C and M182C) labelled with {{Smallcaps|Badan}} (6-bromoacetyl-2-dimethylaminonaphtalene), bound to the thiol group of the cisteine introduced at the site 152 (H152C mutant) showed a threefold increase (200% change) upon saturating glucose binding, making it an ideal candidate for a sensor. Later work, adopting the mutations identified by Pitner (above),&lt;ref name="#32"/&gt; generated a  {{Smallcaps|Badan}}-labelled  {{Smallcaps|Ggbp}} mutant (H152C/A213R/L238S), with a dissociation constant in the human physiological glucose range (Km=11mM) and a twofold increase in fluorescence (100% change).

==Tissue autofluorescence==
Another pair of papers suggest that the natural fluorescence (autofluorescence) of tissues may be harnessed to track glucose concentrations. These studies took advantage of the fact that [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NAD(P)H]], in its reduced form, is autofluorescent, and that metabolites such as glucose cause a predictable increase in [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NAD(P)H]] reduction.&lt;ref name="#39"&gt;Evans, N.D., et al., Non-invasive glucose monitoring by NAD(P)H autofluorescence spectroscopy in fibroblasts and adipocytes: a model for skin glucose sensing. Diabetes Technol Ther, 2003. 5(5): p. 807-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="#40"&gt;Evans, N.D., et al., Glucose-dependent changes in NAD(P)H-related fluorescence lifetime of adipocytes and fibroblasts in vitro: potential for non-invasive glucose sensing in diabetes mellitus. J Photochem Photobiol B, 2005. 80(2): p. 122-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sensing ''in vivo''==
An alternative way of measuring the change in environment of environmental dyes is their change in lifetime, which may give better results in some sensors, using lanthanides or e.g. the aforementioned  ruthenium (Ru) metal-ligand complex, either with GOx or as an  {{Smallcaps|Fret}} acceptor of an environment sensitive dye as in the case of ANS26- {{Smallcaps|Ggbp}} in a ruthenium-coated cuvette that shows little increase in intensity but a substantial change in lifetime.&lt;ref name="#59"&gt;Tolosa, L., et al., Glucose sensor for low-cost lifetime-based sensing using a genetically engineered protein. Anal Biochem, 1999. 267(1): p. 114-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the fluorescent protein is only one subsystem of a clinically viable monitoring device: the sensing protein has to be immobilized and its fluorescence has to be read by a detecting subsystem that, in turn, informs the user.

In the ideal situation, the detector could be implanted with the immobilized protein and queried by radio frequency, however this has currently been achieved only with amperormetric sensors.&lt;ref name="#60"&gt;Yang, Y.L., et al., A miniaturized glucose biosensor for in vitro and in vivo studies. Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc, 2008. 2008: p. 3162-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The general approach for fluorescent sensors is to attach the protein to one extremity of an optic fibre implanted under the skin whilst the other extremity is connected to the detection subsystem, which includes a path splitter (sliced fibre or dichroic mirror) to allow the fibre to transmit both the excitation and the emitted light, a filtered light source (in general, a laser), and a filtered photodetector (a CCD or a PMT). The information thus collected is then analysed with a computer.&lt;ref name="Liao"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#4"/&gt;

==Smart tattoo==
The skin is permeable to near-infrared light (NIR). As a consequence, near-infrared dyes can be measured across the skin without the need of an optic fibre, which has been termed “smart tattoo” by McShane who created a near-infrared oxygen quenching assay contained in microspheres.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

However, there is a limited amount of commercially available fluorescent dyes, with only a limited amount of environmentally sensitive dyes, such as cyanine cy7.  As a consequence, Pitner made a reactive Nile red dye,&lt;ref name="#61"&gt;Sherman, D.B., et al., Synthesis of thiol-reactive, long-wavelength fluorescent phenoxazine derivatives for biosensor applications. Bioconjug Chem, 2006. 17(2): p. 387-92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="#62"&gt;Thomas, K.J., et al., A long-wavelength fluorescent glucose biosensor based on bioconjugates of galactose/glucose-binding protein and Nile Red derivatives. Diabetes Technol Ther, 2006. 8(3): p. 261-8.&lt;/ref&gt; but to date no study with a Nile red- {{Smallcaps|Ggbp}} sensor has been conducted.

Nevertheless, several studies with NIR dyes have been done, Prof. Pickup with Dr David Birch made a NIR {{Smallcaps|Fret}} sensor measuring both the time-resolved counts or by nanotomography of allophycocyanin-ConA/malachite green-Dextran,&lt;ref name="Birch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#35"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#36"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#37"/&gt; where allophycocyanin is a NIR fluorescent protein.&lt;ref name="#38"/&gt; In an other study, the autofluorescence of NAPH, an energy carrier in cells was assessed as an indirect indicator.&lt;ref name="#39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#40"/&gt;

A group at BioTex Inc, led by McNichols and Ballerstadt, have created a NIR {{Smallcaps|Fret}} sensor-based on ConA with NIR dyes Alexa 647 and Alexa 750 (originally Alexa 647 &amp; cy7) enclosed in a dialysis fibre attached to the end of an optic fibre, which they have dubbed “FAS” (fluorescent) to improve the stability they attach the protein to a sephadex, a macroporous hydrogel. Despite the change in {{Smallcaps|Fret}} of only 35% across the pathophysiological range (possibly 40% maximum change form no glucose to saturation), the sensor has been shown to decrease in functionality by only 20%  after 450 days incubation at 37&amp;nbsp;°C and to monitor glucose as well as the Medtronic/Minimed CGMS sensor in animal models (mouse, pig, and dog), however their stated aim is to create a smart tattoo.&lt;ref name="McNichols06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#18"&gt;Ballerstadt, R., et al., Fiber-coupled fluorescence affinity sensor for 3-day in vivo glucose sensing. J Diabetes Sci Technol, 2007. 1(3): p. 384-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="#16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#17"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biotexmedical.com/research.html#glucose |title=BioTex, Inc. - Research &amp; Development |publisher=Biotexmedical.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another company that is developing a smart tattoo is the Draper Laboratory, who are currently testing on animals, however the performance and the identity of the sensor has not been revealed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.draper.com/nanosensor/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612042915/http://www.draper.com/nanosensor/index.html |date=June 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Encapsulation in dialysis membranes==
Despite the higher benefit of smart tattoos compared to a transdermal optic fibre, no in vivo smart tattoo has yet been demonstrated, whereas fibre-based systems have been shown to be potential sensors.&lt;ref name="Liao"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#42"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#63"&gt;Han, H., et al., Clinical determination of glucose in human serum by a tomato skin biosensor.

Stokke, Glucose sensors based on a responsive gel incorporated as a Fabry-Perot cavity on a fiber-optic readout platform. Biosens Bioelectron, 2009. 24(7): p. 2034-9.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--THE FOLLOWING IS CORRECT BUT CANNOT FIND REFERENCE.... As with smart tattoos, there are some companies attempting to deliver a fibre based glcusoe sensor, including a group at BD bioscience in collaboration with Profil Institute for clinical research has made an optic fibre based on  {{Smallcaps|Ggbp}} entrapped in a hydogel{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}.--&gt;

The majority of the sensors mentioned in the previous sections consisted of labelled proteins in solution. The only sensors to progress towards an implantable sensor have been either GOx–ruthenium oxygen-quenching assay sensors or  {{Smallcaps|Fret}} competition assay sensors; to date, no environment sensitive dye-based sensors attached at the end of a fibre has been published.

For fibre-based biosensors to work, the protein must be immobilized to the fibre that can either entrapped in a hollow tube made of dialysis membrane&lt;ref name="#18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#16"&gt;Ballerstadt, R., A. Gowda, and R. McNichols, Fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based near-infrared fluorescence sensor for glucose monitoring. Diabetes Technol Ther, 2004. 6(2): p. 191-200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="#17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#63"/&gt; or entrapped in a hydrogel.&lt;ref name="Liao"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#42"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#64"/&gt;

A hollow dialysis tube is a tube with sub-millimetre diameter whose walls are composed of porous crosslinked cellulose designed to allow small solutes through but not large biomolecules, such as protein with a cut-off ranging from 0.5-20 kDa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectrumlabs.com/dialysis/InVivo.html |title=in vivo MicroDialysis Hollow Fibers |publisher=Spectrumlabs.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a consequence, they are well suited for sensory applications, where the analyte is free to diffuse across whilst proteins cannot, both the sensor protein inside and the blood/interstitial tissue proteases. In fact, the Menarini Diagnostics’ GlucoDay sensor has an improved lifetime because the injected probe uses a dialysis membrane, although it should be note that to drastically increase the diffusion rate it is coupled with a pump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.menarinidiag.co.uk/Products/continuous_glucose_monitoring/system_description |title=System Description / Continuous Glucose Monitoring / Products / UK - Menarini Diagnostics |publisher=Menarinidiag.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Encapsulation in a hydrogel==
{{see also|hydrogel}}
Regarding its application in fluorescent sensing of glucose, the first glucose biosensor by fluorescence, which, as mentioned, was made in 1982 by means of a {{Smallcaps|Fret}} competition assay for the binding site of ConA, was entrapped in a sealed microdialysis tube,&lt;ref name="Schultz, J.S. 1982. p. 245-53"/&gt; in the same lab, namely of J Schultz, in 2001 another study was published using microdialysis fibres using a {{Smallcaps|Fret}} ConA sensor but with different labels and using sephadex instead of dextran (the former being several orders of magnitude larger).&lt;ref name="Schultz05"/&gt; After, Dr. Ballastardt joined BioTex as a senior scientist under Dr Roger McNichols, the chief scientist, where for the past seven years they have been testing the previously mentioned FAS sensor, which used the same {{Smallcaps|Fret}} system in a dialysis tube.&lt;ref name="McNichols06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#17"/&gt; To be specific, the labelled protein was loaded with a P10 tip into a dialysis tube 200&amp;nbsp;µm wide that had been sealed with cyanoacrylate (superglue) at one end with or without an optic fibre end inserted inside.

In the field of sensors of analytes, glucose sensors have been at the forefront due to the large amount of research into glucose sensors as a result of the prevalence of diabetes,&lt;ref name="#4"/&gt; nevertheless, a wide breadth of optic fibre-based biosensors, mainly using enzymes, immunoassays, nucleic acids,  whole cells or biomimetic materials and relying on different detection methods (fluorescence, absorbance, chemiluminescence, and scattering), and attachment methods (coating, hydrogels, or membranes).&lt;ref name="#65"&gt;Monk, D.J. and D.R.

The majority of these sensors, however, rely on entrapping the protein in hydrogels, as these are more sturdy and  protect the protein more than a simple coating or membrane. A hydrogel is a porous crosslinked polymer matrix filled with water. Several types of hydrogel exist and have been used to entrap small molecules such as dyes,&lt;ref name="#71"&gt;Andreou, V.G. and Y.D.

In physically entrapping gels, the protein has to be added when the gel is crosslinked, so the conditions used must not damage the protein, excluding the hydrogel, which requires non-aqueous solvents or harsh chemicals,&lt;ref name="#75"&gt;Gupta, R. and N.K.

Biosens Bioelectron, 2007. 22(11): p. 2387-99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="#76"&gt;Hamidi, M., A. Azadi, and P. Rafiei, Hydrogel nanoparticles in drug delivery. Adv Drug Deliv Rev, 2008. 60(15): p. 1638-49.&lt;/ref&gt; an example being TEMED-persulphate-catalysed (peroxide radical initiation) acrylamide or acrylate, which is used for SDS PAGE but for not protein encapsulation.

Hydrogels have been extensively studied, mainly in the entrapment of small molecules for drug delivery, including cases where the hydrogel nanoparticles slowly release the drug to a targeted site. Hydrogels can be classified  according to their polymers constituents, which can be natural (Hyaluronan, alginic acid, pectin, {{not a typo|carrageenan}}, chondroitin sulfate, dextran and dextran  sulphate, chitosan, polylysine,  collagen, carboxymethyl chitin, fibrin, agarose, pullulan), or synthetic ([[Polyethylene glycol|PEG]], PLA, PLGA, PCL, PHB, [[Polyvinyl alcohol|PVA]], PNVP, P(HEMA), p(biscarboxy-phenoxy-phosphazene), p(GEMA-sulfate), and others), or a hybrid of the two. In addition to organic hydrogels there are sol-gels, which are oxygen-bridged silicates (or titanium oxide), that polymerise in water.&lt;ref name="#75"/&gt; An additional classification can be by method of polymerization, which can be physical (freezing or heating) or chemical (γ-ray, oxygen or photo-induced [[radical polymerization]] in the case of acrylates, vinyls and acrylamides).&lt;ref name="#76"/&gt;

All the various hydrogels have different advantages and disadvantage, such as biocompatibility, protein stability, toxicity, or lifetime; for example, the gelling conditions for sol-gels may damage the protein, and, as a result, several copolymers, such as chitosan, may be added (making hybrid gels)&lt;ref name="#77"&gt;Wang, G.H. and L.M. Zhang, Using novel polysaccharide-silica hybrid material to construct an amperometric biosensor for hydrogen peroxide. J Phys Chem B, 2006. 110(49): p. 24864-8.&lt;/ref&gt; or alternative monomers, such as glycol-modified tetraethoxysilane as it is more biocompatible than the commonly used methoxy- or ethoxy-modified tetraethoxysilane.&lt;ref name="#78"&gt;Wang, G.H. and L.M. Zhang, A Biofriendly Silica Gel for in Situ Protein Entrapment: Biopolymer-Assisted Formation and Its Kinetic Mechanism. J Phys Chem B, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fibers with hydrogel==
{{see also|biosensor}}
Regarding fibre-optic-based biosensors, several hydrogels have been used but mainly acrylate-based polymers and sol-gels, either by chemical or physical entrapment. In the case of acetylcholinesterase, the target of many pesticides, a sensors has been made chemically linking the enzyme to an acrylate hydrogel&lt;ref name="#79"&gt;Issberner, J.P., et al., Combined imaging and chemical sensing of L-glutamate release from the foregut plexus of the lepidopteran, Manduca sexta. J Neurosci Methods, 2002. 120(1): p. 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; or physically entrapping the enzyme in solgel.&lt;ref name="#71"/&gt;

An optic-fibre-based hydrogel-entrapped biosensor for glucose was made in the lab of Loeb (Liao and colleagues) and was named  Sencil. this sensor was composed of a photocrosslinked diacrylate-modified PEG hydrogel containing the tetra-rhodamine (TRITC), labelled  {{Smallcaps|Fret}} competitor betacyclodextrin and the quantum dot-labelled apoenzyme Concanavalin A. This sensor was tested only in vitro for functionality; however, some tests were done to see the compatibility of the fibre implanted transdermally in mice. In particular, the inflammation was monitored and the energy required to remove it by force was measured proving that the collagen-coated fibre required more force than to remove a hair, which has the same diameter (200µl).&lt;ref name="Liao"/&gt;

Another fibre-based sensor was done in  Singaram lab (santa Cruz). This used a 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate hydrogel as a scaffold onto which two dyes were attached one a fluorescent anionic dye and a cationic quencher (to be specific, a viologen) functionalized with boronic acid, which assumes a negative charge when bound to glucose, making the net charge of the molecule neutral and less attracted to the fluorophore, hence modulating its intensity based on glucose concentration.&lt;ref name="#42"/&gt;&lt;ref name="#80"&gt;Thoniyot, P., et al., Continuous glucose sensing with fluorescent thin-film hydrogels. 2. Fiber optic sensor fabrication and in vitro testing. Diabetes Technol Ther, 2006. 8(3): p. 279-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of hydrogels are attached to the fibre, one exception being the fibre optic-based sensor made by Itsubayashi’s group to measure glucose in fish (health indicator), which used a dialysis membrane as the support for the hydrogel. To be more specific, it relied on a GOx oxygen-ruthenium quenching assay where the protein was mixed with AWP (azide-functionalized polyvinyl alchool, a photocrosslinkable polymer) and cross-linked to a dialysis membrane that was rolled around a premade ruthenium oxygen probe (ocean optics) and inserted into an 18-gauge needle with eight holes on the side  (akin to a recorder).&lt;ref name="#24"/&gt; In such a set-up, the integrity of the protein has no effect on the sensor, unless below a certain concentration. As a consequence, the destruction or inaccessibility of a fraction of the protein is not problematic, which is in contrast to  {{Smallcaps|Fret}} or environmentally sensitive sensing. However, the response speed of this sensor is slow and requires a mathematical prediction to be applied to the measurement.

An alternative use of boronic acid in hydrogels is seen in Stokke in Norway where the swelling of a boronate functionalized acrylamide gel due to charge change upon glucose binding is measured by a Fabry–Pérot interferometer on the other end of the fibre (note that this a different method than fluorescence and relies on scattering).&lt;ref name="#64"/&gt;

An exception to the usage of placing the optic fibre transdermally is seen in the previously mentioned fibre from Ingo Klimant's group (ruthenium-quenching by oxygen released by glucose-catalysed GOx): The sensor, in fact, was constructed by functionalizing a premade oxygen sensor with Glucose oxydase and inserting it into a glucose-sensing apparatus for amperometric sensors, in particular, a microdialysis catheter CMA 60 implanted transdermally and the sensor connected to its tygon tubing. This sensor was tested in a human volunteer and showed results par with current amperometric systems.&lt;ref name="#25"/&gt; The usage of a fibre was dictated by the pre-availability of this compared to a ruthenium-coated lens, which would have had achieved the same results, so this approach should be put in a category of its own alongside transdermal fibres and smart tattoos. However, the aim of the group is to create glucose-sensitive nanoparticles to be interrogated with a transdermal optic fibre and controlled magnetically.  As a consequence, the group is improving the oxygen sensing probe by investigating novel oxygen sensitive phosphorescent materials,&lt;ref name="#81"&gt;Borisov, S.M. and I.

The direct-ascent rendezvous and docking with the Agena vehicle was achieved approximately 94 minutes after lift-off, depending on the on-board computer and radar equipment with only minimal assistance from ground support.&lt;ref name=Gatland/&gt;

Gemini 11 used the rocket on its Agena target vehicle to raise its apogee to {{convert|853|mi|km}}, the highest Earth orbit ever reached by a manned spacecraft.&lt;ref name="agle199809"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Agle |first=D. C. |date=September 1998 |title=Flying the Gusmobile |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/flying-the-gusmobile-218187/?all |magazine=Air &amp; Space |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perigee was {{convert|179|mi|km}}, and maximum velocity (at perigee) was {{convert|17967|mph|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=Gatland/&gt; The apogee record stands as of Oct 2018, even though men have achieved greater distances from Earth by flying to the Moon in the [[Apollo program]].&lt;ref&gt;However, if Apollo had progressed as planned, the record would have been broken by what was designated as the '''E mission''' which was a [[medium Earth orbit]]al test of the complete Apollo spacecraft, with an apogee of {{convert|3500|nmi|km}} planned to be flown in March 1969. But the first [[Lunar Module]] was not ready in time for the '''D mission''' planned for December 1968, which was a [[low Earth orbit]] test (see [[List of Apollo mission types]]). Therefore, the E mission was cancelled and replaced with the D mission in March, and Gemini 11's apogee record stands.&lt;/ref&gt;  The maximum operational altitude of the [[Space Shuttle]] was lower, at {{convert|380|mi|km}}.

The crew docked and undocked four times, and still had sufficient Gemini maneuvering fuel for an unplanned fifth rendezvous. They did not remain in the high orbit, but changed it back to a near-circular one at {{convert|184|mi|km}}.&lt;ref name=Gatland/&gt;

Gordon's first EVA, planned to last for two hours, involved fastening a {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} tether, stored in the Agena's docking collar, to the Gemini's docking bar for the passive stabilization experiment. Gordon achieved this, but as with previous Gemini EVAs, trying to do work for an extended period proved more fatiguing than in ground simulation, and the EVA had to be terminated after only half an hour.

The passive stabilization experiment proved to be a bit troublesome. Conrad and Gordon separated the craft in a nose-down (i.e., Agena-down) position, but found that the tether would not be kept taut simply by the Earth's gravity gradient, as expected. However, they were able to generate a small amount of artificial gravity, about 0.00015 g, by firing their side thrusters to slowly rotate the combined craft like a slow-motion pair of [[bolas]].&lt;ref name=Gatland/&gt;

Gordon successfully performed a second EVA standing up with his head and shoulders out of the hatch to photograph the Earth, clouds, and stars. This was not tiring, and lasted more than two hours.&lt;ref name=Gatland/&gt;

The Gemini 11 mission was supported by 9,054 [[United States Department of Defense]] personnel, 73 aircraft and 13 ships.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Since Conrad and Gordon were both members of the [[US Navy]], the [[Embroidered patch|embroidered mission patch]] was designed in Navy colors: blue and gold. Stars are used to mark the major milestones of the mission. The first orbit Agena rendezvous is marked by a small gold star just above the Earth, to the left. The Agena docking is marked by a large star on the left. The star at the top marks the record high apogee reached by Gemini 11. Note that the scale is greatly exaggerated; their maximum altitude of {{convert|850|mi|km}} is roughly the distance from [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] to [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Kennedy]]. Finally, the star on the right marks Dick Gordon's spacewalk. The docking, record apogee and spacewalk are also shown on the patch by the Agena, orbital apogee path and spacewalking astronaut.

In [[biology]] and [[genetics]], the '''germline''' in a [[multicellular organism]] is the population of its bodily cells that are so differentiated or segregated that in the usual processes of [[reproduction]] they may pass on their genetic material to the progeny.&lt;ref name="NieuwkoopSutasurya1979"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pieter Dirk Nieuwkoop|author2=Lien A. Sutasurya|title=Primordial Germ Cells in the Chordates: Embryogenesis and Phylogenesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zu08AAAAIAAJ|year=1979|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-22303-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a rule this passing-on happens via a process of ''[[sexual reproduction]]''; typically it is a process that includes systematic changes to the genetic material, changes that arise during [[Genetic recombination|recombination]], [[meiosis]] and [[fertilization]] for example. However, there are many exceptions, including processes and concepts such as various forms of [[apomixis]], [[Reproduction#Autogamy|autogamy]], [[Parthenogenesis#Automixis|automixis]], [[cloning]], or [[parthenogenesis]].&lt;ref name="TarinCano2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Juan J.

The cells of the germline commonly are called [[germ cell]]s.&lt;ref name="ZagrisDuprat1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nikolas Zagris|author2=Anne Marie Duprat|author3=Antony Durston|title=Organization of the Early Vertebrate Embryo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lFH7RnOHsRAC&amp;pg=PA2|date=30 November 1995|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-306-45132-4|pages=2–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[gamete]]s such as the [[spermatozoan|sperm]] or the [[ovum|egg]] are part of the germline. So are the cells that divide to produce the gametes, called [[gametocyte]]s, the cells that produce those, called [[gametogonium|gametogonia]], and all the way back to the [[zygote]], the cell from which the individual developed.&lt;ref name="ZagrisDuprat1995"/&gt;

In sexually reproducing organisms, cells that are not in the germline are called [[somatic cell]]s. The term refers to all of the cells of body apart from the gametes. According to this view [[mutation]]s, recombinations and other genetic changes in the germline may be passed to offspring, but a change in a somatic cell will not be.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2010.

For example, many varieties of [[citrus]],&lt;ref&gt;Akira Wakana and Shunpei Uemoto. Adventive Embryogenesis in Citrus (Rutaceae). II. Postfertilization Development.

In an earlier stage of genetic thinking, the distinction between germline and somatic cell was clear cut. For example, [[August Weismann]] proposed and pointed out, a germline cell is immortal in the sense that it is part of a lineage that has reproduced indefinitely since the beginning of life and, barring accident could continue doing so indefinitely.&lt;ref name="Weismann1892"&gt;{{cite book|author=August Weismann|title=Essays upon heredity and kindred biological problems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dc45AAAAMAAJ|year=1892|publisher=Clarendon press}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is now known in some detail that this distinction between somatic and germ cells is partly artificial and depends on particular circumstances and internal cellular mechanisms such as [[telomeres]] and controls such as the selective application of [[telomerase]] in germ cells, [[stem cells]] and the like.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, F. M. and B. L. M. Hogan.  2000 Out of Eden: Stem Cells and Their Niches ''Science 287:1427-1430''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Not all multicellular organisms [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into somatic and germ lines,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Radzvilavicius|first=Arunas L.|last2=Hadjivasiliou|first2=Zena|last3=Pomiankowski|first3=Andrew|last4=Lane|first4=Nick|date=2016-12-20|title=Selection for Mitochondrial Quality Drives Evolution of the Germline|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2000410|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=14|issue=12|pages=e2000410|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.2000410|issn=1545-7885|pmc=5172535|pmid=27997535}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the absence of specialised technical human intervention practically all but the simplest multicellular structures do so. In such organisms somatic cells tend to be practically [[Cell potency#Totipotency|totipotent]], and for over a century sponge cells have been known to reassemble into new sponges after having been separated by forcing them through a sieve.&lt;ref name= "Brusca"/&gt;

''Germline'' can refer to a lineage of cells spanning many generations of individuals—for example, the germline that links any living individual to the hypothetical [[last universal common ancestor]], from which all plants and animals [[common descent|descend]].

== Evolution ==
Plants and basal metazoans such as sponges (Porifera) and corals (Anthozoa) do not sequester a distinct germline, generating gametes from multipotent stem cell lineages that also give rise to ordinary somatic tissues. It is therefore likely that germline sequestration first evolved in complex animals with sophisticated body plans, i.e. bilaterians. There are several theories on the origin of the strict germline-soma distinction. Setting aside an isolated germ cell population early in embryogenesis might promote cooperation between the somatic cells of a complex multicellular organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buss|first=L W|date=1983-03-01|title=Evolution, development, and the units of selection.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=80|issue=5|pages=1387–1391|issn=0027-8424|pmc=393602|pmid=6572396|doi=10.1073/pnas.80.5.1387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another recent theory suggests that early germline sequestration evolved to limit the accumulation of deleterious mutations in mitochondrial genes in complex organisms with high energy requirements and fast mitochondrial mutation rates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
==DNA damage, mutation and repair==

[[Reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) are produced as byproducts of metabolism.  In germline cells, ROS are likely a significant cause of [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]]s that, upon [[DNA replication]], lead to [[mutation]]s.  [[8-Oxoguanine]], an oxidized derivative of [[guanine]], is produced by spontaneous oxidation in the germline cells of mice, and during the cell’s DNA replication cause GC to TA [[transversion]] mutations.&lt;ref name="pmid24732879"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ohno M, Sakumi K, Fukumura R, Furuichi M, Iwasaki Y, Hokama M, Ikemura T, Tsuzuki T, Gondo Y, Nakabeppu Y |title=8-oxoguanine causes spontaneous de novo germline mutations in mice |journal=Sci Rep |volume=4 |issue= |pages=4689 |year=2014 |pmid=24732879 |pmc=3986730 |doi=10.1038/srep04689 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such mutations occur throughout the mouse [[chromosome]]s as well as during different stages of [[gametogenesis]].

The principle of '''Irreducibility''', in [[philosophy]], has the sense that a complete account of an [[entity]] will not be possible at lower levels of [[explanation]] and which has novel properties beyond prediction and explanation. Another way to state this is that [[Occam's razor]] requires the elimination of only those entities that are unnecessary, not as many entities as could conceivably be eliminated. [[Lev Vygotsky]] provides the following illustration of the idea, in his ''Thought and Language'':

:"Two essentially different modes of analysis are possible in the study of [[psychology|psychological]] structures. It seems to us that one of them is responsible for all the failures that have beset former investigators of the old problem, which we are about to tackle in our turn, and that the other is the only correct way to approach it.

:The first method analyzes complex psychological wholes into "[[wiktionary:element|elements]]". It may be compared to the [[chemical analysis]] of water into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]], neither of which possesses the properties of the whole and each of which possesses properties not present in the whole. The student applying this method in looking for an explanation of some property of water &amp;mdash; why it extinguishes fire, for example &amp;mdash; will find to his surprise that hydrogen burns and oxygen sustains fire ....

:In our opinion the right course to follow is to use the other type of analysis, which may be called "analysis into units". By "unit", we mean a product of analysis which, unlike elements, retains all the basic properties of the whole, and which cannot be further divided without losing them. Not the chemical composition of water, but its molecules and their behaviour, are the key to the understanding of the properties of water ..."

In other words: to conserve the properties under investigation, it is necessary to remain within a certain level of complexity. Irreducibility is most often deployed in defence of the reality of human [[subjectivity]] and/or [[free will]], against those who treat such things as [[folk psychology]], such as [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]].

In “Life's Irreducible Structure”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/scientists/polanyi/Polanyi_Life_Structures.pdf|title=Life's Irreducible Structure|last=Polanyi|first=Michael|date=1968|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Michael Polanyi|Micheal Polanyi]] argues that higher-order sciences such as biology and other chemical processes can not be explained by the fundamentalist perspective.  Indeed, machines and the humans that make them fall into "boundary conditions" that produce phenomena that itself can not be reduced further. He writes &lt;blockquote&gt;The lowest level is the production of a voice; the second, the utterance of words; the third, the joining of words that make sentences; the fourth, the working of sentences into a style; the fifth, and the highest, the composition of the text. The principles of each level operate under the control of the next-higher level. The voice you produce is shaped into words by a vocabulary; a given vocabulary is shaped into sentences in accordance with a grammar; and the sentences are fitted into a style, which in turn is made to convey the ideas of the composition. Thus each level is subject to dual control: (i) control in accordance with the laws that apply to its elements in themselves, and (ii) control in accordance with the laws of the powers that control the comprehensive entity formed by these elements&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is worth noting that Reductionism has not been ruled out as an explanation of these tipping-point, emergent behaviors.

A [[condemned prisoner]]'s '''last meal''' is a customary ritual preceding [[Capital punishment|execution]]. Various countries have various traditions in this regard. A "little glass of [[rum]],"  but no formal last meal, was granted to [[Capital punishment in France|the condemned in historical France]] in the minutes before execution; no meal was offered as the condemned learned of their impending execution only on the fatal morning, generally just minutes in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lynn-George|first=Michael|title=The Writing Lesson:  From the Dragon's Teeth to Tristes Tropiques|journal=The International Journal of the Humanities|volume=4|issue=8|pages=61–72|url=http://web.mac.com/michael.lynngeorge/MLG/L%C3%A9vi-Strauss.html|accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, the prisoner may, within reason, select what the last meal will be.

== Contemporary restrictions ==
In the United States, most states give the meal a day or two before execution and use the [[euphemism]] "special meal". Alcohol or tobacco are usually denied. Unorthodox or unavailable requests are replaced with substitutes. Some states place tight restrictions. In Florida, the food for the last meal must be purchased locally and the cost is limited to $40.&lt;ref name="fdoc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Death Row Fact Sheet |work=Florida Department of Corrections |url=http://www.dc.state.fl.us/oth/deathrow/index.html |accessdate=11 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612151254/http://www.dc.state.fl.us/oth/deathrow/index.html |archivedate=12 June 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Oklahoma, cost is limited to $15. In [[Louisiana]], the [[prison warden]] traditionally joins the condemned prisoner for the last meal.  On one occasion, the warden paid for an inmate's lobster dinner.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Last-meal-requests-come-to-an-end-on-Texas-death-2184484.php|title=Last-meal requests come to an end on Texas death row|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, a prisoner shares the last meal with another inmate (as [[Francis Crowley]] did with John Resko) or has the meal distributed among other inmates (as requested by [[Raymond Fernandez]]).&lt;ref name="Bol3"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Book of Lists #3| year=1983| pages=85–87| publisher=Bantam| ISBN=0-553-27868-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, the state of Texas abolished all special last meal requests after condemned prisoner [[Lawrence Russell Brewer]] requested a huge last meal and did not eat any of it, saying he was not hungry. His last meal request was for a plate of two [[Chicken fried steak|chicken-fried steaks]] with gravy and sliced onions, a triple-patty bacon cheeseburger, a cheese [[omelet]] with ground beef, tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, jalapeños, a bowl of fried [[okra]] with ketchup, a pound of barbecued meat with half of a loaf of white bread, a portion of three [[fajita]]s, a [[Pizza Hut#Products|meat-lover's pizza]] (topped with [[pepperoni]], ham, beef, bacon, and sausage), a [[pint]] of [[Blue Bell Creameries|Blue Bell]] ice cream, a slab of [[Peanut butter|peanut-butter]] [[fudge]] with crushed peanuts, and a serving equivalent to three [[root beer]]s. The abolition followed a complaint by a [[Texas Senate|Texas Senator]], [[John Whitmire]] (Democrat, of Houston), who called the meal "inappropriate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ward|first=Mike|title=Last Meals for Condemned Cons Off Menu|url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/politics/entries/2011/09/22/complaint_halts_last_meals_for.html|publisher=Austin American Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15034970|title=Texas jails abolish last meals after uneaten banquet|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=24 September 2011|date=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/23/us/texas-death-row-kitchen-cooks-its-last-last-meal.html|title=Texas Death Row Kitchen Cooks Its Last 'Last Meal'|last=Fernandez|first=Manny|date=23 September 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of customized last meals is thought to have been established around 1924 in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local_news/article/Last-meal-tradition-for-death-row-inmates-2184368.php|title=Last-meal requests off death row menu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Leonid kubbel-2.jpg|right|170 px|thumb|Leonid Ivanovich Kubbel]]

'''Leonid Ivanovich Kubbel''' ({{lang-ru|Леонид Иванович Куббель}}) was a Russian [[chess composer|composer]] of chess [[endgame studies]] and [[chess|problems]].

He was born in [[Saint Petersburg]] at the end of 1891, or beginning of 1892&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Gaige | first=Jeremy | author-link=Jeremy Gaige | year=1987 | title=Chess Personalia, A Biobibliography | publisher=McFarland | isbn=0-7864-2353-6 | page=231}} Gaige suggests that there is some evidence in support of 6 January 1892&lt;/ref&gt; and died in the same city (then called Leningrad) on 18 April 1942. He was christened ''Karl Artur Leonid'', but amended his forenames to ''Leonid Ivanovich'' subsequent to the 1917 October Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arves.org/Biografie.htm Biographical data Endgamestudy composers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915205227/http://www.arves.org/Biografie.htm |date=2008-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He composed more than 1500 [[endgame studies]] and [[chess|problems]], many of which were awarded first prize for their great beauty and original conception. He is generally considered one of the greatest of all endgame composers. He was a [[chemical engineer]] by profession.

Leonid's brothers, Arvid and Evgeny, were also chess players. [[Arvid Kubbel]] was a strong over the board [[chess|master]], having played in the first four [[USSR]] chess championships, while Evgeny was himself an endgame composer.
Both Leonid and Evgeny Kubbel died of starvation in 1942 during the Nazi [[siege of Leningrad]], while Arvid was executed by the [[NKVD]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chehovchess.ru/lib/lek/5-eng.htm Журнал о шахматах - здесь Вы найдете статьи, советы, рассказы о шахматах и шахматистах&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629093443/http://www.chehovchess.ru/lib/lek/5-eng.htm |date=2007-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A study by Leonid Kubbel==
This is one of Leonid Kubbel's many masterpieces. The Black a-pawn apparently cannot be stopped from promotion, after which the game would be lost for White; however, a subtle plan avoids defeat and [[checkmate]]s the black king. Video analysis of this study can be found {{YouTube|qfBBv9kSGkM|here}}.

* '''2. Bf6 Kd5'''
* '''3. d3 a2'''
* '''4. c4+ Kc5'''(4....dxc3 5.Bxc3 is a simple technical win)

'''Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus''' also known as '''Paullus Aemilius Lepidus'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/oa-om/octavia/octavia_minor.html article of Octavia Minor at Livius.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lightman, ''A to Z of Ancient Greek and Roman Women'', p.205&lt;/ref&gt; (c. 77 BC–after 11 BC) was a [[Roman Senate|Roman Senator]].

Paullus was a member of the [[Aemilia (gens)|gens Aemilia]]. He was a grandson of [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 78 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]] and Appuleia through their son [[Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus]] from his unnamed wife. His paternal uncle [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]] served as a member of the [[Second Triumvirate]]. He served as [[Roman consul|Consul]] in 34 BC and [[Roman censor|Censor]] in 22.&lt;ref&gt;Lightman, ''A to Z of Ancient Greek and Roman Women'', p.205&lt;/ref&gt;

Paullus first married [[Cornelia (wife of Aemilius Paullus)|Cornelia]] (c. 54 BC-16 BC). With Cornelia, Paullus had two sons: [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 1)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]] (c. 37 BC-14 AD) the husband of [[Julia the Younger]] who served as a consul in 1 AD; [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 6)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]] (c. 30 BC-33 AD), who served as a consul in 6 AD and a daughter, called Aemilia Paulla (c. 22 BC). Aemilia was the wife of Lucius Munatius Plancus (c. 45 BC-after 14 AD) who served as a consul in 13 AD and [[Legatus|legate]] in 14 AD (who was the son of the identically-named [[Lucius Munatius Plancus]]), before she later married [[Publius Memmius Regulus]]. Paullus was widowed&lt;ref&gt;Syme, ''The Augustan Aristocracy'', p.p. 150-1&lt;/ref&gt; in 16 BC.

In 12 BC&lt;ref&gt;Syme, ''The Augustan Aristocracy'' p.151&lt;/ref&gt; Paullus married [[Claudia Marcella|Claudia Marcella Minor]], one of the daughters of consul [[Gaius Claudius Marcellus Minor]] and [[Octavia the Younger]], as her maternal uncle was the [[Roman emperor]] [[Augustus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/oa-om/octavia/octavia_minor.html article of Octavia Minor at Livius.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage of Marcella and Paullus linked two honored republican houses and tied them closely to the imperial circle.&lt;ref&gt;Lightman, ''A to Z of Ancient Greek and Roman Women'', p.205&lt;/ref&gt; Before the death of Paullus and no later than 11 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Syme, ''The Augustan Aristocracy'' p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Marcella bore him a son called [[Paullus Aemilius Regulus]].&lt;ref&gt;Lightman, ''A to Z of Ancient Greek and Roman Women'', p.205&lt;/ref&gt; Regulus served as a [[quaestor]] during the rule of the Roman emperor [[Tiberius]] who reigned from 14 AD until 37 AD.&lt;ref&gt;ILS 949&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marjorie Bonner''' (died 1895), the stage name of Catherine F. Goodwin,{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} was a 19th century American stage actress.

In 1883 she was in the Rhea Company of actors.  ''Monte Cristo'' was presented by the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] in December. Actor [[James O'Neill (actor)|James O'Neill]] performed the leading role with [[Frederic De Belleville]] playing ''Noirlier''. The female characters were of lesser significance in the play but were rendered convincingly by Bonner, Eugenie Blair, and Annie Boudinot.&lt;ref&gt;''Amusements'', ''[[Washington Post]]'', December 18, 1883, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1885 Bonner acted the part of ''Cicely Blaine'', the heroine in ''Galley Slave'', adapted from the writing of [[Bartley Campbell]]. The plot of the play dealt with impediments in the path of love. The characters were Americans traveling in [[Europe]]. The settings included [[Venice, Italy]], [[Rome, Italy]], and different parts of [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Opening of the Amusement Hall'', Waukesha Freeman, May 28, 1885, pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Bonner often played second to actress [[Margaret Mather]].&lt;ref name="death"/&gt;

Her appearance was compared to [[Lily Langtry]] and she was called "The ''[[New Jersey|New]]'' Jersey Lily".&lt;ref name=nickname&gt;''Those Who Amuse Us'', Fort Wayne Gazette, Sunday, February 25, 1883, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Bonner was found dead in her New York City apartment on November 15, 1895, the apparent victim of an overdose of morphine. She had a sister, Myra Goodwin, who was also an actress, and predeceased her.&lt;ref name="death"&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024441/1895-11-16/ed-1/seq-6/ Catherine Goodwin Dead], ''Evening Times'' (Washington, DC), November 16, 1895.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Millard–Gubler syndrome''' is a lesion of the [[pons]]. It is also called '''ventral pontine syndrome'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://instruct.uwo.ca/anatomy/530/530notes.htm Anatomy 530a at UWO (Functional Neuroanatomy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presentation==
Symptoms result from the functional loss of several anatomical structures of the [[pons]],  including the sixth and seventh [[cranial nerves]] and fibers of the [[corticospinal tract]].  [[Paralysis]] of the [[abducens nerve|abducens]] (CN VI) leads to diplopia, internal strabismus (i.e., [[esotropia]]), and loss of power to rotate the affected eye outward), and disruption of the [[facial nerve]]s (CN VII) leads to symptoms including flaccid paralysis of the muscles of facial expression and loss of the [[corneal reflex]].  Disruption of the [[corticospinal tract]] leads to [[hemiplegia|contralateral hemiplegia]] of the extremities.

==Diagnosis==
This syndrome is easier to diagnose today thanks to the technical advances in brain imaging (CT, MRI).  It can also be identified based on the symptoms described above.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Management==
{{Empty section|date=November 2017}}

== Eponym ==
Millard–Gubler syndrome is named after two French physicians, [[Auguste Louis Jules Millard]] (1830–1915), who first identified the disorder in 1855, and [[Adolphe-Marie Gubler]] (1821–1879), who described the disease in a medical paper one year later.

Moore's law is an [[observation]] and [[Forecasting|projection]] of a historical trend and not a [[physical law|physical]] or [[natural law]]. Although the rate held steady from 1975 until around 2012, the rate was faster during the first decade. In general, it is not logically sound to extrapolate from the historical growth rate into the indefinite future. For example, the 2010 update to the [[International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors]] predicted that growth would slow around 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itrs.net/Links/2010ITRS/2010Update/ToPost/2010Tables_ORTC_ITRS.xls |title=Overall Technology Roadmap Characteristics |publisher=[[International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors]] |year=2010 |accessdate=2013-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2015 Gordon Moore foresaw that the rate of [[Exponential growth|progress]] would reach [[Logistic function|saturation]]: "I see Moore's law dying here in the next decade or so."&lt;ref name="Moore 2015a"&gt;{{cite interview |last=Moore |first=Gordon |interviewer=Rachel Courtland |title=Gordon Moore: The Man Whose Name Means Progress, The visionary engineer reflects on 50 years of Moore's Law |magazine=IEEE Spectrum: Special Report: 50 Years of Moore's Law |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/gordon-moore-the-man-whose-name-means-progress |quote=We won't have the rate of progress that we've had over the last few decades.

For the thirty-fifth anniversary issue of ''[[Electronics Magazine|Electronics]]'' magazine, which was published on April 19, 1965, Gordon E. Moore, who was working as the director of research and development at [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] at the time, was asked to predict what was going to happen in the semiconductor components industry over the next ten years. His response was a brief article entitled, "Cramming more components onto integrated circuits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Dean|title=Moore's Law: how long will it last?|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/moore-s-law-how-long-will-it-last--1226772|website=www.techradar.com|accessdate=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within his editorial, he speculated that by 1975 it would be possible to contain as many as 65,000 components on a single quarter-inch semiconductor.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The complexity for minimum component costs has increased at a rate of roughly a factor of two per year. Certainly over the short term this rate can be expected to continue, if not to increase. Over the longer term, the rate of increase is a bit more uncertain, although there is no reason to believe it will not remain nearly constant for at least 10 years.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His reasoning was a log-linear relationship between device complexity (higher circuit density at reduced cost) and time.&lt;ref name=schaller&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schaller|first1=Bob|title=The Origin, Nature, and Implications of "MOORE'S LAW"|date=September 26, 1996|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gray/moore_law.html|accessdate=September 10, 2014|publisher=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tuomi2002"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.5210/fm.v7i11.1000| title = The Lives and Death of Moore's Law| journal = First Monday| volume = 7| issue = 11| year = 2002| last1 = Tuomi | first1 = I. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1975 [[IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting]], Moore revised the forecast rate.&lt;ref name="Takahashi" &gt;{{cite news |last=Takahashi |first=Dean |date=April 18, 2005 |title=Forty years of Moore's law |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/business/forty-years-of-moores-law/ |newspaper=Seattle Times |location=San Jose, CA |quote=A decade later, he revised what had become known as Moore's Law: The number of transistors on a chip would double every two years. |access-date=April 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moore 1975b" &gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moore |first1=Gordon |title=IEEE Technical Digest 1975 |date=1975 |url=http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~agrawvd/COURSE/E7770_Spr07/READ/Gordon_Moore_1975_Speech.pdf |accessdate=April 7, 2015 |publisher=Intel Corp. |quote=... the rate of increase of complexity can be expected to change slope in the next few years as shown in Figure 5.

* die sizes were increasing at an exponential rate and as defective densities decreased, chip manufacturers could work with larger areas without losing reduction yields;
* simultaneous evolution to finer minimum dimensions;
* and what Moore called "circuit and device cleverness".

Despite a popular misconception, Moore is adamant that he did not predict a doubling "every 18 months". Rather, David House, an Intel colleague, had factored in the increasing performance of transistors to conclude that integrated circuits would double in ''performance'' every 18&amp;nbsp;months. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/usa/technowize-magazine/20170501/282445643992141|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- remove repetitive material; left here in case there is something worth adding back
Moore's original statement that transistor counts had doubled every year can be found in his publication "Cramming more components onto integrated circuits", ''[[Electronics (magazine)|Electronics Magazine]]'' April 19, 1965. The paper noted that the number of components in integrated circuits had doubled every year from the invention of the integrated circuit in 1958 until 1965{{sfn|Moore|1965|p=5}} and then concluded:
{{Quote|The complexity for minimum component costs has increased at a rate of roughly a factor of two per year. Certainly over the short term this rate can be expected to continue, if not to increase.

Moore's law came to be widely accepted as a goal for the industry, and it was cited by competitive [[semiconductor]] manufacturers as they strove to increase processing power. Moore viewed his eponymous law as surprising and optimistic: "Moore's law is a violation of [[Murphy's law]].

In April 2005, [[Intel]] offered US$10,000 to purchase a copy of the original ''Electronics'' issue in which Moore's article appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/intel-offers-10000-for-moores-law-magazine/142261|title=Intel offers $10,000 for Moore's Law magazine|last=Kanellos|first=Michael|date=2005-04-11|publisher=ZDNET News.com|accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; An engineer living in the United Kingdom was the first to find a copy and offer it to Intel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4472549.stm|title=Moore's Law original issue found|date=2005-04-22|accessdate=2012-08-26|publisher=[[BBC News|BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moore's second law===

As the cost of computer power to the [[consumer]] falls, the cost for producers to fulfill Moore's law follows an opposite trend: R&amp;D, manufacturing, and test costs have increased steadily with each new generation of chips. Rising manufacturing costs are an important consideration for the sustaining of Moore's law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first = Sumner | last = Lemon | first2 = Tom | last2 = Krazit |url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/2669732/computer-hardware/with-chips--moore-s-law-is-not-the-problem.html |title=With chips, Moore's Law is not the problem |publisher=Infoworld |date=2005-04-19 |accessdate=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This had led to the formulation of Moore's second law, also called [[Rock's law]], which is that the [[financial capital|capital]] cost of a [[fab (semiconductors)|semiconductor fab]] also increases exponentially over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edavision.com/200111/feature.pdf |publisher=EDA Vision |title=Does Moore's Law Still Hold Up? |format=PDF | first = Jeff | last = Dorsch |accessdate=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.microsoft.com/~gray/Moore_Law.html |title=The Origin, Nature, and Implications of "Moore's Law" | first = Bob | last = Schaller |publisher=Research.microsoft.com |date=1996-09-26 |accessdate=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous innovations by scientists and engineers have sustained Moore's law since the beginning of the integrated circuit (IC) era. Some of the key innovations are listed below, as examples of breakthroughs that have advanced [[integrated circuit]] technology by more than seven orders of magnitude in less than five decades:
* The foremost contribution, which is the ''raison d'être'' for Moore's law, is the invention of the [[integrated circuit]], credited contemporaneously to [[Jack Kilby]] at Texas Instruments&lt;ref&gt;Kilby, J., "Miniaturized electronic circuits", {{patent|US|3138743}}, issued June 23, 1964 (filed February 6, 1959).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Noyce]] at Fairchild Semiconductor.&lt;ref&gt;Noyce, R., "Semiconductor device-and-lead structure", {{patent|US|2981877}}, issued April 25, 1961 (filed July 30, 1959).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The invention of the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor ([[CMOS]]) process by [[Frank Wanlass]] in 1963,&lt;ref&gt;Wanlass, F., "Low stand-by power complementary field effect circuitry", {{patent|US|3356858}}, issued December 5, 1967 (filed June 18, 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of advances in CMOS technology by many workers in the semiconductor field since the work of Wanlass, have enabled the extremely dense and high-performance ICs that the industry makes today.
* The invention of dynamic random-access memory ([[DRAM]]) technology by [[Robert H. Dennard|Robert Dennard]] at [[IBM]] in 1967&lt;ref&gt;Dennard, R., "Field-effect transistor memory", {{patent|US|3387286}}, issued June 4, 1968 (filed July 14, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; made it possible to fabricate single-transistor memory cells, and the invention of [[flash memory]] by [[Fujio Masuoka]] at Toshiba in the 1980s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fulford|first= Benjamin|title=Unsung hero|work=Forbes|date=June 24, 2002|accessdate=March 18, 2008|url= https://www.forbes.com/global/2002/0624/030.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|4531203|Fujio Masuoka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=1487443 |title=New ultra high density EPROM and flash EEPROM with NAND structure cell  |last1=Masuoka |first1=F. |last2=Momodomi |first2=M. |last3=Iwata |first3=Y. |last4=Shirota |first4=R. |year=1987 |work=Electron Devices Meeting, 1987 International |publisher=[[IEEE]] |accessdate=January 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to low-cost, high-capacity memory in diverse electronic products.

Computer industry technology road maps predicted in 2001 that Moore's law would continue for several generations of semiconductor chips. Depending on the doubling time used in the calculations, this could mean up to a hundredfold increase in transistor count per chip within a decade. The semiconductor industry technology roadmap used a three-year doubling time for [[microprocessor]]s, leading to a tenfold increase in a decade.&lt;ref name="International Technology Roadmap"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://public.itrs.net/ |title=International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors |accessdate=2011-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825075240/http://public.itrs.net/ |archivedate=2011-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intel was reported in 2005 as stating that the downsizing of [[silicon]] chips with good economics could continue during the following decade,{{#tag:ref|The trend begins with the invention of the integrated circuit in 1958.

===Recent trends===
[[File:Threshold formation nowatermark.gif|thumb|450px|An [[atomistic]] simulation for electron density as gate voltage (Vg) varies in a [[nanowire]] MOSFET. The threshold voltage is around 0.45&amp;nbsp;V. Nanowire MOSFETs lie toward the end of the ITRS road map for scaling devices below 10&amp;nbsp;nm gate lengths. A [[FinFET]] has three sides of the channel covered by gate, while some nanowire transistors have gate-all-around structure, providing better gate control.&lt;ref name="International Technology Roadmap"/&gt;]]

One of the key challenges of engineering future nanoscale transistors is the design of gates. As device dimension shrinks, controlling the current flow in the thin channel becomes more difficult. Compared to [[FinFET]]s, which have gate dielectric on three sides of the channel, gate-all-around structure has ever better gate control.
* In 2010, researchers at the Tyndall National Institute in Cork, Ireland announced a junctionless transistor. A control gate wrapped around a silicon nanowire can control the passage of electrons without the use of junctions or doping. They claim these may be produced at 10-nanometer scale using existing fabrication techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/nanoclast/semiconductors/nanotechnology/junctionless-transistor-fabricated-from-nanowires| title =Junctionless Transistor Fabricated from Nanowires|date=2010-02-22|  first = Dexter | last = Johnson|publisher=IEEE Spectrum| accessdate = 2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2011, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh announced the development of a single-electron transistor, 1.5 nanometers in diameter, made out of oxide based materials. Three "wires" converge on a central "island" that can house one or two electrons. Electrons tunnel from one wire to another through the island. Conditions on the third wire result in distinct conductive properties including the ability of the transistor to act as a solid state memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110418135541.htm |title=Super-small transistor created: Artificial atom powered by single electron |doi=10.1038/nnano.2011.56 |publisher=Science Daily |date=2011-04-19 |accessdate=2011-08-22|bibcode = 2011NatNa...6..343C |volume=6 |journal=Nature Nanotechnology |pages=343–347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanowire transistors could spur the creation of microscopic computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=173|title=Physics of the Future|first = Michio | last = Kaku|publisher=Doubleday|date=2010|isbn=978-0-385-53080-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://phys.org/news/2013-05-nanowire-transistors-law-alive.html |title=New nanowire transistors may help keep Moore's Law alive |doi=10.1039/C3NR33738C | first = Bob | last = Yirka |publisher=Phys.org |date=2013-05-02 |accessdate=2013-08-08 |volume=5 |journal=Nanoscale |pages=2437|bibcode=2013Nanos...5.2437L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/06/05/nanotech-geim-graphene-pf-guru-in_jw_0605adviserqa_inl.html |title=Rejuvenating Moore's Law With Nanotechnology |publisher=Forbes |date=2007-06-05 |accessdate=2013-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revolutionary technology advances may help sustain Moore's law through improved performance with or without reduced feature size.

While physical limits to transistor scaling such as source-to-drain leakage, limited gate metals, and limited options for channel material have been reached, new avenues for continued scaling are open. The most promising of these approaches rely on using the spin state of electron [[spintronics]], [[tunnel junction]]s, and advanced confinement of channel materials via nano-wire geometry. A comprehensive list of available device choices shows that a wide range of device options is open for continuing Moore's law into the next few decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nikonov|first1=Dmitri E.|last2=Young|first2=Ian A.|date=2013-02-01|title=Overview of Beyond-CMOS Devices and A Uniform Methodology for Their Benchmarking|publisher=Cornell University Library|arxiv=1302.0244|bibcode=2013arXiv1302.0244N}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spin-based logic and memory options are being developed actively in industrial labs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manipatruni|first1=Sasikanth|last2=Nikonov|first2=Dmitri E.|last3=Young|first3=Ian A.|date=2012-12-13|title=Material Targets for Scaling All Spin Logic|journal=Physical Review Applied|publisher=Cornell University Library|volume=5|arxiv=1212.3362|bibcode=2016PhRvP...5a4002M|doi=10.1103/PhysRevApplied.5.014002}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as academic labs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2010-02-28|title=Proposal for an all-spin logic device with built-in memory|url=http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/v5/n4/abs/nnano.2010.31.html|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|volume=5|pages=266–270|bibcode=2010NatNa...5..266B|doi=10.1038/nnano.2010.31|accessdate=2013-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternative materials research ===
The vast majority of current transistors on ICs are composed principally of [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] silicon and its alloys. As silicon is fabricated into single nanometer transistors, [[short-channel effect]]s adversely change desired material properties of silicon as a functional transistor. Below are several non-silicon substitutes in the fabrication of small nanometer transistors.

One proposed material is [[Indium gallium arsenide#Applications|indium gallium arsenide]], or InGaAs. Compared to their silicon and germanium counterparts, InGaAs transistors are more promising for future high-speed, low-power logic applications. Because of intrinsic characteristics of [[List of semiconductor materials#Compound semiconductors|III-V compound semiconductors]], quantum well and [[Tunnel field-effect transistor|
tunnel]] effect transistors based on InGaAs have been proposed as alternatives to more traditional [[MOSFET]] designs.
* In 2009, Intel announced the development of 80-nanometer InGaAs [[quantum well]] transistors. Quantum well devices contain a material sandwiched between two layers of material with a wider band gap. Despite being double the size of leading pure silicon transistors at the time, the company reported that they performed equally as well while consuming less power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Logic performance evaluation and transport physics of Schottky-gate III-V compound semiconductor quantum well field effect transistors for power supply voltages (VCC) ranging from 0.5v to 1.0v |publisher=IEEE |date=2009-12-07 |accessdate=2016-08-15 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5424314 |first1 = G. | last1 = Dewey |first2 = R. |last2 = Kotlyar |first3 = R. |last3 = Pillarisetty |first4 = M. |last4 = Radosavljevic |first5 = T. |last5 = Rakshit |first6 = H. |last6 = Then |first7 = R. |last7 = Chau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various forms of [[graphene]] are being studied for [[graphene electronics]], eg. [[Graphene nanoribbon]] [[graphene transistor|transistors]] have shown great promise since its appearance in publications in 2008. (Bulk graphene has a [[band gap]] of zero and thus cannot be used in transistors because of its constant conductivity, an inability to turn off.  The zigzag edges of the nanoribbons introduce localized energy states in the conduction and valence bands and thus a bandgap that enables switching when fabricated as a transistor. As an example, a typical GNR of width of 10&amp;nbsp;nm has a desirable bandgap energy of 0.4eV.&lt;ref name="nature 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Graphene Transistors -- A New Contender for Future Electronics |publisher=Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology (ICSICT), 2010 10th IEEE International Conference |date=2010-04-11 &lt;!--|accessdate=2016-08-15--&gt; |first = Frank| last =Schwierz }}&lt;/ref&gt;) More research will need to be performed, however, on sub 50&amp;nbsp;nm graphene layers, as its resistivity value increases and thus electron mobility decreases.&lt;ref name="nature 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Carbon-based electronics |publisher=Nature Nanotechnology |date=2007-09-30 |accessdate=2016-08-15 |url=http://physics.oregonstate.edu/~tatej/COURSES/ph575/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=avouris_review_nnano.2007.300.pdf |first1 = Phaedon| last1 = Avouris| first2 =Zhihong | last2 =Chen| first3= Vasili | last3=Perebeinos }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2005, [[Gordon Moore]] stated in an interview that the projection cannot be sustained indefinitely: "It can't continue forever. The nature of exponentials is that you push them out and eventually disaster happens." He also noted that [[transistor]]s eventually would reach the limits of miniaturization at [[atom]]ic levels:
{{Quote|In terms of size [of transistors] you can see that we're approaching the size of atoms which is a fundamental barrier, but it'll be two or three generations before we get that far—but that's as far out as we've ever been able to see.

It no longer centered its research and development plan on Moore's law.

== Consequences ==
[[Technological change]] is a combination of more and of better technology. A 2011 study in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' showed that the peak of the rate of change of the world's capacity to compute information was in 1998, when the world's technological capacity to compute information on general-purpose computers grew at 88% per year.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The World's Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information |first=Martin |last=Hilbert |first2=Priscila |last2=López |year=2011 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=332 |issue=6025 |pages=60–65 |doi=10.1126/science.1200970 |bibcode = 2011Sci...332...60H |pmid=21310967}} Free access to the study through [http://www.martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html www.martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html] and video animation [http://ideas.economist.com/video/giant-sifting-sound-0 ideas.economist.com/video/giant-sifting-sound-0] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118072720/http://ideas.economist.com/video/giant-sifting-sound-0 |date=2012-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, technological change clearly has slowed. In recent times, every new year allowed humans to carry out roughly 60% more computation than possibly could have been executed by all existing general-purpose computers in the year before.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt; This still is exponential, but shows the varying nature of technological change.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/respol/v14y1985i2p61-82.html "Technological guideposts and innovation avenuesn"], Sahal, Devendra (1985), Research Policy, 14, 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary driving force of [[Economic growth#Factors affecting economic growth|economic growth]] is the growth of productivity,&lt;ref name="Kendrick 1961 3"/&gt; and Moore's law factors into productivity. Moore (1995) expected that "the rate of technological progress is going to be controlled from financial realities".&lt;ref name=Moore1995/&gt; The reverse could and did occur around the late-1990s, however, with economists reporting that "[[Productivity#Labor productivity|Productivity]] growth is the key economic indicator of innovation."&lt;ref name=Jorgenson01/&gt;

An acceleration in the rate of semiconductor progress contributed to a surge in U.S. [[Productivity#Labor productivity|productivity]] growth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | citeseerx=10.1.1.198.9555 |title=Information Technology and the U.S. Economy:  Presidential Address to the American Economic Association |publisher=[[American Economic Association]] | first = Dale W. | last = Jorgenson | date = 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.22.1.3 |title=A Retrospective Look at the U.S. Productivity Growth Resurgence |publisher=Journal of Economic Perspectives | first1 = Dale W. | last1 = Jorgenson | first2 = Mun S. | last2 = Ho | first3 = Kevin J. | last3 = Stiroh | date = 2008 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bea.gov/papers/pdf/ip-nipa.pdf |title=Information Processing Equipment and Software in the National Accounts |publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis | first1 = Bruce T. | last1 = Grimm | first2 = Brent R. | last2 = Moulton | first3 = David B. | last3 = Wasshausen | date = 2002 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reached 3.4% per year in 1997–2004, outpacing the 1.6% per year during both 1972–1996 and 2005–2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/OPHNFB |title=Nonfarm Business Sector: Real Output Per Hour of All Persons |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Economic Data |year=2014 |accessdate=2014-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As economist Richard G. Anderson notes, "Numerous studies have traced the cause of the productivity acceleration to technological innovations in the production of semiconductors that sharply reduced the prices of such components and of the products that contain them (as well as expanding the capabilities of such products)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/es/07/ES0707.pdf |title=How Well Do Wages Follow Productivity Growth? |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Economic Synopses | first = Richard G. | last = Anderson | date = 2007 |accessdate=2014-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Intel.svg|thumb|'''Intel transistor gate length trend''' – transistor scaling has slowed down significantly at advanced (smaller) nodes]]
An alternative source of improved performance is in [[microarchitecture]] techniques exploiting the growth of available transistor count. [[Out-of-order execution]] and on-chip [[CPU cache|caching]] and [[Instruction prefetch|prefetching]] reduce the memory latency bottleneck at the expense of using more transistors and increasing the processor complexity. These increases are described empirically by [[Pollack's Rule]], which states that performance increases due to microarchitecture techniques are square root of the number of transistors or the area of a processor.

For years, processor makers delivered increases in [[clock rate]]s and [[instruction-level parallelism]], so that single-threaded code executed faster on newer processors with no modification.&lt;ref&gt;See Herb Sutter,[http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm The Free Lunch Is Over: A Fundamental Turn Toward Concurrency in Software], Dr. Dobb's Journal, 30(3), March 2005. Retrieved November 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Now, to manage [[CPU power dissipation]], processor makers favor [[multi-core]] chip designs, and software has to be written in a [[multi-threaded]] manner to take full advantage of the hardware. Many multi-threaded development paradigms introduce overhead, and will not see a linear increase in speed vs number of processors. This is particularly true while accessing shared or dependent resources, due to [[Lock (computer science)|lock]] contention. This effect becomes more noticeable as the number of processors increases. There are cases where a roughly 45% increase in processor transistors has translated to roughly 10–20% increase in processing power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=2129&amp;p=3 | title =AnandTech: Intel's 90nm Pentium M 755: Dothan Investigated |date=2004-07-21| first = Anand Lal |last=Shimpi|publisher=Anadtech| accessdate = 2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, processor manufacturers are taking advantage of the 'extra space' that the transistor shrinkage provides to add specialized processing units to deal with features such as graphics, video, and cryptography. For one example, Intel's Parallel JavaScript extension not only adds support for multiple cores, but also for the other non-general processing features of their chips, as part of the migration in client side scripting toward [[HTML5]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2011/09/15/parallel-javascript |title=Parallel JavaScript |publisher=Intel |date=2011-09-15 |accessdate=2013-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A negative implication of Moore's law is [[obsolescence]], that is, as technologies continue to rapidly "improve", these improvements may be significant enough to render predecessor technologies obsolete rapidly. In situations in which security and survivability of hardware or data are paramount, or in which resources are limited, rapid obsolescence may pose obstacles to smooth or continued operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Trapped on Technology's Trailing Edge |publisher=IEEE Spectrum |date=April 2008 |accessdate=2011-11-27 |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/trapped-on-technologys-trailing-edge |first = Peter | last = Standborn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the toxic materials used in the production of modern computers, obsolescence, if not properly managed, may lead to harmful environmental impacts. On the other hand, obsolescence may sometimes be desirable to a company which can profit immensely from the regular purchase of what is often expensive new equipment instead of retaining one device for a longer period of time. Those in the industry are well aware of this, and may utilize [[planned obsolescence]] as a method of increasing profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scn.sap.com/docs/DOC-34208 |title=WEEE – Combating the obsolescence of computers and other devices |publisher=SAP Community Network |date=2012-12-14 |accessdate=2013-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore's law has affected the performance of other technologies significantly: [[Michael S. Malone]] wrote of a Moore's War following the apparent success of [[shock and awe]] in the early days of the [[Iraq War]]. Progress in the development of guided weapons depends on electronic technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Malone | first = Michael S. |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=86673 |title=Silicon Insider: Welcome to Moore's War |publisher=ABC News |date=March 27, 2003 |accessdate=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements in circuit density and low-power operation associated with Moore's law also have contributed to the development of technologies including [[mobile phones|mobile telephones]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zygmont|first=Jeffrey|title=Microchip|year=2003|publisher=Perseus Publishing|location=Cambridge, MA, USA|isbn=0-7382-0561-3|pages=154–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[3D printing|3-D printing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lipson|first=Hod|title=Fabricated: The New World of 3D Printing|year=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Indianapolis, IN, USA|isbn=978-1-118-35063-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other formulations and similar observations==
Several measures of digital technology are improving at exponential rates related to Moore's law, including the size, cost, density, and speed of components. Moore wrote only about the density of components, "a component being a transistor, resistor, diode or capacitor",&lt;ref name=Moore1995 &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/CHE323/Moore1995.pdf |title=Lithography and the future of Moore's law |publisher=[[SPIE]] |last=Moore |first=Gordon E.|authorlink=Gordon Moore |year=1995 |accessdate=2014-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; at minimum cost.

'''Transistors per integrated circuit''' – The most popular formulation is of the doubling of the number of [[transistor]]s on [[integrated circuit]]s every two years. At the end of the 1970s, Moore's law became known as the limit for the number of transistors on the most complex chips. The graph at the top shows this trend holds true today.
* As of 2017, the commercially available processor possessing the highest number of transistors is the 48 core [[Qualcomm Centriq|Centriq]] with over 18 billion transistors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2017/11/08/qualcomm-datacenter-technologies-announces-commercial-shipment-qualcomm |title=Qualcomm Processor|publisher= [[Qualcomm]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Density at minimum cost per transistor''' – This is the formulation given in Moore's 1965 paper.&lt;ref name="Moore1965paper"/&gt; It is not just about the density of transistors that can be achieved, but about the density of transistors at which the cost per transistor is the lowest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stokes |first=Jon |url=https://arstechnica.com/hardware/news/2008/09/moore.ars |title=Understanding Moore's Law |publisher=Ars Technica |date=2008-09-27 |accessdate=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As more transistors are put on a chip, the cost to make each transistor decreases, but the chance that the chip will not work due to a defect increases. In 1965, Moore examined the density of transistors at which cost is minimized, and observed that, as transistors were made smaller through advances in [[photolithography]], this number would increase at "a rate of roughly a factor of two per year".&lt;ref name="Moore1965paper"/&gt;

'''[[Dennard scaling]]''' – This suggests that power requirements are proportional to area (both voltage and current being proportional to length) for transistors. Combined with Moore's law, [[performance per watt]] would grow at roughly the same rate as transistor density, doubling every 1–2 years. According to [[Dennard scaling]] transistor dimensions are scaled by 30% (0.7x) every technology generation, thus reducing their area by 50%. This reduces the delay by 30% (0.7x) and therefore increases operating frequency by about 40% (1.4x). Finally, to keep electric field constant, voltage is reduced by 30%, reducing energy by 65% and power (at 1.4x frequency) by 50%.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Active power = CV&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;f&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in every technology generation transistor density doubles, circuit becomes 40% faster, while power consumption (with twice the number of transistors) stays the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/5/107702-the-future-of-microprocessors/fulltext |accessdate=2011-11-27 |title=The Future of Microprocessors|date=May 2011| first1 = Shekhar | last1 = Borkar | first2 = Andrew A. | last2 = Chien|journal=Communications of the ACM  |volume=54 |issue=5 | doi=10.1145/1941487.1941507
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exponential processor transistor growth predicted by Moore does not always translate into exponentially greater practical CPU performance. Since around 2005–2007, Dennard scaling appears to have broken down, so even though Moore's law continued for several years after that, it has not yielded dividends in improved performance.&lt;ref name=cartesian&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartesianproduct.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/the-end-of-dennard-scaling/|title = The end of Dennard scaling|date = April 15, 2013|last = McMenamin|first = Adrian|accessdate = January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=retrospective&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~agrawvd/COURSE/READING/LOWP/Boh07.pdf|title = A 30 Year Retrospective on Dennard's MOSFET Scaling Paper|publisher = Solid-State Circuits Society|last = Bohr|first = Mark|date = January 2007|accessdate = January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary reason cited for the breakdown is that at small sizes, current leakage poses greater challenges, and also causes the chip to heat up, which creates a threat of [[thermal runaway]] and therefore, further increases energy costs.&lt;ref name=cartesian/&gt;&lt;ref name=retrospective/&gt;

The breakdown of Dennard scaling prompted a switch among some chip manufacturers to a greater focus on multicore processors, but the gains offered by switching to more cores are lower than the gains that would be achieved had Dennard scaling continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hadi/doc/paper/2012-toppicks-dark_silicon.pdf|title = Dark Silicon and the end of multicore scaling|last = Esmaeilzedah|first = Hadi|last2 = Blem|first2 = Emily|last3 = St. Amant|first3 = Renee|last4 = Sankaralingam|first4 = Kartikeyan|last5 = Burger|first5 = Doug}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/116561-the-death-of-cpu-scaling-from-one-core-to-many-and-why-were-still-stuck|title = The death of CPU scaling: From one core to many — and why we're still stuck|last = Hruska|first = Joel|date = February 1, 2012|accessdate = January 23, 2014|publisher = [[ExtremeTech]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another departure from Dennard scaling, Intel microprocessors adopted a non-planar tri-gate [[FinFET]] at [[22 nm]] in 2012 that is faster and consumes less power than a conventional planar transistor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semiconwest.org/sites/semiconwest.org/files/docs/Kaizad%20Mistry_Intel.pdf |title=Tri-Gate Transistors: Enabling Moore's Law at 22nm and Beyond |publisher=Intel Corporation at semiconwest.org |first = Kaizad | last = Mistry |date = 2011 |accessdate=2014-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quality adjusted price of IT equipment''' – The [[Price index|price]] of information technology (IT), computers and peripheral equipment, [[Price index#Quality change|adjusted for quality]] and inflation, declined 16% per year on average over the five decades from 1959 to 2009.

'''Fiber-optic capacity''' – The number of bits per second that can be sent down an optical fiber increases exponentially, faster than Moore's law. '''Keck's law''', in honor of [[Donald Keck]].&lt;ref&gt;

'''Network capacity''' – According to Gerry/Gerald Butters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/personinfo/FromPersonIdPersonTearsheet.jhtml?passedPersonId=922126 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012201431/http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/personinfo/FromPersonIdPersonTearsheet.jhtml?passedPersonId=922126 |archivedate=2007-10-12 |title=Gerald Butters is a communications industry veteran |publisher=Forbes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambdaopticalsystems.com/about-board-dir.php |title=Board of Directors |publisher=LAMBDA OpticalSystems |accessdate=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the former head of Lucent's Optical Networking Group at [[Bell Labs]], there is another version, called Butters' Law of Photonics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmcnet.com/articles/comsol/0100/0100pubout.htm |title=As We May Communicate |publisher=Tmcnet.com | first = Rich | last = Tehrani |accessdate=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; a formulation that deliberately parallels Moore's law. Butters' law says that the amount of data coming out of an optical fiber is doubling every nine months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG20000926S0065 |title=Speeding net traffic with tiny mirrors |publisher=[[EE Times]] |date=2000-09-26 | first = Gail | last = Robinson |accessdate=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the cost of transmitting a bit over an optical network decreases by half every nine months. The availability of [[wavelength-division multiplexing]] (sometimes called WDM) increased the capacity that could be placed on a single fiber by as much as a factor of 100. Optical networking and [[Dense WDM|dense wavelength-division multiplexing]] (DWDM) is rapidly bringing down the cost of networking, and further progress seems assured. As a result, the wholesale price of data traffic collapsed in the [[dot-com bubble]]. [[Nielsen's Law]] says that the bandwidth available to users increases by 50% annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/980405.html |title=Nielsen's Law of Internet Bandwidth |publisher=Alertbox | first = Jakob | last = Nielsen |date=1998-04-05 |accessdate=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pixels per dollar''' – Similarly, Barry Hendy of Kodak Australia has plotted pixels per dollar as a basic measure of value for a digital camera, demonstrating the historical linearity (on a log scale) of this market and the opportunity to predict the future trend of digital camera price, LCD and LED screens, and resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/news/trust-the-power-of-technology/story-e6frg6q6-1225696991379 |title=Trust the power of technology |date=2009-04-09 |accessdate=2013-12-02 | first = Ziggy | last = Switkowski |publisher=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/egs/papers/lesser-known-laws.pdf |title=Some Lesser-Known Laws of Computer Science | first1 = Emin | last1 = Günsirer | first2 = Rik | last2 = Farrow |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://antranik.org/using-moores-law-to-predict-future-memory-trends/ |title=Using Moore's Law to Predict Future Memory Trends |date=2011-11-21 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The great Moore's law compensator (TGMLC)''', also known as [[Wirth's law]] – generally is referred to as [[software bloat]] and is the principle that successive generations of computer software increase in size and complexity, thereby offsetting the performance gains predicted by Moore's law. In a 2008 article in [[InfoWorld]], Randall C. Kennedy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy |first=Randall C. |url=http://www.infoworld.com/t/applications/fat-fatter-fattest-microsofts-kings-bloat-278?page=0,4 |title=Fat, fatter, fattest: Microsoft's kings of bloat |publisher=InfoWorld |date=2008-04-14 |accessdate=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; formerly of Intel, introduces this term using successive versions of [[Microsoft Office]] between the year 2000 and 2007 as his premise. Despite the gains in computational performance during this time period according to Moore's law, Office 2007 performed the same task at half the speed on a prototypical year 2007 computer as compared to Office 2000 on a year 2000 computer.

'''Library expansion''' – was calculated in 1945 by [[Fremont Rider]] to double in capacity every 16 years, if sufficient space were made available.&lt;ref name="The Scholar"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Rider| title = The Scholar and the Future of the Research Library| publisher = Hadham Press| year = 1944| location = New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt; He advocated replacing bulky, decaying printed works with miniaturized [[microform]] analog photographs, which could be duplicated on-demand for library patrons or other institutions. He did not foresee the digital technology that would follow decades later to replace analog microform with digital imaging, storage, and transmission media. Automated, potentially lossless digital technologies allowed vast increases in the rapidity of information growth in an era that now sometimes is called the [[Information Age]].

'''[[Carlson curve]]''' – is a term coined by ''The Economist''&lt;ref&gt;Life 2.0. (August 31, 2006). The Economist&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the biotechnological equivalent of Moore's law, and is named after author Rob Carlson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Carlson | first = Robert H. | title = Biology Is Technology: The Promise, Peril, and New Business of Engineering Life | location = Cambridge, MA | publisher = Harvard UP | date = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson accurately predicted that the doubling time of DNA sequencing technologies (measured by cost and performance) would be at least as fast as Moore's law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Pace and Proliferation of Biological Technologies | first = Robert | last = Carlson | journal = Biosecurity and Bioterrorism: Biodefense Strategy, Practice, and Science | date = September 2003 | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 203–214 | doi =10.1089/153871303769201851 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson Curves illustrate the rapid (in some cases hyperexponential) decreases in cost, and increases in performance, of a variety of technologies, including DNA sequencing, DNA synthesis, and a range of physical and computational tools used in protein expression and in determining protein structures.

'''[[Eroom's law]]''' – is a pharmaceutical drug development observation which was deliberately written as Moore's Law spelled backwards in order to contrast it with the exponential advancements of other forms of technology (such as transistors) over time. It states that the cost of developing a new drug roughly doubles every nine years.

'''[[Experience curve effects]]''' says that each doubling of the cumulative production of virtually any product or service is accompanied by an approximate constant percentage reduction in the unit cost. The acknowledged first documented qualitative description of this dates from 1885.&lt;ref name="ebbing_book"&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=oRSMDF6y3l8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Page 42, Fig 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=ikEMAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22learning+curve%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22learning%20curve%22&amp;f=false The American Journal of Psychology, Volume 14 1903 By Granville Stanley Hall, Edward Bradford Titchene&lt;/ref&gt; A power curve was used to describe this phenomenon in a 1936 discussion of the cost of airplanes.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, T.P., Factors Affecting the Cost of Airplanes, ''[[Journal of Aeronautical Sciences]]'', 3(4) (1936): 122-128.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shanda Renee Sharer''' (June 6, 1979 – January 11, 1992) was an [[United States|American]] girl who was [[torture]]d and burned to death in [[Madison, Indiana|Madison]], [[Indiana]] by four teenage girls. She was 12 years old at the time of her death. The incident attracted international attention due to both the brutality of the murder and the young age of the perpetrators, who were aged between 15 and 17 years old. The case was covered on national news and talk programs and has inspired a number of episodes on fictional crime shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MacDonald|first=Janelle|title=Shana Sharer's mother to appear on Dr. Phil|url=http://www.wave3.com/story/14680960/shanda-sharers-mother-to-appear-on-dr-phil|publisher=[[WAVE (TV)|WAVE 3 News]]|date=May 20, 2011|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shanda Sharer==
Shanda Sharer was born at Pineville Community Hospital in [[Pineville, Kentucky|Pineville]], [[Kentucky]], on June 6, 1979, to Stephen Sharer and his wife Jacqueline, who was later known as Jacqueline Vaught.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cruel Sacrifice|year=1994|last= Jones| first= Aphrodite|publisher=[[Kensington Books|Pinnacle]]|isbn=9780786010639|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Sharer's parents divorced, her mother remarried and the family moved to [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]. There, Sharer attended fifth and sixth grades at St. Paul School, where she was on the [[cheerleading]], [[volleyball]] and [[softball]] teams.&lt;ref name="cj011492"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Pain of Remembering|author=Runquist, Pam|date=January 14, 1992|newspaper=''[[The Courier-Journal]]''|page=8A}}&lt;/ref&gt; When her mother divorced again, the family moved in June 1991 to [[New Albany, Indiana|New Albany]], [[Indiana]], and Sharer enrolled at Hazelwood Middle School.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 125–126.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the school year, she transferred to Our Lady of Perpetual Help School, a [[Catholic school]] in New Albany, where she joined the girls' [[basketball]] team.&lt;ref name="cj011492" /&gt;

==Girls involved in the murder==

===Melinda Loveless===
Melinda Loveless was born in New Albany on October 28, 1975, the youngest of three daughters, to Marjorie and Larry Loveless. Larry was drafted into the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] during the [[Vietnam War]] and was treated as a hero upon his return. Marjorie later described him as a pervert who would wear her and her daughters' underwear and makeup, was incapable of staying [[monogamy|monogamous]], and had a mixture of jealousy and fascination with seeing her have sex with other men and women. They lived in or near New Albany throughout Melinda's childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 53–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Larry worked irregularly for the [[Southern Railway (US)|Southern Railway]] after his military service; his profession allowed him to work whenever most convenient for him. In 1965, Larry became a probationary officer with the New Albany Police Department, but was fired after eight months when he and his partner assaulted an [[African-American]] man whom Larry accused of sleeping with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 59–66.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, Larry briefly worked as a [[mail carrier]] but quit after three months and did very little work, having brought most of his mail home to destroy it.&lt;ref name="Jones, 110–117"&gt;Jones, pp. 110–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marjorie had worked intermittently since 1974. When both parents were working, the family was financially well off, living in the upper-middle-class suburb of [[Floyds Knobs, Indiana]]. Larry did not usually share his income with the family and impulsively spent any money he earned on himself, especially firearms, motorcycles and cars. He filed for bankruptcy in 1980. Extended family members often described the Loveless daughters as visiting their homes hungry, apparently not getting food at home.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 71–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through most of their relationship, the Loveless parents often had an [[open marriage]]. They would often visit bars in Louisville, where Larry would pretend to be a doctor or a dentist and introduce Marjorie as his girlfriend. He would also "share" her with some of his friends from work, which she found disgusting. During an [[Group sex|orgy]] with another couple at their house, Marjorie tried to commit [[suicide]], an act she would repeat several times throughout her daughters' childhoods.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt; When Melinda was nine years old, Larry had Marjorie [[gang rape]]d, after which she tried to drown herself. After that incident, she refused him sex for a month, until he violently [[rape]]d her as their daughters overheard the event through a closed door. In the summer of 1986, after she would not let him go home with two women he met at a bar, Larry beat Marjorie so severely that she was hospitalized; he was convicted of [[Battery (crime)|battery]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 87–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent of Larry's abuse of his daughters and other children is unclear. Various court testimonies claimed he fondled Melinda as an infant, [[Sexual abuse|molested]] Marjorie's 13-year-old sister early in the marriage, and molested the girls' cousin Teddy from age 10 to 14. Both older girls said he molested them, though Melinda did not admit this ever happened to her. She slept in bed with him until he abandoned his family when she was 14. In court, Teddy described an incident in which Larry tied all three sisters in a garage and raped them in succession; however, the sisters did not confirm this account. Larry was [[emotional abuse|verbally abusive]] to his daughters and fired a handgun in Michelle's direction when she was seven, intentionally missing her. He would also embarrass his children by finding their underwear and smelling it in front of other family members.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 77–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

For two years, beginning when Melinda was five, the family was deeply involved in the Graceland [[Baptist]] Church. Larry and Marjorie gave full [[Confession (religion)|confession]] and renounced drinking and [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinging]] while they were members. Larry became a Baptist [[Laity|lay preacher]] and Marjorie became the school nurse. The church later arranged for Melinda to be taken to a motel room with a 50-year-old man for a five-hour [[exorcism]]. Larry became a [[marriage counseling|marriage counselor]] with the church and acquired a reputation for being too forward with women, eventually attempting to rape one of them. After that incident, the Loveless parents left the church and returned to their former professions, drinking, and open marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 78–85, 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1990, after Larry was caught spying on Melinda and a friend, Marjorie attacked him with a knife; he was sent to the hospital after he attempted to grab it. She then attempted suicide again, and her daughters called authorities. After this incident, Larry filed for [[divorce]] and moved to [[Avon Park, Florida|Avon Park]], [[Florida]]. Melinda felt crushed, especially when Larry remarried. He sent letters to her for a while, playing on her emotions, but eventually severed all contact with her.&lt;ref name="Jones, 110–117"/&gt;

===Laurie Tackett===
Mary Laurine "Laurie" Tackett was born in [[Madison, Indiana]], on October 5, 1974. Her mother was a fundamentalist [[Pentecostal]] Christian and her father was a factory worker with two [[felony]] convictions in the 1960s. Tackett claimed that she was molested at least twice as a child at ages 5 and 12. In May 1989, her mother discovered that Tackett was changing into jeans at school, and, after a confrontation that night, attempted to [[strangulation|strangle]] her. [[Social worker]]s became involved, and Tackett's parents agreed to unannounced visits to ensure that child abuse was not occurring.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 158–163.&lt;/ref&gt; Tackett and her mother came into periodic conflict; at one point, her mother went to Hope Rippey's house after learning that Rippey's father had purchased an [[Ouija board]] for the girls. She demanded that the board be burnt and that the Rippey house be exorcised.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 171–172.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tackett became increasingly rebellious after her fifteenth birthday and also became fascinated with the [[occult]]. She would often attempt to impress her friends by pretending to be possessed by the spirit of "Deanna the Vampire".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 164–167.&lt;/ref&gt; Tackett began to engage in [[self-harm]], especially after early 1991 when she began dating a girl who was involved in the practice. Her parents discovered the self-mutilation and checked her into a hospital on March 19, 1991. She was prescribed an [[anti-depressant]] and released. Two days later, with her girlfriend and Toni Lawrence, Tackett cut her wrists deeply and was returned to the hospital. After treatment of her wound, she was admitted to the hospital's psychiatric ward.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 174–178.&lt;/ref&gt; Tackett was diagnosed with [[borderline personality disorder]] and confessed that she had experienced [[hallucination]]s since she was a young child. She was discharged on April 12. She dropped out of high school in September 1991.&lt;ref name="Jones, pp. 179–188"&gt;Jones, pp. 179–188.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tackett stayed in Louisville in October 1991 to live with various friends. There she met Loveless; the two became friends in late November.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 154–158.&lt;/ref&gt; In December, Tackett moved back to Madison on the promise that her father would buy her a car. She still spent most of her time in Louisville and New Albany, and, by December, spent most of it with Loveless.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 188–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hope Rippey===
Hope Anna Rippey was born in Madison in June 1976. Her father was an engineer at a power plant. Her parents divorced in February 1984, and she moved with her mother and siblings to [[Quincy, Michigan|Quincy]], [[Michigan]], for three years. She claimed that living with her family in Michigan was somewhat turbulent. Her parents resumed their relationship in Madison in 1987. She was reunited with friends Tackett and Toni Lawrence, whom she had known since childhood, although her parents saw Tackett as a bad influence.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 168–171.&lt;/ref&gt; As with the other girls, Rippey began to self-harm at age 15.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toni Lawrence===
Toni Lawrence was born in Madison in February 1976. Her father was a [[boilermaker]]. She was close friends with Rippey from childhood. She was abused by a relative at age 9 and was raped by a teenage boy at age 14, although the police were only able to issue an order for the boy to keep away from Lawrence. She went into counseling after the incident but did not follow through. She became promiscuous, began to self-harm, and attempted suicide in eighth grade.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 172–174.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events prior to murder==
In 1990, 14-year-old Loveless began dating another young girl named Amanda Heavrin. After Loveless' father left the family and her mother remarried, Loveless behaved erratically. She got into fights at school and complained of depression, resulting in her receiving professional counseling. In March 1991, Loveless disclosed her [[lesbian]] orientation to her mother, who was initially furious but eventually accepted it. As the year progressed, Loveless' relationship with Heavrin deteriorated.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 123–124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavrin and Sharer met early in the fall semester at Hazelwood Junior High when they got into a fight; however, they became friends while in detention for the altercation, and later exchanged romantic letters. Loveless immediately grew jealous of Heavrin and Sharer's relationship. In early October 1991, Heavrin and Sharer attended a school dance, where Loveless found and confronted them. Although Heavrin and Loveless had never formally ended their relationship, Loveless started to date an older girl.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 138–141.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Heavrin and Sharer attended a festival together in late October, Loveless began to discuss killing Sharer and threatened her in public. Concerned about the effects of their daughter's relationship with Heavrin, Sharer's parents arranged for her to transfer to a Catholic school in late November.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 142–152.&lt;/ref&gt; Heavrin states she gave letters Loveless sent her containing death threats towards Sharer to a "youth prosecutor", but the youth prosecutor never did anything about it as far as she knew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6dwWPQQtdQ|title=Amanda Heavrin Speaks About Shanda Sharer - In Cold Blood: A Daughter's Brutal Murder|first=|last=TrueCrimeVideos|date=May 28, 2011|publisher=|accessdate=June 26, 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events of January 10–11, 1992==

===Pre-abduction===
On the night of January 10, 1992, Lawrence (age 15), Rippey (15), and Tackett (17) drove in Tackett's car from Madison to Loveless' house in New Albany. Lawrence, while a friend of Tackett, had not previously met Loveless (16), though Rippey had met her once before and had gotten along with her. Upon arrival, they borrowed some clothes from Loveless, and she showed them a knife, telling them she was going to scare Sharer with it. While Tackett, Rippey, and Lawrence had never met Sharer prior to that night, Tackett had already known of the plan to intimidate the 12-year-old girl. Loveless explained to the two other girls that she disliked Sharer for being a [[:wikt:copycat#Noun|copycat]] and for stealing her girlfriend.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tackett let Rippey drive the four girls to [[Jeffersonville, Indiana|Jeffersonville]], where Sharer stayed with her father on the weekends, stopping at a [[McDonald's]] restaurant ''en route'' to ask for directions. They arrived at Sharer's house shortly before dark. Loveless instructed Rippey and Lawrence to go to the door and introduce themselves as friends of Heavrin (Loveless' former and Sharer's current girlfriend), then invite Sharer to come with them to see Heavrin, who was waiting for them at "the Witch's Castle", or Mistletoe Falls, a ruined stone house located on an isolated hill overlooking the [[Ohio River]].

Sharer said that she could not go because her parents were awake, and she told the girls to come back around midnight, a few hours later.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Loveless was angry at first, but Rippey and Lawrence assured her about returning for Sharer later. The four girls crossed the river to Louisville and attended a [[punk rock]] show by the band Sunspring&lt;ref name="Quinlan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Quinlan|first=Michael|date=2012|title=Little Lost Angel|publisher=Gallery Books|isbn=978-1451698794}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Audubon Skate Park near [[Interstate 65]]. Lawrence and Rippey quickly lost interest in the music and went to the parking lot outside, where they engaged in sexual activities with two boys in Tackett's car.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the four girls left for Sharer's house. During the ride, Loveless said that she could not wait to kill Sharer; however, Loveless also said she just intended to use the knife to frighten her. When they arrived at Sharer's house at 12:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., Lawrence refused to retrieve Sharer, so Tackett and Rippey went to the door. Loveless hid under a blanket in the back seat of the car with the knife.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abduction===
Rippey told Sharer that Heavrin was still at the Witch's Castle. Sharer was reluctant to go with them, yet agreed after changing her clothes. As they got in the car, Rippey began questioning Sharer about her relationship with Heavrin. Loveless then sprang out from the back seat, put the knife to Sharer's throat and began interrogating her about her sexual relationship with Heavrin. They drove towards [[Utica, Indiana|Utica]] and the Witch's Castle. Tackett told the girls that a local legend said the house was once owned by nine witches and that townspeople burned down the house to get rid of the witches.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 19–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Witch's Castle, they took a sobbing Sharer inside and bound her arms and legs with rope. There, Loveless taunted that she had pretty hair and wondered how pretty she would look if they were to cut it off, which frightened Sharer even more. Loveless began taking off Sharer's rings and handed each to the girls. At some point, Rippey had taken Sharer's [[Mickey Mouse]] watch and danced to the tune it played. Tackett further taunted Sharer, claiming that the Witch's Castle was filled with human remains and Sharer's would be next. To further threaten Sharer, Tackett then retrieved from the car a shirt with a [[smiley]] design and lit it on fire, but immediately feared that the fire would be spotted by passing cars, so the girls left with Sharer. 

During the car ride, Sharer continued begging them to take her back home. Loveless ordered Sharer to slip off her bra, which she then handed over to Rippey, who slid off her own bra and replaced it with Sharer's while steering the car. They became lost, so they stopped at a gas station and covered Sharer in a blanket. While Tackett went inside to ask for directions, Lawrence called a boy she knew in Louisville and chatted for several minutes to ease her worries, but did not mention Sharer's abduction. They returned to the car but became lost again and pulled up to another gas station. There, Lawrence and Rippey spotted a couple of boys and talked to them before once again getting back into the car and leaving, arriving some time later at the edge of some woods near Tackett's home in Madison.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 21–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torture===
Tackett led them to a dark garbage dump off a logging road in a densely forested area. Lawrence and Rippey were frightened and stayed in the car. Loveless and Tackett made Sharer strip naked; then, Loveless beat Sharer with her fists. Next, Loveless repeatedly slammed Sharer's face into her knee, which cut Sharer's mouth on her own [[Dental braces|braces]]. Loveless tried to [[:wikt:slash#Verb|slash]] Sharer's throat, but the knife was too dull. Rippey came out of the car to hold down Sharer. Loveless and Tackett took turns stabbing Sharer in the chest. They then strangled Sharer with a rope until she was unconscious, placed her in the trunk of the car, and told the other two girls that Sharer was dead.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 24–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The girls drove to Tackett's nearby home and went inside to drink [[Soft drink|soda]] and clean themselves. When they heard Sharer screaming in the trunk, Tackett went out with a [[paring knife]] and stabbed her several more times, coming back a few minutes later covered with blood. After she washed, Tackett told the girls' futures with her "[[Lithomancy|runestones]]". At 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., Lawrence and Rippey stayed behind as Tackett and Loveless went "[[Rural area|country]] [[Cruising (driving)|cruising]]", driving to the nearby town of [[Canaan, Indiana|Canaan]]. Sharer continued to make crying and gurgling noises, so Tackett stopped the car. When they opened the trunk, Sharer sat up, covered in blood with her eyes rolled back in her head, but unable to speak. Tackett beat her with a [[tire iron]] until she was silent, and then told one of the other girls to "smell it".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 26–29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/young/shanda_sharer/1.html |title=Death of Innocence - The Murder of Young Shanda Sharer |last=Lohr |first=David |website=Crimelibrary.com |at=Chapter 9 Dead? |accessdate=August 24, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410230347/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/young/shanda_sharer/1.html |archivedate=April 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loveless and Tackett returned to Tackett's house just before daybreak to clean up again. Rippey asked about Sharer, and Tackett laughingly described the torture. The conversation woke up Tackett's mother, who yelled at her daughter for being out late and bringing home the girls, so Tackett agreed to take them home. She drove to the burn pile, where they opened the trunk to stare at Sharer. Lawrence refused. Rippey sprayed Sharer with [[Windex]] and taunted, "You're not looking so hot now, are you?"&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burned alive===
[[File:Shanda sharer field and memorial.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Sharer at the location where she died.]]
The girls drove to a gas station near [[Madison Consolidated High School]], pumped some gasoline into the car, and bought a two-liter bottle of [[Pepsi]]. Tackett poured out the Pepsi and refilled the bottle with gasoline. They drove north of Madison, past [[Jefferson Proving Ground]] to Lemon Road off [[U.S. Route 421]], a place known to Rippey. Lawrence remained in the car while Tackett and Rippey wrapped Sharer, who was still alive, in a blanket, and carried her to a field by the gravel country road. Tackett made Rippey pour the gasoline on Sharer, and then they set her on fire. Loveless was not convinced Sharer was dead, so they returned a few minutes later to pour the rest of the gasoline on her.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 31–34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Bob|title=Thinking the Unthinkable: What Led 4 Teens to Torture, Murder Child?|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-01-31/news/mn-1053_1_murder-child|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 31, 1993|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The girls went to a McDonald's restaurant at 9:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. for breakfast, where they laughed about Sharer's body looking like one of the sausages they were eating. Lawrence then phoned a friend and told her about the murder. Tackett then dropped off Lawrence and Rippey at their homes and finally returned to her own home with Loveless. She told Heavrin that they had killed Sharer and arranged to pick up Heavrin later that day.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

A friend of Loveless', Crystal Wathen, came over to Loveless' house, and they told her what had happened. Then, the three girls drove to pick up Heavrin and bring her back to Loveless' house, where they told Heavrin the story. Both Heavrin and Wathen were reluctant to believe the story until Tackett showed them the trunk of the car with Sharer's bloody handprints and socks still present. Heavrin was horrified and asked to be taken home. When they pulled up in front of her house, Loveless kissed Heavrin, told her she loved her, and pleaded with her not to tell anyone. Heavrin promised she would not before entering her house.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
Later on the morning of January 11, 1992, two brothers from Canaan were driving toward Jefferson Proving Ground to go hunting when they noticed a body on the side of the road. They called the police at 10:55&amp;nbsp;a.m. and were asked to return to the corpse. [[David Camm]], who was later [[acquittal|acquitted]] of his own family's murders, was one of the responding officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glatt|first=John|title=One Deadly Night|date=May 2005|publisher=St. Martin's Paperbacks |isbn=9780312993092}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jefferson County, Indiana|Jefferson County]] Sheriff Buck Shippley and detectives began an investigation, collecting [[Forensic science|forensic]] [[Real evidence|evidence]] at the scene. They initially suspected a drug deal gone wrong and did not believe the crime had been committed by locals.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 40–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharer's father Steven noticed his daughter was nowhere to be found early on January 11. After phoning neighbors and friends all morning, he called his former wife, Shanda's mother, at 1:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.; they met and filed a [[missing person]] report with the [[Clark County, Indiana|Clark County]] sheriff.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cj011392"&gt;{{cite news|title=Teen Girls Charged in Torture Slaying of New Albany Girl|last= Yetter| first= Deborah|date=January 13, 1992|newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]] |page=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 8:20&amp;nbsp;p.m., a hysterical Lawrence and Rippey went to the Jefferson County Sheriff's office with their parents. They both gave very rambling statements, identifying the victim as "Shanda", naming the two other girls involved as best as they could, and describing the main events of the previous night. Shippley contacted the Clark County sheriff and was finally able to match the body to Sharer's missing person report.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 44–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Detectives obtained [[dental records]] that positively identified Sharer as the victim.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Loveless and Tackett were arrested on January 12. The bulk of the evidence for the arrest warrant was Lawrence's and Rippey's statements. The [[prosecution]] immediately declared its intention to [[Trial|try]] both Loveless and Tackett [[Trial as an adult|as adults]]. For several months, the prosecutors and [[defense (law)|defense attorneys]] did not release any information about the case, giving the news media only the statements by Lawrence and Rippey.&lt;ref name="cj011392"/&gt;

All four girls were charged as adults. To avoid the [[death penalty]], the girls accepted [[plea bargain]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Mitigating factors===
All four girls had troubled backgrounds, with claims of [[Abuse#Physical abuse|physical]] or [[Abuse#Child sexual abuse|sexual]] abuse committed by a parent or other adult. Lawrence, Rippey, and Tackett all had histories of self-harming behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 172–178.&lt;/ref&gt; Tackett was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and suffering from hallucinations.&lt;ref name="Jones, pp. 179–188"/&gt; Loveless, often described as the ringleader in the attack,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MacDonald|first=Janelle|title=Judge denies Loveless' request for early release in torture-killing|url=http://www.wave3.com/story/7592498/judge-denies-loveless-request-for-early-release-in-torture-killing|publisher=[[WAVE (TV)|Wave 3 News]]|date=January 8, 2008|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; had the most extensive history of abuse and [[mental health]] issues.

===Sentences===
Tackett and Loveless were [[Sentence (law)|sentenced]] to sixty years in the [[Indiana Women's Prison]] in [[Indianapolis]]. Tackett was released in 2018, and is serving [[probation]] for one year since her release. Loveless is scheduled to be released in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Woman convicted in 1992 murder released from prison|publisher=[[WLKY]]|author=Courtney Shaw|date=January 11, 2018|url=http://www.wlky.com/article/monkeys-living-in-florida-park-may-carry-dangerous-form-of-herpes/15063633}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rippey was sentenced to sixty years, with ten years suspended for [[Mitigating factor|mitigating circumstances]], plus ten years of medium-supervision probation. On [[appeal]], a judge reduced the sentence to thirty-five years. In exchange for her cooperation, Lawrence was allowed to plead guilty to one count of criminal confinement and was sentenced to a maximum of twenty years.

===Appeals===
In October 2007, Loveless' [[Lawyer|attorney]], Mark Small, requested a hearing to argue for his client's release. He said that Loveless had been "profoundly retarded" by childhood abuse. Moreover, she had not been represented competently by [[counsel#North America|counsel]] during her sentencing, which caused her to accept a plea bargain in the face of exaggerated claims about her chances of receiving the death penalty. Small also argued that Loveless, who was 16 years old when she signed the plea agreement, was too young to enter into a [[contract]] in the state of Indiana without [[Parental consent|consent from a parent]] or [[Legal guardian|guardian]], which had not been obtained. If the judge accepted these arguments, Loveless could have been retried or released outright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mojica |first=Stephanie |title=Loveless seeks release from jail |url=http://www.newsandtribune.com/news/local_news/loveless-seeks-release-from-jail/article_16d1b388-ae2d-551d-b105-bc836f51d323.html |publisher=''[[The Tribune (New Albany)]]'' |date=October 14, 2007 |accessdate=February 28, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6fdzOF9qS?url=http://www.newsandtribune.com/news/local_news/loveless-seeks-release-from-jail/article_16d1b388-ae2d-551d-b105-bc836f51d323.html |archivedate=February 28, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 8, 2008, Loveless' request was rejected by Jefferson Circuit Judge Ted Todd. Instead, Loveless would be eligible for [[parole]] in fifteen years, thus maintaining the original guilty plea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Woman's torture-murder sentence stands |url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080109/LOCAL/801090482 |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=January 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130151351/http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080109%2FLOCAL%2F801090482 |archivedate=January 30, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 14, 2008, Loveless' appeal was denied by the [[Indiana Court of Appeals]], upholding Judge Todd's ruling.

===Incarceration===
{{as of|2018|df=US}}, Loveless is the only one of the four girls remaining in prison, scheduled for release in September 2019.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlky.com/article/woman-convicted-in-1992-murder-will-be-released/15055934|title=Woman convicted in 1992 murder released from prison|first=Courtney|last=Shaw|date=January 11, 2018|website=wlky.com|accessdate=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Releases===
Lawrence was released on December 14, 2000, after serving nine years. She remained on parole until December 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/young/shanda_sharer/1.html |title=Death of Innocence - The Murder of Young Shanda Sharer |last=Lohr |first=David |website=Crimelibrary.com |at=Chapter 17 Aftermath |accessdate=August 24, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410230347/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/young/shanda_sharer/1.html |archivedate=April 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 2006, Rippey was released from Indiana Women's Prison on parole after serving fourteen years of her original sentence. She remained on supervised parole for five years until April 2011.&lt;ref name="Lohr22"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/young/shanda_sharer/1.html |title=Death of Innocence - The Murder of Young Shanda Sharer |last=Lohr |first=David |website=Crimelibrary.com |at=Chapter 22 "She is just Evil" |accessdate=August 24, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410230347/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/young/shanda_sharer/1.html |archivedate=April 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tackett was released from [[Rockville Correctional Facility]] on January 11, 2018, the 26th anniversary of Sharer's death, after serving nearly twenty-six years. She is now serving a year of parole.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
During Loveless' sentencing [[Hearing (law)|hearing]], extensive [[open court]] testimony revealed that her father Larry had abused his wife, his daughters, and other children. Consequently, he was arrested in February 1993 on charges of rape, [[sodomy]], and [[sexual battery]]. Most of the crimes occurred from 1968 to 1977. Larry remained in prison for over two years awaiting trial; however, a judge eventually ruled that all charges except one count of sexual battery had to be dropped due to the [[statute of limitations]], which was five years in Indiana. Loveless pleaded guilty to the one count of sexual battery. He received a sentence of [[time served]] and was released in June 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fate Of Loveless Sex-Abuse Case Unclear Two Years After Arrest|last= Pillow| first=John C.|date=February 3, 1995|newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]]|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jailsuit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Inmates' Suit Nears Hearing|last= Pillow| first=John C.|date=June 21, 1995|newspaper=The Courier-Journal|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks following his release, Larry unsuccessfully sued the [[Floyd County, Indiana|Floyd County]] Jail for $39 million in [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal court]], alleging he had suffered [[cruel and unusual punishment]] during his two-year [[:wikt:incarceration#Noun|incarceration]]. Among his complaints were that he was not allowed to sleep in his bed during the day or to read the newspaper.&lt;ref name="jailsuit" /&gt;

Sharer's father, Steven Sharer, died of alcoholism in 2005 at the age of 53. He had become depressed following the death of his daughter, and so, according to his wife, "drank himself to death".&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;{{cite episode

The Shanda Sharer Scholarship Fund was established in January 2009. The fund plans to provide [[scholarship]]s to two students per year from [[Charles Allen Prosser School of Technology|Prosser School of Technology]] in New Albany; one scholarship will go to a student who is continuing his or her education, and the other scholarship will go to a student who is beginning his or her career and must buy tools or other work equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dunn|first=Trisha|title=New Albany memorial focuses on Shanda, not her murder|url=http://www.newsandtribune.com/news/new-albany-memorial-focuses-on-shanda-not-her-murder/article_6a68fd84-a325-5362-be18-59782d1685fe.html|work=[[News and Tribune]]|date=January 11, 2009|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the rules of the fund, the scholarship recipient will also be given a [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] or document of some type that tells Sharer's story.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In 2012, Sharer's mother, Jacque Vaught, made her first contact with Melinda Loveless since the trials, although indirectly. Vaught [[Donation|donated]] a dog for Loveless to train for the Indiana Canine Assistance Network program (ICAN), which provides [[Service animal|service pets]] to people with [[Disability|disabilities]]. Loveless has trained dogs for the program for several years. Vaught reported that she has endured criticism over the decision, but defends it saying, "It's my choice to make. She's (Shanda) my child. If you don't let good things come from bad things, nothing gets better. And I know what my child would want. My child would want this."

In an interview with Shanda Sharer's mother, Jacque Vaught, on the [[Investigation Discovery]] series ''[[Deadly Women]]'', Vaught stated that Sharer's father was so destroyed by his daughter's murder that he "did everything he could to kill himself besides put a gun to his head" and that he "drank himself to death. The man definitely died from a [[broken heart]]".&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt;

In 2011, ''[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]]'' aired a two-part series on the crime, which featured Shanda Sharer's mother and sister Paige, who both harshly confronted Hope Rippey on the show, and an interview with Amanda Heavrin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drphil.com/shows/show/1659|title=In Cold Blood: A Daughter's Brutal Murder|work=[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37964">'''Neurocomputational speech processing''' is computer-simulation of [[speech production]] and [[speech perception]] by referring to the natural neuronal processes of [[speech production]] and [[speech perception]], as they occur in the human [[nervous system]] ([[central nervous system]] and [[peripheral nervous system]]). This topic is based on [[neuroscience]] and [[computational neuroscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Rouat J, Loiselle S, Pichevar R (2007) Towards neurocomputational speech and sound processing. In: Sytylianou Y, Faundez-Zanuy M, Esposito A. ''Progress in Nonlinear Speech Processing'' (Springer, Berlin) pp. 58-77. [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1768230 ACMDL]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Neurocomputational models of speech processing are complex. They comprise at least a [[cognition|cognitive part]], a [[motor system|motor part]] and a [[sensory system|sensory part]].

The cognitive or linguistic part of a neurocomputational model of speech processing comprises the neural activation or generation of a [[phonology|phonemic representation]] on the side of [[speech production]] (e.g. neurocomputational and extended version of the Levelt model developed by Ardi Roelofs:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nici.kun.nl/~ardiroel/home.htm Ardi Roelofs]&lt;/ref&gt;  WEAVER++&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nici.ru.nl/~ardiroel/weaver++.htm WEAVER++]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the neural activation or generation of an intention or meaning on the side of [[speech perception]] or [[Reading comprehension|speech comprehension]].

The [[motor system|motor part]] of a neurocomputational model of speech processing starts with a [[Phonemic|phonemic representation]] of a speech item, activates a motor plan and ends with the [[Manner of articulation|articulation]] of that particular speech item (see also: [[articulatory phonetics]]).

The [[Sensory system|sensory part]] of a neurocomputational model of speech processing starts with an acoustic signal of a speech item ([[acoustic phonetics|acoustic speech signal]]), generates an [[auditory phonetics|auditory representation]] for that signal and activates a [[Phonemic|phonemic representations]] for that speech item.

== Neurocomputational speech processing topics ==
Neurocomputational speech processing is speech processing by [[artificial neural networks]]. Neural maps, mappings and pathways as described below, are model structures, i.e. important structures within artificial neural networks.

=== Neural maps ===
[[Image:2D neuronal map.jpg|thumb|300px|Fig. 1: 2D neuronal map with a local activation pattern. magenta: neuron with highest degree of activation; blue: neurons with no activation]]
An artificial neural network can be separated in three types of neural maps, also called "layers":
# input maps (in the case of speech processing: primary auditory map within the [[auditory cortex]], primary somatosensory map within the [[somatosensory cortex]]), 
# output maps (primary motor map within the primary [[motor cortex]]), and 
# higher level cortical maps (also called "hidden layers").

The term "neural map" is favoured here over the term "neural layer", because a cortial neural map should be modeled as a 2D-map of interconnected neurons (e.g. like a [[self-organizing map]]; see also Fig. 1). Thus, each "model neuron" or "[[artificial neuron]]" within this 2D-map is physiologically represented by a [[cortical column]] since the [[cerebral cortex]] anatomically exhibits a layered structure.

=== Neural representations (neural states) ===
A neural representation within an [[artificial neural network]] is a temporarily activated (neural) state within a specific neural map. Each neural state is represented by a specific neural activation pattern. This activation pattern changes during speech processing (e.g. from syllable to syllable).

[[Image:2D neural map spectrogram.jpg|thumb|300px|Fig. 2: 2D neuronal map with a distributed activation pattern. Example: "neural [[spectrogram]]" (This auditory neural representation is speculative; see ACT model, below)]]
In the ACT model (see below), it is assumed that an auditory state can be represented by a "neural [[spectrogram]]" (see Fig. 2) within an auditory state map. This auditory state map is assumed to be located in the auditory association cortex (see [[cerebral cortex]]).

A somatosensory state can be divided in a [[Touch|tactile]] and [[proprioception|proprioceptive state]] and can be represented by a specific neural activation pattern within the somatosensory state map. This state map is assumed to be located in the somatosensory association cortex (see [[cerebral cortex]], [[somatosensory system]], [[somatosensory cortex]]).

A motor plan state can be assumed for representing a motor plan, i.e. the planning of speech articulation for a specific syllable or for a longer speech item (e.g. word, short phrase). This state map is assumed to be located in the [[premotor cortex]], while the instantaneous (or lower level) activation of each speech articulator occurs within the [[primary motor cortex]] (see [[motor cortex]]).

The neural representations occurring in the sensory and motor maps (as introduced above) are distributed representations (Hinton et al. 1968&lt;ref&gt;Hinton GE, McClelland JL, Rumelhart DE (1968) Distributed representations. In: Rumelhart DE, McClelland JL (eds.). ''Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition''. Volume 1: Foundations (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA)&lt;/ref&gt;): Each neuron within the sensory or motor map is more or less activated, leading to a specific activation pattern.

The neural representation for speech units occurring in the speech sound map (see below: DIVA model) is a punctual or local representation. Each speech item or speech unit is represented here by a specific [[neuron]] (model cell, see below).

=== Neural mappings (synaptic projections) ===
[[Image:Neural mapping phonetic to sensorimotor maps.jpg|thumb|300px|Fig. 3: Neural mapping between phonetic map (local activation pattern for a specific phonetic state), motor plan state map (distributed activation pattern) and auditory state map (distributed activation pattern) as part of the ACT model. Only neural connections with the winner neuron within the phonetic map are shown]]
A neural mapping connects two cortical neural maps. Neural mappings (in contrast to neural pathways) store training information by adjusting their neural link weights (see [[artificial neuron]], [[artificial neural networks]]). Neural mappings are capable of generating or activating a distributed representation (see above) of a sensory or motor state within a sensory or motor map from a punctual or local activation within the other map (see for example the synaptic projection from speech sound map to motor map, to auditory target region map, or to somatosensory target region map in the DIVA model, explained below; or see for example the neural mapping from phonetic map to auditory state map and motor plan state map in the ACT model, explained below and Fig. 3).

Neural mapping between two neural maps are compact or dense: Each neuron of one neural map is interconnected with (nearly) each neuron of the other neural map (many-to-many-connection, see [[artificial neural networks]]). Because of this density criterion for neural mappings, neural maps which are interconnected by a neural mapping are not far apart from each other.

=== Neural pathways ===
In contrast to neural mappings [[neural pathway]]s can connect neural maps which are far apart (e.g. in different cortical lobes, see [[cerebral cortex]]). From the functional or modeling viewpoint, neural pathways mainly forward information without processing this information. A neural pathway in comparison to a neural mapping need much less neural connections. A neural pathway can be modelled by using a one-to-one connection of the neurons of both neural maps (see [[topographic map]]ping and see [[somatotopic arrangement]]).

Example: In the case of two neural maps, each comprising 1,000 model neurons, a neural mapping needs up to 1,000,000 neural connections (many-to-many-connection), while only 1,000 connections are needed in the case of a neural pathway connection.

Furthermore the link weights of the connections within a neural mapping are adjusted during training, while the neural connections in the case of a neural pathway need not to be trained (each connection is maximal exhibitory).

== DIVA model ==
The leading approach in neurocomputational modeling of speech production is the DIVA model developed by [[Frank H. Guenther]] and his group at Boston University.&lt;ref&gt;DIVA model: a model of speech production, focussing on feedback control processes, developed by [http://cns.bu.edu/~guenther/ Frank H. Guenther and his group at Boston University, MA, USA]. The term "DIVA" refers to "Directions Into Velocities of Articulators"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guenther, F.H., Ghosh, S.S., and Tourville, J.A. (2006) [http://cns.bu.edu/~guenther/Guenther_et_al_Brain-Lang_2005.pdf pdf]. Neural modeling and imaging of the cortical interactions underlying syllable production. ''Brain and Language'', 96, pp.&amp;nbsp;280–301&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guenther FH (2006) Cortical interaction underlying the production of speech sounds. ''Journal of Communication Disorders'' 39, 350–365&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guenther, F.H., and Perkell, J.S. (2004) [http://cns.bu.edu/~guenther/SMC_2001_Book_Chapter.pdf pdf].  A neural model of speech production and its application to studies of the role of auditory feedback in speech. In: B. Maassen, R. Kent, H. Peters, P. Van Lieshout, and W. Hulstijn (eds.), ''Speech Motor Control in Normal and Disordered Speech'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;29–49). Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The model accounts for a wide range of [[phonetic]] and [[neuroimaging]] data but - like each neurocomputational model - remains speculative to some extent.

=== Structure of the model ===
[[Image:DivaBlock2.jpg|thumb|300px|Fig. 4: Organization of the DIVA model; This figure is an adaptation following Guenther et al. 2006]] 
The organization or structure of the DIVA model is shown in Fig. 4.

==== Speech sound map: the phonemic representation as a starting point ====
The speech sound map - assumed to be located in the inferior and posterior portion of [[Broca's area]] (left frontal operculum) - represents (phonologically specified) language-specific speech units (sounds, syllables, words, short phrases). Each speech unit (mainly syllables; e.g. the syllable and word "palm" /pam/, the syllables /pa/, /ta/, /ka/, ...) is represented by a specific model cell within the speech sound map (i.e. punctual neural representations, see above). Each model cell (see [[artificial neuron]]) corresponds to a small population of neurons which are located at close range and which fire together.

==== Feedforward control: activating motor representations ====
Each neuron (model cell, [[artificial neuron]]) within the speech sound map can be activated and subsequently activates a forward motor command towards the motor map, called articulatory velocity and position map. The activated neural representation  on the level of that motor map determines the articulation of a speech unit, i.e. controls all articulators (lips, tongue, velum, glottis) during the time interval for producing that speech unit. Forward control also involves subcortical structures like the [[cerebellum]], not modelled in detail here.

A speech ''unit'' represents an amount of speech ''items'' which can be assigned to the same phonemic category. Thus, each speech unit is represented by one specific neuron within the speech sound map, while the realization of a speech unit may exhibit some articulatory and acoustic variability. This phonetic variability is the motivation to define sensory target ''regions'' in the DIVA model (see Guenther et al. 1998&lt;ref&gt;Guenther, F.H., Hampson, M., and Johnson, D. (1998) A theoretical investigation of reference frames for the planning of speech movements. ''Psychological Review'' 105: 611-633&lt;/ref&gt;).

==== Articulatory model: generating somatosensory and auditory feedback information ====
The activation pattern within the motor map determines the movement pattern of all model articulators (lips, tongue, velum, glottis) for a speech item. In order not to overload the model, no detailed modeling of the [[Neuromuscular junction|neuromuscular system]] is done. The [[articulatory synthesis|Maeda articulatory speech synthesizer]] is used in order to generate articulator movements, which allows the generation of a time-varying [[vocal tract|vocal tract form]] and the generation of the [[acoustic phonetics|acoustic speech signal]] for each particular speech item.

In terms of [[artificial intelligence]] the articulatory model can be called plant (i.e. the system, which is controlled by the brain); it represents a part of the [[Embodied cognition|embodiement]] of the neuronal speech processing system. The articulatory model generates [[Sensory system|sensory output]] which is the basis for generating feedback information for the DIVA model (see below: feedback control).

==== Feedback control: sensory target regions, state maps, and error maps ====
On the one hand the articulatory model generates [[Sensory system|sensory information]], i.e. an auditory state for each speech unit which is neurally represented within the auditory state map (distributed representation), and a somatosensory state for each speech unit which is neurally represented within the somatosensory state map (distributed representation as well). The auditory state map is assumed to be located in the [[temporal cortex|superior temporal cortex]] while the somatosensory state map is assumed to  be located in the [[parietal cortex|inferior parietal cortex]].

On the other hand the speech sound map, if activated for a specific speech unit (single neuron activation; punctual activation), activates sensory information by synaptic projections between speech sound map and auditory target region map and between speech sound map and somatosensory target region map. Auditory and somatosensory target regions are assumed to be located in [[auditory cortex|higher-order auditory cortical regions]] and in [[somatosensory cortex|higher-order somatosensory cortical regions]] respectively. These target region sensory activation patterns - which exist for each speech unit - are learned during [[Language acquisition|speech acquisition]] (by imitation training; see below: learning).

Consequently two types of sensory information are available if a speech unit is activated at the level of the speech sound map: (i) learned sensory target regions (i.e. ''intended'' sensory state for a speech unit) and (ii) sensory state activation patterns resulting from a possibly imperfect execution (articulation) of a specific speech unit (i.e. ''current'' sensory state, reflecting the current production and articulation of that particular speech unit). Both types of sensory information is projected to sensory error maps, i.e. to an auditory error map which is assumed to be located in the [[temporal cortex|superior temporal cortex]] (like the auditory state map) and to a somatosensosry error map which is assumed to be located in the [[parietal cortex|inferior parietal cortex]] (like the somatosensory state map) (see Fig. 4).

If the current sensory state deviates from the intended sensory state, both error maps are generating feedback commands which are projected towards the motor map and which are capable to correct the motor activation pattern and subsequently the articulation of a speech unit under production. Thus, in total, the activation pattern of the motor map is not only influenced by a specific feedforward command learned for a speech unit (and generated by the synaptic projection from the speech sound map) but also by a feedback command generated at the level of the sensory error maps (see Fig. 4).

=== Learning (modeling speech acquisition) ===
While the ''structure'' of a neuroscientific model of speech processing (given in Fig. 4 for the DIVA model) is mainly determined by [[Evolution|evolutionary processes]], the (language-specific) ''knowledge'' as well as the (language-specific) ''speaking skills'' are learned and trained  during [[Language acquisition|speech acquisition]]. In the case of the DIVA model it is assumed that the newborn has not available an already structured (language-specific) speech sound map; i.e. no neuron within the speech sound map is related to any speech unit. Rather the organization of the speech sound map as well as the tuning of the projections to the motor map and to the sensory target region maps is learned or trained during speech acquisition. Two important phases of early speech acquisition are modeled in the DIVA approach: Learning by [[babbling]] and by [[imitation]].

==== Babbling ====
During [[babbling]] the synaptic projections between sensory error maps and motor map are tuned. This training is done by generating an amount of semi-random feedforward commands, i.e. the DIVA model "babbles". Each of these babbling commands leads to the production of an "articulatory item", also labeled as "pre-linguistic (i.e. non language-specific) speech item" (i.e. the articulatory model generates an articulatory movement pattern on the basis of the babbling motor command). Subsequently an acoustic signal is generated.

On the basis of the articulatory and acoustic signal, a specific auditory and somatosensory state pattern is activated at the level of the sensory state maps (see Fig. 4) for each (pre-linguistic) speech item. At this point the DIVA model has available  the sensory and associated motor activation pattern for different speech items, which enables the model to tune the synaptic projections between sensory error maps and motor map. Thus, during babbling the DIVA model learns feedback commands (i.e. how to produce a proper (feedback) motor command for a specific sensory input).

==== Imitation ====
During [[imitation]] the DIVA model organizes its speech sound map and tunes the synaptic projections between speech sound map and motor map - i.e. tuning of forward motor commands - as well as the synaptic projections between speech sound map and sensory target regions (see Fig. 4). Imitation training is done by exposing the model to an amount of acoustic speech signals representing realizations of language-specific speech units (e.g. isolated speech sounds, syllables, words, short phrases).

The tuning of the synaptic projections between speech sound map and auditory target region map is accomplished by assigning one neuron of the speech sound map to the phonemic representation of that speech item and by associating it with the auditory representation of that speech item, which is activated at the auditory target region map. Auditory ''regions'' (i.e. a specification of the auditory variability of a speech unit) occur, because one specific speech unit (i.e. one specific phonemic representation) can be realized by several (slightly) different acoustic (auditory) realizations (for the difference between speech ''item'' and speech ''unit'' see above: feedforward control) .

The tuning of the synaptic projections between speech sound map and motor map (i.e. tuning of forward motor commands) is accomplished with the aid of feedback commands, since the projections between sensory error maps and motor map were already tuned during babbling training (see above). Thus the DIVA model tries to "imitate" an auditory speech item by attempting to find a proper feedforward motor command. Subsequently the model compares the resulting sensory output (''current'' sensory state following the articulation of that attempt) with the already learned auditory target region (''intended'' sensory state) for that speech item. Then the model updates the current feedforward motor command by the current feedback motor command generated from the auditory error map of the auditory feedback system. This process may be repeated several times (several attempts). The DIVA model is capable of producing the speech item with a decreasing auditory difference between current and intended auditory state from attempt to attempt.

During imitation the DIVA model is also capable of tuning the synaptic projections from speech sound map to somatosensory target region map, since each new imitation attempt produces a new articulation of the speech item and thus produces a [[somatosensory]] state pattern which is associated with the phonemic representation of that speech item.

=== Perturbation experiments ===

==== Real-time perturbation of F1: the influence of auditory feedback ====
While auditory feedback is most important during speech acquisition, it may be activated less if the model has learned a proper feedforward motor command for each speech unit. But it has been shown that auditory feedback needs to be strongly coactivated in the case of auditory perturbation (e.g. shifting a formant frequency, Tourville et al. 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Tourville J, Guenther F, Ghosh S, Reilly K, Bohland J, Nieto-Castanon A (2005) Effects of acoustic and articulatory perturbation on cortical activity during speech production. ''Poster, 11th annual meeting of the Organization of Human Brain Mapping'' (Toronto, Canada)&lt;/ref&gt; This is comparable to the strong influence of visual feedback on reaching movements during visual perturbation (e.g. shifting the location of objects by viewing through a [[Prism (optics)|prism]]).

==== Unexpected blocking of the jaw: the influence of somatosensory feedback ====
In a comparable way to auditory feedback, also somatosensory feedback can be strongly coactivated during speech production, e.g. in the case of unexpected blocking of the jaw (Tourville et al. 2005).

== ACT model ==
A further approach in neurocomputational modeling of speech processing is the ACT model developed by [[Bernd J. Kröger]] and his group&lt;ref&gt;ACT model: A model of speech production, perception, and acquisition, developed by [http://www.phonetik.phoniatrie.rwth-aachen.de/bkroeger/ Bernd J. Kröger and his group at RWTH Aachen University, Germany]. The term "ACT" refers to the term "ACTion"&lt;/ref&gt; at [[RWTH Aachen University]], Germany (Kröger et al. 2014,&lt;ref&gt;BJ Kröger, J Kannampuzha, E Kaufmann (2014) [http://www.phonetik.phoniatrie.rwth-aachen.de/bkroeger/documents/Kroeger_2014_EPJNBP.pdf pdf] Associative learning and self-organization as basic principles for simulating speech acquisition, speech production, and speech perception. EPJ Nonlinear Biomedical Physics 2 (1), 1-28&lt;/ref&gt; Kröger et al. 2009,&lt;ref&gt;Kröger BJ, Kannampuzha J, Neuschaefer-Rube C (2009) [http://www.phonetik.phoniatrie.rwth-aachen.de/bkroeger/documents/Kroeger_etal_2009.pdf pdf] Towards a neurocomputational model of speech production and perception. ''Speech Communication'' 51: 793-809&lt;/ref&gt; Kröger et al. 2011&lt;ref&gt;Kröger BJ, Birkholz P, Neuschaefer-Rube C (2011) Towards an articulation-based developmental robotics approach for word processing in face-to-face communication. ''PALADYN Journal of Behavioral Robotics'' 2: 82-93. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/p631tn8375253486/ DOI]&lt;/ref&gt;). The ACT model is in accord with the DIVA model in large parts. The ACT model focuses on the "[[Motor goal|action]] repository" (i.e. [[Long-term memory|repository]] for [[motor skills|sensorimotor speaking skills]], comparable to the mental syllablary, see Levelt and Wheeldon 1994&lt;ref&gt;Levelt, W.J.M., Wheeldon, L. (1994) Do speakers have access to a mental syllabary? ''Cognition'' 50, 239–269&lt;/ref&gt;), which is not spelled out in detail in the DIVA model. Moreover the ACT model explicitly introduces a level of [[motor goal|motor plans]], i.e. a high-level motor description for the production of speech items (see [[motor goals]], [[motor cortex]]). The ACT model - like any neurocomputational model - remains speculative to some extent.

=== Structure ===
[[Image:Structure of the ACT model.jpg|thumb|300px|Fig. 5: Organization of the ACT model]]
The organization or structure of the ACT model is given in Fig. 5.

For [[speech production]], the ACT model starts with the activation of a [[Phonemic|phonemic representation]] of a speech item (phonemic map). In the case of a ''frequent [[syllable]]'', a co-activation occurs at the level of the [[Phonetics|phonetic map]], leading to a further co-activation of the intended sensory state at the level of the [[sensory system|sensory state maps]] and to a co-activation of a [[motor system|motor plan state]] at the level of the motor plan map. In the case of an ''infrequent syllable'', an attempt for a [[motor goal|motor plan]] is generated by the motor planning module for that speech item by activating motor plans for phonetic similar speech items via the phonetic map (see Kröger et al. 2011&lt;ref&gt;Kröger BJ, Miller N, Lowit A, Neuschaefer-Rube C. (2011) Defective neural motor speech mappings as a source for apraxia of speech: Evidence from a quantitative neural model of speech processing. In: Lowit A, Kent R (eds.) Assessment of Motor Speech Disorders. (Plural Publishing, San Diego, CA) pp. 325-346&lt;/ref&gt;). The [[motor goal|motor plan]] or vocal tract action score comprises temporally overlapping vocal tract actions, which are programmed and subsequently executed by the [[motor program|motor programming, execution, and control module]]. This module gets real-time somatosensory feedback information for controlling the correct execution of the (intended) motor plan. [[Motor program]]ing leads to activation pattern at the level lof the [[primary motor cortex|primary motor map]] and subsequently activates [[Neuromuscular junction|neuromuscular processing]]. [[Motoneuron|Motoneuron activation patterns]] generate [[Muscle|muscle forces]] and subsequently movement patterns of all [[articulatory phonetics|model articulators]] (lips, tongue, velum, glottis). The [[articulatory synthesis|Birkholz 3D articulatory synthesizer]] is used in order to generate the [[acoustic phonetics|acoustic speech signal]].

[[Articulatory phonetics|Articulatory]] and [[Acoustic phonetics|acoustic]] feedback signals are used for generating [[somatosensory]] and [[Auditory system|auditory feedback information]] via the sensory preprocessing modules, which is forwarded towards the auditory and somatosensory map. At the level of the sensory-phonetic processing modules, auditory and somatosensory information is stored in [[short-term memory]] and the external sensory signal (ES, Fig. 5, which are activated via the sensory feedback loop) can be compared with the already trained sensory signals (TS, Fig. 5, which are activated via the phonetic map). Auditory and somatosensory error signals can be generated if external and intended (trained) sensory signals are noticeably different (cf. DIVA model).

The light green area in Fig. 5 indicates those neural maps and processing modules, which process a [[syllable]] as a whole unit (specific processing time window around 100&amp;nbsp;ms and more). This processing comprises the phonetic map and the directly connected sensory state maps within the sensory-phonetic processing modules and the directly connected motor plan state map, while the primary motor map as well as the (primary) auditory and (primary) somatosensory map process smaller time windows (around 10&amp;nbsp;ms in the ACT model).

[[Image:Brain regions of maps of the ACT model.jpg|thumb|300px|Fig. 6: Hypothetical location of brain regions for neural maps of the ACT model]]
The hypothetical [[Motor cortex|cortical location]] of neural maps within the ACT model is shown in Fig. 6. The hypothetical locations of primary motor and primary sensory maps are given in magenta, the hypothetical locations of motor plan state map and sensory state maps (within sensory-phonetic processing module, comparable to the error maps in DIVA) are given in orange, and the hypothetical locations for the [[mirror neuron|mirrored]] phonetic map is given in red. Double arrows indicate neuronal mappings. Neural mappings connect neural maps, which are not far apart from each other (see above). The two [[mirror neuron|mirrored]] locations of the phonetic map are connected via a neural pathway (see above), leading to a (simple) one-to-one mirroring of the current activation pattern for both realizations of the phonetic map. This neural pathway between the two locations of the phonetic map is assumed to be a part of the [[fasciculus arcuatus]] (AF, see Fig. 5 and Fig. 6).

For [[speech perception]], the model starts with an external acoustic signal (e.g. produced by an external speaker). This signal is preprocessed, passes the auditory map, and leads to an activation pattern for each syllable or word on the level of the auditory-phonetic processing module (ES: external signal, see Fig. 5). The ventral path of speech perception (see Hickok and Poeppel 2007&lt;ref&gt;Hickok G, Poeppel D (2007) Towards a functional neuroanatomy of speech perception. ''Trends in Cognitive Sciences'' 4, 131–138&lt;/ref&gt;) would directly activate a lexical item, but is not implemented in ACT. Rather, in ACT the activation of a phonemic state occurs via the phonemic map and thus may lead to a coactivation of motor representations for that speech item (i.e. dorsal pathway of speech perception; ibid.).

==== Action repository ====
[[Image:Phonetic Map Link Weights.jpg|thumb|300px|Fig. 7: Visualization of synaptic link weights for a section of the phonetic map, trained for the 200 most frequent syllables of Standard German. Each box represents a neuron within the [[self-organizing map|self-organizing]] phonetic map. Each of the three link weight representations refers to the same section within the phonetic map and thus refers to the same 10×10 neurons]]
The phonetic map together with the motor plan state map, sensory state maps (occurring within the sensory-phonetic processing modules), and phonemic (state) map form the action repository. The phonetic map is implemented in ACT as a [[self-organizing map|self-organizing neural map]] and different speech items are represented by different neurons within this map (punctual or local representation, see above: neural representations). The phonetic map exhibits three major characteristics: 
* More than one [[Phonetics|phonetic realization]] may occur within the phonetic map for one [[Phonemic|phonemic state]] (see phonemic link weights in Fig. 7: e.g. the syllable /de:m/ is represented by three neurons within the phonetic map)
* [[Phonetotopy]]: The phonetic map exhibits an ordering of speech items with respect to different [[Phonetics|phonetic features]] (see phonemic link weights in Fig. 7. Three examples: (i) the syllables /p@/, /t@/, and /k@/ occur in an upward ordering at the left side within the phonetic map; (ii) syllable-initial plosives occur in the upper left part of the phonetic map while syllable initial fricatives occur in  the lower right half; (iii) CV syllables and CVC syllables as well occur in different areas of the phonetic map.).
* The phonetic map is hypermodal or [[multimodal interaction|multimodal]]: The activation of a phonetic item at the level of the phonetic map coactivates (i) a phonemic state (see phonemic link weights in Fig. 7), (ii) a motor plan state (see motor plan link weights in Fig. 7), (iii) an auditory state (see auditory link weights in Fig. 7), and (iv) a somatosensory state (not shown in Fig. 7). All these states are learned or trained during speech acquisition by tuning the synaptic link weights between each neuron within the phonetic map, representing a particular phonetic state and all neurons within the associated motor plan and sensory state maps (see also Fig. 3).
The phonetic map implements the [[Action-Specific Perception|action-perception-link]] within the ACT model (see also Fig. 5 and Fig. 6: the dual neural representation of the phonetic map in the [[frontal lobe]] and at the intersection of [[temporal lobe]] and [[parietal lobe]]).

==== Motor plans ====
A motor plan is a high level motor description for the production and articulation of a speech items (see [[motor goals]], [[motor skills]], [[articulatory phonetics]], [[articulatory phonology]]). In our neurocomputational model ACT a motor plan is quantified as a vocal tract action score. Vocal tract action scores quantitatively determine the number of vocal tract actions (also called articulatory gestures), which need to be activated in order to produce a speech item, their degree of realization and duration, and the temporal organization of all vocal tract actions building up a speech item (for a detailed description of vocal tract actions scores see e.g. Kröger &amp; Birkholz 2007).&lt;ref&gt;Kröger BJ, Birkholz P (2007) A gesture-based concept for speech movement control in articulatory speech synthesis. In: Esposito A, Faundez-Zanuy M, Keller E, Marinaro M (eds.) ''Verbal and Nonverbal Communication Behaviours, LNAI 4775'' (Springer Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg) pp. 174-189&lt;/ref&gt; The detailed realization of each vocal tract action (articulatory gesture) depends on the temporal organization of all vocal tract actions building up a speech item and especially on their temporal overlap. Thus the detailed realization of each vocal tract action within an speech item is specified below the motor plan level in our neurocomputational model ACT (see Kröger et al. 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Kröger BJ, Birkholz P, Kannampuzha J, Eckers C, Kaufmann E, Neuschaefer-Rube C (2011) Neurobiological interpretation of a quantitative target approximation model for speech actions. In: Kröger BJ, Birkholz P (eds.) ''Studientexte zur Sprachkommunikation: Elektronische Sprachsignalverarbeitung 2011'' (TUDpress, Dresden, Germany), pp. 184-194&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Integrating sensorimotor and cognitive aspects: the coupling of action repository and mental lexicon ===
A severe problem of phonetic or sensorimotor models of speech processing (like DIVA or ACT) is that the development of the [[Phonemic|phonemic map]] during speech acquisition is not modeled. A possible solution of this problem could be a direct coupling of action repository and mental lexicon without explicitly introducing a phonemic map at the beginning of speech acquisition (even at the beginning of imitation training; see Kröger et al. 2011 PALADYN Journal of Behavioral Robotics).

=== Experiments: speech acquisition ===
A very important issue for all neuroscientific or neurocomputational approaches is to separate structure and knowledge. While the structure of the model (i.e. of the human neuronal network, which is needed for processing speech) is mainly determined by [[Evolution|evolutionary processes]], the knowledge is gathered mainly during [[Language acquisition|speech acquisition]] by processes of [[learning]]. Different learning experiments were carried out with the model ACT in order to learn (i) a five-vowel system /i, e, a, o, u/ (see Kröger et al. 2009), (ii) a small consonant system (voiced plosives /b, d, g/ in combination with all five vowels acquired earlier as CV syllables (ibid.), (iii) a small model language comprising the five-vowel system, voiced and unvoiced plosives /b, d, g, p, t, k/, nasals /m, n/ and the lateral /l/ and three syllable types (V, CV, and CCV) (see Kröger et al. 2011)&lt;ref&gt;Kröger BJ, Miller N, Lowit A, Neuschaefer-Rube C. (2011) Defective neural motor speech mappings as a source for apraxia of speech: Evidence from a quantitative neural model of speech processing. In: Lowit A, Kent R (eds.) ''Assessment of Motor Speech Disorders.'' (Plural Publishing, San Diego, CA) pp. 325-346&lt;/ref&gt; and (iv) the 200 most frequent syllables of Standard German for a 6 year old child (see Kröger et al. 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Kröger BJ, Birkholz P, Kannampuzha J, Kaufmann E, Neuschaefer-Rube C (2011) Towards the acquisition of a sensorimotor vocal tract action repository within a neural model of speech processing. In: Esposito A, Vinciarelli A, Vicsi K, Pelachaud C, Nijholt A (eds.) ''Analysis of Verbal and Nonverbal Communication and Enactment: The Processing Issues.'' LNCS 6800 (Springer, Berlin), pp. 287-293&lt;/ref&gt; In all cases, an ordering of phonetic items with respect to different phonetic features can be observed.

=== Experiments: speech perception ===
Despite the  fact that the ACT model in its earlier versions was designed as a pure speech production model (including speech acquisition), the model is capable of exhibiting important basic phenomena of speech perception, i.e. categorical perception and the McGurk effect. In the case of [[categorical perception]], the model is able to exhibit that categorical perception is stronger in the case of plosives than in the case of vowels (see Kröger et al. 2009). Furthermore the model ACT was able to exhibit the [[McGurk effect]], if a specific mechanism of inhibition of neurons of the level of the phonetic map was implemented (see Kröger and Kannampuzha 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Kröger BJ, Kannampuzha J (2008) A neurofunctional model of speech production including aspects of auditory and audio-visual speech perception. ''Proceedings of the International Conference on Audio-Visual Speech Processing 2008'' (Moreton Island, Queensland, Australia) pp. 83–88&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pokémon X''''' and '''''Y'''''{{efn|{{Nihongo|''Pokémon X'' and ''Y''|ポケットモンスター X・Y|Poketto Monsutā Ekkusu &amp; Wai|"Pocket Monsters: X &amp; Y"|lead=yes}}}} are [[role-playing video game]]s (RPGs) developed by [[Game Freak]], published by [[The Pokémon Company]] and [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo 3DS]]. They are the first installments in the [[Pokémon#Generation 6|sixth generation]] of the main ''[[Pokémon (video game series)|Pokémon]]'' RPG series. First announced in January 2013 by former Nintendo president [[Satoru Iwata]] through a special [[Nintendo Direct]], both ''Pokémon X'' and ''Pokémon Y'' were released worldwide in October 2013, making them the first Nintendo-published retail games to have a simultaneous global release in all key regions.

As with previous installments, both games follow the journey of a young Pokémon trainer (and the trainer's friends) as they train Pokémon. This time, the games take place in the Kalos region—based on France—with the objective being to thwart the schemes of the nefarious criminal organization Team Flare, all while attempting to challenge the Pokémon League Champion. ''X'' and ''Y'' introduced [[List of generation VI Pokémon|72 new Pokémon species]], and includes new features such as the new Fairy type, character customization, updated battle and training mechanics, and completely rendered [[Polygonal modeling|polygonal 3D graphics]] (as opposed to the [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] used in previous generations). A new form of Pokémon evolution, known as "Mega Evolution," allows players to further evolve many species of fully evolved Pokémon, with 30 of these evolutions currently available. Both titles are independent of each other, but feature largely the same plot, and while either can be played separately, trading Pokémon between the two games is, as with past titles, necessary in order for a player to obtain every Pokémon species.

''X'' and ''Y'' received positive reviews from critics, who praised the advancements in the gameplay and innovations that the developers brought to the franchise. The games' visuals and transition to 3D models were well-received by critics; however, the story was regarded as poor for an RPG title. The highly anticipated games were a commercial success, selling four million copies worldwide in the first weekend, beating [[Pokémon Black and White|''Black'' and ''White'']]'s record and making them the fastest-selling games on the 3DS. As of September 30, 2018, a combined 16.34 million copies have been sold, making ''X'' and ''Y'' the second best-selling games on the system.

== Gameplay ==
{{Main|Gameplay of Pokémon}}
''Pokémon X'' and ''Y'' are [[role-playing video game]]s with [[Adventure game|adventure]] elements, presented in a [[Grammatical person#Use of grammatical person in creative media|third-person]], [[overhead perspective]]. They are also the first ''Pokémon'' games to include 3D functions, not only in the games' overworld, but compatible with the 3D consoles in the [[Nintendo 3DS family]].&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; The player controls a young trainer who goes on a quest to catch and train creatures known as Pokémon and win battles against other trainers. By defeating enemy Pokémon in turn-based battles, the player's Pokémon gain [[experience points|experience]], allowing them to [[Levels up|level up]] and increase their battle statistics, learn new moves to use in battle, and in some cases, [[Pokémon evolution|evolve]] into more powerful Pokémon. Alternatively, players can capture wild Pokémon found during [[random encounter]]s by weakening them in battle and catching them with [[Poké Ball]]s to be added to the player's [[Party (video games)|party]]. Players are also able to battle and [[Pokémon trading|trade]] Pokémon with other human players using the Nintendo 3DS's Internet features, which was enhanced in the 6th generation of games. Like with previous games in the series, certain Pokémon are only obtainable in either ''X'' or ''Y'', keeping players encouraged to trade with others in order to obtain all Pokémon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hernandez|first1=Patricia|title=Pokemon X Versus Pokemon Y: Which To Buy|url=https://kotaku.com/which-version-should-you-buy-pokemon-x-or-pokemon-y-1444397068|accessdate=January 2, 2018|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|date=October 12, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103013126/https://kotaku.com/which-version-should-you-buy-pokemon-x-or-pokemon-y-1444397068|archivedate=January 3, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new element in the series is Mega Evolution, in which fully evolved Pokémon, such as [[Mewtwo]] and [[Lucario]], can use special items called "Mega Stones" to temporarily evolve further into Mega Evolved forms (final forms for one evolution families and true/second final forms for two-evolution families) during battle,&lt;ref name="torchic"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fahey|first1=Mike|title=Here's How Pokemon X And Y's New Mega Evolutions Work|url=https://kotaku.com/heres-how-pokemon-x-and-ys-new-mega-evolutions-work-1077212815|accessdate=February 15, 2018|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=9 August 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029003658/http://kotaku.com/heres-how-pokemon-x-and-ys-new-mega-evolutions-work-1077212815|archivedate=October 29, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a couple of Pokémon having more than one possible Mega form available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fahey|first1=Mike|title=Mega Mewtwo X Is Cool.

=== Connectivity to other devices ===
Along with the many additions that ''X'' and ''Y'' brought, various improvements to the communication features took place. Using the Player Search System (PSS), players can encounter and keep track of various online players, including strangers, allowing them to easily initiate battles or trades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McElroy|first1=Griffin|title=Pokemon X and Y's Player Search System announced, allows for easier multiplayer|url=https://www.polygon.com/2013/6/11/4421196/pokemon-x-and-ys-player-search-system-announced-allows-for-easier|accessdate=January 2, 2018|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=June 11, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103072549/https://www.polygon.com/2013/6/11/4421196/pokemon-x-and-ys-player-search-system-announced-allows-for-easier|archivedate=January 3, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Holo Caster allows the player to receive messages and updates from [[non player character|NPCs]] via [[StreetPass]] and [[SpotPass]].

''Pokémon Bank'' is an optional paid [[cloud storage]] service that allows players to store up to 3,000 Pokémon online to be shared amongst whichever physical or downloaded copies of the games they may own. Another application called ''Poké Transporter'' allows players to upload Pokémon owned in [[Pokémon Black and White|''Pokémon Black'', ''White'', ''Black 2'', and ''White 2'']] to the Bank, which can then be imported into ''X'' and ''Y''. There are plans to use these applications for future games in the series. These applications, announced for release on December 27, 2013, were postponed to February 5, 2014, due to the volume of traffic on the [[Nintendo Network]] service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.es/Noticias/2013/diciembre/Banco-Pokemon-y-Poke-Trasladador-845138.html|title=Banco Pokémon y Poké Trasladador|work=[[Nintendo]]|date=December 27, 2013|accessdate=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Story ==
=== Setting ===
[[File:Pokemon Kalos Region.png|thumb|right|''Pokémon X'' and ''Y'' take place in the Kalos Region. The player begins their adventure in Vaniville Town, located in the lower right point of the star-shaped region. The large, circular city just north of center is Lumiose City]]

The games take place in the star-shaped {{nihongo4|Kalos Region|カロス地方|Karosu-chihō}}, one of many such regions across the fictional Pokémon World. Centered around beauty, the region is heavily inspired by [[France]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Europe]] as a whole.&lt;ref name="Beauty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SN_1"/&gt; Many locations and landmarks across Kalos have real-world inspirations, including Prism Tower ([[Eiffel Tower]]), the Lumiose Art Museum (the [[Louvre]]), and the stones outside Geosenge Town ([[Carnac stones]]).&lt;ref name="Beauty"&gt;{{cite web|first=Colin|last=Campbell|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=July 5, 2013|accessdate=June 22, 2016|title=How France inspired Junichi Masuda in making Pokémon X and Y|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/7/5/4496064/junichi-masuda-reveals-french-inspiration-for|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623054019/http://www.polygon.com/2013/7/5/4496064/junichi-masuda-reveals-french-inspiration-for|archivedate=June 23, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Inspiration"&gt;{{cite web|first=Brad|last=O'Farrell|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=April 10, 2015|accessdate=June 22, 2016|title=How Pokemon's world was shaped by real-world locations|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/4/10/8339935/pokemon-new-york-tokyo-paris|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624112152/http://www.polygon.com/2015/4/10/8339935/pokemon-new-york-tokyo-paris|archivedate=June 24, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wild Pokémon inhabit every corner of the Kalos Region, many of which are only known to appear in this area.

=== Plot ===
Similar to previous ''Pokémon'' games, ''X'' and ''Y'' both follow a [[linear gameplay|linear]] storyline whose main events occur in a fixed order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Patricia|last=Hernandez|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|date=December 22, 2014|accessdate=June 22, 2016|title=''Pokémon{{'}}s'' Ridiculous Timeline, Explained In A Single Image|url=http://kotaku.com/pokemons-ridiculous-timeline-explained-in-a-single-ima-1674127110|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612034717/http://kotaku.com/pokemons-ridiculous-timeline-explained-in-a-single-ima-1674127110|archivedate=June 12, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[protagonist]] of ''Pokémon X'' and ''Y'' is a child who had just moved to a small town called Vaniville Town with their mother. They soon befriend four trainers—Shauna, Tierno, Trevor, and their rival Calem or Serena,{{refn|group=nb|Calem and Serena are the standard names given to the male and female player characters, respectively. The character not chosen by the player appears in-game as a rival.}}—all of whom were called to meet Professor Sycamore who is the leading professor in the Kalos Region in Lumiose City, the main city of Kalos. Receiving either [[Chespin]], [[Fennekin]], or [[Froakie]] as their [[starter Pokémon]] from Tierno, the player begins their adventure. Along the way, they learn of [[Gameplay of Pokémon#Pokémon Gyms|Pokémon Gyms]] and receive their first badge for defeating Viola, the Santalune City Gym Leader. Thereafter, they encounter Sina and Dexio, assistants of Sycamore, who brings them to the professor himself; however, once in Lumiose City they discover the area to be suffering from a partial power outage. Upon meeting Sycamore in Lumiose City, the player is informed of [[Gameplay of Pokémon#Mega Evolution|Mega Evolution]] and he requests they travel across Kalos and uncover the mysteries behind it. He provides them with one of the [[Pokémon Red and Blue#Setting|Kanto Region]] starter Pokémon and their respective Mega Stone. Before leaving Lumiose City, the player encounters an imposing man named Lysandre who desires a more beautiful world.

[[File:Seine and Eiffel Tower from Tour Saint Jacques 2013-08.JPG|thumb|left|The Kalos Region was heavily inspired by France, with the main city—Lumiose City—being a representation of [[Paris]] ''(pictured)''. The in-game city is crowned by the Prism Tower, a building inspired by the [[Eiffel Tower]].]]
Continuing their journey, the player encounters the villainous Team Flare, whose goals at first seem to be geared towards making money off of Pokémon. Later encounters with Team Flare reveal their true goal to be the annihilation of humanity to return the world to a pristine, more beautiful state. In Shalour City, the player learns how to use Mega Evolution from the Mega Evolution guru Gurkinn and his granddaughter Korrina, who is the Gym Leader of Shalour City. Defeating Korrina in a special Mega Evolution battle using [[Lucario]], the player is given the ability to freely use Mega Evolution. The player then continues their journey, defeating Gym Leaders and stopping various schemes carried out by Team Flare. In the Lumiose Badlands, the player defeats Team Flare during their attempt to steal energy from the region's power plant and restores power to all of Lumiose City. Once the player obtains their seventh badge, they, and the rest of Kalos, are addressed by Lysandre through the Holo Caster (a holographic communication device); Lysandre informs them of the fact that he is the leader of Team Flare and intends to destroy humanity.

Following hints from friends and locals, the player discovers Team Flare's secret lab under a café in Lumiose City where they formally meet a {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on}} tall man named AZ;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Pokémon]]|year=2013|accessdate=June 22, 2016|title=Characters: AZ|url=http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/characters/AZ/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160622191308/http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/characters/AZ/|archivedate=June 22, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; he is revealed to be the 3,000-year-old king who once used the "ultimate weapon"—the same device Lysandre plans to use—which utilized energy from the [[Gameplay of Pokémon#Legendary Pokémon|Legendary Pokémon]] [[Xerneas]] or [[Yveltal]]{{refn|group=nb|The Legendary Pokémon used in the story and which later appears in front of the player is dependent upon the game. Xerneas appears in ''X'' while Yveltal appears in ''Y''.}} to end a war in Kalos. AZ's decision to use the ultimate weapon was motivated by his desire to revive the Pokémon he loved the most, a variant of the Pokémon [[Floette]], although the Pokémon was disgusted with his choice to use the ultimate weapon and left him. This war 3,000&amp;nbsp;years ago set in motion the events necessary to create Mega Evolution by inadvertently infusing excessive energy into an asteroid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Patricia|last=Hernandez|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|date=November 21, 2014|accessdate=June 22, 2016|title=One Big Reason To Finish The New ''Pokémon'' Games|url=http://kotaku.com/one-big-reason-to-finish-the-new-pokemon-games-1661733984|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613224359/http://kotaku.com/one-big-reason-to-finish-the-new-pokemon-games-1661733984|archivedate=June 13, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside Shauna and Calem or Serena, the player sets out to stop Team Flare and Lysandre at their second base in Geosenge Town, the location of the ultimate weapon. Upon reaching the core of the weapon, the player discovers a dormant Xerneas or Yveltal which suddenly awakens with their appearance. They capture the Legendary Pokémon and proceed to bring an end to Lysandre's plans after defeating him in battle one final time.

With the defeat of Team Flare, the player resumes their journey and obtains their eighth and final Gym Badge, enabling them to challenge the [[List of Pokémon characters#Kalos Elite Four|Elite Four]]—the most powerful trainers in Kalos. They traverse Victory Road and reach the Kalos Pokémon League to begin their final challenge. Once they overcome the Elite Four, the player faces and defeats Champion Diantha, making the player the new Champion of Kalos. A parade is organised by Professor Sycamore to celebrate the player's role in saving the Kalos region and becoming the new champion. AZ battles the player during the parade, recognising the player's strength and what it means to be a Pokémon Trainer. His Floette then returns to him and they are reunited for the first time in 3,000 years.

=== Music ===
[[File:Junichi Masuda.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Junichi Masuda ''(pictured)'' returned as a composer for the battle themes of ''X'' and ''Y'' while also serving as the games' director]]

The game's score was composed by Shota Kageyama, Minako Adachi, Hitomi Sato, Junichi Masuda, Go Ichinose, and Morikazu Aoki.&lt;ref name="Music1"/&gt; This was the first usage of the Nintendo 3DS's sound capabilities for the Pokémon series, and Masuda expressed delight over improved sound quality and expression. Similar to the theme of ''X'' and ''Y'' themselves, the soundtrack of the games were designed to emphasize beauty. Kageyama sought inspiration from the music of France as well; however, he indicated hesitation in making the music sound too French. During an interview with ''[[Famitsu]]'' magazine, Masuda stated that the [[Koto (instrument)|Japanese harp]] was used in place of an [[accordion]] in certain situations to avoid giving off excessive French vibes. Additionally, Kageyama cited Masuda himself as inspiration for his work. Although working primarily as the director for ''X'' and ''Y'', Masuda composed the games' battle themes. In discussing {{abbr|''Battle! (Gym Leader)''|戦闘！ジムリーダー}}, Masuda stated he wanted to try a new approach and added [[Techno (music)|techno]] themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sato|work=[[Siliconera]]|publisher=[[Curse (company)|Curse]]|date=November 20, 2013|accessdate=June 21, 2016|title=Pokémon X And Y Developers On The Importance of Balancing Sound And Music|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2013/11/20/pokmon-x-y-developers-importance-balancing-sound-music/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806004714/http://www.siliconera.com/2013/11/20/pokmon-x-y-developers-importance-balancing-sound-music/|archivedate=August 6, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pokémon X'' and ''Y'' were both released to positive reception, garnering "generally favorable reviews" according to review aggregator [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MetaX"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MetaY"/&gt; The positive reception allowed ''X'' and ''Y'' to claim the 15th and 13th highest-rated games on the [[Nintendo 3DS]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|year=2016|accessdate=June 26, 2016|title=Best 3DS Video Games of All Time|url=http://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/all/3ds/filtered?sort=desc|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160628100312/http://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/all/3ds/filtered?sort=desc|archivedate=June 28, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese magazine ''[[Famitsu|Weekly Famitsu]]'' awarded the game a near-perfect score, earning it the publication's Platinum Award.&lt;ref name="Fam"/&gt; This made them the second-highest rated ''Pokémon'' titles by the magazine, behind only the perfect score awarded to [[Pokémon Black and White|''Pokémon Black'' and ''White'']].&lt;ref name="Fam"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Pokemon Black &amp; White Grab Rare Perfect Score from Famitsu|magazine=The Escapist|last=Funk|first=John|date=September 8, 2010|accessdate=June 26, 2016|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/103311-Pokemon-Black-White-Grab-Rare-Perfect-Score-from-Famitsu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/610tM8txg?url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/103311-Pokemon-Black-White-Grab-Rare-Perfect-Score-from-Famitsu|archivedate=August 17, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The games received universal praise for the transition to 3D graphics, enhanced visuals, and integration of online play.&lt;ref name="EuroG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edge"/&gt; [[Edge (magazine)|''Edge'']] magazine reviewers described the visuals as "rich in detail and flavour, from the stately majesty of the affluent areas to a dilapidated, overgrown hotel whose only guests are squatting punks".&lt;ref name="Edge"/&gt; Simon Parkin of ''[[Eurogamer]]'' similarly complimented the game's "smooth transition" to 3D, declaring that ''Pokémon X'' &amp; ''Y'' is the finest expression of [[Satoshi Tajiri]]'s obsessive vision yet."&lt;ref name="EuroG"/&gt;

''[[IGN]]'' reviewer Jose Otero found that the game was "a successful transition to a 3D world", calling it "an even more social, beautiful, and strategic game" compared to its predecessors, adding that many of the new Pokémon's 3D models and animations complemented their individual species' personalities, and that the new Mega Evolutions were "similarly impressive". He also praised the faster pace of the early game, with ''X'' and ''Y'' providing a wide range of Pokémon to catch within the first hour of gameplay.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; While ''[[Game Informer]]'' reviewer Kyle Hilliard found the title's gameplay additions to be mostly positive, "[making] everything more inviting, attractive, and fun", the magazine also felt that they ultimately did not "break the mold" of what players expected from the franchise.&lt;ref name=GI/&gt; Ernest Cavalli at ''[[Joystiq]]'' and Griffin McElroy at ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' both praised the gameplay, with Cavalli calling it "hands-down the best in the series", and that the game could be enjoyed equally by both veterans and newcomers to the franchise.&lt;ref name="Joystiq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Poly"/&gt; Daan Koopman from ''Nintendo World Report'' also gave positive reviews about the 3D graphics, music, characters, and the changes to battles, but criticized the inconsistencies in the presentation overall and found the new battle types not that exciting.&lt;ref name="NWR"/&gt; Parkin indicated that the original appeal of the series—catching every Pokémon—"remains resolutely undiminished after all this time."&lt;ref name="EuroG"/&gt; Conversely, ''Edge'' claimed some of the series' "original magic had been lost across so many iterative updates" and criticized its unsteady framerate in 3D mode.&lt;ref name="Edge"/&gt;

With the updated Player Search System (PSS) present at all times on the touchscreen, providing a seamless transition from solo play to player-to-player battles and trades, integration of online play was praised as "masterly" by Parkin.&lt;ref name="EuroG"/&gt; McElroy described it as "completely interconnected experience, which is exactly how Pokémon is meant to be played".&lt;ref name="Poly"/&gt; Otero proclaimed the PSS "makes ''Pokémon X'' and ''Y'' feel dramatically new and more modern".&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; The optional aspects of Pokémon-Amie and Super Training had mixed reception. Hilliard described the minigames of Super Training as forgettable.&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt; McElroy viewed these aspects as positively reinforcing bonds between trainers and their Pokémon, with Pokémon-Amie making them seem more like pets.&lt;ref name="Poly"/&gt; Otero praised Super Training for making competitive training more accessible to players.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;

In contrast to the high-praise for visuals, the story was poorly received. Otero described the story and character personalities as "pretty disappointing for a predominantly single-player RPG."&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; McElroy described the campaign as "rigidly formulaic".&lt;ref name="Poly"/&gt; However, Hilliard called some of the interactions with non-playable characters "bizarre... and often entertaining".&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt; Parkin criticized it as "thin and melodramatic" and "sometimes jarringly preachy". They also considered some of the games' puzzles to be clumsy.&lt;ref name="EuroG"/&gt; The layout of the Kalos region itself was described as disappointingly straightforward for players who enjoy exploring but inviting to new players in the franchise.&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt; This ease of access was exemplified through subtle additions and changes to gaining experience. More readily available experience allowed players to use more Pokémon throughout the campaign and rotate through a team greater than six.&lt;ref name="Poly"/&gt;

The '''prohibition against slaughtering an animal and its offspring on the same day''' is a negative [[mitzvah|commandment]] in [[Judaism]] which forbids the slaughter of a [[kosher]] four-legged animal and its offspring on the same day.

==Hebrew Bible==
The commandment originates from a verse in the book of [[Leviticus]] that states:
{{quote|But you shall not slaughter, from the herd or the flock, an animal with its young on the same day.|{{bibleref2|Leviticus|22:28|NRSV}}}}
The commandment is preceded by the instruction that a calf or lamb is only acceptable for sacrifice on the eighth day (22:26).&lt;ref&gt;[[Nahum M. Sarna]], [[Chaim Potok]], ''The JPS Torah Commentary: Leviticus'' [[Jewish Publication Society]] 1989 Page 113 "In 22:26f., for example, in a formulation identical to that found here, we read that the offspring of large and small cattle may not be "slaughtered" until the eighth day after birth, at which time they first become acceptable as sacrifices. In keeping ..."&lt;/ref&gt; The Hebrew Bible uses the generic word for bull or cow (Hebrew: שור ''showr''&lt;ref&gt;Gesenius Hebrew Lexicon "Showr ...This is the general word for one of the ox tribe... without distinction of age or sex"&lt;/ref&gt;), and the generic word for sheep and ewe (שה ''seh'') and the masculine pronoun form in the verb "slaughter-him" (Hebrew ''shachat-u'')

==Second Temple period==
The earliest Jewish commentary on this commandment is found in the [[Temple Scroll]] among the [[Dead Sea scrolls]]:
{{quote|And an ox or a lamb with its offspring you may not slaughter at the same time. And you shall not strike the mother with her offspring.|([[Temple Scroll|11QT]] 52:5–7a)&lt;ref&gt;Ben Zion Wacholder The New Damascus Document: The Midrash On The Eschatological Torah 2007   Page 296 "And an ox or a lamb with its offspring you may not slaughter at the same time. And you shall not strike the mother with her offspring. (11QT 52:5–7a) This text diverges from Talmudic tradition. According to the sages, the prohibition against slaughtering a young calf extends from birth to the seventh day of its life (Hullin 78:2). However, Temple Scroll, by linking Lev 22:28 and a paraphrase of Gen 32:12 which contains the phrase ... in the context of Jacob fearing that Esau might strike him together with all of his clan, suggests that ''b-yom ehad'' means “at the same time." In other words it is prohibited to slaughter a fetus when it is in its mother's womb."&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The interpretation of the Dead Sea scrolls differs from later rabbinical Judaism in prohibiting the slaughter of a pregnant animal.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Zion Wacholder ''The New Damascus Document: The Midrash On The Eschatological Torah'' 2007 Page 296 "3.2.2.9.6.2.7. The Status of a Fetus (4Q270 F2ii:15b) As we have stated above, the prohibition against slaughtering a pregnant animal differs from rabbinic tradition which sanctions it. On this ban, see also 11QT 52:5–7a: yl hmh hbowt yk twalm ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William R. G. Loader ''The Dead Sea Scrolls on Sexuality'' 2009 - Page 140 "... the prohibition against slaughtering a pregnant animal in what immediately precedes (ii.15), an application of Deut 22:6, as in 11QTa/11Q19 52.5, there, applied to sacrificial slaughter, and similarly in 4QMMTB 36-38, and to 11QTa/11Q19 ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Kampen, Moshe J. Bernstein ''Reading [[4QMMT]]: new perspectives on Qumran law and history'' 1996 - Page 40 "The uniqueness of the Qumran treatment, according to Qimron's restoration, is the association of Lev 22:28 with the prohibition against slaughtering a pregnant animal and the requirement to slaughter a fetus found alive in the womb of its "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Milgrom, David Pearson Wright, David Noel Freedman ''Pomegranates and Golden Bells: Studies in Biblical, Jewish, and Near Eastern Ritual, Law, and Literature in Honor of Jacob Milgrom'' 1995 "... there is apparently also a prohibition of consuming the young of an animal found alive within the womb of its mother. The young is regarded as a distinct animal requiring its own ritual slaughter.7"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Septuagint]] of [[Hellenistic Judaism]] the passage was translated with ''moschos'' - the generic Greek word for bull or cow or calf.&lt;ref&gt;Greek Septuagint Leviticus 22:28 καὶ μόσχον ἢ πρόβατον αὐτὴν καὶ τὰ παιδία αὐτῆς οὐ σφάξεις ἐν ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thayer Greek Lexicon ''moschos'' "Septuagint chiefly for a bull, especially a young bull, then for cattle, for an ox or a cow, for a calf"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rabbinical interpretation==

[[Obadiah ben Abraham|Obadiah of Bertinoro]]&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Mishna [[Chullin]] 5:1 et al.&lt;/ref&gt; understood the prohibition to apply to both mother or father of the offspring. [[Rashi]] argued that the prohibition only applies to the mother;&lt;ref name&gt;Commentary to Leviticus 22:28&lt;/ref&gt; however [[Hezekiah ben Manoah|Hizkuni]] argued that while the Biblical prohibition applies only to the mother, a rabbinic decree of lesser stringency also prohibits killing the father with its offspring.&lt;ref name&gt;Commentary to Leviticus 22:28&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Shulchan Aruch]] rules that it is uncertain whether the father is included, and therefore one must not slaughter the father with its offspring, but if done the punishment ([[Flagellation#Judaism|whipping]]) cannot be applied.&lt;ref&gt;Yoreh Deah 16:2&lt;/ref&gt;

The "day" in question is defined as running from evening to evening, similar to [[Shabbat]].&lt;ref&gt;Talmud [[Hullin]] 83a&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, one could permissibly slaughter an animal in the late afternoon, and its offspring shortly afterwards at nighttime.

'''''R v Ryan''''' [2013] SCC 3 is a case concerning the availability of [[duress]] in the context of [[domestic violence]].

==Background==
Nicole Doucet Ryan (now Nicole Doucet) alleged that she was subject to repeated abuse and torment by her husband, Michael Ryan. At trial, the trial judge accepted she was subject to such abuse. The husband was never called to testify.   
In September 2007, Ms. Doucet began to think about having her husband murdered. Over the course of the next seven months, she spoke to at least three men whom she hoped would kill him. In December 2007 or January 2008, she paid one man $25,000 to carry out the killing, but he then refused, demanding more compensation. She approached another person and was contacted by a third, an undercover RCMP officer, posing as a “hit man”. On March 27, 2008, she met with this individual and agreed to pay him to kill her husband. The agreed upon price was $25,000, with $2,000 paid in cash that day. The killing was to take place the coming weekend. Later that same night, she provided an address and a picture of her husband to the “hit man.” Shortly after, she was arrested and charged with counselling the commission of an offence not committed contrary to s. 464(a) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.

At trial, there was no issue that the elements of the offence had been proved and the trial judge, Farrar J. (as he then was), indicated that he was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the requisite elements of the offence of counselling the commission of an offence had been established. He based this conclusion on the Ms. Doucet’s admission that the Crown had proved a prima facie case and on the audio and video tapes of recorded conversations with the undercover officer and a statement made on arrest. The only issue at trial was whether Ms. Doucet’s otherwise criminal acts were excused because of duress. The accused had raised that the common law defence of duress applied. The Crown argued that on the facts of this case, the components of duress were not present.  But it did not argue at trial, as it did later on appeal, that the defence of duress was not available in law to the accused. The trial judge accepted her version and acquitted her on the basis she had established she was acting under duress. 

The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal unanimously upheld her acquittal.

==Reasons of the court==
The Court allowed the Crown appeal. The majority entered a stay while the dissenting judge, Fish J., would have ordered a new trial, leaving it to the Crown to determine whether a retrial was in the public interest.

The Court accepted the facts found by the trial judge. The only issue was whether the defence of duress was available. The Court accepted the Crown’s argument, which was made for the first time, that duress was not available. Duress is available when one is compelled to commit a crime against an innocent third party. In this case, given the facts found by the trial judge, the husband would not be an innocent victim. Rather he would be the author of his own misfortune. Moreover, Ms. Doucet was never compelled to act as she did. The Court alluded to the possibility of invoking self-defence as a possible defence.

Fish J. found the granting of the stay of proceedings was inappropriate. He would have ordered a new trial. Any further defence advanced by the accused could be made then.

==Reactions==
Following the release of the decision on January 18, 2013, Michael Ryan, ex-husband of the accused denied any of the allegations made. He emphasized he was in attendance at court in response to a subpoena, but the Crown never called him as a witness.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2013/01/23/ns-hitman-michael-ryan.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A law professor from Dalhousie University called for a public inquiry. He questioned the rationale of the Crown not to call Mr. Ryan as a witness. He also was critical of the Court in making findings against the RCMP without having heard anything from the RCMP. He was also critical of the granting of a stay of proceedings, agreeing with Fish J. that it is an extreme remedy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2013/02/05/ns-hit-man-case-inquiry-kaiser.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ron Reis is the son of Ron Reis, Sr., who was a member of [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] title-winning [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|basketball teams]] in 1961 and 1962 while studying at the [[University of Cincinnati]].

Reis attended [[Monta Vista High School]] in [[Cupertino, California]]. He played on the school's basketball team, scoring 2,082 points and competing in the 1987 Central Coast championship. Reis went on to attend [[Santa Clara University]], where he [[Santa Clara Broncos men's basketball|played basketball]] for four years.&lt;ref name="WON"/&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1994-1995)===
Ron Reis was trained by [[Big John Studd]].&lt;ref name=oww/&gt; He made his professional debut on March 12, 1994 for the [[New England]]-based [[International Wrestling Federation]] under his birth name. In 1995, Reis began performing for the [[Las Vegas]]-based National Wrestling Conference as "SWAT". 

===World Championship Wrestling (1995-1998)===
Reis debuted in [[World Championship Wrestling]] on [[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]], October 23, 1995,&lt;ref name=oww/&gt; as '''The Yeti''' - the [[The Dungeon of Doom|Dungeon of Doom]]'s so-called "insurance policy" for the upcoming [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]] match between Dungeon member [[Big Show|The Giant]] and current champion [[Hulk Hogan]] at [[Halloween Havoc (1995)|Halloween Havoc 1995]]. Initially introduced (supposedly) frozen inside a block of [[ice]], the Yeti soon broke out of the ice to reveal a heavily bandaged appearance reminiscent of a huge [[mummy]] and went on to interfere in the Halloween Havoc 1995 main event, where he and The Giant attacked Hulk Hogan with a double-bearhug. Reis wore [[Elevator shoes|lifts]] in his boots at the event and had bandages wrapped high on his head, which gave the effect of The Yeti appearing noticeably taller than The Giant (in reality Reis is only around an inch taller than Wight) and caused an astonished [[Tony Schiavone]] to remark "The Yeti is taller than The Giant!".

Following Halloween Havoc, The Yeti's ring attire was changed to resemble a masked ninja.&lt;ref name="YouTubeWW3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrFds81OXDs|title=WCW World War 3 1995 Part 2/2|accessdate=2011-05-10|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Reis only made three more appearances as the character; as an entrant in the 60-man battle royal at [[WCW World War 3 (1995)|World War 3 1995]], in a match against [[Barry Houston]] on ''[[WCW Prime]]'', and in a match against [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Heavyweight Champion]] [[One Man Gang]] on ''[[WCW Saturday Night]]'' in January 1996, where Reis' character was renamed '''The Super Giant Ninja'''.&lt;ref name=YouTubeNinja/&gt;&lt;ref name="sn96episode"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= WCW Saturday Night|series= WCW Saturday Night|serieslink=WCW Saturday Night|station= TBS (TV channel)|airdate= 1996-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be the final appearance of the character.&lt;ref name="historyofwwe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw96.htm|title=WCW Ring Results - 1996|accessdate=2011-02-28|publisher=TheHistoryOfWWE.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reis later became known as '''Big Ron Studd''' in 1996, and WCW announcers billed Reis as having taken the surname of his trainer [[Big John Studd]].&lt;ref name=oww/&gt; [[Bobby Heenan]], who had managed John Studd, however, disdained Ron in his column in ''WCW Magazine''. WCW primarily used Studd as an [[Job (professional wrestling)|enhancement talent]].

On October 21, 1996 edition of ''Nitro'' he was defeated by [[Jeff Jarrett]].

On the March 2, 1998 edition of ''Nitro'', Reis joined [[Raven's Nest#The Flock|Raven's Flock]] as '''Reese'''.&lt;ref name="WON2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/component/content/article/7967/|author=Cawthon, Graham|title=Graham Cawthon's This Day in Wrestling History|work=[[Dave Meltzer|Wrestling Observer]]|date=November 24, 2009|accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] claimed that Reis' size had made him an outcast from society, leading him to seek acceptance within the Flock. Reis acted as Raven's [[Enforcer (professional wrestling)|enforcer]], though he was unable to prevent [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] defeating Raven for the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. He also suffered a loss to [[Juventud Guerrera]] at the 1998 [[The Great American Bash (1998)|Great American Bash]]. Reese's last appearance was on the June 29, 1998 episode of ''Nitro''. [[Perry Saturn|Saturn]] pinned Reese with a [[Professional wrestling throws#Death Valley driver|Death Valley Driver]].

===Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling and Japan===
After being released, Reis toured [[Japan]] as Big Bomb Jones (a take on [[Big Van Vader]]) throughout 2002. In 2003, he returned to America and began working for [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] [[Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling]] [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]], returning to the Big Ron Studd gimmick. He formed a [[tag team]] with [[Glacier (wrestler)|Glacier]], and they won the [[TCW Tag Team Championship]]s on January 3, 2004. The titles were vacated later that year.

'''Rudeness''' (also called '''effrontery''') is a display of disrespect by not complying with the [[Norm (social)|social norms]] or [[etiquette]] of a group or culture. These norms have been established as the essential [[personal boundaries|boundaries]] of normally [[acceptance|accepted]] behavior. To be unable or unwilling to align one's behavior with these norms known to the general population of what is socially acceptable is to be rude and are enforced as though they were a sort of social law, with social repercussions or rewards for violators or advocates, respectively. 

Rudeness, "constituted by deviation from whatever counts as politic in a given social context, is inherently confrontational and disruptive to social equilibrium".{{sfn|Kasper|1990|p=208}}  Rudeness, particularly with respect to speech, is necessarily confrontational at its core.

Forms of rudeness include acting inconsiderate, insensitive, deliberately offensive, [[Politeness|impolite]], a faux pas, [[obscenity]], [[profanity]] and violating [[taboo]]s such as [[deviancy]]. In some cases, an act of rudeness can go so far as to be a [[crime]], for example, the crime of [[hate speech]].

==Relationship to morality==
Both [[manners]] and [[morality]] deal with whether a thing is morally good or bad, but  at different levels.  Unlike morality, which, for example, condemns [[murder]] as a violation of a person, manners primarily concerns itself with violations of human [[dignity]], rather than the person's health or property.{{sfn|Martin|1996|p=123}}  Rude behaviour is a violation of human dignity or of the respect due to others.

==Cultural differences==
{{Main|Intercultural competence}}

The specific actions that are considered polite or rude vary dramatically by place, time, and context.  Differences in [[social role]], [[gender]], [[social class]], [[religion]], and [[cultural identity]] may all affect the appropriateness of a given behaviour.  Consequently, a behaviour that is considered perfectly acceptable by one group of people may be considered clearly rude by another.  For example, in [[medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] [[Europe]], it was rude to indicate that a man wearing a [[mask]] in public could be recognized.{{sfn|Palleschi|2005}}  Instead, polite behaviour demanded that the masked person be treated as a completely unknown person and that no one ever attribute the masked person's actions to the individual who performed them.  By contrast, in the modern era, greeting a friend by name while he is wearing a mask, or talking to them later about their costume or activities, is not generally regarded as rude.

Cultural differences also appear over time.  In the mid-20th century, the meaning of [[eye rolling]] changed from its older signal of lust and passion to expressing contempt.{{sfn|Wickman|2013}}

==Utility==
Sometimes, people deliberately employ rude behaviours to achieve a goal.  Early works in [[linguistic pragmatism]] interpreted rudeness as a defective mode of communication.  However, most rudeness serves functional or instrumental purposes in communication, and skillfully choosing when and how to be rude may indicate a person's pragmatic competence.

{{harvnb|Lakoff|1989}} addressed what she named 'strategic rudeness,' a style of communication used by prosecutors and therapists to force their interlocutors (a courtroom defendant or patient) to talk or react in a certain way.  Rudeness in everyday speech "is frequently instrumental, and is not merely pragmatic failure".{{sfn|Beebe|1995|p=154}}  Most rude speakers are attempting to accomplish one of two important instrumental functions:  to vent negative feelings, and/or to get [[Power (social and political)|power]].{{sfn|Beebe|1995|p=159}}

== Examples ==
In every culture, it is possible to act rudely, although what constitutes rude behaviour varies.  The following are examples of behaviour that many Western societies would consider ''rude'' or a breach of etiquette, though views may vary by culture, setting, or individual circumstances: 
&lt;!--

NOTE:  The goal is *NOT* to provide a comprehensive list of rude behaviours, or to create a "How to Be Rude" manual.

Please don't include items that are more accurately described as "unkind" (gossip) or "lazy" (not cutting the lawn often enough to suit the neighbours) or tautologies (things that are defined as rude, such as "rude gestures" or "rude words").

--&gt;

=== Speech ===
What constitutes rude speech depends on the culture, the setting, and the speaker's social position in the culture. In every culture, some words or statements are considered [[hate speech]] or inappropriate [[list of ethnic slurs|ethnic slurs]] (such as using the word ''[[Hun#20th-century_use_in_reference_to_Germans|Hun]]'' to a [[German people|German]], using the word ''[[Jap]]'' to a [[Japanese people|Japanese person]], etc.). In most modern cultures, [[insult]]ing a person or group of people, especially for any reason outside their immediate control, such as having a medical condition, following a particular religion, or being poor, is considered rude. Rude speech also includes derogatory terms describing an individual person and asking inappropriate questions or pressing for answers to a question.

However, there is no universal rule about which terms are considered derogatory and which questions are inappropriate under what circumstances.  A question or comment that is acceptable between family members might be resented from strangers, just like a question that is acceptable among young people in one culture might be unacceptable to older people or to young people in a different culture.

Rude ways of speaking include inappropriately discouraging a person's participation in a conversation with rude phrases, such as {{wikt-lang|en|shut up}} or using a [[tone of voice]] that indicates disrespect for the other person.  An impolite tone may amplify obviously rude remarks or contradict nominally polite words.  A rude person may interrupt a speaker to indicate that the first speaker is unimportant.

Failing to speak can also be rude:  a rude person might pointedly ignore a legitimate and polite greeting or question to communicate disregard for the other person, or might fail to express appropriate [[gratitude|thanks]] for favors or gifts by way of communicating either a sense of selfish entitlement or a disregard for the efforts of the giver.  Sometimes people will leave very short gaps when speaking that may allow another person to begin speaking on a subject, however that can vary, and sometimes two or more people speaking at the same time can be considered rude.  Which acts and communications require a response from which persons, under which circumstances, and what kind of response is required, depends on the culture and the social situation of the people concerned.

=== Behaviours ===
Many behaviours can be rude.  These often depend upon the context, including time, place, and culture.

This includes a failure to [[dress code|dress appropriately]] for an occasion, whether by dressing too informally, too formally, immodestly, or otherwise inappropriately (e.g., a young woman in public without a veil in Iran; a young woman in public with a veil in France).  [[C. S. Lewis]] writes that "A girl in the Pacific islands wearing hardly any clothes and a Victorian lady completely covered in clothes might both be equally 'modest,' proper, or decent, according to the standards of their own societies"—but that in each culture, the idea of immodest, improper, and indecent dress existed, and that violating the culture's standard was rude.{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=94}}

Rude behaviours often disturb other people, such as making [[noise]] or playing loud music.  An acceptable level of sound depends on the context:  yelling might be the only way to be heard at a noisy [[construction site]], and [[rock concert]]s are expected to feature loud music, but a conversation at a normal level, either by telephone or in person, might be rude in an environment where a reasonable degree of silence is expected, such as a [[library]], and complete silence is expected at other times, such as during religious ceremonies or performances of classical music.  This includes speaking over a presentation or film with no consideration for the other viewers.  Similarly, poor [[table manners]] can disturb or [[disgust]] nearby people, as can [[yawn]]ing, [[cough]]ing, [[fart]]ing or [[sneeze|sneezing]] without covering the mouth.

Other rude behaviours have the effect of communicating disrespect for other people.  In extreme cases, this can rise to complete and deliberate [[social exclusion]] of the disrespected person; in others, the rudeness is only temporary and may be unintentional.  For example, it can be rude to use electronic devices, such as [[mobile phone]]s, if this results in ignoring someone or otherwise indicating that the present company is less interesting or important than the people elsewhere or the text messages they send.  Similarly, [[cutting in line]] signals that the person cutting in the line believes themselves to be more important that the people their action delays.  Barging into someone else's space without permission, whether that be a violation of [[personal space]] or [[Party crashing|crashing a party]], is rude because it does not respect the person's property rights or right to make personal choices.

Other examples include:
*[[Bullying]] or [[intimidating]] people with the threat of violence
*[[Snob]]bery
*[[Aggressive driving]]

'''Sky burial''' ({{bo|t=བྱ་གཏོར་|w=bya gtor}}, &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"bird-scattered"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.howstuffworks.com/culture-traditions/cultural-traditions/sky-burial.htm|title=How Sky Burial Works|date=25 July 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[funeral]] practice in which a human corpse is placed on a mountaintop to [[decompose]] while exposed to the [[mahābhūta|elements]] or to be eaten by scavenging animals, especially [[Scavenger|carrion birds]]. It is a specific type of the general practice of [[excarnation]]. It is practiced in the [[Provinces of China|Chinese provinces and autonomous regions]] of  [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]], [[Qinghai]], [[Sichuan]] and [[Inner Mongolia]], as well as in [[Mongolia]], [[Bhutan]] and parts of India such as [[Sikkim]] and [[Zanskar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sulkowsky|first1=Zoltan|title=Around the World on a Motorcycle|date=2008|publisher=Whitehorse Press|isbn=978-1-884313-55-4|page=114|url=https://octanepress.com/book/around-world-motorcycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The locations of preparation and sky burial are understood in the [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] traditions as [[charnel ground]]s. Comparable practices are part of Zoroastrian burial practices where deceased are exposed to the elements and birds of prey on stone structures called [[Dakhma]].&lt;ref&gt;''BBC''.

The majority of [[Tibetan people]] and many [[Mongols]] adhere to [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, which teaches the [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|transmigration of spirits]]. There is no need to preserve the body, as it is now an empty vessel. Birds may eat it or nature may cause it to decompose. The function of the sky burial is simply to dispose of the remains in as generous a way as possible (the source of the practice's Tibetan name). In much of Tibet and Qinghai, the ground is too hard and rocky to dig a [[grave]], and due to the scarcity of fuel and timber, sky burials were typically more practical than the traditional [[Buddhist practice]] of [[cremation]]. In the past, cremation was limited to high [[lama]]s and some other dignitaries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/cityguides/tibet/sky-buria.htm|title=Sky Burial, Tibetan Religious Ritual, Funeral Party|website=www.travelchinaguide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but modern technology and difficulties with sky burial have led to an increased use by commoners.&lt;ref name=dif&gt;''China Daily''. "[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-12/13/content_16015555.htm Funeral reforms in Tibetan areas]". 13 Dec 2012. Accessed 18 Jul 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other nations which performed air burial were the Caucasus nations of [[Georgians]], [[Abkhazians]] and [[Adyghe people|Adyghe]] people, in which they put the corpse in a hollow tree trunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vostlit.info/Texts/rus11/Bagrationi/frametext1.htm|title=ИСТОРИЯ ГРУЗИИ|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vostlit.info/Texts/Dokumenty/Kavkaz/XVII/1640-1660/Lamberti/text.htm|title=ОПИСАНИЕ КОЛХИДЫ ИЛИ МИНГРЕЛИИ|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History and development==
The Tibetan sky-burials appear to have evolved from ancient practices of defleshing corpses as discovered in archeological finds in the region.&lt;ref&gt;PBS. [https://www.pbs.org/programs/cave-people-himalaya/ "Cave People of the Himalaya"].&lt;/ref&gt; These practices most likely came out of practical considerations,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wylie|1965|p=232}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|1996|pp=360–365}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Joyce|Williamson|2003|p=815}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but they could also be related to more ceremonial practices similar to the suspected sky burial evidence found at [[Göbekli Tepe]] (11,500 years [[before present]]) and [[Stonehenge]] (4,500 years BP).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Most of Tibet is above the [[tree line]], and the scarcity of timber makes cremation economically unfeasible. Additionally, subsurface interment is difficult since the [[active layer]] is not more than a few centimeters deep, with solid rock or [[permafrost]] beneath the surface.

The customs are first recorded in an indigenous 12th-century Buddhist treatise, which is colloquially known as the ''[[Tibetan Book of the Dead|Book of the Dead]]'' ([[Bardo Thodol]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|1991|p=212}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetan [[tantra|tantricism]] appears to have influenced the  procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ramachandra Rao|1977|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wylie|1964}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The body is cut up according to instructions given by a lama or adept.&lt;ref name="GossKlass"&gt;{{harvnb|Goss|Klass|1997|p=385}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mongolians traditionally buried their dead (sometimes with human or animal sacrifice for the wealthier chieftains) but the [[Tümed]] adopted sky burial following their conversion to Tibetan Buddhism under [[Altan Khan]] during the [[Ming Dynasty]] and other banners subsequently converted under the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] [[Qing Dynasty]].&lt;ref name=hei&gt;Heike, Michel. "[http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/corff/im/Texte/burial.html The Open-Air Sacrificial Burial of the Mongols]". Accessed 18 Jul 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sky burial was initially treated as a primitive superstition and sanitation concern by the [[Communist]] governments of both the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] and [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]]; both states closed many temples&lt;ref name=hei/&gt; and China banned the practice completely from the [[Cultural Revolution]] of the late 1960s until the 1980s.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{harvnb|Faison|1999|loc=para. 13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;During this period, Sky burials were considered among the [[Four Olds]], which was the umbrella term used by Communists to describe anti-proletarian customs, cultures and ideas. As a result of these policies, many corpses would simply be buried or throw in rivers. Many families believed the souls of these people would never escape purgatory and became ghosts. Sky burial nonetheless continued to be practiced in rural areas and has even received official protection in recent years. However, the practice continues to diminish for a number of reasons, including restrictions on its practice near urban areas and diminishing numbers of vultures in rural districts. Finally, Tibetan practice holds that the [[yak]] carrying the body to the charnel grounds should be set free{{cn|date=November 2017}}, making the rite much more expensive than a service at a [[crematorium]].&lt;ref name=dif/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.sina.com/china/2012/1213/537423.html|title=Funeral reforms edge along in Tibetan areas|date=2012-12-13|accessdate=2012-12-16|publisher=Xinhua}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose and meaning==
[[File:Ragbya carries corps from Lhasa for Sky burial.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Corpse being carried from Lhasa for sky burial about 1920]]
For Tibetan Buddhists, sky burial and cremation are templates of instructional teaching on the impermanence of life.&lt;ref name="GossKlass" /&gt; ''Jhator'' is considered an act of generosity on the part of the deceased, since the deceased and his/her surviving relatives are providing food to sustain living beings. Such generosity and [[Karuṇā|compassion]] for all beings are important [[paramita|virtues]] in [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.zmescience.com/other/the-sky-burial/|title = The Sky Burial|date = November 9, 2009|accessdate = January 20, 2015|website = ZME Science|publisher = |last = Mihai|first = Andrei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some observers have suggested that ''jhator'' is also meant to unite the deceased person with the sky or sacred realm, this does not seem consistent with most of the knowledgeable commentary and eyewitness reports, which indicate that Tibetans believe that at this point life has completely left the body and the body contains nothing more than simple flesh.

Only people who directly know the deceased usually observe it, when the excarnation happens at night.

==Vajrayana iconography==
The tradition and custom of the ''jhator'' afforded [[Traditional Tibetan medicine]] and ''[[thangka]]'' [[iconography]] with a particular insight into the interior workings of the human body. Pieces of the [[human skeleton]] were employed in ritual tools such as the [[Kapala|skullcup]], [[Kangling|thigh-bone trumpet]], etc.

The 'symbolic bone ornaments' (Skt: {{IAST|aṣṭhiamudrā}}; Tib: rus pa'i rgyanl phyag rgya) are also known as "[[mudra]]" or 'seals'. The ''[[Hevajra Tantra]]'' identifies the Symbolic Bone Ornaments with the [[Five Wisdoms]] and [[Jamgon Kongtrul]] in his commentary to the ''Hevajra Tantra'' explains this further.&lt;ref name="Kongtrul_2005_493"&gt;{{harvnb|Kongtrul|2005|p=493}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2009}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 135-S-12-50-06, Tibetexpedition, Ragyapa, Geier.jpg|thumb|300x300px|1938 photo of Sky burial from the [[German Federal Archives|Bundesarchiv]]]]
A traditional ''jhator'' is performed in specified locations in [[Tibet]] (and surrounding areas traditionally occupied by Tibetans). [[Drigung Monastery]] is one of the three most important ''jhator'' sites.

The procedure takes place on a large flat rock long used for the purpose. The charnel ground (''durtro'') is always higher than its surroundings. It may be very simple, consisting only of the flat rock, or it may be more elaborate, incorporating temples and [[stupa]] (''chorten'' in Tibetan).

Relatives may remain nearby&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ash|1992|p=59}}.&lt;/ref&gt; during the ''jhator'', possibly in a place where they cannot see it directly. The ''jhator'' usually takes place at dawn.

The full ''jhator'' procedure (as described below) is elaborate and expensive. Those who cannot afford it simply place their deceased on a high rock where the body decomposes or is eaten by birds and animals.

==Procedure==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2009}}
Accounts from observers vary. The following description is assembled from multiple accounts by observers from the U.S. and Europe. References appear at the end.

===Participants===
Prior to the procedure, [[Tibetan Buddhism#Monasticism|monks]] may chant [[mantra]] around the body and burn juniper [[incense]] – although ceremonial activities often take place on the preceding day.

The work of disassembling of the body may be done by a monk, or, more commonly, by ''rogyapas'' ("body-breakers").

All the eyewitness accounts remarked on the fact that the ''rogyapas'' did not perform their task with gravity or ceremony, but rather talked and laughed as during any other type of physical labor. According to Buddhist teaching, this makes it easier for the soul of the deceased to move on from the uncertain plane between life and death onto the next life.

Some accounts refer to individuals who carry out sky burial rituals as a ‘Tokden’ which is Tibetan for ‘Sky Burial Master’. While a Todken has an important role in burial rites, they are often people of low social status and sometimes receive payment from the families of the deceased.

===Disassembling the body===
[[File:Skyburial.JPG|thumb|A body being prepared for Sky burial in [[Sichuan]].|300x300px]]

According to most accounts, vultures are given the whole body. Then, when only the bones remain, these are broken up with mallets, ground with [[tsampa]] (barley flour with tea and [[yak]] butter, or milk), and given to the crows and hawks that have waited for the vultures to depart.

In one account, the leading ''rogyapa'' cut off the limbs and hacked the body to pieces, handing each part to his assistants, who used rocks to pound the flesh and bones together to a pulp, which they mixed with tsampa before the vultures were summoned to eat. In some cases, a Todken will use butcher’s tools to divide the body.

Sometimes the internal organs were removed and processed separately, but they too were consumed by birds. The hair is removed from the head and may be simply thrown away; at Drigung, it seems, at least some hair is kept in a room of the monastery.

None of the eyewitness accounts specify which kind of knife is used in the ''jhator''. One source states that it is a "ritual flaying knife" or ''trigu'' ([[Sanskrit]] ''[[kartika (knife)|kartika]]''), but another source expresses scepticism, noting that the ''trigu'' is considered a woman's tool (''rogyapas'' seem to be exclusively male).

===Vultures===
[[File:Vulture - Sky burial.jpg|thumb|Skeletal remains as vultures feed.|300x300px]]
The species contributing to the ritual is the [[griffon vulture]], a species of [[Old World vulture]] (order [[Accipitriformes]], family [[Accipitridae]], scientific name ''[[Gyps fulvus]]'').

In places where there are several ''jhator'' offerings each day, the birds sometimes have to be coaxed to eat, which may be accomplished with a ritual dance. It is considered a bad omen if the vultures will not eat, or if even a small portion of the body is left after the birds fly away. In these cases, it is usually believed that the individual being buried committed so many sins that their body is considered too dirty to eat or that the individual’s family failed to observe proper rituals.

In places where fewer bodies are offered, the vultures are more eager, and sometimes have to be fended off with sticks during the initial preparations. Oftentimes there is a limit to how many corpses can be consumed at a certain burial site, prompting lamas to find different areas. It is believed that if too many corpses are disposed in a certain burial site, ghosts may appear.

==Among Zoroastrians==
Ancient [[Zoroastrians]] believed the dead body should be put in particular structures to be feasted upon by birds of prey, because the burial or burning of the corpses would cause water and soil to become dirty, which is forbidden in the ancient religion. The burial traditions in historical periods are known through archaeological evidence and sacred texts like the Zoroastrians’ Avesta as well as Pahlavi texts. With the recognition of the Zoroastrian religion in Iran, body burial was strictly prohibited and the only way to eliminate the corpses was to place the deceased in rows so their bodies would be feasted upon by birds of prey.In a Zoroastrian religious text, which is a collection of religious rules and instructions, there are references to the ways to treat with the bodies of the dead. According to these texts, the dead should be put in structures known as [[Tower of Silence|dakhma]] to be feasted upon by birds of prey, because the burial or burning of the corpses would cause the sacred elements of water, soil, and fire to become dirty and it is forbidden to do so.

However, according to the researchers, even in Zoroastrian texts, there are indications that a significant number of people opposed the change in funeral practices, which resulted in penalties. Given that the time passed between the burial and the exhumation, only physical punishments were imposed on the perpetrators, which were practically subject to fines.&lt;ref&gt;http://ifpnews.com/exclusive/sky-burial-ancient-tradition-of-irans-zoroastrians/&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
A ''jhator'' was filmed, with permission from the family, for [[Frederique Darragon]]'s documentary ''[[Secret Towers of the Himalayas]],'' which aired on the [[Science Channel]] in fall 2008. The camera work was deliberately careful to never show the body itself, while documenting the procedure, birds, and tools.

The ritual was featured in films such as  ''[[The Horse Thief]],'' ''[[Kundun]],'' and ''[[Himalaya (film)|Himalaya]].'' 

At the sky burial site near the Larung Gar Buddhist Institute near Sertar, Sichuan, the Chinese have built a "Temple of Death" to attract and entertain the growing numbers of Chinese tourists, turning this simple and practical ritual into a tourist attraction.

A sky burial was shown in BBC's ''[[Human Planet]]'' – Mountains.

The semi-autobiographical book ''[[Wolf Totem]]'' discusses sky burial.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1561">'''Steady change''' is the persistent process of transformation in a [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[economic system]]. 

This is explained by the continuous generation, diffusion, accumulation and substitution of innovations by [[economic agent]]s as time moves on. This regular (and accelerating) phenomenon causes movement and crises in economic structures as measured by rates of growth of countries, regions, [[Economic sector|sectors]] and companies. 

The economy is an evolving system. It is thus to always unfold and change, to incessantly show novel behaviour, to surprise its actors and observers with emergent phenomena. The concept stands in contrast to the conventional concept of [[Steady state economy|"steady-state"]] in economics and is inspired by evolutionary insights in modern economic theory such as put forward by Nelson and Winter's book of 1982.

[[File:Medtronic aed training kit.jpg|thumb|right|Defibrillator training kit]]
It remains a difficult medical challenge to prevent the '''sudden cardiac death of athletes''', typically defined as natural, unexpected death from [[cardiac arrest]] within one hour of the onset of collapse symptoms, excluding additional time on mechanical life support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Sudden death in the young: what do we know about it and how to prevent? |vauthors=van der Werf C, van Langen IM, Wilde AA | date=February 2010 | journal=Circ Arrhythmia Electrophysiol | volume=3 | pages=96–104 | pmid=20160177 | doi=10.1161/CIRCEP.109.877142 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Wider definitions of sudden death are also in use, but not usually applied to the athletic situation.) Most causes relate to [[Congenital disorder|congenital]] or acquired [[cardiovascular disease]] with no symptoms noted before the fatal event. The [[prevalence]] of any single, associated condition is low, probably less than 0.3% of the population in the athletes' age group,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} and the [[sensitivity and specificity]] of common screening tests leave much to be desired. The single most important predictor is [[fainting]] or near-fainting during exercise, which should require detailed explanation and investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Syncope in the athletic patient |vauthors=Hastings JL, Levine BD | date=March 2012 | journal=Prog Cardiovasc Dis | volume=54 | pages=438–44 | pmid=22386295 | doi=10.1016/j.pcad.2012.02.003 | issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victims include many well-known names, especially in professional soccer, and close relatives are often at risk for similar cardiac problems.

While most causes of sudden cardiac death relate to [[Congenital disorder|congenital]] or acquired [[cardiovascular disease]], an exception is [[commotio cordis]], in which the heart is structurally normal but a potentially fatal loss of [[sinus rhythm|rhythm]] occurs because of the accident of timing of a blow to the chest. Its fatality rate is about 65% even with prompt [[CPR]] and [[defibrillation]], and more than 80% without.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maron |first1=BJ |last2=Estes |first2=NAM III |title=Commotio cordis |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=362 |issue=10 |pages=917–927 |date=March 2010 |pmid=20220186 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra0910111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uslacrosse.org/safety/sudden-cardiac-arrest-aeds-commotio-cordis/position-statement-on-commotio-cordis |title=Position Statement on Commotio Cordis |publisher=[[US Lacrosse]] |date=January 2008 |accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Age 35 serves as an approximate borderline for the likely cause of sudden cardiac death. Before age 35, congenital abnormalities of the heart and blood vessels predominate. These are usually asymptomatic prior to the fatal event, although not invariably so.&lt;ref name=Ferreira/&gt; Congenital cardiovascular deaths are reported to occur disproportionately in African-American athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology |volume=41 |issue=6 |date=March 2003 |pages=974–980 |title=Relationship of race to sudden cardiac death in competitive athletes with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy |vauthors=Maron BJ, Carney KP, Lever HM, Lewis JF, Barac I, Casey SA, Sherrid MV |doi=10.1016/S0735-1097(02)02976-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After age 35, acquired [[coronary artery disease]] predominates (80%),&lt;ref name=Ferreira/&gt; and this is true regardless of the athlete's former level of fitness.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Genetics==
===Cardiomyopathies===
[[File:Cardiac magnetic resonance Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia.gif|thumb|right|Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, showing fatty infiltration of right and left ventricle, and poor contraction of right ventricle]]
Cardiomyopathies are generally inherited as [[autosomal dominant]]s, although recessive forms have been described, and dilated cardiomyopathy can also be inherited in an [[X-linked]] pattern. Consequently, in addition to tragedy involving an athlete who succumbs, there are medical implications for close relatives. Among family members of [[index case]]s, more than 300 causative [[mutations]] have been identified. However, not all mutations have the same potential for severe outcomes, and there is not yet a clear understanding of how these mutations (which affect the same [[myosin]] protein molecule) can lead to the dramatically different [[phenotype|clinical characteristics]] and outcomes associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Understanding cardiomyopathy phenotypes based on the functional impact of mutations in the myosin motor |vauthors=Moore JR, Leinwand L, Warshaw DM | date=Jul 20, 2012 | journal=Circ Res | volume=111 | pages=375–85 | pmid=22821910 | doi=10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.223842 | issue=3| pmc=3947556 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since HCM, as an example, is typically an autosomal dominant trait, each child of an HCM parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. In individuals without a family history, the most common cause of the disease is a "de novo" mutation of the gene that produces the β-myosin heavy chain.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Channelopathies===
Sudden cardiac death can usually be attributed to cardiovascular disease or commotio cordis, but about 20% of cases show no obvious cause and remain undiagnosed after autopsy. Interest in these "autopsy-negative" deaths has centered around the "[[Channelopathy|ion channelopathies]]". These electrolyte channels are pores regulating the movement of sodium, potassium and calcium [[ion]]s into cardiac cells, collectively responsible for creating and controlling the electrical signals that govern the heart's rhythm. Abnormalities in this system occur in relatively rare genetic diseases such as [[Long QT syndrome]], [[Brugada syndrome]], and [[Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia]], all associated with sudden death.  Consequently, autopsy-negative sudden cardiac deaths (no physical abnormalities identified) may comprise a larger part of the channelopathies than previously anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests: an 8-year New York City experience |vauthors=Westfal RE, Reissman S, Doering G | date=Jul 1996 | journal=Am J Emerg Med | volume=14 | pages=364–8 | pmid=8768156 | doi=10.1016/S0735-6757(96)90050-9 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the 1990s: a population-based study in the Maastricht area on incidence, characteristics and survival |vauthors=de Vreede-Swagemakers JJ, Gorgels AP, Dubois-Arbouw WI, van Ree JW, Daemen MJ, Houben LG, Wellens HJ | date=Nov 1997 | journal=J Am Coll Cardiol | volume=30 | pages=1500–5 | pmid=9362408 | issue=6 | doi=10.1016/s0735-1097(97)00355-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heritable connective tissue diseases===
[[File:Myxomatous aortic valve.jpg|thumb|right|x120px|Myxomatous degeneration of the aortic valve, common in Marfan syndrome]]
Heritable connective tissue diseases are rare, each disorder estimated at one to ten per 100,000, of which [[Marfan syndrome]] is the most common. It is carried by the FBN1 gene on chromosome 15, which encodes the connective protein fibrillin-1,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Mutations in the fibrillin gene responsible for dominant ectopia lentis and neonatal Marfan syndrome |vauthors=Kainulainen K, Karttunen L, Puhakka L, Sakai L, Peltonen L | date=January 1994 | journal=Nat. Genet. | volume=6 | pages=64–9 | pmid=8136837 | doi=10.1038/ng0194-64 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Recent progress towards a molecular understanding of Marfan syndrome |vauthors=Dietz HC, Loeys B, Carta L, Ramirez F | date=November 2005 | journal=Am J Med Genet C Semin Med Genet | volume= 139C| pages=4–9 | pmid=16273535 | doi=10.1002/ajmg.c.30068 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; inherited as a dominant trait. This protein is essential for synthesis and maintenance of elastic fibers. Since these fibers are particularly abundant in the [[aorta]], ligaments, and the [[ciliary zonules]] of the eye, these areas are among the worst affected. Everyone has a pair of FBN1 genes and, because transmission is dominant, those who have inherited one affected FBN1 gene from either parent will have Marfan syndrome. Although it is most frequently inherited as an autosomal dominant, there is no family history in 25% of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Identifying heritable connective tissue disorders in childhood |vauthors=Armon K, Bale P | date=June 2012 | journal=Practitioner | volume=256 | pages=19–23, 2–3 | pmid=22916581 | issue=1752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recruiting practices aimed at attracting athletes who are unusually tall or who have an unusually wide arm span (characteristics of Marfan syndrome) can increase the prevalence of the syndrome within sports such as basketball and volleyball.

===DNA testing===
After a disease-causing mutation has been identified in an index case (which is not always accomplished conclusively), the main task is genetic identification of carriers within a pedigree, a sequential process known as "cascade testing". Family members with the same mutation may show different severities of disease, a phenomenon known as "variable [[penetrance]]". As a result, some may remain asymptomatic, with little lifelong evidence of disease. Nevertheless, their children remain at risk of inheriting the disorder and potentially being more severely affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Inherited cardiomyopathies |vauthors=Raju H, Alberg C, Sagoo GS, Burton H, Behr ER | date=Nov 21, 2011 | journal=BMJ | volume=343 | pmid=22106372 | pages=d6966 | doi=10.1136/bmj.d6966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Screening==
{{See also|Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy screening}}
[[File:PLAX Mmode.jpg|thumbnail|right|Echocardiogram showing left ventricle]]
Screening athletes for cardiac disease can be problematic because of low prevalence and inaccurate performance of various tests that have been used. Nevertheless, sudden death among seemingly healthy individuals attracts much public and legislator attention because of its visible and tragic nature.

As an example, the [[Texas Legislature]] appropriated US$1&amp;nbsp;million for a pilot study of statewide athlete screening in 2007. The study employed a combination of questionnaire, examination and [[electrocardiography]] for 2,506 student athletes, followed by [[echocardiography]] for 2,051 of them, including any students with abnormal findings from the first three steps. The questionnaire alone flagged 35% of the students as potentially at risk, but there were many [[false positive]] results, with actual disease being confirmed in less than 2%. Further, a substantial number of screen-positive students declined repeated recommendations for follow-up evaluation. (Individuals who are conclusively diagnosed with cardiac disease are usually told to avoid competitive sports.) It should be stressed that this was a single pilot program, but it was indicative of the problems associated with large-scale screening, and consistent with experience in other locations with low prevalence of sudden death in athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Lessons learned from preparticipation cardiovascular screening in a state funded program |vauthors=Zeltser I, Cannon B, Silvana L, Fenrich A, George J, Schleifer J, Garcia M, Barnes A, Rivenes S, Patt H, Rodgers G, Scott W | date=Jun 15, 2012 | journal=Am J Cardiol | volume=110 | pages=902–8 | pmid=22704711 | doi=10.1016/j.amjcard.2012.05.018 | issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidence==
Sudden cardiac death occurs in approximately one per 200,000 young athletes per year, usually triggered during competition or practice.&lt;ref name=Ferreira&gt;{{cite journal | title=Sudden cardiac death athletes: a systematic review |vauthors=Ferreira M, Santos-Silva PR, de Abreu LC, Valenti VE, Crispim V, Imaizumi C, Filho CF, Murad N, Meneghini A, Riera AR, de Carvalho TD, Vanderlei LC, Valenti EE, Cisternas JR, Moura Filho OF, Ferreira C | date=Aug 3, 2010 | journal=Sports Med Arthrosc Rehabil Ther Technol | volume= 2| page= 19| pmid=20682064 | doi=10.1186/1758-2555-2-19 | pmc=2923123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victim is usually male and associated with [[List of association footballers who died while playing|soccer]], [[List of basketball players who died during their careers|basketball]], [[List of ice hockey players who died during their playing career|ice hockey]], or [[List of American football players who died during their career|American football]], reflecting the large number of athletes participating in these sustained and strenuous sports.&lt;ref name=Maron2003/&gt; For a normally healthy age group, the risk appears to be particularly magnified in competitive basketball, with sudden cardiac death rates as high as one per 3,000 annually for male basketball players in [[NCAA]] Division I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Incidence of sudden cardiac death in National Collegiate Athletic Association athletes |vauthors=Harmon KG, Asif IM, Klossner D, Drezner JA | date=April 2011 | journal=Circulation | volume=123| pages=1594–1600 | pmid=21464047 | doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.004622 | issue=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is still far below the rate for the general population, estimated as one per 1,300–1,600 and dominated by the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Epidemiology of sudden cardiac death: clinical and research implications |vauthors=Chugh SS, Reinier K, Teodorescu C, Evanado A, Kehr E, Al Samara M, Mariani R, Gunson K, Jui J | date=Nov–Dec 2008 | journal=Prog Cardiovasc Dis | volume=51 | pages=213–28 | pmid=19026856 | doi=10.1016/j.pcad.2008.06.003 | issue=3 | pmc=2621010 |quote=For the world (total population approx. 6,540,000,000), the estimated annual burden of sudden cardiac death would be in the range of 4–5 million cases per year.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a population as large as the United States will experience the sudden cardiac death of a competitive athlete at the average rate of one every three days, often with significant local media coverage heightening public attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sudden Cardiac Death in the Athlete |last1=Link |first1=MS |last2=Estes |first2=NAM III |journal=Circulation |date=May 2012 |volume=125 |issue=20 |pages=2511–2516 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.023861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable cases==
&lt;!-- Editors: Maybe convert this to a sortable table or stand-alone list, and include in [[Category:Lists of people by medical condition]]? Or, since these notable deaths (lately averaging 3 or 4 uncontroversial blue-linked names per year) are the main reason for the prominence of the topic, just keeping the list here as the compact final section of this article would be consistent with [[WP:PROPORTION]] &amp; [[WP:MEDCASE]] &amp; [[WP:LISTPEOPLE]] guidelines. --&gt;

[[File:Yoshitoshi - 100 Aspects of the Moon - 97.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''Ubasute no tsuki'' (The Moon of Ubasute), by [[Yoshitoshi]]]]
{{nihongo3|"abandoning an old woman"|姥捨て|'''Ubasute'''|also called '''''obasute''''' and sometimes '''''oyasute''''' {{lang|ja|親捨て}} "abandoning a parent"}} is the mythical practice of [[senicide]] in [[Japan]], whereby an infirm or [[old age|elderly]] relative was carried to a mountain, or some other remote, desolate place, and left there to die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hoffman|first1=Michael|title=Aging through the ages|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2010/09/12/general/aging-through-the-ages#.V7ZSBiMrJFQ|accessdate=19 August 2016|publisher=The Japan Times|date=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Kodansha Illustrated Encyclopedia of Japan, ''ubasute'' "is the subject of [[legend]], but [...] does not seem ever to have been a common custom".&lt;ref&gt;Japan, An Illustrated Encyclopedia, Kodansha Ltd., Tokyo, 1993, on p. 1121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folklore==
Ubasute has left its mark on [[Japanese folklore]], where it forms the basis of many legends, [[Japanese poetry|poems]], and [[koan]]s. In one [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]] allegory, a son carries his mother up a mountain on his back. During the journey, she stretches out her arms, catching the twigs and scattering them in their wake, so that her son will be able to find the way home.

A poem commemorates the story:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
In the depths of the mountains,
Whom was it for the aged mother snapped
One twig after another?
Heedless of herself
She did so
For the sake of her son
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==In popular culture==
* The practice is discussed in some detail in [[Radiolab]] episode #305 Mortality. Ubasute sometimes appears as a metaphor for contemporary Japan's treatment of the elderly, who are noted for [[Suicide in Japan|above-average suicide rates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/2862051.stm Suicide 'epidemic' among Japan's elderly] [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The practice of ubasute is explored at length in the Japanese novel ''The Ballad of Narayama'' (1956) by [[Shichirō Fukazawa]]. The novel was the basis for three films: [[Keisuke Kinoshita]]'s ''[[The Ballad of Narayama (1958 film)|The Ballad of Narayama]]'' (1958), Korean director [[Kim Ki-young]]'s ''[[Goryeojang]]'' (1963), and [[Shohei Imamura]]'s ''[[The Ballad of Narayama (1983 film)|The Ballad of Narayama]]'', which won the [[Palme d'Or]] in [[1983 in film|1983]].
* ''[[The Old Law]]'', a 17th-century [[tragicomedy]] written by [[Thomas Middleton]], [[William Rowley]], and [[Philip Massinger]] and [[Anthony Trollope]]'s 1882 [[dystopia]]n novel, ''[[The Fixed Period]]'' also explore the concept of 'Ubasute' in a Western context.
* The characters of [[Christopher Buckley (novelist)|Christopher Buckley]]'s 2007 novel ''[[Boomsday (novel)|Boomsday]]'' introduce the concept of 'Ubasute' as a political ploy to stave off the insolvency of [[Social Security (United States)|social security]] as more and more of the aging US population reaches retirement age, angering the Religious Right and Baby Boomers.
* The concept of 'Ubasute' forms the basis of the storyline for the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Half a Life (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Half a Life]]".
* The musical ''[[Pacific Overtures]]'' contains a reference to Ubasute. During the song 'Four Black Dragons', as a city is being evacuated for fear of an American naval force, a panicked merchant is willing to abandon his aged mother during the evacuation, but the merchant is reminded that his son could do the same when the merchant is just as old. The merchant reluctantly picks up his mother and carries her on his back.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2716">'''Valaris''' ({{lang-el|Οὐάλαρις}}, died 542) was a [[Goths|Gothic]] soldier who fought for the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogoths]] against the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] in the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic War]].

Valaris was part of [[Totila]]'s army engaged at the [[Battle of Faventia]]. Before the battle Valaris approached the Romans on his horse and challenged any of them to do [[single combat]] with him.{{sfn|Amory|2003|p=432}} [[Procopius]] (''Gothic War'', III.4.21–29) describes Valaris as man of great physical size and martial skill. His martial appearance terrified the Roman soldiers, and only the [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[Artabazes (military officer)|Artabazes]] stood forth to accept the challenge. The duel was conducted on horseback, and Artabazes was able to hit Valaris on his right side with his spear, mortally wounding him. Valaris did not fall, however, being buttressed by his spear that was braced against a rock. While Artabazes was pushing his spear into his enemy trying to finish him off, Valaris' spear, standing almost upright, cut Artabazes' neck. Although the wound was not serious, it caused a great outpour of blood, which could not be halted. Valaris died on the spot, while Artabazes succumbed to the wound three days later.{{sfn|Dewing|1962|pp=186, 188}} While Artabazes was nurturing his wound in the rear, however, the Battle of Faventia resulted in a great victory for Totila's Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Dewing|1962|pp=188, 200}}

'''William de Forz, 3rd Earl of Albemarle''' (died 26 March 1242) was an [[Kingdom of England|English]] nobleman. He is described by [[William Stubbs]] as "a feudal adventurer of the worst type".

==Family background==
Forz was the son of [[William de Forz (died 1195)|William de Forz]] (died 1195), and [[Hawise, Countess of Aumale]] (died 11 March 1214), a daughter of [[William le Gros, 1st Earl of Albemarle]]. His father was a minor nobleman from the village of Fors in [[Poitou]]; the toponymic is variously rendered as Fors and Forz, or else [[List of Latinised names|Latinised]] to ''Fortibus''.

==Estate holdings==
Soon after 1213, Albemarle was established by [[John I of England|King John]] in the territories of the Earldom of Albemarle, and in 1215 the whole of his mother's estates were formally confirmed to him. The Earldom of [[Duke of Albemarle|Albemarle]] which he inherited from his mother, included a large estate in [[Yorkshire]], notably the [[wapentake]] of [[Holderness]], including the castle of [[Skipsea Castle|Skipsea]], and the honour of [[Craven]], as well as estates in [[Lincolnshire]] and elsewhere. It had also included the [[county of Aumale]], but this had recently been lost to the French, along with the rest of [[Normandy]].  Albemarle was the first holder of his earldom to see it as wholly English.

==Involvement in military actions==
Albemarle was actively engaged in the struggles of the [[Normans|Norman]] barons against both King John and [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]]. He was generally loyal to King John during the baronial revolt, although he did eventually join the barons after the leaders of the [[City of London]] joined them and the king's cause looked hopeless.

Albemarle was one of the twenty-five executors of the [[Magna Carta]], but among them he was probably the least hostile to the king. The barons made him constable of [[Scarborough Castle]], but when soon after fighting began between the barons and the king, he went over to John's side, the only executor to do so. He fought for the king until the French capture of Winchester in June 1216, when again the king's cause looked hopeless. He then stayed on the barons side until their cause fell apart. He sided with John, then subsequently changed sides as often as it suited his policy.

After John's death, Albemarle supported the new king, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], fighting in the siege of [[Mountsorrel]] and at the [[Battle of Lincoln (1217)|Battle of Lincoln]].

His real object was to revive the independent power of the feudal barons, and he co-operated to this end with [[Falkes de Breauté]] and other foreign adventurers established in the country by John. This brought him into conflict with the great justiciar, [[Hubert de Burgh]], who was effectively regent. In 1219 he was declared a rebel and excommunicated for attending a forbidden tournament. In 1220 matters were brought to a crisis by his refusal to surrender the two royal castles of [[Rockingham Castle|Rockingham]] and [[Sauvey Castle|Sauvey]] of which he had been made constable in 1216. Henry III marched against them in person, the garrisons fled, and they fell without a blow. In the following year, however, Albemarle, in face of further efforts to reduce his power, rose in revolt.

==Excommunication and loss of power==
Albemarle was now again [[excommunication|excommunicated]] by the legate [[Pandulf Verraccio]] at a solemn council held in [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]], and the whole force of the kingdom was set in motion against him, a special scutage—the ''scutagium de Bihan''—being voted for this purpose by the Great Council. The capture of his Castle of [[Castle Bytham|Bytham]] broke his power; he sought sanctuary and, at Pandulph's intercession, was pardoned on condition of going for six years to the [[Holy Land]]. He remained in England, however, and in 1223 was once more in revolt with Falkes de Breauté and other turbulent spirits. A reconciliation was once more patched up; but it was not until the fall of Falkes de Breauté that Albemarle finally settled down as an English noble.

He eventually gave in when the cause was lost in 1224, and was thenceforth loyal to Henry III.

==Revived influence==
In 1225 Albemarle witnessed Henry's third re-issue of the Great Charter; in 1227 he went as English ambassador to [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]]; and in 1230 he accompanied Henry on his expedition to Brittany. In 1241 he set out for the [[Holy Land]], but died at sea, on his way there, on 26 March 1242.

==Family==
By his wife Aveline de Montfichet (Modern English: Avelina), a sister of [[Richard de Montfichet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{MLCC |warning=1 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/ENGLISHNOBILITYMEDIEVAL3L-O.htm#AvelineMontfichetdied1239 |title-date= |title=ENGLISH NOBILITYMEDIEVAL 3L-O: Aveline Montfichet died1239 &lt;!--Bot generated--&gt;|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; William left a son, [[William de Forz, 4th Earl of Albemarle]], who succeeded him in the Earldom.
