The '''abstract system of title transfer''' (German ''Abstraktionsprinzip'') is a legal term in [[Law of Germany|German law]] relating to the [[law of obligations]] (''Schuldrecht'') and [[property law]] (''Eigentumsrecht''). Although no express reference to it is made in the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German Civil Code]] (BGB), the concept of separating a personal undertaking to pay or exchange goods or legal rights (e.g. through [[contract]]) from the conveyance of title to those goods or legal rights (e.g. through a [[deed]] or [[land registration]]) is fundamental to German [[private law]] (as well as [[Dutch law]], [[South African property law|South African law]], and [[Common law system|Common law]]).

==General features==
Abstract title transfer dominates the entire BGB and is vital for the understanding of how it treats legal transactions, such as [[contract]]s. For example, under the BGB's system, [[ownership]] is not transferred by a sale contract, as in some other jurisdictions (e.g. France, Spain, Italy, etc.). Instead, the sale contract merely obligates the seller to transfer ownership of the good sold to the buyer, while the buyer is obligated to pay the stipulated price. The buyer does not automatically gain ownership by virtue of the contract of sale whereas the seller has not automatically gained ownership of the money. Article 433 of the BGB explicitly states this obligation of the seller, as well as the buyer's obligation to pay the agreed upon price and take the thing he bought. So, seller and buyer have just made reciprocal undertakings and gained reciprocal obligations. For transfer of ownership, another contract is necessary which is governed by ss. 929 et seq. Thus, in a simple purchase of goods paid immediately in cash, German civil law interprets the transaction as (at least) three contracts: the contract of sale itself, obligating the seller to transfer ownership of the product to the buyer and the buyer to pay the price; a contract that transfers ownership of the product to the buyer, fulfilling the seller’s obligation; and a contract that transfers ownership of the money (bills and coins) from the buyer to the seller, fulfilling the buyer’s obligation.

This doesn't mean that contracts in Germany are more complicated to the people involved. Especially the contracts of everyday life don't differ from those in other countries in their outer appearance. For instance, if someone buys a newspaper at a newsstand without saying one single word to the seller, all the three abovementioned contracts are performed and can be construed to have been performed from the parties' behavior.

==Function==
Although abstract title transfer seemingly contradicts the usual common sense interpretation of commercial transactions, it is undisputed among the German legal community. The main advantage of the abstract system is its ability to provide a secure legal construction to nearly any financial transaction however complicated this transaction may be. A good example is retention of title. If someone buys something and pays the purchase price by installments, the system faces two conflicting interests: the buyer wants to have the purchased goods immediately, whereas the seller wants to secure full payment of the purchase price. Under abstract title transfer, the BGB has a simple answer to that: the purchase contract obligates the buyer to pay the full price and requires the seller to transfer property upon receipt of the last installment. Since the obligations and the actual conveyance of title are in two different contracts, it is quite simple to secure both parties' interests. The seller retains title up to the last payment, and the buyer is merely the holder of the purchased goods. If he fails to pay in full the seller may reclaim his property just like any other owner.

==Critics==
Critics say that what German legal scholars call ''Verpflichtungsgeschäft'' and ''Verfügungsgeschäft'' (i.e. undertakings vs. conveyance) are actually the same thing, but expressed in other words. Stating that this difference turns the transaction into something more secure is a false inference. In fact, all other jurisdictions preserve the same certainty through other legal doctrines and devices in their civil codes, not necessarily demanding a double-analysis of the same matter and treating it like two different legal acts.

This is the main criticism of those jurisdictions that follow the opposite system, the causal system of title transfer (Germ: ''Kausalprinzip'' or ''Prinzip der kausalen Tradition''), which follows the [[canon law]] [[Legal maxim|maxim]] ''solo consensus obligat'', under which the [[meeting of the minds]] in a [[contract of sale]] is sufficient both to create obligations and convey title. This includes mainly jurisdictions that have adopted or been influenced by the [[Napoleonic Code]], e.g. [[Law of France|France]], [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana]], [[Quebec law|Quebec]], [[Law of Spain|Spain]], [[Law of Portugal|Portugal]], [[African French|French-speaking Africa]], much of Latin America, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9001">'''Acosmism''', in contrast to [[pantheism]], denies the [[reality]] of the [[universe]], seeing it as ultimately [[illusion|illusory]], (the prefix "a-" in [[Greek language|Greek]] meaning negation; like "un-" in English), and only the [[Infinity|infinite]] [[unmanifest]] [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] as real.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/3977/acosmism Acosmism] Encyclopædia Britannica (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptual versions of Acosmism are found in eastern and western philosophies.

==In Eastern philosophy==
{{main|Maya (Illusion)}}
The concept of Maya in the non-dual Advaita Vedanta school of [[Hinduism]] is a form of acosmism. Maya means "illusion, appearances".&lt;ref&gt;PD Shastri, [https://archive.org/details/thedoctrineofmaa00shaauoft The Doctrine of Maya] Luzac &amp; Co, London, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Radhakrishnan, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2376777 The Vedanta Philosophy and the Doctrine of Maya], International Journal of Ethics, Vol. 24, No. 4 (Jul., 1914), pages 431-451&lt;/ref&gt; The universe is considered to be Māyā, however this does not mean universe is considered as unreal. [[Wendy Doniger]] explains, "to say that the universe is an illusion (māyā) is not to say that it is unreal; it is to say, instead, that it is not what it seems to be, that it is something constantly being made. Māyā not only deceives people about the things they think they know; more basically, it limits their knowledge to things that are epistemologically and ontologically second-rate."&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty (1986), Dreams, Illusion, and Other Realities, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226618555}}, page 119&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Vedanta]] school of Hinduism, the perceived world is Maya that hides the Absolute and Ultimate Reality (Brahman).&lt;ref&gt;Donald Braue (2006), Maya in Radhakrishnan's Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120822979}}, pages 19-21&lt;/ref&gt; The human mind constructs a subjective experience, states Vedanta, which leads to the peril of misunderstanding Maya as well as interpreting Maya as the only and final reality. Vedantins assert the "perceived world including people are not what they appear to be, there is more to them than their perceived physical forms".&lt;ref&gt;HM Vroom (1989), Religions and the Truth: Philosophical Reflections and Perspectives, Eerdmans Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0802805027}}, pages 122-123&lt;/ref&gt; Māyā is that which manifests, perpetuates a sense of false [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|duality]] (or divisional plurality).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brodd | first = Jefferey | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = World Religions | publisher = Saint Mary's Press | year = 2003 | location = Winona, MN | pages = | url = | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-88489-725-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This manifestation is real, but it obfuscates and eludes the hidden principles and true nature of reality. Vedanta holds that liberation is the unfettered realization and understanding of these invisible principles, primarily that the individual Self (Soul) is the same as the Self in others and the Self in everything (Brahman).&lt;ref&gt;PD Shastri, [https://archive.org/details/thedoctrineofmaa00shaauoft The Doctrine of Maya] Luzac &amp; Co, London, page 58-73&lt;/ref&gt;

Advaita Vedanta school is best described as monistic, [[Idealism#Absolute idealism|absolute idealism]], while Dvaita Vedanta school as [[Idealism#Pluralistic idealism|pluralistic idealism]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Craig (1998), Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415187152}}, pages 197-198&lt;/ref&gt; Both have elements of ontological acosmism, where the material aspect of cosmos is considered an "illusion, appearance, incomplete reality" compared to that "which is spiritual, eternal, unchanging". In [[Advaita Vedanta]] philosophy, there are two realities: ''Vyavaharika'' (empirical reality) and ''Paramarthika'' (absolute, spiritual reality).&lt;ref name=fredfost&gt;Frederic F. Fost (1998), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1400333 Playful Illusion: The Making of Worlds in Advaita Vedānta], Philosophy East and West, Vol. 48, No. 3 (Jul., 1998), pages 387-405&lt;/ref&gt; Māyā is a fact in that it is the appearance of phenomena. Brahman (Ultimate Reality, Absolute, Cosmic Soul) is held by Advaitins as the metaphysical truth. The perceived world, Māyā is true in epistemological and empirical sense; however, Māyā is not considered by Vedantins as the metaphysical and spiritual truth. The spiritual truth is the truth forever, while what is empirical truth is only true for now. Since Māyā is the perceived material world, it is true in perception context, but is "untrue" in spiritual context of Brahman. True Reality, to Advaita scholars, includes both ''Vyavaharika'' (empirical) and ''Paramarthika'' (spiritual), the Māyā and the Brahman. The goal of spiritual enlightenment, state Advaitins, is to realize one's soul as same as Cosmic Soul (Brahman), realize the eternal, fearless, resplendent Oneness.&lt;ref name=fredfost/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arvind Sharma (2007), Advaita Vedānta: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120820272}}, pages 19-40, 53-58, 79-86&lt;/ref&gt;

Advaita Hinduism and [[Buddhism]] have both been called as examples of acosmism.&lt;ref name=eowr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eduard von Hartmann, {{Google books|XDARAAAAYAAJ|The religion of the future|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LP Jack, {{Google books|5v1PAAAAYAAJ|Hibbert Journal: A Quarterly Review of Religion|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars state Buddhism cannot be accurately classified as a philosophy based on acosmism,&lt;ref name=eowr&gt;Encyclopedia of World Religions, Encyclopædia Britannica (1986), page 9, {{ISBN|978-1593394912}} (2006 Reprint)&lt;/ref&gt; and that Advaita Vedanta is not acosmism either.&lt;ref&gt;PT Raju (1985), Structural Depths of Indian Thought, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0887061394}}, page 409&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Western philosophy==
Acosmism has been seen in the work of a number of [[Western philosophy|Western philosophers]], including [[Parmenides]], [[Plato]], [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Georg Hegel|Hegel]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], and [[British idealism|British]] and American idealists, such as [[F.H. Bradley]].&lt;ref&gt;Stace, W.T. (1952). ''[[Time and Eternity (philosophy book)|Time and Eternity]]'', Princeton University Press. p.122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, Hugh. (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=TEMYRQi1u1cC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118 ''Comparative Theology and the Problem of Religious Rivalry''], OUP. p.118&lt;/ref&gt; The word acosmism is often traced to Hegel who used it in his discussion of the [[philosophy of religion]], in particular his understanding of [[pantheism]] and refutation of the charge that Spinoza was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] ''Acosmism'' entry.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Inwood, M.J. (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=OVgWWppVQxIC&amp;lpg=PA256&amp;lpg=PA232 ''Hegel''], Psychology Press. {{ISBN|9780415277198}}. pp.232-233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beiser, Frederick. (2005).  
[https://books.google.com/books?id=LkDYNPUkztIC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA143 ''Hegel''], Routledge. {{ISBN|9781134383924}}. pp.143-144&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel explains that for Spinoza it is the infinite '[[Baruch Spinoza#Substance.2C attributes and modes|substance]]' which is real, while the finite world doesn't exist. "But the accusers of Spinozism are unable to liberate themselves from the finite; hence they declare for Spinozism everything is God, because it is precisely the aggregate of finitudes (the world) that has there disappeared. If one employs the expression "All is One" and [claims] therefore that unity is the truth of multiplicity, then the "all" simply is no longer. The multiplicity vanishes, for it has its truth in the unity."&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. Hodgson, Peter C. Ed. (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=tVyVUAMoO_oC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29 ''Hegel: Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion: One-Volume Edition, The Lectures of 1827''], OUP. {{ISBN|9780199283521}}. pp.28-29 &amp; 123-126&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Terence Stace|W.T. Stace]] sees all philosophical acosmism as rooted in the [[Mysticism#Mystical experience|mystical experience]], whether or not the authors are aware of this. Stace points out that most Western philosophers tend to a form of qualified acosmism, where the world is less real rather than utterly illusory. He sees two mystical sources of acosmism from within the eternal moment, firstly the mystical moment contains all eternity and infinity and thus there is nothing outside it, and secondly because the eternal moment is experienced as the supreme value.&lt;ref&gt;Stace. (1952) p.123-127&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4131">'''Alan Claude Robin Goldsmid Montefiore''' (born 29 December 1926, London) is a British philosopher and Emeritus Fellow of [[Balliol College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name=Balliol/&gt; He has been President of the Forum for European Philosophy;&lt;ref name=LSE/&gt; Joint President of the [[Wiener Library]], and a former Chair of Council of the [[Froebel Educational Institute]].&lt;ref name=Dir/&gt; 

He is the son of Leonard Montefiore (1889-1961) who had been the Wiener Library's second president and later its chairman.&lt;ref name=Barkow/&gt; He is also grandson of [[Claude Joseph Goldsmid Montefiore]] (1858–1938), a past president of the [[Anglo-Jewish Association]].

==Early life and education==
He was educated at [[Clifton College]]  a boarding school which had a separate house for Jewish boys. –He then did [[conscription in the United Kingdom|national service]] as a soldier in [[Singapore]].&lt;ref name=Dict/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt;

==Philosophy and identity==
A recurring theme of Montefiore's philosophical enquiries is the notion of identity. His philosophical arguments can be characterized as addressing four related concerns which, inevitably given his own Jewish origins, revolve around notions of Jewish identity. His book ''A Philosophical Retrospective''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Montefiore|first1=Alan|title=A Philosophical Retrospective; facts, values and Jewish Identity|date=2011|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231526791}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarizes his thinking so that the four themes become evident:
1.	concerns the issue of how far it may be in anyone’s meaningful power to determine the nature and implications of their own identity—not only but especially in the case of those who may be considered by themselves or by others to be Jews;
2.	concerns questions of how far the possession of a Jewish identity is to be seen as bound up with a relationship to Judaism as a system of religious belief and/or practice and of what might be the longer-term prospects for a purely secular Jewish identity, whether in Israel or in the Diaspora; 
3.	 concerns an apparent tension between Judaism’s claim to being both a religion of universal import and yet that of a historically very particular people;
4.	Montefiore’s personal perspective as being identified as a Jew and whether or not the possession of a Jewish identity is to be understood as carrying with it the acceptance of any particular obligations as to how to order one’s life.

'''Apophatic theology''', also known as '''negative theology''',{{sfn|McCombs|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=_cbuGVI_UNAC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22negative+theology%22%22apophatic+theology%22%22via+negativa%22%22via+negationis%22 84]}} is a form of [[theology|theological]] thinking and religious practice which attempts to [[Problem of religious language|approach God]], the Divine, by [[negation]], to speak only in terms of what may not be said about the perfect goodness that is [[God]].{{r|Bunnin_Yu|group=web}} It forms a pair together with [[cataphatic theology]], which approaches God or the Divine by affirmations or positive statements about what God ''is''.{{r|DC_interview|group=web}}

The apophatic tradition is often, though not always, allied with the approach of [[mysticism]], which aims at the vision of God, the perception of the divine reality beyond the realm of [[Perception|ordinary perception]].{{sfn|Belzen|Geels|2003|p=84–87}}

==Etymology and definition==
"Apophatic", {{lang-grc|ἀπόφασις}} ([[adjective]]); from ἀπόφημι ''apophēmi'', meaning "to deny". From ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'': 
{{quote|apophatic (adj.) "involving a mention of something one feigns to deny; involving knowledge obtained by negation", 1850, from Latinized form of Greek ''apophatikos'', from apophasis "denial, negation", from apophanai "to speak off," from apo "off, away from" (see apo-) + phanai "to speak," related to pheme "voice," from PIE root *bha- (2) "to speak, tell, say."{{r|OED|group=web}}}}

''Via negativa'' or ''via negationis'' ([[Latin]]), "negative way" or "by way of denial".{{sfn|McCombs|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=_cbuGVI_UNAC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22negative+theology%22%22apophatic+theology%22%22via+negativa%22%22via+negationis%22 84]}} The negative way forms a pair together with the ''[[kataphatic]]'' or positive way. According to Deirdre Carabine,
{{quote|Dionysius describes the kataphatic or affirmative way to the divine as the "way of speech": that we can come to some understanding of the Transcendent by attributing all the perfections of the created order to God as its source. In this sense, we can say "God is Love", "God is Beauty", "God is Good". The apophatic or negative way stresses God's absolute transcendence and unknowability in such a way that we cannot say anything about the divine essence because God is so totally beyond being. The dual concept of the immanence and transcendence of God can help us to understand the simultaneous truth of both "ways" to God: at the same time as God is immanent, God is also transcendent. At the same time as God is knowable, God is also unknowable. God cannot be thought of as one or the other only.{{r|DC_interview|group=web}}}}

==Origins and development==
According to Fagenblat, "negative theology is as old as philosophy itself;" elements of it can be found in Plato's "unwritten doctrines," while it is also present in Neo-Platonic, Gnostic and early Christian writers. A tendency to apophatic thought can also be found in [[Philo of Alexandria]].{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=4}}

According to Carabine, "apophasis proper" in Greek thought starts with Neo-Platonism, with its speculations about the nature of the One, culminating in the works of Proclus.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}} According to Carabine, there are two major points in the development of apophatic theology, namely the fusion of the Jewish tradition with Platonic philosophy in the writings of Philo, and the works of Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite, who infused Christian thought with Neo-Platonic ideas.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}}

The Early Church Fathers were influenced by Philo,{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}} and Meredith even states that Philo "is the real founder of the apophatic tradition."{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}} Yet, it was with [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] and [[Maximus the Confessor]],{{sfn|Berthold|1985|p=9}} whose writings shaped both [[Hesychasm]], the contemplative tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Churches, and the mystical traditions of western Europe, that apophatic theology became a central element of Christian theology and contemplative practice.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}}

==Greek philosophy==
{{See also|Epoché|Pyrrhonism|Skepticism}}

===Pre-Socratic===
For the ancient Greeks, knowledge of the gods was essential for proper worship.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} Poets had an important responsibility in this regard, and a central question was how knowledge of the Divine forms can be attained.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} [[Epiphany (feeling)|Epiphany]] played an essential role in attaining this knowledge.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} [[Xenophanes]] (c. 570 – c. 475 BC) noted that the knowledge of the Divine forms is restrained by the human imagination, and Greek philosophers realized that this knowledge can only be mediated through myth and visual representations, which are culture-dependent.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}}

According to [[Herodotus]] (484–425 BCE), [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]] (between 750 and 650 BC) taught the Greek the knowledge of the Divine bodies of the Gods.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=51}} The ancient Greek poet Hesiod (between 750 and 650 BC) describes in his ''[[Theogony]]'' the birth of the gods and creation of the world,{{r|ellopsos|group=web}} which became an "ur-text for programmatic, first-person [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphanic]] narratives in Greek literature,"{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}}{{refn|group=note|Hesiod's ''Theogony'' was highly referred in the time of [[Plato]] (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BCE), and Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' shows a profound familiarity with Hesiod's ''Theogony''.{{sfn|Boys-Stones|Haubold|2009|p=xiviii}} See also Timaeus e39-e41.{{r|ellopsos|group=web}}}} but also "explores the necessary limitations placed on human access to the divine."{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} According to Platt, the statement of the Muses who grant Hesiod knowledge of the Gods "actually accords better with the logic of apophatic religious thought."{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=53}}{{refn|group=note|Richard G. Geldard: "[M]ore than any other pre-Socratic thinker, Heraclitus embodies the apophatic method. He "unsaid" the myths of the Archaic tradition on his way to transforming the ideas of divinity through the divine Logos. It was a transformation affirmed by Plotinus 800 years later."{{sfn|Geldard|2000|p=23}}}}

[[Parmenides]] (fl. late sixth or early fifth century BC), in his poem ''On Nature'', gives an account of a revelation on two ways of inquiry. "The way of conviction" explores Being, true reality ("what-is"), which is "What is ungenerated and deathless,/whole and uniform, and still and perfect."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=109-111}} "The way of opinion" is the world of appearances, in which one's sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful. His distinction between unchanging Truth and shifting opinion is reflected in Plato's [[allegory of the Cave]]. Together with the Biblical story of Moses's ascent of Mount Sinai, it is used by Gregory of Nyssa and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite to give a Christian account of the ascent of the soul toward God.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=111-112}} Cook notes that Parmenides poem is a religious account of a mystical journey, akin to the [[mystery cults]],{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=109}} giving a philosophical form to a religious outlook.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=112}} Cook further notes that the philosopher's task is to "attempt through 'negative' thinking to tear themselves loose from all that frustrates their pursuit of wisdom."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=112}}

===Plato===
[[File:Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377.jpg|thumb|Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377]]
[[Plato]] (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BCE), "deciding for Parmenides against [[Heraclitus]]" and his theory of eternal change,{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} had a strong influence on the development of apophatic thought.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}}

Plato further explored Parmenides's idea of timeless truth in his dialogue ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', which is a treatment of the [[Theory of Forms|eternal forms]], ''Truth, Beauty and Goodness'', which are the real aims for knowledge.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} The Theory of Forms is Plato's answer to the problem "how one unchanging reality or essential{{clarify|date=July 2017}} being can admit of many changing phenomena (and not just by dismissing them as being mere illusion)."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}}

In ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Plato argues that the "real objects of knowledge are not the changing objects of the senses, but the immutable Forms,"{{r|EoP_Plato(Republic)|group=web}} stating that the ''[[Form of the Good]]''{{refn|group=note|Identified by various commentators with the Form of Unity.{{explain|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}}} is the highest object of knowledge.{{sfn|Kahn|1998|p=61}}{{sfn|Phillips|2008|p=234}}{{r|EoP_Plato(Republic)|group=web}}{{refn|group=note|See ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' 508d–e, 511b, 516b)}} His argument culminates in the [[Allegory of the Cave]], in which he argues that humans are like prisoners in a cave, who can only see shadows of the Real, the ''Form of the Good''.{{sfn|Phillips|2008|p=234}}{{r|EoP_Plato(Republic)|group=web}} Humans are to be educated to search for knowledge, by turning away from their bodily desires toward higher contemplation, culminating in an intellectual{{refn|group=note|As opposed to mere rationality.}} understanding or apprehension of the Forms, c.q. the "first principles of all knowledge."{{sfn|Phillips|2008|p=234}}

According to Cook, the ''Theory of Forms'' has a theological flavour, and had a strong influence on the ideas of his Neo-Platonist interpreters Proclus and Plotinus.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} The pursuit of ''Truth, Beauty and Goodness'' became a central element in the apophatic tradition,{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} but nevertheless, according to Carabine "Plato himself cannot be regarded as the founder of the negative way."{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=21}} Carabine warns not to read later Neo-Platonic and Christian understandings into Plato, and notes that Plato did not identify his Forms with "one transcendent source," an identification which his later interpreters made.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=21-22}}

===Middle Platonism===
{{Main|Middle Platonism}}

[[Middle Platonism]] (1st century BCE - 3rd century CE){{r|IEP_Middle_Platonism|group=web}} further investigated Plato's "Unwritten Doctrines," which drew on [[Pythagoras]]' first principles of the [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]] and the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|Dyad]] (matter).{{r|IEP_Middle_Platonism|group=web}} Middle Platonism proposed a [[hierarchy of being]], with God as its first principle at its top, identifying it with Plato's ''Form of the Good''.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} An influential proponent of Middle Platonism was [[Philo of Alexandria|Philo]] (c.25 BCE–c. 50 CE), who employed Middle Platonic philosophy in his interpretation of the Hebrew scriptures, and asserted a strong influence on early Christianity.{{r|IEP_Middle_Platonism|group=web}} According to Craig D. Allert, "Philo made a monumental contribution to the creation of a vocabulary for use in negative statements about God."{{sfn|Allert|2002|p=89}} For Philo, God is undescribable, and he uses terms which emphasize God's transcendence.{{sfn|Allert|2002|p=89}}

===Neo-Platonism===
{{Main|Neo-Platonism}}

Neo-Platonism was a mystical or contemplative form of Platonism, which "developed outside the mainstream of Academic Platonism."{{r|IEP_Neo-Platonism|group=web}} It started with the writings of Plotinus (204/5–270), and ended with the closing of the Platonic Academy by Emperor Justinian in 529 CE, when the pagan traditions were ousted.{{r|IEP_Plotinus|group=web}} It is a product of Hellenistic syncretism, which developed due to the crossover between Greek thought and the Jewish scriptures, and also gave birth to [[Gnosticism]].{{r|IEP_Neo-Platonism|group=web}} Proclus was the last head of the Platonic Academy; his student Pseudo-Dinosysius had a far-stretching Neo-Platonic influence on Christianity and Christian mysticism.{{r|IEP_Neo-Platonism|group=web}}

====Plotinus====
[[File:Plotinus.jpg|thumb|left|Plotinus]]
[[Plotinus]] (204/5–270) was the founder of Neo-Platonism.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} In the [[Neoplatonism|Neo-Platonic philosophy]] of Plotinus and Proclus, the first principle became even more elevated as a radical unity, which was presented as an unknowable Absolute.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} For Plotinus, ''the One'' is the first principle, from which everything else emanates.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} He took it from Plato's writings, identifying the Good of the ''Republic'', as the cause of the other Forms, with ''the One'' of the first hypothesis of the second part of the ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]''.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} For Plotinus, ''the One'' precedes the [[Theory of Forms|Forms]],{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} and "is beyond Mind and indeed beyond Being."{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} From ''the One'' comes the [[Nous|Intellect]], which contains all the Forms.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} ''The One'' is the principle of Being, while the Forms are the principle of the essence of beings, and the intelligibility which can recognize them as such.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} Plotinus's third principle is Soul, the desire for objects external to the person. The highest satisfaction of desire is the contemplation of ''the One'',{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} which unites all existents "as a single, all-pervasive reality."{{r|IEP_Plotinus|group=web}}

''The One'' is radically simple, and does not even have self-knowledge, since self-knowledge would imply multiplicity.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} Nevertheless, Plotinus does urge for a search for the Absolute, turning inward and becoming aware of the "presence of the intellect in the human soul,"{{refn|group=note|Compare Korean Chon (Zen) master [[Jinul]]s "tracing back the radiance":&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;''"Question: What is the mind of void and calm, numinous awareness?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chinul: What has just asked me this question is precisely your mind of void and calm, numinous awareness.

{{quote|Our thought cannot grasp the One as long as any other image remains active in the soul [...] To this end, you must set free your soul from all outward things and turn wholly within yourself, with no more leaning to what lies outside, and lay your mind bare of ideal forms, as before of the objects of sense, and forget even yourself, and so come within sight of that One.}}

Carabine notes that Plotinus' apophasis is not just a mental exercise, an acknowledgement of the unknowability of ''the One'', but a means to ''[[Ecstasy (philosophy)|extasis]]'' and an ascent to "the unapproachable light that is God."{{r|Carabine_interview|group=web}} Pao-Shen Ho, investigating what are Plotinus' methods for reaching ''[[henosis]]'',{{refn|group=note|The Neoplatonic concept of ''henosis'' has precedents in the Greek [[mystery religions]]{{sfn|Angus|1975|p=52}} as well as parallels in [[Eastern philosophy]].{{sfn|Gregorios|2002}}}} concludes that "Plotinus' mystical teaching is made up of two practices only, namely philosophy and negative theology."{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} According to Moore, Plotinus appeals to the "non-discursive, intuitive faculty of the soul," by "calling for a sort of prayer, an invocation of the deity, that will permit the soul to lift itself up to the unmediated, direct, and intimate contemplation of that which exceeds it (V.1.6)."{{r|IEP_Plotinus|group=web}} Pao-Shen Ho further notes that "for Plotinus, mystical experience is irreducible to philosophical arguments."{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} The argumentation about ''henosis'' is preceded by the actual experience of it, and can only be understood when ''henosis'' has been attained.{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} Ho further notes that Plotinus's writings have a didactic flavour, aiming to "bring his own soul and ''the souls of others'' by way of [[Nous|Intellect]] to union with the One."{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} As such, the ''Enneads'' as a spiritual or ascetic teaching device, akin to ''The Cloud of Unknowing'',{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20-21}} demonstrating the methods of philosophical and apophatic inquiry.{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=26}} Ultimately, this leads to silence and the abandonment of all intellectual inquiry, leaving contemplation and unity.{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=25-27}}

====Proclus====
[[Proclus]] (412-485) introduced the terminology which is being used in apophatic and cataphatic theology.{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=139}} He did this in the second book of his ''Platonic Theology'', arguing that Plato states that ''the One'' can be revealed "through analogy," and that "through negations [''dia ton apophaseon''] its transcendence over everything can be shown."{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=139}} For Proclus, apophatic and cataphonic theology form a contemplatory pair, with the apophatic approach corresponding to the manifestation of the world from ''the One'', and cataphonic theology corresponding to the return to ''the One''.{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=140}} The analogies are affirmations which direct us toward ''the One'', while the negations underlie the confirmations, being closer to ''the One''.{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=140}} According to Luz, Proclus also attracted students from other faiths, including the Samaritan Marinus. Luz notes that "Marinus' Samaritan origins with its Abrahamic notion of a single [[Ineffability|ineffable]] [[Tetragrammaton|Name of God]] ({{Hebrew|יהוה}}) should also have been in many ways compatible with the school's ineffable and apophatic divine principle."{{sfn|Luz|2017|p=149}}

The [[Book of Revelation]] 8:1 mentions "the silence of the perpetual choir in heaven." According to Dan Merkur,
{{quote|The silence of the perpetual choir in heaven had mystical connotations, because silence attends the disappearance of plurality during experiences of mystical oneness. The term "silence" also alludes to the "still small voice" ([[1 Kings]] {{bibleverse-nb|1 Kings|19:12|HE|}}) whose [[theophany|revelation]] to [[Elijah]] on [[Mount Horeb]] rejected visionary imagery by affirming a negative theology.{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=331}}{{refn|group=note|According to Michel Masson, Elijah's theophany is an "apophatic revelation," a mystical experience which is akin to ''nirvana'' and Böhme's ''Ungrund''."

===Early Church Fathers===
The [[Early Church Fathers]] were influenced by [[Philo of Alexandria|Philo]]{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}} (c. 25 BCE – c. 50 CE), who saw [[Moses]] as "the model of human virtue and Sinai as the archetype of man's ascent into the "luminous darkness" of God."{{sfn|Woloschak|2016}} His interpretation of Moses was followed by Clement of Alexandria, [[Origen]], the Cappadocian Fathers, Pseudo-Dionysius, and Maximus the Confessor.{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=220}}{{sfn|Lane|2007|p=67}}{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}}{{sfn|Boersma|2013|p=243}}

God's appearance to Moses in the [[burning bush]] was often elaborated on by the Early Church Fathers,{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=220}} especially [[Gregory of Nyssa]] (c. 335 – c. 395),{{sfn|Lane|2007|p=67}}{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}}{{sfn|Boersma|2013|p=243}} realizing the fundamental unknowability of God;{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=220}}{{sfn|Mayes|2016|p=117]}} an exegesis which continued in the medieval mystical tradition.{{sfn|Glasscoe|1992|p=57]}} Their response is that, although God is unknowable, Jesus as person can be followed, since "following Christ is the human way of seeing God."{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=221}}

[[Clement of Alexandria]] (c. 150 – c. 215) was an early proponent of apophatic theology.{{sfn|Hägg|2006}}{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}} According to R.A. Baker, in Clement's writings the term ''theoria'' develops further from a mere intellectual "seeing" toward a spirutal form of contemplation.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=88}} Clement's apophatic theology or philosophy is closely related to this kind of ''theoria'' and the "mystic vision of the soul."{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=88}} For Clement, God is transcendent and immanent.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=89}} According to Baker, Clement's apophaticism is mainly driven by Biblical texts, but by the Platonic tradition.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=92-92}} His conception of an ineffable God is a synthesis of Plato and Philo, as seen from a Biblical perspective.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=92}} According to Osborne, it is a synthesis in a Biblical framework; according to Baker, while the Platonic tradition accounts for the negative approach, the Biblical tradition accounts for the positive approach.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=92-93}} ''Theoria'' and abstraction is the means to conceive of this ineffable God; it is preceded by dispassion.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=98-103}}

According to [[Tertullian]] (c. 155 – c. 240),
{{quote|[t]hat which is infinite is known only to itself.  This it is which gives some notion of God, while yet beyond all our conceptions{{spndash}}our very incapacity of fully grasping Him affords us the idea of what He really is.  He is presented to our minds in His transcendent greatness, as at once known and unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''Apologeticus'', § 17.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Saint [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] (313-386), in his ''[[Catechesis|Catechetical]] [[Homily|Homilies]]'', states: 
{{quote|For we explain not what God is but candidly confess that we have not exact knowledge concerning Him.

===Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite===
Apophatic theology found its most influential expression in the works of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (late 5th to early 6th century), a student of [[Proclus]] (412-485), combining a Christian worldview with Neo-Platonic ideas.&lt;ref name="Berthold1985_p9"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berthold |first1=George C. |title="Introduction" to Maximus the Confessor.

Dionysius the Areopagite was a pseudonym, taken from [[Acts of the Apostles]] chapter 17, in which [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] gives a [[Areopagus sermon|missionary speech to the court of the Areopagus]] in Athens.{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=12}} In {{bibleref2|Acts|17:23|KJV|verse 23}} Paul makes a reference to an altar-inscription, dedicated to the [[Unknown God]], "a safety measure honoring foreign gods still unknown to the Hellenistic world."{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=12}} For Paul, Jesus Christ is this unknown God, and as a result of Paul's speech Dionysius the Areopagite converts to Christianity.{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=13}} Yet, according to Stang, for Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite Athens is also the place of Neo-Platonic wisdom, and the term "unknown God" is a reversal of Paul's preaching toward an integration of Christianity with Neo-Platonism, and the union with the "unknown God."{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=13}}

According to Corrigan and Harrington, "Dionysius' central concern is how a triune God, ... who is utterly unknowable, unrestricted being, beyond individual substances, beyond even goodness, can become manifest to, in, and through the whole of creation in order to bring back all things to the hidden darkness of their source."{{sfn|Corrigan|Harrington|2014}} Drawing on Neo-Platonism, Pseudo-Dionysius described humans [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|ascend to divinity]] as a process of purgation, illumination and union.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2010|p=439}} Another Neo-Platonic influence was his description of the cosmos as a series of hierarchies, which overcome the distance between God and humans.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2010|p=439}}

{{Main|Eastern Orthodox Church}}

In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] apophatic theology is taught as superior to cataphatic theology. The fourth-century [[Cappadocian Fathers]]{{refn|group=note|[[Basil the Great]] (330–379), who was bishop of [[Caesarea Mazaca|Caesarea]]; Basil's younger brother [[Gregory of Nyssa]] (c.332–395), who was bishop of [[Nyssa (Cappadocia)|Nyssa]]; and a close friend, [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] (329–389), who became [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Commentary on Song of Songs; Letter on the Soul; Letter on Ascesis and the Monastic Life|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4168|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} stated a belief in the existence of God, but an existence unlike that of everything else: everything else that exists was created, but the Creator [[Transcendence (religion)|transcends]] this existence, is uncreated. The [[essence]] of God is completely unknowable; mankind can know God only through His [[Energies of God|energies]].&lt;ref name="McGinn"&gt;{{cite book |last=McGinn |first=Bernard |chapter=4.

[[John of Damascus]] (c.675/676–749) employed negative theology when he wrote that positive statements about God reveal "not the nature, but the things around the nature."

[[Maximus the Confessor]] (580-622) took over Pseudo-Dionysius' ideas, and had a strong influence on the theology and contemplative practices of the Eastern Orthodox Churches.&lt;ref name="Berthold1985_p9"/&gt; [[Gregory Palamas]] (1296–1359) formulated the definite theology of [[Hesychasm]], the Orthodox practices of [[contemplative prayer]] and [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]], "deification."

Influential modern Eastern Orthodox theologians are [[Vladimir Lossky]], [[John Meyendorff]], [[John S. Romanides]] and [[Georges Florovsky]]. Lossky argues, based on his reading of Dionysius and Maximus Confessor, that positive theology is always inferior to negative theology which is a step along the way to the superior knowledge attained by negation.&lt;ref&gt;Lossky, ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'' p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; This is expressed in the idea that [[mysticism]] is the expression of dogmatic theology ''par excellence''.&lt;ref&gt;Lossky, ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'' p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lossky, outside of directly revealed knowledge through [[Scripture]] and [[Sacred Tradition]], such as the Trinitarian nature of God, God in His essence is beyond the limits of what human beings (or even [[angel]]s) can understand. He is [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] in essence (''[[ousia]]''). Further knowledge must be sought in a direct experience of God or His [[Energies of God|indestructible energies]] through ''[[Christian contemplation|theoria]]'' (vision of God).&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Lossky|Lossky, Vladimir]] (1997), ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'', Crestwood, N.Y.: [[SVS Press]], p. 81, {{ISBN|0-913836-31-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lossky (1997), ''The Vision of God'', Crestwood, N.Y.: SVS Press, pp. 36–40, {{ISBN|0-913836-19-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aristotle Papanikolaou, in Eastern Christianity, God is [[Immanence|immanent]] in his [[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]] or existences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle Papanikolaou|Papanikolaou, Aristotle]] (2006), ''Being With God: Trinity, Apophaticism, and Divine–Human Communion'' (1st Edition), Notre Dame, Indiana:[[University of Notre Dame Press]], p. 2, {{ISBN|978-0-268-03830-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Christianity===
Negative theology has a place in the Western Christian tradition as well. The 9th-century theologian [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena|John Scotus Erigena]] wrote: 
{{quote|We do not know what God is. God Himself does not know what He is because He is not anything [i.e., "not any created thing"]. Literally God ''is not'', because He [[transcendence (religion)|transcends]] [[being]].''"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=Eriugena+%22We+do+not+know+what+God+is.+God+Himself+does+not+know+what+He+is+because+He+is+not+anything.+Literally+God+is+not%2C+because+He+transcends+being%22 Quote] on [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}
When he says "''He is not anything''" and "''God is not''", Scotus does not mean that there is no God, but that God cannot be said to exist in the way that creation exists, i.e. that God is uncreated. He is using apophatic language to emphasise that God is "other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Indick|first1=William|title=The Digital God.

Theologians like [[Meister Eckhart]] and [[Saint John of the Cross]] (San Juan de la Cruz) exemplify some aspects of or tendencies towards the apophatic tradition in the West. The medieval work, ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]'' and Saint John's ''[[Dark Night of the Soul]]'' are particularly well known. In 1215 apophatism became the official position of the [[Catholic Church]], which, on the basis of [[Religious text#Christianity|Scripture]] and [[Sacred tradition|church tradition]], during the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|Fourth Lateran Council]] formulated the following [[Dogma in the Catholic Church|dogma]]:

According to Adrian Langdon,
{{quote|The distinction between univocal, equivocal, and analogous language and relations corresponds to the distinction between the ''via positiva'', via ''negativa'', and ''via eminentiae''.

According to ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', the ''Doctor Angelicus'' and the [[Scholasticism|scholastici]] declare [that] 
{{quote|God is not absolutely unknowable, and yet it is true that we cannot define Him adequately. But we can conceive and name Him in an "analogical way". The perfections manifested by creatures are in God, not merely nominally (''equivoce'') but really and positively, since He is their source. Yet, they are not in Him as they are in the creature, with a mere difference of degree, nor even with a mere specific or generic difference (''univoce''), for there is no common concept including the finite and the Infinite. They are really in Him in a supereminent manner (''eminenter'') which is wholly incommensurable with their mode of being in creatures. We can conceive and express these perfections only by an analogy; not by an analogy of proportion, for this analogy rests on a participation in a common concept, and, as already said, there is no element common to the finite and the Infinite; but by an analogy of proportionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic Encyclopedia |last=Sauvage |first=George |year=1907 |inline=1 |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01449a.htm|title=Analogy}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Apophatic statements are still crucial to many modern theologians, restarting in 1800s by [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (see his concept of the [[infinite qualitative distinction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kierkegaard |first=Søren |authorlink=Søren Kierkegaard |title=Training in Christianity, and the Edifying discourse which 'accompanied' it |url=https://books.google.com/?id=T9BXAAAAYAAJ |year=1941 |others=Transl. by [[Walter Lowrie (author)|Walter Lowrie]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=T9BXAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22the+infinite+qualitative+difference+between+God+and+man%22 139 ("the infinite qualitative difference between God and man")]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Law |first=David R. |title=Kierkegaard as Negative Theologian |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5XDZAAAAMAAJ |date=1993 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=Q-y8MgEACAAJ 1989] |edition=illustrated, reprint |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |location=[[Oxford]] |id={{ISBN|0-19826336-8}} | isbn=978-0-198-26336-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;) up to [[Rudolf Otto]] and [[Karl Barth]] (see their idea of "Wholly Other", i.e. ''[[ganz Andere]]'' or ''totaliter aliter''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Webb |first=Stephen H. |authorlink=Stephen H.

[[C. S. Lewis]], in his book ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles]]'' (1947), advocates the use of negative theology when first thinking about God, in order to cleanse our minds of misconceptions. He goes on to say we must then refill our minds with the truth about God, untainted by mythology, bad [[analogies]] or false mind-pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brazier |first=P.

The mid-20th century Dutch philosopher [[Herman Dooyeweerd]], who is often associated with a neo-Calvinistic tradition, provides a philosophical foundation for understanding why we can never absolutely know God, and yet, paradoxically, truly know something of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Friesen|first1=J. Glenn|title=The religious dialectic revisited|url=https://jgfriesen.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/revisited.pdf|website=jgfriesen.files|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dooyeweerd made a sharp distinction between theoretical and pre-theoretical attitudes of thought. Most of the discussion of knowledge of God presupposes theoretical knowledge, in which we reflect and try to define and discuss. Theoretical knowing, by its very nature, is never absolute, always depends on religious presuppositions, and cannot grasp either God or the law side. Pre-theoretical knowing, on the other hand, is intimate engagement, and exhibits a diverse range of aspects. Pre-theoretical intuition, on the other hand, can grasp at least the law side. Knowledge of God, as God wishes to reveal it, is pre-theoretical, immediate and intuitive, never theoretical in nature.&lt;ref name="VanDrunen"&gt;{{cite book |last=VanDrunen |first=David |title=Natural Law and the Two Kingdoms.

[[Ivan Illich]] (1926-2002), the historian and social critic, can be read as an apophatic theologian, according to a longtime collaborator, Lee Hoinacki, in a paper presented in memory of Illich, called "Why Philia?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pudel.uni-bremen.de/pdf/Hoinacki_Clar04_Philia_philia_en.pdf Hoinacki, Lee].&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
According to [[Deirdre Carabine]], negative theology has become a hot topic since the 1990s,{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=i, viii}} resulting from a broad effort in the 19 and 20th century to portray Plato as a mysticist, which revived the interest in Neoplatonism and negative theology.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=i-ii}}

[[Karen Armstrong]], in her book ''[[The Case for God]]'' (2009), notices a recovery of apophatic theology in [[postmodern theology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Blackburn |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Blackburn |title=All quiet on the God front|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jul/04/case-for-god-karen-armstrong |date=4 July 2009 |accessdate=7 April 2017 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|Guardian News and Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different traditions/doctrine schools in [[Islam]] called [[Kalam]] schools (see [[Islamic schools and branches]]) use different theological approaches or ''nizaam al lahoot'' in approaching [[God in Islam]] (''[[Allah]]'', Arabic الله) or the [[ultimate reality]]. The ''lahoot salbi'' or "negative theology" involves the use of ''ta'til'', which means "negation,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bosworth |first1=C.E. |last2=van Donzel |first2=E. |last3=Heinrichs |first3=W.P. |last4=Lecomte |first4=G. |last5=Bearman|first5=P.J.|last6=Bianquis|first6=Th.|title=Encyclopaedia of Islam (New Edition) |volume=Volume X (T-U) |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden, Netherlands|date=2000 |isbn=9004112111 |page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the followers of the [[Mu'tazili]] school of [[Kalam]], founded by Imam [[Wasil ibn Ata]], are often called the ''Mu'attili'', because they are frequent users of the ''[[ta'tili]]'' methodology.&lt;ref name="A Dictionary of Islam"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=Thomas Patrick|title=A Dictionary of Islam|date=1994|publisher=Kazi Publications|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0935782707|page=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rajab Ali Tabrizi|Rajab ʿAlī Tabrīzī]], an Iranian and Shiat philosopher and mystic of the 17th century. instilled a radical apophatic theology in a generation of philosophers and theologians whose influence extended into the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar period]].&lt;ref name="mohammedrustom.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Faruque|first1=Muhammad U.  and Mohammed Rustom|title=Rajab ʿAlī Tabrīzī’s Refutation of Ṣadrian Metaphysics|url=http://www.mohammedrustom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Rajab-Ali-Tabrizis-Refutation-of-Sadrian-Metaphysics-Final-Faruque-and-Rustom.pdf|website=mohammedrustom.com|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mulla Rajab affirmed the completely unknowable,

[[File:Maimonides-2.jpg|thumb|left|Maimonides]]

[[Maimonides]] (1135/1138-1204) was "the most influential medieval Jewish exponent of the ''via negativa''."{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=4}} Maimonides, but also [[Samuel ibn Tibbon]], draw on [[Bahya ibn Paquda]],{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} who shows that our inability to describe God is related to the fact of His [[Jewish principles of faith#God is One|absolute unity]]. God, as the entity which is "truly One" (האחד האמת), must be free of properties and is thus unlike anything else and [[Divine simplicity|indescribable]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} According to Rabbi Yosef Wineberg, Maimonides stated that "[God] is knowledge," and saw His Essence, Being and knowledge as completely one, "a perfect unity and not a composite at all."&lt;ref name="Wineberg"/&gt; Wineberg quotes Maimonides as stating
{{quote|This [form of unity] wherein G‑d’s knowledge and so on is one with G‑d Himself is beyond the capacity of the mouth to express, beyond the capacity of the ear to hear, and beyond the capacity of the heart of man to apprehend clearly.&lt;ref name="Wineberg"&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=7994 ''Shaar Hayichud Vehaemunah Ch. 8]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' Maimonides stated:
{{quote|God's existence is absolute and it includes no composition and we comprehend only the fact that He exists, not His essence. Consequently it is a false assumption to hold that He has any positive [[Abstraction|attribute]] [...] still less has He accidents (מקרה), which could be described by an attribute. Hence it is clear that He has no positive attribute however, the negative attributes are necessary to direct the mind to the truths which we must believe [...] When we say of this being, that it exists, we mean that its non-existence is impossible; it is living &amp;mdash; it is not dead; [...] it is the first &amp;mdash; its existence is not due to any cause; it has power, wisdom, and will &amp;mdash; it is not feeble or ignorant; [[Jewish principles of faith#God is One|He is One]] &amp;mdash; there are not more Gods than one [...] Every attribute predicated of God denotes either the quality of an action, or, when the attribute is intended to convey some idea of the Divine Being itself &amp;mdash; and not of His actions &amp;mdash; the [[negation]] of the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'', [http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp.htm 1:58]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Fagenblat, it is only in the modern period that negative theology really gains importance in Jewish thought.{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=4}} [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]] (1903-1994) was a prominent modern exponent of Jewish negative theology.{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=2}} According to Leibowitz, a person's faith is his commitment to obey God, meaning God's commandments, and this has nothing to do with a person’s image of God. This must be so because Leibowitz thought that God cannot be described, that God's understanding is not man's understanding, and thus all the questions asked of God are out of place.&lt;ref&gt;Zev Golan, "God, Man and Nietzsche: A Startling Dialogue between Judaism and Modern Philosophers" (New York: iUniverse, 2008), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian parallels==
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|thumb|Shankara]]
There are interesting parallels in Indian thought, which developed largely separate from Western thought. Early [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophical]] works which have apophatic themes include the [[Mukhya Upanishads|Principal Upanishads]] (800 BCE to the start of common era) and the [[Brahma Sutras]] (from 450 BCE and 200 CE). An expression of negative theology is found in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], where Brahman is described as "[[neti neti]]" or "neither this, nor that".&lt;ref&gt;Tharaud, Barry. Emerson for the Twenty-First Century: Global Perspectives on an American Icon. Rosemont Publishing and Printing Corp, 2010. p. 453. {{ISBN|978-0-87413-091-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further use of apophatic theology is found in the Brahma Sutras, which state:{{Quote|Whenever we deny something unreal, it is in reference to something real.&lt;ref&gt;Verse III.2.22, Brahma-Sutra, Translated by Swami Gambhirananda.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Buddhist philosophy]] has also strongly advocated the way of negation, beginning with the Buddha's own theory of [[anatta]] (not-[[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]], not-self) which denies any truly existent and unchanging essence of a person. [[Madhyamaka]] is a Buddhist philosophical school founded by [[Nagarjuna]] (2nd-3rd century CE), which is based on a fourfold negation of all assertions and concepts and promotes the theory of emptiness ([[Śūnyatā|shunyata]]). Apophatic assertions are also an important feature of Mahayana sutras, especially the [[Prajnaparamita|prajñaparamita]] genre. These currents of negative theology are visible in all forms of Buddhism.

Apophatic movements in medieval [[Hindu philosophy]] are visible in the works of [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] (8th century), a philosopher of [[Advaita Vedanta]] (non-dualism), and [[Bhartṛhari]] (5th century), a grammarian. While Shankara holds that the transcendent noumenon, [[Brahman]], is realized by the means of negation of every phenomenon including language, Bhartṛhari theorizes that language has both phenomenal and noumenal dimensions, the latter of which manifests Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Coward|Coward, Harold G.]] and Foshay, Toby. Derrida and Negative Theology. State University of New York, 1992. P. 21. {{ISBN|0-7914-0964-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Advaita, Brahman is defined as being [[Nirguna]] or without qualities. Anything imaginable or conceivable is not deemed to be the ultimate reality.&lt;ref&gt;Renard, John.  Responses to One Hundred One Questions on Hinduism. Paulist Press, 1999. P. 75. {{ISBN|0-8091-3845-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taittiriya]] hymn speaks of Brahman as "one where the mind does not reach". Yet the Hindu scriptures often speak of Brahman's positive aspect. For instance, Brahman is often equated with bliss. These contradictory descriptions of Brahman are used to show that the attributes of Brahman are similar to ones experienced by mortals, but not the same. 

Negative theology also figures in the [[Buddhist]] and Hindu [[polemics]]. The arguments go something like this – Is Brahman an object of experience? If so, how do you convey this experience to others who have not had a similar experience? The only way possible is to relate this unique experience to common experiences while explicitly negating their sameness.

==Apophatic theology and atheism==
Even though the ''via negativa'' essentially rejects theological understanding in and of itself as a path to God, some have sought to make it into an intellectual exercise, by describing God only in terms of what God is not. One problem noted with this approach is that there seems to be no fixed basis on deciding what God is not, unless the Divine is understood as an abstract experience of full aliveness unique to each individual consciousness, and universally, the perfect goodness applicable to the whole field of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pondé|first1=Luiz Felipe|title=Crítica e profecia: a filosofia da religião em Dostoiévski |date=2003 |publisher=Editora 34 |location=São Paulo|pages=74–92|isbn=8573262842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apophatic theology is often accused of being a version of [[atheism]] or [[agnosticism]], since it cannot say truly that God exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Kvanvig |editor-first=Jonathan |editor-link=Jonathan Kvanvig |year=2015 |chapter=7.

"Negative theology is a complement to, not the enemy of, positive theology".{{sfn|Bryson|2016|p=114}} Since religious experience—or consciousness of the holy or sacred, is not reducible to other kinds of human experience, an abstract understanding of religious experience cannot be used as evidence or proof that religious discourse or praxis can have no meaning or value.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lonergan|Lonergan, Bernard]] (1972), "Method in Theology", New York, N.Y.: Seabury Press, {{ISBN|0-8164-2204-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In apophatic theology, the negation of theisms in the ''via negativa'' also requires the negation of their correlative atheisms if the dialectical method it employs is to maintain integrity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6181">'''"Bulk personal datasets"''' is the UK government's [[euphemism]] for datasets containing [[personally identifiable information]] on a large number of individuals, as part of [[mass surveillance in the United Kingdom]] and on citizens around the world.

The term was first used publicly in March 2015 by the [[Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament]], and is subject to significant controversy.

Other [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]] departments have programmes utilising bulk personal datasets, one of which is the [[care.data]] programme in the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] and [[National Health Service]]. In [[health]], bulk personal datasets are created as a by-product of providing [[direct care]].

== Controversy ==
The judicial body which oversees the intelligence services in the United Kingdom, the [[Investigatory Powers Tribunal]], ruled that the legislative framework in the United Kingdom does not permit mass surveillance and that while GCHQ collects and analyses data in bulk, it does not practice mass surveillance.&lt;ref name="BBC141206"&gt;{{cite news |title=GCHQ does not breach human rights, judges rule |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30345801 |accessdate=6 December 2014 |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=5 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GCHQ20141205"&gt;{{cite web |title=IPT rejects assertions of mass surveillance |url=http://www.gchq.gov.uk/press_and_media/news_and_features/Pages/IPT-rejects-assertions-of-mass-surveillance.aspx |publisher=[[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]] |accessdate=7 February 2015 |date=5 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206232713/http://www.gchq.gov.uk/press_and_media/news_and_features/Pages/IPT-rejects-assertions-of-mass-surveillance.aspx |archivedate=6 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IPTList"&gt;{{cite web |title=List of judgments |url=http://www.ipt-uk.com/section.aspx?pageid=8 |publisher=Investigatory Powers Tribunal |accessdate=7 February 2015 |date=5 December 2014 |quote=Quote: # A declaration that the regime governing the soliciting, receiving, storing and transmitting by UK authorities of private communications of individuals located in the UK which have been obtained by US authorities pursuant to [[PRISM (surveillance program)|Prism]] and/or [[UPSTREAM|Upstream]] does not contravene Articles 8 or 10 [[European Convention on Human Rights|ECHR]]. # A declaration that the regime in respect of interception under ss8(4), 15 and 16 of the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]] does not contravene Articles 8 or 10 ECHR and does not give rise to unlawful discrimination contrary to Article 14, read together with Articles 8 and/or 10 of the ECHR. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206211011/http://www.ipt-uk.com/section.aspx?pageid=8 |archivedate=6 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A special report published by the [[Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament]] also came to this view, although it found past shortcomings in oversight and said the legal framework should be simplified to improve transparency.&lt;ref name="BBC20150314"&gt;{{cite web |title=UK surveillance 'lacks transparency', ISC report says |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31845338 |work=[[BBC News Online]] |accessdate=14 March 2015 |date=12 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISC2015March"&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy and Security: A modern and transparent legal framework |url=http://isc.independent.gov.uk/news-archive/12march2015 |publisher=[[Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament]] |accessdate=14 March 2015 |date=12 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian20150314"&gt;{{cite news |title=Intelligence and security committee report: the key findings |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/12/intelligence-security-committee-report-key-findings |accessdate=14 March 2015 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=12 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Celia Amorós Puente''' (born 1 January 1944 in [[Valencia]]) is a Spanish philosopher, essayist and supporter of [[Feminism|feminist]] theory. She is a key figure in the so-called [[equality feminism]] and focused an important part of her research in the building of relations between [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[feminism]]. Her book ''Hacia una crítica de la razón patriarcal'' constitutes a new outlook on the gender perspective ([[gender studies]]) of philosophy, revealing the biases of [[androcentrism]] and claims a critical review on behalf of women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.uned.es/dpto_fim/profesores/Celia/celia_perfil.htm|title=UNED – DEPARTAMENTO DE FILOSOFÍA Y FILOSOFÍA MORAL Y POLÍTICA|website=www2.uned.es|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is a professor and member of the Department of Philosophy and Moral and Political Philosophy at the National University of Distance Education, known in Spanish as [[National University of Distance Education|UNED]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her main research interests are the processes of Enlightenment and its implications for feminism and women in [[Islam]], [[Human rights]] and women's rights in the context of [[multiculturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.instifem.org/Personal.aspx |title=Instituto de Investigaciones Feministas &gt; Personal |date=7 October 2013 |access-date=2016-05-10 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007161204/http://www.instifem.org/Personal.aspx |archivedate=7 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 she became the first woman to win the National Essay Prize.

== Biography ==
Amorós graduated with a degree in Philosophy from the [[University of Valencia]] in 1969 and received the Extraordinary Degree Award in 1970.

[[File:Clive Bell.jpg|thumb|200px|Portrait of Clive Bell by [[Roger Fry]] (1924 c.)]]

'''Arthur Clive Heward Bell''' (16 September 1881 – 17 September 1964&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/abstract/10.1093/acref/9780199754694.001.0001/acref-9780199754694-e-179|title=Bell, Arthur Clive Heward - Oxford Reference|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199754694.001.0001/acref-9780199754694-e-179|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an English [[art critic]], associated with [[Formalism (art)|formalism]] and the [[Bloomsbury Group]].

==Biography==
===Origins===
Bell was born in [[Great Shefford|East Shefford]], Berkshire, in 1881, the third of four children of William Heward Bell (1849–1927) and Hannah Taylor Cory (1850–1942). He had an elder brother ([[William Cory Heward Bell|Cory]]), an elder sister (Lorna, Mrs Acton), and a younger sister (Dorothy, Mrs Hony). His father was a civil engineer who built his fortune in the family coal mines in [[Wiltshire]] in England and [[Merthyr Tydfil]] in Wales – "a family which drew its wealth from Welsh mines and expended it on the destruction of wild animals".&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Quentin ''Bloomsbury'', London: Futura 1974, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; They lived at Cleeve House, [[Seend]], near [[Devizes]], Wiltshire, which was adorned with Squire Bell's many hunting trophies.

===Marriage and other liaisons===
He was educated at the [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] [[Marlborough College]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=BL899AC|name=Bell &lt;nowiki&gt;[post Clive-Bell]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Arthur Clive Heward}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he studied history. In 1902 he received an Earl of Derby scholarship to study in Paris, where his interest in art originated. Upon his return to England, he moved to London, where he met and married artist [[Vanessa Bell|Vanessa Stephen]], sister of [[Virginia Woolf]], early in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070427090745/http://www.infobritain.co.uk/Virginia_Woolf_Biography_And_Visits.htm Virginia Woolf biography and visits], infobritain.co.uk; accessed 2 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yomCB&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=Myg8XQLso2%2FEgA9%2FcYHFzA&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry: Bell Arthur Clive H.| accessdate=24 May 2016|work=Transcription of English and Welsh marriage registrations 1837–1983|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yomVS&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=fuHZxw%2F0iO%2BQ1Jtk%2BoF00A&amp;scan=1| title=Index entry: Stephen Vanessa| accessdate=24 May 2016|work=Transcription of English and Welsh marriage registrations 1837–1983| publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clive and Vanessa had two sons, [[Julian Bell|Julian]] and [[Quentin Bell|Quentin]], who both became writers. Julian joined the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] side in the [[Spanish Civil War]] as an ambulance driver and was killed in 1937 by an enemy shell, aged 29.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Hermione ''Virginia Woolf'', London: Vintage 1997 p. 697&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[World War I]] their marriage was over. Vanessa had begun a lifelong relationship with [[Duncan Grant]], and Clive had a number of liaisons with other women including Mary Hutchinson. However, Clive and Vanessa never officially separated or divorced. Not only did they visit each other regularly, they also sometimes spent holidays together and paid "family" visits to Clive's parents. Clive lived in London but often spent long stretches of time at the farmhouse of [[Charleston, Sussex]], where Vanessa lived with Duncan and her three children by Clive and Duncan. He fully supported her wish to have a child by Duncan and allowed his wife's only daughter, Angelica, to bear his surname.

Vanessa's daughter by Duncan, [[Angelica Garnett]] (née Bell), was raised as Clive's daughter until she married. She was informed, by her mother Vanessa, just prior to her marriage and shortly after her brother Julian's death, that Duncan Grant was her biological father.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Hermione ''Virginia Woolf'', London: Vintage 1997 p. 698. This deception forms the central message of her memoir, ''Deceived with Kindness'' (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;
   
According to historian Stanley Rosenbaum, "Bell may, indeed, be the least liked member of Bloomsbury... Bell has been found wanting by biographers and critics of the Group – as a husband, a father, and especially a brother-in-law. It is undeniable that he was a wealthy snob, hedonist, and womaniser, a racist and an anti-Semite (but not a homophobe), who changed from a liberal socialist and pacifist into a reactionary appeaser. Bell's reputation has led to his being underestimated in the history of Bloomsbury...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.P. Rosenbaum|title=Georgian Bloomsbury: Volume 3: The Early Literary History of the Bloomsbury Group, 1910–1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pyl9DAAAQBAJ|year=2003|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=978-0-230-50512-4|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Significant form===
Soon after Bell met [[Roger Fry]], he developed his art theory called "significant form". The two shared a passion for contemporary French art. Bell's book ''Art'' (1914) was the first publication of his theory, which he describes as "lines and colours combined in a particular way, certain forms, and relations of forms, that stir our aesthetic emotions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HFFAQAAMAAJ|title=Art|last=Bell|first=Clive|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|year=1916|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form can be seen in art created by many members of the Bloomsbury Group, an example being ''Interior at Gordon Square'' by Duncan Grant.

==Political views==
Bell was at one point an adherent of absolute pacifism, and during the [[First World War]] was a [[conscientious objector]], allowed to perform Work of National Importance by assisting on the farm of [[Philip Morrell]] [[Member of parliament|MP]], at Garsington Manor. In his 1938 pamphlet ''War Mongers'', he opposed any attempt by Britain to use military force, arguing "the worst tyranny is better than the best war."&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sellers, ''The Cambridge Companion to Virginia Woolf'' Cambridge University Press, 2010; {{ISBN|0521896940}}, (p. 23).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lj"&gt;Lawrence James, ''Warrior Race: A History of the British at War'', Hachette UK, 2010; {{ISBN|0748125353}} (p. 620).&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1940 Bell was a supporter of the British war effort, calling for a "ceaseless war against Hitler".&lt;ref name="lj"/&gt;

[[File:Drama therapy.jpg|thumb|How drama therapy works in a workshop]]
'''Drama therapy''' (written ''dramatherapy'' in the UK, Europe, Australia, and Africa) is the use of theatre techniques to facilitate personal growth and promote [[mental health]].&lt;ref&gt;Loretta Gallo-Lopez, Lawrence C. C. Rubin -Play-Based Interventions for Children and Adolescents on the ...  2012- Page 100 "An overview of drama therapy is provided next, along with support for the use of drama therapy with children with ASd."&lt;/ref&gt; Drama therapy is used in a wide variety of settings, including [[hospital]]s, schools, mental health centers, [[prisons]], and businesses.  Drama therapy, as a modality of the [[creative arts therapies]],&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey A. Kottler and David S. Shepard, ''Introduction to Counseling: Voices from the Field'', 2010, Page 179: "Frequently the use of expressive therapy is not theoretically isolated but occurs as an adjunct to other theoretical modalities."&lt;/ref&gt; exists in many forms and can be applicable to individuals, couples, families, and various groups.&lt;ref name= Malchiodi&gt;Malchiodi, Cathy A. (2003), ''Expressive Therapies'', New York: Guilford, {{ISBN|1-59385-379-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The modern use of dramatic process and theatre as a therapeutic intervention began with Dr. [[Jacob L. Moreno]]'s development of [[Psychodrama]], an action-based form of [[psychoanalysis]]. However, although Moreno's psychodrama preceded the beginning and development of drama therapy by roughly half a century, the field of drama therapy established itself as a distinct modality within the [[creative arts therapies]] and cannot be seen as merely a evolved form of psychodrama. The field of drama therapy has expanded to allow many forms of theatrical interventions as therapy including [[role-play]], [[theatre games]], [[group-dynamic game]]s, [[Mime artist|mime]], [[puppetry]], and other [[Improvisational theatre|improvisational techniques]]. Often, drama therapy is utilized to help a client:
* Solve a problem
* Achieve a [[catharsis]]
* Delve into truths about one's own self
* Understand the meaning of personally resonant images
* Explore and transcend unhealthy personal patterns of behavior and interpersonal interaction

The theoretical foundation of drama therapy lies in drama, theater, psychology, psychotherapy, anthropology, play, as well as interactive and creative processes.
In his book, "Drama as Therapy: Theory, practice and research," Phil Jones describes the emergence of the intentional use of drama as therapy as three-fold. First a long history of drama as a healing force with ancient roots in the  healing rituals and dramas of various societies. The connection between drama and the psychological healing of society, though not of the individual, was first formally acknowledged by Aristotle, who was the originator of the term 'catharsis'. Secondly, in the early twentieth century, hospital theatre and the work of [[Jacob L. Moreno|Moreno]], Evreinov, and Iljine, marked a new attitude towards the relationship between therapy and theatre that provided a foundation for the emergence of drama therapy later in the century. Finally, influenced by experimental approaches to theatre, the advent and popularization of improvisational theater, group dynamics, role playing and psychology in the 1960s, drama therapy emerged as a creative arts therapy in the 1970s.

Today, drama therapy is practiced around the world and there are presently academic training programs in Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Canada, Croatia, Israel and the United States.

== Core processes ==
Phil Jones has written in his book ''Drama as Therapy, Theatre as Living''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Phil|title=Drama as Therapy, Theatre as Living|date=2002|publisher=Brunner-Routledge, an imprint of the Taylor &amp; Francis Group|location=East Sussex, G.B. &amp; New York, U.S.|isbn=0-415-09969-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vsIh1UAVpcEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Drama+as+Therapy,+Theatre+as+Living&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjNn7_Q9PLJAhUE6GMKHVRWAw4Q6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Drama%20as%20Therapy%2C%20Theatre%20as%20Living&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that there are nine core processes at the heart of drama therapy.  These include projective identification and dramatic distancing.  Projective identification is the process whereby a person feels the feelings that the other is unable to access themselves.  Dramatic distancing refers to the way that emotional and psychological problems can be accessed easier through metaphor.  The client has a distanced relationship through metaphor to these problems that makes them easier to tolerate.

== Becoming a drama therapist ==
In the US and Canada, the governing body is the North American Drama Therapy Association (NADTA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nadta.org/|title=North American Drama Therapy Association|website=www.nadta.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which establishes guidelines for the RDT (Registered Drama Therapist) credential and which provides accreditation for MA level programs and guidelines for alternative track training. In North America, Registered Drama Therapists hold a master's degree from one of five institutions accredited by the National Association for Drama Therapy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Accredited Schools|url = http://www.nadta.org/education-and-credentialing/resources-for-students-and-bcts/accredited-schools.html|website = www.nadta.org|accessdate = 2016-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antioch University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = MA Drama Therapy {{!}} Graduate Degree {{!}} MA Counseling {{!}} MA Therapy|url = http://www.antiochseattle.edu/academics/ma-counseling-family-therapy/drama-therapy-ma/|website = Antioch University Seattle|accessdate = 2016-01-01|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Seattle, Washington; [[Lesley University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesley.edu/master-of-arts/expressive-therapies/drama-therapy/mental-health-counseling/|title=Clinical Mental Health Counseling: Drama Therapy Master's Degree- Lesley University|website=www.lesley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Cambridge, Massachusetts; [[NYU Steinhardt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/music/dramatherapy|title=Drama Therapy - NYU Steinhardt|website=steinhardt.nyu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; at New York City, New York; [[California Institute of Integral Studies]] (CIIS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciis.edu/academics/graduate-programs/drama-therapy|title=Drama Therapy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at San Francisco, California and [[Concordia University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.concordia.ca/finearts/creative-arts-therapies/programs/drama-therapy-ma.html|title=Drama Therapy (MA)|website=www.concordia.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  Persons who hold a master's degree in a related field can be registered as a Drama Therapist by pursuing what is known as Alternate Route Training, which consists of graduate coursework and internships performed under the supervision of a board-certified trainer.

In the UK, the governing body is the British Association of Dramatherapists (BADth).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badth.org.uk/|title=badth.org.uk - The British Association of Dramatherapists|website=www.badth.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently five post-graduate training courses in Dramatherapy in the UK that lead to a qualification approved by the [[Health Professions Council]], accredited by the British Association of Dramatherapists, and recognized by the Department of Health. These courses are offered at [[Roehampton University]], [[University of Derby]], [[Central School of Speech and Drama]], [[Anglia Ruskin University]], and The School of Dramatherapy at the Iron Mill Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ironmill.co.uk/cpd-course/introduction-to-dramatherapy?pmsession=d930882207c51627905f8d84604c6942|title=Iron Mill College - Post Qualifying Diploma in Creative Arts Therapies (Advanced Specialist Training Status with NCS)|website=www.ironmill.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, drama therapy is an emerging field. It was first introduced to China in 2013. There heve been a few organizations working on the field recently, such as Apollo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/iZ75XGlqharFgw-26dhnhQ |title=国际认证DvT导师项目 |publisher=Mp.weixin.qq.com |date= |accessdate=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xinyishe &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xinli001.com/site/10665/|title=心艺社 - 心理圈|website=www.xinli001.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc. 
The Hong Kong Association of Drama Therapists was established in 2009. Mr. Eddie Yu (President), Adeline Chan (Vice-president), Dorothy Wong and Kevin Ma are the founding members. Missions are to promote professional development of drama therapists in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkadt.org/hk-drama-therapists/|title=HK Drama Therapists – 香港戲劇治療師協會 HKADT|website=www.hkadt.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these universities suggest specific subjects to complete at degree level if you wish to pursue on to a masters programme in Drama Therapy. Some of these subjects are the following, [[Drama]], [[Psychology]] or another such relevant profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/explore-by-career/allied-health-professions/careers-in-the-allied-health-professions/arts-therapists/dramatherapist/entry-and-training/|title=Entry requirements and training (dramatherapist)|date=30 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NHS.

==In practice==
The field of drama therapy can be somewhat intermittent in terms of techniques and procedures. However, there are some general commonalities. At the center of drama therapy are the elements of role and story. Participants in drama therapy follow roles to tell a story or perform a part, thus embracing a new perspective of the character and themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Landy, R. J., &amp; Montgomery, D. T. (2012). Theatre for Change: Education, Social Action and Therapy. New York, NY: Palgrave Macmillan. Page 165 "Not surprisingly these concepts are derived from theatre. The two most essential are role and story.  In all forms of Drama Therapy, clients take on roles, and while in role they tell and/or enact a story. Role is the indivisible piece, as the dramatic moment begins as an actor slips into the skin of another."&lt;/ref&gt; Another key element is space, or where the acting takes place. Other components of drama therapy include ritual, conflict, resistance, spontaneity, distance and catharsis.

Drama therapy works to shed light on a feelings and behaviors of a person and helps teach them ways to manage and overcome obstacles they struggle with.&lt;ref&gt;Landy, R. J., &amp; Montgomery, D. T. (2012). Theatre for Change: Education, Social Action and Therapy. New York, NY: Palgrave Macmillan. Page 170 "Like applied theatre, drama therapy occurs within community settings and concerns the exploration of social issues and implementation of actions intended to ameliorate distress and oppression.  Although drama therapists most frequently work in groups, they also treat individuals, helping them to identify problematic issues in their lives and to discover effective ways to move through their distress."&lt;/ref&gt; The hope is that by taking on specific roles a person can gain personal insight and break free from barriers.&lt;ref&gt;Landy, R. J., &amp; Montgomery, D. T. (2012). Theatre for Change: Education, Social Action and Therapy. New York, NY: Palgrave Macmillan. Page 191 "Drama therapy is about theatre and as such, it imposes all the theatrical artifice in the service of exploring a fictional reality underneath that of every day life, one that can illuminate and in some instances transform the actor."&lt;/ref&gt; Though this process can be very beneficial and rewarding, it can be very difficult. Progressions and developments can be slow going, and participants may be resistant to the process.&lt;ref&gt;Landy, R. J., &amp; Montgomery, D. T. (2012). Theatre for Change: Education, Social Action and Therapy. New York, NY: Palgrave Macmillan. Page 197 "Much of the actual practice of Drama Therapy is not very dramatic, in the sense of being exciting. Progress can appear to be very slow and resistance very high".&lt;/ref&gt;

Though drama therapy can be done individually, it is typically done in groups or community settings. Groups can involve hundreds of people at a time, but more commonly range from six to ten people in institutional settings. As a form of counseling drama therapy is usually private and doesn't involve spectators. The exception to this rule is therapeutic theatre, which blends the techniques of [[applied theatre|applied drama]] to drama therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Landy, R. J., &amp; Montgomery, D. T. (2012). Theatre for Change: Education, Social Action and Therapy. New York, NY: Palgrave Macmillan. Page 196 "The one exception is Therapeutic Theatre, a more public form of performance where a particular population, for example, psychiatric patients or Iraq war veterans perform for an invited audience".&lt;/ref&gt; Therapeutic theatre entails the performance of a group of people to a selected audience, making it somewhat public.

The '''Eucharistic ''Credo''''' (''credo'', Latin for ''I believe'') is a profession of faith in the [[Real Presence]] of [[Jesus]] in the [[Roman Catholic sacraments|sacramental]] [[Eucharist (Catholic Church)|Eucharistic]] elements written by [[Pope Gregory VII]].

Until the eleventh century, there is no record of a Christian theologian challenging the belief in the Real Presence, that is, the physical, personal reality of Jesus in the Eucharistic elements (the bread and wine believed to become the body and blood of Jesus).

The first known challenge comes from [[Berengarius|Berengarius of Tours]]. Drawing upon the writings of [[Ratramnus]] of the ninth century who considered Jesus ''spiritually present'' in the Eucharist, Berengarius denied that the [[historical Jesus]], born of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] was present in the Eucharistic elements. His teaching on the subject became known throughout Europe by around 1047. His position was condemned subsequently by several regional councils including Rome (1050), Verecelli (1050) where for reasons unclear he was imprisoned briefly by the King, Tours (1055), Rome (1059), Poitiers (1075), and St. Maixeut (1076).

While Berengarius had signed several vague retractions, it was when summoned to Rome by Pope Gregory VII in 1078 that he was given the historically famous ''credo'' to affirm publicly.  This credo has been considered by theologians through the centuries as the first succinct doctrinal definition by the Church on the Eucharist.  It is credited with crystallizing the ancient teachings of the Church on the Eucharist and ushering in the "Eucharistic Renaissance" of the High Middle Ages typified by a flourishing of various Eucharistic [[Catholic devotions|devotions]].

==Text of the Credo==

The text of Gregory VII's Credo was quoted in it entirety in [[Pope Paul VI]]'s encyclical letter, ''[[Mysterium fidei (encyclical)|Mysterium fidei]]'', published in 1965.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe in my heart and openly profess that the bread and wine placed upon the altar are, by the mystery of the sacred prayer and the words of the Redeemer, substantially changed into the true and life-giving flesh and blood of Jesus Christ our Lord, and that after the consecration, there is present the true body of Christ which was born of the Virgin and offered up for the salvation of the world, hung on the cross and now sits at the right hand of the Father, and that there is present the true blood of Christ which flowed from his side. They are present not only by means of a sign and of the efficacy of the Sacrament, but also in the very reality and truth of their nature and substance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Fabien Eboussi Boulaga 1974.jpg|thumb|Eboussi (1974)]]
'''Fabien Eboussi Boulaga''' (17 January 1934, [[Bafia]] – 13 October 2018) was a [[Cameroon]]ian philosopher.&lt;ref name="encylopedia"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=hF_xjFL6_NEC&amp;lpg=PA191&amp;vq=Fabien%20Eboussi%20Boulaga&amp;hl=fr&amp;pg=PA190#v=snippet&amp;q=Fabien%20Eboussi%20Boulaga&amp;f=false|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of African Thought|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in 1934, Eboussi Boulaga earned his high school diploma from the Akono Minor Seminary (South Cameroon), before joining the [[Society of Jesus]] (Jesuits) in 1955.&lt;ref name="encylopedia " /&gt; He was ordained as a priest in 1969, and became an official member of the Society of Jesus in 1973. He became known as a polemical figure, for example in his book ''Bantou problématique'' (1968), and in his theological stance, notably in ''La démission'' (1974), which caused an outcry in ecclesiastical circles; this latter publication called for the organised departure of missionaries. Three years later, he published ''La Crise du Muntu'', which tackled questions of authenticity and tradition, a particularly fashionable topic in the 1970s. In 1980, he decided to leave the Jesuits and asked to return to secular life. Boulaga's departure from sacerdotal and religious life was the product of a carefully matured decision; he claimed to have "lost his faith" since 1969.

The view of the '''Soviet family''' as the basic [[social unit]] in society evolved from revolutionary to conservative; the government of the [[Soviet Union]] first attempted to weaken the [[family]] and then to strengthen it.

According to the 1968 law "Principles of Legislation on Marriage and the Family of the USSR and the Union Republics", parents are "to raise their children in the spirit of the [[Moral Code of the Builder of Communism]], to attend to their physical development and their instruction in and preparation for socially useful activity".

== Bolshevik woman in the Soviet household ==
[[File:Rabotnitsa.jpg|thumb|Soviet women's journal founded in 1914 that featured relatively liberal content]]
The role of the Bolshevik woman has been of much controversy, particularly at the beginning of the post-revolutionary Russian era. Prior to this revolution, the role of the Bolshevik woman was to tend to the household. Making sure the children were brought up in the traditional Soviet way of life was of up most importance in the household of the average Bolshevik. The average woman would prepare a meal that consisted of bread, vegetables and broth; and for wealthier families cheese, and a source of protein. In Bolshevik folklore the mother had the influential role of raising the children in the household; specifically about the household, values and the culture that would be represented among family members. The success and the rise of the Bolshevik regime, and the downfall of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Czar Nicholas II]] and essentially his entire family, would subsequently leave a unique opportunity for the women of Russia. [[Russian Revolution|The Revolutionary War]], and the large number of soldiers necessary to have an adequate defense left a void in the industrial sectors of the workforce, and that void was filled with hundreds of thousands of women, who had to assume the role left absent, by soldier fathers. As a platform Bolshevism advocated for the evolution of traditional gender roles; instead offering opportunities for women inside of the party when the Department for Work Among Women was created in 1919. Despite this strong push for change by the [[Zhenotdel]], the immensely patriarchal society that had existed for hundreds of years prior, would supersede these efforts.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

The feminist movement was seen by the majority peasant and workforce population as bourgeois, and therefore represented something opposite of the Bolshevik idea. The emphasis on the immediate household as priority was pertinent, especially to the 1930s era of Soviet Russia. Since the Paleolithic era of Russia, there has been a fascination with the immortalization, of the mother figure. "The Motherland Calls", statute spoke up about the unrealistic expectations that the Soviet Union had on their female mothers. Motherhood, they posited, was not some divine consciousness, but instead something inherently learned as a result of being a woman. Some argued that the traditional role of the mother should be challenged, and that it was not like it had been in years passed. In many instances the domestic work was piled onto the female head of the house, despite promotion of equality between genders. This left in unequal workload on the woman, who would also have a job outside of the home to help provide in a particularly difficult economy where food and adequate housing was often scarce. However, despite this argument, the role of the Bolshevik woman remained static. [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] himself held both men and women to the same standard, with equal harshness doled out to both sexes. In the final years of his rule, [[Pre-revolutionary Russia|pre-revolution]] ideology persisted, and women were merely thought of as objects necessary for child-bearing. In the 1960s, it was expected of the Russian woman to fall in line with the patriarchal leadership of her husband.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

== Bolshevik vision of the family ==
Marxist theory on family established the revolutionary ideal for the Soviet state and influenced state policy concerning family in varying degrees throughout the history of the country. The principals are: The nuclear family unit is an economic arrangement structured to maintain the ideological functions of Capitalism. The family unit perpetuates class inequality through the transfer of private property through inheritance. Following the abolition of private property, the bourgeois family will cease to exist and the union of individuals will become a “purely private affair”.  
The Soviet state’s first code on marriage and family was written in 1918 and enacted a series of trans-formative laws designed to bring the soviet family closer in line with Marxist theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/794670865|title=The Communist manifesto|last=1818-1883,|first=Marx, Karl,|date=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|others=Engels, Friedrich, 1820-1895,, Isaac, Jeffrey C., 1957-, Lukes, Steven.|isbn=9780300163209|location=New Haven|oclc=794670865}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/27434899|title=Women, the state, and revolution : Soviet family policy and social life, 1917-1936|last=Z.|first=Goldman, Wendy|date=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521458160|location=Cambridge|oclc=27434899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1918 Code on Marriage, the Family and Guardianship ==
One year after the Bolsheviks took power, they ratified the 1918 Code on Marriage, the Family and Guardianship. The revolutionary jurists, led by Alexander Goikhbarg, adhered to the revolutionary principals of Marx, Engles, and Lenin when drafting the codes. Goikhbarg considered the nuclear family unit to be a necessary but transitive social arrangement that would quickly be phased out by the growing communal resources of the state and would eventually “wither away”. The jurists intended for the code to provide a temporary legal framework to maintain protections for women and children until a system of total communal support could be established.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 1918 code also served to recognize the legal rights of the individual at the expense of the existing tsarist/patriarchal system of family and marriage. This was accomplished by allowing easily obtainable “no-grounds” divorces. It abolished “illegitimacy” of birth as a legal concept and entitled all children to parental support. It abolished the adoption of orphans ( Orphans would be cared for by the state to avoid exploitation). A married couple could take either surname. Individual property would be retained in the event of divorce. An unlimited term of alimony could be awarded to either spouse, but upon separation each party was expected to care for themselves. Women were to be recognized as equal under the law; Prior to 1914, women were not allowed to earn a wage, seek education, or exchange property without the consent of her husband.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quigley|first=John|date=1979-01-01|title=The 1926 Soviet Family Code: Retreat from Free Love|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/187633279x00103|journal=The Soviet and Post-Soviet Review|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=166–174|doi=10.1163/187633279x00103|issn=1876-3324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family Code of 1926 ==
The 1918 code accomplished many of the goals that the jurists had sought to set into motion, but the social disruption left in the wake of World War I exposed the inadequacies of the code to alleviate social problems. The 1926 code would revive a more conservative definition of the family in a legal sense. “The 1918 code had been motivated by a desire to lead society forward to new social relationships in line with socialist thought on marriage and family, the 1926 code attempted to solve immediate problems, in particular to ensure the financial well-being”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The hotly debated social concerns included: the unmanageable number of orphans, the unemployment of women, the lack of protection after divorce, common property and divorce, and the obligations of unmarried, cohabitating partners.

In 1921 alone, seven million orphans were displaced, roaming town and countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldman|first=Wendy|date=1984-11-01|title=FREEDOM AND ITS CONSEQUENCES: THE DEBATE ON THE SOVIET FAMILY CODE OF 1926|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/18763316-i0000023|journal=Russian History|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=362–388|doi=10.1163/18763316-i0000023|issn=1876-3316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government agencies simply did not have the resources to care for the children. An adopted child could be cared for by a family at virtually no cost to the state. The 1926 code would reinstate adoption as a solution for child homelessness.

In 1921 [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP), brought about a limited restoration of private enterprise and free markets. It also brought and end to labor conscription. The result was a spike in female unemployment as “[[War communism|War Communism]]” came to and end and [[New Economic Policy|NEP]] emerged.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/3559925|title=Women in Russia|date=1977|publisher=Stanford University Press|others=Atkinson, Dorothy, 1929-2016., Dallin, Alexander, 1924-2000., Lapidus, Gail Warshofsky.|isbn=0804709106|location=Stanford, Calif.|oclc=3559925}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of thousands of unemployed women did not have registered marriages and were left with no means of support or protections following a divorce under the 1918 code. The 1926 code would make unregistered marriages legal in order to safeguard women by extending alimony to unregistered'', de facto'' wives. The purpose being that more women would be cared for in times of widespread unemployment.

Under the 1918 code, there was no division of property in the event of a divorce. Marriage was not be an economic partnership and each party was entitled to individual property. This meant that women who ran the household and cared for the children would not be entitled to any material share of what the “provider” had brought to the marriage. In another conservative move, the 1926 code would require an equal division of property acquired during a marriage. All property acquired during the course of a marriage would become “common”.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; With intentions similar to the legal recognition of ''de facto'' marriages, this new property law was a response to the lack of protections offered to women in the event of divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4040532|title=Women in Soviet society : equality, development, and social change|last=Warshofsky.|first=Lapidus, Gail|date=1978|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520028686|location=Berkeley|oclc=4040532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally the code would do away with the 1918 concept of “collective paternity” where multiple men could be assigned to pay alimony if the father of a child could not be determined. According to the 1926 code, paternity could be assigned by a judge. It also enlarged family obligations by expanding alimony obligations to include children, parents, siblings and grandparents. Alimony would also have set time limits.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The 1926 code would signal a retreat from many policies that served to weaken the family in 1918. The jurists were not pursuing an ideological maneuver away from socialism, rather than taking more “temporary” measures to ensure the well-being of women and children since communal care had yet to materialize.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Family Code of 1936 ==
Unlike earlier codes that arranged for temporary and transitive laws as a step toward the revolutionary vision of family; the Code of 1936 marked an ideological shift away from Marxist / revolutionary visions of the nuclear family.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/3071564|title=Cultural revolution in Russia, 1928-1931|date=1978|publisher=Indiana University Press|others=Fitzpatrick, Sheila., American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies. Research and Development Committee., Columbia University. Russian Institute.|isbn=0253315913|location=Bloomington|oclc=3071564}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coinciding with the rise of Stalinism, the law demanded the stabilizing and strengthening of the family. “The “withering-away” doctrine, once central to socialist understand of the family, law, and the state, was anathematized.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 1936 code emerged among along with an eruption of pro-family propaganda.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For the first time, the code outlawed abortion and imposed fines and jail time for any that received or performed the service. The code also enacted a bevy of laws aimed to encourage pregnancy and child birth. Insurance stipends, pregnancy leave, job security, light duty, child care services and payments for large families. In another drastic move, the code made it more difficult to obtain a divorce. Under the code, both parties would need to be present for a divorce and pay a fine. There could be harsh penalties for those who failed to pay alimony and child-support payments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

“Our demands grow day to day. We need fighters, they build this life. We need people.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The wider campaign to encourage the family unit elevated motherhood to a form of [[Stakhanovite movement|Stakhanovite]] labor. During this time, motherhood was celebrated as patriotic and the joys of children and family were extolled by the country’s leaders.

== Family Edict of 1944 ==
The Family Edict of 1944 would be a continuation of the conservative trending of the 1936 code. Citing the heavy manpower losses and social disruption following World War II, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet enacted laws that would further encourage marriage and childbirth.

The 1944 Edict offered greater state-sponsored benefits to mothers, including: Extended maternity leave, increased family allowances even to unmarried mothers, promises of burgeoning child care services, targeted labor protections, and most notably, state recognition and the honorary title “[[Mother Heroine]]” for mothers who could produce large families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.libussr.ru/doc_ussr/ussr_4500.htm|title=Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union of July 8, 1944|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The edict also sought to preserve the family unit by making divorces even more difficult to obtain. Fines were increased and the parties were often ordered to attempt reconciliation. Divorce also became a public matter. Divorcees were required to appear in public court and their intent was published in the local newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Field|first=Deborah A.|date=1998-10-01|title=Irreconcilable Differences: Divorce and Conceptions of Private Life in the Krushchev Era|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/0036-0341.00047|journal=Russian Review|language=en|volume=57|issue=4|pages=599–613|doi=10.1111/0036-0341.00047|issn=1467-9434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution of the Soviet family ==
The early [[Soviet state]] sought to remake the family, believing that although the economic emancipation of workers would deprive families of their economic function, it would not destroy the institution but rather base family relations exclusively on mutual affection. The Bolsheviks replaced religious [[marriage]] with civil marriage, [[divorce]] became easy to obtain, and unwed mothers received special protection. All children, whether legitimate or illegitimate, had equal rights before the law, women gained sexual equality under matrimonial law, inheritance of property was abolished, and [[abortion]] was legalized.&lt;ref name="LOCCSussr"&gt;
Text used in this cited section originally came from: [http://rs6.loc.gov/frd/cs/sutoc.html Soviet Union Country Study] from the [[Library of Congress Country Studies]] project.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1920s, however, the weakening of family ties, combined with the devastation and dislocation caused by the [[Russian Civil War]] (1918–21), resulted in nearly 7 million homeless children. This situation prompted senior Bolshevik Party officials to conclude that the State needed a more stable family life to rebuild the country's economy and shattered social structure. By 1922 the government allowed some forms of inheritance, and after 1926 full inheritance rights were restored. By the late 1920s, adults had been made more responsible for the care of their children, and common-law marriage had been given equal legal status with civil marriage.&lt;ref name="LOCCSussr" /&gt;

[[File:SovietLivingRoom1950s.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of a typical 1950s Soviet [[living room]]]]
During [[Joseph Stalin]]'s rule (late 1920s to 1953), the trend toward strengthening the family continued. In 1936 the government began to award payments to women with large families, banned abortions, and made divorces more difficult to obtain. In 1942 it subjected single persons and childless married persons to additional taxes. In 1944 only registered marriages were recognized to be legal, and divorce became subject to court discretion. In the same year the government began to award medals to women who gave birth to five or more children and took upon itself the support of illegitimate children.&lt;ref name="LOCCSussr" /&gt;

After Stalin's death in 1953, the government moved in a more revisionist direction and rescinded some of its [[natalist]] legislation. In 1955 it declared abortions for medical reasons legal, and in 1968 it declared all abortions legal, following [[Western European]] policy. The state also liberalized divorce procedures in the mid-1960s, but in 1968 introduced new limitations.&lt;ref name="LOCCSussr" /&gt;

In 1974 the government began to subsidize poorer families whose average per-capita income did not exceed 50 [[Soviet ruble|rubles]] per month (later raised to 75 rubles per month in some northern and eastern regions). The subsidy amounted to 12 rubles per month for each child below eight years of age. It was estimated{{by whom?|date=June 2018}} that in 1974 about 3.5 million families (14 million people, or about 5% of the entire population) received this subsidy. With the increase in per-capita income, however, the number of children requiring such assistance decreased. In 1985 the government raised the age limit for assistance to twelve years and under. In 1981 the subsidy to an unwed mother with a child increased to 20 rubles per month; in early 1987 an estimated 1.5 million unwed mothers were receiving such assistance, or twice as many as during the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="LOCCSussr" /&gt;

== Family size ==
[[Family size]] and composition depended mainly on the place of residence—urban or rural—and ethnic group. The size and composition of such families was also influenced by housing and income limitations, pensions, and female employment outside the home. The typical urban family consisted of a married couple, two children, and, in about 20% of the cases, one of the grandmothers, whose assistance in raising the children and in housekeeping was important in the large majority of families having two wage earners. Rural families generally had more children than urban families and often supported three generations under one roof. Families in [[Central Asia]] and the [[Caucasus]] tended to have more children than families elsewhere in the Soviet Union and included grandparents in the family structure. In general, the average family size followed that of other industrialized countries, with higher income families having both fewer children and a lower rate of infant mortality. From the early 1960s to the late 1980s, the number of families with more than one child decreased by about 50% and in 1988 totaled 1.9 million. About 75% of the families with more than one child lived in the southern regions of the country, half of them in Central Asia. In the [[Russia]]n, [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], [[Belorussia]]n, [[Moldavia|Moldovian]], [[Estonia]]n, [[Latvia]]n, and [[Lithuania]]n republics, families with one and two children constituted more than 90% of all families, whereas in Central Asia those with three or more children ranged from 14% in the [[Kyrgyz SSR|Kyrgyz Republic]] to 31% in the [[Tajik SSR|Tajik]]. Surveys suggested that most parents would have had more children if they had had more living space.&lt;ref name="LOCCSussr" /&gt;

Beginning in the mid-1980s, the government promoted [[family planning]] in order to slow the growth of the Central Asian indigenous populations. Local opposition to this policy surfaced especially in the [[Uzbek SSR|Uzbek]] and [[Tajik SSR|Tajik]] republics. In general, however, the government continued publicly to honor mothers of large families. Women received the Motherhood Medal, Second Class, for their fifth live birth and the [[Mother Heroine]] medal for their tenth. Most of these awards went to women in Central Asia and the Caucasus.&lt;ref name="LOCCSussr" /&gt;

== Reproduction and family planning ==
The primary form of contraception practiced in the early USSR was [[coitus interruptus]]. Scarcity of rubber made condoms and diaphragms unavailable, and contraception was rarely discussed by political figures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The U.S.S.R. was the first country in the world to legalize [[abortion]]. For many years prior to the [[October Revolution]], abortion was not uncommon in Russia, although it was illegal and carried a possible sentence of hard labor or exile.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Avdeev, Blum, Troitskaya|first=Alexandre, Alain, Irina|date=1995|title=The History of Abortion Statistics in Russia and the USSR from 1900 to 1991|jstor=2949057|journal=Population: an English Selection|volume=7|pages=39–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the revolution, famine and poor economic conditions led to an increase in the number of “back alley” abortions, and after pressure from doctors and jurists, the Commissariats of Health and Justice legalized abortion in 1920. Abortions were free for all women, although they were seen as a necessary evil due to economic hardship rather than a woman’s right to control her own reproductive system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Everyday Life in Early Soviet Russia: Taking the Revolution Inside|last=Kiaer, Naiman|first=Christina, Eric|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=601 North Morton Street, Bloomington, IN, USA|pages=61–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the 1930s, a rising number of abortions coupled with a falling birthrate alarmed Soviet officials, with a recorded 400,000 abortions taking place in 1926 alone.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In 1936 the Soviet Central Executive Committee made abortion illegal once again. This, along with stipends granted to recent mothers and bonuses given for women who bore many children, was part of an effort to combat the falling birthrate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Family and kinship structures ==
The extended family was more prevalent in Central Asia and the Caucasus than in the other sections of the country and, generally, in rural areas more than in urban areas. Deference to parental wishes regarding marriage was particularly strong in these areas, even among the Russians residing there.&lt;ref name="LOCCSussr" /&gt;

Extended families helped perpetuate traditional life-styles. The patriarchal values that accompany this life-style affected such issues as contraception, the distribution of family power, and the roles of individuals in marriage and the family. For example, traditional Uzbeks placed a higher value on their responsibilities as parents than on their own happiness as spouses and individuals. The younger and better educated Uzbeks and working women, however, were more likely to behave and think like their counterparts in the European areas of the Soviet Union, who tended to emphasize individual careers.&lt;ref name="LOCCSussr" /&gt;

Extended families were not prevalent in the cities. Couples lived with parents during the first years of marriage only because of economics or the housing shortage. When children were born, the couple usually acquired a separate apartment.&lt;ref name="LOCCSussr"/&gt;

== Function of the family ==
[[File:Kharkov 1981 Kassy kinoteatra Ukraina.jpg|thumb|Soviet people of mixed ages [[queue area|queuing]] to a [[Kharkov]] cinema,1981]]
The government assumed many functions of the pre-Soviet family. Various public institutions, for example, took responsibility for supporting individuals during times of sickness, incapacity, old age, maternity, and industrial injury. State-run nurseries, preschools, schools, clubs, and youth organizations took over a great part of the family's role in socializing children. Their role in socialization was limited, however, because preschools had places for only half of all Soviet children under seven. Despite government assumption of many responsibilities, spouses were still responsible for the material support of each other, minor children, and disabled adult children.&lt;ref name="LOCCSussr"/&gt;

The transformation of the patriarchal, three-generation rural household to a modern, urban family of two adults and two children attests to the great changes that Soviet society had undergone since 1917. That transformation did not produce the originally envisioned egalitarianism, but it has forever changed the nature of what was once the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name="LOCCSussr" /&gt;

== Diet and nutrition of the Soviet family ==
The history of the Soviet Union diet prior to World War II encompasses different periods that have varying influences on food production and availability. Periods of low crop yields, and restrictive distribution of food in the early 1920s, and again in the early 1930s brought about great famine and suffrage in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dando|first1=William|title=Harvard Ukrainian Studies|journal=Harvard Ukrainian Studies|date=1994|volume=18|issue=3-4|pages=396–397|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farming was one of the main efforts for food production, and was at the center of development in support of Soviet communism. When crops failed or suffered from low yields, Soviet peasants suffered greatly from malnutrition.
The traditional types of food found in the Soviet Union were made up of various grains for breads and pastries, dairy products such as cheese and yogurt, and various meats such as pork, fish, beef and chicken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Romero|first1=Gwynn|title=Dietary Practices of Refugees from the Former Soviet Union|journal=Nutrition Today|date=1997|volume=32|issue=4|pages=2–3|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetables were less abundant than the other forms of food due to the strain on resources and poor crop yields. Potatoes were a very important staple for Soviet families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zubkova|first1=Elena|title=The Soviet Regime and Soviet Society In the Post War Years: Innovations and Conservatism 1945-1953|website=ASURITE|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potatoes were easily grown and harvested in many different environments, and were usually reliable as a food source. Malnutrition was a prominent factor in poor health conditions and individual growth during this period in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brainerd|first1=Elizabeth|title=Reassessing the Standard of Living in the Soviet Union|journal=The Journal of Economic History|date=2010|volume=70|issue=1|pages=83–117|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Much like the Western tradition of three main meals a day, the Soviet meals consisted of breakfast (Zavtrak), lunch (Obed), and dinner (Ouzin). Soups and broths made of meats and vegetables when available, were common meals for the Soviet peasant Family.

==Apocrypha==
* [[My Sister and I (Nietzsche)|My Sister and I]], allegedly translated by [[Oscar Levy]], considered by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] and [[Denis Dutton]] to be a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://denisdutton.com/nietzsche_review.htm|title=Nietzsche Dreams of Detroit|author=[[Denis Dutton]]|journal=Philosophy and Literature|issue=16|pages=244–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other==
''[[Thoughts Out of Season]]'', Part 1 is edited by Oscar Levy and translated by Anthony M. Ludovici.  It was published in 1909 by [[T. N. Foulis]] 13 &amp; 15 Frederick St., Edinburgh and London.  It is available on the WWW at [http://www.ibiblio.org/HTMLTexts/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Nietzsche/Thoughts_Out_Of_Season_Part_One/ Thoughts Out of Season Part One].  It contains [[David Strauss, the Confessor and the Writer]] and [[Richard Wagner in Bayreuth]].

[[C.G. Jung]] cites this as his first introduction to Nietzsche in his autobiography ''[[Memories, Dreams, Reflections]]'' (1989, page 102), and claims to have been 'carried away by its enthusiasm'.

'''GNU Mach''' is an implementation of the [[Mach (kernel)|Mach microkernel]]. It is the default [[Microkernel#Microkernels|microkernel]] in the [[GNU Hurd]]. GNU Mach runs on [[IA-32]] machines. GNU Mach is maintained by developers on the GNU project. It is distributed under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL).

==History==
Early versions of the Hurd were developed on top of [[Carnegie Mellon University|CMU]]'s Mach 3.0.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/history/hurd-announce Initial announcement of the Hurd], mentioning Mach 3.0&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, CMU stopped working on Mach, and the GNU Project switched to the [[University of Utah]]'s Mach 4. The kernel known as "GNU Mach" was derived from Mach 4 once Utah stopped development. The first ChangeLog entry by [[Thomas Bushnell]] (rather than by a Utah researcher) is from 16 December 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{URL|https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/history/hurd-flash6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/1999/08/msg00191.html "Re: Which Mach is GNU Mach?" e-mail from Roland McGrath to Pontus Lidman on the debian-hurd mailing list (25 Aug 1999)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/gnumach.git/log/ A GNU Mach ChangeLog]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Roland McGrath branched the OSKit-Mach branch from GNU Mach 1.2, intending to replace all the device drivers and some of the hardware support with code from OSKit. After the release of GNU Mach 1.3, this branch was intended to become the GNU Mach 2.0 main line; however, as of 2006, OSKit-Mach is not being developed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewcvs/hurd/gnumach/%3Dannounce-oskit-mach-1.2.90?view=markup OSKit-Mach announcement]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1.3-announce"&gt;[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2002-05/msg00778.html GNU Mach 1.3 release announcement]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2006-10/msg00022.html "Re: mach4 &amp; gnumach/oskit..." e-mail by Thomas Schwinge to bug-hurd mailing list (10 Oct 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

GNU Mach 1.4 was released on 27 September 2013, eleven years after 1.3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://article.gmane.org/gmane.os.hurd.bugs/23683 |title=Happy 30th birthday, GNU!

'''''Genjōkōan''''' ('''現成公按'''&lt;ref&gt;The fourth ideograph in this expression, as originally written by Dōgen, is not the same as that in the term ''[[kōan]]'', which is written 公案. For discussion of the possible significance of this difference, see {{cite book|last=Okumura|first=Shohaku|authorlink=Shohaku Okumura|title=Realizing Genjokoan: The Key to Dogen's Shobogenzo|publisher=[[Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition|Wisdom Publications]]|year=2010|page=15 ff|isbn=9780861716012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) sometimes translated as '''''Actualizing the Fundamental Point'''''&lt;ref name="kaz"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tanahashi|first=Kazuaki|authorlink=Kazuaki Tanahashi|title=Moon in a Dewdrop|publisher=North Point Press|year=1995|pages=244–245|isbn=9780865471863}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="three"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weitsman|first1=Mel|last2=Wenger|first2=Michael|last3=Okumura|first3=Shohaku|authorlink1=Mel Weitsman|authorlink2=Michael Wenger|authorlink3=Shohaku Okumura|title=Dogen's Genjo Koan: Three Commentaries|page=1|year=2012|publisher=Counterpoint|isbn=9781582437439}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an influential essay written by [[Dōgen]], the founder of [[Zen Buddhism]]'s [[Sōtō school]] in Japan. It is considered one of the most popular essays in ''[[Shōbōgenzō]]''.&lt;ref name="cleary"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Issue at Hand by Eihei Dogen|url=http://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Dogen_Teachings/GenjoKoan_Cleary.htm|author=[[Thomas Cleary]]|publisher=The Zen Site|accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and background==
Genjōkōan was written for a lay practitioner&lt;ref name="three"/&gt;&lt;ref name="leighton"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Practice of Genjokoan|url=http://www.ancientdragon.org/dharma/dharma_talks/the_practice_of_genjokoan|author=[[Taigen Dan Leighton]]|publisher=Ancient Dragon Zen Gate|accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; named Koshu Yō&lt;ref name="kaz"/&gt; in 1233.

==Title==
According to [[Taigen Dan Leighton]] "The word ''genjo'' means to fully or completely manifest, or to express or share. And in this context ''koan'' does not refer to these teaching stories, but to the heart of the matter."&lt;ref name="leighton"/&gt;

[[Shohaku Okumura]] says that ''Gen'' means "to appear", "to show up," or "to be in the present moment"&lt;ref name="real2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Okumura|first=Shohaku|authorlink=Shohaku Okumura|title=Realizing Genjokoan: The Key to Dogen's Shobogenzo|publisher=[[Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition|Wisdom Publications]]|year=2010|page=13|isbn=9780861716012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Jo'' means "to become," "to complete," or "to accomplish."&lt;ref name="real2"/&gt; The combined word ''genjō'' therefore means "to manifest," "to actualize," or "to appear and become."&lt;ref name="real2"/&gt;

[[Hakuun Yasutani]] wrote: "...[C]oncerning the word ''genjōkoan'', ''genjō'' is phenomena. It's the whole universe. It's all mental and physical phenomena.... ''Kōan'' is derived from the word ''official document'', and is meant to mean the unerring absolute authority of the Buddha-dharma.  So then, ''genjōkōan'' means that the subjective realm and the objective realm, the self and all things in the universe, are nothing but the true Buddha-dharma itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Flowers Fall. A Commentary on Zen Master Dōgen's ''Genjōkōan''| first=Hakuun |last=Yasutani |author-link=Hakuun Yasutani | year=1996| pages=6–7 | publisher=Shambala Publications |location=Boston |isbn=978-1-57062-674-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
''Genjōkōan'' begins with an explanation of Zen and then goes on to elucidate delusion and realization, wholehearted practice, and the relationship of self to realization and environment.&lt;ref name="real3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Okumura|first=Shohaku|authorlink=Shohaku Okumura|title=Realizing Genjokoan: The Key to Dogen's Shobogenzo|publisher=[[Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition|Wisdom Publications]]|year=2010|pages=23–24|isbn=9780861716012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Cleary]] states that ''Genjōkōan'' begins with an outline of Zen using a presentation of the [[Five Ranks]]&lt;ref name="cleary"/&gt; claiming that Dogen used the device throughout his ''Shōbōgenzō''.&lt;ref name="cleary"/&gt; [[Shohaku Okumura]] says that in ''Genjōkōan'' "Dogen created a metaphor to express the reality of individuality and universality."&lt;ref name="real1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Okumura|first=Shohaku|authorlink=Shohaku Okumura|title=Realizing Genjokoan: The Key to Dogen's Shobogenzo|publisher=[[Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition|Wisdom Publications]]|year=2010|page=21|isbn=9780861716012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''George Jackson Brigade''', was a revolutionary group based in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], which was named after [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]], a dissident prisoner and [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] member shot and killed during an alleged escape attempt at [[San Quentin Prison]] in 1971.

The members included two ex-cons: Ed Mead and John Sherman, and prison-rights activists: Bruce Seidel, Rita "Bo" Brown, and Therese Coupez. They were later joined by Mark Cook, who was the only African American in the group.  They were involved in violent acts and claimed to use force to overthrow the [[United States Government]] or the government of the [[State of Washington]]. The group justified their actions by claiming to further the ends of a revolution of the masses to overthrow the present governmental and international business structures and to establish a system of communism. In various communiqués,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vault.fbi.gov/George%20Jackson%20Brigade%20|website=vault.FBI.gov|publisher=FBI.gov|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the group claimed credit for bank robberies, bombings, attacks against custom houses, court houses, Safeway stores, public utilities and correction facilities.

From March 1975 to December 1977, the Seattle Brigade robbed at least seven banks and detonated about 20 pipe bombs—mainly targeting government buildings, electric power facilities, Safeway stores, and companies accused of racism.

On January 23, 1976, the [[Tukwila, Washington|Tukwila]] branch of the Pacific National Bank was robbed by several armed men including Mead, Sherman, Siedel, and Cook.   Mead was captured, Sherman was wounded in the jaw, and Seidel was killed. Cook fled in a car. Six weeks later, Cook freed Sherman after shooting his police escort(King County Sheriff Officer Virgil Johnson) as they walked out of [[Harborview Medical Center]], but Cook was captured the following day. Sherman remained free for two years before his recapture.

== History ==
In 1974 Ed Mead traveled to San Francisco, just a few years after his release from prison for a pharmacy burglary, hoping to connect with the Symbionese Liberation Army&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hauser|first1=S|title=Guerrilla USA: The George Jackson Brigade and the anticapitalist underground of the 1970s|date=2011|publisher=Choice|location=Online|edition=1|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; however when he arrived it was another group he joined with. The group he joined was the New World Liberation Front or NWLF, it was from this group that Ed Mead learned to make pipe bombs. Upon arriving back home in Seattle he met with his friend Bruce Seidel and it was at this meeting that they decided to take up arms for their political beliefs. The two decided to deliver on the former Black Panther lieutenant George Jackson’s promise and thus the name George Jackson Brigade. In the George Jackson Brigade there were a mixture of Communist and Anarchist ideologies. In its operations, it also tried to avoid killing or injuring civilians at all costs.
Mead was released in 1993 after serving 18 years in state and federal institutions. Sherman, who later escaped—again—from a federal prison in California, was released in 1998.  Brown, Coupez, and Janine Bertram, are all free after serving four- to eight-year sentences. Mark Cook remained in prison for 24 years, until 2000. 

Their first attack was the bombing of the department of corrections building in Olympia, Washington. Their second attack was also their first failure as a group, the target was the Safeway on Capitol Hill the group snuck a pipe bomb hidden in a 50-pound bag of dog food and left it in the store. Ed Mead then called the Safeway store and informed them there was a bomb however, he claimed he was blown off as a prank while the Seattle press reported he called the wrong number. Civilians were injured and the George Jackson Brigade received a lot of bad press for the attack. The George Jackson Brigade wanted to redistribute wealth as well as overthrow the government and make the "ruling class" pay for keeping them from being successful. The main goal of the George Jackson Brigade was to replace the Capitalist government with a more humane government. The George Jackson Brigade stated that any revolution that occurs the ruling class would meet with violence so they must be prepared to use violence themselves. After each attack the carried out, successful or unsuccessful they would send a communique explaining why each place had been attacked. They also used these communiques as a way to communicate with authorities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Downfall ==
The downfall of the George Jackson Brigade started in January 23 1976 when they attempted to rob a bank in Tukwila, Washington. Two police officers and one member of the George Jackson Brigade, Bruce Seidel, were killed along with John Sherman and Ed Mead being arrested with John Sherman also being wounded. Then on March 10 of the same year Mark Cook rescued John Sherman from police custody however he shot a police officer in the stomach in the process they both escaped but Cook was captured a few days later and spent the next 25 years in prison. The remaining members retreated to regroup and came back in the Fall of 1977 however in September 1977 Brown was arrested while casing a bank. Then on March 21 of 1978 Sherman, Coupez, and Brown's now new girlfriend Bertram were arrested in a Tacoma restaurant right before executing another robbery. 

According to a report published by the [[National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism]] for the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]'s [[DHS Science and Technology Directorate]], the George Jackson Brigade was ranked fifteenth among terrorist groups that perpetrated the most terrorist attacks in the United States between 1970 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=LaFree |first1=Gary |authorlink1=Gary LaFree |last2=Dugan |first2=Laura |last3=Miller |first3=Erin |date=December 2012 |title=Integrated United States Security Database (IUSSD): Data on the Terrorist Attacks in the United States Homeland, 1970 to 2011; Final Report to the Resilient Systems Division, DHS Science and Technology Directorate, U.S. Department of Homeland Security |url=http://www.start.umd.edu/sites/default/files/files/publications/START_IUSSDDataTerroristAttacksUS_1970-2011.pdf |location=College Park, Maryland |publisher=National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism |page=25 |accessdate=September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Philosophy of science|philosophers]] and [[Sociology of scientific knowledge|sociologists of science]] have questioned the relationship between these characteristics and perceived hardness or softness. The more "developed" hard sciences do not necessarily have a greater degree of [[scientific consensus|consensus]] or selectivity in accepting new results.&lt;ref name="Cole 1983" /&gt; Commonly cited methodological differences are also not a reliable indicator. For example, social sciences such as psychology and sociology use mathematical models extensively, but are usually considered soft sciences.&lt;ref name="Nature 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson 2012" /&gt; However, there are some measurable differences between hard and soft sciences. For example, hard sciences make more [[Graphism thesis|extensive use of graphs]],&lt;ref name="Smith2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Representation in scientific practice|last=Latour|first=B.|publisher=MIT Press|year=1990|editor=M. Lynch|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=19–68|chapter=Drawing things together|editor2=S. Woolgar}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soft sciences are more prone to a rapid turnover of [[buzzwords]].&lt;ref name="Bentley 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bentley|first1=R. A.|year=2008|editor1-last=Allen|editor1-first=Colin|title=Random Drift versus Selection in Academic Vocabulary: An Evolutionary Analysis of Published Keywords|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=3|issue=8|pages=e3057|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0003057|pmc=2518107|pmid=18728786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The metaphor has been criticised for unduly stigmatizing soft sciences, creating an imbalance in the public perception, funding, and recognition of different fields.&lt;ref name="Wilson 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frost nd" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature 2012" /&gt;

==History of the terms==
The origin of the terms "hard science" and "soft science" is obscure. The earliest attested use of "hard science" is found in an 1858 issue of the ''Journal of the Society of Arts'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Journal|last=Winkworth|first=Thos.|date=1858-10-29|title=Journal of the Society of Arts, Vol. 6, no. 310]|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/41323682.pdf|journal=The Journal of the Society of Arts|pages=697-706}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=hard, adj. and n. |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=3rd |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/84122#eid321123043 |date=June 2015 |year= |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |id= |access-date=2018-08-10}}
&lt;/ref&gt; but the idea of a [[hierarchy of the sciences]] can be found earlier, in the work of the French philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] (1798‒1857). He identified astronomy as the most general science,&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Comte viewed astronomy as studying the physics of the entire cosmos, calling it “celestial physics.” He classified the rest of physics (under the modern definition) as “terrestrial physics,” which was therefore less general.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by physics, chemistry, biology, then sociology. This view was highly influential, and was intended to classify fields based on their degree of intellectual development and the complexity of their subject matter.&lt;ref name="Cole 1983" /&gt;

The modern distinction between hard and soft science is often attributed to an 1964 article published in [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] by [[John R. Platt]]. He explored why he considered some scientific fields to be more productive than others, though he did not actually use the terms themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Platt|first=J. R.|date=1964-10-16|title=Strong Inference: Certain systematic methods of scientific thinking may produce much more rapid progress than others|journal=Science|volume=146|issue=3642|pages=347–353|doi=10.1126/science.146.3642.347|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17739513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=VanLandingham|first=Mark|date=2014|title=On the Hard and Soft Sciences in Public Health|journal=Public Health Reports|volume=129|issue=2|pages=124–126|issn=0033-3549|pmc=3904890|pmid=24587545}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, sociologist of science [[Norman W. Storer]] specifically distinguished between the natural sciences as hard and the social sciences as soft. He defined hardness in terms of the degree to which a field uses mathematics and described a trend of scientific fields increasing in hardness over time, identifying features of increased hardness as including better integration and organization of knowledge, an improved ability to detect errors, and an increase in the difficulty of learning the subject.&lt;ref name="Cole 1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Storer1967"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Storer NW| title=The hard sciences and the soft: some sociological observations. | journal=Bull Med Libr Assoc | year= 1967 | volume= 55 | issue= 1 | pages= 75–84 | doi= | pmc=198502 | pmid= 6016373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empirical support==

Sociologist [[Stephen Cole (sociologist)|Stephen Cole]] conducted a number of empirical studies attempting to find evidence for a hierarchy of scientific disciplines, and was unable to find significant differences in terms of core of knowledge, degree of codification, or research material. Differences that he did find evidence for included a tendency for textbooks in soft sciences to rely on more recent work, while the material in textbooks from the hard sciences was more consistent over time.&lt;ref name="Cole 1983"/&gt; However, it has been suggested that Cole might have missed some relationships in the data because he studied individual measurements, without accounting for the way multiple measurements could trend in the same direction, and because not all the criteria that could indicate a discipline’s scientific status were analysed.&lt;ref name="Simonton 2004"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Simonton DK| title=Psychology’s Status as a Scientific Discipline: Its Empirical Placement Within an Implicit Hierarchy of the Sciences. | journal=Review of General Psychology | year= 2004 | volume= 8 | issue= 1 | pages= 59–67 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.8.1.59| url= http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/gpr/8/1/59.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleveland 1984 performed a survey of 57 journals and found that natural science journals used many more graphs than journals in mathematics or social science, and that social science journals often presented large amounts of observational data in the absence of graphs. The amount of page area used for graphs ranged from 0% to 31%, and the variation was primarily due to the number of graphs included rather than their sizes.&lt;ref name="Cleveland1984"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Cleveland WS| title=Graphs in Scientific Publications | journal=The American Statistician| year= 1984 | volume= 38 | issue= 4 | pages= 261–269 | doi=10.2307/2683400 | jstor= 2683400}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further analyses by Smith in 2000,&lt;ref name="Smith2000"/&gt; based on samples of graphs from journals in seven major scientific disciplines, found that the amount of graph usage correlated "almost perfectly" with hardness (r=0.97). They also suggested that the hierarchy applies with individual fields, and demonstrated the same result using ten subfields of psychology (r=0.93).&lt;ref name="Smith2000"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Smith LD, Best LA, Stubbs A, Johnston J, Archibald AB |title=Scientific Graphs and the Hierarchy of the Sciences |journal=Social Studies of Science |year= 2000 |volume= 30 |issue= 1 |pages= 73–94 |doi= 10.1177/030631200030001003|url=http://sss.sagepub.com/content/30/1/73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fanelli 2010 proposed that we expect more positive outcomes in "softer" sciences because there are fewer constraints on researcher bias. They found that among research papers that tested a hypothesis, the frequency of positive results was predicted by the perceived hardness of the field. For example, the social sciences as a whole had a 2.3-fold increased odds of positive results compared to the physical sciences, with the biological sciences in between. They added that this supported the idea that the social sciences and natural sciences differ only in degree, as long as the social sciences follow the scientific approach.&lt;ref name="Fanelli2010"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Fanelli D| title="Positive" results increase down the Hierarchy of the Sciences. | journal=PLOS ONE | year= 2010 | volume= 5 | issue= 4 | pages= e10068 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010068 | pmc=2850928 | pmid= 20383332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fanelli 2013 tested whether the ability of researchers in a field to "achieve consensus and accumulate knowledge" increases with the hardness of the science, and sampled 29,000 papers from 12 disciplines using measurements that indicate the degree of scholarly consensus. Out of the three possibilities (hierarchy, hard/soft distinction, or no ordering), the results supported a hierarchy, with physical sciences performing the best followed by biological sciences and then social sciences. The results also held within disciplines, as well as when mathematics and the humanities were included.&lt;ref name="Fanelli2013"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fanelli D, Glänzel W | title=Bibliometric Evidence for a Hierarchy of the Sciences. | journal=PLOS ONE | year= 2013 | volume= 8 | issue= 6 | pages= e66938 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0066938 | pmc=3694152 | pmid= 23840557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Critics of the concept argue that soft sciences are implicitly considered to be less "legitimate" scientific fields,&lt;ref name="Wilson 2012" /&gt; or simply not scientific at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Berezow|first=Alex B.|title=Why psychology isn't science |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-blowback-pscyhology-science-20120713,0,1641705.story |accessdate=19 December 2012 |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |date=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An editorial in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' stated that social science findings are more likely to intersect with everyday experience and may be dismissed as "obvious or insignificant" as a result.&lt;ref name="Nature 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/487271a | title = A different agenda | journal = Nature | volume = 487 | issue = 7407 | pages = 271 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Being labelled a soft science can affect the perceived value of a discipline to society and the amount of funding available to it.&lt;ref name="Frost nd" /&gt; In the 1980s, mathematician [[Serge Lang]] successfully blocked influential political scientist [[Samuel P.

The '''Humanist Movement''' began in 1966 in [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], [[Argentina]] as a small group of people who gathered together to find a new response to the crisis of [[dehumanization]] and [[violence]] experienced by peoples worldwide. The global crisis was felt in all areas of human activity in the personal, social, economic, political and religious fields. By 1969, this small initial group had expanded into numerous groups in Argentina and [[Chile]] and their presence began to be noticed by the military regime of Argentina then in power. In the early years, the Humanist Movement was known as "[[Siloism]]", coined from the penname "Silo" of its founder [[Mario Rodríguez Cobos]].  The military regimes of Argentina and Chile began to censor and persecute the members during its meetings, gatherings, public acts and demonstrations. On May 4, 1969, the "siloists" gathered in [[Punta de Vacas]], Mendoza, Argentina and the speech "The Healing of Suffering" was given by Silo. This marks the foundation day for the Humanist Movement.

The systematic [[persecution]] of members in Chile and Argentina propelled the expansion of the movement to other countries. These countries included those in North America and Europe (i.e., [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Portugal]] and [[France]]) and the Asian countries of [[Philippines]], [[South Korea]], [[India]] and [[China]].{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--1--&gt; Hong Kong, then a British protectorate but part of China.}}

== Philippine beginnings (1970–1979) ==

In March 1973, four Chilean movement members{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--2--&gt; Pia Figueroa, Maria, Andres Burgos, Julian Burgos.}} arrived in the Philippines. On September of the previous year, [[martial law]] had been declared and the Philippines was experiencing the violence and suppression of the [[Ferdinand Marcos]] dictatorship. The press was controlled, the leftist and opposition groups had been neutralized or gone underground, curfews were enforced and fear permeated the political and university scenario. The Chilean humanists initially made contact with the students of the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]].

In 1974, soloist books ''Transcendental Meditation'' and ''Silo and the Liberation'' (Vol. II) were printed locally.{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--3--&gt; Kui-Feng Publishers, Dodo Cu Unying.}}

In 1975 the Chileans left and in the next years were followed by Argentinian members{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--4--&gt; Martha and Marcos Pampillon, Norma and Puchi Pelligrini, Fernando Garcia, Tito de Casas.}} who continued the tasks of organizing and transmitting the studies underlying the [[Humanist Movement]]. The Humanist Movement in the following years briefly went through internal stages at different moments and was then referred to as the School. The Synthesis Institute and enter of Inner Religion were launched in order to carry forward its studies but these were later discontinued.

By 1979, there was a core group of Filipinos who took on the challenge of organizing the movement in the Philippines. In December 1980, "Silo" or Mario Rodriguez Cobos visited the Philippines for a working seminar with Filipino members held at the AIT in the University of the Philippines in Diliman, [[Quezon City]].

== Humanize the Earth: The Community (early 1980s) ==

The 1980s marked the stage of public demonstrations. A worldwide campaign “[[Humanize the Earth]]” was launched in a massive public act on November 1, 1981 at [[Chowpatty Beach]], [[Mumbai]], India by its newly formed socio-cultural organization The [[Community for the Equilibrium and Development of the Human Being]]. This was followed by large public acts done in the major cities of [[North America|North]] and [[South America]], Europe and India. Speakers from various countries, among them members from India and the Philippines,{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--5--&gt; Ishak Binudin of Zamboanga officially represented Asia as part of the international panel of speakers for the public acts in the different countries.}} represented these public acts.

In 1982, the Community translated its materials into [[Filipino language|Pilipino]] and published its books{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--6--&gt; An ad hoc publication team called PROCOM was formed. The books were translated to Pilipino by Nestor Cabling and the publishing team included Silvestre Tapales, Boy Sevilla, Saturnino Filipino.}} “Ang Mga Gawain ng Komunidad” and “Ang Tanawing Panloob”.

The Community for the Equilibrium and Development of the Human Being was registered under the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--7--&gt; SEC, Philippine regulatory body for organizations, associations and business enterprises.}} on July, 1981, with nine incorporators.{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--8--&gt; The nine incorporators of The Community (1981): Ishak Binudin, Osbert Santillan, Melinda Gutierrez, Willa Tecson, Homer Gutierrez, Karina Lagdameo, Silvestre Tapales, Alice Inzon, and Evaine Alleria.}} Meetings and activities{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--9--&gt; University of Sto. Tomas (Rolly dela Cruz, Gemma Burgos, Mabel Garcia); Philippine Normal College (Peter Nepomuceno, Arturo Guillen, Manny Raymundo, Efren Abria, Ramon Moreno, Jojo Cariňo); Veterans Village (Eloisa Bustamante);Vinzons, UP Diliman (Louie Agnir); Bohol Ave. Quezon City (Joy Alberto), Makati (Tess Laserna, Chito Salazar, Karina Lagdameo, Osbert Santillan, Alice Inzon, Kim Tengco).}} started in Orion/Guerrero Sts. in [[Makati]], P. Tuazon at Quezon City, Petrona Apartment in [[Manila]], Carolina’s at Quezon Blvd., rented rooms, homes and ad hoc meeting places in schools and universities.

At this time Filipino society was gradually deteriorating under the Marcos dictatorship and the climate of apathy and suspicion surrounded its initial public activities. However, as a SEC registered organization espousing change through [[non-violence]], the initial obstacles placed by [[government official]]s on its public acts were gradually overcome. A flurry of public events and organizing activities marked the next three years carrying the banner “Humanize the Earth”. This was marked by numerous cultural open-air presentations,{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--10--&gt; Hugo Park in Sta. Ana, Manila (Nov. 28, 1981); Liwasang Balagtas in Pandacan, Manila (Dec. 12, 1981); Paco Park in Malate, Manila (May 7, 1981); Ugarte Field in Makati (Oct. 19, 1984); other areas from 1981 to 1982: Philtrade, Philcite, Fort Bonifacio Tenement Housing in Taguig.}} free public concerts and festivals,{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--11--&gt; ”Concert to Humanize the Earth” (June 12, 1982, Baguio City); “A Day of Joy” (May 4, 1984 in Glorietta, Makati); “Artists’ Festival for Non-Violence” (Aug. 18, 1984, in Greenbelt Park, Makati); “Konsyerto Laban Sa Karahasan” (date???, place???); “Let’s Build Peace” (March 18, 1984, Paco Park, Manila).}} indoor socio-cultural events,{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--12--&gt; ”Metropolis Celebration” (March 26, 1983 in Ali Mall, Quezon City); “A Night of Dancing” (July 15, 1982 in La Cueva, Greenbelt, Makati). “Festival para sa Kapwa” (Dec. 18, 1983, Quezon Blvd., Quezon City), “Force Fest” (March 17, 1983, Benitez Memorial Center, U.P. Diliman).}} AV shows, lectures and workshops.

In 1982, student chapters of The Community were formed in the [[National College of Business Administration]],{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--13--&gt; NCBA in Quezon City, spearheaded by Jose V. Narvades, students Rebecca de Paz (President),Gabriel de la Vega, Madeline Villalobos, Samuel Fugrad, Mency Ramo, Jeremias Ilao, Lolita Lim, Dennis B.

Recto, Manila along what is known as the university belt. The Community UP Chapter organized the “Humanist Week” composed of exhibits, film showing, seminars and workshops (April 30 to May 6, 1984, Diliman Campus in Quezon City). Workshops such as "Student Power for Non-Violence" were organized in schools and universities.

On May 4, 1984, the Movement in the Philippines launched a public concert called "A Day of Joy" held at the [[Glorietta Park]] in Makati.{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--18--&gt; Day of Joy:}}

There were metro-wide signature campaigns{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--19--&gt; ”Lagda Laban Sa Karahasan” (in favor of active non-violence), “1000 Friends for Peace”, “Lagda ng Bayan” (signature campaign to abolish the penalties attached to the right of suffrage).}} done to create awareness on the violence, get support and participation, and to address [[social issues]]. There were socio-cultural celebrations,{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--20--&gt; ”Active Non-Violence Week” (Aug. 15 to 21, 1984, Ayala Museum, Makati).}} symposia,{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--21--&gt; ”Sympo Laban Sa Karahasan” (Oct. 11, 1984, Ayala Museum, Makati)}} campaigns on education{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--22--&gt; ”Education Is Not A Business” (against capitation fees and donations practiced in schools).}} and [[women's rights]].{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--23--&gt; ”Women’s Rights in the Philippines” (June 21–22, 1984 in Ayala Museum, Makati)}}

In the late 1970s and early years of the 1980s, the Marcos regime was fast losing its popularity. Business [[investment]]s were pulling out, the economic and political future bleak. There was an exodus of Filipinos who left the country to look for better prospects or to seek [[political asylum]]. The majority of Filipinos were getting fed up but kept their views to themselves; in general, avoiding public outcry due to adverse reaction from the repressive government. It was in this general repressed scenario that The Community launched its public acts. Denouncements were made against violence, and active non-violence was proposed as a way of action. Forums, workshops, lectures, slide presentations and film showings were held in private as well as public municipal halls.

On August 21, 1983, the assassination of [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Benigno Aquino]], Marcos’ political opponent, created ripples in Philippine society. It broke the political stupor of the Filipinos and their discontent could not be silenced anymore.

== Humanist Party (1984–1989) ==

In 1984, the Humanist Movement, as an international structure, simultaneously launched the Humanist Party in different parts of the world. The [[Humanist Party]] is a [[political party]] to carry forward the humanist aspirations in the political arena. In 1984, a team of Italian humanists{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--24--&gt; Agostino Lotti, Claudio Miconi, Tomas Smidth, later Luciano Lagatola, Luis Milani.}} came to the Philippines to help establish the Humanist Party.

In 1985, it launched national campaigns with signature campaigns{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--25--&gt; "Signature Campaign Laban Sa PDA” (Preventive Detention Action)", "Makataong Pagsahod Sa Manggagawang Filipino", “Batas ng Pananagutang Pampulitika”.}} against the Preventive Detention Action, [[Pasya ng Bayan]] (people’s vote to oust Marcos), [[Magkaisa]] (awareness campaign against traditional political parties with the proposal for the people to organize themselves), labor and [[human rights]]. In 1985, The Humanist Party participated in labor rallies, conducted surveys and free medical and dental clinics. It organized chapters in the NCR, northern and southern [[Luzon]], and Mindanao{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--26--&gt; In the NCR, HP chapters were organized in Sta. Cruz, Manila (Patricio David), Manila Council (Scotty Estrera, Cora Cabueňos, Richard Jacinto, Tess Tapang, Babes Leyretana, Sarita de Guzman), U.P. Diliman (Eloisa Bustamante), Makati (Rodelio Macando, Pedro Dadula), Novaliches (Carmen Cabling in Bagbag, Jojo Pascual in Ibayo, Rodolfo Buendia in Urbano, Avon Ped in Parochia). In other areas: Region 4 (Francisco Clemente), Iligan City (Raphia Maglinao, Arturo Ballestra, Letty Morales, Esmar), Zamboanga City (Anita Tagadiad), Zamboanga del Sur (Gervasio Rana).}}. In 1987 it organized and held Humanist Party internal elections in the base council levels.

On February 7, 1986, the national snap elections were held by the Marcos regime to try to pacify the increasing discontent of the Filipino people. [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon “Cory” Aquino]] (the widow of assassinated Benigno Aquino) ran for presidential office. Marcos’victory was declared by the Commission on Elections but the majority of Filipino people refused to accept the rigged outcome. When the call for people's support came from the Enrile-Ramos breakaway military group in [[Camp Crame]] on February 22, spontaneous groups and organizations from different political positions, conscientious citizens, Catholic organizations rushed to the gates of Camp Crame. The spontaneous mobilization of people effectively blocked the main thoroughfare of the city. Subsequently, people from the other cities and provinces joined their support. The Humanist Party was among the first groups to answer the call for people's support, its political headquarters was located at P. Tuazon Street near Camp Crame. History recalls this moment as the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] (People Power 1 or the EDSA 1 Revolution), a non-violent phenomenon that gathered hundreds of thousands of people, finally culminating in the overthrow of the Marcos dictatorship and placing Corazon Aquino as the president.

It was during the 1986 Snap Elections that the Humanist Party first fielded independent candidates{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--27--&gt; Emma Ortega (Quezon City), Saturnino Filipino (Manila).}} for Councilors of Manila and Quezon City as its first political campaign action.

On December 10, 1986 the Humanist Party was launched at the steps of the Arts and Science Building of the University of the Philippines, [[Diliman]], Quezon City. This launch was preceded by a metro-wide [[teaser campaign]] that consisted of posting large posters with the words DEC 10 all along the main streets and avenues. On December 14, 1986, the Humanist Party held its first National Congress at U.P. Diliman, Quezon City.

When President Corazon Aquino took office, one of the priorities of the government was to abolish the [[1973 Philippine Constitution]] (which was in force during the Martial Law under the Marcos regime) and draft a new constitution by elected representatives to the Constitutional Assembly. One of the first campaigns launched by the Humanist Party after the fall of the Marcos dictatorship was "[[Konsultahin Ang Tao]]" as a requisite before drafting a new Philippine constitution.

In March 1987, the [[Humanist Party of the Philippines]] filed with the [[Commission on Elections]] for political party status and was granted{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--28--&gt; Ishak Binudin (General Secretary), Godofredo Gutierrez (Sec. of Political Action), Saturnino Filipino (Administrative Secretary), Silvestre Tapales (Sec. of Mass Media), Gemma Suzara (Sec. of Finance), Belen Garcia (Sec, of Public Relations), Rai Delacruz (Sec. of Organization), Florencio Hubo (Sec. of Labor), Willa Tecson (Sec. for Legal Affairs), Carmen Cabling (Sec. of Social Action), and Emma Ortega (Sec. for Women).}}.

However, the Humanist Party was short-lived. Its members, at that time were more inclined towards socio-cultural activities rather than political expression. It experienced a loss of crucial leadership by emigration of some of its founding members to other countries; and when there was an emphasis and redirection towards structural Humanist Movement activities, the Humanist Party activities were dropped.

== Humanist Movement in the 1990s ==

On May 2, 1988, “Unzipped” A Festival of Converging Diversity participated by various artists and musicians{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--29--&gt; Artists and bands were Grace Nono, Sampaguita, Dodo Crisol, Pinikpikan, Fatal Posporos, Glue, Purple Grass, Cany Audioline, and others.}} was organized at the [[Greenbelt Park]] at Makati, this time by the Humanist Movement in close coordination with the Greenbelt Organic Producers Market.{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--30--&gt; Greenbelt Organic Producers Market (Mara Pardo de Tavera), Humanist organizers: Gemma Suzara, Karina Lagdameo Santillan, Osbert Santillan, Ishak Binudin, Florencio Hubo,Willa Tecson.}}

The 1990s ushered in a new stage,  that of influencing the social and immediate environment and taking root in the community, work and school places where members belonged.  The Humanist Movement was the banner organization and numerous [[study group]]s, weekly meetings, workshops, “encounters” of self-development, “retreats”, “personal works” were organized to qualify members and plan activities. Neighborhood Centers were established in [[Baclaran]], [[Sampaloc, Quezon|Sampaloc]], [[Pasig]] at the Victory Theater Building, [[Taytay, Palawan|Taytay]], Makati, [[Mandaluyong]], [[Veterans Village|Muñoz]]-[[Quezon City]], [[San Francisco del Monte]]-[[Quezon City]], Teachers Village-Quezon City, [[Iligan City]].{{refn|group=n|&lt;!--31--&gt; Baclaran (Ipe Perez), Sampaloc (Derek Constantino), Taytay (JV Villanueva, Aga Francisco, Dan), Makati (Ishak Binudin, Catherine Binudin, Liza Nakpil, Karina Santillan, Gemma Suzara, Ana, Paul, Willa Tecson), Mandaluyong (Osberto Santillan), Muñoz-Quezon City (Fortune Bucud), Teachers Village (Carlo Maglinao, Carla Cantara), San Francisco del Monte-Quezon City (Carmen Cabling, Florencio Hubo), UP (Jun Custodio,Bogs, Bart Rodriguez), Iligan City (Raphia Maglinao).}}  The thrust was that the principles of new humanism take root not only in the inner life (in the heart and mind) but to find its expression (in action) in the social life of family, friends, school and work.

=== Humanist clubs and action fronts ===

==== The Green Party ====

From 1988 to 1993, the Humanist Movement took up the ecological banner and launched activities under the [[Green Party of the Philippines]] and [[Green Future]].

The World March marked a new stage, ending the decade of localized action and introduced new dynamics and ways of work that could be carried forward to the next decade. Networking and linkages, both local and international, were developed.  Also, the use of media to spread the global consciousness for peace was a significant development.

With the World March, the call for a new world was launched and was taken up by millions of people from different latitudes and cultures. Time will tell if this signal was strong enough to resonate to the future in the coming decade.

=== The next decade (2010-      ) ===

==== The five organizations ====
In January 2010, the Humanist Movement met briefly in [[Argentina]] and officially de-structured itself. Existing internal councils functioning within the Humanist Movement were dissolved, allowing the independent development of the five organizations: the Community for Human Development, Convergence of Cultures, Center of Humanist Studies, Humanist Party and World Without Wars.

He proposed his rhymed play ''O sărutare'' to the [[National Theatre Bucharest|National Theatre of Bucharest]] during the same autumn. As [[Ion Luca Caragiale|I. L. Caragiale]] commended it, the play was performed on 21st March 1900. (He later became a board member of the National Theatre.)&lt;ref&gt;Monitorul Oficial 09/22.10.1911 (N. 152), 7092 (N. 3067).&lt;/ref&gt; As a member of a student delegation representing the [[University of Bucharest]], Petrovici participated in the commemoration of the 400th anniversary of [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]]'s death, which took place in the then Austrian town of [[Suceava]] in summer 1904. He graduated in [[Philosophy]] in 1904, with the dissertation ''O problemă de filosofie'' (''A Philosophy Problem'') and became the first home-grown Romanian [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in June 1905, with the PhD thesis ''Paralelismul psiho-fizic'' (''Psychological-physical Parallelism''). Petrovici attended philosophy classes by [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and [[Hans Volkelt]] in [[Leipzig]] and by [[Friedrich Paulsen]], [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and [[Alois Riehl]] in [[Berlin]] during the academic year 1905-1906. He was appointed lecturer at the Philosophy Department of the [[University of Iaşi]] in November 1906 and professor in 1912.  He served as Dean of the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy in [[Iaşi]] between 1923 and 1926. He was a visiting professor at the [[University of Paris]] and the [[Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques]] in ([[Paris]]) at the end of January 1932, where he lectured on ''La Nationalité en Philosophie'' and ''L'Idée de néant''. He collaborated with [[André Lalande (philosopher)|André Lalande]] and [[Paul Gaultier]]. He was elected member of the [[Romanian Academy]] on 28th May 1935.
&lt;br&gt;As a member of [[Octavian Goga]]'s anti-Semitic ministry (1937–1938),&lt;ref&gt;Monitorul Oficial 28.12.1937 (N. 299), p. 9665-9666 (N. 4322).&lt;/ref&gt; Ion Petrovici planned to restrict the access of Jewish pupils to universities (the so-called ''[[numerus clausus]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Siebenbürgisch-Deutsches Tageblatt 05.01.1938: Numerus clausus an den Hochschulen.&lt;/ref&gt; and decided that Romanian language, history and geography teachers be only ethnic Romanians.&lt;ref&gt;Monitorul Oficial 29.01.1938 (N. 23), p. 634 (N. 238).&lt;/ref&gt; From 1941 to 1944 he served as Minister of Culture and Religious Affairs in [[Ion Antonescu]]'s government, organizing an intergovernmental agency that coordinated the deportation of Jewish converts.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Shafir, "Memory, Memorials, and Membership", in Henry F. Carey, ''Romania since 1989: Politics, Economics, and Society'', p.74. Lexington Books, 2004. {{ISBN|0-7391-0592-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;He was arrested in 1948 following the advent of the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]] and sentenced to 10 years of hard labour for his participation in the Antonescu ministry.&lt;ref&gt;Matricola penală: http://5.2.132.65/Fise%20matricole%20penale%20-%20detinuti%20politici/P/P%2007.%20Petri%20-%20Piorus/Petrovici%20Ioan%20D-tru/P1200791.JPG&lt;/ref&gt; After serving his sentence, he was deported to Bărăgan in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Matricola penală: http://5.2.132.65/Fise%20matricole%20penale%20-%20detinuti%20politici/P/P%2007.%20Petri%20-%20Piorus/Petrovici%20Ioan%20D-tru/P1200802.JPG&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Petrovici died in Bucharest in 1972.
&lt;br&gt;Petrovici contributed to [[Philosophy]] with his research in [[Logic]] regarding the theory of notions and with his [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] conception, which connects [[faith]] to [[reason]]. Ion Petrovici was an internationally known philosopher during [[interwar period]]. He contributed to prestigious philosophy journals in [[France]] and [[Germany]] and chaired international congresses.

'''John Caird''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|FRSE}} ({{IPAc-en|k|ɛər|d}}; 15 December 1820 – 30 July 1898) was a Scottish [[theology|theologian]]. He entered the [[Church of Scotland]], of which he became one of the most eloquent preachers. He served as the Principal of the [[University of Glasgow]] from 1873 until 1898.

== Life ==
He was born in [[Greenock]] the son of John Caird of Caird and Co and Janet Young. His younger brother was [[Edward Caird]].

He was educated at Greenock Grammar School, and then attended the [[University of Glasgow]] (MA 1845).

After being a minister at [[Ayr|Newton-on-Ayr]], at [[Lady Yester's Church]], Edinburgh (1847-1849), and at [[Errol, Perthshire]] (1849-1857), Caird was transferred to [[Park Church, Glasgow]] (1857–62).

In 1862 he became [[Professor of Divinity, Glasgow|Professor of Divinity]] at the [[Glasgow University]], and in 1873, following the death of [[Thomas Barclay (minister)|Thomas Barclay]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gashe.ac.uk:443/isaar/P0348.html&lt;/ref&gt; became [[Principal of the University of Glasgow|Principal]] of the university, a post he held for 26 years, until 1898.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Glasgow made him a Doctor of Divinity in 1860 and the [[University of Edinburgh]] awarded him an honorary Doctor of Laws (LLD) in 1884.

A sermon on ''Religion in Common Life'', preached before [[Queen Victoria]], made him known throughout the Protestant world. He wrote ''[[An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion]]'' (1880), and ''Spinoza'' (1888).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNBSupp|wstitle=Caird, John |first=Thomas Wilson |last=Bayne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caird delivered the 1892-1896 [[Gifford Lectures]] at the [[University of Glasgow]], entitled ''The Fundamental Ideas of Christianity''.

In 1897 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].

He died in [[Greenock]] and is buried in [[Greenock Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Karola Stotz''' (born 08 September 1963 in [[Neumünster]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Germany]]) is a German scholar of [[philosophy of biology|philosophy of biology]], [[cognitive science]], and [[philosophy of science|philosophy of science]]. With [[Paul E. Griffiths]], she pioneered the use of [[experimental philosophy]] methods in the field of philosophy of science.&lt;ref&gt; Griffiths, P. E., Stotz, K. (2008) Experimental Philosophy of Science // Philosophy Compass, 3 (3):507-721.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Education and career==
Stotz received her Magister Artium in Biology and Social Sciences (Anthropology) in 1993 (University of Mainz) and her PhD in Philosophy from the University of Ghent (Belgium) in 1999 under the supervision of Gertrudis Van de Vijver and [[Werner Callebaut]]. In the period between 1999-2007 she worked at different universities of Australia and the United States of America. From 2008 until 2013 Stotz was Australian Research Fellow and, later, Bridging Support Fellow at the Department of Philosophy, [[University of Sydney]]. At 2014 she received the position of Senior Lecturer at the Department of Philosophy, [[Macquarie University]] (Australia). From 2014 to 2017, with her partner Paul Griffiths, Stotz worked on a Templeton World Charity Foundation project entitled: “Causal Foundations of Biological Information”. &lt;ref&gt; https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects/causal-foundations-of-biological-information#project-details&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-genetic inheritance and the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis==
In different papers Stotz argues for an Extended Evolutionary Synthesis through the inclusion of non-genetic (extended, exogenetic) inheritance mechanisms and processes in the explanation of evolution. According to Stotz, the Modern Evolutionary Synthesis should go beyond the antinomy of biological vs cultural and revise more inclusive theories of gene-culture coevolution and niche construction. Such a revised theory of evolution should take into account genetic, epigenetic (molecular and cellular), behavioral, ecological, socio-cultural and cognitive-symbolic legacies.&lt;ref&gt; Stotz, K. (2014) Extended evolutionary psychology: the importance of transgenerational developmental plasticity // Frontiers in Psychology 5: 908. doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00908&lt;/ref&gt;
Stotz argues that:

“Environments, particularly in the form of developmental environments, do not just select for variation, they also create new variation by inﬂuencing development through the liable transmission of non-genetic but heritable information.”&lt;ref&gt; Stotz, K. (2014) Extended evolutionary psychology: the importance of transgenerational developmental plasticity // Frontiers in Psychology 5: 908. doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00908. P.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developmental Niche Construction==
Stotz introduced the concept of Developmental Niche Construction as an integrative framework for the study of various non-genetic (exogenetic) inheritance mechanisms and for an explanation of how the environment (physical, biological or social) can construct new heritable variations during individual development. This concept originated in the idea of the ‘ontogenetic niche’ introduced in 1987 by developmental psychobiologists Meredith West and Andrew King,&lt;ref&gt; West, M. J., King, A. P. (1987). Settling nature and nurture into an ontogenetic niche // Developmental Psychobiology: The Journal of the International Society for Developmental Psychobiology, 20(5): 549-562.&lt;/ref&gt; and theory of 'niche construction' presented by biologist John Odling-Smee in 1988.&lt;ref&gt; Odling-Smee F. J. (1988). Niche-constructing phenotypes. In H. C. Plotkin (Ed.), The role of behavior in evolution (pp. 73-132). Cambridge, MA, US: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Stotz juxtaposes Developmental Niche Construction with Niche Constriction Theory and its concept of the ‘Selective Niche’ that stresses the role of selection in evolution rather than the production of new variation in developmental systems.&lt;ref&gt; Stotz, K. (2017). Why developmental niche construction is not selective niche construction: and why it matters. Interface Focus, 7(5), 20160157.&lt;/ref&gt; She reconstructs the developmental system of DST as the Organism-Developmental Niche System. It informs the Developmental Systems Account of Human Nature developed together with Paul Griffiths.&lt;ref&gt; Griffiths, P., Stotz, K.  (2018) A Developmental Systems Account of Human Nature. In E. Hannon and T. Lewens (Eds.) Why we disagree about human nature. Oxford University Press, pp. 58-75.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Stotz, K. (2010) Human Nature and Cognitive-Developmental Niche construction // Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences 9 (4): 483-501.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extended Evolutionary Psychology==
According to Stotz there is a natural afﬁnity between the theoretical view of the nature of the mind and an understanding of how the mind developed and evolved. “Which kind of evolutionary theory you apply matters deeply to which kind of (evolutionary) psychology you get.”&lt;ref&gt; Stotz, K. (2014) Extended evolutionary psychology: the importance of transgenerational developmental plasticity // Frontiers in Psychology 5: 908. doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00908. P.2&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, the ideas of nativist’s evolutionary psychologists are often based on the Modern Evolutionary Synthesis which explains the origin of behavioral, social and cognitive capacities by the sudden appearance of genetically determined mental modules or representational systems. 
As an alternative, Stotz proposes an Extended Evolutionary Psychology based on ideas of an Extended Evolutionary synthesis, Developmental Systems Theory, and embodied, embedded, enacted and extended models of cognition. She states that these approaches are a more appropriate alternative to traditional cognitivism and methodological individualism because they emphasise the importance of external scaffolding of cognition through developmental, ecological, cognitive and cultural niche construction.&lt;ref&gt; Stotz, K. (2014) Extended evolutionary psychology: the importance of transgenerational developmental plasticity // Frontiers in Psychology 5: 908. doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00908. P.9-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stammderlikatierlogo.gif|thumb]]
The '''Likatier tribe''' (in [[German language|German]] '''''Stamm der Likatier''''', known as ''Stamm Füssen Eins'' until 1998) is a community of about 200 people (more than half being minors) who live and work together in [[Füssen]] in the south of [[Germany]]. The group is not a [[tribe]] in the usual sense, since anyone can become a member. It owns several houses and businesses in the city, and critics sometimes view it as a [[cult]] or [[sect]], although members do not share a common well-defined religious or spiritual belief system.

The community was founded in 1974 by then 17-year-old Wolfgang Wankmiller, who still leads it. It strives for independence and self-sufficiency with minimal environmental impact, practices [[ovo-lacto vegetarianism]], and encourages [[free love]] while tolerating stable relationships. Separate men's and women's discussion groups meet weekly. Children are raised as a group by several women; some children are schooled privately by members of the tribe in a house across the border in [[Austria]] (as home schooling is not possible in Germany).

Several of the group's activities are related to [[esotericism]], and a 
self-description states "our foremost goal is the perception and understanding of reality and its expression in vibrancy". The group also has its own internal currency and employs a creative approach to language, giving uncommon names to days or to everyday objects. It intends to create a genuine new "tribe culture" and is in active contact with other ecological communities around the world.

The group is hierarchically organized, with members having different "levels" reflecting their commitment to the tribe. There is also an outer circle of people who join the group in some of its activities but for the most part live separately.

In the 1970s the tribe tried to undermine several organizations in Füssen, and Wankmiller was active in local politics for a while. The Likatier are generally regarded with suspicion or even hostility in the city, and a citizen's action group has been formed that opposes the tribe and supports people who want to leave it.

In 2001, a cook of the group was sentenced to 2 and a half years in prison for sexual abuse of five minor members of the tribe. While the trial judge found that the behavior was neither condoned by nor connected to the group, critics have pointed out that the cook was readmitted to the community after having served his sentence. The German [[yellow journalism|yellow press]] occasionally reports on the group in a sensationalist manner, labeling Wankmiller as a "Sex-Guru", claiming that he believe himself to be a reincarnation of Jesus, and accusing the group of running sex orgies in the presence of minors.

To counter negative publicity, the group started a website in 2003. It has always welcomed outside visitors, and has recently started to offer "get-to-know" seminars.

'''Louis Auguste Paul Rougier''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁuʒje|lang}}; 10 April 1889 – 14 October 1982) was a French [[philosophy|philosopher]]. Rougier made many important contributions to [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of science]], [[political philosophy]] and the history of [[Christianity]].

==Biography==
{{unsourced|section|date=February 2018}}
Rougier was born in [[Lyon]]. Debilitated by [[pleurisy]] in his youth, he was declared unfit for service in [[World War I]] and devoted his adolescence to intellectual pursuits.

After receiving the ''agrégation de philosophie'' degree from the [[University of Lyon]], Rougier taught until 1924 at various [[Secondary education in France|lycées]] and obtained his doctorate from the [[Sorbonne]] in 1920. His [[doctoral thesis]] work was published that year as ''La philosophie géometrique de Poincaré'' and ''Les paralogismes du rationalisme''. Rougier already had several publications to his name, however, beginning with a 1914 paper on the use of [[Non-euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometry]] in [[Special relativity|relativity]] theory.

Rougier taught in [[Algiers]] from 1917-20, and then in [[Rome]] from 1920 to 1924. His first university appointment in [[France]] was at the [[University of Besançon]] in 1925, where he served on the faculty until his dismissal in 1948 for political reasons. Further university appointments were in [[Cairo]] from 1931–36, the [[New School for Social Research]] from 1941–43 and the [[Université de Montréal]] in 1945. Rougier's final academic appointment was to the [[Université de Caen]] in 1954, but he retired at the age of 66 after only one year there.

==Death==
{{unsourced|section|date=February 2018}}
Rougier lived to the age of 93 and was survived by his third wife, Lucy Friedman. Dr. Friedman, whom he married in 1942, was a former secretary to [[Moritz Schlick]]. Although Friedman had a daughter from a previous marriage, Rougier himself had no children.

==Philosophy==
Under the influence of [[Henri Poincaré]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], Rougier developed a philosophy based on the idea that [[systems of logic]] are neither [[apodictic]] (''i.e.'', [[logical truth|necessarily true]] and therefore [[Deductive reasoning|deducible]]) nor [[assertoric]] (''i.e.'', not necessarily true and whose truth must therefore be [[Inductive reasoning|induced]] through empirical investigation.) Instead, Rougier proposed that the various systems of logic are simply conventions that are adopted based on contingent circumstances.

This view, which implies that there are no "objective," ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' truths that exist independently of the human mind, closely resembled the [[logical positivism]] of the [[Vienna Circle]]. Many members of this group, including [[Philipp Frank]], greatly admired Rougier's 1920 work ''Les paralogismes du rationalisme.'' Rougier soon became the group's only French associate and formed close personal ties to several of its leading members, including [[Moritz Schlick]] (to whom Rougier's 1955 book ''Traité de la connaissance'' is dedicated) and [[Hans Reichenbach]]. Rougier also participated as an organizer and contributor to many Vienna Circle activities, including the [[International Encyclopedia of Unified Science]]. Rougier's own contribution to the ''Encyclopedia'' never materialized, however, because he soon became one of many participants who ended up quarreling with [[Otto Neurath]], the project's editor-in-chief.

==Religion==
Rougier's conventionalist philosophical position naturally led him to oppose [[Neo-Thomism]], which had been the official philosophy of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] since the 1879 encyclical ''Aeterna Patris'' but was gaining particular momentum during the 1920s and 1930s. Rougier published several works during this period attacking this contemporary revival of [[scholasticism]], thereby earning the personal enmity of prominent Thomists such as [[Étienne Gilson]] and [[Jacques Maritain]].

Rougier's objections to Neo-Thomism were not merely philosophical, however, but formed part of a general opposition to [[Christianity]] that he had already begun to develop during his adolescence under the influence of [[Ernest Renan]]. This early opposition to Christianity continued to influence intellectual work of Rougier's maturity, leading him in 1926 to publish a translation of [[Celsus]] that is still in use today.

==Politics==
Rougier was also a [[political philosophy|political philosopher]] in the [[liberalism|liberal]] tradition of [[Montesquieu]], [[Benjamin Constant|Constant]], [[Guizot]], and [[Tocqueville]]. Consistent with his conventionalist epistemology, Rougier believed that political power rests not upon eternally valid claims, but upon conventions that he called ''mystiques''. The only possible reason to prefer one political system over another, he believed, depends not on eternal truths but on purely pragmatic grounds. In other words, political systems should be chosen not based on how "true" they are, but rather on how well they work.

After visiting the [[Soviet Union]] in 1932 on a visit sponsored by France's Ministry of Education, Rougier became convinced that [[planned economy|planned economies]] do not work as well as [[market economy|market economies]]. This conviction led him to participate in the organization of the first [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] organization of the twentieth century, the ''[[Colloque Walter Lippmann]]'', in 1938. During the same year, Rougier helped to found the ''Centre international d'études pour la rénovation du libéralisme''. The political network established by these two groups eventually led to the 1947 foundation of the famous [[Mont Pelerin Society]], to which Rougier was elected in the 1960s through the personal backing of [[Friedrich Hayek|Friedrich von Hayek]].

Rougier, as one of the founding fathers of [[neoliberalism]], would no doubt have been admitted to the first meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society had it not been for a second political engagement that proved disastrous to his career and reputation: his activities on behalf of the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime in France during [[World War II]]. In October 1940, [[Philippe Pétain]] sent Rougier on a secret mission to the British government in London, where he met with [[Winston Churchill]] between 21-25 October. 

Rougier later claimed in several published works that these meetings resulted in an agreement between Vichy and Churchill that he called the " ''Mission secrète à Londres : les Accords Pétain-Churchill ''", an allegation that the British government later denied in an official [[White Paper]]. Although these activities and publications eventually led to Rougier's dismissal in 1948 from his teaching position at the University of Besançon, Rougier continued to be active throughout the 1950s in organizations that defended Pétain. He also published works denouncing the [[Épuration légale|''épuration'']] (the French equivalent of [[denazification]] that was carried out on formerly Vichy territory by the Allies after the war) as illegal and totalitarian. Finally, Rougier was active in an effort that petitioned the United Nations in 1951, alleging that the Allies had committed [[human rights]] violations and [[war crimes]] during the ''Libération''.

During the 1970s, Rougier formed a second controversial political alliance: with the [[Nouvelle Droite]] of the French writer [[Alain de Benoist]]. Rougier's long-standing opposition to [[Christianity]], together with his conviction that "the West" possesses a pragmatically superior ''mentalité'' to those of other cultures, aligned closely with the views of this movement. Benoist reissued and wrote prefaces to several of Rougier's earlier works, and in 1974 Benoist's think tank [[Groupement de recherche et d'études pour la civilisation européenne|GRECE]] published an entirely new book by Rougier: ''Le conflit du Christianisme primitif et de la civilisation antique''.

Not to be confused with [[modern Stoicism]], a similar movement in the early 21st century.

Neostoicism was founded by [[Flemish people|Flemish]] [[Renaissance Humanism|humanist]] [[Justus Lipsius]] (1547 – 1606), who in 1584 presented its rules, expounded in his book ''[[De constantia]]'' (''On Constancy''), as a [[dialogue]] between Lipsius and his friend Charles de Langhe.&lt;ref&gt;Justus Lipsius, ''On Constancy'' available in English translation by John Stradling, edited by John Sellars (Bristol Phoenix Press, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In the dialogue, Lipsius and de Langhe explore aspects of contemporary political predicaments, by reference to the classical Greek and pagan Stoicism, in particular as found in the Latin writings of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. He further developed Neostoicism in his treatises ''Manuductionis ad stoicam philosophiam'' (''Introduction to the Stoic Philosophy'') and ''Physiologia stoicorum'' (''Physics of the Stoics''), both published in 1604.

Neostoicism is a practical [[philosophy]] which holds that the basic rule of good [[life]] is that the [[human]] should not yield to the [[passion (emotion)|passions]], but submit to [[God]]. Neostoicism recognizes four [[Stoic passions|passions]]: [[Seven deadly sins#Greed|greed]], [[joy]], [[fear]] and [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]]. Although the human has the [[free will]], everything that happens (even if it is [[evil|wrong]] because of the human) is under control of God and finally it tends to the [[Good and evil|good]]. The human who complies with this rule is [[Freedom (philosophy)|free]], because he is not overcome by the [[instinct]]s. He is also calm, because all the material [[pleasure]]s and [[suffering]]s are irrelevant for him. Finally, he is really, [[spirit]]ually [[happiness|happy]], because he lives close to God.

Neostoicism had a direct influence on many seventeenth and eighteenth-century writers including [[Montesquieu]], [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bossuet]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]], [[Francisco de Quevedo]] and [[Juan de Vera y Figueroa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=justus-lipsius |title=Justus Lipsius}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[Guillaume du Vair]], ''Traité de la Constance'' (1594), was another important influence in the Neostoicism movement, but while Lipsius based his Stoicism on the writings of Seneca, du Vair emphasised the Stoic thought of [[Epictetus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/n/neostoic.htm#SH4a The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: John Sellars, ''Neostoicism''.]&lt;/ref&gt; The painter [[Peter Paul Rubens]] was a disciple and friend of Lipsius, and there is a painting made by Rubens, now in the [[Pitti Palace]] showing Rubens standing next to Lipsius as he teaches two students who are seated in front of him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/1992/03.03.12.html ''Stoics and Neostoics: Rubens and the Circle of Lipsius''] by Mark Morford, Bryn Mawr Classical Review.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artchive.com/artchive/R/rubens/rubens_four_philosophers.jpg.html Peter Paul Rubens ''The Four Philosophers''], The Artchive.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3299">'''Neurath's boat''' is a [[simile]] used in [[anti-foundationalism|anti-foundational]] accounts of [[knowledge]], especially in the [[philosophy of science]], which was first formulated by [[Otto Neurath]]. It is based in part on the [[Ship of Theseus]] which, however, is standardly used to illustrate other philosophical questions, to do with problems of [[identity (philosophy)|identity]].&lt;ref name=ONPSP&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|title=Otto Neurath: Philosophy Between Science and Politics|volume=38|series=Ideas in Context|first1=Nancy|last1=Cartwright|authorlink1=Nancy Cartwright (philosopher) |first2=Jordi|last2=Cat|first3=Lola|last3=Fleck|first4=Thomas E.|last4=Uebel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780521041119|chapter=On Neurath's Boat|pages=89–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularised by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] in ''[[Word and Object]]'' (1960).

==Different versions==
Neurath used the simile in several occasions,&lt;ref name=ONPSP/&gt;&lt;ref name=antispengler&gt;{{cite book |last=Neurath |first=Otto |title=Anti-Spengler |year=1921 |doi=10.1007/978-94-010-2525-6_6 |isbn=978-90-277-0259-3 |at=Vienna Circle Collection vol. 1: ''Empiricism and Sociology'' (1973)}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first being in Neurath's text ''Problems in War Economics''.

{{quote|We are like sailors who on the open sea must reconstruct their ship but are never able to start afresh from the bottom. Where a beam is taken away a new one must at once be put there, and for this the rest of the ship is used as support. In this way, by using the old beams and driftwood the ship can be shaped entirely anew, but only by gradual reconstruction.}}

[[Keith Stanovich|Stanovich]], in his book ''The Robot's Rebellion'', refers to it as a '''Neurathian bootstrap''' and uses it as an analogy to the [[recursion|recursive]] nature of revising one's beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Stanovich, Keith E. (2004-05-15). ''The Robot's Rebellion: Finding Meaning in the Age of Darwin'' (1 ed.). University Of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-77089-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A "rotten plank" on the ship, for instance, might refer to a [[meme|meme virus]] or a junk meme (i.e., a meme that is either maladaptive to the individual, or serves no beneficial purpose for the realization of an individual's life goals). It may be impossible to bring the ship to shore for repairs, therefore one may stand on planks that are not rotten in order to repair or replace the ones that are. At a later time, the planks previously used for support may be tested by standing on other planks that are not rotten:

{{quote|"We can conduct certain tests assuming that certain [[memeplex]]es (e.g., science, logic, rationality) are foundational, but at a later time we might want to bring these latter memeplexes into question too. The more comprehensively we have tested our interlocking memeplexes, the more confident we can be that we have not let a meme virus enter into our mindware..." (p. 181)}}

In this way, one might proceed to examine and revise their beliefs so as to become more rational.

'''Nikolaos Margioris''' (Greek: Νικόλαος Μαργιωρής; 1913–1993) was a Greek [[Western esotericism|esoterist]], [[philosopher]], and author. He taught for many decades various [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] and philosophical subjects. He wrote also many practical and philosophical books.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.papasotiriou.gr/author/480308&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Nikolaos Margioris was born in the island of [[Samos]] on 15 December 1913.  He moved to [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]] at a very young age. He fought in [[World War II|World War Two]] and in the [[Greek Civil War]]. He fought in World War II as a reserve officer, where he was seriously injured in [[Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]] and in [[Battle of Rimini (1944)|Rimini]]. For his services to the country he was honored with many medals (it is worth mentioning the Grand Cross) as well as with the veteran’s disability pension. Later, he was in [[Tibet]] and [[India]] for his training for almost one decade. He returned in Alexandria afterwards, where he started teaching to sophisticated people of the region. He left Egypt in 1958 with his family, and moved to [[Athens]], [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agiospatapios.gr/page.php?page_id=9|title=Ο Αγιος Πατάπιος - Νικόλαος Μαργιωρής - agiopatapios.gr|last=Πατάπιος|first=Αγιος|website=www.agiospatapios.gr|access-date=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He created many philosophical schools called [[Omakoio]] (Ομακοείο), in many different Greek cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://omakoio.blogspot.com/2010/11/100.html|title=ESOTERICISM FOR ALL - Ο ΕΣΩΤΕΡΙΣΜΟΣ ΓΙΑ ΟΛΟΥΣ: ΝΙΚΟΛΑΟΣ Α.

He wrote 33 books.

He died on 6 May 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.omakoio.gr/index.php/en/omakoio-biographies/biographicals/nikolaos-a-margioris|title=Biographical-note Nikolaos Agr|last=omakoio|website=omakoio.gr|access-date=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nikolaos Margioris belongs also to the ''[[Great Greeks|100 Great Greeks]]'' as he greatly contributed to the formation, presentation and popularization of current Greek metaphysical philosophy based on the comparative analysis of the most popular international philosophical views in this area with the corresponding Greek views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skai.gr/tv/show/?showid=63878|title=Μεγάλοι Έλληνες — ΣΚΑΪ (www.skai.gr)|website=www.skai.gr|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/57396/article/ekathimerini/life/the-100-greatest-greeks-of-all-time|title=The 100 greatest Greeks of all time {{!}} Kathimerini|website=www.ekathimerini.com|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skai.gr/news/greece/article/109889/%CE%9F%CE%B9-%CE%9C%CE%B5%CE%B3%CE%AC%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%B9-%CE%88%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%B7%CE%BD%CE%B5%CF%82-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7-%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%81%CE%AE-%CE%BF%CE%B8%CF%8C%CE%BD%CE%B7/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=100 ΜΕΓΑΛΟΙ ΕΛΛΗΝΕΣ|last=|first=|publisher=ΣΚΑΙ ΒΙΒΛΙΑ|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nikolaos Margioris was a uniquely gifted modern esoteric experiential personality, of multiple talents and of unprecedented dynamism and productivity, who noiselessly passed the threshold of his country, delivered the quintessence of integrated spiritual experiences that summarizes the interaction of a metaphysical worldview in the oriental cultures and the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]], [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Christian Orthodox]] view of life and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From The Master's Mouth to The Student's Ear|last=Katsiampas|first=Ilias|publisher=Omakoio of Trikala|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metaphysical philosophy ==
Nikolaos Margioris considered [[metaphysics]] as the only truth, believing that it is possible for the man to realize the truth.

In his writings he deals with issues such as arithmosofia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblionet.gr/book/47163/%25CE%259C%25CE%25B1%25CF%2581%25CE%25B3%25CE%25B9%25CF%2589%25CF%2581%25CE%25AE%25CF%2582,_%25CE%259D%25CE%25B9%25CE%25BA%25CF%258C%25CE%25BB%25CE%25B1%25CE%25BF%25CF%2582_%25CE%2591./%25CE%2597_%25CF%2580%25CF%2585%25CE%25B8%25CE%25B1%25CE%25B3%25CF%258C%25CF%2581%25CE%25B5%25CE%25B9%25CE%25B1_%25CE%25B1%25CF%2581%25CE%25B9%25CE%25B8%25CE%25BC%25CE%25BF%25CF%2583%25CE%25BF%25CF%2586%25CE%25AF%25CE%25B1|title=.:BiblioNet : Η πυθαγόρεια αριθμοσοφία / Μαργιωρής, Νικόλαος Α.|website=www.biblionet.gr|access-date=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; considered [[pseudomathematics]] or [[pseudoscience]] by scientists.

Books such as ''Dravidians, the Pre-hellenic Greeks'' belong to the movement of [[Neopythagoreanism]]. He describes myths as reaity, like the war of the Atlanteans against Dravidians, which he places chronologically around 16,000 years BC, a time where is no documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Δραβίδες οι πρόγονοι των Ελλήνων|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
After 23 years of metaphysical publications (1970–1993), he wrote 33 books of clearly Esoteric subject-matter, with an incredible and unprecedented metaphysical analysis which led to increasing popularity for those who know the subject. He also wrote multiple essays on various Esoteric matters. He circulated the metaphysical journal ''OMAKOIO''. He created a field of studies through correspondence courses under the name Esoteric Key. In this field, the students received instruction characterized by a deep, theoretical and practical Esoteric analysis, in many different courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.omakoio.gr/index.php/en/omakoio-biographies/biographicals/nikolaos-a-margioris|title=Biographical-note Nikolaos Agr|last=omakoio|website=omakoio.gr|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every three months, he held seminars in [[Shiatsu]] lasting for many days in which he himself not only taught Shiatsu but a lot of other Esoteric therapeutic systems among which were also his own discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://omakoio.blogspot.gr/|title=ESOTERICISM FOR ALL - Ο ΕΣΩΤΕΡΙΣΜΟΣ ΓΙΑ ΟΛΟΥΣ|website=omakoio.blogspot.gr|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from teaching therapeutic systems, he himself applied therapies. Also, his students who had been instructed in these techniques applied these therapies. Meanwhile, a school of [[Kriya Yoga]] was established, bringin Kriya Yoga in Greece for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=ΚΡΙΓΙΑ ΓΙΟΓΚΑ|last=Margioris|first=Nikolaos|publisher=Εκδόσεις Κληρονόμων Ν.Α Μαργιωρή|year=2000|isbn=960-7484-07-X|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He himself taught the pure and complete [[Rāja yoga|Raja Yoga]], as well as many other yoga systems like  [[Mantram Yoga|Mantram]], [[Karma yoga|Karma]], [[Gnana yoga|Gnani-a]], Bakti-a, [[Kundalini yoga|Kundalini]].

He also started teaching in Greece the mysticism of Christianity, and the Christocentral mysticism.

All his lectures and didactic activities took place in his seat, in his Spiritual Laboratory, which, from its establishment in 1976, he called the [[Omakoio of Athens]] in memory of the Omakoio which [[Pythagoras]] first established in Croton of South Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://revealedtheninthwave.blogspot.gr/2012/09/blog-post_144.html|title=Η ΑΠΟΚΑΛΥΨΗ ΤΟΥ ΕΝΑΤΟΥ ΚΥΜΑΤΟΣ: ΑΡΘΡΟ-ΕΡΓΑΣΙΑ ΓΙΑ ΤΗΝ ΕΣΩΤΕΡΙΚΗ ΘΕΡΑΠΕΥΤΙΚΗ: ΥΓΕΙΑ – ΑΡΡΩΣΤΙΑ - ΘΕΡΑΠΕΙΑ|website=revealedtheninthwave.blogspot.gr|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, he established the Association The Pious Pilgrims, where he tirelessly held free lectures on various Esoteric subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Apocalypse of John|last=Katsiampas|first=Ilias|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''non-Archimedean time''' theory of [[time]] is any theory that holds that there exist instants infinitely in the future or infinitely in the past. It is so called because, if the instants of such time are assigned numbers, the set of such numbers must be [[Archimedean property|non-Archimedean]].

Non-Archimedean future time would [[logical consequence|entail]] the existence of a future moment ''T'', such that for any finite duration ''y'' there exists a moment ''Now''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'' but less than ''T''. Note that if such a future moment ''T'' existed, there would exist an infinity of moments such that for all finite moments ''y' '', ''T''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''y' '' would be after every moment ''Now''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'' where ''y'' is a finite duration. Likewise, one may conceive of a non-archimedean past.

One may distinguish singularly, multiply and infinitely non-Archimedean times. In a singularly non-archimedean time, we can choose (albeit arbitrarily) a single moment ''T'' infinitely in the future (and/or the past, ''[[mutatis mutandis]]''), such that every other moment infinitely in the future (past) is finitely in the future or past of ''T''. In a multiply non-Archimedean time, there exists a finite set of moments ''S'' (where the cardinality of ''S'' is greater than two) such that each member of ''S'', ''T'', is infinitely in the future or past of every other element of ''S'', and there exists an infinity of moments finitely in the future of ''T'', and every instant that is not an element of ''S'' is finitely in the future or past of one element of ''S'', and infinitely in the future or past of every other element of ''S''. Finally, for an infinitely non-archimedean time there is no such finite set ''S'', but there is an infinite set ''S'', ''mutatis mutandis''.

{{Refimprove|date=February 2015}}

'''Peacemaking''' is practical [[conflict transformation]] focused upon establishing equitable power relationships robust enough to forestall future conflict, often including the establishment of means of agreeing on [[ethical decision]]s within a community, or among parties, that had previously engaged in inappropriate (i.e. violent) responses to conflict. Peacemaking seeks to achieve full reconciliation among adversaries and new mutual understanding among parties and stakeholders. When applied in [[criminal justice]] matters, peacemaking is usually called [[restorative justice]], but sometimes also [[transformative justice]], a term coined by the late Canadian justice theorist and activist [[Ruth Morris]].  One popular example of peacemaking is the several types of [[mediation]], usually between two parties and involving a third, a [[facilitator]] or mediator.

==Methods==
{{See also|Peacebuilding#Approaches to peacebuilding}}

Some geopolitical entities, such as nation-states and international organizations, attempt to relegate the term peacemaking to large, systemic, often factional conflicts in which no member of the community can avoid involvement, and in which no faction or segment can claim to be completely innocent of the problems, citing as instances post-[[genocide]] situations, or extreme situations of oppression such as [[apartheid]]. However peacemaking is a universal and age-old approach to conflict at all levels and among any and all parties, and its principles may be generalized and used in many different kinds of conflicts.
In contemporary international affairs, especially after the end of the [[Cold War]], the concept of peacemaking has often been associated to the imposition upon warring parties of a peace settlement, usually under the auspices of an international organization.
Peacemaking in smaller, traditional societies has often involved rituals. For example, [[Alula Pankhurst]] has produced films about peacemaking among Ethiopian communities.

The process of peacemaking is distinct from the rationale of [[pacifism]] or the use of [[non-violent protest]] or [[civil disobedience]] techniques, though they are often practiced by the same people.  Indeed, those who master using nonviolent techniques under extreme violent pressure, and those who lead others in such resistance, have usually demonstrated the capacity not to react to violent provocation in kind, and thus may be more highly skilled at working with groups of people that may have suffered through violence and oppression, keeping them coordinated and in good order through the necessary, often difficult phases of [[rapprochement]].
Given that, and a track record of not advocating violent responses, it is these leaders who are usually most qualified for peacemaking when future conflict breaks out between the previously warring sides.

==Gandhi==
[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] is widely recognized as an important theorist of peacemaking strategies.  He noted in particular that leaders who had been successful at violent strategies were counter-productive in peace time, simply because these strategies now had to be abandoned.  But if a movement had adulated and emulated these people, it was unlikely ever to be able to make permanent peace even with those factions it had conquered or dominated, simply because the leaders lacked the skills and had become leaders in part for their suppression of the other side.  Accordingly, even if a movement were to benefit from violent action, and even if such action was extremely effective in ending some other oppression, no movement that sought long-term peace could safely hold up these acts or persons as a [[moral example]] or advise emulating either.  Gandhi's views have influenced modern [[ethicist]]s in forming a critique of [[terrorism]], in which even those who support the goals must decry the methods and avoid making, for instance, a [[suicide bomber]] into a hero.

==Christianity==
The Catholic Church has changed its view on peacemaking over the centuries. Some early Christians refused to join Rome’s Imperial army. A doctrine of a [[Just War theory]] originated with St. Augustine of Hippo in the 5th century. Versions of Just War doctrines have claimed that countries and people should keep peace at all cost.  The right of a ruler to go to war must meet the criteria of just cause, comparative justice, competent authority, right intention, probability of success, last resort, and proportionality. The [[Colombian conflict]] is the present day, prime Catholic example.

The tradition of Christianity continues to be taken up by those who seek peace. Jesus taught, "[...] all who take the sword will perish by the sword." (Matthew 26:52, NAB&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PVZ.HTM|title=The New American Bible|last=|first=|date=11/11/2|website=www.vatican.va|via=Androids must manually "Request desktop site".|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Twenty years after the cessation of the [[Reichskonkordat]]'','' Pope Paul VI proclaimed “No more war, war never again!” (Address to United Nations General Assembly, October 4, 1965 retweeted by Pope Francis Sept.2, 2013) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=Pontifex|author=Pope Francis|number=374466943312330753|date=2 September 2013|title=War never again!

Cross Currents, 60, 328-331,476-477&lt;/ref&gt; Christians teach that a great (false) peace will soon be made.

(1978) Science in The Middle Ages, ed. David Lindberg, Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press. p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in the Italian town from which he takes his name, now [[Abano Terme]]. He gained fame by writing ''Conciliator Differentiarum, quæ inter Philosophos et Medicos Versantur''. He was eventually accused of heresy and atheism, and came before the [[Inquisition]]. He died in prison in 1315 (some sources say 1316&lt;ref name = 'Barrett'/&gt;) before the end of his trial.&lt;ref name = 'Tsoucalas'&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tsoucalas G, Karamanou M, Androutsos G |title=The eminent Italian scholar Pietro d'Abano (1250-1315) and his contribution in anatomy |journal=Ital J Anat Embryol |volume=116 |issue=1 |pages=52–5 |year=2011 |pmid=21898974 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He lived in Greece for a period of time&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; before he moved and commenced his studies for a long time at Constantinople (between 1270 and 1290). Around 1300 he moved to Paris, where he was promoted to the degrees of doctor in philosophy and medicine, in the practice of which he was very successful, but his fees were remarkably high. In Paris he became known as "the Great Lombard". He settled at [[Padua]], where he gained a reputation as a physician. Also an [[astrologer]],&lt;ref&gt;An important text, ''Astrolabium planum in tabulis ascendens'', was attributed to him.&lt;/ref&gt; he was charged with practising [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]: the specific accusations being that he got back, by the aid of the [[devil]], all the money he paid away, and that he possessed the [[philosopher's stone]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abano, Pietro D'|volume=1|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gabriel Naude]], in his ''Antiquitate Scholæ Medicæ Parisiensis'', gives the following account of him:

{{quotation|Let us next produce Peter de Apona, or Peter de Abano, called the Reconciler, on account of the famous book which he published during his residence in your university.

It is certain that physic lay buried in Italy, scarce known to any one, uncultivated and unadorned, till its tutelar genius, a villager of Apona, destined to free Italy from its barbarism and ignorance, as [[Marcus Furius Camillus|Camillus]] once freed Rome from the siege of the Gauls, made diligent enquiry in what part of the world polite literature was most happily cultivated, philosophy most subtilly handled, and physic taught with the greatest solidity and purity; and being assured that Paris alone laid claim to this honour, thither he presently flies; giving himself up wholly to her tutelage, he applied himself diligently to the mysteries of philosophy and medicine; obtained a degree and the laurel in both; and afterwards taught them both with great applause: and after a stay of many years, loaden with the wealth acquired among you, and, after having become the most famous philosopher, astrologer, physician, and mathematician of his time, returns to his own country, where, in the opinion of the judicious [[Scardeon]], he was the first restorer of true philosophy and physic. Gratitude, therefore, calls upon you to acknowledge your obligations due to [[Michæl Angelus Blondus]], a physician of Rome, who in the last century undertaking to publish the ''Conciliationes Physiognomicæ'' of your Aponensian doctor, and finding they had been composed at Paris, and in your university, chose to publish them in the name, and under the patronage, of your society.}}

He carried his enquiries so far into the occult sciences of abstruse and hidden nature, that, after having given most ample proofs, by his writings concerning [[physiognomy]], [[geomancy]], and [[chiromancy]], he moved on to the study of philosophy, [[physics]], and astrology; which studies proved so advantageous to him, that, not to speak of the two first, which introduced him to all the popes of his time, and acquired him a reputation among learned men, it is certain that he was a great master in the latter, which appears not only by the astronomical figures he had painted in the great hall of the palace at Padua, and the translations he made of the books of the most learned rabbi [[Abraham ibn Ezra|Abraham Aben Ezra]], added to those he himself composed on critical days, and the improvement of astronomy, but by the testimony of the renowned mathematician [[Regiomontanus]], who made a fine panegyric on him, in quality of an astrologer, in the oration he delivered publicly at Padua when he explained there the book of ''Alfraganus''.

==Writings==
[[Image:Pietro - Conciliator differentiarum philosophorum et precipue medicorum - 2989416.tif|thumb|''Conciliator differentiarum philosophorum et precipue medicorum'']]
In his writings he expounds and advocates the medical and philosophical systems of [[Averroes]], [[Avicenna]],&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; and other Islamic  writers. His best known works are the ''Conciliator differentiarum quae inter philosophos et medicos versantur'' and ''De venenis eorumque remediis'',&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; both of which are extant in dozens of manuscripts and various printed editions from the late fifteenth through sixteenth centuries. The former was an attempt to reconcile apparent contradictions between medical theory and Aristotelian natural philosophy, and was considered authoritative as late as the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1E1-Abano-Pi.html ''The Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th ed.]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been alleged that Abano also wrote a [[grimoire]] called the ''Heptameron'', a concise book of ritual magical rites concerned with conjuring specific angels for the seven days of the week (hence the title). It should not be confused with the ''[[Heptaméron]]'' of [[Marguerite de Navarre|Marguerite of Navarre]]. He is also credited with writing ''[[De venenis eorumque remediis]]'', which expounded on Arab theories concerning superstitions, poisons and contagions.&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt;

==The Inquisition==
[[File:Nuremberg Chronicle f 224r 3.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Generic portrait of ''Petr[us] de abano conciliator'',&lt;the reversed 'c' is a standard Latin abbreviation for the prefix 'con-'&gt; woodcut from the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'', 1493]]
He was twice brought to trial by the Inquisition; on the first occasion he was acquitted, and he died before the second trial was completed. He was found guilty, however, and his body was ordered to be exhumed and burned; but a friend had secretly removed it, and the Inquisition had therefore to content itself with the public proclamation of its sentence and the burning of Abano in [[effigy]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

According to Naude:

{{quotation|The general opinion of almost all authors is, that he was the greatest magician of his time; that by means of seven spirits, familiar, which he kept inclosed in chrystal, he had acquired the knowledge of the seven liberal arts, and that he had the art of causing the money he had made use of to return again into his pocket. He was accused of magic in the eightieth year of his age, and that dying in the year 1305, before his trial was over, he was condemned (as Castellan reports) to the fire; and that a bundle of straw, or osier, representing his person, was publicly burnt at Padua; that by so rigorous an example, and by the fear of incurring a like penalty, they might suppress the reading of three books which he had composed on this subject: the first of which is the noted ''Heptameron'', or ''Magical Elements of Peter de Abano, Philosopher'', now extant, and printed at the end of [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa|Agrippa]]'s works; the second, that which [[Johannes Trithemius|Trithemius]] calls ''Elucidarium Necromanticum Petri de Abano''; and a third, called by the same author ''Liber experimentorum mirabilium de Annulis secundem, 28 Mansiom Lunæ''.}}

[[Image:Klosterhof Apsis 2.jpg|thumb|right|Apse with his sarcophagus.]]

Barrett (p.&amp;nbsp;157) refers to the opinion that it was not on the score of magic that the Inquisition sentenced Pietro to death, but because he endeavoured to account for the wonderful effects in nature by the influences of the celestial bodies, not attributing them to angels or demons; so that [[heresy]], rather than magic, in the form of opposition to the doctrine of spiritual beings, seems to have led to his persecution. To quote Barrett:&lt;ref name = 'Barrett'&gt;{{cite book |author=Francis Barrett |title=The magus: being a complete system of occult philosophy |publisher=S. Weiser |location=New York |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-87728-942-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|His body, being privately taken out of his grave by his friends, escaped the vigilance of the Inquisitors, who would have condemned it to be burnt. He was removed from place to place, and at last deposited in St. Augustin's Church, without epitaph, or any other mark of honor. His accusers ascribed inconsistent opinions to him; they charged him with being a magician, and yet with denying the existence of spirits. He had such an antipathy to milk, that seeing anyone take it made him vomit. He died about the year 1316 in the sixty-sixth year of his age.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17883">'''Postinternet''' denotes an idea in arts and criticism that refers to society and modes of interaction following the widespread adoption of the internet. The term emerged from discussions about [[Internet Art]] by [[Marisa Olson]], Gene McHugh, and Artie Vierkant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/nov/1/postinternet/ What's Postinternet Got to do with Net Art?], Rhizome, Michael Connor, November 1st, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Guthrie Lonergan and [[Cory Arcangel]] have mentioned it as a term for being "internet aware", which some believe to be more accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandra Domanović and Oliver Laric in conversation with Caitlin Jones, page 114 , MASS EFFECT, Art And The Internet In The Twenty First Century&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally it is described as art that is about the internet's effects on aesthetics, culture and society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artspace.com/magazine/interviews_features/post_internet_art What Is Post-Internet Art? Understanding the Revolutionary New Art Movement], Artspace, Ian Wallace
March 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The term “post-internet” refers not to a time 'after' the internet, but rather to an internet state of mind...'', is written on a press release for ''Art Post-Internet,'' an exhibition organized by the [[Ullens Center for Contemporary Art]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the term claim that it falsely implies that there is a kind of art made after the internet has ceased to exist (and artists such as [[Rafael Rozendaal]] have criticized the ambiguity of "post-" in this instance).

==History and context==
The idea of art post-internet was born in the wake of [[Internet Art]], which gained significant traction in the early- to mid-2000s. Much like Internet Art, the postinternet art movement has roots in [[Dada]], [[Fluxus]], and exploration of net culture in general. Unlike Internet Art, postinternet art is less heavily influenced, at least in form, by [[telematic art]], being more concerned in commenting on communications technology (the internet) than in being medium-native to the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/mar/26/mission-creep/#_ftn4|title=Rhizome - Mission Creep: K-Hole and Trend Forecasting as Creative Practice|work=rhizome.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Works created within the postinternet paradigm often shares the aesthetics of the [[Internet Art]], [[net.art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artfcity.com/2014/10/14/finally-a-semi-definitive-definition-of-post-internet-art/|title=Finally, a Semi-Definitive Definition of Post-Internet Art|work=Art F City}}&lt;/ref&gt; and DataDada Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://datadada.net/en/|title=DataDada|work=datadada.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differs in that it does not use the internet only as a tool to produce art, but addresses the internet as a force that has altered social structures in both digital and physical spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newrafael.com/post-internet-art/|title=Rafaël Rozendaal  -   Post internet art|work=newrafael.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postinternet art is not necessarily art produced on the internet, but art that reflects the internet and the internet's effects on culture and society.

Postinternet art has gained some attention because of [[Petra Cortright]]'s work, ''BRIDAL SHOWER&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYkFibbxeHw|title=BRIDAL SHOWER|date=9 November 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://totallystockholm.se/arts-culture/post-internet-art-petra-cortright/|title = Post-internet Art with Petra Cortright|work = Totally Stockholm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and notably also [[Katja Novitskova]]'s work, ''Post Internet Survival Guide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://katjanovi.net/postinternetsurvivalguide.html|title=POST INTERNET SURVIVAL GUIDE 2010|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;''. Postinternet art by [[Harm van den Dorpel]] has been covered on the Creators Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/harm-van-den-dorpels-post-internet-art/|title = Navigating the Complexity of Harm van den Dorpel’s Post-Internet Art|work = Creators Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, [[LaBeouf, Rönkkö &amp; Turner]] described their collaborative practice as "partly a response to how post-internet artists were using social media to promote their work and how that promotion became the work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shia LaBeouf art show collaborators speak out about his alleged rape|url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/30/shia-labeouf-collaborators-turner-ronkko-speak-alleged-rape-iamsorry-art-show|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-04-22|first = David|last = Batty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics have also applied the ideas of postinternet art in discussions of the use of the internet by some contemporary British and American poets,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whalley|first=Charles|date=2015-07-03|title=THIS HAS BEEN A BLUE/GREEN MESSAGE EXITING THE SOCIAL WORLD|url=|journal=The Poetry Review|volume=105|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance [[Steve Roggenbuck]], [[Sam Riviere]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sabotagereviews.com/2013/11/26/kim-kardashians-marriage-by-sam-riviere/|title=Kim Kardashian’s Marriage by Sam Riviere|last=Whalley|first=Charles|date=2013-11-26|website=Sabotage|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/17627-sam-riviere-kim-kardashians-marriage-poetry-review-post-flarf-google|title=Positivity As Tension: On Kim Kardashian's Marriage|last=Whalley|first=Charles|date=2015-04-26|website=The Quietus|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Steven Zultanski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/post-internet-poetry-comes-of-age|title=Post-Internet Poetry Comes of Age|last=Kenneth|first=Goldsmith|date=2015-03-10|website=The New Yorker|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Encompassing work otherwise frequently grouped under [[Alt lit]], [[flarf]] or [[conceptual poetry]], postinternet poetry articulates the ubiquity of the experience of internet and social media usage among poets, similar to the ideas in visual art described above, such that the internet touches all elements of a poem's composition and distribution without necessarily being an explicit focus of the work itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whalley|first=Charles|date=2015-07-03|title=THIS HAS BEEN A BLUE/GREEN MESSAGE EXITING THE SOCIAL WORLD|url=|journal=The Poetry Review|volume=105|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the conceptual poet [[Kenneth Goldsmith]] remarks in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', a postinternet poem "seems to view the Internet with a shrug".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/post-internet-poetry-comes-of-age|title=Post-Internet Poetry Comes of Age|last=Kenneth|first=Goldsmith|date=2015-03-10|website=The New Yorker|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and philosophy==
Postinternet art has been criticized as being art ''about'' the internet, rather than art ''of'' the internet, in the manner of Net Art. In doing so, postinternet art loses many of the structural benefits of Net Art, namely that postinternet art exists through the institution of physical galleries. While Net Art sought to redefine a space for its work, postinternet art is more rooted in an older, traditional notion of the role of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/29/arts/international/post-internet-art-waits-its-turn.html|title=Post-Internet Art Waits Its Turn|date=29 September 2014|work=The New York Times|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crisis of postinternet art is often characterized as a question of how the inherently intangible and democratized work resulting from internet content-creation paradigms can be monetized, and in this sense postinternet art is sometimes negatively described as the image of network-native art repackaged for the gallery or for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/mar/26/mission-creep/|title=Rhizome - Mission Creep: K-Hole and Trend Forecasting as Creative Practice|work=rhizome.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the contrary, it has also been proposed that postinternet is more like a condition for art making and critical thinking. Since the internet is no longer an option but a necessity in our society, one must also be critically aware of the internet's impact on society when making art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elephantmag.com/youll-know-it-when-you-see-it/|title=Post-Internet Art: You'll Know It When You See It - ELEPHANT|work=ELEPHANT|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also clearly stated by Marisa Olson in an interview with "''we make money not art"-'' blogger Regine Debatty;

''"There doesn't seem to be a need to distinguish, any more, whether technology was used in making the work - after all, everything is a technology, and everyone uses technology to do everything. What is even more interesting is the way in which people are starting to make what I've called "post-internet" art in my own work (such as my'' Monitor Tracings''), or what Guthrie Lonergan recently called "''Internet Aware Art"''. I think it's important to address the impacts of the internet on culture at large, and this can be done well on networks but can and should also exist offline. Of course, it's an exciting challenge to explain to someone how this is still internet art.... If that really matters".''&lt;ref&gt;Regine Debatty, "interview with Marisa Olson", we make money not art, March 28, 2008, http://we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/2008/03/how-does-one-become-marisa.php.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, it has been proposed by Stefan Heidenreich in discussions with students at ''[[The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]]'' during his lecture, ''Networks and Objects: On Postinternet, Speculative Realism, Media- or Network Theory and related artistic practises,'' that the strength of the postinternet term comes from it being undefinable or at least  very difficult to define.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-flux.com/journal/freeportism-as-style-and-ideology-part-i-post-internet-and-speculative-realism/|title=Freeportism as Style and Ideology: Post-Internet and Speculative Realism, Part I|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist [[Paul Kneale]] discusses post internet in an interview with [[i-D]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/vbdv9x/canadian-artist-paul-kneale-says-post-internet-is-dead|title=Freeportism as Style and Ideology: Post-Internet and Speculative Realism, Part I|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the interview entitled 'Canadian Artist Paul Kneale Says Post Internet is Dead', Kneale rephrases the term calling it 'Post-Art Internet.' He uses this to highlight that categorising art in terms of the period it belongs to has lost its validity in the new age of internet. He states: 

″The thing we call 'art' is a historical period, like ancient art — it has a vague beginning point that makes it a period, and also an end, which is usually marked by a major changes in other areas of life. Quite possibly we've just witnessed this end. The thing that we call 'Internet' is a whole way of being in the world. It's the Internet you know from your browser window, but also the Internet of things and materials, and also the internet of minds, of tastes and feelings. After this passing historical period 'Art', you have this new period 'Internet'. So it makes sense to ask, what does that change mean for aesthetics? How do we present and represent in this new period?″

'''Progressive Christianity''' is a "post-liberal movement" within [[Christianity]] "that seeks to reform the faith via the insights of post-modernism and a reclaiming of the truth beyond the verifiable historicity and factuality of the passages in the Bible by affirming the truths within the stories that may not have actually happened."&lt;ref name="Wolsey 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rev-roger-wolsey/progressive-christianity-isnt-progressive-politics_b_1897381.html|title=Progressive Christianity Isn't Progressive Politics|author=Roger Wolsey|date=10 February 2012|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Progressive Christianity represents a [[Postmodernism|post-modern]] theological approach, and is not necessarily synonymous with progressive politics.&lt;ref name="Wolsey 2012"/&gt; It developed out of the [[Liberal Christianity]] of the [[Modernity|modern-era]], which was rooted in [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] thinking.&lt;ref name="Wolsey 2012"/&gt; 

Progressive Christianity is characterized by a willingness to question tradition, acceptance of human diversity, a strong emphasis on [[social justice]] and care for the poor and the oppressed, and environmental stewardship of the earth. Progressive Christians have a deep belief in the centrality of the instruction to [[The New Commandment|"love one another"]] (John 15:17) within the teachings of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soul Play: What Is Progressive Christianity Exactly?|url=http://www.flipsidepress.org/content/soul-play%3A-what-progressive-christianity-exactly%3F|work=The Flip Side|publisher=University of Wisconsin – Eau Claire|accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This leads to a focus on promoting values such as compassion, justice, mercy, and tolerance, often through political activism. Though prominent, the movement is by no means the only significant movement of progressive thought among Christians.

Progressive Christianity draws on the insights of multiple theological streams including [[evangelicalism]], [[liberal Christianity|liberalism]], [[neo-orthodoxy]], [[pragmatism]], [[postmodernism]], [[Progressive Reconstructionism]], and [[liberation theology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.progressivechristianwitness.org/pcw.cfm?id=13&amp;p=3 Witness Articles - Progressive Christian Witness&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928144414/http://www.progressivechristianwitness.org/pcw.cfm?id=13&amp;p=3 |date=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the terms Progressive Christianity and [[Liberal Christianity]] are often used synonymously, the two movements are distinct, despite much overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |URL=http://www.sdc.unitingchurch.org.au/WestarProgressiveArticle.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008175803/http://www.sdc.unitingchurch.org.au/WestarProgressiveArticle.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-10-08 |title=Grassroots Progressive Christianity A Quiet Revolution |author=Hal Taussig |date=May–June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
A priority of justice and care for the down-trodden are a recurrent theme in the [[Hebrew]] [[prophet]]ic tradition inherited by [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ess|first=Charles|title=Prophetic, Wisdom, and Apocalyptic Traditions in Judaism and Christianity|url=http://www.drury.edu/ess/alpha/prophet.html|publisher=Drury University|accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has been reflected in many later Christian traditions of service and [[Christian ministry|ministry]], and more recently in the United States of America through Christian involvement in political trends such as the [[Progressive Movement]] and the [[Social Gospel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boulton|first=Wayne G., Thomas D. Kennedy and Allen Verhey|title=From Christ to the World: Introductory Readings in Christian Ethics|year=1994|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|location=Grand Rapids MI|isbn=0-8028-0640-6|pages=134–136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JstVXOH75LwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 20th century, a strand of progressive or liberal Christian thought outlined the values of a 'good [[society]]'. It stresses fairness, justice, responsibility, and compassion, and condemns the forms of governance that wage [[Just war|unjust war]], rely on corruption for continued power, deprive the poor of facilities, or exclude particular racial or sexual groups from fair participation in national liberties. It was influential in the US [[mainline (Protestant)|mainline]] churches, and reflected global trends in [[student activism]]. It contributed to the [[Christian ecumenism|ecumenical movement]], as represented internationally by the [[World Student Christian Federation]] and the [[World Council of Churches]] internationally, and at the national level through groups such as the [[National Council of Churches]] in the USA and [[Australian Student Christian Movement]].

==The contemporary movement==
The ascendancy of [[Evangelicalism]] in the US, particularly in its more socially conservative forms, challenged many people in mainline churches. Recently, a focus for those who wish to challenge this ascendancy has been provided by [[Jim Wallis]] of ''[[Sojourners]]'', who described himself as a progressive evangelical Christian, although Sojourners has rejected advertisements urging mainline churches to welcome gay members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.christianitytoday.com/ctpolitics/2011/05/sojourners_decl.html|title=Christianity Today - Theology, Church, Culture|author=|date=|work=ChristianityToday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has enabled many Christians who are uncomfortable with conservative evangelicalism to identify themselves explicitly as "Progressive Christians." At the onset of this new movement to organize Progressive Christians, the single largest force holding together was a [[webring]], ''The Progressive Christian Bloggers Network'', and supporters frequently find and contact each other through dozens of online chat-rooms.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Notable initiatives within the movement for progressive Christianity include [[Center for Progressive Christianity|The Center for Progressive Christianity]] (TCPC) in Cambridge, MA, [[The Beatitudes Society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beatitudessociety.org/|title=Homepage » Site » The Beatitudes Society|author=|date=|work=beatitudessociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the campaigning organization CrossLeft, the technology working group Social Redemption and The Progressive Episcopal Church (TPEC).{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[CrossLeft]] joined with [[Every Voice Network]] and [[Claiming the Blessing]] in October 2005 to stage a major conference, [[Path to Action]], at the [[National Cathedral]] in Washington, DC. Among the speakers were [[E. J. Dionne]], [[Richard Parker (economist)|Richard Parker]], [[Jim Wallis]], Senator [[John Danforth|Danforth]], and [[David Hollinger]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In the United Kingdom, the movement is represented by the Progressive Christianity Network Britain. Notable related UK organisations include the Center for Radical Christianity at [[Church of St Mark, Broomhill, Sheffield|St Marks, Sheffield]], and the UK-based [[Sea of Faith]] network.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Examples of statements of contemporary Progressive Christian beliefs include:
*the Eight Points produced by TCPC: a statement of agreement about Christianity as a basis for tolerance and human rights;
*the [[Phoenix Affirmations]] produced by Crosswalk (Phoenix, AZ) - include twelve points defining Christian love of God, Christian love of neighbor, and Christian love of self.

* the working definition utilized in Roger Wolsey's book ''Kissing Fish: Christianity for People Who Don't Like Christianity'':
:[...] Progressive Christianity is an approach to the Christian faith that is influenced by post-liberalism and postmodernism and: proclaims Jesus of Nazareth as Christ, Savior, and Lord; emphasizes the Way and teachings of Jesus, not merely His person; emphasizes God's immanence not merely God's transcendence; leans toward panentheism rather than supernatural theism; emphasizes salvation here and now instead of primarily in heaven later; emphasizes being saved for robust, abundant/eternal life over being saved from hell; emphasizes the social/communal aspects of salvation instead of merely the personal; stresses social justice as integral to Christian discipleship; takes the Bible seriously but not necessarily literally, embracing a more interpretive, metaphorical understanding; emphasizes orthopraxy instead of orthodoxy (right actions over right beliefs); embraces reason as well as paradox and mystery — instead of blind allegiance to rigid doctrines and dogmas; does not consider homosexuality to be sinful; and does not claim that Christianity is the only valid or viable way to connect to God (is non-exclusive).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progressivechristianitybook.com|title=Kissing Fish Home Page|author=|date=|work=progressivechristianitybook}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:• As Wolsey mentions, Progressive Christianity "leans toward panentheism rather than supernatural theism..." The role of panentheism in Progressive Christianity shifts the emphasis from belief to contemplative practice and experiential faith. So Progressive Christianity is often characterized by contemplative or meditative forms of worship. This finds perhaps its most poignant expression in ''[https://www.amazon.com/Finding-God-Body-Spiritual-Modern/dp/0692760229 Finding God in the Body: A Spiritual Path for the Modern West]'' by [http://www.findinggodinthebody.com/about-the-author/ Benjamin Riggs]:
:"The Kingdom is literally hidden in plain sight. It is hidden in basic awareness. When seen through the light of God’s awareness, the ordinary is revealed to be the extra-ordinary. The world is set ablaze by the fire of direct experience. The walls are awake, the ground is breathing, and mere mortals shine with the radiance of the sky. It is as if the world is looking back at us through the same eye with which we see it. We live in the Mind of God… The whole of creation exists within the fullness of God’s Will."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.findinggodinthebody.com/|title=Finding God in the Body: A Spiritual Path for the Modern West|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences between Progressive Christianity and Conservative Christianity===

According to [[Archbishop]] Wynn Wagner of the [[Old Catholic Church]], holding to the ideals of progressive Christianity sets the movement apart from traditional [[Christianity]].  Inclusiveness and acceptance is the basic posture of progressive Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;:*Abp. [[Wynn Wagner III]], ''[https://www.amazon.com/dp/144999279X A Pilgrim's Guide to the Old Catholic Church]'', Mystic Ways,2009,{{ISBN|978-1-4499-9279-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seventh-day Adventism===
{{Main|Progressive Adventism}}
Within the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], the liberal wing describe themselves as "progressive Adventists". They disagree with some of the traditional teachings of the church. While most are still of evangelical persuasion, a minority are liberal Christians.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Environmental ministries==

As Bruce Sanguin writes, "It's time for the Christian church to get with a cosmological program (...). We now know, for instance, that we live in an evolving or evolutionary universe. Evolution is the way that the Holy creates in space and in time, in every sphere: material, biological, social, cultural, psychological, and spiritual. This new cosmology simply cannot be contained by old models and images of God, or by old ways of being the church.".&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Sanguin - Darwin, Divinity, and the Dance of the Cosmos, Copperhouse and Woodlake Publishing , 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to this recovery of awe in the cosmos is the [[epic of evolution]], the 14-billion-year history of the universe. Scientists ([[Edward O. Wilson]], [[Brian Swimme]], [[Eric Chaisson]], [[Ursula Goodenough]] and others) initiated this story which has been perpetuated with a religion component by some liberal theologians ([[Gordon D. Kaufman]], [[Jerome A. Stone]], [[Michael Dowd]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;:*Edward O. Wilson, ''On Human Nature'', Harvard University Press,1979,{{ISBN|0-674-01638-6}}
:*''The Universe Story: From the Primordial Flaring Forth to the Ecozoic Era'': A Celebration of the Unfolding of the Cosmos; Brian Swimme, Harper, 1992 (1994, {{ISBN|0-06-250835-0}})

:*Eric Chaisson - ''Epic of Evolution,'' Columbia University Press (2 March 2007), {{ISBN|0-231-13561-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;:*Jerome A. Stone - ''Religious Naturalism Today: The Rebirth of a Forgotten Alternative'', State U. of New York Press (Dec 2008), {{ISBN|0-7914-7537-9}}

:*Gordon Kaufman - ''In the Beginning….Creativity'', Augsburg Fortress Publishers (July 2004), {{ISBN|0-8006-6093-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary evangelist and progressive minister [[Michael Dowd]] uses the term Epic of Evolution or Great Story to help construct his viewpoint of evolution theology. His position is that science and religious faith are not mutually exclusive (a form of [[religious naturalism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thankgodforevolution.com/node/1128|title=Evolution Theology: Religion 2.0 - Thank God For Evolution|author=|date=|work=thankgodforevolution.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He preaches that the epic of cosmic, biological, and human evolution, revealed by science, is a basis for an inspiring and meaningful view of our place in the universe and a new approach to religion. Evolution is viewed as a religious spiritual process that is not meaningless blind chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thankgodforevolution.com/book|title=The Book - Thank God For Evolution|author=|date=|work=thankgodforevolution.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Geoff Thompson argues that the rhetoric of Progressive Christianity, as represented by Gretta Vosper and [[John Shelby Spong]], "often over-reaches its arguments."&lt;ref name="Thompson 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://trinity.qld.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/UTC_Essay05.pdf |journal=Uniting Theology and Church |issue=5 |date=February 2011|author= Geoff Thompson|title=Progressive Christianity: Testing Its Arguments |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223094904/http://trinity.qld.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/UTC_Essay05.pdf |archivedate=23 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he concludes that "[i]t is very difficult to see how what [Vosper] proposes needs any church or even the minimalist, idiosyncratic definition of Christianity which she offers.&lt;ref name="Thompson 2011"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3878">'''Semantic properties''' or '''meaning properties''' are those aspects of a linguistic unit, such as a [[morpheme]], [[word]], or [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], that contribute to the meaning of that unit. Basic semantic properties include being ''meaningful'' or ''meaningless'' – for example, whether a given word is part of a language's lexicon with a generally understood meaning; ''[[polysemy]]'', having multiple, typically related, meanings; ''[[ambiguity]]'', having meanings which aren't necessarily related ; and ''anomaly'', where the elements of a unit are semantically incompatible with each other, although possibly grammatically sound. Beyond the expression itself, there are higher-level '''semantic relations''' that describe the relationship between units: these include [[synonym]]y, [[antonym]]y, and [[hyponymy]].&lt;ref&gt;Akmajian, Adrian; Richard A. Demers, Ann K. Farmer, Robert M. Harnish (2001). ''Linguistics: An Introduction to Language and Communication''. MIT Press. {{ISBN|0-262-51123-1}}. pp. 237–241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Small, Steven Lawrence; Cottrell, Garrison Weeks &amp; Tanenhaus, Michael K. (1988).

Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-78067-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-78067-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides basic properties of semantics, semantic property is also sometimes used to describe the semantic components of a word, such as ''man'' assuming that the referent is ''human'', ''male'', and ''adult'', or ''female'' being a common component of ''girl'', ''woman'', and ''actress''. In this sense, semantic properties are used to define the [[semantic field]] of a word or set of words.&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, Laurel J. (2000). ''The structure of modern English: a linguistic introduction''. Illustrated edition. John Benjamins Publishing Company. {{ISBN|9027225672}}, 9789027225672. p.112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leech, Geoffrey (1974). ''Semantics''. Pelican Books. {{ISBN|0-14-021694-4}}. pp. 96-102&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semantic Properties of Nouns==

Semantic properties of nouns/entities can be divided into eight classes: [[specificity (linguistics)|specificity]], [[boundedness (linguistics)|boundedness]], [[animacy]], [[grammatical gender|gender]], [[kinship terminology|kinship]], [[honorific|social status]], physical properties, and function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frawley|first1=William|title=Linguistic Semantics|date=1992|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Physical properties''' refer to how an entity exists in space. It can include shape, size, and material, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frawley|first1=William|title=Linguistic Semantics|date=1992|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''function''' class of semantic properties refers to noun class markers that indicate the purpose of an entity or how humans utilize an entity. 
For example, in the Dyirbal language, the morpheme ''balam'' marks each entity in its noun class with the semantic property of edibility,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lakoff|first1=George|title=Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things|date=1987|publisher=University of Chicago|location=Chicago|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Burmese encodes the semantic property for the ability to cut or pierce. Encoding the functional property for transportation, housing, and speech are also attested in world languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frawley|first1=William|title=Linguistic Semantics|date=1992|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Syntheist Movement sees itself as the practical realisation of a philosophical ambition for a new religion dating back as far as [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s [[Spinoza's God|pantheism]] in the 17th century and, most directly, British-American philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s pioneering work towards a [[process theology]] in his books ''Religion in the Making'' in 1926 and ''[[Process and Reality]]'' in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, A.N. (1926). ''Religion in the Making'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, A.N. (1929). ''Process and Reality. An Essay in Cosmology. Gifford Lectures Delivered in the University of Edinburgh During the Session 1927–1928'', Macmillan, New York, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

Syntheism may also be viewed as a response to the lack of atheistic and pantheistic belief systems in Western cultures, while being more abundant in Eastern cultures, for example as [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]], [[Dzogchen|Dzogchen Buddhism]], [[Advaita Vedanta]] Hinduism, [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Jainism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hegel|first1=G.W.F.|title=Aesthetics: Lectures on Fine Art, Vol. I|date=1998|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0198238164|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Syntheism logo.jpg|thumb|Logo used by The Syntheist Movement, describing the Universe as an ellipse over the circle of the primordial void]]

== Etymology ==
Syntheism comes from the [[Greek_language|Greek]] ''syntheos'' (from syn- for ''with'' or ''creating with'' and -theos for ''god''). It implies that the proper approach to the concept of God is that humanity has created, creates or will eventually create [[God]] – as opposed to the traditional [[monotheism|monotheistic]] view that God created the world and humanity.

Besides the activism of The Syntheist Movement, a syntheistic approach to philosophy and religion has also been advocated by American philosopher [[Ray Kurzweil]] in his concept of the forthcoming [[Singularitarianism|Singularity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurzweil|first1=Ray|title=[[The Age of Spiritual Machines|The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence]]|date=1999|publisher=Viking|isbn=978-0965086134}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also supported by French philosopher [[Quentin Meillassoux]] in his idea of "God is a concept far too important to leave to the religious" in his book ''After Finitude''.&lt;ref&gt;Meillassoux, Quentin (2006). ''Après la finitude. Essai sur la nécessité de la contingence'', Paris, Seuil, coll. L'ordre philosophique (foreword by Alain Badiou).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable works ==
As early as 1982, [[Mikhail Epstein]], Russian–American critical thinker, produced  his "Manifesto of Minimal Religion" claiming that post–atheistic spirituality in the Soviet Union moves beyond all differences among traditional religions and establishes a new type of spirituality, principally non–dogmatic and unorganized, aspiring for the God in the future rather than in the past tense. &lt;ref&gt; Jonathan Sutton. 'Minimal Religion' and Mikhail Epstein's Interpretation of Religion in Late-Soviet and Post-Soviet Russia. Studies in East European Thought. June 2006.  Vol. 58, No. 2, https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11212-005-4625-7; Ian Fraser. Charles Taylor, Mikhail Epstein and ‘minimal religion’. International Journal for Philosophy of Religion https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11153-015-9508-3 &lt;/ref&gt;

American theoretical biologist and complexity theorist [[Stuart Kauffman]] published a syntheist manifesto called ''Reinventing The Sacred'' in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kauffman|first1=Stuart|title=Reinventing the Sacred: A New View of Science, Reason, and Religion|date=2008|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0-465-00300-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he calls for an [[emergentism]] beyond traditional scientific [[reductionism]] towards a new syntheist spirituality. American philosopher and neuroscientist [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] published ''[[Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion]]'' in 2014. In this book, Harris promotes a syntheistic, post-atheist spirituality beyond traditional religion, especially beyond the Abrahamic faiths, inspired by [[Buddhism]] and the Indian philosophical school of [[Advaita Vedanta]]. Harris advocates the search for a love and happiness that [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcends]] cause and effect - which he claims to have found in deep [[meditation]] and during [[Psychedelic experience|psychedelic experiences]] - while entirely set within a [[Non-duality|monist]] and [[Immanence|immanent]] universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Sam|title=Waking Up|date=2014|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1451636017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Kauffman and Harris are widely quoted as inspirations for the foundation of The Syntheist Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Demarchi|first1=Dino|title=A few words about Baruch Spinoza’s philosophy|url=http://syntheism.org/index.php/2015/01/a-few-words-about-baruch-spinozas-philosophy/|website=http://syntheism.org|accessdate=27 January 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127162408/http://syntheism.org/index.php/2015/01/a-few-words-about-baruch-spinozas-philosophy/|archivedate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American philosopher and theologian [[Robert Corrington]] has advocated a syntheistic approach he refers to as ''ecstatic naturalism'' to religion and spirituality in a series of books, including ''Nature's Sublime: An Essay in Aesthetic Naturalism'', ''Nature and Spirit: An Essay in Ecstatic Naturalism'' and ''A Semiotic Theory of Theology and Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corrington|first1=Robert S.|title=Nature's Sublime: An Essay in Aesthetic Naturalism|date=2013|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0739182130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corrington|first1=Robert S.|title=Nature and Spirit: An Essay in Ecstatic Naturalism|date=1992|publisher=Fordham University Press|isbn=978-0823213634}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corrington|first1=Robert S.|title=A Semiotic Theory of Theology and Philosophy|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521093248}}&lt;/ref&gt; British political philosopher [[Simon Critchley]] calls for syntheist subtraction (a position he refers to as ''mystical anarchism'') as the proper response to the call for a revolutionary radicality in his book ''The Faith of The Faithless: Experiments in Political Theology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Critchley|first1=Simon|title=The Faith of the Faithless: Experiments in Political Theology|date=2012|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1844677375}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Swedish cyberphilosophers [[Alexander Bard]] and [[Jan Söderqvist]] published their syntheist manifesto [http://www.bokus.com/bok/9789175471839/syntheism-creating-god-in-the-internet-age/ ''Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age''] in October 2014, it became the first book to actively use the term Syntheism in its title. Bard &amp; Söderqvist frequently quote Kauffman, Harris, Corrington and Critchley in the book, but also find inspiration for a syntheist worldview from a variety of contemporary phenomena such as [[digitalisation]], [[globalisation]], [[participatory culture]], [[Psychedelia|psychedelic practices]], [[quantum physics]] and the science of [[cosmology]].&lt;ref name=Piesing2014&gt;{{Citation

Swiss-British philosopher [[Alain de Botton]] has advocated a syntheistic approach towards an atheist religion both in his book ''Religion for Atheists''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Botton|first1=Alain|title=Religion for Atheists: A Non-believer's Guide to the Uses of Religion|date=2013|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0307476821}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his TED talk ''Atheism 2.0''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Botton|first1=Alain|title=Atheism 2.0|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_atheism_2_0|website=http://www.ted.com|publisher=TED Talks|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; American philosopher Daniel Colucciello Barber explores the potential for a syntheistic, post-secular spirituality of immanence rather than transcendence, inspired by French philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]], in his book ''Deleuze and the Naming of God''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barber|first1=Daniel Colucciello|title=Deleuze and the Naming of God|date=2013|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0748686360}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most quoted inspirations for Syntheism are the writings on a future ''atheology'' by French surrealist philosopher [[Georges Bataille]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Piesing2014 /&gt;

== Beliefs ==
Syntheism is the belief that the classic division between theism and atheism in [[theology]] has become redundant and must be overcome to fulfill contemporary and future spiritual needs. This requires the acknowledgement that all metaphysical beliefs center on a divinity or focal point which is man-made. Therefore, all current and future religious beliefs are created by humans, as well as systems such as [[Individualism]] developed by philosophers like [[René Descartes]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bard, Alexander|author2=Söderqvist, Jan|title=Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age|date=2014|publisher=Stockholm Text|isbn=978-9175471839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being human creations, what is important is that these beliefs strengthen, and not contradict, science. They must therefore be developed within a [[Monism|monist]] worldview (the conviction that there is one world and one world only, and that everything within this one world can affect everything else). In a more poetic vein, Bataille describes his atheology as “the art of non-knowledge”. He rather advocates a syntheist religion without a core set of beliefs.&lt;ref name=Paulas2014 /&gt; Participatory festivals with [[Utopianism|utopian]] themes such as [[Burning Man]] are considered examples of syntheistic practice.&lt;ref name=Mattocks2014 /&gt;

{{Quotation|To me, the name “God” is an amazing name for all the dreams of humanity projected into one point. What would you name that? You would name it God. And that is what we need to do, to retake the “God” word but just give God proper qualities that we can actually believe in. In that case, Syntheos is the God that we choose to believe in and can believe in. Whatever that means.|Alexander Bard|Alexander Bard on Syntheism: Death, God, the Universe, and Burning Man|The Forumist&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== Criticisms ==
Lack of central leadership and core beliefs have led some scholars, such as Dr. Stephen O'Leary, to believe Syntheism will fail. The idea has also been criticised for a potential lack of mystery.&lt;ref name=Paulas2014 /&gt;

'''Tang Chun-I''' ({{zh|c=唐君毅}}, 17 January 1909 &amp;ndash; 2 February 1978) was a [[Chinese philosopher]], who was one of the leading exponents of [[New Confucianism]]. He was influenced by [[Plato]] and [[Hegel]] as well as by earlier [[Confucian]] thought.

Born in mainland China, graduated from philosophy department of [[National Central University]] ([[Nanjing University]]), Tang went into exile in [[Hong Kong]] in 1949, after the declaration of the [[People's Republic of China]], living there for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There he helped found the [[New Asia College]], which was integrated into the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] in 1963. He served as the founding chairman and the first Chair Professor of the Department of Philosophy of CUHK. 

His work has mainly been influential in Hong Kong, [[Taiwan]] and the [[United States]]. In 2009, a 2-metre bronze statue was erected in the New Asia College campus to celebrate his centenary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = CUHK Celebrates the 60th Anniversary of Philosophy Department and Centenary of Professor Tang Chun-I | publisher = Chinese University of Hong Kong  | year = 2009  | url = http://cpr.cuhk.edu.hk/en/press_detail.php?id=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transtheism''' is a term coined by either philosopher [[Paul Tillich]] or [[Indology|Indologist]] [[Heinrich Zimmer]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;In published writings, the term appears in 1952 for Tillich and in 1953 for Zimmer. Since the two men were personally acquainted, it is difficult to say which of them coined the term. Note that the term ''transtheism'' is avoided by both.&lt;/ref&gt; referring to a system of thought or [[religious philosophy]] which is neither [[theism|theistic]], nor [[atheism|atheistic]], but is beyond them.

Zimmer applies the term to the theological system of [[Jainism]], which is theistic in the limited sense that the gods exist, but become irrelevant as they are transcended by ''[[moksa (Jainism)|moksha]]'' (that is, a system which is not [[non-theistic]], but in which the gods are not the highest spiritual instance). Zimmer (1953, p.&amp;nbsp;182) uses the term to describe the position of the [[Tirthankara]]s having passed "beyond the godly governors of the natural order".

The term has more recently also been applied to [[Buddhism]],&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Rigopoulos, The Life and Teachings of Sai Baba of Shirdi (1993), p. 372; J. L. (Ed) Houlden, Jesus: The Complete Guide (2005), p. 390&lt;/ref&gt; [[Advaita Vedanta]]&lt;ref&gt;Steven T. Katz, Mysticism and Sacred Scripture, Oxford University Press (2000), p. 177 ; Pulasth Soobah. Roodurmun, Kanshi Ram, Bhāmatī and Vivaraṇa Schools of Advaita Vedānta, Motilal Banarsidass (2002), p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bhakti]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Karel, Love Divine: Studies in Bhakti and Devotional Mysticism (1993), p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Nathan Katz in ''Buddhist and Western Philosophy'' (1981, p.&amp;nbsp;446) points out that the term "transpolytheistic" would be more accurate, since it entails that the polytheistic [[deity|gods]] are not denied or rejected even after the development of a notion of the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] that transcends them, but criticizes the classification as characterizing the mainstream by the periphery: "like categorizing Roman Catholicism as a good example of non-[[Nestorianism]]". The term is indeed informed by the fact that the corresponding development in the West, the development of [[monotheism]], did not "transcend" polytheism, but abolish it, while in the mainstream of the [[Indian religions]], the notion of "gods" ([[deva (Hinduism)|deva]]) was never elevated to the status of "God" or [[Ishvara]], or the impersonal Absolute [[Brahman]], but adopted roles comparable to Western [[angel]]s. "Transtheism", according to the criticism of Katz, is then an artifact of [[comparative religion]].

[[Paul Tillich]] uses ''transtheistic'' in ''The Courage to Be'' (1952), as an aspect of [[Stoicism]]. Tillich stated that Stoicism and [[Neo-Stoicism]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;are the way in which some of the noblest figures in later antiquity and their followers in modern times have answered the problem of existence and conquered the anxieties of fate and death. Stoicism in this sense is a basic religious attitude, whether it appears in theistic, atheistic, or transtheistic forms.&lt;ref&gt;''Writings on Religion'', Walter de Gruyter (1988), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Like Zimmer trying to express a religious notion that  is neither theistic nor atheistic. However, the theism that is being transcended in Stoicism according to Tillich is not polytheism as in Jainism, but [[monotheism]], pursuing an ideal of human [[courage]] which has emancipated itself from God.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The courage to take meaninglessness into itself presupposes a relation to the ground of being which we have called "absolute faith." It is without a special content, yet it is not without content. The content of absolute faith is the "god above God." Absolute faith and its consequence, the courage that takes the radical doubt, the doubt about God, into itself, transcends the theistic idea of God.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Tillich. Theism Transcended (Yale: CT 1952) 185-190, in the Courage to Be, in the Essential Tillich: an anthology of the writings of Paul Tillich, ed. F. Forrester Church (Macmillan: NY 1987) 187-190&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Martin Buber]] criticized Tillich's "transtheistic position" as a reduction of God to the impersonal "necessary being" of [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David |last= Novak |author-link = David Novak |title= Buber and Tillich | journal= Journal of Ecumenical Studies | volume=29 | number=2 | date= Spring 1992 | pages= 159–74 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xnXMiBAXVZkC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1dCPvQYkYj&amp;sig=zQOeKFy9pcqBhUyemnT98NYrDhc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MfKzUebyJsrP0wHRnIGwBQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=transtheistic%20position&amp;f=false}} &lt;br /&gt; As reprinted in: {{citation | title= Talking With Christians: Musings of A Jewish Theologian| year= 2005 | publisher= Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing |first=David |last= Novak |page = 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Buddhism as transtheistic ==
Following the term coined by the philosophers Tillich and Zimmer, Buddhism can be regarded as a transtheistic religion&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. This can be evident by the transcendence of the state of [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nibbana]] (Nirvana) that surpasses all the realms of existence, including the planes of [[Deva (Buddhism)|devas]] and [[Brahmā (Buddhism)|brahmas]] who are considered gods in [[Buddhist cosmology]]. The historical Buddha made it clear that the path to enlightenment does not depend on a god or gods. Although there is acknowledgment of a multitude of gods in the oldest Buddhist scriptures, there is also reference to Maha Brahma, who considered himself to be the all-powerful all-creator god, only to be critiqued by the Buddha as having wrongly perceived his plane of existence as the highest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jootla/wheel414.html|title=Teacher of the Devas|website=www.accesstoinsight.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vernon Philip White''' (born 1953) is an [[English people|English]] [[Church of England|Anglican]] [[Priest#Anglican or Episcopalian|priest]] and theological scholar.

==Biography==
White was born in [[South London|south-east London]] in 1953 and attended [[Eltham College]]. After leaving school he spent a year undertaking [[Voluntary Service Overseas]] in [[Africa]]. He was educated at [[Clare College, Cambridge]] (graduating [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in English and Theology 1975, [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] 1979) and [[Oriel College, Oxford]] ([[Master of Letters|MLitt]] 1980). He prepared for ordination at [[Wycliffe Hall, Oxford]]. He was ordained deacon in 1977 and priest in 1978 in the [[Church of England]]. He was a tutor in doctrine and ethics at Wycliffe Hall from 1977 to 1983, then Chaplain and Lecturer at the [[University of Exeter]] from 1983 to 1987. He then became jointly Director of Ordinands for the [[Diocese of Guildford]] and Rector of [[Wotton, Surrey|Wotton]] and [[Holmbury St Mary]] in [[Surrey]] (1987–93). From 1993 until 2001 he was [[Canon (priest)#Secular canons|Canon Chancellor]] of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] and also a special lecturer at the [[University of Nottingham]], becoming Principal of the [[STETS|Southern Theological Education and Training Scheme]] in 2001 and Canon Theologian of [[Winchester Cathedral]] in 2006.  In 2011 he was appointed Canon Theologian at [[Westminster Abbey]] and Visiting Professor in the Department of Theology and Religious Studies at [[King's College London|King's College, London]]. In March 2018 it was announced that White was to step down from his role in the Abbey to focus more on writing.

==Impact==
White's book ''Atonement and Incarnation: an essay in universalism and particularity'' was studied in [[Eamonn Mulcahy]]'s ''The Cause of Our Salvation: Soteriological Causality according to some Modern British Theologians, 1988-98'' (Tesi Gregoriana Serie Teologia 140, Rome: Editrice Pontificia Università Gregoriana, 2007), alongside [[Paul Fiddes]], ''The Creative Suffering of God'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1988), [[Colin Gunton]], ''The Actuality of Atonement: a Study of Metaphor, Rationality and the Christian Tradition '' (Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 1988), and [[John McIntyre (theologian)|John McIntyre]], ''The Shape of Soteriology: Studies in the Doctrine of the Death of Christ'' (Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 1992).

'''William Klaas Frankena''' (June 21, 1908 – October 22, 1994) was an American [[moral philosopher]]. He was a member of the [[University of Michigan]]'s department of philosophy for 41 years (1937–1978), and chair of the department for 14 years (1947–1961).

==Life==
Frankena's father and mother immigrated to the U.S. as teenagers, in 1892 and 1896 respectively, from [[Friesland]], a province in the north of the [[Netherlands]]. William Frankena was the middle of three children. He was born in [[Manhattan, Montana]], grew up in small Dutch communities in Montana and western Michigan, and spoke [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]].  In primary school, his given name, Wiebe, was Anglicized to William. Throughout his life, his family and friends called him Bill. His mother died when he was nine years old. He graduated from Holland Christian High School in [[Holland, MI]], in 1926. After farming, his father, Nicholas A. Frankena (1875–1955), devoted the later decades of his life to elected office in [[Zeeland, MI]], where he was mayor, and to service as an elder in the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America]], which was founded by Calvinist Dutch immigrants.

In 1930, Frankena received a B.A. with majors in English and philosophy from [[Calvin College]], a liberal arts college of the Christian Reformed Church. At Calvin, Frankena studied with [[William Harry Jellema]] (1893–1982). Frankena then earned an M.A. from the [[University of Michigan]] (1931), where the Department of Philosophy included [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3129489 C. Harold Langford](1895–1964), [[Dewitt H. Parker]] (1885–1949), and [[Roy Wood Sellars]] (1880–1973). Next Frankena earned a second M.A. and a Ph.D. (1937) at [[Harvard University]]. He studied with [[C. I. Lewis]], [[Ralph Barton Perry]], and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] at Harvard, and with [[G. E. Moore]] and [[C. D. Broad]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] in England while he did Ph.D. research. His doctoral dissertation, which focused on Moore's work, was entitled "Recent Intuitionism in British Ethics." Frankena became well known in the profession with his first published paper, "The Naturalistic Fallacy," [http://mind.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/XLVIII/192/464 ''Mind''], 1939. During World War II, Frankena taught American history at the University of Michigan.

Frankena met his future wife, Sadie, when they were students at Calvin College. In 1928–29, Sadie was president of Calvin's forensic (oration and debate) club and editor-in-chief of Calvin's literary review, ''Chimes''; Frankena was business manager of the club and associate editor of the review. (''Prism'', Calvin College, 1929) He and Sadie were married for 44 years, until Sadie's death in 1978. He was an avid birder, and is survived by two sons, four grandchildren, and four great grandchildren.

Many Michigan undergraduates were introduced to philosophy in the popular, historically-based course taught by Frankena and his close friend Paul Henle. For nearly his entire career, Frankena did most of his philosophical reading and writing at home at a [http://www.earlyofficemuseum.com/IMagesWWW/Office_Museum_Curators_Desk_1860-1880_OM.jpg desk made circa 1870]. When he wrote a philosophical paper, he prepared a detailed outline, including very abbreviated versions of all points and cites, before writing the paper longhand using a mechanical pencil. He never used a typewriter or computer. Frankena greatly valued his many conversations with other moral philosophers throughout the U.S. and western Europe. William K. Frankena's philosophical papers are in the collection of the [[Bentley Historical Library]] at the University of Michigan. His philosophy books are in the collection of the [http://141.211.177.75/philosophy/grads/prospective_students/facilities/ Tanner Philosophy Library] in Angell Hall at the University of Michigan.

==Professional service and recognition==
While he was chair of the Michigan Philosophy Department, Frankena devoted a considerable portion of his time to service to the university and the philosophy profession, and became known for his role in defending academic freedom during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy era]].&lt;ref name="darwall97"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0014-1704(199707)107%3A4%3C685%3ALFFAPR%3E2.0.CO%3B2-6 S. Darwall, "Learning from Frankena: A Philosophical Remembrance]," ''Ethics'', 1997, pp. 685-705.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unamerican"&gt;[http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1998/feb/02-26-98/news/news1.html ''The Michigan Daily''], February 26, 1998, regarding the firing of University of Michigan professors for refusing to testify before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Un-American Activities based on their rights under the U.S. Constitution. The article states that University President Harlan H. "Hatcher brought three University professors in front of the House Subcommittee on un-American Activities. After the hearings, Hatcher issued a statement that called for the immediate suspension of the three instructors 'without loss of pay from all duties and connections to the University.' Two of the professors later were fired. Several members of the University community felt Hatcher's handling of the situation was weak."

After that period, he had more time to publish books and articles. During his career Frankena was chair of the Board of Officers of the [[American Philosophical Association]] (APA), chair of the Council for Philosophical Studies, president of the APA's Western Division, a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and of the National Academy of Education, and a recipient of a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], a Fellowship from the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]], a [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] Senior Fellowship, and a [[Rockefeller Fellowship]]. Frankena was also active on [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]] committees. In 1974, he delivered the APA's prestigious [[Paul Carus Lectures]] on "Three Questions about Morality." Calvin College named him a Distinguished Alumnus in 1984. Frankena received the University of Michigan's Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award, was [[Roy Wood Sellars]] Distinguished Collegiate Professor of Philosophy, and was the first [http://www.lsa.umich.edu/lsa/home/ College of Literature, Science, and the Arts] Distinguished Senior Faculty Lecturer.

==Legacy==
A memorial essay by a member of the Michigan Philosophy Department states that "William Frankena contributed as widely to [[moral philosophy]] and its neighboring areas as anyone in that remarkable group that dominated English-speaking [[ethics]] from the end of World War II well into the 1980s. From [[metaethics]], the history of ethics, and normative ethical theory, to moral education, moral psychology, and applied ethics, to religious ethics and the [[philosophy of education]], the sweep and quality of his ethical philosophizing was simply extraordinary."&lt;ref name="darwall97" /&gt; When Frankena retired and was awarded emeritus status in 1978, the University Regents stated that "he is renowned for his learning in the history of ethics, a subject about which he is generally believed in the profession to know more than anyone else in the world."&lt;ref name="darwall97" /&gt; The July 1981 issue of ''[[The Monist]]'' is devoted to "The Philosophy of William Frankena."&lt;ref name="monist"&gt;"The Philosophy of William K. Frankena," ''The Monist'', July 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

The University has created a chair for the "[[Carl G. Hempel]] &amp; William K. Frankena Distinguished University Professor," and annually awards the [http://www.lsa.umich.edu/philosophy/undergrads/prizes/frankena/ William K Frankena Prize] for excellence in philosophy to an undergraduate student.
