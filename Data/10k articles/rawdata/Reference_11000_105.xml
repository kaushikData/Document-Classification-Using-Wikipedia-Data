'''The 20th Century’s Greatest Hits: 100 English-Language Books of Fiction''' is a popular "best of" list compiled by [[Larry McCaffery]] largely in response to the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels]] list (1999), which McCaffery considered out of touch with 20th-century fiction.  McCaffery wrote that he saw his list "as a means of sharing with readers my own views about what books are going to be read 100 or 1000 years from now".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spinelessbooks.com/mccaffery/100/index.html Top 100 List] with comments at Spineless Books' Larry McCaffery archive&lt;/ref&gt; The list includes many books not included in the [http://www.modernlibrary.com/top-100/100-best-novels/ Modern Library] list, including five of his top ten, [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'', [[Robert Coover]]'s ''[[The Public Burning]]'', [[Samuel Beckett]]’s ''Trilogy'' (''[[Molloy (novel)|Molloy]]'', ''[[Malone Dies]]'' and ''[[The Unnamable (novel)|The Unnamable]]''), [[Gertrude Stein]]’s ''[[The Making of Americans]]'', and [[William S. Burroughs|William S. Burrough]]'s ''[[The Nova Trilogy]]''.  

Topping the list is Vladimir Nabokov's 1962 novel ''[[Pale Fire]]'', which McCaffery called the "most audaciously conceived novel of the century." Not counting the tetralogies of [[Rikki Ducornet]] (#35) and [[Gene Wolfe]] (#78), the most cited author is [[James Joyce]], whose four works, ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (#2), ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' (#10), ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' (#21), and ''[[Dubliners]]'' (#63), all made the list.  [[Robert Coover]] and [[William H. Gass]] each have three works on the list, while [[Samuel Delany]], [[Don DeLillo]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Raymond Federman]], [[William Gaddis]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], and [[William Vollmann]] have two apiece.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.litline.org/ABR/Issues/Volume20/Issue6/abr100.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2935">"'''Against a Dwarf'''" (Old English: ''Ƿið Dƿeorh'') is an [[Anglo-Saxon Metrical Charms|Anglo-Saxon metrical charm]] found in the [[Lacnunga]]. It requires writing the names of the [[Seven Sleepers]] onto seven wafers, then singing an alliterative verse three times. The verse is written in half lines and was used for its assumed curative properties, although what the charm is supposed to be curing is still a matter of debate.

==Possible meanings==
Some scholars believe that the charm was supposed to help victims sleep more easily if they were suffering from a disease that caused convulsions. 

Another theory is that the [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarf]], a being from [[Anglo-Saxon mythology]], might originally have been a [[night demon]] of some kind. The night demon, according to this theory, could possibly have been the personification of the illness.

Most theories that speculate that the dwarf represents some kind of disease usually think that the disease is related to sleeping because of the inclusion of the [[Seven Sleepers]] in the charm. According to one source, "The names of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus occur in various charms of the Middle Ages. They are usually, to secure sleep, but in some cases are to be employed against fever".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Schmidt |first=Claire (thesis) |author-link= |title=Sleeping Toward Christianity: The Form and Function of the Seven Sleepers Legend in Medieval British Oral Tradition| location=University of Missouri-Columbia |pages= |date=May 2008 |url=https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10355/5645/research.pdf?sequence=3 |jstor= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthew Lewis also believes that the charm is related to helping someone who is having trouble sleeping, and he believes that knowing the origin of the word [[nightmare]] is key to understanding the charm. Although the etymology of nightmare is somewhat disputed, the word can possibly be translated as meaning "night monster." According to Lewis, the dwarf in this charm is a manifestation of a night monster, as dwarfs were linked to the idea of evil spirits and thought to be capable of causing physical harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lewis |first=Matthew C.

'''Al-Khadra Mosque''' ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;مسجد الخضرة&lt;/big&gt;}}, transliteration: ''Masjid al-Khadra'', translation: "the Green Mosque") also known as '''Hizn Sidna Yaq'ub Mosque''' (trans. ''Sadness of our Lord Jacob'') is a [[mosque]] situated on the lower slopes of [[Mount Gerizim]] in the southwestern quarter of the Old City of [[Nablus]] in the [[West Bank]]. The mosque is rectangular in shape, and its [[minaret]] rises {{convert|30|m|ft|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="Pringle_a"&gt;Pringle, 1993, pp.112.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Khadra Mosque Minaret.jpg|thumb|left|Minaret of al-Khadra Mosque, early 20th century]]

According to [[Muslim]] tradition, the mosque is situated upon the site where [[Jacob]] wept after being shown [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]'s blood-soaked tunic which suggested that he had been mauled and killed; on the right of the courtyard is a small room said to be the place where Jacob sat down and wept.&lt;ref&gt;Feyerick (1996) p 148&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the mosque's alternative name "Sadness of our Lord Jacob".&lt;ref&gt;Luke, 1922, p.102.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Samaritan]] tradition, al-Khadra Mosque had been a [[synagogue]] destroyed by the Crusaders. They claim that its [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name ''al-Khadra'' ("the Green") derived from the Samaritan ''Mahallat Khadra'' ("the place of the Green").&lt;ref name="Pringle2"/&gt; Archaeologist Michael Avi-Yonah identified the Khadra Mosque with the synagogue built by the Samaritan high priest Akbon in 362 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Avi-Yonah, Michael. [http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/discussion/035discuss.html Discussion: Mount Ephraim and Benjamin, 35. Neapolis - (Nablus)] Studium Biblicum Franciscum - Jerusalem. 2000-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The synagogue was rebuilt in 1137 by Ab Giluga, a Samaritan from [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. Several Western scholars, however, believe, because of examples of [[Gothic architecture]] in portions of the present-day mosque, that in the 1170s, there stood a [[Crusade]]r church and bell tower.&lt;ref name="Pringle2"&gt;Pringle, 1993, p.111&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arab]] geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] records in 1225, while Nablus was under [[Ayyubid]] rule, the buildings was restored to become a Samaritan synagogue, which he referred to as "a large mosque" which the Samaritans venerated.&lt;ref&gt;al-Hamawi quoted in le Strange, 1890, p. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/512/mode/1up 512]&lt;/ref&gt; It is probably from this era that the Samaritan inscriptions on a minaret wall were made.&lt;ref&gt;Herbermann, 1913, p.417&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1242, however, the [[Knights Templars]] damaged the building, which was later destroyed in 1260 by the [[Mongols]].&lt;ref&gt;Pringle, 1993, pp.112-113.&lt;/ref&gt; It was transformed as a mosque in 1290 by the Mamluks during the reign of [[Qalawun|Sultan Qalawun]] as attested to by a foundation inscription.&lt;ref&gt;Dumper, Stanley and Abu-Lughod (2007) p 266&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the structure resembles Mamluk architecture and a ''[[mihrab]]'' was added to the mosque.&lt;ref name="Pringle_a" /&gt;

===Second Intifada===
According to the Palestinian government and [[Gush Shalom]], during the [[Second Intifada]] in the [[Battle of Nablus]] in 2002, [[Israel]]i bulldozers destroyed 85% of the mosque, including the Mamluk-era ''mihrab''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gush-shalom.org/terror/report1.html#nablus Report on the Destruction to Palestinian Institutions in Nablus and Other Cities (Except Ramallah) Caused by IDF Forces Between March 29 and April 21, 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021023418/http://gush-shalom.org/terror/report1.html |date=October 21, 2008 }} [[Gush Shalom]]. 2002-04-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/020813/2002081323.html Destruction of Nablus Old City, a war crime, Palestinian minister] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214180945/http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/020813/2002081323.html |date=2012-02-14 }} Arabic News. 2002-08-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gresh (2004) p 171&lt;/ref&gt; The current imam of al-Khadra Mosque, Maher Kharaz (the 'White Lion'), was removed from his position in a Palestinian Authority 'crack down' on militant imams in 1996, but was reinstated in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/876629.html Ha'aretz] 30 June 2007 Hamas preacher defies PA gov't ban on incitement in mosques By The Associated Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1189411466025 Jpost]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 23 September 2007 Palestinian forces arrest prominent Hamas preacher&lt;/ref&gt; Kharaz, a [[Hamas]] member and opponent of [[Fatah]], regularly defied the Fatah-led [[Palestinian National Authority]] during his weekly Friday sermons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/06/29/africa/ME-GEN-Israel-Palestinians.php Hamas preacher defies government order to stop talking politics in mosques] [[International Herald Tribune]] and [[Associated Press]]. 2007-06-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Kharaz was arrested on September 23, 2007 in another Fatah-led 'crack down' on Hamas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003986679_palestinians01.html?syndication=rss Seattle Times] 1 November 2007 Abbas takes textbook approach to security By Karin Laub The Associated Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/02/israel.comment Guardian] 2 November 2007 Fatah targets mosques in latest anti-Hamas campaign&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/eed216406b50bf6485256ce10072f637/ac3bdabe6291fa2e8525737700711543!OpenDocument UN Doc] Chronological Review of Events Relating to the Question of Palestine, Monthly media monitoring review September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albanisation of names''' or '''Lexical cleansing'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lexical cleansing: Slavic toponyms in Albania (or out of?)|url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Regions-and-countries/Albania/Lexical-cleansing-Slavic-toponyms-in-Albania-or-out-of-47472|publisher=[[Osservatorio Balcani e Caucaso]]|accessdate=16 December 2013|author=Marjola Rukaj|year=2009|quote=Lexical cleansing}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is [[albanisation]] of non-Albanian personal names and toponyms in [[Albania]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Western Macedonia]].

Right after the Second World War Albanian communist authorities required the substantial Greek population in the southern Albania and other non-Albanians to Albanize their names. In 1966 the [[Albanian Communist Party]] issued a decree aimed to [[Ethnic cleansing|wipe out]] "traces of the non-Albanian population" in places where significant Slavic minorities still lived. In 1968 one of the demands of Albanian nationalistic demonstration on Kosovo was to remove Serbian Orthodox name Metohija from the name of the province. In 1975 the Albanian Communist Party issued a decree on the Albanization of all place-names and personal names which ordered citizens to give "modern revolutionary (Illyrian) names" to their children, while non-Albanian toponyms or ones that had religious connotations all over the country were Albanized to better suit the "state ideology".

After the [[Kosovo War]] and the entrance of the [[NATO]] forces to [[Kosovo]] in June 1999 a sweeping Albanization of place-names, organizations, street-names and business took place. In 2005 a special envoy of UN Secretary-General, issued a report submitted to the UN Security Council inviting the Kosovo Albanian leaders to react and bring a halt to the attempts to rewrite the history through "albanization". The politicians in contemporary Albania continued to support the politics of Albanization, particularly Albanization of Slavic toponyms.

== In Albania ==

When the region of [[Malësi e Madhe District|Malësi e Madhe]] became territory of newly established Albania after the [[Balkan Wars]], most of Serbian language toponyms were Albanized. Nevetheless, in 1924 [[Mary Edith Durham|Edit Durham]] reported that Serbian toponyms still existed scattered across Malësi e Madhe.&lt;ref name="Durham1928"&gt;{{cite book|last=Durham|first=Mary Edith|authorlink=Mary Edith Durham|title=Some Tribal Origins, Laws and Customs of the Balkans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dSSBAAAAMAAJ|year=1928|publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the [[Second World War]] substantial [[Greeks|Greek]] population in the southern Albania and other people of non-Albanian ethnicity were required to Albanize their names.&lt;ref name="Makariev2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Veikou|first=Mariangela|editor=Plamen Makariev|title=Islamic and Christian Cultures: Conflict Or Dialogue|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=94gQNPpoxJIC&amp;pg=PA159|accessdate=16 December 2013|date=1 January 2001|publisher=CRVP|isbn=978-1-56518-162-5|page=159|quote=For instance, soon the minority members were all required to Albanize their names; a list of approved names was provided in a booklet distributed to every household by the state.

Tzachristos argues that Christian names were overwhelmingly affected while on the other hand, the use of several Muslim names was allowed in spite their religious connotations.&lt;ref name=Vaios/&gt; However, French anthropologist Gilles de Rapper states that according to some observations the religious names survived better among Christians than among Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.drustvo-antropologov.si/AN/PDF/2008_2/Anthropological_Notebooks_XIV_2_De_Rapper.pdf|title=Religion in post-communist Albania: Muslims, Christians and the idea of ’culture’ in Devoll, southern Albania|author=Gilles de Rapper|date=7 October 2008|accessdate=2 October 2017|magazine= Anthropological Notebooks , Slovenian Anthropological Society|issue=2|volume=14|pages=31-45}}. Page 42: "Finally, other observations seem to support the idea of the relatively privileged position of Christians during communism: for instance, and as far as I could determine, the destruction of places of cult in 1967 and afterwards seems to have been more systematic in the case of Muslim places, while Christian places (although closed as cult places and dedicated to secular usage) have more often been spared as ‘cultural monuments’ [41] (monument kulture). Also, as far as I could determine, religious first names, formally forbidden in 1976, seem to have survived better among Christians than among Muslims. They seem to have reappeared more easily after 1990, for newborn children as well as for children and adults who got baptised when religious practices were authorised again. Muslim names, on the contrary, do not seem to have regained favour. "&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the same decree geographical name changes occurred all over the country in cases of non-Albanian toponyms or ones that had religious connotations.&lt;ref name=Stoppel/&gt; As a result, names of 13 settlements in Korçë and 6 in Sarandë regions were changed in order to be in agreement with the "state ideology".&lt;ref name=Vaios&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tzachristos |first1=Vaios Vasileiou|title=Η εκκλησιαστική πολιτική του Ενβέρ Χότζα και των επιγόνων του [The Ecclesiastical Policy of Enver Hoxha and of his Successors]|date=2013|publisher=University of Thessaloniki|location=Thessaloniki|page=103|url=http://ikee.lib.auth.gr/record/132386?ln=el|accessdate=2 October 2017|language=el}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the names of Greek and Roman archaeological sites were changed to "Illyrian".&lt;ref name=Stoppel&gt;{{citation|author1=Nußberger Angelika |author2=Wolfgang Stoppel |title=Minderheitenschutz im östlichen Europa (Albanien)|year=2001|journal=|volume=|publisher=Universität Köln|language=German|pages=|place=|url=http://www.uni-koeln.de/jur-fak/ostrecht/minderheitenschutz/Vortraege/Albanien/Albanien_Stoppel.pdf|location=p. 20:  "Teil diverser Albanisierungskampagnen war schließlich ... in "illyrische"  umbenannt."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ban of religious names had deleterious consequences on people of Greek ethnicity who traditionally give religious names to their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights in Post-Communist Albania|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/pdfs/a/albania/albania963.pdf|accessdate=16 December 2013|location=Helsinki|page=134|year=1996|quote=Since Greek minority culture is closely tied to the Orthodox Church, the  community did suffer disproportionately from the ban on religion and the  destruction of churches.

In case of substantial Serb community in northern Albania ([[Skadar]]), their family names had been Albanized during dictatorship of [[Enver Hoxha]].&lt;ref name="Ahrens2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahrens|first=Geert-Hinrich|title=Diplomacy on the Edge: Containment of Ethnic Conflict and the Minorities Working Group of the Conferences on Yugoslavia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b3fLRcHYSVAC&amp;pg=PA299|date=6 March 2007|publisher=Woodrow Wilson Center Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8557-0|page=299| quote=...their family names, which had been Albanized during the Hoxha dictatorship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The desire of the Greek minority's representatives to be able to use bilingual signposts and signs within municipalities is based on their need for recognition of Greek culture and, more importantly, a fear of its erosion. The December 2007 lawsuit against Omonoia President Vasil Bolano for replacing signs in Albanian with signs in Greek illustrates the issues surrounding toponymy and its symbolic meaning. The situation was the exact counterpoint to the measures of Albanisation of toponyms operated by the communist regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dorlhiac |first1=Renaud |title=La minorité grecque d’Albanie : survivance de l’hellénisme ou produit de la construction étatique albanaise ? |journal=Anatoli |date=1 October 2015 |issue=6 |pages=59–78 |doi=10.4000/anatoli.287 |url=https://journals.openedition.org/anatoli/287#bodyftn15 |accessdate=23 November 2018 |language=fr |issn=2111-4064 | quote= Le procès intenté au président d’Omonoia, Vasil Bolano, pour avoir remplacé dans sa commune d’Himara les panneaux de signalisation en albanais par des panneaux en grec, en décembre 2007, illustre les enjeux entourant la toponymie et révèle en outre un rapport symbolique très fort au terroir, creuset des traditions. Il est l’exact contrepoint des mesures d’albanisation des toponymes opérées par le régime communiste. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The politicians in contemporary Albania continued to support the politics of Albanization, particularly Albanization of Slavic toponyms. In 2009 Albanian president [[Bamir Topi]] and Prime Minister [[Sali Berisha]] proposed establishment of the commission for Albanization of Slavic toponomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lexical cleansing: Slavic toponyms in Albania (or out of?)|url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Regions-and-countries/Albania/Lexical-cleansing-Slavic-toponyms-in-Albania-or-out-of-47472|publisher=Osservatorio Balcani e Caucaso|accessdate=16 December 2013|author=Marjola Rukaj|year=2009|quote=Current president Bamir Topi first mentioned the idea during a routine visit to a village in the country's northeast.

Berisha, discussing the issue in one of his new government's first meetings, did not hesitate to take the idea further. "We have to create a commission to replace all the Slavic toponymy in the country with corresponding Albanian toponyms originating before the Slavic invasion," Berisha said.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berisha actually supports Albanization of not only Slavic toponyms but all placenames in Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lexical cleansing: Slavic toponyms in Albania (or out of?)|url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Regions-and-countries/Albania/Lexical-cleansing-Slavic-toponyms-in-Albania-or-out-of-47472|publisher=Osservatorio Balcani e Caucaso|accessdate=16 December 2013|author=Marjola Rukaj|year=2009|quote=In that sense, Berisha went even further with a proposal to "Albanize" all place names in the country.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of his proposal, there are no similarly strong attempts to Albanize Latin, Turkish or Greek place names for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lexical cleansing: Slavic toponyms in Albania (or out of?)|url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Regions-and-countries/Albania/Lexical-cleansing-Slavic-toponyms-in-Albania-or-out-of-47472|publisher=Osservatorio Balcani e Caucaso|accessdate=16 December 2013|author=Marjola Rukaj|year=2009|quote=But for the time being Greek place names in southern Albania, Turkish ones in other regions, and Latin and Italian ones along the coast do not seem to be a source of concern.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assembly of Kosovo adopted a Law on the Use of Languages which stipulated that non-Albanians have the right to receive all information, documents and other services in any of the Kosovo’s official languages.

== In Macedonia ==

During [[Second World War]] western part of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] was annexed into fascist Albania.

The '''''Ananga Ranga''''' (अनंगरंग ''Stage of Love'') or '''''Kamaledhiplava''''' (कमलेधिप्लव ''Boat in the Sea of Love'') is an Indian [[sex manual]] written by [[Kalyana malla]] in the 15th or 16th century.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Human Sexuality: A Selected Guide|author1=Frayser, S.G.|author2=Whitby, T.J.|date=1995|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=9781563081316|url=https://books.google.ru/books?id=ZArPH0nFGo0C&amp;pg=PA143|page=143|accessdate=2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poet wrote the work in honor of [[Lad Khan]], son of [[Ahmed Khan Lodi]]. He was related to the [[Lodi dynasty]], which from 1451 to 1526 ruled [[Delhi Sultanate|from Delhi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kamashastra.com/kamaint.htm ''Introduction to the History of Sex Manuals'' by Kamashastra] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212114008/http://kamashastra.com/kamaint.htm |date=December 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later commentators have said it is aimed specifically at preventing the separation of a husband and wife. This work is often compared to the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'', on which it draws.

== Overview ==
It was translated into English in the year 1885, under the editorship of Sir [[Richard Francis Burton]] and subsequently burnt by his wife [[Isabel Burton]] in the weeks following his death.

"Satisfaction and enjoyment comes for a man with possession of a beautiful woman. Men marry because of the peaceful gathering, love, and comfort and they often get nice and attractive women. But the men do not give the women full satisfaction. The reason is due to the ignorance of the writings of the [[Kamashastra]] and the disdain of the different types of women. These men view women only from the perspective of an animal. They are foolish and spiritless".&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ganganagarmasti.blogspot.com/2007/04/ananga-ranga.html |title=KAMASUTRA: ananga ranga |publisher=ganganagarmasti.blogspot.com|accessdate=2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was intended to show that a woman is enough for a man. The book provides instructions in how a [[husband]] can promote the love for his [[wife]] through [[sex|sexual pleasure]]. The husband can so greatly enjoy living with his wife, that it is as if he had lived with 32 different women.

'''BuyBlue.org''' was an online consumers' guide designed to help [[Progressivism in the United States|progressives]] in the [[United States]] choose brands that favored their politics. Its editors rated companies based on their campaign contributions and other factors. Its name refers to the popular idea of the U.S. being sharply divided, culturally and politically, into [[red states and blue states]] that voted [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], respectively, in the 2000 election.

The website encouraged users to submit articles that criticize or applaud a company's [[Business ethics|business practices]]. The submitting user assigned a [[Binary opposition|binary]] [[Level of measurement|categorical rating]] of positive or negative with regards to the company's adherence to progressive business practices as described in the article. The absolute number of articles submitted and each submitted article's rating were used to calculate a company's overall rating. A five-point scale ranked a company's degree of progressiveness or regressiveness according to users' submissions.

The website hosted [[blog]]s and [[Internet forum|message boards]] designed to steer consumers towards businesses favored by the party, to exert direct political pressure on targeted businesses, and to foster activism among the site's users.

Though this website was geared toward liberals, conservatives could also use it to find out which companies are supporting Republicans.

==Methodology==
The website's editors used public databases and compiled an estimate of political [[Campaign finance|campaign contributions]] by a company's three highest [[executive officer]]s, those executives' spouses, the highest [[executive officer]] at any [[subsidiary|subsidiary company]], and any [[political action committee|PAC]] registered by that company. The allocation of donations between [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] determined a company's political contribution rating, with higher ratings awarded to companies that primarily donate to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].

==Rating categories==
*The '''[[Labour (economics)|Labor]] &amp; [[Human rights|Human Rights]]''' category covers article submissions from sources such as [[Sweatshop Watch]] and the [[National Labor Relations Board]] that address topics including [[sweatshop]]s, [[Trade union|unions]] and [[union busting]].
*The '''[[Natural environment|Environment]]''' category covers article submissions from sources such as the [[Environmental Working Group]] and [[Greenpeace]] that address topics including [[sustainability]], [[ecosystem]]s and [[resource recovery]].
*The '''[[Employment]] [[Equal opportunity|Equality]]''' category covers article submissions from sources such as the [[Institute for Women's Policy Research]] and the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] that address topics including [[discrimination]], [[domestic partnership|domestic partner]] [[Employee benefits|benefits]], and [[Multiculturalism|diversity]].
*The '''[[Corporate social responsibility|Corporate and Social Responsibility]]''' category covers article submissions from sources such as [[United for a Fair Economy]] and the [[Council on Economic Priorities]] that address topics including [[Donation|charitable contribution]]s, [[Community development|community participation]], and [[Consumer advocacy|product safety]] and [[product liability]].
*The '''Industry Practices''' category addresses industry-specific topics.

==Spring 2007 shutdown==

As of April 23, 2007, the website was shut down, and the following message was posted at the site:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Thanks for your support!

The BuyBlue team would like to thank you for all of your support over the past 2 years, unfortunately we are shutting our virtual doors. We hope that we've been able to educate consumers and inspire people to take action and vote with their wallets. Maybe another group will take up this charge in the future, but for now we can no longer do so.
Just because we won't be online any more does not mean that the information we provided cannot be found any longer. You'll want to keep the following information sources in mind. Also, BuyBlue Colorado, an independent organization, will continue to remain operational.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This message was also followed by the statement that BuyBlue's data had been donated to the organization Advomatic.

On September 6, 2007, the site carried a message stating that 'BuyBlue 2.0' would be coming that fall, with the guide returning in a "more partisan and focused" form.

As of March 4, 2010, the site displayed a banner by Advomatic with the organization's slogan and a message stating that it is undergoing scheduled maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buyblue.org/ |title=Buyblue.org |accessdate=2005-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051024014343/http://www.buyblue.org/ |archivedate=2005-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antarctic expedition map (Amundsen - Scott)-en-crop.png|thumb|300px|alt= Map of a segment of Antarctica, identifying the polar marches of Scott and Amundsen.|The routes to the South Pole taken by Scott (green) and Amundsen (red), 1911–1912.]]

Between December 1911 and January 1912, both [[Roald Amundsen]] (leading his [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition|South Pole expedition]]) and [[Robert Falcon Scott]] (leading the [[Terra Nova Expedition]]) reached the [[South Pole]] within a month of each other. But while Scott and his four companions died on the return journey, Amundsen's party managed to reach the [[geographic south pole]] first and subsequently return to their base camp at [[Framheim]] without loss of life, suggesting that they were better prepared for the expedition. The contrasting fates of the two teams seeking the same prize at the same time invites comparison.

== Overview ==
The outcomes of the two expeditions were as follows.
*Priority at the South Pole: Amundsen beat Scott to the South Pole by 34 days.
*Fatalities: Scott lost five men including himself returning from the pole, out of a team of 65. Amundsen's entire team of 19 returned to Norway safely.
*Some authors (including Huntford and Fiennes) associate up to two further deaths (the drowning of Robert Brissenden and the suicide of [[Hjalmar Johansen]]) with the two expeditions, but these happened outside the Antarctic Circle.

Historically, several factors have been discussed and many contributing factors claimed,&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; including:

* Priority at the pole: Scott wrote that Amundsen's dogs seriously threatened his own polar aspirations, because dogs, being more cold-tolerant than ponies, would be able to start earlier in the season than Scott's mixed transport of dogs, ponies, and motors.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's diary, 22 Feb 1911 "The proper, as well as wiser, course for us is to proceed exactly as though this had not happened. To go forward and do our best for the honour of the country without fear or panic. There is no doubt that Amundsen's plan is a serious menace to ours. He has a shorter distance to the Pole by 60 miles— I never thought he could have got so many dogs safely to the ice. His plan for running them seems excellent. But above all he can start his journey early in the season—an impossible condition with ponies."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cherry Garrard in ''[[The Worst Journey in the World]]'' agreed but added that in his experience, dogs would not have been able to ascend the Beardmore Glacier.&lt;ref&gt;Apsley Cherry Garrard, ''The Worst Journey in the World'', chapter 19 "The practical man of the world has plenty of criticism of the way things were done. He says dogs should have been taken [to the Polar Plateau], but he does not show how they could have been got up and down the Beardmore [Glacier]."&lt;/ref&gt;
* With regards to the causes of the deaths of Scott and his companions, Cherry-Garrard devotes chapter 19 in his book to examine the causes. Among several other factors, he surmised that [[#Food and fuel|the rations of Scott's team were inadequate]] and did not provide enough energy for the men.&lt;ref name="Apsley Cherry Gerrard 1921, page 573"&gt;Apsley Cherry-Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World&amp;nbsp;– Antarctic 1910–13, Chapter XIX, page 573.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Much of Scott's hauling was to be done by ponies, which are ill-suited to work on snow and ice without snow-shoes. Their relatively small hooves and large weight caused them to sink into anything other than very firm snow or ice. Oates was opposed to snow-shoes and had left most of them at base camp.
* Ponies' coats easily became soaked with [[perspiration]] during exertion, thus necessitating constant attention with blankets to avoid hypothermia through evaporation. Dogs in contrast do not have sweat glands—they cool themselves via panting, making them less vulnerable to the cold. With ponies, Scott acknowledged he could not depart until 1 November 1911 when the weather would be warmer, leaving him less time to complete the journey.
* The loss of ponies, several of which had drowned on disintegrating sea-ice, limited the supplies that could be hauled to the depots. Of 19 ponies brought south to aid in laying depots on the Ross Ice Shelf (traversed during the first and final quarters of the trek) nine were lost before the journey began. Further, unlike dogs which could eat the abundant [[Seal meat|seal]] and penguin meat found in Antarctica, the ponies' food had to be carried forward from the ship, vastly increasing the stores that had to be transported as Scott's expedition moved towards the pole.  
* Had the one-ton depot been placed at latitude 80°&amp;nbsp;S., as planned, Scott and his two surviving companions could have reached it on their return march. Instead, because Scott refused to drive the ponies to their deaths, despite Oates' urgent advice to do so, the depot was placed some 31&amp;nbsp;miles short of there. Scott's party died  11&amp;nbsp;miles south of the depot.
* The last-minute addition of Lieutenant Henry R. Bowers to the planned four-man pole party may have strained the rationing plan, although the death of Petty Officer Evans weeks later reduced the party to four again.
* The rations were deficient in B and C vitamins.&lt;ref name=Preston&gt;{{cite book|last= Preston|first= Diana|title= A First Rate Tragedy|publisher= Constable &amp; Co.|location= London|year= 1997|pages= 218–219|isbn= 0-09-479530-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party became weaker a few weeks after reaching the pole, despite Scott's racing ambitions before the return march, writing "Now for a desperate struggle to get the news through first [before Amundsen reaches the cablehead in Australia]. I wonder if we can do it."
* The tins of cooking fuel cached along the return route were found to be partly empty, which forced the men to eat frozen food. Shortage of fuel to melt water likely caused the men to become dehydrated. Apparently the heat of the sun had vaporised part of the fuel, enabling it to escape past the cork stoppers. Amundsen knew about this "creep", and had had the fuel tins soldered shut on the voyage to Antarctica, see below.
* The weather on the return march seems to have been unusually bad. In particular, when the party reached the Great Ice Barrier, the temperature was much lower than expected for the season, making the surface much less suitable for the sledge runners. Furthermore, the tailwind which they had expected to aid them home did not appear. Scott wrote, in his final "Message to the Public": "...our wreck is certainly due to this sudden advent of severe weather...."
* The complexity of the transportation plan made it vulnerable. It depended in part on motor-sledges, ponies, dogs, and southerly winds to assist the sledges (which were fitted with sails). Half of the distance was intended to be covered by man-hauling (and sails whenever conditions permitted). Scott's daily marches were limited to the endurance of the slowest team, the man-haulers who were instructed to advance 15 miles a day. The ponies marched by night and rested when the sun was warmer, Meares remained idle in camp with the much faster dogs for many hours, before catching up at the end of the day.&lt;ref&gt;E.G.R.G. Evans South With Scott. Collins London 1953 p184&lt;/ref&gt; 
Sullivan states that it was the last factor that probably was decisive.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; he states "Man is a poor [[pack animal|beast of burden]], as was shown in the terrible experience of Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson in their thrust to the south of 1902–3. However, Scott relied chiefly on man-hauling in 1911–12 because ponies could not ascend the glacier midway to the Pole. The Norwegians correctly estimated that dog teams could go all the way. Furthermore, they used a simple plan, based on their native skill with skis and on dog-driving methods that were tried and true. In a similar fashion to the way the moon was reached by expending a succession of rocket stages and then casting each aside; the Norwegians used the same strategy, sacrificing the weaker animals along the journey to feed the other animals and the men themselves."&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

== Objectives of the expeditions ==
Scott and his financial backers saw the expedition as having a scientific basis, while also wishing to reach the pole. However, it was recognised by all involved that the South Pole was the primary objective ("The Southern Journey involves the most important object of the Expedition"&amp;nbsp;– Scott), and had priority in terms of resources, such as the best ponies and all the dogs and motor sledges as well as involvement of the vast majority of the expedition personnel. Scott and his team knew the expedition would be judged on his attainment of the pole ("The ... public will gauge the result of the scientific work of the expedition largely in accordance with the success or failure of the main object"&amp;nbsp;– Scott). He was prepared to make a second attempt the following year (1912–13) if this attempt failed and had Indian Army mules and additional dogs delivered in anticipation. In fact the mules were used by the team that discovered the dead bodies of Scott, [[Henry Robertson Bowers]], and [[Edward Adrian Wilson]] in November 1912, but proved even less useful than the ponies, according to [[Cherry-Garrard]].

Amundsen's expedition was planned to reach the South Pole. This was a plan he conceived in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, {{ISBN|1-85065-469-7}}, Volume I, Chapter II, page 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Amundsen's expedition did conduct geographical work under [[Kristian Prestrud]] who conducted an expedition to [[King Edward VII Land]] while Amundsen was undertaking his attempt at the pole.

== Base camps ==
Amundsen camped on the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] at the [[Bay of Whales]] which is 60&amp;nbsp;miles (96&amp;nbsp;km) closer to the pole than Scott's camp (which was 350&amp;nbsp;miles west of Amundsen). Amundsen had deduced that, as the Trans-Antarctic Mountains ran northwest to southeast then if he were to meet a mountain range on his route then the time spent at the high altitude of the Antarctic plateau would be less than Scott's.&lt;ref&gt;The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, {{ISBN|1-85065-469-7}}, Volume I, Chapter II, page 47.&lt;/ref&gt;
Scott's base was at [[Cape Evans]] on [[Ross Island]], with access to the Trans-Antarctic mountain range to the west, and was a better base for geological exploration. He had based his previous expedition in the same area. However, he knew it to be poor as a route to the pole as he had to start before sea ice melted and had suffered delay in returning while waiting for the sea ice to freeze. They also had to make detours around Ross Island and its known crevassed areas which meant a longer journey. The crossing of the Ross Ice Shelf was an onerous task for the ponies. Scott had advanced considerable stores across the ice shelf the year before to allow the ponies to carry lighter loads over the early passage across the ice. Even so, he had to delay the departure of the ponies until 1 November rather than 24 October when the dogs and motor sledges set off.&lt;ref&gt;E.R.G.R, Evans South With Scott Collins London 1953 p153&lt;/ref&gt;
Consequently, the Motor Party spent 6 days at the Mount Hooper Depot waiting for Scott to arrive.&lt;ref&gt;E.R.G.R, Evans South With Scott Collins London 1953 p184&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods of transport ==
=== Motor sledges ===
The major comparison between Scott and Amundsen has focused on the choice of draft transport&amp;nbsp;—dog versus pony/man-hauling. In fact Scott took dogs, ponies and three "motor sledges". Scott spent nearly seven times the amount of money on his motor sledges than on the dogs and horses combined. They were therefore a vital part of the expedition. Unfortunately, Scott decided to leave behind the engineer, Lieutenant Commander [[Reginald William Skelton]]&lt;ref name="Capt Scott 1910"&gt;Letter to Capt Scott, R W Skelton, 7 April 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; who had created and trialled the motor sledges. This was due to the selection of Lieutenant [[Edward Evans, 1st Baron Mountevans|E.R.G.R. "Teddy" Evans]] as the expedition's second in command. As Evans was junior in rank to Skelton, he insisted that Skelton could not come on the expedition.&lt;ref name="Capt Scott 1910" /&gt; Scott agreed to this request and Skelton's experience and knowledge was lost.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to R W Skelton from Capt Scott, 21 March 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the original three motor sledges was a failure even before the expedition set out; the heavy sledge was lost through thin ice on unloading it from the ship. The two remaining motor sledges failed relatively early in the main expedition because of repeated faults. Skelton's experience might have been valuable in overcoming the failures.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 17 Oct 1911, page 335 as an example.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ponies vs dogs ===
Scott had used dogs on his first ([[Discovery Expedition|Discovery]]) expedition and felt they had failed. On that journey, Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson started with three sledges and 13 dogs. But on that expedition, the men had not properly understood how to travel on snow with the use of dogs. The party had skis but were too inexperienced to make good use of them.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; As a result, the dogs travelled so fast that the men could not keep up with them. The Discovery expedition had to increase their loads to slow the dogs down.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; Additionally, the dogs were fed Norwegian dried fish, which did not agree with them and soon they began to deteriorate.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; The whole team of dogs eventually died (and were eaten), and the men took over hauling the sleds.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt;

Scott's opinion was reinforced by Shackleton's experience on his [[Nimrod expedition]] that got to within {{convert|97.5|nmi|km mi}} of the pole. Shackleton used ponies. Scott planned to use ponies only to the base of the [[Beardmore Glacier]] (one-quarter of the total journey) and man-haul the rest of the journey. Scott's team had developed snow shoes for his ponies, and trials showed they could significantly increase daily progress. However, [[Lawrence Oates]], whom Scott had made responsible for the ponies, was reluctant to use the snow shoes and Scott failed to insist on their use.&lt;ref name="Solomon-2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solomon|first1=Susan|title=The Coldest March: Scott`s Fatal Antarctic Expedition|date=2001|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0300089678|edition=Hardcover|url=https://www.amazon.com/Coldest-March-Scott-s-Antarctic-Expedition/dp/0300089678/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479764466&amp;sr=1-1|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|85}}

There was plenty of evidence that dogs could succeed in the achievements of [[William Speirs Bruce]] in his Arctic, Antarctic, and [[Scottish National Antarctic Expedition]], Amundsen in the ''[[Gjøa]]'' [[North West passage]] expedition, [[Fridtjof Nansen]]'s crossing of [[Greenland]], [[Robert Peary]]'s three attempts at the [[North Pole]], [[Eivind Astrup]]'s work supporting Peary, [[Frederick Cook]]'s discredited North Pole expedition, and [[Otto Sverdrup]]'s explorations of [[Ellesmere Island]]. Moreover, Scott ignored the direct advice he received (while attending trials of the motor sledges in Norway) from Nansen, the most famous explorer of the day, who told Scott to take "dogs, dogs and more dogs".&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Sir Clements Markham from Fridtjof Nansen, 4 April 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the events, the expert view in England had been that dogs were of dubious value as a means of Antarctic transport.&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Murray | first = Carl | date = October 2008 | title = The use and abuse of dogs on Scott's and Amundsen's South Pole expeditions | journal = The Polar Record | publisher = Cambridge University Press | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 303–311 | issn = 0032-2474 | doi=10.1017/s0032247408007493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, Scott saw two ways in which dogs may be used—they may be taken with the idea of bringing them all back safe and sound, or they may be treated as pawns in the game, from which the best value is to be got regardless of their lives.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; He stated that if, and only if, the comparison was made with a dog sledge journey which aimed to preserve the dogs' lives, 'I am inclined to state my belief that in the polar regions properly organised parties of men will perform as extended journeys as teams of dogs.'&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; On the other hand, if the lives of the dogs were to be sacrificed, then 'the dog-team is invested with a capacity for work which is beyond the emulation of men. To appreciate this is a matter of simple arithmetic'.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; But efficiency notwithstanding, he expressed "reluctance" to use dogs in this way: "One cannot calmly contemplate the murder of animals which possess such intelligence and individuality, which have frequently such endearing qualities, and which very possibly one has learnt to regard as friends and companions."&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt;

Amundsen, by contrast, took an entirely utilitarian approach.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; Amundsen planned from the start to have weaker animals killed to feed the other animals and the men themselves.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sullivan | first = Walter | year = 1962 | title = The South Pole Fifty Years After | url=http://arctic.journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/view/3571/3546|journal = Arctic | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 175–178 | doi=10.14430/arctic3571}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed the opinion that it was less cruel to feed and work dogs correctly before shooting them, than it would be to starve and overwork them to the point of collapse.&lt;ref name="Pugh"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pugh | first = L G | title = The Logistics of the Polar Journeys of Scott, Shackleton and Amundsen | date = January 1972 | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 65 | issue = 1 | pages = 42–47 | pmid = 4552519 | pmc=1644311 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amundsen and his team had similar affection for their dogs as those expressed above by the English, but they "also had agreed to shrink from nothing in order to achieve our goal".&lt;ref&gt;The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, {{ISBN|1-85065-469-7}}, Volume II, Chapter XI, page 62-63.&lt;/ref&gt; The British thought such a procedure was distasteful, though they were willing to eat their ponies.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

Amundsen had used the opportunity of learning from the [[Inuit]] while on his ''[[Gjøa]]'' [[North West passage]] expedition of 1905. He recruited experienced dog drivers. To make the most of the dogs he paced them and deliberately kept daily mileages shorter than he need have for 75 percent of the journey,&lt;ref&gt;Diary, Olav Bjaaland, entry 12 November 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; and his team spent up to 16 hours a day resting. His dogs could eat seals and penguins hunted in the [[Antarctic]] while Scott's pony fodder had to be brought all the way from England in their ship. It has been later shown that seal meat with the blubber attached is the ideal food for a sledge dog. Amundsen went with 52 dogs, and came back with 11.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt;

What Scott did not realise is a sledge dog, if it is to do the same work as a man, will require the same amount of food.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; Furthermore, when sledge dogs are given insufficient food they become difficult to handle.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; The advantage of the sledge dog is its greater mobility.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; Not only were the Norwegians accustomed to skiing, which enabled them to keep up with their dogs, but they also understood how to feed them and not overwork them.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt;

=== Walking vs skiing on snow ===
Scott took the Norwegian [[pilot (aeronautics)|pilot]] and [[skier]] [[Tryggve Gran]] to the [[Antarctic]] on the recommendation of Nansen to train his expedition to ski, but although a few of his party began to learn, he made no arrangements for compulsory training for the full party. Gran (possibly because he was Norwegian) was not included in the South Pole party, which could have made a difference. Gran was, one year later, the first to locate the deceased Scott and his remaining companions in their tent just some 18&amp;nbsp;km (11 miles) short of One Ton depot, that might have saved their lives had they reached it.

Scott would subsequently complain in his diary, while well into his journey and therefore too late to take any corrective action and after over 10 years since the Discovery expedition, that "Skis are the thing, and here are my tiresome fellow countrymen too prejudiced to have prepared themselves for the event".&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 11 Dec 1911, page 388.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amundsen on his side recruited a team of well experienced skiers, all Norwegians who had skied from an early age. He also recruited a champion skier, [[Olav Bjaaland]], as the front runner. The Amundsen party gained weight on their return travel from the [[South Pole]].

== Weather conditions ==
Scott and Shackleton's experience in 1903 and 1907 gave them first-hand experience of average conditions in Antarctica. [[George Simpson (meteorologist)|Simpson]], Scott's meteorologist 1910–1912, charted the weather during their expedition, often taking two readings a day. On their return to the Ross Ice Shelf, Scott's group experienced prolonged low temperatures from 27 February until 10 March which have only been matched once in 15 years of current records.&lt;ref name="Solomon-2001" /&gt;{{RP|286}} The exceptional severity of the weather meant they failed to make the daily distances they needed to get to the next depot. This was a serious position as they were short of fuel and food. When Scott, Wilson, and Bowers died (Petty Officer [[Edgar Evans]] and [[Lawrence Oates]] had died earlier during the return from the South Pole) they were {{Convert|11|mi|order=flip}} short of One-Ton Depot, which was {{Convert|140|mi|order=flip}} from Corner Camp, where they would have been safe.

On the other hand, Cherry-Garrard had travelled nearly {{Convert|300|mi|4=-2|order=flip}} in the same area, during the same time period and same temperatures, using a dog team.&lt;ref name="Apsley Cherry-Garrard 1912, page 420–428"&gt;Apsley Cherry-Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World&amp;nbsp;– Antarctic 1910–13, Chapter XIII, dates 19 Feb to 15 Mar 1912, page 420–428.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott also blamed "a prolonged blizzard". But while there is evidence to support the low temperatures, there is only evidence for a "normal" two- to four-day blizzard, and not the ten days that Scott claims.&lt;ref name="Solomon-2001" /&gt;{{RP|318-319}}

== Route marking and depot laying ==
During depot laying in February 1911, Roald Amundsen had his first (and last) {{Convert|180|mi|order=flip}} of his route marked like a Norwegian ski course using marker flags initially every eight miles. He added to this by using food containers painted black, resulting in a marker every mile. From 82 degrees on, Amundsen built a {{Convert|6|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}} cairn every three miles with a note inside recording the cairn's position, the distance to the next depot, and direction to the next cairn.&lt;ref&gt;The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, {{ISBN|1-85065-469-7}}, Volume II, Chapter X, page 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In order not to miss a depot considering the snow and great distances, Amundsen took precautions. Each depot laid out up to 85 degrees (laid out every degree of latitude) had a line of bamboo flags laid out transversely every half-mile for five miles on either side of the depot, ensuring that the returning party could locate the designated depot.

Scott relied on depots much less frequently laid out. For one distance where Amundsen laid seven depots, Scott laid only two. Routes were marked by the walls made at lunch and evening stops to protect the ponies. Depots had a single flag. As a result, Scott has much concern recorded in his diaries over route finding, and experienced close calls about finding depots.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 25 and 26 Jan 1912, page 431 and entry 12 and 13 Feb 1912, page 443 as examples.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also clear that Scott's team did not travel on several days, because the swirling snow hid their three-month-old outward tracks. With better depot and route marking they would have been able to travel on more days with a following wind which would have filled the sail attached to their sledge, and so travel further, and might have reached safety.

== Food and fuel ==
By the time they arrived at the pole, the health of Scott's team had significantly deteriorated, whereas Amundsen's team actually gained weight during the expedition. While Scott's team managed to maintain the scheduled pace for most of the return leg, and hence was virtually always on full rations, their condition continued to worsen rapidly. (The only delay occurred when they were held for four days by a blizzard, and had to open their summit rations early as a consequence.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 7 Dec 1911, page 381.&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]] in his analysis of the expedition estimated that even under optimistic assumptions the summit rations contained only a little more than half the calories actually required for the man-hauling of sledges.&lt;ref name="Apsley Cherry Gerrard 1921, page 573" /&gt; A carefully planned 2006 re-enactment of both Amundsen's and Scott's travels, sponsored by the [[BBC]], confirmed Cherry-Garrard's theory. The British team had to abort their tour due to the severe weight loss of all members.&lt;ref&gt;Jasper Rees, Blizzard&amp;nbsp;– Race to the pole, BBC Books 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-563-49326-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The experts hinted that Scott's reports of unusually bad surfaces and weather conditions might in part have been due to their exhausted state which made them feel the sledge weights and the chill more severely.

Scott's calculations for the supply requirements were based on a number of expeditions, both by members of his team (e.g., [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Wilson]]'s trip with [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard|Cherry-Garrard]] and [[Henry Robertson Bowers|Bowers]] to the Emperor penguin colony which had each man on a different type of experimental ration), and by Shackleton. Apparently, Scott didn't take the strain of prolonged man-hauling at high altitudes sufficiently into account.

Since the rations contained no [[B vitamins|B]] and [[Vitamin C|C vitamins]], the only source of these vitamins during the trek was from the slaughter of ponies or dogs.  This made the men progressively malnourished, manifested most clearly in the form of [[scurvy]].&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;

Scott also had to fight with a shortage of fuel due to leakage from stored fuel cans which used leather washers. This was a phenomenon that had been noticed previously by other expeditions, but Scott took no measures to prevent it. Amundsen, in contrast, had learned the lesson and had his fuel cans soldered closed. A fuel depot he left on Betty's Knoll was found 50 years later still full.&lt;ref name="Huntford-1985"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huntford|first1=Roland|title=The Last Place on Earth|date=1985|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton Ltd|location=London|isbn=0340381019|edition=Hardcover|url=https://www.amazon.com/Last-Place-Earth-Roland-Huntford/dp/0340381019/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479764934&amp;sr=1-1|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|553}}

Dehydration may also have been a factor. Amundsen's team had plenty of fuel due to better planning and soldered fuel cans. Scott had a shortage of fuel and was unable to melt as much water as Amundsen. At the same time Scott's team were more physically active in man-hauling the sledges.

== Clothing and goggles ==
It has been said (by the present-day explorer [[Ranulph Fiennes]] amongst others) that Scott's team was appropriately dressed for man-hauling in their woolen and wind-proof clothing, and as Amundsen was skiing it was appropriate he wore furs. Skiing at the pace of a dog team is a strenuous activity. Yet Amundsen never complained about the clothing being too hot. That is because the furs are worn loosely so air circulates and sweat evaporates. Scott's team, on the other hand, made regular complaints about the cold.

Amundsen's team did initially have problems with their boots. However, the depot-laying trips of January and February 1911 and an abortive departure to the South Pole on 8 September 1911 allowed changes to be made before it was too late.

Scott's team suffered regularly from [[snow blindness]] and sometimes this affected over half the team at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;Apsley Cherry-Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World&amp;nbsp;– Antarctic 1910–13, Chapter X, entry for 10 Dec, page 367 as an example.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, there was no recorded case of snow blindness during the whole of Amundsen's expedition. On the return journey, Amundsen's team rested during the "day" (when the sun was in front of them) and travelled during the "night" (when the sun was behind them) to minimise the effects of snow blindness.

== Delay in meeting Scott's returning party ==
In 1921, [[Edward Evans, 1st Baron Mountevans|'Teddy' Evans]] wrote in his book ''South with Scott'' that Scott had left the following written orders at Cape Evans.{{sfn|Karen May 2012, ''Could Captain Scott have been saved? Revisiting Scott's last expedition'', Polar Record |p=1-19}}

{{quote
| About the first week of February I should like you to start your third journey to the South, the object being to hasten the return of the third Southern unit [the polar party] and give it a chance to catch the ship. The date of your departure must depend on news received from returning units, the extent of the depot of dog food you have been able to leave at One Ton Camp, the state of the dogs, etc&amp;nbsp;...It looks at present as though you should aim at meeting the returning party about March 1 in Latitude 82 or 82.30.{{sfn|Evans, E.R.G.R. 1949, ''South with Scott'', London: Collins |p=187-188}}}}

He did however place a lesser importance upon this journey than that of replenishing the food rations at One Ton Depot.

He continued his instructions in the next paragraph "You will of course understand that whilst the object of your third journey is important, that of the second is vital. At all hazards three X.S. units of provision must be got to One Ton Camp by the date named (19th January), and if the dogs are unable to perform this task, a man party must be organised."&lt;ref&gt;Evans, E.R.G.R. 1953 South With Scott London Collins p = 173&lt;/ref&gt; with that qualification he closed his notes regarding his instructions for the dogs.

Expedition member [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]] did not mention Scott's order in his 1922 book ''The Worst Journey in the World''. However, in the 1948 preface to his book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Gray |first = Richard | title = Scott of the Antarctic could have been saved if his orders had been followed, say scientists | date = 31 December 2012 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/antarctica/robert-falcon-scott/9770678/Scott-of-the-Antarctic-could-have-been-saved-if-his-orders-had-been-followed-say-scientists.html | work = The Telegraph | accessdate = 27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; he discusses Scott's order. Cherry-Garrard writes that he and [[Edward L. Atkinson|Edward Atkinson]] reached Cape Evans on 28 January. Scott had estimated Atkinson would reach camp by 13 January.{{sfn|Evans, E.R.G.R. 1949, ''South with Scott'', London: Collins |p=187-188}} Atkinson, now the senior officer discovered that the dog handler [[Cecil Meares]] had resigned from the expedition and that neither Meares nor anyone else had resupplied dog food to the depots. Cherry-Garrard also wrote "In my opinion he [Atkinson] would not have been fit to take out the dogs in the first week of February".

On 13 February, Atkinson set off on the first lap southwards to Hut Point with the dog assistant, Dimitri Gerov, and the dogs to avoid being cut off by disintegrating sea ice. Atkinson and Gerov were still at [[Hut Point]] when, on 19 February, [[Tom Crean (explorer)|Tom Crean]] arrived on foot from the Barrier and reported that Lt [[Edward Evans, 1st Baron Mountevans|Edward Evans]] was lying seriously ill in a tent some {{Convert|35|mi|order=flip|round=5}} to the south, and in urgent need of rescue.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Lashly, and Crean had formed the final Support Party which had left Scott on 3 January. Lashly had stayed on the Barrier to nurse Evans while Crean walked to Hut Point. Both were awarded Albert (lifesaving) medals&lt;/ref&gt;  Atkinson decided that this mission was his priority, and set out with the dogs to bring Evans back. This was achieved; the party was back at Hut Point on 22 February.

Atkinson sent a note back to the Cape Evans base camp requesting either the meteorologist Wright or Cherry-Garrard to take over the task of meeting Scott with the dogs. Chief meteorologist Simpson was unwilling to release Wright from his scientific work, and Atkinson therefore selected [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]]. It was still not in Atkinson's mind that Cherry-Garrard's was a relief mission, and according to Cherry-Garrard's account, told him to "use his judgement" as to what to do in the event of not meeting the polar party by One Ton, and that Scott's orders were that the dogs must not be risked. Cherry-Garrard left with Gerov and the dogs on 26 February, carrying extra rations for the polar party to be added to the depot and 24 days' of dog food. They arrived at One Ton Depot on 4 March and did not proceed further south. Instead, he and Gerov, after waiting there for Scott for several days, apparently mostly in blizzard conditions (although no blizzard was recorded by Scott some 100 miles further south until 10 March), they returned to Hut Point on 16 March, in poor physical condition and without news of the polar party.

On the return journey from the pole, Scott reached the 82.30°S meeting point for the dog teams three days ahead of schedule, around 27 February 1912. Scott's diary for that day notes "We are naturally always discussing possibility of meeting dogs, where and when, etc. It is a critical position. We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, but there is a horrid element of doubt." By 10 March it became clear that the dog teams were not coming: "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [the dog-driver] had a bad trip home I suppose. It's a miserable jumble."

Around 25 March, awaiting death in his tent at latitude 79.30°S, Scott speculated, in a farewell letter to his expedition treasurer [[Edgar Speyer|Sir Edgar Speyer]], that he had overshot the meeting point with the dog relief teams, writing "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support." (Farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, cited from Karen May 2012.){{sfn|Karen May 2012, ''Could Captain Scott have been saved? Revisiting Scott's last expedition'', Polar Record |p=1-19}}

== Other reasons for Scott's failure ==
; Geology samples
: Scott's team continued to haul over 14&amp;nbsp;kg (30&amp;nbsp;lb) of rock samples. This would appear to be a major handicap when pulling a sledge in a race against the weather and a shortage of food and fuel. Scott could have left the samples at one of the cairns along the way to be picked up later. However, Ranulph Fiennes has suggested that the extra weight would not have been a major handicap.&lt;ref&gt;Captain Scott, Ranulph Fiennes, {{ISBN|0-340-82697-5}}-page 249.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tryggve Gran]] on the other hand thought "they might have saved themselves the bother".&lt;ref&gt;Diary, Tryggve Gran, entry 23 Nov 1912, quoted Last Place on Earth, Roland Huntford, {{ISBN|0-340-38101-9}}, page 556.&lt;/ref&gt;
; Final five-man team
: Scott's planning, equipment and rations had been based on three sledge teams of four men ascending the Beardmore, with a team turning back every 10 days or so as rations required finally leaving one four-man team to attempt the pole. At the last moment when down to two teams (Scott's and Evans's) Scott decided to send a returning party of three, and take on five. This increased the cooking time for the team of five and affected the fuel supply.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 5 Jan 1912, page 414.&lt;/ref&gt; It also meant the Evans party of three had to try to split the ration pack (at a time when they were cold and tired and later when one member was suffering from scurvy) to leave an allowance for the fifth man in Scott's party. This also will have affected the seepage of fuel from cans which were opened and then re-closed and left for several weeks before Scott's team got to them. Moreover, for some unexplained reason Scott had ordered Evans's team to cache their skis a week before so Bowers (the fifth man) walked to the pole and back to the cached skis (360&amp;nbsp;miles) while the rest of Scott's team skied.
; Misuse of the dog team
: For no clear reason Scott took the dogs on 140&amp;nbsp;miles further than originally planned. This meant killing the ponies early (and starting man-hauling earlier) to feed the dogs for no obvious benefit to the overall expedition. Scott also gave conflicting and changing orders for their use to each returning party. It was only in late February 1912 that it was discovered that the final supplies needed by Scott's returning party had not been delivered to One Ton Depot. Cherry-Garrard was sent with these supplies on 25 February 1912 and he was relieved to discover that he had beaten Scott's team to the depot.&lt;ref name="Apsley Cherry-Garrard 1912, page 420–428" /&gt; He also found that promised supplies of dog food were not in place. Cherry-Garrard remained at the depot, within {{Convert|100|km|4=-1}} of Scott, 4–10 March 1912 when he could possibly have saved Scott, Wilson, Bowers, and Oates if the management of the dog team had been better.
; Navigation
: Amundsen used prepared navigation sheets that simplified the calculations for his team when they were tired and cold. Four out of his team of five were qualified navigators. Amundsen's expedition also used a [[sextant]] during the journey, which is a relatively light and simple piece of equipment. He also attended a symposium that reviewed how to fix position at high latitudes. Scott used a [[theodolite]] which is heavier and requires more mental arithmetic.&lt;ref name="Huntford-1985" /&gt;{{RP|482}} Scott also lacked navigators having only one per team. Scott dismissed Cherry-Garrard's request for navigational training and Wilson only attempted to learn how to read latitudes at the last moment.&lt;ref name="Huntford-1985" /&gt;{{RP|473, 538}}
; Camp routine
: Amundsen used canisters that left his sledges permanently lashed and loaded. Scott's team had to unload, and load and relash their sledge at every camp, no matter what the weather.

{{Linguistic typology topics}}

The definition of a '''direct–inverse language''' is a matter under research, but it is widely understood to involve different grammar for [[transitive verb|transitive predication]]s according to the relative positions of their "subject" and their "object" on a ''person hierarchy'', which, in turn, is some combination of [[salience (communication)|saliency]] and [[animacy]] specific to a given language. The direct construction is the [[Markedness|unmarked]] one. The direct construction is used when the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the transitive clause outranks the [[object (grammar)|object]] in the person hierarchy, and the inverse is used when the object outranks the subject. The existence of direct–inverse morphosyntax is usually accompanied by [[Obviative|proximate–obviative]] morphosyntax. The direct–inverse dimension subsumes the proximate–obviative dimension. Across languages, obviation almost always involves the third person (although second-person obviation is reported for some [[Nilo-Saharan languages]]{{sfn|Gregerson|1977|pp=51-52}}), and the direct–inverse alternation is usually presented as being a way of marking the proximate–obviative distinction between two (or more) third person arguments of a sentence. However, there are at least two languages with inverse systems, the [[Mesoamerican languages]] [[Mixe-Zoquean languages|Zoque]] and [[Huastec language|Huastec]], in which inverse morphosyntax is never used when both subject and object are third person, but only when one of these arguments is third person and the other is a speech act participant (SAP), the first or second person .{{sfn|Zavala|2006|p=278}}

==Morphosyntactic variation across inverse-type languages==
Neither a morphological feature nor a syntactic feature is common to all inverse systems.{{sfn|Klaiman|1992|p=}}

Direct-inverse systems on verbs coexist with the various [[morphosyntactic alignment]]s in nouns. In some inverse languages, including all Mesoamerican inverse languages,{{sfn|Zavala|2007|p=278}} the direct-inverse alternation changes the morphosyntactic alignment, and the language is said to have ''hierarchical alignment''.{{sfn|Zavala|2007|p=270}}

Klaiman has suggested four common properties of inverse languages:{{sfn|Klaiman|1989|p=}}{{sfn|Klaiman|1992|p=}}{{sfn|Klaiman|1993|p=}}
#Core participants of transitive predicates are ranked on a hierarchy of salience, topicality or animacy.
#Only transitive predicates can participate in the direct–inverse alternation.
#A morphosyntactic device should be used to signal whether the most salient participant is notional subject or notional object.
#Direct–inverse alternation does not entail detransitivization.

Some languages that comply with Klaiman's definition of an inverse language are [[Maasai language|Maasai]], [[Carib languages|Carib]], [[Wastek language|Wastek]], [[Chukchi language|Chukchee]], the [[Algonquian languages]] and some [[Athapaskan languages]] like [[Koyukon language|Koyukon]] and [[Navaho language|Navajo]], [[Mapudungun]] and [[Movima language|Movima]] (language isolates), [[rGyalrong]] (Sino-Tibetan) and some [[Mixe–Zoquean languages]]. On the other hand, the Mixean language [[Oluta Popoluca|Oluteco]] has been reported to have an inverse system which does not conform to the second rule, as certain intransitive verbs and passives of [[ditransitive verb|ditransitives]] also can take inverse morphology.{{sfn|Zavala|2002|p=180}}

===Inverse morphology in Ojibwe===
In [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]] of North America, the person hierarchy is second person &gt; first person &gt; third person proximate &gt; third person [[obviative]]. Since the morphology of Ojibwe has no [[grammatical case|case]] distinctions (an Ojibwe nominal phrase does not change when its relations to the other sentence constituents change), the only way to distinguish subject from object in a transitive verb with two participants is through direct–inverse suffixes. A direct suffix indicates that the action is performed by someone higher on the person hierarchy on someone lower on the person hierarchy:

{| class="wikitable"
| colspan="4"|''obizindawaan''
|-
| o-
| bizindaw
| -aa
| -n
|-
| 3-
| listen.to
| -&lt;small&gt;DIRECT&lt;/small&gt;
| -3&lt;small&gt;OBVIATIVE&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| colspan="4"|"He listens to the other one"
|}

An inverse suffix indicates that the action is performed by someone lower on the person hierarchy on someone higher on the person hierarchy (such as by the speaker on the addressee or an obviative third person on a proximate):

{| class="wikitable"
| colspan="4"|''obizindaagoon''
|-
| o-
| bizindaw
| -igoo
| -n
|-
| 3-
| listen.to
| -&lt;small&gt;INVERSE&lt;/small&gt;
| -3&lt;small&gt;OBVIATIVE&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| colspan="4"|"The other one listens to him"
|}

As can be seen, the only difference between these two verbs is the direct–inverse opposition, rather than case markers (or word order, when distinct nominals are used). An inverse verb is '''not''' equivalent to a [[grammatical voice|passive]] verb. There is a separate passivity marker, denoted in literature as "indefinite person (X)", ranked in topicality hierarchy below first and second persons, but higher than animate and inanimate third persons:

{| class="wikitable"
| colspan="3"|''bizindawaa''
|-
| 
| bizindaw
| -aa
|-
| X-
| listen.to
| -&lt;small&gt;DIRECT&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| colspan="4"|"He is listened to"
|}

===Semantic and pragmatic inverse in Sahaptin===
[[Sahaptin language|Sahaptin]], an Amerindian language of the northwestern United States, has an inverse marked by the verbal prefix ''pá''-. It indicates transitive action from the second to the third person when both arguments are SAPs. That can be called the semantic inverse.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRude2009|Rude, 2009]].&lt;/ref&gt;

{|
|-
| colspan=4 | ''q̓ínušamaš''
|-
| q̓ínu
| -ša
| =maš
|-
| see
| -{{small|ASP}}
| =1{{small|SG/2SG}}
|-
| colspan=4 | "I see you"
|}
{|
|-
| colspan=4 | ''páq̓inušanam''

| -ša
| =nam
|-
| {{small|INV}}-
| see
| -{{small|ASP}}
| =2{{small|SG}}
|-
| colspan=4 | "you see me"
|}

Sahaptin ''pá''- does not occur with transitive action between SAPs and the third person, but it does occur between third-person participants. The contrast can be elicited with multiple clause examples such as given below. In the inverse the semantic patient is coreferential with the subject in the preceding clause. That can be called a pragmatic inverse.

| and
| {{small|INV}}-
| kill

|-
| colspan=4 | "the man saw the grizzly and it killed him"
|}

The pragmatic inverse topicalizes the patient, but its nominal, if present, retains its accusative case-marking.

'''''Dril Official "Mr. Ten Years" Anniversary Collection''''' is the first book by [[dril]], a pseudonymous [[Twitter]] user known for his [[Surreal humour|absurdist humor]]. The book is the author's compilation of the account's best tweets from its first ten years, alongside new original illustrations. The tweets are sorted into sections by topic. The book was [[Self-publishing|self-published]] in [[paperback]] and [[E-book|ebook]] formats. According to the preface, dril published the book in print so that his tweets would survive a future [[societal collapse]] and [[digital dark age]].

The book received generally positive reviews, with praise directed at dril's distinctive humor and creativity. Although the book's written material was already available online for free, critics generally agreed that the compilation's quality and dril's influence justified its publication.

== Development and publication ==

The @dril Twitter account began posting in September 2008; in the years that followed, dril became well-known for his idiosyncratic humor and accrued a [[cult following]]. In January 2017, dril opened a [[Patreon]] account for fans to make monthly payments in support of his tweets and future projects, including "video, illustration, and long-form writing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{quote|as I believe I've mentioned earlier, I am working on two (2) new books, and as of right now your generous contributions are mainly funding the completion of these projects: [...] BOOK #1: Just absolutely, cover to cover, the worst bullshit imaginable [...] all loosely tied together with a narrative adjacent to the 'Mythos' surrounding my posts. [...] BOOK #2: a lot of people ask me for a 'Best of' release, like some kind of coffee table book of my top posts, and while I think a book containing nothing but short messages you can easily dig up online would be sort of Shitty, I decided to make it worthwhile by filling the thing up with new stuff as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Reception ==
In an article for ''Vice'', Peter Slattery wrote "[o]rdinarily, throwing together a book full of old tweets would seem pretty lazy, but given how much legit influence dril has had on Twitter humor and online culture at large, everybody probably owes the account at least 20 bucks."&lt;ref name="dril book" /&gt; Reviewing the book for ''Vice'', Rachel Pick concluded that the book was worth it "so that one day, centuries from now, after the bombs go off and [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMPs]] take out the electrical grid, long after Twitter has died, a solitary wanderer may find a scrap of paper buried in the ruins of my Brooklyn apartment building, and they will lift it up to the dying sun and squint through their protective goggles to read" a dril tweet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{italic title}}
'''''Encyclopaedia Biblica: A Critical Dictionary of the Literary, Political and Religion History, the Archeology, Geography and Natural History of the Bible''''' (1899), edited by [[Thomas Kelly Cheyne]] and [[John Sutherland Black|J. Sutherland Black]], is a critical encyclopedia of the [[Bible]]. In [[theology]] and [[biblical studies]], it is often referenced as ''Enc. Bib.'', or as ''Cheyne and Black''.

==Description==
[[File:C+B-Ethiopia-Fig3-PyramidOfMeroe.PNG|thumb|right|150px|An image illustrating the article 'Ethiopia' – one of the [[Nubian pyramids]] at [[Meroe]]]]
It has an article for every single name and place both in the Bible and in its traditional [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]], as well as for each of the books of these, together with many improper nouns appearing in these (such as ''nebi'im'', 'mole', 'owl') and other more general subjects (such as 'music', 'tents', etc.). Many of these articles are given in great detail, and usually include mention of the various spellings for each word as used by the [[Masoretic Text]], [[Septuagint]] (differentiating between each of the most important ancient manuscripts), and by other ancient versions; the largest article is that on the Gospels, which is over 5 MB in size, despite being almost completely plain text (and therefore over half a million words long). It is thus an extremely large work – in PDF form it constitutes a total of about 190 MB of mostly plain text (this would equate to nearly 20 million words, even at 10 characters per word).

It is frequently referenced by other respected Bible-related encyclopedias of the period, such as the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;for example, it is a source for [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05646b.htm the article 'Eve'] in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and 11th Edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;ref&gt;,{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hosea |volume=13 |pages=784–786 |first1=William Robertson |last1=Smith |first2=Henry Wheeler |last2=Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example. The ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' has some articles ('marriage' for example) which quote large sections from it nearly verbatim. It is also referenced by works such as the ''[[International Standard Bible Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibleencyclopedia.com/aaron.htm the article on Aaron], for example&lt;/ref&gt; It is hence, indirectly, also a source for some articles of the [[English Wikipedia]], mainly related to the Judaeo-Christian religion.

A measure of its importance of some of the contributors is gained from the fact that the Jewish Encyclopedia dedicates the majority of the article 'Jerahmeel' to discussing Cheyne's theory of the Jerahmeelites, despite regarding it as arbitrary.

The articles are still of value and interest to modern scholars,&lt;ref&gt;As reading material suggested by the University of Calgary, for example: [https://www.ucalgary.ca/~lipton/dict.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As a source for the archaeology department at [[Tel Aviv University]][http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/archaeology/directory/dir_anson_rainey.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islam]]ic writers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/2132/ e.g.]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to religio-political commentators such as [[Jihad Watch]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jihadwatch.org/2008/03/blogging-the-quran-sura-17-the-night-journey-verses-2-111.html Blogging the Qur’an: Sura 17, “The Night Journey,” verses 2-111], [[Jihad Watch]], referenced as 'enc. bib.'{{unreliable source?|date=April 2012}}&lt;!-- Blogs are not normally considered reliable--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; however, modern archaeological research and discoveries have made portions of it obsolete, and modern interpretations are of even older material is likely to be very different. For example, the Jerahmeelite/Arabian theory (see below) has long been ignored. It is no longer restricted by [[copyright]] and has become available [[online]] ([[Wikisource:Encyclopaedia Biblica|at wikisource]], for example).

== Cheyne's 'surprising' theory about the Jerahmeelites ==

Professor Cheyne put forth a surprising&lt;ref name="JewishEncyclopediaOnCheyneAndJerahmeel"&gt;[[Jewish Encyclopedia]], [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=J&amp;artid=223 Jerahmeel]&lt;/ref&gt; theory concerning the [[Jerahmeel]]ites. In his view they were a powerful north-Arabian tribe, with which the Hebrews came into conflict on their first approach to the land. A part of the Jerahmeelites was absorbed by the Hebrews, but there were many contests between the Israelites and the main body of the Jerahmeelites all through the period of [[Books of Kings|the Kings]]. Even among the post-exilic opponents of Nehemiah, the Jerahmeelites appear again. Cheyne believes that echoes of these conflicts once reverberated throughout the [[Old Testament]], but that, owing to the corruption of the Masoretic Text, they must now be reawakened by conjectural emendation of the text.

Carrying out this idea, Cheyne finds the chief elements of Israel's origin, religion, and history in Jerahmeel. Babylonia and Assyria sink into insignificance beside Jerahmeel in so far as influence on the Old Testament is concerned. "Amalekites" is a corruption of "Jerahmeelites"; "Beer-lahai-roi" (Gen. xvi. 14) is a corruption of "Well of Jerahmeel"; "Ephraim" is often a corruption of "Jerahmeel." The epithet of [[Jericho]], "city of palm-trees," is a corruption of "city of Jerahmeel"; the names of Saul, of Kish, his father, and of most of the sons of Saul are held to be corruptions of "Jerahmeel"; and Isaiah's "Maher-shalal-hash-baz" is held to be a corruption of "Jerahmeel will be deserted." "Jerahmeel" has been displaced by "Babylon" in Isa. xiii. and xiv.; and Ezekiel's three wise men were "Enoch, Jerahmeel, and Arab." This list might be continued indefinitely.&lt;ref name="JewishEncyclopediaOnCheyneAndJerahmeel" /&gt;

By the same principle, he derives other names from "Rehoboth", "Zarephath", "Mizraim", and "Arab";  he does '''not''' equate "[[Mizraim]]" with Egypt (the usual interpretation). The vast majority of names of places and people in the bible are connected by Cheyne to Jerahmeel, or one of these.

The ingenuity of Cheyne's method may be admitted;&lt;ref name="JewishEncyclopediaOnCheyneAndJerahmeel" /&gt; but the thesis must be rejected as altogether arbitrary.&lt;ref name="JewishEncyclopediaOnCheyneAndJerahmeel" /&gt; That it has received serious attention is owing solely to the great service rendered by its sponsor in other departments of Old Testament research.&lt;ref name="JewishEncyclopediaOnCheyneAndJerahmeel" /&gt;

Cheyne frequently mentions this theory in his Encyclopaedia articles, often appending his view to articles written by people with more mainstream interpretations. He does, however, detail the alternative (and therefore mainstream) views, while doing so. Hence the articles are respected, as long as Cheyne's theory about these names is ignored.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8898">{{Paul}}{{Books of the New Testament}}

The '''First Epistle to the Thessalonians''', usually referred to simply as '''First Thessalonians''' (written '''1 Thessalonians''' and abbreviated '''1 Thess.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Manual of Style, 16th Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;''' or '''1 Thes.'''), is the thirteenth book from the [[New Testament]] of the [[Christian Bible]]. The first letter to the [[Thessaloniki|Thessalonians]] was likely the first of [[Pauline epistles|Paul's letters]], probably written by the end of AD 52.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;[[Raymond E. Brown]], ''An Introduction to the New Testament'', [[Anchor Bible]], 1997. pp. 456–466.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
Most New Testament scholars believe [[Paul the Apostle]] wrote this letter from [[Roman Corinth|Corinth]], although information appended to this work in many early manuscripts (e.g., [[Codex Alexandrinus|Codices Alexandrinus]], [[Codex Mosquensis I|Mosquensis]], and [[Codex Angelicus|Angelicus]]) state that Paul wrote it in Athens&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Best, ''The First and Second Epistles to the Thessalonians'' (New York: Harper and Row, 1972), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]] had returned from [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] with news of the state of the church in [[Thessalonica]] ({{bibleverse||Acts|18:1–5|49}}; {{bibleverse|1|Thes.|3:6|49}}). For the most part, the letter is personal in nature, with only the final two chapters spent addressing issues of doctrine, almost as an aside. Paul's main purpose in writing is to encourage and reassure the [[Christianity|Christians]] there. Paul urges them to go on working quietly while waiting in hope for the [[Second Coming|return of Christ]].

===Date===
Unlike all subsequent Pauline epistles, 1 Thessalonians does not focus on [[justification by faith]] or questions of [[Paul the Apostle and Judaism|Jewish–Gentile relations]], themes that are covered in all other letters. Many scholars see this as an indication that this letter was written before the [[Epistle to the Galatians]], where Paul's positions on these matters were formed and elucidated.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;

===Authenticity===
[[File:Minuscule 699 (GA) folio 18.jpg|thumb|220px|The first page of the epistle in [[Minuscule 699]] gives its title as προς θεσσαλονικεις, "To the Thessalonians."]]
The majority of New Testament scholars hold 1 Thessalonians to be authentic, although a number of scholars in the mid-19th century contested its authenticity, most notably [[Clement Schrader]] and [[Ferdinand Christian Baur|F.C. Baur]].&lt;ref&gt;Best, ''Thessalonians'', pp. 22–29.&lt;/ref&gt; 1 Thessalonians matches other accepted Pauline letters, both in style and in content, and its authorship is also affirmed by [[Second Epistle to the Thessalonians|2 Thessalonians]].&lt;ref&gt;"The only possible reference to a previous missive is in 2:15...." Raymond E. Brown, An Introduction to the New Testament, Anchor Bible, 1997. p. 590.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|2:13–16|50}} have often been regarded as a post-Pauline [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolation]]. The following arguments have been based on the content:
* It is perceived to be theologically incompatible with Paul's other epistles: elsewhere Paul [[Responsibility for the death of Jesus|attributed Jesus's death]] to the "rulers of this age" ([https://www.jw.org/en/publications/bible/study-bible/books/1-corinthians/2/#v46002008 1 Cor 2:8]) rather than to the Jews, and elsewhere Paul writes that the [[Supersessionism|Jews have not been abandoned by God]], for "all Israel will be saved" ([https://www.jw.org/en/publications/bible/study-bible/books/romans/11/#v45011026 Rom 11:26]); According to 1 Thes 1:10, the [[Divine retribution|wrath of God]] is still to come; it is not something that has already shown itself.&lt;ref&gt;CollegeVille Bible Commentary, p 1155&lt;/ref&gt;
* There were no extensive historical persecutions of Christians by Jews in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] prior to the [[First Jewish–Roman War|first Jewish war]].&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of the concept of imitation in 1&amp;nbsp;Thes. 2.14 is singular.
* The [[aorist]] ''eftasen'' ("has overtaken") refers to the [[destruction of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Birger A. Pearson, "[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1508972 1 Thessalonians 2:13–16 A Deutero Pauline Interpolation]", ''Harvard Theological Review'', 64 (1971), pp. 79–94&lt;/ref&gt;
* The syntax of 1 Thes. 2:13–16 deviates significantly from that of the surrounding context.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, D., "I Thess 2:13–16: Linguistic Evidence for an Interpolation," JBL 102 (1983): 269–279&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also sometimes suggested that 1 Thes. 5:1–11 is a post-Pauline insertion that has many features of [[Gospel of Luke|Lukan language]] and theology that serves as an apologetic correction to Paul's imminent expectation of the [[Second Coming]] in 1 Thes. 4:13–18.&lt;ref&gt;G. Friedrich, "1. Thessalonicher 5,1–11, der apologetische Einschub eines Spaeteren," ZTK 70 (1973) 289&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars, such as Schmithals,&lt;ref&gt;Schmithals, W., ''Paul and the Gnostics'' Transl. by J. Steely (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1972), 123–218&lt;/ref&gt; Eckhart,&lt;ref&gt;K. G. Eckart, "Der zweite echte Brief des Apostels Paulus an die Thessalonicher," ZThK (1961), 30–44&lt;/ref&gt; Demke&lt;ref&gt;''Theologie und Literarkritik im 1. Thessalonicherbrief''&lt;/ref&gt; and Munro,&lt;ref&gt;''The Later Stratum in 1 and 2 Thessalonians, Authority in Paul and Peter: The Identification of a Pastoral Stratum in the Pauline Corpus and 1 Peter''&lt;/ref&gt; have developed complicated theories involving [[redaction]] and interpolation in 1 and 2 Thessalonians.

===Audience===
{{See also|Early centers of Christianity}}
Paul claimed the title of the "Apostle to the Gentiles", and established [[gentile]] churches in several important cities in the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name = "Ehrman 2006"&gt;Ehrman, Bart. Peter, Paul, and Mary Magdalene: The Followers of Jesus in History and Legend. Oxford University Press, USA. 2006. {{ISBN|0-19-530013-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Bart D. Ehrman]], the [[Acts of the Apostles]] tells a different story of Paul's career,&lt;ref name = "Ehrman 2006"/&gt; but in this case it reports that, while there were "some" Jews converted during Paul's initial preaching in Thessalonica, the gentiles who were converted were "a large number" and the Jews as a body fiercely opposed Paul's work there.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|17:4–5|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Text===
Paul, speaking for himself, [[Silas]], and Timothy, gives thanks for the news about their faith and love; he reminds them of the kind of life he had lived while he was with them. Paul stresses how honorably he conducted himself, reminding them that he had worked to earn his keep, taking great pains not to burden anyone. He did this, he says, even though he could have used his status as an [[Apostle (Christian)|apostle]] to impose upon them.

Paul goes on to explain that the [[Resurrection of the dead|dead will be resurrected]] prior to those still living, and both groups will greet the Lord in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1 Thessalonians|4:13–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Deeds of King Stephen''''' or '''''Acts of Stephen''''' or '''''Gesta Regis Stephani''''' is a mid-12th-century [[English history]] by an anonymous author about King [[Stephen of England]] and his struggles with his cousin, [[Empress Matilda]], also known as the "Empress Maud".  It is one of the main sources for this period in the history of England.

Some historians think the author may have been [[Robert of Bath]] (also known as Robert of Lewes), [[Bishop of Bath]] from 1136 to 1166.&lt;ref name=BHOBath&gt;[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=34341 British History Online Bishops of Bath and Wells] accessed on September 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Huscroft200&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Gesta Stephani'' was first published in Paris in 1619, from a manuscript in the episcopal library at [[Laon]] which was subsequently lost. A fuller manuscript has recently been found, and since published, in the Municipal Library at [[Valenciennes]], having been transferred from the nearby abbey of Vicoigne. The Latin text tells in 120 chapters of [[the Anarchy]] of King Stephen's reign, and ends with the accession of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]].

== Background and authorship ==

The ''Gesta Stephani'' was written in two books and historian R.H.C. Davis believes that the first twelve years of Stephen's reign—which comprise book I—were written in about 1148, while the subsequent account, taken up to the accession of Henry II, was written after 1153.&lt;ref&gt;Potter "Introduction&amp;nbsp;— Authorship" ''Gesta Stephani'' pp. xx-xxi&lt;/ref&gt; Davis examined the places named in the texts and found that most of them were in the South-West of England; unusually detailed descriptions of [[Bristol]] and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], as well as scornful comments about the former, suggest that the author may have been writing in or near Bath. This contrasts with an earlier statement by K.R. Potter that there is "no clear indication of any local attachment". However, Davis points out that comparisons with the chronicles of other writers based elsewhere in the country reveal considerable south-west bias in the ''Gesta'', which had been overlooked by historians who compared it only with the account of [[William of Malmesbury]], who was also writing in the south-west.&lt;ref&gt;Potter "Introduction&amp;nbsp;— Authorship" ''Gesta Stephani'' pp. xxi-xxiv&lt;/ref&gt;

The authorship of the ''Gesta ''is not known.&lt;ref&gt;Davis "The Authorship of the ''Gesta Stephani''" ''English Historical Review'' 33 p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howlett ''Chronicles of the Reigns of Stephen, Henry II and Richard I'', p. viii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hushcroft ''Ruling England'' p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; According to Richard Howlett, writing in 1886, the author was not from a monastery,&lt;ref&gt;Howlett ''Chronicles of the Reigns of Stephen, Henry II and Richard I'' p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; and Davis agreed with this in his analysis of the author, because, while he does show a local bias, his knowledge of [[Exeter]], [[London]], [[Pevensey]] and [[Bedford]] all show that he was a man who travelled.&lt;ref&gt;Potter "Introduction&amp;nbsp;— Authorship" ''Gesta Stephani ''p. xxvi&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, he was not an itinerant, and his writing reveals little knowledge of the north or East of England or the leading baronial families in those parts of the kingdom, while he placed too much emphasis on the exploits of relatively minor barons associated with the south west, including the de Tracy family.&lt;ref&gt;Potter "Introduction&amp;nbsp;— Authorship" ''Gesta Stephani'' pp. xxvii-xxviii&lt;/ref&gt; The writer appears to have been a scholar, and his work omits dates and extraneous detail for the sake of literary effect, while employing classical terms to offices and positions rather than their [[Mediaeval Latin]] equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;Potter "Introduction&amp;nbsp;— Authorship" ''Gesta Stephani'' pp. xxix-xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars agree that he was a supporter of Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester.&lt;ref&gt;Potter "Introduction&amp;nbsp;— Authorship" ''Gesta Stephani'' p. xxxii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howlett ''Chronicles of the Reigns of Stephen, Henry II and Richard I'' pp. ix-x&lt;/ref&gt; However, historians differ over their exact relationship: Howlett suggested the author was Henry's chaplain,&lt;ref&gt;Howlett ''Chronicles of the Reigns of Stephen, Henry II and Richard I'' pp. x-xi&lt;/ref&gt; but Davis believes that the criticism he gave to Henry in the ''Gesta'' makes this unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;Potter "Introduction&amp;nbsp;— Authorship" ''Gesta Stephani'' pp. xxxii-xxxiii&lt;/ref&gt; Davis instead suggests that he was a bishop, based on his style of writing, his perspectives on the events he writes about and the places he visited; he goes further to speculate that it may have been Robert of Lewes, Bishop of Bath, who was the author.&lt;ref&gt;Potter "Introduction&amp;nbsp;— Authorship" ''Gesta Stephani'' pp. xxxiv-xxxviii&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Bartlett states that he was "perhaps" the author&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett ''England under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; and Hushcroft writes that it was written either by him "or someone close to him".&lt;ref&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manuscripts ==

Two manuscripts of the ''Gesta Stephani'' have been known to scholars, but one is now lost. The first, housed in the episcopal library at [[Laon]], was printed in the seventeenth century, but subsequently disappeared.

== Publication ==

A manuscript of the ''Gesta Stephani'' was discovered in the libraries of the bishop of Laon in the early seventeenth century, and was first printed in 1619 at [[Paris]] by the French historian [[André Duchesne]] (1584–1640) in ''Historia Normannorum Scriptores Antiqui''.{{refn|group=nb|This work includes the manuscript transcription of the ''Gesta Stephani'', printed in full from pp. 926-975.}} It was incomplete at that time,{{refn|group=nb|There were four gaps in the text, the end of Book II had fallen out and some of the pages were damaged to the point of illegibility.&lt;ref name="Potter-xi"&gt;Potter "Introduction&amp;nbsp;— The Text" ''Gesta Stephani'' p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;}} and was lost after Duchesne's death.&lt;ref name="Potter-xi"/&gt; This text was reprinted in England by [[Richard Clarke Sewell|R.C. Sewell]] (1803–1864) in 1846 and by Richard Howlett (1841–1917) in 1886; the latter has been praised for its improvements to Duchesne's version and its useful preface.&lt;ref name="Potter-xi"/&gt; There have been two translations of the work into English, the first being by Thomas Forester in ''Henry of Huntingdon'' in 1853 and then second by Joseph Stevenson (1806–1895) in ''The Church Historians of England'' in 1858.&lt;ref name="Potter-xi"/&gt;

Another manuscript was discovered in the Municipal Library, Valenciennes, by Professor [[Roger Mynors|R.A.B. Mynors]] (1903–1989), who found it included with a version of the ''Gesta Regum'' by [[William of Malmesbury]], catalogued in the library as MS 792. This new text continued the history of Stephen's reign up to 1154 and filled in the damaged passages which Duchesne was unable to transcribe.&lt;ref&gt;Potter "Introduction&amp;nbsp;— The Text" ''Gesta Stephani'' p. xii, xiv&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, this version was translated by K.R. Potter and published by Nelson's Mediaeval Texts, with an essay assessing it written by Dr [[Austin Lane Poole|A.L. Poole]] (1889–1963).&lt;ref&gt;Potter "Introduction&amp;nbsp;— The Text" ''Gesta Stephani'' pp. xiv-xv&lt;/ref&gt; It was reprinted in 1976 by [[Oxford University Press]] and included a new introduction by [[Ralph Henry Carless Davis|R.H.C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1216">'''Giga-updates per second''' (GUPS) is a measure of [[computer performance]]. GUPS is a measurement of how frequently a computer can issue updates to randomly generated [[Random-access memory|RAM]] locations. GUPS measurements stress the [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] and especially [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] capabilities of a machine. 

The BSS Random Access benchmark was proposed by IBM Research (Bhatotia, Sabharwal and Saxena at ACM/IEEE HiPC 2010) for measuring random memory access capability (GUPS) of multicores platforms. The new benchmark overcomes some of the major limitations (such as streaming access pattern, etc.) of the HPC Challenge Random Memory Access benchmark.

The '''Harrison Report''' was a July 1945 report carried out by United States lawyer [[Earl G. Harrison]] into the conditions of the [[displaced persons camps in post-World War II Europe]].

Harrison's report was part of the impetus for the creation of the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]] regarding [[Mandatory Palestine]], then under a [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British mandate]], which was formed to recommend policies for dealing with both Jewish war refugees and the problems of Palestine.&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;{{cite book|last=Stone|first=Dan|title=The Liberation of the Camps: The End of the Holocaust and Its Aftermath|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pKN7BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA181|date=5 May 2015|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-21603-5|quote= In order to try and mitigate these fears and to alleviate some of the ill-will that was disrupting US– UK relations in the wake of the Harrison Report, in November 1945 the British government set up the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry on Palestine (AACI) to investigate Harrison's claims.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the completion of the report, Truman sent a copy to British Prime Minister Clement Attlee, with respect to Britain’s responsibility for Palestine. Truman wrote "On the basis of this and other information which has come to me I concur in the belief that no other single matter is so important for those who have known the horrors of concentration camps for over a decade as is the future of immigration possibilities into Palestine."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/president-truman-letter-to-attlee-concerning-resettlement-of-jewish-refugees-in-palestine-november-1945 JVL], 31 August 1945&lt;/ref&gt; 

The British responded negatively to the report; they blamed Zionist pressure for the report's conclusion regarding Palestine, and suggested that the United States should also take a share of the refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Penkower, 2016, pages 56–58: "The official British response could be foretold. Truman’s 24 July request of Churchill had already set Near East specialist Beeley’s teeth on edge, indicating to him that the Zionists had been “deploringly successful in selling the idea” that, even after Allied victory, immigration to Palestine represented for many Jews “their only hope for survival.” Wishing to avoid a postwar influx of Jews into Palestine, the Foreign Office’s Refugee Department had expressed the fear in March 1944 that British trials of Germans on charges of crimes against humanity committed against Jews would convince survivors not to return to their native countries after the war. Whitehall’s expert on refugees, Ian Henderson, was convinced that the Zionists were behind Harrison’s recommendations. British military authorities in Germany rejected Harrison’s criticism, claiming that Jews were being treated exactly like all other displaced persons... In Bevin’s mind, Harrison’s report was “not based on real investigation.” Bevin told Weizmann that Truman was merely trying to gain votes by his stance; the United States had to take its share of those Jews who must be removed from Europe."&lt;/ref&gt; Attlee wanted the report kept confidential, but his request was ignored.{{sfn|Haron|1986|pp=28–29}}

==Appointment and scope==

[[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] appointed Harrison as the U.S. representative on the Intergovernmental Commission on Refugees on March 15, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=E.G. Harrison Appointed|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1945/03/16/84628567.pdf |accessdate=July 16, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 16, 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 18, the [[Jewish Agency]] in [[Mandatory Palestine]] sent a detailed and strongly worded memo to the British authorities requesting 100,000 immigration permits for [[Sh'erit ha-Pletah|Jewish displaced persons (DPs)]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Penkower, 2016, p.22: “On 18 June, Shertok had officially requested [[High Commissioners for Palestine and Transjordan|Palestine High Commissioner]] [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort|Lord Gort]], in light of the unprecedented “campaign of extermination” that had destroyed more than six million European Jews, for 100,000 immigration permits (25 percent for children) to be placed immediately at the agency’s disposal. A detailed memorandum indicated that a settlement of this size was not only practicable, but it would generally benefit the economic structure of the country.” (Penkower cites: 39Shertok to Gort, 18 June 1945, Jewish Agency confidential files, Zionist Archives, New York City (now in the CZA))&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 22, two months after Roosevelt’s death, [[Harry S Truman|President Truman]] asked Harrison to conduct an inspection tour of camps holding displaced persons (DPs) in Europe, on the urging of outgoing [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]]{{sfn|Königseder|Wetzel|2001|p=31}} Harrison was asked to inquire into the conditions and needs of those among the displaced persons in the liberated countries of Western Europe and in [[Allied-occupied Germany]] and [[Allied-occupied Austria]] with particular reference to the Jewish refugees who may possibly be stateless or non-repatriable:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|Harrison Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(1) the conditions under which displaced persons and particularly those who may be stateless or non-repatriable are at present living, especially in Germany and Austria,&lt;br&gt;
(2) the needs of such persons,&lt;br&gt;
(3) how those needs are being met at present by the military authorities, the governments of residence and international and private relief bodies, and &lt;br&gt;
(4) the views of the possibly non-repatriable persons as to their future destinations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Harrison left in early July as the head of a small delegation, including two representatives of the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]], Joseph J. Schwartz and Herbert Katzki, the latter also of the [[War Refugee Board]], and [[Patrick Murphy Malin]] of the Intergovernmental Committee for Refugees.{{sfn|Königseder|Wetzel|2001|p=31}} The group split up to visit approximately thirty DP camps; Schwartz went to the camps in Northern Germany whilst Harrison visited the US camps in Austria and Bavaria.{{sfn|Königseder|Wetzel|2001|p=31}}

==The Report==

The report was dated August 24.&lt;ref name=waiting&gt;{{harvnb|Königseder|Wetzel|2001|pp=31ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; It blamed U.S. military authorities for the horrible conditions it described:&lt;ref name=waiting/&gt;

{{quote|Many Jewish displaced persons ... are living under guard behind barbed-wire fences ... including some of the most notorious concentration camps ... had no clothing other than their concentration camp garb.... Most of them have been separated three, four or five years and they cannot understand why the liberators should not have undertaken immediately the organized effort to re-unite family groups.... Many of the buildings ... are clearly unfit for winter....}}

Harrison contrasted these conditions with the relative normal life led by the nearby German populations and wondered at the contrast:&lt;ref name=waiting/&gt;

{{quote|We appear to be treating the Jews as the Nazis treated them except that we do not exterminate them. They are in concentration camps in large numbers under our military guard instead of S.S. troops. One is led to wonder whether the German people, seeing this, are not supposing that we are following or at least condoning Nazi policy.}}

He wrote that to date U.S. authorities were handing DPs in traditional ways as national groups, but that conditions and the history of Nazi anti-Semitism required recognition of the distinct identity of these DPs:&lt;ref name=waiting/&gt;

{{quote|The first and plainest need of these people is a recognition of their actual status and by this I mean their status as Jews.... Refusal to recognize the Jews as such has the effect, in this situation, of closing one's eyes to their former and more barbaric persecution.}}

===Palestine===

He recommended to the President that 100,000 DPs in those camps be permitted to resettle in Palestine.&lt;ref name=waiting/&gt; Truman forwarded the report to General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], Commander of U.S. Forces in Europe. Eisenhower responded promptly with a series of measures that segregated Jewish DPs, found housing even if it meant displacing German locals, increased rations, and preference in employment, perhaps aided by information about the Report's contents before it reached Truman.&lt;ref name=waiting/&gt; Another immediate result of Harrison's recommendations was the appointment of an adviser on Jewish affairs to the U.S. Army with the rank of major-general, based on the recommendation of several Jewish organizations to the secretary of war. Rabbi Judah P. Nadich was the first, followed in October 1945 by [[Simon H. Rifkind]], a New York City judge and municipal official.&lt;ref name=waiting/&gt; Finally, the ''Report'' focused the attention of the Truman and the U.S. military on the Jewish DPs. Truman wrote to Eisenhower on August 31:&lt;ref name=waiting/&gt;

{{quote|I know you will agree with me that we have a particular responsibility toward these victims of persecution and tyranny who are in our zone. We must make clear to the German people that we thoroughly abhor the Nazi policies of hatred and persecution. We have no better opportunity to demonstrate this than by the manner in which we ourselves actually treat the survivors remaining in Germany.}}

It also highlighted Palestine as the solution and British control of immigration there as a crucial barrier.&lt;ref name=waiting/&gt;

==Response==

Eisenhower replied to the Harrison Report with a lengthy update to Truman in mid-October, explaining changes in conditions and contesting Harrison's assertion, in Eisenhower's words, that "our military guards are now substituting for SS troops". He wrote that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Text of Eisenhower's Letter to Truman on Displaced Persons|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1945/10/17/94025350.pdf|accessdate=July 16, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 17, 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Mr. Harrison's report gives little regard to the problems faced, the real successes attained in saving the lives of thousands of Jewish and other concentration camp victims and repatriating those who could and wished to be repatriated, and the progress made in two months to bring these unfortunates who remained under our jurisdiction from the depths of physical degeneration to a condition of health and essential comfort.}}

Harrison responded in a radio address the next day that what Eisenhower viewed as improvements fell far short of what was required: "The point is that they shouldn't be in any camps at all, but in houses. Shifting them from one camp to another can hardly be said to be liberation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Harrison Strikes Back|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1945/10/18/94025991.pdf|accessdate=July 16, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 18, 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

Harrison's report was part of the impetus for the creation of the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]] on Palestine, which was formed to recommend policies for dealing with both Jewish war refugees and the problems of Palestine.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt; Harrison campaigned on behalf of his proposal in the months that followed, testifying in January 1946 before the Anglo-American Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Palestine Board to Hear Harrison|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1946/01/06/305574362.pdf|accessdate=July 16, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 6, 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, the ''[[New York Times]]'' called Harrison's work "the first official proposal for the immediate settlement of 100,000 Jews in Palestine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fraternity Honors Dean|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1946/05/03/109352711.pdf |accessdate=July 16, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 3, 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison's report has been credited by some historians as a crucial step in the development of United States support for the [[State of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schnader.com/files/Uploads/Documents/post-holocaust.pdf Harry Reicher, "The Post-Holocaust World and President Harry S. Truman: The Harrison Report and Immigration Law and Policy"], accessed July 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In June he called for the [[United Nations]] to create an agency to address the problems of those uprooted by war, many now stateless, and he thought Latin America might welcome many of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.N. Urged to Plan World Agency to Deal with Displaced Persons|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1946/06/15/107135368.pdf |accessdate=July 16, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=June 15, 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Foreign Secretary [[Ernest Bevin]] referred to the report in a speech to the House of Commons, a week after the [[London Conference of 1946–47]] – Britain's last attempt to negotiate peace in Palestine – failed. In the speech, he blamed the Harrison Report for the ill feeling which ensued:&lt;ref&gt;[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1947/feb/25/palestine-government-policy [PALESTINE (GOVERNMENT POLICY)], HC Deb 25 February 1947 vol 433 cc1901–2007&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; But I think we might have been able to do more for the Jews, and have increased this rate at that time, if the bitterness of feeling which surrounds this problem of immigration had not been increased by American pressure for the immediate admission of 100,000. I do not desire to create any ill feeling with the United States; in fact, I have done all I can to promote the best possible relations with them, as with other countries, but I should have been happier if they had had regard to the fact that we were the Mandatory Power, and that we were carrying the responsibility and if they had only waited to ask us what we were doing. Then we could have informed them. But, instead of that, a person named Earl Harrison went out to their zone in Germany collecting certain information, and a report was issued. I must say it really destroyed the basis of good feeling that we—the Colonial Secretary and I—were endeavouring to produce in the Arab States, and it set the whole thing back.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''''International Encyclopedia of Human Geography''''' is a 2009 academic [[reference work]] covering [[human geography]]. The [[editors-in-chief]] are Rob Kitchin and [[Nigel Thrift]] and it contains a foreword by [[Mary Robinson]].

== Controversy ==
The development of the encyclopedia has been subject to episodic controversy resulting from the involvement of a subsidiary of Elsevier's parent company [[Reed Elsevier]] – called Spearhead Exhibitions – in the [[Defense (military)|defence]] exhibition industry. Following a high-profile campaign coordinated on the crit-geog-forum mailing list and focused specifically on a perceived conflict of interest between the arms trade and academic publishing, on June 1, 2007 Reed Elsevier announced that it would be exiting the business during the second half of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reed Elsevier confirms it will exit the defence industry shows |url=http://investing.reuters.co.uk/news/articleinvesting.aspx?type=allBreakingNews&amp;storyID=2007-06-01T111235Z_01_L01353160_RTRIDST_0_REEDELSEVIER-DEFENCE.XML|date=2007-06-01}}{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lansdowne House''' is a building to the southwest of [[Berkeley Square]] in the [[City of Westminster]], England, much of which is now demolished. It has been owned by three [[British prime minister]]s, and some of its 18th-century interiors, among the best in London, were removed and re-installed elsewhere. The surviving part of the house was granted Grade II* [[Listed Building]] status in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1066795 National Heritage List for England]&lt;/ref&gt;

The surviving part of the historic house is now the home of the [[Lansdowne Club]].

==History==
It was designed by [[Robert Adam]] as a private house for [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute]] but in 1763 he sold it unfinished to [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne]] (both men became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]). Shelburne retained Adam until 1771, when his wife died, with parts of the decoration still incomplete.  [[George Dance the Younger]] &lt;!-- presumably, given dates - check --&gt;and [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]] later worked on the house.

From 1763 to 1929 it belonged to the Petty-FitzMaurice family, [[Marquesses of Lansdowne]]. In 1931 part of the original house was demolished to allow a new road to be built. Since 1935, part of it has been the home of the [[Lansdowne Club]]. The positioning of the property was rather unusual. It had a large front garden occupying the whole of the southern side of the square, which it faced side on. This arrangement gave [[Devonshire House]] on [[Piccadilly]] an open aspect behind as far as the square.

Famous former owners or residents of Lansdowne House include:

* [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute]], [[British prime minister]] (1762–63)
* [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne]] (later 1st [[Marquess of Lansdowne]]), British prime minister (1782–83)
* [[William Pitt the Younger]], British prime minister (1783–1801, 1804–1806)
* [[William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor]], Richest man in America at the time (1891–1893)
* [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery]], was a British Liberal statesman and Prime Minister (1894–1895)
* [[Harry Gordon Selfridge]], founder of the [[Selfridges]] [[department store]]

==Partial demolition and dispersal==
[[File:1766-75 Lansdowne House.TIF|thumb|left|Interior of a drawing room, now installed in the Philadelphia Museum of Art]]
In the 1930s, the [[Metropolitan Borough of Westminster]] Council decided to construct a road link from Berkeley Square to [[Curzon Street]], which required the demolition of all the front rooms of Lansdowne House. One of Adam's three [[drawing room]]s was removed and installed at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], while the Dining Room went to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/44332.html Drawing Room from Lansdowne House] with elements by Robert Adam, [[Antonio Zucchi]], [[Giovanni Battista Cipriani]], and [[Joseph Perfetti]] on the website of the Philadelphia Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt; The facade was rebuilt in a modified form at the front of the reduced house.

Much of the house's collections, such as the [[Amazon statue types#Lansdowne Amazon|Lansdowne Amazon]] and the [[Lansdowne Hercules]], were also bought by American and British museums.  Other objects were transferred to [[Bowood House]], the Lansdowne country house, where Adam also worked. This remains in the family, though large parts of it were also demolished, in 1956.

A large office block was built on the front garden on the southern edge of the square at what is now Nos. 55–59 Berkeley Square. This new building inherited the name of the old house, while the address No. 9 [[Fitzmaurice Place]] still points to the original location, where the Lansdowne Club is now undergoing extensive renovations begun in 2000.  On 1 May 1935, the Lansdowne Club opened as a 'social, residential and athletic Club for members of social standing…'.  This includes some of the 18th-century rooms, with others added in the 1930s in [[Art Deco]] style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lansdowneclub.com/Home/About-the-Club.aspx "About the Club", Lansdowne Club (with old photos)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lettre de cachet (1703).jpg|thumb|A ''lettre de cachet'' of 1703 (reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]), opening ''De par le roy'' ("In the name of the King...")]]
'''''Lettres de cachet''''' ({{IPA-fr|lɛtʁ də kaʃɛ}}, lit. "letters of the sign/signet") were letters signed by the [[List of French monarchs|king of France]], [[Countersign (legal)|countersigned]] by one of his ministers, and closed with the [[royal seal]], or ''cachet''. They contained orders directly from the king, often to enforce arbitrary actions and judgments that could not be [[appeal]]ed.

In the case of organized bodies, 'lettres de cachet’ were issued for the purpose of preventing assembly or accomplishing some other definite act.  The provincial estates were convoked (called to assembly) in this manner, and it was by a ''lettre de cachet'' (in this case, a ''lettre de jussipri''), or by showing in person in a ''[[lit de justice]]'', that the king ordered a ''[[parlement]]'' to register a law despite that parlement's refusal to pass it.

The best-known ''lettres de cachet'', however, were penal, by which a subject was imprisoned without [[trial (law)|trial]] and without an opportunity of defense (after inquiry and due diligence by the Lieutenant De Police) in a state prison or an ordinary jail, confinement in a [[convent]] or the [[General Hospital of Paris]], transportation to the colonies, or expulsion to another part of the realm, or from the realm altogether. The Lettres were mainly used against drunkards, troublemakers, prostitutes, squanderers of family fortune, or insane persons. The wealthy sometimes petitioned such ''lettres'' to dispose of inconvenient individuals, especially to prevent unequal marriages (nobles with commoners), or to prevent a scandal (the Lettre could prevent court cases that might otherwise dishonour a family).

In this respect, the ''lettres de cachet'' were a prominent symbol of the abuses of the ''[[ancien régime]]'' [[monarchy]], and as such were suppressed during the [[French Revolution]]. In 1789 and 1790, all cases were revised by a commission which confirmed most of the sentences. Historian  [[Claude Quétel]] has interpreted these confirmations as indicating that the Lettres were not as arbitrary and unjust as they have been represented after the Revolution,&lt;ref&gt;Claude Quetel, ''Les lettres de cachet - une légende noire''&lt;/ref&gt; and he hence speaks of a [[Black Legend|''Légende noire'']].&lt;ref&gt;a Black Legend is set of historical exaggerations construed to darken the memory of a historical period&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Bastille lettre 1759.jpg|thumb|''Lettre de cachet'' ordering [[Jean-François Marmontel]]'s detention at the Bastille, signed by [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] and [[Louis Phélypeaux, comte de Saint-Florentin|minister Louis Phélypeaux]] in 1759]]
The power to issue ''lettres de cachet'' was a royal privilege recognized by the French monarchic civil law that developed during the 13th century, as the [[House of Capet|Capetian monarchy]] overcame its initial distrust of [[Roman law]]. The principle can be traced to a maxim which furnished a text of the ''[[Pandects]]'' of [[Justinian I|Justinian]]: in their Latin version, "''Rex solutus est a legibus''", or "The king is released from the laws."  "The French legal scholars interpreted the imperial office of the Justinian code in a generic way and arrived at the conclusion that every 'king is an emperor in his own kingdom,' that is, he possesses the prerogatives of legal [[Political absolutism|absolutism]] that the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' attributes to the Roman emperor."&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman F. Cantor]], ''The Civilization of the Middle Ages'' 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

This meant that when the king intervened directly, he could decide without heeding the laws, and even contrary to the laws. This was an early conception, and in early times the order in question was simply verbal; some [[letters patent]] of Henry III of France in 1576  state that [[François de Montmorency]] was "prisoner in our castle of the [[Bastille]] in [[Paris]] by verbal command" of the late king [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]].

In the 14th century the principle was introduced that the order should be written, and hence arose the ''lettre de cachet''. The ''lettre de cachet'' belonged to the class of ''[[Letters close|lettres closes]]'', as opposed to ''[[Letters patent|lettres patentes]]'', which contained the expression of the legal and permanent will of the king, and had to be furnished with the seal of state affixed by the [[chancellor]].

The ''lettres de cachet'', on the contrary, were signed simply by a secretary of state for the king; they bore merely the imprint of the king's privy seal, from which circumstance they were often called, in the 14th and 15th centuries, ''lettres de petit signet'' or ''lettres de petit cachet'', and were entirely exempt from the control of the chancellor.

==As a tool==
While serving the [[Forms of government|government]] as a silent weapon against political adversaries{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} or controversial writers{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} and as a means of punishing culprits of high birth without the scandal of a lawsuit, the ''lettres de cachet'' had many other uses. They were employed by the police in dealing with prostitutes, and on their authority lunatics were shut up in hospitals and sometimes in prisons.

They were also often used by heads of families as a means of correction, for example, for protecting the family honour from the disorderly or criminal conduct of sons. The case of the [[Marquis de Sade]] (imprisoned 1777–1790 under a ''lettre de cachet'' obtained by his wealthy and influential mother-in-law) is a prominent example. Wives, too, took advantage of them to curb the profligacy of husbands and vice versa.

In reality, the secretary of state had a delegation, and could issue them at his own discretion, and in most cases the king was unaware of their issue. In the 18th century it is certain that the letters were often issued blank, i.e. without containing the name of the person against whom they were directed; the recipient, or [[mandatary]], filled in the name in order to make the letter effective.

==Protests==
Protests against the ''lettres de cachet'' were made continually by the ''[[parlement]]'' of [[Paris]] and by the provincial ''parlements'', and also by the [[Estates General (France)|Estates-General]]. In 1648, during the [[Fronde]], the sovereign courts of Paris,&lt;ref&gt;Parlement,  Chambre des comptes, Cour des Aides, Grand Conseil together&lt;/ref&gt; by their ''Arrêt d'Union'', procured their momentary suppression in a kind of charter of liberties which they imposed upon the crown, but which was short-lived.

It was not until the reign of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] that a reaction against the abuse became clearly perceptible. At the beginning of that reign [[Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes|Malesherbes]] during his short ministry endeavoured to infuse some measure of [[justice]] into the system, and in March 1784 the [[Louis Auguste Le Tonnelier de Breteuil|baron de Breteuil]], a minister of the king's household, addressed a circular to the intendants and the lieutenant of police with a view to preventing the most serious abuses connected with the issue of ''lettres de cachet''.

The [[Comte de Mirabeau]] wrote a scathing indictment of ''lettres de cachet'' while imprisoned in the dungeon of [[Vincennes]] (by ''lettre de cachet'' obtained by his father). The treatise was published after his liberation in 1782 under the title ''Les Lettres de cachet et des prisons d'etat'' and was widely read throughout Europe.

In Paris, in 1779, the [[Cour des Aides]] demanded their suppression, and in March 1788 the parlement of Paris made some exceedingly energetic remonstrances, which are important for the light they throw upon old French public law. The crown, however, did not decide to lay aside this weapon, and in a declaration to the States-General in the royal session of June 23, 1789 (art. 15) it did not renounce it absolutely.

==Abolition and reinstatement==
''Lettres de cachet'' were abolished after the [[French Revolution]] by the Constituent Assembly, but [[Napoleon]] reestablished their penal equivalent by a political measure in the decree of 8 March 1801 on the state prisons. This is all the more striking, given that Napoleon had pushed for measures ensuring the [[rule of law]] in the [[Napoleonic Code|codes]] of laws adopted under his rule. This action was one of the acts brought up against him by the senatus-consulte of 3 April 1814, which pronounced his fall "considering that he has violated the constitutional laws by the decrees on the state prisons."

==Victims of Lettre de cachet==
* [[Charles Simon Favart]] (because a nobleman was interested in his wife)
* [[Luke Joseph Hooke]] (deprived of his academic chair in theology for awarding a Ph.D. to a candidate without having read the (heretical) thesis.)
* [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau]] (several times, on request of his father, as protection against creditors and once to prevent a death penalty for kidnapping and eloping with a married woman)
* [[Marguerite Monvoisin]] (complicity in a [[Affair of the Poisons|poisoning affair]]. A Lettre de cachet was used to avoid scandal that might have affected [[Françoise-Athénaïs,_marquise_de_Montespan|highly placed accomplices]]).
* [[Pigault-Lebrun]] (twice, for eloping with two successive young women)
* [[Alexandre Balthazar Laurent Grimod de La Reynière]] (misconduct: sent away to an abbey by his father)
* [[Marquis de Sade]] (rape and torture. The Lettre was petitioned by the marquis' wife, to avoid a court case)
* [[Comte de Sanois]] (domestic disputes and debt. His wife petitioned a Lettre, claiming her husband insane)
* [[Voltaire]] (once for slander, a second time for violent menaces against the Prince de Rohan)
* [[Jean-François Marmontel]], accused to be the author of a satire against the duke d'Aumont. His account of his short stay in the Bastille contains a description of the food he received, the room he was imprisoned with his servant, and the goodwill shown to him.
* [[Giacomo Casanova]] (dueling)
* [[Marie-Anne de La Ville]] (practiced black magic. A scandalous trial was avoided by a Lettre)
* [[Jean-Baptiste Forqueray]] (request of his father)

==In literature==
* [[Honoré Mirabeau]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=b1sGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Des Lettres de Cachet et des prisons d'état''] ([[Hamburg]], 1782), written in the dungeon at [[Vincennes]] into which his father had thrown him by a ''lettre de cachet'', one of the ablest and most eloquent of his works, which had an immense circulation and was translated into [[English language|English]]  in 1788.
* [[Doctor Alexandre Manette]], in [[Dickens]]' ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', was thrown into the [[Bastille]] prison by means of a ''lettre de cachet''. In addition, [[Charles Darnay]] suspected that his uncle, a marquis, would have used a ''lettre de cachet'' to put Darnay himself into prison if it weren't for the fact that the Marquis had fallen out of favour with the royal court.

[[File:Impasto-Oinochoe of etruscan Potter Mamarce in Würzburg (4).jpg|thumb|Mamarce Oinochoe, Würzburg]]
The '''Mamarce [[Oinochoe]]''' is an [[Etruscan civilisation|Etruscan]] vessel of art historical significance which is dated to around 640/20 BC. Today the oinochoe is kept in [[Martin von Wagner Museum]] in [[Würzburg]], where it has the inventory number ''H 5724''.

==Description and style==
Not including the handle, it has a height of 20.5 centimetres and a maximum diameter of 11.6 centimetres. The spout of the vessel widens slightly from the concave neck. Features such as its trefoil mouth, truncated column neck, pear-shaped body, low disk-shaped foot and strap handle indicate a fairly advanced stage of development, on which account it should be dated to the second or third quarter of the seventh century, probably between 640 and 620.

In many respects, the Oinochoe of the Mamarce potter combines several cultural traditions together. Firstly, the vessel is a work in the [[Impasto (pottery)|impasto]] style which was typical of the [[Villanova culture]]. As was the norm, very fine-grained clay was used and it was turned on a [[potter's wheel]], not just moulded by hand. The surface was polished in the manner of prehistoric art. The shape is known among scholars as [[bucchero]] impasto and prefigures later Bucchero pottery. Thus, the oinochoe stands in the transition between the Villanova culture and that of the Etruscans.

==Imagery and motifs==
[[File:Impasto-Oinochoe of etruscan Potter Mamarce in Würzburg (5).jpg|thumb|left|Incised decoration of the oinochoe]]
Images were incised on the oinochoe and red filling was pressed into the incisions, some traces of which still remain. This incised decoration suggests the oinochoe comes from the [[Falisci]] or [[Falerii]] area, but it might also come from the neighbouring settlement of [[Veii]]. The incisions depict a warrior who is flanked by a horse on the right and by a goat suckling its kid on the left (both goats missing their fourth leg). Above the goats there were two waterfowl. The engraver equipped the bearded warrior with helmet, greaves and belt and depicted him with his legs spread as if he were dancing.

The depiction of a human figure flanked by animals has a parallel in the common eastern motif of the master of animals. While the master of animals motif originates in the east, it is common in Greece; a form with horses is native to [[Corinth]] and goats might indicate [[Euboea]]n influence. If the image derives from the master of animals motif, then the depiction of a suckling goat is most unusual - we would expect two horses. Even more unusual is the fact that the goat is looking away from the warrior. The waterfowl would have to be explained as Villanovan influence.

==Inscription==
On the right side, stretching over the horse to the warrior is an incised inscription in [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] which reads from right to left, saying ''mi mamarce zinace''. ''Mi'' is the [[Grammatical person|first person]] [[number (grammar)|singular]] [[nominative case|nominative]] [[pronoun]], ''mamarce'' is a male name in the [[nominative-accusative]] or [[locative case]] and ''zinace'' is a past active verb meaning "made". Because Mamarce only states his first name, it is assumed that he belonged to a lower social class. The name Mamerce is [[Italic languages|Italic]], appearing in [[Latin language|Latin]] as [[Mamercus (praenomen)|Mamercus]] and connected with ''Mamers'', the [[Oscan language|Oscan]] name of the god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]. That the potter who bore this name was himself ethnically Italiote need not follow.

==Writing==
He has written the novels ''Capital Castles'' (Pacific Writers Press, 2000), ''Cloud Castles'' (Pacific Writers Press, 1998), ''Cardboard Castles'' (Pacific Writers Press, 1996) and ''Bombay California'' (Pacific Writers Press, 1994). He has recently completed a novel in three books titled, The Posthumous Memoirs of Blase Kubash. He has also written several collections of short stories, including Dante's Foil &amp; Other Sporting Tales, (Black Scat Press), and ''Secret Histories: Borges’ Travel, Hemingway’s Garage ([[Fiction Collective 2]], 2005) which was published in fall, 2009 in Spanish by Thule Ediciones, Barcelona as ''Viajes Borges, Talleres Hemingway''.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thuleediciones.com/search/ |title=Thule Ediciones}}&lt;/ref&gt; His translation of Balzac’s play, Mercadet, was reissued in 2016 as Waiting For Godeau, by Black Scat Press and his collection of plays will be published by Black Scat in 2017.

Of his fiction, Luisa Valenzuela said, “A different voice in North American Writing…a very special, poignant sense of humor.”&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The itinerant scholar’s voracious appetite to find meaning in life led him to travel the world early on, and this theme of the eternal wanderer is seen in his novel ''Bombay California''. In his review of ''Bombay California; or, Hollywood Somewhere West of Vine'', Giose Rimanelli wrote, “…in the grand tradition of such Latin American fabulists as [[Machado de Assis]], [[Borges]], [[Cortázar]], and [[García Márquez]], Axelrod manipulates the novel form to present not just a [[fin-de-siècle]] statement on the political and social fabric of the United States, but a satire on Hollywood films, American television, American folklore, American advertising, American education, the United States presidency, Ronald Reagan, publishing prejudices, "literary" agent incompetence, plus a panoply of gibes, jabs, and gestures at American culture in general. Chapter 33, for example, titled "An Agent's Tools," is nothing other than an order slip one might get at any fast-food restaurant. Chapter 49, titled "Wanted Dead or Alive," is a "wanted" poster of someone who looks a lot like [[Ronald Reagan]] for, among other things, stealing a script that Katz had written about the presidency.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/eds/detail?sid=d4779330-64a4-48e1-a4bd-a064d1ce4200%40sessionmgr114&amp;vid=3&amp;hid=110&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVkcy1saXZl#db=hft&amp;AN=509525371 |title=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Mark+Axelrod%27s+%27Bombay+California%27%3A+a+feature+novel.-a016870635 |title=The Free Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 2009 he has contributed a blog on Huffington Post.com.

'''Martin Burns''' (February 15, 1861 – January 8, 1937) was an American world wrestling champion "[[Catch wrestling|catch-as-catch-can]]" [[wrestler]] as well as wrestling coach and teacher. Born in [[Cedar County, Iowa]] he started wrestling as a teenager and made money traveling around the Midwest wrestling in carnivals and fairs. As a [[professional]] he claimed the [[American Heavyweight Championship]] by defeating Evan "Strangler" Lewis in 1895 and held the title for two years. Martin Burns himself claimed to have wrestled in more than 6,000 matches and is said to have lost only seven.&lt;ref&gt;The Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum, Martin “Farmer” Burns  {{cite web |url=http://www.pwhf.org/halloffamers/bios/burns.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516044449/http://www.pwhf.org/halloffamers/bios/burns.asp |archivedate=May 16, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of his active wrestling career he started a successful wrestling school in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]] and later coached [[Cedar Rapids]]' Washington high school to the very first Iowa  high school state wrestling tournament title. He died in [[Council Bluffs]] in 1937. In 2001 Martin "Farmer" Burns was inducted into the International Wrestling Institute and Museum [[Hall of Fame]]. He was also inducted into the [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame]] in 2002. The Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame inducted Martin Burns in 2003.

==Childhood==
Martin Burns was born on February 15, 1861, in a log cabin on a farm in Cedar County, Iowa. Growing up amidst the Civil War, Burns was exposed at an early age to the sport of wrestling, which was a preferred activity among the soldiers while stationed in camp. Consequently, the sport’s popularity further increased during the 1860s, and many historians also speculate that the added interest may be due to the fact that President [[Abraham Lincoln]] had himself been a champion wrestler in his younger years (it is documented that Lincoln once beat the Louisiana State Champion in New Salem, LA in 1831).{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Burns wrestled impromptu matches as a child; and at age 8, he tossed an older rival to claim a fifteen cent prize. His father died when he was 11, leaving him to support his mother, brother, and five sisters. To earn money, Burns worked at a nearby farm for $12 per month; and while he received little schooling, it was this physical labor that enabled Burns to develop his tremendous physical strength. He also spent time working in grading camps, where he competed in regular competitions against rugged strongmen. However, while these men focused on brute strength, Burns spent much time meticulously perfecting the strategies and techniques of catch wrestling, which is a grappling style where various holds and tactics are used with the intent to either submit or pin both opponent’s shoulders to the ground at once. Therefore, the combination of Burns’ superior conditioning, intellect, and advanced skill made him a nearly unbeatable wrestling opponent.

==Early career==
By 1880, Martin Burns had developed a formidable reputation; and at 19, he wrestled his first match against a professional grappler when he battled David Grafft to a 2-hour and 19 minute draw. He then honed his skills against the top pro wrestlers of the day, losing decisions to Henry Clayton and Tom Connors in 1886 and 1887 respectively. The defeat to Clayton particularly irked Burns, as he was unable to offset the feared stranglehold that subsequently earned Clayton the moniker Evan “Strangler” Lewis (long before the more famous Ed “Strangler” Lewis was ever born). Consequently, Burns launched into a rigorous program of neck development; and soon built an immense 20” neck that possessed such strength that he could be dropped six feet on a hangman’s noose to no effect (a stunt that Burns would often perform at carnivals and fairs).

While on a trip to Chicago in the spring of 1889, Burns saw a sign offering $25 to anyone who could last fifteen minutes against top grapplers Jack Carleek and Evan Lewis. Burns accepted the challenge and showed up at the Olympic Theater dressed in his regular farmer’s overalls. Consequently, the event’s announcer introduced Martin to the crowd as “Farmer” Burns; and the “Farmer” promptly made a monkey out of Carleek, throwing him across the stage before being declared the winner after fifteen minutes. The next challenge was Burns’ much-awaited rematch against Evan “Strangler” Lewis, who was now the reigning Catch-as-Catch-Can Heavyweight Champion, having defeated Joe Acton on March 14, 1887. However, fifteen minutes proved not enough time for Lewis to throw Burns; and again, the unknown “Farmer” was declared the winner and was subsequently lauded as a wrestling hero the next day in Chicago newspapers.

[[File:Burns03-05-70-sprawl.jpg|thumb|180px|Reverse Back-body-hold as illustrated in ''Lessons in Wrestling &amp; Physical Culture'' by Martin Burns.]]

==American Champion==
Following Farmer Burns’ emergence as a premier grappler, he traveled the country, taking on the greatest wrestlers of the day, while also beating all comers at carnivals. Though he weighed just 165 pounds, he regularly defeated men who outweighed him by as much as 50-100 pounds. At the time, professional catch-as-catch-can (freestyle) wrestling often used no time limit, and a match was usually decided when a wrestler “threw” his opponent to the ground. However, Burns became known as the master of the pinfall, as he perfected the art of trapping his opponents’ shoulders to the mat while contriving such dangerous maneuvers as the full and half-nelson, hammerlock, double-wrist lock, chicken wing, and a variety of submission toe holds.

Farmer Burns soon encountered the renowned [[Sorakichi Matsuda]], who is regarded as Japan’s first-ever pro wrestler, and who had been a top challenger to World Wrestling Champions William Muldoon and Ernest Roeber during the previous decade. The two faced off in Troy, NY on May 13, 1891, and Burns scored his biggest win yet when he pinned Matsuda in just four minutes. As a result, Farmer Burns soon became known as the world’s premier all-around grappler; and between 1890–93, he never lost a single fall. Then, on March 2, 1893, Evan Lewis was recognized as wrestling’s American Heavyweight Champion when he beat Ernest Roeber to unify the American Greco-Roman Title with the Catch-As-Catch-Can Championship. This set up yet another rematch between Farmer Burns and Strangler Lewis; and on April 20, 1895, Burns pinned Lewis to capture the title. Burns would go on to reign as wrestling’s American Champion for two years until he was finally beaten by Dan McLeod and [[Tom Jenkins (wrestler)|Tom Jenkins]] in 1897.

==Retirement and Post-Career==
Nevertheless, Farmer Burns’ greatest contribution to wrestling’s evolution may be as a trainer. He opened a gymnasium in Rock Island, Illinois in 1893, and helped to establish schools that enlightened young grapplers to the world of catch wrestling. In 1899, Burns defeated a 21-year-old Iowan named [[Frank Gotch]], but he recognized his raw talent and recruited him as his prized student. Burns would then mold Gotch into perhaps the greatest wrestling champion of all-time, as he defeated George Hackenschmidt in 1908 to claim the undisputed World Heavyweight Title. In addition, Farmer Burns also served as a teacher to a myriad of grapplers who would transform the sport in the early 1900s, including future [[List of early world heavyweight champions in professional wrestling|World Champion]] [[Earl Caddock]], future [[Middleweight]] [[World Champion]] and [[Champion]] [[Wrestler]] of the A.E.F. [[Ralph Parcaut]], as well as creative pioneer Joseph “Toots” Mondt. Other big names he personally trained included [[Rudy Dusek]], [[Joe Malcewicz]], [[Emil Klank]], [[Jess Westergaard]], [[Fred Beell]] and [[Jack Sherry]]. It is said he trained more than 1,600 wrestlers in all.&lt;ref&gt;Hornbaker, Tim, Farmer Burns Wrestling History http://www.legacyofwrestling.com/FarmerBurns.html&lt;/ref&gt; Burns was so respected as a trainer that he was even recruited to serve as the conditioning coach for boxer Jim Jeffries’ 1910 title bout against Jack Johnson.

In 1914, Burns published a 96-page mail-order course entitled ''The Lessons in Wrestling and Physical Culture'', which incorporated breathing techniques, calisthenics, stamina exercises, and Eastern martial arts principles, thus becoming the bible for all aspiring wrestlers during the early 1900s. Moreover, it is said that Ed “Strangler” Lewis, the great wrestling champion of the 1920s and 30s (and the eventual teacher of Lou Thesz) got his start in wrestling by following Burns’ training methods. Consequently, it is because of Burns’ many efforts that his native state of Iowa has subsequently become the nation’s amateur wrestling capital, with the University of Iowa consistently serving as an NCAA powerhouse, and with the International Wrestling Institute and Museum also based in Newton.

On March 31, 2017, Burns was posthumously inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] as a part of the Legacy wing.

==Personal life==
Burns had two sons, Raymond and Charlie, who became musicians in Chicago, and a daughter, Celia Burns Beem.  He suffered the loss of his wife Amelia in 1930, which led to the deterioration of his own condition. At this point he went to live with his daughter who died in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Hornbaker, Tim, Farmer Burns Wrestling History http://www.legacyofwrestling.com/FarmerBurns.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Farmer Burns grave.JPG|thumb|Farmer Burns grave in St. James Cemetery]]
Burns died on January 8, 1937, in Council Bluffs, Iowa at the age of 75, and was buried at the St. James Cemetery in Toronto, Iowa.

==The "Farmer" Burns Workout==
The "Farmer" Burns workout is a custom workout routine developed by Martin Burns for himself and his students. It is based only on resistance provided by one's own body, a pair of dumbbell weights, and supplemental aerobic exercise, such as running. The workout consists of three phases of exercises organized into sets and repetitions. The first phase is a combination of [[warming up|warm-ups]] and [[stretching|stretches]], using only one's own body for resistance. The second phase uses a pair of [[dumbbells]] for resistance, otherwise resembling [[aerobics]] in appearance. The third phase of exercises are partner exercises, again only relying on the two persons' bodies for resistance.  Martin Burns' career success is often accredited greatly in part to this intense workout routine.

==Feats of Strength==
Burns was well known in the early twentieth century for his neck. He managed to have a twenty-inch neck. With this neck, according to an article in [[WWE Magazine]], he gained fame by being put into a [[noose]], getting [[hanging|hanged]], and living, while whistling "[[Yankee Doodle]]".

The terms '''medical record''', '''health record''', and '''medical chart''' are used somewhat interchangeably to describe the systematic documentation of a single [[patient]]'s [[medical history]] and [[health care|care]] across time within one particular health care provider's jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/11397.pdf |title=Personal Health Records |publisher=CMS |date=April 2011 |accessdate=2012-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305221931/http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/11397.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The medical record includes a variety of types of "notes" entered over time by health care professionals, recording observations and administration of drugs and therapies, orders for the administration of drugs and therapies, test results, x-rays, reports, etc.  The maintenance of complete and accurate medical records is a  requirement of health care providers and is generally enforced as a licensing or certification prerequisite.

The terms are used for both the physical and metal folder that exists for each individual patient and for the body of information found therein.

Medical records have traditionally been compiled and maintained by health care providers, but advances in online data storage have led to the development of [[personal health record]]s (PHR) that are maintained by patients themselves, often on third-party websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myphr.com/resources/faqs.aspx |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=MyPHR.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is supported by US national health administration entities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/ |title=National Institute for Health |publisher=Nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by AHIMA, the American Health Information Management Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahima.org/ |title=American Health Information Management Association |publisher=Ahima.org |date=2012-03-22 |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:US Navy 041019-N-5821P-019 Airman Lauren Thurgood of Las Vegas, Nev., pulls patient medical records in the inpatient ward aboard the conventionally powered aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A medical record folder being pulled from the records]] In 2009, Congress authorized and funded legislation known as the [[Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/hitech-act-enforcement-interim-final-rule/index.html |title=HITECH Act Enforcement Interim Final Rule |publisher=Hhs.gov |date= |accessdate=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to stimulate the conversion of paper medical records into electronic charts. While many hospitals and doctor’s offices have since done this successfully, electronic health vendors' proprietary systems haven't always been compatible with one another, and an untold number of patients undergo duplicate procedures — or fail to get them at all — because key pieces of their medical history are missing. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://undark.org/article/medical-records-fragmentation-health-care/ |title=Paper Trails: Living and Dying With Fragmented Medical Records |publisher=undark.org |date= |accessdate=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because many consider the information in medical records to be sensitive private  information covered by expectations of privacy, many [[ethical]] and [[legal]] issues are implicated in their maintenance, such as third-party access and appropriate storage and disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/ |title=Health Information Privacy |publisher=Hhs.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the storage equipment for medical records generally is the property of the health care provider, the actual record is considered in most jurisdictions to be the property of the patient, who may obtain copies upon request.

==Uses==

The information contained in the medical record allows [[health care providers]] to determine the patient's medical history and provide informed care.  The medical record serves as the central repository for planning patient care and documenting communication among patient and health care provider and professionals contributing to the patient's care. An increasing purpose of the medical record is to ensure documentation of compliance with institutional, professional or governmental regulation.

The traditional medical record for inpatient care can include [[admission note]]s, [[on-service note]]s, [[progress note]]s ([[SOAP note]]s), [[preoperative note]]s, [[operative note]]s, [[postoperative note]]s, [[procedure note]]s, [[delivery note]]s, [[postpartum note]]s, and [[discharge note]]s.

[[Personal health record]]s combine many of the above features with portability, thus allowing a patient to share medical records across providers and health care systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mckinley.illinois.edu/units/medical_records/medical_records.htm |title=Medical Records |publisher=McKinley Health Center |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

A patient's individual medical record identifies the patient and contains information regarding the patient's case history at a particular provider.  The health record as well as any electronically stored variant of the traditional paper files contain proper identification of the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/magazine/issues/summer09/articles/summer09pg17.html |title=A Sample Health Record |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further information varies with the individual medical history of the patient.

==Media applied==

Traditionally, medical records were written on paper and maintained in folders often divided into sections for each type of note (progress note, order, test results), with new information added to each section chronologically.  Active records are usually housed at the clinical site, but older records are often archived offsite.

The advent of [[electronic medical record]]s has not only changed the format of medical records but has increased accessibility of files.  The use of an individual dossier style medical record, where records are kept on each patient by name and illness type originated at the [[Mayo Clinic]] out of a desire to simplify patient tracking and to allow for medical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hipaajournal.com/hipaa-compliant-ehr-system/ |title=Mayo Clinic Investing $1.5 Billion in HIPAA Compliant EHR System |publisher=HIPAA Journal |date= |accessdate=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maintenance of medical records requires security measures to prevent from unauthorized access or tampering with the records.

===Medical history===

The [[medical history]] is a [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal]] record of what has happened to the patient since birth. It chronicles [[disease]]s, major and minor [[illness]]es, as well as [[growth landmarks]]. It gives the clinician a feel for what has happened before to the patient. As a result, it may often give clues to current disease state. It includes several subsets detailed below.

;Surgical history
:The surgical history is a chronicle of [[surgery]] performed for the patient. It may have dates of operations, [[operative report]]s, and/or the detailed narrative of what the [[surgery|surgeon]] did.
;Obstetric history
:The [[obstetrics|obstetric]] history lists prior [[pregnancy|pregnancies]] and their outcomes. It also includes any complications of these pregnancies.
;Medications and medical allergies
:The medical record may contain a summary of the patient's current and previous medications as well as any medical allergies.
;Family history
:The [[family]] history lists the health status of immediate family members as well as their causes of death (if known).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familyhistory.hhs.gov/fhh-web/home.action |title=My Family Health Portrait |publisher=Office of the Surgeon General |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also list diseases common in the family or found only in one sex or the other. It may also include a [[pedigree chart]]. It is a valuable asset in predicting some outcomes for the patient.
;Social history
:The social history is a chronicle of human interactions. It tells of the [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s of the patient, his/her careers and trainings, and religious training. It is helpful for the physician to know what sorts of [[community]] support the patient might expect during a major illness. It may explain the behavior of the patient in relation to illness or loss. It may also give clues as to the cause of an illness (e.g. occupational exposure to asbestos).
;Habits
:Various habits which impact health, such as [[tobacco]] use, [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] intake, [[exercise]], and [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] are chronicled, often as part of the social history. This section may also include more intimate details such as sexual habits and [[sexual orientation]].
;Immunization history
:The history of [[vaccination]] is included. Any blood tests proving [[immune system|immunity]] will also be included in this section.
;Growth chart and developmental history
:For children and teenagers, charts documenting growth as it compares to other children of the same age is included, so that health-care providers can follow the child's growth over time. Many diseases and social stresses can affect growth, and longitudinal charting can thus provide a clue to underlying illness. Additionally, a child's behavior (such as timing of talking, walking, etc.) as it compares to other children of the same age is documented within the medical record for much the same reasons as growth.

===Medical encounters===

Within the medical record, individual medical encounters are marked by discrete summations of a patient's medical history by a physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant and can take several forms. Hospital admission documentation (i.e., when a patient requires hospitalization) or consultation by a [[medical specialist|specialist]] often take an exhaustive form, detailing the entirety of prior health and health care. Routine visits by a provider familiar to the patient, however, may take a shorter form such as the ''problem-oriented medical record'' (POMR), which includes a problem list of diagnoses or a "[[SOAP note|SOAP]]" method of documentation for each visit. Each encounter will generally contain the aspects below:

;[[Chief complaint]]
:This is the main problem (traditionally called a complaint) that has brought the patient to see the doctor or other clinician. Information on the nature and duration of the problem will be explored.
;[[History of the present illness]]
:A detailed exploration of the symptoms the patient is experiencing that have caused the patient to seek medical attention.
;Physical examination
:The [[physical examination]] is the recording of observations of the patient. This includes the [[Vital signs (medicine)|vital signs]], muscle power and examination of the different organ systems, especially ones that might directly be responsible for the symptoms the patient is experiencing.
;Assessment and plan
:The assessment is a written summation of what are the most likely causes of the patient's current set of symptoms. The plan documents the expected course of action to address the symptoms (diagnosis, treatment, etc.).

===Orders and prescriptions===
Written orders by medical providers are included in the medical record. These detail the instructions given to other members of the health care team by the primary providers.

===Progress notes===

When a patient is hospitalized, daily updates are entered into the medical record documenting clinical changes, new information, etc. These often take the form of a [[SOAP note]] and are entered by all members of the health-care team (doctors, nurses, physical therapists, dietitians, clinical pharmacists, [[respiratory therapist]]s, etc.). They are kept in chronological order and document the sequence of events leading to the current state of health.

===Test results===

The results of testing, such as blood tests (e.g., [[complete blood count]]) [[radiology]] examinations (e.g., [[X-ray]]s), [[pathology]] (e.g., [[biopsy]] results), or specialized testing (e.g., [[spirometry|pulmonary function testing]]) are included. Often, as in the case of [[X-ray]]s, a written report of the [[Medical findings|findings]] is included in lieu of the actual film.

===Other information===
Many other items are variably kept within the medical record. Digital images of the patient, flowsheets from operations/[[intensive care unit]]s, [[informed consent]] forms, [[EKG]] tracings, outputs from medical devices (such as [[artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]]), [[chemotherapy]] protocols, and numerous other important pieces of information form part of the record depending on the patient and his or her set of illnesses/treatments.

==Administrative issues==
Medical records are [[legal document]]s that can be used as evidence via a [[subpoena duces tecum]],&lt;ref name="Judson &amp; Harrison" /&gt; and are thus subject to the laws of the country/state in which they are produced. As such, there is great variability in rules governing production, ownership, accessibility, and destruction. There is some controversy regarding proof verifying the facts, or absence of facts in the record, apart from the medical record itself.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Demographics===

[[Demographic]]s include patient information that is not medical in nature. It is often information to locate the patient, including identifying numbers, addresses, and contact numbers. It may contain information about [[Race (human classification)|race]] and [[religion]] as well as workplace and type of [[Employment|occupation]]. It also contains information regarding the patient's [[health insurance]]. It is common to also find emergency contact information located in this section of the medical chart.

===Production===

In the [[United States]], written records must be marked with the date and time and scribed with indelible pens without use of corrective paper. Errors in the record should be struck out with a single line (so that the initial entry remains legible) and initialed by the author.&lt;ref name="Judson &amp; Harrison"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Judson|first1=Karen, B.S.|last2=Harrison|first2=Carlene, Ed.D., C.M.A.|title=Law &amp; Ethics for Medical Careers|edition=5th|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=New York|isbn=9780073402062|chapter=Chapter 6: Medical Records and Informed Consent}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Orders and notes must be signed by the author. Electronic versions require an [[electronic signature]].

==Ownership of patient's record==

Ownership and keeping of patient's records varies from country to country.

===US law and customs===

In the [[United States]], the data contained within the medical record belongs to the patient, whereas the physical form the data takes belongs to the entity responsible for maintaining the record&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brodnik|first1=Melanie S., PhD, RHIA|last2=McCain|first2=Mary Cole, MPA, RHIA|last3=Sharp|first3=Marcia Y., MBA, RHIA|title=Fundamentals of Law for Health Informatics and Information Management|year=2009|publisher=[[AHIMA]]|location=Chicago|isbn=978-1-58426-173-5|page=239|display-authors=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; per the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aspe.hhs.gov/admnsimp/pl104191.htm |title=P.L. 104-191 |publisher=Aspe.hhs.gov |date=1996-08-21 |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients have the right to ensure that the information contained in their record is accurate, and can petition their health care provider to amend factually incorrect information in their records.&lt;ref name="Judson &amp; Harrison" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{CodeFedReg|45|164|subpart=E|526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no consensus regarding medical record ownership in the [[United States]]. Factors complicating questions of ownership include the form and source of the information, custody of the information, contract rights, and variation in state law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthinfolaw.org/lb/download-document/6640/field_article_file|title=Who Owns Health Information? - Health Information &amp; the Law|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no federal law regarding ownership of medical records. [[HIPAA]] gives patients the right to access and amend their own records, but it has no language regarding ownership of the records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/medical-economics/news/patient-records-struggle-ownership|title=Patient records: The struggle for ownership|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-eight states and [[Washington, D.C.]] have no laws that define ownership of medical records. Twenty-one states have laws stating that the providers are the owners of the records. Only one state, [[New Hampshire]], has a law ascribing ownership of medical records to the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthinfolaw.org/comparative-analysis/who-owns-medical-records-50-state-comparison|title=Who Owns Medical Records: 50 State Comparison - Health Information &amp; the Law|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canadian law and customs ===
Under [[Law of Canada|Canadian federal law]], the patient owns the information contained in a medical record, but the healthcare provider owns the records themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmpa-acpm.ca/static-assets/pdf/advice-and-publications/handbooks/com_electronic_records_handbook-e.pdf|title=CMPA: Electronic Records Handbook|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same is true for both nursing home and dental records.  In cases where the provider is an employee of a clinic or hospital, it is the employer that has ownership of the records.  By law, all providers must keep medical records for a period of 15 years beyond the last entry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbabc.org/For-the-Public/Dial-A-Law/Scripts/Health-Law/421 The Canadian Bar Association: Getting Your Medical Records]&lt;/ref&gt;

The precedent for the law is the 1992 [[Supreme Court of Canada|Canadian Supreme Court]] ruling in McInerney v MacDonald.  In that ruling, an appeal by a physician, Dr. Elizabeth McInerney,  challenging a patient's access to their own medical record was denied.  The patient, Margaret MacDonald, won a court order granting her full access to her own medical record.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=12041089|title=McInerney v. MacDonald|journal=Dominion Law Reports|volume=93|pages=415–31|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The case was complicated by the fact that the records were in electronic form and contained information supplied by other providers.  McInerney maintained that she didn't have the right to release records she herself did not author.  The courts ruled otherwise. Legislation followed, codifying into law the principles of the ruling. It is that legislation which deems providers the owner of medical records, but requires that [[Medical record#Accessibility|access]] to the records be granted to the patient themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmpa-acpm.ca/serve/docs/ela/goodpracticesguide/pages/communication/Documentation/who_owns_the_medical_record-e.html|title=CMPA: Who Owns the Medical Record?|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK law and customs===

In the [[United Kingdom]], ownership of the [[National Health Service|NHS]]'s medical records has in the past generally been described as belonging to the Secretary of State for Health &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moyle R |authorlink=Roland Moyle |title=Written Answers (Commons): SOCIAL SERVICES: Medical Records (Ownership and Storage) |journal=[[Hansard]] |date=30 November 1976 |volume=921 |issue=c91W |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1976/nov/30/medical-records-ownership-and-storage |quote=Personal medical records, including X-rays, in respect of patients treated under the NHS are held to be the property of the Secretary of State. NHS hospital medical records are stored in premises designated by the appropriate health authority.

In a free society ownership cannot be said to apply to medical records created in the UK but outside NHS For the past 20 years the master copy of the ante-natal record has not been stored in premises designated by the appropriate health authority but has been carried by the expectant mother. And it being now government policy that by 2015 every general practice in England should offer patients online access to their (own) care record &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The power of information: putting us all in control of the health and care information we need.|publisher=Department of Health May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  it can no longer be said that 'access is governed by' professionals.  Although there have been many false starts patients are increasingly taking charge of their own records, and this trend is considered by some to be an important step towards organising care around patients rather than institutions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davies|first=Peter|title=Should patients be able to control their own records?|journal=BMJ|date=30 July 2012|year=2012|volume=345|issue=e4905|doi=10.1136/bmj.e4905|pmid=22846414}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

===German law and customs===

In Germany, a relatively new law,&lt;ref&gt;http://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/630f.html&lt;/ref&gt; which has been established in 2013, strengthens the rights of patients. It states, amongst other things, the statutory duty of medical personnel to document the treatment of the patient in either hard copy or within the [[electronic patient record]] (EPR). This documentation must happen in a timely manner and encompass each and every form of treatment the patient receives, as well as other necessary information, such as the patient’s case history, diagnoses, findings, treatment results, therapies and their effects, surgical interventions and their effects, as well as informed consents. The information must include virtually everything that is of functional importance for the actual, but also for future treatment. This documentation must also include the medical report and must be archived by the attending physician for at least 10 years. The law clearly states that these records are not only memory aids for the physicians, but also should be kept for the patient and must be presented on request.

In addition, an electronic health insurance card was issued in January 2014 which is applicable in Germany ([[:de:Elektronische Gesundheitskarte|Elektronische Gesundheitskarte]] or eGK), but also in the other member states of the European Union ([[European Health Insurance Card]]). It contains data such as: the name of the health insurance company, the validity period of the card, and personal information about the patient (name, date of birth, sex, address, health insurance number) as well information about the patient’s insurance status and additional charges. Furthermore, it can contain medical data if agreed to by the patient. This data can include information concerning emergency care, prescriptions, an electronic medical record, and electronic physician’s letters. However, due to the limited storage space (32kB), some information is deposited on servers.

===Accessibility===

====United States====
In the [[United States]], the most basic rules governing access to a medical record dictate that only the patient and the health-care providers directly involved in delivering care have the right to view the record. The patient, however, may grant [[consent]] for any person or entity to evaluate the record. The full rules regarding access and security for medical records are set forth under the guidelines of the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA).
The rules become more complicated in special situations. A 2018 study found discrepancies in how major hospitals handle record requests, with forms displaying limited information relative to phone conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lye|first=Carolyn T.|last2=Forman|first2=Howard P.|last3=Gao|first3=Ruiyi|last4=Daniel|first4=Jodi G.|last5=Hsiao|first5=Allen L.|last6=Mann|first6=Marilyn K.|last7=deBronkart|first7=Dave|last8=Campos|first8=Hugo O.|last9=Krumholz|first9=Harlan M.|date=2018-10-05|title=Assessment of US Hospital Compliance With Regulations for Patients’ Requests for Medical Records|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2705850?utm_source=TrendMD&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=JAMA_Network_Open_TrendMD_1|journal=JAMA Network Open|language=en|volume=1|issue=6|pages=e183014|doi=10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.3014|issn=2574-3805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Capacity
:When a patient does not have [[Capacity (law)|capacity]] (is not legally able) to make decisions regarding his or her own care, a [[legal guardian]] is designated (either through next of kin or by action of a court of law if no kin exists). Legal guardians have the ability to access the medical record in order to make medical decisions on the patient’s behalf. Those without capacity include the [[coma]]tose, minors (unless [[emancipation of minors|emancipated]]), and patients with incapacitating [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] illness or [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]].
;Medical emergency
:In the event of a medical emergency involving a non-communicative patient, consent to access medical records is assumed unless written documentation has been previously drafted (such as an [[advance directive]])
;Research, auditing, and evaluation
:Individuals involved in medical research, financial or management [[audit]]s, or program evaluation have access to the medical record. They are not allowed access to any identifying information, however.
;Risk of death or harm
:Information within the record can be shared with authorities without permission when failure to do so would result in death or harm, either to the patient or to others. Information cannot be used, however, to initiate or substantiate a charge unless the previous criteria are met (i.e., information from illicit drug testing cannot be used to bring charges of possession against a patient). This rule was established in the [[United States Supreme Court]] case [[Jaffe v. Redmond]][http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/cases/medrec/42_USC_29dd-2.htm].

==== Canada ====
In the 1992 Canadian Supreme Court ruling in McInerney v. MacDonald gave patients the right to copy and examine all information in their medical records, while the records themselves remained the property of the [[Health professional|healthcare provider]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The 2004 [[Personal Health Information Protection Act|Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA)]] contains regulatory guidelines to protect the confidentiality of patient information for healthcare organizations acting as stewards of their medical records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/03063_01|title=Personal Health Information Protection Acts [SBC 2003] Chapter 63|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite legal precedent for access nationwide, there is still some variance in laws depending on the province.  There is also some confusion among providers as to the scope of the patient information they have to give access to, but the language in the supreme court ruling gives patient access rights to their entire record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grant|first=D.A.|date=1998|title=MDs still confused about patient access to medical records|pmc=1229252|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=158 |issue=9|pages=1126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection Acts]] and later the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]] gave patients or their representatives the right to a copy of their record, except where information breaches confidentiality (e.g., information from another family member or where a patient has asked for information not to be disclosed to third parties) or would be harmful to the patient's wellbeing (e.g., some psychiatric assessments). Also, the legislation gives patients the right to check for any errors in their record and insist that amendments be made if required.

===Destruction===
In general, entities in possession of medical records are required to maintain those records for a given period. In the [[United Kingdom]], medical records are required for the lifetime of a patient and legally for as long as that complaint action can be brought. Generally in the UK, any recorded information should be kept legally for 7 years, but for medical records additional time must be allowed for any child to reach the age of responsibility (20 years). Medical records are required many years after a patient’s death to investigate illnesses within a community (e.g., industrial or environmental disease or even deaths at the hands of doctors committing murders, as in the [[Harold Shipman]] case).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 |title=Government 'Breached Ex-Soldier's Human Rights' |publisher=The Guardian |date=October 20, 2004 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/military/story/0,11816,1331784,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abuses===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
The [[outsourcing]] of medical record transcription and storage has the potential to violate patient-physician confidentiality by possibly allowing unaccountable persons access to patient data.
Falsification of a medical record by a medical professional is a [[felony]] in most United States jurisdictions.
Governments have often refused to disclose medical records of military personnel who have been used as experimental subjects.

===Data breaches===
Given the series of medical [[data breach]]es and the lack of public trust, some countries have enacted laws requiring safeguards to be put in place to protect the security and confidentiality of medical information as it is shared electronically and to give patients some important rights to monitor their medical records and receive notification for loss and unauthorized acquisition of health information. The United States and the EU have imposed mandatory medical data breach notifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0267364912000209 | doi=10.1016/j.clsr.2012.01.003 | volume=28 | issue=2 | title=Medical data breaches: Notification delayed is notification denied | year=2012 | journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review | pages=163–183 | author=Kierkegaard Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients' medical information can be shared by a number of people both within the health care industry and beyond. The Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA) is a United States federal law pertaining to [[medical privacy]] that went into effect in 2003. This law established standards for patient privacy in all 50 states, including the right of patients to access to their own records.  HIPAA provides some protection, but does not resolve the issues involving medical records privacy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.privacyrights.org/Medical-Privacy Privacy Rights Clearinghouse - Medical Privacy Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical and health care providers experienced 767 security breaches resulting in the compromised confidential health information of 23,625,933 patients during the period of 2006–2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.privacyrights.org/data-breach Privacy Rights Clearinghouse's Chronology of Data Security Breaches].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Privacy==
{{globalize|section|USA|date=December 2012}}
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA) addresses the issue of privacy by providing medical information handling guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/summary/ Health and Human Services HIPAA Privacy Rule for health information.]&lt;/ref&gt; Not only is it bound by the Code of Ethics of its profession (in the case of doctors and nurses), but also by the legislation on data protection and criminal law. Professional secrecy applies to practitioners, psychologists, nursing, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nursing assistants, chiropodists, and administrative personnel, as well as auxiliary hospital staff. The maintenance of the confidentiality and privacy of patients implies first of all in the medical history, which must be adequately guarded, remaining accessible only to the authorized personnel. However, the precepts of privacy must be observed in all fields of hospital life: privacy at the time of the conduct of the anamnesis and physical exploration, the privacy at the time of the information to the relatives, the conversations between healthcare providers in the corridors, maintenance of adequate patient data collection in hospital nursing controls (planks, slates), telephone conversations, open intercoms ...

[[Image:MeridianGate.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Meridian Gate, viewed from the south&lt;/center&gt;]]

The '''Meridian Gate''' or '''Wumen''' ({{zh|t=午門|s=午门|p=Wǔmén}}; [[Manchu language|Manchu]]: {{MongolUnicode|ᠵᡠᠯᡝᡵᡤᡳ&lt;br&gt;ᡩᡠᠯᡳᠮᠪᠠᡳ&lt;br&gt;ᡩᡠᡴᠠ}}; [[Transliterations of Manchu|Möllendorff]]: ''julergi dulimbai duka'') is the southern and largest gate of the [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]]. Unlike the other gates of the Forbidden City, the Meridian Gate has two protruding arms on either side, derived from ancient [[que towers]] traditionally used to decorate the main entrances of palaces, temples and tombs. The gate has five arches. The three central arches are close together in the main, central section; the two flanking arches are farther apart from the three central arches, and are located between the central section and the protruding arms. The centre arch was formerly reserved for the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] alone; the exceptions were the Empress, who could enter it once on the day of her wedding, and the top three scholars of the [[Imperial examination|triennial civil service examinations]], who left the exams through the central arch. All other officials and servants had to use the four side arches.

A series of buildings form the superstructure of the gate. The central one is a pavilion of nine bays wide, with double eaves. On each of the protruding side, a 13 bays-long building with a single eave, connects the two pyramidal-roofed pavilions that represented the que towers. 

Its superstructure is also called the "Five Phoenix Turrets" because it is composed of five buildings.&lt;ref name="Yu 32"&gt;{{cite book |last=Yu |first= Zhuoyun | authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Palaces of the Forbidden City |year=1984|publisher=Viking |location=New York |isbn=0-670-53721-7 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imperial proclamations and almanacs were issued from the gate house. After successful campaigns, the Emperor received prisoners of war here, sometimes followed by mass decapitations.&lt;ref name="Huang1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Huang|first=Ray|title=1587, A Year of No Significance: The Ming Dynasty in Decline|year=1981|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0-300-02518-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[urban myth]] has it that senior officers were executed here in [[Imperial era of Chinese history|Imperial China]]; in reality only corporal punishment was actually carried out.

Behind the viewer is [[Duanmen|Upright Gate]], the principal entrance to the imperial palace grounds.

When proceeding northward through the palace grounds, the next major gate encountered is the [[Gate of Supreme Harmony]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4981">'''Microfadeometry''' is a technique that uses tiny spots of intense light to probe and measure color changes in objects of art that are particularly sensitive to light exposure.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;[http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/services/scientific-scientifique/microfade-microvieillissement-eng.aspx Microfade Testing Service], Canadian Conservation Institute. (2014, June 2).&lt;/ref&gt;
This process is completed using a recently designed instrument known as a microfading tester. The data from the test is represented by a reflectance spectra.

== History ==
Light-fastness testing dates back to as early as 1733. In the late 19th century with early [[art conservation]] studies, Russell and Abney published Action of Light on Watercolors in 1888 sparking a concern with light and the aging of cultural materials.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;Druzik, J. Oriel Microfading Tester (MFT): a Brief Description. ''Research and Technical Studies''. '''2010''', ''2'', 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Microfading, as a technique, was first identified in Paul Whitmore’s lab book entry on September 21, 1994. His work on the topic was later published in 1999.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;Ford, B. Non-Destructive Microfade Testing at the National Museum of Australia. ''The Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material Bulletin''. '''2011''', ''32'', 54-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
Before the creation of this technique, recording light-stability information directly from the objects was nearly impossible. Through the use of microfading technology, it is now possible to obtain both information about the chemical characterization of the dyes and the associated kinetics of color change.&lt;ref name="three"/&gt;
Benchtop microfaders and microfading testers are used to test and analyze light damage on cultural objects and potential light damage to objects in museum collections.&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;Chiari, G. Conservation Science Investigation. ''International Preservation News''. '''2010''', ''50'', 11-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
Using a powerful [[xenon arc lamp]], 1 lumen of light is focused through an [[optical fiber]] onto a 300–400&amp;nbsp;μm spot of the object’s surface. The reflected light is collected by a second fiber optic.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt; The period of exposure is monitored with a probe that transforms the reflectance spectrum into color coordinates in real-time.

== Reliability ==
Concerns associated with microfading techniques include: diffusion-limited photo-oxidation reaction rates, dehydration and heating of the sample, the variability of using and measuring ISO Blue Wool Standards,&lt;ref name="eight"/&gt; variation in spectral power distribution between lamps used in object display and the lamp used in accelerated light aging, the small sampling area, the required number of sample the length of fading time and the potential interaction of individual chemical components of the object tested.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;

'''Moffat v Moffat''' [1984] 1 NZLR 600 is a leading New Zealand case regarding unconscionable bargains

==Background==
Mr and Mrs Moffat after 18 years of marriage, separated and entered into a separation agreement. The separation agreement was highly one sided in favour of Mr Moffat, which not only granted him full custody of their 4 children, but also the ownership of the matrimonial house, and all its possessions. Prior to accepting, Mrs Moffat was advised by her husband's solicitor to get legal advice, but declined to do so. She signed an acknowledgement confirming this.

Mrs Moffat subsequently came to her senses and tried to have this one sided agreement set aside due to it being an [[unconscionable bargain]]. She argued, that when she entered into the agreement, she was unwell both physically and mentally, thought she might have been pregnant to a man she was having an affair with, had not taken legal advice, nor did she know the value of her interest in their house and claimed that her husband was aware of all this, and took advantage of her situation by making her accept his separation agreement.

==Decision==
The Court of Appeal ruled that the husband took unconscionable advantage of his wife's circumstances, and accordingly set aside the separation agreement.

'''''Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian''''' is a 2009 American adventure [[fantasy comedy]] film written by [[Robert Ben Garant]] and [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]], produced by [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]], [[Michael Barnathan]] and [[Shawn Levy]] and directed by Levy. The film stars [[Ben Stiller]], [[Amy Adams]], [[Owen Wilson]], [[Steve Coogan]], [[Hank Azaria]], [[Bill Hader]], [[Christopher Guest]], [[Alain Chabat]], [[Jon Bernthal]], and [[Robin Williams]]. It is the second installment in the [[Night at the Museum (film series)|''Night at the Museum'' trilogy]], and a sequel to the 2006 film ''[[Night at the Museum]]''. It is also the last ''Night at the Museum'' film to feature [[Jake Cherry]] as Nick Daley, as Cherry aged out of the role. The film was released theatrically on May 22, 2009 by [[20th Century Fox]], being the only film in the trilogy not to be released theatrically in December. Like its predecessor, it received mixed critical reception and a box office success by grossing over $413 million on a $150 million budget.

==Plot==
Two years after the events of the first film, Larry Daley, former night guard at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], now runs his own [[direct response television]] company that sells inventions based on his experiences. He travels to the museum, discovering most of the exhibits will be moved to the Federal Archives at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and replaced with holographic information providers. The Tablet of Ahkmenrah is to remain in the museum, leaving most of the exhibits without the ability to come to life at night. After the exhibits are moved, Larry receives a phone call from  Jedediah, who informs him that Dexter the monkey stole the tablet and took it to the Smithsonian, bringing every exhibit in it to life. Larry travels to [[Washington, DC]], navigating his way to the archives with help from his son Nick while posing as a night guard.

Larry finds his friends trapped in their [[shipping container]] under attack from Ahkmenrah’s evil older brother Kahmunrah, accidentally activating the tablet and bringing the exhibits in the Smithsonian to life again. Kahmunrah reveals his plans to use the tablet’s powers to conquer the world. Larry escapes, aided by a gigantic octopus and General [[George A. Custer]], who is captured, and then the adventurous [[Amelia Earhart]], who becomes his travelling companion around the museum. The two evade Kahmunrah’s army, trapping them in the portrait of [[V-J Day in Times Square]]. Kahmunrah enlists fellow evil historical leaders, [[Ivan the Terrible]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], and [[Al Capone]] to help capture Larry and retrieve the tablet. Jedediah tries to help but is placed in an hourglass. Kahmunrah is unable to open the Gate of the Underworld with the tablet, and gives Larry and Amelia an hour to translate it, or Kahmunrah will kill Larry and his friends.

While searching for someone in the museum who can help, Larry and Amelia end up falling in love. They travel to the [[National Air and Space Museum]], briefly encountering the [[Abraham Lincoln (1920 statue)|statue]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]] at the [[Lincoln Memorial]]. Inside the museum, Larry grounds all of the aircraft and rockets from taking off, before a group of [[Albert Einstein]] bobbleheads inform him that the combination is the value of [[pi]]. Napoleon, Ivan, and Capone’s troops arrive, prompting Larry and Amelia to escape using the [[Wright Flyer]]. They crash the plane into the Smithsonian, where Kahmunrah uses the acquired combination to summon an army of bird-headed warriors. Lincoln crashes in through the window, frightening the warriors back into the Underworld.

Amelia gathers an army of allies including Larry’s friends and Custer, leading to a climactic battle. But Custer is afraid to fight after remembering Little Big Horn. Larry persuades him to forget the past and fight on. Meanwhile, Octavius rescues Jedediah, who together, turn the tide of the Battle. Larry obtains the tablet, and devises a plan to stop Kahmunrah. Inspired by an idea given to him by Lincoln, Larry sparks a disagreement between Capone, Bonaparte and Ivan, causing them to brawl amongst themselves. Larry attempts to escape, only to be cut off by an angry Kahmunrah, brandishing a [[Khopesh]]. After a brief scuffle between Larry, armed with his flashlight, and Kahmunrah, Amelia eventually manages to use the tablet to open the gate, and Larry finally defeats Kahmunrah, banishing him to the Underworld. 

Amelia flies Larry and the New York exhibits back home, giving Larry a final kiss before taking off in her plane, knowing she will become dust before reaching the Smithsonian. 
Two months later, Larry sells his company, donating the money to the museum to renovate it, and the exhibits remain, capable of moving about at night under the pretense of being [[animatronic]]s. Larry is rehired as a night guard and aids a woman who resembles Amelia during the debut of the museum's new extension of visiting hours.

===Development===
Writers [[Robert Ben Garant]] and [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]] confirmed to Dark Horizons that they were writing a sequel to ''Night at the Museum,'' originally with the tentative title ''Another Night at the Museum''. The writers said that "there'll be existing characters and plenty of new ones."

[[20th Century Fox]] announced that the sequel, ''Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian'', would be released during Memorial Day weekend in 2009. [[Ben Stiller]], [[Owen Wilson]], [[Steve Coogan]], [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Patrick Gallagher (actor)|Patrick Gallagher]], [[Jake Cherry]], [[Rami Malek]], [[Mizuo Peck]], [[Brad Garrett]] and [[Robin Williams]] would return for the sequel, with [[Shawn Levy]] returning as director.

The film was mostly filmed in [[Vancouver]] and [[Montreal]] with some scenes filmed in the [[Smithsonian]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/exhibits/SIintheMovies/index.htm |title=The Smithsonian In the Movies |publisher=Siarchives.si.edu |date= |accessdate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scene was shot at the Lincoln Memorial on the night of May 21, 2008. Scenes were also shot at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York on August 18 and 20, 2008.

The trailer was released with ''[[Bedtime Stories (film)|Bedtime Stories]]'', ''[[Yes Man (film)|Yes Man]]'' and ''[[Marley &amp; Me (film)|Marley &amp; Me]]'' in December 2008. The trailer accompanied the film ''[[Bride Wars]]'' in January, ''[[The Pink Panther 2]]'' in February, and ''[[Dragonball Evolution]]'' in April 2009. The film was also promoted as an opening skit on ''[[American Idol]],'' where a replica of the ''Idol'' judge seats are being held at the real Smithsonian Institution.

An alternate ending included on the DVD and Blu-ray releases featured the return of [[Dick Van Dyke]] as Cecil Fredericks, [[Bill Cobbs]] as Reginald, and [[Mickey Rooney]] as Gus.

===Critical reaction===
Like its predecessor, the sequel has received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 44% "rotten" approval rating, based on 163 reviews, with an average score of 5.1/10, making it just barely the highest reviewed film of the series. The site's critical consensus reads, "''Night at the Museum: Battle at the Smithsonian'' is busy enough to keep the kids interested but the slapstick goes overboard and the special effects (however well executed) throw the production into mania".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/night_at_the_museum_2_escape_from_the_smithsonian/ | title=Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian Movie Reviews, Pictures | publisher=[[IGN Entertainment]] |work=Rotten Tomatoes | accessdate=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another review aggregator, [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, gave the film an average score of 42 out of 100 based on 31&amp;nbsp;reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/nightatthemuseum2?q=Night%20at%20the%20Museum:%20Battle%20of%20the%20Smithsonian | title=Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009): Reviews | publisher=Metacritic | accessdate=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite mixed reviews from critics, most critics praised Amy Adams' and Hank Azaria's performances. [[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' awarded the film 3&amp;nbsp;stars stating that "[Adams]'s terrific -- a sparkling screen presence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-tc-mov-night-museum-0520-052may20,0,6390332.story | title=Toys in the nation's attic - Amy Adams a treasure in the 'Museum' sequel | work=Chicago Tribune | accessdate=May 22, 2009 | date=May 20, 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527030719/http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-tc-mov-night-museum-0520-052may20%2C0%2C6390332.story | archivedate=May 27, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a B+ stating "''Battle of the Smithsonian'' has plenty of life.

One critic panned the movie on its excessive use of [[special effects]] as noted by Scott Tobias of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' when he described the film as "a baffling master plot and a crowded pileup of special effects in search of something to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.avclub.com/articles/night-at-the-museum-battle-of-the-smithsonian,28233/ | title=Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian Review - A.V.

In [[CinemaScore]] polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave ''Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian'' an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CScore"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cinemascore.com/ | title=Cinemascore | publisher=[[CinemaScore]] | work=Cinemascore.com | accessdate=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==

[[Ben Stiller]] admitted that a sequel was "a possibility" and on January 22, 2010, co-writer [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]] said to ''[[Access Hollywood]]'', "That after the success of two ''Night at the Museum'' films, it's no surprise that 20th&amp;nbsp;Century Fox is looking to develop a third and that those suspicions are indeed true and how could you not? I think it's a really outstanding idea to do ''Night at the Museum 3'', in fact," he said. "I wonder if someone's not even already working on a script for that," he added with a raised eyebrow. "I cannot confirm that for a fact, but I cannot deny it for a fact either... It might be in the works." In an interview, Stiller confirmed the sequel, however, he said that it was only in the "ideas stage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviehole.net/201147786-ben-stiller-confirms-night-at-the-museum-3-talks-zoolander-2-script|title=Ben Stiller confirms Night at the Museum 3; talks Zoolander 2 script|date=October 27, 2011|publisher=Movie Hole|accessdate=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oxford Scientific Films''' ('''OSF''') is a British company that produces natural history and documentary programmes. Founded on 8 July 1968, by noted documentary filmmaker [[Gerald Thompson]], the independent film company broke new ground in the world of documentaries, using new filming techniques and capturing footage of never before filmed activities of its various subjects. In 1996, Oxford Scientific Films was sold to Circle Communications, where it retained its own identity as a division within the company. The following year, Circle Communications was taken over by Southern Star Entertainment UK. Under the new ownership, Oxford Scientific Films continued to enhance its reputation for innovative film-making, producing multiple award-winning series and films, including the highly acclaimed [[Animal Planet]] series, ''[[Meerkat Manor]]''.

In March 2008, Southern Star merged its Sydney-based factual business division into the Oxford Scientific Films division, retaining the brand name for specialist documentaries, while using "Southern Star Factual" as the brand name for its features and entertainment style documentaries.  When Southern Star was sold to Endemol, Oxford Scientific Films was retained by parent company [[Fairfax Media]].  In 2011 Oxford Scientific Films was acquired by Boom Pictures Productions, who own a 70% share of the company.

==History==

===Formation and growth===
In 1967, cinemicrophotography pioneer, professional film maker, and [[Oxford University]] lecturer Gerald Thompson, was approached by the Ealing Corporation of Harvard about expanding its catalogue of short educational films. Universal Education and Visual Arts, a New York City, company also was interested in talking with Thompson about the works he'd produced. Thompson and five of his associates and former students: Peter Parks, who worked with [[plankton]]; John Paling, a fish specialist who worked with Parks; recent Oxford graduate Sean Morris; zoologist John Cooke; and Eric Skinner, who assisted Thompson with his films, wanted to form an independent film company. Thompson and Parks travelled to America to meet with the two companies to show their work. At the end of the meeting, they told the head of the company about their desire to open their own company and, impressed with the films he'd seen, he offered to finance them for the first three years and give them the funds to build a place to work.&lt;ref name="InterviewCh8"&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Christopher Parsons]] (Interviewer), Derek Kilkenny-Blake (Cameraman) |date=3 September 1998 |title=Oral History Interview: Gerald Thompson – Chapter 8:Setting up Oxford Scientific Films |url=http://www.wildfilmhistory.org/oh/21/clip/676/section/133/Gerald+Thompson%3A+Setting+up+Oxford+Scientific+Films.html |format=Flash |medium=Documentary |publisher=[[WildFilmHistory]] |accessdate=29 August 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Obit" /&gt;

When they returned to the United Kingdom, Thompson sold them a quarter acre of his garden, at a steeply discounted price, to be the home for the new building. They formed Oxford Scientific Films, taking part of the name from Parks' existing company Oxford Biological Films. Thompson, Parks, Morris, Paling, and Thompson's son David, headed the new company, which began operating on 8 July 1968. Thompson remained at his position at Oxford University while the company building was being completed, while the other four travelled to America to make the film loops for Ealing. Thompson resigned from the university on 2 September 1969, taking on the work at Oxford Scientific Films full-time.&lt;ref name="InterviewCh8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/sep/21/guardianobituaries.obituaries |title=Gerald Thompson: Pioneer of filming plants and small animals |first=Sean |last=Morris |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=21 September 2002 |accessdate=29 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company focused initially on filming nature at a microscopic level, including insect and aquatic wildlife. Using specialised equipment and camera techniques the developed themselves, the company gained fame for its ability to record never before seen footage of the natural world. Its cinematographers became experts in micro, macro, snorkel, slow-motion and [[time-lapse photography]].

On 4 December 2003, Oxford Scientific's extensive libraries of over 350,000 still images and over 2,000 of film footage libraries were acquired by [[Photolibrary]]. The acquisition was done as a share exchange,with Photolibrary acquiring shares in Oxford Scientific Films Limited, and Southern Star paying A$1&amp;nbsp;million to purchase a 46.46% equity in Photolibrary. Photolibrary retained existing employees of the library divisions, and continues using the names "Oxford Scientific" and "OSF" in promoting the libraries. Southern Star retained full control of Oxford Scientific Films production unit, and through that unit, continues supplying images and footage to the Photolibrary.&lt;ref name="Merger" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southernstargroup.com/content/readnews.aspx?id=1445 |title=Division Name – Southern Star Merger of Oxford Scientific Films Libraries And Photolibrary |publisher=[[Southern Star Group]] |date=30 April 2004 |accessdate=29 August 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southernstargroup.com/content/readnews.aspx?id=1426 |title=Southern Star Announces Merger of Oxford Scientific Films Libraries And Photolibrary |publisher=[[Southern Star Group]] |date=3 December 2003 |accessdate=29 August 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to tradition, several of Muhammad's companions served as scribes and recorded the revelations.&lt;ref name="Donner-Companion" /&gt; Shortly after his death, the Quran was compiled by the companions, who had written down or memorized parts of it.&lt;ref name=jecampo/&gt; The codices showed differences that motivated Caliph [[Uthman]] to establish a standard version, now known as Uthman's codex, which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today. There are, however, [[Qira'at|variant readings]], with mostly minor differences in meaning.&lt;ref name="Donner-Companion"&gt;Donner, Fred, "The historical context" in McAuliffe, J. D.

The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in the [[Books of the Bible|Biblical scriptures]].

Someone who has memorized the entire Quran is called a ''[[Hafiz (Quran)|hafiz]]''. Quranic verse (''[[ayah]]'') is sometimes recited with a special kind of [[elocution]] reserved for this purpose, called ''[[tajwid]]''. During the month of [[Ramadan]], Muslims typically complete the recitation of the whole Quran during ''[[tarawih]]'' prayers. In order to extrapolate the meaning of a particular Quranic verse, most Muslims rely on [[exegesis]], or ''[[tafsir]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Apocalypse And/or Metamorphosis – Page 81, Norman Oliver Brown – 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and meaning==
The word {{transl|ar|ALA|qurʼān}} appears about 70 times in the Quran itself, assuming various meanings. It is a [[verbal noun]] ([[Arabic verbs#Verbal noun (maṣdar)|{{transl|ar|ALA|maṣdar}}]]) of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] verb {{transl|ar|ALA|qaraʼa}} ({{lang|ar|قرأ}}), meaning "he read" or "he recited". The [[Syriac language|Syriac]] equivalent is ({{lang|syc|ܩܪܝܢܐ|}}) {{transl|sem|qeryānā}}, which refers to "scripture reading" or "lesson".&lt;ref name="Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon"&gt;{{cite web|title=qryn|url=http://cal.huc.edu/searchroots.php?pos=N&amp;lemma=qryn|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some Western scholars consider the word to be derived from the Syriac, the majority of Muslim authorities hold the origin of the word is {{transl|ar|ALA|qaraʼa}} itself.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; Regardless, it had become an Arabic term by Muhammad's lifetime.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; An important meaning of the word is the "act of reciting", as reflected in an early Quranic passage: "It is for Us to collect it and to recite it ({{transl|ar|ALA|qurʼānahu}})."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|75|17|style=nosup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other verses, the word refers to "an individual passage recited [by Muhammad]". Its [[liturgy|liturgical]] context is seen in a number of passages, for example: ''"So when {{transl|ar|ALA|al-qurʼān|italic=no}} is recited, listen to it and keep silent."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|7|204|style=nosup}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word may also assume the meaning of a codified scripture when mentioned with other scriptures such as the [[Tawrat|Torah]] and [[Injil|Gospel]].&lt;ref&gt;See "Ķur'an, al-," ''Encyclopedia of Islam Online'' and {{Cite quran|9|111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also has closely related [[synonym]]s that are employed throughout the Quran. Each synonym possesses its own distinct meaning, but its use may converge with that of {{transl|ar|ALA|qurʼān}} in certain contexts. Such terms include {{transl|ar|[[kitab|kitāb]]}} (book); {{transl|ar|[[ayah|āyah]]}} (sign); and {{transl|ar|[[Sura|sūrah]]}} (scripture). The latter two terms also denote units of revelation. In the large majority of contexts, usually with a [[definite article]] (''al-''), the word is referred to as the "revelation" (''[[wahy|waḥy]]''), that which has been "sent down" (''[[tanzil|tanzīl]]'') at intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|20|2|style=nosup}} cf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|25|32|style=nosup}} cf.&lt;/ref&gt; Other related words are: {{transl|ar|ALA|[[dhikr]]}} (remembrance), used to refer to the Quran in the sense of a reminder and warning, and {{transl|ar|ḥikmah}} (wisdom), sometimes referring to the revelation or part of it.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Welch in the ''Encyclopedia of Islam'', the verses pertaining to the usage of the word ''hikma'' should probably be interpreted in the light of IV, 105, where it is said that "Muhammad is to judge (''tahkum'') mankind on the basis of the Book sent down to him."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran describes itself as "the discernment" (''al-furqān''), "the mother book" (''umm al-kitāb''), "the guide" (''[[Huda (name)|huda]]''), "the wisdom" (''[[hikmah]]''), "the remembrance" (''dhikr'') and "the revelation" (''tanzīl''; something sent down, signifying the descent of an object from a higher place to lower place).&lt;ref name=Jaffer&gt;{{cite book|author1=Abbas Jaffer |author2=Masuma Jaffer |title=Quranic Sciences|publisher=ICAS press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-904063-30-8|pages=11–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another term is {{transl|ar|ALA|al-kitāb}} (The Book), though it is also used in the Arabic language for other scriptures, such as the Torah and the Gospels. The term ''[[mus'haf]]'' ('written work') is often used to refer to particular Quranic manuscripts but is also used in the Quran to identify earlier revealed books.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

[[File:Cave Hira.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Cave of Hira, location of Muhammad's first revelation.]]
Islamic tradition relates that [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] received [[Muhammad's first revelation|his first revelation]] in the [[Hira|Cave of Hira]] during one of his isolated retreats to the mountains. Thereafter, he received revelations over a period of 23 years. According to ''[[hadith]]'' and Muslim history, after Muhammad [[Hijra (Islam)|immigrated to Medina]] and formed an independent Muslim community, he ordered many of his [[sahabah|companions]] to recite the Quran and to learn and teach the laws, which were revealed daily. It is related that some of the [[Quraysh tribe|Quraysh]] who were taken prisoners at the [[Battle of Badr]] regained their freedom after they had taught some of the Muslims the simple writing of the time. Thus a group of Muslims gradually became literate. As it was initially spoken, the Quran was recorded on tablets, bones, and the wide, flat ends of date palm fronds. Most suras were in use amongst early Muslims since they are mentioned in numerous sayings by both [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] sources, relating Muhammad's use of the Quran as a call to Islam, the making of prayer and the manner of recitation. However, the Quran did not exist in book form at the time of Muhammad's death in 632.&lt;ref name=tabatabai5&gt;{{cite book|last=Tabatabai|first=Sayyid M.

''[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]'' narrates Muhammad describing the revelations as, "Sometimes it is (revealed) like the ringing of a bell" and [[Aisha]] reported, "I saw the Prophet being inspired Divinely on a very cold day and noticed the sweat dropping from his forehead (as the Inspiration was over)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmje.org/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/001-sbt.php Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110054749/http://www.cmje.org/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/001-sbt.php |date=10 January 2012 }}.

The agent of revelation is mentioned as the "one mighty in power",&lt;ref&gt;Quran {{Cite quran|53|5|b=n|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; the one who "grew clear to view when he was on the uppermost horizon.

According to Welch, these seizures would have been seen by those around him as convincing evidence for the superhuman origin of Muhammad's inspirations. However, Muhammad's critics accused him of being a possessed man, a [[Clairvoyant|soothsayer]] or a [[magician (paranormal)|magician]] since his experiences were similar to those claimed by such figures well known in [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|ancient Arabia]]. Welch additionally states that it remains uncertain whether these experiences occurred before or after Muhammad's initial claim of prophethood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Islam]] online, Muhammad article&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Iqra.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|Part of ''[[Al-Alaq]]'' – 96th ''sura'' of the Quran – the first revelation received by Muhammad.]]

The Quran describes Muhammad as ''"ummi"'',&lt;ref&gt;Quran {{Cite quran|7|157|b=n|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is traditionally interpreted as "illiterate," but the meaning is rather more complex. Medieval commentators such as [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Al-Tabari]] maintained that the term induced two meanings: first, the inability to read or write in general; second, the inexperience or ignorance of the previous books or scriptures (but they gave priority to the first meaning). Muhammad's illiteracy was taken as a sign of the genuineness of his prophethood. For example, according to [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]], if Muhammad had mastered writing and reading he possibly would have been suspected of having studied the books of the ancestors. Some scholars such as [[William Montgomery Watt|Watt]] prefer the second meaning of ''"ummi"'' – they take it to indicate unfamiliarity with earlier sacred texts.&lt;ref name=watt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Günther|first=Sebastian|title=Muhammad, the Illiterate Prophet: An Islamic Creed in the Quran and Quranic Exegesis|journal=Journal of Quranic Studies|year=2002|volume=4|issue=1|pages=1–26|doi=10.3366/jqs.2002.4.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final verse of the Quran was revealed on the 18th of the Islamic month of [[Dhu al-Hijjah]] in the year 10 A.H., a date that roughly corresponds to February or March 632. The verse was revealed after [[The event of Ghadir Khumm|the Prophet finished delivering his sermon at Ghadir Khumm]].

Following Muhammad's death in 632, a number of his companions who knew the Quran by heart were killed in the [[Battle of Yamama]] by [[Musaylimah]]. The first caliph, [[Abu Bakr]] (d. 634), subsequently decided to collect the book in one volume so that it could be preserved. [[Zayd ibn Thabit]] (d. 655) was the person to collect the Quran since "he used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah's Apostle". Thus, a group of scribes, most importantly Zayd, collected the verses and produced a hand-written manuscript of the complete book. The manuscript according to Zayd remained with Abu Bakr until he died. Zayd's reaction to the task and the difficulties in collecting the Quranic material from parchments, palm-leaf stalks, thin stones and from men who knew it by heart is recorded in earlier narratives. After Abu Bakr, [[Hafsa bint Umar]], Muhammad's widow, was entrusted with the manuscript. In about 650, the third Caliph [[Uthman ibn Affan]] (d. 656) began noticing slight differences in pronunciation of the Quran as Islam expanded beyond the [[Arabian Peninsula]] into [[Persia]], the [[Levant]], and North Africa. In order to preserve the sanctity of the text, he ordered a committee headed by Zayd to use Abu Bakr's copy and prepare a standard copy of the Quran.&lt;ref name=tabatabai5/&gt;&lt;ref name=sbukhari1&gt;{{cite web|last=al-Bukhari|first=Muhammad|title=Sahih Bukhari, volume 6, book 61, narrations number 509 and 510|url=http://www.sahih-bukhari.com/Pages/Bukhari_6_61.php|year=810–870|website=sahih-bukhari.com|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, within 20 years of Muhammad's death, the Quran was committed to written form.

According to [[Shia Islam|Shia]], [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]] (d. 661) compiled a complete version of the Quran shortly after Muhammad's death. The order of this text differed from that gathered later during Uthman's era in that this version had been collected in chronological order. Despite this, he made no objection against the standardized Quran and accepted the Quran in circulation.

The Quran most likely existed in scattered written form during Muhammad's lifetime. Several sources indicate that during Muhammad's lifetime a large number of his companions had memorized the revelations. Early commentaries and Islamic historical sources support the above-mentioned understanding of the Quran's early development.&lt;ref name=jecampo&gt;{{cite book|last=Campo|first=Juan E.|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|year=2009|publisher=Facts On File|isbn=978-0-8160-5454-1|pages=570–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran in its present form is generally considered by academic scholars to record the words spoken by Muhammad because the search for variants has not yielded any differences of great significance.{{page needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hbEEuTMUuX0C&amp;pg=PA283 |title=Basic Mechanics of Islamic Capitalism|website=google.com|isbn=9789881721716|last1=Hitti|first1=Edwin E|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Chicago]] professor [[Fred Donner]] states that "...there was a very early attempt to establish a uniform consonantal text of the Qurʾān from what was probably a wider and more varied group of related texts in early transmission.

In 1972, in a mosque in the city of [[Sana'a]], [[Yemen]], manuscripts were discovered that were later proved to be the most ancient Quranic text known to exist at the time. The [[Sana'a manuscript]]s contain [[palimpsest]]s, a manuscript page from which the text has been washed off to make the parchment reusable again—a practice which was common in ancient times due to scarcity of writing material. However, the faint washed-off underlying text (''scriptio inferior'') is still barely visible and believed to be "pre-Uthmanic" Quranic content, while the text written on top (''scriptio superior'') is believed to belong to Uthmanic time.&lt;ref name=jqs1&gt;{{cite journal|title='The Qur'an: Text, Interpretation and Translation' Third Biannual SOAS Conference, 16–17 October 2003|journal=Journal of Qur'anic Studies|date=April 2004|volume=6|issue=1|pages=143–145|doi=10.3366/jqs.2004.6.1.143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies using [[radiocarbon dating]] indicate that the parchments are dated to the period before 671 CE with a 99 percent probability.&lt;ref name=bergmann&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bergmann|first=Uwe|author2=Sadeghi, Behnam |title=The Codex of a Companion of the Prophet and the Qurān of the Prophet|journal=Arabica|date=September 2010|volume=57|issue=4|pages=343–436|doi=10.1163/157005810X504518}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sadeghi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sadeghi|first=Behnam|author2=Goudarzi, Mohsen |title=Ṣan'ā' 1 and the Origins of the Qur'ān|journal=Der Islam|date=March 2012|volume=87|issue=1–2|pages=1–129|doi=10.1515/islam-2011-0025|url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/islm.2010.87.issue-1-2/islam-2011-0025/islam-2011-0025.xml?format=INT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance in Islam==
{{Islam |texts}}
Muslims believe the Quran to be the book of divine guidance revealed from God to [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] through the [[Holy Spirit (Islam)|angel Gabriel]] over a period of 23 years and view the Quran as God's final revelation to humanity.&lt;ref name = LivRlgP338/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Watton, Victor, (1993), ''A student's approach to world religions:Islam'', Hodder &amp; Stoughton, pg 1. {{ISBN|978-0-340-58795-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wahy|Revelation]] in Islamic and Quranic contexts means the act of God addressing an individual, conveying a message for a greater number of recipients. The process by which the divine message comes to the heart of a messenger of God is ''[[tanzil]]'' (to send down) or ''nuzūl'' (to come down). As the Quran says, "With the truth we (God) have sent it down and with the truth it has come down."&lt;ref&gt;See:

The Quran frequently asserts in its text that it is divinely ordained. Some verses in the Quran seem to imply that even those who do not speak Arabic would understand the Quran if it were recited to them.&lt;ref name="jenssen2001"&gt;Jenssen, H., "Arabic Language" in McAuliffe et al. (eds.), ''[[Encyclopaedia of the Qur'ān]], vol. 1'' (Brill, 2001), pp. 127–135.&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran refers to a written pre-text, "the preserved tablet", that records God's speech even before it was sent down.&lt;ref name="tsonn"&gt;{{cite book|last = Sonn|first = Tamara|title = Islam : a brief history|year = 2010|publisher = Wiley-Blackwell|isbn = 978-1-4051-8093-1|edition = Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quran {{Cite quran|85|22|b=n|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of whether the Quran is eternal or created became a theological debate ([[Createdness (Qu'ran)|Quran's createdness]]) in the ninth century. [[Mu'tazila]]s, an Islamic school of theology based on reason and rational thought, held that the Quran was created while the most widespread varieties of Muslim theologians considered the Quran to be co-eternal with God and therefore uncreated. [[Sufi]] philosophers view the question as artificial or wrongly framed.&lt;ref&gt;Corbin (1993), p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims believe that the present wording of the Quran corresponds to that revealed to Muhammad, and according to their interpretation of Quran &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;{{Cite quran|15|9|b=n|s=ns}}&lt;/span&gt;, it is protected from corruption ("Indeed, it is We who sent down the Quran and indeed, We will be its guardian.").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mir Sajjad Ali |author2=Zainab Rahman |title=Islam and Indian Muslims|year=2010|publisher=Kalpaz Publications|isbn=978-8178358055|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims consider the Quran to be a guide, a sign of the prophethood of Muhammad and the truth of the religion.

===Inimitability===
{{main|I'jaz|Challenge of the Quran}}
Inimitability of the Quran (or "''I'jaz''") is the belief that no human speech can match the Quran in its content and form. The Quran is considered an inimitable miracle by Muslims, effective until the Day of Resurrection—and, thereby, the central proof granted to [[Muhammad]] in authentication of his prophetic status. The concept of inimitability originates in the Quran where in five different verses opponents are challenged to produce something like the Quran: "If men and sprites banded together to produce the like of this Quran they would never produce its like not though they backed one another."&lt;ref&gt;Quran {{Cite quran|17|88|b=n|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; So the suggestion is that if there are doubts concerning the divine authorship of the Quran, come forward and create something like it. From the ninth century, numerous works appeared which studied the Quran and examined its style and content. Medieval Muslim scholars including [[Abd al-Qahir al-Jurjani|al-Jurjani]] (d. 1078) and [[al-Baqillani]] (d. 1013) have written treatises on the subject, discussed its various aspects, and used linguistic approaches to study the Quran. Others argue that the Quran contains noble ideas, has inner meanings, maintained its freshness through the ages and has caused great transformations at the individual level and in history. Some scholars state that the Quran contains scientific information that agrees with modern science. The doctrine of the miraculousness of the Quran is further emphasized by Muhammad's illiteracy since the unlettered prophet could not have been suspected of composing the Quran.&lt;ref name=leaman/&gt;&lt;ref name=sophia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vasalou|first=Sophia|title=The Miraculous Eloquence of the Qur'an: General Trajectories and Individual Approaches|journal=Journal of Qur'anic Studies|year=2002|volume=4|issue=2|pages=23–53|doi=10.3366/jqs.2002.4.2.23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first sura of the Quran is repeated in daily prayers and in other occasions. This sura, which consists of seven verses, is the most often recited sura of the Quran:&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Praised be God, Lord of the Universe, the Beneficent, the Merciful and Master of the Day of Judgment, You alone We do worship and from You alone we do seek assistance, guide us to the right path, the path of those to whom You have granted blessings, those who are neither subject to Your anger nor have gone astray."&lt;ref&gt;Quran {{Cite quran|1|1|e=7|b=n|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other sections of the Quran of choice are also read in daily prayers.

Respect for the written text of the Quran is an important element of religious faith by many Muslims, and the Quran is treated with reverence. Based on tradition and a literal interpretation of Quran &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;{{Cite quran|56|79|b=n|s=ns}}&lt;/span&gt; ("none shall touch but those who are clean"), some Muslims believe that they must perform a ritual cleansing with water before touching a copy of the Quran, although this view is not universal.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; Worn-out copies of the Quran are wrapped in a cloth and stored indefinitely in a safe place, buried in a mosque or a Muslim cemetery, or burned and the ashes buried or scattered over water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/02/afghan_quran_burning_protests_what_s_the_right_way_to_dispose_of_a_quran_.html|title=Afghan Quran-burning protests: What's the right way to dispose of a Quran?|website=Slate Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islam, most intellectual disciplines, including Islamic theology, [[Islamic philosophy|philosophy]], [[Sufism|mysticism]] and [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]], have been concerned with the Quran or have their foundation in its teachings.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; Muslims believe that the preaching or reading of the Quran is rewarded with divine rewards variously called ''ajr'', ''[[Sawab|thawab]]'' or ''hasanat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sengers -|first1=Erik|title=Dutch and Their Gods|date=2005|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Islamic art===
The Quran also inspired [[Islamic art]]s and specifically the so-called Quranic arts of [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]] and [[Ottoman illumination|illumination]].&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; The Quran is never decorated with figurative images, but many Qurans have been highly decorated with decorative patterns in the margins of the page, or between the lines or at the start of suras. Islamic verses appear in many other media, on buildings and on objects of all sizes, such as [[mosque lamp]]s, metal work, [[Islamic pottery|pottery]] and single pages of calligraphy for [[muraqqa]]s or albums.

==Text and arrangement==
{{Main|Sura|Ayah}}
[[File:FirstSurahKoran (fragment).jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|First sura of the Quran, ''[[Al-Fatiha]]'', consisting of seven verses.]]
The Quran consists of 114 chapters of varying lengths, each known as a ''[[sura]]''. Suras are classified as [[Meccan sura|Meccan]] or [[Medinan sura|Medinan]], depending on whether the verses were revealed before or after the [[Hijra (Islam)|migration]] of Muhammad to the city of Medina. However, a sura classified as Medinan may contain Meccan verses in it and vice versa. Sura titles are derived from a name or quality discussed in the text, or from the first letters or words of the sura. Suras are arranged roughly in order of decreasing size. The sura arrangement is thus not connected to the sequence of revelation. Each sura except the ninth starts with the ''[[Basmala|Bismillah]]'' ({{lang|ar|بسم&amp;nbsp;الله&amp;nbsp;الرحمن&amp;nbsp;الرحيم}}), an Arabic phrase meaning "In the name of God". There are, however, still 114 occurrences of the ''Bismillah'' in the Quran, due to its presence in &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;Quran {{Cite quran|27|30|b=n|s=ns}}&lt;/span&gt; as the opening of [[Solomon]]'s letter to the [[Queen of Sheba]].&lt;ref&gt;See:
*"Kur`an, al-," ''Encyclopaedia of Islam Online''
*Allen (2000) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Surah95-Tin.png|thumb|upright=1.05|''[[At-Tin]]'' (the fig), 95th sura of the Quran.]]
Each sura consists of several verses, known as ''[[ayat]]'', which originally means a "sign" or "evidence" sent by God. The number of verses differs from sura to sura. An individual verse may be just a few letters or several lines. The total number of verses in the Quran is 6,236; however, the number varies if the ''bismillahs'' are counted separately.

In addition to and independent of the division into suras, there are various ways of dividing the Quran into parts of approximately equal length for convenience in reading. The 30 ''[[juz']]'' (plural ''ajzāʼ'') can be used to read through the entire Quran in a month. Some of these parts are known by names—which are the first few words by which the ''juzʼ'' starts. A ''juz''' is sometimes further divided into two ''[[hizb|ḥizb]]'' (plural ''aḥzāb''), and each ''hizb'' subdivided into four ''rubʻ al-ahzab''. The Quran is also divided into seven approximately equal parts, ''[[manzil]]'' (plural ''manāzil''), for it to be recited in a week.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

A different structure is provided by semantical units resembling paragraphs and comprising roughly ten ''ayat'' each. Such a section is called a [[ruku|rukū`]].

The ''[[Muqattaʿat]]'' ({{lang-ar|حروف مقطعات }} ''ḥurūf muqaṭṭaʿāt'' "disjoined letters" or "disconnected letters";&lt;ref&gt;مقطعات is the plural of a participle from [[:wikt:قطع|قطع]] "to cut, break".&lt;/ref&gt; also "mysterious letters") are  combinations of between one and five [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic letters]] figuring at the beginning of 29 out of the 114 surahs (chapters) of the [Quran just after the basmala.&lt;ref name=Massey2005&gt;Massey, Keith. "Mysterious Letters."  in  Jane Dammen McAuliffe (ed.) [[Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān]]. Vol. 3 (205),  p. 472 ([http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-the-quran/mysterious-letters-EQCOM_00128 referenceworks.brillonline.com]).&lt;/ref&gt; The letters are also known as ''fawātih'' ({{lang|ar|فواتح}}) or "openers" as they form the opening verse of their respective suras . Four surahs are named for their ''muqatta'at'', [[Ta-Ha|''Ṭāʾ-Hāʾ'']], [[Ya Sin|''Yāʾ-Sīn'']], [[Sad (sura)|''Ṣād'']]  and [[Qaf (sura)|'' Qāf'']]. The original significance of the letters is unknown. [[Tafsir]] ([[exegesis]]) has interpreted them as abbreviations for either [[names of God in Islam|names or qualities of God]] or for the names or content of the respective surahs.

According to one estimate the Quran consists of 77,430 words, 18,994 unique words, 12,183 [[Word stem|stems]], 3,382 [[Lemma (morphology)|lemmas]] and 1,685 [[Root (linguistics)|roots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dukes|first=Kais|title=RE: Number of Unique Words in the Quran|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/comp-quran@comp.leeds.ac.uk/msg00223.html|website=www.mail-archive.com|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
{{Main|God in Islam|Islamic eschatology|Prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic attitudes towards science|Legends and the Quran}}
The Quranic content is concerned with basic Islamic beliefs including the existence of [[God in Islam|God]] and the [[Islamic eschatology|resurrection]]. Narratives of the early [[Prophets in Islam|prophets]], ethical and legal subjects, historical events of Muhammad's time, charity and [[Salat|prayer]] also appear in the Quran. The Quranic verses contain general exhortations regarding right and wrong and historical events are related to outline general moral lessons. Verses pertaining to natural phenomena have been interpreted by Muslims as an indication of the authenticity of the Quranic message.&lt;ref name=saeed&gt;{{cite book|last=Saeed|first=Abdullah|title=The Qurʼan : an introduction|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415421249|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monotheism===
The central theme of the Quran is [[monotheism]]. God is depicted as living, eternal, omniscient and omnipotent (see, e.g., &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;Quran {{Cite quran|2|20|b=n|s=ns}}, {{Cite quran|2|29|b=n|s=ns}}, {{Cite quran|2|255|b=n|s=ns}}&lt;/span&gt;). God's omnipotence appears above all in his power to create. He is the creator of everything, of the heavens and the earth and what is between them (see, e.g., &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;Quran {{Cite quran|13|16|b=n|s=ns}}, {{Cite quran|50|38|b=n|s=ns}}, etc.).&lt;/span&gt; All human beings are equal in their utter dependence upon God,{{better source|date=December 2016}} and their well-being depends upon their acknowledging that fact and living accordingly.&lt;ref name=watt/&gt;&lt;ref name=saeed/&gt;
[[File:Quran rzabasi4.JPG|thumb|A 12th-century Quran manuscript at [[Reza Abbasi Museum]].]]

The Quran uses [[Cosmological argument|cosmological]] and contingency arguments in various verses without referring to the terms to prove the [[existence of God]]. Therefore, the universe is originated and needs an originator, and whatever exists must have a sufficient cause for its existence. Besides, the design of the universe is frequently referred to as a point of contemplation: "It is He who has created seven heavens in harmony. You cannot see any fault in God's creation; then look again: Can you see any flaw?"&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quran {{Cite quran|67|3|b=n|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref name=leaman/&gt;

===Eschatology===
{{main|Islamic eschatology}}
The doctrine of the last day and [[eschatology]] (the final fate of the universe) may be reckoned as the second great doctrine of the Quran.&lt;ref name=watt/&gt; It is estimated that approximately one-third of the Quran is eschatological, dealing with the afterlife in the next world and with the day of judgment at the end of time.&lt;ref name=rippin/&gt; There is a reference to the afterlife on most pages of the Quran and belief in the afterlife is often referred to in conjunction with belief in God as in the common expression: "Believe in God and the last day".&lt;ref name=haleem&gt;{{cite book|last=Haleem|first=Muhammad Abdel|title=Understanding the Qur'an : themes and style|year=2005|publisher=I.B. Tauris|isbn=9781860646508|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[sura]]s such as 44, 56, 75, 78, 81 and 101 are directly related to the afterlife and its preparations. Some suras indicate the closeness of the event and warn people to be prepared for the imminent day. For instance, the first verses of Sura 22, which deal with the mighty earthquake and the situations of people on that day, represent this style of divine address: "O People! Be respectful to your Lord. The earthquake of the Hour is a mighty thing."&lt;ref name=leaman/&gt;

The Quran is often vivid in its depiction of what will happen at the end time. Watt describes the Quranic view of End Time:&lt;ref name=watt/&gt;
:"The climax of history, when the present world comes to an end, is referred to in various ways. It is 'the Day of Judgment,' 'the Last Day,' 'the Day of Resurrection,' or simply 'the Hour.' Less frequently it is 'the Day of Distinction' (when the good are separated from the evil), 'the Day of the Gathering' (of men to the presence of God) or 'the Day of the Meeting' (of men with God). The Hour comes suddenly. It is heralded by a shout, by a thunderclap, or by the blast of a trumpet. A cosmic upheaval then takes place. The mountains dissolve into dust, the seas boil up, the sun is darkened, the stars fall and the sky is rolled up. God appears as Judge, but his presence is hinted at rather than described. [...] The central interest, of course, is in the gathering of all mankind before the Judge. Human beings of all ages, restored to life, join the throng. To the scoffing objection of the unbelievers that former generations had been dead a long time and were now dust and mouldering bones, the reply is that God is nevertheless able to restore them to life."

The Quran does not assert a natural [[immortality]] of the human [[soul]], since man's existence is dependent on the will of God: when he wills, he causes man to die; and when he wills, he raises him to life again in a bodily [[resurrection]].&lt;ref name=rcmartin/&gt;

===Prophets===
According to the Quran, God communicated with man and made his will known through signs and revelations. [[Prophets in Islam|Prophets]], or 'Messengers of God', received revelations and delivered them to humanity. The message has been identical and for all humankind. "Nothing is said to you that was not said to the messengers before you, that your lord has at his Command forgiveness as well as a most Grievous Penalty."&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quran {{Cite quran|41|43|b=n|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The revelation does not come directly from God to the prophets. Angels acting as God's messengers deliver the divine revelation to them. This comes out in &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;Quran {{Cite quran|42|51|b=n|s=ns}}&lt;/span&gt;, in which it is stated: "It is not for any mortal that God should speak to them, except by revelation, or from behind a veil, or by sending a messenger to reveal by his permission whatsoever He will."&lt;ref name=rippin/&gt;&lt;ref name=rcmartin&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Richard C.|title=Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim world|year=2003|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|isbn=978-0028656038|pages=568–62 (By Farid Esack)|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0028656032|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethico-religious concepts===
Belief is a fundamental aspect of morality in the Quran, and scholars have tried to determine the semantic contents of "belief" and "believer" in the Quran.&lt;ref name=toshihiko&gt;{{cite book|last=Izutsu|first=Toshihiko|title=Ethico-religious concepts in the Qur'an|year=2007|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|isbn=978-0773524279|page=184|edition=Repr. 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ethico-legal concepts and exhortations dealing with righteous conduct are linked to a profound awareness of God, thereby emphasizing the importance of faith, accountability, and the belief in each human's ultimate encounter with God. People are invited to perform acts of charity, especially for the needy. Believers who "spend of their wealth by night and by day, in secret and in public" are promised that they "shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve".&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quran {{Cite quran|2|274|b=n|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It also affirms family life by legislating on matters of marriage, divorce, and inheritance. A number of practices, such as usury and gambling, are prohibited. The Quran is one of the fundamental sources of Islamic law (''[[sharia]]''). Some formal religious practices receive significant attention in the Quran including the formal prayers (''[[salat]]'') and fasting in the month of [[Ramadan]]. As for the manner in which the prayer is to be conducted, the Quran refers to prostration.&lt;ref name=jecampo/&gt;&lt;ref name=rcmartin/&gt; The term for charity, ''[[zakat]]'', literally means purification. Charity, according to the Quran, is a means of self-purification.&lt;ref name=tsonn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quran {{Cite quran|9|103|b=n|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encouragement for the sciences===

The astrophysicist [[Nidhal Guessoum]] while being highly critical of pseudo-scientific claims made about the Quran, has highlighted the encouragement for sciences that the Quran provides by developing "the concept of knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=Nidhal Guessoum|title=Islam's Quantum Question: Reconciling Muslim Tradition and Modern Science|page=174|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1848855175}}&lt;/ref&gt; He writes: "The Qur'an draws attention to the danger of conjecturing without evidence (''And follow not that of which you have not the (certain) knowledge of...'' 17:36) and in several different verses asks Muslims to require proofs (''Say: Bring your proof if you are truthful'' 2:111), both in matters of theological belief and in natural science." Guessoum cites Ghaleb Hasan on the definition of "proof" according the Quran being "clear and strong... convincing evidence or argument." Also, such a proof cannot rely on an [[argument from authority]], citing verse 5:104. Lastly, both assertions and rejections require a proof, according to verse 4:174.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=Nidhal Guessoum|title=Islam's Quantum Question: Reconciling Muslim Tradition and Modern Science|page=56|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1848855175}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ismail al-Faruqi]] and [[Taha Jabir Alalwani]] are of the view that any reawakening of the Muslim civilization must start with the Quran; however, the biggest obstacle on this route is the "centuries old heritage of tafseer (exegesis) and other classical disciplines" which inhibit a "universal, epidemiological and systematic conception" of the Quran's message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=Nidhal Guessoum|title=Islam's Quantum Question: Reconciling Muslim Tradition and Modern Science|pages=117–118|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1848855175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Muhammad Iqbal]], considered the Quran's methodology and epistemology to be empirical and rational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=Nidhal Guessoum|title=Islam's Quantum Question: Reconciling Muslim Tradition and Modern Science|pages=58–59|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1848855175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It's generally accepted{{By whom|date=December 2016}} that there are around 750 verses{{which|date=December 2016}} in the Quran dealing with natural phenomena. In many of these verses the study of nature is ''"encouraged and highly recommended,"'' and historical Islamic scientists like [[Al-Biruni]] and [[Al-Battani]] derived their inspiration from verses of the Quran.{{additional citation needed|date=December 2016}} [[Mohammad Hashim Kamali]] has stated that "scientific observation, experimental knowledge  and rationality" are the primary tools with which humanity can achieve the goals laid out for it in the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=Nidhal Guessoum|title=Islam's Quantum Question: Reconciling Muslim Tradition and Modern Science|page=63|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1848855175}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ziauddin Sardar]] built a case for Muslims having developed the foundations of modern science, by highlighting the repeated calls of the Quran to observe and reflect upon natural phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=Nidhal Guessoum|title=Islam's Quantum Question: Reconciling Muslim Tradition and Modern Science|page=75|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1848855175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physicist [[Abdus Salam]], in his Nobel Prize banquet address, quoted a well known verse from the Quran (67:3–4) and then stated: "This in effect is the faith of all physicists: the deeper we seek, the more is our wonder excited, the more is the dazzlement of our gaze".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=Nidhal Guessoum|title=Islam's Quantum Question: Reconciling Muslim Tradition and Modern Science|page=131|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1848855175}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Salam's core beliefs was that there is no contradiction between Islam and the discoveries that science allows humanity to make about nature and the universe. Salam also held the opinion that the Quran and the Islamic spirit of study and rational reflection was the source of extraordinary civilizational development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=Nidhal Guessoum|title=Islam's Quantum Question: Reconciling Muslim Tradition and Modern Science|page=132|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1848855175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salam highlights, in particular, the work of [[Alhazen|Ibn al-Haytham]] and [[Al-Biruni]] as the pioneers of empiricism who introduced the experimental approach, breaking with Aristotle's influence and thus giving birth to modern science. Salam was also careful to differentiate between metaphysics and physics, and advised against empirically probing certain matters on which "physics is silent and will remain so," such as the doctrine of "creation from nothing" which in Salam's view is outside the limits of science and thus "gives way" to religious considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=Nidhal Guessoum|title=Islam's Quantum Question: Reconciling Muslim Tradition and Modern Science|page=134|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1848855175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary style==
[[File:Touba3.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Boys studying Quran, [[Touba, Senegal]]]]
The Quran's message is conveyed with various literary structures and devices. In the original Arabic, the suras and verses employ [[phonetics|phonetic]] and [[theme (literature)|thematic]] structures that assist the audience's efforts to recall the message of the text. Muslims{{Who|date=February 2010}} assert (according to the Quran itself) that the Quranic content and style is inimitable.&lt;ref name = Issa&gt;[[Issa Boullata]], "Literary Structure of Quran", ''Encyclopedia of the Qurʾān, vol.3 p.192, 204&lt;/ref&gt;

The language of the Quran has been described as "rhymed prose" as it partakes of both poetry and prose; however, this description runs the risk of failing to convey the rhythmic quality of Quranic language, which is more poetic in some parts and more prose-like in others. Rhyme, while found throughout the Quran, is conspicuous in many of the earlier Meccan suras, in which relatively short verses throw the rhyming words into prominence. The effectiveness of such a form is evident for instance in Sura 81, and there can be no doubt that these passages impressed the conscience of the hearers. Frequently a change of rhyme from one set of verses to another signals a change in the subject of discussion. Later sections also preserve this form but the style is more expository.&lt;ref name=rippin /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=369&amp;letter=K&amp;search=Quran Jewishencyclopedia.com] – Körner, Moses B. Eliezer&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quranic text seems to have no beginning, middle, or end, its nonlinear structure being akin to a web or net.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; The textual arrangement is sometimes considered to exhibit lack of continuity, absence of any chronological or thematic order and repetitiousness.&lt;ref name=blomm&gt;"The final process of collection and codification of the Quran text was guided by one {{sic|?|hide=y|over-|arching}} principle: God's words must not in any way be distorted or sullied by human intervention. For this reason, no serious attempt, apparently, was made to edit the numerous revelations, organize them into thematic units, or present them in chronological order... This has given rise in the past to a great deal of criticism by European and American scholars of Islam, who find the Quran disorganized, repetitive and very difficult to read." ''Approaches to the Asian Classics'', Irene Blomm, William Theodore De Bary, Columbia University Press, 1990, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pepys&gt;Samuel Pepys: "One feels it difficult to see how any mortal ever could consider this Quran as a Book written in Heaven, too good for the Earth; as a well-written book, or indeed as a book at all; and not a bewildered rhapsody; written, so far as writing goes, as badly as almost any book ever was!" {{cite web |url=http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/display.php?table=review&amp;id=21 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518213253/http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/display.php?table=review&amp;id=21 |archivedate=18 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Sells]], citing the work of the critic [[Norman O. Brown]], acknowledges Brown's observation that the seeming disorganization of Quranic literary expression – its scattered or fragmented mode of composition in Sells's phrase – is in fact a literary device capable of delivering profound effects as if the intensity of the prophetic message were shattering the vehicle of human language in which it was being communicated.&lt;ref name = ApproachQuran&gt;Michael Sells, ''Approaching the Qur'ān'' (White Cloud Press, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman O. Brown, "The Apocalypse of Islam". ''Social Text'' 3:8 (1983–1984)&lt;/ref&gt; Sells also addresses the much-discussed repetitiveness of the Quran, seeing this, too, as a literary device.

A text is [[Self-reference|self-referential]] when it speaks about itself and makes reference to itself. According to Stefan Wild, the Quran demonstrates this [[metatextuality]] by explaining, classifying, interpreting and justifying the words to be transmitted. Self-referentiality is evident in those passages where the Quran refers to itself as revelation (''tanzil''), remembrance (''dhikr''), news (''naba'''), criterion (''furqan'') in a self-designating manner (explicitly asserting its Divinity, "And this is a blessed Remembrance that We have sent down; so are you now denying it?"),&lt;ref&gt;Quran {{Cite quran|21|50|b=n|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in the frequent appearance of the "Say" tags, when Muhammad is commanded to speak (e.g., "Say: 'God's guidance is the true guidance'", "Say: 'Would you then dispute with us concerning God?'"). According to Wild the Quran is highly self-referential. The feature is more evident in early Meccan suras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wild|first=ed. by Stefan|title=Self-referentiality in the Qur'an|year=2006|publisher=Harrassowitz|location=Wiesbaden|isbn=978-3447053839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
{{Main|Tafsir}}
[[File:Tapurian Qur'an (Al-Kusar).PNG|thumb|upright=1.25|An early interpretation of Sura 108 of the Quran]]
The Quran has sparked a huge body of commentary and explication (''tafsir''), aimed at explaining the "meanings of the Quranic verses, clarifying their import and finding out their significance".&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almizan.org/|title=Tafsir Al-Mizan|website=almizan.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tafsir is one of the earliest academic activities of Muslims. According to the Quran, Muhammad was the first person who described the meanings of verses for early Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|151|style=nosup}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early exegetes included a few [[Companions of Muhammad]], like ʻ[[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], ʻ[[Abdullah ibn Abbas]], ʻ[[Abdullah ibn Umar]] and [[Ubayy ibn Kab|Ubayy ibn Kaʻb]]. Exegesis in those days was confined to the explanation of literary aspects of the verse, the background of its revelation and, occasionally, interpretation of one verse with the help of the other. If the verse was about a historical event, then sometimes a few traditions (''[[hadith]]'') of Muhammad were narrated to make its meaning clear.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Because the Quran is spoken in [[classical Arabic]], many of the later converts to Islam (mostly non-Arabs) did not always understand the Quranic Arabic, they did not catch allusions that were clear to early Muslims fluent in Arabic and they were concerned with reconciling apparent conflict of themes in the Quran. Commentators erudite in Arabic explained the allusions, and perhaps most importantly, explained which Quranic verses had been revealed early in Muhammad's prophetic career, as being appropriate to the very earliest Muslim community, and which had been revealed later, canceling out or "[[naskh (exegesis)|abrogating]]" (''nāsikh'') the earlier text (''mansūkh'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=7&amp;ID=2656&amp;CATE=1|title=How can there be abrogation in the Quran?|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608024345/http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=7&amp;ID=2656&amp;CATE=1|archivedate=8 June 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mostmerciful.com/abrogation-and-substitution.htm|title=Are the verses of the Qur'an Abrogated and/or Substituted?|website=mostmerciful.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501101528/http://www.mostmerciful.com/abrogation-and-substitution.htm|archivedate=1 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, however, maintain that no abrogation has taken place in the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Islahi|first=Amin Ahsan|title=Abrogation in the Qur'ān|url=http://www.monthly-renaissance.com/issue/content.aspx?id=426|website=Renaissance Journal|accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] has published a ten-volume Urdu commentary on the Quran, with the name ''Tafseer e Kabir''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mirza Bashiruddin Mahmood Ahmad |url=https://archive.org/details/TafseerKabeerMirzaBashiruddinMahmoodAhmad |title=Tafseer-e-Kabeer Urdu Vol. 1 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Following this commentary, a five volume English commentary was also published as [[The English Commentary of the Holy Quran]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ahmadiyya Muslim Community |url=https://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/guide.htm?region=E1 |title=  English with 5 Volume Commentary  |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Esoteric interpretation===

{{Main|Esoteric interpretation of the Quran}}
Esoteric or [[sufism|Sufi]] interpretation attempts to unveil the inner meanings of the Quran. Sufism moves beyond the apparent (''zahir'') point of the verses and instead relates Quranic verses to the inner or esoteric (''batin'') and metaphysical dimensions of consciousness and existence.&lt;ref name=alangodlas&gt;{{cite book|last=Godlas|first=Alan|title=The Blackwell companion to the Qur'an|year=2008|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1405188203|pages=350–362|edition=Pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sands, esoteric interpretations are more suggestive than declarative, they are allusions (''isharat'') rather than explanations (''tafsir''). They indicate possibilities as much as they demonstrate the insights of each writer.&lt;ref name=kristin&gt;{{cite book|last=Sands|first=Kristin Zahra|title=Sufi commentaries on the Qur'an in classical Islam|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415366854|edition=1. publ., transferred to digital print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sufi interpretation, according to Annabel Keeler, also exemplifies the use of the theme of love, as for instance can be seen in Qushayri's interpretation of the Quran. &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;Quran {{Cite quran|7|143|b=n|s=ns}}&lt;/span&gt; says:

{{bquote|when Moses came at the time we appointed, and his Lord spoke to him, he said, 'My Lord, show yourself to me! Let me see you!' He said, 'you shall not see me but look at that mountain, if it remains standing firm you will see me.' When his Lord revealed Himself to the mountain, He made it crumble. Moses fell down unconscious. When he recovered, he said, 'Glory be to you! I repent to you! I am the first to believe!'}}

Moses, in 7:143, comes the way of those who are in love, he asks for a vision but his desire is denied, he is made to suffer by being commanded to look at other than the Beloved while the mountain is able to see God. The mountain crumbles and Moses faints at the sight of God's manifestation upon the mountain. In Qushayri's words, Moses came like thousands of men who traveled great distances, and there was nothing left to Moses of Moses. In that state of annihilation from himself, Moses was granted the unveiling of the realities. From the Sufi point of view, God is the always the beloved and the wayfarer's longing and suffering lead to realization of the truths.&lt;ref name=keeler&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keeler|first=Annabel|title=Sufi ''tafsir'' as a Mirror: al-Qushayri the murshid in his Lataif al-isharat|journal=Journal of Qur'anic Studies|year=2006|volume=8|issue=1|pages=1–21|doi=10.3366/jqs.2006.8.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Men reading the Koran in Umayyad Mosque, Damascus, Syria.jpg|thumb|left|Men reading the Quran at the Umayyad Mosque, [[Damascus, Syria]]]]
[[Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei]] says that according to the popular explanation among the later exegetes, ''ta'wil'' indicates the particular meaning a verse is directed towards. The meaning of revelation (''[[tanzil]]''), as opposed to ''ta'wil'', is clear in its accordance to the obvious meaning of the words as they were revealed. But this explanation has become so widespread that, at present, it has become the primary meaning of ''ta'wil'', which originally meant "to return" or "the returning place". In Tabatabaei's view, what has been rightly called ''ta'wil'', or hermeneutic interpretation of the Quran, is not concerned simply with the denotation of words. Rather, it is concerned with certain truths and realities that transcend the comprehension of the common run of men; yet it is from these truths and realities that the principles of doctrine and the practical injunctions of the Quran issue forth. Interpretation is not the meaning of the verse—rather it transpires through that meaning, in a special sort of transpiration. There is a spiritual reality—which is the main objective of ordaining a law, or the basic aim in describing a divine attribute—and then there is an actual significance that a Quranic story refers to.&lt;ref name="Ta'wil"&gt;[http://almizan.org/new/special/principles.asp Tabataba'I, Tafsir Al-Mizan, The Principles of Interpretation of the Quran]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201023355/http://almizan.org/new/special/principles.asp |date=1 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Meaning"&gt;[http://almizan.org/Discourses/QD21.asp Tabataba'I, Tafsir Al-Mizan, Topic: Decisive and Ambiguous verses and "ta'wil"]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208164643/http://almizan.org/Discourses/QD21.asp |date=8 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:عکس های مراسم ترتیل خوانی یا جزء خوانی یا قرائت قرآن در ایام ماه رمضان در حرم فاطمه معصومه در شهر قم 16.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Shia]] Muslim male children reciting the Quran during [[Ramadan]], in [[Qom]], [[Iran]]]]
According to Shia beliefs, those who are firmly rooted in knowledge like Muhammad and the imams know the secrets of the Quran. According to Tabatabaei, the statement "none knows its interpretation except God" remains valid, without any opposing or qualifying clause.&lt;ref&gt;Quran {{Cite quran|3|7|b=n|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, so far as this verse is concerned, the knowledge of the Quran's interpretation is reserved for God. But Tabatabaei uses other verses and concludes that those who are purified by God know the interpretation of the Quran to a certain extent.&lt;ref name="The Meaning"/&gt;

According to [[Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei|Tabatabaei]], there are acceptable and unacceptable esoteric interpretations. Acceptable ''[[ta'wil]]'' refers to the meaning of a verse beyond its literal meaning; rather the implicit meaning, which ultimately is known only to [[God]] and can't be comprehended directly through human thought alone. The verses in question here refer to the human qualities of coming, going, sitting, satisfaction, anger and sorrow, which are apparently attributed to [[God in Islam|God]]. Unacceptable ''ta'wil'' is where one "transfers" the apparent meaning of a verse to a different meaning by means of a proof; this method is not without obvious inconsistencies. Although this unacceptable ''ta'wil'' has gained considerable acceptance, it is incorrect and cannot be applied to the Quranic verses. The correct interpretation is that reality a verse refers to. It is found in all verses, the decisive and the ambiguous alike; it is not a sort of a meaning of the word; it is a fact that is too sublime for words. God has dressed them with words to bring them a bit nearer to our minds; in this respect they are like proverbs that are used to create a picture in the mind, and thus help the hearer to clearly grasp the intended idea.&lt;ref name="The Meaning"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tabatabaee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maaref-foundation.com/english/beliefs/quran/05.htm|title=Tabatabaee (1988), pp. 37–45|website=maaref-foundation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History of Sufi commentaries====
One of the notable authors of esoteric interpretation prior to the 12th century is Sulami (d. 1021) without whose work the majority of very early Sufi commentaries would not have been preserved. Sulami's major commentary is a book named ''haqaiq al-tafsir'' ("Truths of Exegesis") which is a compilation of commentaries of earlier Sufis. From the 11th century onwards several other works appear, including commentaries by Qushayri (d. 1074), Daylami (d. 1193), Shirazi (d. 1209) and Suhrawardi (d. 1234). These works include material from Sulami's books plus the author's contributions. Many works are written in Persian such as the works of Maybudi (d. 1135) ''kashf al-asrar'' ("the unveiling of the secrets").&lt;ref name=alangodlas/&gt; [[Rumi]] (d. 1273) wrote a vast amount of mystical poetry in his book ''[[Masnavi|Mathnawi]]''. Rumi makes heavy use of the Quran in his poetry, a feature that is sometimes omitted in translations of Rumi's work. A large number of Quranic passages can be found in ''Mathnawi'', which some consider a kind of Sufi interpretation of the Quran. Rumi's book is not exceptional for containing citations from and elaboration on the Quran, however, Rumi does mention Quran more frequently.&lt;ref name=jmojaddedi&gt;{{cite book|last=Mojaddedi|first=Jawid|title=The Blackwell companion to the Qur'an|year=2008|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1405188203|pages=363–373|edition=Pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simnani (d. 1336) wrote two influential works of esoteric exegesis on the Quran. He reconciled notions of God's manifestation through and in the physical world with the sentiments of Sunni Islam.&lt;ref name=jelias&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elias|first=Jamal|title=Sufi ''tafsir'' Reconsidered: Exploring the Development of a Genre|journal=Journal of Qur'anic Studies|year=2010|volume=12|pages=41–55|doi=10.3366/jqs.2010.0104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comprehensive Sufi commentaries appear in the 18th century such as the work of Ismail Hakki Bursevi (d. 1725). His work ''ruh al-Bayan'' (the Spirit of Elucidation) is a voluminous exegesis. Written in Arabic, it combines the author's own ideas with those of his predecessors (notably Ibn Arabi and [[Al-Ghazali|Ghazali]]).&lt;ref name=jelias/&gt;

===Levels of meaning===
[[File:Quran rzabasi1.JPG|thumb|9th-century Quran in [[Reza Abbasi Museum]]]] [[File:IslamicGalleryBritishMuseum3.jpg |thumb| An 11th-century North African Quran at the [[British Museum]] ]]
Unlike the Salafis and Zahiri, Shias and Sufis as well as some other [[Islamic philosophy|Muslim philosophers]] believe the meaning of the Quran is not restricted to the literal aspect.&lt;ref name="Corbin 1993, p.7"&gt;Corbin (1993), p.7&lt;/ref&gt; For them, it is an essential idea that the Quran also has inward aspects. [[Henry Corbin]] narrates a ''[[hadith]]'' that goes back to [[Muhammad]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Quran possesses an external appearance and a hidden depth, an exoteric meaning and an esoteric meaning. This esoteric meaning in turn conceals an esoteric meaning (this depth possesses a depth, after the image of the celestial Spheres, which are enclosed within each other). So it goes on for seven esoteric meanings (seven depths of hidden depth).&lt;ref name="Corbin 1993, p.7"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to this view, it has also become evident that the inner meaning of the Quran does not eradicate or invalidate its outward meaning. Rather, it is like the soul, which gives life to the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almizan.org/new/special/Aspects.asp Tabatabaee, Tafsir Al-Mizan]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705110108/http://www.almizan.org/new/special/Aspects.asp |date=5 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Corbin considers the Quran to play a part in [[Islamic philosophy]], because [[gnosiology]] itself goes hand in hand with [[prophet#Islam|prophetology]].&lt;ref&gt;Corbin (1993), p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentaries dealing with the ''[[Zahir (Islam)|zahir]]'' (outward aspects) of the text are called ''tafsir'', and hermeneutic and esoteric commentaries dealing with the ''[[Batin (Islam)|batin]]'' are called ''[[Esoteric interpretation of the Quran|ta'wil]]'' ("interpretation" or "explanation"), which involves taking the text back to its beginning. Commentators with an esoteric slant believe that the ultimate meaning of the Quran is known only to God.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; In contrast, [[Quranic literalism]], followed by [[Salafis]] and [[Zahiri]]s, is the belief that the Quran should only be taken at its apparent meaning.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Reappropriation===
Reappropriation is the name of the [[hermeneutical]] style of some ex-Muslims who have converted to Christianity. Their style or reinterpretation is ad hoc and unsystematized and geared towards [[apologetics]]. This tradition of interpretation draws on the following practices: grammatical renegotiation, renegotiation of textual preference, retrieval, and concession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Duane Alexander|title=REAPPROPRIATION: AN ACCOMMODATIONIST HERMENEUTIC OF ISLAMIC CHRISTIANITY|journal=St Francis Magazine|date=June 2009|volume=5|issue=3|pages=30–33|url=https://www.academia.edu/1482551|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations==
{{Main|Quran translations}}
{{See also|List of translations of the Quran}}
Translating the Quran has always been problematic and difficult. Many argue that the Quranic text cannot be reproduced in another language or form.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=21 November 2008 | url=http://www.slate.com/id/2204849/?from=rss | website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | last=Aslan | first=Reza | title=How To Read the Quran | date=20 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, an Arabic word may have a [[Polysemy|range of meanings]] depending on the context, making an accurate translation even more difficult.&lt;ref name =leaman /&gt;

Nevertheless, the Quran has been [[translation|translated]] into most [[Africa]]n, [[Asia]]n, and [[Europe]]an languages.&lt;ref name =leaman /&gt; The first translator of the Quran was [[Salman the Persian]], who translated surat ''[[al-Fatiha]]'' into [[Persian language|Persian]] during the seventh century.&lt;ref&gt;An-Nawawi, Al-Majmu', (Cairo, Matba‘at at-Tadamun n.d.), 380.&lt;/ref&gt; Another translation of the Quran was completed in 884 in Alwar ([[Sindh]], [[India]], now [[Pakistan]]) by the orders of Abdullah bin Umar bin Abdul Aziz on the request of the Hindu Raja Mehruk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=English Translations of the Quran|date=July 2009|website=[[Crescent (magazine)|Crescent]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429213509/http://www.monthlycrescent.com/understanding-the-quran/english-translations-of-the-quran/|archivedate=29 April 2014 |url=http://www.monthlycrescent.com/understanding-the-quran/english-translations-of-the-quran/|publisher=Monthlycrescent.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first fully attested complete translations of the Quran were done between the 10th and 12th centuries in [[Persian language|Persian]]. The [[Samanid Empire|Samanid]] king, [[Mansur I]] (961–976), ordered a group of scholars from [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] to translate the [[Tafsir al-Tabari]], originally in Arabic, into Persian. Later in the 11th century, one of the students of [[Khwaja Abdullah Ansari|Abu Mansur Abdullah al-Ansari]] wrote a complete ''[[tafsir]]'' of the Quran in Persian. In the 12th century, [[Abu Hafs Omar al-Nasafi|Najm al-Din Abu Hafs al-Nasafi]] translated the Quran into Persian. The manuscripts of all three books have survived and have been published several times.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Islamic tradition also holds that translations were made for Emperor Negus of Abyssinia and Byzantine Emperor [[Heraclius]], as both [[Muhammad's letters to the Heads-of-State|received letters by Muhammad]] containing verses from the Quran.&lt;ref name = leaman /&gt; In early centuries, the permissibility of translations was not an issue, but whether one could use translations in prayer.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In 1936, translations in 102 languages were known.&lt;ref name =leaman /&gt; In 2010, the ''[[Hürriyet Daily News and Economic Review]]'' reported that the Quran was presented in 112 languages at the 18th International Quran Exhibition in Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In 1734, [[George Sale]] produced the first scholarly translation of the Quran into English; another was produced by [[Richard Bell (Arabist)|Richard Bell]] in 1937, and yet another by [[Arthur John Arberry]] in 1955. All these translators were non-Muslims. There have been numerous translations by Muslims. The [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] has published translations of the Quran in 50 different languages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alislam.org/library/links/translations.html|title=Ahmadiyya Muslim Community|website=alislam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; besides a [[The English Commentary of the Holy Quran|five-volume English commentary]] and an [[The Holy Quran - Arabic Text and English translation|English translation of the Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/TafseerEngCommQuranLong|website=us.archive.org|title=Quran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with translations of the Bible, the English translators have sometimes favored archaic English words and constructions over their more modern or conventional equivalents; for example, two widely read translators, A. Yusuf Ali and M. Marmaduke Pickthall, use the plural and singular "ye" and "thou" instead of the more common "[[you]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surah 3 – Read Quran Online|url=http://readquranonline.info/surah003.html|accessdate=21 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118015724/http://www.readquranonline.info/surah003.html|archivedate=18 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recitation==
===Rules of recitation===
{{See also|Tajwid}}
The proper recitation of the Quran is the subject of a separate discipline named ''[[tajwid]]'' which determines in detail how the Quran should be recited, how each individual syllable is to be pronounced, the need to pay attention to the places where there should be a pause, to [[elision]]s, where the pronunciation should be long or short, where letters should be sounded together and where they should be kept separate, etc. It may be said that this discipline studies the laws and methods of the proper recitation of the Quran and covers three main areas: the proper pronunciation of [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s (the articulation of the Quranic [[phoneme]]s), the rules of pause in recitation and of resumption of recitation, and the musical and melodious features of recitation.&lt;ref name=leaman/&gt;

In order to avoid incorrect pronunciation, reciters who are not native speakers of Arabic language follow a program of training in countries such as Egypt or Saudi Arabia. The recitations of a few Egyptian reciters were highly influential in the development of the art of recitation. Southeast Asia is well known for world-class recitation, evidenced in the popularity of the woman reciters such as [[Maria Ulfah]] of [[Jakarta]].&lt;ref name=leaman/&gt;

There are two types of recitation: ''murattal'' is at a slower pace, used for study and practice. ''[[Mujawwad]]'' refers to a slow recitation that deploys heightened technical artistry and melodic modulation, as in public performances by trained experts. It is directed to and dependent upon an audience for the ''mujawwad'' reciter seeks to involve the listeners.&lt;ref name=nelson&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Kristina|title=The art of reciting the Qur'an|year=2001|publisher=American Univ. in Cairo Press|location=Cairo [u.a.]|isbn=978-9774245947|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variant readings===
{{See also|Qira'at}}
[[File:Qur'an folio 11th century kufic.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Page of the Quran with vocalization marks]]
Vocalization markers indicating specific vowel sounds were introduced into the [[Arabic language]] by the end of the 9th century. The first Quranic manuscripts lacked these marks, therefore several recitations remain acceptable. The variation in readings of the text permitted by the nature of the defective vocalization led to an increase in the number of readings during the 10th century. The 10th-century Muslim scholar from [[Baghdad]], [[Abu Bakr Ibn Mujāhid|Ibn Mujāhid]], is famous for establishing seven acceptable textual readings of the Quran. He studied various readings and their trustworthiness and chose seven 8th-century readers from the cities of [[Mecca]], [[Medina]], [[Kufa]], [[Basra]] and [[Damascus]]. Ibn Mujahid did not explain why he chose seven readers, rather than six or ten, but this may be related to a prophetic tradition (Muhammad's saying) reporting that the Quran had been revealed in seven "''ahruf''" (meaning seven letters or modes). Today, the most popular readings are those transmitted by [[Hafs|Ḥafṣ]] (d. 796) and [[Warsh]] (d. 812) which are according to two of Ibn Mujahid's reciters, [[Aasim ibn Abi al-Najud]] (Kufa, d. 745) and [[Nafi‘ al-Madani]] (Medina, d. 785), respectively. The influential standard Quran of Cairo (1924) uses an elaborate system of modified vowel-signs and a set of additional symbols for minute details and is based on ʻAsim's recitation, the 8th-century recitation of Kufa. This edition has become the standard for modern printings of the Quran.&lt;ref name=rippin/&gt;&lt;ref name=melchert2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melchert|first=Christopher|title=Ibn Mujahid and the Establishment of Seven Qur'anic Readings|journal=Studia Islamica|year=2000|issue=91|pages=5–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The variant readings of the Quran are one type of textual variant.&lt;ref name=rippin /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Small| first = Keith E.| publisher = Lexington Books| isbn = 9780739142912| title = Textual Criticism and Qur'an Manuscripts| date = 2011 |ref=harv |pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Melchert, the majority of disagreements have to do with vowels to supply, most of them in turn not conceivably reflecting dialectal differences and about one in eight disagreements has to do with whether to place dots above or below the line.&lt;ref name=Melchert&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melchert|first=Christopher|title=The Relation of the Ten Readings to One Another|journal=Journal of Quranic Studies|year=2008|volume=10|issue=2|pages=73–87|doi=10.3366/e1465359109000424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasser categorizes variant readings into various subtypes, including internal vowels, long vowels, [[gemination]] ([[shaddah]]), [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] and [[Alternation (linguistics)|alternation]].&lt;ref name=nasser&gt;{{cite book|last=Hekmat Nasser|first=Shady|title=The Transmission of the Variant Readings of the Quran: The Problem of Tawatur and the Emergence of Shawdhdh|year=2012|publisher=Brill Academic Pub|isbn=978-9004240810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, an early Quran shows compatibility with a particular reading. A Syrian manuscript from the 8th century is shown to have been written according to the reading of [[Ibn Amir ad-Dimashqi]].&lt;ref name=dutton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dutton|first=Yasin|title=An Early Mushaf According To The Reading Of Ibn ʻAmir|journal=Journal of Qur'anic Studies|year=2001|volume=3|issue=2|pages=71–89|doi=10.3366/jqs.2001.3.1.71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study suggests that this manuscript bears the vocalization of [[homs|himsi]] region.&lt;ref name=rabb&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rabb|first=Intisar|title=Non-Canonical Readings of the Qur'an: Recognition and Authenticity (The Ḥimṣī Reading)|journal=Journal of Qur'anic Studies|year=2006|volume=8|issue=2|pages=88–127|doi=10.3366/jqs.2006.8.2.84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing and printing==
===Writing===
{{main|Islamic calligraphy}}
Before printing was widely adopted in the 19th century, the Quran was transmitted in manuscripts made by [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphers]] and copyists. The earliest manuscripts were written in ''[[Hijazi script|Ḥijāzī]]''-type script. The ''Hijazi'' style manuscripts nevertheless confirm that transmission of the Quran in writing began at an early stage. Probably in the ninth century, scripts began to feature thicker strokes, which are traditionally known as ''[[Kufic]]'' scripts. Toward the end of the ninth century, new scripts began to appear in copies of the Quran and replace earlier scripts. The reason for discontinuation in the use of the earlier style was that it took too long to produce and the demand for copies was increasing. Copyists would therefore choose simpler writing styles. Beginning in the 11th century, the styles of writing employed were primarily the ''[[Naskh (script)|naskh]]'', ''[[muhaqqaq]]'', ''[[Reyhan (script)|rayḥānī]]'' and, on rarer occasions, the ''[[thuluth]]'' script. ''Naskh'' was in very widespread use. In North Africa and Spain, the ''[[Maghrebi script|Maghribī]]'' style was popular. More distinct is the ''Bihari'' script which was used solely in the north of India. ''[[Nastaʿlīq script|Nastaʻlīq]]'' style was also rarely used in Persian world.&lt;ref name=rippin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter G. Riddell, Tony Street, Anthony Hearle Johns, [https://books.google.com/books?id=H3nHpsDBm6QC&amp;pg=PA170 ''Islam: essays on scripture, thought and society : a festschrift in honour of Anthony H. Johns''], pp. 170–174, BRILL, 1997, {{ISBN|978-90-04-10692-5}}, {{ISBN|978-90-04-10692-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning, the Quran did not have vocalization markings. The system of vocalization, as we know it today, seems to have been introduced towards the end of the ninth century. Since it would have been too costly for most Muslims to purchase a manuscript, copies of the Quran were held in mosques in order to make them accessible to people. These copies frequently took the form of a series of 30 parts or ''juzʼ''. In terms of productivity, the Ottoman copyists provide the best example. This was in response to widespread demand, unpopularity of printing methods and for aesthetic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Suraiya Faroqhi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cQ8ZLZh9WjwC&amp;pg=PA95 ''Subjects of the Sultan: culture and daily life in the Ottoman Empire''], pp, 134–136, I.B.Tauris, 2005, {{ISBN|978-1-85043-760-4}}, {{ISBN|978-1-85043-760-4}};[https://books.google.com/books?id=PvwUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA803 The Encyclopaedia of Islam: Fascicules 111–112 : Masrah Mawlid], Clifford Edmund Bosworth&lt;/ref&gt;

Printed copies of the Quran during this period met with strong opposition from [[Ulama|Muslim legal scholars]]: printing anything in Arabic was prohibited in the [[Ottoman empire]] between 1483 and 1726—initially, even on penalty of death.&lt;ref&gt;Suraiya Faroqhi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cQ8ZLZh9WjwC&amp;pg=PA95 ''Subjects of the Sultan: culture and daily life in the Ottoman Empire''], pp, 134–136, I.B.Tauris, 2005, {{ISBN|1-85043-760-2}}, {{ISBN|978-1-85043-760-4}};[https://books.google.com/books?id=PvwUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA803 The Encyclopaedia of Islam: Fascicules 111–112 : Masrah Mawlid], Clifford Edmund Bosworth&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watson|1968|p=435}}; {{harvnb|Clogg|1979|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman ban on printing in Arabic script was lifted in 1726 for non-religious texts only upon the request of [[Ibrahim Muteferrika]], who printed his first book in 1729. Very few books, and no religious texts, were printed in the Ottoman Empire for another century.&lt;ref&gt;"the major Ottoman printing houses published a combined total of only 142 books in more than a century of printing between 1727 and 1838. When taken in conjunction with the fact that only a minuscule number of copies of each book were printed, this statistic demonstrates that the introduction of the printing press did not transform Ottoman cultural life until the emergence of vibrant print media in the middle of the nineteenth century" Şükrü Hanioğlu, "A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire", Princeton University Press (2010), cited after Suresh Emre, [https://sureshemre.wordpress.com/2014/01/18/on-the-late-adoption-of-the-printing-press-in-the-ottoman-empire/ On the late adoption of the printing press in the Ottoman Empire] (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1786, [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia, sponsored a printing press for "Tatar and Turkish orthography" in [[Saint Petersburg]], with one Mullah Osman Ismail responsible for producing the Arabic types. A Quran was printed with this press in 1787, reprinted in 1790 and 1793 in Saint Petersburg, and in 1803 in [[Kazan Governorate|Kazan]].&lt;ref&gt;"at imperial expense, a 'Tatar and Turkish Typography' was established in St. Petersburg; a domestic scholar, Mullah Osman Ismail, was responsible for the manufacture of the types. One of the first products of this printing house was the Qur'ān. Through the doctor and writer, Johann Georg v. Zimmermann (d. 1795), who was  befriended by Catherine II, a copy of the publication arrived in the Göttingen University library. Its director, the philologist Christian Gottlob Heyne (d. 1812), presented the work immediately in the ''Göttingische Anzeigen von gelehrten Sachen'' (28 July 1788); therein he pointed especially to the beauty of the Arabic types. To the Arabic text marginal glosses have been added that consist predominantly of reading variants. The imprint was reproduced unchanged in 1790 and 1793 in St. Petersburg (cf. Schnurrer, Bibliotheca arabica, no. 384); later, after the transfer of the printing house to Kazan, editions appeared in different formats and with varying presentation (Dorn, ''Chronologisches Verzeichnis'', 371)."

[[Gustav Leberecht Flügel|Gustav Flügel]] published an edition of the Quran in 1834 in [[Leipzig]], which remained authoritative for close to a century, until Cairo's [[Al-Azhar University]] published an edition of the Quran in 1924.

{{quote|Although Arabic, as a language and a literary tradition, was quite well developed by the time of Muhammad's prophetic activity, it was only after the emergence of Islam, with its founding scripture in Arabic, that the language reached its utmost capacity of expression, and the literature its highest point of complexity and sophistication. Indeed, it probably is no exaggeration to say that the Quran was one of the most conspicuous forces in the making of classical and post-classical Arabic literature.

The main areas in which the Quran exerted noticeable influence on Arabic literature are diction and themes; other areas are related to the literary aspects of the Quran particularly oaths (q.v.), metaphors, motifs and symbols. As far as diction is concerned, one could say that Quranic words, idioms and expressions, especially "loaded" and formulaic phrases, appear in practically all genres of literature and in such abundance that it is simply impossible to compile a full record of them. For not only did the Quran create an entirely new linguistic corpus to express its message, it also endowed old, pre-Islamic words with new meanings and it is these meanings that took root in the language and subsequently in the literature...}}

==Decision==
The plaintiff sued [[Walmart]] in state court for a state law [[negligence]] action, seeking $950,000 in damages. Pursuant to [[28 U.S.C.]] § 1441&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|28|1441}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the defendant removed to federal court on the basis of [[diversity jurisdiction]].  The plaintiff reduced the damages sought to less than $75,000 and petitioned for remand to state court because the amount in controversy requirement was no longer met.  The 6th Circuit upheld a denial of the petition for remand, holding that the amount in controversy at the time of removal was what mattered.&lt;ref&gt;Yeazell, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5211">'''''Ron Paul Family Cookbook''''' (1995-present) is a family [[cookbook]] series published by Carol Paul, wife of American politician [[Ron Paul]]. The cookbooks serve the dual purpose as both a family cookbook and a political fundraiser for Ron Paul's political campaigns. It is more of a pamphlet with earlier versions running about 16 pages and later ones around 32 pages as new recipes are added.&lt;ref name=okyle&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foodworldnews.com/articles/1821/20120607/ron-paul-libertarian-cookbook-series.htm |title=Ron Paul Has a Libertarian Cookbook Series |work=[[FoodWorldNews]] |author=Carly Okyle |date=July 7, 2012 |accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|a website|code written for the protein-folding system|Rosetta@home}}

'''Rosetta Code''' is a [[wiki]]-based programming [[chrestomathy]] website with implementations of common [[algorithms]] and solutions to various [[Computer programming|programming]] problems in many different [[programming languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Lämmel. "Software chrestomathies". {{doi|10.1016/j.scico.2013.11.014}}. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It was created in 2007 by Michael Mol.


{{As of|2018|10|26}}, Rosetta Code has:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Welcome_to_Rosetta_Code|accessdate=2018-10-26|title=Welcome to Rosetta Code}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*    913 programming tasks (or problems), 
:*    214 additional draft programming tasks, 
:*    684 computer programming languages,
:* 61,531 programming language examples/entries.

The Rosetta Code web repository illustrates how desired functionality is implemented very differently in various programming paradigms, &lt;ref&gt;Neil Walkinshaw. Chapter One: "Reverse-Engineering Software Behavior". [https://books.google.com/books?id=zvNvk-1OuBoC "Advances in Computers"]. 2013. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Cox. [https://books.google.com/books?id=wgnSUL0zh5gC "Speaking Code: Coding as Aesthetic and Political Expression"]. MIT Press, 2013. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and how "the same" task is accomplished in different programming languages.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Montfort [http://tropetank.mit.edu/TROPE-13-03.pdf "No Code: Null Programs"]. 2013. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;


==Data and structure==
The Rosetta Code site is organized as a browsable cross-section of tasks (specific programming problems or considerations) and computer programming languages. A task's page displays visitor-contributed solutions in various computer languages, allowing a viewer to compare each language's approach to the task's stated problem. 

Task pages are included in per-language listings based on the languages of provided solutions; a task with a solution in the [[C (programming language)|'''C''']] programming language will appear in the listing for '''C'''. If the same task has a solution in [[Ruby (programming language)|'''Ruby''']], the task will appear in the listing for '''Ruby''' as well.

'''Song of Ascents''' is a title given to fifteen of the [[Psalms]], 120–134 (119–133 in the [[Septuagint]] and the [[Vulgate]]), each starting with the [[Psalms#Superscriptions and attributions (of authorship)|superscription]] Shir Hama'aloth ({{lang-he|שִׁיר המַעֲלוֹת}}, meaning "Song of the Ascents"). They are also variously called '''Gradual Psalms''', '''Songs of Degrees''', '''Songs of Steps'''  or '''Pilgrim Songs'''.

Four of them (Psalms [[Psalm 122|122]], [[Psalm 124|124]], [[Psalm 131|131]], and [[Psalm 133|133]]) are linked in their ascriptions to [[David]], and one ([[Psalm 127|127]]) to [[Solomon]]. Three of them (Psalms 131, 133, and [[Psalm 134|134]]) have only three verses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.etzion.org.il/en/shiur-08-psalm-117-%E2%80%9Co-praise-lord-all-you-nations%E2%80%9D-shortest-psalm-book-tehillim|title=Shiur #08: Psalm 117 - 'O Praise The Lord, All You Nations' The Shortest Psalm in the Book of Tehillim|first=Rav Elchanan|last=Samet|year=2018|accessdate=September 16, 2018|publisher=Yeshivat Har Etzion}}&lt;/ref&gt; The longest is [[psalm 132]] (18 verses).

==History==
Many scholars believe the title indicates that these psalms were sung by worshippers as they ascended the road to [[Jerusalem]] to attend the [[three pilgrim festivals]] &lt;ref name=Zenger&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hossfeld |first1=Frank-Lothar|last2=Zenger|first2=Erich |date=2011 |title=Psalms 3: A Commentary on Psalms 101-150 |url= |location=Minneapolis |publisher=Fortress Press |pages=293–294 |isbn=978-0800607623 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|16:16|HE}}). Others think they were sung by the [[Levite]] singers as they ascended the fifteen steps to minister at the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Liebreich |first=Leon |date=1955 |title=The Songs of Ascents and the Priestly Blessing |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3261952?uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21106739913013 |journal=Journal of Biblical Literature |publisher= |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=33–34 |doi=10.2307/3261952 |access-date=7 May 2015}} {{Citation |last =Nassar | first =Seraphim | year =1938 | publication-date=1979 | title =Divine Prayers and Services of the Catholic Orthodox Church of Christ | edition=3rd | pages =1086–7 | place =Englewood NJ | publisher =[[Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; One view says the Levites first sang the Songs at the dedication of Solomon's temple during the night of the fifteenth of Tishri 959 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=D.C. |date=2015 |title=The Songs of Ascents: Psalms 120 to 134 in the Worship of Jerusalem's Temples |url=https://www.sites.google.com/site/brightmorningstar624/home/the-songs-of-ascents |location=Newton Mearns |publisher=Campbell-Bright Morning Star |page= |isbn=978-1508745358 |access-date=7 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study suggests that they were composed for a celebration after [[Nehemiah]]'s rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls in 445 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goulder |first=Michael Douglas |date=1998 |title=The Psalms of the Return (Book V. Psalms 107-150) |url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Psalms-Return-Book-107-150/dp/1850758662 |location=Edinburgh|publisher=Bloomsbury T &amp; T Clark |page= |isbn=978-1850758662  |access-date=7 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others consider that they may originally have been individual poems which were later collected together and given the title linking them to pilgrimage after the [[Babylonian captivity]].&lt;ref name=Zenger /&gt;

They were well suited for being sung by their poetic form and the sentiments they express. "They are characterized by brevity, by a key-word, by [[Glossary of rhetoric terms|epanaphora]] [''i.e.'', repetition], and by their [[epigram]]matic style.... More than half of them are cheerful, and all of them hopeful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Easton's Bible Dictionary|last=Easton|first=M. G.|url=http://eastonsbibledictionary.org/1007-Degrees_Song_of.php|date=1897|accessdate=3 February 2015|publisher=T. Nelson and Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a collection, they contain a number of repeated formulaic phrases, as well as an emphasis on Zion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crow |first=Loren D. |date=1996 |title=The Songs of Ascents (Psalms 120-134): Their Place in Israelite History and Religion |url= |location=Atlanta |publisher=Scholar's Press |pages=26–27 |isbn=978-0788502194 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
===Historical===
There are two references to the Songs of Ascents in the [[Mishnah]], noting the correspondence between the fifteen songs and the temple's fifteen steps between the Israelite's court and the women's court.&lt;ref&gt;Sukkah 5:4; Middot 2:5&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rashi]] refers to a Talmudic legend that King David composed or sang the fifteen songs to calm rising waters at the foundation of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gruber |first=Mayer I. |date=2007 |title=Rashi’s Commentary on Psalms  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nsl2NrA6v6gC&amp;dq=Rashi’s+Commentary+on+Psalms&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rXZLVdfiNYaxmAX4hYH4BQ&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Jewish Publication Society |page=698 |isbn=978-0827608726 |access-date=7 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present day===
[[Psalm 126]], eponymously called "''Shir Hamaalot''" due to its common use, is traditionally recited before the [[Birkat Hamazon|Grace After Meals]] on [[Shabbat]], [[Jewish holidays]], and other [[Seudat mitzvah|festive occasions]] in keeping with its themes of joy and redemption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=etK8tgEACAAJ&amp;q=126|title=The Complete Artscroll Siddur|first=Rabbi Nosson|last=Scherman|year=2003|publisher=[[Artscroll|Mesorah Publications, Ltd.]]|isbn=9780899066509|edition=3rd|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psalm is sung to a wide variety of tunes both liturgical and secular. The most well-known melody in the Ashkenazi Jewish world is that by Cantor Pinchas Minkowsky which was recorded by Cantor [[Yossle Rosenblatt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chazzanut.com/rosenblatt/rosenblatt-notes.html|title=Cantor Yossele Rosenblatt, Some Notes|work=Chazzanut Online|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is traditional for some Jews to place a copy of [[Psalm 121]] in the labor and delivery room to promote an easy labor by asking God for mercy. As well, it is placed on the baby's carriage and in the baby's room to protect the child and surround them in learning and with holy objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/healthy-in-body-mind-and-spirit-2/41.htm Shir HaMaalos in the Hospital from Sichos in English] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504071551/http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/healthy-in-body-mind-and-spirit-2/41.htm |date=2007-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askmoses.com/en/article/567,2064325/Why-do-people-place-the-Shir-Hamaalot-Psalm-near-a-babys-crib.html|title=Why do people place the "Shir Hamaalot" Psalm near a baby's crib? - life cycle birth the laws|website=Askmoses.com|accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian liturgy==
The [[liturgy|liturgical]] use of these psalms came into Christianity through its Jewish roots. The form of the [[Scriptures]] used in the [[Early Church]], at least so far as the [[Hebrew Bible]] was concerned, was primarily the [[Septuagint]]. In the Septuagint, these psalms are numbered 119&amp;ndash;133.

Many early [[hermit]]s observed the practice of reciting the entire [[Psalter]] daily, [[coenobitic]] communities would chant the entire Psalter through in a week, so these psalms would be said on a regular basis, during the course of the [[Canonical hours]].

===Eastern Christianity===
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and those [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which follow the [[Byzantine Rite]], the Songs of Degrees ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''anabathmoi'') make up the Eighteenth [[Kathisma]] (division of the Psalter), and are read on Friday evenings at [[Vespers]] throughout the [[liturgical year]]. The Kathisma is divided into three sections (called ''stases'') of five psalms each.

During [[Great Lent]] the Eighteenth Kathisma is read every weekday (Monday through Friday evening) at Vespers, and on Monday through Wednesday of [[Holy Week]]. In the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Slavic usage]] this Kathisma is also read from the [[Afterfeast|apodosis]] of the [[Exaltation of the Cross]] up to the [[forefeast]] of the [[Christmas|Nativity of Christ]], and from the apodosis of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Theophany]] up to the [[Sunday of the Prodigal Son]]. The reason for this is that the nights are longer in winter, especially in the northern latitudes, so during this season three Kathismata will be chanted at Matins instead of two, so in order to still have a reading from the Psalter at Vespers, the Eighteenth Kathisma is repeated.

====Anabathmoi====
At [[Matins]] on Sundays and [[feast day]]s throughout the year, special hymns called ''anabathmoi'' ({{lang-el|άναβαθμοί}}, from βαθμός, 'step'; [[Church Slavonic|Slavonic]]: ''stepénnyi'') are chanted immediately before the [[prokeimenon]] and [[Matins Gospel]]. These anabathmoi are compositions based upon the Songs of Ascents, and are written in the [[eight tones]] of [[Byzantine chant]]. The Anabathmoi for each tone consists of three ''stases'' or sets of verses (sometimes called [[antiphon]]s), except for Tone 8 which has four stases.  On Sundays, the anabathmoi are chanted according to the tone of the week; on feast days which do not fall on Sunday, the Anabathmoi almost always consist of the first stasis in Tone 4 (based on Psalm 128).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Symbolically, the anabathmoi are chanted as a reminder that Christians are ascending to the [[Heavenly Jerusalem]], and that the spiritual intensity of the service is rising as they approach the reading of the [[Gospel]].&lt;ref name="Nassar"&gt;{{Citation

===Western Christianity===
The Western [[Daily Office]] was strongly influenced by the [[Rule of St. Benedict]], where these psalms are assigned to [[Third Hour|Terce]], [[Sext]] and [[Ninth Hour|None]] on weekdays. Over the centuries, however, various schedules have been used for reciting the psalms. In the modern [[Liturgy of the Hours]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the Gradual Psalms are used in several ways:
* Psalms 120-127 and 129-131 are scheduled throughout the four-week Psalter for use at Vespers; 119, 128, and 132 are scheduled for use for [[Little Hours#Reform|Daytime Prayer]], and 133 is scheduled for Night Prayer.
* Psalms 119-127 are broken into three parts, to be used as the complementary Psalmody for those who pray three daytime offices separately as Terce, Sext, and None, rather than one office of Daytime Prayer.
* They are used as the sole Psalmody at daytime prayer on [[solemnity|solemnities]], except for certain solemnities of the Lord and during the [[Octave (liturgical)|octave]] of [[Octave of Easter|Easter]] and those solemnities falling on Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3458">A '''specialized dictionary''' is a [[dictionary]] that covers a relatively restricted set of phenomena. The definitive book on the subject (Cowie 2009) includes chapters on (among others) dictionaries of:

*[[synonym]]s
*pronunciations
*names (place names and personal names)
*phrases and [[idiom]]s
*dialect terms
*slang
*quotations
*[[Etymology|etymologies]]

Dictionaries of idioms and slang are common in most cultures. Examples include (of French) the ''Dictionnaire des expressions et locutions'', edited by [[Alain Rey]] (Paris: Le Robert 2006), and (of English) [[Eric Partridge]]'s ''Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English'' (8th edition, London: Routledge 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.partridge-slang.co.uk/ | title=''The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English''| author=Eric Partridge | accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the area of [[Second language acquisition|language learning]], there are specialized dictionaries for aspects of language which tend to be unproblematic for [[mother-tongue]] speakers but may cause difficulty for learners. These include dictionaries of [[phrasal verb]]s, such as the ''Oxford Phrasal Verbs Dictionary'' (2nd edition, Oxford University Press: 2006), and dictionaries of [[collocation]], such as ''Macmillan Collocations Dictionary'' (Oxford: Macmillan 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.macmillandictionaries.com/features/how-dictionaries-are-written/macmillan-collocations-dictionary/ | title=Macmillan Collocations Dictionary | accessdate=September 14, 2016 | author=Michael Rundell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most common types of specialized dictionary is what is often referred to in English as a technical dictionary and in German as a Fachwörterbuch. These dictionaries cover the [[terminology]] of a particular subject field or discipline. As described in Nielsen (1994), dictionaries of this type can be classified in various ways. A dictionary that covers more than one subject field is called a [[multi-field dictionary]]; one that covers one subject field is called a [[single-field dictionary]]; and one that covers a limited part of a subject field is called a [[sub-field dictionary]]. A technical dictionary that attempts to cover as much of the relevant terminology as possible is called a [[maximizing dictionary]], whereas one that attempts to cover only a limited part of the relevant terminology is called a [[minimizing dictionary]].

Specialized dictionaries can have various functions, i.e. they can help users in different types of situation. Monolingual dictionaries can help users understand and produce texts, whereas bilingual dictionaries can help users understand texts, translate texts and produce texts, as described in e.g. Nielsen (1994) and Nielsen (2010).

[[File:Yen Chenching.jpg|thumb|[[Yan Zhengqing]], compiler of the ''Yunhai jingyuan'']]
The (c. 780) '''''Yunhai jingyuan''''' 韻海鏡源 '''''Ocean of Rhymes, Mirror of Sources''''' [[Chinese dictionary]], which was compiled by the [[Tang dynasty]] official and calligrapher [[Yan Zhengqing]] (709–785), was the first phonologically-arranged [[rime dictionary]] of words rather than [[Chinese character|characters]]. Although the ''Yunhai jingyuan'' is a [[lost work]], several later dictionaries, such as the (1711) ''[[Peiwen Yunfu]]'', followed its system of collating entries by the [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] and [[syllable rime|rime]] of the last character in a term.

==Title==
The title ''Yunhai jingyuan'' [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] four words (translation equivalents from [[Wenlin]] 2015):
*''yùn'' 韻 "rime; rime-class; tone; agreeable sound; charm; appeal; final; syllable final"
*''hǎi'' 海 "sea; ocean; big lake; huge group (of people/things); great capacity"
*''jìng'' 鏡 "mirror; lens; glass"
*''yuán'' 源 "source (of a river); fountainhead; source; cause; origin"

English translations include:
*''Mirror-origin of the Sea of Rhymes'' (Gimello and Gregory 1983: 191)
*''Mirror of the Ocean of Rhymes'' (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 219)
*''Mirror-source of the Ocean of Rhymes'' (McRae 1993: 71)
*''Mirror &amp; Origin of the Ocean of Rhymes'' (Zhou and Zhang 2003: 72).
*''The Sources of Rhyme Ocean'' (Yong and Peng 2008: 172)

==Text==
The ''Yunhai jingyuan'' included 26,911 character [[headword|head entries]] and comprised 360 volumes (''juǎn'' 卷 "roll; volume"; Zhou and Zhang 2003: 72). By any standards, it was a very large dictionary, and "by the standards of the time it must have been simply gigantic" (Needham and Harbsmeier 1998: 78). For more than two centuries, the ''Yunhai jingyuan'' remained the most inclusive Chinese dictionary, until the (1039) ''[[Jiyun]]'' with 53,525 character entries.

Compared with two contemporary 100-volume dictionaries, the ''Guiyuan zhucong'' 桂苑珠叢 by Zhuge Ying 諸葛潁 (539-615) and the 100-volume ''Zihai'' 字海 compiled under the direction of Empress [[Wu Zetian]] (r. 690-705), the ''Yunhai jingyuan'' was an "even more miraculous lexicographical work" (Yong and Peng 2008: 178).

Chinese dictionaries are traditionally dichotomized between ''zìdiǎn'' [[wikt:字典|字典]] "character dictionaries" and ''cídiǎn'' [[wikt:辭典|辭典]] "word dictionaries". In the history of Chinese [[lexicography]], the ''Yunhai jingyuan'' was the earliest hybrid of a word dictionary and a rime dictionary (Yong and Peng 2008: 226). Earlier rime dictionaries that only included characters include (c. 230) ''[[Shenglei]]'' and the (601) ''[[Qieyun]]'', which was revised as the (720) ''Tangyun'' 唐韻.

In 773, during the reign of [[Emperor Daizong of Tang]] (r. 762-779). Yan Zhengqing assembled a group of over 50 scholars with diverse backgrounds to compile the ''Yunhai jingyuan'' at his residence in Huzhou. They included several of his literary friends, the Daoist poet [[Zhang Zhihe]], the Chan Buddhist monk Jiaoran 皎然, and [[Lu Yu]], author of ''[[The Classic of Tea]]'' (Benn 2015: 108). In the same year, the ''Yunhailou'' 韻海樓 "Ocean of Rhymes Building" was constructed as the depository for its namesake ''Yunhai jingyuan''. The building was restored in 1666, and is presently a municipal library and cultural center in [[Huzhou]], [[Zhejiang]] prefecture.

Yan Zhengqing's reference work included not only single-syllable words but also multi-character [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]], and even some ''[[chengyu]]'' "[[set phrase]]s". This type of specialized dictionary was intended for the composition of poems, retrieving literary quotations, and finding appropriate words for antithetical couplets (Yong and Peng 2008: 330).

The word or phrase entries in the ''Yunhai jingyuan'' were [[phonologically]] arranged by the 106 rime groups of the ''[[Rime dictionary#Pingshui rhyme categories|Píngshuǐ]]'' (lit. 平水 "level water") system, which is based on the traditional [[Four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tones]]: ''ping'' "level", ''shang'' "rising", ''qu'' "departing", and ''ru'' "entering". Note that the term ''rime'' is used, as opposed to common [[rhyme]], in the linguistic sense of [[Syllable#Rime|syllable rime]] or Chinese [[rime table]]. A dictionary user looks up a word by the tone and rime of the final character, which presumes that the user already knows, or can guess, how to pronounce the character. For speakers of [[alphabetic language]]s who are familiar with easy dictionary lookup, using a Chinese dictionary based on the ''Yunhai jingyuan'' system is very [[usability|user-unfriendly]].

Three later dictionaries of literary allusions followed the 106-rime arrangement of the ''Yunhai jingyuan''. First were the [[Yuan dynasty]] (c. 1280) ''Yunfu qunyu'' 韻府群玉 "Assembly of Jade Tablets, a Word-Store arranged by Rhymes" compiled by Yin Shifu 陰時夫 and the [[Ming dynasty]] (1592) ''Wuche yunrui'' 五車韻瑞 "Five Cartloads of Rhyme-inscribed Jade Tablets" by Ling Zhilong 淩稚隆. Ultimately the [[Qing dynasty]] (1711) ''[[Peiwen yunfu]]'' "Word-store arranged by Rhymes, from the Hall of the Admiration of Literature" expanded entries and corrected errors in previous rime dictionaries, resulting in 212 volumes with 10,257 head entries arranged by the 106 ''Pingshui'' rime categories (tr. Needham et al. 1986: 219; Yong and Peng 2008: 330).

The (1728) Pianzi leipian 駢字類編 "Classified Collection of Phrases and Literary Allusions" dictionary was the first dictionary to abandon the traditional ''Yunhai jingyuan'' system of indexing words by their last character's rime and tone, and it indexed words by their first character (Needham et al. 1986: 219). Most subsequent Chinese word dictionaries were internally arranged by the graphic [[radical (Chinese character)|radical]] of the first character in a word.
