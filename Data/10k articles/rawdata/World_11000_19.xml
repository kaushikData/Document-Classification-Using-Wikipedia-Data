[[Image:Full Ornamented Royal Coat of Arms of Spain (1761-1868 and 1874-1931).svg|thumb|right|250px|Ornamented version of the royal [[coat of arms]] of the [[Kings of Spain]] from [[Charles III of Spain|Carlos III]] to [[Alfonso XIII]], where the motto can be seen.]]
'''''A solis ortu usque ad occasum''''' is a [[heraldic motto]] roughly meaning ''"From sunrise to sunset"'' in [[Latin]]. Inspired by the [[Bible|Biblical]] passage of {{bibleref2|Psalm|113:3|KJV}},{{refn|The phrase can also be quoted ''[[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]]'' in {{bibleref2|Psalm|112:3|VULGATE}} of the [[Latin Vulgate]].}} it can be interpreted as the sentiment of the monarch's dominion over lands across the world, similar to how the British and Spanish Empires are/were called the "empire[s] on which the sun never sets". 

Most often cited in the [[coat of arms]] of many former [[Kings of Spain]] above the [[crest (heraldry)|crest]], it is distinctive in its placement above the crest similar to the [[Scottish heraldry|Scottish style]] in [[slogan (heraldry)|slogans]] versus placement below the [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] or [[order (honour)|order]] if present. With this element it was wanted to manifest that the sun was not put in the dominions of the [[Spanish Empire]], since these were located in both hemispheres. This motto echoed a famous phrase, "''en mis dominios no se pone el sol''" (in my dominions the sun does not set), attributed to [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II]].

The ornamented version of the royal arms with the [[Heraldry of Castile#Crest and supporters|Castilian Royal Crest]] fell into disuse in the 19th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1082">The '''Andrew Cross Awards''' were one of the [[UK]]'s [[award]]s for religious journalism.  They were awarded annually by the Churches' Media Council, an association which brought together churches, [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]], broadcasting authorities (both commercial and public service agencies) and media educators in celebrating and encouraging the best in journalistic reporting and analysis of religious news and current affairs in radio, television, in print media and online.  

The Awards are named in honour of Bishop Agnellus Andrew (1908–1987) and Bishop Stewart Cross, former presidents of the Churches' Advisory Council on Local Broadcasting, the predecessor body of the Churches' Media Council.

Andrew Cross Awards have not been given since 2006, and in 2009 the Churches Media Council changed its name and its focus, becoming the Church and Media Network. There are currently no plans to revive the Andrew Cross Awards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7650">The '''AF Association''' (AF-A) is an international [[charitable organization|charity]] that provides information and support for patients suspected of having, or diagnosed with [[atrial fibrillation]] (AF); the most common heart rhythm disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=the Charity Commission|url=http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/find-charities/|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AF Association also works to campaign for greater awareness of AF amongst the general public and increase education for [[Healthcare professional#Practitioners and professionals|healthcare professionals]] and service providers involved in the management of AF.

== History ==
In 2007, the AF-A was founded by Mrs Trudie Lobban MBE, Professor A John Camm, Professor Richard Schilling and Consultant Arrhythmia Nurse Mrs Jayne Mudd. The charity was formed after requests from [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]] patients seeking reliable information and support about this heart rhythm disorder. There are currently over 20,000 members and 30 affiliated groups established worldwide.

The charity partners with Arrhythmia Alliance (A-A) to facilitate educational meetings and symposia for healthcare professionals, including sessions at the annual Heart Rhythm Congress&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heart Rhythm Congress Patient Day|url=http://www.heartrhythmcongress.com/scientific-programme/patientsday.html|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and regional Cardiac Update Meetings held across the UK.

== Aims and objectives ==
# The AF Association’s primary objective is to provide reliable information to individuals affected by AF. All publications are medically approved and those developed for the UK are endorsed by the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AF-A publications|url=http://www.atrialfibrillation.org.uk/publications/booklets.html|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The AF Association provides support though email and a telephone support line, the latter being available 24/7. The patient focused website provides downloadable factsheets and information booklets as well as free access to current world-wide AF news, fellow patient case stories and links to online interactive and moderated forums.
# The AF Association works to raise awareness of AF amongst the general public and lobby for screening for AF through the ‘[http://www.heartrhythmcharity.org.uk/www/259/0/Know_Your_Pulse/ Know Your Pulse]’ campaign.
# The AF Association seeks to make AF a health priority, which is supported by the All Party Parliamentary Group on AF&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Registry of APGAF|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmallparty/register/atrial-fibrillation.htm|publisher=House of Commons|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (APGAF), chaired by [[Glyn Davies (politician)|Glyn Davies MP]].

== Campaigns and activities ==
Know Your Pulse - Since 2009 the AF Association has been campaigning for manual pulse checks to be included in all routine medical checkups carried out by the NHS in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pulse checks 'could prevent 12,000 strokes'|url=http://www.nhs.uk/news/2011/12December/Pages/Pulse-checks-could-prevent-strokes.aspx|accessdate=2 June 2013|author=NHS Choices}}&lt;/ref&gt; A manual pulse check is one of the easiest ways to detect a cardiac arrhythmia, which otherwise often goes untreated until a stroke or other serious illness occurs.

'''ACT on AF:'''

Ask – are you at risk of AF?;

Check – your pulse regularly;

Talk – to your doctor if you have any concern.

This includes the annual ACT on AF Friday.

'''Heart Rhythm Week''' - in collaboration with Arrhythmia Alliance. Held annually during the first week of June this event involves extensive activities with individuals, groups, medical centres and celebrities focused on raising awareness and greater understanding of AF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corby Know Your Pulse |url=http://www.corby.gov.uk/press-release/taking-pulse-our-community-%E2%80%93-new-heart-health-initiative-people-corby |accessdate=4 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511101847/http://www.corby.gov.uk/press-release/taking-pulse-our-community-%E2%80%93-new-heart-health-initiative-people-corby |archivedate=11 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sign Against Stroke''' - Patient organisations from twenty countries produced the Global Atrial Fibrillation Charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global AF Charter|url=http://www.signagainststroke.com/en/charter.html|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Launched at the World Heart Federation, World Congress of Cardiology Scientific Sessions in Dubai on 18 April 2012. The aim of the charter is to turn the world's attention to atrial fibrillation and AF-related stroke.

'''Stop Start Campaign''' - supported by the AF Association this initiative seeks to educate healthcare practitioners on the benefits of anticoagulation in AF management, and the inappropriateness of antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of AF-related strokes.

=== Meetings ===
AF Patient Days - held during the annual Heart Rhythm Congress, Birmingham UK, Europe AF, London UK and at a number of US centres. The AF Association hosts a day of seminars and discussion for those affected by AF.

Regional Cardiac Update meetings - in association with Arrhythmia Alliance these are designed for healthcare professionals involved in the management of arrhythmias.

AF Symposium at the Heart Rhythm Congress - held annually in Birmingham, UK.

== Reports ==

Finger on The Pulse (2009 England, 2010 Wales) - evidences the burden of AF for patients and the healthcare services.

== Parliamentary activity ==
In 2011 an All-Party Parliamentary Group on atrial fibrillation (APGAF) was established in partnership with the AF Association. It is chaired by [[Glyn Davies (politician)|Glyn Davies MP]], who is himself affected by AF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atrial fibrillation{{snd}}pulse checks on the NHS|url=http://glyn-davies.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/atrial-fibrilation-pulse-checks-in-nhs.html|publisher=Glyn Davies MP|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The APGAF has published a number of reports on improving AF care in the NHS.

The '''Bernard Free Library''' was established on 21 February 1883 when the Commissioner of Lower Myanmar ([[Lower Burma]]), Sir [[Charles Edward Bernard]] opened a library, with his collection of books, in the centre of [[Yangon|Rangoon]] (presently No 1 State High School, Latha Township). This library was the first free public library in Myanmar.

During the [[Second World War]], the Library was damaged but many books and almost all manuscripts were saved. In 1952, the Library was transferred to the Myanmar Government. It moved to the Jubilee Hall on the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] Road and was reopened as the “[[National Library of Myanmar]]” under the Ministry of Culture. The library is the legal depository of Myanmar, under the Printers and Publishers Registration Act 1962.

'''Bheki''' is the name given to a [[frog]] that symbolises the [[sun]] on the horizon in [[Sanskrit]] legend. Related myths can be found in [[Germanic mythology|Germanic]] and [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] culture.

In the legend, Bheki was originally a beautiful woman.  A king asked her to be his wife, so she married him, but only on condition that he should never show her a drop of water. One day she grew tired, and asked for water. The king gave it to her, and she sank out of his sight, just as the sun sinks when it touches the water.

'''Camolin''', according to a 2004 report in the German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], is a secret [[counter-terrorism]] unit based in [[Paris]], [[France]].  The article states that the USA, UK, Australia, Germany, and France - amongst others - created this unit after the [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]] on the US.  Started as [[Alliance Base]] in 2002, the unit is now codenamed Camolin.

Their greatest success to date seems to have been the arrest in France on 3 June 2003, of the German [[Muslim]] convert [[Christian Ganczarski]] who was considered at the time to be the head of [[Al Qaeda]] in Europe.

'''Cha kla''' ({{lang-th|จะกละ}}) or '''Phi Cha kla''' (ผีจะกละ) is a [[Thai ghost]] appearing like a [[cat]] or [[felinae|wild cat]]. Cha kla were believed to be used by  [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerers]] for attacking their enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.sanook.com/search/dict-th-th-royal-institute/%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B0|title=จะกละ|work=[[Royal Institute Dictionary]]|accessdate=2017-07-15}} {{th icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Folk tale ==
Cha kla is a kind of [[#The Ka Ghost#Ghosts in Thai culture|Phi Ka]] (ผีกะ). In the [[Southern Thai language]],''"Phi Luang"'', (ผีล้วง) it means a cat with completely black (but not shiny) fur. The cat's fur runs from back to front and it has blood-red eyes. The cat is a [[nocturnal animal]] and is fearful of humans - when it sees a human it runs down its hole. It will dig into the hole and will only emerge at night.  When someone sees or touches it, that person will eventually die.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ghostwiki.blogspot.com/2012/01/blog-post_2847.html ผีจะกละ] {{th icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Château Vial''' is a [[chateau]] in the hills to the north of [[Kpalimé]], in the [[Kloto Prefecture]] of [[Togo]].

It was built by the French in the early 1940s and consists of a main building and a tower. The building is owned by the Togolese government and is used for cabinet meetings. In the past presidents such as [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]] and [[Abdou Diouf]] have stayed at the chateau.

The '''[[coat of arms]] of [[Ålesund]]''' was approved by Royal Resolution on April 1, 1898. It was created by the artist Andreas Bloch (1860–1917). The motif, a fishing boat described in 1762 on [[Sunnmøre]], alludes to the city's history and commerce.

'''Diniktum''', inscribed ''Di-ni-ik-tum''&lt;sup&gt;KI&lt;/sup&gt;, was a middle bronze-age town located somewhere in the lower Diyala region of [[Mesopotamia]], on the [[Tigris]] river downstream from [[Opis|Upi]] and close to the northern border of [[Elam]]. It is possibly at or in the vicinity of Tell Muḥammad, which lies in south-eastern part of modern [[Baghdad]]. 
&lt;ref&gt;Paolo Gentili, Where is Diniktum? : Remarks on the Situation and a Supposition,
Rivista degli studi orientali, Nuova Serie, Vol. 79, Fasc. 1/4, pp. 231-238, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
It is mentioned in the Harmal geographical list.&lt;ref&gt;Tablet IM 51143.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

It enjoyed independence briefly during the 18th century under the reigns of the Amorite chieftains (''ra-bí-an'' MAR.DÚ) Itur-šarrum, attested on a single seal from [[Eshnunna|Ešnunna]], and Sîn-gāmil, son of Sîn-šēmi and a contemporary of [[Zimrilim|Zimri-Lim]] (ca. 1710–1698 BC [[Short chronology timeline|short]]) of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] and [[Hammurabi|Ḫammu-rapī]] (ca. 1728–1686 BC short) of [[Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Old Babylonian period (2003-1595 BC): Early Periods, Volume 4 (RIM The Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia) | author = Douglas Frayne | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 1990 | pages = 682–685 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an old Babylonian letter from [[Yarim-Lim I]], the king of [[Yamhad|Iamḫad]] whose capital was Halab, ancient [[Aleppo]], to the Yašub-Yahad, the king of [[Der (Sumer)|Dēr]], he says:

{{ quote|.. Certainly. Sîn-gāmil, king of Diniktum. very much like you would repeatedly respond to me by means of lies and provocations. Having docked 500 boats in Diniktum's quay. I "sank" (supported?) his land as well as him for 12 year!"&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Editions Recherche sur Ies Civilisations | chapter = Yarim-Lim's War Declaration | author = J. Sasson | location = Paris | year = 1985 | page = 244 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|Iarīm-Līm|Tablet A. 1314, Letter to Yašub-Yahad }}

Ikūn-pî-Sîn (“The word of Sin is truthful”), the ruler of Nērebtum and possibly [[Tutub]], cities in the sphere of Ešnunna, has a year name: “Year when Ikū(n)-pî-Sîn captured Diniktum." It was absorbed into the kingdom of Ešnunna and consequently embroiled in its conflicts with Elam during the reigns of Ibāl-pî-El II (ca. 1715–1701 BC short) and Ṣillī-Sîn (ca. 1700–1698 BC short).&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = The Routledge Handbook of The People and Places of Ancient Western Asia | author = Trevor Bryce | publisher = Routledge | year = 2009 | page = 196 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The town was still settled in the later bronze-age, as a year name gives ““the year [in which] [[Kadashman-harbe I|Kadašman-Ḫarbe]], the king, dug the canal of Diniktum.”&lt;ref&gt;Tablet Ni. 3199.&lt;/ref&gt; Kadašman-Ḫarbe was a [[Kassites|Kassite]] king of Babylon of the late 15th century.

'''Drama''' was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Pop music|pop]] band from [[Larvik]] founded in 1981. They were dubbed Norway's first [[boy band]].&lt;ref name="Bakkemoen2006"&gt;Bakkemoen, Kurt (May 31, 2006). [http://www.vg.no/musikk/artikkel.php?artid=304589 De var Norges første boyband.] ''[[Verdens Gang]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The band split in 1984 and reunited in 1987 but disbanded again in 1989. They released a total of four studio albums.

The band initially consisted of five members: Per Kristian "Muffe" Indrehus ([[singing|vocals]] and [[guitar]]), Geir Olav "Gækki" Bøkestad (guitar, vocals and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]), Per Arne "Perry" Strandbakken (keyboards), Tomas Siqveland ([[bass guitar | bass]], vocals) and Gunnar "Stikka" Refsdal ([[drums]]). All members were 15 years old when the debut album came out, except Indrehus who was 17. In 1983 the band added Ole Jan "Ollie" Rimstad on guitar, vocals and keyboards.

The band released two albums, ''Breaking Away'' in 1982 and ''High Time'' in 1983, before Indrehus and Bøkestad left to start as a duo. The two would continue to use the Drama name, which resulted in a lawsuit against the rest of the band. After losing they renamed the duo Creation, while the four remaining members continued under the name of New Drama. Creation released four albums and New Drama two albums before they were reunited again under the name of Drama in 1987 and released another two albums. The band was finally dissolved in 1989.

Drama and Creation and released a double album on 29 May 2006. This album contains 42 tracks, including one new song, "Hello." The group was profiled on the second season of ''[[Gylne tider]]''.&lt;ref name="gylnetider2009"&gt;Staff report (20 June 2009).

'''Eki''' (also '''Ekhi''', '''Eguzki''', '''Iuski''', '''Iguzki''', '''Iduzki''' or '''Eguzku''') are the names of the [[Sun]] in the [[Basque language]]. In [[Basque mythology]], Eki or Eguzki is seen as daughter of [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]] to whom she returns daily.

She was regarded as the protector of humanity and the enemy of all evil spirits. The ancient Basques called her "grandmother"; and held rites in her honour at sunset. They believed that when the sun set, '''Ekhi''' travelled into Itxasgorrieta ("The Reddish Seas") beneath the earth into the womb of [[Amalur]] aka. [[Lurbira]], her mother.

The '''history of rail transport in Slovakia''' began in November 1836, at the founding meeting of the participating companies for the construction of a horse railway from [[Bratislava]] to [[Trnava]] (later extended to [[Sereď]]).  The first section of that railway was launched on 27 September 1840.

The first locomotive powered railway in Slovakia was the [[Bratislava]]–[[Marchegg]]–[[Gänserndorf]] (–[[Vienna]]) line, commissioned on 20 August 1848. By 1872, upon the completion of the [[Košice–Bohumín Railway]], railways linked one end of Slovakia with the other.

The '''Hungarian 44M''' ""Buzogányvető"" was an unguided anti-tank [[rocket]] designed by [[Hungary]] for use against [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] armour and personnel in [[World War II]]. The rocket system consisted of a pair of solid fuel rockets with two types of [[warhead]]s available. It was regarded as one of the most effective anti-tank platforms used in WWII. Production started in spring of 1944 and ended 20 December 1944 when Soviet troops captured the WM Factory.&lt;ref name = "Karika"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ftr.wot-news.com/2014/04/02/hungarian-toldi-ii-lt-with-44m-buzoganyveto-anti-tank-rocket-launcher/|title=Hungarian Toldi II LT with 44M.|author=Károlyi “Karika” Németh|date=2 April 2014|work=ftr.wot-news.com|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and operation==
In 1942 the Hungarian Institute of Military Science (HTI) began work to develop an easy to produce weapon capable of counteracting heavy Soviet tanks and armour. Germany had started work on a [[wire-guided missile]] but was unwilling to share the technology with Hungary.&lt;ref name = "Karika"/&gt;

The 44M consisted of a [[Rocket launcher|launcher]] capable of holding two rockets with the gunner operating from weapon's left side. A tripod was developed for use by the three man crew on the ground, but this mount was difficult to maneuver and rocket crews often used captured Soviet wheel mounts from the [[PM M1910]] or [[SG-43 Goryunov]] [[machine guns]]. The system was also mounted in the bed of the [[38M Botond]] all-terrain truck and on the rear of the [[38M Toldi|38M Toldi II]] light tank.&lt;ref name="Karika"/&gt;

The first of two types of rockets produced was a [[High-explosive anti-tank warhead]] ('''HEAT''') round known as ’Buzogány’ (mace). With 4.2&amp;nbsp;kg of explosive, this [[shaped charge]] was capable of penetrating 300&amp;nbsp;mm of armour or concrete and destroy any type of heavy tank from a maximum distance of 1200 m. A [[Explosive material#High explosives|high explosive]] ('''HE''') projectile  round was also available for use in an anti-personnel role referred to as ’Zápor’ (rainfall, shower). Both types were [[Spin-stabilisation|spin-stabilized]].&lt;ref name="survincity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://survincity.com/2010/05/hungarian-anti-tank-rocket-launcher-mace/|title=Hungarian anti-tank rocket launcher, Mace|work=survincity.com|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 600-700 twin rocket launchers produced, the majority were used for the defense of [[Budapest]] in late December 1944, referred to as the [[Siege of Budapest]].&lt;ref name="survincity"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2637">'''Hørsholm Arboretum''' ({{lang-da|Arboretet i Hørsholm}}) is an [[arboretum]] located in [[Hørsholm]], 20&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. It operates as part of the [[University of Copenhagen]]'s Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arboretum in Hørsholm|url=http://ign.ku.dk/arboretum-hoersholm/|website=Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management|publisher=University of Copenhagen Faculty of Science|accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arboretum==
Hørsholm Arboretum was established by the [[Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University]] in 1936 as an off-site expansion of the [[Forstbotanisk Have|Forestry Botanical Garden]] in [[Charlottenlund]]. With its approximately 2&amp;nbsp;000 species of trees and shrubs, Hørsholm Arboretum is the largest arboretum in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ign.ku.dk/arboretum-hoersholm/about-aboretum/|title=About the Arboretum in Hørsholm|website=Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management|publisher=University of Copenhagen Faculty of Science|accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings==
The Forest &amp; Landscape research center was built in 1994&amp;ndash;95 to design by royal building inspector Gehrdt Bornebusch. It has been designed to maximize the views of the arboretum and Ubberød Pond. The use of wood, both elm and pine, plays a prominent role in the architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arkark.dk/building.aspx?buildingid=2782|title=Hørsholm Forskningscenter for Skov og Landskab|language=Danish|website=arkark.dk|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was left empty when the activities moved to Copenhagen in 2008 and the national property company Freja Ejendomme took over the buildings in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hoersholm.lokalavisen.dk/der-skal-stadig-forskes-i-tom-bygning-/20140417/artikler/704179930/1039|title=Der skal stadig forskes i tom bygning|language=Danish|website=ugebladet.dkUniversitet|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public access==
Hørsholm Arboretum is open to the public daily from 6.39 until sunset. It is particularly popular with visitors in May when the extensive collection of wild rhododendron species blossom. The arboretum arranges tours and other events with support from  G.B. Hartmanns Forskningsfond.

Present-day Laos traces its historic and cultural identity to the kingdom of [[Lan Xang|Lan Xang Hom Khao]] (Kingdom of a Million Elephants Under the White Parasol), which existed for four centuries as one of the largest kingdoms in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name="Stuart-Fox"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Lao Kingdom of Lan Xang: Rise and Decline|last=Stuart-Fox|first=Martin|publisher=White Lotus Press|year=1998|isbn=974-8434-33-8|location=|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Lan Xang's central geographical location in Southeast Asia, the kingdom became a popular hub for overland trade, becoming wealthy economically as well as culturally.&lt;ref name="Stuart-Fox" /&gt; After a period of internal conflict, Lan Xang broke off into three separate kingdoms—[[Kingdom of Luang Phrabang|Luang Phrabang]], [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]] and [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]]. In 1893, it became a [[French colonial empire|French protectorate]], with the three territories uniting to form what is now known as the country of Laos. It briefly gained freedom in 1945 after [[History of Laos to 1945#Japanese occupation of Laos|Japanese occupation]], but was recolonised by France until it won autonomy in 1949. Laos became independent in 1953, with a [[constitutional monarchy]] under [[Sisavang Vong]]. Shortly after independence, a long [[Laos Civil War|civil war]] ended the monarchy, when the [[Communism|Communist]] [[Pathet Lao]] movement came to power in 1975. During the first years of Communist rule, Laos was dependent on military and economic aid supported by the [[Soviet Union]] until its [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution]] in 1991.

According to the non-governmental anti-corruption organisation [[Transparency International]], Laos remains one of the most corrupt countries in the world. This has deterred foreign investment and created major problems with the rule of law, including the nation's ability to enforce contract and business regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Transparency International "Laos Corruption Perceptions Index" (2005–2014) http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Laos/transparency_corruption/&lt;/ref&gt;  This has contributed to a third of the population of Laos currently living below the [[international poverty line]] (living on less than [[United States dollar|US$]]1.25 per day).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Laos: Human Development Indicators |url=http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/LAO.html |accessdate=19 July 2013 |website=undp.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603073047/http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/LAO.html |archivedate=3 June 2013 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Laos has a low-income economy, with one of the lowest annual incomes in the world.

Laos is a member of the [[Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement]] (APTA), [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), [[East Asia Summit]] and [[La Francophonie]]. Laos applied for membership of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in 1997; on 2 February 2013, it was granted full membership.&lt;ref name="wto"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/countries_e/lao_e.htm | title=Lao People's Democratic Republic and the WTO | publisher=World Trade Organization | accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[One-party state|one-party]] [[socialist republic]] espousing [[Marxism–Leninism]]  governed by the [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party]], in which the party leadership is dominated by military figures.&lt;ref&gt;The First Conference on Human Rights in Laos.

The capital and largest city is [[Vientiane]]. Other major cities include [[Luang Prabang]], [[Savannakhet]] and [[Pakse]]. The official language is [[Lao language|Lao]]. Laos is a multi-ethnic country, with the politically and culturally dominant [[Lao people]] making up about 55 percent of the population, mostly in the lowlands. [[Mon-Khmer languages|Mon-Khmer]] groups, the [[Hmong people|Hmong]] and other indigenous hill tribes, accounting for 45 percent of the population, live in the foothills and mountains. Laos's ambitious strategies for development are based on generating electricity from its rivers and selling the power to its neighbours, namely [[Thailand]], [[China]] and [[Vietnam]], as well as its initiative to become a "land-linked" nation, shown by the [[Transport in Laos#Railways|planning of four new railways connecting Laos to its neighbours]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |title=Laos approves Xayaburi 'mega' dam on Mekong |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20203072 |newspaper=BBC News |date=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laos has been referred to as one of East Asia and Pacific's [[Fastest Growing Economies]] by the [[World Bank]], with annual GDP growth averaging 7.8% for the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/lao/overview|title=Lao PDR [Overview]|publisher=World Bank|date=March 2018|accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2d309312-1cb3-11e0-a106-00144feab49a.html#axzz1BP9Somjj |title = Laos Securities Exchange to start trading |publisher = Ft.com |date = 10 January 2011 |accessdate = 23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
The English word ''Laos'' was coined by the [[French colonial empire|French]], who united the three Lao kingdoms in [[French Indochina]] in 1893 and named the country as the plural of the dominant and most common ethnic group, which are the [[Lao people]].

In the [[Lao language]], the country's name is "[[Mueang#Laos|Muang Lao]]" ({{lang|lo|ເມືອງລາວ}}) or "Pathet Lao" ({{lang|lo|ປະເທດລາວ}}), both literally mean "Lao Country".&lt;ref name="Kislenko2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kislenko |first=Arne |title=Culture and customs of Laos |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D6CuONua48MC&amp;pg=PR20 |year=2009 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn = 978-0-313-33977-6 |page = 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fa Ngum-Vtne1.JPG|thumb|left|A statue of [[Fa Ngum]], founder of the [[Lan Xang]] kingdom]]

Laos traces its history to the kingdom of Lan Xang (Million Elephants), which was founded in the 14th century by a Lao prince [[Fa Ngum]],&lt;ref name="Coedes"&gt;{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|authorlink= George Coedès|editor= Walter F.

Ngum was descended from a long line of Lao kings that traced back to Khoun Boulom. He made [[Theravada Buddhism]] the state religion and Lan Xang prospered. Within 20 years of its formation, the kingdom expanded eastward to Champa and along the Annamite mountains in Vietnam. His ministers, unable to tolerate his ruthlessness, forced him into exile to the present-day Thai province of [[Nan Province|Nan]] in 1373,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.history.com/topics/fa-ngum |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100308201136/http://www.history.com/topics/fa-ngum |archivedate = 8 March 2010 |title = Fa Ngum |publisher=History.com |accessdate = 23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he died. Fa Ngum's eldest son, Oun Heuan, ascended to the throne under the name [[Samsenthai]] and reigned for 43&amp;nbsp;years. Lan Xang became an important trade centre during Samsenthai's reign, but after his death in 1421 it collapsed into warring factions for 100 years.

In 1520, [[Photisarath]] came to the throne and moved the capital from [[Luang Prabang]] to Vientiane to avoid a [[Burma|Burmese]] invasion. [[Setthathirat]] became king in 1548, after his father was killed, and ordered the construction of what became the symbol of Laos, [[That Luang]]. Setthathirat disappeared in the mountains on his way back from a military expedition into Cambodia and Lan Xang began to rapidly decline.

It was not until 1637, when [[Sourigna Vongsa]] ascended the throne, that Lan Xang further expanded its frontiers. His reign is often regarded as Laos's golden age. When he died without an heir, the kingdom split into three principalities. Between 1763 and 1769, Burmese armies overran northern Laos and annexed [[Luang Phrabang]], while [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]] eventually came under [[Thailand|Siamese]] [[suzerainty]].

[[Anouvong|Chao Anouvong]] was installed as a vassal king of Vientiane by the Siamese. He encouraged a renaissance of Lao fine arts and literature and improved relations with Luang Phrabang. Under Vietnamese pressure, [[Lao rebellion (1826–28)|he rebelled against the Siamese in 1826]]. The rebellion failed and Vientiane was ransacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asianewsnet.net/home/news.php?sec=3&amp;id=15718 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126004328/http://www.asianewsnet.net/home/news.php?id=15718&amp;sec=3 |dead-url=yes |archivedate=26 November 2010 |title=Let's hope Laos hangs on to its identity |publisher=Asianewsnet.net |accessdate=23 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anouvong was taken to [[Bangkok]] as a prisoner, where he died.

A Siamese military campaign in Laos in 1876 was described by a British observer as having been "transformed into [[History of slavery in Asia|slave-hunting raids]] on a large scale".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101012011239/http://kyotoreviewsea.org/slavery3.htm "Slavery in Nineteenth-Century Northern Thailand: Archival Anecdotes and Village Voices"].

The King then secretly sent Prince [[Kindavong]] to represent Laos to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] and [[Sisavang Vatthana|Prince Sisavang]] as representative to the Japanese.&lt;ref name="A Country Study: Laos"/&gt; When Japan surrendered, some Lao nationalists (including Prince [[Phetsarath]]) declared Laotian independence, but by early 1946, French troops had reoccupied the country and conferred limited autonomy on Laos.

During the [[Indochina War|First Indochina War]], the [[Indochinese Communist Party]] formed the [[Pathet Lao]] resistance organisation. The Pathet Lao began a war against the aggressive French Colonial forces with the aid of the [[Vietnam]]ese independence organisation (the [[Viet Minh]]). In 1950 the French were forced to give Laos semi-autonomy as an "associated state" within the [[French Union]]. France remained in de facto control until 22 October 1953, when Laos gained full independence as a [[constitutional monarchy]].

[[File:FrenchLaos1953.png|thumb|left|French [[Raoul Salan|General Salan]] and [[Sisavang Vatthana|Prince Sisavang Vatthana]] in Luang Prabang, 4 May 1953]]
The [[First Indochina War]] took place across French Indochina and eventually led to French defeat and the signing of a peace accord for Laos at the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference of 1954]]. In 1955, the [[US Department of Defense]] created a special [[Programs Evaluation Office]] to replace French support of the [[Royal Lao Army]] against the [[communist]] [[Pathet Lao]] as part of the US [[containment]] policy.

In 1960, amidst a series of rebellions in the [[Kingdom of Laos]], fighting broke out between the Royal Lao Army and the communist [[North Vietnam]]-backed, and [[Soviet Union]]-backed Pathet Lao guerillas. A second Provisional Government of National Unity formed by Prince [[Souvanna Phouma]] in 1962 was unsuccessful, and the situation steadily deteriorated into large scale [[Laotian Civil War|civil war]] between the Royal Laotian government and the Pathet Lao. The Pathet Lao were backed militarily by the [[North Vietnamese Army|NVA]] and [[Vietcong]].

[[File:Muang Khoun - Laos - 01.JPG|thumb|right|Ruins of [[Muang Khoun]], former capital of [[Xiangkhouang Province|Xiangkhouang province]], destroyed by the [[Operation Barrel Roll|American bombing of Laos]] in the late 1960s]]
Laos was a key part of the [[Vietnam War]] since parts of Laos were invaded and occupied by North Vietnam for use as a supply route for its war against the [[Republic of Vietnam|South]]. In response, the United States initiated a bombing campaign against the North Vietnamese positions, supported regular and irregular anticommunist forces in Laos and supported [[ARVN|South Vietnamese]] incursions into Laos.

In 1968 the North Vietnamese Army launched a multi-division attack to help the Pathet Lao to fight the Royal Lao Army. The attack resulted in the army largely demobilising, leaving the conflict to irregular ethnic [[Hmong people|Hmong]] forces of the "U.S. Secret Army" backed by the United States and Thailand, and led by General [[Vang Pao]].

Massive aerial bombardment against the Pathet Lao and invading [[People's Army of Vietnam]] forces were carried out by the [[United States]] to prevent the collapse of the Royal [[Kingdom of Laos]] central government, and to deny the use of the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] to attack US forces in the [[Republic of Vietnam]]. Between 1964 and 1973, the U.S. dropped two million tons of bombs on Laos, nearly equal to the 2.1 million tons of bombs the U.S. dropped on Europe and Asia during all of [[World War II]], making Laos the most heavily bombed country in history relative to the size of its population; ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted this was "nearly a ton for every person in Laos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink1=Ben Kiernan|last1=Kiernan|first1=Ben|last2=Owen|first2=Taylor|url=http://apjjf.org/2015/13/16/Ben-Kiernan/4313.html|title=Making More Enemies than We Kill?

In 1975 the [[Pathet Lao]], along with the Vietnam People's Army, and backed by the [[Soviet Union]], overthrew the [[Kingdom of Laos|royalist Lao government]], forcing King [[Savang Vatthana]] to abdicate on 2 December 1975. He later died in prison. Between 20,000 and 62,000 Laotians died during the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Obermeyer|first1=Ziad|last2=Murray|first2=Christopher J.

On 2 December 1975, after taking control of the country, the Pathet Lao government under [[Kaysone Phomvihane]] renamed the country as the ''Lao People's Democratic Republic'' and signed agreements giving Vietnam the right to station armed forces and to appoint advisers to assist in overseeing the country. In a paper published in 1990, [[Hmong people|Hmong]]-rights activist [[Vang Pobzeb]] wrote that Laos was colonial territory of Vietnam since 2 December 1975 and was directed by Vietnam in its internal and external affairs.&lt;ref name="VangPobzeb"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vang|first1=Pobzeb|title=White Paper on Vietnamese Aggressions in Laos: 1954-1990|url=https://repository.asu.edu/attachments/167812/content/5-27.pdf|publisher=Digital Repository, Arizona State University|pp=24–25|accessdate=18 April 2018|date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The close ties between Laos and Vietnam were formalized via a treaty signed in 1977, which has since provided not only directions for Lao foreign policy, but also the basis for Vietnamese involvement at all levels of Lao political and economic life.&lt;ref name="Martin Stuart-Fox"&gt;Stuart-Fox, Martin (1980).

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Laos}}
[[File:Mekong River (Luang Prabang).jpg|thumb|[[Mekong River]] flowing through [[Luang Prabang]] ]]
[[File:Laos ricefields.JPG|thumb|[[Paddy fields]] in Laos]]
Laos is the only landlocked country in Southeast Asia, and it lies mostly between latitudes [[14th parallel north|14°]] and [[23rd parallel north|23°N]] (a small area is south of 14°), and longitudes [[100th meridian east|100°]] and [[108th meridian east|108°E]]. Its thickly forested landscape consists mostly of rugged mountains, the highest of which is [[Phou Bia]] at {{convert|2818|m|ft|0}}, with some plains and plateaus. The Mekong River forms a large part of the western boundary with Thailand, whereas the mountains of the [[Annamite Range]] form most of the eastern border with Vietnam and the [[Luang Prabang Range]] the northwestern border with the [[Thai highlands]]. There are two plateaux, the [[Xiangkhoang Plateau|Xiangkhoang]] in the north and the [[Bolaven Plateau]] at the southern end. The climate is tropical and influenced by the [[monsoon]] pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/laos/45.htm|title=Laos – Climate |publisher=Countrystudies.us |accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a distinct rainy season from May to November, followed by a dry season from December to April. Local tradition holds that there are three seasons (rainy, cold and hot) as the latter two months of the climatologically defined dry season are noticeably hotter than the earlier four months. The capital and largest city of Laos is [[Vientiane]] and other major cities include [[Luang Prabang]], [[Savannakhet (city)|Savannakhet]], and [[Pakse]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In 1993 the Laos government set aside 21 percent of the nation's land area for habitat conservation preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indochinatrek.com/laos/lao-guides.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110175658/http://indochinatrek.com/laos/lao-guides.html|archivedate=10 November 2010 |title=Laos travel guides|publisher=Indochinatrek.com |accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country is one of four in the opium poppy growing region known as the "[[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]]". According to the October 2007 UNODC fact book ''Opium Poppy Cultivation in South East Asia'', the poppy cultivation area was {{convert|15|km2|sqmi}}, down from {{convert|18|km2|sqmi}} in 2006.

Laos can be considered to consist of three geographical areas: north, central, and south.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsc.gov.la/Products/Populationcensus2005/PopulationCensus2005_chapter2.htm |title=Nsc Lao Pdr |publisher=Nsc.gov.la |date= |accessdate=21 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123082302/http://www.nsc.gov.la/Products/Populationcensus2005/PopulationCensus2005_chapter2.htm |archivedate=23 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
[[File:Laos map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Laos map of Köppen climate classification.]]
Laos has a mostly tropical savanna climate. A tropical monsoon and humid sub-tropical climate also occurs in places.

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Laos}}
Laos is divided into 17 [[Provinces of Laos|provinces]] (''khoueng'') and one prefecture (''kampheng nakhon''), which includes the capital city Vientiane (''Nakhon Louang Viangchan''). The new province, [[Xaisomboun Province]], was established on 13 December 2013.
Provinces are further divided into [[Districts of Laos|districts]] (''muang'') and then villages (''ban''). An "urban" village is essentially a town.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

===Environmental problems and illegal logging===
{{Further|Deforestation in Laos}}

Laos is increasingly suffering from environmental problems, with deforestation a particularly significant issue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-7823.html|title=Laos Environmental problems &amp; Policy |publisher=United Nations Encyclopedia of the Nations|accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as expanding commercial exploitation of the forests, plans for additional hydroelectric facilities, foreign demand for wild animals and nonwood forest products for food and traditional medicines, and a growing population all create increasing pressure. 

The [[United Nations Development Programme]] warns: "Protecting the environment and sustainable use of natural resources in Lao PDR is vital for poverty reduction and economic growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undplao.org/whatwedo/energy_env.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311201841/http://www.undplao.org/whatwedo/energy_env.php|archivedate=11 March 2008|title=Energy &amp; Environment for Sustainable Development |publisher=United Nations Development Programme|accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper reported that Laos had started work on the controversial [[Xayaburi Dam]] on the [[Mekong River]] without getting formal approval. Environmentalists say the dam will adversely affect 60 million people and Cambodia and Vietnam—concerned about the flow of water further downstream—are officially opposed to the project. The [[Mekong River Commission]], a regional intergovernmental body designed to promote the "sustainable management" of the river, famed for its [[Mekong Giant Catfish|giant catfish]], carried out a study that warned if Xayaburi and subsequent schemes went ahead, it would "fundamentally undermine the abundance, productivity and diversity of the Mekong fish resources".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/green-living/mekong-ecology-in-the-balance-as-laos-quietly-begins-work-on-dam-2270082.html|title=Mekong ecology in the balance as Laos quietly begins work on dam|publisher=The Independent|date= 20 April 2011|accessdate=20 April 2011|location=London|first=Andrew|last=Buncombe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neighbouring Vietnam warned that the dam would harm the [[Mekong Delta]], which is the home to nearly 20 million people and supplies around 50 percent of Vietnam's rice output and over 70 percent of both its [[seafood]] and fruit output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://khampoua.wordpress.com/tag/laos-hydroelectric-project/|title=Vietnam worries about impacts from Laos hydroelectric project|publisher=Voices for the Laotian Who do not have Voices |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By building dams Laos is willing to become the battery of Asia by selling electricity to its neighboring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/09/laos-building-dams-negative-impacts-180911043821027.html|title=Laos to keep building dams despite negative impacts|website=www.aljazeera.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Milton Osborne]], Visiting Fellow at the [[Lowy Institute for International Policy]] who has written widely on the Mekong, warns: "The future scenario is of the Mekong ceasing to be a bounteous source of fish and guarantor of agricultural richness, with the great river below China becoming little more than a series of unproductive lakes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/mekong-dam-plans-threatening-the-natural-order/story-e6frg6ux-1226083709322|title=Mekong dam plans threatening the natural order|publisher=The Australian|author=Osborne, Milton |date=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illegal logging is also a major problem. Environmental groups estimate that {{convert|500000|m3}} of logs are being cut by [[Vietnam People's Army]] (VPA) forces, and companies it owns, in co-operation with the [[Lao People's Army]] and then transported from Laos to Vietnam every year, with most of the furniture eventually exported to western countries by the VPA military-owned companies.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Investigation Agency (26 September 2012) [http://eia-international.org/laos-forests-still-falling-to-connected-businesses "Laos' forests still falling to 'connected' businesses"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illegal-logging.info/item_single.php?it_id=2605&amp;it=news|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204130032/http://illegal-logging.info/item_single.php?it_id=2605&amp;it=news|dead-url=yes|archivedate=4 December 2010|title=U.S. furniture demand drives illegal logging in Laos|publisher=illegal-logging.info|accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CleanBiz.Asia News (31 July 2011) "Vietnam army accused of illegal timber trading in Laos" http://www.cleanbiz.asia/news/vietnam-army-accused-illegal-timber-trading-laos#.VKmlVKLZqSo{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radio Australia News (3 October 2012) [http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/program/connect-asia/laos-failing-to-act-on-illegal-logging-says-environmental-agency/1024722 "Laos failing to act on illegal logging, says environmental agency"]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1992 government survey indicated that forests occupied about 48 percent of Laos's land area. Forest coverage decreased to 41 percent in a 2002 survey. Lao authorities have said that, in reality, forest coverage might be no more than 35 percent because of development projects such as dams, on top of the losses to [[illegal logging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/lao/news/a-52-2009-02-24-voa3-90694899.html|title=Illegal Logging Increasingly Prevalent in Laos|publisher=voanews.com|accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poor sanitation can affect people health and national economy development. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Minh|first=Hoang|last2=Nguyen-Viet|first2=Hung|date=18 October 2011|title=Economic Aspects of Sanitation in Developing Countries|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3212862/|journal=Environmental Health Insights|volume=5|pages=63–70|doi=10.4137/EHI.S8199|issn=1178-6302|pmc=3212862|pmid=22084575}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annually, poor sanitation and hygiene problem cause three million disease cases in Lao, 6.000 premature deaths and the children in rural areas suffer from poor sanitation is very high at 49 percent in 2011 making 193 million dollar national economic loss per year, equal to 5.6% of GDP.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In Laos, there are major incidences of dysentery and diarrhea caused partly by deficient sanitation, improper water supply and absence of adequate wastewater treatment facilities as a result of rapid increase in urban population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/monitoring/jmp2000.pdf|title=Global Water Supply and Sanitation Assessment 2000 Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Laos people who can get access to sanitation in rural areas account for only 36 percent in 2004.

The Mekong River plays an important role for Laos economy. The Mekong River basin covers nearly 90 percent of Laos country and drains toward Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/basins/mekong/mekong-CP_eng.pdf|title=Mekong River Basin|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Laos, government encourages hydro-power investment which increase pressure on water and sea animal threats. The development of electricity in Laos and export to neighboring countries are essential for government revenues to reduce poverty. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Although hydro-power does not pollute water or air directly, hydro-power reservoir and dam can impact the change in environment, land use and natural habitats. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Varma|first=C.

Fisheries contributes about 13 percent of Laos national GDP per year. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Because Laos is covered almost by the Mekong River, people use stream directly for drinking, cooking, bathing and washing. However, as the population increases, watercourses that are used simultaneously for water disposal and water supply cause health issues like diarrhea and typhoid. &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scientists4mekong.com/mekong-river-water-quality-woes/|title=Mekong River – Water Quality Woes – Scientists for the Mekong|website=www.scientists4mekong.com|accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, locals stated that before the upstream dams were built they could safely drink the Mekong River water. However, after the Xayaburi Dam in Laos is built, the water quality become contaminated. The water quality in Laos become even worse when a new dam is built in Don Sahong, less than 2 kilometer from the town, causing the population get diarrhea and inhale with bad air quality. &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  More importantly, most population live near the Mekong river found dead fish floating in polluted water in the area between the Don Sahong Dam and Preah Rumkel (cambodia) which made their only source of water for drinking, cooking, fishing and every day chores as disaster. &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;


There is a high chance of getting malaria for those who live around the water which is surrounded by mosquitoes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Through the Millennium Development program, some progresses have been achieved over the past decade in improving healthy system in Laos. The number of health facilities increased by 75 percents, mortality from malaria reduced by 60 percent in rural areas. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, Lao population has been meet healthy living standard. &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/conf/ldc/pdf/laos%20pdr.pdf|title=LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC|last=|first=|date=2001-2010|website=|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some rural areas, people are lacked of safe drinking water, chemical runoff, sewage and limited access to health services. &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For example, malnutrition, non-hygienic lifestyle, poverty are caused by inadequate public health services. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/knowledge/publications/lao_country_report.pdf|title=Success Factors for Women's and Children's Health|last=|first=|date=|website=Lao PDR, Ministry of Health|archive-url=|archivedate=2015|dead-url=|accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lao is one of the dominant renewable water resource in Asia, 25 percent of urban dwellers and 40 percent of rural Lao population are lacked access to safe drinking water.

Hazardous chemicals that include heavy metals such as chromium, copper, zinc and persistent organic pollutants such as furans, dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls are widely banned while Lao population are not fully aware of its catastrophic effects. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; As the population in Lao keeps growing, heavy mental contamination from industrial activities increases which lead to a concern toward rudimentary metal smelting facilities in the country and mining activities. Therefore, the surface water quality in downstream of mining and industrial activities become a potential problem for Laos well being. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Life On Land ===
Government intervention policies have been implemented to address concerns such as unsustainable timber harvesting, slash-and-burn cultivation, and the allocation of forestland to other purposes such as agriculture, industry, and infrastructure development.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Se Bin|last2=Alounsavath|first2=Oupakone|date=13 March 2015|title=Forest policy measures influence on the increase of forest cover in northern Laos|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21580103.2014.977358?src=recsys|journal=Forest Science and Technology|volume=11|issue=3|pages=166–171|doi=10.1080/21580103.2014.977358|issn=2158-0103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major causes of continued forest degradation from that point onward was not due to policy failure, but rather a lack of multiple factors which include: funding, law enforcement, experienced workers, and organization in the economic sector.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other attempts such as reducing the rural population, allowing for tree plantation development, and transitioning from upland rice cultivation to commercial market oriented agricultural practices, however, contributed to the efforts increasing the amount of forest coverage in Laos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bin|first=Kim Se|last2=Alounsavath|first2=Oupakone|date=18 January 2016|title=Factors influencing the increase of forest cover in Luang Prabang Province, Northern Laos|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21580103.2015.1075437|journal=Forest Science and Technology|volume=12|issue=2|pages=98–103|doi=10.1080/21580103.2015.1075437|issn=2158-0103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

USAID also implemented a program called Lowering Emissions in Asia's Forests (LEAF) from 2011 to 2016 to reduce greenhouse gases and minimize the consequences of deforestation.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Lowering Emissions in Asia's Forests|url=https://www.leafasia.org/library/usaid-leaf-final-report|journal=Winrock International|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While USAID LEAF was overseeing the Nam Xam [[National Biodiversity Conservation Areas|National Biodiversity Conservation Area]] (NBCA) in Laos, Climate Protection Through Avoided Deforestation (CliPAD) also simultaneously initiated their project in the Nam Et-Phou Louey National Protected Area (NPA)  which provided a complimentary foundation for USAID LEAF to work upon.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The Lao People's Democratic Republic is one of the world's only [[socialist state]]s openly endorsing [[communism]]. The only legal political party is the [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party]] (LPRP). The head of state is [[President of Laos|President]] [[Bounnhang Vorachith]], also [[General Secretary of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party]].

The head of government is Prime Minister [[Thongloun Sisoulith]], who is also a member of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party's Politburo. Government policies are determined by the party through the all-powerful eleven-member [[Politburo of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party]] and the 61-member [[Central Committee of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party]]. Important government decisions are vetted by the Council of Ministers. {{Update inline span|text=The [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] maintains significant influence over the Politburo of Laos and the one-party communist state apparatus and military.|date=October 2018}}&lt;ref name="VangPobzeb" /&gt;

Laos's first, French-written and monarchical constitution was promulgated on 11 May 1947, and declared Laos an independent state within the [[French Union]]. The revised constitution of 11 May 1957 omitted reference to the French Union, though close educational, health and technical ties with the former colonial power persisted. The 1957 document was abrogated on 3 December 1975, when a communist People's Republic was proclaimed. A new constitution was adopted in 1991 and enshrined a "leading role" for the LPRP. In 1990, deputy minister for science &amp; technology [[Thongsouk Saysangkhi]] resigned from the government and party, calling for political reform. He died in captivity in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA26/007/1998/en| author=Amnesty International| date=29 April 1998| title=Thongsouk Saysangkhi's death}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 elections were held for a new 85-seat [[National Assembly of Laos|National Assembly]] with members, nominated by the one-party communist government, elected by secret ballot to five-year terms. The elections were widely disputed and questioned by Lao and Hmong opposition and dissident groups abroad and in Laos and Thailand. This National Assembly, which essentially acts as a [[Rubber stamp (politics)|rubber stamp]] for the LPRP, approves all new laws, although the executive branch retains authority to issue binding decrees. The most recent elections took place in April 2011. The assembly was expanded to 99 members in 1997, to 115 members in 2006 and finally to 132 members during the 2011 elections.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Military===
{{Main|Lao People's Army}}
The Lao People's Armed Forces (LPAF) are small, poorly funded, and ineffectively resourced.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Its mission is border and internal security, primarily in countering ethnic Hmong insurgent and opposition groups. Together with the Lao People's Revolutionary Party and the government, the [[Lao People's Army]] (LPA) is the third pillar of state machinery and, as such, is expected to suppress political and civil unrest and similar national emergencies. The LPA has upgraded skills to respond to avian influenza outbreaks. There is no perceived external threat to the state and the LPA maintains strong ties with the neighbouring Vietnamese military (2008).{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}.

The army of 130,000 is equipped with 25 main battle tanks. The army marine section, equipped with 16 patrol crafts, has 600 personnel. The air force, with 3,500 personnel, is equipped with anti-aircraft missiles and 24 combat aircraft. Militia self-defence forces number approximately 100,000 organised for local defence. The small arms used by the army include the Soviet [[AKM]] assault rifle, [[PK machine gun|PKM]] machine gun, [[Makarov PM]] pistol, and [[RPD]] light machine gun.

Since its founding, the LPA has received significant support, training, advisers, troop support and assistance from the Socialist Republic of [[Vietnam]] and the [[Vietnam People's Army]].

On 17 May 2014 the Defense Minister, who was also Deputy Prime Minister, Major General Douangchay Phichit, with other top ranking officials was killed in a plane crash in the north of the country. The officials were to participate in a ceremony to mark the liberation of the Plain of Jars from the former Royal Lao government forces. Their Russian-built Antonov AN 74–300 with 20 people on board crashed in Xiengkhouang province.&lt;ref name="PlaneCrash"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lao Defense Chief Among Plane Crash Victims|url=http://www.laosnews.net/index.php/sid/222069677/scat/a6670896145a3ae3/ht/Lao-Defense-Chief-Among-Plane-Crash-Victims|date=18 May 2014|accessdate=17 May 2014|website=Laos News.Net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hmong conflict ===
The government of Laos has been accused of committing [[genocide]], and [[human rights]] and [[religious freedom]] violations against the Hmong ethnic minority within its own borders.&lt;ref name="Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.unpo.org/article/5095|author1=Unrepresented Nations |author2=Peoples Organization | accessdate=20 April 2011|title=WGIP: Side event on the Hmong Lao, at the United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Hmong groups fought as CIA-backed units on the royalist side in the [[Laotian Civil War]]. After the Pathet Lao took over the country in 1975, the conflict continued in isolated pockets. In 1977, a communist newspaper promised the party would hunt down the "American collaborators" and their families "to the last root".&lt;ref name="timesonline2006"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article690367.ece |work=The Times |date = 30 July 2006 |title = No way out |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As many as 200,000 Hmong went into exile in Thailand, with many ending up in the US. A number of Hmong fighters hid out in mountains in [[Xiangkhouang Province]] for many years, with a remnant emerging from the jungle in 2003.&lt;ref name="timesonline2006" /&gt;

In 1989, the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR), with the support of the US government, instituted the [[Comprehensive Plan of Action]], a programme to stem the tide of [[boat people|Indochinese refugees]] from Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Under the plan, refugee status was evaluated through a screening process. Recognized asylum seekers were given resettlement opportunities, while the remaining refugees were to be repatriated under guarantee of safety.

[[File:Hmong girls in Laos 1973 2.jpg|thumb|right|Hmong girls in Laos, 1973]]
After talks with the UNHCR and the Thai government, Laos agreed to repatriate the 60,000 Lao refugees living in Thailand, including several thousand Hmong people. Very few of the Lao refugees, however, were willing to return voluntarily.&lt;ref&gt;"Laos agrees to voluntary repatriation of refugees in Thailand", U.P.I., 5 June 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure to resettle the refugees grew as the Thai government worked to close its remaining refugee camps. While some Hmong people returned to Laos voluntarily, with development assistance from UNHCR, allegations of forced repatriation surfaced.&lt;ref&gt;"Lao Refugees Return Home Under European Union Repatriation Program", Associated Press Worldstream, 22 11, 1994. Karen J, "House Panel Hears Concerns About Hmong", States News Service, 26 April 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Of those Hmong who did return to Laos, some quickly escaped back to Thailand, describing discrimination and brutal treatment at the hands of Lao authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton-Merritt, Jane (1993). ''Tragic Mountains'', Indiana University Press, pp. xix–xxi {{ISBN|0253207568}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Vue Mai, a former Hmong soldier and leader of the largest Hmong refugee camp in Thailand, who had been recruited by the US&amp;nbsp;Embassy in [[Bangkok]] to return to Laos as proof of the repatriation programme's success, disappeared in [[Vientiane]]. According to the US&amp;nbsp;Committee for Refugees, he was arrested by Lao security forces and was never seen again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1994-05-01/news/25827599_1_vang-pao-vientiane-lao-government|title=Hmong Leader's Vanishing In Laos Reverberates in U.S.|accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Vue Mai incident, debate over the Hmong's planned repatriation to Laos intensified greatly, especially in the United States, where it drew strong opposition from many [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatives]] and some [[human rights]] advocates. In a 23 October 1995 ''[[National Review]]'' article, [[Michael Johns (policy analyst)|Michael Johns]], the former [[The Heritage Foundation|Heritage Foundation]] foreign policy expert and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[White House]] aide, labelled the Hmong's repatriation a [[Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]] "betrayal", describing the Hmong as a people "who have spilled their blood in defense of American geopolitical interests".&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;Johns, Michael (23 October 1995) [https://web.archive.org/web/20070705214752/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n20_v47/ai_17443642 "Acts of Betrayal: Persecution of Hmong"]. ''National Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; Debate on the issue escalated quickly. In an effort to halt the planned repatriation, the Republican-led [[US&amp;nbsp;Senate]] and [[U.S. House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] both appropriated funds for the remaining Thailand-based Hmong to be immediately resettled in the United States; Clinton, however, responded by promising a veto of the legislation.

In their opposition of the repatriation plans, Democratic and Republican Members of Congress challenged the Clinton administration's position that the government of Laos was not systematically violating Hmong [[human rights]]. US Representative [[Steve Gunderson (politician)|Steve Gunderson]] (R-WI), for instance, told a Hmong gathering: "I do not enjoy standing up and saying to my government that you are not telling the truth, but if that is necessary to defend truth and justice, I will do that."&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; Republicans called several Congressional hearings on alleged persecution of the Hmong in Laos in an apparent attempt to generate further support for their opposition to the Hmong's repatriation to Laos. Democratic Congressman [[Bruce Vento]], Senator [[Paul Wellstone]], [[Dana Rohrabacher]] and others also raised concerns.

Although some accusations of forced repatriation were denied,&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=hb909nb5j8&amp;brand=calisphere&amp;doc.view=entire_text Reports on results of investigations of allegations concerning the welfare of Hmong refugees and asylum seekers in Thailand and Laos] Refugee and Migration Affairs Unit, United States Embassy (Thailand), 1992. Retrieved 27 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; thousands of Hmong people refused to return to Laos. In 1996 as the deadline for the closure of Thai refugee camps approached, and under mounting political pressure, the United States agreed to resettle Hmong refugees who passed a new screening process.&lt;ref&gt;Gunderson, Steve (18 May 1996) "State Department Outlines Resettlement Guidelines for Hmong Refugees", ''Congressional Press Releases''.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 5,000 Hmong people who were not resettled at the time of the camp closures sought asylum at [[Wat Tham Krabok]], a Buddhist monastery in central Thailand where more than 10,000 Hmong refugees had already been living.

Following threats of forcible removal by the Thai government, the United States, in a significant victory for the Hmong, agreed to accept 15,000 of the refugees in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090117073258/http://www.state.gov/g/prm/rls/fs/2004/28212.htm "Refugee Admissions Program for East Asia"] Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, 16 January 2004, archived 17 January 2009 from [https://www.state.gov/g/prm/rls/fs/2004/28212.htm the original] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117073258/http://www.state.gov/g/prm/rls/fs/2004/28212.htm |date=17 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several thousand Hmong people, fearing forced repatriation to Laos if they were not accepted for resettlement in the United States, fled the camp to live elsewhere within Thailand where a sizeable Hmong population has been present since the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.centralcallegal.org/hrtf/history/index.html |date = 7 March 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081021133910/http://www.centralcallegal.org/hrtf/history/index.html |title = History of the Hmong Resettlement Task Force |publisher = Hmong Resettlement Task Force |archivedate = October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 and 2005, thousands of Hmong fled from the jungles of Laos to a temporary refugee camp in the Thai province of [[Phetchabun Province|Phetchabun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4724199.stm |work = BBC News |title = Hmong refugees pleading to stay |date = 28 July 2005 |accessdate = 4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Hmong refugees, many of whom are descendants of the former-CIA Secret Army and their relatives, claim that they have been attacked by both the Lao and Vietnamese military forces operating inside Laos as recently as June 2006. The refugees claim that attacks against them have continued almost unabated since the war officially ended in 1975, and have become more intense in recent years.

Lending further support to earlier claims that the government of Laos was persecuting the Hmong, filmmaker Rebecca Sommer documented first-hand accounts in her documentary, ''Hunted Like Animals'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sommerfilms.org/documentaries/Hmong/index.php Hunted like animals] Rebecca Sommer Film Clips&lt;/ref&gt; and in a comprehensive report that includes summaries of refugee claims and was submitted to the UN in May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthpeoples.org/new/report-download/REPORT-Hmong-Rebecca_Sommer.pdf REPORT on the situation in the Xaysomboun Special Zone and 1100 Hmong-Lao refugees who escaped to Petchabun, Thailand during 2004–2005] Rebecca Sommer, May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

For the time being, countries willing to resettle the refugees are hindered in their immigration and settlement procedures because the Thai administration does not grant them access to the refugees. Plans to resettle additional Hmong refugees in the United States have been complicated by provisions of President George W. Bush's [[Patriot Act]] and [[Real ID Act]], under which Hmong veterans of the Secret War, who fought on the side of the United States, are classified as terrorists because of their historical involvement in armed conflict.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Human rights===
{{Main|Human rights in Laos}}
Human rights violations remain a significant concern in Laos. Prominent civil society advocates, human rights defenders, political and religious dissidents, and Hmong refugees have disappeared at the hands of Lao military and security forces.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Philip, Washington, D.C. (12 December 2014) [http://www.centerforpublicpolicyanalysis.org CPPA – Center for Public Policy Analysis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406154059/http://www.centerforpublicpolicyanalysis.org/ |date=6 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ostensibly, the [[Constitution of Laos]] that was [[promulgated]] in 1991, and amended in 2003, contains most key safeguards for human rights. For example, Article&amp;nbsp;8 makes it clear that Laos is a [[multiethnic]] state and is committed to equality between ethnic groups. The Constitution also contains provisions for [[gender equality]], [[freedom of religion]], [[freedom of speech]], and freedom of press and assembly. On 25 September 2009, Laos ratified the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], nine years after signing the treaty. The stated policy objectives of both the Lao government and international donors remain focused upon achieving sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/lao |title=Lao PDR |publisher=World Bank |date=14 July 2011 |accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/laos.pdf |title=Constitution of the Lao PDR |format=PDF |accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the government of Laos frequently breaches its own constitution and the rule of law, since the [[judiciary]] and judges are appointed by the ruling communist party—an [[Judicial independence|independent judicial branch]] does not exist. According to independent non-profit/non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as [[Amnesty International]],&lt;ref name="Amnesty International" /&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/supporting_resources/hrw_submission_to_the_european_union-laos_hr_dialogue_-proofed.pdf|title=Human Rights Watch Concerns on Laos Submitted in advance of the EU-Laos Human Rights Dialogue October 2015|last=|first=|date=2015|website=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Civil Rights Defenders,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.civilrightsdefenders.org/news/tackle-human-rights-abuses-in-laos/|title=Human Rights Abuses in Laos Must be Tackled Now|last=|first=|date=31 August 2016|website=Civil Rights Defenders|accessdate=9 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005051410/https://www.civilrightsdefenders.org/news/tackle-human-rights-abuses-in-laos/|archivedate=5 October 2017|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the U.S. State Department&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2016&amp;dlid=265348#wrapper|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016|last=United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor|first=|date=|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; serious human rights violations such as arbitrary detentions, disappearances, free speech restrictions, prison abuses and other violations are an ongoing problem.

Amnesty International raised concerns about the ratification record of the Lao government on human rights standards, and its lack of co-operation with the UN human rights mechanisms and legislative measures—both impact negatively upon human rights. The organisation also raised concerns in relation to freedom of expression, poor prison conditions, restrictions on freedom of religions, protection of refugees and asylum-seekers, and the death penalty.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa26/003/2009/en/ |author=Amnesty International |date=May 2010 |title=Submission to the UN Universal Periodic Review: Eighth session of the UPR Working Group of the Human Rights Council }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1999, 30 young people were arrested for attempting to display posters calling for peaceful economic, political and social change in Laos. Five of them were arrested and subsequently sentenced to up to 10 years imprisonment on charges of treason. One has since died due to his treatment by prison guards, while one has been released. The surviving three men should have been released by October 2009, but their whereabouts remain unknown.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"/&gt; Later reports have contradicted this, claiming they were sentenced to 20 years in prison.&lt;ref name="Worldwide Movement for Human Rights"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fidh.org/en/region/asia/laos/free-former-student-leaders-arbitrarily-detained-for-17-years| author=Worldwide Movement for Human Rights|date=October 2016|title=Free former student leaders arbitrarily detained for 17 years}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Centre for Public Policy Analysis]], [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[US Commission on International Religious Freedom]], the [[Lao Veterans of America]], Inc. and other non-governmental organisations (NGO)s have reported egregious human rights violations, religious persecution, the arrest and imprisonment of political and religious dissidents as well as extrajudicial killings, in Laos by government military and security forces.&lt;ref name=BW&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130304006755/en/Laos-Attacks-Intensify-Lao-Hmong-People "Laos: Attacks Intensify Against Lao, Hmong People"]. ''Business Wire'', Washington, D.C. (4 March 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights advocates including [[Vang Pobzeb]], [[Kerry and Kay Danes]] and others have also raised concerns about human rights violations, torture, the arrest and detention of political prisoners as well as the detention of foreign prisoners in Laos including at the infamous [[Phonthong Prison]] in Vientiane. Concerns have been raised about the high-profile abduction of Laotian civic activist and Lao PDR's only living [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] laureate [[Sombath Somphone]] by Lao security forces and police on 15 December 2012.

==Foreign relations==
The foreign relations of Laos after the takeover by the [[Pathet Lao]] in December 1975, were characterized by a hostile posture toward the West, with the government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic aligning itself with the [[Soviet bloc]], maintaining close ties with the [[Soviet Union]] and depending heavily on the Soviets for most of its foreign assistance. Laos also maintained a "special relationship" with Vietnam and formalized a 1977 treaty of friendship and cooperation that created tensions with China.

With the collapse of the Soviet Union and with Vietnam's decreased ability to provide assistance, Laos has sought to improve relations with its regional neighbours.

Laos's emergence from [[international isolation]] has been marked through improved and expanded relations with other nations such as Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, China, Turkey, Australia, France, Japan, and Sweden. Trade relations with the United States were normalized in 2004.

Laos was admitted into the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) in July 1997 and applied to join the [[World Trade Organization]] in 1998. In 2005 it attended the inaugural [[East Asia Summit]].

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Laos}}
[[File:Rice planting near Champasak (Laos).jpg|thumb|left|About 80% of the Laotian population practises [[subsistence agriculture]].]]
The Lao economy depends heavily on investment and trade with its neighbours, Thailand, Vietnam, and, especially in the north, China. [[Pakxe]] has also experienced growth based on cross-border trade with Thailand and Vietnam. In 2009, despite the fact that the government is still officially communist, the Obama administration in the US declared Laos was no longer a Marxist–Leninist state and lifted bans on Laotian companies receiving financing from the [[US Export-Import Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/18/world/asia/18laos.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|publisher=New York Times|author=THOMAS FULLER|title=Communism and Capitalism Are Mixing in Laos|date=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the [[Lao Securities Exchange]] began trading.

In 2016, China was the biggest foreign investor in Laos's economy, having invested in US$5.395 billion since 1989, according to Laos Ministry of Planning and Investment 1989–2014 report.

[[Subsistence agriculture]] still accounts for half of the GDP and provides 80 percent of employment. Only 4.01 percent of the country is arable land, and a mere 0.34 percent used as permanent crop land,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2097.html Field Listing – Land use], ''CIA World Factbook''.&lt;/ref&gt; the lowest percentage in the [[Greater Mekong Subregion]].&lt;ref&gt;About Greater Mekong Subregion at [https://web.archive.org/web/20111117130328/http://beta.adb.org/countries/gms/main Asian Development Bank]&lt;/ref&gt; Rice dominates agriculture, with about 80 percent of the arable land area used for growing rice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070628094304/http://www.irri.org/donors/SDC/pdfs/RiceFabricOf%20LifeInLaos.pdf Rice: The Fabric of Life in Laos].

The economy receives [[development aid]] from the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[Asian Development Bank|ADB]], and other international sources; and also [[foreign direct investment]] for development of the society, industry, [[hydropower]] and mining (most notably of copper and gold). Tourism is the fastest-growing industry in the country. Economic development in Laos has been hampered by [[brain drain]], with a skilled emigration rate of 37.4 percent in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Özden, Çaḡlar  |author2=Schiff, Maurice W. |title=International migration, remittances, and the brain drain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khtB0xgugD8C|year=2006|publisher=World Bank Publications|isbn=978-0-8213-6372-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laos is rich in mineral resources and imports petroleum and gas. [[Metallurgy]] is an important industry, and the government hopes to attract foreign investment to develop the substantial deposits of [[coal]], gold, [[bauxite]], [[tin]], [[copper]], and other valuable metals. In addition, the country's plentiful water resources and mountainous terrain enable it to produce and export large quantities of hydroelectric energy. Of the potential capacity of approximately 18,000 megawatts, around 8,000 megawatts have been committed for exporting to Thailand and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/Documents/TARs/LAO/40514-LAO-TAR.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515093014/http://www.adb.org/Documents/TARs/LAO/40514-LAO-TAR.pdf |archivedate=15 May 2011 |title=Preparing the Cumulative Impact Assessment for the Nam Ngum 3 Hydropower Project: Financed by the Japan Special Fund |format=PDF |accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country's most widely recognised product may well be [[Beerlao]], which is exported to many developed countries around the world such as the US, Britain, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and neighbours [[Cambodia]] and [[Vietnam]]. It is produced by the [[Lao Brewery Company]].

The [[Mining industry of Laos]] has received prominent attention with Foreign Direct Investments (FDI). This sector, since 2003–04, has made significant contributions to the economic condition of Laos. More than 540 mineral deposits of gold, copper, zinc,
lead and other minerals have been identified, explored and mined.&lt;ref name=Kyophilvong&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kyophilvong|first=Phouphet|url=http://www.ide.go.jp/English/Publish/Download/Brc/pdf/02_ch3.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106165900/http://www.ide.go.jp/English/Publish/Download/Brc/pdf/02_ch3.pdf|dead-url=yes|archivedate=6 January 2013|format=pdf|title=Mining Sector in Laos|accessdate=29 November 2015|publisher=Institute of Developing Economies|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, one in every 10.9 jobs was in the tourism sector. Export earnings from international visitors and tourism goods are expected to generate 15.5 percent of total exports or US$270.3 million in 2010, growing in nominal terms to US$484.2 million (12.5 percent of the total) in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wttc.org/eng/Tourism_Research/Economic_Research/Country_Reports/Laos/ |title=Laos – Key Facts|publisher=World Travel &amp; Tourism Council |accessdate=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main attractions for tourists include Buddhist culture and colonial architecture in [[Luang Prabang]]; gastronomy and ancient temples in the capital of [[Vientiane]]; backpacking in [[Muang Ngoi Neua]] and [[Vang Vieng]]; ancient and modern culture and history in the [[Plain of Jars]] region (main article: [[Phonsavan]]); [[Laos Civil War]] history in [[Xam Neua|Sam Neua]]; trekking and visiting [[Hill tribe (Thailand)|hill tribes]] in a number of areas including [[Phongsaly]] and [[Luang Namtha]]; spotting [[tiger]]s and other wildlife in [[Nam Et-Phou Louey]]; caves and waterfalls near [[Thakhek]]; relaxation, the [[Irrawaddy dolphin]] and [[Khone Phapheng Falls]] at [[Si Phan Don]] or, as they are known in English, the Four Thousand Islands; [[Wat Phu]], an ancient [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] temple complex; and the [[Bolaven Plateau]] for waterfalls and coffee. The European Council on Trade and Tourism awarded the country the "World Best Tourist Destination" designation for 2013 for this combination of architecture and history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ectt.webs.com/apps/blog/show/26368358-european-council-on-tourism-and-trade-delegation-visit-to-laos-world-best-tourist-destination European Council On Tourism And Trade Delegation Visit To Laos-World Best Tourist Destination – European Council On Tourism And Trade].

Luang Prabang and Wat Phu are both [[UNESCO World Heritage]] sites, with the Plain of Jars expected to join them once more work to clear [[Unexploded ordnance|UXO]] has been completed. Major festivals include Lao New Year celebrated around 13–15 April and involves a [[water festival]] similar but more subdued than that of Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries.

The Lao National Tourism Administration, related government agencies and the private sector are working together to realize the vision put forth in the country's National Ecotourism Strategy and Action Plan. This includes decreasing the environmental and cultural impact of tourism; increasing awareness in the importance of ethnic groups and biological diversity; providing a source of income to conserve, sustain and manage the Lao protected area network and cultural heritage sites; and emphasizing the need for tourism zoning and management plans for sites that will be developed as [[ecotourism]] destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecotourismlaos.com/laoecotourism.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122030330/http://ecotourismlaos.com/laoecotourism.htm|archivedate=22 November 2010|title=The Lao People's Democratic Republic's Vision for Ecotourism |accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laos is known for silk and local handicraft products, which are on display in Luang Prabang's night market, among other places. Another specialty is mulberry tea.

===Infrastructure===
{{Main|Transport in Laos|Telecommunications in Laos}}
[[File:nam ou 1.jpg|thumb|Rivers are an important means of transport in Laos.]]
The main international airports are Vientiane's [[Wattay International Airport]] and [[Luang Prabang International Airport]] with [[Pakse International Airport]] also having a few international flights. The national carrier is [[Lao Airlines]]. Other carriers serving the country include [[Bangkok Airways]], [[Vietnam Airlines]], [[AirAsia]], [[Thai Airways International]], [[China Eastern Airlines]] and [[Silk Air]].

Much of Laos lacks adequate infrastructure. Laos has no railways, except a short link to connect Vientiane with Thailand over the [[Thai–Lao Friendship Bridge]]. A short [[portage railway]], the [[Don Det – Don Khon narrow gauge railway|Don Det—Don Khon narrow gauge railway]] was built by the French in [[Champasak Province]] but has been closed since the 1940s. In the late 1920s, work began on the Thakhek–Tan Ap railway that would have run between [[Thakhek]], [[Khammouane Province]] and [[Tân Ấp Railway Station]], [[Quảng Bình Province]], Vietnam through the [[Mụ Giạ Pass]]. The scheme was aborted in the 1930s. The major roads connecting the major urban centres, in particular [[Route 13 (Laos)|Route 13]], have been significantly upgraded in recent years, but villages far from major roads can be reached only through unpaved roads that may not be accessible year-round.

There is limited external and internal telecommunication, but mobile phones have become widespread in urban centres. In many rural areas electricity is at least partly available. [[Songthaew]]s (pick-up trucks with benches) are used in the country for long-distance and local public transport.

Laos has made particularly noteworthy progress increasing access to [[sanitation]] and has already met its 2015 [[Millennium Development Goal]] (MDG) target.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;O'Meally, Simon (2010). [http://www.developmentprogress.org/progress-stories/lao-pdrs-progress-rural-sanitation Lao PDR's progress in rural sanitation]. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; Laos's predominantly rural (68 percent, source: Department of Statistics, Ministry of Planning and Investment, 2009) population makes investing in sanitation difficult. In 1990 only eight percent of the rural population had access to improved sanitation.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Access rose rapidly from 10 percent in 1995 to 38 percent in 2008. Between 1995 and 2008 approximately 1,232,900 more people had access to improved sanitation in rural areas.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

Laos's progress is notable in comparison to similar developing countries.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; This success is in part due to small-scale independent providers emerging in a spontaneous manner or having been promoted by public authorities. The authorities in Laos have recently developed an innovative regulatory framework for Public–Private partnership contracts signed with small enterprises, in parallel with more conventional regulation of State-owned water enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afd.fr/lang/en/home/publications/travaux-de-recherche/publications-scientifiques/focales |title=Focales n° 8.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Laos}}

The term "Laotian" does not necessarily refer to the Lao language, ethnic Lao people, language or customs. It is a political term that includes the non-ethnic Lao groups within Laos and identifies them as "Laotian" because of their political citizenship. Laos has the youngest population of any country in Asia with a median age of 21.6 years.

Laos's population was estimated at {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Lao People's Democratic Republic}}|,||}}/1e6 round 1}} million in {{UN_Population|Year}}, dispersed unevenly across the country. Most people live in valleys of the Mekong River and its tributaries. Vientiane prefecture, the capital and largest city, had about 740,010 residents in 2008. The country's population density was 27/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Background notes - Laos"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2770.htm |title=Background notes – Laos |publisher=US Department of State |accessdate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnicity===
{{Main|Demographics of Laos}}
The people of Laos are often considered by their altitudinal distribution (lowlands, midlands and upper high lands) as this approximates ethnic groups.

====Lao Loum (lowland people)====
More than half of the nation's population is ethnic Lao—the principal lowland inhabitants, and the politically and culturally dominant people of Laos.&lt;ref name="UN Demographic Yearbooks"&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb2.htm#2001 UN Demographic Yearbooks]&lt;/ref&gt; The Lao belong to the [[Tai languages|Tai]] linguistic group&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.vn/books?id=0lmQAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA680&amp;ots=TpEnWhLSgV&amp;dq=kra%3DKadai&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q=kra=Kadai&amp;f=false Diller, Anthony; Edmondson, Jerry; Luo, Yongxian (2004).

''MANUSYA: Journal of Humanities,'' Special Issue No 20: 47–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Ten percent belong to other "lowland" groups, which together with the Lao people make up the [[Lao Loum]].&lt;ref name="UN Demographic Yearbooks"/&gt;

====Lao Theung (midland people)====

In the central and southern mountains, [[Mon people|Mon]]-[[Khmer people|Khmer]] tribes, known as [[Lao Theung]] or mid-slope Laotians, predominate. Other terms are Khmu, Khamu (Kammu) or Kha as the Lao Loum refer to them as indicating their [[Austroasiatic]] origins. However, the latter is considered pejorative, meaning 'slave'. They were the indigenous inhabitants of northern Laos. Some [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] and [[Thai people|Thai]] minorities remain, particularly in the towns, but many left after independence in the late 1940s, many of whom relocated either to [[Vietnam]], [[Hong Kong]], or to [[France]]. Lao Theung constitute about 30 percent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omf.org/omf/us/peoples_and_places/people_groups/khmu_of_laos |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109063510/http://www.omf.org/omf/us/peoples_and_places/people_groups/khmu_of_laos |dead-url=yes |archivedate=9 November 2007 |title=Khmu people of Laos.

====Lao Soung (highland people)====

Hill people and minority cultures of Laos such as the [[Hmong people|Hmong]], [[Yao people|Yao (Mien)]], [[Yao people|Dao]], [[Shan people|Shan]], and several [[Tibeto-Burman]] speaking peoples have lived in isolated regions of Laos for many years. Mountain/hill tribes of mixed ethno/cultural-linguistic heritage are found in northern Laos, which include the [[Lua people|Lua]] and [[Khmu people]] who are indigenous to Laos. Today, the Lua people are considered endangered. Collectively, they are known as [[Lao Soung]] or highland Laotians. Lao Soung account for only about 10 percent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/330219/Laos/52500/People?anchor=ref509292 |title=Laos – Ethnic groups and languages |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ATM-Savannakhet.JPG|thumb|The emergence of rural ATMs proved that law and order has improved.]]

===Languages===

The official and dominant language is [[Lao language|Lao]], a tonal language of the [[Tai languages|Tai]] linguistic group. However, only slightly more than half of the population speaks Lao natively. The remainder, particularly in rural areas, speak ethnic minority languages. The [[Lao alphabet]], which evolved sometime between the 13th and 14th centuries, was derived from the ancient [[Khmer script]] and is very similar to Thai, and easily understood by readers of Thai script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2049433|jstor=2049433|title=Languages and Literatures of Indochina|journal=The Far Eastern Quarterly|volume=6|issue=4|pages=379|year=1947|last1=Benedict|first1=Paul K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Languages like [[Khmu language|Khmu]] and [[Hmong language|Hmong]] are spoken by minorities, particularly in the midland and highland areas. A number of [[Laotian sign languages]] are used in areas with high rates of congenital deafness.

[[File:Lampshades, Night Market, Laos.jpg|thumb|Night Market, Laos]]
[[French language|French]] is still commonly used in government and commerce and over a third of Laos's students are educated through the medium of French with French being compulsory for all other students. Throughout the country signage is bilingual in Lao and French, with French being predominant. [[English language|English]], the language of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ([[ASEAN]]), has become increasingly studied in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/AXL/asie/Laos.htm |title=Languages of Laos |publisher=[[Laval University]] |accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in Laos}}
64.7 percent of Laotians are [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], 1.7 percent are Christian, and 31.5 percent are other or traditional (mostly practitioners of [[Satsana Phi]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/files/2012/12/globalReligion-tables.pdf Pew Research Center's Global Religious Landscape 2010 – Religious Composition by Country].&lt;/ref&gt; according to the 2005 census.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt; [[Buddhism]] has long been one of the most important social forces in Laos. Theravada Buddhism has coexisted peacefully since its introduction to the country with the [[Satsana Phi|local polytheism]].

===Health===
{{Main|Health in Laos}}
Male [[life expectancy at birth]] was at 62.6 years and female life expectancy was at 66.7 years in 2017.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/la.html Laos].

The [[National University of Laos]] is the Lao state's public university.

As a low-income country, Laos faces a brain-drain problem as the most educated people migrate to developed countries. It is estimated that about 37% of educated Laotians live outside of Laos.&lt;ref name="TonyFielding"&gt;Fielding, Tony (2015).

[[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]] is a dominant influence in Lao culture. It is reflected throughout the country from language to the temple and in art, literature, performing arts, etc. Many elements of Lao culture predate Buddhism, however. For example, Laotian music is dominated by its national [[musical instrument|instrument]], the [[khaen]], a type of [[bamboo]] [[Pan pipes|pipe]] that has prehistoric origins. The khaen traditionally accompanied the singer in ''[[Mor lam|lam]]'', the dominant style of [[folk music]]. Among the ''lam'' styles, the ''[[lam saravane]]'' is probably the most popular.

[[Sticky rice]] is a characteristic staple food and has cultural and religious significance to the Lao people. Sticky rice is generally preferred over jasmine rice, and sticky rice cultivation and production is thought to have originated in Laos. There are many traditions and rituals associated with rice production in different environments and among many ethnic groups. For example, Khammu farmers in Luang Prabang plant the rice variety [[Khao Kam]] in small quantities near the hut in memory of dead parents, or at the edge of the rice field to indicate that parents are still alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/Evaluation/case-studies/LAO/Evaluation-Synthesis-on-Rice.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702234215/http://www.adb.org/Evaluation/case-studies/LAO/Evaluation-Synthesis-on-Rice.pdf |archivedate=2 July 2007 |title=Evaluation Synthesis of Rice in Lao PDR |format=PDF |accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sinh (clothing)|Sinh]] is a traditional garment worn by Laotian women in daily life. It is a hand-woven silk skirt that can identify the woman who wears it in a variety of ways. In particular, it can indicate which region the wearer is from.

===Polygamy===
{{Further|Polygamy in Laos}}
[[Polygamy]] is officially a crime in Laos, though the penalty is minor. The constitution and Family Code bar the legal recognition of polygamous marriages, stipulating that [[monogamy]] is the principal form of marriage in the country. Polygamy, however, is still customary among some [[Hmong people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genderindex.org/country/Lao-PDR |title=Lao PDR: Family Code |publisher=Genderindex.org |accessdate=23 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309115646/http://genderindex.org/country/Lao-PDR |archivedate=9 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
All newspapers are published by the government, including two foreign language papers: the English-language daily ''[[Vientiane Times]]'' and the French-language weekly ''[[Le Rénovateur]]''. Additionally, the Khao San Pathet Lao, the country's official news agency, publishes English and French versions of its eponymous paper. Laos currently has nine daily newspapers, 90 magazines, 43 radio stations, and 32 TV stations operating throughout the country.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} {{As of|2011}}, [[Nhân Dân]] (The People) and the [[Xinhua News Agency]] are the only foreign media organisations permitted to open offices in Laos—both opened bureaus in Vientiane in 2011.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The Lao government heavily controls all media channels to prevent critique of its actions. Lao citizens who have criticised the government have been subjected to enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and torture.&lt;ref name="state"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2012/eap/204213.htm |title = 2012 Human Rights Reports: Laos |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atimes"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/NB22Ae01.html |title=Off the air in Laos |publisher=Asia Times Online |accessdate = 9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet cafes are now common in the major urban centres and are especially popular with the younger generation.

Since the founding of the Lao PDR only very few films have been made in Laos. One of the first commercial feature-length films was ''[[Sabaidee Luang Prabang]]'', made in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/good-morning-luang-prabang-ndash-and-hello-to-laoss-film-industry-843557.html |title=Good Good Morning, Luang Prabang – and hello to Laos's film industry  |last=Buncomb |first=Andrew |publisher=The Independent |date=10 June 2010 |accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their first single was released in 1998, an adaptation of "[[The Pink Panther Theme]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neo.hu/i02_en_cnt.html Neo website]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was built by the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Saint John]] in 1715–1716 as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the Maltese Islands. The battery now lies in ruins.

==History==
Ramla Right Battery was built in 1715–1716 as part of the first building programme of coastal batteries in Malta. It was one of several fortifications in Ramla Bay, which also included [[Ramla Left Battery]] on the opposite side of the bay and [[Ramla Redoubt]] in the centre. These were all linked together by an [[Entrenchment (fortification)|entrenchment]] wall. Ramla Bay was further defended by [[Marsalforn Tower]] on the plateau above the bay, and an underwater barrier to prevent enemy ships from landing within the bay.

The battery had a semi-circular parapet with six embrasures, with a blockhouse at the rear. A [[Fougasse (weapon)|fougasse]] was also dug on the shore close to the battery, and it still exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Il-Bajja tar-Ramla|url=http://www.xaghra.com/article/postijiet-storici/il-bajja-tar-ramla/|website=Xaghra.com|accessdate=27 June 2015|language=Maltese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saliba|first1=Mario|title=Ir-Ramla: ġawhra naturali u wirt nazzjonali.|url=https://www.academia.edu/3591456/Ir-Ramla_l-Hamra|website=academia.edu|accessdate=27 June 2015|language=Maltese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The battery saw use during the [[Mediterranean campaign of 1798#Malta|French invasion of Malta]] in 1798, when it fired on the approaching French fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hardman|first1=William|title=A history of Malta during the period of the French and British occupations, 1798-1815|date=1909|publisher=Longmans, Green &amp; Co|location=[[London]]|page=47|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofmaltadu00hard#page/46/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present day==
Today, only some remains of the battery's blockhouse survive. These remains, along with the rest of Ramla Bay, are managed by the Gaia Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ragonesi|first1=Rudolf|title=Gaia Foundation and Ramla l-Ħamra|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130616/environment/Gaia-Foundation-and-Ramla-l-amra.474029|accessdate=27 June 2015|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries have entered into '''tax treaties''' (also called '''double tax agreements''', or DTAs) with other countries to avoid or mitigate [[double taxation]]. Such treaties may cover a range of taxes including [[income taxes]], [[inheritance taxes]], [[value added taxes]], or other taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Agreements on tariffs, while technically tax treaties, are generally called agreements on tariffs and trade.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides bilateral treaties, multilateral treaties are also in place. For example, [[European Union]] (EU) countries are parties to a multilateral agreement with respect to value added taxes under auspices of the EU, while a [[Convention on mutual administrative assistance in tax matters|joint treaty on mutual administrative assistance]] of the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) is open to all countries. Tax treaties tend to reduce taxes of one treaty country for residents of the other treaty country to reduce double taxation of the same income.  

The provisions and goals vary significantly, with very few tax treaties being alike.  Most treaties:
* define which taxes are covered and who is a resident and eligible for benefits,
* reduce the amounts of tax withheld from interest, dividends, and royalties paid by a resident of one country to residents of the other country,
* limit tax of one country on business income of a resident of the other country to that income from a permanent establishment in the first country,
* define circumstances in which income of individuals resident in one country will be taxed in the other country, including salary, self-employment, pension, and other income,
* provide for exemption of certain types of organizations or individuals, and
* provide procedural frameworks for enforcement and dispute resolution.

The stated goals for entering into a treaty often include reduction of double taxation, eliminating tax evasion, and encouraging cross-border trade efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the [http://faculty.law.wayne.edu/tad/Documents/Teaching_Materials/model_treaties.pdf speech] by [http://www.law.wayne.edu/faculty/bio.php?id=43007 Professor McIntyre] of Michigan's Wayne State University.&lt;/ref&gt;   It is generally accepted that tax treaties improve certainty for taxpayers and tax authorities in their international dealings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/dunne+australia-nz+double+tax+agreement+step+closer|title=Comments by New Zealand Revenue Minister|work=Government of New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several governments and organizations use model treaties as starting points. Double taxation treaties generally follow the OECD Model Convention&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/ctp/treaties/2014-model-tax-convention-articles.pdf OECD Model Tax Convention (2014 version)]&lt;/ref&gt; and the  official commentary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/14/32/41147804.pdf|title=official commentary|work=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; and member comments thereon serve as a guidance as to interpretation by each member country. Other relevant models are the UN Model Convention,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/ffd/documents/UN_Model_2011_Update.pdf UN Model Convention (2011 version)]&lt;/ref&gt; in the case of treaties with developing countries and the US Model Convention,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Documents/Treaty-US%20Model-2016.pdf US Model Convention (2016 version)]&lt;/ref&gt; in the case of treaties negotiated by the United States.

==Tax residency==
{{main|Tax residence}}
In general, the benefits of tax treaties are available only to tax residents of one of the treaty countries.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital, Article 1 ("OECD Model")&lt;/ref&gt;  In most cases, a tax resident of a country is any person that is subject to tax under the domestic laws of that country by reason of domicile, residence, place of incorporation, or similar criteria.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., OECD Model, Article 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, individuals are considered resident under a tax treaty and subject to taxation where they maintain their primary place of abode.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the [http://www.fin.gc.ca/treaties-conventions/Belgium_-eng.asp treaty between Canada and Belgium], Article 4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, residence for treaty purposes extends well beyond the narrow scope of primary place of abode. For example, many countries also treat persons spending more than a fixed number of days in the country as residents.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., 26 U.S.C. sec. 7701(b) for the U.S. [[Substantial Presence Test]] for residency.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States includes citizens and green card holders, wherever living, as subject to taxation, and therefore as residents for tax treaty purposes.&lt;ref&gt;See 26 U.S.C. sec. 7701(a)(30)&lt;/ref&gt; Because residence is defined so broadly, most treaties recognize that a person could meet the definition of residence in more than one jurisdiction (i.e., "dual residence") and provide a “tie breaker” clause.&lt;ref name="See"&gt;See, e.g., the Canada/Belgium treaty, supra.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such clauses typically have a hierarchy of three to five tests for resolving multiple residency, typically including permanent abode as a major factor. Tax residency rarely impacts citizenship or permanent resident status, though certain residency statuses under a country's immigration law may influence tax residency. This includes the '183 day rule' when the [[right of abode]] is invoked.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the U.S. IRS [https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc851.html explanation] of residency regarding the "green card test".&lt;/ref&gt;

Entities may be considered resident based on their country of seat of management, their country of organization, or other factors.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the Canada Revenue Agency [http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/nnrsdnts/bsnss/bs-rs-eng.html discussion], and the Canada/Belgium treaty, supra, which defines resident by reference to local law.&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria are often specified in a treaty, which may enhance or override local law. It is possible under most treaties for an entity to be resident in both countries, particularly where a treaty is between two countries that use different standards for residence under their domestic law. Some treaties provide “tie breaker” rules for entity residency,&lt;ref name="See" /&gt; some do not.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the old [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-trty/ussr.pdf treaty] between the United States and the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which is still in force between the U.S. and several of the former Soviet republics.&lt;/ref&gt;  Residency is irrelevant in the case of some entities and/or types of income, as members of the entity rather than the entity are subject to tax.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the U.S. IRS [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/article/0,,id=186396,00.html explanation] of taxation of foreign partners of partnerships with a U.S. trade or business.&lt;/ref&gt; The OECD [[OECD|has]] moved away from place of effective mangement to a case-by-case resolution using Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) for determining conflicts of dual residency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kluwertaxblog.com/2018/08/22/place-effective-management-indian-perspective/|title=Place of Effective Management: Indian Perspective - Kluwer International Tax Blog|date=2018-08-22|work=Kluwer International Tax Blog|access-date=2018-10-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Permanent establishment==
{{main|Permanent establishment}}
Most treaties provide that business profits (sometimes defined in the treaty) of a resident of one country are subject to tax in the other country only if the profits arise through a permanent establishment in the other country. Many treaties, however, address certain types of business profits (such as directors' fees or income from the activities of athletes and entertainers) separately.  Such treaties also define what constitutes a permanent establishment (PE). Most but not all tax treaties follow the definition of PE in the OECD Model Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Contrast the U.S./Italy [http://www.treas.gov/offices/tax-policy/library/italy.pdf treaty] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302085634/http://www.treas.gov/offices/tax-policy/library/italy.pdf |date=2010-03-02 }} using exact OECD language with the U.S./India [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-trty/india.pdf treaty] that has numerous special provisions.&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the OECD definition, a PE is a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is carried on.&lt;ref&gt;2008 OECD Model, Article 5(1)&lt;/ref&gt;  Certain locations are specifically enumerated as examples of PEs, including branches, offices, workshops, and others. Specific exceptions from the definition of PE are also provided, such as a site where only preliminary or ancillary activities (such as warehousing of inventory, purchasing of goods, or collection of information) are conducted.

While in general tax treaties do not specify a period of time for which business activities must be conducted through a location before it gives rise to a PE, most OECD member countries do not find a PE in cases in which a place of business exists for less than six months, absent special circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary to 2008 OECD Model, ¶6&lt;/ref&gt; Many treaties explicitly provide a longer threshold, commonly one year or more, for which a construction site must exist before it gives rise to a permanent establishment.&lt;ref&gt;2008 OECD Model, Article 5(3)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some treaties, most commonly those in which at least one party is a developing country, contain provisions which deem a PE to exist if certain activities (such as services) are conducted for certain periods of time, even where a PE would not otherwise exist.

Even where a resident of one country does not conduct its business activities in another country through a fixed place or business, a PE may still be found to exist in that other country where the business is carried out through a person in that other country that has the authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the resident of the first country.&lt;ref&gt;2008 OECD Model, Article 5(5)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a resident of one country cannot avoid being treated as having a PE by acting through a dependent agent rather than conducting its business directly.  However, carrying on business through an independent agent will generally not result in a PE.&lt;ref&gt;2008 OECD Model, Article 5(6)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Withholding taxes==
{{main|Withholding tax}}
Many tax systems provide for collection of tax from non-residents by requiring payers of certain types of income to withhold tax from the payment and remit it to the tax authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Examples include the [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1441-  U.S.] and [http://www.iras.gov.sg/irasHome/page04.aspx?id=562 Singapore].&lt;/ref&gt; Withholding arrangements may apply to interest, dividends, royalties, and payments for technical assistance. Most tax treaties reduce or eliminate the amount of tax required to be withheld with respect to residents of a treaty country.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the Singapore/India [http://iras.gov.sg/irasHome/uploadedFiles/Quick_Links/singaporeindiadtaincorporatingprotocol2005.pdf treaty].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Income from employment==
Most treaties provide mechanisms eliminating taxation of residents of one country by the other country where the amount or duration of performance of services is minimal but also taxing the income in the country performed where it is not minimal.  Most treaties also provide special provisions for entertainers and athletes of one country having income in the other country, though such provisions vary highly.  Also most treaties provide for limits to taxation of pension or other retirement income.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the Singapore/India [http://iras.gov.sg/irasHome/uploadedFiles/Quick_Links/singaporeindiadtaincorporatingprotocol2005.pdf treaty], Article 15, which has a 183-day rule and a flat 15% tax rate where services go beyond 183 days.  This treaty contains all of the provisions mentioned.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax exemptions==
Most treaties eliminate from taxation income of certain diplomatic personnel.  Most tax treaties also provide that certain entities exempt from tax in one country are also exempt from tax in the other.  Entities typically exempt include charities, pension trusts, and government owned entities.  Many treaties provide for other exemptions from taxation that one or both countries as considered relevant under their governmental or economic system.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the U.S./Canada [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-trty/canada.pdf treaty] Articles XIX and XXI.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harmonization of tax rates==
Tax treaties usually specify the same maximum rate of tax that may be imposed on some types of income.  As an example, a treaty may provide that interest earned by a nonresident eligible for benefits under the treaty is taxed at no more than five percent (5%).  However, local law in some cases may provide a lower rate of tax irrespective of the treaty.  In such cases, the lower local law rate prevails.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the Ireland/U.S. [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-trty/ireland.pdf treaty], under which dividend withholding is limited to 5% or 15%, depending on ownership levels, but where Ireland tax law imposes no withholding tax on [http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/dwt/forms/nonresv2b.pdf qualifying recipients].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions unique to inheritance taxes==
Generally, income taxes and inheritance taxes are addressed in separate treaties.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., treaties between the U.S. and France regarding [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-trty/france.pdf income taxes] and [http://ambafrance-us.org/IMG/pdf_french_us_estate_tax_treaty.pdf estate and gift taxes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613092501/http://ambafrance-us.org/IMG/pdf_french_us_estate_tax_treaty.pdf |date=2010-06-13 }}.  The provisions of this treaty reflect typical patterns, and incorporate all of the features mentioned in this section.&lt;/ref&gt;  Inheritance tax treaties often cover estate and gift taxes.  Generally fiscal domicile under such treaties is defined by reference to [[Domicile (law)|domicile]] as opposed to [[tax residence]].  Such treaties specify what persons and property are subject to tax by each country upon transfer of the property by inheritance or gift.  Some treaties specify which party bears the burden of such tax, but often such determination relies on local law (which may differ from country to country).

Most inheritance tax treaties permit each country to tax domiciliaries of the other country on real property situated in the taxing country, property forming a part of a trade or business in the taxing country, tangible movable property situated in the taxing country at the time of transfer (often excluding ships and aircraft operated internationally), and certain other items.  Most treaties permit the estate or donor to claim certain deductions, exemptions, or credits in calculating the tax that might not otherwise be allowed to non-domiciliaries.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the U.S./France treaty, supra, containing all of these features.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Double tax relief==
Nearly all tax treaties provide a specific mechanism for eliminating it, but the risk of [[double taxation]] is still potentially present.  This mechanism usually requires that each country grant a credit for the taxes of the other country to reduce the taxes of a resident of the country.  The treaty may or may not provide mechanisms for limiting this credit, and may or may not limit the application of local law mechanisms to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;All of the treaties cited above feature the credit mechanism.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutual enforcement==
Taxpayers may relocate themselves and their assets to avoid paying taxes.  Some treaties thus require each treaty country to assist the other in collection of taxes, to counter the [[Rule against foreign revenue enforcement|revenue rule]], and other enforcement of their tax rules.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the Canada/U.S. 2007 [http://www.treas.gov/offices/tax-policy/library/CanadaProtocol07.pdf Protocol] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302091956/http://www.treas.gov/offices/tax-policy/library/CanadaProtocol07.pdf |date=2010-03-02 }} Article 22, amending Treaty Article XXVI A, Assistance in Collection.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most tax treaties include, at a minimum, a requirement that the countries exchange of information needed to foster enforcement.&lt;ref name="See" /&gt;

==Tax information exchange agreement==
{{main|Tax information exchange agreements}}
The purpose of this agreement is to promote international co-operation in tax matters through exchange of information.  It was developed by the [[OECD]] Global Forum Working Group on Effective Exchange of Information. 

The working group consisted of representatives from OECD Member countries as well as delegates from [[Aruba]], [[Bermuda]], [[Bahrain]], [[Cayman Islands]], [[Cyprus]], [[Isle of Man]], [[Malta]], [[Mauritius]], [[the Netherlands Antilles]], the [[Seychelles]] and [[San Marino]].

The agreement grew out of the work undertaken by the OECD to address harmful tax practices. The lack of effective exchange of information is one of the key criteria in determining harmful tax practices. The mandate of the working group was to develop a legal instrument that could be used to establish effective exchange of information. 

The agreement represents the standard of effective exchange of information for the purposes of the OECD’s initiative on harmful tax practices. This agreement, which was released in April 2002, is not a binding instrument but contains two models for bilateral agreements.  A number of bilateral agreements have been based on this agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/7/0,3746,en_2649_33767_38312839_1_1_1_1,00.html|title=Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) - OECD|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dispute resolution==
Nearly all tax treaties provide some mechanism under which taxpayers and the countries can resolve disputes arising under the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;The OECD model, supra, Article 25 contains typical language.&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, the government agency responsible for conducting dispute resolution procedures under the treaty is referred to as the “competent authority” of the country.  Competent authorities generally have the power to bind their government in specific cases.  The treaty mechanism often calls for the competent authorities to attempt to agree in resolving disputes.

==Limitations on benefits==
Recent treaties of certain countries have contained an article intended to prevent "treaty shopping," which is the inappropriate use of tax treaties by residents of third states.  These limitation on benefits articles deny the benefits of the tax treaty to residents that do not meet additional tests.  Limitation on Benefits articles vary widely from treaty to treaty, and are often quite complex.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the Canada/U.S. 2007 protocol, supra, article 25, as an example of complexity.&lt;/ref&gt;  The treaties of some countries, such as the United Kingdom and Italy, focus on subjective purpose for a particular transaction, denying benefits where the transaction was entered into in order to obtain benefits under the treaty.  Other countries, such as the United States, focus on the objective characteristics of the party seeking benefits. Generally, individuals and publicly traded companies and their subsidiaries are not adversely impacted by the provisions of a typical limitation of benefits provision in a U.S. tax treaty.  With respect to other entities, the provisions tend to deny benefits where an entity seeking benefits is not sufficiently owned by residents of one of the treaty countries (or, in the case of treaties with members of a unified economic bloc such as the European Union or NAFTA, by "equivalent beneficiaries" in the same group of countries).&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., The United States Model Tax Convention, supra, article 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even where entities are not owned by qualified residents, however, benefits are often available for income earned from the active conduct of a trade or business.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Priority of law==
Treaties are considered the supreme law of many countries.  In those countries, treaty provisions fully override conflicting [[municipal law|domestic law]] provisions.  For example, many EU countries could not enforce their group relief schemes under the [[Directive (European Union)|EU directives]].  In some countries, treaties are considered of equal weight to domestic law.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the [http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi U.S. Constitution], article VI.&lt;/ref&gt;  In those countries, a conflict between domestic law and the treaty must be resolved under the dispute resolution mechanisms of either domestic law or the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Switzerland had agreed with the United States to turn over certain bank records, but the agreement was held by Swiss courts to violate Swiss law.  The Swiss administration referred the matter to the Swiss Parliament for resolution. See, e.g., [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/27/ubsirs-deal-court-ruling-_n_439558.html CNN coverage].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tu{{okina}}i Tonga Empire''', or '''Tongan Empire''', are descriptions sometimes given to [[Tonga|Tongan]] expansionism and projected hegemony in [[Oceania]] which began around 950 CE, reaching its peak during the period 1200–1500.

It was centred in Tonga on the island of [[Tongatapu]], with its capital at [[Mu'a (Tongatapu)|Mu{{okina}}a]]. Modern researchers and cultural experts attest to widespread Tongan influence, evidence of transoceanic trade and exchange of material and non-material cultural artefacts.

==History==

===Beginning of Tongan expansionism===
In 950 AD, Tu'i Tonga 'Aho'eitu started to expand his rule outside of Tonga. According to leading Tongan scholars, including Okusitino Mahina, the Tongan and Samoan oral traditions indicate that the first Tu'i Tonga was the son of their god [[Tangaloa (Tongan mythology)|Tangaloa]].&lt;ref&gt;see writings of Ata of Kolovai in "O Tama a Aiga" by Morgan Tuimaleali'ifano; writings by Mahina, also coronation edition of Spasifik Magazine, "The Pacific Islands: An Encyclopedia," edited by Lal and Fortune, p. 133etc.&lt;/ref&gt; As the ancestral homeland of the Tu'i Tonga dynasty and the abode of deities such as Tagaloa 'Eitumatupu'a, Tonga Fusifonua, and Tavatavaimanuka, the Manu'a islands of Samoa were considered sacred by the early Tongan kings.&lt;ref name="The Pacific Islands p. 133"&gt;"The Pacific Islands: An Encyclopedia," edited by Lal and Fortune, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; By the time it comes to the 10th Tu’i Tonga Momo, and his successor, ‘Tu’itatui, the empire had already stretched from Tikopia in the west {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} to Niue in the east. Their realm contained [[Wallis and Futuna]], [[Tokelau]], [[Tuvalu]], [[Rotuma]], [[Nauru]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}, parts of [[Fiji]], [[Marquesas]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}, parts of the [[Solomon Islands]], Kiribati{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}, [[Niue]], [[Cook Islands]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}, and parts of [[Samoa]]. To better govern the large territory, the Tu’i Tongas had their throne moved by the lagoon at Lapaha, Tongatapu. The influence of the Tu’i Tonga was renowned throughout the Pacific, and many of the neighboring islands participated in the widespread trade of resources and new ideas.

===Expansion (1200–1500)===
Under the 10th Tu{{okina}}i Tonga, [[Momo (Tonga)|Momo]] and his son Tu{{okina}}itātui (11th Tu{{okina}}i Tonga) the empire was at its height of expansion, tributes for the Tu'i Tonga were said to be exacted from all tributary chiefdoms of the empire. This tribute was known as the " 'Inasi " and was conducted annually at Mu'a following the harvest season when all countries that were subject to the Tu'i Tonga must bring a gift for the gods, who was recognized as the Tu'i Tonga.&lt;ref name="St. Cartmail"&gt;{{cite book|last=St. Cartmail|first=Keith|title=The art of Tonga|year=1997|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu, Hawai'i|isbn=0-8248-1972-1|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Cook witnessed an Inasi ceremony in 1777, in which he noticed a lot of foreigners in Tonga, especially the darker people that resembles African descend from Fiji, Solomon Islands {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} and Vanuatu {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}. The finest mats of Samoa ('ie &lt;!-- sic! not i.e. --&gt; toga) are incorrectly translated as "Tongan mats;" the correct meaning is "treasured cloth" ("ie" = cloth, "toga" = female goods, in opposition to "oloa" = male goods).&lt;ref&gt;the Tongan linguistic analogue is "to'onga," see http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=535267&amp;coltype=pacific%20cultures&amp;regno=fe011574&lt;/ref&gt; Many fine mats came into the possession of the Tongan royal families through chiefly marriages with Samoan noblewomen, such as Tohu'ia the mother of Tu'i Kanokupolu Ngata who came from Safata, 'Upolu, Samoa. These mats, including the Maneafaingaa and Tasiaeafe, are considered the crown jewels of the current Tupou line&lt;ref&gt;Kie Hingoa 'Named Mats, 'Ie Toga 'Fine Mats' and Other Treasured Textiles of Samoa and Tonga. Journal of the Polynesian Society, Special Issue 108(2), June 1999&lt;/ref&gt; (which is derived matrilineally from Samoa).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;see Songs and Poems of Queen Salote edited by [[Elizabeth Wood-Ellem]]&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the Empire was largely based upon the Imperial Navy.  The most common vessels were long-distance double-canoes fitted with triangular sails. The largest canoes of the Tongan kalia type could carry up to 100 men. The most notable of these were the ''Tongafuesia'', ''{{okina}}Ākiheuho'', the ''Lomipeau'', and the ''Taka{{okina}}ipōmana''. It should be mentioned that the Taka{{okina}}ipōmana was actually a Samoan kalia; according to Queen Salote and the Palace Records this was the Samoan double-canoe that brought Tohu'ia Limapō from Samoa to wed the Tu'i Ha'atakalaua.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  The large navy allowed for Tonga to become wealthy with large amounts of trade and tribute flowing into the Royal Treasury{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}.

===Decline of Tu{{okina}}i Tonga and two new dynasties===
The Tu{{okina}}i Tonga decline began due to numerous wars and internal pressure. In the 13th or 14th century Sāmoa defeated Tu'i Tonga Talakaifaiki under the lead of the [[Malietoa]] family. In response the falefā was created as [[political advisor]]s to the Empire. The falefā officials were initially successful in maintaining some hegemony over other subjected islands but increased dissatisfaction led to the assassination of several rulers in succession. The most notable were, Havea I (19th TT), Havea II (22nd TT), and Takalaua (23rd TT), who were all known for their [[tyrannical]] rule. In AD 1535, Takalaua was assassinated by two foreigners while swimming in the lagoon of [[Mu'a (Tongatapu)|Mu'a]]. His successor, Kau{{okina}}ulufonua I pursued the killers all the way to [[Uvea (Wallis and Futuna)|{{okina}}Uvea]], where he killed them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/2842790|journal=The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|title=Note Upon the Natives of Savage Island, or Niue|last=Thomson|first=Basil|volume=31|date=January 1901|page=137|publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of so many assassination attempts on the Tu'i Tonga, Kau{{okina}}ulufonua established a new dynasty called Tu'i Ha'atakalaua in honor of his father and he gave his brother Mo’ungamotu’a, the title of Tu’i Ha’a Takalaua. This new dynasty was to deal with the everyday decisions of the empire, while the position of Tu’i Tonga was to be the nation’s spiritual leader, though he still controlled the final say in the life or death of his people. The Tu'i Tonga "empire" at this period becomes Samoan in orientation as the Tu'i Tonga kings themselves became ethnic Samoans who married Samoan women and resided in Samoa.&lt;ref&gt;"The Pacific Islands: An Encyclopedia," edited by Lal and Fortune, p. 133; {{cite journal|last1=Gunson|first1=Niel|title=Great Families of Polynesia: Inter-island Links and Marriage Patterns|journal=Journal of Pacific History|date=1997|volume=32|issue=2|pages=139–179|doi=10.1080/00223349708572835|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00223349708572835}}; "Tongan Society," Edward Gifford; "Tongan Society at the Time of Captain Cook's Visits," Queen Salote, Bott and Tavi&lt;/ref&gt; Kau'ulufonua's mother was a Samoan from Manu'a,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunson|first1=Niel|title=Great Families of Polynesia: Inter-island Links and Marriage Patterns|journal=Journal of Pacific History|date=1997|volume=32|issue=2|pages=139–179|doi=10.1080/00223349708572835|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00223349708572835}}; also "Deconstructing the Island Group," Australian National University&lt;/ref&gt; Tu'i Tonga Kau'ulufonua II and Tu'i Tonga Puipuifatu had Samoan mothers and as they married Samoan women the succeeding Tu'i Tongas - Vakafuhu, Tapu'osi, and 'Uluakimata - were allegedly more "Samoan" than "Tongan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunson|first1=Niel|title=Great Families of Polynesia: Inter-island Links and Marriage Patterns|journal=Journal of Pacific History|date=1997|volume=32|issue=2|pages=139–179|doi=10.1080/00223349708572835|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00223349708572835}}; "Tongan Society," Edward Gifford; "Tongan Society at the Time of Captain Cook's Visits," Queen Salote, Bott and Tavi&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1610, the 6th Tu’i Ha’a Takalaua, Mo'ungatonga, created the position of Tu’i Kanokupolu for his half-Samoan son, Ngata, which divided regional rule between them, though as time went on the Tu’i Kanokupolu’s power became more and more dominant over Tonga. The Tu'i Kanokupolu dynasty oversaw the importation and institution of many Samoan policies and titles and according to Tongan scholars this Samoanized form of government and custom continues today in the modern Kingdom of Tonga &lt;ref&gt;see {{cite web |url=http://planet-tonga.com/language_journal/Emancipation_in_Tonga/index.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060305174550/http://planet-tonga.com/language_journal/Emancipation_in_Tonga/index.shtml |archivedate=2006-03-05 |df= }} History of Tonga; 'Okusitino Mahina 2004; and journal articles&lt;/ref&gt; Things continued this way for a long time afterward. The first Europeans arrived in 1616, when the Dutch explorers Willem Schouten and Jacob Le Maire spotted Tongans in a canoe off the coast of Niuatoputapu, and the famous Abel Tasman followed soon after. These visits were brief, however, and did not change the island much at all.

The dividing line between the two moieties was the old coastal road named ''Hala Fonua moa'' (dry land road). Still today the chiefs who derive their authority from the Tu{{okina}}i Tonga are named the '''Kau hala {{okina}}uta''' (inland road people) while those from the Tu{{okina}}i Kanokupolu are known as the '''Kau hala lalo''' (low road people). Concerning the Tu{{okina}}i Ha{{okina}}atakalaua supporters: when this division arose, in the 15th century, they were of course the Kauhalalalo. But when the Tu{{okina}}i Kanokupolu had overtaken them they shifted their allegiance to the Kauhala{{okina}}uta.

"'''We Are the Heroes'''" is a song by Belarusian-Italian band [[Litesound]]. It represented [[Belarus in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012|Belarus]] in the second semi-final of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.eurovision.tv/page/baku-2012/about/shows/participants | publisher = Eurovision.tv | title = Eurovision Song Contest 2012 Semi-Finals | accessdate = 20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was performed for the first time by Litesound on 21 December 2011, during the semi-final of the [[Belarus in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012|Eurofest 2012]], the national selection for the Belarusian entry to the Eurovision Song Contest 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/17982  |publisher = ESCToday.com | accessdate = 29 February 2012 | title = Belarus: EuroFest final to be held on January 28th | date = 18 December 2011 | author = Victor Hondal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the final of the show, Litesound came in second place behind [[Alyona Lanskaya]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=46293&amp;_t=alyona_lanskaya_to_represent_belarus  |publisher = Eurovision.tv | accessdate = 29 February 2012 | title = Alyona Lanskaya to represent Belarus | date = 14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they were later chosen to replace Lanskaya following an investigation about a fraud in the televote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovisionary.com/eurovision-news/alena-lanskaya-will-not-be-going-baku-litesound-represent-belarus-instead |title=Alena Lanskaya will not be going to Baku - Litesound to represent Belarus instead &amp;#124; Eurovision Song Contest 2012 in Baku |publisher=EuroVisionary |date= |accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was re-recorded in a new version, produced by [[Dimitris Kontopoulos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/18542 | publisher = ESCToday.com | accessdate = 7 May 2012 | title = Belarus: Eurovision version for We are the heroes out | author = Victor Hondal | date = 18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The music video for the song was directed by Litesound's members Dmitri and Vladimir Karjakin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.radiobelarus.tvr.by/eng/news.asp?type=cont&amp;id=25638&amp;date=13.4.2012 | publisher = [[Radio Station Belarus]] | accessdate = 20 May 2012 | title = Belteleradiocompany continues preparations for the Eurovision-2012 | date = 13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an interview, Dmitriy Karyakin explained that the song "says that if we all believe in and go to our goal, then we will achieve it, despite all the difficulties. Only faith can help us. And if we are all together, it will also save us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://ann.az/en/?p=33726 | publisher = Ann.az | accessdate = 20 May 2012 | title = Belarus’s Eurovision-2012 entry: Why not Azerbaijan as favorite? | date = 7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was performed in the second semi-final finishing 16th of 18 entrants and failed to reach the Eurovision grand final.
