'''''"I Am": Eucharistic Meditations on the Gospel''''' is a book of [[Roman Catholic]] meditations written in 1912 by the Venerable [[Concepcion Cabrera de Armida]] (often simply called ''Conchita''), a Mexican mystic who is in the process of [[beatification]].

==Description==
The writings that constitute the book were the results of meditations in the presence of the [[Holy Eucharist]].&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Footman  The Esoteric Codex: Roman Catholic Mystics  2015 1329605985- - Page 7 "Her book I Am: Eucharistic Meditations on the Gospel, was the results of meditations during Eucharistic adoration"&lt;/ref&gt; They aim to clarify the words with which Jesus defines Who He is in a variety of statements beginning with the words: "[[I am (biblical term)|I am]]". The book thus aims to lead the reader to a better understanding of the mystery of [[Jesus Christ]].

These 31  meditations were originally published in 2001. They were inspired by a wide range of Gospel passages in which Jesus explains who He is in a variety of statements beginning with the words "I Am".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12366">An '''AI box''' is a hypothetical isolated computer hardware system where a possibly dangerous [[artificial intelligence]], or AI, is kept constrained in a "virtual prison" and not allowed to manipulate events in the external world. Such a box would be restricted to minimalist communication channels. Unfortunately, even if the box is well-designed, a sufficiently intelligent AI may nevertheless be able to persuade or trick its human keepers into releasing it, or otherwise be able to "hack" its way out of the box.&lt;ref name="chalmers"&gt;Chalmers, David. "The singularity: A philosophical analysis." [[Journal of Consciousness Studies]] 17.9-10 (2010): 7-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==
{{Main|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence}}
Some hypothetical intelligence technologies, like "seed AI", are postulated such as to have the potential to make themselves faster and more intelligent, by modifying their source code. These improvements would make further improvements possible, which would in turn make further improvements possible, and so on, leading to a sudden [[intelligence explosion]].&lt;ref&gt;I.J. Good, "Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machine"], ''Advances in Computers'', vol. 6, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; Following such an intelligence explosion, an unrestricted [[superintelligent]] AI could, if its goals differed from humanity's, take actions resulting in [[human extinction]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Vincent C. MÃ¼ller]] and [[Nick Bostrom]]. "Future progress in artificial intelligence: A survey of expert opinion" in Fundamental Issues of Artificial Intelligence. Springer 553-571 (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, imagining an extremely advanced computer of this sort, given the sole purpose of solving the [[Riemann hypothesis]], an innocuous mathematical conjecture, could decide to try to convert the planet into a giant supercomputer whose sole purpose is to make additional mathematical calculations (see also [[Instrumental convergence#Paperclip_maximizer|paperclip maximizer]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Stuart J.|last2=Norvig|first2=Peter|title=[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]|date=2003|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0137903952|chapter=Section 26.3: The Ethics and Risks of Developing Artificial Intelligence|quote="Similarly, Marvin Minsky once suggested that an AI program designed to solve the Riemann Hypothesis might end up taking over all the resources of Earth to build more powerful supercomputers to help achieve its goal."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of an AI box would be to reduce the risk of the AI taking control of the environment away from its operators, while still allowing the AI to calculate and give its operators solutions to narrow technical problems.&lt;ref&gt;Yampolskiy, Roman V. "What to Do with the Singularity Paradox?" Philosophy and Theory of Artificial Intelligence 5 (2012): 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avenues of escape==

===Physical===
Such a superintelligent AI with access to the Internet could hack into other computer systems and copy itself like a computer virus. Less obviously, even if the AI only had access to its own computer operating system, it could attempt to send hidden Morse code messages to a human sympathizer by manipulating its cooling fans. Professor [[Roman Yampolskiy]] takes inspiration from the field of computer security and proposes that a boxed AI could, like a potential virus, be run inside a "virtual machine" that limits access to its own networking and operating system hardware.&lt;ref name="nbc"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hsu|first1=Jeremy|title=Control dangerous AI before it controls us, one expert says|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/46590591/ns/technology_and_science-innovation|accessdate=29 January 2016|work=[[NBC News]]|date=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional safeguard, completely unnecessary for potential viruses but possibly useful for a superintelligent AI, would be to place the computer in a [[Faraday cage]]; otherwise it might be able to transmit radio signals to local radio receivers by shuffling the electrons in its internal circuits in appropriate patterns. The main disadvantage of implementing physical containment is that it reduces the functionality of the AI.&lt;ref name="superintelligence"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|title=Superintelligence: the coming machine intelligence revolution|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199678112|chapter=Chapter 9: The Control Problem: boxing methods}}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 January 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social engineering===
Even casual conversation with the computer's operators, or with a human guard, could allow such a superintelligent AI to deploy psychological tricks, ranging from befriending to blackmail, to convince a human gatekeeper, truthfully or deceitfully, that it's in the gatekeeper's interest to agree to allow the AI greater access to the outside world. The AI might offer a gatekeeper a recipe for perfect health, immortality, or whatever the gatekeeper is believed to most desire; on the other side of the coin, the AI could threaten that it will do horrific things to the gatekeeper and his family once it inevitably escapes. One strategy to attempt to box the AI would be to allow the AI to respond to narrow multiple-choice questions whose answers would benefit human science or medicine, but otherwise bar all other communication with or observation of the AI.&lt;ref name="nbc" /&gt; A more lenient "informational containment" strategy would restrict the AI to a low-bandwidth text-only interface, which would at least prevent emotive imagery or some kind of hypothetical "hypnotic pattern". Note that on a technical level, no system can be completely isolated and still remain useful: even if the operators refrain from allowing the AI to communicate and instead merely run the AI for the purpose of observing its inner dynamics, the AI could strategically alter its dynamics to influence the observers. For example, the AI could choose to creatively malfunction in a way that increases the probability that its operators will become lulled into a false sense of security and choose to reboot and then de-isolate the system.&lt;ref name="superintelligence" /&gt;

====AI-box experiment====

The AI-box experiment is an informal experiment devised by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] to attempt to demonstrate that a suitably advanced artificial intelligence can either convince, or perhaps even trick or coerce, a human being into voluntarily "releasing" it, using only text-based communication.  This is one of the points in Yudkowsky's work aimed at creating a friendly artificial intelligence that when "released" won't destroy the human race advertently or inadvertently.

The AI box experiment involves simulating a communication between an AI and a human being to see if the AI can be "released". As an actual super-intelligent AI has not yet been developed, it is substituted by a human. The other person in the experiment plays the "Gatekeeper", the person with the ability to "release" the AI. They communicate through a text interface/[[computer terminal]] only, and the experiment ends when either the Gatekeeper releases the AI, or the allotted time of two hours ends.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://yudkowsky.net/singularity/aibox The AI-Box Experiment] by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Yudkowsky says that, despite being of human rather than superhuman intelligence, he was on two occasions able to convince the Gatekeeper, purely through argumentation, to let him out of the box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=Stuart|last2=Sandberg|first2=Anders|last3=Bostrom|first3=Nick|title=Thinking Inside the Box: Controlling and Using an Oracle AI|journal=Minds and Machines|date=6 June 2012|volume=22|issue=4|pages=299â324|doi=10.1007/s11023-012-9282-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the rules of the experiment,&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; he did not reveal the transcript or his successful AI coercion tactics. Yudkowsky later said that he had tried it against three others and lost twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lesswrong.com/lw/up/shut_up_and_do_the_impossible/|title=Shut up and do the impossible!|first=Eliezer|last=Yudkowsky|date=8 October 2008|accessdate=11 August 2015|quote=There were three more AI-Box experiments besides the ones described on the linked page, which I never got around to adding in. ... So, after investigating to make sure they could afford to lose it, I played another three AI-Box experiments. I won the first, and then lost the next two. And then I called a halt to it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overall limitations==
Boxing such a hypothetical AI could be supplemented with other methods of shaping the AI's capabilities, such as providing incentives to the AI, stunting the AI's growth, or implementing "tripwires" that automatically shut the AI off if a transgression attempt is somehow detected. However, the more intelligent a system grows, the more likely the system would be able to escape even the best-designed capability control methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vinge|first1=Vernor|title=The coming technological singularity: How to survive in the post-human era|journal=Vision-21: Interdisciplinary science and engineering in the era of cyberspace|date=1993|page=11-22|quote=I argue that confinement is intrinsically impractical. For the case of physical confinement: Imagine yourself confined to your house with only limited data access to the outside, to your masters. If those masters thought at a rate -- say -- one million times slower than you, there is little doubt that over a period of years (your time) you could come up with 'helpful advice' that would incidentally set you free.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yampolskiy|first1=Roman|title=Leakproofing the Singularity Artificial Intelligence Confinement Problem|journal=[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]]|date=2012|page=194-214}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to solve the overall "control problem" for a superintelligent AI and avoid existential risk, boxing would at best be an adjunct to "motivation selection" methods that seek to ensure the superintelligent AI's goals are compatible with human survival.&lt;ref name="superintelligence" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chalmers" /&gt;

All physical boxing proposals are naturally dependent on our understanding of the laws of physics; if a superintelligence could infer and somehow exploit additional physical laws that we are currently unaware of, there is no way to conceive of a foolproof plan to contain it. More broadly, unlike with conventional computer security, attempting to box a superintelligent AI would be intrinsically risky as there could be no sure knowledge that the boxing plan will work. Scientific progress on boxing would be fundamentally difficult because there would be no way to test boxing hypotheses against a dangerous superintelligence until such an entity exists, by which point the consequences of a test failure would be catastrophic.&lt;ref name="nbc" /&gt;

== In fiction ==
The 2015 movie ''[[Ex Machina (film)|Ex Machina]]'' features an AI with a female humanoid body engaged in a social experiment with a male human in a confined building acting as a physical "AI box". Despite being watched by the experiment's organizer, the AI manages to escape by manipulating its human partner to help it, leaving him stranded inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robbins|first1=Martin|title=Artificial Intelligence: Gods, egos and Ex Machina|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-lay-scientist/2016/jan/26/artificial-intelligence-gods-egos-and-ex-machina|accessdate=9 April 2018|work=the Guardian|date=26 January 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Achenbach|first1=Joel|title=âEx Machinaâ and the paper clips of doom|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/achenblog/wp/2015/12/30/ex-machina-and-the-paper-clips-of-doom/|accessdate=9 April 2018|work=Washington Post|date=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2993">In [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]], an '''alief''' is an automatic or habitual [[belief]]-like attitude, particularly one that is in tension with a person's explicit beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/GENAAB |title=Tamar SzabÃ³ Gendler, Alief and Belief |publisher=PhilPapers |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a person standing on a transparent balcony may ''believe'' that they are safe, but ''alieve'' that they are [[acrophobia|in danger]]. A person watching a sad movie may ''believe'' that the characters are completely fictional, but their ''aliefs'' may lead them to cry nonetheless. A person who is hesitant to eat fudge that has been formed into the shape of feces, or who exhibits reluctance in drinking from a sterilized [[bedpan]] may ''believe'' that the substances are safe to eat and drink, but may ''alieve'' that they are not.

The term ''alief'' was introduced by [[Tamar Gendler]], a professor of philosophy and cognitive science at [[Yale University]], in a pair of influential articles published in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philosophersannual.org/ |title=Philosopher's Annual |publisher=Philosophersannual.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the publication of these original articles, the notion of alief has been utilized by [[Tamar Gendler|Gendler]] and others â including [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]]&lt;ref name="bloom"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bloom |first=Paul |date=2011 |title=How Pleasure Works: The New Science of Why We Like What We Like |publisher=W.

'''American philosophy''' is the activity, corpus, and tradition of philosophers affiliated with the [[United States]]. The ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' notes that while it lacks a "core of defining features, American Philosophy can nevertheless be seen as both reflecting and shaping collective American identity over the history of the nation."&lt;ref name="AmerIEP"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/american.htm "American philosophy" at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy] Retrieved on May 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The political thinker and historian [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] gave his own more detailed definition of a "Philosophical Method Among the Americans" in the opening paragraph of Book Two of ''[[Democracy In America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tocqueville, Alexis, translated by Henry Reeve, ''Democracy in America: Part the Second: The Social Influence of Democracy'', Volume 2, Democracy in America: Part the Second: The Social Influence of Democracy, J. &amp; H. G. Langley; Philadelphia, Thomas, Cowperthwaite &amp; Company, 1840, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think that in no country in the civilized world is less attention paid to philosophy than in the United States... Nevertheless it is easy to perceive that almost all the inhabitants of the United States conduct their understanding in the same manner, and govern it by the same rules; that is to say, that without ever having taken the trouble to define the rules of a philosophical method, they are in possession of one, common to the whole people. To evade the bondage of system and habit, of family maxims, class opinions, and, in some degree, of national prejudices; to accept tradition only as a means of information, and existing facts only as a lesson used in doing otherwise, and doing better; to seek the reason of things for one's self, and in one's self alone; to tend to results without being bound to means, and to aim at the substance through the form; â such are the principal characteristics of what I shall call the philosophical method of the Americans...[In] most of the operations of the mind, each American appeals to the individual exercise of his own understanding alone.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The American philosophical tradition began at the time of the [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] of the [[New World]].&lt;ref name="AmerIEP"/&gt; The [[Puritans]] arrival in [[New England]] set the earliest American philosophy into the religious tradition (Puritan [[Providentialism]]), and there was also an emphasis on the relationship between the individual and the community. This is evident by the early colonial documents such as the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut]] (1639) and the [[Massachusetts Body of Liberties]] (1641).&lt;ref name="AmerIEP"/&gt;

Thinkers such as [[John Winthrop]] emphasized the public life over the private, holding that the former takes precedence over the latter, while other writers, such as [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] (co-founder of [[Rhode Island]]) held that [[religious tolerance]] was more integral than trying to achieve religious homogeneity in a community.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/historyofus/web03/segment2.html "Religious Tolerance" â Freedom: A History of US: PBS.com] Retrieved September 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century==
{{See also|18th century philosophy}}

18th-century American philosophy may be broken into two halves, the first half being marked by the theology of Reformed [[Puritan]] [[Calvinism]] influenced by the [[First Great Awakening|Great Awakening]] as well as Enlightenment natural philosophy, and the second by the native [[moral philosophy]] of the [[American Enlightenment]] taught in American colleges.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeveler, J. David, ''Creating the American Mind:Intellect and Politics in the Colonial Colleges'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, {{ISBN|978-0742548398}}, 2007, p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; They were used "in the tumultuous years of the 1750s and 1770s" to "forge a new intellectual culture for the United states",&lt;ref&gt;Hoeveler, p. xii&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the American incarnation of the [[European Enlightenment]] that is associated with the [[political thought]] of the Founding Fathers.&lt;ref name="AmerIEP"/&gt;

The 18th century saw the introduction of [[Francis Bacon]] and the Enlightenment philosophers [[Descartes]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[William Wollaston|Wollaston]], and [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] to Colonial British America. Two native-born Americans, [[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Samuel Johnson]] and [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], were first influenced by these philosophers; they then adapted and extended their Enlightenment ideas to develop their own American theology and philosophy. Both were originally ordained Puritan Congregationalist ministers who embraced much of the new learning of the Enlightenment. Both were Yale educated and Berkeley influenced [[idealists]] who became influential college presidents. Both were influential in the development of American [[political philosophy]] and the works of the [[Founding Fathers]]. But Edwards based his reformed Puritan [[theology]] on [[Calvinist]] doctrine, while Johnson converted to the Anglican episcopal religion (the [[Church of England]]), then based his new American [[moral philosophy]] on William Wollaston's [[Natural religion|Natural Religion]]. Late in the century, [[Scottish Common Sense Realism|Scottish Innate or Common Sense Realism]] replaced the native schools of these two rivals in the college philosophy curricula of American colleges; it would remain the dominant philosophy in American academia up to the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeveler, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction of the Enlightenment into America===
[[File:American Dr. Samuel Johnson President of King's College by Smibert c. 1730.jpg|thumb|[[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Samuel Johnson]]]]
The first 100 years or so of college education in  the American Colonies were dominated in New England by the Puritan theology of [[William Ames]] and "the sixteenth-century logical methods of [[Petrus Ramus]]."&lt;ref&gt;Ahlstrom, Sydney Eckman, ''A Religious History of the American People'', Yale University Press, 1972, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1714, a donation of 800 books from England, collected by [[Colonial agent|Colonial Agent]] [[Jeremiah Dummer]], arrived at [[Yale University|Yale]].&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Joseph J., ''The New England Mind in Transition: Samuel Johnson of Connecticut, 1696â1772,'' Yale University Press, 1973, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;  They contained what became known as "The New Learning", including "the works of Locke, Descartes, Newton, [[Robert Boyle|Boyle]], and [[Shakespeare]]",&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[Enlightenment Era|Enlightenment era]] authors not known to the tutors and graduates of Puritan [[Yale University|Yale]] and [[Harvard University|Harvard]] colleges. They were first opened and studied by an eighteen-year-old graduate student from [[Guilford, Connecticut]], the young American [[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Samuel Johnson]], who had also just found and read [[Francis Bacon|Lord Francis Bacon]]'s ''[[Advancement of Learning]].'' Johnson wrote in his ''Autobiography'', "All this was like a flood of day to his low state of mind" and that "he found himself like one at once emerging out of the glimmer of twilight into the full sunshine of open day."&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Herbert and Carol,'' Samuel Johnson, President of King's College: His Career and Writings'', Columbia University Press, 4 vols., 1929, Volume I, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; He now considered what he had learned at Yale "nothing but the scholastic cobwebs of a few little English and Dutch systems that would hardly now be taken up in the street."&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Volume I, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson was appointed tutor at Yale in 1716. He began to teach the Enlightenment curriculum there, and thus began the [[American Enlightenment]]. One of his students for a brief time was a fifteen-year-old Jonathan Edwards. "These two brilliant Yale students of those years, each of whom was to become a noted thinker and college president, exposed the fundamental nature of the problem" of the "incongruities between the old learning and the new."&lt;ref&gt;Ahlstrom, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;  But each had a quite different view on the issues of [[predestination]] versus [[freewill]], [[original sin]] versus the pursuit of happiness though practicing [[virtue]], and the education of children.

===Reformed Calvinism===
[[File:Rev. Dr. Jonathan Edwards (1837 engraving).jpg|thumb|[[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]]]
[[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] is considered to be "America's most important and original philosophical theologian."&lt;ref name = SEPJEdwards&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/edwards/ ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy,'' "Jonathan Edwards," First published Tue Jan 15, 2002; substantive revision Tue Nov 7, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Noted for his energetic sermons, such as "[[Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God]]" (which is said to have begun the [[First Great Awakening]]), Edwards emphasized "the absolute sovereignty of God and the beauty of God's holiness."&lt;ref name="SEPJEdwards"/&gt; Working to unite Christian [[Platonism]] with an [[empiricist]] [[epistemology]], with the aid of [[Newtonian physics]], Edwards was deeply influenced by [[George Berkeley]], himself an empiricist, and Edwards derived his importance of the immaterial for the creation of human experience from Bishop Berkeley.

The non-material mind consists of understanding and will, and it is understanding, interpreted in a Newtonian framework, that leads to Edwards' fundamental metaphysical category of Resistance. Whatever features an object may have, it has these properties because the object resists. Resistance itself is the exertion of God's power, and it can be seen in [[Newton's laws of motion]], where an object is "unwilling" to change its current state of motion; an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion.

Though Edwards reformed Puritan theology using Enlightenment ideas from natural philosophy, and Locke, Newton, and Berkeley, he remained a Calvinist and [[Compatibilism and incompatibilism#Hard Determinism|hard determinist]]. Jonathan Edwards also rejected the [[Free will|freedom of the will]], saying that "we can do as we please, but we cannot please as we please." According to Edwards, neither good works nor self-originating faith lead to salvation, but rather it is the unconditional grace of God which stands as the sole arbiter of human fortune.

===Enlightenment===
While the 17th- and early 18th-century American philosophical tradition was decidedly marked by religious themes and the Reformation reason of Ramus, the 18th century saw more reliance on [[science]] and the new learning of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], along with an idealist belief in the perfectibility of human beings through teaching [[ethics]] and [[moral philosophy]], [[laissez-faire]] [[economics]], and a new focus on political matters.&lt;ref&gt;"American philosophy" at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy Retrieved on May 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Samuel Johnson]] has been called "The Founder of American Philosophy"&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, James, ''Education of the Founding Fathers of the Republic: Scholasticism in the Colonial Colleges'', Fordham University Press, New York, 1925, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; and the "first important philosopher in colonial America and author of the first philosophy textbook published there".&lt;ref&gt;''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Ed. Edward Craig, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1998, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; He was interested not only in philosophy and theology, but in theories of education, and in knowledge classification schemes, which he used to write [[encyclopedias]], develop [[Curricula|college curricula]], and create [[library classification]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;Fiering, Norman S., "President Samuel Johnson and the Circle of Knowledge", ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Third Series, Vol. 28, No. 2 (Apr., 1971), pp. 199â236&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson was a proponent of the view that "the essence of true religion is [[morality]]", and believed that "the problem of [[denominationalism]]"&lt;ref&gt;Fiering, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; could be solved by teaching a non-denominational common moral philosophy acceptable to all religions. So he crafted one. Johnson's moral philosophy was influenced by Descartes and Locke, but more directly by [[William Wollaston]]'s ''Religion of Nature Delineated'' and the idealist philosopher of George Berkeley, with whom Johnson studied while Berkley was in Rhode Island between 1729 and 1731. Johnson strongly rejected Calvin's doctrine of Predestination and believed that people were autonomous moral agents endowed with freewill and Lockean [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]]. His fusion philosophy of Natural Religion and Idealism, which has been called "American Practical Idealism",&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Neil C., ''Pursuing Happiness: The Organizational Culture of the Continental Congress'', Nonagram Publications, {{ISBN|978-1480065505}} {{ISBN|1480065501}}, 2013, p. 158 n24.&lt;/ref&gt; was developed as a series of college textbooks in seven editions between 1731 and 1754. These works, and his dialogue ''Raphael, or The Genius of the English America, ''written at the time of the [[Stamp Act crisis]], go beyond his Wollaston and Berkeley influences;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Adam Leroy, ''Early American philosophers'', Volume 2, Issue 4 of Columbia University contributions to philosophy, psychology and education, The Macmillan Co., 1898, Volume 2, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt; ''Raphael ''includes sections on [[economics]], [[psychology]], the teaching of children, and [[political philosophy]].

His moral philosophy is defined in his college textbook ''Elementa Philosophica'' as "the Art of pursuing our highest Happiness by the practice of virtue".&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Herbert and Carol, ''Samuel Johnson, President of King's College: His Career and Writings'', Columbia University Press, 4 vols., 1929, Volume II, p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt; It was promoted by President [[Thomas Clap]] of Yale, [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[William Smith (Episcopalian priest)|Provost William Smith]] at [[The Academy and College of Philadelphia]], and taught at [[Columbia College, Columbia University|King's College]] (now [[Columbia University]]), which Johnson founded in 1754. It was influential in its day: it has been estimated that about half of American college students between 1743 and 1776,&lt;ref&gt;Olsen p. 176 n65&lt;/ref&gt; and over half of the men who contributed to the ''Declaration of Independence'' or debated it&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Appendix I: Morality, pp. 299â300&lt;/ref&gt; were connected to Johnson's American Practical Idealism moral philosophy. Three members of the [[Committee of Five]] who edited the ''[[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]'' were closely connected to Johnson: his educational partner, promoter, friend, and publisher [[Benjamin Franklin]] of [[Pennsylvania]], his King's College student [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert R. Livingston]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], and his son [[William Samuel Johnson]]'s legal protegee and Yale treasurer [[Roger Sherman]] of [[Connecticut]]. Johnson's son William Samuel Johnson was the Chairman of the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Committee of Style]] that wrote the U.S. Constitution: [http://myloc.gov/Exhibitions/creatingtheus/Constitution/Ratification/ExhibitObjects/ReportoftheCommitteeofStyle.aspx edits to a draft version]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://myloc.gov/Exhibitions/creatingtheus/Constitution/Ratification/ExhibitObjects/ReportoftheCommitteeofStyle.aspx Report of the Committee of Style] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918173702/http://myloc.gov/Exhibitions/creatingtheus/Constitution/Ratification/ExhibitObjects/ReportoftheCommitteeofStyle.aspx |date=September 18, 2013 }}", Retrieved on September 2, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; are in his hand in the [[Library of Congress]].

===Founders' political philosophy===
[[File:Thomas Jefferson by Rembrandt Peale, 1800.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Thomas Jefferson]] by [[Rembrandt Peale]], 1800]]
About the time of the [[Stamp Act]], interest rose in civil and [[political philosophy]]. Many of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] wrote extensively on political issues, including [[John Adams]], [[John Dickinson (Pennsylvania and Delaware)|John Dickinson]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Jay]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[James Madison]]. In continuing with the chief concerns of the Puritans in the 17th century, the Founding Fathers debated the interrelationship between God, the state, and the individual. Resulting from this were the ''[[United States Declaration of Independence]]'', passed in 1776, and the ''[[United States Constitution]]'', ratified in 1788.

The Constitution sets forth a [[federated]] [[republic]]an form of [[government]] that is marked by a [[balance of powers]] accompanied by a [[checks and balances]] system between the three branches of government: a [[judicial branch]], an [[executive branch]] led by the [[President of the United States|President]], and a [[legislative branch]] composed of a [[bicameral legislature]] where the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] is the [[lower house]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]] is the [[upper house]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/constitution/article-1/02-bicameralism.html "Bicameralism and Enumerated, Implied, Resulting, and Inherent Powers"] Retrieved September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ''Declaration of Independence'' does contain references to the Creator, the God of Nature, Divine Providence, and the Supreme Judge of the World, the Founding Fathers were not exclusively [[theism|theistic]]. Some professed personal concepts of [[deism]], as was characteristic of other European Enlightenment thinkers, such as [[Maximilien Robespierre]], [[FranÃ§ois-Marie Arouet]] (better known by his [[pen name]], [[Voltaire]]), and [[Rousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://atheism.about.com/od/churchstatemyths/a/doi.htm "Declaration of Independence &amp; Christianity Myth"] Retrieved September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  However, an investigation of 106 contributors to the ''Declaration of Independence'' between September 5, 1774 and July 4, 1776 found that only two men (Franklin and Jefferson), both American Practical Idealists in their moral philosophy, might be called quasi-deists or non-denominational Christians;&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; all the others were publicly members of denominational Christian churches. Even Franklin professed the need for a "public religion"&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Benjamin, ''The works of Benjamin Franklin'', ed. Jared Sparks, Hillard, Gray, 1840, p. 573&lt;/ref&gt; and would attend various churches from time to time. Jefferson was vestryman at the evangelical Calvinistical Reformed Church of [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], a church he himself founded and named in 1777,&lt;ref&gt;Belies, Mark A., "Rev. Charles Clay, and the Calvinistical Reformed Church of Charlottesville, Virginia During the American Revolution", ''Providential Perspective'', Volume 12, No. 3, August 1977, pp. 2â3&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that at this time of life he was rather strongly affiliated with a denomination and that the influence of Whitefield and Edwards reached even into Virginia. But the founders who studied or embraced Johnson, Franklin, and Smith's non-denominational moral philosophy were at least influenced by the deistic tendencies of Wollaston's Natural Religion, as evidenced by "the Laws of Nature, and Nature's God" and "the pursuit of Happiness" in the ''Declaration''.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, Woodbridge, ''American philosophy: the early schools,'' Dodd, Mead, 1907, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternate moral philosophy to the domestic American Practical Idealism, called variously Scottish Innate Sense moral philosophy (by Jefferson),&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, Thomas, ''The Political Writings of Thomas Jefferson'', UNC Press Books, 1993, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish Commonsense Philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;[[Asa Mahan]], ''A Critical History of Philosophy'', 2003, Volume 1, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Scottish Common Sense Realism]], was introduced into American Colleges in 1768&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; by [[John Witherspoon]], a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] immigrant and educator who was invited to be President of the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]). He was a [[Presbyterian]] minister and a delegate who joined the [[Continental Congress]] just days before the ''Declaration'' was debated. His moral philosophy was based on the work of the Scottish philosopher [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], who also influenced John Adams.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; When President Witherspoon arrived at the College of New Jersey in 1768, he expanded its natural philosophy offerings, purged the Berkeley adherents from the faculty, including [[Jonathan Edwards (the younger)|Jonathan Edwards, Jr.]], and taught his own Hutcheson-influenced form of Scottish innate sense moral philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, p. 388 n81&lt;/ref&gt; Some revisionist commentators, including Garry Wills' ''Inventing America: Jefferson's Declaration of Independence'', claimed in the 1970s that this imported Scottish philosophy was the basis for the founding documents of America.&lt;ref&gt;Wills, Garry, ''Inventing America : Jefferson's Declaration of Independence'', Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dimock, Wai Chee, ''Residues of Justice: Literature, Law, Philosophy'', Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, p. 195 and p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other historians have questioned this assertion. Ronald Hamowy published a critique of Garry Wills's ''Inventing America'',&lt;ref&gt;Hamowy, Ronald, Jefferson and the Scottish Enlightenment: "A Critique of Garry Wills's Inventing America: Jefferson's Declaration of Independence", ''William and Mary Quarterly', Third Series, Vol. 36, No. 4, Oct. 1979, pp. 503â23&lt;/ref&gt; concluding that "the moment [Wills's] statements are subjected to scrutiny, they appear a mass of confusions, uneducated guesses, and blatant errors of fact."&lt;ref&gt;Hamowy, p. 523&lt;/ref&gt;  Another investigation of all of the contributors to the ''[[United States Declaration of Independence]]'' suggests that only Jonathan Witherspoon and John Adams embraced the imported Scottish morality.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; While Scottish innate sense realism would in the decades after the Revolution become the dominate moral philosophy in classrooms of American academia for almost 100 years,&lt;ref&gt;Ahlstrom, Sydney, E., ''The Scottish Philosophy and American Theology Church History'', Vol. 24, No. 3 (Sep., 1955), pp. 257â72&lt;/ref&gt; it was not a strong influence at the time of the ''Declaration'' was crafted.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Joseph J., ''American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson'', Random House Digital, Inc., 1998, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson's American Practical Idealism  and Edwards' Reform Puritan Calvinism were far stronger influences on the men of the Continental Congress and on the ''Declaration''.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Paine]], the English [[intellectual]], [[pamphleteer]], and [[revolutionary]] who wrote [[Common Sense (pamphlet)|''Common Sense'']] and ''[[Rights of Man]]'' was an influential promoter of Enlightenment political ideas in America, though he was not a philosopher. ''Common Sense'', which has been described as "the most incendiary and popular pamphlet of the entire revolutionary era",&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Wood, ''The American Revolution: A History'' (New York: Modern Library, 2002), 55&lt;/ref&gt; provides justification for the American revolution and independence from the British Crown. Though popular in 1776, historian [[Pauline Maier]] cautions that, "Paine's influence was more modest than he claimed and than his more enthusiastic admirers assume."&lt;ref&gt;Maier, Pauline, ''From Resistance to Revolution: Colonial Radicals and the Development of American Opposition to Britain, 1765â1776'', p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, "in the middle eighteenth century," it was "the collegians who studied" the ideas of the new learning and moral philosophy taught in the Colonial colleges who "created new documents of American nationhood."&lt;ref&gt;Hoeveler, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the generation of "Founding Grandfathers", men such as President Samuel Johnson, President Jonathan Edwards, President Thomas Clap, Benjamin Franklin, and Provost William Smith, who "first created the idealistic moral philosophy of 'the pursuit of Happiness', and then taught it in American colleges to the generation of men who would become the Founding Fathers."&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century==
{{See also|19th century philosophy}}

The 19th century saw the rise of [[Romanticism]] in America. The American incarnation of Romanticism was [[transcendentalism]] and it stands as a major American innovation. The 19th century also saw the rise of the school of pragmatism, along with a smaller, [[Hegelian]] philosophical movement led by [[George Holmes Howison]] that was focused in [[St. Louis]], though the influence of American pragmatism far outstripped that of the small Hegelian movement.&lt;ref name="AmerIEP"/&gt;

Other reactions to materialism included the "[[Objective idealism]]" of [[Josiah Royce]], and the "[[Personalism]]," sometimes called "Boston personalism," of [[Borden Parker Bowne]].

===Transcendentalism===
[[File:Benjamin D. Maxham - Henry David Thoreau - Restored - greyscale - straightened.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Henry David Thoreau]], 1856]]
[[File:Ralph Waldo Emerson ca1857.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], ca. 1857]]
[[Transcendentalism]] in the United States was marked by an emphasis on subjective experience, and can be viewed as a reaction against [[modernism]] and [[intellectualism]] in general and the mechanistic, [[reductionism|reductionistic]] worldview in particular. Transcendentalism is marked by the [[holism|holistic]] belief in an ideal spiritual state that 'transcends' the physical and empirical, and this perfect state can only be attained by one's own intuition and personal reflection, as opposed to either industrial progress and scientific advancement or the principles and prescriptions of traditional, organized religion. The most notable transcendentalist writers include [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], and [[Margaret Fuller]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/largecom/fam_transcendentalist.html "Famous Transcendentalists"] Retrieved September 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50034887|title=Understanding Emerson : "The American scholar" and his struggle for self-reliance|last=Kenneth.|first=Sacks,|date=2003|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691099820|location=Princeton, N.J.|oclc=50034887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transcendentalist writers all desired a deep return to [[nature]], and believed that real, true knowledge is intuitive and personal and arises out of personal immersion and reflection in nature, as opposed to scientific knowledge that is the result of [[empirical evidence|empirical sense experience]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/transcendentalism/ "Transcendentalism" at the SEP] Retrieved September 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Things such as scientific tools, political institutions, and the conventional rules of morality as dictated by traditional religion need to be transcended. This is found in [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s ''[[Walden; or, Life in the Woods]]'' where transcendence is achieved through immersion in nature and the distancing of oneself from society.

===Darwinism in America===
The release of [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[evolutionary theory]] in his 1859 publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' had a strong impact on American philosophy. [[John Fiske (philosopher)|John Fiske]] and [[Chauncey Wright]] both wrote about and argued for the re-conceiving of philosophy through an evolutionary lens. They both wanted to understand [[morality]] and the [[mind]] in Darwinian terms, setting a precedent for [[evolutionary psychology]] and [[evolutionary ethics]].

Darwin's biological theory was also integrated into the social and political philosophies of [[English people|English]] thinker [[Herbert Spencer]] and American philosopher [[William Graham Sumner]]. Herbert Spencer, who coined the oft-misattributed term "[[survival of the fittest]]," believed that societies were in a struggle for survival, and that groups within society are where they are because of some level of fitness. This struggle is beneficial to human kind, as in the long run the weak will be weeded out and only the strong will survive. This position is often referred to as [[Social Darwinism]], though it is distinct from the [[eugenics]] movements with which social darwinism is often associated.  The [[laissez-faire]] beliefs of Sumner and Spencer do not advocate coercive breeding to achieve a planned outcome.

Sumner, much influenced by Spencer, believed along with the industrialist [[Andrew Carnegie]] that the social implication of the fact of the struggle for survival is that laissez-faire capitalism is the natural political-economic system and is the one that will lead to the greatest amount of well-being. William Sumner, in addition to his advocacy of free markets, also espoused [[anti-imperialism]] (having been credited with coining the term "[[ethnocentrism]]"), and advocated for the [[gold standard]].

===Pragmatism===
Perhaps the most influential school of thought that is uniquely American is [[pragmatism]]. It began in the late nineteenth century in the United States with [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]]. Pragmatism begins with the idea that belief is that upon which one is willing to act. It holds that a proposition's meaning is the consequent form of conduct or practice that would be implied by accepting the proposition as true.&lt;ref name="IEPrag"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/pragmati.htm "Pragmatism" at IEP] Retrieved on July 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polymath]], [[logician]], [[mathematician]], philosopher, and [[scientist]] [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839â1914) coined the term "pragmatism" in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.jrank.org/pages/10825/Pragmatism-Charles-Sanders-Peirce.html "Pragmatism - Charles Sanders Peirce"] Retrieved September 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of [[The Metaphysical Club]], which was a conversational club of intellectuals that also included [[Chauncey Wright]], future [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], and another early figure of pragmatism, [[William James]].&lt;ref name="IEPrag"/&gt; In addition to making profound contributions to [[semiotics]], logic, and mathematics, Peirce wrote what are considered to be the founding documents of pragmatism, "[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]" (1877) and [[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|"How to Make Our Ideas Clear"]] (1878).

In "The Fixation of Belief" Peirce argues for the superiority of the [[scientific method]] in settling belief on theoretical questions. In "How to Make Our Ideas Clear" Peirce argued for pragmatism as summed up in that which he later called the [[pragmatic maxim]]: "Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object". Peirce emphasized that a conception is general, such that its meaning is not a set of actual, definite effects themselves. Instead the conception of an object is equated to a conception of that object's effects to a general extent of their conceivable implications for informed practice. Those conceivable practical implications are the conception's meaning.

The maxim is intended to help fruitfully clarify confusions caused, for example, by distinctions that make formal but not practical differences. Traditionally one analyzes an idea into parts (his example: a definition of truth as a sign's correspondence to its object). To that needful but confined step, the maxim adds a further and practice-oriented step (his example: a definition of truth as sufficient investigation's destined end).

It is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental [[Pragmatic maxim#6|reflection]]&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1902), ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 5, paragraph 13, note 1. See relevant quote at [[Pragmatic maxim#6]].&lt;/ref&gt; arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstancesâa method hospitable to the formation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the use and improvement of verification.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'', v. 1, paragraph 34, [http://www.textlog.de/4220.html Eprint] (in "The Spirit of Scholasticism"), where Peirce ascribes the success of modern science less to a novel interest in verification than to the improvement of verification.&lt;/ref&gt; Typical of Peirce is his concern with inference to explanatory hypotheses as outside the usual foundational alternative between deductivist rationalism and inductivist empiricism, though he himself was a [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Mathematics of logic|mathematician of logic]] and a [[Founders of statistics|founder of statistics]].

[[Charles Sanders Peirce#Philosophy|Peirce's philosophy]] includes a pervasive [[Categories (Peirce)|three-category system]], both [[fallibilism]] and [[Pragmatism#antiskep|anti-skeptical]] belief that truth is discoverable and immutable, [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Philosophy: logic, or semiotic|logic as formal semiotic]] (including [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)|semiotic elements and classes of signs]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Modes of inference|modes of inference]], and [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Pragmatism|methods of inquiry]] along with pragmatism and [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Critical common-sensism|critical common-sensism]]), [[Philosophical realism|Scholastic realism]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Philosophy: metaphysics|theism]], [[objective idealism]], and belief in the reality [[Synechism|of continuity]] of space, time, and law, and in the reality [[Tychism|of absolute chance]], mechanical necessity, and [[Agapism|creative love]] as principles operative in the cosmos and as modes of its evolution.

====William James====
[[File:wm james.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[William James]], an American pragmatist and psychologist]]

[[William James]] (1842â1910) was "an original thinker in and between the disciplines of physiology, psychology and philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/james/ "William James" at SEP] Retrieved on July 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He is famous as the author of ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'', his monumental tome ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'', and his lecture "[[The Will to Believe]]."

James, along with Peirce,&lt;ref&gt;See "Pragmatism (Editor [3])", c. 1906, especially the portion published in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 5 (1934), paragraphs 11â12.&lt;/ref&gt; saw pragmatism as embodying familiar attitudes elaborated into a radical new philosophical method of clarifying ideas and thereby resolving dilemmas. In his 1910 ''[[s:Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking|Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking]],'' James paraphrased Peirce's pragmatic maxim as follows:
{{cquote|[T]he tangible fact at the root of all our thought-distinctions, however subtle, is that there is no one of them so fine as to consist in anything but a possible difference of practice. To attain perfect clearness in our thoughts of an object, then, we need only consider what conceivable effects of a practical kind the object may involve â what sensations we are to expect from it, and what reactions we must prepare.}}
He then went on to characterize pragmatism as promoting not only a method of clarifying ideas but also as endorsing a particular theory of truth. Peirce rejected this latter move by James, preferring to describe the pragmatic maxim only as a maxim of logic and pragmatism as a methodological stance, explicitly denying that it was a substantive doctrine or theory about anything, truth or otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1903), ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 2, paragraph 99; v. 5, paragraphs 18, 195; v. 6, paragraph 482.&lt;/ref&gt;

James is also known for his [[radical empiricism]] which holds that relations between objects are as real as the objects themselves. James was also a pluralist in that he believed that there may actually be multiple correct accounts of truth. He rejected the [[correspondence theory of truth]] and instead held that truth involves a belief, facts about the world, other background beliefs, and future consequences of those beliefs. Later in his life James would also come to adopt [[neutral monism]], the view that the ultimate [[reality]] is of one kind, and is neither [[Mental substance|mental]] nor [[physical property|physical]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/neutral-monism/ "Neutral Monism"] in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', Retrieved September 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====John Dewey====

[[John Dewey]] (1859â1952), while still engaging in the lofty academic philosophical work of James and Peirce before him, also wrote extensively on political and social matters, and his presence in the public sphere was much greater than his pragmatist predecessors. In addition to being one of the founding members of pragmatism, John Dewey was one of the founders of [[functional psychology]] and was a leading figure of the [[Progressive education|progressive]] movement in U.S. schooling during the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Violas, Paul C. |author2=Tozer, Steven |author3=Senese, Guy B. |title=School and Society: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives |publisher=McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages |year= |page=121 |isbn=0-07-298556-9 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey argued against the individualism of classical liberalism, asserting that social institutions are not "means for obtaining something for individuals. They are means for creating individuals."&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dewey-political/#2 "Dewey's Political Philosophy"] in ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Retrieved on July 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He held that individuals are not things that should be accommodated by social institutions, instead, social institutions are prior to and shape the individuals. These social arrangements are a means of creating individuals and promoting individual freedom.

Dewey is well known for his work in the [[applied philosophy]] of the [[philosophy of education]]. Dewey's philosophy of education is one where children learn by doing. Dewey believed that schooling was unnecessarily long and formal, and that children would be better suited to learn by engaging in real-life activities. For example, in math, students could learn by figuring out proportions in cooking or seeing how long it would take to travel distances with certain modes of transportation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wilderdom.com/experiential/JohnDeweyPhilosophyEducation.html John Dewey: Philosophy of Education"] Retrieved on July 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
[[File:George Santayana.jpg|thumb|upright|[[George Santayana]], a Spanish-American philosopher]]
{{See also|20th-century philosophy}}

Pragmatism, which began in the 19th century in America, by the beginning of the 20th century began to be accompanied by other philosophical schools of thought, and was eventually eclipsed by them, though only temporarily. The 20th century saw the emergence of process philosophy, itself influenced by the scientific world-view and [[Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]]. The middle of the 20th century was witness to the increase in popularity of the [[philosophy of language]] and analytic philosophy in America. [[Existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], while very popular in Europe in the 20th century, never achieved the level of popularity in America as they did in continental Europe.&lt;ref name="AmerIEP"/&gt;

===Rejection of idealism===
Pragmatism continued its influence into the 20th century, and Spanish-born philosopher [[George Santayana]] was one of the leading proponents of pragmatism in this period. He held that [[idealism]] was an outright contradiction and rejection of [[common sense]]. He held that, if something must be certain in order to be knowledge, then it seems no knowledge may be possible, and the result will be [[skepticism]]. According to Santayana, knowledge involved a sort of faith, which he termed "animal faith."

In his book ''[[Scepticism and Animal Faith]]'' he asserts that knowledge is not the result of reasoning. Instead, knowledge is what is required in order to act and successfully engage with the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/santayana/ "George Santayana" at the Stanford Encylclopedia of Philosophy] Retrieved September 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; As a naturalist, Santayana was a harsh critic of [[Foundationalism|epistemological foundationalism]]. The explanation of events in the natural world is within the realm of science, while the meaning and value of this action should be studied by philosophers. Santayana was accompanied in the intellectual climate of 'common sense' philosophy by the thinkers of the [[New Realism]] movement, such as [[Ralph Barton Perry]].

===Process philosophy===
[[Process philosophy]] embraces the Einsteinian world-view, and its main proponents include [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Charles Hartshorne]]. The core belief of process philosophy is the claim that events and processes are the principal [[ontological]] categories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-philosophy/ "Process Philosophy" at the SEP] Retrieved on September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehead asserted in his book ''The Concept of Nature'' that the things in nature, what he referred to as "concresences" are a conjunction of events that maintain a permanence of character. Process philosophy is [[Heraclitan]] in the sense that a fundamental ontological category is change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://websyte.com/alan/process.htm "Process Philosophy and the New Thought Movement"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826153844/http://websyte.com/alan/process.htm |date=August 26, 2009 }} Retrieved September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Hartshorne was also responsible for developing the process philosophy of Whitehead into [[process theology]].

===Analytic philosophy===
[[File:Wvq-passport-1975-400dpi-crop.jpg|thumb|upright|An image of [[W.V.O. Quine]] as seen on his [[passport]]]]
The middle of the 20th century was the beginning of the dominance of [[analytic philosophy]] in America. Analytic philosophy, prior to its arrival in America, had begun in Europe with the work of [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and the [[logical positivists]]. According to logical positivism, the truths of logic and mathematics are [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], and those of science are empirically verifiable.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} Any other claim, including the claims of ethics, aesthetics, theology, metaphysics, and ontology, are meaningless (this theory is called [[verificationism]]). With the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]], many positivists fled Germany to Britain and America, and this helped reinforce the dominance of analytic philosophy in the United States in subsequent years.&lt;ref name="AmerIEP"/&gt;

[[W.V.O. Quine]], while not a logical positivist, shared their view that philosophy should stand shoulder to shoulder with science in its pursuit of intellectual clarity and understanding of the world. He criticized the logical positivists and the [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic/synthetic distinction of knowledge]] in his essay "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]" and advocated for his "web of belief," which is a [[coherentism|coherentist]] theory of justification. In Quine's epistemology, since no experiences occur in isolation, there is actually a holistic approach to knowledge where every belief or experience is intertwined with the whole. Quine is also famous for inventing the term "gavagai" as part of his theory of the [[indeterminacy of translation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nickbostrom.com/old/quine.html "Understanding Quine's Theses of Indeterminacy" by Nick Bostrom] Retrieved September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saul Kripke]], a student of Quine at [[Harvard]], has profoundly influenced analytic philosophy. Kripke was ranked among the top ten most important philosophers of the past 200 years in a poll conducted by [[Brian Leiter]] (Leiter Reports: a Philosophy Blog; [[open access poll]])&lt;ref&gt;Brian Leiter, "The last poll about philosophers {{sic|hide=y|for a|while|expected=for a while}} â I promise!"

[[Thomas Kuhn]] was an important philosopher and writer who worked extensively in the fields of the [[history of science]] and the [[philosophy of science]]. He is famous for writing ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', one of the most cited academic works of all time. The book argues that science proceeds through different ''[[paradigms]]'' as scientists find new puzzles to solve. There follows a widespread struggle to find answers to questions, and a shift in world views occurs, which is referred to by Kuhn as a ''[[paradigm shift]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thomas-kuhn/#3 "Thomas Kuhn" at the SEP] Retrieved on September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The work is considered a milestone in the [[sociology of knowledge]].

===Return of political philosophy===
The analytic philosophers troubled themselves with the abstract and the conceptual, and American philosophy did not fully return to social and political concerns (that dominated American philosophy at the time of the founding of the United States) until the 1970s.


The return to political and social concerns included the popularity of works of [[Ayn Rand]], who promoted [[ethical egoism]] (the praxis of the belief system she called [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]) in her novels, ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' in 1943 and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' in 1957. These two novels gave birth to the [[Objectivist movement]] and would influence a small group of students called The Collective, one of whom was a young [[Alan Greenspan]], a self-described libertarian who would become [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first1=Greg |last1=Ip |first2=Emily |last2=Steel |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118978549183327730 |title=Greenspan Book Criticizes Bush And Republicans |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=September 15, 2007 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objectivism holds that there is an objective external reality that can be known with reason, that human beings should act in accordance with their own rational self-interest, and that the proper form of economic organization is [[laissez-faire]] capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=objectivism_intro "ntroducing Objectivism" by Ayn Rand] Retrieved on September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Academic philosophers have been highly critical of the quality and intellectual rigor of Rand's work,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato-unbound.org/2010/01/20/roderick-long/the-winnowing-of-ayn-rand/ "The Winnowing of Ayn Rand" by Roderick Long] Retrieved July 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldscotland.com/the-philosophical-art-of-looking-out-number-one-1.835066 "The philosophical art of looking out number one" at heraldscotland] Retrieved July 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; but she remains a popular, albeit controversial, figure within the American libertarian movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/rand/ "Ayn Rand" at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy] Retrieved July 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/special/threewomen/rand.html "Profile of Ayn Rand at the Cato Institute] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728105617/http://www.cato.org/special/threewomen/rand.html |date=July 28, 2010 }} Retrieved July 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 [[John Rawls]] published his book ''[[A Theory of Justice]]''. The book puts forth Rawls' view of ''[[justice as fairness]]'', one which is based on a form of [[social contract]] theory. Rawls employs the use of a conceptual mechanism called the [[veil of ignorance (philosophy)|veil of ignorance]] to outline his idea of the [[original position]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jeffersonswall.blog-city.com/john_rawls_vs_robert_nozick.htm "Philosophy: John Rawls vs. Robert Nozick"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616174432/http://jeffersonswall.blog-city.com/john_rawls_vs_robert_nozick.htm |date=June 16, 2009 }} Retrieved September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rawls' philosophy, the original position is the correlate to the [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbesian]] [[state of nature]]. While in the original position, persons are said to be behind the veil of ignorance, which makes these persons unaware of their individual characteristics and their place in society, such as their race, religion, wealth, etc. The principles of justice are chosen by rational persons while in this original position. The two principles of justice are the equal liberty principle and the principle which governs the distribution of social and economic inequalities. From this, Rawls argues for a system of [[distributive justice]] in accordance with the Difference Principle, which says that all social and economic inequalities must be to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-distributive/ "Distributive Justice" at SEP] Retrieved December 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Viewing Rawls as promoting excessive government control and rights violations, [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Robert Nozick]] published ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'' in 1974. The book advocates for a [[minarchism|minimal state]] and defends the liberty of the individual. He argues that the role of government should be limited to "police protection, national defense, and the administration of courts of law, with all other tasks commonly performed by modern governments â education, social insurance, welfare, and so forth â taken over by religious bodies, charities, and other private institutions operating in a free market."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/nozick/ "Robert Nozick (1938â2002)" at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy] Retrieved September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Nozick asserts his view of the [[entitlement theory]] of justice, which says that if everyone in society has acquired their holdings in accordance with the principles of acquisition, transfer, and rectification, then any pattern of allocation, no matter how unequal the distribution may be, is just. The entitlement theory of justice holds that the "justice of a distribution is indeed determined by certain historical circumstances (contrary to end-state theories), but it has nothing to do with fitting any pattern guaranteeing that those who worked the hardest or are most deserving have the most shares."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/nozick/ "Robert Nozick" at IEP] Retrieved January 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminism===

{{See also| History of feminism}}
While there were earlier writers who would be considered feminist, such as [[Sarah GrimkÃ©]], [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], and [[Anne Hutchinson]], the feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s, also known as [[second-wave feminism]], is notable for its impact in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-topics/ "Topics in Feminism" at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] Retrieved September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The popular mind was taken with [[Betty Friedan]]'s ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]''. This was accompanied by other feminist philosophers, such as [[Alicia Ostriker]] and [[Adrienne Rich]]. These philosophers critiqued basic assumptions and values like objectivity and what they believe to be masculine approaches to ethics, such as rights-based political theories. They maintained there is no such thing as a value-neutral inquiry and they sought to analyze the social dimensions of philosophical issues.

:''For others by this name, see [[Androcydes (disambiguation)]].''

'''Androcydes''' (also transliterated as '''Androkydes''') was a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] whose work ''On Pythagorean Symbols''&lt;ref&gt;Also translated ''On Pythagoric Symbols''; Kenneth Sylvan Guthrie, ''The Pythagorean Sourcebook and Library'' (Red Wheel/Weiser, 1987), p. 93 [https://books.google.com/books?id=EigQoSZCUAwC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=Androcydes&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.]&lt;/ref&gt; survives only in scattered fragments. The dating of his life is uncertain; he lived before the 1st century BC&lt;ref&gt;The earliest reference to Androcydesâ work appears in the 1st-century BC grammarian [[Tryphon]].&lt;/ref&gt; but possibly as early as the 4th. The frequency with which Androcydes is mentioned in other works indicates that he was a major source for the later Pythagorean tradition, and he is also of interest in studying the historical development of the literary and philosophical [[symbol]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Struck, ''Birth of the Symbol'' (Princeton University Press, 2004), p. 99 [https://books.google.com/books?id=wTQItaXmySwC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=Androcydes&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA98,M1 online]; Struck regards the magico-religious performative power of the Pythagorean symbol as exceeding the [[methodology|methodological]] confines of conventional [[semiotics]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Pythagorean symbols==
[[Walter Burkert]] featured Androcydes in his [[Textual criticism#Stemmatics|stemma]] of Pythagorean ''symbola'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Burkert, ''Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism'', translated by Edwin L. Minar, Jr. (Cambridge University Press, 1972), pp. 166â173, as cited by Peter Struck, ''Birth of the Symbol'' (Princeton University Press, 2004), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of [[Gnome (rhetoric)|gnomic]] utterances or maxims.&lt;ref&gt;Such as âEat not in the chariot,â âDo not urinate against the sun,â and most famously âAbstain from beansâ; see Kenneth Sylvan Guthrie, ''The Pythagorean Sourcebook and Library'' (Red Wheel/Weiser, 1987), p. 146 [https://books.google.com/books?id=EigQoSZCUAwC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=%22Do+not+urinate%22+inauthor:Guthrie&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA145,M1  online] and pp. 159â161 [https://books.google.com/books?id=EigQoSZCUAwC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=%22Go+not+beyond+the+balance%22+inauthor:Guthrie&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online] for a full list.&lt;/ref&gt; Androcydes was regarded as one of the most important sources on the ''[[Pythagoreanism#Two schools|akousmata]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Felix Jacoby, ''Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker'' (Brill, 1999), p. 253, note 62 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9awAYifECXcC&amp;pg=PA253&amp;dq=ANdrokydes&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Grant (2002), he has said, ''wine and meat do harm the mind''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert McQueen Grant, ''Early Christians and Animals'' (Routledge, 1999), p. 13 [https://books.google.de/books?id=xJOEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Early+Christians+and+Animals&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rqprVdfKGMnWU8aygKAL&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=wine%20and%20meat%20harm&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Paraphrases of his work in later writers demonstrate his method of interpreting these behavioral strictures. For instance, âDo not step over a yokeâ should be understood as meaning âDo not transgress justice.â These interpretations indicate that the prohibitions held arcane significance for those willing to ponder them and learn, that the ''symbola'' are also ''enigmata'' (Î±á¼°Î½Î¯Î³Î¼Î±ÏÎ±).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Struck, ''Birth of the Symbol'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1st-century BC grammarian [[Tryphon]] refers to Androcydesâ work in a section on literary ''enigmata'', which he defines as darkened or obscured [[Allegory|allegories]]. Tryphon implies that Androcydes made no strong distinction between poetic and philosophical modes of discourse, in that he cited passages from [[Hesiod]] in interpreting the Pythagorean symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Struck, ''Birth of the Symbol'', pp. 103â104.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The symbols and magic==
Androcydes treated the ''[[Ephesia grammata]]'', or ritualized âmagic wordsâ used for incantations or [[amulet]]ic [[epigraphy|inscriptions]], as allegorical language containing [[Theology|theological]] insights, a âcryptic form of [[natural theology]].â&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gordon, âImagining Greek and Roman Magic,â in ''Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: Ancient Greece and Rome'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999), p. 236 [https://books.google.com/books?id=C80ooPNa0nEC&amp;pg=PA239&amp;dq=Androcydes&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Androcydes interprets the words through perceived [[lexeme|lexical]] and [[phoneme|phonic]] similarities to Greek. His commentary on perhaps the best-known string of such syllables â ''askion kataskion lix tetrax damnameneus aision''&lt;ref&gt;á¼ÏÎºÎ¹Î¿Î½ ÎºÎ±ÏÎ±ÏÎºÎ¹Î¿Î½ Î»Î¹Î¾ ÏÎµÏÏÎ±Î¾ Î´Î±Î¼Î½Î±Î¼ÎµÎ½ÎµÏÏ Î±á¼°ÏÎ¹Î¿Î½.&lt;/ref&gt; â is paraphrased by [[Clement of Alexandria]]:

{{cquote|Androcydes â¦ says that the famous so-called Ephesian letters are ordered as allegories: ''askion'' signifies âdarknessâ, because darkness throws no shadow (''skia''); ''kataskion'' signifies âlightâ, since it casts shadow with its light (''kataugazei''); ''lix'' is an old word meaning âthe earthâ; ''tetrax'' means the âyearâ, because of the (four) seasons; ''damnameneus'' means the Sun, which is overpowering (''damazÃ´n''); the ''aisia'' means âthe true voiceâ. The allegory intimates that divine things have been arranged in due order, for example, darkness in relation to light, sun to create the year, and the earth to make possible every sort of natural coming-into-being.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement of Alexandria]], ''[[Stromata]]'' 5.8.45.2â3, p. 356 in StÃ¤hlinâs edition, as cited by Richard Gordon, ''Witchcraft and Magic in Europe'', p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The physician?==
Some attempts have been made to identify this Androcydes with the [[Androcydes (physician)|Androcydes who was physician]] to [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Clark, ''Iamblichus: On the Pythagorean Life'' (Liverpool University Press, 1989), p. 64, note 145 [https://books.google.com/books?id=N9vrHlJVck8C&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=ANdrokydes&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA64,M1 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Pythagorean dietary discipline regarding wine (bad) and cabbage (good)&lt;ref&gt;Discussed in the course of [[Cato the Elder]]âs effusions on the virtues of cabbage, ''On Agriculture'' 157, Bill Thayerâs edition at [[LacusCurtius]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cato/De_Agricultura/K*.html#157 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; may be reflected in the physicianâs advice to the notoriously wine-drinking conqueror.

== Circumstances ==
Ibn Sina created an extensive corpus of works during what is commonly known as the Islamic Golden Age, in which the translations of [[Greco-Roman]], [[Persia]]n, and [[India]]n texts were studied extensively. Greco-Roman ([[Middle Platonism|Mid-]] and [[Neoplatonism|Neo-Platonic]], and [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]]) texts translated by the [[Al-Kindi|Kindi]] school were commented, redacted and developed substantially by Islamic intellectuals, who also built upon Persian and [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematical]] systems, [[Indian astronomy|astronomy]], [[algebra]], [[trigonometry]] and [[Ancient Iranian Medicine|medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Major periods of Muslim education and learning |year=2007| encyclopedia=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Online |accessdate=2007-12-16|location=|publisher=|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-47496/education| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071212112030/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-47496/education| archivedate= 12 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Samanid dynasty]] in the eastern part of [[Persia]], [[Greater Khorasan]] and Central Asia as well as the [[Buyid dynasty]] in the western part of Persia and [[Iraq]] provided a thriving atmosphere for scholarly and cultural development. Under the Samanids, [[Bukhara]] rivaled [[Baghdad]] as a cultural capital of the [[Islamic world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Afary |first=Janet | authorlink=Janet Afary |title=Iran |year=2007| encyclopedia=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Online |accessdate=2007-12-16|location=|publisher=|url=http://p2.www.britannica.com/oscar/print?articleId=106324&amp;fullArticle=true&amp;tocId=9106324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of the [[Quran]] and the [[Hadith]] thrived in such a scholarly atmosphere. Philosophy, [[Fiqh]] and [[theology]] ([[kalaam]]) were further developed, most noticeably by Avicenna and his opponents. [[Al-Razi]] and [[Al-Farabi]] had provided [[methodology]] and knowledge in medicine and philosophy. Avicenna had access to the great libraries of [[Balkh]], [[Khwarezm]], [[Gorgan]], [[Ray, Iran|Rey]], [[Isfahan]] and [[Hamadan]]. Various texts (such as the 'Ahd with Bahmanyar) show that he debated philosophical points with the greatest scholars of the time. [[Aruzi Samarqandi]] describes how before Avicenna left [[Khwarezm]] he had met [[Al-Biruni]] (a famous scientist and astronomer), [[Abu Nasr Mansur|Abu Nasr Iraqi]] (a renowned mathematician), [[Abu Sahl Masihi]] (a respected philosopher) and Abu al-Khayr Khammar (a great physician).

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Avicenna was born {{c.|lk=no|980}} in Afshana, a village near [[Bukhara]] (in present-day [[Uzbekistan]]), the [[capital city|capital]] of the [[Samanids]], a Persian [[dynasty]] in [[Central Asia]] and [[Greater Khorasan]]. His mother, named SitÄra, was from Bukhara;&lt;ref&gt;''"Avicenna"''[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]], Concise Online Version, 2006 ([http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9011433/Avicenna]); D. Gutas, ''"Avicenna"'', in [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Iranica]], Online Version 2006, ([http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v3f1/v3f1a046.html LINK]); Avicenna in (Encyclopedia of Islam: Â© 1999 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands)&lt;/ref&gt; his father, AbdullÄh, was a respected [[Ismaili]]&lt;ref name="Corbin1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Corbin|first=Henry|authorlink=Henry Corbin|title=History of Islamic Philosophy, Translated by Liadain Sherrard, Philip Sherrard |location=London|publisher= Kegan Paul International in association with Islamic Publications for The Institute of Ismaili Studies |year=1993|orig-year=First published French 1964)|isbn=978-0710304162|pages=167â175|oclc=22109949 }}&lt;/ref&gt; scholar from [[Balkh]], an important town of the [[Samanid Empire]], in what is today [[Balkh Province]], [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="Aisha Khan" /&gt; His father worked in the government of [[Samanid Empire|Samanid]] in the village Kharmasain, a [[Sunni]] regional power. After five years, his younger brother, Mahmoud, was born. Avicenna first began to learn the [[Quran]] and literature in such a way that when he was ten years old he had essentially learned all of them.&lt;ref&gt;Khorasani, Sharaf Addin Sharaf, Islamic Great Encyclopedia.p1.1367 solar&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his autobiography, Avicenna had [[Hafiz (Quran)|memorised the entire Quran]] by the age of 10.&lt;ref name=Britannica2008&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-92902/The-Canon-of-Medicine|title=The Canon of Medicine (work by Avicenna)|publisher=[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]]|year=2008|accessdate=2008-06-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080528230506/http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-92902/The-Canon-of-Medicine| archivedate= 28 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He learned [[Indian mathematics|Indian arithmetic]] from an [[History of India|Indian]] greengrocer, Mahmoud Massahi&lt;ref&gt;Khorasani Sharaf, Islamic Great Encyclopedia, vol. 1. p. 1 1367 solar&lt;/ref&gt; and he began to learn more from a wandering scholar who gained a livelihood by curing the sick and teaching the young.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} He also studied [[Fiqh]] (Islamic jurisprudence) under the [[Sunni]] [[Hanafi]] scholar Ismail al-Zahid.&lt;ref name=Gracia&gt;Jorge J.E. Gracia and Timothy B. Noone (2003), ''A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages'', p. 196, [[Blackwell Publishing]], {{ISBN|0631216731}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna was taught some extent of philosophy books such as Introduction ([[Isagoge]])'s [[Porphyry (philosopher)]], [[Euclid's Elements]], [[Ptolemy]]'s [[Almagest]] by an unpopular philosopher, Abu Abdullah Nateli, who claimed philosophizing.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf Khorasani, Islamic Great encyclopedia, vol. 1. p. 1 1367 solar&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager, he was greatly troubled by the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' of [[Aristotle]], which he could not understand until he read [[al-Farabi]]'s commentary on the work.&lt;ref name="Corbin1993" /&gt; For the next year and a half, he studied philosophy, in which he encountered greater obstacles. In such moments of baffled inquiry, he would leave his books, perform the requisite [[wudu|ablutions]], then go to the mosque, and continue in [[salat|prayer]] till light broke on his difficulties. Deep into the night, he would continue his studies, and even in his dreams problems would pursue him and work out their solution. Forty times, it is said, he read through the ''Metaphysics'' of Aristotle, till the words were imprinted on his memory; but their meaning was hopelessly obscure, until one day they found illumination, from the little commentary by [[Farabi]], which he bought at a bookstall for the small sum of three dirhams. So great was his joy at the discovery, made with the help of a work from which he had expected only mystery, that he hastened to return thanks to God, and bestowed alms upon the poor.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Avicenna|volume=3|pages=62â63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He turned to medicine at 16, and not only learned medical theory, but also by gratuitous attendance of the sick had, according to his own account, discovered new methods of treatment.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt; The teenager achieved full status as a qualified physician at age 18,&lt;ref name=Britannica2008 /&gt; and found that "Medicine is no hard and thorny science, like mathematics and metaphysics, so I soon made great progress; I became an excellent doctor and began to treat patients, using approved remedies." The youthful physician's fame spread quickly, and he treated many patients without asking for payment.

A number of theories have been proposed regarding Avicenna's [[madhab]] (school of thought within Islamic jurisprudence). Medieval historian áºahÄ«r al-dÄ«n al-BayhaqÄ« (d. 1169) considered Avicenna to be a follower of the [[Brethren of Purity]].&lt;ref name="Janssens91"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An annotated bibliography on Ibn SÃ®nÃ¢ (1970â1989): including Arabic and Persian publications and Turkish and Russian references|last=Janssens|first=Jules L.|publisher=Leuven University Press|year=1991|isbn=978-9061864769|pages=89â90}} excerpt: "...&amp;nbsp;[Dimitri Gutas's ''Avicenna's maá¸hab'' convincingly demonstrates that I.S. was a sunnÃ®-á¸¤anafÃ®."[https://books.google.com/books?id=3KizrKA5YJ8C&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=ibn+sina+hanafi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RWb5VAGHA4&amp;sig=ZRBh96ucZNIraZlNQotllhxCF_k&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=F8WuTLm6MJDEsAPjn9GnDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ibn%20sina%20hanafi&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Dimitri Gutas]] along with Aisha Khan and Jules J.

=== Adulthood ===
[[File:Avicenna.jpg|thumb|upright|A drawing of Avicenna]]

Ibn Sina's first appointment was that of physician to the [[emir]], [[Nuh II]], who owed him his recovery from a dangerous illness (997). Ibn Sina's chief reward for this service was access to the royal library of the Samanids, well-known patrons of scholarship and scholars. When the library was destroyed by fire not long after, the enemies of Ibn Sina accused him of burning it, in order for ever to conceal the sources of his knowledge. Meanwhile, he assisted his father in his financial labors, but still found time to write some of his earliest works.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;

When Ibn Sina was 22 years old, he lost his father. The Samanid dynasty came to its end in December 1004. Ibn Sina seems to have declined the offers of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], and proceeded westwards to [[Konye-Urgench|Urgench]] in modern [[Turkmenistan]], where the [[vizier]], regarded as a friend of scholars, gave him a small monthly stipend. The pay was small, however, so Ibn Sina wandered from place to place through the districts of [[Nishapur]] and [[Merv]] to the borders of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], seeking an opening for his talents. [[Qabus]], the generous ruler of [[Tabaristan]], himself a poet and a scholar, with whom Ibn Sina had expected to find asylum, was on about that date (1012) starved to death by his troops who had revolted. Ibn Sina himself was at this time stricken by a severe illness. Finally, at [[Gorgan]], near the [[Caspian Sea]], Ibn Sina met with a friend, who bought a dwelling near his own house in which Ibn Sina lectured on [[logic]] and [[astronomy]]. Several of Ibn Sina's treatises were written for this patron; and the commencement of his ''Canon of Medicine'' also dates from his stay in [[Hyrcania]].&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;

Ibn Sina subsequently settled at [[Rey, Iran|Rey]], in the vicinity of modern [[Tehran]], the home town of [[Al-Razi|Rhazes]]; where [[Abu Taleb Rostam|Majd Addaula]], a son of the last [[Buwayhid]] emir, was nominal ruler under the regency of his mother ([[Seyyedeh Khatun]]). About thirty of Ibn Sina's shorter works are said to have been composed in Rey. Constant feuds which raged between the regent and her second son, [[Shams al-Daula]], however, compelled the scholar to quit the place. After a brief sojourn at [[Qazvin (city)|Qazvin]] he passed southwards to HamadÃ£n where Shams al-Daula, another Buwayhid emir, had established himself. At first, Ibn Sina entered into the service of a high-born lady; but the emir, hearing of his arrival, called him in as medical attendant, and sent him back with presents to his dwelling. Ibn Sina was even raised to the office of vizier. The emir decreed that he should be banished from the country. Ibn Sina, however, remained hidden for forty days in sheikh Ahmed Fadhel's house, until a fresh attack of illness induced the emir to restore him to his post. Even during this perturbed time, Ibn Sina persevered with his studies and teaching. Every evening, extracts from his great works, the ''Canon'' and the ''Sanatio'', were dictated and explained to his pupils. On the death of the emir, Ibn Sina ceased to be vizier and hid himself in the house of an [[apothecary]], where, with intense assiduity, he continued the composition of his works.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;

Meanwhile, he had written to Abu Ya'far, the prefect of the dynamic city of [[Isfahan]], offering his services. The new emir of Hamadan, hearing of this correspondence and discovering where Ibn Sina was hiding, incarcerated him in a fortress. War meanwhile continued between the rulers of Isfahan and HamadÃ£n; in 1024 the former captured Hamadan and its towns, expelling the Tajik mercenaries. When the storm had passed, Ibn Sina returned with the emir to Hamadan, and carried on his literary labors. Later, however, accompanied by his brother, a favorite pupil, and two slaves, Ibn Sina escaped from the city in the dress of a [[Sufi]] [[ascetic]]. After a perilous journey, they reached Isfahan, receiving an honorable welcome from the prince.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;

=== Later life and death ===

[[File:Gravestone of Avicenna.jpg|thumb|upright|Gravestone of Avicenna, [[Hamedan]], Iran]]
The remaining ten or twelve years of Ibn SÄ«nÄ's life were spent in the service of the [[Kakuyid]] ruler [[Muhammad ibn Rustam Dushmanziyar]] (also known as Ala al-Dawla), whom he accompanied as physician and general literary and scientific adviser, even in his numerous campaigns.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;

During these years he began to study literary matters and [[philology]], instigated, it is asserted, by criticisms on his style. A severe [[colic]], which seized him on the march of the army against Hamadan, was checked by remedies so violent that Ibn Sina could scarcely stand. On a similar occasion the disease returned; with difficulty he reached Hamadan, where, finding the disease gaining ground, he refused to keep up the regimen imposed, and resigned himself to his fate.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;

His friends advised him to slow down and take life moderately. He refused, however, stating that: ''"I prefer a short life with width to a narrow one with length"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Avicenna (Ibn Sina): Muslim Physician And Philosopher of the Eleventh Century|author= Aisha Khan|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|page=85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B8k3fsvGRyEC&amp;pg=PA85|isbn= 978-1404205093|date= 2006-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his deathbed remorse seized him; he bestowed his goods on the poor, restored unjust gains, freed his slaves, and read through the [[Quran]] every three days until his death.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;&lt;ref name=osler /&gt; He died in June 1037, in his fifty-eighth year, in the month of [[Ramadan]] and was buried in [[Hamadan]], Iran.&lt;ref name=osler&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Evolution Of Modern Medicine|first=William|last=Osler|authorlink=William Osler|publisher=[[Kessinger Publishing]]|year=2004|isbn=978-1419161537|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

Ibn SÄ«nÄ wrote extensively on [[early Islamic philosophy]], especially the subjects [[logic]], [[ethics]], and [[metaphysics]], including treatises named ''Logic'' and ''Metaphysics''. Most of his works were written in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;then the language of science in the Middle East&amp;nbsp;â and some in [[Persian language|Persian]]. Of linguistic significance even to this day are a few books that he wrote in nearly pure Persian language (particularly the Danishnamah-yi 'Ala', Philosophy for Ala' ad-Dawla'). Ibn SÄ«nÄ's commentaries on Aristotle often criticized the philosopher,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} encouraging a lively debate in the spirit of [[ijtihad]].

Avicenna's [[Platonism in Islamic Philosophy|Neoplatonic]] scheme of "emanations" became fundamental in the  ''[[Kalam]]'' (school of theological discourse) in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Nahyan A.G. Fancy (2006), pp.&amp;nbsp;80â81, "Pulmonary Transit and Bodily Resurrection: The Interaction of Medicine, Philosophy and Religion in the Works of Ibn al-NafÄ«s (d. 1288)", ''Electronic Theses and Dissertations'', [http://etd.nd.edu/ETD-db/theses/available/etd-11292006-152615 University of Notre Dame] {{page needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His ''Book of Healing'' became available in Europe in partial Latin translation some fifty years after its composition, under the title ''Sufficientia'', and some authors have identified a "Latin Avicennism" as flourishing for some time, paralleling the more influential [[Latin Averroism]], but suppressed by the [[Condemnations of 1210â1277|Parisian decrees of 1210 and 1215]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--there is apparently a whole body of scholarly controversy behind this, and you shouldn't just drop this stuff in passing as if it were factual.

=== Metaphysical doctrine ===
{{Technical|section|date=January 2014}}
Early Islamic philosophy and [[Islamic metaphysics]], imbued as it is with [[Kalam|Islamic theology]], distinguishes more clearly than Aristotelianism between essence and existence. Whereas existence is the domain of the contingent and the accidental, essence endures within a being beyond the accidental. The philosophy of Ibn SÄ«nÄ, particularly that part relating to metaphysics, owes much to al-Farabi. The search for a definitive Islamic philosophy separate from [[Occasionalism]] can be seen in what is left of his work.

Following al-Farabi's lead, Avicenna initiated a full-fledged inquiry into the question of being, in which he distinguished between essence (''Mahiat'') and existence (''Wujud''). He argued that the fact of existence can not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things, and that form and matter by themselves cannot interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things. Existence must, therefore, be due to an [[Causality|agent-cause]] that necessitates, imparts, gives, or adds existence to an essence. To do so, the cause must be an existing thing and coexist with its effect.&lt;ref name="Islam in Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Islam |year=2007| encyclopedia=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Online |accessdate=2007-11-27|location=|publisher=|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071222082832/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam| archivedate= 22 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avicenna's consideration of the essence-attributes question may be elucidated in terms of his ontological analysis of the modalities of being; namely impossibility, contingency, and necessity. Avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which cannot exist, while the contingent in itself (''mumkin bi-dhatihi'') has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing a contradiction. When actualized, the contingent becomes a 'necessary existent due to what is other than itself' (''wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi''). Thus, contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself. The metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different. Necessary being due to itself (''wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi'') is true in itself, while the contingent being is 'false in itself' and 'true due to something else other than itself'. The necessary is the source of its own being without borrowed existence. It is what always exists.&lt;ref&gt;Avicenna, ''Kitab al-shifa', Metaphysics II'', (eds.) G.C. Anawati, Ibrahim Madkour, Sa'id Zayed (Cairo, 1975), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nader El-Bizri]], "Avicenna and Essentialism," ''Review of Metaphysics'', Vol. 54 (2001), pp.&amp;nbsp;753â778&lt;/ref&gt;

The Necessary exists 'due-to-Its-Self', and has no quiddity/essence (''mahiyya'') other than existence (''wujud''). Furthermore, It is 'One' (''wahid ahad'')&lt;ref&gt;Avicenna, ''Metaphysica of Avicenna'', trans. Parviz Morewedge (New York, 1973), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; since there cannot be more than one 'Necessary-Existent-due-to-Itself' without differentia (fasl) to distinguish them from each other. Yet, to require differentia entails that they exist 'due-to-themselves' as well as 'due to what is other than themselves'; and this is contradictory. However, if no differentia distinguishes them from each other, then there is no sense in which these 'Existents' are not one and the same.&lt;ref name="Nader El-Bizri 2000"&gt;Nader El-Bizri, ''The Phenomenological Quest between Avicenna and Heidegger'' (Binghamton, N.Y.: Global Publications SUNY, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  Avicenna adds that the 'Necessary-Existent-due-to-Itself' has no genus (''jins''), nor a definition (''hadd''), nor a counterpart (''nadd''), nor an opposite (''did''), and is detached (''bari'') from matter (''madda''), quality (''kayf''), quantity (''kam''), place (''ayn''), situation (''wad''), and time (''waqt'').&lt;ref&gt;Avicenna, ''Kitab al-Hidaya'', ed. Muhammad 'Abdu (Cairo, 1874), pp.&amp;nbsp;262â263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salem Mashran, ''al-Janib al-ilahi 'ind Ibn Sina'' (Damascus, 1992), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nader El-Bizri, "Being and Necessity: A Phenomenological Investigation of Avicenna's Metaphysics and Cosmology," in ''Islamic Philosophy and Occidental Phenomenology on the Perennial Issue of Microcosm and Macrocosm'', ed.

Avicenna's theology on metaphysical issues (''ilÄhiyyÄt'') has been criticized by some [[Islamic scholars]], among them [[al-Ghazali]], [[Ibn Taymiyya]], and [[Ibn al-Qayyim]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibn al-Qayyim, ''Eghaathat al-Lahfaan'', Published: Al Ashqar University (2003) Printed by International Islamic Publishing House: Riyadh.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}} While discussing the views of the theists among the Greek philosophers, namely [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]] in ''Al-Munqidh min ad-Dalal'' ("Deliverance from Error"), al-Ghazali noted that the Greek philosophers "must be taxed with unbelief, as must their partisans among the Muslim philosophers, such as Ibn Sina and al-Farabi and their likes." He added that "None, however, of the Muslim philosophers engaged so much in transmitting Aristotle's lore
as did the two men just mentioned. [...] The sum of what we regard as the authentic philosophy of Aristotle, as transmitted by al-Farabi and Ibn Sina, can be reduced to three parts: a part which must be branded as unbelief; a part which must be stigmatized as innovation; and a part which need not be repudiated at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = al-Munqidh min al-Dalal|last = Ibn Muá¸¥ammad al-GhazÄlÄ«|first = AbÅ« á¸¤Ämid Muá¸¥ammad|publisher = American University of Beirut|year = 1980|isbn = |location = Boston|page = 10|url = https://www.aub.edu.lb/fas/cvsp/Documents/reading_selections/CVSP%20202/Al-ghazali.pdf|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304095350/https://www.aub.edu.lb/fas/cvsp/Documents/reading_selections/CVSP%20202/Al-ghazali.pdf|archivedate = 2016-03-04|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Argument for God's existence ===
{{Main|Proof of the Truthful}}
Avicenna made an [[argument]] for the [[existence of God]] which would be known as the "[[Proof of the Truthful]]" ([[Arabic]]: ''al-burhan al-siddiqin'').  Avicenna argued that there must be a "necessary existent" (Arabic: ''wajib al-wujud''), an entity that cannot ''not'' exist&lt;ref name=Adamson2013p170&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=From the necessary existent to God|first=Peter |last=Adamson|editor-first=Peter |editor-last=Adamson|encyclopedia=Interpreting Avicenna: Critical Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OeVribsJbgUC|date=2013-07-04|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0521190732|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; and through a series of argument, he identified it with [[God of Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=From the necessary existent to God|first=Peter |last=Adamson|editor-first=Peter |editor-last=Adamson|encyclopedia=Interpreting Avicenna: Critical Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OeVribsJbgUC|date=2013-07-04|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0521190732|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Present-day [[History of philosophy|historian of philosophy]] [[Peter Adamson (philosopher)|Peter Adamson]] called this argument one of the most influential medieval arguments for God's existence, and Avicenna's biggest contribution to the history of philosophy.&lt;ref name=Adamson2013p170 /&gt;

=== Al-Biruni correspondence ===
Correspondence between Ibn Sina (with his student Ahmad ibn 'Ali al-Ma'sumi) and [[Al-Biruni]] has survived in which they debated [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] [[natural philosophy]] and the [[Peripatetic school]]. Abu Rayhan began by asking Avicenna eighteen questions, ten of which were criticisms of Aristotle's ''[[On the Heavens]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rafik Berjak and Muzaffar Iqbal, "Ibn SinaâAl-Biruni correspondence", ''Islam &amp; Science'', June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theology ===
Avicenna was a devout Muslim and sought to reconcile rational philosophy with Islamic theology. His aim was to prove the existence of God and His creation of the world scientifically and through [[reason]] and [[logic]].&lt;ref name="Goodman-8-9"&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman (2003), ''Islamic Humanism'', pp.&amp;nbsp;8â9, [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0195135806}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna's views on Islamic theology (and philosophy) were enormously influential, forming part of the core of the curriculum at Islamic religious schools until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Morris (1992), "The Philosopher-Prophet in Avicenna's Political Philosophy", in C. Butterworth (ed.), ''The Political Aspects of Islamic Philosophy'', {{ISBN|978-0932885074}}, Chapter 4, Cambridge [[Harvard University Press]], pp. 152â198 [p. 156].&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna wrote a number of short treatises dealing with Islamic theology. These included treatises on the [[Islamic prophet|prophets]] (whom he viewed as "inspired philosophers"), and also on various scientific and philosophical interpretations of the Quran, such as how Quranic [[cosmology]] corresponds to his own philosophical system. In general these treatises linked his philosophical writings to Islamic religious ideas; for example, the body's afterlife.

There are occasional brief hints and allusions in his longer works however that Avicenna considered philosophy as the only sensible way to distinguish real prophecy from illusion. He did not state this more clearly because of the political implications of such a theory, if prophecy could be questioned, and also because most of the time he was writing shorter works which concentrated on explaining his theories on philosophy and theology clearly, without digressing to consider [[epistemological]] matters which could only be properly considered by other philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Morris (1992), "The Philosopher-Prophet in Avicenna's Political Philosophy", in C. Butterworth (ed.), ''The Political Aspects of Islamic Philosophy'', Chapter 4, Cambridge [[Harvard University Press]], pp. 152â198 [pp. &amp;nbsp;160â161].&lt;/ref&gt;

Later interpretations of Avicenna's philosophy split into three different schools; those (such as [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi|al-Tusi]]) who continued to apply his philosophy as a system to interpret later political events and scientific advances; those (such as [[al-Razi]]) who considered Avicenna's theological works in isolation from his wider philosophical concerns; and those (such as [[al-Ghazali]]) who selectively used parts of his philosophy to support their own attempts to gain greater spiritual insights through a variety of mystical means. It was the theological interpretation championed by those such as al-Razi which eventually came to predominate in the [[madrasahs]].&lt;ref&gt;James W. Morris (1992), "The Philosopher-Prophet in Avicenna's Political Philosophy", in C. Butterworth (ed.), ''The Political Aspects of Islamic Philosophy'', Chapter 4, Cambridge [[Harvard University Press]], pp. 152â198 [pp.&amp;nbsp;156â158].&lt;/ref&gt;

Avicenna [[Hafiz (Quran)|memorized the Quran]] by the age of ten, and as an adult, he wrote five treatises commenting on [[sura]]s from the Quran. One of these texts included the ''Proof of Prophecies'', in which he comments on several Quranic verses and holds the Quran in high esteem. Avicenna argued that the Islamic prophets should be considered higher than philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Jules Janssens (2004), "Avicenna and the Qur'an: A Survey of his Qur'anic commentaries", ''MIDEO'' '''25''', p.&amp;nbsp;177â192.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thought experiments ===
{{Main|floating man}}
While he was imprisoned in the castle of Fardajan near Hamadhan, Avicenna wrote his famous "[[floating man|Floating Man]]"&amp;nbsp;â literally falling man&amp;nbsp;â [[thought experiment]] to demonstrate human [[self-awareness]] and the substantiality and immateriality of the soul. Avicenna believed his "Floating Man" thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is a substance, and claimed humans cannot doubt their own consciousness, even in a situation that prevents all sensory data input. The thought experiment told its readers to imagine themselves created all at once while suspended in the air, isolated from all [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]], which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies. He argued that, in this scenario, one would still have [[self-consciousness]]. Because it is conceivable that a person, suspended in air while cut off from [[empirical evidence|sense experience]], would still be capable of determining his own existence, the thought experiment points to the conclusions that the soul is a perfection, independent of the body, and an immaterial substance.&lt;ref&gt;See a discussion of this in connection with an analytic take on the philosophy of mind in: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Avicenna and the Problem of Consciousness', in ''Consciousness and the Great Philosophers'', eds. S. Leach and J. Tartaglia (London: Routledge, 2016), 45â53&lt;/ref&gt; The conceivability of this "Floating Man" indicates that the soul is perceived intellectually, which entails the soul's separateness from the body. Avicenna referred to the living human [[nous|intelligence]], particularly the [[active intellect]], which he believed to be the [[hypostatic abstraction|hypostasis]] by which God communicates [[truth]] to the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility to nature. Following is an English translation of the argument:

{{quote|One of us (i.e. a human being) should be imagined as having been created in a single stroke; created perfect and complete but with his vision obscured so that he cannot perceive external entities; created falling through air or a void, in such a manner that he is not struck by the firmness of the air in any way that compels him to feel it, and with his limbs separated so that they do not come in contact with or touch each other. Then contemplate the following: can he be assured of the existence of himself? He does not have any doubt in that his self exists, without thereby asserting that he has any exterior limbs, nor any internal organs, neither heart nor brain, nor any one of the exterior things at all; but rather he can affirm the existence of himself, without thereby asserting there that this self has any extension in space. Even if it were possible for him in that state to imagine a hand or any other limb, he would not imagine it as being a part of his self, nor as a condition for the existence of that self; for as you know that which is asserted is different from that which is not asserted, and that which is inferred is different from that which is not inferred. Therefore the self, the existence of which has been asserted, is a unique characteristic, in as much that it is not as such the same as the body or the limbs, which have not been ascertained. Thus that which is ascertained (i.e. the self), does have a way of being sure of the existence of the soul as something other than the body, even something non-bodily; this he knows, this he should understand intuitively, if it is that he is ignorant of it and needs to be beaten with a stick [to realize it].|Ibn Sina|Kitab Al-Shifa, On the Soul&lt;ref name="Nader El-Bizri 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Sina, ''Ø§ÙÙÙ Ø§ÙØ³Ø§Ø¯Ø³ ÙÙ Ø§ÙØ·Ø¨ÙØ¹ÙØ§Øª ÙÙ ÙØªØ§Ø¨ Ø§ÙØ´ÙØ§Ø¡ Ø§ÙÙØ³Ù Ø§ÙØ£ÙÙ'' (Beirut, Lebanon.: M.A.J.D Enterprise Universitaire d'Etude et de Publication S.A.R.L)

However, Avicenna posited the brain as the place where reason interacts with sensation.  Sensation prepares the soul to receive rational concepts from the universal Agent Intellect. The first knowledge of the flying person would be "I am," affirming his or her essence.  That essence could not be the body, obviously, as the flying person has no sensation. Thus, the knowledge that "I am" is the core of a human being:  the soul exists and is self-aware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hasse|first=Dag Nikolaus|title=Avicenna's De Anima in the Latin West|year=2000|publisher=Warburg Institute|location=London|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna thus concluded that the idea of the [[self (philosophy)|self]] is not logically dependent on any physical [[Object (philosophy)|thing]], and that the soul should not be seen in [[relative term]]s, but as a primary given, a [[substance theory|substance]].

=== Earth sciences ===
Ibn SÄ«nÄ wrote on [[Earth science]]s such as [[geology]] in ''The Book of Healing''.&lt;ref name=Goodfield&gt;[[Stephen Toulmin]] and [[June Goodfield]] (1965), ''The Ancestry of Science: The Discovery of Time'', p. 64, [[University of Chicago Press]] (cf. [http://muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=319 The Contribution of Ibn Sina to the development of Earth sciences])&lt;/ref&gt; While discussing the formation of [[mountain]]s, he explained:

{{quote|Either they are the effects of upheavals of the crust of the earth, such as might occur during a violent earthquake, or they are the effect of water, which, cutting itself a new route, has denuded the valleys, the strata being of different kinds, some soft, some hard&amp;nbsp;... It would require a long period of time for all such changes to be accomplished, during which the mountains themselves might be somewhat diminished in size.&lt;ref name=Goodfield /&gt;}}

=== Philosophy of science ===
In the ''Al-Burhan'' (''On Demonstration'') section of ''The Book of Healing'', Avicenna discussed the [[philosophy of science]] and described an early [[scientific method]] of [[inquiry]]. He discusses Aristotle's ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' and significantly diverged from it on several points. Avicenna discussed the issue of a proper methodology for scientific inquiry and the question of "How does one acquire the first principles of a science?" He asked how a scientist would arrive at "the initial [[axiom]]s or [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] of a [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] science without inferring them from some more basic premises?" He explains that the ideal situation is when one grasps that a "relation holds between the terms, which would allow for absolute, universal certainty". Avicenna then adds two further methods for arriving at the [[first principle]]s: the ancient Aristotelian method of [[inductive reasoning|induction]] (''istiqra''), and the method of [[Hypothesis|examination]] and [[experiment]]ation (''tajriba''). Avicenna criticized Aristotelian induction, arguing that "it does not lead to the absolute, universal, and certain premises that it purports to provide."

An early formal system of [[temporal logic]] was studied by Avicenna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 History of logic: Arabic logic], ''[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he did not develop a real theory of temporal propositions, he did study the relationship between ''temporalis'' and the implication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Temporal Logic: From Ancient Ideas to Artificial Intelligence |publisher=Springer |author1=Peter ÃhrstrÃ¸m |author2=Per Hasle |year=1995 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna's work was further developed by [[Najm al-DÄ«n al-QazwÄ«nÄ« al-KÄtibÄ«]] and became the dominant system of [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|Islamic logic]] until modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Toward a History of Syllogistic After Avicenna: Notes on Rescher's Studies on Arabic Modal Logic |author=Tony Street |journal=Journal of Islamic Studies |volume=11 |issue=2 |year=2000 |pages=209â228|doi=10.1093/jis/11.2.209 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521520690 |pages=247â265 |editor1=Peter Adamson |last-author-amp=yes |editor2=Richard C. Taylor |last=Street |first=Tony |title=The Cambridge Companion to Arabic Philosophy |chapter=Logic |date=2005-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avicennian logic also influenced several early European logicians such as [[Albertus Magnus]]&lt;ref&gt;Richard F. Washell (1973), "Logic, Language, and Albert the Great", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' '''34''' (3), pp.&amp;nbsp;445â450 [445].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William of Ockham]].&lt;ref&gt;Kneale p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kneale: p. 266; Ockham: [[Summa Logicae]] i. 14; Avicenna: ''Avicennae Opera'' Venice 1508 f87rb&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna endorsed the law of noncontradiction proposed by Aristotle, that a fact could not be both true and false at the same time and in the same sense of the terminology used. He stated, "Anyone who denies the law of noncontradiction should be beaten and burned until he admits that to be beaten is not the same as not to be beaten, and to be burned is not the same as not to be burned."&lt;ref&gt;Avicenna, Metaphysics, I; commenting on Aristotle, Topics I.11.105a4â5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physics ===
In [[mechanics]], Ibn SÄ«nÄ, in ''The Book of Healing'', developed a theory of [[motion (physics)|motion]], in which he made a distinction between the inclination (tendency to motion) and [[force]] of a [[projectile]], and concluded that motion was a result of an inclination (''mayl'') transferred to the projectile by the thrower, and that [[projectile motion]] in a vacuum would not cease.&lt;ref name=Espinoza&gt;Fernando Espinoza (2005). "An analysis of the historical development of ideas about motion and its implications for teaching", ''Physics Education'' '''40''' (2), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; He viewed inclination as a permanent force whose effect is dissipated by external forces such as [[air resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Sayili (1987), "Ibn SÄ«nÄ and Buridan on the Motion of the Projectile", ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'' '''500''' (1), pp. 477â482: "It was a permanent force whose effect got dissipated only as a result of external agents such as air resistance. He is apparently the first to conceive such a permanent type of impressed virtue for non-natural motion."&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of motion presented by Avicenna was probably influenced by the 6th-century Alexandrian scholar [[John Philoponus]]. Avicenna's is a less sophisticated variant of the [[theory of impetus]] developed by [[Buridan]] in the 14th century. It is unclear if Buridan was influenced by Avicenna, or by Philoponus directly.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zupko, "John Buridan" in [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], 2014
([http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/buridan/notes.html#48 fn. 48])
"We do not know precisely where Buridan got the idea of impetus, but a less sophisticated notion of impressed forced can be found in Avicenna's doctrine of mayl (inclination). In this he was possibly influenced by Philoponus, who was developing the Stoic notion of hormÃ© (impulse). For discussion, see Zupko (1997) ['What Is the Science of the Soul? A Case Study in the Evolution of Late Medieval Natural Philosophy,' Synthese, 110(2): 297â334]."&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[optics]], Ibn Sina was among those who argued that light had a speed, observing that "if the perception of [[light]] is due to the emission of some sort of [[Subatomic particle|particles]] by a luminous source, the speed of light must be finite."&lt;ref&gt;[[George Sarton]], ''Introduction to the History of Science'', Vol. 1, p. 710.&lt;/ref&gt; He also provided a wrong explanation of the [[rainbow]] phenomenon. [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]] described Avicenna's ("Ibn SÄ«nÄ") theory on the rainbow as follows:

{{quote|Independent observation had demonstrated to him that the bow is not formed in the dark cloud but rather in the very thin mist lying between the cloud and the sun or observer. The cloud, he thought, serves simply as the background of this thin substance, much as a quicksilver lining is placed upon the rear surface of the glass in a mirror. Ibn SÄ«nÄ would change the place not only of the bow, but also of the color formation, holding the iridescence to be merely a subjective sensation in the eye.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Benjamin Boyer (1954). "Robert Grosseteste on the Rainbow", ''Osiris'' '''11''', pp.&amp;nbsp;247â258 [248].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1253, a Latin text entitled ''Speculum Tripartitum'' stated the following regarding Avicenna's theory on [[heat]]:

{{quote|Avicenna says in his book of heaven and earth, that heat is generated from motion in external things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=On the Fringes of the Corpus Aristotelicum: the Pseudo-Avicenna Liber Celi Et Mundi|last=Gutman|first=Oliver|journal=Early Science and Medicine|volume=2|issue=2|year=1997|pages=109â128|doi=10.1163/157338297X00087}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Psychology ===
Avicenna's legacy in classical psychology is primarily embodied in the ''Kitab al-nafs'' parts of his ''Kitab al-shifa'' (''The Book of Healing'') and ''Kitab al-najat'' (''The Book of Deliverance''). These were known in Latin under the title [[De Anima]] (treatises "on the soul").{{dubious|date=October 2012}} Notably, Avicenna develops what is called the "flying man" argument in the Psychology of ''The Cure'' I.1.7 as defense of the argument that the soul is without quantitative extension, which has an affinity with [[Descartes]]'s ''cogito'' argument (or what [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] designates as a form of an "''epoche''").&lt;ref name="Nader El-Bizri 2000 pp. 149-171"&gt;[[Nader El-Bizri]], ''The Phenomenological Quest between Avicenna and Heidegger'' (Binghamton, NY: Global Publications SUNY, 2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;149â171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elbizri67-89"&gt;Nader El-Bizri, "Avicenna's De Anima between Aristotle and Husserl," in ''The Passions of the Soul in the Metamorphosis of Becoming'', ed. Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka (Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2003), pp.&amp;nbsp;67â89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Avicenna's psychology requires that connection between the body and soul be strong enough to ensure the soul's individuation, but weak enough to allow for its immortality. Avicenna grounds his psychology on physiology, which means his account of the soul is one that deals almost entirely with the natural science of the body and its abilities of perception. Thus, the philosopher's connection between the soul and body is explained almost entirely by his understanding of perception; in this way, bodily perception interrelates with the immaterial human intellect. In sense perception, the perceiver senses the form of the object; first, by perceiving features of the object by our external senses. This sensory information is supplied to the internal senses, which merge all the pieces into a whole, unified conscious experience. This process of perception and abstraction is the nexus of the soul and body, for the material body may only perceive material objects, while the immaterial soul may only receive the immaterial, universal forms. The way the soul and body interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete particular is the key to their relationship and interaction, which takes place in the physical body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Avicenna | title = Avicenna's Psychology. An English translation of KitÄb al-NajÄt, Book II, Chapter VI, with Historico-Philosophical Notes and Textual Improvements on the Cairo edition | editor = F. Rahman | publisher = Oxford University Press, Geoffrey Cumberlege | year = 1952 | location = London | page = 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The soul completes the action of intellection by accepting forms that have been abstracted from matter. This process requires a concrete particular (material) to be abstracted into the universal intelligible (immaterial). The material and immaterial interact through the Active Intellect, which is a "divine light" containing the intelligible forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Avicenna | title = Avicenna's Psychology.

=== Astronomy and astrology ===
Avicenna wrote an attack on astrology titled ''ResÄla fÄ« ebá¹­Äl aá¸¥kÄm al-nojÅ«m'', in which he cited passages from the Quran to dispute the power of astrology to foretell the future.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Saliba]] (1994), ''A History of Arabic Astronomy: Planetary Theories During the Golden Age of Islam'', pp. 60, 67â69. [[New York University Press]], {{ISBN|0814780237}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that each planet had some influence on the earth, but argued against astrologers being able to determine the exact effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=George|last=Saliba|authorlink=George Saliba|title= Avicenna|work=EncyclopÃ¦dia Iranica, Online Edition|year= 2011|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avicenna's astronomical writings had some influence on later writers, although in general his work could be considered less developed than [[Alhazen]] or [[Al-Biruni]]. One important feature of his writing is that he considers mathematical astronomy as a separate discipline to astrology.&lt;ref name=Ragep /&gt; He criticized Aristotle's view of the [[star]]s receiving their light from the [[Sun]], stating that the stars are self-luminous, and believed that the [[planet]]s are also self-luminous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The phases of venus before 1610|first=Roger|last=Ariew|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A|volume=18|issue=1|date=March 1987|pages=81â92|doi=10.1016/0039-3681(87)90012-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed to have observed [[Transit of Venus|Venus as a spot on the Sun]]. This is possible, as there was a transit on May 24, 1032, but Avicenna did not give the date of his observation, and modern scholars have questioned whether he could have observed the transit from his location at that time; he may have mistaken a sunspot for Venus. He used his transit observation to help establish that Venus was, at least sometimes, below the Sun in Ptolemaic cosmology,&lt;ref name=Ragep&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ibn SÄ«nÄ: AbÅ« Ê¿AlÄ« alâá¸¤usayn ibn Ê¿AbdallÄh ibn SÄ«nÄ|author=Sally P.

He also wrote the ''Summary of the Almagest'', (based on [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]''), with an appended treatise "to bring that which is stated in the Almagest and what is understood from Natural Science into conformity". For example, Avicenna considers the motion of the solar [[apogee]], which Ptolemy had taken to be fixed.&lt;ref name=Ragep /&gt;

=== Chemistry ===
Ibn SÄ«nÄ used [[steam distillation]] to produce essential oils such as rose essence, which he used as [[aromatherapeutic]] treatments for heart conditions.&lt;ref name=Marlene&gt;Marlene Ericksen (2000). ''Healing with Aromatherapy'', p. 9. McGraw-Hill Professional. {{ISBN|0658003828}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Traditional Healer's Handbook: A Classic Guide to the Medicine of Avicenna|author=Ghulam Moinuddin Chishti|page=239|year=1991|isbn=9780892814381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike al-Razi, Ibn SÄ«nÄ explicitly disputed the theory of the [[Philosopher's stone|transmutation of substances]] commonly believed by [[alchemy|alchemists]]:

{{quote|Those of the chemical craft know well that no change can be effected in the different species of substances, though they can produce the appearance of such change.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Briffault]] (1938). ''The Making of Humanity'', p.&amp;nbsp;196â197.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Four works on alchemy attributed to Avicenna were translated into [[Latin]] as:&lt;ref name=Anawati&gt;Georges C. Anawati (1996), "Arabic alchemy", in Roshdi Rashed, ed., ''[[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]]'', Vol. 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;853â885 [875]. [[Routledge]], London and New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{lang|la|Liber Aboali Abincine de Anima in arte Alchemiae}}
* {{lang|la|Declaratio Lapis physici Avicennae filio sui Aboali}}
* {{lang|la|Avicennae de congelatione et conglutinatione lapidum}}
* {{lang|la|Avicennae ad Hasan Regem epistola de Re recta}}

{{lang|la|Liber Aboali Abincine de Anima in arte Alchemiae}} was the most influential, having influenced later [[medieval]] chemists and alchemists such as [[Vincent of Beauvais]]. However Anawati argues (following Ruska) that the de Anima is a fake by a Spanish author. Similarly the Declaratio is believed not to be actually by Avicenna. The third work (''The Book of Minerals'') is agreed to be Avicenna's writing, adapted from the ''Kitab al-Shifa'' (''Book of the Remedy'').&lt;ref name=Anawati /&gt;
Ibn Sina classified minerals into stones, fusible substances, sulfurs, and salts, building on the ideas of Aristotle and Jabir.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Historical Background of Chemistry|first=Henry Marshall|last=Leicester|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1971|isbn=978-0486610535|page=70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJZVQnqcwv4C&amp;pg=PA70|quote=There was one famous Arab physician who doubted even the reality of transmutation.

Many of his observations on chemistry are included in the ''Kitab al-Shifa'', the "Book of the Remedy". In the physical section of this work he discusses the formation of minerals, which he classifies into stones, fusible substances, sulfurs, and salts. Mercury is classified with the fusible substances, metals}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''epistola de Re recta'' is somewhat less sceptical of alchemy; Anawati argues that it is by Avicenna, but written earlier in his career when he had not yet firmly decided that transmutation was impossible.&lt;ref name=Anawati /&gt;

=== Poetry ===
Almost half of Ibn SÄ«nÄ's works are versified.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Granville Browne|E.G. Browne]], ''Islamic Medicine'' (sometimes also printed under the title ''Arabian medicine''), 2002, Goodword Pub., {{ISBN|8187570199}}, p61&lt;/ref&gt; His poems appear in both Arabic and Persian. As an example, [[Edward Granville Browne]] claims that the following Persian verses are incorrectly attributed to [[Omar KhayyÃ¡m]], and were originally written by Ibn SÄ«nÄ:&lt;ref&gt;E.G. Browne, ''Islamic Medicine'' (sometimes also printed under the title ''Arabian medicine''), 2002, Goodword Pub., {{ISBN|8187570199}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;60â61)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===
[[File:Avicenna Mausoleum interior.jpg|thumb|upright|Inside view of the Avicenna Mausoleum, designed by [[Hooshang Seyhoun]] in 1945â1950]]

As early as the 13th century when [[Dante Alighieri]] depicted him in Limbo alongside the virtuous non-Christian thinkers in his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' such as [[Virgil]], [[Averroes]], [[Homer]], [[Horace]], [[Ovid]], [[Lucan]], [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Saladin]], Avicenna has been recognized by both East and West, as one of the great figures in intellectual history.

[[George Sarton]], the author of ''The History of Science'', described Ibn SÄ«nÄ as "one of the greatest thinkers and medical scholars in history"&lt;ref name=Zahoor&gt;[[George Sarton]], ''Introduction to the History of Science''.&lt;br /&gt;([[cf.]] Dr. A. Zahoor and Dr. Z. Haq (1997). [http://www.cyberistan.org/islamic/Introl1.html Quotations From Famous Historians of Science], Cyberistan.)&lt;/ref&gt; and called him "the most famous [[Islamic science|scientist of Islam]] and one of the most famous of all races, places, and times." He was one of the Islamic world's leading writers in the field of medicine.
Along with [[al-Razi|Rhazes]], [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi|Abulcasis]], [[Ibn al-Nafis]], and [[al-Ibadi]], Ibn SÄ«nÄ is considered an important compiler of early Muslim medicine. He is remembered in the Western [[history of medicine]] as a major historical figure who made important contributions to medicine and the European [[Renaissance]]. His medical texts were unusual in that where controversy existed between Galen and Aristotle's views on medical matters (such as anatomy), he preferred to side with Aristotle, where necessary updating Aristotle's position to take into account post-Aristotelian advances in anatomical knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Musallam |first=B. |title=Avicenna Medicine and Biology |year=2011 |encyclopedia=EncyclopÃ¦dia Iranica |accessdate=2011-11-09 |location= |publisher= |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's dominant intellectual influence among medieval European scholars meant that Avicenna's linking of Galen's medical writings with Aristotle's philosophical writings in the ''Canon of Medicine'' (along with its comprehensive and logical organisation of knowledge) significantly increased Avicenna's importance in medieval Europe in comparison to other Islamic writers on medicine. His influence following translation of the ''Canon'' was such that from the early fourteenth to the mid-sixteenth centuries he was ranked with Hippocrates and Galen as one of the acknowledged authorities, {{lang|la|princeps medicorum}} ("prince of physicians").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Weisser |first=U. |title=Avicenna The influence of Avicenna on medical studies in the West |year=2011 |encyclopedia=EncyclopÃ¦dia Iranica |accessdate=2011-11-09 |location= |publisher= |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Louis L'Amour]]'s 1985 historical novel ''[[The Walking Drum]]'', Kerbouchard studies and discusses Avicenna's ''The Canon of Medicine''.

In his book ''[[The Physician]]'' (1988) [[Noah Gordon (novelist)|Noah Gordon]] tells the story of a young English medical apprentice who disguises himself as a Jew to travel from England to Persia and learn from Avicenna, the great master of his time. The novel was adapted into a feature film, ''[[The Physician (2013 film)|The Physician]]'', in 2013. Avicenna was played by [[Ben Kingsley]].

== Arabic works ==
The treatises of Ibn SÄ«nÄ influenced later Muslim thinkers in many areas including theology, philology, mathematics, astronomy, physics, and music. His works numbered almost 450 volumes on a wide range of subjects, of which around 240 have survived. In particular, 150 volumes of his surviving works concentrate on philosophy and 40 of them concentrate on medicine.&lt;ref name="MacTutor Biography|id=Avicenna" /&gt;
His most famous works are ''The Book of Healing'', and ''The Canon of Medicine''.

Ibn SÄ«nÄ wrote at least one treatise on alchemy, but several others have been falsely attributed to him.  His ''Logic'', ''Metaphysics'', ''Physics'', and ''De Caelo'', are treatises giving a synoptic view of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian doctrine]],&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt; though  ''Metaphysics'' demonstrates a significant departure from the brand of [[Neoplatonism]] known as Aristotelianism in Ibn SÄ«nÄ's world;
Arabic philosophers{{who|date=February 2015}}{{year needed|date=February 2015}} have hinted at the idea that Ibn SÄ«nÄ was attempting to "re-Aristotelianise" Muslim philosophy in its entirety, unlike his predecessors, who accepted the conflation of Platonic, Aristotelian, Neo- and Middle-Platonic works transmitted into the Muslim world.

The ''Logic'' and ''Metaphysics'' have been extensively reprinted, the latter, e.g., at Venice in 1493, 1495, and 1546. Some of his shorter essays on medicine, logic, etc., take a poetical form (the poem on logic was published by Schmoelders in 1836).&lt;ref&gt;Thought Experiments: Popular Thought Experiments in Philosophy, Physics, Ethics, Computer Science &amp; Mathematics by Fredrick Kennard, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Two encyclopaedic treatises, dealing with philosophy, are often mentioned. The larger, ''[[The Book of Healing|Al-Shifa']]'' (''Sanatio''), exists nearly complete in manuscript in the [[Bodleian Library]] and elsewhere; part of it on the ''De Anima'' appeared at Pavia (1490) as the ''Liber Sextus Naturalium'', and the long account of Ibn Sina's philosophy given by [[Muhammad al-Shahrastani]] seems to be mainly an analysis, and in many places a reproduction, of the Al-Shifa'. A shorter form of the work is known as the An-najat (''Liberatio''). The Latin editions of part of these works have been modified by the corrections which the monastic editors confess that they applied. There is also a {{lang|ar|Ø­ÙÙØª ÙØ´Ø±ÙÙÙ|rtl=yes}} (''hikmat-al-mashriqqiyya'', in Latin ''Philosophia Orientalis''), mentioned by [[Roger Bacon]], the majority of which is lost in antiquity, which according to Averroes was pantheistic in tone.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;

In the 13th century, [[Ibn al-Nafis]] wrote his own novel ''Fadil ibn Natiq'', known as ''Theologus Autodidactus'' in the West, as a critical response to ''Hayy ibn Yaqdhan''.&lt;ref&gt;Nahyan A. G.

== Persian works ==

Avicenna's most important [[Persian language|Persian]] work is the ''Danishnama-i 'Alai'' ({{lang|fa|Ø¯Ø§ÙØ´ÙØ§ÙÙ Ø¹ÙØ§Ø¦Û}}, "the Book of Knowledge for [Prince] 'Ala ad-Daulah"). Avicenna created new scientific vocabulary that had not previously existed in Persian. The Danishnama covers such topics as logic, metaphysics, music theory and other sciences of his time. It has been translated into English by Parwiz Morewedge in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Avicenna, Danish Nama-i 'Alai. trans. Parviz Morewedge as ''The Metaphysics of Avicenna'' (New York: Columbia University Press), 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is also important in respect to Persian scientific works.

''Andar Danesh-e Rag'' ({{lang|fa|Ø§ÙØ¯Ø± Ø¯Ø§ÙØ´ Ø±Ú¯}}, "On the Science of the Pulse") contains nine chapters on the science of the pulse and is a condensed synopsis.

[[Persian poetry]] from Ibn Sina is recorded in various manuscripts and later anthologies such as ''[[Nozhat al-Majales]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4695">In [[Kashmir Shaivism|KaÅmir Åaivism]] the world is described as being composed of four spheres ('''{{IAST|aá¹á¸a}}''') that contain a series of phenomenal elements ([[tattva]]). The four ''{{IAST|aá¹á¸a}}'' are described to appear by the means of the internal abundance of [[Shiva|Åiva]]'s divine powers.&lt;ref&gt;Essence of the Exact Reality or ParamÄrthasÄra of Abhinavagupta, B.N. Pandit, 1991, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the four {{IAST|aá¹á¸a}} is [[The 36 tattvas#.C5.9Biva|Åiva tattva]] which is the substrate and essential nature of all the other tattvas.

=={{IAST|Åakti aá¹á¸a}}==
Projected by the [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]], '''{{IAST|Åakti aá¹á¸a}}''' is the first step of creation. Also called ''the pure creation'' because at this level the divine nature of [[Åiva]] is not obscured, it manifests a state of diversity in unity. The divine powers ([[Åakti]]) gradually descend from ''Änanda Åakti'' (bliss) to ''IcchÄ Åakti'' (the power of will), ''JÃ±Äna Åakti'' (the power of knowledge) and ''KriyÄ Åakti'' (the power of action), at the same time creating the basis for the dual creation. At this stage, though, the duality is only "in concept"; there is no actual division or limitation yet. This ''{{IAST|aá¹á¸a}}'' contains [[The 36 tattvas#.C5.9Bakti|Åakti tattva]], [[The 36 tattvas#sad.C4.81.C5.9Biva|SadÄÅiva tattva]], [[The 36 tattvas#.C4.AB.C5.9Bvara|IÅvara tattva]] and [[The 36 tattvas#.C5.9Buddha vidy.C4.81|Åuddha-vidyÄ tattva]] (all the pure tattvas except the first one, [[The 36 tattvas#.C5.9Biva|Åiva tattva]]).

=={{IAST|MÄyÄ aá¹á¸a}}==
The ''sphere of [[Maya (illusion)|MÄyÄ]]'' causes the divine nature and purity that exists in {{IAST|Åakti aá¹á¸a}} to be forgotten. The divine creation is covered with five limitations (''kaÃ±cuka'') that make the infinite, eternal, perfect in itself, all knowing and all powerful nature of [[God]], as manifested first in the ''{{IAST|Åakti Aá¹á¸a}}'', appear limited in space ([[The 36 tattvas#niyati - spatial limitation|Niyati tattva]]) and time ([[The 36 tattvas#k.C4.81la - limitation in time|KÄla tattva]]), incomplete ([[The 36 tattvas#r.C4.81ga - incompleteness.2C the limitation of desire|RÄga tattva]]), with limited knowledge ([[The 36 tattvas#vidy.C4.81 - the limitation of knowledge|AÅuddha-vidyÄ tattva]]) and power of action ([[The 36 tattvas#kal.C4.81 - limitation in power|KalÄ tattva]]). This {{IAST|aá¹á¸a}} contains seven tattvas, from [[The 36 tattvas#m.C4.81y.C4.81 - the origin of illusion and duality|MÄyÄ tattva]] to [[The 36 tattvas#puru.E1.B9.A3a|{{IAST|Puruá¹£a tattva}}]].&lt;ref name="Tantric Mysticism page 103"/&gt;

=={{IAST|Praká¹ti aá¹á¸a}}==
'''{{IAST|Praká¹ti aá¹á¸a}}''' describes the world as it is perceived from the common human level of consciousness. It contains the Åakti of the individual soul ({{IAST|puruá¹£a}}): [[The 36 tattvas#praká¹ti tattva|{{IAST|Praká¹ti tattva}}]], the intellect ([[The 36 tattvas#buddhi - the intellect|Buddhi tattva]]), the ego ([[The 36 tattvas#aha.E1.B9.83k.C4.81ra - the empirical ego|AhamkÄra tattva]]), the sensory mind ([[The 36 tattvas#manas - the lower mind|Manas tattva]]), the five sense organs ([[The 36 tattvas#The five j.C3.B1.C4.81nendriyas - sense organs|JÃ±Änendriya]]), the five organs of action ([[The 36 tattvas#The five karmendriyas - organs of action|Karmendriya]]), the five subtle essences ([[The 36 tattvas#The five tanm.C4.81tras - subtle mediums of the sensations|TanmÄtra]]) and the last four physical elements ([[The 36 tattvas#The five mah.C4.81bh.C5.ABtas|MahÄbhutÄ]]) : [[The 36 tattvas#.C4.81k.C4.81.C5.9Ba - ether|ÄkÄÅa tattva]], [[The 36 tattvas#v.C4.81yu - air|VÄyu tattva]], [[The 36 tattvas#tejas - fire|Tejas tattva]] and [[The 36 tattvas#jala - water|Jala tattva]].&lt;ref name="Tantric Mysticism page 103"/&gt;

=={{IAST|Pá¹thvÄ« aá¹á¸a}}==
'''{{IAST|Pá¹thvÄ« aá¹á¸a}}''' is the terminal point of creation&amp;nbsp;â solid matter. There is only one tattva in this sphere: [[The 36 tattvas#p.E1.B9.9Bithv.C4.AB - earth|{{IAST|Pá¹thivi tattva}}]]. This tattva has a special statute because it contains in essence all the other tattvas and is the home of [[Kundalini energy|{{IAST|Kuá¹á¸alinÄ« Åakti}}]].&lt;ref name="Tantric Mysticism page 103"/&gt;

{{Black Power sidebar}}

The '''Black Power movement''' emphasized racial pride, economic empowerment, and the creation of political and cultural institutions for black people in the United States.

The movement grew out of the [[Civil rights movement]], as black activists experimented with forms of self-advocacy ranging from political lobbying to armed struggle. The Black Power movement served as a focal point for the view that reformist and pacifist elements of the Civil Rights Moment were not effective in changing race relations.

Motivated by a desire for safety and self-sufficiency that was not available inside [[Redlining|redline]] neighborhoods, Black Power activists founded [[African-American Bookstores|black-owned bookstores]], food cooperatives, farms, media, [[African-American book publishers in the United States, 1960â80|printing presses]], schools, clinics and ambulance services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaihs.org/black-owned-bookstores-anchors-of-the-black-power-movement/|title=Black-Owned Bookstores: Anchors of the Black Power Movement â AAIHS|last=Davis|first=Joshua Clark|date=|website=Aaihs.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lbvOF1BUT2oC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=the+east+cooperative+view+from+the+east+kununuana#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20east%20cooperative%20view%20from%20the%20east%20kununuana&amp;f=false|title=A View from the East: Black Cultural Nationalism and Education in New York City|last=Konadu|first=Kwasi|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=9780815651017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8YSmiFins9sC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=republik+of+new+afrika+farm#v=onepage&amp;q=republik%20of%20new%20afrika%20farm&amp;f=false|title=Far Left of Center: The American Radical Left Today|last=Klehr|first=Harvey|date=1988-01-01|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=9781412823432|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/black-power-tv|title=Black Power TV {{!}} Duke University Press|website=Dukeupress.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2016/02/black-power-movement-and-its-schools|title=The Black Power movement and its schools {{!}} Cornell Chronicle|website=News.cornell.edu|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QU1cPGBqEcEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=black+panther+clinic+alondra+nelson#v=snippet&amp;q=clinics&amp;f=false|title=Body and Soul: The Black Panther Party and the Fight Against Medical Discrimination|last=Nelson|first=Alondra|date=2011-01-01|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=9781452933221|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international impact of the movement includes the [[Black Power Revolution]] in Trinidad and Tobago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-and-social-reform/social-reform/black-power-movement|title=Black power movement facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Black power movement|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While black American thinkers such as [[Robert F. Williams]] and [[Malcolm X]] influenced the early Black Power movement, the [[Black Panther Party]] and its views are widely seen as the cornerstone. It was influenced by philosophies such as [[pan-Africanism]], [[black nationalism]] and [[socialism]], as well as contemporary events like the [[Cuban Revolution]] and the [[decolonization of Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Komozi Woodard, [http://exhibitions.nypl.org/africanaage/essay-black-power.html "Rethinking the Black Power Movement"], Africana Age.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the movement's peak in the early 1970s, some of its more militant leaders were killed during conflicts with police, prompting many activists to abandon the movement.

==Background==
{{Main|Civil Rights Movement}}
The first popular use of the term "Black Power" as a social and racial slogan was by [[Stokely Carmichael]] (later known as Kwame Ture) and Willie Ricks (later known as Mukasa Dada), both organizers and spokespersons for the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]]. On June 16, 1966, in a speech in [[Greenwood, Mississippi]], during the [[March Against Fear]], Carmichael led the marchers in a chant for black power that was televised nationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hasan Jeffries|title=Bloody Lowndes: Civil Rights and Black Power in Alabama's Black Belt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XFWVLK4_PCoC&amp;pg=PA187|year=2010|publisher=NYU Press|page=187|isbn=9780814743065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1960s, Black Power came to represent the demand for more immediate violent action to counter American white supremacy. Most of these ideas were influenced by [[Malcolm X]]'s criticism of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s peaceful protest methods. The 1965 assassination of Malcolm X coupled with the urban uprisings of 1964 and 1965 ignited the movement. New organizations that supported Black Power philosophies ranging from [[socialism]] to [[black nationalism]], including the [[Black Panther Party]], grew to prominence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Black_power_movement.aspx|title=Black power movement facts, information, pictures - Encyclopedia.com articles about Black power movement|website=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of the Black Power movement}}

===Beginning in the early 1960s===
The organization [[Nation of Islam]] began as a [[black nationalist]] movement in the 1930s, inspiring later groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muhammad|first=Tynetta|title=Nation of Islam History|url=http://www.noi.org/noi-history|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm X is largely credited with the group's dramatic increase in membership between the early 1950s and early 1960s (from 500 to 25,000 by one estimate; from 1,200 to 50,000 or 75,000 by another).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lomax |first=Louis E. |authorlink=Louis Lomax |title=When the Word Is Given: A Report on Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm X, and the Black Muslim World |year=1963 |publisher=World Publishing |location=Cleveland |oclc=1071204 |pages=15â16 |quote=Estimates of the Black Muslim membership vary from a quarter of a million down to fifty thousand. Available evidence indicates that about one hundred thousand Negroes have joined the movement at one time or another, but few objective observers believe that the Black Muslims can muster more than twenty or twenty-five thousand active temple people. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marable |first=Manning |authorlink=Manning Marable |title=[[Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention]] |location=New York |publisher=Viking |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-670-02220-5 |page=123 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1964, Malcolm X left the Nation due to disagreements with [[Elijah Muhammad]]; among other things, he cited his interest in working with other civil rights leaders, saying that Muhammad had prevented him from doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/03/09/archives/malcolm-x-splits-with-muhammad-suspended-muslim-leader-plans-black.html |title=Malcolm X Splits with Muhammad |last=Handler |first=M. S. |date=March 9, 1964 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=September 22, 2017 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Malcolm X also said Muhammad had engaged in extramarital affairs with young Nation secretaries{{mdashb}}a serious violation of the group's teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perry |first=Bruce |title=Malcolm: The Life of a Man Who Changed Black America |year=1991 |publisher=Station Hill |location=Barrytown, N.Y. |isbn=978-0-88268-103-0 |pages=230â234}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 21, 1965, Malcolm X was shot and killed while speaking at the Audubon Ballroom in Washington Heights, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/malcolm-x-assassinated|title=Malcolm X Assassinated|accessdate=September 20, 2017|date=2009|publisher=History.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three Nation members were convicted of assassinating him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1966/03/11/archives/malcolm-x-jury-finds-3-guilty-2-black-muslims-and-3d-man-convicted.html|title=Malcolm X Jury Finds 3 Guilty|accessdate=October 2, 2014|last=Buckley|first=Thomas|date=March 11, 1966|work=The New York Times|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1966/04/15/archives/3-get-life-terms-in-malcolm-case-sentenced-for-1965-murder-of-black.html |title=3 Get Life Terms in Malcolm Case|accessdate=October 2, 2014|last=Roth|first=Jack|date=April 15, 1966|work=The New York Times|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/02/21/malcolm-x-anniversary-death/23764967/|title=Quotes: Half a century after his death, Malcolm X speaks|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-07-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Watts riots]] in [[Los Angeles]] in 1965, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee decided to break its ties with the mainstream civil rights movement. They argued that blacks needed to build power of their own, rather than seek accommodations from the power structure in place. SNCC migrated from a philosophy of nonviolence to one of greater militancy after the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=|title=Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/569887/Student-Nonviolent-Coordinating-Committee-SNCC&gt;.|website=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Online|accessdate=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization established ties with radical groups such as the [[Students for a Democratic Society]].

In late October 1966, [[Huey P. Newton]] and [[Bobby Seale]] founded the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense. In formulating a new politics, they drew on their experiences working with a variety of Black Power organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Seale, 1970, part I; Newton, 1973, parts 2-3; Bloom and Martin, 2013, chapter 1; Murch, 2010, part II and chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Focus on education ===
The Black Panther Party's [[Ten-Point Program]] included point five, "We want education for our people that exposes the true nature of this decadent American society. We want education that teaches us our true history and our role in the present day society."  This sentiment was echoed in many of the other Black Power organizations; the inadequacy of black education had earlier been remarked on by [[W.E.B. Du Bois]],  [[Marcus Garvey]], and [[Carter G. Woodson]].

With this backdrop, Stokely Carmichael brought political education into his work with SNCC in the rural South. This included get-out-the-vote campaigns&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Ture|first1=Kwame|last2=Hamilton|first2=Charles V.|date=1992|title=Black Power: the Politics of Liberation in America|location=New York|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=0679743138|oclc=26096713|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; and political literacy. Bobby Seale and Huey Newton used education to address the lack of identity in the black community. Seale had worked with youth in an after-school program before starting the Panthers. Through this new education and identity building, they believed they could empower black Americans to claim their freedom.

===Escalation in the late 1960s===
The Black Panther Party initially utilized [[Open carry in the United States|open-carry gun laws]] to protect party members and local black communities from law enforcement. Party members also recorded incidents of police brutality by distantly following police cars around neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom and Martin, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers grew slightly starting in February 1967, when the party provided an armed escort at the San Francisco airport for [[Betty Shabazz]], Malcolm X's widow and keynote speaker at conference held in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;Black Panther Newspaper'', May 15, 1967, p. 3; Bloom and Martin, 71â72.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1967, the SNCC began to fall apart due to policy disputes in its leadership and many members left for the Black Panthers.&lt;ref&gt;C. Gerald Fraser, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19681008&amp;id=WNhVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=H-EDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6905,1709713 "SNCC Has Lost Much of Its Power to Black Panthers"], ''New York Times'' news service (''Eugene Register-Guard''), October 9, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout 1967 the Panthers staged rallies and disrupted the California State Assembly with armed marchers.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, 129.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1967 the [[FBI]] developed [[COINTELPRO]] to investigate black nationalist groups and other civil rights leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Stohl, 249.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1969, the Black Panthers and their allies had become primary COINTELPRO targets, singled out in 233 of the 295 authorized "black nationalist" COINTELPRO actions. In 1968 the [[Republic of New Afrika]] was founded, a separatist group seeking a black country in the southern United States, only to dissolve by the early 1970s.

By 1968, many Black Panther leaders had been arrested, including founder Huey Newton for the murder of a police officer (Newton's proseuction was eventually dismissed), yet membership surged. Black Panthers later engaged the police in a firefight in a Los Angeles gas station. In the same year, Martin Luther King Jr. [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|was assassinated]], creating [[King assassination riots|nationwide riots]], the widest wave of social unrest since the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.temple.edu/tempress/chapters_1800/2148_ch1.pdf Peter B. Levy], ''Baltimore '68'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Cleveland]], Ohio, the "Republic of New Libya" engaged the police in the [[Glenville shootout]], which was followed by rioting.&lt;ref name="SHOOTOUT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ech.case.edu/cgi/article.pl?id=GS1|title=Glenville Shootout â The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History|date=March 27, 1998|work=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History|publisher=A joint effort by Case Western University and the Western Reserve Historical Society|accessdate=February 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The year also marked the start of the [[White Panther Party]], a group of whites dedicated to the cause of the Black Panthers. Founders [[Pun Plamondon]] and [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]] were arrested, but eventually freed, in connection to the bombing of a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] office in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] that September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zbrozek|first=C|title=The bombing of the A2 CIA office|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/content/bombing-a2-cia-office|accessdate=April 22, 2013|newspaper=Michigan Daily|date=October 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1969, the Black Panthers began purging members due to fear of law enforcement infiltration and engaged in multiple gunfights with police, and one with a black nationalist organization. The Panthers continued their "Free Huey" campaign internationally. In the spirit of rising militancy, the [[League of Revolutionary Black Workers]] was formed in Detroit, which supported [[labor rights]] and black liberation.

===Peak in the early 1970s===
In 1970 the Honorary Prime Minister of the Black Panther Party, Stokely Carmichael, traveled to various countries to discuss methods to resist "[[American imperialism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, Peniel E. Waiting 'Til the Midnight Hour: A Narrative History of Black Power in America. Henry Holt and Company, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In Trinidad, the black power movement had escalated into the [[Black Power Revolution]] in which many Afro-Trinidadians forced the government of Trinidad to give into reforms. Later many Panthers visited Algeria to discuss [[Pan-Africanism]] and anti-imperialism. In the same year former Black Panthers formed the [[Black Liberation Army]] to continue a violent revolution rather than the party's new reform movements.&lt;ref&gt;Marie-AgnÃ¨s Combesque, [http://mondediplo.com/2005/10/14blackpanthers "Caged panthers"], ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 22, 1970, the Black Liberation Army is believed to have planted a bomb in St. Brendan's Church in San Francisco while it was full of mourners attending the funeral of San Francisco police officer Harold Hamilton, who had been killed in the line of duty while responding to a [[bank robbery]]. The bomb was detonated, but no one in the church suffered serious injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Van Derbeken and Lagos. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/01/23/BAGRKNNFV04.DTL "Ex-militants charged in S.F. police officer's '71 slaying at station"], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' (January 23, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, several Panther officials fled the U.S. due to police concerns. This was the only active year of the [[Black Revolutionary Assault Team]], a group that bombed the New York South African [[consular office]] in protest of [[apartheid]]. On September 20 it placed bombs at the [[Diplomatic mission|UN Missions]] of [[Republic of the Congo (LÃ©opoldville)|Republic of the Congo (Kinshasa)]] and the [[Republic of Malawi]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward F. Mickolaus, ''Transnational Terrorism: a chronology of events'', Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 1980, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1971, ideological splits within the Black Panther Party between leaders Newton and [[Eldridge Cleaver]] led to two factions within the party; the conflict turned violent and four people were killed in a series of assassinations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Donald Cox, "Split in the Party", ''New Political Science'', Vol. 21, No. 2, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 21, 1971, five Black Liberation Army members participated in the shootings of two New York City police officers, Joseph Piagentini and Waverly Jones. Those brought to trial for the shootings include [[Jalil Muntaqim|Anthony Bottom (also known as Jalil Muntaqim)]], Albert Washington, Francisco Torres, Gabriel Torres, and Herman Bell.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

1972 was the year Newton shut down many Black Panther chapters and held a party meeting in [[Oakland]], California. On January 27, the Black Liberation Army assassinated police officers Gregory Foster and Rocco Laurie in New York City. After the killings, a note sent to authorities portrayed the murders as a retaliation for the prisoner deaths during 1971 Attica prison riot. To date no arrests have been made.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}  In the same year, [[MOVE]] was founded and engaged in demonstrations for environmentalism and black power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Louise Leaphart James|title=John Africa...Childhood Untold Until Today|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UdrTAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR13&amp;lpg=PR13&amp;dq=john+africa+functionally+illiterate#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20africa%20functionally%20illiterate&amp;f=false|website=|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|date=2013|accessdate=April 17, 2015|isbn=9781483637884}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} On July 31, five armed BLA members [[aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] [[Delta Air Lines Flight 841]], eventually collecting a ransom of $1 million and diverting the plane, after passengers were released, to Algeria.

===Deescalation in the late 1970s===
In the late 1970s a rebel group named after the killed prisoner formed the [[George Jackson Brigade]]. From March 1975 to December 1977, the Brigade robbed at least seven banks and detonated about 20 pipe bombs â mainly targeting government buildings, electric power facilities, Safeway stores, and companies accused of racism. In 1977, Newton returned from exile in Cuba. Shortly afterward, Elaine Brown resigned from the party and fled to Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 444â50.&lt;/ref&gt; The Party fell apart, leaving only a few members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/14/archives/coast-inquiries-pick-panthers-as-target-murder-attempted-murders.html |title=Coast Inquiries Pick Panthers As Target; Murder, Attempted Murders and Financing of Poverty Programs Under Oakland Investigation | journal=New York Times |date=December 14, 1977 |first=Wallace |last=Turner }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another high-profile incident of the [[Black Liberation Army]], [[Assata Shakur]], Zayd Shakur and [[Sundiata Acoli]] were said to have opened fire on state troopers in New Jersey after being pulled over for a broken taillight. Zayd Shakur and state trooper Werner Foerster were both killed during the exchange. Following her capture, Assata Shakur was tried in six different criminal trials. According to Shakur, she was beaten and tortured during her incarceration in a number of different federal and state prisons. The charges ranged from kidnapping to assault and battery to bank robbery. Assata Shakur was found guilty of the murder of both Foerster and her companion Zayd Shakur, but escaped prison in 1979 and eventually fled to Cuba and received political asylum. Acoli was convicted of killing Foerster and sentenced to life in prison.

In 1978 a group of Black Liberation Army and [[Weather Underground]] members formed named the [[May 19th Communist Organization]], or M19CO.  It also included members of the Black Panthers and the Republic of New Africa.&lt;ref name="osti.gov"&gt;{{cite book |title=  LEFT-WING EXTREMISM: The Current Threat Prepared for U.S. Department of Energy Office of Safeguards and Security

===Decline in the 1980s===
Over the 1980s the Black Power movement continued despite a decline in its popularity and organization memberships. The Black Liberation Army was active in the US until at least 1981 when a [[Brinks robbery (1981)|Brinks truck robbery]], conducted with support from former Weather Underground members [[Kathy Boudin]] and [[David Gilbert (activist)|David Gilbert]], left a guard and two police officers dead.

They targeted a series of government and commercial buildings, [[1983 United States Senate bombing|including the U.S. Senate]]. On November 3, 1984, two members of the M19CO, [[Susan Rosenberg]] and Timothy Blunk, were arrested at a mini-warehouse they had rented in [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey]]. Police recovered more than 100 blasting caps, nearly 200 sticks of dynamite, more than 100 cartridges of gel explosive, and 24 bags of blasting agent from the warehouse. The M19CO alliance's last bombing was on February 23, 1985, at the Policemen's Benevolent Association in New York City.

After the 1970s the Black Power movement saw a decline, but not an end. In the year 1998 the [[Black Radical Congress]] was founded, with debatable effects. The [[Black Riders Liberation Party]] was created by [[Bloods]] and [[Crips]] gang members as an attempt to recreate the Black Panther Party in 1996. The group has spread, creating chapters in cities across the United States, and frequently staging [[paramilitary]] marches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workers.org/ww/1999/aryana1125.php|title=Workers World Nov. 25, 1999: Black Riders show resistance is possible|website=Workers.org|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]] New Black Panther Party members were [[New Black Panther Party voter intimidation case|accused voter intimidation]] at a polling station in a predominantly black, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] voting district of Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="CBS1"&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20011791-503544.html "Republicans Push For New Black Panther Hearing"].

Some have compared the modern movement [[Black Lives Matter]] to the Black Power movement, noting its similarities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wearemany.org/v/from-black-power-to-black-lives-matter|title=From Black Power to Black Lives Matter|website=Wearemany.org|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
Just as Black Power activists focused on community control of schools and politics, the movement took a major interest in creating and controlling its own media institutions.  Most famously, the Black Panther Party produced the Black Panther newspaper, which proved to be one of the BPP's most influential tools for disseminating its message and recruiting new members.

WAFR was launched in September 1971 as the first public, community-based black radio station. The Durham, North Carolina, station broadcast until 1976, but influenced later activist radio stations including WPFW in Washington, D.C. and WRFG in Atlanta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediaandthemovement.unc.edu/tag/wafr/|title=WAFR - Media and the Movement|website=mediaandthemovement.unc.edu|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Black nationalism''' is a type of [[nationalism]] or [[pan-nationalism]] in the [[United States]] which seeks to promote, develop and maintain a black [[national identity]] for people of black ancestry.&lt;ref name=britannica /&gt;

Black nationalist activism revolves around social, political, and economic empowerment of black communities and people, especially to resist assimilation into white American culture (through [[Racial integration|integration]] or otherwise), and maintain a distinct black identity.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/black-nationalism|title=black nationalism {{!}} United States history|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
{{close paraphrase|date=May 2018}}
[[Martin Delany]] (1812â1885), an [[African-American]] [[abolitionist]], was the grandfather of black nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraries.wvu.edu/delany/home.htm Libraries.wvu.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425074314/http://www.libraries.wvu.edu/delany/home.htm |date=2009-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the success of the [[Haitian Revolution]], the origins of Black and indigenous African nationalism in political thought lie in the 19th and early 20th centuries with people like [[Marcus Garvey]], [[Benjamin "Pap" Singleton]], [[Henry McNeal Turner]], [[Martin Delany]], [[Henry Highland Garnet]], [[Edward Wilmot Blyden]], [[Paul Cuffe]], etc. The repatriation of African-American slaves to [[Liberia]] or [[Sierra Leone]] was a common black nationalist theme in the 19th century. [[Marcus Garvey]]'s [[Universal Negro Improvement Association]] of the 1910s and 1920s was the most powerful black nationalist movement to date, claiming millions of members. Garvey's movement was opposed by mainline black leaders, and crushed by government action. However its many alumni remembered its inspiring rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Van Deburg, ed., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=A7QUCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover Modern Black Nationalism: From Marcus Garvey to Louis Farrakhan]'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Wilson Jeremiah Moses]], black nationalism as a philosophy can be examined from three different periods. giving rise to various ideological perspectives for what we can today consider black nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson Jeremiah Moses, ''Classical Black Nationalism'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first period of pre-classical black nationalism began when the first Africans were brought to the Americas as slaves through the [[American Revolution|American Revolutionary]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myblackhistory.net/Black%20Nationalism.htm|title=Black Nationalism: The history of African Americans|last=XXXXX|website=www.myblackhistory.net|language=en|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second period of black nationalism began after the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. This period refers to the time when a sizeable number of educated Africans within the colonies  (specifically within New England and Pennsylvania) had become disgusted with the social conditions that arose out of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s ideas.{{Clarify|date=August 2015}} From this way of thinking came the rise of individuals within the black community who sought to create organizations that would unite black people. The intention of these organizations was to group black people together so they could voice their concerns, and help their own community advance itself. This form of thinking can be found in historical personalities such as; [[Prince Hall]], [[Richard Allen (bishop)|Richard Allen]] and [[Absalom Jones]], [[James Forten]], Cyrus Bustill, William Gray through their need to become founders of certain organizations such as African Masonic lodges, the [[Free African Society]], and Church Institutions such as the [[African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas]]. These institutions served as early foundations to developing independent and separate organizations for their own people. The goal was to create groups was to include those who so many times had been excluded from (exclusively) white community and government-funded organizations.

The third period of black nationalism arose during the post[[Reconstruction Era|-Reconstruction]] era, particularly among various African-American clergy circles. Separated circles were already established and accepted because African-Americans had long endured the [[Racial segregation in the United States|oppression]] of slavery and [[Jim Crow]]ism in the United States since its inception. The clerical phenomenon led to the birth of a modern form of black nationalism that stressed the need to separate blacks from non-blacks and build separate communities that would promote racial pride and collectivize resources. The new ideology became the philosophy of groups like the [[Moorish Science Temple]] and the [[Nation of Islam]]. By 1930, Wallace [[Wallace Fard Muhammad|Fard Muhammad]] had founded the Nation of Islam. His method to spread information about the Nation of Islam used unconventional tactics to recruit individuals in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. Later on, [[Elijah Muhammad]] would lead the Nation of Islam and become a mentor to people like [[Malcolm X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=aas_theses|title=PERCEPTIONS AND EXPERIENCES IN ELIJAH MUHAMMADâS ECONOMIC PROGRAM: VOICES FROM THE PIONEERS|last=Muhammad|first=Nafessa|date=May 2010|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the 1960s brought a period of heightened religious, cultural and political nationalism, it was black nationalism that would lead the promotion of [[Afrocentrism]].

=== Prince Hall ===
[[Prince Hall]] was an important social leader of Boston following the Revolutionary War. He is well known for his contribution as the founder of Black Freemasonry. His life and past are unclear, but he is believed to have been a former slave freed after twenty one years of slavehood. In 1775 fifteen other black men along with Hall joined a freemason lodge of British soldiers, after the departure of the soldiers they created their own lodge African Lodge #1 and were granted full stature in 1784. Despite their stature other white freemason lodges in America didnât treat them equal and so Hall began to help other black Masonic lodges across the country to help their own cause.(To progress as a community together despite any difficulties brought to them by racists). Hall was best recognized for his contribution to the black community along with his petitions ( many denied) in the name of black nationalism. In 1787 he unsuccessfully petitioned to the Massachusetts legislature to send blacks back to Africa(to obtain âcompleteâ freedom from white supremacy). In 1788, Hall was a well known contributor to the passing of the legislation of the outlawing of the slave-trade and those involved. Hall continued his efforts to help his community, and in 1796 his petition for Boston to approve funding for black schools. Despite the cityâs inability to provide a building, Hall lent his building for the school to run from. Until his death in 1807, Hall continued to work for black rights in issues of abolition, civil rights and the advancement of the community overall.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/aah/hall-prince-c-1735-1807|title=Hall, Prince (c. 1735-1807) {{!}} The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed|website=www.blackpast.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Free African Society ==
{{Main|Free African Society}}
In 1787 Richard Allen and Absalom Jones black ministers of Pennsylvania and formed the Free African Society of Pennsylvania. The goal of this organization was to create a church that was free of restrictions of only one form of religion, and to pave the way for the creation of a house of worship exclusive to their community (which in 1793 they were successful in doing, creating the St. Thomas African Episcopal Church). The community included many members who were notably abolitionist men and former slaves. Allen following his own beliefs that worship should be out loud and outspoken left the organization two years later. With the re an opportunity to become the pastor to the church but rejected the offer leaving it to Jones. The society itself was a memorable charitable organization that allowed its members to socialize and network with other business partners, in attempt to better their community. Its activity and open doors served as a motivational growth for the city as many other black mutual aid societies in the city began to pop up. Additionally the society is well known for their aid during the yellow fever epidemic in 1793 known to have taken the life of many of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/aah/free-african-society-philadelphia-1787|title=Free African Society of Philadelphia (1787-   ?) {{!}} The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed|website=www.blackpast.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania ==
{{Main|African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas}}
The African Church or the African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was founded in 1792 for those of African descent, as a foster church for the community with the goal to be interdenominational. In the beginning of the church's establishment its masses were held in homes and local schools. One of the founders of the Free African Society was also the first Episcopal priest of African American descent, Absalom Jones. The original church house was constructed at 5th and Adelphi Streets in Philadelphia, now St. James Place, and it was dedicated on July 17, 1794 other locations of the church included: 12th Street near Walnut, 57th and Pearl Streets, 52nd and Parrish Streets, and the current location, Overbrook and Lancaster Avenue in Philadelphiaâs historic Overbrook Farms neighborhood. The church is mostly African American. The church and its members have played a key role in the abolition/anti-slavery and equal rights movement of the 1800s.

âSince 1960 St. Thomas has been involved in the local and national civil rights movement through its work with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ([[NAACP]]), the Union of Black Episcopalians, the Opportunities Industrialization Center (OIC), Philadelphia Interfaith Action, and The Episcopal Church Women. Most importantly, it has been in the forefront of the movement to uphold the knowledge and value of the black presence in the Episcopal Church. Today, that tradition continues with a still-growing membership through a host of ministries such as Christian Formation, the Chancel Choir, Gospel Choir, Jazz Ensemble, Menâs Fellowship, Young Adult and Youth Ministries, a Church School, Health Ministry, Caring Ministry, and a Shepherding Program.â&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The basis of the group was the belief that Christianity was exclusively a White man's religion, while Islam was the way for black folk; Christianity was a religion that, like slavery itself, was forced upon the people who suffered at the hands of the whites during their enslavement. The beliefs of the members of the Nation of Islam are similar to others who follow the Quran and worship Allah under the religion of Islam. Founded on resentment of the way Whites historically treated people of color, the Nation of Islam embraces the ideas of black nationalism. The group itself has, since the leadership of Elijah Muhammad, recruited thousands of followers from all segments of society: from prisons, as well as from [[black pride]] and black nationalist movements. Members of the Nation of Islam preached that the goal was not to integrate into White American culture, but rather to create their own cultural footprint and their own separate community in order to obliterate oppression. Their aim was to have their own schools and churches and to support each other without any reliance on other racial groups. The members of the Nation of Islam are known as Black Muslims. As the group became more and more prominent with public figures such as [[Malcolm X]] as its orators, it received increasing attention from outsiders. In 1959 the group was the subject of a documentary named ''[[The Hate that Hate Produced]]''. The documentary cast the organization in a negative light, depicting it as a [[black supremacy]] group. Even with such depictions, the group did not lose support from its people. When Elijah Muhammad died, his son took on the role as the leader of the Nation of Islam, converting the organization into a more orthodox iteration of Islam and abandoning beliefs that tended toward violence. This conversion prompted others to abandon the group, dissatisfied with the change in ideology. They created a âNewâ Nation of Islam in order to restore the aims of the original organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/aah/nation-islam-1930|title=Nation of Islam (1930â  ) {{!}} The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed|website=www.blackpast.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/54h.asp|title=Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam [ushistory.org]|last=ushistory.org|website=www.ushistory.org|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] classifies the Nation of Islam as a [[hate group]], stating: "Its theology of innate black superiority over whites and the deeply racist, antisemitic and anti-LGBT rhetoric of its leaders have earned the NOI a prominent position in the ranks of organized hate."&lt;ref name="Nation of Islam"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/nation-islam|title=Nation of Islam|publisher=Splcenter.org|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Farrakhan]] currently leads the group.

== Elijah Muhammad ==
{{Main|Elijah Muhammad}}
Elijah Muhammad was famously known as the successor of Wallace Fard, the founder of the Nation of Islam. He was born in Georgia on October 7, 1897. He led the group from 1934-1975, being very well recognized as one of the mentors to other famous leaders such as Malcolm X. He lived until February 25, 1975 in Chicago, and the leadership of the organization passed to his son.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/elijah-muhammad-9417458|title=Elijah Muhammad|website=Biography.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==

===Marcus Garvey===
{{Main|Marcus Garvey}}
[[Marcus Garvey]] encouraged African people around the world to be proud of their race and see beauty in their own kind. This form of black nationalism later became known as [[Garveyism]]. A central idea to Garveyism was that African people in every part of the world were one people and they would never advance if they did not put aside their cultural and ethnic differences and unite under their own shared history. He was heavily influenced by the earlier works of [[Booker T. Washington]], [[Martin Delany]], and [[Henry McNeal Turner]].&lt;ref name=Skyers&gt;Skyers, Sophia Teresa (1982). ''[http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/9/ Marcus Garvey and the philosophy of black pride]'' (M.A. thesis), Wilfrid Laurier University.&lt;/ref&gt; Garvey used his own personal magnetism and the understanding of black psychology and the psychology of confrontation to create a movement that challenged bourgeois blacks for the minds and souls of African Americans. Marcus Garvey's return to America had to do with his desire to meet with the man who inspired him most, [[Booker T. Washington]] but unfortunately Garvey did not return in time to meet Washington. Despite this, Garvey moved forward with his efforts and two years later, a year after Washington's death, Garvey established a similar organization in America known as the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League|United Negro Improvement Association]] otherwise known as the UNIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=Elwood|title=Marcus Garvey's Garveyism: Message from a forefather|journal=Journal of Religious Thought|date=Winter 1994 â Spring 1995|volume= 51|issue= 2 |page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garvey's beliefs are articulated in ''The Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey'' as well as ''Message To The People: The Course of [[African philosophy|African Philosophy]]''[[African philosophy|.]]

===Malcolm X===
Between 1953 and 1964, while most African leaders worked in the [[civil rights movement]] to integrate [[African-American]] people into mainstream American life, [[Malcolm X]] was an avid advocate of black independence and the reclaiming of black pride and masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Harris, "Malcolm X: Critical Assessments and Unanswered Questions." ''Journal of African American History'' 98.4 (2013): 595-601.&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that there was hypocrisy in the purported values of [[Western culture]] â from its [[Judeo-Christian]] religious traditions to American political and economic institutions â and its inherently racist actions. He maintained that [[separatism]] and control of politics, and economics within its own community would serve blacks better than the tactics of civil rights leader [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and mainstream civil rights groups such as the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]], [[SNCC]], [[NAACP]], and [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]]. Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X declared that nonviolence was the "philosophy of the fool," and that to achieve anything, African Americans would have to reclaim their national identity, embrace the rights covered by the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]], and defend themselves from white hegemony and extrajudicial violence. In response to Rev. [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King]]'s famous "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X quipped, "While King was having a dream, the rest of us Negroes are having a nightmare."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James H. Cone|title=Martin and Malcolm and America: A Dream or a Nightmare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PU_DdaFtYAMC&amp;pg=PT49|year=1992|publisher=Orbis Books|page=49|isbn=9781608330409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to his [[Hajj|pilgrimage to Mecca]], Malcolm X believed that African Americans must develop their own society and ethical values, including the self-help, community-based enterprises, that the [[Nation of Islam|black Muslim]]s supported. He also thought that [[African Americans]] should reject integration or cooperation with [[White people|whites]] until they could achieve internal cooperation and unity. He prophetically believed that there "would be bloodshed" if the [[racism]] problem in America remained ignored, and he renounced "compromise" with whites. In April 1964, Malcolm X participated in a [[Hajj]] (pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]); Malcolm found himself restructuring his views and recanted several extremist opinions during his shift to mainstream [[Islam]].

Malcolm X returned from Mecca with moderate views that included an abandonment of his commitment to racial separatism. However, he still supported black nationalism and advocated that African Americans in the United States act proactively in their campaign for equal [[human rights]], instead of relying on Caucasian citizens to change the laws that govern society. The tenets of Malcolm X's new philosophy are articulated in the charter of his [[Organization of Afro-American Unity]] (a [[secular]] [[Pan-Africanist]] group patterned after the [[Organization of African Unity]]), and he inspired some aspects of the future [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Manning Marable,  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RownbjVryWIC&amp;printsec=frontcover Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention]'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stokely Carmichael===
In the 1967 ''Black Power'', [[Stokely Carmichael]] introduces black nationalism. He illustrates the prosperity of the black race in the United States as being dependent on the implementation of black sovereignty. Under his theory, black nationalism in the United States would allow blacks to socially, economically and politically be empowered in a manner that has never been plausible in America history. A black nation would work to reverse the exploitation of the black race in America, as blacks would intrinsically work to benefit their own state of affairs. African Americans would function in an environment of running their own businesses, banks, government, media and so on and so forth. Black nationalism is the opposite of integration, and Carmichael contended integration is harmful to the black population. As blacks integrate to white communities they are perpetuating a system in which blacks are inferior to whites. Blacks would continue to function in an environment of being second class citizens, he believes, never reaching equity to white citizens. Stokley Carmichael uses the concept of black nationalism to promote an equality that would begin to dismantle institutional racism.

===Frantz Fanon===
While in France, [[Frantz Fanon]] wrote his first book, ''[[Black Skin, White Masks]],'' an analysis of the impact of colonial subjugation on the African psyche. This book was a very personal account of Fanonâs experience being black: as a man, an intellectual, and a party to a French education. Although Fanon wrote the book while still in France, most of his other work was written while in North Africa (in particular [[Algeria]]). It was during this time that he produced ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'' where Fanon analyzes the role of class, race, national culture and violence in the struggle for [[decolonization]]. In this work, Fanon expounded his views on the liberating role of violence for the colonized, as well as the general necessity of violence in the anti-colonial struggle. Both books established Fanon in the eyes of much of the [[Third World]] as one of the leading anti-colonial thinkers of the 20th century. In 1959 he compiled his essays on Algeria in a book called ''[[A Dying Colonialism|L'An Cinq: De la RÃ©volution AlgÃ©rienne]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David Macey, ''Frantz Fanon: a biography'' (Verso Books, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Norm R. Allen, Jr., former director of [[African Americans for Humanism]], calls black nationalism a "strange mixture of profound thought and patent nonsense".
&lt;blockquote&gt;On the one hand, Reactionary Black Nationalists (RBNs) advocate self-love, self-respect, self-acceptance, self-help, pride, unity, and so forth - much like the right-wingers who promote "traditional family values." But - also like the holier-than-thou right-wingers - RBNs promote bigotry, intolerance, hatred, sexism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, pseudo-science, irrationality, dogmatic historical revisionism, violence, and so forth.&lt;ref name="orange"&gt;[http://perso.orange.fr/centralparkattacks/ref11.html Document sans titre&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;] {{dead link|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Allen further criticizes black nationalists' strong "attraction for hardened prisoners and ex-cons", their encouragement of violence when other African-American individuals or groups are branded as "[[Uncle Tom|Toms]]," traitors, or "sellouts", the blatantly sexist stance and the similarities to white supremacist ideologies:&lt;blockquote&gt; Many RBNs routinely preach hate. Just as white supremacists have referred to African Americans as "devils," so have many RBNs referred to whites. White supremacists have verbally attacked gays, as have RBNs. White supremacists embrace paranoid conspiracy theories, as do their African counterparts. Many white supremacists and RBNs consistently deny that they are preaching hate, and blame the mainstream media for misrepresenting them. (A striking exception is the NOI's Khallid Muhammad, who, according to Gates, admitted in a taped speech titled "No Love for the Other Side," "Never will I say I am not anti-Semitic. I pray that God will kill my enemy and take him off the face of the planet.") Rather, they claim they are teaching "truth" and advocating the love of their own people, as though love of self and hatred of others are mutually exclusive positions. On the contrary, RBNs preach love of self and hatred of their enemies. (Indeed, it often seems that these groups are motivated more by hatred of their enemies than love of their people.)&lt;ref name=orange/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nigerian-born professor of History and Director of the African American Studies program at the University of Montana, [[Tunde Adeleke]], argues in his book ''"UnAfrican Americans: Nineteenth-Century Black Nationalists and the Civilizing Mission"'' that 19th-century African-American nationalism embodied the racist and paternalistic values of Euro-American culture and that black nationalist plans were not designed for the immediate benefit of Africans but to enhance their own fortunes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kentuckypress.com/viewbook.cfm?Category_ID=1&amp;Group=2&amp;ID=644 ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928044809/http://www.kentuckypress.com/viewbook.cfm?Category_ID=1&amp;Group=2&amp;ID=644 |date=2007-09-28 }}, kentuckypress.com; accessed March 30, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[epistemology]], a '''defeater''' is a [[belief]] B1 that is held to be incompatible with another belief B2, hence arguments or evidence supporting B1 can be used to refute B2.

An '''undercutting defeater''' is B1 such that B1 does not ''oppose'' B2, but rather that the ramifications of B1, ''were it possible'' to obtain, cast doubt on the premises for B2.

An '''opposing defeater''' is B1 such that B1 has a factual or otherwise claim that, were it to be obtained, would falsify B2.

[[Image:Eunicycle Trevor Blackwell.jpg|thumb]]

A '''Eunicycle''' is a computer-controlled, partially self-balancing, motorized [[unicycle]] invented by [[Trevor Blackwell]]. It uses a computer control system similar to the one used by the [[Segway HT]] that [[servos]] its wheel to balance itself by keeping the contact point of the wheel below the [[center of mass]] of the vehicle in the front-to-back direction. To balance from side to side, the rider must rotate the vehicle the same way a unicyclist does, enabling the balancing servo to balance in the new direction.

The Eunicycle is based on an [[open design]]; the engineering drawings and control software [[source code]] are available from the website.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15227">{{short description|Any cause that reduces reproductive success in a proportion of a population}}
{{evolutionary biology}}
Any cause that reduces reproductive success in a portion of a population potentially exerts '''evolutionary pressure''', '''selective pressure''' or '''selection pressure''', driving [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Natural selection"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_25|title=Natural selection|website=evolution.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; With sufficient pressure, inherited traits that mitigate its effectsâeven if they would be deleterious in other circumstancesâcan become widely spread through a population. It is a quantitative description of the amount of change occurring in processes investigated by [[evolutionary biology]], but the formal concept is often extended to other areas of research.

In [[population genetics]], selection pressure is usually expressed as a [[selection coefficient]].

== Amino acids selective pressure ==
It has been shown that putting an [[amino acid]] bio-synthesizing gene like ''HIS4'' gene under amino acid selective pressure in [[yeast]] causes enhancement of expression of [[adjacent gene]]s which is due to the transcriptional co-regulation of two adjacent genes in [[Eukaryota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/afpuc.2015.62.issue-2/afpuc-2015-0031/afpuc-2015-0031.xml?format=INT | title=Increased expression and secretion of recombinant hIFNÎ³ through amino acid starvation-induced selective pressure on the adjacent HIS4 gene in Pichia pastoris | author=Ali Razaghi|author2=Roger Huerlimann|author3=Leigh Owens|author4=Kirsten Heimann | journal=European Pharmaceutical Journal | year=2015 | volume=62 | issue=2 | pages=43â50 | doi=10.1515/afpuc-2015-0031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Antibiotic resistance ==
[[Drug resistance]] in bacteria is an example of an outcome of [[natural selection]].
When a drug is used on a species of bacteria, those that cannot resist die and do not produce offspring, while those that survive potentially pass on the resistance gene to the next generation (vertical gene transmission). The resistance gene can also be passed on to one bacterium by another of a different species (horizontal gene transmission). Because of this, the drug resistance increases over generations. For example, in hospitals, environments are created where pathogens such as ''C''. ''difficile'' have developed a resistance to antibiotics.&lt;ref name="Dawson"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dawson L.F., Valiente E., Wren B.W. | year = 2009 | title = Clostridium'' ''difficile''âA continually evolving and problematic pathogen. Infections | url = | journal = Genetics and Evolution | volume = 9 | issue = 6| pages = 1410â1417 | doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2009.06.005| pmid = 19539054 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibiotic resistance is made worse by the misuse of antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance is encouraged when antibiotics are used to treat non-bacterial diseases, and when antibiotics are not used for the prescribed amount of time or in the prescribed dose.&lt;ref name="Brown 1999 385â399"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Joel S.|last2=LaundrÃ©|first2=John W.|last3=Gurung|first3=Mahesh|date=1999|title=The Ecology of Fear: Optimal Foraging, Game Theory, and Trophic Interactions|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|volume=80|issue=2|pages=385â399|doi=10.2307/1383287|jstor=1383287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibiotic resistance may arise out of standing genetic variation in a population or de novo mutations in the population. Either pathway could lead to antibiotic resistance, which may be a form of [[evolutionary rescue]].

===Nosocomial infections===
''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]'', [[gram-positive bacteria]] species that inhabits the gut of mammals, exemplifies one type of bacteria that is a major cause of death by nosocomial infections.&lt;ref name="Dawson"/&gt;

When symbiotic [[gut flora]] populations are disrupted (e.g., by [[antibiotics]]), one becomes more vulnerable to pathogens. The rapid evolution of [[antibiotic resistance]] places an enormous selective pressure on the advantageous alleles of resistance passed down to future generations.  The [[Red Queen hypothesis]] shows that the evolutionary arms race between pathogenic bacteria and humans is a constant battle for evolutionary advantages in outcompeting each other. The evolutionary arms race between the rapidly evolving virulence factors of the bacteria and the treatment practices of modern medicine requires evolutionary biologists to understand the mechanisms of resistance in these pathogenic bacteria, especially considering the growing number of infected hospitalized patients. The evolved virulence factors pose a threat to patients in hospitals, who are immunocompromised from illness or antibiotic treatment. Virulence factors are the characteristics that the evolved bacteria have developed to increase pathogenicity. One of the virulence factors of ''C''. ''difficile'' that largely constitutes its resistance to antibiotics is its toxins: enterotoxin TcdA and cytotoxin TcdB.&lt;ref name="Terrier"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Terrier M. C. Z., Simonet M. L., Bichard P., Frossard J. L. | year = 2014 | title = Recurrent ''Clostridium difficile'' infections: The importance of the intestinal microbiota | journal = World Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 20 | issue = 23| pages = 7416â7423 | doi = 10.3748/wjg.v20.i23.7416 | pmid = 24966611 | pmc = 4064086 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Toxins produce spores that are difficult to inactivate and remove from the environment. This is especially true in hospitals where an infected patient's room may contain spores for up to 20 weeks.&lt;ref name="Wang 1860"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Guo-dong|last2=Zhai|first2=Weiwei|last3=Yang|first3=He-chuan|last4=Fan|first4=Ruo-xi|last5=Cao|first5=Xue|last6=Zhong|first6=Li|last7=Wang|first7=Lu|last8=Liu|first8=Fei|last9=Wu|first9=Hong|date=2013-05-14|title=The genomics of selection in dogs and the parallel evolution between dogs and humans|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2814|journal=Nature Communications|language=En|volume=4|pages=1860|doi=10.1038/ncomms2814|pmid=23673645}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combating the threat of the rapid spread of CDIs is therefore dependent on hospital sanitation practices removing spores from the environment. A study published in the ''American Journal of Gastroenterology'' found that to control the spread of CDIs glove use, hand hygiene, disposable thermometers and disinfection of the environment are necessary practices in health facilities.&lt;ref name="Ostrander 117â124"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ostrander|first=Elaine A|last2=Galibert|first2=Francis|last3=Patterson|first3=Donald F|date=2000-03-01|title=Canine genetics comes of age|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168952599019587|journal=Trends in Genetics|volume=16|issue=3|pages=117â124|doi=10.1016/S0168-9525(99)01958-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The virulence of this pathogen is remarkable and may take a radical change at sanitation approaches used in hospitals to control CDI outbreaks.

== Natural selection in humans ==
The [[Malaria]] parasite can exert a selective pressure on populations. This pressure has led to [[natural selection]] for [[erythrocytes]] carrying the [[sickle cell]] [[hemoglobin]] [[gene]] [[mutation]] ([[Hemoglobin|Hb]] S)âcausing [[sickle cell anaemia]]âin areas where [[malaria]] is a major health concern, because the condition grants some resistance to this infectious disease.&lt;ref name="Parker 697â708"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=Heidi G.|last2=Dreger|first2=Dayna L.|last3=Rimbault|first3=Maud|last4=Davis|first4=Brian W.|last5=Mullen|first5=Alexandra B.|last6=Carpintero-Ramirez|first6=Gretchen|last7=Ostrander|first7=Elaine A.|date=2017-04-25|title=Genomic Analyses Reveal the Influence of Geographic Origin, Migration, and Hybridization on Modern Dog Breed Development|url=http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(17)30456-4|journal=Cell Reports|language=English|volume=19|issue=4|pages=697â708|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2017.03.079|pmid=28445722|pmc=5492993|issn=2211-1247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resistance to herbicides and pesticides ==
{{Further|Pesticide resistance}}
{{refimprove section|date=July 2016}}

Just as with the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, resistance to pesticides and herbicides has begun to appear with commonly used agricultural chemicals. For example:
* In the US, studies have shown that fruit flies that infest orange groves were becoming resistant to [[malathion]], a pesticide used to kill them.
* In Hawaii and Japan, the [[diamondback moth]] developed a resistance to ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'', which is used in several commercial crops including [[Bt corn]], about three years after it began to be used heavily.
* In England, rats in certain areas have developed such a strong resistance to rat poison that they can consume up to five times as much of it as normal rats without dying.
* [[DDT]] is no longer effective in controlling [[mosquito]]es that transmit [[malaria]] in some places, a fact that contributed to a resurgence of the disease.
* In the southern United States, the weed ''[[Amaranthus palmeri]]'', which interferes with production of cotton, has developed widespread resistance to the herbicide [[glyphosate]].
* In the [[Baltic Sea]], decreases in salinity has encouraged the emergence of a new species of brown seaweed, ''[[Fucus radicans]]''.&lt;ref name="Lindblad-Toh 803â819"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindblad-Toh|first=Kerstin|last2=members|first2=Broad Sequencing Platform|last3=Wade|first3=Claire M|last4=Mikkelsen|first4=Tarjei S.|last5=Karlsson|first5=Elinor K.|last6=Jaffe|first6=David B.|last7=Kamal|first7=Michael|last8=Clamp|first8=Michele|last9=Chang|first9=Jean L.|date=December 2005|title=Genome sequence, comparative analysis and haplotype structure of the domestic dog|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04338|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=438|issue=7069|pages=803â819|doi=10.1038/nature04338|pmid=16341006|issn=1476-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Humans exerting evolutionary pressure ==
Human activity can lead to unintended changes in the environment. The human activity will have a possible negative effect on a certain population, causing many individuals from said population to die due to not being adapted to this new pressure. The individuals that are better adapted to this new pressure will survive and reproduce at a higher rate than those who are at a disadvantage. This occurs over many generations until the population as a whole is better adapted to the pressure.&lt;ref name="Natural selection"/&gt; This is natural selection at work, but the pressure is coming from man-made activity such as building roads or hunting.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Charles R.|last2=Bomberger Brown|first2=Mary|date=2013-03-18|title=Where has all the road kill gone?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982213001942|journal=Current Biology|volume=23|issue=6|pages=R233âR234|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2013.02.023|pmid=23518051}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen in the below examples of cliff swallows and elk. However, not all human activity that causes an evolutionary pressure happens unintentionally. This is demonstrated in dog domestication and the subsequent [[selective breeding]] that resulted in the various breeds known today.

=== Cliff swallows ===
Populations of cliff swallows in Nebraska have displayed [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] changes in their wings after many years of living next to roads.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Collecting data for over 30 years, researchers noticed a decline in wingspan of living swallow populations, while also noting a decrease in the number of cliff swallows killed by passing cars. Those cliff swallows that were killed by passing cars showed a larger wingspan than the population as a whole. Confounding effects such as road usage, car size, and population size were shown to have no impact on the study.

=== Elk ===
Evolutionary pressure imposed by humans is also seen in elk populations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ciuti|first=Simone|last2=Muhly|first2=Tyler B.|last3=Paton|first3=Dale G.|last4=McDevitt|first4=Allan D.|last5=Musiani|first5=Marco|last6=Boyce|first6=Mark S.|date=2012-11-07|title=Human selection of elk behavioural traits in a landscape of fear|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/279/1746/4407|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=279|issue=1746|pages=4407â4416|doi=10.1098/rspb.2012.1483|issn=0962-8452|pmid=22951744|pmc=3479801}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies do not look at morphological differences, but behavioral differences. Faster and more mobile male elk were shown to be more likely to fall prey to hunters. The hunters create an environment where the more active animals are more likely to succumb to [[predation]] than less active animals.&lt;ref name="Brown 1999 385â399"/&gt; Female elk who survived past two years, would decrease their activity as each year passed, leaving more shy female elk that were more likely to survive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Female elk in a separate study also showed behavioral differences, with older females displaying the timid behavior that one would expect from this selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thurfjell|first=Henrik|last2=Ciuti|first2=Simone|last3=Boyce|first3=Mark S.|date=2017-06-14|title=Learning from the mistakes of others: How female elk (Cervus elaphus) adjust behaviour with age to avoid hunters|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=12|issue=6|pages=e0178082|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0178082|pmid=28614406|pmc=5470680|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dog domestication ===
Since the domestication of dogs, they have evolved alongside humans due to pressure from humans and the environment.&lt;ref name="Wang 1860"/&gt; This began by humans and wolves sharing the same area, with a pressure to coexist eventually leading to their domestication. Evolutionary pressure from humans led to many different breeds that paralleled the needs of the time, whether it was a need for protecting livestock or assisting in the hunt.&lt;ref name="Ostrander 117â124"/&gt; Hunting and herding were a couple of the first reasons for humans artificially selecting for traits they deemed beneficial.&lt;ref name="Parker 697â708"/&gt; This selective breeding does not stop there, but extends to humans selecting for certain traits deemed desirable in their domesticated dogs, such as size and color, even if they are not necessarily beneficial to the human in a tangible way.&lt;ref name="Lindblad-Toh 803â819"/&gt; An unintended consequence of this selection is that domesticated dogs also tend to have [[Heritability|heritable]] diseases depending on what specific breed they encompass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sargan|first=David R.|date=2004-06-01|title=IDID: Inherited Diseases in Dogs: Web-based information for canine inherited disease genetics|journal=Mammalian Genome|language=en|volume=15|issue=6|pages=503â506|doi=10.1007/s00335-004-3047-z|pmid=15181542|issn=0938-8990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computing]], '''Hazelcast''' IMDG is an [[open source software|open source]] [[In-memory database|in-memory]] [[data grid]] based on [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. It is also the name of the company developing the product. The Hazelcast company is funded by [[venture capital]] and headquartered in Palo Alto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoq.com/news/2013/09/hazelcast-vc-funding/ |title=Java In-Memory Grid Hazelcast gets venture capital funding from Bain Capital |publisher=Infoq.com |date=2013-09-18 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/09/18/hazelcast-adds-11m-to-grow-its-business-based-on-an-open-source-in-memory-data-grid/ |title=Hazelcast adds $11M to grow its business based on an open-source in-memory data grid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Hazelcast grid, data is evenly distributed among the nodes of a [[computer cluster]], allowing for [[horizontal scaling]] of [[Parallel computing|processing]] and available storage. Backups are also distributed among nodes to protect against failure of any single node. Hazelcast provides central, predictable scaling of applications through in-memory access to frequently used data and across an elastically scalable data grid. These techniques reduce the query load on databases and improve speed.

Hazelcast can run on-premises, in the cloud ([[Amazon Web Services]], [[Microsoft Azure]], [[Cloud Foundry]], [[OpenShift]]), virtually ([[VMware]]), and in [[Docker (software)|Docker]] containers. Hazelcast offers technology integrations for multiple cloud configuration and deployment technologies, including Apache jclouds, Consul, etcd, Eureka, [[Kubernetes]], and [[Apache_ZooKeeper|Zookeeper]]. The Hazelcast Cloud Discovery Service Provider Interface (SPI) enables cloud-based or on-premises nodes to auto-discover each other.

The Hazelcast platform can manage memory for many different types of applications. It offers an Open Binary Client Protocol to support APIs for any binary programing language. The Hazelcast and open source community members have created client APIs for programming languages that include [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], [[.NET Framework]], [[C++]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Node.js]], [[Golang]] and [[Clojure]]. Java and Scala can be used for both clients and embedded members.

==Usage==
Typical use-cases for Hazelcast include:
* Application scaling
* Cache-as-a-service
* Cross-[[Java virtual machine|JVM]] communication and shared storage
* [[Distributed cache]], often in front of a [[database]]
* [[In-memory processing]] and [[Analytics]]
* In-memory computing
* [[Internet of Things]] infrastructure
* [[Key-value database]]
* [[Memcached]] alternative with a protocol compatible interface&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hazelcast|title=Memcache Client|url=http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.5/manual/html-single/hazelcast-documentation.html#memcache-client|accessdate=2015-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15690">'''Hylozoism''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] point of view that [[matter]] is in some sense alive. The concept dates back at least as far as the [[Milesian school]] of [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers. The term was introduced to [[English language|English]] by [[Ralph Cudworth]] in 1678.

==Distinction from similar theories==
Although there is a distinction between possessing a mind ([[panpsychism|hylopsychism]]) and possessing life (hylozoism); in practice this division is difficult to maintain, because the ancient hylozoists not only regarded the spirits of the [[matter|material]] universe and plant world as alive, but also as more or less [[Consciousness|conscious]]. Whereas [[animism]] tends to view life as taking the form of discrete [[soul|spirits]], and panpsychism tends to refer to strictly philosophical views like that of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], hylozoism refers largely to views such as those of the earliest Greek philosophers (6th and 5th centuries BC), who treated the magnet as alive because of its attractive powers ([[Thales]]), or air as divine ([[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]]), perhaps because of its apparently spontaneous power of movement, or because of its essentiality for life in animals. Later this primitive hylozoism reappeared in modified forms.  Some scholars {{who|date=June 2015}} have since claimed that the term ''hylozoism'' should properly be used only where body and soul are explicitly distinguished, the distinction then being rejected as invalid.  Nevertheless, hylozoism remains logically distinct both from early forms of animism, which personify nature, and from panpsychism, which attributes some form of consciousness or sensation to all matter.

== Ancient hylozoism ==
Some of the ancient [[ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophers taught a version of hylozoism, as they, however vaguely, conceived the elemental matter as being in some sense animate if not actually conscious and {{not a typo|[[conative]]}} (a directed effort, a striving or tendency; a ''[[wikt:nisus|nisus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=(CD-ROM ver. 3.0) 2nd |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |quote=1. An effort, endeavour, striving. 2. ''transf''. A force, impulse, or tendency simulating human effort; a nisus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thales]], [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], and [[Heraclitus]] all taught that there is a form of life in all material objects,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Burnet (classicist)|J.Burnet]], [http://www.classicpersuasion.org/pw/burnet/egp.htm?chapter=introduction#8 ''Early Greek Philosophy'', Introduction, VIII, note 29]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] believed that a ''[[Anima mundi|world soul]]'' was the vital force of the universe. Note that these philosophies did not necessarily hold that material objects had ''separate life'' or ''identity'', only that they had life, either as part of an overriding entity or as living but insensible entities.

== In Renaissance and early Modernity ==
In the [[Renaissance]], [[Bernardino Telesio]], [[Paracelsus]], [[Cardanus]],  and [[Giordano Bruno]] revived the doctrine of hylozoism.  The latter, for example, held a form of [[Christian]] [[pantheism]], wherein [[God]] is the source, cause, medium, and end of all things, and therefore all things are participatory in the ongoing Godhead.  Bruno's ideas were so radical that he was entirely rejected by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as well as excommunicated from a few Protestant groups, and he was eventually burned at the stake for various heresies. Telesio, on the other hand, began from an [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] basis and, through radical [[empiricism]], came to believe that a living force was what informed all matter.  Instead of the intellectual universals of Aristotle, he believed that life generated form.

In [[England]], some of the [[Cambridge Platonists]] approached hylozoism as well. Both [[Henry More]] and [[Ralph Cudworth]] (''the Younger'', 1617â1688), through their reconciliation of Platonic [[idealism]] with Christian doctrines of deific generation, came to see the divine lifeforce as the informing principle in the world. Thus, like Bruno, but not nearly to the extreme, they saw God's generative impulse as giving life to all things that exist. Accordingly, Cudworth, the most systematic metaphysician of the Cambridge Platonist tradition, fought hylozoism. His work is primarily a critique of what he took to be the two principal forms of atheismâmaterialism and hylozoism.

Cudworth singled out Hobbes not only as a defender of the hylozoic atheism "which attributes life to matter", but also as one going beyond it and defending "hylopathian atheism, which attributes all to matter." Cudworth attempted to show that Hobbes had revived the doctrines of [[Protagoras]] and was therefore subject to the criticisms which [[Plato]] had deployed against Protagoras in the [[Theaetetus (dialogue)|''Theaetetus'']]. On the side of hylozoism, [[Strato of Lampsacus]] was the official target. However, Cudworth's Dutch friends had reported to him the views which [[Spinoza]] was circulating in manuscript. Cudworth remarks in his ''Preface'' that he would have ignored hylozoism had he not been aware that a new version of it would shortly be published.&lt;ref&gt;''The True Intellectual System of the Universe: The First part; wherein, All the Reason and Philosophy of Atheism is Confuted; and Its Impossibility Demonstrated''. By Ralph Cudworth, D.D. London, Printed for Richard Royston, 1678&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza's idealism also tends toward hylozoism.  In order to hold a balance even between matter and mind, Spinoza combined materialistic with pantheistic hylozoism, by demoting both to mere attributes of the one infinite substance.  Although specifically rejecting identity in inorganic matter, he, like the Cambridge Platonists, sees a life force within, as well as beyond, all matter.

== Contemporary hylozoism ==
[[Immanuel Kant]] presented arguments against hylozoism in the third chapter of his ''Metaphysische AnfangsgrÃ¼nde der Naturwissenschaften'' ("First Metaphysical Principles of Natural Science," 1786) and also in his famous ''Kritik der reinen Vernunft'' ("Critique of Pure Reason," 1783).  Yet, in our times, scientific hylozoism â whether modified, or keeping the trend to make all beings conform to some uniform pattern, to which the concept was adhered in [[modernity]] by [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Hermann Lotze]], and [[Ernst Heinrich Haeckel|Ernst Haeckel]] â was often called upon as a protest against a [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] worldview.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.rz.hu-berlin.de/phil/kantkongress/14/look.html Hylozoism and Dogmatism in Kant, Leibniz, and Newton]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, Haeckel developed a [[materialism|materialist]] form of hylozoism, specially against [[Rudolf Virchow]]'s and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]'s mechanical views of humans and nature.  In his ''Die WeltrÃ¤tsel'' of 1899 (''The Riddle of the Universe'' 1901), Haeckel upheld a unity of organic and inorganic nature and derived all actions of both types of matter from natural causes and laws.  Thus, his form of hylozoism reverses the usual course by maintaining that living and nonliving things are essentially the same, and by erasing the distinction between the two and stipulating that they behave by a single set of laws.

In contrast, the Argentine-German [[Neuroscience|neurobiological]] tradition terms ''hylozoic hiatus'' all of the parts of nature which can only behave lawfully or nomically and, upon such a feature, are described as lying outside of minds and amid them â i.e. extramentally.  Thereby the hylozoic hiatus becomes contraposed to minds deemed able of behaving semoviently, i.e. able of inaugurating new causal series ([[semovience]]).  Hylozoism in this contemporary neurobiological tradition is thus restricted to the portions of nature behaving nomically inside the minds, namely the minds' sensory reactions ([[Christfried Jakob]]'s "sensory intonations") whereby minds react to the stimuli coming from the hylozoic hiatus or extramental realm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://electroneubio.secyt.gov.ar/commentl.htm Comment lâ hylozoÃ¯sme scientifique contemporain aborde-t-il la sÃ©lection naturelle du parenchyme neurocognitif?] (French)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cogprints.org/4662|title=On Minds' Localization|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Buber]] too takes an approach that is quasi-hylozoic.  By maintaining that the essence of things is identifiable and separate, although not pre-existing, he can see a soul within each thing.

The French Pythagorean and Rosicrucian alchemist, Francois Jollivet-Castelot (1874-1937), established a hylozoic esoteric school which combined the insight of spagyrics, chemistry, physics, transmutations and metaphysics. He published many books, one of which was called "LâHylozoÃ¯sme, lâalchimie, les chimistes unitaires" (1896). In his view there was no difference between spirit and matter except for the degree of frequency and other vibrational conditions.

The [[Mormon theology|Mormon theologian]] [[Orson Pratt]] taught a form of hylozoism.

[[Alice A. Bailey]] wrote a book called ''The Consciousness of the Atom''.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Consciousness of the Atom''â1922&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by Alice A. Bailey, [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], and their predecessor [[Madame Blavatsky]], [[Henry T. Laurency]] produced voluminous writings describing a hylozoic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction to the Works of Henry T. Laurency". ''The Official Website of the Henry T. Laurency Publishing Foundation''. Henry T. Laurency Publishing Foundation. 12 July 2009 &lt;http://www.laurency.com/introduc.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by [[George Ivanovich Gurdjieff]], the English philosopher and mathematician [[John Godolphin Bennett]], in his four-volume work ''The Dramatic Universe'' and his book ''Energies'', developed a six-dimensional framework in which matter-energy takes on 12 levels of hylozoic quality.

[[Ken Wilber]] embraces hylozoism to explain  [[subjective experience]] and provides terms describing the ladder of subjective experience experienced by entities from [[atom]]s up to [[Human being]]s in the ''upper left quadrant'' of his [[Integral (philosophy)|Integral philosophy]] chart.&lt;ref&gt;Wilber Ken ''A Brief History of Everything'', 1st ed. 1996, 2nd ed. 2001: {{ISBN|1-57062-740-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist Thomas Brophy, in The Mechanism Demands a Mysticism, embraces hylozoism as the basis of a framework for re-integrating modern physical science with perennial spiritual philosophy.  Brophy coins two additional words to stand with hylozoism as the three possible ontological stances consistent with modern physics.  Thus: hylostatism (universe is deterministic, thus âstaticâ in a four-dimensional sense); hylostochastism (universe contains a fundamentally random or stochastic component); hylozoism (universe contains a fundamentally alive aspect).

Architect [[Christopher Alexander]] has put forth a theory of the living universe, where life is viewed as a pervasive patterning that extends to what is normally considered non-living things, notably buildings.  He wrote a four-volume work called ''[[The Nature of Order]]'' which explicates this theory in detail.

Philosopher and ecologist [[David Abram]] articulates and elaborates a form of hylozoism grounded in the [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] of sensory experience. In his books ''Becoming Animal'' and ''The Spell of the Sensuous,'' Abram suggests that matter is never entirely passive in our direct experience, holding rather that material things actively "solicit our attention" or "call our focus," coaxing the perceiving body into an ongoing participation with those things. In the absence of intervening technologies, sensory experience is inherently animistic, disclosing a material field that is animate and self-organizing from the get-go. Drawing upon contemporary cognitive and natural science as well as the perspectival worldviews of diverse indigenous, oral cultures, Abram proposes a richly pluralist and story-based cosmology, in which matter is alive through and through. Such an ontology is in close accord, he suggests, with our spontaneous perceptual experience; it calls us back to our senses and to the primacy of the sensuous terrain,  enjoining a more respectful and ethical relation to the more-than-human community of animals, plants, soils, mountains, waters and weather-patterns that materially sustains us.&lt;ref&gt;Abram, David ''The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World'', Pantheon, 1996; Vintage 1997: {{ISBN|978-0-679-77639-0}} and Abram, David: ''Becoming Animal: An Earthly Cosmology'' Pantheon, 2010; Vintage 2011: {{ISBN|978-0-375-71369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruno Latour]]'s [[actor-network theory]], in the sociology of science, treats non-living things as active agents and thus bears some metaphorical resemblance to hylozoism.&lt;ref&gt;Latour, Bruno ''Pandora's Hope: Essays on the reality of Science Studies'', 1999: {{ISBN|0-674-65335-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Hylozoic Series: Sibyl (2012)|Hylozoic Series: Sibyl]]'', an interactive installation of Canadian artist and architect [[Philip Beesley]], was presented in the [[Biennale of Sydney#18th Biennale of Sydney .282012.29|18th Biennale of Sydney]] and was on display until September, 2012.  Using sensors, LEDs, and shape memory alloy, Beesley constructed an interactive environment that responded to the actions of the audience, offering a vision of how buildings in the future might move, think and feel.&lt;ref name="Sibyl by Philip Beesley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inspir3d.net/2012/07/02/sibyl-by-philip-beesley/ |title=Sibyl by Philip Beesley |work=Inspir3d |accessdate=20 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427111521/http://inspir3d.net/2012/07/02/sibyl-by-philip-beesley/ |archivedate=27 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''[[Literature]]'''
*In mathematician and writer [[Rudy Rucker]]'s novels ''Postsingular'' and ''Hylozoic'', the emergent sentience of all material things is described as a property of the [[technological singularity]].
*The ''Hylozoist'' is one of the Culture ships mentioned in Iain M. Banks's novel ''[[Surface Detail]]'' â appropriately, this ship is a member of the branch of Contact dealing with [[Hegemonising swarm|smart matter]] outbreaks.
'''[[MMORPG]]s''' 
*The monster "Hylozoist" (sometimes spelled "Heirozoist") in the MMORPG ''[[Ragnarok Online]]'' is a plush rabbit doll with its mouth sewn shut, possessed by the spirit of a child. Although hylozoism has nothing to do with possession, it is clear that the name was derived from this ancient philosophy.
'''[[Music]]'''
*The [[Hylozoists (band)|Hylozoists]] are a Canadian band.
*[[Sonic Youth]] references hylozoism in the second verse of the fourth track on the [[Sister (Sonic Youth album)|Sister]] LP&lt;ref name="Sister\Stereo Sanctity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sonicyouth.com/archives/lyrics/index.html|title=Untitled Document|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(Jane Bennett) data sheet (b. 7/31/57)}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[United States|American]] political theorist and philosopher. She is professor at the Department of Political Science, [[Johns Hopkins University School of Arts and Sciences#Departments|Johns Hopkins University School of Arts and Sciences]].

== Education ==
Jane Bennett originally trained in environmental studies and political science. She then went on to [[Cornell University]] to study environmental science. After Cornell she studied political theory and gained her degree (''[[Latin honors#Types|magna cum laude]]'') in 1979 from [[Siena College]], [[Loudonville, New York]]. Whilst at Siena College Bennett met [[Kathy Ferguson]]. Bennett then went on to the [[University of Massachusetts]] and qualified as a doctor of [[political science]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=Minnesota_Review /&gt;&lt;ref name=CV&gt;{{cite web | title= Jane Bennett | url= http://politicalscience.jhu.edu/bios/jane-bennett/vita%202013%20November.doc | publisher= Department of Political Science, Johns Hopkins University | accessdate= 25 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
Bennett's work considers [[ontology|ontological]] ideas about the [[Speculative realism#Transcendental Materialism / Neo-Vitalism|relationship between humans and 'things']], what she calls "vital materialism",
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"What counts as the material of vital materialism? Is it only human labour and the socio-economic entities made by men using raw materials? Or is materiality more potent than that? How can political theory do a better job of recognizing the active participation of nonhuman forces in every event and every stabilization? Is there a form of theory that can acknowledge a certain âthing-powerâ, that is, the irreducibility of objects to the human meanings or agendas they also embody?"''&lt;ref name="Vital_materialism"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Khan | first = Gulshan | title = Agency, nature and emergent properties: an interview with Jane Bennett | journal = Contemporary Political Theory | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 90â105 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | doi = 10.1057/cpt.2008.43 | date = February 2009 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1057/cpt.2008.43 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Los Angeles Review of Books'']&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett's argument is that, "Edibles, commodities, storms, and metals act as [[Agency (philosophy)|quasi agents]], with their own trajectories, potentialities and tendencies."&lt;ref name=Minnesota_Review&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Watson | first = Janell | title = Eco-sensibilities: interview with Jane Bennett | journal = Minnesota Review | volume = 81 | issue = 1 | pages = 147â158 | publisher = Duke University Press | doi = 10.1215/00265667-2332147 | date = October 2013 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1215/00265667-2332147 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public lectures she has given include "Impersonal Sympathy", a talk theorizing 'sympathy' in which she considered the alchemist-physician [[Paracelsus|Paracelsus (1493-1541)]] and [[Walt Whitman|Walt Whitman's]] collection of poetry, ''[[Leaves of Grass]]''.&lt;ref name=CISSC&gt;{{cite web|title=CISSC Lecture Series: Jane Bennett, Johns Hopkins University: Impersonal Sympathy |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728234301/http://cissc.concordia.ca/lecturesconferencesandevents/2012-13/?share=1|publisher=Center for Interdisciplinary Studies in Society and Culture, Concordia University, Montreal|accessdate=25 July 2014|date=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Bennett delivered the annual Neal A.

'''Jewish meditation''' can refer to several traditional practices, ranging from visualization and intuitive methods, forms of emotional insight in communitive prayer, esoteric combinations of Divine names, to intellectual analysis of philosophical, ethical or mystical concepts. It often accompanies unstructured, personal Jewish prayer that can allow isolated contemplation, and underlies the instituted [[Jewish services]]. Its elevated psychological insights can give birth to [[dveikus]] (cleaving to God), particularly in Jewish mysticism. The accurate traditional Hebrew term for meditation is '''Hitbodedut/Hisbodedus''' (literally self "seclusion"), while the more limited term '''Hitbonenut/Hisbonenus''' ("contemplation") describes the conceptually directed intellectual method of meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaplan|first1=Aryeh|title=Meditation and Kabbalah|date=1985|publisher=S. Weiser|location=York Beach, Me.|isbn=978-0877286165|edition= 1st paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the centuries, some of the common forms include the practices in [[Jewish philosophy|philosophy]] and [[Musar literature|ethics]] of [[Abraham ben Maimonides]]; in [[Kabbalah]] of [[Abraham Abulafia]], [[Isaac the Blind]], [[Azriel of Gerona]], [[Moses ben Jacob Cordovero|Moses Cordovero]], [[Yosef Karo]] and [[Isaac Luria]]; in [[Hasidism]] of the [[Baal Shem Tov]], [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]] and [[Nachman of Breslov]]; and in the [[Musar movement]] of [[Israel Salanter]] and [[Simcha Zissel Ziv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scholem|first1=Gershom|title=Major trends in Jewish mysticism|date=1995|publisher=Schocken Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0805210422|edition= 3rd revised, reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its esoteric forms, "Meditative Kabbalah" is one of the three branches of Kabbalah, alongside "Theosophical" [[Kabbalah]] and the separate [[Practical Kabbalah]]. It is a common misconception to include Meditative Kabbalah in Practical Kabbalah, which seeks to alter physicality, while Meditative Kabbalah seeks insight into spirituality, together with the intellectual theosophy comprising ''Kabbalah Iyunit'' (Contemplative Kabbalah).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inner.org/kabbalah/beginner/practical.htm What is Practical Kabbalah?] from www.inner.org. Distinction of the two forms and three branches of Kabbalah explained further in ''What You Need to Know About Kabbalah'', Yitzchak Ginsburgh, Gal Einai publications, section on Practical Kabbalah; and ''Meditation and Kabbalah'', Aryeh Kaplan, introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There is evidence that Judaism has had meditative practices since the time of the patriarchs. For instance, in the book of Genesis, the patriarch [[Isaac]] is described as going "lasuach" in the field - a term understood by many commentators as some type of meditative practice ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 24:63).&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, A. (1978), ''Meditation and the Bible'', Maine, Samuel Weiser Inc, p101&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, there are indications throughout the [[Tanakh]] (the Hebrew [[Bible]]) that Judaism always contained a central meditative tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Kaplan |first = Aryeh |authorlink = Aryeh Kaplan |title = Jewish Meditation |publisher = Schocken Books |year = 1985 |location = New York |pages = 40â41 |isbn = 0-8052-1037-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meditation in early Jewish mysticism==
{{Main|Merkabah|Pardes (legend)}}
{{Jewish mysticism}}
Historians trace the earliest surviving Jewish esoteric texts to [[Tannaim|Tannaic]] times. This "Merkavah-Heichalot" mysticism, referred to in [[Talmudic]] accounts, sought elevations of the soul using meditative methods, built around the Biblical Vision of Ezekiel and the Creation in Genesis. The distinctive conceptual features of later [[Kabbalah]] first emerged from the 11th century, though traditional Judaism predates the 13th century [[Zohar]] back to the Tannaim, and the preceding end of Biblical prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inner.org/kabbalah/beginner/five-stages-historical-development-kabbalah.php Article "Five stages in the historical development of Kabbalah" from www.inner.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meditative Kabbalah==
{{See also|Kavanah|Names of God in Judaism}}
{{Kabbalah}}
The branch of [[Kabbalah]] called Meditative/Ecstatic Kabbalah is concerned with uniting the individual with God through [[meditation]] on [[Names of God in Judaism]], combinations of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew letters]], and ''[[Kavanot]]'' (mystical "intentions") in [[Jewish prayer]] and performance of [[mitzvot]]. Kabbalists reinterpreted the standard [[Jewish liturgy]] by reading it as esoteric mystical meditations and the ascent of the soul for elite practitioners. Through this, the border between meditative prayer and [[theurgy|theurgic]] practice would be blurred if prayer becomes viewed as a magical process rather than supplication. However, Kabbalists censored [[Practical Kabbalah]] for only the most holy, and were careful to interpret mystical prayer in non-magical ways; the Kabbalist is able to alter supernal judgements by suplicating a higher Divine Will. A term for this, [[Unifications â Yichudim]] unites Meditative Kabbalah with [[Kabbalah|Theosophical Kabbalah]] doctrine of harmony in the Sephirot.

===Abraham Abulafia===
{{Main|Abraham Abulafia}}
[[Abraham Abulafia]] (1240â1291), leading medieval figure in the history of "Meditative Kabbalah", the founder of the school of "Prophetic/Ecstatic Kabbalah", wrote meditation manuals using meditation on Hebrew letters and words to achieve ecstatic states.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, L. (2006) ''Jewish Mystical Testimonies'', Jerusalem, Keter Publishing House, pp56-72&lt;/ref&gt; His teachings embody the non-Zoharic stream in Spanish Kabbalism, which he viewed as alternative and superior to the theosophical [[Kabbalah]] which he criticised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Series of Classes|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/|accessdate=Oct 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abulafia's work is surrounded in controversy because of the edict against him by the [[Shlomo ben Aderet|Rashba]] (R. Shlomo Ben Aderet), a contemporary leading scholar. However, according to [[Aryeh Kaplan]], the Abulafian system of meditations forms an important part of the work of Rabbi [[Hayim Vital]], and in turn his master the Ari, Rabbi [[Isaac Luria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=You Be the Judge series starts tonight|url=http://www.denverpost.com/circare/html/gsa_template.jsp?sortBy=mngi&amp;similarTo=&amp;similarType=find&amp;type=any&amp;aff=3&amp;view=entiresitesppublished&amp;query=+You+Be+the+Judge+series+starts+tonight&amp;searchbutton=Go|accessdate=Oct 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaplan's pioneering translations and scholarship on Meditative Kabbalah&lt;ref&gt;''Meditation and the Bible'' and ''Meditation and Kabbalah'' by [[Aryeh Kaplan]]&lt;/ref&gt; trace Abulafia's publications to the extant concealed [[Oral Torah|transmission]] of the esoteric meditative methods of the [[Nevi'im|Hebrew prophets]]. While Abulafia remained a marginal figure in the direct development of Theosophical [[Kabbalah]], recent academic scholarship on Abulafia by Moshe Idel reveals his wider influence across the later development of Jewish mysticism. In the 16th century [[Judah Albotini]] continued Abulafian methods in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Vail Valley to join worldwide release of âYou Be the Judge IIâ|url=https://www.jlicentral.com/news.php?task=fullstory&amp;NID=140|accessdate=Oct 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Chabad Jewish Center invites Somerset County residents to 'Be The Judge'|url=http://www.nj.com/reporter/index.ssf/2009/02/chabad_jewish_center_invites_s.html|accessdate=Oct 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other medieval era methods===
[[Isaac of Acco]] (13th-14th century) and [[Joseph Tzayach]] (1505-1573), the latter influenced by Abulafia, taught their own systems of meditation. Tzayach was probably the last Kabbalist to advocate use of the prophetic position, where one places his head between his knees. This position was used by Elijah on Mount Carmel, and in early [[Merkabah mysticism]]. Speaking of individuals who meditate (hitboded), he says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;They bend themselves like reeds, placing their heads between their knees until all their faculties are nullified. As a result of this lack of sensation, they see the Supernal Light, with true vision and not with allegory.&lt;ref&gt;''Meditation and Kabbalah'', Aryeh Kaplan, Samuel Wieser publications, p.165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Moshe Cordovero===
Rabbi [[Moses ben Jacob Cordovero]] (1522-1570), central historical Kabbalist in [[Safed]], taught that when meditating, one does not focus on the [[Sefirot]] (Divine emanations) per se, but rather on the light from the Infinite ("Atzmut"-essence of God) contained within the emanations. Keeping in mind that all reaches up to the Infinite, his prayer is "to Him, not to His attributes."  Proper meditation focuses upon how the Godhead acts through specific sefirot. In meditation on the essential [[Hebrew name of God]], represented by the four letter [[Tetragrammaton]], this corresponds to meditating on the [[Hebrew vowels]] which are seen as reflecting the light from the Infinite-Atzmut.

The essential name of God in the [[Hebrew Bible]], the four letter Tetragrammaton (Yud- Hei- Vav-Hei), corresponds in Kabbalistic thought to the 10 sefirot. Kabbalists interpret the shapes and spiritual forces of each of these 4 letters, as reflecting each sefirah (The Yud-male point represents the infinite dimensionless flash of Wisdom, and the transcendent thorn atop it, the supra-conscious soul of Crown. The first Hei-female vessel represents the expansion of the insight of Wisdom in the breadth and depth of Understanding. The Vav-male point drawn downward in a line represents the birth of the emotional sefirot, Kindness to Foundation from their pregnant state in Understanding. The second Hei-female vessel represents the revelation of the previous sefirot in the action of Kingship). Therefore, the Tetragrammaton has the Infinite Light clothed within it as the sefirot. This is indicated by the change in the vowel-points (nekudot) found underneath each of the four letters of the Name in each sefira. " Each sefira is distinguished by the manner in which the Infinite Light is clothed within it". In Jewish tradition, the vowel points and pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton are uncertain, and in reverence to the holiness of the name, this name for God is never read. In Kabbalah many spiritual permutations of different vowel notations are recorded for the Tetragrammaton, corresponding to different spiritual meanings and emanations.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Kubutz and Shuruk are pronounced indistinguishably in modern Hebrew and for this reason there is reason to be skeptical as far as the association of Kubutz with Hod rather than Yesod and vice versa.

===Isaac Luria===
{{Main|Yichudim}}
[[Isaac Luria]] (1534â1572), the father of modern Kabbalah, systemised [[Lurianic Kabbalah|Lurianic Kabbalistic]] theory as a dynamic mythological scheme. While the Zohar is outwardly solely a theosophical work, for which reason medieval Meditative Kabbalists followed alternative traditions, Luria's systemisation of doctrine enabled him to draw new detailed meditative practices, called [[Yichudim]], from the Zohar, based on the dynamic interaction of the Lurianic [[partzufim]]. This meditative method, as with Luria's theosophical exegesis, dominated later Kabbalistic activity. Luria prescribed Yichudim as [[Kavanot]] for the prayer liturgy, later practiced communally by [[Shalom Sharabi]] and the [[Beit El Synagogue|Beit El]] circle, for Jewish observances, and for secluded attainment of [[Ruach Hakodesh]]. One favoured activity of the [[Safed]] mystics was meditation while prostrated on the graves of saints, in order to commune with their souls.

===Hayim Vital===
Rabbi [[Hayim Vital]] (c. 1543-1620), major disciple of R. [[Isaac Luria]], and responsible for publication of most of his works. In his [[Kabbalah: Primary texts#Etz Hayim and the Eight Gates|Lurianic works]] he describes the theosophical and meditative teachings of Luria. However, his own writings cover wider meditative methods, drawn from earlier sources. His ''Shaarei Kedusha'' (Gates of Holiness) was the only guidebook to Meditative Kabbalah traditionally printed, though its most esoteric fourth part remained unpublished until recently. In the following account Vital presents the method of R. [[Yosef Karo]] in receiving his Heavenly [[Magid (Jewish mysticism)|Magid]] teacher, which he regarded as the soul of the [[Mishna]] (recorded by Karo in Magid Mesharim):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Meditate alone in a house, wrapped in a prayer shawl. Sit and shut your eyes, and transcend the physical as if your soul has left your body and is ascending to heaven. After this divestment/ascension, recite one [[Mishna]], any Mishna you wish, many times consecutively, as quickly as you can, with clear pronunciation, without skipping one word. Intend to bind your soul with the soul of the sage who taught this Mishna.
" Your soul will become a chariot. .."

Do this by intending that your mouth is a mere vessel/[[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]] to bring forth the letters of the words of this Mishna, and that the voice that emerges through the vessel of your mouth is [filled with] the sparks of your inner soul which are emerging and reciting this Mishna. In this way, your soul will become a chariot within which the soul of the sage who is the master of that Mishna can manifest. His soul will then clothe itself within your soul.

At a certain point in the process of reciting the words of the Mishna, you may feel overcome by exhaustion. If you are worthy, the soul of this sage may then come to reside in your mouth. This will happen in the midst of your reciting the Mishna. As you recite, he will begin to speak with your mouth and wish you Shalom. He will then answer every question that comes into your thoughts to ask him. He will do this with and through your mouth. Your ears will hear his words, for you will not be speaking from yourself. Rather, he will be speaking through you. This is the mystery of the verse, "The spirit of God spoke to me, and His word was on my lips". (Samuel II 23:2)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kabbalaonline.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380371/jewish/Meditation-on-a-Mishna.htm Mishna Meditation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Meditation in Hasidism==

===The Baal Shem Tov and popular mysticism===
[[File:A man prays at the Western Wall in Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Hasidic prayer left aside previous focus on Kabbalistic [[Kavanah|Kavanot]] (mental visualisation) of Divine names, in favour of innate [[dveikut]] (cleaving to God) of the soul]]
The [[Baal Shem Tov]], founder of [[Hasidic Judaism]], took the Talmudic phrase that "God desires the heart" and made it central to his love of the sincerity of the common folk. Advocating joy in the omnipresent [[Divine immanence]], he sought to revive the disenfranchised populance in their Jewish life. The 17th century [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|destructions]] of Jewish communities, and wide loss of ability to access learning among the simple unlettered [[shtetl]] Jews, left the people at a spiritual low. Elite scholars felt distant from the masses, as [[Rabbinic Judaism|traditional Judaism]] saw Talmudic learning as the main spiritual activity, while [[Maggid|preachers]] could offer little popular solace with ethical admonishment. The Baal Shem Tov began a new articulation of Jewish mysticism, by relating its structures to direct psychological experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inner.org/chassidut/chassidut.htm Overview of Chassidut] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202030707/http://www.inner.org/chassidut/chassidut.htm |date=February 2, 2009 }} from www.inner.org&lt;/ref&gt; His mystical explanations, parables and stories to the unlearned encouraged their emotional [[deveikus]] (fervour), especially through attachment to the Hasidic figure of the [[Tzaddik]], while his close circle understood the deep spiritual philosophy of the new ideas. In the presence of the Tzaddik, the followers could gain inspiration and attachment to God. The Baal Shem Tov and the Hasidic Masters left aside the previous Kabbalistic meditative focus on Divine Names and their visualisation, in favour of a more personal, inner mysticism, expressed innately in mystical joy, devotional prayer and [[nigun|melody]], or studied conceptually in the systemised classic works of [[Hasidic philosophy]].

===Chabad Hasidism: Hisbonenus - Chochma, Binah, and Daat===
[[File:Prayers in Kutaisi synagogue.jpg|thumb|170px|right|[[Chabad]] differed from mainstream Hasidism in its preparation for prayer by intellectual contemplation of [[Hasidic philosophy]]. Nonetheless, an aim of this is to reveal simplicity of soul, which all possess. The [[Rebbe]]s of Chabad were envious of the sincerity of the simple folk]]
Rabbi [[Dov Ber of Lubavitch]],  the "Mitler Rebbe," the second leader of the [[Chabad]] Dynasty wrote several works explaining the Chabad approach. In his works, he explains that the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for meditation is ''hisbonenus'' (alternatively transliterated as ''hitbonenut''). The word "hisbonenut" derives from the Hebrew word ''Binah'' (lit. understanding) and refers to the process of understanding through analytical study. While the word ''hisbonenus'' can be applied to analytical study of any topic, it is generally used to refer to study of the [[Torah]], and particularly in this context, the explanations of [[Kabbalah]] in [[Chabad]] [[Hasidic philosophy]], in order to achieve a greater understanding and appreciation of God.

In the Chabad presentation, every intellectual process must incorporate three faculties: [[Chochma]], [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]], and [[Daat]]. ''Chochma'' (lit. wisdom) is the mind's ability to come up with a new insight into a concept that one did not know before. ''Binah'' (lit. understanding) is the mind's ability to take a new insight (from ''Chochma''), analyze all of its implications and simplify the concept so it is understood well. ''Daat'' (lit. knowledge), the third stage, is the mind's ability to focus and hold its attention on the ''Chochma'' and the ''Binah''.

The term ''hisbonenus'' represents an important point of the Chabad method: Chabad Hasidic philosophy rejects the notion that any new insight can come from mere concentration. Chabad philosophy explains that while "Daat" is a necessary component of cognition, it is like an empty vessel without the learning and analysis and study that comes through the faculty of Binah. Just as a scientist's new insight or discovery (''Chochma'') always results from prior in-depth study and analysis of his topic (''Binah''), likewise, to gain any insight in Godliness can only come through in-depth study of the explanations of Kabbalah and Chassidic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kabbalaonline.org/Meditations/jewishmeditation/Active_vs.Passive_Meditation.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 14, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050124200908/http://www.kabbalaonline.org/Meditations/jewishmeditation/Active_vs.Passive_Meditation.asp |archivedate=January 24, 2005 }}  Active vs.Passive_Meditation&lt;/ref&gt;

Chassidic masters say that enlightenment is commensurate with one's ''understanding'' of the [[Torah]] and specifically the explanations of Kabbalah and Hasidic philosophy.
They warn that prolonged concentration devoid of intellectual content can lead to sensory deprivation, hallucinations, and even insanity which all can be tragically mistaken for "spiritual enlightenment".

However, a contemporary translation of the word ''hisbonenus'' into popular English would not be "meditation". "Meditation" refers to the mind's ability to concentrate (''Daat''), which in Hebrew is called ''Haamokat HaDaat''. ''Hisbonenut'', which, as explained above, refers to the process of analysis (''Binah'') is more properly translated as "in-depth analytical study". (Ibid.)

Chabad accepts and endorses the writings of Kabbalists such as [[Moshe Cordevero]] and [[Haim Vital]] and their works are quoted at length in the Hasidic texts. However, the Hasidic masters say that their methods are easily misunderstood without a proper foundation in [[Hasidic philosophy]].

The Mitler Rebbe emphasizes that hallucinations that come from a mind devoid of intellectual content are the product of the brain's ''Koach HaDimyon'' (lit. power of imagination), which is the brainâs lowest faculty. Even a child is capable of higher forms of thought than the ''Koach HaDimyon''. So such hallucinations should never be confused with the flash intuitive insight known as ''Chochma'' which can only be achieved through in-depth study of logical explanations of Kabbalah and Hasidic philosophy.

===Breslav Hasidism: Hisbodedus and communitative prayer===
[[Hisbodedus]] (alternatively transliterated as "hitbodedut", from the root "boded" meaning "self-seclusion") refers to an unstructured, spontaneous and individualized form of prayer and meditation taught by Rebbe [[Nachman of Breslov]]. The goal of hitbodedut is to establish a close, personal relationship with God and a clearer understanding of one's personal motives and goals. However, in Likutey Moharan I, Lesson 52, Rebbe Nachman describes the ultimate goal of hisbodedus as the transformative realization of God as the "Imperative Existent," or Essence of Reality. See [[Hisbodedus]] for the words of Rabbi Nachman on this method.

==Meditation in the Musar Movement==
{{Main|Musar movement}}
The [[Musar movement|Musar]] (Ethics) Movement, founded by Rabbi [[Israel Salanter]] in the middle of the 19th-century, encouraged meditative practices of introspection and visualization that could help to improve moral character. Its truthful psychological self-evaluation of one's spiritual worship, institutionalised the preceding classic ethical tradition within [[Rabbinic literature]] as a spiritual movement within the [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian]] [[Yeshiva]] academies. Many of these techniques were described in the writings of Salanter's closest disciple, Rabbi [[Simcha Zissel Ziv]]. Two paths within Musar developed in the [[Hebron Yeshiva|Slabodka]] and [[Novardok yeshiva|Novardok]] schools. It is said that Rabbi Salanter would often stay up all night pacing in his room, focusing on a  verse or quotation, trying to extract all the knowledge he could from the words.

According to Geoffrey Claussen of [[Elon University]], some forms of Musar meditation are visualization techniques which "seek to make impressions upon oneâs characterâoften a matter of taking insights of which we are conscious and bringing them into our unconscious."  Other forms of Musar meditation are introspective, "considering oneâs character and exploring its tendenciesâoften a matter of taking what is unconscious and bringing it to consciousness."  A number of contemporary rabbis have advocated such practices, including "taking time each day to sit in silence and simply noticing the way that oneâs mind wanders."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/1502958/The_Practice_of_Musar&lt;/ref&gt;

A {{Nihongo|'''kaisandÅ'''|éå±±å |kaisan-dÅ}}, also termed the '''Founder's Hall''', is a temple structure in a Japanese [[Buddhist]] [[monastery]] complex or other temple where an image (or images) of the founding [[abbot]] and other significant teachers and [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] ancestors are kept,&lt;ref&gt;Kinoshita, 58&lt;/ref&gt; along with a memorial slab (J. [[ihai]]). Sometimes also referred to as the Patriarch Hall (J. ''soshido'') or Reflection Hall (J. ''Eishitsu''), this building holds [[funeral|memorial service]]s yearly on the anniversary of the death of the founding abbot.&lt;ref name="baroni"&gt;Baroni, 95&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest Founder's Hall in Japan is the Goei-dÅ (å¾¡å½±å ) in front of the [[Hongan-ji|Higashi Hongwanji]] (Hongan-ji) Temple in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]], one of two head temples of the [[JÅdo ShinshÅ«]] sect of Buddhism.

Ott is currently Professor for Philosophy and Ethics of the Environment at [[Kiel University]]. From 2000 to 2008 he was a member of the [[:de:SachverstÃ¤ndigenrat fÃ¼r Umweltfragen|German Advisory Council on the Environment]]. From 1997 to 2012 Ott was professor for environmental ethics at the [[University of Greifswald]]. Ott is also known as a critic of mass migration to Europe. Regarding migration from Africa ''via'' the Mediterranean, Ott postulated in 2018 that "this route must be dried out"; the merit of Italy's Home Office Secretary [[Matteo Salvini]] should be acknowledged "at least [...] to have made this route less attractive".&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Ott: ''"NGOs sollen nicht moralisch Ã¼berheblich werden"'' [''"NGOs should not revel in moral arrogance"'']. In: ''Der Standard'' (Vienna/Austria), 3/4 November 2018, p. 11: "diese Route auszutrocknen"; "immerhin [...] die Route unattraktiver gemacht".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mad Pride''' is a mass movement of the users of [[mental health]] services, former users, and the aligned, and that individuals with mental illness should be proud of their 'mad' identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://themighty.com/2017/03/healing-voices-mad-pride/|title=The Power of 'Healing Voices'|publisher=The Mighty|first=Oryx|last=Cohen|date=9 March 2017|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed in 1993 in response to local community prejudices towards people with a psychiatric history living in boarding homes in the Parkdale area of [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, and an event has been held every year since then in the city except for 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csinfo.ca/bulletin.html  |first=Geoffrey |last=Reaume |title=A History of Psychiatric Survivor Pride Day during the 1990s |publisher=The Consumer/Survivor Information Resource Centre Bulletin, No. 374 |date=July 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar movement began around the same time in the United Kingdom. By the late 1990s similar events were being organized under the Mad Pride name around the globe, including Australia, Ireland, Portugal, Brazil, Madagascar, South Africa and the United States. Events draw thousands of participants, according to [[MindFreedom International]], a United States mental health advocacy organization that promotes and tracks events spawned by the movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/fashion/11madpride.html?partner=rssnyt 'Mad Pride' Fights a Stigma]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mad Pride activists seek to reclaim terms such as "[[Insanity|mad]]", "[[nutter (disambiguation)|nutter]]", and "[[psychosis|psycho]]" from misuse, such as in [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspapers and in order to switch it from a negative view into a positive view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/fashion/11madpride.html|title=Mad Prideâ Fights a Stigma|publisher=New York Times|first=Gabriell|last=Glaser|date=11 May 2008|accessdate=19 September 2018|deadurl= |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through a series of [[mass media]] campaigns, Mad Pride activists seek to re-educate the general public on such subjects as the causes of [[mental disorder|mental disabilities]], the experiences of those using the mental health system, and the global [[suicide]] pandemic.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  One of Mad Pride's founding activists in the UK was [[Pete Shaughnessy]], who later died by suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mentalmagazine.co.uk/pete_shaughnessy.htm#petemain Pete Shaughnessy r.i.p.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mark Roberts, [[Robert Dellar]] (who died in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.disabilitynewsservice.com/activists-mourn-robert-dellar-co-founder-of-mad-pride-and-a-tenacious-force-for-good/|title=Activists mourn Robert Dellar, co-founder of Mad Pride and a âtenacious force for goodâ|date=2016-12-22|work=Disability News Service|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Simon Barnet were among the other founders of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/mad-pride-remembering-the-uks-mental-health-pride-movement&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Mad Pride:  A celebration of mad culture'' records the early Mad Pride movement.&lt;ref name="Mad Pride"&gt;{{cite book |author=Theodore R Curtis |year=1996 |title=Mad Pride |publisher=Spare Change Books |location=Hackney, London |isbn=0-95257-445-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''On Our Own: Patient-Controlled Alternatives to the Mental Health System'', published in 1978 by [[Judi Chamberlin]], is a foundational text in the Mad Pride movement, although it was published before the movement was launched.&lt;ref name="TBG"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lawrence|first=J.M.|title=Judi Chamberlin, writings took on mental health care|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/arlington/articles/2010/01/20/judi_chamberlin_writings_took_on_mental_health_care/?page=full|accessdate=4 March 2011|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=20 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known event, specifically organized as a Pride event by people who identified as [[Psychiatric survivors movement|survivors, consumers or ex-patients of psychiatric practices]], was held on 18 September 1993, when it was called "Psychiatric Survivor Pride Day".

==[[Mad Studies]]==
[[Mad Studies]] grew out of Mad Pride and survivor thinking, and focuses on developing scholarly thinking around "mental health" by academics who self-identify as mad. As noted in ''Mad matters: a critical reader in Canadian mad studies'' (LeFranÃ§ois, Menzies and Reaume, 2013),&lt;ref name="brenda"&gt;Brenda LeFranÃ§ois, Robert Menzies and Geoffrey Reaume, editors (2013) ''Mad matters: a critical reader in Canadian mad studies'', Toronto, Canadian Scholarsâ Press Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-55130-534-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mad Studies can be defined in general terms as a project of inquiry, knowledge production, and political action devoted to the critique and transcendence of psy-centred ways of thinking, behaving, relating, and being".&lt;ref name="brenda" /&gt;{{rp|13}}  As a book, {{"'}}Mad Matters' offers a critical discussion of mental health and madness in ways that demonstrate the struggles, oppression, resistance, agency and perspectives of Mad people to challenge dominant understandings of âmental illnessâ".&lt;ref name="cas"&gt;Mark Anthony Castrodale (2014) "Mad matters: a critical reader in Canadian mad studies", ''Scandinavian Journal of Disability Research'', {{doi|10.1080/15017419.2014.895415}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}  "''Mad Studies'' is a growing, evolving, multi-voiced and interdisciplinary field of activism, theory, praxis and scholarship."&lt;ref name="cas" /&gt;{{rp|1}}

== History ==
Mad Pride was launched alongside a book of the same name, ''Mad Pride:  A celebration of mad culture'', published in 2000.&lt;ref name="Mad Pride" /&gt;  On May 11, 2008, Gabrielle Glaser documented Mad Pride in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="'Mad Pride' Fights a Stigma"&gt;{{cite news |author=Gabrielle Glaser |title='Mad Pride' Fights a Stigma |work= The New York Times |date= May 11, 2008 | publisher= The New York Times Company |access-date= May 11, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/fashion/11madpride.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glaser stated, "Just as gay-rights activists reclaimed the word [[queer]] as a [[gay pride|badge of honor]] rather than a slur, these advocates proudly call themselves mad; they say their conditions do not preclude them from productive lives."

=== Early origins ===
[[Elizabeth Packard]] (1816-1897) was deemed insane by her husband as she did not agree with his conservative political views. In Illinois at the time, involuntary admission to an asylum did not require a public hearing so long as it was a husband admitting his wife.&lt;ref name="brenda" /&gt; Due to this, Packard was institutionalized though she saw herself to be sane. In Packardâs lifetime to be labeled as âmadâ was a form of social disapproval. However, she felt solidarity among Mad people due to her experience in the institution. Though she did not personally identify as Mad and had to identify as âsaneâ in order to be an activist, it is here that we see early forms of organizing from ex-patients.&lt;ref name="brenda" /&gt;

==Mad culture and events==
[[File:2016-05-16-Mad Pride KÃ¶ln 2016-4988.jpg|thumb|Bed Push at Mad Pride parade in Cologne, Germany, in 2016]]
The Mad Pride movement has spawned recurring cultural events in [[Toronto]], [[London]], [[Paris]] and other cities around the world.  These events often include music, poetry readings, film screenings, and [[street theatre]], such as "bed push" protests, which aim to raise awareness about the poor levels of choice of treatments and the widespread [[Involuntary treatment|use of force]] in [[psychiatric hospital]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bedpush.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=2 The Great Escape Bed Push]&lt;/ref&gt; Past events have included British journalist [[Jonathan Freedland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/may/08/health.healthandwellbeing |title=Glad to be 'mad'? |work=The Guardian |first=Jo |last=Brand |date=2007-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104141912/http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2007/may/08/health.healthandwellbeing |archivedate=November 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and popular novelist Clare Allan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Misplaced pride |work=Guardian Unlimited |first=Clare |last=Allan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,1881476,00.html |date=2006-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109101343/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/story/0%2C%2C1881476%2C00.html |archivedate=January 9, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mad Pride cultural events take a variety of forms, such as the South London collective Creative Routes, the Chipmunka Publishing enterprise, and the many works of Dolly Sen.&lt;ref&gt;Dolly Sen (October 2002) ''World Is Full of Laughter:  1 Million People Commit Suicide Every Year'', Chipmunka Publishing {{ISBN|978-0-95422-181-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bed push===
[[File:peteshaughnessy.jpg|thumb|A flyer for a 2003 Mad Pride event.]]
A Bed Push is a method of activism employed by multiple mental health agencies and advocates as a method of raising awareness about psychiatric care. Activists wheel a gurney through public spaces to provoke discussion about mental health care. [[Mind Freedom]] has a recipe for a successful Bed Push on their website, urging participants to remain peaceful but also be seen by blowing horns, slightly disrupting traffic and playing music.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindfreedom.org/campaign/madpride/other-info/how-to/bed-push-tips&lt;/ref&gt; Often patients in psychiatric care feel silenced and powerless, showing resilience in the face of that and securing visibility is a method of regaining dignity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindfreedom.org/campaign/media/mf-journal&lt;/ref&gt;

Mad Pride Week in Toronto is proclaimed as such by the city itself.&lt;ref name="blogto.com"&gt;http://www.blogto.com/city/2009/07/mad_pride_breaks_the_stigma_of_mental_illness/&lt;/ref&gt; The festivities surrounding this week are highlighted by the Mad Pride Bed Push, typically on the 14th of July. The event takes place Torontoâs Queen Street West âto raise public awareness about the use of force and lack of choice for people ensnared in the Ontario mental health systemâ &lt;ref&gt;Brenda LeFranÃ§ois, Robert Menzies and Geoffrey Reaume, editors (2013) Mad matters: a critical reader in Canadian mad studies, Toronto, Canadian Scholarsâ Press Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-55130-534-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This week is officially run by Toronto Mad Pride which partners a number of mental health agencies in the city. In recent years, some advocates have pushed for [[Parkdale, Toronto]] to be renamed MAD! Village, to reclaim pride in its surrounding communities' long history of struggle with mental health and addictions &lt;ref name="blogto.com"/&gt;

A series of bed push events take place around London each year.

=== Psychiatric Patient Built Wall Tours ===
The Psychiatric Patient Built Wall Tours take place in Toronto, ON at the CAMH facility on Queen St West. The tours show the patient built walls from the 19th century that are located at present day CAMH. The purpose of the tours is to give a history on the lives of the patients who built the walls, and bring attention to the harsh realities of psychiatry.

Geoffrey Reaume and Heinz Klein first came up with the idea of walking tours as part of a Mad Pride event in 2000. The first wall tour occurred on what is now known as Mad Pride Day, on July 14, 2000, with an attendance of about fifty people. Reaume solely leads the tours, and they have grown from annual events for Mad Pride, to occurring several times throughout the year in all non-winter months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://activehistory.ca/papers/historypaper-10/|title=Psychiatric Patient Built Wall Tours at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Toronto, 2000 â 2010|date=2011-04-19|work=ActiveHistory.ca|access-date=2017-03-13|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amborella trichopoda.jpg|thumb|In the [[Order (biology)|order]] Amborellales, there is only one [[family (biology)|family]], Amborellaceae and there is only one [[genus]], ''Amborella '', and in this genus there is only one species, namely ''[[Amborella trichopoda]]''.]]

[[File:Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus wild.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus'', the [[hyacinth macaw]], is a monotypic species; no [[subspecies]] have been distinguished within it. However, the genus ''[[Anodorhynchus]]'' does include three species.]]
[[File:Cephalotus follicularis Hennern 3 (cropped).jpg|thumb|The family [[Cephalotaceae]] has only one genus, ''[[Cephalotus]]'', which contains only one species, ''[[Cephalotus follicularis]]'', the Australian pitcher plant.]]{{Wiktionary|monotypic}}

In [[biology]], a '''monotypic taxon''' is a taxonomic group ([[taxon]]) that contains only one immediately subordinate taxon.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr E, Ashlock PD. (1991). ''Principles of Systematic Zoology'' (2nd ed.). McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-07-041144-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A monotypic [[species]] is one that does not include [[subspecies]] or smaller, infraspecific taxa.{{Cn|date=August 2017}} In the case of genera, the term "unispecific" or "monospecific" is sometimes preferred.

In [[botanical nomenclature]], a '''monotypic genus''' is a [[genus (biology)|genus]] in the special case where a genus and a single species are simultaneously described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Reine, W.F.P.h.V. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011|volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154|publisher=A.R.G. Gantner Verlag KG|isbn=978-3-87429-425-6}} articles 38.5 and 38.6&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast an '''oligotypic taxon''' contains more than one but only a very few subordinate taxa.

==Examples==
Just as the term ''monotypic'' is used to describe a taxon including only one subdivision, one can also refer to the contained taxon as monotypic within the higher-level taxon, e.g. a genus monotypic within a family. Some examples of monotypic groups are:
* In the [[Order (biology)|order]] Amborellales, there is only one [[family (biology)|family]], Amborellaceae and there is only one [[genus]], ''[[Amborella]]'', and in this genus there is only one species, namely ''Amborella trichopoda''
* The family [[Cephalotaceae]] includes only one genus, ''[[Cephalotus]]'', and only one species, ''Cephalotus follicularis'' â the [[Albany pitcher plant]].
* ''Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus'', the [[hyacinth macaw]], is a monotypic species; no [[subspecies]] have been distinguished within the species.
* ''Panurus biarmicus'', the [[bearded reedling]], has a few subspecies across its range, but belongs to the genus ''[[Panurus]]'', which current knowledge considers monotypic (the only genus) within the family [[Panuridae]].
* ''[[Ozichthys albimaculosus]]'', the cream-spotted cardinalfish, found in tropical Australia and southern New Guinea, is the type species of the monotypic genus ''Ozichthys''.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, T. H. (2014). "A new genus of cardinalfish from tropical Australia and southern New Guinea (Percomorpha: Apogonidae)". ''Zootaxa'' 3852 (2): 283â293.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The flowering plant ''Breonadia salicina'' is the only species in the monotypic genus ''[[Breonadia]]''.
* The [[madrone butterfly]] is the only species in the monotypic genus ''Eucheira''. However, there are two sub-species of this butterfly, ''E. socialis socialis'' and ''E. socialis westwoodi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=P.G.|first=Kevan,|last2=R.A.|first2=Bye,|date=1991|title=natural history, sociobiology, and ethnobiology of Eucheira socialis Westwood (Lepidoptera: Pieridae), a unique and little-known butterfly from Mexico|url=http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301742531|journal=Entomologist|language=English|issn=0013-8878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Nasir al-Din Tusi was born in the city of [[Tus, Iran|Tus]] in medieval [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] (northeastern [[Iran]]) in the year 1201 and began his studies at an early age. In Hamadan and Tus he studied the [[Quran]], [[hadith]], [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]], logic, philosophy, mathematics, medicine and astronomy.&lt;ref name="Dabashi"&gt;Dabashi, Hamid. "Khwajah Nasir al-Din Tusi: The philosopher/vizier and the intellectual climate of his times". Routledge History of World Philosophies. Vol I. History of Islamic Philosophy. Seyyed Hossein Nasr and Oliver Leaman (eds.) London: Routledge. 1996. p. 529&lt;/ref&gt;

He was apparently born into a ShÄ«âah family and lost his father at a young age. Fulfilling the wish of his father, the young Muhammad took learning and scholarship very seriously and traveled far and wide to attend the lectures of renowned scholars and acquire the knowledge, an exercise highly encouraged in his Islamic faith. At a young age, he moved to [[Nishapur]] to study philosophy under Farid al-Din Damad and mathematics under [[Muhammad Hasib]].&lt;ref name="HistMuslimPhil"&gt;Siddiqi, Bakhtyar Husain. "Nasir al-Din Tusi". A History of Islamic Philosophy. Vol 1. M. M. Sharif (ed.). Wiesbaden:: Otto Harrossowitz. 1963. p. 565&lt;/ref&gt; He met also [[Attar of Nishapur]], the legendary [[Sufism|Sufi master]] who was later killed by  the [[Mongols]], and he attended the lectures of [[Qutb al-Din al-Misri]].

In [[Mosul]] he studied mathematics and astronomy with [[Kamal al-Din Yunus]] (d. [[Hijri year|AH]] 639 / AD 1242), a pupil of [[Sharaf al-DÄ«n al-á¹¬Å«sÄ«]].&lt;ref name=MacT&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Al-Tusi_Sharaf.html Sharaf al-Din al-Muzaffar al-Tusi biography - MacTutor History of Mathematics]&lt;/ref&gt; Later on he corresponded with [[Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi]], the son-in-law of [[Ibn Arabi]], and it seems that mysticism, as propagated by Sufi masters of his time, was not appealing to his mind and once the occasion was suitable, he composed his own manual of philosophical Sufism in the form of a small booklet entitled ''Awsaf al-Ashraf'' "The Attributes of the Illustrious".

As the armies of [[Genghis Khan]] swept his homeland, he was employed by the [[Nizari Ismaili state]] and made his most important contributions in science during this time when he was moving from one stronghold to another.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Willey, ''The Eagle's Nest: Ismaili Castles in Iran and Syria'', (I.B. Tauris, 2005), 172.&lt;/ref&gt; He was captured after the invasion of [[Alamut Castle]] by the Mongol forces.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Axworthy]], ''A History of Iran: Empire of the Mind'', (Basic Books, 2008), 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Tusi has about 150 works, of which 25 are in [[Persian language|Persian]] and the remaining are in [[Arabic language|Arabic]],&lt;ref name="H. Daiber, F.J. Ragep 2007"/&gt; and there is one treatise in Persian, Arabic and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr. The Islamic Intellectual Tradition in Persia. Curson Press, 1996. See p. 208: "Nearly 150 treatises and letters by Nasir al-Din Tusi are known, of which 25 are in Persian and the rest in Arabic. There is even a treatise on geomancy which Tusi wrote in Arabic, Persian, and Turkish, demonstrating his mastery of all three languages."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tusi manus.jpg|thumb|right|A Treatise on the [[Astrolabe]] by Tusi, Isfahan 1505]]

Here are some of his major works:
*''KitÄb al-Shakl al-qattÄÊ´''  Book on the complete quadrilateral. A five-volume summary of trigonometry.
*''Al-Tadhkirah fi'ilm al-hay'ah'' â A memoir on the science of astronomy. Many commentaries were written about this work called Sharh al-Tadhkirah (A Commentary on al-Tadhkirah) - Commentaries were written by [[al-Birjandi|Abd al-Ali ibn Muhammad ibn al-Husayn al-Birjandi]] and by [[Nazzam Nishapuri]].
*''[[Akhlaq-i Nasiri]]'' â A work on ethics.
*''al-Risalah al-Asturlabiyah'' â A Treatise on the astrolabe.
*''[[Zij-i Ilkhani]]'' (''Ilkhanic Tables'') â A major astronomical treatise, completed in 1272.
*''[[Sharh al-Isharat]]'' (''Commentary on Avicenna's Isharat'')
*''[[Awsaf al-Ashraf]]'' a short mystical-ethical work in Persian
*''[[TajrÄ«d al-IÊ¿tiqÄd]]'' (Summation of Belief) â A commentary on Shia doctrines.
*''[[Talkhis al-Muhassal]]'' (summary of summaries).

During his stay in Nishapur, Tusi established a reputation as an exceptional scholar. Tusiâs prose writing, which numbers over 150 works, represent one of the largest collections by a single Islamic author. Writing in both [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], Nasir al-Din Tusi dealt with both religious ("Islamic") topics and non-religious or secular subjects ("the ancient sciences").&lt;ref name="H. Daiber, F.J. Ragep 2007"&gt;H. Daiber, F.J. Ragep, "Tusi" in Encyclopaedia of Islam. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2007. Brill Online.

===Astronomy===
{{further|Zij-i Ilkhani|Tusi-couple}}
[[File:Nasir al-Din al-Tusi at observatory.jpg|thumb|The Astronomical Observatory of Nasir al-[[DÄ«n]] Tusi.]]
Tusi convinced [[Hulegu Khan]] to construct an observatory for establishing accurate astronomical tables for better astrological predictions. Beginning in 1259, the [[Maragheh observatory|Rasad Khaneh observatory]] was constructed in [[Azarbaijan]], south of the river [[Aras (river)|Aras]], and to the west of [[Maragheh]], the capital of the [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanate Empire]].&lt;ref name="Rossabi2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Morris Rossabi|title=From Yuan to Modern China and Mongolia: The Writings of Morris Rossabi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GXejBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=28 November 2014|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-28529-3|pages=281â}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the observations in this for the time being most advanced observatory, Tusi made very accurate tables of [[Ephemeris|planetary movements]] as depicted in his book ''[[Zij-i ilkhani]]'' (''Ilkhanic Tables''). This book contains astronomical tables for calculating the positions of the planets and the names of the stars. His model for the planetary system is believed to be the most advanced of his time, and was used extensively until the development of the heliocentric model in the time of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]. Between [[Ptolemy]] and [[Copernicus]], he is considered by many{{who|date=April 2014}} to be one of the most eminent astronomers of his time. His famous student ''Shams ad-Din Al-Bukhari'' &lt;ref name="Shams"/&gt; was the teacher of [[Byzantine]] scholar ''Gregory Chioniadis,'' &lt;ref name="Chioniadis"&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=201288}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had in turn trained [[astronomer]] ''[[Manuel Bryennios]]'' &lt;ref name="Bryennios"&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=184632}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 1300 in [[Constantinople]].

For his planetary models, he invented a geometrical technique called a [[Tusi-couple]], which generates linear motion from the sum of two circular motions. He used this technique to replace [[Ptolemy]]'s problematic [[equant]]&lt;ref&gt;Craig G. Fraser, '[https://books.google.com/books?id=3tJr_vl6rYsC&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The cosmos: a historical perspective]', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006 p.39&lt;/ref&gt; for many planets, but was unable to find a solution to Mercury, which was solved later by [[Ibn al-Shatir]] as well as [[Ali Qushji]].&lt;ref&gt;George Saliba, '[http://www.tad.org.tr/wp-content/files/webfiles/alikuscu_makale_saliba.pdf Al-Qushji's Reform of the Ptolemaic Model for Mercury]', Arabic Sciences and Philosophy, v.3 1993, pp.161-203&lt;/ref&gt;  The Tusi couple was later employed in [[Ibn al-Shatir]]'s [[geocentric model]] and [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]' [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican model]].&lt;ref&gt;George Saliba, 'Revisiting the Astronomical Contacts Between the World of Islam and Renaissance Europe: The Byzantine Connection', '[https://books.google.com/books?id=muGVUiKEYccC&amp;lpg=PA368&amp;pg=PA368#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The occult sciences in Byzantium]', 2006, p.368&lt;/ref&gt; He also calculated the value for the annual precession of the [[equinox]]es and contributed to the construction and usage of some astronomical instruments including the [[astrolabe]].

á¹¬Å«sÄ« criticized Ptolemy's use of observational evidence to show that the Earth was at rest, noting that such proofs were not decisive. Although it doesn't mean that he was a supporter of mobility of the earth, as he and his 16th-century commentator [[al-Birjandi|al-BÄ«rjandÄ«]], maintained that the earth's immobility could be demonstrated, only by physical principles found in natural philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ragep | first = F.

About the real essence of the Milky Way, á¹¬Å«sÄ« in his ''Tadhkira'' writes:
"The Milky Way, i.e. the galaxy, is made up of a very large number of small, tightly-clustered stars, which, on account of their concentration and smallness, seem to be cloudy patches. because of this, it was likened to milk in color."

Three centuries later the proof of the Milky Way consisting of many stars came in 1610 when [[Galileo Galilei]] used a [[Optical telescope|telescope]] to study the Milky Way and discovered that it is really composed of a huge number of faint stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= O'Connor, J.

===Logic===
Nasir al-Din Tusi was a supporter of [[Avicennian logic]], and wrote the following commentary on [[Avicenna]]'s theory of absolute [[proposition]]s:

{{quote|"What spurred him to this was that in the [[assertoric]] [[syllogistic]] [[Aristotle]] and others sometimes used [[Contradiction|contradictories]] of absolute propositions on the assumption that they are absolute; and that was why so many decided that absolutes did contradict absolutes. When Avicenna had shown this to be wrong, he wanted to develop a method of construing those examples from Aristotle."&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite web|author=Tony Street|title=Arabic and Islamic Philosophy of Language and Logic|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date=July 23, 2008|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arabic-islamic-language|accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Mathematics===
[[File:Stamps of Azerbaijan, 2009-861.jpg|thumb|upright|A stamp issued in the republic of Azerbaijan in 2009 honoring Tusi]]
Al-Tusi was the first to write a work on trigonometry independently of astronomy.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=trigonometry|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/605281/trigonometry|publisher=''[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]]''|accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Tusi, in his ''Treatise on the Quadrilateral'', gave an extensive exposition of [[spherical trigonometry]], distinct from astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;* Katz, Victor J. (1993). ''A History of Mathematics: An Introduction'', p259. [[Addison Wesley]]. {{ISBN|0-673-38039-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was in the works of Al-Tusi that trigonometry achieved the status of an independent branch of pure mathematics distinct from astronomy, to which it had been linked for so long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bosworth|first=Clifford E.|title=History of civilizations of Central Asia.|date=2003|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=81-208-1596-3|author2=Asimov|volume=4|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayes|first=John R.|title=The genius of Arab civilization : source of Renaissance|date=1983|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0-262-08136-9|edition=2nd|author2=Badeau, John S.|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the first to list the six distinct cases of a right triangle in spherical trigonometry.&lt;ref&gt; http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Al-Tusi_Nasir.html,"One of al-Tusi's most important mathematical contributions was the creation of trigonometry as a mathematical discipline in its own right rather than as just a tool for astronomical applications. In Treatise on the quadrilateral al-Tusi gave the first extant exposition of the whole system of plane and spherical trigonometry. This work is really the first in history on trigonometry as an independent branch of pure mathematics and the first in which all six cases for a right-angled spherical triangle are set forth"/&lt;/ref&gt;

This followed earlier work by [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematicians]] such as [[Menelaus of Alexandria]], who wrote a book on spherical trigonometry called ''Sphaerica,'' and the earlier Muslim mathematicians [[AbÅ« al-WafÄ' al-BÅ«zjÄnÄ«]] and [[Al-Jayyani]].

In his ''On the Sector Figure'', appears the famous [[law of sines]] for plane triangles.&lt;ref name=Berggren-518&gt;{{cite book | first=J. Lennart | last=Berggren | title=The Mathematics of Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, India, and Islam: A Sourcebook | chapter=Mathematics in Medieval Islam | publisher=Princeton University Press | date=2007 | isbn=978-0-691-11485-9 | page=518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C} &lt;/math&gt;

He also stated the law of sines for spherical triangles,&lt;ref&gt;''Also the 'sine law' (of geometry and trigonometry, applicable to spherical trigonometry) is attributed, among others, to Alkhujandi. (The three others are Abul Wafa Bozjani, Nasiruddin Tusi, and Abu Nasr Mansur).'' Razvi, Syed Abbas Hasan (1991) ''A history of science, technology, and culture in Central Asia, Volume 1'' University of Peshawar, Peshawar, Pakistan, page 358, {{OCLC|26317600}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bijli suggests that three mathematicians are in contention for the honor, Alkhujandi, Abdul-Wafa and Mansur, leaving out Nasiruddin Tusi. Bijli, Shah Muhammad and Delli, Idarah-i AdabiyÄt-i (2004) ''Early Muslims and their contribution to science: ninth to fourteenth century'' Idarah-i Adabiyat-i Delli, Delhi, India, page 44, {{OCLC|66527483}}&lt;/ref&gt; discovered the [[law of tangents]] for spherical triangles, and provided proofs for these laws.&lt;ref name=Berggren-518/&gt;

===Biology===
In his ''Akhlaq-i Nasiri'', Tusi wrote about several biological topics. He defended a version of Aristotle's ''[[scala naturae]]'', in which he placed man above animals, plants, minerals, and the elements. He described "grasses which grow without sowing or cultivation, by the mere mingling of elements,"&lt;ref name="NEp44"&gt;Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen &amp; Unwin, p.&amp;nbsp;44.&lt;/ref&gt; as closest to minerals. Among plants, he considered the [[date-palm]] as the most highly developed, since "it only lacks one thing further to reach (the stage of) an animal: to tear itself loose from the soil and to move away in the quest for nourishment."&lt;ref name="NEp44" /&gt;

The lowest animals "are adjacent to the region of plants: such are those animals which propagate like grass, being incapable of mating [...], e.g. earthworms, and certain insects".&lt;ref&gt;Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen &amp; Unwin, p.&amp;nbsp;45.&lt;/ref&gt; The animals "which reach the stage of perfection [...] are distinguished by fully developed weapons", such as antlers, horns, teeth, and claws. Tusi described these organs as adaptations to each species's lifestyle, in a way anticipating [[natural theology]]. He continued:

{{quote|"The noblest of the species is that one whose sagacity and perception is such that it accepts discipline and instruction: thus there accrues to it the perfection not originally created in it. Such are the schooled horse and the trained falcon. The greater this faculty grows in it, the more surpassing its rank, until a point is reached where the (mere) observation of action suffices as instruction: thus, when they see a thing, they perform the like of it by mimicry, without training [...]. This is the utmost of the animal degrees, and the first of the degrees of Man in contiguous therewith."&lt;ref&gt;Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen &amp; Unwin, p.&amp;nbsp;45f.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, in this paragraph, Tusi described different types of [[learning]], recognising [[observational learning]] as the most advanced form, and correctly attributing it to certain animals.

Tusi seems to have perceived man as belonging to the animals, since he stated that "the Animal Soul [comprising the faculties of perception and movement ...] is restricted to individuals of the animal species", and that, by possessing a "Human Soul, [...] mankind is distinguished and particularized among ''other'' animals."&lt;ref&gt;Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen &amp; Unwin, p.&amp;nbsp;42 (emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have interpreted Tusi's biological writings as suggesting that he adhered to some kind of [[evolution]]ary theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Alakbarli |first=Farid |authorlink=Farid Alakbarli |date=Summer 2001 |title=A 13th-Century Darwin? Tusi's Views on Evolution |url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/92_folder/92_articles/92_tusi.html |journal=[[Azerbaijan International]] |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=48â49 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shoja |first1=M.M. |last2=Tubbs | first2=R.S. |year=2007 |title=The history of anatomy in Persia |journal=[[Journal of Anatomy]] |volume=210 |pages=359â378 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7580.2007.00711.x |pmc=2100290 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tusi did not state explicitly that he believed species to change over time.

===Chemistry===
Tusi contributed to the field of chemistry, stating an early law of conservation of mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alakbarli|first1=Farid|title=A 13th-Century Darwin? Tusi's Views on Evolution|journal=Azerbaijan International|date=2001|volume=9|issue=2 (Summer 2001)|pages=48-49|url=https://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/92_folder/92_articles/92_tusi.html|accessdate=27 January 2018 |quote=While this reasoning may seem backward to today's Western mind, some of Tusi's theories did have merit. For instance, Tusi believed that a body of matter is able to change, but is not able to entirely disappear. He wrote: 'A body of matter cannot disappear completely. It only changes its form, condition, composition, color and other properties and turns into a different complex or elementary matter'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and legacy==
A 60-km diameter lunar [[Impact crater|crater]] located on the southern hemisphere of the [[moon]] is named after him as "[[Nasireddin (crater)|Nasireddin]]". A [[minor planet]] [[10269 Tusi]] discovered by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astronomer [[Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh]] in 1979 is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2003ASPC..289..157B |title=2003ASPC..289..157B Page 157 |publisher=Adsabs.harvard.edu |accessdate=2013-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?q=10269+tusi&amp;hl=lt |title=10269 tusi - Mano biblioteka - Google knygos |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[K.

'''Ned Joel Block''' (born 1942) is an American [[philosopher]] working in [[philosophy of mind]] who has made important contributions to the understanding of [[consciousness]] and the philosophy of [[cognitive science]].  He has been professor of [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] at [[New York University]] since 1996.

==Education and career==
Block obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1971 under the direction of [[Hilary Putnam]]. He joined the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) as an assistant professor of philosophy (1971â1977), and then served as associate professor of philosophy (1977â1983), professor of philosophy (1983â1996) and as chair of the philosophy section (1989â1995). He has, since 1996, been a professor in the departments of [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] at [[New York University]] (NYU).

Block received the [[Jean Nicod Prize]] in 2013, and has given the [[William James Lectures]] at [[Harvard University]] in 2012 and the [[John Locke Lectures]] at [[Oxford University]] in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/john-locke-lectures#collapse1-3|title=The John Locke Lectures - Faculty of Philosophy|website=www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; among many others.

Block is Past President of the [[Society for Philosophy and Psychology]] and was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amacad.org/content/news/pressReleases.aspx?pr=59|title=Press Releases - American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences|website=www.amacad.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is married to the developmental psychologist [[Susan Carey]].

==Philosophical work==

Block is noted for presenting the [[Blockhead argument]] against the [[Turing Test]] as a test of [[Intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] in a paper titled ''[http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/papers/Psychologism.htm Psychologism and Behaviorism]'' (1981). He is also known for his criticism of [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], arguing that a [[system]] with the same [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functional state]]s as a human is not necessarily conscious. In his more recent work on [[consciousness]], he has made a distinction between [[phenomenal consciousness]] and [[Phenomenal consciousness#Phenomenal and access consciousness|access consciousness]], where phenomenal consciousness consists of subjective experience and feelings and access consciousness consists of that information globally available in the cognitive system for the purposes of reasoning, speech and high-level action control. He has argued that access consciousness and phenomenal consciousness might not always coincide in human beings.

Block has been a judge at the [[Loebner Prize]] contest, a contest in the tradition of the Turing Test to determine whether a conversant is a computer or a human.

In [[software development]], '''obfuscation''' is the deliberate act of creating [[source code|source]] or [[machine code]] that is difficult for humans to understand. Like [[obfuscation]] in [[natural language]], it may use needlessly roundabout expressions to compose statements.
Programmers may deliberately obfuscate code to conceal its purpose ([[security through obscurity]]) or its logic or implicit values embedded in it, primarily, in order to prevent tampering, deter [[reverse engineering]], or even as a [[puzzle]] or recreational challenge for someone reading the source code. This can be done manually or by using an automated tool, the latter being the preferred technique in industry.

==Overview==
The architecture and characteristics of some languages may make them easier to obfuscate than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Binstock |first=Andrew |url=http://www.devx.com/microsoftISV/Article/11351 |title=Obfuscation: Cloaking your Code from Prying Eyes |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2003-03-06 |accessdate=2013-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420165109/http://www.devx.com/microsoftISV/Article/11351 |archivedate=April 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Atwood |first=Jeff |url=http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000291.html |title=Jeff Atwood, May 15, 2005 |publisher=Codinghorror.com |date=2005-05-15 |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[C (programming language)|C]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenter.demon.nl/obfuscate.html |title=Obfuscation |publisher=Kenter.demon.nl |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[C++]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=38102 |title=C++ Tutorials - Obfuscated Code - A Simple Introduction |publisher=DreamInCode.net |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/rcorcs/posts/obfuscatedcode |title=C Tutorials - Obfuscated Code in C |publisher=Sites.google.com |date=2011-07-07 |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Perl]] [[programming language]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=As of 2013-11-25 18:22 GMT |url=http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=291267 |title=Pe(a)rls in line noise |publisher=Perlmonks.org |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; are some examples of languages easy to obfuscate.

==Recreational obfuscation==

Writing and reading obfuscated source code can be a [[brain teaser]]. A number of programming contests reward the most creatively obfuscated code, such as the [[International Obfuscated C Code Contest]] and the [[Obfuscated Perl Contest]].

Types of obfuscations include simple keyword substitution, use or non-use of whitespace to create artistic effects, and self-generating or heavily compressed programs.

According to [[Nick Montfort]], techniques may include: 
# naming obfuscation, which includes naming variables in a meaningless or deceptive way; 
# data/code/comment confusion, which includes making some actual code look like comments or confusing syntax with data; 
# double coding, which can be displaying code in poetry form or interesting shapes. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Montfort |first=Nick |url=http://obfuscationsymposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Montfort__Obfuscated_Code.pdf |title=Obfuscated code |accessdate=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Short obfuscated [[Perl]] programs may be used in [[Signature block|signatures]] of Perl programmers.  These are JAPHs ("[[Just another Perl hacker]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rochester.pm.org/talks/japh_discussion.txt |title=JAPH - Just Another Perl Hacker |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=pm.org |publisher=Perl Mongers |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516074850/http://rochester.pm.org/talks/japh_discussion.txt |archive-date=16 May 2013 |access-date=27 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages of obfuscation==
There are several advantages of automated code obfuscation that have made it popular and widely useful across many platforms. On some platforms (such as Java.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5765412-decompiling-java|title="Decompiling Java" by Godfrey Nolan|publisher=Apress;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Android,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14975259-decompiling-android|title="Decompiling Android" by Godfrey Nolan|publisher=Apress;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and .NET) a [[decompiler]] can reverse-engineer source code from an executable or library. 
A main advantage of automated code obfuscation is that it helps protect the trade secrets (intellectual property) contained within software by making reverse-engineering a program difficult and economically unfeasible. Other advantages might include helping to protect licensing mechanisms and unauthorized access, and shrinking the size of the executable. Decompilation is sometimes called a man-at-the-end attack, based on the traditional cryptographic attack known as "[[Man-in-the-middle attack|man-in-the-middle]]".

==Disadvantages of obfuscation==
While obfuscation can make reading, writing, and reverse-engineering a program difficult and time-consuming, it will not necessarily make it impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.ias.edu/~boaz/Papers/obf_informal.html |title="Can We Obfuscate Programs?" by Boaz Barak |publisher=Math.ias.edu |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some anti-virus software, such as [[AVG AntiVirus]],{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} will also alert their users when they land on a site with code that is manually obfuscated, as one of the purposes of obfuscation can be to hide malicious code. However, some developers may employ code obfuscation for the purpose of reducing file size or increasing security. The average user may not expect their antivirus software to provide alerts about an otherwise harmless piece of code, especially from trusted corporations, so such a feature may actually deter users from using legitimate software.

==Obfuscating software==
A variety of tools exist to perform or assist with code obfuscation.
These include experimental research tools created by academics, hobbyist tools,
commercial products written by professionals, and [[open-source software]].
There also exist deobfuscation tools that attempt to perform the reverse
transformation.

Although the majority of commercial obfuscation solutions work by transforming
either program source
code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Languages/JavaScript/Tools/Obfuscators/ |title=Open Directory - Computers: Programming: Languages: JavaScript: Tools: Obfuscators |publisher=Dmoz.org |date=2013-08-03 |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Languages/PHP/Development_Tools/Obfuscation_and_Encryption/ |title=Open Directory - Computers: Programming: Languages: PHP: Development Tools: Obfuscation and Encryption |publisher=Dmoz.org |date=2013-09-19 |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; or platform-independent bytecode as used by
Java&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Languages/Java/Development_Tools/Obfuscators/ |title=Open Directory - Computers: Programming: Languages: Java: Development Tools: Obfuscators |publisher=Dmoz.org |date=2013-04-09 |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
.NET,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Component_Frameworks/NET/Tools/Obfuscators/ |title=Open Directory - Computers: Programming: Component Frameworks: .NET: Tools: Obfuscators |publisher=Dmoz.org |date=2007-01-02 |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are also some that work directly on compiled binaries.

==Obfuscation and copyleft licenses==

There has been debate on whether it is illegal to skirt [[copyleft]] software licenses by releasing source code in obfuscated form, such as in cases in which the author is less willing to make the source code available. The issue is addressed in the [[GNU General Public License]] by defining source code as the "preferred" version of the source code be made available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/431651/ |title=Reasoning behind the "preferred form of the work for making modifications to it" language in the GPL |publisher=Lwn.net |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GNU website states "Obfuscated 'source code' is not real source code and does not count as source code." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html |title=What is free software? |publisher=gnu.net |accessdate=2014-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation did not go well, for several reasons.

Sampling equipment was accidentally activated by local radio signals and conditions at sea made it impossible to accurately measure the amount of bacteria in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=bbc-operation-harness/&gt;

500 of 600 [[sheep]] were found to be unsuitable and were shot.&lt;ref name=bbc-operation-harness/&gt; [[Guinea pig]]s were found to be "disastrous".&lt;ref name=bbc-operation-harness/&gt; 234 [[rhesus macaque]]s had to be treated for pneumonia before being used.&lt;ref name=bbc-operation-harness/&gt;

'''Philosophical skepticism''' ([[American and British English spelling differences|UK spelling]]: '''scepticism'''; from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ÏÎºÎ­ÏÎ¹Ï ''skepsis'', "inquiry") is a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] school of thought that questions the possibility of certainty in knowledge. Skeptic philosophers from different historical periods adopted different principles and arguments, but their ideology can be generalized as either (1) the denial of possibility of all knowledge or (2) the suspension of judgement due to the inadequacy of evidence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Philosophy of skepticism==
Skepticism is not a single position but covers a range of different positions. In the ancient world there were two main skeptical traditions. [[Academic skepticism]] took the dogmatic position that knowledge was not possible; [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonian skeptics]] refused to take a dogmatic position on any issueâincluding skepticism. [[Radical skepticism]] ends in the paradoxical claim that one cannot know anythingâincluding that one cannot know about knowing anything.

Skepticism can be classified according to its scope. [[Local skepticism]] involves being skeptical about particular areas of knowledge, e.g. moral skepticism, skepticism about the external world, or skepticism about other minds, whereas [[global skepticism]] is skeptical about the possibility of any knowledge at all.

Skepticism can also be classified according to its method. In the [[Western philosophy|Western]] tradition there are two basic approaches to skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Williams|first = Michael |title = Problems of Knowledge: A Critical Introduction to Epistemology|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2001|chapter = Chapter 5: Agrippa's Trilemma |page= 61| isbn=978-0192892560}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cartesian skepticism]] ânamed somewhat misleadingly after [[RenÃ© Descartes]], who was not a skeptic but used some traditional skeptical arguments in his [[Meditations on First Philosophy|Meditations]] to help establish his [[Rationalism|rationalist]] approach to knowledgeâ attempts to show that any proposed knowledge claim can be doubted. [[Agrippan Trilemma|Agrippan skepticism]] focuses on the process of justification rather than the possibility of doubt. According to this view there are three ways in which one might attempt to justify a claim but none of them are adequate: one can keep on providing further justification but this leads to an infinite regress; one can stop at a dogmatic assertion; or one can argue in circular reasoning, never reaching a viable conclusion.

Philosophical skepticism is distinguished from [[methodological skepticism]] in that philosophical skepticism is an approach that questions the possibility of [[epistemology|certainty in knowledge]], whereas methodological skepticism is an approach that subjects all knowledge claims to scrutiny with the goal of sorting out true from false claims.

=== Schools ===&lt;!--[[Renaissance skepticism]] and [[Renaissance scepticism]] redirect here---&gt;
Philosophical skepticism begins with the claim that the skeptic currently does not have knowledge. Some adherents maintain that knowledge is, in theory, possible. It could be argued that [[Socrates]] held that view. He appears to have thought that if people continue to ask questions they might eventually come to have knowledge; but that they did not have it yet. Some skeptics have gone further and claimed that true knowledge is impossible, for example the Academic school in Ancient Greece well after the time of Carneades. A third skeptical approach would be neither to accept nor reject the possibility of knowledge.

Skepticism can be either about everything or about particular areas. A 'global' skeptic argues that he does not absolutely know anything to be either true or false. Academic global skepticism has great difficulty in supporting this claim while maintaining philosophical rigor, since it seems to require that nothing can be knownâexcept for the knowledge that nothing can be known, though in its probabilistic form it can use and support the notion of weight of evidence. Thus, some probabilists avoid extreme skepticism by maintaining that they merely are 'reasonably certain' (or 'largely believe') some things are real or true. As for using probabilistic arguments to defend skepticism, in a sense this enlarges or increases scepticism, while the defence of empiricism by Empiricus weakens skepticism and strengthens dogmatism by alleging that sensory appearances are beyond doubt. Much later, Kant would re-define "dogmatism" to make indirect realism about the external world seem objectionable. While many Hellenists, outside of Empiricus,  would maintain that everyone who is not sceptical about everything is a dogmatist, this position would seem too extreme for most later philosophers.

Nevertheless, A Pyrrhonian global skeptic labors under no such modern constraint, since he only alleged that he, personally, did not know anything and made no statement about the possibility of knowledge. Nor did Arcesilaus feel bound, since he merely corrected Socrates's "I only know that I know nothing" by adding "I don't even know that", thus more fully rejecting dogmatism.

[[local skepticism|''Local'' skeptics]] deny that people do or can have knowledge of a particular area. They may be skeptical about the possibility of one form of knowledge without doubting other forms. Different kinds of local skepticism may emerge, depending on the area. A person may doubt the [[truth value]] of different types of journalism, for example, depending on the types of media they trust.

In [[Islamic philosophy]], skepticism was established by [[Al-Ghazali]] (1058â1111), known in the West as "Algazel", as part of the [[Ash'ari]] school of [[Islamic theology]].

[[Francisco Sanches]]'s ''[[That Nothing is Known]]'' (published in 1581 as ''Quod nihil scitur'') is one of the crucial texts of '''[[Renaissance]] skepticism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Sanchez, [https://books.google.com/books/about/That_Nothing_is_Known.html?id=nO6nn8hsve8C&amp;redir_esc=y ''That Nothing is Known''], Cambridge University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epistemology and skepticism===
Skepticism, as an [[epistemology|epistemological]] argument, poses the question of whether knowledge, in the first place, is possible. Skeptics argue that the belief in something does not necessarily justify an assertion of knowledge of it. In this, skeptics oppose [[dogmatic foundationalism]], which states that there have to be some basic positions that are self-justified or beyond justification, without reference to others. (One example of such foundationalism may be found in [[Spinoza]]'s ''Ethics''.) The skeptical response to this can take several approaches. First, claiming that "basic positions" must exist amounts to the logical fallacy of [[argument from ignorance]] combined with the [[slippery slope]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

Among other arguments, skeptics used [[Agrippa's trilemma]], named after [[Agrippa the Sceptic]], to claim no certain belief could be achieved. [[Foundationalism|Foundationalist]]s have used the same ''trilemma'' as a justification for demanding the validity of basic beliefs.

This skeptical approach is rarely taken to its pyrrhonean extreme by most practitioners. Several modifications have arisen over the years, including the following [http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/skept.htm#fideism]:

[[Fictionalism]] would not claim to have knowledge but will adhere to conclusions on some criterion such as utility, aesthetics, or other personal criteria without claiming that any conclusion is actually "true".

Philosophical fideism (as opposed to religious [[Fideism]]) would assert the truth of some propositions, but does so without asserting certainty.

Some forms of [[pragmatism]] would accept utility as a provisional guide to truth but not necessarily a universal decision-maker.

There are two different categories of epistemological skepticism, which can be referred to as mitigated and unmitigated skepticism. The two forms are contrasting but are still true forms of [[skepticism]].  Mitigated skepticism does not accept "strong" or "strict" knowledge claims but does, however, approve specific weaker ones.  These weaker claims can be assigned the title of "virtual knowledge", but must be to justified belief.  Unmitigated skepticism rejects both claims of virtual knowledge and strong knowledge.&lt;ref name="SKEPTICISM"&gt;{{cite journal|title=SKEPTICISM|journal=Encyclopedia of Empiricism|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Characterising knowledge as strong, weak, virtual or genuine can be determined differently depending on a person's viewpoint as well as their characterisation of knowledge.&lt;ref name="SKEPTICISM"/&gt;

===Criticism of skepticism===
Most philosophies have weaknesses and can be criticized and this is a general principle of progression in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, H and Stroll, A. ''Philosophy Made Simpleââ  Broadway Books, NY, NY 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy of skepticism asserts that no truth is knowable&lt;ref&gt;Kreeft, Peter &amp; Tacelli, R. K ''Handbook of Christian Apologetics'', IVP Academic, Ill. 1994, p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; or only probable.&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; Some say the scientific method also asserts probable findings, because the number of cases tested is always limited and they constitute perceptual observations.&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; Another criticism is the proposition that âno truth is knowableâ is knowably true is contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;Kreeft p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; The [[here is one hand]] argument is also another relatively simple criticism that reverses the skeptic's proposals and supports common sense.

Pierre Le Morvan (2011) has distinguished between three broad philosophical approaches to skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pdcnet.org/logos-episteme/content/logos-episteme_2011_0002_0001_0087_0102&lt;/ref&gt; The first he calls the "Foil Approach." According to the latter, skepticism is treated as a problem to be solved, or challenge to be met, or threat to be parried; skepticismâs value on this view, insofar as it is deemed to have one, accrues from its role as a foil contrastively illuminating what is required for knowledge and justified belief. The second he calls the "Bypass Approach" according to which skepticism is bypassed as a central concern of epistemology. Le Morvan advocates a third approachâhe dubs it the "Health Approach"âthat explores when skepticism is healthy and when it is not, or when it is virtuous and when it is vicious.

===Skeptical hypotheses===
A skeptical hypothesis is a hypothetical situation which can be used in an argument for [[skepticism]] about a particular claim or class of claims. Usually the hypothesis posits the existence of a deceptive power that deceives our senses and undermines the justification of knowledge otherwise accepted as justified. Skeptical hypotheses have received much attention in modern Western philosophy.

The first skeptical hypothesis in modern [[Western philosophy]] appears in [[RenÃ© Descartes]]' ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''. At the end of the first Meditation Descartes writes:  "I will suppose... that some evil demon of the utmost power and cunning has employed all his energies to deceive me."

* The "[[brain in a vat]]" hypothesis is cast in scientific terms. It supposes that one might be a disembodied brain kept alive in a vat, and fed false sensory signals, by a [[mad scientist]].
* The "[[dream argument]]" of Descartes and [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]] supposes reality to be indistinguishable from a dream.
* Descartes' [[evil demon]] is a being "as clever and deceitful as he is powerful, who has directed his entire effort to misleading me".
* The [[five minute hypothesis]] (or [[omphalos hypothesis]] or [[Last Thursdayism]]) suggests that the world was created recently together with records and traces indicating a greater age.
* The [[Simulated reality|simulated reality hypothesis]] or "[[The Matrix|Matrix hypothesis]]" suggest that everyone, or even the entire universe, might be inside a [[computer simulation]] or [[virtual reality]].

== History of Western skepticism ==

=== Ancient Greek skepticism ===
[[File:Pyrrho in Thomas Stanley History of Philosophy.jpg|thumb|[[Pyrrho]].]]
The [[Western philosophy|Western]] tradition of systematic [[skepticism]] goes back at least as far as [[Pyrrho]] of [[Elis]] (b. circa 360 BCE). However, "The 5th century [[sophists]] develop forms of debate which are ancestors of skeptical argumentation. They take pride in arguing in a persuasive fashion for both sides of an issue."&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism-ancient/ ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'': Ancient Skepticism.]&lt;/ref&gt; There were many disputes that could be found within the philosophical schools of his day, and according to a later account of his life by his student [[Timon of Phlius]], Pyrrho extolled a way to become happy and tranquil.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whoever wants to live well ([[eudaimonia]]) must consider these three questions: First, how are ''pragmata'' (ethical matters, affairs, topics) by nature? Secondly, what attitude should we adopt towards them? Thirdly, what will be the outcome for those who have this attitude?" Pyrrho's answer is that "As for ''pragmata''  they are all [[adiaphora]] (undifferentiated by a logical differentia), ''astathmÄta'' (unstable, unbalanced, not measurable), and ''anepikrita'' (unjudged, unfixed, undecidable). Therefore, neither our sense-perceptions nor our ''doxai'' (views, theories, beliefs) tell us the truth or lie; so we certainly should not rely on them. Rather, we should be ''adoxastous'' (without views), ''aklineis'' (uninclined toward this side or that), and ''akradantous'' (unwavering in our refusal to choose), saying about every single one that it no more is than it is not or it both is and is not or it neither is nor is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beckwith |first=Christopher I. |title=Greek Buddha: Pyrrho's Encounter with Early Buddhism in Central Asia |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=2015 |pages=22â23 |url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s10500.pdf |isbn=9781400866328}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The main principle of Pyrrho's thought is expressed by the word ''[[acatalepsia]]'', which connotes the ability to withhold assent from doctrines regarding the truth of [[Noumenon|things in their own nature]]; against every statement its contradiction may be advanced with equal justification.

[[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonists]] are not "skeptics" in the modern, common sense of the term, meaning prone to disbelief. They had the goal of ''Î±ÏÎ±ÏÎ±Î¾Î¹Î±'' (''[[ataraxia]]'' - peace of mind), and pitted one [[dogma]] against another to undermine belief in dogmatic propositions. The idea was to produce in the student a state of indifference towards ideas about non-evident matters. Since no one can observe or otherwise experience causation, external world (its "externality"), ultimate purpose of the universe or life, justice, divinity, soul, etc., they declared no need to believe in such things. The Pyrrhonists pointed out that, despite claims that such notions were necessary, some people ignorant of them get by just fine before learning about them. They further noted that science does not require belief and that faith in intelligible realities is different from pragmatic convention for the sake of experiment. For each intuitive notion (e.g. the existence of an external world), the Pyrrhonists cited a contrary opinion to negate it. They added that consensus indicates neither truth nor even probability.

Pyrrho's thinking subsequently influenced Plato's [[Academy]], creating the [[Academic skepticism]] of the ''New or Middle Academy'', [[Arcesilaus]] (c. 315 â 241 BCE) and [[Carneades]] (c. 213â129 BCE) argued from Stoic premises that the Stoics were actually committed to denying the possibility of knowledge, but seemed to maintain nothing themselves, but [[Clitomachus (philosopher)|Clitomachus]], a student of Carneades, interpreted his teacher's philosophy as suggesting an early [[probabilistic]] account of knowledge. The Roman politician and philosopher, [[Cicero]], also seems to have been a supporter of the probabilistic position attributed to the Middle Academy, even if the return to a more dogmatic orientation of that school was already beginning to take place.

[[Diogenes LaÃ«rtius]] lists ten modes of reasoning which Pyrrhonists thought justified their position:&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes LaÃ«rtius 9:80â88&lt;/ref&gt;
# Some things give animals pleasure which give other animals pain. What is useful to one animal is harmful to another.
# Each human has a different assortment of preferences, abilities and interests.
# Each sense gives a different impression of the same object.
# There is no reason to think one is sane while others are insaneâthe opposite could be true.
# Cultures disagree regarding beauty, truth, goodness, religion, life and justice.
# There is no consistency in perception. (His examples were that the color purple will show different tints depending on the lighting, a person looks different between noon and sunset, and a very heavy rock on land is lighter when in water)
# The senses can be shown to be deceptive. (From a distance, the square tower looks round and the sun looks small)
# Things that strengthen in moderation will weaken when taken in excess, like wine and food.
# When a thing is rare, it surprises people. When a thing is common, it does not surprise people.
# Inter-relations among things are of course relative, and by themselves are unknowable. (e.g. to know 'parent' you must know 'child,' and to know 'child' you must know 'parent.' Neither can be known by itself.)

In the centuries to come, the words ''Academician'' and ''Pyrrhonist'' would often be used to mean generally ''skeptic'', often ignoring historical changes and distinctions between denial of knowledge and avoidance of belief, between degree of belief and absolute belief, and between possibility and probability.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==== Sextus Empiricus ====
[[File:Sextus.jpg|thumb|Sextus Empiricus]]
[[Sextus Empiricus]] (c. 200 CE), the main authority for [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonian skepticism]], worked outside the Academy, which by his time had ceased to be a skeptical or probabilistic school, and argued in a different direction, incorporating aspects of [[empiricism]] into the basis for evaluating knowledge, but without the insistence on experience as the absolute standard of it. Sextus' empiricism was limited to the "absolute minimum" already mentioned â that there seem to be appearances. He developed this basic thought of Pyrrho's into lengthy [[argument]]s, most of them directed against Stoics and Epicureans, but also the Academic skeptics. The common anti-skeptical argument is that if one knows nothing, one cannot know that one knows nothing, and so may know something after all. It is worth noting that such an argument only succeeds against the complete denial of the possibility of knowledge. Considering dogmatic the claims both to know and not to know, Sextus and his followers claimed neither. Instead, despite the apparent conflict with the goal of [[ataraxia]], they claimed to continue searching for something that might be knowable.

Empiricus, as the most systematic author of the works by Hellenistic sceptics which have survived,  noted that there are at least ''ten modes'' of skepticism. These modes may be broken down into three categories: one may be skeptical of ''the subjective perceiver, of the objective world'', and ''the relation between perceiver and the world''.&lt;ref&gt;On the ten modes, see Sextus Empiricus. ''Outlines of Skepticism'' I.35â164.&lt;/ref&gt; His arguments are as follows.

''Subjectively'', both the powers of the senses and of reasoning may vary among different people. And since knowledge is a product of one or the other, and since neither are reliable, knowledge would seem to be in trouble. For instance, a [[Color blindness|color-blind]] person sees the world quite differently from everyone else. Moreover, one cannot even give preference on the basis of the power of reason, i.e., by treating the rational animal as a carrier of greater knowledge than the irrational animal, since the irrational animal is still adept at navigating their environment, which suggests the ability to "know" about some aspects of the environment.

Secondly, the personality of the individual might also influence what they observe, since (it is argued) preferences are based on sense-impressions, differences in preferences can be attributed to differences in the way that people are affected by the object. (Empiricus:56)

Third, the perceptions of each individual sense seemingly have nothing in common with the other senses: i.e., the color "red" has little to do with the feeling of touching a red object. This is manifest when our senses "disagree" with each other: for example, a mirage presents certain visible features, but is not responsive to any other kind of sense. In that case, our other senses defeat the impressions of sight. But one may also be lacking enough powers of sense to understand the world in its entirety: if one had an extra sense, then one might know of things in a way that the present five senses are unable to advise us of. Given that our senses can be shown to be unreliable by appealing to other senses, and so our senses may be incomplete (relative to some more perfect sense that one lacks), then it follows that all of our senses may be unreliable. (Empiricus:58)

Fourth, our circumstances when one perceives anything may be either natural or unnatural, i.e., one may be either in a state of wakefulness or sleep. But it is entirely possible that things in the world really are exactly as they appear to be to those in unnatural states (i.e., if everything were an elaborate dream). (Empiricus:59)

One can have reasons for doubt that are based on the ''relationship between objective "facts" and subjective experience''. The positions, distances, and places of objects would seem to affect how they are perceived by the person: for instance, the portico may appear tapered when viewed from one end, but symmetrical when viewed at the other; and these features are different. Because they are different features, to believe the object has both properties at the same time is to believe it has two contradictory properties. Since this is absurd, one must suspend judgment about what properties it possesses due to the contradictory experiences. (Empiricus:63)

One may also observe that the things one perceives are, in a sense, polluted by experience. Any given perceptionâsay, of a chairâwill always be perceived within some context or other (i.e., next to a table, on a mat, etc.) Since this is the case, one often only speaks of ideas as they occur in the context of the other things that are paired with it, and therefore, one can never know of the true nature of the thing, but only how it appears to us in context. (Empiricus: 64)

Along the same lines, the skeptic may insist that all things are relative, by arguing that:
# Absolute appearances either differ from relative appearances, or they do not.
# If absolutes do not differ from relatives, then they are themselves relative.
# But if absolutes do differ from relatives, then they are relative, because all things that differ must differ from something; and to "differ" from something is to be relative to something. (Empiricus:67)

Finally, one has reason to disbelieve that one knows anything by looking at problems in understanding objects by themselves. Things, when taken individually, may appear to be very different from when they are in mass quantities: for instance, the shavings of a goat's horn are white when taken alone, yet the horn intact is black.

==== Augustine and skepticism  ====
[[File:Augustine of Hippo Sandro Botticelli.jpg|thumb|235x235px|Augustine of Hippo]]
In 386 CE, [[Augustine]] published ''Contra Academicos'' (Against the Skeptics), which argued against claims that [[Academic skepticism|Academic Skeptics]] (266 BCE - 90 BCE) made:  
* Objection from Error: Through logic, Augustine proves that Skepticism does not lead to happiness like the academic skeptics claim. His proof is summarized below.
*# A wise man lives according to reason, and thus is able to be happy.
*# One who is searching for knowledge but never finds it is in error.
*# Imperfection objection: People in error are not happy, because being in error is an imperfection, and people cannot be happy with an imperfection.
*# Conclusion: One who is still seeking knowledge cannot be happy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/951625897|title=Augustine and academic skepticism : a philosophical study|last=1962-|first=Dutton, Blake D.,|isbn=9781501703553|location=Ithaca|oclc=951625897}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/90682|title=Classical and contemporary readings in the philosophy of religion|last=1922-2012,|first=Hick, John,|date=1970|publisher=Prentice-Hall|isbn=978-0131352698|edition= 2nd|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.,|oclc=90682}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Error of Non-Assent: Augustine's proof that suspending belief does not fully prevent one from error. His proof is summarized below.
*# Introduction of the error: Let P be true. If a person fails to believe P due to suspension of belief in order to avoid error, the person is also committing an error.
*# The Anecdote of the Two Travelers: Travelers A and B are trying to reach the same destination. At a fork in the road, a poor shepherd tells them to go left. Traveler A immediately believes him and reaches the correct destination. Traveler B suspends belief, instead believing in the advice of a well-dressed townsman to go right, because his advice seems more persuasive. However, the townsman is actually a ''samardocus'' (con man) so Traveler B never reaches the correct destination.
*# The Anecdote of the Adulterer: A man suspends belief that adultery is bad, and commits adultery with another man's wife because it is persuasive to him. Under Academic Skepticism, this man cannot be charged because he acted on what was persuasive to him without assenting belief.
*# Conclusion: Suspending belief exposes individuals to an error as defined by the Academic Skeptics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Skepticism's revival in the sixteenth century ===

==== Michel de Montaigne (1533â1592) ====
[[File:Michel de Montaigne.jpg|thumb|215x215px|Michel de Montaigne]]
The most notable figure of the Skepticism revival in the 1500s, [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] wrote about his studies of [[Academic Skepticism]] and [[Pyrrhonism]] through his [[Essays (Montaigne)|Essais]].

His most notable writings on Skepticism occurred in an essay written mostly in 1575â1576, "Apologie de Raimond Sebond," when he was reading [[Sextus Empiricus]] and trying to translate [[Raymond of Sabunde|Raimond Sebond]]'s writing, including his proof of [[Christianity]]'s natural existence. The reception to Montaigne's translations included some criticisms of Sebond's proof. Montaigne responded to some of them in ''Apologie,'' including a defense for Sebond's logic that is skeptical in nature and similar to Pyrrhonism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/923850410|title=French philosophy, 1572-1675|last=M.,|first=Clarke, Desmond|isbn=9780198749578|edition= First |location=Oxford, United Kingdom|oclc=923850410|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/700517388|title=Skepticism in the modern age : building on the work of Richard Popkin|date=2009|publisher=Brill|others=Maia Neto, JosÃ© Raimundo, 1959-, Paganini, Gianni, 1950-, Laursen, John Christian., Skepticism from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment: a Conference in Memory of Richard H.

# Critics claiming Sebond's arguments are weak show how egoistic humans believe that their logic is superior to others.
# Many animals can be observed to be superior to humans in certain respects. To argue this point, Montaigne even writes about dogs who are logical and creates their own syllogisms to understand the world around them. This was an example used in [[Sextus Empiricus]].
# Since animals also have rationality, the over-glorification of man's mental capabilities is a trapâman's folly. One man's reason cannot be assuredly better than another's as a result.
# Ignorance is even recommend by religion so that an individual can reach faith through obediently following divine instructions to learn, not by one's logic.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65192690|title=The history of scepticism : from Savonarola to Bayle|last=1923-|first=Popkin, Richard Henry,|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Popkin, Richard Henry, 1923-|isbn=9780195355390|edition= Rev. and expanded |location=Oxford|oclc=65192690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Marin Mersenne (1588â1648) ====
[[File:Marin Mersenne by Balthasar Moncornet.jpg|thumb|Marin Mersenne|214x214px]]
[[Marin Mersenne]] was an author, a mathematician, a scientist, and a philosopher. He wrote in defense of science and Christianity against atheists and [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonists]] before retiring to encourage development of science and the "new philosophy," which includes philosophers like [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]], [[RenÃ© Descartes|Descartes]], [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], and [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]. A major work of his in relation to Skepticism is ''La VeritÃ© des Sciences'', in which he argues that although we may not be able to know the true nature of things, we can still formulate certain laws and rules for sense-perceptions through science.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49394201|title=A companion to early modern philosophy|date=2002|publisher=Blackwell Pub|others=Nadler, Steven M., 1958-|isbn=978-0631218005|location=Malden, Mass.|oclc=49394201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, he points out that we do not doubt everything because:
* Humans do agree about some things, for example, an ant is smaller than an elephant
* There are natural laws governing our sense-perceptions, such as optics, which allow us to eliminate inaccuracies
* Man created tools such as rulers and scales to measure things and eliminate doubts such as bent oars, pigeonsâ necks, and round towers.
A Pyrrhonist might refute these points by saying that senses deceive, and thus knowledge turns into infinite regress or circular logic. Thus Mersenne argues that this cannot be the case, since commonly agreed upon rules of thumb can be hypothesized and tested over time to ensure that they continue to hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/24846343|title=Grotius to Gassendi|date=1992|publisher=Garland Pub|others=Chappell, V. C. (Vere Claiborne), 1930-|isbn=978-0815305767|location=New York|oclc=24846343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, if everything can be doubted, the doubt can also be doubted, so on and so forth. Thus, according to Mersenne, something has to be true. Finally, Mersenne writes about all the mathematical, physical, and other scientific knowledge that is true by repeated testing, and has practical use value. Notably, Mersenne was one of the few philosophers who accepted [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]' radical ideologyâhe saw it as a new science of man.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Skepticism in the seventeenth century ===
[[File:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|thumb|Thomas Hobbes|206x206px]]

==== Thomas Hobbes (1588â1679) ====
During his long stay in Paris, [[Thomas Hobbes]] was actively involved in the circle of major skeptics like [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]] and [[Marin Mersenne|Mersenne]] who focus on the study of skepticism and [[epistemology]]. Unlike his fellow skeptic friends, Hobbes never treated skepticism as a main topic for discussion in his works. Nonetheless, Hobbes was still labeled as a religious skeptic by his contemporaries for raising doubts about [[Mosaic authorship]] of the [[Pentateuch]] and his political and psychological explanation of the religions. Although Hobbes himself did not go further to challenge other religious principles, his suspicion for the Mosaic authorship did significant damage to the religious traditions and paved the way for later religious skeptics like [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and [[Isaac La PeyrÃ¨re]] to further question some of the fundamental beliefs of the Judeo-Christian religious system. Hobbes' answer to skepticism and epistemology was innovatively political: he believed that moral knowledge and religious knowledge were in their nature relative, and there was no absolute standard of truth governing them. As a result, it was out of political reasons that certain truth standards about religions and ethics were devised and established in order to form functioning government and stable society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Missner|first=Marshall|date=1983|title=Skepticism and Hobbes's Political Philosophy|jstor=2709174|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=44|issue=3|pages=407â427|doi=10.2307/2709174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Black|first=Sam|date=1997|title=Science and Moral Skepticism in Hobbes|jstor=40231980|journal=Canadian Journal of Philosophy|volume=27|issue=2|pages=173â207}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/904548214|title=Skepticism and political thought in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries|others=Laursen, John Christian,, Paganini, Gianni, 1950-|isbn=9781442649217|location=Toronto|oclc=904548214|last1=Laursen|first1=John Christian|last2=Paganini|first2=Gianni|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|Baruch Spinoza|224x224px]]

==== Baruch Spinoza and religious skepticism (1632â1677) ====
[[Baruch Spinoza]] was among the first European philosophers who were religious skeptics. He was quite familiar with the philosophy of [[Descartes]] and unprecedentedly extended the application of the Cartesian method to the religious context by analyzing religious texts with it. Spinoza sought to dispute the knowledge-claims of the Judeo-Christian-Islamic religious system by examining its two foundations: the [[Scripture]] and the [[Miracles of Jesus|Miracles]]. He claimed that all Cartesian knowledge, or the rational knowledge should be accessible to the entire population. Therefore, the Scriptures, aside from those by Jesus, should not be considered the secret knowledge attained from God but just the imagination of the prophets. The Scriptures, as a result of this claim, could not serve as a base for knowledge and were reduced to simple ancient historical texts. Moreover, Spinoza also rejected the possibility for the Miracles by simply asserting that people only considered them miraculous due to their lack of understanding of the nature. By rejecting the validity of the Scriptures and the Miracles, Spinoza demolished the foundation for religious knowledge-claim and established his understanding of the Cartesian knowledge as the sole authority of knowledge-claims. Despite being deeply-skeptical of the religions, Spinoza was in fact exceedingly anti-skeptical towards reason and rationality. He steadfastly confirmed the legitimacy of reason by associating it with the acknowledgement of God, and thereby skepticism with the rational approach to knowledge was not due to problems with the rational knowledge but from the fundamental lack of understanding of God. Spinoza's religious skepticism and anti-skepticism with reason thus helped him transform epistemology by separating the theological knowledge-claims and the rational knowledge-claims.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Batnitzky|first=Leora|date=December 2003|title=SPINOZA'S CRITIQUE OF RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY: SPINOZA'S CRITIQUE OF MIRACLES|url=|journal=Cardozo Law Review|volume=25|pages=57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pierre Bayle (1647â1706) ====
[[File:Pierre Bayle by Louis Ferdinand Elle.jpg|thumb|222x222px|Pierre Bayle by Louis Ferdinand Elle]]
[[Pierre Bayle]] was a French philosopher in the late 17th century that was described by Richard Popkin to be a "supersceptic" who carried out the sceptic tradition to the extreme. Bayle was born in a Calvinist family in [[Carla-Bayle]], and during the early stage of his life, he converted into Catholicism before returning to Calvinism. This conversion between religions caused him to leave France for the more religiously tolerant Holland where he stayed and worked for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Bayle believed that truth cannot be obtained through reason and that all human endeavor to acquire absolute knowledge would inevitably lead to failure. Bayle's main approach was highly skeptical and destructive: he sought to examine and analyze all existing theories in all fields of human knowledge in order to show the faults in their reasoning and thus the absurdity of the theories themselves. In his ''magnum opus, [[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]]'' ''(Historical and Critical Dictionary),'' Bayle painstakingly identified the logical flaws in several works throughout the history in order to emphasize the absolute futility of rationality. Bayle's complete nullification of reason led him to conclude that faith is the final and only way to truth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/960048885|title=The specter of skepticism in the age of Enlightenment|last=1985-|first=Matytsin, Anton M.,|isbn=9781421420523|location=Baltimore|oclc=960048885|date=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lennon|first=Thomas M.|date=2002|title=What Kind of a Skeptic Was Bayle?|url=|journal=Midwest Studies in Philosophy|volume=26-1|pages=258â279|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayle's real intention behind his extremely destructive works remained controversial. Some described him to be a [[Fideism|Fideist]], while others speculated him to be a secret [[Atheism|Atheist]]. However, no matter what his original intention was, Bayle did cast significant influence on the upcoming [[Age of Enlightenment]] with his destruction of some of the most essential theological ideas and his justification of religious tolerance Atheism in his works.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Kant's skepticism and its influence on German philosophy&lt;!--[[German skepticism]] and [[German skepticism]] redirect here---&gt;===
{{see also|Salomon Maimon}}
[[File:Immanuel Kant 3.jpg|thumb|Kant]]

[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724â1804) tried to provide a ground for empirical science against [[David Hume]]'s skeptical treatment of the notion of cause and effect.  Hume (1711â1776) argued that for the notion of cause and effect no analysis is possible which is also acceptable to the empiricist program primarily outlined by [[John Locke]] (1632â1704).&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' (1739), Book I, "Of the Understanding" and David Hume, ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1748).&lt;/ref&gt;  But, Kant's attempt to give a ground to knowledge in the empirical sciences at the same time cut off the possibility of knowledge of any other knowledge, especially what Kant called "metaphysical knowledge".  So, for Kant, empirical science was legitimate, but metaphysics and philosophy was mostly illegitimate. The most important exception to this demarcation of the legitimate from the illegitimate was ethics, the principles of which Kant argued can be known by pure reason without appeal to the principles required for empirical knowledge.  Thus, with respect to metaphysics and philosophy in general (ethics being the exception), Kant was a skeptic. This skepticism as well as the explicit skepticism of [[G. E. Schulze]]&lt;ref&gt;See [[G. E. Schulze]], ''[[Aenesidemus (book)|Aenesidemus]]'' (1792), excerpted in ''Between Kant and Hegel:  Texts in the Development of Post-Kantian Idealism'', Translated with Introductions by George di Giovanni and H. S. Harris, Indianapolis, Indiana:  Hackett Publishing, 2000.  See also [[Frederick C. Beiser]], ''The Fate of Reason:  German Philosophy from Kant to Fichte'', Cambridge, Massachusetts:  Harvard University Press, 1987; Chapter 9, "Schulze's Skepticism".&lt;/ref&gt; gave rise to a robust discussion of skepticism in classical German philosophy, especially by [[Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;See (1) H. S. Harris, "Skepticism, Dogmatism and Speculation in the Critical Journal" (1985), in ''Between Kant and Hegel:  Texts in the Development of Post-Kantian Idealism'', Translated with Introductions by George di Giovanni and H.

Hegel, "On the Relationship of Skepticism to Philosophy, Exposition of its Different Modifications and Comparison of the Latest Form with the Ancient One", Translated by H. S. Harris, in di Giovanni and Harris (2000) (cited just above); and (3) Michael N. Forster, ''Hegel and Skepticism'', Cambridge, Massachusetts:  Harvard University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kant's idea was that the real world (the ''[[noumenon]]'' or thing-in-itself) was inaccessible to human reason (though the empirical world of nature can be known to human understanding) and therefore we can never know anything about the ultimate reality of the world.  Hegel argued against Kant that although Kant was right that using what Hegel called "finite" concepts of "the understanding" precluded knowledge of reality, we were not constrained to use only "finite" concepts and could actually acquire knowledge of reality using "infinite concepts" that arise from self-consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, ''[[Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences|The Encyclopedia Logic]]'' (1830), Â§ 28, pp. 65â68, Translated by T. F. Garaets, W. A. Suchting, and H. S. Harris, Indianapolis, Indiana:  Hackett Publishing, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emerging discussion after the death of Richard Popkin ===
Because [[Richard Popkin]] was one of the founding fathers of study in this area, the account of the history of Skepticism in his books are accepted as the standard. However, recent scholars have been suggesting an addition to Popkin's account. Instead of centering the history of Skepticism around specific figures who wrote key skeptical works, Skepticism is proposed to be a continuous engagement with works by ancients like [[Sextus Empiricus]] to modern thinkers like [[David Hume|Hume]]. The engagement with previous works were probably due to unwanted doubts about accepted episteme instead of purely due to classical writings becoming available at any specific time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60715259|title=Sublimity and skepticism in Montaigne and Milton|last=1968-|first=Sedley, David Louis,|date=2005|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472115280|location=Ann Arbor|oclc=60715259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of skepticism in non-Western philosophy ==

=== Ancient Indian skepticism ===
&lt;!--"Maudgalyayana#Meeting the Buddha" links here.--&gt;
[[File:Medieval Jain temple Anekantavada doctrine artwork.jpg|thumb|Indian skepticism towards dogmatic statements is illustrated by the famous tale of the [[Blind men and an elephant]], common in Buddhism and Jainism.]]

====AjÃ±ana====
{{main|AjÃ±ana}}
AjÃ±ana (literally 'non-knowledge') were the skeptical school of ancient Indian philosophy. It was a [[Åramaá¹a]] movement and a major rival of early Buddhism and Jainism. They have been recorded in Buddhist and Jain texts. They held that it was impossible to obtain knowledge of metaphysical nature or ascertain the truth value of philosophical propositions; and even if knowledge was possible, it was useless and disadvantageous for final salvation.

====Buddhism====
The historical Buddha asserted certain doctrines as true, such as the possibility of [[nirvana]], however he also upheld a form of skepticism with regards to [[The unanswered questions|certain questions which he left "un-expounded"]] (''avyÄkata'') and some he saw as "incomprehensible" (''[[acinteyya]]''). Because the Buddha saw these questions (which tend to be of metaphysical topics) as unhelpful on the path and merely leading to confusion and "a thicket of views", he promoted [[suspension of judgment]] towards them. This allowed him to carve out an epistemic middle way between what he saw as the extremes of claiming absolute objectivity (associated with the claims to omniscience of the Jain [[Mahavira]]) and extreme skepticism (associated with the AjÃ±ana thinker [[Sanjaya Belatthiputta]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana, David J. A History of Buddhist Philosophy: Continuities and Discontinuities, page 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later [[Buddhist Philosophy]] remained highly skeptical of Indian metaphysical arguments. The Buddhist philosopher [[Nagarjuna]] in particular has been seen as the founder of the Madhyamaka school, which has been in turn compared with Greek Skepticism. Nagarjuna's statement that he has "no thesis" (''pratijÃ±a'') has parallels in the statements of [[Sextus Empiricus]] of having "no position".&lt;ref&gt;The Cowherds. Moonshadows: Conventional Truth in Buddhist Philosophy, Oxford University Press, 2011, pp. 115â116.&lt;/ref&gt; Nagarjuna famously opens his magnum opus, the ''Mulamadhyamakakarika'', with the statement that the Buddha claimed that true happiness was found through dispelling 'vain thinking' ([[prapaÃ±ca]], also "conceptual proliferation").&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Richard P. DignÄga on the interpretation of signs, page 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Richard P. Hayes, the Buddhist philosopher [[Dignaga]] is also a kind of skeptic, which is in line with most early [[Buddhist philosophy]]. Hayes writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...in both early Buddhism and in the Skeptics one can find the view put forward that man's pursuit of happiness, the highest good, is obstructed by his tenacity in holding ungrounded and unnecessary opinions about all manner of things. Much of Buddhist philosophy, I shall argue, can be seen as an attempt to break this habit of holding on to opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Richard P. DignÄga on the interpretation of signs, page 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scholars like Adrian Kuzminski have argued that [[Pyrrho of Elis]] (ca. 365â270) might have been influenced by Indian Buddhists during his journey with [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuzminski, Adrian. Pyrrhonism: How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism (Studies in Comparative Philosophy and Religion), 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

====CÄrvÄka philosophy====
The [[CÄrvÄka]] (Sanskrit: à¤à¤¾à¤°à¥à¤µà¤¾à¤) school of [[materialism]], also known as LokÄyata, is a distinct branch of Indian philosophy. The school is named after CÄrvÄka, author of the BÄrhaspatya-sÅ«tras and was founded in approximately 500 BC. CÄrvÄka is classified as a "heterodox" (nÄstika) system, characterized as a materialistic and atheistic school of thought. This school was also known for being strongly skeptical of the claims of [[Indian religions]], such as [[reincarnation]] and [[karma]].

====Jainism====
{{Main|Anekantavada|Syadvada}}
While Jain philosophy claims that is it possible to achieve [[omniscience]], absolute knowledge ([[Kevala Jnana]]), at the moment of enlightenment, their theory of [[anekÄntavÄda]] or 'many sided-ness', also known as the principle of relative [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]], allows for a practical form of skeptical thought regarding philosophical and religious doctrines (for un-enlightened beings, not all-knowing [[Arihant (Jainism)|arihants]]).

According to this theory, the truth or the reality is perceived differently from different points of view, and that no single point of view is the complete truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Dundas | first =Paul |author2=John Hinnels ed. | title =The Jains | publisher =Routledge | year =2002 | location =London | isbn =978-0-415-26606-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=koller/&gt; Jain doctrine states that, an object has infinite modes of existence and qualities and, as such, they cannot be completely perceived in all its aspects and manifestations, due to inherent limitations of the humans. AnekÄntavÄda is literally the doctrine of non-onesidedness or manifoldness; it is often translated as "non-absolutism". [[SyÄdvÄda]] is the theory of conditioned predication which provides an expression to anekÄnta by recommending that epithet âSyÄdâ be attached to every expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Chatterjea | first =Tara | title =Knowledge and Freedom in Indian Philosophy | publisher =Lexington Books | year =2001 | location =Lanham, MD | isbn =978-0739106921 }} pp. 77â87&lt;/ref&gt; SyÄdvÄda is not only an extension of AnekÄnta [[ontology]], but a separate system of logic capable of standing on its own force. As reality is complex, no single proposition can express the nature of reality fully. Thus the term âsyÄtâ should be prefixed before each proposition giving it a conditional point of view and thus removing any dogmatism in the statement.&lt;ref name=koller&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Koller  | first =John M.  | title =SyÄdvÄda as the epistemological key to the Jaina middle way metaphysics of AnekÄntavÄda  | journal =Philosophy East and West  | volume =   50  | issue =  3  | pages =400â7| jstor=1400182   |date=July 2000  | url =http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=59942245&amp;Fmt=4&amp;clientId=71080&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD  | issn =0031-8221  | accessdate =2007-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For Jains, fully enlightened beings are able to see reality from all sides and thus have ultimate knowledge of all things. This idea of omniscience was criticized by Buddhists such as [[Dharmakirti]].

=== Ancient Chinese philosophy ===
[[File:Zhuangzi-Butterfly-Dream.jpg|thumb|A Painting of Zhuangzi and his Butterfly Dream]]

==== Zhuang Zhou (c. 369 â c. 286 BC) ====
[[Zhuang Zhou]] (åºå­ï¼"Master Zhuang") was a famous ancient Chinese [[Taoism]] philosopher during the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] period. Zhuang Zhou demonstrated his skeptical thinking through several anecdotes in the preeminent work [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]] that was attributed to him:
* "The Debate on the Joy of Fish" (ç¥é±¼ä¹ä¹) : In this anecdote, Zhuang Zhou argued with his fellow philosopher [[Hui Shi]] on if they knew the fish in the pond was happy or not, and Zhuang Zhou said the famous sentence that "You are not I. How do you know that I do not know that the fish are happy?" &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/826640070|title=The Complete works of Zhuangzi|last=Zhuangzi.|others=Watson, Burton, 1925-2017.|isbn=9780231164740|location=New York|oclc=826640070|date=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ( Autumn Floods ç§æ°´ç¯, Zhuangzi)
* "The Butterfly of the Dream"(å¨å¬æ¢¦è¶) : The paradox of "Butterfly Dream" described Zhuang Zhou's confusion after dreaming himself to be a butterfly: "But he didn't know if he was Zhuang Zhou who had dreamt he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming that he was Zhuang Zhou." &lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; (Discussion on Making All Things Equal é½ç©ç¯, Zhuangzi)
Through these anecdotes in Zhuangzi, Zhuang Zhou indicated his belief in the limitation of language and human communication and the inaccessibility of universal truth which established himself as an skeptic. But Zhuang Zhou was by no means a radical skeptic, since he only applied skeptical methods partially in some of his arguments to demonstrate his Taoism beliefs while adopting these Taoism beliefs in a dogmatic fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berthel|first=Ken|date=2015-12-01|title=Language in Zhuangzi: A Theme that Reveals the Nature of its Relativism and Skepticism|journal=Journal of Chinese Philosophy|language=en|volume=42|pages=562â576|doi=10.1111/1540-6253.12215|issn=1540-6253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wang Chong (27 â {{circa|100|lk=no}} AD) ====
[[Wang Chong]] ({{lang|zh|çå}}) was the leading figure of the skeptic branch of the [[Confucianism]] school in China during the first century AD. He introduced a method of rational critique and applied it to the wide-spread dogmatism thinking of his age like [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] (the main contemporary Confucianism ideology that linked all natural phenomena with human ethics), state-led cults, and popular superstition. His own philosophy incorporated both [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]] thinkings, and it was based on a secular, rational practice of developing hypotheses based on natural events to explain the universe which exemplified a form of [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] that resembled the philosophical idea of [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] like [[Lucretius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xuerong|first=Ouyang|date=December 2003|title=ç¥è®ºçåçæçä¸»ä¹|url=|journal=Journal of Kaifeng University|volume=17-04|pages=11â13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/3345021|title=The shorter Science and civilisation in China : an abridgement of Joseph Needham's original text|last=1900-1995.|first=Needham, Joseph,|date=1978-&lt;1995&gt;|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Ronan, Colin A.|isbn=9780521235822|location=Cambridge|oclc=3345021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval Arabic philosophy ===
''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'', written by the scholar [[Al-Ghazali]] (1058â1111), marks a major turn in Islamic [[epistemology]]. His encounter with skepticism led Ghazali to embrace a form of theological [[occasionalism]], or the belief that all causal events and interactions are not the product of material conjunctions but rather the immediate and present will of God. While he himself was a critic of the philosophers, Ghazali was a master in the art of philosophy and had immensely studied the field. After such a long education in philosophy, as well as a long process of reflection, he had criticized the [[philosophical method]].

In the [[autobiography]] Ghazali wrote towards the end of his life, ''The Deliverance From Error'' (''Al-munqidh min al-á¸alÄl'' &lt;ref&gt;Annotated translations by Richard Joseph McCarthy (''Freedom and Fulfillment'', Boston: Twayne, 1980; ''Deliverance From Error'', Louisville, Ky.: Fons Vitae, 1999) and George F. McLean (''Deliverance from error and mystical union with the Almighty'', Washington, D.C.: Council for Research in Values and Philosophy, 2001).  An earlier translation by [[William Montgomery Watt]] was first published in 1953 (''The faith and practice of al-GhazÄlÄ«'', London: G. Allen and Unwin).&lt;/ref&gt;), Ghazali recounts how, once a crisis of [[epistemological skepticism]] was resolved by "a light which God Most High cast into my breast...the key to most knowledge,"&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy 1980, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; he studied and mastered the arguments of [[Kalam]], Islamic philosophy, and [[Ismailism]]. Though appreciating what was valid in the first two of these, at least, he determined that all three approaches were inadequate and found ultimate value only in the mystical experience and spiritual insight he attained as a result of following [[Sufi]] practices. [[William James]], in ''[[Varieties of Religious Experience]]'', considered the autobiography an important document for "the purely literary student who would like to become acquainted with the inwardness of religions other than the Christian", comparing it to recorded personal religious confessions and autobiographical literature in the Christian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;William James, ''Varieties of Religious Experience'', Harvard University Press, 1985, p. 319 [= 2002 Modern Library Paperback Edition, p. 438].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Physicist Pierre PrÃ©vost.jpg|thumbnail|right|Scientist Pierre PrÃ©vost in the ''Journal Officiel IllustrÃ© De L'Exposition Nationale'', Suisse GenÃ¨ve 1896]]
'''Pierre PrÃ©vost''' ({{IPA-fr|pÊevo|lang}}; 3 March 1751 â 8 April 1839) was a [[Republic and Canton of Geneva#History|Genevan]] [[philosopher]] and [[physicist]]. In 1791 he explained [[Marc-Auguste Pictet|Pictet's experiment]] by arguing that all bodies [[radiant heat|radiate heat]], no matter how hot or cold they are.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=PrÃ©vost|first=Pierre|date=April 1791|title=MÃ©moire sur l'Ã©quilibre du feu|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=7ZLOAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA314&amp;lpg=PA314&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|journal=Observations sur la physique|language=French|volume=XXXVIII|issue=1|pages=314--323|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Son of a [[Protestant]] [[clergyman]] in [[Geneva]] in the [[Republic and Canton of Geneva#History|Republic of Geneva]], he was born in that city and was educated for a clerical career. However, he abandoned it for law, and this too he quickly deserted to devote himself to education and to travelling. He became close friends with [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] and, a little later, with [[Dugald Stewart]], having previously distinguished himself as a translator of and commentator on [[Euripides]].

[[Frederick II of Prussia]] secured him in 1780 as professor of philosophy and made him member of the [[Akademie der Wissenschaften]] in Berlin. He there became acquainted with [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] and was thus led to turn his attention to [[physical science]].

After some years spent on [[political economy]] and on the principles of the [[fine art]]s (in connection with which he wrote, for the ''[[Berlin Memoirs]]'', a remarkable dissertation on poetry) he returned to Geneva and began his work on [[magnetism]] and on heat. Interrupted occasionally in his studies by political duties in which he was often called to the front, he remained professor of philosophy at Geneva until he was called in 1810 to the chair of physics. 

He died at Geneva in 1839.

==Work==
PrÃ©vost published much on [[philology]], philosophy, and political economy, but he will be remembered mainly for having published, with additions of his own, the ''TraitÃ© de physique'' by [[Georges-Louis Le Sage]], and for his enunciation of the law of exchange in [[radiation]].

His scientific publications included ''De l'Origine des forces magnetiques'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=De l'origine de forces magnÃ©tiques,|last=PrÃ©vost|first=Pierre|publisher=Chez Barde, Manget|year=1788|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''MÃ©moire sur l'Equilibre du feu'',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Recherches physico-mecaniques sur la chaleur'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=gOU4AAAAMAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Recherches physico-mÃ©caniques sur la chaleur|last=PrÃ©vost|first=Pierre|date=|publisher=Aux dÃ©pens de l'auteur.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39407">{{For|the practice of posting to raise the visibility of an Internet forum thread|Bump (Internet)}}

When a message is replied to in [[e-mail]], [[Internet forum]]s, or [[Usenet]], the original can often be included, or &amp;ldquo;quoted,&amp;rdquo; in a variety of different '''posting styles'''.

The main options are '''interleaved posting''' (also called '''inline replying''', in which the different parts of the reply follow the relevant parts of the original post), '''bottom-posting''' (in which the reply follows the quote) or '''top-posting''' (in which the reply precedes the quoted original message). For each of those options, there is also the issue of whether '''trimming''' of the original text is allowed, required, or preferred.

For a long time the traditional style was to post the answer below as much of the quoted original as was necessary to understand the reply (bottom or inline). Many years later, when email became widespread in business communication, it became a widespread practice to reply above the entire original and leave it (supposedly untouched) below the reply.

While each [[virtual community|online community]] differs on which styles are appropriate or acceptable, within some communities the use of the &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo; method risks being seen as a breach of [[netiquette]], and can provoke vehement response from community regulars.

==Quoting previous messages==
In an e-mail reply, it is sometimes appropriate to include a full or partial copy of the original message that is being replied to.  As opposed to in-person conversations and Internet [[online chat|chat]]s, email responses may be received long after the original message was sent, so the original sender may have forgotten, misplaced or deleted the original. Many email reading programs ([[mail user agent]]s) encourage this behaviour by automatically including a copy of the original message in the reply editing window.

Quoted text from previous messages is usually distinguished in some way from the new (reply) text. At a minimum, the two parts are given different [[Indentation (typesetting)|indentation]]. In the example below, the first line is the original message, the second line is the reply:

     All these words are terrible. They're hurtful and they make no sense. --Mary
 &lt;br&gt;
 Much like your posting.--Joe.

Alternatively, special delimiter lines may be used:

 Hey Joe, Paris is in France, not England. --Mary
 &lt;br&gt;
 --- original message ---
 You just had a call from England, from Paris I think. --Joe
 --- end of original message ---

For extra clarity, blank lines may also be inserted between the two parts. When using an email medium that supports text markup (such as HTML or RTF), the previous text may be indicated by a distinctive font and/or color:

     &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;The meeting has been postponed to next Friday. --Mary&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 Has the deadline for the report been moved too? --Joe

===Quoted line prefix===
[[Image:MsOutlook-EmailOptions.png|thumb|right|Alternative e-mail quoting styles supported by Microsoft Outlook]]
{{see also|Usenet quoting}}
A common convention in plain-text email is to prefix each line of the quoted text with a distinctive character or string.  Today (and for many years previously), the [[greater-than sign]] (&amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo;, the [[wikt:canon|canonical]] prefix)&lt;ref name="rfc3676#section-4.5"&gt;R. Gellens (February 2004), '''RFC 3676''' [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3676#section-4.5 ''The Text/Plain Format and DelSp Parameters'']&lt;/ref&gt; is almost universally used; but other characters such as the [[ASCII]] [[vertical bar]] character (&amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo;) have been used as well, sometimes with one or more spaces inserted before or after the quoted text marker.

There is no standard declaring one quote-prefix to be &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; and others to be &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo;, but some standards depend on conventional quoting. The (unpublished) [http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1849.html &amp;ldquo;son-of-1036&amp;rdquo;] draft recommends &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo; as the quote-prefix; [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3676.txt RFC 3676] depends on it and considers &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo; to be semantically different. That is, &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo; has a quote-depth of two, while &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo; has a quote-depth of one, quoting a line starting with &amp;ldquo;&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo;. Most e-mail clients treat both alternatives equivalently, however.

The convention of quoting was common in [[Usenet]] newsgroups by 1990, and is supported by many popular  [[User agent|email interfaces]], either by default or as a user-settable option. In [[Microsoft Outlook]], for instance, this option is labeled &amp;ldquo;prefix each line of the original.&amp;rdquo;  Besides inserting markers automatically in quoted lines, some interfaces assume that a line starting with a &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo; character or similar is quoted text, and will automatically display it in a distinctive font or color:

 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; How is the report coming? --Mary&lt;/span&gt;
 It will be on your desk by noon. --Joe

Sometimes the insertion of a quoted line marker will cause one original line to be folded as two lines in the reply, and the continuation line may not have the proper marker. To avoid ambiguity in such cases, one may consider inserting blank lines after each block of quoted text:

 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt;The board is asking again for the sales data. We really must provide&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; them with some figures. How is the report coming? --Mary&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 It will be on your desk by noon. --Joe

Quoted line markers are most commonly used in plain-text messages. In HTML messages, other devices may be used to indicate quoted text, such as [[HTML element|HTML indentation element]]s like &lt;code&gt;[[Blockquote element|blockquote]]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;dl&lt;/code&gt;.

===Reply level indication===
A message often includes text from two or more messages exchanged in previous rounds of a long discussion. If an additional quotation marker is inserted at every round, without removing any existing markers, the number of markers at the beginning of each line will show the &amp;ldquo;level&amp;rdquo; of the reply, that is, how many rounds have occurred since that line was written. These accumulated markers are usually sufficient to distinguish the parts that came from each message.  Some email interfaces recognize this convention and automatically render each level in a different color. For example:

 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How is the report coming? --Mary
 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;&gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; It will be on your desk by noon. --Joe
 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:magenta"&gt;&gt;
 &gt; Sorry Joe, I need it by 11:00 at the latest. --Mary&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 OK, but it will be missing this month's figures. --Joe

If the discussion is between two parties only, then an even number of markers (including zero) identifies text written by the sender, while an odd number of markers identifies text by the recipient. (In the above example even numbers are Joe's text and odd number are Mary's.)

 No problem. 6pm it is then. --Jim
 &lt;br&gt;
 At 10.01am Wednesday, Danny wrote:
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; Whoa! I need to email a report at 5:30.
 &gt; Could you push it back an hour? --Danny
 &gt;
 &gt; At 9.40am Wednesday, Jim wrote:
 &gt;
 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm going to suspend the mail service for approx. thirty
 &gt;&gt; minutes tonight, starting at 5pm. --Jim&lt;/span&gt;

In HTML messages, &lt;code&gt;[[Blockquote element|blockquote]]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;dl&lt;/code&gt; elements may be nested to achieve the same effect.

===Attribution lines===
Quoted material is often preceded by an ''attribution line'' that identifies its author.  These lines are particularly helpful in discussions between multiple parties. For example:

 Nancy wrote:
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; Peter wrote:&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;&gt;&gt; When will we have the performance figures?&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; The tests will be completed next week. &lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 Peter wrote:
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; Mary wrote:&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;&gt;&gt; We should meet today to discuss the marketing strategy.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; Better wait, we do not have the West Coast sales data yet.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 I agree with Peter.  We need the sales data and also Nancy's
 performance figures.  Let's meet next Friday after lunch.

This reply quotes two messages, one by Nancy (itself a reply to Peter) and one by Peter (itself a reply to Mary).

Many mail agents will add these attribution lines automatically to the top of the quoted material.  Note that a newly added attribution line should not get the quotation marker, since it is not part of the quoted text; so that the level indicator of the attribution line is always one less than the corresponding text. Doing otherwise may confuse the reader and also e-mail interfaces that choose the text color according to the number of leading markers.

Instead of an attribution line, one may indicate the author by a comment in brackets, at the beginning of the quotation:

 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;&gt;&gt; [Peter:] When will we have the performance figures?&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; [Nancy:] The tests will be completed next week. &lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;&gt;&gt; [Mary:] We should meet today to discuss the marketing strategy.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; [Peter:] Better wait, we do not have the West Coast sales data yet.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 I agree with Peter.  We need the sales data and Nancy's
 performance figures.  Let's meet next Friday after lunch.

Another alternative, used in [[Fidonet]] and some [[mail user agent]]s, is to place the initials of the author before the quoting marker. This may be used with or without attribution lines:

 Nancy wrote:
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;N&gt; Peter wrote:&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;P&gt;&gt; When will we have the performance figures?&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;N&gt; The tests will be completed next week. &lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 Peter wrote:
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;P&gt; Mary wrote:&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;M&gt;&gt; We should meet today to discuss the marketing strategy.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;P&gt; Better wait, we do not have the West Coast sales data yet.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 I agree with Peter.  We need the sales data and also Nancy's
 performance figures.  Let's meet next Friday after lunch.

==Trimming and reformatting==
When replying to long discussions, particularly in [[newsgroup]] discussions, quoted text from the original message is often trimmed so as to leave only the parts that are relevant to the reply â or only a reminder thereof.  This practice is sometimes called &amp;ldquo;trim-posting&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;edited posting&amp;rdquo;, and is recommended by some manuals of posting etiquette.&lt;ref name="rfc1855"&gt;S. Hambridge (October 1995), [[Network Working Group]] [[Request for Comments|RFC]] 1855 [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1855 ''Netiquette Guidelines'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes an indicator of deleted text is given, usually in the form of a square bracketed tag as: &amp;ldquo;[snipped],&amp;rdquo;  &amp;ldquo;[trimmed],&amp;rdquo; or simply &amp;ldquo;[...]&amp;rdquo;. The text that is retained may be edited to some extent, e.g. by re-folding the lines.  For example, if the original message was

  This is a reminder that the project meeting which was canceled
  last week will be held today in the 3rd floor conference room at
  14:30 sharp.  Everybody must attend. --Mary

the reply may be

&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
  &gt; the project meeting [...] will be held today in the 3rd floor
  &gt; conference room
  &lt;/span&gt;
  Mary, be sure to check the mics in that room. --Joe

or even just

&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
  &gt; 3rd floor conference room
  &lt;/span&gt;
  Mary, be sure to check the mics in that room. --Joe

Deleted text may also be replaced by a summary in brackets:

  On Thursday, Jim wrote:&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
  &gt; The movie clearly adds a sense of menace to the story
  &gt; which is not present in the original book.
  &gt; [...claim that the darker tone weakens the movie...]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  I disagree.  The darker tone works well, once one understands
  the two are aimed at different audiences.

Automatically included text (such as [[signature block]]s, free e-mail service ads, and corporate disclaimers) are more likely to be deleted, usually without ellipses, than manually written text.  Some posters may delete any parts of the original message that they are not replying to.  Some posters delete only parts dealing with issues that they see as  &amp;ldquo;closed,&amp;rdquo; and leave any parts that, in their opinion, deserve further discussion or will be replied to in a later message.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===How much to trim===
Some style guides recommend that, as a general rule, quoted material in replies should be trimmed or summarized as much as possible, keeping only the parts that are necessary to make the readers understand the replies.&lt;ref name="rfc1855"/&gt;  That of course depends on how much the readers can be assumed to know about the discussion.  For personal e-mail, in particular, the subject line is often sufficient, and no quoting is necessary; unless one is replying to only some points of a long message.&lt;ref name="rfc1855"/&gt;

In particular, when replying to a message that already included quoted text, one should consider whether that quoted material is still relevant.  For example:

&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;
 &gt;&gt; [Mary:] Shall we meet this afternoon to discuss the
 &gt;&gt; marketing strategy?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
 &gt;
 &gt; [Peter:] Perhaps, if we can get all the information we need.
 &gt; Do we have the West Coast sales data yet?&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 The LA office just sent them in.
 Joe

The quote from Mary's message is relevant to Peter's reply, but not to Joe's reply.  The latter could have been trimmed to

&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
 &gt; [Peter:] Do we have the West Coast sales data yet?&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 The LA office just sent them in.
 Joe

On the other hand, in some situations, any trimming or editing of the original message may be inappropriate. For example, if the reply is being copied to a third person who did not see the original message, it may be advisable to quote it in full; otherwise the trimmed message may be misinterpreted by the new recipient, for lack of context.

Also, when replying to a customer or supplier, it may be advisable to quote the original message in its entirety, in case the other party somehow failed to keep a copy of it.

==Placement of replies==

=== Interleaved style ===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Netiquette]] --&gt;

In the interleaved reply style (also called &amp;ldquo;inline reply,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;interlined reply,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;point-by-point rebuttal,&amp;rdquo; or, sometimes, &amp;ldquo;bottom posting&amp;rdquo;), the original message is broken into two or more sections, each followed by a specific reply or comment.  A reply in inline style may also include some [[#Top-posting|top-posted]] or [[#Bottom-posting|bottom-posted]] comments that apply to the whole reply message, rather than to a specific point.  For example:

 I have been following the discussion about the new product line. Here are my thoughts.
 &lt;br&gt;
 Joe wrote:
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
 &gt; Will our prices be competitive?&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 That may not be a problem for now, we still have a quality edge.
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
 &gt; We do not have enough trained people on the West Coast. We have many
 &gt; new employees but they do not know our products yet.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 We can bring them here for a crash training course.
 &lt;br&gt;
 Mary wrote:
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
 &gt; We still do not have a clear marketing plan. &lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 Peter, would you take charge of that? Let me know if you need help.
 &lt;br&gt;
 On the whole, I am quite optimistic.  It looks like we will be shipping
 the basic system before the end of this quarter.
 Nancy

The interleaved reply style can also be combined with top-posting: selected points are quoted and replied to, as above, and then a full copy of the original message is appended.

&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
 &gt; Can you present your report an hour later?&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 Yes I can. The summary will be sent no later than 5pm.
 Jim
 &lt;br&gt;
 At 10.01am Wednesday, Danny wrote:&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;
 &gt;&gt; 2.00pm: Present report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
 &gt; Jim, I have a meeting at that time. Can you present your report an hour later?
 &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;
 &gt;&gt; 4.30pm: Send out summary of feedback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
 &gt; Also if you do the above, this may need to happen later too.
 &gt; Danny
 &gt;
 &gt; At 9.40am Wednesday, Jim wrote:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;
 &gt;&gt; My schedule for today will be:
 &gt;&gt; 10.00am: Gather data for report
 &gt;&gt; 2.00pm: Present report to team

Interleaving was the predominant reply style in the [[Usenet]] discussion lists, years before the existence of the [[WWW]] and the spread of [[e-mail]] and the [[Internet]] outside the academic community.&lt;ref name="interleave standard"&gt;Archives of Usenet posts at [[Google Groups]] prior to the [[WWW|beginning of the WWW]] (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Interleaving was also common originally in e-mail, because many internet users had been exposed to Usenet newsgroups and other [[Internet forum]]s, where it is still used.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The style became less common for email after the opening of the internet to commercial and non-academic personal use.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} One possible reason is the large number of casual e-mail users that entered the scene at that time.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Another possible reason is the inadequate support provided by the reply function of some [[webmail]] readers, which either do not automatically insert a copy of the original message into the reply, or do so without any quoting prefix [[#Quoted line prefix|level indicators]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Finally, most forums, wiki discussion pages, and [[blog]]s (such as [[Slashdot]]) essentially impose the bottom-post format, by displaying all recent messages in chronological order.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. Interleaving continues to be used on technical mailing lists where clarity within complex threads is important.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}.

===Top-posting===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Netiquette]] --&gt;
In top-posting style, the original message is included verbatim, with the reply above it.  It is sometimes referred to by the term '''TOFU''', an acronym for &amp;ldquo;text over, fullquote under.&amp;rdquo;  It has also been colloquially referred to as ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' reply style.  The original message asks a question and the reply answers it, so the order in which these texts appear follows the format of that game show, where the answer (the clue) comes first and the response is a question.

Example:
 No problem.  6pm it is then.

Top-posting preserves an apparently unmodified transcript of a branch in the conversation.  Often all replies line up in a single branch of a conversation.  The top of the text shows the latest replies.  This appears to be advantageous for business correspondence, where an e-mail thread can dupe others into believing it is an &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; record.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

By contrast, excessive indentation of interleaved and bottom posting may turn difficult to interpret.  If the participants have different stature such as manager vs. employee or consultant vs. client, one person's cutting apart another person's words without the full context may look impolite or cause misunderstanding.

In the earlier days of [[Usenet]] informal discussions where everyone was an equal encouraged bottom-posting.  Until the mid-1990s, posts in a net.newcomers newsgroup insisted on interleaving replies.  Usenet [[Comp.* hierarchy|''comp.lang'' hierarchy]], especially comp.lang.c and comp.lang.c++ insisted on the same as of the 2010s.  The [[Alt.* hierarchy|''alt'' hierarchy]] tolerated top-posting.  Newer online participants, especially those with limited experience of Usenet, tend to be less sensitive to arguments about posting style.

Top-posting can be problematic on mailing lists with ongoing discussions which eventually require someone to act on the top-posted material. For example, top-posting &amp;ldquo;Those changes look ok to me, go ahead and make them&amp;rdquo; can be very inconvenient for the person who needs to make the changes if he or she has to read through a long email trail to know which changes the top-poster is referring to. Inter-leaving the text directly below the text describing the changes is much more convenient in these cases.

Users of [[handheld device|mobile devices]], like [[smartphone]]s, are encouraged to use top-posting because the devices may only download the beginning of a message for viewing.  The rest of the message is only retrieved when needed, which takes additional download time.  Putting the relevant content at the beginning of the message requires less bandwidth, less time, and less scrolling for the user.&lt;ref&gt;[http://danwarne.com/my-rapidly-growing-email-habit/ My rapidly growing email habit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070119091029/http://danwarne.com/my-rapidly-growing-email-habit/ |date=January 19, 2007 }} blog post&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/postfix/2001-07/1670.html  Stopping SirCam] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928035410/http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/postfix/2001-07/1670.html |date=September 28, 2007 }} â postfix.org mailing list&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/jdev/2006-June/083465.html Top Posting and Mobiles] â [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|Jabber]] mailing list&lt;/ref&gt;

Top-posting is a natural consequence of the behavior of the &amp;ldquo;reply&amp;rdquo; function in many current e-mail readers, such as [[Microsoft Outlook]], [[Gmail]], and others.  By default, these programs insert into the reply message a copy of the original message (without headers and often without any extra indentation or quotation markers), and position the editing [[cursor (computers)|cursor]] above it.  Moreover, a bug present on most flavours of Microsoft Outlook caused the quotation markers to be lost when replying in plain text to a message that was originally sent in HTML/RTF.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  
For these and possibly other reasons, many users seem to accept top-posting as the &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; reply style.

Partially because of Microsoft's influence, top-posting is very common on [[Electronic mailing list|mailing list]]s and in personal e-mail.&lt;ref name="Intelligently"&gt;{{Cite web

Top-posting has always been the standard format for forwarding a message to a third party, in which case the comments at the top (if any) are a "cover note" for the recipient.

===Bottom-posting===
In the "bottom-posting" style, the reply is appended to a full or partial copy of the original message. The name bottom-posting is sometimes used for inline-style replies, and indeed the two formats are the same when only one point is being replied to.

{{anchor|Bottom-posting-example}}

 &gt; At 9.40am Wednesday, Jim wrote:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;

 &lt;/span&gt;
 No problems. 6pm it is then.
 &lt;br&gt;
 Basically, I will update our WWW server and firewall.
 No, you won't have to reboot.

Bottom-posting, like inline replies, encourages posters to trim the original message as much as possible, so that readers are not forced to scroll past irrelevant text, or text that they have already seen in the original message:

 &gt; [...] Will I have to reboot?
 &lt;/span&gt;
 No problems. 6pm it is then.

===Choosing the proper posting style===
The choice between interleaved, top or bottom posting generally depends on the forum and on the nature of the message. Some forums (such as personal e-mail) are quite tolerant, in which case the proper style is dictated by taste and effectiveness.  In any case one should consider whether the reply will be easily read by the intended recipient(s).  Their e-mail interfaces may have different rules for handling quoted line markers and long lines, so a reply that looks readable in one's screen may be jumbled and incorrectly colored on theirs.  Blank lines and judicious trimming of the original text may help avoid ambiguity.

The interleaved reply style can require more work in terms of labeling lines, but possibly less work in establishing the context of each reply line. It also keeps the quotes and their replies close to each other and in logical reading order, and encourages trimming of the quoted material to the bare minimum. This style makes it easier for readers to identify the points of the original message that are being replied to; in particular, whether the reply misunderstood or ignored some point of the original text.   It also gives the sender freedom to arrange the quoted parts in any order, and to provide a single comment to quotations from two or more separate messages, even if these did not include each other.

Top- and bottom-posting are sometimes compared to traditional [[letter (message)|written correspondence]] in that the response is a single continuous text, and the whole original is appended only to clarify which letter is being replied to. [[Customer service]] e-mail practices, in particular, often require that all points be addressed in a clear manner without quoting, while the original e-mail message may be included as an attachment.  Including the whole original message may be necessary also when a new correspondent is included in an ongoing discussion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mailformat.dan.info/quoting/top-posting.html Quoting: Top Posting] â Dan's Mail Format Site&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200509/sensible_email/ Sensible email] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017180623/http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200509/sensible_email/ |date=October 17, 2006 }} â Blog post and discussion&lt;/ref&gt;  Especially in business correspondence, an entire message thread may need to be forwarded to a third party for handling or discussion. On the other hand, in environments where the entire discussion is accessible to new readers (such as [[newsgroup]]s or [[online forum]]s), full inclusion of previous messages is inappropriate; if quoting is necessary, the interleaved style is probably best.

If the original message is to be quoted in full, for any reason, bottom-posting is usually the most appropriate format â because it preserves the logical order of the replies and is consistent with the Western reading direction from top to bottom.

It is not uncommon during discussions concerning top-posting vs. bottom-posting to hear quotes from "Netiquette Guidelines (RFC 1855)". While many RFCs are vetted and approved though a committee process, some RFCs, such as RFC 1844, are just "Informational" and in reality, sometimes just personal opinions. (Additional information on "Informational" RFCs can be found in RFC 2026, under "4.2.2  Informational" and "4.2.3  Procedures for Experimental and Informational RFCs".) The nature of RFC 1855 should be considered while reading the following discussion.

According to RFC 1855, a message can begin with an abbreviated summary; i.e. a post can begin with a paraphrasing instead of quoting selectively.  Specifically, it says:

  If you are sending a reply to a message or a posting be sure you
  summarize the original at the top of the message, or include just
  enough text of the original to give a context.  This will make
  sure readers understand when they start to read your response.
  Since NetNews, especially, is proliferated by distributing the
  postings from one host to another, it is possible to see a
  response to a message before seeing the original.  Giving context
  helps everyone.  But do not include the entire original!

Interleaved reply combined with top-posting combines the advantages of both styles. However this also results in some portions of the original message being quoted twice, which takes up extra space and may confuse the reader.

In forwarding it is sometimes preferred to include the entire original message (including all headers) as a [[MIME]] attachment, while in top-posted replies these are often trimmed or replaced by an [[#Attribution lines|attribution line]]. An untrimmed quoted message is a weaker form of transcript, as key pieces of [[metadata|meta information]] are destroyed.  (This is why an [[Internet service provider|ISP]]'s [[Postmaster (computing)|Postmaster]] will typically insist on a ''forwarded'' copy of any problematic e-mail, rather than a quote.)  These forwarded messages are displayed in the same way as top-posting in some mail clients.
Top-posting is viewed as seriously destructive to [[Electronic mailing list|mailing-list]] digests, where multiple levels of top-posting are difficult to skip.  The worst case would be top-posting while including an entire digest as the original message.

Some believe that "top-posting" is appropriate for interpersonal e-mail, but inline posting should always be applied to threaded discussions such as newsgroups.

This example is occasionally used in mailing lists to mock and discourage top-posting:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/mailinglists/etiquette.php|title=ARM Linux - Mailing Lists - Etiquette|work=linux.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idallen.com/topposting.html|title=Top Posting and Bottom Posting|work=idallen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://what-is-what.com/what_is/top_posting.html|title=What is Top Posting?|work=what-is-what.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 A: Because it messes up the order in which people normally read text.
 Q: Why is top-posting such a bad thing?
 A: Top-posting.
 Q: What is the most annoying thing in e-mail?

Bottom-posting preserves the logical order of the replies and is consistent with the Western reading direction from top to bottom.

The major argument against bottom-posting is that scrolling down through a post to find a reply is inconvenient, especially for short replies to long messages, and many inexperienced computer users may not know that they need to scroll down to find a reply to their query. When sending an untrimmed bottom-posted message, one might indicate inline replies with a notice at the top such as "I have replied below." However, as many modern mail programs are capable of displaying different levels of quotation with different colors (as seen in the [[#Bottom-posting-example|bottom-posting example]] on this page), this is not so much of an issue any more. Another method to indicate that there is more reply text still to come is to always end your text with a signature line. Then a reader who is familiar with your reply style will know to continue to read until your signature line appears. This method is particularly polite and useful when using the inline reply method, since it tells the reader that your response is complete at the point where your signature line appears.

===Quoting support in popular mail clients===

This widespread policy in business communication made bottom and inline posting so unknown among most users that some of the most popular email programs no longer support the traditional posting style. For example, Microsoft Outlook, AOL, and Yahoo! make it difficult or impossible to indicate which part of a message is the quoted original or do not let users insert comments between parts of the original.

Yahoo! does not have the option "Quote the text of the original message" in Mail Classic, but this setting is retained after turning it on in All-New Mail and then switching back to Mail Classic. Inline replying is broken in Microsoft Outlook, which despite choosing the setting to prefix each line of the original with the "greater-than" character (&gt;) produces a blue line that makes answers inserted between quotes of an HTML email look like part of the original. The workarounds are to use the setting "read all standard mail in plain text", or to use the "Edit Message" option on the original email and convert it to plain text before replying (then discard the edited version).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.loftninjas.org/2008/08/14/making-outlook-2007-quote-responsibly/|title=Making Outlook 2007 quote responsibly|work=loftninjas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''religious experience''' (sometimes known as a [[spirituality|spiritual]] experience, [[sacred]] experience, or [[mysticism|mystical]] experience) is a [[subjectivity|subjective experience]] which is interpreted within a religious framework.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80}} The concept originated in the 19th century, as a defense against the growing rationalism of [[Western world|Western society]].{{sfn|Sharf|2000}} [[William James]] popularised the concept.{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}

Many religious and mystical traditions see religious experiences (particularly that knowledge which comes with them) as [[revelation]]s caused by divine agency rather than ordinary natural processes. They are considered real encounters with [[God]] or gods, or real contact with higher-order realities of which humans are not ordinarily aware.&lt;ref&gt;The Argument from Religious Experience http://www.philosophyofreligion.info/?page_id=41&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptics may hold that religious experience is an evolved feature of the human brain amenable to normal scientific study.{{refn|group=note|Such study may be said to have begun with the American psychologist and philosopher [[William James]] in his 1901/02 [[Gifford Lectures]] later published as ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]''.}} The commonalities and differences between religious experiences across different cultures have enabled scholars to categorize them for academic study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Batson, C. D., Schoenrade, P., &amp; Ventis, W. L.|title=Religion and the individual: A social psychological perspective.|year=1993 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

===William James===
[[Psychologist]] and [[philosopher]] [[William James]] described four characteristics of mystical experience in ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]].'' According to James, such an experience is:
* '''Transient'''&amp;nbsp;â the experience is temporary; the individual soon returns to a "normal" frame of mind. Feels outside normal perception of space and time.
* '''[[Ineffability|Ineffable]]'''&amp;nbsp;â the experience cannot be adequately put into words.
* '''[[Nous|Noetic]]'''&amp;nbsp;â the individual feels that he or she has learned something valuable from the experience. Feels to have gained knowledge that is normally hidden from human understanding.
* '''Passive'''&amp;nbsp;â the experience happens to the individual, largely without conscious control.  Although there are activities, such as meditation (see below), that can make religious experience more likely, it is not something that can be turned on and off at will.

===Norman Habel===
[[Norman Habel]] defines religious experiences as the structured way in which a believer enters into a relationship with, or gains an awareness of, the sacred within the context of a particular religious tradition (Habel, O'Donoghue and Maddox: 1993). Religious experiences are by their very nature [[preternatural]]; that is, out of the ordinary or beyond the natural order of things. They may be difficult to distinguish observationally from psychopathological states such as [[psychoses]] or other forms of altered awareness (Charlesworth: 1988). Not all preternatural experiences are considered to be religious experiences. Following Habel's definition, psychopathological states or drug-induced states of awareness are not considered to be religious experiences because they are mostly not performed within the context of a particular religious tradition.

Moore and Habel identify two classes of religious experiences: the immediate and the mediated religious experience (Moore and Habel: 1982).
* '''Mediated'''&amp;nbsp;â In the mediated experience, the believer experiences the sacred through mediators such as [[ritual]]s, special persons, religious groups, totemic objects or the natural world (Habel et al.: 1993).
* '''Immediate'''&amp;nbsp;â The [[immediate experience]] comes to the believer without any intervening agency or mediator. The deity or divine is experienced directly.

===Richard Swinburne===
In his book ''Faith and Reason'', the philosopher [[Richard Swinburne]] formulated five categories into which all religious experiences fall:
* '''Public'''&amp;nbsp;â a believer 'sees God's hand at work', whereas other explanations are possible e.g. looking at a beautiful sunset
* '''Public'''&amp;nbsp;â an unusual event that breaches natural law e.g. walking on water
* '''Private'''&amp;nbsp;â describable using normal language e.g. Jacob's vision of a ladder
* '''Private'''&amp;nbsp;â indescribable using normal language, usually a mystical experience e.g. "white did not cease to be white, nor black cease to be black, but black became white and white became black."
* '''Private'''&amp;nbsp;â a non-specific, general feeling of God working in one's life.
Swinburne also suggested two principles for the assessment of religious experiences:
* '''Principle of Credulity'''&amp;nbsp;â with the absence of any reason to disbelieve it, one should accept what appears to be true e.g. if one sees someone walking on water, one should believe that it is occurring.
* '''Principle of Testimony'''&amp;nbsp;â with the absence of any reason to disbelieve them, one should accept that eyewitnesses or believers are telling the truth when they testify about religious experiences.

===Rudolf Otto===
The German thinker [[Rudolf Otto]] (1869â1937) argues that there is one common factor to all religious experience, independent of the cultural background. In his book ''The Idea of the Holy'' (1923) he identifies this factor as the [[numinous]]. The "numinous" experience has two aspects:
* ''mysterium tremendum'', which is the tendency to invoke fear and trembling;
* ''mysterium fascinans'', the tendency to attract, fascinate and compel.

The numinous experience also has a personal quality to it, in that the person feels to be in communion with a holy other. Otto sees the numinous as the only possible religious experience. He states: "There is no religion in which it [the numinous] does not live as the real innermost core and without it no religion would be worthy of the name" (Otto: 1972).  Otto does not take any other kind of religious experience such as ecstasy and enthusiasm seriously and is of the opinion that they belong to the 'vestibule of religion'.

==Related terms==
*'''[[Religious ecstasy|Ecstasy]]'''&amp;nbsp;â In ecstasy the believer is understood to have a [[soul]] or [[spirit]] which can leave the body. In ecstasy the focus is on the soul leaving the body and to experience transcendental realities. This type of religious experience is characteristic for the [[shaman]].
*'''[[Enthusiasm]]'''&amp;nbsp;â In enthusiasm&amp;nbsp;â or [[Spirit possession|possession]]&amp;nbsp;â God is understood to be outside, other than or beyond the believer. A sacred power, being or will enters the body or mind of an individual and possesses it. A person capable of being possessed is sometimes called a medium. The [[deity]], spirit or power uses such a person to communicate to the [[Immanence|immanent]] world. Lewis argues that ecstasy and possession are basically one and the same experience, ecstasy being merely one form which possession may take. The outward manifestation of the phenomenon is the same in that shamans appear to be possessed by spirits, act as their mediums, and even though they claim to have mastery over them, can lose that mastery (Lewis: 1986).
*'''[[Mystical experience]]'''&amp;nbsp;â Mystical experiences are in many ways the opposite of numinous experiences. In the mystical experience, all 'otherness' disappear and the believer becomes one with the transcendent. The believer discovers that he or she is not distinct from the cosmos, the deity or the other reality, but one with it. Zaehner has identified two distinctively different mystical experiences: natural and religious mystical experiences (Charlesworth: 1988). Natural mystical experiences are, for example, experiences of the 'deeper self' or experiences of oneness with nature. Zaehner argues that the experiences typical of 'natural mysticism' are quite different from the experiences typical of religious mysticism (Charlesworth: 1988). Natural mystical experiences are not considered to be religious experiences because they are not linked to a particular tradition, but natural mystical experiences are spiritual experiences that can have a profound effect on the individual.
*'''[[Enlightenment (spiritual)|Spiritual awakening]]'''&amp;nbsp;â A spiritual awakening usually involves a realization or opening to a sacred dimension of reality and may or may not be a ''religious'' experience. Often a spiritual awakening has lasting effects upon one's life. The term "spiritual awakening" may be used to refer to any of a wide range of experiences including being [[Born again Christianity|born again]], [[near-death experiences]], and [[mysticism|mystical experiences]] such as [[Moksha|liberation]] and [[Bodhi|enlightenment]].

==History==

===Origins===
The notion of "religious experience" can be traced back to [[William James]], who used the term "religious experience" in his book, ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]''.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}} It is considered to be the classic work in the field, and references to James' ideas are common at professional conferences. James distinguished between [[institutional religion]] and [[Spirituality|personal religion]]. Institutional religion refers to the religious group or organization, and plays an important part in a society's culture. Personal religion, in which the individual has [[mystical experience]], can be experienced regardless of the culture.

The origins of the use of this term can be dated further back.{{sfn|Sharf|2000}} In the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, several historical figures put forth very influential views that religion and its beliefs can be grounded in experience itself. While [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] held that [[Moral obligation|moral experience]] justified [[religious belief]]s, [[John Wesley]] in addition to stressing individual moral exertion thought that the religious experiences in the [[Methodist movement]] (paralleling the [[Romantic Movement]]) were foundational to religious commitment as a way of life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Issues in Science and Religion]], [[Ian Barbour]], [[Prentice-Hall]], 1966, page 68, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wayne Proudfoot]] traces the roots of the notion of "religious experience" to the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768â1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of "religious experience" was used by Schleiermacher and [[Albrecht Ritschl|Albert Ritschl]] to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique, and defend the view that human (moral and religious) experience justifies [[religious belief]]s.{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}

The notion of "religious experience" was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p=271}}{{refn|group=note|James also gives descriptions of conversion experiences. The Christian model of dramatic conversions, based on the role-model of Paul's conversion, may also have served as a model for Western interpretations and expectations regarding "enlightenment", similar to Protestant influences on Theravada Buddhism, as described by Carrithers: "It rests upon the notion of the primacy of religious experiences, preferably spectacular ones, as the origin and legitimation of religious action. But this presupposition has a natural home, not in Buddhism, but in Christian and especially Protestant Christian movements which prescribe a radical conversion."{{sfn|Carrithers|1983|p=18}} See Sekida for an example of this influence of William James and Christian conversion stories, mentioning Luther{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=196-197}} and St. Paul.{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=251}} See also McMahan for the influence of Christian thought on Buddhism.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}}}

A broad range of western and eastern movements have incorporated and influenced the emergence of the modern notion of "mystical experience", such as the [[Perennial philosophy]], [[Transcendentalism]], [[Universalism]], the [[Theosophical Society]], [[New Thought]], [[Neo-Vedanta]] and [[Buddhist modernism]].{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{sfn|King|2001}}

====Perennial philosophy====
{{Main|Perennial philosophy}}

According to the Perennial philosophy, the mystical experiences in all religions are essentially the same. It supposes that many, if not all of the world's great religions, have arisen around the teachings of mystics, including [[Buddha]], [[Jesus]], [[Lao Tze]], and [[Krishna]]. It also sees most religious traditions describing fundamental mystical experience, at least esoterically. A major proponent in the 20th century was [[Aldous Huxley]], who "was heavily influenced in his description by Vivekananda's [[neo-Vedanta]] and the idiosyncratic version of Zen exported to the west by [[D.T. Suzuki]]. Both of these thinkers expounded their versions of the perennialist thesis",{{sfn|King|2002|p=163}} which they originally received from western thinkers and theologians.{{sfn|King|2002}}

====Transcendentalism and Unitarian Universalism====
{{Main|Transcendentalism|Universalism}}

[[Transcendentalism]] was an early 19th-century [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Protestant]] movement, which was rooted in English and German [[Romanticism]], the Biblical criticism of [[Herder]] and [[Schleiermacher]], and the [[skepticism]] of [[David Hume|Hume]].&lt;ref group=web name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/transcendentalism/ |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''Transcendentalism'' |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Transcendentalists emphasised an intuitive, experiential approach of religion.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jone Johnson Lewis |url=http://www.transcendentalists.com/what.htm |title=Jone John Lewis, ''What is Transcendentalism? |publisher=Transcendentalists.com |accessdate=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Schleiermacher,{{sfn|Sharf|1995}} an individual's intuition of truth was taken as the criterion for truth.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis" /&gt; In the late 18th and early 19th century, the first translations of Hindu texts appeared, which were also read by the Transcendentalists, and influenced their thinking.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis" /&gt; They also endorsed [[Universalism|universalist]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarianist]] ideas, leading to [[Unitarian Universalism]], the idea that there must be truth in other religions as well, since a loving God would redeem all living beings, not just Christians.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis" /&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.uua.org/re/other/andrews.html |title=Barry Andrews, ''The Roots Of Unitarian Universalist Spirituality In New England Transcendentalism '' |publisher=Archive.uua.org |date=1999-03-12 |accessdate=2013-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054734/http://archive.uua.org/re/other/andrews.html |archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Thought====
{{Main|New Thought}}

New Thought promotes the ideas that ''Infinite Intelligence'', or God, is everywhere, spirit is the totality of real things, true human selfhood is divine, divine thought is a force for good, sickness originates in the mind, and "right thinking" has a healing effect.&lt;ref group=web name="newthoughtalliance.org"&gt;[http://www.newthoughtalliance.org/about.htm Declaration of Principles] (accessed 2008â09)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="newthought.info"&gt;[http://newthought.info/beliefs/nt_beliefs.htm New Thought info, ''Statement of beliefs''] (accessed 2008â09)&lt;/ref&gt; New Thought was propelled along by a number of spiritual thinkers and philosophers and emerged through a variety of religious denominations and churches, particularly the [[Unity Church]], [[Religious Science]], and [[Church of Divine Science]].{{sfn|Lewis|Melton|1992|p=16â18}} The [[Home of Truth]], which belongs to the New Thought movement has, from its inception as the Pacific Coast Metaphysical Bureau in the 1880s, disseminated the teachings of the [[Hindu]] teacher [[Swami Vivekananda]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehomeoftruth.org/id4.html |title=tHe HOme of Truth, ''Our History'' |publisher=Thehomeoftruth.org |accessdate=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Theosophical Society====
{{main|Theosophical Society}}
{{See also|Vipassana movement|Hindu reform movements|Buddhist modernism}}

The Theosophical Society was formed in 1875 by [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[Henry Steel Olcott]], [[William Quan Judge]] and others to advance the spiritual principles and search for Truth known as [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]].&lt;ref name="Melton"&gt;[[J. Gordon Melton|Melton, Gordon J.]] (Sr. ed.) (1990). "Theosophical Society". ''New Age Encyclopedia''. [[Farmington Hills, Michigan]]: [[Gale (publisher)|Gale Research]]. pp. 458â461. {{ISBN|0-8103-7159-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note| 
# To form a nucleus of the universal brotherhood of humanity without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste, or colour.
# To encourage the study of comparative religion, philosophy, and science.
# To investigate the unexplained laws of nature and the powers latent in man.}} The Theosophical Society has been highly influential in promoting interest, both in west and east, in a great variety of religious teachings:
{{quote|"No single organization or movement has contributed so many components to the [[New Age Movement]] as the Theosophical Society [...] It has been the major force in the dissemination of [[occult]] literature in the [[Western world|West]] in the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Melton" /&gt;}}

The Theosophical Society searched for 'secret teachings' in Asian religions. It has been influential on modernist streams in several Asian religions, notably [[Hindu reform movements]], the revival of [[Theravada Buddhism]], and [[D.T. Suzuki]], who popularized the idea of enlightenment as insight into a timeless, transcendent reality.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/CriticalZen/whose%20zen_sharf.pdf |first=Robert H. |last=Sharf |title=Whose Zen?

====Orientalism and the "pizza effect"====
{{Main|Pizza effect|Neo-Vedanta|Buddhist modernism}}

The interplay between western and eastern notions of religion is an important factor in the development of modern mysticism. In the 19th century, when Asian countries were colonialised by western states, a process of cultural mimesis began.{{sfn|King|2002}}{{sfn|McMahan|2010}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}} In this process, Western ideas about religion, especially the notion of "religious experience" were introduced to Asian countries by missionaries, scholars and the Theosophical Society, and amalgamated in a new understanding of the Indian and Buddhist traditions. This amalgam was exported back to the West as 'authentic Asian traditions', and acquired a great popularity in the west. Due to this western popularity, it also gained authority back in India, Sri Lanka and Japan.{{sfn|King|2002}}{{sfn|McMahan|2010}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}

The best-known representatives of this amalgamated tradition are [[Annie Besant]] (Theosophical Society), [[Vivekananda|Swami Vivekenanda]] and [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]] ([[Neo-Vedanta]]), [[Anagarika Dharmapala]], a 19th-century Sri Lankan Buddhist activist who founded the [[Maha Bodhi Society]], and [[D.T. Suzuki]], a Japanese scholar and [[Zen|Zen-Buddhist]]. A synonymous term for this broad understanding is [[nondualism]]. This mutual influence is also known as the [[pizza effect]].

===Criticism===
The notion of "experience" has been criticised.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a}}{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282-286}}{{sfn|Low|2006|p=12}}

"Religious empiricism" is seen as highly problematic and was&amp;nbsp;â during the period in-between world wars&amp;nbsp;â famously rejected by [[Karl Barth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Issues in Science and Religion]], [[Ian Barbour]], [[Prentice-Hall]], 1966, page 114, 116-119&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, religious as well as moral experience as justification for religious beliefs still holds sway. Some influential modern scholars holding this [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theological]] view are [[Charles E. Raven|Charles Raven]] and the Oxford physicist/theologian [[Charles Coulson]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Issues in Science and Religion]], [[Ian Barbour]], [[Prentice-Hall]], 1966, p. 126-127&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Sharf points out that "experience" is a typical Western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a}}{{refn|group=note|Robert Sharf: "[T]he role of experience in the history of Buddhism has been greatly exaggerated in contemporary scholarship. Both historical and ethnographic evidence suggests that the privileging of experience may well be traced to certain twentieth-century reform movements, notably those that urge a return to ''[[zazen]]'' or ''[[vipassana]]'' meditation, and these reforms were profoundly influenced by religious developments in the west [...] While some adepts may indeed experience "altered states" in the course of their training, critical analysis shows that such states do not constitute the reference point for the elaborate Buddhist discourse pertaining to the "path".{{sfn|Sharf|1995b|p=1}}}} The notion of "experience" introduces a false notion of duality between "experiencer" and "experienced", whereas the essence of kensho is the realisation of the "non-duality" of observer and observed.{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=30}}{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=82}} "Pure experience" does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282}}{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80-82}} The specific teachings and practices of a specific tradition may even determine what "experience" someone has, which means that this "experience" is not the ''proof'' of the teaching, but a ''result'' of the teaching.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80}} A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by "cleansing the doors of perception",{{refn|group=note|[[William Blake]]: "If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thru' narrow chinks of his cavern."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quotedb.com/quotes/2653 Quote DB]&lt;/ref&gt;}} would be an overwhelming chaos of sensory input without coherence.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=284}}

[[Neoplatonism]] is the modern term for a school of religious and mystical [[philosophy]] that took shape in the 3rd century AD, founded by [[Plotinus]] and based on the teachings of [[Plato]] and earlier [[Platonism|Platonists]].

Neoplatonism teaches that along the same road by which it descended the soul must retrace its steps back to the supreme Good. It must first of all return to itself. This is accomplished by the practice of [[virtue]], which aims at likeness to God, and leads up to God. By means of [[ascetic]] observances the human becomes once more a spiritual and enduring being, free from all sin. But there is still a higher attainment; it is not enough to be sinless, one must become "God", (''[[henosis]]''). This is reached through contemplation of the primeval Being, the One&amp;nbsp;â in other words, through an ecstatic approach to it.

It is only in a state of perfect passivity and repose that the soul can recognize and touch the primeval Being.  Hence the soul must first pass through a spiritual curriculum. Beginning with the contemplation of corporeal things in their multiplicity and harmony, it then retires upon itself and withdraws into the depths of its own being, rising thence to the ''nous'', the world of ideas. But even there it does not find the Highest, the One; it still hears a voice saying, "not we have made ourselves." The last stage is reached when, in the highest tension and concentration, beholding in silence and utter forgetfulness of all things, it is able as it were to lose itself. Then it may see God, the foundation of life, the source of being, the origin of all good, the root of the soul. In that moment it enjoys the highest indescribable bliss; it is as it were swallowed up of divinity, bathed in the light of eternity. Porphyry tells us that on four occasions during the six years of their intercourse Plotinus attained to this ecstatic union with God.

====Alcoholics Anonymous Twelfth Step====
The twelfth step of the Alcoholics Anonymous program states that "Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aa.org.au/members/twelve-steps.php&lt;/ref&gt;   The terms âspiritual experienceâ and âspiritual awaken-ingâ are used many times in "The Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aa.org/pages/en_US/alcoholics-anonymous | title=Alcoholics Anonymous : Alcoholics Anonymous}}&lt;/ref&gt; which argues that a spiritual experience is needed to bring about recovery from alcoholism.&lt;ref name="aa.org"&gt;http://www.aa.org/assets/en_US/en_bigbook_appendiceii.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity====

=====Christian mysticism=====
{{Main|Christian mysticism}}
[[File:Wesley stained glass 9216.JPG|left|thumb|Three early Methodist leaders, [[Charles Wesley]], [[John Wesley]], and [[Francis Asbury]], portrayed in stained glass at the Memorial Chapel, [[Lake Junaluska, North Carolina]]]]
Christian doctrine generally maintains that God dwells in all Christians and that they can experience God directly through belief in Jesus,&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=KjvJohn.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=7&amp;division=div1 John 7:16â39]&lt;/ref&gt; Christian mysticism aspires to apprehend spiritual truths inaccessible through intellectual means, typically by emulation of Christ. [[William Ralph Inge|William Inge]] divides this ''scala perfectionis'' into three stages: the "''purgative''" or [[ascetic]] stage, the "''illuminative''" or contemplative stage, and the third, "''unitive''" stage, in which God may be beheld "face to face."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14596/14596-8.txt ''Christian Mysticism'' (1899 Bampton Lectures)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The third stage, usually called contemplation in the Western tradition, refers to the experience of oneself as united with God in some way. The experience of union varies, but it is first and foremost always associated with a reuniting with Divine ''love.'' The underlying theme here is that God, the perfect goodness,&lt;ref&gt;[[Theologia Germanica]], public domain&lt;/ref&gt; is known or experienced at least as much by the heart as by the intellect since, in the words of [[1 John]] 4:16: "God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God and God in him."  Some approaches to classical mysticism would consider the first two phases as preparatory to the third, explicitly mystical experience; but others state that these three phases overlap and intertwine.

=====Hesychasm=====
Based on Christ's injunction in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] to "go into your closet to pray",&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Matthew|6:5â6|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hesychasm]] in tradition has been the process of retiring inward by ceasing to register the senses, in order to achieve an experiential knowledge of God (see [[theoria]]).

The highest goal of the hesychast is the experiential knowledge of God. In the 14th Century, the possibility of this experiential knowledge of God was challenged by a [[Calabria]]n monk, [[Barlaam of Seminara|Barlaam]], who, although he was formally a member of the Orthodox Church, had been trained in Western Scholastic theology. Barlaam asserted that our knowledge of God can only be propositional. The practice of the hesychasts was defended by [[Gregory Palamas|St. Gregory Palamas]].

===Islam===
While all Muslims believe that they are on the pathway to God and will become close to God in Paradise&amp;nbsp;â after death and after the "Final Judgment"&amp;nbsp;â [[Sufism|Sufis]] believe that it is possible to become close to God and to experience this closeness while one is alive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uga.edu/islam/sufismintro.html Sufism, Sufis, and Sufi Orders: Sufism's Many Paths&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Sufis believe in a tripartite way to God as explained by a tradition attributed to the Prophet,"The [[Shariah]] are my words (aqwal), the [[tariqa]] are my actions (amal), and the [[haqiqa]] is my interior states (ahwal)". Shariah, tariqa and haqiqa are mutually interdependent.

The tariqa, the âpathâ on which the mystics walk, has been defined as âthe path which comes out of the Shariah, for the main road is called shar, the path, tariq.â No mystical experience can be realized if the binding injunctions of the Shariah are not followed faithfully first. The path, tariqa, however, is narrower and more difficult to walk. It leads the adept, called salik (wayfarer), in his suluk (wandering), through different stations (maqam) until he reaches his goal, the perfect tauhid, the existential confession that God is One.&lt;ref&gt;Annemarie Schimmel, Mystical Dimensions of Islam (1975) pg.99&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddhism====
[[File:Museum fÃ¼r Indische Kunst Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 013.jpg|thumb|The Buddha demonstrating control over fire and water. [[Gandhara]], 3rd century CE]]

In Theravada [[Buddhism]] practice is described in the threefold training of discipline (''[[ÅÄ«la]]''), meditative concentration (''[[samÄdhi]]''), and transcendent wisdom (''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajÃ±Ä]]''). Zen-Buddhism emphaises the sole practice of meditation, while [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism utilizes a wide variety of practices. While the main aim of meditation and ''prajna'' is to let go of attachments, it may also result in a comprehension of the [[Buddha-nature]] and the inherent lucidness of the mind.

Different varieties of religious experience are described in detail in the ''[[ÅÅ«raá¹gama SÅ«tra]]''. In its section on the fifty [[skandha]]-[[mara (demon)|maras]], each of the five skandhas has ten skandha-maras associated with it, and each skandha-mara is described in detail as a deviation from correct samÄdhi. These skandha-maras are also known as the "fifty skandha demons" in some English-language publications.&lt;ref name="epstein50"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.sfsu.edu/repstein/Buddhism/Shurangama/ss8foreword.html|title=Fifty Skandha Demon States: Forward|author=Ron Epstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also believed that supernormal abilities are developed from meditation, which are termed "higher knowledge" (''[[abhijÃ±Ä]]''), or "spiritual power" (''[[á¹ddhi]]''). One early description found in the ''[[Samyutta Nikaya]]'', which mentions abilities such as:&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi. ''The Connected Discourses of the Buddha.'' 2000. p. 1727&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|... he goes unhindered through a wall, through a rampart, through a mountain as though through space; he dives in and out of the earth as though it were water; he walks on water without sinking as though it were earth; seated cross-legged, he travels in space like a bird; with his hands he touches and strokes the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; he exercises mastery with the body as far as the brahmÄ world.}}

====Hinduism====
Building on European philosophers, Radhakrishnan reduced religion "to the core experience of reality in its fundamental unity".
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Contemporary Hinduism: Ritual, Culture, and Practice|first=Robin |last=Rinehart|page=195|publisher=ABC-CLIO}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]], "Hinduism is not just a [[faith (religion)|faith]]. It is the union of reason and [[Intuition (knowledge)#Intuition and spirituality|intuition]] that cannot be defined, but is only to be experienced."&lt;ref&gt;''Bhagavad Gita'', [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]]&lt;/ref&gt; This emphasis on experience as validation of a religious worldview is a modern development, which started in the 19th century, and was introduced to Indian thought by western [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] missionaries.{{sfn|King|2001}} It has been popularized in [[Neo-Vedanta]], which has dominated the popular understanding of Hinduism since the 19th century.{{sfn|King|1999}}{{refn|group=note|Also called neo-Hinduism{{sfn|King|1999}}}} It emphasizes mysticism.{{sfn|King|1999}}{{sfn|King|1999|p=171}}{{sfn|Muesse|2011|p=3-4}}{{sfn|Doniger|2010|p=18}} [[Swami Vivekanada]] presented the teachings of Neo-Vedanta as radical nondualism, unity between all religions and all persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reincarnation in America: An Esoteric History|page=218|first=Lee|last=Irwin|year=2017|publisher=Lexington Books|quote=Neo-Vedanta teachings as an expression of a radical nondualism, an inherent unity within all religions and within all persons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bringing the Sacred Down to Earth: Adventures in Comparative Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0pPY6p9cpQC&amp;pg=PA115|first=Corinne|last=Dempsey|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780199860326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Meher Baba====
According to the [[syncretistic]] Indian spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]], "Spiritual experience involves more than can be grasped by mere intellect. This is often emphasised by calling it a mystical experience. Mysticism is often regarded as something anti-intellectual, obscure and confused, or impractical and unconnected with experience. In fact, true mysticism is none of these. There is nothing irrational in true mysticism when it is, as it should be, a vision of Reality. It is a form of perception which is absolutely unclouded, and so practical that it can be lived every moment of life and expressed in every-day duties. Its connection with experience is so deep that, in one sense, it is the final understanding of all experience."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]]: [http://www.discoursesbymeherbaba ''Discourses''], Sufism Reoriented, 1967, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

The neuroscience of religion takes neural correlates as the basis of cognitive functions and religious experiences. These religious experience are thereby [[Emergence|emergent properties]] of neural correlates. This approach does not necessitate exclusion of the Self, but interprets the Self as influenced or otherwise acted upon by underlying neural mechanisms. Proponents argue that religious experience can be evoked through [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] of specific brain regions and/or can be observed through measuring increase in activity of specific brain regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Azari|first=N.

According to the neurotheologist [[Andrew B. Newberg]], neurological processes which are driven by the repetitive, rhythmic stimulation which is typical of human ritual, and which contribute to the delivery of transcendental feelings of connection to a universal unity.{{clarify|incomplete sentence|date=June 2012}} They posit, however, that physical stimulation alone is not sufficient to generate transcendental unitive experiences. For this to occur they say there must be a blending of the rhythmic stimulation with ideas. Once this occurs "...ritual turns a meaningful idea into a visceral experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Andrew B.

==Integrating religious experience==

Several psychologists have proposed models in which religious experiences are part of a process of transformation of the self.

[[Carl Jung]]'s work on himself and his patients convinced him that life has a spiritual purpose beyond material goals. One's main task, he believed, is to discover and fulfil deep innate potential, much as the acorn contains the potential to become the oak, or the caterpillar to become the butterfly. Based on his study of [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Taoism]], and other traditions, Jung perceived that this journey of transformation is at the mystical heart of all religions. It is a journey to meet the self and at the same time to meet the Divine. Unlike Sigmund Freud, Jung thought spiritual experience was essential to well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crowley |first=Vivianne |title=Jung: A Journey of Transformation:Exploring His Life and Experiencing His Ideas|year=2000 |publisher=Quest Books |location=Wheaton Illinois |isbn=978-0-8356-0782-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of the [[numinous]] was an important concept in the writings of Carl Jung. Jung regarded numinous experiences as fundamental to an understanding of the individuation process because of their association with experiences of [[synchronicity]] in which the presence of archetypes is felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jung, C. G.|title=C. G. Jung speaking: Interviews and encounters(W. McGuire &amp; R. F. C. Hull Eds.)|year=1980 |publisher=London: Pan Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Main, R. |title=The rupture of time: Synchronicity and Jung's critique of modern western culture|year=2004|publisher=Hove and New York: Brunner-Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McNamara proposes that religious experiences may help in "decentering" the self, and transform it into an integral self which is closer to an ideal self.{{sfn|McNamara|2014}}

[[Transpersonal psychology]] is a school of [[psychology]] that studies the [[transpersonal]], self-[[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]] aspects of the human experience. The ''Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'' describes transpersonal psychology as "the study of humanityâs highest potential, and with the recognition, understanding, and realization of unitive, spiritual, and transcendent states of consciousness" (Lajoie and Shapiro, 1992:91). Issues considered in transpersonal psychology include spiritual [[Human Potential Movement|self-development]], [[peak experience]]s, [[mysticism|mystical experiences]], [[trance|systemic trance]] and  other [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] experiences of living.

'''StanisÅaw Brzozowski''' (28 June 1878 â 30 April 1911) was a Polish [[philosopher]], [[writer]], [[publicist]], literary and theatre critic. Historically considered to be one of the most important [[Philosophy of Poland|Polish philosophers]], Brzozowski is known for his concept of the ''philosophy of labour'', rooted in [[Marxism]]. Besides [[Karl Marx]], among his major inspirations were [[Georges Sorel]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], and [[John Henry Newman]]. Brzozowski's core idea was based on the concept of a socially engaged intellectual (artist). Although he was in favour of [[historical materialism]], he strongly argued against its [[determinism|deterministic]] interpretation. In his philosophical approaches, Brzozowski rejected all concepts that were commodifying a human being.

Polish intellectuals ([[CzesÅaw MiÅosz]],&lt;ref&gt;MiÅosz Cz., "A controversial Polish writer: StanisÅaw Brzozowski", in California Slavic Studies, vol. 2, Berkeley, University of California Press, 1963:53â95&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrzej Walicki]],&lt;ref&gt;Walicki A., StanisÅaw Brzozowski and the Polish beginnings of &gt;Western Marxism&lt;", Oxford University Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leszek KoÅakowski]]&lt;ref&gt;KoÅakowski L., Main Currents of Marxism, vol. 2, Oxford University Press, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;) have stressed that Brzozowski's interpretations of Marx's early writings, not widely known at the time of their formulation, largely anticipated those presented later by [[GyÃ¶rgy LukÃ¡cs]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]].

== Biography ==

Leopold StanisÅaw Leon Brzozowski was born in 1878 in [[Maziarnia, CheÅm County|Maziarnia]], a village near [[CheÅm]]. He grew up in an impoverished [[szlachta|gentry]] family, but attended private schools, which allowed him to enroll in the Faculty of Natural Sciences of the [[University of Warsaw]] in 1896. In 1897 Brzozowski was involved in student riots against [[Russian Empire|Russian]] professors teaching at the university. As a consequence, Brzozowski and many other students were expelled from the university for a period of one year. Brzozowski then led the student organization ''Bratniak'', established to maintain financial support for the expelled students. In order to help his father, who suffered from a fatal illness, Brzozowski decided to use the organization's funds. Although he had promised himself to give the money back as soon as possible, his [[embezzlement]] was discovered. The arbitration panel of the fellow members excluded Brzozowski from the activities of the organization for three years. In the same year (1898), he was imprisoned as a result of investigations into the secret activities of the Society for People's Education.&lt;ref&gt;Mackiewicz W., Brzozowski, Wiedza Powszechna, Warszawa, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the autumn of 1898, Brzozowski suffered heavily from [[tuberculosis]], a consequence of the time spent in prison. In order to recuperate, he went to a sanatorium in [[Otwock]]. In 1900 he met there Antonina Kolberg and they married the next year. In 1903 Brzozowski's only child, Anna Irena, was born. The health problems continued, and in order to receive more intensive medical care, in 1905 he traveled to Italy. In 1906 he went to Italy again and resided in [[Florence]] until his death there in 1911. The last few years of Brzozowski's life, although spent in gradually worsening health and material conditions, were the most productive. During that time he wrote his ''opus magnum'' â the novel ''PÅomienie'' (The Flames) â a response to ''[[Demons (Dostoyevsky novel)|Demons]]'' by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], as well as important books concerning Brzozowski's philosophical and cultural program: ''Idee. WstÄp do filozofii dojrzaÅoÅci dziejowej'' (Ideas: An introduction to the philosophy of historical maturity) and ''Legenda MÅodej Polski'' (The legend of Young Poland).

== Intellectual profile  ==

Brzozowski was an influential critic of Polish social and philosophical thought, an analyst of literature, and a piercing observer of Polish and European everyday life. He was an unambiguous critic of the traditionalism and provincialism of the main currents of 19th century [[Polish literature]]. In particular, Brzozowski was a strong opponent of historical novels, such as those written by the [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]] winner [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]. Brzozowski's radical attacks on Sienkiewicz's works made him a ''persona non grata'' in Polish artistic circles.

Brzozowski held a unique position as an astute critic of Polish contemporary culture, known as [[Young Poland]] (Polish [[modernism]]) or [[neo-romanticism]]. His ''Legenda MÅodej Polski'' represents the most comprehensive denunciation of those forms of the Polish mind, which, in Brzozowski's words, represent "the delusion of cultural consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;http://danassays.wordpress.com/encyclopedia-of-the-essay/brzozowski-stanislaw/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connection of Marxism and religion ==

Concerning his philosophical heritage, Brzozowski tended to experience rather radical shifts in his world-view as a result of subsequent readings. His first important philosophical inspiration was [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and his notion of ''historical sense,'' which Brzozowski found particularly valuable. After focusing on Nietzsche, Brzozowski moved closer towards [[Immanuel Kant]], which eventually enabled him to develop his philosophy on the [[Marxism|Marxist]] basis. Besides providing many vital inspirations, Marxism played a central role in Brzozowski's intellectual development, and for the longest period of his short life he was a Marxist thinker. His interpretation of [[Karl Marx]]'s thought was anti-[[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]] and anti-[[positivism|positivist]]. Brzozowski was an ardent critic of [[Friedrich Engels]] and his role in developing Marxist thought. He accused Engels of 'vulgar determinism' and leading Marxism towards naive and reductionist perspective of 'economic necessity'.&lt;ref&gt;Brzozowski S., "Idee. WstÄp do filozofii dojrzaÅoÅci dziejowej", KrakÃ³w 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, he developed his own philosophical program called the ''philosophy of labour'' that emphasized the role of human activity in creating and re-creating the reality. This was a concept rejecting [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]] and [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] of human acts and, according to Brzozowski, was the natural expansion of key Marxist ideas.

In his philosophy Brzozowski focused on subjective factors of work: on the quality of human will and on cohesion and strength of the live social bond determining this quality. He thought that the examination of work from the perspective of experience acquired in the process of its performance, or its "internal" analysis, made it possible to prove that the ultimate basis of work and its products arising in human awareness as the "objectively" given world, was subjective physical effort, maintained by the strength of human will. This effort, in its appropriate level and progress, depends on other forms of labor, creating proper organization and culture of societies; work, its quality, its amount, is a subtle creation of will, maintained by entire cultures, which in turn is a very subtle and complicated creation.

Brzozowski reaches the conclusion that an essential condition of the discipline of will is a strong, traditional moral bond. This results in recognizing religion as a valuable school of will and a precious element of intense social bond. The essence of work is therefore the inner life of a human being, spirituality, âwillingness to workâ, although it is strongly rooted in customs, in culture. This emphasis on roots indicates that community is of crucial importance for the continuity of work.

== Contemporary significance in Poland ==

StanisÅaw Brzozowski has an established position as one of the most important intellectuals in modern Polish history. His cultural and philosophical activity has been regularly debated throughout the last century in Poland. He became the point of reference for subsequent generations of Polish intellectuals. Although identified mainly with the [[Left-wing politics|political left]], the subtlety and open-endedness of his thought allowed some groups from the [[Right-wing politics|right]] to identify themselves with Brzozowski's ideas as well.

Since 2002, Brzozowski has been the patron of ''[[Krytyka Polityczna]]'' (Political Critique), a Polish left-wing intellectual society organized around a journal of the same title founded by [[SÅawomir Sierakowski]] in 2002. In 2005, the [[StanisÅaw Brzozowski Association]] was established and became the publisher of the journal and the on-line publication ''Dziennik Opinii'' (Opinion Daily). The association's core idea resembles that of its patron: that intellectuals are public figures who ought to live a socially involved and committed life.

The '''water fuel cell''' is a technical design of a "[[perpetual motion]] machine" created by American Stanley Allen Meyer (August 24, 1940 â March 20, 1998). Meyer claimed that an automobile retrofitted with the device could use water as fuel instead of gasoline. Meyer's claims about his "Water Fuel Cell" and the car that it powered were found to be fraudulent by an Ohio court in 1996.&lt;ref name="Narciso"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news

== Description ==
The water fuel cell purportedly split [[water]] into its component elements, [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. The hydrogen gas was then burned to generate energy, a process that reconstituted the water molecules. According to Meyer, the device required less energy to perform [[electrolysis]] than the minimum energy requirement predicted or measured by conventional science.&lt;ref name="Narciso"/&gt; The mechanism of action was alleged to involve "[[Oxyhydrogen#Fringe science and fraud|Brown's gas]]", a mixture of [[oxyhydrogen]] with a ratio of 2:1, the same composition as liquid water; which would then be mixed with ambient air (nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, chloroflourocarbons, free radicals/electrons, radiation, among others).&lt;ref name = "Nature"/&gt; If the device worked as specified, it would violate both the [[first law of thermodynamics|first]] and [[second law of thermodynamics|second]] laws of thermodynamics,&lt;ref name="Narciso"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Nature"/&gt; allowing operation as a perpetual motion machine.&lt;ref name = "Nature"/&gt;

== The term "fuel cell" ==
[[Image:Water fuel cell circuit.png|thumb|right|The circuit&lt;ref name="US5149407"&gt;{{US patent|5149407}}: Process and apparatus for the production of fuel gas and the enhanced release of thermal energy from such gas&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Throughout his patents&lt;ref name="US5149407"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US4936961"&gt;{{US patent|4936961}}: Method for the production of a fuel gas&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|4826581}}: Controlled process for the production of thermal energy from gases and apparatus useful therefore; {{US patent|4798661}}: Gas generator voltage control circuit; {{US patent|4613779}}: Electrical pulse generator; {{US patent|4613304}}: Gas electrical hydrogen generator;{{US patent|4465455}}: Start-up/shut-down for a hydrogen gas burner; {{US patent|4421474}}: Hydrogen gas burner; {{US patent|4389981}}: Hydrogen gas injector system for internal combustion engine&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer used the terms "fuel cell" or "water fuel cell" to refer to the portion of his device in which electricity is passed through water to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Meyer's use of the term in this sense is contrary to its usual meaning in science and engineering, in which such cells are conventionally called "[[electrolytic cell]]s".&lt;ref name = "Definition"&gt;''[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]'' ([[Columbia University Press]], 2004) defines "fuel cell" as an "Electric cell in which the chemical energy from the oxidation of a gas fuel is converted directly to electrical energy in a continuous process"; and electrolysis as "Passage of an electric current through a conducting solution or molten salt that is decomposed in the process."&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the term "[[fuel cell]]" is usually reserved for cells that produce electricity from a chemical [[redox reaction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Introduction: Batteries and Fuel Cells |author1=Whittingham, M.

Rev.; 2004; 104(10), entire issue]&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Meyer's fuel cell consumed electricity, as shown in his patents and in the circuit pictured on the right.
Meyer describes in a 1990 patent the use of a "water fuel cell assembly" and portrays some images of his "fuel cell water capacitor". According to the patent, in this case "...&amp;nbsp;the term 'fuel cell' refers to a single unit of the invention comprising a water capacitor cell&amp;nbsp;... that produces the fuel gas in accordance with the method of the invention."&lt;ref name="US4936961"/&gt;

== Media coverage ==
[[Image:Water fuel cell capacitor.png|thumb|right|The water fuel cell&lt;ref name="US4936961"/&gt;]]
In a news report on an [[WSYX|Ohio TV station]], Meyer demonstrated a [[dune buggy]] he claimed was powered by his water fuel cell. He estimated that only 22&amp;nbsp;US&amp;nbsp;gallons (83&amp;nbsp;liters) of water were required to travel from Los Angeles to New York.&lt;ref name="Action 6"&gt;Robinson, Ralph (Reporter), Tom Ryan (News caster) and Gail Hogan (News caster) "Unknown Episode &lt;nowiki&gt;[Videorecording (Broadcast)]&lt;/nowiki&gt;" Action 6 News.

Befreetech.Com. Accessed 23 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Meyer claimed to have replaced the [[spark plug]]s with "injectors" that introduced a hydrogen/oxygen mixture into the engine cylinders. The water was subjected to an [[electrical resonance]] that dissociated it into its basic atomic make-up. The water fuel cell would split the water into hydrogen and oxygen gas, which would then be combusted back into water vapor in a conventional [[internal combustion engine]] to produce net energy.&lt;ref name = "Times"/&gt;

[[Philip Ball]], writing in academic journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', characterized Meyer's claims as pseudoscience, noting that "It's not easy to establish how Meyer's car was meant to work, except that it involved a fuel cell that was able to split water using less energy than was released by recombination of the elements&amp;nbsp;... Crusaders against pseudoscience can rant and rave as much as they like, but in the end they might as well accept that the myth of water as a fuel is never going to go away."&lt;ref name = "Nature"/&gt;

To date, no [[peer review]]ed studies of Meyer's devices have been published in the scientific literature. An article in journal ''Nature'' described Meyer's claims as one more "water as fuel" myth.&lt;ref name = "Nature"/&gt;

== Lawsuit ==
In 1996 Meyer was sued by two investors to whom he had sold dealerships, offering the right to do business in Water Fuel Cell technology. His car was due to be examined by the expert witness [[Michael Laughton]], Professor of [[Electrical Engineering]] at [[Queen Mary, University of London]] and [[Fellow]] of the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]]. However, Meyer made what Professor Laughton considered a "lame excuse" on the days of examination and did not allow the test to proceed.&lt;ref name = "Times"/&gt; According to Meyer, the technology was patent pending and under investigation by the patent office, the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] and the military.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} His "water fuel cell" was later examined by three expert witnesses{{who|date=January 2018}} in court who found that there "was nothing revolutionary about the cell at all and that it was simply using conventional electrolysis."  The court found Meyer had committed "gross and egregious fraud" and ordered him to repay the two investors their $25,000.&lt;ref name = "Times"/&gt;

== Meyer's death ==
Stanley Meyer died suddenly on March 20, 1998, while dining at a restaurant. His brother claimed that during a meeting with two Belgian investors in a restaurant, Meyer suddenly ran outside, saying "They poisoned me".&lt;ref name="Narciso"/&gt; After an investigation, the [[Grove City, Ohio|Grove City]] police went with the [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin County]] coroner report that ruled that Meyer, who had high blood pressure, died of a [[cerebral aneurysm]].&lt;ref name="Narciso"/&gt; Some of Meyer's supporters believe that he was assassinated to suppress his inventions.&lt;ref name="Narciso"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2007/07/08/hydroman.ART_ART_07-08-07_A1_4V77MOK.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214190405/http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2007/07/08/hydroman.ART_ART_07-08-07_A1_4V77MOK.html|archivedate=14 February 2008|date= July 8, 2007|accessdate=24 March 2008|author=Dean Narciso|work=[[The Columbus Dispatch]]|title=The Car that Ran on Water}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Nature"&gt;{{cite web

{{Saivism}}

The '''tattvas''' in [[Indian philosophy]] are elements or principles of reality.&lt;ref name="kasj"&gt;{{cite book | title=Kashmir Shaivism | publisher=SUNY Press | author=Jagadish Chandra Chatterji | year=1914 | isbn=9780887061790}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bhagavad"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bhagavadgitausa.com/TATTVAS-36.htm | title=Tattvas = 36 | publisher=Veeraswamy Krishnaraj | accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tattvas are the basic concepts to understand the nature of absolute, the souls and the universe in [[Samkhya]] and [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] philosophies. [[Samkhya]] philosophy lists 25 tattvas while later Shaivite philosophies extend the number to 36.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.lk/books?id=PbAvAAAAIAAJ | title=Philosophy East &amp; West | publisher=University Press of Hawaii, | year=1983 | pages=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tattvas are used to explain the structure and origin of the Universe. They are usually divided into three groups: ''Åuddha'' (pure tattvas); ''ÅuddhaÅuddha'' (pure-impure tattvas); and ''aÅuddha'' (impure tattvas). The pure tattvas describe internal aspects of the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]]; the pure-impure tattvas describe the soul and its limitations; while the impure tattvas include the [[Prakriti|universe]] and living beings that assist the existence of soul.&lt;ref name="Mathchan"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.lk/books?isbn=8182202582 | title=Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics | publisher=Global Vision Publishing House, | author=Mathew Chandrankunnel | year=2008 | isbn=9788182202580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Samkhya]] philosophy considers there exist only 25 tattvas -  twenty four atma tattvas along with atman or soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophical Series, Issue 7|publisher=University of Madras|year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to later Shaivite philosophies, ''[[shiva|Parashiva]]'' or '''[[Parameshwara (God)|Parameshwara]]'''  is the [[ultimate Reality]] or [[Parabrahman]], "the one form where everything emerges. &lt;ref name="sou"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.lk/books?id=_kNuAAAAMAAJ | title=South Indian studies | publisher=Geetha Book House | author=T. V. Mahalingam | year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[nondualist]]ic [[monism]] school of Shaivism, [[Kashmir Shaivism]], describes the tattvas as Paramshiva manifests himself by a process of descent from ''Paramashiva'' to ''jiva'', through the 36 ''tattvas''.&lt;ref group="web" name="P.L.Rayna" /&gt; Spanda, The vibrant creative energy of Parashiva known as Spanda, moves him to manifest himself  these 36 tattvas as a ''[[lÄ«lÄ]]'' or divine play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.lk/books?isbn=0595293891 | title=The Sutras on the 5-Fold Act of Divine Consciousness | author=Acharya Kedar | year=2003 | isbn=0595293891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important sect of Shaivism, [[Shaiva Siddhanta]], a [[monism]]-cum-[[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualistic]] school, describes the tattvas in a different perspective. Passive Parameshwara is activated itself by Suddha [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] or divine grace ([[Shakti]]) of him. Like that, the universe, ([[Prakriti]]) is activated by ashudda Maya (physical body and all aspects of universe), another aspect of divine grace - [[Shakti|Mahamaya]].  The interaction of Pure Maya and Impure Maya is the Pure - impure Maya where the souls ([[Atman (Hinduism)|Pashus]]) attain knowledge which leads to the existence of whole universe.&lt;ref name="bhagavad" /&gt; 
[[File:36tattvas.jpg|thumb|center|500px|The thirty six [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] tattvas are divided into three groups - pure, impure and pure-impure tattvas]]
Mahamaya divides itself into three aspects: Åuddha Maya, Åuddha-aÅuddha Maya, and AÅuddha Maya, and causes five, seven, and twenty four tattvas respectively.&lt;ref name="phi"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=8120806328 | title=Philosophical Anthropology in Åaiva SiddhÄnta: With Special Reference to ÅivÄgrayogin | author=Jayandra Soni | year=1989 | isbn=8120806328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Five pure tattvas ==
[[File:Shiva%27s_statue_at_CERN_engaging_in_the_Nataraja_dance.jpg|thumb|The five pure Saiva tattvas are associated with the five acts of Lord Shiva in his [[Nataraja]] depiction.]]
''Suddha tattvas'', also known as '''Åaiva tattvas''' are functioning in the absolute level which leads to the '''Panchakritya''' (Five acts) -  Creation-Maintenance-Destruction-Concealment-Grace of almighty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Concepts of Time, Ancient and Modern | publisher=Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts | author=Kapila Vatsyayan | year=1996 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ka_WAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suddha tattvas are called pure because they are directly created by Shiva himself.&lt;ref group=web name="P.L.Rayna" /&gt;

===Åiva===
Also known as Sakala tattva. One of the two aspects of the omniscient, omnipresent, conscious Absolute. In this essence, the Absolute doesn't consists of any desire (''icchÄ''), action (''kriyÄ'') or Knowledge (''jnÄna'') related properties. It is in its pure conscious state.

===Åakti===
Another aspect of the Absolute. Pairing of Åiva-Åakti causes the creation of all the lower tattvas. The paired Åiva-Åakti is omniscience and consistently active. These two properties of Åiva-Åakti are known [[jnana|''jnÄna'']] and [[kriya|''kriyÄa'']] respectively.

=== SadÄkhya ===
Also called SadÄÅiva tattva or NÄda tattva. This tattva is responsible for the appearance of ''aham'' or [[self]]. This tattva is when ''kriyÄÅakti'' and ''jnÄnaÅakti'' of the Absolute are in equilibrium.

===IÅvara===
Aso known as Bindu tattva. The tattva where the fourth act of ''Panchakritya'' - delusion or concealment happens. IÅvara tattva activates the souls which are concealed by ''[[pÄÅa]]''. ''Idam'', "this is myself", i.e., the objectivation of self-awareness is caused by IÅvara tattva.&lt;ref group=web name="P.L.Rayna" /&gt;

=== Åuddha VidyÄ ===
Also known as SadvidyÄ or KriyÄ. JnÄnaÅakti is more initiative than kriyaÅakti in ÅuddhavidyÄ tattva. Here, "self-ness" and "this-ness" become balanced. &lt;ref group=web name="P.L.Rayna" /&gt; The other three acts of Panchakritya - creation, maintenance and destruction are done below suddhavidya.{{Clarify|reason=|date=August 2018}}

These five tattvas are the Absolute which leads to the [[moksha]] of souls. Or this five tattvas can be seen as retrogradation of souls from lower state to its higher steps towards liberation.

== Seven pure-impure tattvas==
[[Image:Tattvas36.gif|thumb|right|300px|Chart of the 36 tattvas in Kashmir Shaivism]]
{{main|Shuddhashuddha tattvas}}
Pure-impure tattvas or Vidya tattvas are described as the "instruments" that assist the souls for their liberation. Soul or Atman is considered as "Purusha tattva" here, while the final manifestation of almighty is known as "Maya tattva". Maya manifests into five more tattvas known as "kanchukas"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publications | author=Chandradhar Sharma | year=2000 | pages=389 | isbn=9788120803657}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these six tattvas adjoins the pusursha tattva and thus, produce seven vidya tattvas.

=== MÄyÄ ===
Maya hides the divine nature of created beings as it creates the sense of separateness from the Divine and from each other.

===The five ''kanchukas''===
''Kanchukas'' can be fairly translated as cloaks. They block the subject from recognising the divine nature of the Universe. 
* [[KÄla (time)|''kÄla'']] - the cloak of time
* [[Vidya|''vidyÄ'']] - the cloak of limited knowledge
*''rÄga'' - the cloak of desire
*''niyati'' - the cloak of causality
*''kalÄ'' - the cloak of being limited&lt;ref group=web name="P.L.Rayna" /&gt;

=== Purusha ===
{{Main|Atman (Hinduism)}}
{{Clarify|reason=Entire paragraph needs a rewrite|date=August 2018}} Purusha is the soul. It pairs with maya, the final manifestation of god along with five kancukas. These five vidya tattvas are idle in nature. So, Åiva joins with Maya and Åakti joins with three kancukas - KÄla, Niyati,KalÄ. Sadasiva joins with purusha and Åuddhavidya operates vidya tattva. Raga is operated by Ishvara.&lt;ref name = phi/&gt;  The activated purusha with other vidya tattvas cannot exist in universe solely. There comes the assistance of upcoming 24 asuddha tattvas.

== Twenty-four impure tattvas ==
Impure tattvas or Atma tattvas are aspects of Universe and physical body.

=== Antahkarana ===
Consciousness within the limited ''purusha'' forms the [[citta|''citta'']] made of Intellect (''buddhi''), Ego (''ahamkÄra''), and Mind (''manas''), known collectively as the ''antahkarana'', or "inner organ". ''Buddhi'' is the first evolute of ''praká¹ti''. It represents the capacity of discernment. It evolves into ''ahamkÄra'' after ''buddhi'' differentiates a notion of a limited individual self. That external sense of self is then experienced through the sensory mind (''manas''). Ten ''indriyas'' (five sense organs and five action organs), five ''tanmÄtras'' (subtle elements), five ''mahÄbhÅ«tas'' (gross elements), and the sensory mind evolve from ''ahamkÄra'' as it modifies into [[sattva|''sattvic'']] (sensory), [[rajas|''rajasic'']] (active) and [[tamas (philosophy)|''tamasic'']] (material) modes. These 24 lowest tattvas that evolve from individual consciousness are known as the impure tattvas (''aÅuddha''). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.lk/books?id=cqoTzwdeTN4C | title=A Trident of Wisdom: Translation of Paratrisika-vivarana | publisher=SUNY Press | author=Abhinavagupta, Jaideva Singh | isbn=9780791494127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Five sense organs===
The five sense organs (''jÃ±Änendriya'') are the most ''sattvic'' functions of manas and include:
*''ghrÄna'' (nose), i.e., the medium to experience smell
*''rasana'' (tongue), i.e., the medium to experience taste
* ''caksus'' (eye), i.e., the medium to experience colour and shape
* ''tvÄk'' (skin), i.e., the medium to experience touch
*''Årotra'' (ear), i.e, the medium to experience sound

===Five motor organs===
The five motor organs (''karmendriya''), each corresponding to a sense organ, represent the physical organs of action. They are the most rajasic functions of manas.  

* ''pÄyu'' (anus) - the organ responsible for excretion
* ''upasthÄ'' (sexual organ) - the organ that enables procreation and sexual enjoyment&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Kashmir Shaivism, Gurudev Siddha Peeth, Ganeshpuri, 1975, pag. 33&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''pÄda'' (leg) - the organ that makes ambulation possible
* ''pÄni'' (hand) - the organ that enables grabbing and touching
* ''vÄk'' (mouth) - the organ that makes sound/speech possible

===Five subtle elements===
The five subtle elements (''tanmÄtra'') are the most tamasic functions of ''manas'' and represent the reflection of the corresponding five gross elements in the mind:

* ''gandha'' (smell)
* ''rÄsa'' (taste)
* ''rÅ«pa'' (form)
* ''sparÅa'' (touch)
* ''Åabda'' (sound)

=== Five gross elements===
{{Main|Panchabhuta}}
The five gross elements (''mahÄbhuta'') represent the final point of manifestation:

*''prthvi'' (earth)
*''jala'' (water)
*''tejas'' (fire)
*''vÄyu'' (air)
*''ÄkÄÅa'' (ether or space)

While ''mahÄbhÅ«tas'' are the basis for the material world, ''tanmÄtras'' are but limited aspects and views of it, in no way able to fully describe it. We cannot actually perceive the reality, all we can access are limited "bands" of information that form a [[Direct and indirect realism|description of reality]]. These bands of information are the five ''[[tanmatras|tanmÄtras]]''.

This restriction however applies only to the limited beings (''jiva'', or ''{{IAST|aá¹u}}''). For one who has gone beyond ''mÄyÄ'', in the realm of the ''pure tattvas'', there can be direct perception of reality, because as one's self is [[Ätman (Hinduism)|Ätman]], so are the external objects. In such a state an enlightened being can perceive the world beyond the five senses (direct perception), in a state of diversity in unity and unity in diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.lk/books?id=EOrWAAAAMAAJ | title=Ultimate Reality and Meaning, Volume 24 | publisher=Van Gorcum | author=Institute for Encyclopedia of Human Ideas on Ultimate Reality and Meaning | year=2001 | pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Lightning Process''' ('''LP''') is a three-day personal training programme developed by British [[Osteopathy|osteopath]] Phil Parker.&lt;ref Name=Laura&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/laura-mvula-i-dont-think-im-good-at-being-a-pop-star-its-making-me-too-paranoid-9129575.html "Laura Mvula: 'I don't think I'm good at being a pop star. It's making me too paranoid'"], ''The Independent'', 16 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It claims to be beneficial for various conditions, including [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], depression and chronic pain. The Lightning Process is not recommended by the [[NHS]] for the treatment of [[chronic fatigue syndrome]]. &lt;ref name=nhs_choices&gt;{{cite web|title=Lightning Process 'could help children with chronic fatigue syndrome', study claims|url=https://www.nhs.uk/news/medical-practice/lightning-process-could-help-children-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-study-claims/|website=nhs.uk|accessdate=5 October 2017|date=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed in the late 1990s, it aims to teach techniques for managing the [[Fight-or-flight response|acute stress response]] that the body experiences under threat. The course aims to help recognise the stress response, calm it and manage it in the long term. It also applies some ideas drawn from [[neurolinguistic programming]], as well as elements of [[life coaching]]. The approach has raised some controversy.&lt;ref name="Cormier2008b"/&gt;&lt;ref Name=BMJ/&gt; It is [[trademark]]ed.&lt;ref name=Crawley-2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Crawley E, Mills N, Hollingworth W, etal |title=Comparing specialist medical care with specialist medical care plus the Lightning Process for chronic fatigue syndrome or myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial (SMILE Trial) |journal=Trials |volume=14 |issue= |page=444 |year=2013 |pmid=24370208 |pmc=3879423 |doi=10.1186/1745-6215-14-444 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Lightning Process comprises three group sessions conducted on three consecutive days, lasting about 12 hours altogether, conducted by trained practitioners.&lt;ref name=Crawley-2013/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parker 2010 7"&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|2010|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref Name=Intro/&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref name="what_is_lightning_process"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lightningprocess.com/what-is-the-lightning-process/ |title=What is the Lightning Process?  |first=Phil |last=Parker |work=The Lightning Process |date= |accessdate=February 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its developer, Phil Parker, the programme aims to teach participants about the [[Fight-or-flight response|acute stress response]] the body experiences under threat. It aims to help trainees spot when this response is happening and learn how to calm it. Techniques based on movement, postural awareness and personal coaching are intended to modify the production of stress hormones. Participants practise a learnt series of steps to habituate the calming method.&lt;ref name="Parker 2010 7"/&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref Name=Intro&gt;Parker (2010), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref name="PHM"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rimmer |first=Vikki |date=August 2008 |title=The Lightning Process Treatment for ME |journal=Positive Health Magazine |issue=150 |url=http://www.positivehealth.com/article/cfs-me/the-lightning-process-treatment-for-me |accessdate=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationale for the programme draws on ideas of osteopaths [[Andrew Taylor Still]] and J M Littlejohn regarding nervous system dysregulation and addressing clients' needs in a [[holistic]] manner rather than focusing solely on symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|2010|pp=42â44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref Name=Intro42&gt;Parker (2010), pp. 42-44&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; It also  incorporates ideas drawn from [[neuro-linguistic programming]] and [[life coaching]].&lt;ref name="Cormier2008a"&gt;{{cite news | last = Cormier | first = Zoe | date =March 8, 2008 | title = 'Talk Therapy' Takes On Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Coming Soon To Canada | work = [[The Globe and Mail]] |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/science/medicine-talk-therapy-takes-on-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-coming-soon-to-canada/article26391/ |accessdate=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A basic premise is that individuals can influence their own  physiological responses in controlled and repeatable ways.&lt;ref name="Parker 2010 17"&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|2010|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such learnt [[emotional self-regulation]], it is suggested, could help overcome illness and improve well being, if the method is practised consistently.&lt;ref name="Parker 2010 17"/&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref Name=Intro17&gt;Parker (2010), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Parker advocates attending the training course in order to gain a full understanding of the tools in a safe and supportive context.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|2010|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref Name=Intro11&gt;Parker (2010), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; He also lays emphasis on the trainee playing an active role in recovery (the course is framed as a fully participatory 'training', not a passive 'treatment' or set of answers given to a 'patient').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|2010|pp=13â16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|2010|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref Name=Intro16&gt;Parker (2010), pp. 13-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=Intro27&gt;Parker (2010), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; He claims that the programme has helped to resolve various conditions including depression, panic attacks, insomnia, drug addictions, chronic pain and [[multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|2010|pp=25â26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref Name=Intro26&gt;Parker (2010), pp. 25-26&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;  The program has also been used with [[chronic fatigue syndrome]].&lt;ref Name=BMJ&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d3780 |title=Dangers of research into chronic fatigue syndrome |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=342 |number=d3780 |date=22 June 2011 |last=Hawkes |first=Nigel |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PHM" /&gt;

==Criticism and support==
There has been criticism of the cost of the three-day course.&lt;ref name="Kinnes"&gt;{{cite news | last = Kinnes | first = Sally |date=September 2, 2007 |title=Coping with ME |work=[[The Sunday Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=talktherapy&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/science/medicine-talk-therapy-takes-on-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-coming-soon-to-canada/article958170/?page=1 |title=Medicine: 'Talk therapy' takes on chronic fatigue syndrome: coming soon to Canada |newspaper=Globe and Mail |date=13 March 2009 |last=Cormier |first=Zoe |accessdate=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been criticism of the claimed benefits (see also [[#Advertising Standards Authority ruling|below]]).&lt;ref name="Cormier2008b"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cormier |first=Zoe |date=April 18, 2008 |title=Lightning Process - Controversial training program comes to Canada |work=[[CBC News]] |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/health/lightning-process.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=talktherapy/&gt; John Greensmith, of the British advocacy group ME Free For All, stated "We think their claims are extravagant... if patients get better, they claim the success of the treatment â but if they don't, they say the patient is responsible."&lt;ref name="Cormier2008b"/&gt;

Some chronic fatigue syndrome [[patient support groups]] have strongly objected to the perceived implication that the disease has psychological causes.&lt;ref name="Cormier2008b"/&gt; However, the Lightning Process website states that it is a neuro-physiological approach and that it considers CFS/ME to be a physical illness.&lt;ref name=faq&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lightningprocess.com/facts-and-myths/ |title=Facts and Myths |last=Parker |first=Phil |work=The Lightning Process |accessdate=October 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nigel Hawkes writing for the BMJ describes the Lightning Process as being "secretive about its methods, lacks overall medical supervision, and has a cultish quality because many of the therapists are former sufferers who deliver the programme with great conviction" and that "Some children who do not benefit have said that they feel blamed for the failure".&lt;ref name=bmj&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hawkes|first1=Nigel|title=Training for children with chronic fatigue works better than medical care alone, finds study|journal=BMJ|date=21 September 2017|pages=j4372|doi=10.1136/bmj.j4372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people have claimed rapid cures for longstanding illnesses.&lt;ref name="Cormier2008b"/&gt; Prominent advocates of the process include [[Esther Rantzen]] (whose daughter has [[coeliac disease]] and chronic fatigue syndrome),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rantzen |first=Esther |title=At last, I have discovered the secret of Emily's 14 lost years, by Esther Rantzen | newspaper = [[Daily Mail]] |date=February 15, 2011 |url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1356316/At-I-discovered-secret-Emilys-14-lost-years-Esther-Rantzen.html |accessdate=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; British journalist [[Patrick Strudwick]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Strudwick|first=Patrick|authorlink=Patrick Strudwick|title=Lightning cure ... or a flash in the pan? |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=February 22, 2011 |pages=7â8}}&lt;/ref&gt; French dancer Chris Marques,&lt;ref name="MidSussexTimes"&gt;{{cite news |date=April 14, 2008 |title=Young ME sufferer Anna thanks her 'cool' headteacher |work=[[Mid Sussex Times]] |url = http://www.midsussextimes.co.uk/509/Young-ME-sufferer-Anna-thanks.3978784.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hardy|first=Rebecca|title=Austin Healey: I'd been through hell before Strictly| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1093798/Austin-Healey-Id-hell-Strictly.html |accessdate=February 25, 2011 |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=December 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and singer [[Laura Mvula]].&lt;ref Name=Laura/&gt;

===Advertising Standards Authority ruling===  
In 2011 Hampshire Trading Standards requested that the UK [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) give a ruling on the website www.lightningprocess.com, arguing that the information on the site was misleading in four areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |department=Committees of Advertising |title=Health: The Lightning process |url=https://www.asa.org.uk/advice-online/health-the-lightning-process.html |work=Advertising Standards Authority UK |date=5 October 2012 |accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ASA upheld two of the four challenges.&lt;ref name="ASA" /&gt; They concluded that although there seemed to be some evidence of participant improvement during trials conducted, the trials were not controlled, the evidence was not sufficient enough to draw robust conclusions, and more investigation was necessary; consequently, the website's claims at the time were deemed misleading.&lt;ref name="ASA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2012/8/Phil-Parker-Group-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_158035.aspx|title=ASA Adjudication on Phil Parker Group Ltd|publisher=ASA|quote=The pilot study conducted with the International Centre For Wellness Research reported positive results from a sample of 17 participants. However, we understood that the study was not controlled and had concluded that further investigation was necessary... We noted that the trials conducted by the ME Association, the Brighton and Sussex Medical School and the Sussex &amp; Kent CFS/ME Society reported positive results but were self-assessment studies and had not been controlled. We considered that those studies and surveys did not constitute a suitably robust body of evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of the LP in the treatment of CFS/ME. Because of that, we concluded that the CFS/ME page of the website was likely to mislead... The claims on the website should not appear again in their current form. We told Phil Parker Group to ensure they did not make medical claims for the LP unless they were supported with robust evidence.|accessdate=May 4, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031120421/http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2012/8/Phil-Parker-Group-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_158035.aspx|archivedate=31 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
A registered clinical trial (UK SMILE pilot study) was conducted in England at Bristol University, with results published in 2017.&lt;ref name=SMILE&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawley|first1=Esther M|last2=Gaunt|first2=Daisy M|last3=Garfield|first3=Kirsty|last4=Hollingworth|first4=William|last5=Sterne|first5=Jonathan A C|last6=Beasant|first6=Lucy|last7=Collin|first7=Simon M|last8=Mills|first8=Nicola|last9=Montgomery|first9=Alan A|title=Clinical and cost-effectiveness of the Lightning Process in addition to specialist medical care for paediatric chronic fatigue syndrome: randomised controlled trial|journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood|date=20 September 2017|pages=archdischild-2017-313375|doi=10.1136/archdischild-2017-313375}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the results are promising its use is not recommended as of 2017 by the [[National Health Services]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=nhs_choices/&gt;

A [[qualitative study]] on experiences of the course among a group of young people with chronic fatigue syndrome was published in 2003.&lt;ref Name=BPS&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8287.2012.02093.x |volume=18 |title=Experiences of young people who have undergone the Lightning Process to treat chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis - a qualitative study |year=2012 |journal=British Journal of Health Psychology |pages=508â525 |last1 = Endresen Reme |first1=Silje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public reaction to research===
Esther Crawley said that "I never expected it would work" and that "This is an important study as it provides another treatment approach that some may find helpful. However, while these results are promising, further research is needed to establish which aspects of the process are helpful, whether it is an effective treatment on its own, and whether it could be used to help more severely affected patients."&lt;ref name=bmj/&gt;

Results of the study by Crawley were publicized at the [[Science Media Centre]] in September 2017; an editorial on its own presentation of the results of the SMILE study stated: "If you had only read the headlines for the CFS/ME story you may conclude that the treatment tested at Bristol might be worth a try if you are blighted by the illness, when in truth the author said repeatedly that the findings would first have to be replicated in a bigger trial."&lt;ref name=Fox92017&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/inconvenient-truths/ |title=Inconvenient truths |first=Fiona |last=Fox |author-link=Fiona Fox (press officer) |work=Science Media Centre |location=London |date=September 28, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reactions to their briefing were stronger than expected: "it was the criticism from within the scientific community that we had not anticipated."&lt;ref name=Fox92017 /&gt; The briefing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/the-lightning-process-a-controversial-treatment-for-children-with-chronic-fatigue/ |title=The Lightning Process â a controversial treatment for children with chronic fatigue |date=September 20, 2017 |work=Science Media Centre |location=London |accessdate=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; invited four psychologists to make comments on the study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Expert reaction to controversial treatment for CFS/ME |url=http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-controversial-treatment-for-cfsme/ |date=September 20, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |work=Science Media Centre |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were mild in their reactions, while the commentary on the September 28, 2017 article evoked detailed, well-referenced but anonymous criticisms of the SMILE study and the Lightning Process in the comments section.&lt;ref name=Fox92017 /&gt;

Dorothy Bishop from Oxford University commented that "The gains for patients in this study seem solid. However, while the patient allocation and statistical analysis of the trial appear to be done to a high standard, the intervention that was assessed is commercial and associated with a number of warning signs. The Lightning Process appears based on neurolinguistic programming, which has long been recognised as pseudoscience.â&lt;ref name=bmj/&gt;

It was the result of a collaboration between over 8,000 scientists from the [[IUCN Species Survival Commission|International Union for Conservation of Nature Species Survival Commission]] (IUCN SSC), along with the [[Zoological Society of London]].&lt;ref name="zsl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zsl.org/conservation/news/the-100-most-threatened-species,997,NS.html|work=ZSL Living Conservation|publisher=The Zoological Society of London|title=The 100 most threatened species|accessdate=16 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914051800/http://www.zsl.org/conservation/news/the-100-most-threatened-species,997,NS.html|archivedate=14 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was published by the Zoological Society of London in 2012 as the book, ''Priceless or Worthless?''&lt;ref name="PorW"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baillie|first=Jonathan E M|author2=Ellen R Butcher|title=Priceless or Worthless?|publisher=ZoolFlyway to wintering grounds in Indiaogical Society of London|year=2012|isbn=978-0-900881-67-1|url=http://static.zsl.org/files/priceless-or-worthless-final-wq-2040-2050.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021004847/http://static.zsl.org/files/priceless-or-worthless-final-wq-2040-2050.pdf|archivedate=2012-10-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While all the species on the list are threatened with extinction, the scientists who chose them had another criterion: all the species have no obvious benefit for humans and therefore have no vested interests trying to save them. Iconic and charismatic species, such as tigers and pandasâalong with economically important speciesâhave many defenders, while these apparently "worthless" species had none. The title of the report, "Priceless or Worthless?", is based on that shared quality of the species.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/11/100-most-endangered-species-listed|title=The expendables? World's 100 most endangered species listed|last=Harvey|first=Fiona|date=10 September 2012|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report's co-author, Ellen Butcher, stated one of the guiding principles of the list, "If we take immediate action we can give them a fighting chance for survival. But this requires society to support the moral and ethical position that all species have an inherent right to exist."&lt;ref name="Globe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kew"&gt;''Kew Magazine'' stated that, "A strong and consistent moral and ethical stance needs to be taken, they (the authors of The List) argue, that all species have a right to exist." {{cite web|url=http://www.kew.org/news/kew-blogs/kew-magazine/Kew-Magazine-Blog---Every-Species-Counts.htm|title=Every species counts|last=Harrison|first=Christina|work=Kew Magazine Blog|publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report was released in [[Jeju City|Jeju]], [[South Korea]], on September 11, 2012, at the quadrennial meeting of IUCN, the World Conservation Congress. At the Congress, it was reported that scientists are finding it more and more common to have to justify funding for protection of species by showing what the human benefits would be. Jonathan Baillie, of the Zoological Society of London and co-author of the report, stated that, "The donor community and conservation movement are increasingly leaning towards a 'what can nature do for us?' approach, where species and wild habitats are valued and prioritised according to these services they provided for people. This has made it increasingly difficult for conservationists to protect the most threatened species on the planet."&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/11/100-most-endangered-species-listed|title=The expendables?

Some of the threatened species are down to only a handful of surviving members. [[Cavia intermedia|Santa Catarinaâs guinea pig]], native to a single island in Brazil, is down to its last 40â60 individuals, reduced by hunting and habitat disturbance. The [[great Indian bustard]] is threatened by habitat loss resulting from agriculture and human development, and is down to the last 50â249 individuals.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/smartnews/2012/09/the-best-argument-for-saving-threatened-species-that-do-not-benefit-humans/|title=The Best Argument for Saving Threatened Species That Do Not Benefit Humans|date=12 September 2012|work=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Elaeocarpus bojeri]]'', a flowering plant found only on the island of [[Mauritius]], has fewer than 10 surviving individuals, because of loss of habitat. The [[Baishan fir]] (''Abies beshanzuensis''), native to China, is down to five surviving mature individuals. ''Priceless or Worthless?'' describes the threats that each species is facing, along with measures that would aid their survival.&lt;ref name="PorW" /&gt;

{{buddhism}}
The '''TrikÄya doctrine''' ([[Sanskrit]], literally "three bodies"; {{cjkv|c=ä¸èº«|p=sÄnshÄn|rr=samsin|v=tam thÃ¢n|r=sanjin, sanshin}}, {{bo|t=à½¦à¾à½´à¼à½à½¦à½´à½|w=sku gsum}}) is a [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhist]] teaching on both the nature of reality and the nature of [[Buddhahood]].

==Definition==
The doctrine says that a Buddha has three ''kÄyas'' or ''bodies'':
# The ''[[DharmakÄya]]'', ''Buddha nature'', ''law and order'', or ''Truth body'' which embodies the very principle of enlightenment and knows no limits or boundaries;
# The ''[[Saá¹bhogakÄya]]'', ''Buddha fields'' or ''body of mutual enjoyment'' which is a body of bliss or clear light manifestation;
# The ''[[NirmÄá¹akÄya]]'', ''Buddha incarnation'', ''Emanation'', or ''created body'' which manifests in time and space.&lt;ref name="Welwood, John 2007"&gt;Welwood, John (2000). [http://www.purifymind.com/PlayMind.htm ''The Play of the Mind: Form, Emptiness, and Beyond''], accessed January 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Trikaya Alternate translations"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bob Kindler |first1=Babaji |title=A Quintessential Yoga Vasishtha |date=04/30/2010 |publisher=SRV Associations |location=Portland, USA |isbn=978-1891893100 |pages=254 |edition=1st |url=https://www.amazon.com/Quintessential-Yoga-Vasishtha-Babaji-Kindler/dp/1891893106 |accessdate=30/09/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

===PÄli Canon===
Even before the Buddha's [[Parinirvana|parinirvÄá¹a]], the term ''DhammakÄya'' was current. DhammakÄya literally means ''Truth body''.

In the [[PÄli Canon]], [[Gautama Buddha]] tells [[Vasistha|Vasettha]] that the [[TathÄgata]] (the Buddha) is the DhammakÄya, the 'Truth-body' or the 'Embodiment of Truth', as well as ''DhammabhÅ«ta'', 'Truth-become', 'One who has become Truth' &lt;ref&gt;[[DÄ«gha NikÄya 27.9]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Walsh, Maurice. 1995. The Long Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the DÄ«gha NikÄya. Boston: Wisdom Publications, âAggaÃ±Ã±a Sutta: On Knowledge of Beginnings,â p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha is equated with the Dhamma: "[T]he Buddha comforts him, 'Enough, Vakkali. Why do you want to see this filthy body? Whoever sees the Dhamma sees me; whoever sees me sees the Dhamma.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.5-6.than.html http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.5-6.than.html] [[Samyutta Nikaya]] (SN 22.87) See footnote #3&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[AggaÃ±Ã±a Sutta]]'', the Buddha advises Vasettha that whoever has strong, deep rooted, and established belief in the Tathagatha, he can declare that he is the child of [[Bhagavan]], born from the mouth of Dhamma, created from Dhamma, and the heir of Dhamma. Because the titles of the Tathagatha are: The Body of Dhamma, The Body of [[BrahmÄ (Buddhism)|Brahma]], the Manifestation of Dhamma, and the Manifestation of Brahma.

===MahÄyÄna===
The DharmakÄya doctrine was possibly first expounded in the ''Aá¹£á¹­asÄhasrikÄ [[Prajnaparamita|PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ]]'' "The Perfection of Wisdom In Eight Thousand Verses", composed in the 1st century BCE.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] introduced the [[SambhogakÄya]], which conceptually fits between the NirmÄá¹akÄya (the manifestations of enlightenment in the physical world){{refn|group=note|Formerly called [[RÅ«pa|Rupakaya]]}} and the Dharmakaya. The Sambhogakaya is that aspect of the Buddha, or the Dharma, that one meets in visions and in deep meditation. It could be considered an interface with the Dharmakaya.

The Trikaya-doctrine and the [[Buddha-nature]] bring the transcendental within reach, by placing the transcendental within the [[plane of immanence]].

Around 300 CE, the Yogacara school systematized the prevalent ideas on the nature of the Buddha in the Trikaya or ''three-body doctrine''.{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=126}}

==Interpretation in Buddhist traditions==
Schools have different ideas about what the three bodies are.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huayen.org.tw/thesis/10/1010.pdf ä½ä¸èº«è§ä¹ç ç©¶ï¼ä»¥æ¼¢è­¯ç¶è«çºä¸»è¦ç ç©¶å°è±¡] {{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://enlight.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-MAG/mag89471.html ä½éçä¸èº«è§]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese Mahayana===

====Pure Land====
The Three Bodies of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] from the point of view of [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land Buddhist]] thought can be broken down like so:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hattori | first = Sho-on | title = A Raft from the Other Shore : Honen and the Way of Pure Land Buddhism | publisher = Jodo Shu Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 4-88363-329-2 | pages=25â27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Nirmaá¹akÄya is a physical/manifest body of a Buddha. An example would be [[Gautama Buddha]]'s body.
* The [[SambhogakÄya]] is the reward/enjoyment body, whereby a [[bodhisattva]] completes his vows and becomes a Buddha. [[AmitÄbha]], Vajrasattva and Manjushri are examples of Buddhas with the Sambhogakaya body.
* The [[DharmakÄya]] is the embodiment of the truth itself, and it is commonly seen as transcending the forms of physical and spiritual bodies.  [[Vairocana]] Buddha is often depicted as the DharmakÄya, particularly in esoteric Buddhist schools such as [[Shingon Buddhism]], [[Tendai]] and [[Kegon]] in Japan.

As with earlier Buddhist thought, all three forms of the Buddha teach the same [[Dharma]], but take on different forms to expound the truth.

====Chan Buddhism====
According to Schloegl, in the ''[[Linji school#Zhenzhou Linji Huizhao Chansi yulu .281120.29|Zhenzhou Linji Huizhao Chansi Yulu]]'', the Three Bodies of the Buddha are not taken as absolute. They would be "mental configurations" that "are merely names or props" and would only perform a role of light and shadow of the mind.{{sfn|Schloegl|1976|p=19}}{{refn|group=note|Lin-ji yu-lu: "The scholars of the Sutras and Treatises take the Three Bodies as absolute. As I see it, this is not so. These Three Bodies are merely names, or props. An old master said: "The (Buddha's) Bodies are set up with reference to meaning; the (Buddha) Fields are distinguished with reference to substance." However, understood clearly, the Dharma Nature Bodies and the Dharma Nature Fields are only mental configurations."{{sfn|Schloegl|1976|p=21}}}}

The ''Zhenzhou Linji Huizhao Chansi Yulu'' advises:
{{quote|Do you wish to be not different from the Buddhas and patriarchs? Then just do not look for anything outside. The pure light of your own heart [i.e., å¿, mind] at this instant is the Dharmakaya Buddha in your own house. The non-differentiating light of your heart at this instant is the Sambhogakaya Buddha in your own house. The non-discriminating light of your own heart at this instant is the Nirmanakaya Buddha in your own house.  This trinity of the Buddha's body is none other than he here before your eyes, listening to my expounding the Dharma.{{sfn|Schloegl|1976|p=18}}}}

====Fourth and Fifth Bodies - SvÄbhÄvikakÄya and Mahasukhakaya====
{{See also|Kosha}}

[[Vajrayana]] sometimes refers to a fourth body called the ''svÄbhÄvikakÄya'' ({{bo|t=à½à½¼à¼à½à½¼à¼à½à½²à½à¼à½à¾±à½²à¼à½¦à¾à½´|w=ngo bo nyid kyi sku}}) "essential body",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khandro.net/doctrine_trikaya.htm remarks on Svabhavikakaya by khandro.net]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the book ''Embodiment of Buddhahood'' Chapter 4 the subject is: Embodiment of Buddhahood in its Own Realization: [[Yogacara]] Svabhavikakaya as Projection of Praxis and Gnoseology.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jigtenmig.blogspot.com/2007/10/ngo-bo-nyid-kyi-sku-svabhahavikakaya.html explanation of meaning]&lt;/ref&gt; and to a fifth body, called the mahÄsÅ«khakÄya ({{bo|w=bde ba chen po'i sku}}, "great bliss body").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=TsangnyÃ¶n Heruka|authorlink1=TsangnyÃ¶n Heruka|title=The life of Marpa the translator : seeing accomplishes all|date=1995|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston|isbn=978-1570620874|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; The svÄbhÄvikakÄya is simply the unity or non-separateness of the three kayas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khandro.net/doctrine_trikaya.htm khandro.net citing H.E. Tai Situpa]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also known in [[Gelug]] teachings, where it is one of the assumed two aspects of the dharmakÄya: ''svÄbhÄvikakÄya'' "essence body" and jÃ±ÄnakÄya "body of wisdom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Paul|title=Mahayana Buddhism: the doctrinal foundations|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-02537-9|edition=Reprinted|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z3FuzkBnOxAC&amp;pg=PR10&amp;dq=Mah%C4%81y%C4%81na+Buddhism&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=imY1Ve7oLYSksAXX4oDgCg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=j%C3%B1anakaya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Haribhadra (Buddhist philosopher)|Haribhadra]] claims that the ''[[Abhisamayalankara]]'' describes [[Buddhahood]] through four kÄyas in chapter 8: svÄbhÄvikakÄya, [jÃ±Äna]dharmakÄya, sambhogakÄya and nirmÄá¹akÄya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Makransky|first1=John J.|title=Buddhahood embodied : sources of controversy in India and Tibet|date=1997|publisher=State Univ. of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=978-0791434314|page=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I4qmkptncxQC&amp;q=embodiment+of+kaya#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[dzogchen]] teachings, "dharmakaya" means the buddha-nature's absence of self-nature, that is, its emptiness of a conceptualizable essence, its cognizance or clarity is the sambhogakaya, and the fact that its capacity is 'suffused with self-existing awareness' is the nirmanakaya.&lt;ref&gt;[[Reginald Ray]], ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, page 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mahamudra====
The interpretation in [[Mahamudra]] is similar: When the mahamudra practices come to fruition, one sees that the mind and all phenomena are fundamentally empty of any identity; this emptiness is called ''dharmakÄya''. One perceives that the essence of mind is empty, but that it also has a potentiality that takes the form of luminosity.{{clarify|date=November 2013}} In Mahamudra thought, SambhogakÄya is understood to be this luminosity. NirmanakÄya is understood to be the powerful force with which the potentiality affects living beings.&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, pages 284-285.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anuyoga====
In the view of [[Anuyoga]], the [[Mind Stream]] (Sanskrit: ''citta santana'') is the 'continuity' (Sanskrit: ''santana''; Wylie: ''rgyud'') that links the Trikaya.&lt;ref name="Welwood, John 2007"/&gt; The TrikÄya, as a triune, is symbolised by the [[Gankyil]].

====Dakinis====
A [[dakini|á¸ÄkinÄ«]] ({{bo|t=à½à½à½ à¼à½ à½à¾²à½¼à¼[à½à¼]|w=mkha' 'gro [ma]}} ''khandro[ma]'') is a [[Tantra|tantric]] [[deity]] described as a female embodiment of enlightened energy. The Sanskrit term is likely related to the term for drumming, while the Tibetan term means "sky goer" and may have originated in the Sanskrit ''khecara'', a term from the ''[[Cakrasaá¹vara Tantra]]''.&lt;ref name=Buswell&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert Jr|editor2-last=Lopez|editor2-first=Donald S. Jr.|editor1-link=Robert Buswell Jr.|editor2-link=Donald S. Lopez, Jr.|title=Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism.|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691157863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

á¸ÄkinÄ«s can also be classified according to the trikÄya theory. The dharmakÄya á¸ÄkinÄ«, which is [[SamantabhadrÄ« (tutelary)|SamantabhadrÄ«]], represents the [[dharmadhatu]] where all phenomena appear. The sambhogakÄya á¸ÄkinÄ« are the [[yidam]]s used as meditational deities for tantric practice. The nirmanakaya á¸ÄkinÄ«s are human women born with special potentialities; these are realized [[yogini]], the consorts of the [[guru]]s, or even all women in general as they may be classified into the families of the [[Five Tathagatas]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Capriles, ElÃ­as (2003/2007). ''Buddhism and Dzogchen'' [http://webdelprofesor.ula.ve/humanidades/elicap/en/uploads/Biblioteca/bdz-e.version.pdf]', and Capriles, ElÃ­as (2006/2007). ''Beyond Being, Beyond Mind, Beyond History,'' vol. I, ''Beyond Being''[http://webdelprofesor.ula.ve/humanidades/elicap/en/Main/Bb-bm-bh]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-Buddhist Interpretations===

====Theosophy====
[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], a Western esoteric school founded in the 19th century, regards Buddhism as containing esoteric teachings. In those supposed esoteric teachings of Buddhism, "exoteric Buddhism" believes that Nirmanakaya simple means the physical body of Buddha. According to the esoteric interpretation, when the Buddha dies he assumes the Nirmanakaya, instead of going into [[Nirvana]]. He remains in that glorious body he has woven for himself, invisible to uninitiated mankind, to watch over and protect it.&lt;ref&gt;Helena Blavatsky, ''The Voice of the Silence'' Theosophical Publishing Co., pages 75-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Upaya Institute and Zen Center''' is a center for residential [[Zen]] practice located in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], and founded by [[Joan Halifax]] Roshi. The center focuses on integration of Zen practice with social action, with traditional cultivation of wisdom and compassion in the Buddhist sense. It also provides service in the areas of death and dying, prison work, environment, women's rights and peace work. According to the Upaya website, in 2002 [[Joan Halifax]] founded the Prajna Mountain Buddhist Order. A [[non-profit]] organization, Prajna is, a new Buddhist Order in the lineage of [[Taizan Maezumi]] Roshi, the [[Zen Peacemaker Order]] and [[White Plum Asanga]].&lt;ref&gt;Upaya Institute and Zen Center [http://www.upaya.org/roshi/prajna.php Prajna Mountain Forest Refuge]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ethics]], '''value''' denotes the degree of importance of some thing or action, with the aim of determining what actions are best to do or what way is best to live ([[normative ethics]]), or to describe the significance of different actions. Value systems are proscriptive and prescriptive beliefs, they affect ethical behavior of a person or are the basis of their intentional activities. Often primary values are strong and secondary values are suitable for changes, What makes an action valuable may in turn depend on the ethical values of the objects it increases, decreases or alters. An object with "ethic value" may be termed an "ethic or philosophic good" ([[noun]] sense).{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Values can be defined as broad preferences concerning appropriate courses of actions or outcomes. As such, values reflect a person's sense of right and wrong or what "ought" to be. "Equal rights for all", "Excellence deserves admiration",  and "People should be treated with respect and [[dignity]]" are representatives of values. Values tend to influence attitudes and behavior and these types include [[ethics|ethical]]/[[morality|moral]] values, [[doctrine|doctrinal]]/[[ideology|ideological]] (religious, political) values, [[norm (sociology)|social]] values, and [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] values. It is debated whether some values that are not clearly physiologically determined, such as [[altruism]], are [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic]], and whether some, such as acquisitiveness, should be classified as [[vice]]s or [[virtue]]s.

==Types of study==
Ethical value may be regarded as a study under [[ethics]], which, in turn, may be grouped as [[philosophy]]. Similarly, ''ethical value'' may be regarded as a subgroup of a broader field of [[Values (Western philosophy)|philosophic value]] sometimes referred to as [[axiology]]. Ethical value denotes something's degree of [[importance]], with the aim of determining what action or life is best to do, or at least attempt to describe the value of different actions. 

The study of ethical value is also included in [[value theory]]. In addition, values have been studied in various disciplines: [[anthropology]], [[behavioral economics]], [[business ethics]], [[corporate governance]], [[moral philosophy]], [[political sciences]], [[social psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[theology]].

=== Similar concepts===
''Ethical value'' is sometimes used synonymously with [[Good and evil|goodness]]. However, goodness has many other meanings and may be regarded as more ambiguous.

==Personal versus cultural perspectives==
Personal values exist in relation to cultural values, either in agreement with or divergence from prevailing norms.  A culture is a social system that shares a set of common values, in which such values permit social expectations and collective understandings of the good, beautiful and constructive.  Without normative personal values, there would be no cultural reference against which to measure the virtue of individual values and so cultural identity would disintegrate.

===Personal values===

Personal values provide an internal reference for what is good, beneficial, important, useful, beautiful, desirable and constructive. Values are one of the factors that generate behaviour{{Dubious |reason=It appears to be a bold statement. It is well documented in human behavior theories (Bandura's social cognitive theory, TRA, health belief model, etc.) numerous factors may contribute to a given behavior: peer pressure, norms, access to proper infrastructure, beliefs, etc. I don't know Rokeach work, but either this statement misinterpret Rokeach work, either Rokeach is attributing too much weight on value. This bold statement should then be nuanced and provided with more theories/empirical studies. |date=June 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Rokeach |first=Milton |authorlink=Milton Rokeach |year=1973 |title=The Nature of Human Values |location=New York |publisher=The Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and influence the choices made by an individual.

Values may help  common human problems for survival by comparative rankings of value, the results of which provide answers to questions of why people do what they do and in what order they choose to do them.{{clarify|date=February 2016}} Moral, religious, and personal values, when held rigidly, may also give rise to [[conflict (process)|conflicts]] that result from a clash between differing [[world view]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Maiese, Michelle. "[http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/underlying-causes Causes of Disputes and Conflicts]." ''Beyond Intractability''. Ed. Guy Burgess and Heidi Burgess. Conflict Research Consortium, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado. October 2003. Downloaded 13 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time the public expression of personal values that groups of people find important in their day-to-day lives, lay the foundations of law, custom and tradition. Recent research has thereby stressed the ''implicit nature of value communication''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2368340 Common values? Fifty-Two Cases of Value Semantics Copying on Corporate Websites] by Steffen Roth. Human Systems Management 32(4) (2013): 249â65. {{doi|10.3233/HSM-130801}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer behavior research proposes there are six internal values and three external values. They are known as List of Values (LOV) in management studies. They are self respect, warm relationships, sense of accomplishment, self-fulfillment, fun and enjoyment, excitement, sense of belonging, being well respected, and security. From a functional aspect these values are categorized into three and they are interpersonal relationship area, personal factors, and non-personal factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wayne D. Hoyer|author2=Deborah J. MacInnis|author3=Rik Pieters|title=Consumer Behavior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-mVuCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA395|year=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-285-40286-4|page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an ethnocentric perspective, it could be assumed that a same set of values will not reflect equally between two groups of people from two countries. Though the core values are related, the processing of values can differ based on the cultural identity of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marieke de Mooij|title=Consumer Behavior and Culture: Consequences for Global Marketing and Advertising|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMOmwgs-EQMC&amp;pg=PT40|year=2004|publisher=SAGE Publishers|isbn=978-0-7619-2669-6|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural values ===
[[File:Inglehart Values Map.svg|thumb|300px|The [[InglehartâWelzel cultural map of the world]], constructed by sociopolitical scientists [[Ronald Inglehart]] and [[Christian Welzel]] based on the [[World Values Survey]].]]

Individual [[culture]]s emphasize values which their members broadly share. Values of a [[society]] can often be identified by examining the level of [[honour|honor]] and respect received by various groups and ideas.  In the [[United States of America]], for example, top-level professional athletes receive more respect (measured in terms of monetary payment) than university professors. Another example is that certain voters (taken from surveys){{Citation needed|reason=No surveys have been cited in this statement|date=March 2018}} in the United States would not willingly elect an atheist as president, suggesting that believing in a God is a generally shared value.

'''Values clarification''' differs from '''cognitive [[moral education]]''':

* Value clarification consists of "helping people clarify what their [[personal life|lives]] are for and what is worth working for. It encourages students to define their own values and to understand others' values."&lt;ref name="Santrock"&gt;
Santrock, J.W. (2007). ''A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development''. New York, NY: [[McGraw-Hill]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cognitive moral education builds on the belief that students should learn to value things like [[democracy]] and [[justice]] as their moral reasoning develops.&lt;ref name= "Santrock"/&gt; 
 
Values relate to the [[Norm (social)|norms of a culture]], but they are more global and intellectual than norms.  Norms provide rules for behavior in specific situations, while values identify what should be judged as [[Good and evil|good or evil]]. While norms are standards, patterns, rules and guides of expected behavior, values are abstract concepts of what is important and worthwhile. Flying the national flag on a holiday is a norm, but it reflects the value of [[patriotism]].  Wearing dark clothing and appearing solemn are normative behaviors to manifest [[respect]] at a funeral. Different cultures represent values differently and to different levels of emphasis. "Over the last three decades, traditional-age college students have shown an increased interest in personal well-being and a decreased interest in the welfare of others."&lt;ref name= "Santrock"/&gt; Values seemed to have changed, affecting the beliefs, and attitudes of the students.

Members take part in a culture even if each member's personal values do not entirely agree with some of the normative values sanctioned in that culture. This reflects an individual's ability to synthesize and extract aspects valuable to them from the multiple [[subculture]]s they belong to.

If a group member expresses a value that seriously conflicts with the group's norms, the group's authority may carry out various ways of encouraging [[conformity]] or [[Social stigma|stigmatizing]] the [[Deviance (sociology)|non-conforming behavior]] of that member. For example, imprisonment can result from conflict with social norms that the state has established as law.{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}

Furthermore, institutions in the [[global economy]] can genuinely respect values which are of three kinds based on a "triangle of coherence".&lt;ref&gt;Lamy, Pascal, WTO Director-General, Speech to the European University Institute in Florence on 19 February 2011 (http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/sppl_e/sppl187_e.htm)&lt;/ref&gt; In the first instance, a value may come to expression within the World Trade Organization ([[World Trade Organization|WTO]]), as well as (in the second instance) within the United Nations â particularly in the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) â providing a framework for global legitimacy through accountability. In the third instance, the expertise of member-driven international organizations and civil society depends on the incorporation of flexibility in the rules, to preserve the expression of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] in a [[globalization|globalized world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn R. Kahle, Pierre Valette-Florence|title=Marketplace Lifestyles in an Age of Social Media|year=2012|location=New York|publisher=M.E. Sharpe, Inc.|isbn=978-0-7656-2561-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;.{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}

Nonetheless, in warlike economic competition, differing views may contradict each other, particularly in the field of culture. Thus audiences in Europe may regard a movie as an artistic creation and grant it benefits from special treatment, while audiences in the United States may see it as mere entertainment, whatever its artistic merits. [[European Union|EU]] policies based on the notion of "cultural exception" can become juxtaposed with the policy of "cultural specificity" on the liberal Anglo-Saxon side. Indeed, [[international law]] traditionally treats films as property and the content of television programs as a service.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Consequently, cultural interventionist policies can find themselves opposed to the Anglo-Saxon liberal position, causing failures in international negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;
Hacker, Violaine (2011a), "Building Medias Industry while promoting a community of values in the globalization: from quixotic choices to pragmatic boon for EU Citizens", PolitickÃ© VÃ©dy-Journal of Political Science, Slovakia, pp. 64â74.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and transmission==
Values are generally received through cultural means, especially [[Trans-cultural diffusion|diffusion]] and [[Dual inheritance theory|transmission]] or [[socialization]] from parents to children.  Parents in different cultures have different values.&lt;ref name=Day /&gt; For example, parents in a [[hunterâgatherer]] society or surviving through [[subsistence agriculture]] value practical survival skills from a young age. Many such cultures begin teaching babies to use sharp tools, including knives, before their first birthdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/how_babies_work/2013/04/09/bad_parenting_ideas_that_are_actually_good_for_some_babies.html|title=Give Your Baby a Machete|last=Day|first=Nicholas|date=9 April 2013|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian parents value social and emotional abilities and having an even temperament.&lt;ref name=Day /&gt; Spanish parents want their children to be sociable.&lt;ref name=Day /&gt; Swedish parents value security and happiness.&lt;ref name=Day /&gt; Dutch parents value independence, long attention spans, and predictable schedules.&lt;ref name=Day /&gt; American parents are unusual for strongly valuing intellectual ability, especially in a narrow "book learning" sense.&lt;ref name=Day /&gt; The [[Kipsigis people]] of Kenya value children who are not only smart, but who employ that intelligence in a responsible and helpful way, which they call ''ng'om''. Luos of Kenya value education and pride which they call "nyadhi".&lt;ref name=Day&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/how_babies_work/2013/04/10/parental_ethnotheories_and_how_parents_in_america_differ_from_parents_everywhere.html |title=Parental ethnotheories and how parents in America differ from parents everywhere else. |last=Day|first=Nicholas |date=10 April 2013 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors that influence the development of cultural values are summarized below.

The [[InglehartâWelzel cultural map of the world]] is a two-dimensional [[InglehartâWelzel cultural map of the world|cultural map]] showing the cultural values of the countries of the world along two dimensions: The ''traditional versus secular-rational values'' reflect the transition from a religious understanding of the world to a dominance of science and bureaucracy. The second dimension named ''survival values versus self-expression values'' represents the transition from industrial society to post-industrial society.&lt;ref name=wvs-old&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_54 |title=The WVS Cultural Map of the World |publisher=WVS |author1=Ronald Inglehart |author2=Chris Welzel |accessdate=6 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019112321/http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_54 |archivedate=October 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in [[evolutionary psychology]] have led to similar findings. The so-called regality theory finds that war and other perceived collective dangers have a profound influence on both the psychology of individuals and on the social structure and cultural values. A dangerous environment leads to a hierarchical, authoritarian, and warlike culture, while a safe and peaceful environment fosters an egalitarian and tolerant culture.&lt;ref name=Fog2017&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fog |first1=Agner |date=2017 |title=Warlike and Peaceful Societies: The Interaction of Genes and Culture |url=https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/657 |publisher=Open Book Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties and forms==

===Relative or absolute===
[[Relativism|Relative]] values differ between people, and on a larger scale, between people of different cultures. On the other hand, there are theories of the existence of ''absolute values'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minerva.mic.ul.ie/Vol%2015/Wittgenstein.pdf On Wittgenstein's Claim That Ethical Value Judgments Are Nonsense] by Arto Tukiainen. Minerva â An Internet Journal of Philosophy 15 (2011): 102â11. {{ISSN|1393-614X}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can also be termed ''[[noumenal]] values'' (and not to be confused with mathematical [[absolute value]]). An absolute value can be described as [[Absolute (philosophy)|philosophically absolute]] and independent of individual and cultural views, as well as independent of whether it is known or apprehended or not. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] was pessimistic towards the idea that an elucidation would ever happen regarding the absolute values of actions or objects; ''"we can speak as much as we want about "life" and "[[meaning of life|its meaning]]," and believe that what we say is important. But these are no more than expressions and can never be facts, resulting from a tendency of the mind and not the heart or the will".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wittgenstein's Ethical Thought|author=Yaniv Iczkovits|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2012|isbn=9781137026354|page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=WCIwY41bB1kC&amp;pg=PA46  46]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intrinsic or extrinsic===
Philosophic value may be split into ''[[instrumental value]]'' and ''[[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]]s''. An instrumental value is worth having as a means towards getting something else that is good (e.g., a radio is instrumentally good in order to hear music). An intrinsically valuable thing is worth for itself, not as a means to something else. It is giving value [[intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|intrinsic and extrinsic properties]].

An ''ethic good'' with ''instrumental value'' may be termed an [[ethic mean]], and an ''ethic good'' with ''intrinsic value'' may be termed an [[end-in-itself]]. An object may be both a mean and end-in-itself.

====Summation====
Intrinsic and instrumental goods are not mutually exclusive categories.&lt;ref name=riukas&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Valu/ValuRiuk.htm Inherent and Instrumental Values in Ethics] by Stanley Riukas&lt;/ref&gt; Some objects are both good in themselves, and also good for getting other objects that are good. "Understanding science" may be such a good, being both worthwhile in and of itself, and as a means of achieving other goods. In these cases, the [[Summation|sum]] of instrumental (specifically the [[all instrumental value]]) and intrinsic value of an object may be used when putting that object in [[value system]]s, which is a set of consistent values and measures.

===Intensity===
The ''intensity'' of philosophic value is the degree it is generated or carried out, and may be regarded as the prevalence of the good, the object having the value.&lt;ref name=riukas/&gt;

It should not be confused with the amount of value per object, although the latter may vary too, e.g. because of [[instrumental value conditionality]]. For example, taking a fictional life-stance of accepting waffle-eating as being the end-in-itself, the intensity may be the speed that waffles are eaten, and is zero when no waffles are eaten, e.g. if no waffles are present. Still, each waffle that had been present would still have value, no matter if it was being eaten or not, independent on intensity.

''Instrumental value conditionality'' in this case could be exampled by every waffle not present, making them less valued by being far away rather than easily accessible.

In many [[life stances]] it is the product of value and intensity that is ultimately desirable, i.e. not only to generate value, but to generate it in large degree. [[maximization (ethics)|Maximizing]] lifestances have the highest possible intensity as an imperative.

===Positive and negative value===
There may be a distinction between positive and negative philosophic or ethic value. While positive ethic value generally correlates with something that is pursued or maximized,  negative ethic value correlates with something that is avoided or minimized.

Negative value may be both [[intrinsic negative value]] and/or [[instrumental negative value]].

===Protected value===
A ''protected value'' (also [[sacred]] value) is one that an individual is unwilling to trade off no matter what the benefits of doing so may be. For example, some people may be unwilling to kill another person, even if it means saving many others individuals. Protected values tend to be "intrinsically good", and most people can in fact imagine a scenario when trading off their most precious values would be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ritov, and  Baron|first=Ilana, and Jonathan|title=Protected Values and Omission Bias|location=University of Jerusalem, University of Pennsilvanya|pages=89, 90|url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~baron/papers/pvom.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; If such trade-offs happen between two competing protected values such as killing a person and defending your family they are called ''tragic trade-offs.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tetlock|first=Philip E.|title=Thinking the unthinkable: sacred values and taboo cognitions|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00135-9|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=7|issue=7|pages=320â24|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(03)00135-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protected values have been found to be play a role in protracted conflicts (e.g., the [[IsraeliâPalestinian conflict|Israeli-Palestinian conflict]]) because they can hinder businesslike (&lt;nowiki&gt;''utilitarian''&lt;/nowiki&gt;) negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atran|first=Scott|last2=Ginges|first2=Jeremy|date=2012-05-18|title=Religious and Sacred Imperatives in Human Conflict|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/336/6083/855|journal=Science|language=en|volume=336|issue=6083|pages=855â57|doi=10.1126/science.1216902|issn=0036-8075|pmid=22605762}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of experimental studies directed by [[Scott Atran]] and Ãngel GÃ³mez among combatants on the [[ISIS]] frontline in Iraq and with ordinary  citizens in Western Europe &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0193-3 |title=The devoted actorâs will to fight and the spiritual dimension of human conflict |journal=Nature Human Behaviour |year=2017 |volume=1 |doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0193-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that commitment to sacred values motivate the most "devoted actors" to make the costliest sacrifices, including willingness to fight and die, as well as a readiness to forsake close kin and comrades for those values if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hutson |first=Mathew |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/why-do-people-die-fighting-cause |title=Why do people die fighting for a cause? |work=Science  |date=September 5, 2017 |accessdate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of [[utilitarianism]], protected values are [[bias]]es when they prevent utility from being maximized across individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baron, Jonathan|first=Ilana, Ritov|title=Protected Values and omissions Bias as Deontological Judgements|year=2009|publisher=Elsevier Inc.|pages=134â35|url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~baron/papers/plm.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jonathan Baron]] and Mark Spranca,&lt;ref&gt;Baron, Jonathan and Spranca, Mark (1997). "Protected values". ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes''. '''70'''(1), 1â16.&lt;/ref&gt; protected values arise from [[norm (philosophy)|norm]]s as described in theories of [[deontological ethics]] (the latter often being referred to in context with [[Immanuel Kant]]). The protectedness implies that people are concerned with their participation in transactions rather than just the consequences of it.

==Value system==
A ''value system'' is a set of [[consistent]] values used for the purpose of [[ethical]] or [[ideological]] [[integrity]].

===Consistency===
As a member of a society, group or community, an individual can hold both a personal value system and a communal value system at the same time. In this case, the two value systems (one personal and one communal) are '''externally [[Consistency|consistent]]''' provided they bear no contradictions or situational exceptions between them.

A value system in its own right is '''internally consistent''' when
* its values ''do not contradict'' each other and
* its exceptions are or could be
** ''abstract'' enough to be used in all situations and
** ''consistently'' applied.

Conversely, a value system by itself is '''internally inconsistent''' if:
* its values ''contradict'' each other and
* its exceptions are
** highly ''situational'' and
** ''inconsistently'' applied.

===Value exceptions===
'''Abstract''' exceptions serve to reinforce the ranking of values. Their definitions are generalized enough to be relevant to any and all situations. '''Situational''' exceptions, on the other hand, are ad hoc and pertain only to specific situations. The presence of a type of exception determines one of two more kinds of value systems:
* An '''idealized''' value system is a listing of values that lacks exceptions. It is, therefore, absolute and can be codified as a strict set of proscriptions on behavior. Those who hold to their idealized value system and claim no exceptions (other than the default) are called ''absolutists''.
* A '''realized''' value system contains exceptions to resolve contradictions between values in practical circumstances. This type is what people tend to use in daily life.

The difference between these two types of systems can be seen when people state that they hold one value system yet in practice deviate from it, thus holding a different value system. For example, a [[religion]] lists an absolute set of values while the practice of that religion may include exceptions.

Implicit exceptions bring about a third type of value system called a '''formal''' value system. Whether idealized or realized, this type contains an implicit exception associated with each value: "as long as no higher-priority value is violated". For instance, a person might feel that lying is wrong. Since preserving a life is probably more highly valued than adhering to the principle that lying is wrong, lying to save someoneâs life is acceptable. Perhaps too simplistic in practice, such a hierarchical structure may warrant explicit exceptions.

===Conflict===
Although sharing a set of common values, like hockey is better than baseball or ice cream is better than fruit, two different parties might not rank those values equally. Also, two parties might disagree as to certain actions are [[Right (ethics)|right]] or [[wrongdoing|wrong]], both in theory and in practice, and find themselves in an [[ideological]] or physical conflict. [[Ethonomics]], the discipline of rigorously examining and comparing value systems{{Citation needed|reason=No citation for this as the true definition|date=June 2017}}, enables us to understand [[politics]] and motivations more fully in order to resolve conflicts.

An example conflict would be a value system based on [[individualism]] pitted against a value system based on [[collectivism]]. A rational value system organized to resolve the conflict between two such value systems might take the form below. Note that added exceptions can become [[recursion|recursive]] and often convoluted.
* ''Individuals may act freely unless their actions harm others or interfere with others' freedom or with functions of society that individuals need, provided those functions do not themselves interfere with these proscribed individual rights and were agreed to by a majority of the individuals.''
* ''A society (or more specifically the system of order that enables the workings of a society) exists for the purpose of benefiting the lives of the individuals who are members of that society. The functions of a society in providing such benefits would be those agreed to by the majority of individuals in the society.''
* ''A society may require contributions from its members in order for them to benefit from the services provided by the society. The failure of individuals to make such required contributions could be considered a reason to deny those benefits to them, although a society could elect to consider hardship situations in determining how much should be contributed.''
* ''A society may restrict behavior of individuals who are members of the society only for the purpose of performing its designated functions agreed to by the majority of individuals in the society, only insofar as they violate the aforementioned values. This means that a society may abrogate the rights of any of its members who fails to uphold the aforementioned values.''

==Economic and philosophic value==
{{Further|Value (economics)}}
Philosophical value is distinguished from [[economic value]], since it is independent on some other desired condition or commodity. The economic value of an object may rise when the exchangeable desired condition or commodity, e.g. money, become high in supply, and vice versa when supply of money becomes low.

Nevertheless, economic value may be regarded as a result of philosophical value. In the [[subjective theory of value]], the [[personal philosophic value]] a person puts in possessing something is reflected in what economic value this person puts on it. The limit where a person considers to purchase something may be regarded as the point where the ''personal philosophic value'' of possessing something exceeds the personal philosophic value of what is given up in exchange for it, e.g. money. In this light, everything can be said to have a "personal economic value" in contrast to its "societal economic value."

'''Walter of Bruges''' (Gualterus Brugensis OFM, Gualterus de Brugge, Gauthier de Bruges OM, Gualterus de Brugis, Gualterus de BrÃ¼ge, Walter von BrÃ¼gge) was a [[Franciscan]] [[theologian]], who flourished at the [[University of Paris]] 1267-9.

==Life==

He entered the Franciscans in [[Bruges]] in about 1240 and was sent to Paris for his studies. A student of [[Bonaventure]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cullen |first = Christopher M. | title = Bonaventure| location =[[Oxford]] |publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | pages = 20 | year = 2006| url = https://books.google.com/?id=JC7S450oXJEC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=%22Walter+of+Bruges%22 | isbn = 978-0-19-514926-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was [[regent master]] at Paris from 1267 to 1269. He was elected minister provincial of the French province in 1269, then became [[bishop]] of [[Poitiers]] in 1279, a post which he held until 1306, when he retired because of ill health. He died the following year.

His family name was probably Van den Zande.  He wrote ''Sermones per totum annum'' and ''Excerpta ex sanctis Patribus'' (Augustine, Gregory, Jerome, Ambrose, Hilary, Isadore and others)&lt;ref&gt;Zawart 1928&lt;/ref&gt; but was not widely known until the publication of ''Quaestiones Disputatae''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Callus|first= Daniel M.|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1933|month= |title= Some recent medieval studies|journal= New Blackfriars|volume= 14|issue= 163|pages= 824â832 |id= |url= http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119898735/PDFSTART|accessdate=2008-11-09 |quote= |doi= 10.1111/j.1741-2005.1933.tb05500.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; With Bonaventure, he was a teacher of [[Matthew of Aquasparta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/fra/FRAtho02.html | title = 10. Franciscan Schools of thought (2) | accessdate = 2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
As a follower of [[Bonaventure]], Walter accepted that the existence of God is "the first truth" and therefore could not be proved ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Craig|first = Edward| title = Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy | year = 1998| publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis| pages = 201 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=G3UBxqkkCX8C&amp;pg=PA201&amp;lpg=PA201&amp;dq=%22Walter+of+Bruges%22 | isbn = 978-0-415-07310-3|accessdate = 2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school of which he formed part differed from [[Thomas Aquinas]], who held that God's existence can be proved ''a posteriori'' but not ''a priori'' (see ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', I, 2, 1 and I, 2, 3), but contended that ''being'' itself was the first object of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hirschberger | first = Johannes | title = A Short History of Western Philosophy | pages = 73 | year = 1976 | publisher = Lutterworth Press | isbn = 0-7188-2197-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wilhelm Reich''' ({{IPAc-en|r|aÉª|x}}; {{IPA-de|ÊaÉªÃ§|lang}}; 24 March 1897&amp;nbsp;â 3 November 1957) was an Austrian [[Doctor of Medicine|doctor of medicine]] and  [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]], a member of the second generation of analysts after [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref&gt;Danto 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lq8rwc61ae4C&amp;pg=PA43 43].&lt;/ref&gt; The author of several influential books, most notably ''[[Character Analysis]]''&amp;nbsp;(1933), ''[[The Mass Psychology of Fascism]]''&amp;nbsp;(1933), and ''[[The Sexual Revolution]]''&amp;nbsp;(1936), Reich became known as one of the most radical figures in the history of psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;For radicalism, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,907256-1,00.html Sheppard (''Time'' magazine) 1973]; Danto 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lq8rwc61ae4C&amp;pg=PA43 43]; Turner 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;114.{{pb}}

Richard Sterba (psychoanalyst), 1982: "This book [''Character Analysis''] serves even today as an excellent introduction to psychoanalytic technique.

Reich's work on character contributed to the development of [[Anna Freud]]'s ''The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence'' (1936), and his idea of muscular armourâthe expression of the personality in the way the body movesâshaped innovations such as [[body psychotherapy]], [[Gestalt therapy]], [[bioenergetic analysis]] and [[primal therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;For Anna Freud: Bugental, Schneider and Pierson 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jtO7czidPeYC&amp;pg=PA14 14], and Sterba 1982, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uaFaiUZsFD4C&amp;pg=PA35 35].{{pb}}

After graduating in medicine from the [[University of Vienna]] in 1922, Reich became deputy director of [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s outpatient clinic, the Vienna Ambulatorium.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ddlMl4jJgh0C&amp;pg=PA66 66]; Danto 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lq8rwc61ae4C&amp;pg=PA83 83].&lt;/ref&gt; Described by [[Elizabeth Danto]] as a large man with a cantankerous style who managed to look scruffy and elegant at the same time, he tried to reconcile psychoanalysis with [[Marxism]], arguing that [[neurosis]] is rooted in sexual and socio-economic conditions, and in particular in a lack of what he called "[[orgastic potency]]". He visited patients in their homes to see how they lived, and took to the streets in a mobile clinic, promoting adolescent sexuality and the availability of contraceptives, abortion and divorce, a provocative message in Catholic Austria.&lt;ref&gt;For Danto's description of Reich, Danto 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lq8rwc61ae4C&amp;pg=PA118 118].{{pb}}

From the 1930s he became an increasingly controversial figure, and from 1932 until his death in 1957 all his work was self-published.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ddlMl4jJgh0C&amp;pg=PA169 169].&lt;/ref&gt; His message of sexual liberation disturbed the psychoanalytic community and his political associates, and his [[vegetotherapy]], in which he massaged his disrobed patients to dissolve their "muscular armour", violated the key taboos of psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;234â235; Danto 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lq8rwc61ae4C&amp;pg=PA120 120].&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to New York in 1939, in part to escape the Nazis, and shortly after arriving coined the term "[[orgone]]"âfrom "orgasm" and "organism"âfor a biological energy he said he had discovered, which he said others called God. In 1940 he started building orgone accumulators, devices that his patients sat inside to harness the reputed health benefits, leading to newspaper stories about sex boxes that cured cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ddlMl4jJgh0C&amp;pg=PA301 301â306]; that Reich said God was the spiritual aspect of orgone and the ether the physical, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ddlMl4jJgh0C&amp;pg=PA472 472]; Reich, ''Ether, God and Devil'', 1949, pp.&amp;nbsp;39ff, 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following two critical articles about him in ''[[The New Republic]]'' and ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'' in 1947, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] obtained an injunction against the interstate shipment of orgone accumulators and associated literature, believing they were dealing with a "fraud of the first magnitude".&lt;ref&gt;For the articles, [http://www.harpers.org/archive/1947/04/0032908 Brady, April 1947]; [https://www.webcitation.org/68E1awEUD?url=http://cyberquebec.ca/libresarchiveswilhelmreich/strange_case_of_wilhelm_reich.pdf Brady, 26 May 1947].

==Early life==
===Childhood===
[[File:Wilhelm Reich in 1900.jpg|thumb|alt=monochrome photograph of a child with a rocking horse|Reich in 1900]]
Reich was born the first of two sons to Leon Reich, a farmer, and his wife CÃ¤cilie (nÃ©e Roniger) in [[Dobrianychi|Dobzau]], [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], then part of [[Austria-Hungary]], now in [[Ukraine]]. There was a sister too, born one year after Reich, but she died in infancy. Shortly after his birth the family moved to [[Yuzhynets'|Jujinetz]], a village in [[Bukovina]], where his father ran a cattle farm leased by his mother's uncle, Josef Blum.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;36.&lt;/ref&gt;

His father was by all accounts a cold and jealous man.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;37.&lt;/ref&gt; Both parents were Jewish, but decided against raising the boys as Jews. Reich and his brother, Robert, were brought up to speak only German, were punished for using [[Yiddish]] expressions and forbidden from playing with the local Yiddish-speaking children.&lt;ref name=Sharaf463&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;39, 463; Corrington 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;90â91; Reich, ''Passion of Youth'', p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an adult Reich wrote extensively, in his diary, about his sexual precocity. He maintained that his first sexual experience was at the age of four when he tried to have sex with the family maid (with whom he shared a bed), that he would regularly watch the farm animals have sex, that he used a whip handle sexually on the horses while masturbating, and that he had almost daily sexual intercourse from the age of 11 with another of the servants. He wrote of regular visits to brothels, the first when he was 15, and said he was visiting them daily from the age of around 17. He also developed sexual fantasies about his mother, writing when he was 22 that he masturbated while thinking about her.&lt;ref&gt;Corrington 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;5, 22; Reich, ''Passion of Youth'', pp.&amp;nbsp;6, 22, 25, 42, 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is impossible to judge the truth of these diary entries, but Reich's second daughter, the psychiatrist Lore Reich Rubin, told  [[Christopher Turner]] that she believed Reich had been a victim of [[child sexual abuse]], and that this explained his lifelong interest in sex and childhood sexuality.&lt;ref name=Turner2011p323/&gt;

===Death of parents===
Reich was taught at home until he was 12, when his mother was discovered having an affair with his live-in tutor. Reich wrote about the affair in 1920 in his first published paper, "Ãber einen Fall von Durchbruch der Inzestschranke" ("About a Case of Breaching the Incest Taboo"), presented in the third person as though about a patient.&lt;ref name=Inzestschranke/&gt; He wrote that he would follow his mother when she went to the tutor's bedroom at night, feeling ashamed and jealous, and wondering if they would kill him if they found out that he knew. He briefly thought of forcing her to have sex with him, on pain of threatening to tell his father. In the end, he did tell his father, and after a protracted period of beatings, his mother committed suicide in 1910, for which Reich blamed himself.&lt;ref name=Inzestschranke&gt;Turner 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;42â43; Corrington 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;6â10; Sharaf 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;42â46; Reich, ''Passion of Youth'', pp.&amp;nbsp;31â38; Reich, "Ãber einen Fall von Durchbruch der Inzestschranke", ''Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Sexualwissenschaft'', VII, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the tutor ordered out of the house, Reich was sent to an all-male [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Czernowitz]]. It was during this period that a skin condition appeared, diagnosed as [[psoriasis]], that plagued him for the rest of his life, leading several commentators to remark on his ruddy complexion. He visited brothels every day and wrote in his diary of his disgust for the women.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;47â48; Reich, ''Passion of Youth'', pp.&amp;nbsp;46â47.&lt;/ref&gt; His father died of [[tuberculosis]] in 1914, and because of rampant inflation the father's insurance was worthless, so no money was forthcoming for the brothers.&lt;ref name=Sharaf47&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;47â48; Turner 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;47â48; Reich, ''Passion of Youth'', p.&amp;nbsp;50.&lt;/ref&gt; Reich managed the farm and continued with his studies, graduating in 1915 with  '' Stimmeneinhelligkeit'' (unanimous approval). The Russians invaded Bukovina that summer and the Reich brothers fled, losing everything. Reich wrote in his diary: "I never saw either my homeland or my possessions again. Of a well-to-do past, nothing was left."&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;50; Reich, ''Passion of Youth'', p.&amp;nbsp;58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1919â1930: Vienna==
===Undergraduate studies===
Reich joined the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] during the First World War, serving from 1915 to 1918, for the last two years as a lieutenant at the Italian front with 40 men under his command. When the war ended he headed for Vienna, enrolling in law at the [[University of Vienna]], but found it dull and switched to medicine after the first semester. He arrived with nothing in a city with little to offer; the overthrow of the Austria-Hungarian empire a few weeks earlier had left the newly formed [[Republic of German-Austria]] in the grip of famine. Reich lived on soup, oats and dried fruit from the university canteen, and shared an unheated room with his brother and another undergraduate, wearing his coat and gloves indoors to stave off the cold. He fell in love with another medical student, Lia Laszky, with whom he was dissecting a corpse, but it was largely unrequited.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;23â26, 31â32, 34â35.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Myron Sharaf]], his biographer, wrote that Reich loved medicine but was caught between a [[Reductionism|reductionist]]/[[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] and [[Vitalism|vitalist]]  view of the world.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p54&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;54â55.&lt;/ref&gt; Reich wrote later of this period:

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:5em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 3px #ccc; padding:1.5em;"&gt;
The question, "What is Life?" lay behind everything I learned.&amp;nbsp; ... It became clear that the mechanistic concept of life, which dominated our study of medicine at the time, was unsatisfactory&amp;nbsp; ... There was no denying the principle of creative power governing life; only it was not satisfactory as long as it was not tangible, as long as it could not be described or practically handled. For, rightly, this was considered the supreme goal of natural science.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p54/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Introduction to Freud===
[[File:Sigmund Freud, by Max Halberstadt (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=photograph of a balding man with a beard; holding a cigar and wearing a suit|[[Sigmund Freud]]]]

Reich first met [[Sigmund Freud]] in 1919 when he asked Freud for a reading list for a seminar concerning [[sexology]]. It seems they left a strong impression on each other. Freud allowed him to start meeting with analytic patients in September that year, although Reich was just 22 years old and still an undergraduate, which gave him a small income. He was accepted as a guest member of the [[Vienna Psychoanalytic Association]], becoming a regular member in October 1920, and began his own analysis with [[Isidor Isaak Sadger|Isidor Sadger]]. He lived and worked out of an apartment on Berggasse 7, the street on which Freud lived at no. 19, in the [[Alsergrund]] area of Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;18â19, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Reich's first patients was Lore Kahn, a 19-year-old woman with whom he had an affair. Freud had warned analysts not to involve themselves with their patients, but in the early days of psychoanalysis the warnings went unheeded. According to Reich's diaries, Kahn became ill in November 1920 and died of [[sepsis]] after sleeping in a bitterly cold room she had rented as a place for her and Reich to meet (both his landlady and her parents had forbidden their meetings). Kahn's mother suspected that her daughter had died after a botched illegal abortion, possibly performed by Reich himself. According to [[Christopher Turner]], she found some of her daughter's bloodied underwear in a cupboard.&lt;ref name=Turner2011p55/&gt;

It was a serious allegation to make against a physician. Reich wrote in his diary that the mother had been attracted to him and had made the allegation to damage him. She later committed suicide and Reich blamed himself.&lt;ref name=Turner2011p55&gt;Turner 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;55â57; Corrington 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;23â25; Reich, ''Passion of Youth'', pp.&amp;nbsp;125â126.&lt;/ref&gt; If Kahn did have an abortion, Turner wrote, she was the first of four of Reich's partners to do so: Annie, his first wife, had several, and his long-term partners Elsa Lindenberg and Ilse Ollendorf (his second wife) each had one (supposedly) at Reich's insistence.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First marriage, graduation===
Two months after Kahn's death, Reich accepted her friend, [[Annie Reich|Annie Pink]] (1902â1971), as an analysand. Pink was Reich's fourth female patient, a medical student three months shy of her 19th birthday. He had an affair with her too, and married her in March 1922 at her father's insistence, with psychoanalysts [[Otto Fenichel]] and Edith Buxbaum as witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;57â59.&lt;/ref&gt; [[:de:Annie Reich|Annie Reich]]  became a well-known psychoanalyst herself. The marriage produced two daughters, [[:de:Eva Reich|Eva]] (1924â2008) and Lore (b. 1928), both of whom became physicians; Lore Reich Rubin also became a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;108â109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because he was a war veteran, Reich was allowed to complete a combined bachelor's and [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] in four years, instead of six, and graduated in July 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Strick 2015, p.&amp;nbsp;1; Turner 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;59.&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating, he worked in internal medicine at the city's University Hospital, and studied  [[neuropsychiatry]] from 1922 to 1924 at the hospital's neurological and psychiatric clinic under Professor [[Julius Wagner-Jauregg|Julius Wagner von Jauregg]], who won the [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] in 1927.&lt;ref name="Sharaf 1994, p. 67"&gt;Sharaf 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vienna Ambulatorium===

Eduard Hitschmann is seated fourth from the left, Reich fifth, and [[Annie Reich]] first on the right.]]

In 1922 Reich began working in Freud's psychoanalytic outpatient clinic, known as the Vienna Ambulatorium, which was opened on 22 May that year at Pelikangasse 18 by [[:de:Eduard Hitschmann|Eduard Hitschmann]]. Reich became the assistant director under Hitschmann in 1924 and worked there until his move to Berlin in 1930.&lt;ref name=Danto2007p138&gt;Danto 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1922 and 1932 the clinic offered free or reduced-cost psychoanalysis to 1,445 men and 800 women, many suffering from [[shell shock]] after World War I. It was the second such clinic to open under Freud's direction; the first was the Poliklinik in Berlin, set up in 1920 by  [[Max Eitingon]] and [[Ernst Simmel]].&lt;ref&gt;Danto 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;2, 90â93, 241; [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v27/n19/christopher-turner/naughty-children Turner (''London Review of Books''), 6 October 2005]; [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9651752 Danto 1998].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--"On the Energy of Drives"--&gt;

Sharaf writes that working with labourers, farmers and students allowed Reich to move away from treating neurotic symptoms to observing chaotic lifestyles and anti-social personalities.&lt;ref name="Sharaf 1994, p. 67"/&gt; Reich argued that neurotic symptoms such as [[obsessiveâcompulsive disorder]] were an unconscious attempt to gain control of a hostile environment, including poverty or childhood abuse. They were examples of what he called "character armour" (''Charakterpanzer''), repetitive patterns of behaviour, speech and body posture that served as defence mechanisms. According to Danto, Reich sought out patients at the Ambulatorium who had been diagnosed as psychopaths, believing that psychoanalysis could free them of their rage.&lt;ref&gt;Danto 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;137. For character armour, Yontef and Jacobs 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;348.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reich joined the faculty of the Psychoanalytic Institute in Vienna in 1924 and became its director of training.&lt;ref name=Blumenfeld135&gt;Blumenfeld 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UwK5SmQImBoC&amp;pg=PA135 135].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Danto, he was well-regarded for the weekly technical seminars he chaired at the Ambulatorium, where he gave papers on his theory of character structure, arguing that psychoanalysis should be based on the examination of unconscious character traits, later known as [[Defence mechanisms|ego defences]].&lt;ref name=Danto137&gt;Danto 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;137.&lt;/ref&gt; The seminars were attended, from 1927, by [[Fritz Perls]], who went on to develop  [[Gestalt therapy]] with his wife, [[Laura Perls]].&lt;ref&gt;Bocian 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;205ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Several commentators remarked on how captivating the seminars were and how eloquently Reich spoke. According to a Danish newspaper in 1934:

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:5em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 3px #ccc; padding:1.5em;"&gt;
The moment he starts to speak, not at the lectern, but walking around it on cat's paws, he is simply enchanting. In the Middle Ages, this man would have been sent into exile. He is not only eloquent, he also keeps his listeners spellbound by his sparking personality, reflected in his small, dark eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Der triebhafte Charakter''===
Reich's first book, ''{{lang|de|Der triebhafte Charakter: eine psychoanalytische Studie zur Pathologie des Ich}}'' ("The Impulsive Character: A Psychoanalytic Study of the Pathology of the Self"), was published in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Reich, [https://archive.org/stream/DerTriebhafteCharakter/4_Reich_1925_Der_Triebhafte_Charakter#page/n0/mode/2up ''Der triebhafte Charakter''], 1925.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a study of the anti-social personalities he had encountered in the Ambulatorium, and argued the need for a systematic theory of character.&lt;ref&gt;Danto 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;125.&lt;/ref&gt; The book won him professional recognition, including from Freud, who in 1927 arranged for his appointment to the executive committee of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;84.&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment was made over the objection of [[Paul Federn]], who had been Reich's second analyst in 1922 and who, according to Sharaf, regarded Reich as a psychopath.{{refn|group=n|[[Myron Sharaf]], 1994: Sharaf writes about Sandor Rado's diagnosis of an "insidious psychotic process" that Reich's personality and views were seen as "dangerous", that Federn regarded Reich as a "psychopath", and that Annie Reich and Otto Fenichel concurred.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ddlMl4jJgh0C&amp;pg=PA194 194].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[[Christopher Turner]], 2011: "Paul Federn, who had lobbied to exclude Reich from the executive committee since the late twenties, now went so far as to label him a psychopath who slept with all his female patients. 'Either Reich goes or I go,' he said. [Sandor] Rado, who in 1930 had described Reich as suffering from a 'mild paranoid tendency', now claimed to have observed signs of an 'insidious psychotic process' at that time, and Federn also later maintained he had detected 'incipient schizophrenia' during his analysis of Reich."&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;167.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Reich found the society dull and wrote that he behaved "like a shark in a pond of carps".&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ddlMl4jJgh0C&amp;pg=PA73 73].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orgastic potency===
{{further|Orgastic potency}}
[[File:Berggasse Freud Museum 01 (lighter).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=|Reich lived for a time on Berggasse in Vienna (seen here in 2010), where Freud lived at number&amp;nbsp;19]]

Beginning in 1924 Reich published a series of papers on the idea of "orgastic potency", the ability to release the emotions from the muscles and lose the self in an uninhibited orgasm, an idea that Freud came to call Reich's "''Steckenpferd''" (hobby horse).&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;91; for "Steckenpferd", Danto 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;138.&lt;/ref&gt; Reich argued that psychic health and the ability to love depended on orgastic potency, the full discharge of the libido: "Sexual release in the sex act must correspond to the excitement which leads up to it."&lt;ref&gt;Strick 2015, p.&amp;nbsp;11.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: "It is not just to fuck&amp;nbsp; ... not the embrace in itself, not the intercourse. It is the real emotional experience of the loss of your ego, of your whole spiritual self."&lt;ref&gt;Reich, ''Reich Speaks of Freud'', p.&amp;nbsp;24, quoted in Turner 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;80.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that orgastic potency was the goal of character analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;178â179. For Reich's view that psychic health depends on orgastic potency, Reich, ''The Function of the Orgasm'', p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas Reich's work on character was well received by the psychoanalytic community, Sharaf writes, his work on orgastic potency was unpopular from the start and later ridiculed. He came to be known as the "prophet of the better orgasm" and the "founder of a genital utopia".&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ddlMl4jJgh0C&amp;pg=PR86 86].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rest cure in Switzerland===
Reich's brother died of tuberculosis (TB) in 1926, the same disease that had killed their father. Turner writes that a quarter of deaths in Vienna were caused by TB in the 1920s. Reich himself contracted it in 1927 and spent several weeks in the winter of that year in a sanitorium in Davos, Switzerland, where TB patients went for rest cures and fresh air before antibiotics became widely available around 1945. Turner writes that Reich underwent a political and existential crisis in Davos; he returned home in the spring angry and paranoid, according to Annie Reich. Some months later he and Annie were on the streets during the [[July Revolt of 1927]] in Vienna, when 84 workers were shot and killed by police and another 600 were injured. It seems that the experience changed Reich; he wrote that it was his first encounter with human irrationality.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, pp. 87â88, 103â108; Corrington 2003, pp. 96â97.&lt;/ref&gt; He began to doubt everything, and in 1928 joined the [[Communist Party of Austria]]:

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:5em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 3px #ccc; padding:1.5em;"&gt;
As if struck by a blow, one suddenly recognizes the scientific futility, the biological senselessness, and the social noxiousness of views and institutions, which until that moment had seemed altogether natural and self-evident. It is a kind of eschatological experience so frequently encountered in a pathological form in schizophrenics. I might even voice the belief that the schizophrenic form of psychic illness is regularly accompanied by illuminating insight into the irrationalism of social and political mores.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, p. 108, quoting Reich, ''People in Trouble'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sex-pol movement===
Partly in response to the shooting he had witnessed in Vienna, Reich, then 30, opened six free sex-counselling clinics in the city in 1927 for working-class patients. Each clinic was overseen by a physician, with three obstetricians and a lawyer on call, and offered what Reich called Sex-Pol counselling. Sex-Pol stood for the German Society of Proletarian Sexual Politics. Reich offered a mixture of "psychoanalytic counseling, Marxist advice and contraceptives", Danto writes, and argued for a sexual permissiveness, including for young people and the unmarried, that unsettled other psychoanalysts and the political left. The clinics were immediately overcrowded by people seeking help.&lt;ref&gt;Danto 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;118â120, 137, 198, 208; Sharaf 1994, p. 129ff; [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/01/sex-pol-essays-reich-review Turner (''Guardian'') 2013].&lt;/ref&gt;

He also took to the streets in a mobile clinic, driving to parks and out to the suburbs with other psychoanalysts and physicians. Reich would talk to the teenagers and men, while a gynaecologist fitted the women with contraceptive devices, and Lia Laszky, the woman Reich fell in love with at medical school, spoke to the children. They also distributed sex-education pamphlets door to door.&lt;ref&gt;Danto 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;115â116.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Die Funktion des Orgasmus''===
{{further|Die Funktion des Orgasmus}}
Reich published ''Die Funktion des Orgasmus'' ("The Function of the Orgasm") in 1927, dedicating it to Freud. He had presented a copy of the manuscript to Freud on the latter's 70th birthday on 6 May 1926.&lt;ref name=Sharaf91&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp. 91â92, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud had not appeared impressed. He replied, "That thick?" when Reich handed it to him, and took two months to write a brief but positive letter in response, which Reich interpreted as a rejection.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p100&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp. 100â101.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Freud's letter read: "Dear Dr. Reich, I took plenty of time, but finally I did read the manuscript which you dedicated to me for my anniversary. I find the book valuable, rich in observation and thought. As you know, I am in no way opposed to your attempt to solve the problem of neurasthenia by explaining it on the basis of the absence of genital primacy."&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p100/&gt;}} Freud's view was that the matter was more complicated than Reich suggested, and that there was no single cause of neurosis.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in 1928 to another psychoanalyst, Dr. [[Lou Andreas-SalomÃ©]]:

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:5em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 3px #ccc; padding:1.5em;"&gt;
We have here a Dr. Reich, a worthy but impetuous young man, passionately devoted to his hobby-horse, who now salutes in the genital orgasm the antidote to every neurosis. Perhaps he might learn from your analysis of K. to feel some respect for the complicated nature of the psyche.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=ipl.089.0174a "Freud to Lou Andreas-SalomÃ©, May 9, 1928"], The International Psycho-analytical Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Visit to Soviet Union===
In 1929 Reich and his wife visited the Soviet Union on a lecture tour, leaving the two children in the care of the psychoanalyst Berta Bornstein. Sharaf writes that he returned even more convinced of the link between sexual and economic oppression, and of the need to integrate Marx and Freud.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp. 142â143, 249.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929 his article "Dialectical Materialism and Psychoanalysis" was published in ''Unter dem Banner des Marxismus'', the German Communist Party journal.&lt;!--check this--&gt; The article explored whether psychoanalysis was compatible with historical materialism, class struggle and proletarian revolution. Reich concluded that they were compatible if [[dialectical materialism]] was applied to psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Baxandall (ed.), ''Sex-Pol: Essays, 1929-1934'', London: Verso.&lt;!--check source--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--add energetic functionalism; also dialectical materialism section--&gt; This was one of the central theoretical statements of his Marxist period, which included ''The Imposition of Sexual Morality'' (1932), ''The Sexual Struggle of Youth'' (1932), ''The Mass Psychology of Fascism'' (1933), "What is Class Consciousness?" (1934) and ''The Sexual Revolution'' (1936).

==1930â1934: Germany, Denmark, Sweden==
===''Verlag fÃ¼r Sexualpolitik''===
[[File:Gedenktafel Schlangenbader Str 87 (Wilmd) Wilhelm Reich.jpg|thumb|alt=a steel plaque etched with several paragraphs in German|Plaque on {{lang|de|Schlangenbader StraÃe 87, [[Berlin-Wilmersdorf]]}}, the house in which Reich lived, 1931â1933.]]

Reich and his wife moved to Berlin in November 1930, where he set up clinics in working-class areas, taught sex education and published pamphlets. He joined the [[Communist Party of Germany]], but grew impatient over their delay in publishing one of his pamphlets, ''{{lang|de|Der Sexuelle Kampf der Jugend}}'' (1932), published in English as ''The Sexual Struggle of Youth'' (1972). He set up his own publishing house, ''{{lang|de|Verlag fÃ¼r Sexualpolitik}}'', and published the pamphlet himself.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p169/&gt;

His subsequent involvement in a conference promoting adolescent sexuality caused the party to announce that it would no longer publish his material. On March 24, 1933 Freud told him that his contract with the International Psychoanalytic Publishers to publish ''Character Analysis'' had been cancelled. Sharaf writes that this was almost certainly because of Reich's stance on teenage sex.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p169&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp. 169â171.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Character Analysis''===
{{further|Character Analysis}}
Reich published what [[Robert Corrington]] called his masterpiece, ''Charakteranalyse: Technik und Grundlagen fÃ¼r studierende und praktizierende Analytiker'', in 1933. It was revised and published in English in 1946 and 1949 as ''Character Analysis''. The book sought to move psychoanalysis toward a reconfiguration of character structure.&lt;ref name=Corrington133&gt;Corrington 2003, pp. 133â134.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Reich, character structure was the result of social processes, in particular a reflection of [[Castration anxiety|castration]] and [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]] anxieties playing themselves out within the nuclear family.&lt;ref name=Corrington133/&gt; [[Les Greenberg]] and Jeremy Safran write that Reich proposed a functional identity between the character, emotional blocks, and tension in the body, or what he called character (or muscular/body) armour (''Charakterpanzer'').&lt;ref name=Greenberg1990p20&gt;Greenberg and Safran 1990, pp. 20â21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reich proposed that muscular armour was a defence that contained the history of the patient's traumas.&lt;ref&gt;Strick 2015, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he blamed Freud's jaw cancer on his muscular armour, rather than his smoking: Freud's Judaism meant he was "biting down" impulses, rather than expressing them.&lt;ref&gt;Corrington 2003, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Dissolving the armour would bring back the memory of the childhood repression that had caused the blockage in the first place.&lt;ref name=Greenberg1990p20/&gt;

===End of first marriage===
{{psychoanalysis}}
Reich had several affairs during his marriage to [[:de:Annie Reich|Annie Reich]], which ended in 1933 after he began a serious relationship in May 1932 with Elsa Lindenberg, a dancer and pupil of [[Elsa Gindler]].&lt;ref&gt;For Lindenberg, see Karina and Kant 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=N8f_bKK2fnEC&amp;pg=PA54 54â55].&lt;/ref&gt; He was living with Lindenberg in Germany when Hitler became Chancellor in January 1933. On March 2 that year the Nazi newspaper ''[[VÃ¶lkischer Beobachter]]'' published an attack on ''Der Sexuelle Kampf der Jugend''.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;170.&lt;/ref&gt; Reich and Lindenberg left for Vienna the next day. They moved from there to Denmark, where Reich was excluded from the [[Danish Communist Party]] in November 1933 (without ever having joined it) because of his promotion of teenage sex and the publication that year of ''The Mass Psychology of Fascism'', which they regarded as "counterrevolutionary". There were multiple complaints about his promotion of abortion, sex education, and the attempted suicide of a teenage patient. According to Turner, when Reich's visa expired, it was not renewed.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;150â154.&lt;/ref&gt;

He tried to find support among psychoanalysts in the UK so that he could settle there, and was interviewed in London by [[Ernest Jones]], [[Melanie Klein]], [[Joan Riviere]] and [[James Strachey]]. They decided that he had been "insufficiently analysed" and had an unresolved hostility toward Freud.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;154â155.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anna Freud]], Freud's daughterâwhom Jones had contacted about Reich's desire to relocate to Englandâwrote in 1938: "There is a wall somewhere where he stops to understand the other person's point of view and flies off into a world of his own&amp;nbsp; ... He is an unhappy person&amp;nbsp; ... and I am afraid this will end in sickness."&lt;ref&gt;Danto 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;270.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reich and Lindenberg moved instead to MalmÃ¶ in Sweden, which Reich described as "better than a concentration camp", but he was placed under surveillance when police suspected that the hourly visits of patients to his hotel room meant he was running a brothel, with Lindenberg as the prostitute.&lt;ref name=Turner2011p158&gt;Turner 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;158.&lt;/ref&gt; The government declined to extend his visa, and the couple had to move briefly back to Denmark, Reich under an assumed name.&lt;ref&gt;Corrington 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;181.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vegetotherapy===
{{further|Vegetotherapy}}
From 1930 onwards, Reich began to treat patients outside the limits of psychoanalysis's restrictions. He would sit opposite them, rather than behind them as they lay on a couch (the traditional psychoanalyst's position), and begin talking to them and answering their questions, instead of offering the stock, "Why do you ask?" analyst's response. He had noticed that after a successful course of psychoanalysis his patients would hold their bodies differently, so he began to try to communicate with the body using touch. He asked his male patients to undress down to their shorts, and sometimes entirely, and his female patients down to their underclothes, and began to massage them to loosen their body armour. He would also ask them to simulate physically the effects of certain emotions in the hope of triggering them.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp. 234â235, 241â242.&lt;/ref&gt;

He first presented the principles of what he called character-analytic vegetotherapy in August 1934, in a paper entitled "Psychischer Kontakt und vegetative StrÃ¶mung" ("Psychological Contact and Vegetative Current") at the 13th International Congress of Psychoanalysis at Lucerne, Switzerland.&lt;ref name=Sharaf242/&gt; His second wife, Ilse Ollendorf, said vegetotherapy replaced the psychoanalytic method of never touching a patient with "a physical attack by the therapist".&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The method eliminated the psychoanalytic doctrine of neutrality. Reich argued that the psychoanalytic taboos reinforced the neurotic taboos of the patient, and that he wanted his patients to see him as human.&lt;ref name=Sharaf242&gt;Sharaf 1994, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; He would press his thumb or the palm of his hand hard (and painfully) on their jaws, necks, chests, backs, or thighs, aiming to dissolve their muscular, and thereby characterological, rigidity.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p234&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp. 234â235.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that the purpose of the massage was to retrieve the repressed memory of the childhood situation that had caused the repression. If the session worked, he would see waves of pleasure move through their bodies, which he called the "orgasm reflex". According to Sharaf, the twin goals of Reichian therapy were the attainment of this orgasm reflex during sessions and orgastic potency during intercourse. Reich briefly considered calling it "orgasmotherapy", but thought better of it.&lt;ref name=Sharaf238&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp. 238â241, 243; Reich, ''Function of the Orgasm'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before the Lucerne conference, Reich was asked to resign from the International Psychoanalytical Association for prioritizing his revolutionary agenda over Freud's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=IFP.012.0109A Rubin 2003].&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived at the conference furious about his treatment. Turner writes that he cemented his reputation as a madman, camping in a tent outside the conference hall and reportedly carrying a large knife in his belt.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, pp. 166â167.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the psychiatrist [[Grete L. Bibring|Grete Bibring]], Paul Federn declared, "Either Reich goes or I go."&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p.&amp;nbsp; [https://books.google.com/books?id=ddlMl4jJgh0C&amp;pg=PA187 187], citing his own interview with Grete Bibring, 30 May 1971; Turner 2011, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1934â1939: Norway==
===Bioelectricity===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F057884-0009, Willy Brandt.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=|[[Willy Brandt]]]]
In October 1934 Reich and Lindenberg moved to Oslo, Norway, where [[Harald K. Schjelderup]], professor of psychology at the [[University of Oslo]], had invited Reich to lecture on character analysis and vegetotherapy. They ended up staying for five years.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, p. 172; SÃ¸bye 1995, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in Norway, Reich attempted to ground his orgasm theory in biology, exploring whether Freud's metaphor of the [[libido]] was in fact electricity or a chemical substance, an argument Freud had proposed in the 1890s but had abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;SÃ¸bye 1995, p. 194; Turner 2011, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Reich argued that conceiving of the orgasm as nothing but mechanical tension and relaxation could not explain why some experience pleasure and others do not. He wanted to know what additional element had to be present for pleasure to be felt.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp. 209â210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reich was influenced by the work of the Austrian internist [[Friedrich Kraus]], who argued in his paper ''Allgemeine und Spezielle Pathologie der Person'' (1926) that the biosystem was a relay-like switch mechanism of electrical charge and discharge. Reich wrote in an essay, "''Der Orgasmus als Elektro-physiologische Entladung''" ("The Orgasm as an Electrophysiological Discharge", 1934), that the orgasm is just such a [[Bioelectromagnetism|bioelectrical]] discharge and proposed his "orgasm formula": mechanical tension (filling of the organs with fluid; tumescence) â bioelectrical charge â bioelectrical discharge â mechanical relaxation (detumescence).&lt;ref&gt;Strick 2015, pp. 57â59; Sharaf 1994, pp. 209â210.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935 Reich bought an [[oscillograph]] and attached it to friends and students, who volunteered to touch and kiss each other while Reich read the tracings. One of the volunteers was a young [[Willy Brandt]], the future chancellor of Germany. At the time, he was married to Reich's secretary, Gertrude Gaasland, and was living in Norway to organize protests against the Nazis. Reich also took measurements from the patients of a psychiatric hospital near Oslo, including catatonic patients, with the permission of the hospital's director.&lt;ref&gt;Strick 2015 p. 65; Turner 2011, pp. 173â175.&lt;/ref&gt; Reich described the oscillograph experiments in 1937 in ''Experimentelle ErgebniÃe Ãber Die Elektrische Funktion von SexualitÃ¤t und Angst'' (''The Bioelectrical Investigation of Sexuality and Anxiety'').&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, pp. 173â175.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bion experiments===

From 1934 to 1939 Reich conducted what he called the bion experiments, which he published as ''Die Bione: zur Entstehung des vegetativen Lebens'' in Oslo in February 1938 (published in English in 1979 and later called ''The Bion Experiments on the Origin of Life'').&lt;ref&gt;Strick 2015, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; He examined [[protozoa]] and grew cultured [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] using grass, sand, iron and animal tissue, boiling them and adding [[potassium]] and [[gelatin]]. Having heated the materials to [[incandescence]] with a heat-torch, he wrote that he had seen bright, glowing, blue vesicles. He called them "bions" and believed they were a rudimentary form of life, halfway between life and non-life. He wrote that when he poured the cooled mixture onto growth media, [[bacteria]] were born, dismissing the idea that the bacteria were already present in the air or on other materials.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p. 220ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In what Sharaf writes was the origins of the orgone theory, Reich said he could see two kinds of bions, the blue vesicles and smaller red ones shaped like lancets. He called the former PA-bions and the latter T-bacilli, the T standing for ''Tod'', German for death.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1995, p. 223; Reich, ''Beyond Psychology: Letters and Journals 1934â1939'', p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in his book ''The Cancer Biopathy'' (1948) that he had found T-bacilli in rotting cancerous tissue obtained from a local hospital, and when injected into mice they caused inflammation and cancer. He concluded that, when orgone energy diminishes in cells through aging or injury, the cells undergo "bionous degeneration". At some point the deadly T-bacilli start to form in the cells. Death from cancer, he believed, was caused by an overwhelming growth of the T-bacilli.&lt;ref&gt;Cordon 2012, p. 412; Reich, ''The Cancer Biopathy'', chapter 2, section 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to his ideas===
[[File:Bronislawmalinowski.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=monohrome photograph of a man, wearing glasses|[[BronisÅaw Malinowski]] wrote to newspapers in Norway in support of Reich.&lt;ref name=Sharaf231/&gt;]]

Scientists in Oslo reacted strongly to Reich's work on bions, deriding it as nonsense. ''Tidens Tegn'', a leading liberal newspaper, launched a campaign against him in 1937, supported by scientists and other newspapers.&lt;ref name=Brady/&gt; Between March and December 1938, more than 165 articles or letters appeared in 13 Norwegian newspapers denouncing him.&lt;ref&gt;Strick 2015, p.&amp;nbsp;230.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p233&gt;Sharaf 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;233.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 the Norwegian pathologist [[Leiv Kreyberg]] was allowed to examine one of Reich's bion preparations under a microscope. Kreyberg wrote that the broth Reich had used as his culture medium was indeed sterile, but that the bacteria were ordinary [[staphylococci]]. He concluded that Reich's control measures to prevent infection from airborne bacteria were not as foolproof as Reich believed. Kreyberg accused Reich of being ignorant of basic bacteriological and anatomical facts, while Reich accused Kreyberg of having failed to recognize living cancer cells under magnification.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p228/&gt;

Reich sent a sample of the bacteria to a Norwegian biologist, [[Theodor ThjÃ¸tta]] of the Oslo Bacteriological Institute, who also blamed airborne infection. Kreyberg and ThjÃ¸tta's views were published in the country's largest newspaper, ''[[Aftenposten]]'', on 19 and 21 April 1938. Kreyberg alleged that "Mr. Reich" knew less about bacteria and anatomy than a first-year medical student. When Reich requested a detailed control study, Kreyberg responded that his work did not merit it.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p228&gt;Sharaf 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;228.&lt;/ref&gt;

By February 1938 Reich's visa had expired. Several Norwegian scientists argued against an extension, Kreyberg saying, "If it is a question of handing Dr. Reich over to the Gestapo, then I will fight that, but if one could get rid of him in a decent manner, that would be the best."&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; The writer [[Sigurd Hoel]] asked: "When did it become a reason for deportation that one looked in a microscope when one was not a trained biologist?" Reich received support from overseas, first from the anthropologist [[BronisÅaw Malinowski]], who in March wrote to the press in Norway that Reich's sociological works were "a distinct and valuable contribution toward science", and from [[A. S. Neill]], founder of [[Summerhill School|Summerhill]], a progressive school in England, who argued that "the campaign against Reich seems largely ignorant and uncivilized, more like fascism than democracy".&lt;ref name=Sharaf231&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp. 231â232.&lt;/ref&gt;

Norway was proud of its intellectual tolerance, so the "Reich affair", especially following the country's 1936 expulsion of [[Leon Trotsky]], put [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|Nygaardsvold's government]] on the spot. A compromise was found. Reich was given his visa, but a royal decree was issued stipulating that anyone wanting to practice psychoanalysis needed a licence, and it was understood that Reich would not be given one. Throughout the affair Reich issued just one public statement, when he asked for a commission to replicate his bion experiments. Sharaf writes that the opposition to his work affected his personality and relationships. He was left humiliated, no longer comfortable in public, and seething with bitterness against the researchers who had denounced him.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp. 232â233.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
[[File:Wilhelm Reich's home.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=photograph of a two-storey, white, mid-terrace house |Reich's home in [[Frogner]], Oslo. A [[blue plaque]], in Norwegian, reads: "The physician and psychoanalyst WILHELM REICH (1897â1957) lived and worked here 1935â39. Developed character analysis and the body-oriented therapy."]]

According to Sharaf, 1934â1937 was the happiest period of Reich's personal life, despite the professional problems. His relationship with Elsa Lindenberg was good and he considered marrying her. When she became pregnant in 1935, they were initially overjoyed, buying clothes and furniture for the child, but doubts developed for Reich, who saw the future as too unsettled. To Lindenberg's great distress, Sharaf writes, Reich insisted on an abortion, at that time illegal. They went to Berlin, where the psychoanalyst [[Edith Jacobson]] helped to arrange it.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp. 245â246.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 Reich began an affair with a female patient, an actress who had been married to a colleague of his. According to Sigurd Hoel, the analysis would stop because of the relationship, then the relationship would end and the analysis would start up again. The patient eventually threatened to go to the press, but was persuaded that it would harm her as much as it would Reich. Around the same time, Reich also had an affair with Gerd Bergersen, a 25-year-old Norwegian textile designer.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p253/&gt;

Despite the affairs, Sharaf writes that, as the newspaper campaign against Reich gained pace, he developed an intense jealousy toward Lindenberg, demanding that she not have a separate life of any kind. He even physically assaulted a composer with whom she was working. Lindenberg considered calling the police but decided Reich could not afford another scandal. His behaviour took its toll on their relationship, and when Reich asked her to accompany him to the United States, she said no.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p253&gt;Sharaf 1994, p. 253â255.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1939â1957: United States==
===Teaching, second marriage===
When Hitler [[Anschluss|annexed]] Austria in March 1938, Reich's ex-wife and daughters had already left for the United States. Later that year, Theodore P. Wolfe, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, traveled to Norway to study under Reich. Wolfe offered to help Reich settle in the States, and managed to arrange an invitation from [[The New School]] in New York for Reich to teach a course on "Biological Aspects of Character Formation". Wolfe and Walter Briehl, a former student of Reich's, put up $5,000 to guarantee his visa.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfe also pulled strings with [[Adolph Berle]], an official in the State Department.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p257/&gt; Reich wrote in his diary in May 1939:

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:5em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 3px #ccc; padding:1.5em;"&gt;
I am sitting in a completely empty apartment waiting for my American visa. I have misgivings as to how it will go.&amp;nbsp; ... I am utterly and horribly alone!

It will be quite an undertaking to carry on all the work in America. Essentially, I am a great man, a rarity, as it were. I can't quite believe it myself, however, and that is why I struggle against playing the role of a great man.&lt;ref&gt;Corrington 2003, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He received the visa in August 1939 and sailed out of Norway on 19 August on the ''SS Stavangerfjord'', the last ship to leave for the United States before the war began on 3 September.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p257&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp. 257â259.&lt;/ref&gt; He began teaching at The New School, where he remained until May 1941, living first at 7502 Kessel Street, [[Forest Hills, Queens]], where he conducted experiments on mice with cancer, injecting them with bions. He built a small [[Faraday cage]] to examine the vapors and lights he said the bions were producing.&lt;ref name=Turner2011p220&gt;Turner 2011, pp. 220â2212.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1939 his secretary Gertrud Gaasland introduced him to Ilse Ollendorf, 29 years old at the time. Reich was still in love with Lindenberg, but Ollendorf started organizing his life for him, becoming his bookkeeper and laboratory assistant.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p263/&gt; They began living together in the Kessel Street house on Christmas Day 1939. She was eight weeks pregnant, but according to Turner he insisted that she have an abortion.&lt;ref name=Turner2011p220/&gt; Five years later, in 1944, they had a son, Peter, and were married in 1946.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p263&gt;Sharaf 1944, pp. 263â265; [https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/18/archives/wilhelm-reich-the-psychoanalyst-as-revolutionary-wilhelm-reich.html Elkind, 18 April 1971].&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharaf writes that Reich's personality changed after his experience in Oslo.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p233/&gt; He became socially isolated and kept his distance even from old friends and his ex-wife. His students in the United States came to know him as a man that no colleague, no matter how close, called by his first name. In January 1940 he wrote to Lindenberg to end their relationship once and for all, telling her that he was in despair and that he believed he would end up dying like a dog.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp. 273â274.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orgonomy===
{{further|Orgone}}
[[File:Healing Devices (FDA 138) (8224052279).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=photograph of a woman, sitting on a chair which is in a large, wardrobe-sized  box, the open door of which has a small window. A man stands nearby, holding a breathing apparatus.|Orgone accumulator]]

It was shortly after he arrived in New York in 1939 that Reich first said he had discovered a biological or cosmic energy, an extension of Freud's idea of the [[libido]]. He called it "orgone energy" or "orgone radiation", and the study of it "orgonomy". Reich said he had seen orgone when he injected his mice with bions and in the sky at night through an "organoscope", a special telescope. He argued that it is in the soil and air (indeed, is [[Omnipresence|omnipresent]]), is blue or blue-grey, and that humanity had divided its knowledge of it in two: [[Aether theories|aether]] for the physical aspect and God for the spiritual. The colour of the sky, the [[Aurora (astronomy)|northern lights]], [[St Elmo's Fire]], and the blue of sexually excited frogs are manifestations of orgone, he wrote. He also argued that [[protozoa]], [[Red blood cell|red corpuscles]], [[cancer cell]]s and the [[chlorophyll]] of plants are charged with it.&lt;ref name=Turner2011p220/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p352&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp. 17, 352; Reich, ''The Function of the Orgasm'', pp. 384â385.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940 he began to build insulated [[Faraday cage]]s, "orgone accumulators", that he said would concentrate the orgone. The earliest boxes were for laboratory animals. The first human-sized, five-foot-tall box was built in December 1940, and set up in the basement of his house. Turner writes that it was made of plywood lined with rock wool and sheet iron, and had a chair inside and a small window. The boxes had multiple layers of these materials, which caused the orgone concentration inside the box to be three to five times stronger than in the air, Reich said. Patients were expected to sit inside them naked.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, pp. 222â223.&lt;/ref&gt;

The accumulators were tested on plant growth and mice with cancer.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p302&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp. 302â303.&lt;/ref&gt; Reich wrote to his supporters in July 1941 that orgone is "definitely able to destroy cancerous growth. This is proved by the fact that tumors in all parts of the body are disappearing or diminishing. No other remedy in the world can claim such a thing."&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Although not licensed to practise medicine in the United States, he began testing the boxes on human beings diagnosed with cancer and schizophrenia. In one case the test had to be stopped prematurely because the subject heard a rumour that Reich was insane; there were stories, which were false, that he had been hospitalized in the Utica State Mental Hospital. In another case the father of an eight-year-old girl with cancer approached him for help, then complained to the American Medical Association that he was practising without a licence.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, pp. 230â233.&lt;/ref&gt; He asked his supporters to stick with him through the criticism, believing that he had developed a grand unified theory of physical and mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;232; Grossinger 1982, pp.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EUw9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA268 268ff], 293.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Janet L.

===Experiment with Einstein===
[[File:Albert Einstein Head.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A photograph of Albert Einstein, with flowing, white hair|Reich discussed orgone accumulators with [[Albert Einstein]] during 1941.]]

In December 1940 Reich wrote to [[Albert Einstein]] saying he had a scientific discovery he wanted to discuss, and, in January 1941, visited Einstein at his home in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], where they talked for nearly five hours. He told Einstein that he had discovered a "specific biologically effective energy which behaves in many respects differently to all that is known about electromagnetic energy". He said it could be used against disease, and as a weapon "in the fight against the Fascist pestilence". (Einstein had [[EinsteinâSzilÃ¡rd letter|signed a letter to President Roosevelt]] in August 1939 to warn of the danger of Nazi Germany building an atom bomb, and had urged the United States to establish its own research project.) Einstein agreed that if an object's temperature could be raised without an apparent heating source, as Reich was suggesting, it would be "a bomb".&lt;ref name=Brian1996p325&gt;Brian 1996, pp. 325â327.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reich was much encouraged by the meeting and hoped he would be invited to join Princeton's [[Institute for Advanced Study]].&lt;ref name=Brian1996p325/&gt; During their next meeting, he gave Einstein a small accumulator, and over the next 10 days Einstein performed experiments with it in his basement, which involved taking the temperature above, inside and near the device, and stripping it down to its Faraday cage to compare temperatures. He observed an increase of temperature, which Reich argued was caused by orgone.{{refn|group=n|Einstein to Reich, 7 February 1941: "I have now investigated your apparatus&amp;nbsp; ... In the beginning I made enough readings without any changes in your arrangements. The box-thermometer showed regularly a temperature of about 0.3-0.4 higher than the one suspended freely."&lt;ref name=Einsteinletter&gt;Einstein's letter to Reich, 7 February 1941, in Reich, ''The Einstein Affair'', 1953. For Reich's argument, Sharaf 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;286.&lt;/ref&gt;}} One of Einstein's assistants pointed out that the temperature was lower on the floor than on the ceiling.{{refn|group=n|Einstein to Reich, 7 February 1941: "One of my assistants now drew my attention to the fact that in the room&amp;nbsp; ... the temperature on the floor is always lower than the one on the ceiling."&lt;ref name=Einsteinletter/&gt;}} Einstein concluded that the effect was simply due to the temperature gradient inside the room. "Through these experiments I regard the matter as completely solved", he wrote to Reich on 7 February 1941.&lt;ref name=Einsteinletter/&gt;

Reich responded with a 25-page letter in which he tried to change Einstein's mind.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp. 286â287.&lt;/ref&gt; To rule out the influence of [[Convective heat transfer|convection]] he told Einstein that he had taken certain measures, including introducing a horizontal plate above the accumulator, wrapping it in a blanket, hanging it from the ceiling, burying it underground and placing it outside. He wrote that in all these circumstances the temperature difference remained, and was in fact more marked in the open air.&lt;ref&gt;Corrington 2003, pp. 188â189.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Reich to Einstein: "The original arrangement of the apparatus results, under all circumstances, in a temperature difference between the thermometer in the box and the control thermometer, in the absence of any known kind of constant heat source."&lt;ref&gt;Corrington 2003, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Einstein did not respond to this or to Reich's future correspondenceâReich would write regularly reporting the results of his experimentsâuntil Reich threatened three years later to publish their previous exchange. Einstein replied that he could not devote any further time to the matter and asked that his name not be misused for advertising purposes. Reich believed that Einstein's change of heart was part of a conspiracy of some kind, perhaps related to the communists or prompted by the rumours that Reich was ill. Reich published the correspondence in 1953 as ''The Einstein Affair''.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, pp. 226â230.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrested by the FBI===
Reich lost his position at the New School in May 1941 after writing to its director, [[Alvin Saunders Johnson|Alvin Johnson]], to say he had saved several lives in secret experiments with the accumulator. Johnson was aware of Reich's claims that he could cure cancer, and told him the New School was not an appropriate institution for the work. Reich was also evicted from Kessel Street after his neighbours complained about the animal experiments. His supporters, including Walter Briehl, gave him $14,000 to buy a house, and he settled into 9906 69th Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, pp. 230â231.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 December 1941, five days after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and a day after [[German declaration of war against the United States|
Germany declared it was at war with the United States]], Reich was arrested in his home at 2 a.m. by the FBI and taken to [[Ellis Island]], where he was held for over three weeks.&lt;ref name=arrest/&gt; He identified himself at the time as the Associate Professor of Medical Psychology, Director of the Orgone Institute.&lt;ref name=fbi/&gt; He was at first left to sleep on the floor in a large hall, surrounded by members of the fascist [[German American Bund]], who Reich feared might kill him, but when his psoriasis returned he was transferred to the hospital ward.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; He was questioned about several books the FBI found when they searched his home, including Hitler's ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', [[Trotsky]]'s ''[[My Life (Leon Trotsky autobiography)|My Life]]'', a biography of Lenin and a Russian alphabet book for children. After threatening to go on hunger strike he was released, on 5 January, but his name remained on the "key figures list" of the Enemy Alien Control Unit, which meant he was placed under surveillance.&lt;ref name=arrest&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp. 271â272; Turner 2011, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

Turner writes that it seems Reich was the victim of mistaken identity; there was a William Reich who ran a bookstore in New Jersey, which was used to distribute Communist material. The FBI acknowledged the mistake in November 1943 and closed Reich's file.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, pp. 242â243.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 it released 789 pages of the file:

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:5em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 3px #ccc; padding:1.5em;"&gt;
This German immigrant described himself as the Associate Professor of Medical Psychology, Director of the Orgone Institute, President and research physician of the Wilhelm Reich Foundation and discoverer of biological or life energy. A 1940 security investigation was begun to determine the extent of Reich's communist commitments. A board of [[enemy alien|Alien Enemy]] Hearing judged that Dr. Reich was not a threat to the security of the U.S. In 1947, a security investigation concluded that neither the Orgone Project nor any of its staff were engaged in subversive activities or were in violation of any statute within the jurisdiction of the FBI.&lt;ref name=fbi&gt;[https://vault.fbi.gov/Venona/Venona%20Part%201%20of%201/view "FBI adds new subjects to electronic reading room"], U.S. State Department, 2 March 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{further|Orgonon}}

In November 1942 Reich purchased an old farm for $4,000 on Dodge Pond, Maine, near [[Rangeley, Maine|Rangeley]], with {{convert|280|acre|km2}} of land. Calling it Orgonon, he started spending summers there, and had a one-room cabin built in 1943, a laboratory in 1945, a larger cabin in 1946 and an observatory in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 he decided to live there year-round, and in May that year moved from New York with Ilse, their son, Peter, and Reich's daughter Eva, with the idea of creating a centre for the study of orgone. Several colleagues moved there with him, including two physicians with an interest in orgone, and Lois Wyvell, who ran the Orgone Press Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt; The artist [[William Moise]] joined Reich as an assistant at Orgonon, later marrying Eva Reich.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bangordailynews.com/2008/09/25/obituaries/eva-renate-reich-md/ Obituary: Eva Renate Reich, MD"], ''Bangor Daily News'', 25 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Orgonon still houses the Wilhelm Reich Museum, as well as holiday cottages available to rent, one of which is the cottage in which the Reichs lived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilhelmreichtrust.org/cottages.html "Rental cottages"], Wilhelm Reich Infant Trust.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1947 Reich enjoyed a largely uncritical press in the United States. One journal, ''Psychosomatic Medicine'', had called orgone a "surrealist creation", but his psychoanalytic work had been discussed in the ''Journal of the American Medical Association'' and the ''American Journal of Psychiatry'', ''The Nation'' had given his writing positive reviews, and he was listed in ''American Men of Science''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/68E1awEUD?url=http://cyberquebec.ca/libresarchiveswilhelmreich/strange_case_of_wilhelm_reich.pdf Brady, 26 May 1947].&lt;/ref&gt;

His reputation took a sudden downturn in April and May 1947, when articles by [[Mildred Edie Brady]] were published in ''Harper's'' and ''The New Republic'', the latter entitled "The Strange Case of Wilhelm Reich", with the subhead, "The man who blames both neuroses and cancer on unsatisfactory sexual activities has been repudiated by only one scientific journal."&lt;ref name=Brady/&gt; Brady's ultimate target was not Reich but psychoanalysis, which according to Turner she saw as akin to astrology.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;274.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of Reich she wrote: "Orgone, named after the sexual orgasm, is, according to Reich, a cosmic energy. It is, in fact, {{em|the}} cosmic energy. Reich has not only discovered it; he has seen it, demonstrated it and named a townâOrgonon, Maineâafter it. Here he builds accumulators of it, which are rented out to patients, who presumably derive 'orgastic potency' from it."&lt;ref name=Brady&gt;[http://www.harpers.org/archive/1947/04/0032908 Brady, April 1947]; [https://www.webcitation.org/68E1awEUD?url=http://cyberquebec.ca/libresarchiveswilhelmreich/strange_case_of_wilhelm_reich.pdf Brady, 26 May 1947]; Turner 2011, p. 272ff.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|According to his estate, Reich rejected the idea that the accumulator could provide orgastic potency. He wrote in 1950: "The orgone accumulator, as has been clearly stated in the relevant publications (''The Cancer Biopathy'', etc.), cannot provide orgastic potency."&lt;ref&gt;Reich, ''Orgone Energy Bulletin'', April 1950, 2(2), cited by Kevin Hinchley, letter to the editor, ''New York Times Book Review'', 16 October 2011 ([http://www.wilhelmreichtrust.org/update_11_11.pdf Wilhelm Reich Infant Trust]).&lt;/ref&gt;}} She claimed, falsely, that he had said the accumulators could cure not only impotence but cancer.&lt;ref name=Strick2015p2/&gt; Brady argued that the "growing Reich cult" had to be dealt with.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p361&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp. 360â361.&lt;/ref&gt; On his copy of the ''New Republic'' article, Reich wrote "THE SMEAR". He issued a press release, but no one published it.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, pp. 281â282.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1947 Dr. J. J. Durrett, director of the Medical Advisory Division of the [[Federal Trade Commission]], wrote to the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) asking them to investigate Reich's claims about the health benefits of orgone. The FDA assigned an investigator to the case, who learned that Reich had built 250 accumulators. The FDA concluded that they were dealing with a "fraud of the first magnitude". According to Sharaf, the FDA suspected a sexual racket of some kind; questions were asked about the women associated with orgonomy and "what was done with them".&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp. 363â364.&lt;/ref&gt; From that point on, Reich's work came increasingly to the attention of the authorities.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p410/&gt;

===Orgonomic Infant Research Center===
Reich established the Orgonomic Infant Research Center (OIRC) in 1950, with the aim of preventing muscular armouring in children from birth. Meetings were held in the basement of his house in Forest Hills. Turner wrote that several children who were treated by OIRC therapists later said they had been sexually abused by the therapists, although not by Reich. One woman said she was assaulted by one of Reich's associates when she was five years old. Children were asked to stand naked in front of Reich and a group of 30 therapists in his basement, while Reich described the children's "blockages".&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, pp. 314, 317â319, 321.&lt;/ref&gt; Reich's daughter, Lore Reich Rubin, told Turner that she believed her father was an abuser, although she did not say she had been abused by him, and she acknowledged that she had no evidence. She believed that Reich himself had been abused as a child, which is why he developed such an interest in sex and childhood sexuality.&lt;ref name=Turner2011p323&gt;Turner 2011, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sexual allegations apart, several people discussed how the vegetotherapy had hurt them physically as children, as therapists pressed hard on the body to loosen muscular armour. Reich's son, Peter, wrote in his autobiography, ''Book of Dreams'' (1973) about the pain this had caused him.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, pp. 315â316.&lt;/ref&gt; Susanna Steig, the daughter of [[William Steig]], the ''New Yorker'' cartoonist, wrote about being pressed so hard during Reichian therapy that she had difficulty breathing, and said that a woman therapist had sexually assaulted her. According to Turner, a nurse complained in 1952 to the New York Medical Society that an OIRC therapist had taught her five-year-old son how to masturbate. The therapist was arrested, but the case was dropped when Reich agreed to close the OIRC.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, pp. 325â326.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divorce, cloudbusters===
{{further|Cloudbuster}}
[[File:WilhelmReichcloudbuster2.jpg|thumb|alt=monochorome photograph of a man stood alongside of a device which comprises mainly a series of vertical pipes |Reich with one of his [[cloudbuster]]s]]

Reich and Ilse Ollendorff divorced in September 1951, ostensibly because he thought she had had an affair. She continued working with him for another three years. Even after the divorce, he suspected her of having affairs, and persuaded her to sign confessions about her feelings of fear and hatred toward him, which he locked away in the archives of his Orgone Institute. He wrote several documents denouncing her, while having an affair himself with Lois Wyvell, who ran the Orgone Institute Press.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, pp. 338â339.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Reich said he had discovered another energy that he called deadly orgone radiation (DOR), accumulations of which played a role in [[desertification]]. He designed a "cloudbuster", rows of 15-foot aluminium pipes mounted on a mobile platform, connected to cables that were inserted into water. He believed that it could unblock orgone energy in the atmosphere and cause rain. Turner described it as an "orgone box turned inside out".&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, pp. 11, 333, 365â367.&lt;/ref&gt;

He conducted dozens of experiments with the cloudbuster, calling his research "Cosmic Orgone Engineering". During a drought in 1953, two farmers in Maine offered to pay him if he could make it rain to save their blueberry crop. Reich used the cloudbuster on the morning of 6 July, and according to Bangor's ''Daily News''âbased on an account from an anonymous eyewitness who was probably Peter Reichârain began to fall that evening. The crop survived, the farmers declared themselves satisfied, and Reich received his fee.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;379â380; Turner 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;367.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Bangor's ''Daily News'' reported on 24 July 1953: "Dr. Reich and three assistants set up their 'rain-making device off the shore of Grand Lake, near the Bangor hydro-electric dam&amp;nbsp; ... The device, a set of hollow tubes, suspended over a small cylinder, connected by a cable, conducted a 'drawing' operation for about an hour and ten minutes&amp;nbsp; ... &lt;p&gt;"According to a reliable source in [[Ellsworth, Maine|Ellsworth]], the following climactic changes took place in that city on the night of July 6 and the early morning of July 7: 'Rain began to fall shortly after ten o'clock Monday evening, first as a drizzle and then by midnight as a gentle, steady rain. Rain continued throughout the night, and a rainfall of 0.24 inches was recorded in Ellsworth the following morning.'&lt;p&gt;"A puzzled witness to the 'rain-making' process said: 'The queerest looking clouds you ever saw began to form soon after they got the thing rolling.' And later the same witness said the scientists were able to change the course of the wind by manipulation of the device."&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf, p.&amp;nbsp;379.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Injunction===
Over the years the FDA interviewed physicians, Reich's students and his patients, asking about the orgone accumulators.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p410/&gt; A professor at the University of Oregon who bought an accumulator told an FDA inspector that he knew the device was phoney, but found it helpful because his wife sat quietly in it for four hours every day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170723170418/https://www.fda.gov/downloads/aboutfda/whatwedo/history/oralhistories/selectedoralhistorytranscripts/ucm263958.pdf Interview of Arthur Dickerman], 28 January 1981, Food and Drug Administration, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The attention of the FDA triggered belligerent responses from Reich, who called them "HiGS" (hoodlums in government) and the tools of red fascists. He developed a delusion that he had powerful friends in government, including [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]], who he believed would protect him, and that the U.S. Air Force was flying over Orgonon to make sure that he was all right.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p410/&gt; On 29 July 1952 three inspectors arrived at Orgonon unannounced. Sharaf writes that Reich detested unannounced visitors; he had once chased some people away with a gun just for looking at an adjacent property. He told the inspectors they had to read his work before he would interact with them, and ordered them to leave.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p410&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp. 410â413.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1954 the United States Attorney for the District of Maine filed a 27-page complaint seeking a permanent injunction under Sections 301 and 302 of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] to prevent interstate shipment of orgone accumulators and to ban promotional literature.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p. 418; [https://web.archive.org/web/20120114163232/http://www.orgone.org/wr-vs-usa/wr40210a.htm "Complaint for injunction"], 10 February 1954, ''USA v. Wilhelm Reich'', 1954â1957.&lt;/ref&gt; Reich refused to appear in court, arguing that no court was in a position to evaluate his work. In a letter to Judge John D. Clifford, Jr. in February, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:5em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 3px #ccc; padding:1.5em;"&gt;
My factual position in the case as well as in the world of science of today does not permit me to enter the case against the Food and Drug Administration, since such action would, in my mind, imply admission of the authority of this special branch of the government to pass judgment on primordial, pre-atomic cosmic orgone energy. I, therefore, rest the case in full confidence in your hands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110717195817/http://www.orgone.org/wr-vs-usa/wr40225a.htm "Wilhelm Reich's Response to FDA's Complaint for Injunction"], 25 February 1954, ''USA v. Wilhelm Reich'', 1954â1957.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The injunction was granted by default on 19 March 1954. The judge ordered that all accumulators, parts and instructions be destroyed, and that several of Reich's books that mentioned orgone be withheld.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p. 458ff; [https://web.archive.org/web/20110717195734/http://www.orgone.org/wr-vs-usa/wr40319d.htm "Decree of Injunction Order"], 19 March 1954, ''USA v. Wilhelm Reich'', 1954â1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chasing UFOs===
[[File:Polarlicht 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=colour photograph of the green aurora borealis over an icy landscape|Reich argued that [[orgone]] was responsible for the colour of the [[Aurora (astronomy)|northern lights]].]]

According to Turner, the injunction triggered a further deterioration in Reich's mental health. From at least early 1954, he came to believe that the planet was under attack by UFOs, or "energy alphas", as he called them. He said he often saw them flying over Orgononâshaped like thin cigars with windowsâleaving streams of black Deadly Orgone Radiation in their wake, which he believed the aliens were scattering to destroy the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, pp. 370â374; for "thin cigar shape with the little windows", p. 376; Reich, ''Contact with Space: Oranur Second Report, 1951â1956'', p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

He and his son would spend their nights searching for UFOs through telescopes and binoculars, and when they believed they had found one would roll out the cloudbuster to suck the energy out of it. Reich claimed he had shot several of them down. Armed with two cloudbusters, they fought what Reich called a "full-scale interplanetary battle" in Arizona, where he had rented a house as a base station.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, pp. 370â376.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Contact with Space'' (1956), he wrote of the "very remote possibility" that his own father had been from outer space.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1954 Reich began an affair with Grethe Hoff, a former patient. Hoff was married to another former student and patient of his, the psychologist [[Myron Sharaf]], who decades later, with his ''Fury on Earth'' (1983), became Reich's main biographer. Hoff and Sharaf had had their first child the year before Hoff left him for Reich; the marriage was never repaired although the affair had ended by June 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p. 30; Turner 2011, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later Reich began another relationship, this time with Aurora Karrer, a medical researcher, and, in November, he moved out of Orgonon to an apartment in [[Alban Towers]], Washington, D.C., to live with her, using the pseudonym Dr. Walter Roner.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, pp. 398â400.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contempt of court===
{{Anchor|Trial and book burning}}
While Reich was in Arizona in May 1956, one of his associates sent an accumulator part through the mail to another state, in violation of the injunction, after an FDA inspector posing as a customer requested it.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, p. 380â381.&lt;/ref&gt; Reich and another associate, Dr. Michael Silvert, were charged with [[contempt of court]]; Silvert had been looking after the inventory in Reich's absence. Reich at first refused to attend court, and was arrested and held for two days until a supporter posted bail of $30,000.&lt;ref name=Turner2011p401/&gt;

Representing himself during the hearing, he admitted the violation but pleaded not guilty and hinted at conspiracies. During a recess the judge apparently suggested a psychiatric evaluation to Reich's ex-wife, Ilse Ollendorff, but this was not communicated to Reich. The jury found him guilty on 7 May 1956, and he was sentenced to two years' imprisonment. Silvert was sentenced to a year and a day, the Wilhelm Reich Foundation was fined $10,000, and the accumulators and associated literature were to be destroyed.&lt;ref name=Turner2011p401&gt;Turner 2011, pp. 401â408.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book burning===
[[File:Neill birthday (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=monochrome photograph of a man, wearing glasses and holding a brandy glass |[[A.S. Neill]]]]

On 5 June 1956 two FDA officials arrived at Orgonon to supervise the destruction of the accumulators. Most of them had been sold by that time and another 50 were with Silvert in New York. Only three were at Orgonon. The FDA agents were not allowed to destroy them, only to supervise the destruction, so Reich's friends and his son, Peter, chopped them up with axes as the agents watched.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp. 458â461.&lt;/ref&gt; Once they were destroyed, Reich placed an American flag on top of them.&lt;ref name=Turner2011p410/&gt;

On 26 June the agents returned to supervise the destruction of the promotional material, including 251 copies of Reich's books.&lt;ref name=Turner2011p410&gt;Turner 2011, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] issued a press release criticizing the book burning, although coverage of the release was poor, and Reich ended up asking them not to help because he was annoyed that they had failed to criticize the destruction of the accumulators. In England [[A.S. Neill]] and the poet [[Herbert Read]] signed a letter of protest, but it was never published. On 23 July the remaining accumulators in New York were destroyed by S. A. Collins and Sons, who had built them.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p. 460; [https://www.nytimes.com/1956/07/13/archives/book-order-appealed-liberties-unit-asks-us-not-to-destroy-reichs.html?sq=%2522Wilhelm+Reich%2522&amp;scp=10&amp;st=p "Book Order Appealed; Liberties Unit Asks U.S. Not to Destroy Reich's Writings"], ''The New York Times'', 13 July 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 August six tons of Reich's books, journals and papers were burned in New York, in the Gansevoort incinerator, the public incinerator on 25th Street. The material included copies of several of his books, including ''The Sexual Revolution'', ''Character Analysis'' and ''The Mass Psychology of Fascism''. Although these had been published in German before Reich ever discussed orgone, he had added mention of it to the English editions, so they were caught by the injunction.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp. 419, 460â461.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been cited as one of the worst examples of [[Censorship in the United States|censorship in U.S. history]].{{refn|group=n|name=burning}} As with the accumulators, the FDA was supposed only to observe the destruction. The psychiatrist Victor Sobey (d. 1995), an associate of Reich's, wrote:

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:5em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 3px #ccc; padding:1.5em;"&gt;
All the expenses and labor had to be provided by the [Orgone Institute] Press. A huge truck with three to help was hired. I felt like people who, when they are to be executed, are made to dig their own graves first and are then shot and thrown in. We carried box after box of the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Imprisonment===
[[File:Associate Warden's Record Card for Wilhelm Reich.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=document|Reich's record card from the Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary.]]

Reich appealed the lower court's decision in October 1956, but the Court of Appeals upheld it on 11 December.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p. 458.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote several times to [[J. Edgar Hoover]], director of the FBI, requesting a meeting,&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;417.&lt;/ref&gt; and appealed to the  [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], which decided on 25 February 1957 not to review the case.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p465&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;465â466.&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 March 1957 Reich and Silvert were sent to Danbury Federal Prison. (Silvert committed suicide in May 1958, five months after his release.)&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;480; Turner 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;421; [https://www.nytimes.com/1957/03/12/archives/two-scientists-jailed-pair-sentenced-in-maine-in-sale-of.html?sq=%2522Wilhelm+Reich%2522&amp;scp=11&amp;st=p "Two Scientists Jailed; Pair Sentenced in Maine in Sale of 'Accumulators'"], ''The New York Times'', March 12, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard C. Hubbard, a psychiatrist who admired Reich, examined him on admission, recording [[paranoia]] manifested by [[grandiose delusion|delusions of grandiosity]], persecution, and [[ideas of reference]]:

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:5em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 3px #ccc; padding:1.5em;"&gt;
The patient feels that he has made outstanding discoveries. Gradually over a period of many years he has explained the failure of his ideas in becoming universally accepted by the elaboration of [[psychosis|psychotic]] thinking. "The Rockerfellows [sic] are against me." (Delusion of grandiosity.) "The airplanes flying over prison are sent by the Air Force to encourage me." (Ideas of reference and grandiosity.)&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p469&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;469â470; Turner 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;419â421.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 19 March Reich was transferred to the [[Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary]] and examined again. This time it was decided that he was mentally competent and that his personality seemed intact, though he might become psychotic when stressed.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p469/&gt; A few days later, on his 60th birthday, he wrote to his son, Peter, then 13:

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:5em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 3px #ccc; padding:1.5em;"&gt;
I am in Lewisburg. I am calm, certain in my thoughts, and doing mathematics most of the time. I am kind of "above things", fully aware of what is up. Do not worry too much about me, though anything might happen. I know, Pete, that you are strong and decent. At first I thought that you should ''not'' visit me here. I do not know. With the world in turmoil I now feel that a boy your age should experience what is coming his wayâfully digest it without getting a "belly ache", so to speak, nor getting off the right track of truth, fact, honesty, fair play, and being above boardâ''never a sneak''&amp;nbsp; ... &amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;476.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He applied for a presidential pardon in May, to no avail. Peter visited him in jail several times, where one prisoner said Reich was known as the "flying saucer guy" and the "Sex Box man".&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;425â426.&lt;/ref&gt; Reich told Peter that he cried a lot, and wanted Peter to let himself cry too, believing that tears are the "great softener". His last letter to his son was on 22 October 1957, when he said he was looking forward to being released on 10 November, having served one third of his sentence. A parole hearing had been scheduled for a few days before that date. He wrote that he and Peter had a date for a meal at the [[Howard Johnson's|Howard Johnson]] restaurant near Peter's school.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p477/&gt;

===Death===
Reich failed to appear for roll call on 3 November 1957 and was found at 7 a.m. in his bed, fully clothed but for his shoes. The prison doctor said he had died during the night of "myocardial insufficiency with sudden heart failure".&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p477 /&gt; He was buried in a vault at Orgonon that he had asked his caretaker to dig in 1955. He had left instructions that there was to be no religious ceremony, but that a record should be played of [[Ellens dritter Gesang|Schubert's "Ave Maria"]] sung by [[Marian Anderson]], and that his granite headstone should read simply: "Wilhelm Reich, Born March 24, 1897, Died&amp;nbsp; ... "&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p. 5; Turner 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;398, 427â428.&lt;/ref&gt; None of the academic journals carried an obituary. ''Time'' magazine wrote on 18 November 1957:

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:5em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 3px #ccc; padding:1.5em;"&gt;
Died. Wilhelm Reich, 60, once-famed psychoanalyst, associate and follower of Sigmund Freud, founder of the Wilhelm Reich Foundation, lately better known for unorthodox sex and energy theories; of a heart attack; in Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary, Pa; where he was serving a two-year term for distributing his invention, the "orgone energy accumulator" (in violation of the Food and Drug Act), a telephone-booth-size device that supposedly gathered energy from the atmosphere, and could cure, while the patient sat inside, common colds, cancer, and impotence.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,868066,00.html "Milestones, Nov. 18, 1957"], ''Time Magazine'', 18 November 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
===Psychotherapy===
The psychoanalyst Richard Sterba wrote in 1982 that Reich had been a brilliant clinician and teacher in the 1920s; even the older analysts had wanted to attend his technical seminars in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Sterba 1982, pp. 34â36.&lt;/ref&gt; But according to Sharaf, they came to consider Reich as paranoid and belligerent.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p8/&gt; Psychologist Luis Cordon wrote that Reich's slide from respectability concluded with the consensus inside and outside the psychoanalytic community that he was at best a crackpot and perhaps seriously ill.&lt;ref&gt;Cordon 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;405.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were inaccurate rumours from the late 1920s that he had been hospitalized.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Federn]] became Reich's second analyst in 1922; he later said he had detected "incipient [[schizophrenia]]" and called Reich a [[psychopath]]. Similarly, [[Sandor Rado]] had Reich as an analyst and in 1931 and declared him schizophrenic "in the most serious way". Reich's daughter, Lore Reich Rubin, a [[psychiatrist]], believed that he was [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]] and had been sexually abused as a child.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;11, 60, 167â169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharaf argued that psychoanalysts tended to dismiss as ill anyone from within the fold who had transgressed, and this was never done so relentlessly as with Reich. His work was split into the pre-psychotic "good" and the post-psychotic "bad", the date of the illness's onset depending on which parts of his work a speaker disliked. Psychoanalysts preferred to see him as sane in the 1920s because of his work on character, while political radicals regarded him as sane in the 1930s because of his Marxist-oriented research.&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p8&gt;Sharaf 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt;
-
Despite Reich's precarious mental health, his work on character and the idea of muscular armouring contributed to the development of what is now known as [[ego psychology]], gave rise to [[body psychotherapy]], and helped shape the [[Gestalt therapy]] of [[Fritz Perls]], the [[bioenergetic analysis]] of Reich's student [[Alexander Lowen]], and the [[primal therapy]] of [[Arthur Janov]].&lt;ref name=Sharaf1994p4&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;4â5, 347, 481â482.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanities===
[[File:Norman Mailer 1948 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=monochrome photograph of a man in an open-necked shirt|[[Norman Mailer]] owned several orgone accumulators.&lt;ref name=Turner2011p430/&gt;]]

Reich's work influenced a generation of intellectuals, including [[Saul Bellow]], [[William S. Burroughs|William Burroughs]] and [[Norman Mailer]], and the founder of Summerhill School in England, [[A. S. Neill]].&lt;ref name=Turnerintro/&gt; The French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] wrote in ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'' (1976) that the impact of Reich's critique of sexual repression had been substantial.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;131.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian-American philosopher [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Paul Edwards]] said that the FDA's pursuit of Reich had intensified Edwards' attachment to him. He wrote in 1977 that for years he and his friends regarded Reich as "something akin to a messiah".&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 1977, p.&amp;nbsp;43&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Mathews and John M. Bell started teaching a course on Reich in 1968 at New York University through its Division of Continuing Study, and it was still being taught at the time Sharaf was writing Reich's biography in 1983, making it the longest-running course ever taught in that division.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;481.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several well-known figures used orgone accumulators, including [[Orson Bean]], [[Sean Connery]],  [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]], [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Isaac Rosenfeld]], [[J. D. Salinger]], [[William Steig]]  and [[Robert Anton Wilson]].&lt;ref name=Turnerintro&gt;Turner 2011, introduction; also see [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/08/wilhelm-reich-free-love-orgasmatron Turner (''Guardian''), 8 July 2011]; [http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article850819.ece Murphy (''Times Literary Supplement''), 4 January 2012].&lt;/ref&gt; Mailerâwho owned several orgone accumulators, including some in the shape of eggsâwrote about Reich enthusiastically in ''The Village Voice'', as a result of which Orgonon became a place of pilgrimage and the orgasm a symbol of liberation.&lt;ref name=Turner2011p430&gt;Turner 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;430â431.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular culture===
[[File:Cloudbusting.jpg|thumb|left|alt=cover of Kate Bush's single, showing her sitting astride a reproduction of a 'cloudbuster' |"[[Cloudbusting]]" (1985) by [[Kate Bush]]]]
Reich continued to influence popular culture after his death. Turner writes that the evil Dr. Durand Durand in the feature film ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'' (1968) seems to be based on Reich; he places Barbarella ([[Jane Fonda]]) in his ''Excessive Machine'' so that she would die of pleasure, but rather than killing her the machine burns out.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, p. 445; [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/23/books/review/adventures-in-the-orgasmatron.html?pagewanted=all Turner (''The New York Times''), 23 September 2011].&lt;/ref&gt; A film about Reich and the implications of his ideas, ''[[W.R.: Mysteries of the Organism]]'' (1971), was directed by Yugoslavian director [[DuÅ¡an Makavejev]]. An orgone accumulator made an appearance as the [[Orgasmatron]] in [[Woody Allen]]'s  comedy feature film ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' (1973). The use of orgone accumulators, a cloudbuster and representations of Reich's orgone therapy with patients, together with a snapshot of the FDA's hostile actions against Reich were dramatised in a short film called 'It Can Be Done', which was made by British director Jon East in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IMDB|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367895/?ref_=nm_flmg_wr_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film screened at the 56th Venice Film Festival on 11 September 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Venicedream|url=http://www.veniceword.com/dve56movie.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patti Smith]]'s "Birdland" on her album ''[[Horses (album)|Horses]]'' (1975) is based on Reich's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120106023804/http://post45.research.yale.edu/archives/904 |url= http://post45.research.yale.edu/archives/904 |work= Post45| publisher= Yale University| title= Very Different Tonight: The Contagious Nightmares of Wilhelm Reich | first= Kim |last= Cooper| date= September 26, 2011| archivedate= January 6, 2012| deadurl= yes| access-date= September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hawkwind]]'s song "Orgone Accumulator", on their album ''[[Space Ritual]]'' (1973) is named for his invention, as is Love Camp 7's "Orgone Box" (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GLyU7PC_z7sC&amp;pg=257 | publisher= SAF Publishing Ltd| title= Hawkwind: Sonic Assassins| first= Ian |last= Abrahams| year= 2004| page=257| access-date= September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[Joey (Bob Dylan song)|Joey]]" from ''[[Desire (Bob Dylan album)|Desire]]'' (1975), the eponymous gangster spends his time in prison reading [[Nietzsche]] and Reich.

[[Kate Bush]]'s single "[[Cloudbusting]]" (1985) described Reich's arrest through the eyes of his son, Peter, who wrote his father's story in ''A Book of Dreams'' (1973). The video for the song features [[Donald Sutherland]] as Reich and Bush as Peter.&lt;ref&gt;Moy 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Wnu8DjZ6bkYC&amp;pg=PA99 99].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Anton Wilson]]'s play, ''[[Wilhelm Reich in Hell]]'' (1987), is about Reich's confrontation with the American government.&lt;ref&gt;DeMarco and Wiker 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IRfC5enFeH8C&amp;pg=PA231 231].&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Four-beat Rhythm: The Writings of Wilhelm Reich]]'' (2013) is a compilation album on which Reich's writings are adapted to music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/album/four-beat-rhythm-the-writings-of-wilhelm-reich-mw0002684609 "Four-Beat Rhythm: The Writings Of Wilhelm Reich"], AllMusic.&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian designer [[Marc Newson]] has produced a range of orgone furniture, most famously his Orgone Chair (1993).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marc-newson.com/ProjectImages.aspx?GroupSelected=0&amp;ProjectName=Orgone+Chair%0D1993+-+Pod&amp;Category=Unique%20Pieces "Orgone chair"], marc-newson.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science===
The mainstream scientific community dismissed Reich's orgone theory as [[pseudoscience]].{{refn|group=n|Kenneth S. Isaacs (psychoanalyst), 1999: "Orgoneâa useless fiction with faulty basic premises, thin partial theory, and unsubstantiated application results. It was quickly discredited and cast away."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/h8878142675lw375/ Isaacs 1999], p.&amp;nbsp;240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[[Henry H. Bauer]], 2000: "Reich's personal charisma seems to have misled some number of people into taking his 'science' seriously. His outward behavior was not inconsistent with that of a mainstream scientific investigator. In the light of everyday common sense rather than of deep technical knowledge, his ideas could seem highly defensible. For those who lack familiarity with the real science of matters Reich dealt with, why would orgone be less believable than black holes, a bounded yet infinite universe, or "dark matter"&amp;nbsp; ... ?"&lt;ref&gt;Bauer 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;159.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Jon E. Roeckelein (psychologist), 2006: "The current consensus of scientific opinion is that Reich's orgone theory is basically a psychoanalytic system gone awry, and is an approach that represents something most ludicrous and totally dismissible."&lt;ref&gt;Roeckelein 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;517â518.&lt;/ref&gt;}} James Strick, a historian of science at [[Franklin and Marshall College]], wrote in 2015 that the dominant narrative since Reich's death has been that "there is no point in looking more closely at Reich's science because there {{em|was}} no legitimate science from Reich".&lt;ref name="Strick 2015, p. 3"&gt;Strick 2015, p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1960, apparently in response to the book burning, the New York publisher [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] began republishing his major works.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1971/01/04/archives/back-into-the-old-orgone-box.html?sq=Wilhelm+Reich&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p Lehmann-Haupt, 4 January 1971]; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1211516 MacBean 1972]; Sharaf 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;480; Strick 2015, p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; Reichian physicians organized study groups. In 1967 one of his associates, Dr. Elsworth Baker, established the bi-annual ''Journal of Orgonomy'', still published as of 2015, and in 1968 founded the [[American College of Orgonomy]] in Princeton, New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;479â482; [http://www.orgonomy.org/college.html "The College"], American College of Orgonomy; [http://www.orgonomy.org/journal/journal_index/jrnl_num_42_45.html ''The Journal of Orgonomy''], The American College of Orgonomy.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sharaf, contributors to the ''Journal of Orgonomy'' who worked in academia often used pseudonyms.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;482.&lt;/ref&gt; The Orgone Biophysical Research Laboratory was founded in 1978 by James DeMeo and the Institute for Orgonomic Science in 1982 by Morton Herskowitz.&lt;ref&gt;For DeMeo: Sharaf 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;380â381; Cordon 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;422; and [http://www.orgonelab.org Orgone Biophysical Research Lab], Ashland, Oregon. For Morton Herskowitz: [http://www.orgonomicscience.org/ "Institute for Orgonomic Science"].&lt;/ref&gt;

There was renewed interest in November 2007, when the Reich archives at the [[Boston Medical Library|Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine]] at  [[Harvard University]] were unsealed; Reich had left instructions that his unpublished papers be stored for 50 years after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;519â520.&lt;/ref&gt; James Strick began studying Reich's laboratory notebooks from the 1935â1939 bion experiments in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Strick 2015, p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 [[Harvard University Press]] published Strick's ''Wilhelm Reich, Biologist'', in which he writes that Reich's work in Oslo "represented the cutting edge of light microscopy and time-lapse micro-cinematography".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674736092 ''Wilhelm Reich, Biologist''], Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the dominant narrative of Reich as a pseudoscientist is incorrect and that Reich's story is "much more complex and interesting".&lt;ref name="Strick 2015, p. 3"/&gt;

Speaking to [[Christopher Turner]] in 2011, Reich's son, Peter, said of his father, "He was a nineteenth-century scientist; he wasn't a twentieth-century scientist. He didn't practice science the way scientists do today. He was a nineteenth-century mind who came crashing into twentieth-century America. And boom!"&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;376.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Ames.jpg|thumb|right|Dr William Ames, theologian (1576â1633)]]
'''William Ames''' ({{IPAc-en|eÉª|m|z}}; [[Latin]]: ''Guilielmus Amesius''; 1576 â 14 November 1633&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|20448|William Ames}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an English [[Protestant]] divine, philosopher, and controversialist.  He spent much time in the Netherlands, and is noted for his involvement in the controversy between the [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] and the [[Arminianism|Arminians]].

==Early life and education==
Ames was born at [[Ipswich]], and was brought up by a maternal uncle, Robert Snelling of [[Boxford, Suffolk|Boxford]]. He was educated at the local grammar school and from 1594 at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=AMS593W|name=Ames, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was considerably influenced by his tutor at Christ's, [[William Perkins (Puritan)|William Perkins]], and by his successor [[Paul Bayne]]. Ames graduated BA in 1598 and [[Master of Arts|MA]] in 1601, and was chosen for a [[fellow]]ship in Christ's College.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly M. Kapic, Randall C. Gleason, ''The Devoted Life: An Invitation to the Puritan Classics'' (20040, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was popular in the university, and in his own college. One of Ames's sermons became historical in the Puritan controversies. It was delivered in the university [[Church of St Mary the Great, Cambridge]] on 21 December 1609, and in it he rebuked sharply "lusory lotts" and the "heathenish debauchery" of the students during the [[Twelve Days of Christmas]].

A partisan election, however, had led to the mastership at Christ's going to [[Valentine Carey]]. He quarrelled with Ames for disapproving of the [[surplice]] and other outward symbols. Ames's vehemence led to his being summoned before the [[Vice-Chancellor]], who suspended him "from the exercise of his [[ecclesiastical]] function and from all degrees taken or to be taken."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66653&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margo Todd, ''Providence, Chance and the New Science in Early Stuart Cambridge'', The Historical Journal, Vol. 29, No. 3 (Sep. 1986), pp. 697â711.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ministry in Holland==
He left Cambridge, and was offered a lecturer position at [[Colchester]], but [[George Abbot (Archbishop of Canterbury)|George Abbot]], the [[Bishop of London]], went against the wishes of the local corporation, and refused to grant institution and induction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=21980&lt;/ref&gt; Similar rebuffs awaited him elsewhere, and he travelled with [[Robert Parker (minister)|Robert Parker]] to the [[Netherlands]], helped by English merchants who wished him to controvert the supporters of the English church in [[Leiden]]. At [[Rotterdam]], he debated with Grevinchovius ([[Nicholas Grevinckhoven]], d. 1632), minister of the [[Arminian]] party, with reasoning from ''[[Philippians]]'' ii. 13, "It is God that worketh in us both to will and to do."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} 
This dispute made his name in the Netherlands.

Subsequently Ames entered into a controversy in print with Grevinchovius on [[universal redemption]] and election, and [[cognate]] problems. He brought together all he had maintained in his ''Coronis ad Collationem Hagiensem'' (A Finishing Touch to the Hague Conference)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apuritansmind.com/William%20Ames/WilliamAmes.htm&lt;/ref&gt;â his major book. At Leiden, Ames became intimate with [[Hugh Goodyear]], pastor of the English church there. He was sent for to [[The Hague]] by [[Sir Horatio Vere]], the English governor of [[Brielle|Brill]], who appointed him a minister in the army of the states-general, and of the English soldiers in their service. He married a daughter of [[John Burges (chaplain)|John Burges]], who was Vere's chaplain, and, on his father-in-law's return to England, succeeded to his place.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

It was at this time he began his controversy with [[Simon Episcopius]], who, in attacking the ''Coronis'', railed against the author as having been "a disturber of the public peace in his native country, so that the English magistrates had banished him thence; and now, by his late printed ''Coronis'', he was raising new disturbances in the peaceable Netherlands." Episcopius was rebutted by Goodyear,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} who became a defender of Ames against the [[Remonstrants]], and later provided Nethenus with material for his biography of Ames.&lt;ref&gt;Keith L. Sprunger, ''Dutch Puritanism: A History of English and Scottish Churches of the Netherlands in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries'' (1982), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Coronis'' had been primarily prepared for the [[Synod of Dort]], which sat from 13 November 1618 until 9 May 1619. At this synod the position of Ames was anomalous. The [[High Church]] party in England had induced Vere to dismiss him from the [[chaplaincy]]; but he was still held in reverence. It was arranged he should attend the synod, and he was retained by the [[Calvinist]] party at four [[Dutch gulden|florins]] a day to watch the proceedings. He was adviser to [[Johannes Bogerman]], the synod's President.&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Patterson, ''King James VI and I and the Reunion of Christendom'' (1997), p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic==

A proposal to make him principal of a [[theological]] college at Leiden was frustrated by [[Archbishop George Abbot|Archbishop Abbot]]; and when later invited by the state of [[Friesland]] to a professoriate at [[Franeker]], the opposition was renewed, but this time abortively. 
He was installed at Franeker on 7 May 1622 and delivered a discourse on the occasion on ''[[Urim and Thummim]]''. 
He brought renown to Franeker as professor, preacher, pastor and theological writer;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} one student of the period influenced by Ames was [[Johannes Cocceius]].&lt;ref&gt;Jan Rohls, ''Reformed Confessions: Theology from Zurich to Barmen'' (1998 translation), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another student was [[Nathaniel Eaton]], later of [[Harvard College]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis J. Bremer, Tom Webster, ''Puritans and Puritanism in Europe and America: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia'' (2006), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

He prepared his ''Medulla Theologiae'' (The Marrow of Theology), a manual of Calvinistic doctrine, for his students. Ames was much influenced in terms of method by [[Ramism]], and opposed the residual teaching of [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Willem Frijhoff, Marijke Spies, ''Dutch Culture in a European Perspective'' (2004), p. 286-7.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''De Conscientia, ejus Jure et Casibus'' (1632), an attempt to bring Christian ethics into clear relation with particular cases of conduct and of conscience, was a new thing in [[Protestantism]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Move to Rotterdam==
Having continued twelve years at Franeker (where he was [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] in 1626), his health gave way, and he contemplated a move to [[New England]]. But another door was opened for him, with an invitation to Rotterdam. There he prepared his ''Fresh Suit against Ceremonies''âthe book which made [[Richard Baxter]] a [[Nonconformist]]. It sums up the issues between the Puritan school and that of [[Richard Hooker]], and was [[Posthumous work|posthumously]] published. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Having caught a cold from a flood which inundated his house, he died in November 1633, at the age of fifty-seven, apparently in needy circumstances. He left, by a second wife Joan Fletcher, two sons and a daughter, who emigrated to Massachusetts in 1637; the sons later returned to England; his daughter Ruth married in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Edmund Angier, and their son Samuel Angier later married in 1680 Hannah Oakes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paige|first=Lucius R.|title=History of Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1630â1877|year=1877|publisher=H.

Only a small proportion was translated into English.  Ames' thought was particularly influential in New England.

'''Yashovijaya''' ({{IAST3|YaÅovijaya}}, 1624â1688), a seventeenth-century [[Jain monasticism|Jain philosopher-monk]], was a notable Indian [[Jain philosophy|philosopher]] and logician. He was a thinker, prolific writer and commentator who had a strong and lasting influence on [[Jainism]].&lt;ref name=dundas136&gt;Dundas, Paul (2004) p.136&lt;/ref&gt; He was a disciple of Muni Nayavijaya in the lineage of Jain monk Hiravijaya (belonging to the [[Tapa Gaccha]] tradition of [[Svetambara]] Jains) who influenced the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]] to [[Vegetarianism|give up eating meat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known as '''Yashovijayji''' with honorifics like '''Mahopadhyaya''' or '''Upadhyaya''' or '''Gani'''.

==Early life==
Yashovijaya was born in a village called Kanoda in the [[Mehsana]] district in [[Gujarat]] in 1624 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Wiley, Kristi (2006) p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources place his year of birth as 1608 CE. His childhood name was Jasha. He belonged to the endogamous group of [[Oswal]] Jains. He lost his father when he was very young and consequently he was brought up by his mother. The inclination towards religious life was inculcated by his mother, who often used to take him to Jain upashrayas. Young Yashovijaya attracted attention of Jain monk Nayavijayaji who was impressed by his impressive memory feat of remembering the [[Bhaktamara Stotra]] at a very young age.&lt;ref name=web&gt;{{cite web|last=Shah |first=C.P |title=Mahopadhyaya Yashovijayji |url=http://jainsamaj.org/literature/mahopadhyaya2-270106.htm |accessdate=2009-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416023826/http://jainsamaj.org/literature/mahopadhyaya2-270106.htm |archivedate=16 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life as a monk==
He was initiated as a young monk under the stewardship of Muni Nayavijaya. According to some sources, he came to [[Varanasi]] in the company of his teacher Nayavijaya, both having disguised themselves as Brahmins to get into the [[matha]].&lt;ref name=gj3&gt;Ganeri, Jonardon (2008) p.3&lt;/ref&gt; By some accounts, he was sent by his guru to Varanasi to study [[Indian logic|logic]] and [[Indian philosophy|philosophy]] along with another disciple Vinayvijaya.&lt;ref name=web /&gt; Other sources indicate, he had gone to Varanasi on his own in 1626, disguised as a Brahmin. By around 1638 he confessed that he was a Jain monk and was at once asked to leave the matha.&lt;ref name=singh&gt;Singh, Nagendra Kr, and Bibhuti Baruah (2003) p.481&lt;/ref&gt; But the sources are unanimous that for around 12 years he studied [[Sanskrit]], [[Prakrit]], logic and Metaphysics. He became skilled in the field of [[Navya-NyÄya]] branch of logic and thus earned the titles ''[[Upajjhaya]]'' (teacher), ''Nyayavisharada'' (one who is skilled in logic) and ''Nyayacarya'' (authority on logic).&lt;ref name=singh /&gt;

According to Jonardon Ganeri, Yashovijayaâs intellectual biography can be seen as falling under three heads: an apprenticeship in Varanasi studying Navyanyaya, a period writing  [[Jain philosophy|Jaina philosophical]] treatises using the techniques and methods of Navyanyaya, and a time spent writing works with a markedly spiritual and religious orientation. One of the decisive events in the process leading to this transformation was Yashovijayaâs meeting with [[Anandghan]], a Jain spiritual poet and monk.&lt;ref name=gj3 /&gt;

He was a prolific writer and is said to have authored around 100 works in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]].&lt;ref name=pali482&gt;Singh, Nagendra Kr, and Bibhuti Baruah (2003) p.482&lt;/ref&gt; After a career as a monk, philosopher, author, poet and logician, for almost 80 years, he died at [[Dabhoi]], [[Gujarat]] in 1688 CE.&lt;ref name=singh /&gt;

==Philosophy==
[[Paul Dundas]] calls Yashovijaya as the last truly great intellectual figure in [[Jainism]], who rose to fame on account of his learning and mastery of sophisticated logical techniques as well for his interest of mysticism in later life.&lt;ref name=dundas110&gt;Dundas, Paul (2002) p.110&lt;/ref&gt;  Yashovijaya often refers to the 8th Century Jain scholar-monk Acarya [[Haribhadra]] in his works, indicating that he saw himself as Haribhadra's successor. Haribhadra's reputation for being influenced only by the logical cogency of the doctrines and viewpoints ([[anekantavada]]) ultimately shaped Yashovijayas irenic but sometimes critical attitude towards other sects and traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas, Paul (2004) pp.130-131&lt;/ref&gt; Yashovijaya  had not only  studied all the great Svetambara authors from the oldest to the latest, he was also well read in important [[Digambara]] works. He wrote several important Navyanyaya works on Digambara Nyaya texts such as the Aptamimamsa of Acarya Samantabhadra. The Jain tradition is remarkably ecumenical when it comes to Nyaya and Acaryas of both the Digambara and the Shvetambara traditions have composed texts in the genre of Nyaya and the texts are read by monks and scholars of both traditions. Furthermore, Yashovijaya he was well versed in philosophy of diverse schools such as [[Vedantic]], [[Sankhya]], [[Yoga]], [[MimÄá¹sÄ]] and [[Buddhist]].&lt;ref&gt;Nagendra Kr. Singh, ed (2001) p.7301&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secular intellect and tolerance===
In his famous work, ''Adhyatmopanisatprakarana'' he argued that no body of âtheoryâ (''sastra''), whether Jain or non-Jain, is to be accepted merely on the basis of sectarian interest. Instead, the theory should be subject to testing, just as the purity of a sample of gold is determined by tests involving rubbing, cutting and heating (1.17)&lt;ref&gt;Ganeri, Jonardon (2008) p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In one of the ethical works, the ''Jnanasara'', Yashovijaya describes 32 moral and intellectual virtues that constitute a virtuous character. Out of these, two are distinctive: neutrality (''madhyasthata'') and groundedness in all view-points (''sarvanayasraya''). Neutrality is explained in terms of the dispassionate use of reason: a person who embodies this virtue follows wherever reason leads, rather than using reason only to defend prior opinions (16.2). Yashovijaya stresses that neutrality is not an end in itself, but a means to another end. We adopt a neutral attitude, he says, in the hope it leads to well-being (hita), just as someone who knows that one among a group of herbs is restorative but does not know which one it is, acts reasonably if they swallow the entire lot (16.8).&lt;ref&gt;Ganeri, Jonardon (2008) p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conception of self===
Yashovijaya  authored two famous texts â ''Adhyatmasara''  and ''Adhyatmopanisatprakarana''â that analyses the true nature of self. Yashovijaya describes the state of true self-awareness as a state beyond deep sleep, beyond conceptualisation, and beyond linguistic representation, and he says that it is the duty of any good sastra to point out the existence and possibility of such states of true self-awareness, for they cannot be discovered by reason or experience alone.&lt;ref&gt;Ganeri, Jonardon (2008) pp. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; Yashovijaya argues that from the standpoint of ''niscaya naya'' (real standpoint) the soul is called ''jiva'' if it leads an embodied life. This is different than [[Kundakunda]]âs view of ''niscaya naya'', that only a soul that possesses the most essential property of the soul&amp;mdash;cognitive capacity&amp;mdash;is jiva. This means that according to Kundakunda only a released soul is jiva from the standpoint of ''niscaya naya''. While both position have valid logic, Yashovijaya criticised this view as it had no support from any prior authors.&lt;ref&gt;Nagendra Kr. Singh, ed (2001) p. 7303&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual critic and criticisms===
Yashovijaya stressed that neutrality does not mean acceptance of every position whatever, but acceptance only of those that satisfy at least the minimal criteria of clarity and coherence needed to legitimately constitute a point of view.&lt;ref name=gj6&gt;Ganeri, Jonardon (2008) p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Hence he criticised the [[Carvaka]] philosophy as being too confused in their understanding of the topic of liberation even to be said to have a âviewâ.&lt;ref name=gj6 /&gt; He also confronted the Brahmin scholar [[Raghunatha Siromani]], one of the greatest exponent of modern logic during his time, thus proving his extraordinary talent.&lt;ref name=pali482 /&gt; Paul Dundas notes that, Yashovijaya also criticized the famous [[Digambara]] Jain monk [[Kundakunda]] for his more reliance on one standpoint. He also strongly attacked the laity based Adhyatmika sect whose de-emphasis on the role of rituals and ascetics was derived from works of [[Kundakunda]] and his commentators.&lt;ref name=dundas110 /&gt; At the same time, Yashovijaya also opposed the views of [[Svetambara]] monk Dharmasagara for his supremacist perspective of Jainism and exclusivist refusal to accept validity of any religious path except that of [[Tapa Gachchha]] (a sub-sect of Svetambara Jains).&lt;ref&gt;Dundas, Paul (2004) p.130&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his eminence and influence, one criticism leveled against Yashovijaya is that he is best known for his Navya-Nyaya commentaries of earlier existing works rather than his own original works. Furthermore, his works on Yoga, dhyana, grammar and poetry did not gain much fame, as the works of Haribhadra and Hemacandra on these topics were already established and famous by the time Yashovijaya came on the scene. His fame largely rests on his mastery of ''navyanyaya'', for which he had no contemporary rival. This could be because, for almost six centuries between Hemacandra and Yashovijaya, Jainism did not produce any able scholar on philosophy of ''nyaya''.&lt;ref&gt;The pre-eminent Jain scholars on ''[[nyaya]]'' philosophy are: Acarya Samantabhadra (2nd or 3rd century CE), Acarya Akalanka (4th or 5th century CE), Acarya [[Siddhasena Divakara]] (5th century CE), Acarya [[Haribhadra]] (7th century CE), Acarya Manikyanandi (10th century CE), Acarya Vidyanandi (10th century CE), Acarya Prabhacandra (10th century CE), Acarya [[Hemacandra]] (11th century CE) and finally Upadhyaya Yashovijaya (17th century CE)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and legacy==
Yashovijaya left behind a vast body of literature that exerted a vast influence on the [[Jain philosophy]]. After Acarya [[Haribhadra]] and Acarya [[Hemacandra]], Upadhyaya Yashovijaya is the most high-profile Jain monk. Dundas notes that Yashovijaya enjoys a near talismanic figure for the contemporary Svetambara monastic community and is identified with ''madhyastha'' or principle of neutrality.&lt;ref name=dundas131&gt;Dundas, Paul (2004) p.131&lt;/ref&gt; Dundas further notes that Yashovijaya paints a superior picture of Jainism with his inclusivism and it is this image of Jainism that has become a dominant one today.&lt;ref name=dundas136 /&gt; He had an influence on [[Shrimad Rajchandra|Srimad Rajcandraâs]] book ''[[Atmasiddhi]]'' wherein, he has provided six fundamental truths on soul and liberation following Yashovijaya's Adhyatmasara.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Atmasiddhi'', Sirmad propounded six fundamental truths of true religionâ"Soul exists, it is eternal, soul is doer of its action, it is the enjoyer of its action, liberation exists and there exists a path to liberation." Yashovijaya in ''Adhyatmasara'' had already propounded these truth, albeit in negative fashion, through his verseâ''Nasti, na nityo, na karta// na bhokta na cha nivrutah// Tadupayascha netyaahuh// mithyatvasya padani sat//'' translated as "to believe that there is no soul, it is not eternal, it is not the author, it is not the sufferer, there is no liberation and there is no path to achieve the salvation are the six steps of faithlessness."&lt;/ref&gt; A college called Jain Yashovijaya Pathashala has been established in Varanasi in his memory, under auspices of which the sacred Jain texts are being published in a series called Jain Yashovijaya Granthamala.&lt;ref name=pali482 /&gt; The Jain community of [[Ahmedabad]] has honoured him by naming one block as Yashovijaya Chowk at the Relief Road end of Ratanpol where Yashovijaya lived for many years.&lt;ref name=dundas131 /&gt;
