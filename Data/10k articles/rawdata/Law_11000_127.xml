'''António Castanheira Neves''' (born 8 November 1929 in [[Tábua]]) is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[philosophy of law|legal philosopher]] and a [[professor|professor emeritus]] at the [[faculty of law|law faculty]] of the [[University of Coimbra]].

According to Castanheira Neves, law can only be understood through ''legal problems'' (roughly, [[legal case]]s), which have to be solved within the [[law|legal system]] (including a necessary connection to [[morality]]). Law, he claims, is not something given or previous, but the solution to legal problems. Legal problems are the decisive starting point. His opposition to [[legal positivism|positivism]], to [[natural law]] and to the several theories of [[legal syllogism]] would make him one of the first and most accomplished advocates of [[Interpretivism (legal)|interpretivism]].

Castanheira Neves, however, has always claimed that law — the task of lawyers — is not essentially interpretive or [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]], but [[Practical reason|practical]], ''i.e.'', [[philosophy of action|action guiding]]. He maintains that legal interpretation is not a necessary feature of legal reasoning. On the contrary, law always arises from legal problems, which are [[Concrete (philosophy)|concrete]], historically situated, [[norm (philosophy)|normative]], and practical. Every legal decision aims to settle what someone (legally) ''ought to do'' in a particular case in a particular historical (and social) situation, and that is its [[definition|defining]] feature. A legal decision is also itself an action. Interpretation is not always needed and, when it is, it is auxiliary.

The central tenets of Castanheira Neves' philosophy of law were made clear in his 1967 massive book on the philosophical and methodological distinction between [[question of fact|matter of fact and matter of law]]. Castanheira Neves addresses the similarities and significant differences between his and [[Ronald Dworkin|Dworkin]]'s theses in the last part of his 2003 book.

Castanheira Neves also claims that there is no law ''in'' general norms (rules, principles, etc.) as laid down by legislators, but only in solving particular cases. To this thesis, he calls "jurisprudentialism".

:Law is not an element, but a synthesis, not a premise for validity, but fulfilled validity, not a prius, but a posterius, not a given, but a solution, it is not in the beginning, but in the end. (Castanheira Neves, 1967, p. 586)

In this, he was preceded by authors like [[Theodor Viehweg|Viehweg]] and schools of thought like [[critical legal studies]], but he differed from these authors as he claimed it to be essential to law as a normative matter, and not only descriptively. His position is therefore equivalent, in this subject, to [[Jonathan Dancy|J. Dancy's]] later [[moral particularism]]. Castanheira Neves would come to agree with [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer's]] dictum that all interpretation is application (as Dworkin did).

The '''Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy''' ('''AEPS''') (sometimes referred to as the '''Finnish Initiative''')&lt;ref name="office"/&gt; is a multilateral, non-binding  agreement&lt;ref name="russell"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arcticcircle.uconn.edu/NatResources/Policy/uspolicy1.html |title=The Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy &amp; the New Arctic Council |accessdate=2008-09-23 |last=Russell |first=Bruce A. |work= |publisher=| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081011021542/http://arcticcircle.uconn.edu/NatResources/Policy/uspolicy1.html| archivedate= 11 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; among [[Arctic]] states on [[environmental protection]] in the Arctic.  Discussions began in 1989, with the AEPS adopted in June 1991 by [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], the [[Soviet Union]], and the [[United States]]. The AEPS deals with monitoring, assessment, protection, emergency preparedness/response, and conservation of the Arctic zone.&lt;ref name="carc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carc.org/pubs/v21no4/protect.htm |title=The Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy |accessdate=2008-09-23 
 |publisher=carc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been called a major political accomplishment of the [[post–Cold War era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oceans and Environmental Security: Shared Us and Russian Perspectives |editor-last=Broadus |editor-first=J.M. |editor-last2=Vartanov |editor-first2=R.V. |year=1994 |publisher=Island Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=1-55963-235-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X6t8cDhn0_MC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=%22Arctic+Environmental+Protection+Strategy+%22 |pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In January 1989, Finland sent a letter to the other Arctic states proposing a conference on protection of the Arctic [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].&lt;ref&gt;Rothwell, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rovaniemi]] Meeting of September 1989 established two working groups.  This was followed by the second consultative meeting in [[Yellowknife]], [[Northwest Territories]], [[Canada]] in April 1990 where a third ''ad hoc'' group was established to develop the strategy.  It also resulted in the preparation of a draft document. [[Kiruna]], Sweden was the site of the third meeting, held in January 1991, where one group worked on the drafting the AEPS while another dealt with specific [[environmental issues]].

==Adoption==
Government officials from all the Arctic nations convened in Rovaniemi in June 1991 for the last consultative meeting.  The first three days included meetings, followed by a ministerial-level meeting on 13–14 June observed by representatives from [[Germany]], [[Poland]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United Nations]].

Three [[indigenous people]]s' organizations observed, participated, assisted in developing the strategy, and later became Permanent Participants in the Arctic Council: the [[Saami Council]], the [[Inuit Circumpolar Conference]], and the Association of Indigenous Minorities of the North, [[Indigenous peoples of Siberia|Siberia]] and the Far East of the Russian Federation.&lt;ref name="russell"/&gt; They considered the Rovaniemi ministerial meeting to be "historic" as it represented the first time that Arctic indigenous peoples participated in an international declaration's preparation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Northern Notes |volume=IV |pages=21–32 |url=http://arcticcircle.uconn.edu/NatResources/Policy/tennberg.html |title=CONTRIBUTING TO THE AEPS: INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE |accessdate=2008-09-23 |last=Tennberg |first=Monica |date=December 1996 |work= |publisher=uconn.edu| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081011023154/http://arcticcircle.uconn.edu/NatResources/Policy/tennberg.html| archivedate= 11 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 June 1991, the AEPS and the Declaration on the Protection of the Arctic Environment ("Rovaniemi Declaration") were formally adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Polar Regions and the Development of International Law |last=Rothwell |first=Donald |year=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-56182-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xslq-KwOpqoC&amp;pg=PA231&amp;lpg=PA231&amp;dq=%22Arctic+Environmental+Protection+Strategy+%22 |pages=231–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main objectives were listed as,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Preserving environmental quality and natural resources, accommodating environmental protection principals with the needs and traditions of Arctic Native peoples, monitoring environmental conditions, and reducing and eventually eliminating pollution in the Arctic Environment."&lt;ref name="office"&gt;{{cite book |title=Nuclear Wastes in the Arctic: An Analysis of Arctic and Other Regional Impacts from Soviet Nuclear Contamination. |last=Office of Technology Assessment Washington DC |year=1995 |publisher=Defense Technical Information Center SEP |location=Ft.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Follow-up==
The AEPS outlined five objectives and six pollution issues.&lt;ref&gt;Rothwell, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;  Legal issues included its jurisdictional reach and extent of obligations for the member states.&lt;ref&gt;Rothwell, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; Data-gathering, information compilation, and assessment tasks were organized around these issues.&lt;ref name="vidas"&gt;{{cite book |title=Protecting the Polar Marine Environment: Law and Policy for Pollution Prevention |last=Vidas |first=Davor Vidas |year=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-66311-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i4ocFzO3pEgC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=%22Arctic+Environmental+Protection+Strategy+%22 |pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 1993 follow-up meeting in [[Nuuk]], [[Greenland]], ministers endorsed expanding the AEPS in order to deal with sustainable development,&lt;ref name="carc"/&gt; and issued the Nuuk Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arctic-council.npolar.no/Archives/AEPS%20Docs/Arctic%20Council%C2%A0_%C2%A0The%20Nuuk%20Declaration.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707080656/http://arctic-council.npolar.no/Archives/AEPS%20Docs/Arctic%20Council%C2%A0_%C2%A0The%20Nuuk%20Declaration.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-07 |title=The Nuuk Declaration |accessdate=2008-09-23 |last=Ministers of the Arctic Countries |first= |date=1993-09-16 |work= |publisher=npolar.no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another meeting occurred in 1996 in [[Inuvik]], [[Northwest Territories]], [[Canada]], resulting in the Inuvik Declaration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intfish.net/docs/1993/arctic/inuvik.htm |title=Inuvik Declaration |accessdate=2008-09-23 |author=Ministers of the Arctic Countries |date=1996-03-21 |work= |publisher=intfish.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618164817/http://www.intfish.net/docs/1993/arctic/inuvik.htm |archivedate=June 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the establishment of the [[Arctic Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-cger.nies.go.jp/geo1/ch/ch3_31.htm |title=Chapter 3: Policy Responses and Directions |accessdate=2008-09-23 |last=Global Environment Outlook-1 |year=1997 |work=United Nations Environment Programme, Global State of the Environment Report |publisher=nies.go.jp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310050315/http://www-cger.nies.go.jp/geo1/ch/ch3_31.htm |archivedate=2005-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last meeting, held in 1997 in [[Alta, Norway]]&lt;ref name="vidas"/&gt; following the AEPS's 1996 absorption into the [[Arctic Council]] resulted in the Alta Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arctic-council.npolar.no/Archives/AEPS%20Docs/Arctic%20Council%C2%A0_%C2%A0The%20Alta%20Declaration.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708105830/http://arctic-council.npolar.no/Archives/AEPS%20Docs/Arctic%20Council%C2%A0_%C2%A0The%20Alta%20Declaration.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-08 |title=The Alta Declaration |accessdate=2008-09-23 |last=Ministers of the Arctic countries |date=1997-06-13 |work= |publisher=npolar.no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics of the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy argue that it:
#Lacks ongoing political attention and direction, along with financial commitment.&lt;ref name="carc"/&gt; 
#Lacks the legal authority of a treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Pfirman |last=S.L. |author2=Hajost, S.A.|author3=Crane, K. |title=We Have to Protect No-Longer-Pristine Arctic |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3D81630F93AA15751C1A964958260 |work= |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=1992-12-29 |accessdate=2008-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Buenos Aires Convention''' (Third [[Pan-American Convention]]) is a [[copyright]] [[treaty]] signed at [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], on 11 August 1910, providing mutual recognition of copyrights where the work carries a notice containing a statement of reservation of rights (Art.&amp;nbsp;3). This was commonly done with the phrase "[[All rights reserved]]" (Spanish "''Todos los derechos reservados''", [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] "''Todos os direitos reservados''") next to the copyright notice. This implementation varied as US law only required the author and year of publishing. Copyright protection under the Convention is granted for the shorter of the terms of the protecting country and the source country of the work ("[[rule of the shorter term]]", Arts.&amp;nbsp;6, 7). The rather vague nature of the requirement for a statement of reservation led to the development of longer and more legalistic wordings, which have persisted despite the developments in [[international copyright law]].

The Convention is specifically retained by the [[Universal Copyright Convention]] (UCC) of 6 September 1952 (Art.&amp;nbsp;18 Geneva Act),{{ref|UCC}} with the most recent formulation taking precedence in case of conflict. As the Buenos Aires Convention was not modified, the presence of a simple copyright notice was sufficient to ensure mutual recognition of copyright between countries which became parties to the UCC (which only [[Honduras]] never did). As of {{Start date|df=yes|2000|08|23}}, all parties to the Buenos Aires Convention are also parties to the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]], which provides for mutual recognition of copyright without any [[copyright formalities|formalities]] (Art.&amp;nbsp;5.2 Berne).{{ref|Berne}}

The Buenos Aires Convention became a "special agreement" in the terms of Article&amp;nbsp;20 of the Berne Convention. It remains in force, notably for determining the source country of a work and hence the term of protection which is applicable in countries which apply the "rule of the shorter term":{{ref|shorterterm}} when a work is simultaneously published in a Convention State and a non-Convention State, the Convention State will be taken to be the source country regardless of the term of protection in the non-Convention State.

'''''Collins v. Wilcock''''' (1984) was a case of [[trespass to the person]] focusing on [[Battery (crime)|battery]].  Expanding on Lord Holt's definition of intent in ''Cole v.

A battery is committed when a person intentionally and recklessly harms someone directly." But it also says this: “An offense of Common Assault is committed when a person either assaults another person or commits a battery.” It notes that the only distinction between common assault and causing actual bodily harm (under section 47 of the Offenses against the Person Act 1861) is the degree of injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawteacher.net/cases/tort-law/trespass-to-person-cases.php |title=Trespass To The Person &amp;#124; Tort Law Cases |publisher=Law Teacher |date= |accessdate=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Commission on Scottish Devolution''', ({{lang-gd|Coimisean Fèin-riaghlaidh na h-Alba}}, {{lang-sco|Commeessioun on Scots Devolutioun}}), also referred to as the '''Calman Commission''', '''Scottish Parliament Commission'''&lt;ref name="holyrood.com"&gt;[http://www.holyrood.com/content/view/2268/10552/ holyrood.com - The Business of Politics - Pro union devolution review launched&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Review'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/2008/03/26/glasgow-university-chancellor-to-chair-scottish-parliament-review-86908-20362888/ Glasgow University chancellor to chair Scottish parliament review - The Daily Record&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; was established by an opposition [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour Party]] motion passed by the [[Scottish Parliament]] on 6 December 2007, with the support of the [[Scottish Conservative Party|Conservatives]] and [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-07/sor1206-02.htm#Col4133 The Scottish Parliament - Official Report&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The governing [[Scottish National Party]] opposed the creation of the commission.

Its terms of reference were: "To review the provisions of the [[Scotland Act 1998]] in the light of experience and to recommend any changes to the present constitutional arrangements that would enable the Scottish Parliament to serve the people of [[Scotland]] better, improve the financial accountability of the Scottish Parliament and continue to secure the position of Scotland within the [[United Kingdom]]."&lt;ref name="holyrood.com"/&gt;

The Commission held its first full meeting at the [[Scottish Parliament]] on 28 April 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.scotsman.com/politics/Big-Brother-winner-joins-the.4024907.jp | location=Edinburgh | work=The Scotsman | first=Gerri | last=Peev | title=Big Brother winner joins the Constitutional Commission team | date=2008-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and met at roughly monthly intervals&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commissiononscottishdevolution.org.uk/uploads/2008-04-28-minutes-commission.pdf Commission on Scottish Devolution - Minutes of 1st Meeting]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; during its period of work.

It issued a first report on 2 December 2008, and a final report on 15 June 2009.  It was accountable to both the Scottish Parliament and the UK Government.

The Commission on Scottish Devolution should not be confused with the [[Scottish Constitutional Commission]], which is an independent [[think-tank]].

'''Calman Plus''' (also called '''devolution plus''', '''Devo Plus''' or '''Devo 2.0''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-15898963|title=Reform Scotland group to look at 'devolution plus'|date=26 November 2011|work=BBC News Scotland|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been advocated by senior [[Scottish Liberal Democrat]] politicians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/support_for_calman_plus_1_1366512|title=Support for 'Calman Plus' |date=29 May 2010|work=The Scotsman|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/michael_moore_defies_holyrood_cash_calls_1_1366678|title=Moore said he will not consider any major extension to the Calman proposals.

Calman Plus should not be confused with [[full fiscal autonomy]], although neither concept has been definitively defined.

==Membership==
The Commission has 15 members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7371693.stm | work=BBC News | title=Devolution body members announced | date=2008-04-28 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commissiononscottishdevolution.org.uk/members.html Members of the Commission on Scottish Devolution]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; including nominees of the three [[Unionism in Scotland|Unionist parties]], representatives of business, trade unions, academia and community organisations.

==Task groups==
The Commission established five task groups to assist it in its work.  These met in between meetings of the full Commission.  The task groups and their chairs are as follows:
*Principles - Sir Kenneth Calman
*Functions - Professor Sir David Edward
*Engagement - Murdoch MacLennan
*Financial Accountability - Shonaig Macpherson
*Inter-Governmental Relations - Jim Wallace

==Independent expert group==
There is also an independent expert group established to advise the Commission on financial accountability.  This is chaired by Professor [[Anton Muscatelli]], Vice-Chancellor and Principal of [[Heriot-Watt University]], and includes academics from Scotland, the rest of the UK and overseas.  It produced a detailed report for the Commission in November 2008, examining different models for funding sub-national parliaments, and suggesting that a mixture of grant funding, tax devolution and tax assignment was likely to be necessary in a Scottish context.  In June 2009, the IEG published further reports on borrowing and on natural resource taxation, plus a response to some of the Commission's consultation questions.

==First report==
The Commission's first report, released in December 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/02_12_08_calman.pdf |title=The Future of Scottish Devolution within the Union: A First Report |date=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; declared that devolution had been a success, while making the case for Scotland's continued place within the United Kingdom.  On funding, it endorsed the view of the independent expert group that full fiscal autonomy is incompatible with the continuation of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7759382.stm |title=Full Scots fiscal power ruled out |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Report launched a second phase of consultation, inviting further evidence on a wide range of questions (encapsulated in an accompanying consultation document) by the end of February 2009.

==Final report==
The Commission's final report was published on 15 June 2009.

The main conclusions and recommendations are:
* that devolution has been a success, and is here to stay
* that the Scottish Parliament should have substantially greater control over the raising of the revenues that make up the [[Scottish budget]], primarily through sharing with the UK Parliament responsibility for setting income tax rates (although the number of rates, the differences between them, eligibility and so on should remain wholly UK responsibilities) and through devolution of some smaller taxes ([[Air Passenger Duty]], [[Landfill Tax]], the [[Aggregates Levy]] and [[Stamp Duty Land Tax]])
* that the UK should reduce income tax rates in Scotland by 10p (on the basic and higher rates), and reduce the block grant by a corresponding amount, thus requiring the Scottish Parliament to make a tax decision (i.e. whether to restore the 10p or to set a Scottish rate that is higher or lower than the rate in the rest of the UK)
* that the reduced block grant should continue to be calculated through the Barnett formula in the short term, but that a UK-wide needs assessment should replace it in the longer term
* that the Scottish Government should have new borrowing powers to cover capital projects, as well as possibly enhanced access to short-term borrowing
* that responsibility for the regulation of airguns, the administration of elections, drink-driving limits and the national speed limit should be devolved
* that the regulation of health professions and corporate insolvency, currently largely reserved, should be fully reserved; and that there should be single UK definitions of "charity" and "charitable purposes"
* greater involvement of Scottish Ministers in key decisions and appointments relating to UK bodies such as the BBC, the [[Crown Estate]] and the [[Health and Safety Executive]]
* that there should be better inter-parliamentary dialogue and communication, including through removing barriers to joint working of committees, having Scottish Ministers attending UK Parliament committees and UK Ministers attending the Scottish Parliament (including to outline the implications of the annual Queen's Speech), and establishing a joint liaison committee
* enhancement of the Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) structure, including by creation of new sub-committees, and the production of an annual report
* development of the existing [[Sewel Convention]], including through entrenchment in Westminster standing orders, Scottish MPs being represented on committees scrutinising Bills that engage the Convention, and better communication between the Parliaments, including on "legislative consent motions" under the Convention
* the creation of a new mechanism to enable the Scottish Parliament to legislate on reserved matters with the UK Parliament's consent (by order)
* enhanced procedures for Scottish Parliamentary scrutiny of Bills, including splitting the existing Stage 3 into two stages, and creating a presumption that amendments at Stage 3 to introduce substantial new provisions will be referred back to committee
* a requirement that anyone introducing a Bill (not just a Minister) needs to state that the Bill is within the Parliament's legislative competence, and give reasons for that view.

==Calman Review white paper==
Responding to the findings of the review, the British Government announced on 25 November 2009, that new powers would be devolved to the Scottish Government, notably on how it can raise tax and carry out capital borrowing, and the running of Scottish Parliament elections.&lt;ref name=BBC25Nov09NewPowersAfterCalman/&gt; These proposals were detailed in a [[white paper]] setting out a new Scotland Bill, to become law before the 2015 Holyrood elections.&lt;ref name=BBC25Nov09NewPowersAfterCalman/&gt; The proposal was criticised by the British Parliament opposition parties for not proposing to implement any changes before the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|next general election]]. Scottish Constitution Minister [[Michael Russell (politician)|Michael Russell]] criticised the white paper, calling it "flimsy" and stating that their proposed [[Referendum (Scotland) Bill, 2010]], whose own white paper was to be published five days later, would be "more substantial".&lt;ref name=BBC25Nov09NewPowersAfterCalman&gt;{{cite news

The United Kingdom [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]-[[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition]] government which was [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|elected in 2010]] pledged to implement the findings of the Calman Commission&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8693832.stm Policy-by-policy: The coalition government's plans]&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently used them as the basis for the [[Scotland Act 2012]].

The '''Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968''' (c. 9) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].

The Act amended the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962]], further reducing rights of citizens of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] countries (as of 2010, comprising approximately 1.9 billion people, including [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], The [[Republic of India]], [[Islamic Republic of Pakistan]] (which included [[Bangladesh|East Pakistan]] [[province]]), some [[Africa]]n nations including [[Nigeria]] and many [[Caribbean islands]]) to [[immigration to the United Kingdom|migrate to the UK]].

The 1968 Act barred the future right of entry previously enjoyed by [[Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies]], to those born there or who had at least one parent or grandparent born there. It was introduced amid concerns that up to 200,000 [[Indians in Kenya|Kenyan Asians]] fleeing that country's "Africanization" policy, would take up their right to reside in the UK. The bill went through parliament in three days, supported by the leadership of both the governing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and main opposition [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] parties, though opposed by Labour backbenchers, a few Conservatives such as [[Iain Macleod]] and [[Michael Heseltine]], and the small parliamentary [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=When Labour played the racist card |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/when-labour-played-racist-card |author=Mark Lattimer |accessdate=1 Mar 2012 |date=22 January 1999 |work=[[New Statesman]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1968 Act was superseded by the [[Immigration Act 1971]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24867">In regulatory jurisdictions that provide for it (comprising most or all [[developed country|developed countries]] with [[free market]] economies), '''consumer protection''' is a group of laws and organizations designed to ensure the [[rights]] of [[consumers]] as well as [[fair trade]], competition and accurate information in the [[marketplace]]. The laws are designed to prevent the businesses that engage in [[fraud]] or specified [[Anti-competitive practices|unfair practices]] from gaining an advantage over competitors. They may also provide additional protection for those most vulnerable in society. Consumer protection laws are a form of government [[regulation]] that aim to protect the rights of consumers. For example, a government may require businesses to disclose detailed information about products—particularly in areas where safety or public health is an issue, such as food.

Consumer protection is linked to the idea of '''consumer rights''' and to the formation of [[consumer organizations]], which help consumers make better choices in the marketplace and get help with [[consumer complaints]]. Other organizations that promote consumer protection include government organizations and self-regulating business organizations such as consumer protection agencies and organizations, [[ombudsman|ombudsmen]], the [[Federal Trade Commission]] in America and [[Better Business Bureau]]s in America and Canada, etc.

A consumer is defined as someone who acquires goods or services for direct use or ownership rather than for resale or use in production and manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;"West Encyclopedia of American Law. Consumer. Answers.com. n.d.. Retrieved on January 31, 2010"&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumer interests can also be protected by promoting competition in the markets which directly and indirectly serve consumers, consistent with economic efficiency, but this topic is treated in [[competition law]]. Consumer protection can also be asserted via non-government organizations and individuals as [[consumer activism]].

==Consumer law==
Consumer protection law or consumer law is considered as an area of law that regulates [[private law]] relationships between individual consumers and the businesses that sell those goods and services. Consumer protection covers a wide range of topics, including but not necessarily limited to [[product liability]], [[privacy rights]], [[unfair business practices]], [[fraud]], [[misrepresentation]], and other consumer/business interactions. It's a way of preventing frauds and scams from service and sales contracts, eligible fraud, bill collector regulation, pricing, utility turnoffs, consolidation, [[personal loans]] that may lead to [[bankruptcy]].

The following lists consumer legislation at the nation-state level. In the EU member states Germany and the United Kingdom there is also the applicability of law at the EU level to be considered; this applies on the basis of [[subsidiarity]].

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the corresponding agency is the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] or the individual State Consumer Affairs agencies. The [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]] has responsibility for consumer protection regulation of financial services and products. However, in practice, it does so through privately run EDR schemes such as the [[Financial Ombudsman Service (Australia)]].

===Nigeria===
The Nigerian government has a duty to protect its people from any form of harm to human health through the use and purchase of items to meet daily needs. In light of this, the [[Nigerian Consumer Protection Council (CPC)]], whose aim is to protect and enhance consumers' interest through information, education, and enforcement of the rights of consumers was established by an Act of Parliament  to promote and protect the interest of consumers over all products and services. In a nutshell, it is empowered to Eliminate hazardous &amp; substandard goods from the market. Provide speedy redress to consumer complaints and petition arisen from fraud, unfair practice and exploitation of consumer.
 
===Germany===

[[Germany]], as a member state of the [[European Union]], is bound by the consumer protection [[European Directive|directives]] of the European Union; residents may be directly bound by EU regulations.
A minister of the federal cabinet is responsible for consumer rights and protection (''Verbraucherschutzminister''). In the current cabinet of [[Angela Merkel]], this is [[Daniel Lindigrin]].

When issuing public warnings about products and services, the issuing authority has to take into account that this affects the supplier's constitutionally protected economic liberty, see [[Bundesverwaltungsgericht]] (Federal Administrative Court) Case 3 C 34.84, 71 BVerwGE 183).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oefre.unibe.ch/law/dfr/vw071183.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
{{See also|Consumer Protection Act of 1986|National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission}}

In [[India]], consumer protection is specified in The Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Under this law, Separate Consumer Dispute Redress Forums  have been set up throughout India in each and every district in which a consumer can file his complaint on a simple paper with nominal court fees and his complaint will be decided by the Presiding Officer of the District Level.  The complaint can be filed by both the consumer of a goods as well as of the services. An appeal could be filed to the State Consumer Disputes Redress Commissions and after that to the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncdrc.nic.in/|title=NATIONAL CONSUMER DISPUTES REDRESSAL COMMISSION|website=ncdrc.nic.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The procedures in these [[tribunal]]s are relatively less formal and more people friendly and they also take less time to decide upon a consumer dispute&lt;ref name="CONSUMER PROTECTION AND NATIONAL CONSUMER DISPUTES REDRESS COMMISSION"&gt;V. Balakrishna Eradi, [http://ncdrc.nic.in/|publisher=NCDRC "Consumer Protection and National Consumer Disputes Redress Commission"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721172525/http://ncdrc.nic.in/ |date=July 21, 2011 }}. New Delhi: [[National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission]]. Accessed 25 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; when compared to the years long time taken by the traditional [[Indian judiciary]]. In recent years, many effective judgment have been passed by some state and National Consumer Forums.

[[Indian Contract Act, 1872]] lays down the conditions in which promises made by parties to a contract will be legally binding on each other. It also lays down the remedies available to aggregate party if the other party fails to honor his promise.

[[The Sale of Goods Act of 1930]] act provides some safeguards to buyers of goods if goods purchased do not fulfill the express or implied conditions and warranties.

[[The Agriculture Produce Act of 1937]] act provides grade standards for agricultural commodities and live stock products.It specifies the conditions which govern the use of standards and lays down the procedure for grading, marking and packaging of agricultural produce.The quality mark provided under the act is known as AGMARK-Agricultural Marketing.

===Taiwan===
Modern Taiwanese law has been heavily influenced by European civil law systems, particularly German and Swiss law. The Civil Code in Taiwan contains five books: General Principles, Obligations, Rights over Things, Family, and Succession. The second book of the Code, the Book of Obligations, provided the basis from which consumers could bring products liability actions prior to the enactment of the CPL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://luatcanhtranhvabaovenguoitieudung.wordpress.com/2011/06/01/taiwan-consumer-protection-law/|title=(TAIWAN) CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW|date=1 June 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/news/news_detail.aspx?id=189|title=Laws &amp; Regulations Database of The Republic of China|website=law.moj.gov.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Consumer Protection Law (CPL)]] in [[Taiwan]], as promulgated on January 11, 1994, and effective on January 13, 1993, specifically protects the interests and safety of customers using the products or services provided by business operators. The Consumer Protection Commission of Executive Yuan serves as an ombudsman supervising, coordinating, reporting any unsafe products/services and periodically reviewing the legislation.

According to the Pacific Rim Law &amp; Policy Association and the American Chamber of Commerce, in a 1997 critical study, the law has been criticized by stating that "although many agree that the intent of the CPL is fair, the CPL's various problems, such as ambiguous terminology, favoritism towards consumer protection groups, and the compensation liability defense, must be addressed before the CPL becomes a truly effective piece of legislation that will protect consumers"&lt;ref&gt;Carol T. Juang, [http://digital.law.washington.edu/dspace-law/bitstream/handle/1773.1/885/6PacRimLPolyJ219.pdf?sequence=1 "The Taiwan Consumer Protection Law: Attempt to Protect Consumers Proves Ineffective"] Pacific Rim Law &amp; Policy Association, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The [[United Kingdom]], as it is still a member state of the [[European Union]], is bound by the consumer protection [[European Directive|directives]] of the European Union; residents may be directly bound by EU regulations. Specifics of the division of labour between the EU and the UK are detailed here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU law and the balance of competences: A short guide and glossary, 2012|url=http://www.gov.uk/guidance/eu-law-and-the-balance-of-competences-a-short-guide-and-glossary|publisher=Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic (UK) laws originated within the ambit of [[contract]] and [[tort]] but, with the influence of [[EU law]], it is emerging as an independent area of law. In many circumstances, where domestic law is in question, the matter judicially treated as [[tort]], [[contract]], [[restitution]] or even [[criminal law]].

Consumer Protection issues are dealt with when complaints are made to the [[Director-General of Fair Trading|Director-General of Fair Trade]]. The [[Office of Fair Trading]]&lt;ref name="U.K. OFT"&gt;[http://www.oft.gov.uk/ U.K. Office of Fair Trading], 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; will then investigate, impose an injunction or take the matter to [[litigation]]. However, consumers cannot directly complain to the OFT. Complaints need to be made to the Citizens Advice Consumer Service (which has taken over from Consumer Direct) who will provide legal advice to complainants, or re-direct the individual complaint to Trading Standards for investigation. Due to restrictions within the Enterprise Act 2002, individual complainants are unable to be told whether their case is being investigated or not. In very rare cases, Consumer Direct may direct a very large number of complaints to the OFT to be considered as a systemic complaint. The OFT can also be engaged by consumer groups e.g. The Consumers Association or the statutory consumer protection body – Consumer Focus – via a super complaint. The OFT rarely prosecute companies, however, preferring a light touch regulation approach. Consumer complaints against companies are not published, but investigation work, undertakings, and enforcement are located at.&lt;ref&gt;U.K. Office of Fair Trading, [http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/consumer-enforcement/ "Consumer Enforcement"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313020125/http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/consumer-enforcement/ |date=2011-03-13 }}, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the consumer protection laws e.g. Distance Selling Regulations 2000 or Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 ({{Time ago|1999|magnitude=years}}) are actually UK implementations of EU directives. The OFT is one of the bodies responsible for enforcing these rules. It leads to a problem that these examples of legislation are clearly designed to deal with individual complaints but the OFT will only deal with systemic complaints and will ignore individual complainants redirecting them back to Consumer Direct.

The Office of Fair Trading also acts as the UK's official consumer and competition watchdog, with a remit to make markets work well for consumers, and at a local, municipal level by [[Trading Standards]] departments. General consumer advice can be obtained from the Citizens Advice Consumer Service or via a local branch of the [[Citizen's Advice Bureau]].

On the 3rd September, Conservative MEP Daniel Dalton proposed plans to the European Parliament's Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee to introduce an App that would provide a single source of advice and dispute resolution.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Conservative MEP unveils new consumer rights proposals |url= http://conservativeeurope.com/news/conservative-mep-unveils-new-consumer-rights-proposals|work=Conservatives in the European Parliament|date=3 September 2018|author=Daniel Dalton }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:CDCA auto repair notice.jpg|thumb|Consumer protection laws often mandate the posting of notices, such as this one which appears in all [[Auto mechanic|automotive repair]] shops in California]]
In the [[United States]] a variety of laws at both the federal and state levels regulate consumer affairs. Among them are the federal [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]], [[Fair Debt Collection Practices Act]], the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]], [[Truth in Lending Act]], [[Fair Credit Billing Act]], and the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]]. Federal consumer protection laws are mainly enforced by the [[Federal Trade Commission]], the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]], the [[Food and Drug Administration]], and the [[U.S. Department of Justice]].

At the state level, many states have adopted the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821232355/http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/fnact99/1920_69/rudtpa66.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=21 August 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including, but not limited to, Delaware,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://delcode.delaware.gov/title6/c025/sc03/index.shtml|title=TITLE  6 - CHAPTER 25.

The Uniform Act contains a private remedy with attorneys fees for prevailing parties where the losing party "willfully engaged in the trade practice knowing it to be deceptive". Uniform Act §3(b).
Missouri has a similar statute called the Merchandising Practices Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/stathtml/40700000201.html|title=Missouri Revisor of Statutes - Revised Statutes of Missouri, RSMo, Missouri Law, MO Law|website=www.moga.mo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This statute allows local prosecutors or the Attorney General to press charges against people who knowingly use deceptive business practices in a consumer transaction and authorizes consumers to hire a private attorney to bring an action seeking their actual damages, punitive damages, and attorney's fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flesnerwentzel.com/#!merchandising-practices-act/c1k1e|title=St. Charles Family Law and St. Louis Divorce Attorneys Flesner Wentzel|author=|date=|website=St. Charles Family Law and St. Louis Divorce Attorneys Flesner Wentzel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.onlinedivorce.com/| title= Online Divorce }} Wednesday, 19 September 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the majority of states have a Department of Consumer Affairs devoted to regulating certain industries and protecting consumers who use goods and services from those industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medlawplus.com/classaction/attorneygeneralconsumeraffairs.tpl|title=MedlawPlus Divorce Process Resource - Welcome To The Top Free Online Divorce Resource|author=|date=|website=Welcome To The Top Free Online Divorce Resource}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in California, the [[California Department of Consumer Affairs]] regulates about 2.3 million professionals in over 230 different professions, through its forty regulatory entities. In addition, California encourages its consumers to act as [[private attorney general|private attorneys general]] through the liberal provisions of its [[Consumers Legal Remedies Act]].

[[California]] has the strongest consumer protection laws of any US state, partly because of rigorous advocacy and lobbying by groups such as Utility Consumers' Action Network, [[Consumer Federation of California]], and [[Privacy Rights Clearinghouse]]. For example, California provides for "cooling off" periods giving consumers the right to cancel contracts within a certain time period for several specified types of transactions, such as home secured transactions, and warranty and repair services contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://la.lawsoup.org/legal-guides/laws-by-role/consumer/contract-cancellation-cooling-off-periods/|title=Contract Cancellation periods or "Cooling off periods"|date=2014-07-09|work=Law Soup LA|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other states have been the leaders in specific aspects of consumer protection. For example, Florida, Delaware, and Minnesota have legislated requirements that contracts be written at reasonable readability levels as a large proportion of contracts cannot be understood by most consumers who sign them.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis D. Eigen, [http://scriptamus.wordpress.com/2009/11/12/a-solution-to-the-problem-of-consumer-contracts-that-cannot-be-understood-by-consumers/ "A Solution to the Problem of Consumer Contracts That Cannot be Understood by Consumers Who Sign Them"], Scriptamus, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[copyright]] laws in [[Greece]]''' are part of the frame of laws which are constantly being adapted to the guidelines of the [[European Union]].

The enforcement of the copyright laws varies from case to case. Greece has attracted attention because of its extended copyright infringement of [[Copyright infringement of software|software]] and [[music piracy|music]]. The Greek government has tried to impose countermeasures such as the prosecution of those who produce or consume unauthorized material, with questionable results.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

'''Copyright misuse''' is an [[Equity (law)|equitable]] [[affirmative defense|defense]] against [[copyright]] [[copyright infringement|infringement]] in the [[United States]] allowing copyright infringers to avoid infringement liability if the copyright holder has engaged in abusive or improper conduct in exploiting or enforcing the copyright. Copyright misuse is comparable to, and draws from precedents under, the older doctrine of [[patent misuse]], which dates back to the early years of the 20th century and derives from the more general equity doctrine of "[[unclean hands]]", which bars a party from obtaining equitable relief (such as an injunction) against another when the party has acted improperly (though not necessarily illegally).&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Motion Picture Patents Company|Motion Picture Patents Co.]] v. [[Universal Studios|Universal Film Mfg. Co.]]'', 243 U.S. 502 (1917).&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine forbids the copyright owner from attempting to extend the effect or operation of copyright beyond the scope of the statutory right (for example, by engaging in restrictive [[license|licensing]] practices that are contrary to public policy, particularly the public policy of copyright law).&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[Lasercomb America, Inc. v. Reynolds]]'', 911 F.2d 970, 978 (4th Cir. 1990) (“The question is . . . whether the copyright is being used in a manner violative of the public policy embodied in the grant of a copyright.”).&lt;/ref&gt; Courts do not permit a copyright owner that has engaged in misuse to enforce its copyright—whether by securing an [[injunction]] against infringers or collecting damages for infringement, until the misuse has been "purged"—that is, the improper practice has been abandoned and its effects have fully dissipated.&lt;ref&gt;See generally ''B.B. Chem. Co. v. Ellis'', 315 U.S. 495 (1942).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevant court decisions==
Copyright misuse is not a statutory defense set forth in the federal [[Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act]] but is instead founded in federal [[case law]] derived from the [[patent misuse]] doctrine. One of the earliest copyright misuse precedents is a case in the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota|Minnesota Federal District Court]], ''[[M. Witmark &amp; Sons]] v. Jensen''.&lt;ref&gt;80 F. Supp. 843 (D. Minn. 1948).&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] subsequently endorsed the copyright misuse doctrine in ''[[Lasercomb America, Inc. v. Reynolds]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital-law-online.info/cases/15PQ2D1846.htm Lasercomb], 911 F.2d 970 (4th Cir. 1990). ''Lasercomb'' is generally considered the leading case.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other appellate decisions in the area include ''Video Pipeline, Inc. v. Buena Vista Home Entertainment''&lt;ref&gt;342 F.3d 191 (3d Cir. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Assessment Technologies v. WIREdata''.&lt;ref&gt;350 F.3d 640 (7th Cir. 2003)..&lt;/ref&gt;

Improper behavior that may lead to a finding of copyright misuse includes (but is not limited to) [[antitrust|anti-competitive activity]]. One notable exception is the Federal Circuit's (patent misuse) decision in ''Princo Corporation vs. [[International Trade Commission]]''. In that case, Princo had licensed patents from [[Philips]] to use data encoding technology, but eventually stopped paying for use of the patent. When Philips sued, Princo argued that it should not be liable for the infringement because Philips had made an agreement with [[Sony]] not to license a new patent that would allow for a different way of encoding data, which Princo claimed violated the antitrust laws. The court disagreed, finding Princo liable for infringement because the antitrust violation was seen as irrelevant to the original patent.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Hicks, [http://wombledistributionlaw.blogspot.com/2010/09/scope-of-patent-misuse-doctrine-sparks.html ''Scope of Patent Misuse Doctrine Sparks Debate In Federal Circuit''].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Is ''Princo'' relevant to a '''copyright misuse''' article? See talk page--&gt;

Restraints that hinder the promotion of the progress of human knowledge may be held copyright misuse, as in the ''Lasercomb'' case, which involved a restriction against development of improved computer code that might compete against the licensed code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital-law-online.info/cases/15PQ2D1846.htm Lasercomb], 911 F.2d 970 (4th Cir. 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Similar principles might condemn a restriction against exercise of reverse engineering, fair use, or conduct protected under the First Amendment.

{{update|date=May 2013}}
'''Defalcation''' is misappropriation of funds by a person trusted with its charge; also, the act of misappropriation, or an instance thereof. The term is more specifically used by the [[United States Bankruptcy Code]] to describe a category of acts that taint a particular [[debt]] such that it cannot be discharged in [[bankruptcy]].&lt;ref&gt;US Bankruptcy Code, section 523(a)(4) (11 U.S.C. §523(a)(4)&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Supreme Court addressed the issue in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;Bullock v. BankChampaign, N.A. 133 S. Ct 1754 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; holding that "defalcation" in the context of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code &lt;ref&gt;Title 11 of the United States Code (11 U.S.C. §523(a)(4)&lt;/ref&gt; requires proof of "a culpable state of mind… involving knowledge of, or gross recklessness in respect to, the improper nature of the relevant fiduciary behavior." &lt;ref&gt;Bullock v. BankChampaign, N.A. 133 S. Ct 1754, at p. 1757 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In accounting terminology, especially with respect to the area of audit, defalcation means a misappropriation of assets or theft of assets by employees or officers of a corporation.

Defalcation occurs when a debtor commits a bad act while acting in a fiduciary capacity.&lt;ref&gt;''Collier on Bankruptcy'', 523.10 (15th ed. rev. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The classic example of defalcation is when a trustee recklessly invests trust funds and loses the money. If the beneficiary wins a judgment against the trustee, and the trustee files for bankruptcy, the debt (the judgment) cannot be discharged in bankruptcy because the debt was the result of a defalcation.

Defalcation, for example, applies when a debtor is acting in a fiduciary capacity.  To constitute a defalcation, the conduct involves a degree of culpability that is greater than negligence, but the act does not need to rise to the level of a "fraud" under common law. Defalcation requires a showing of conscious behavior or extreme recklessness.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Hyman'', 502 F.3d 61 (2d. Cir. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is used in legal proceedings other than bankruptcy to refer more generally to [[embezzlement]]; it is often used in the context of the [[title insurance]] business.  A title agent who misuses funds intended to be used to close insured transactions is said to be involved in a defalcation. Many title insurers have their own "defalcation units".

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary}}
[[File:Falx bgiu.png|thumb|Defalcation literally means "cutting off with a ''[[falx]]''" ("sickle").]]
The term is from Latin, and is analyzed as ''de-'' "off" + ''[[falx]]'' "sickle" + ''-tion'' "act of", hence literally "cutting off with a sickle". There is also a verb form, "defalcate".

==Prosecution==
Brown was instructed by the CPS in many of the highest profile British criminal cases including prosecution of [[Kevin Hutchinson-Foster]] who passed the BBM Bruni Model 92 handgun to [[Mark Duggan]] shortly before the minicab in which Duggan was travelling was stopped by police in Ferry Lane in [[Tottenham Hale]].&lt;ref name="“Independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kevin Hutchison Foster's Trial |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/mark-duggan-given-gun-just-15-minutes-before-death-8152877.html |accessdate=23 July 2017|publisher=Independent|date=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"On August 4 last year a handgun was recovered in Ferry Lane in Tottenham, north London. It had been in the possession of a man named [[Mark Duggan]]. The gun was loaded - it had a bullet in its magazine. The evidence demonstrates that that gun at that scene had been passed to Mark Duggan by this defendant, [[Kevin Hutchinson-Foster]], shortly before the [[minicab]] in which Mark Duggan was travelling was stopped by police in Ferry Lane in Tottenham Hale. There in Ferry Lane Mark Duggan was shot and fatally injured by the police as a result of his possession of that gun and what he was thought to be about to do with it. The firearm was a BBM Bruni Model 92 [[handgun]]. It had been modified so that it would fire 9mm bullets - a lethal firearm as you will hear.
The charge this defendant faces is the supply or transfer of that gun to Mark Duggan."

Brown was also instructed in the inquest of Duggan's death.&lt;ref name="“Inquest in the death of Mark Duggan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Inquest into Mark Duggan's death |url=https://inquestintodeathofmarkduggan.wordpress.com/tag/edward-brown-qc |accessdate=23 July 2017|publisher=Independent|date=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He prosecuted members of the GAS (Guns And Shanks) gang from Brixton&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zac Olumegbon murder: Four teenagers jailed for life |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-16283113|publisher=BBC|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were charged with [[joint enterprise]] murder in a case of "vicious, shocking and sickening case of gang violence outside a school at a time when pupils and staff were gathering at the start of a school day",&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; as well as Ben Hitchcock's murderers, whose actions were described as "the direct result of what was a pitched battle between rival gangs."&lt;ref name="BBCnews"&gt;{{cite news|title=Boy was killed in gang 'battle'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8071814.stm |accessdate=23 July 2017|publisher=BBC News|date=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-defendant Royston Thomas was found not guilty after police detectives relaunched an investigation into the stabbing of 16-year-old Ben Hitchcock.&lt;ref name="“BromleyTimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hitman Jailed For 'Medieval Turf War' Murder |url=http://www.bromleytimes.co.uk/news/wall-of-silence-scuppered-murder-trial-1-579494 |accessdate=23 July 2017|publisher=Bromley Times|date=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===R v Jogee===
In February 2016, Brown was interviewed by [[The Lawyer]] magazine to analyse [[R v Jogee]] that reversed previous case law on [[joint enterprise]] murder,{{Quote box|width=25%|align=left|bgcolor=#E6E6FA|quote="The appeals by these two men have been used by the Supreme Court to address the problem and change the law. Though they might well have kept the law as it was.There will now be very many cases of applications to appeal against convictions out of time. They won’t be confined to murder cases, but to all crime where there was a secondary party, so robberies, sexual crimes. That doesn’t mean every case of so-called joint enterprise will be overturned, the justices have been pretty strong on that, particularly because the Court of Appeal on accepts cases out of time when there has been a serious injustice to a party. From today it doesn’t automatically become a crime if you prove foresight by the secondary party. It’s been found too low a test to be found guilty of a serious crime, but it is still available for a jury to use in deciding whether or not the party intended to encourage or assist the other to do it."|source=— '''Edward Brown QC'''"&lt;ref name="“The Lawyer"/&gt;}} after a recent [[Supreme Court]] ruling indicating that it was not right that a person could be convicted of murder and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment if they foresaw the murder could take place but did not deliver the fatal blow.&lt;ref name="“The Lawyer"&gt;{{cite news |title=R v Jogee Ruling |url=https://l2b.thelawyer.com/kinders-casebook-landmark-ruling-reinterprets-law-of-joint-enterprise/  |accessdate=26 July 2017 |date=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown commented: "It has always been the case that a person who intentionally assists another in a joint crime will be as guilty as the person who physically commits that crime. After the Chan Wing-Siu ruling in 1985, juries have since been directed that if a secondary party foresaw that the principal party might use a knife, for example, with intent to cause harm or murder, then they are guilty of murder as well."&lt;ref name="“The Lawyer"/&gt;
Brown also commented that the judgment in [[R v Jogee]] and [[Ruddock v The Queen]]  will have a significant effect on the prosecution of multi-handed crime, and in particular cases of multi-handed serious violence that sometimes results in death. It will also result in many applications for leave to appeal against conviction out of time.&lt;ref name="“Lexis Nexis"&gt;{{cite news |title=Supreme Court rules on ‘joint enterprise’|url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/lexispsl/corporatecrime/document/412012/5J5P-M4H1-DYW7-W245-00000-00/Supreme_Court_rules_on__joint_enterprise_  |accessdate=26 July 2017 |date=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Brown prosecuted two south London gangs known as Shanks and Guns, or SG, and the Black Mafia, also known as the Sydenham Boys.&lt;ref name="“NewsShopper"&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Nicholas Pearton another victim of south London gang rivalry? |url=http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/8905191.Is_Nicholas_Pearton_another_victim_of_south_London_gang_rivalry_/ |accessdate=25 July 2017| date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gang members were found guilty of murder of Nicholas "Nick" Pearton who was thought to be their friend.

Only one out of ten gangsters was identified as stabbing Pearton. The others claimed they had been wrongly convicted of murder and manslaughter.

In 2016 Brown started prosecuting Hamad Mohammad and three of his associates who were accused of [[joint enterprise|joint enterprise murder]].

Suminaite told police she "most likely" intended to kill her baby, but said she did not know why. At the trial held at the Old Bailey she pleaded guilty to a charge of infanticide.&lt;ref name="“Express 1"/&gt;
The court heard that on April 5, 2016, Suminaite left work early saying she had ‘big problems’ and gave birth in the bathroom at home, with her partner in another room.&lt;ref name="“IifeNews"&gt;{{cite news |title=Woman Who Killed Her Newborn Baby Girl Minutes After Birth Won’t Go to Prison |url=http://www.lifenews.com/2017/02/01/woman-who-killed-her-newborn-baby-girl-minutes-after-birth-wont-go-to-prison/ |accessdate=4 August 2017 |date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her partner found Suminaite lying naked in the bathroom surrounded by blood and a baby bath full of what appeared to be clothes.&lt;ref name="“The Argus"&gt;{{cite news |title=High Court judge may be called in to hear baby death case |url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/14423777.High_Court_judge_may_be_called_in_to_hear_baby_death_case/ |accessdate=4 August 2017 |date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jason Marshall===
In August 2017, Brown prosecuted male escort Jason Marshall who murdered his client Peter Fasoli who he met in December 2012 through gay social networking site called [[Badoo]], where he advertised his services under his "working" name Gabriel. Marshall was arrested after the victim's relative found hidden footage of killing on his [[laptop]].&lt;ref name="Metro.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=Computer repairman ‘terrorised and killed by fake policeman during bondage |url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/07/31/computer-repairman-terrorised-and-killed-by-fake-policeman-during-bondage-6818943/ |accessdate=1 August 2017 |date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Fasoli, a 58-year-old [[IT]] expert,&lt;ref name="Attitude.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=Jason Marshall, 28, is accused of killing IT expert Peter Fasoli during a hook-up before setting his flat alight. |url=http://attitude.co.uk/nephew-found-footage-of-uncles-hook-up-app-murder-two-years-after-believing-he-died-in-fire/ |accessdate=1 August 2017 |date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Northolt]] was terrorised and murdered in 2013 at his own house by Marshall who posed as a policeman.&lt;ref name="London Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |title=Murder suspect caught after victim's relative finds hidden footage of killing |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/31/murder-suspect-caught-victims-relative-finds-hidden-footage/ |accessdate=1 August 2017 |date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the opening day of his trial at the [[Old Bailey]], Marshall was described as a "calculating and determined" killer.&lt;ref name="DailyRecord.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=Jason Marshall, 28, calmly stood over the body of Peter Fasoli and pronounced "in the name of the father, the son and the Holy Ghost" in Latin. |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/no-no-please-court-hears-10907646 |accessdate=1 August 2017 |date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecuting, Mr Brown warned jurors that they would be asked to view the video, which showed the actual killing itself.&lt;ref name="London DailyMail.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=Computer repairman filmed his own death as fantasist, 28, terrorised and murdered him during a bondage session while listening to Classic FM |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4746834/Fantasist-killer-caught-camera-murdering-partner.html |accessdate=1 August 2017 |date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court heard that during sexual roleplay, Marshall stripped the victim and arrested him for “being a spy” and hacking into a government laptop, the court heard. Fasoli was threatened with a knife and forced to hand over his cash card pin numbers.&lt;ref name="BBC London"&gt;{{cite news |title=Man 'murdered by fake policeman in sex game' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-40779337 |accessdate=1 August 2017 |date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The footage shower Marshall, 28, calmly standing over the body of his client Peter Fasoli and signing "in the name of the father, the son and the Holy Ghost" in Latin, after killing him.

"The fire, in the early hours of January 7, 2013, had been intended to hide a terrible crime. The fire was set by this defendant in an attempt to disguise what truly happened, and the defendant Jason Marshall very nearly succeeded in escaping justice. Peter Fasoli was killed, intentionally. He had been subjected to a calculated and determined attack, by this defendant whom he invited into his home. In the end he literally fought for his life but by the time Mr Fasoli fully understood the true motives of the person who had tricked his way into his home, it was too late. Desperate as his attempts were, he could do nothing - as you will all too graphically come to understand."

But two years later when Fasoli's nephew was sorting through his belongings, he was horrified to discover a computer file containing [[CCTV]] footage of the entire event.&lt;ref name="ITV News"&gt;{{cite news |title=28-year-old on trial for 2013 Northolt murder |url=http://www.itv.com/news/london/2017-07-31/28-year-old-on-trial-for-2013-northolt-murder/ |accessdate=1 August 2017 |date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The court heard how Marshall, who denied murder, first got in contact with Peter Fasoli in December 2012 through gay social networking site called [[Badoo]], inviting to set up a treesome and inventing the persona of a policeman.&lt;ref name="NewhamRecorder"&gt;{{cite news |title=East Ham murder accused ‘set fire to victim’s home to cover up death’, court hears |url=http://www.newhamrecorder.co.uk/news/crime-court/east-ham-murder-accused-set-fire-to-victim-s-home-to-cover-up-death-court-hears-1-5129121 |accessdate=1 August 2017 |date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prosecuting, Mr Brown told jurors:
{{quote|There is a telling feature of this case - whilst the defendant sought to tempt the deceased into thinking their encounter that night was to be sexual in nature, the sexual element of the night’s events played only a short part early on and soon was superseded by physical domination and then violence.&lt;ref name="NewhamRecorder"/&gt;}}
The Old Baily heard that Marshall arrived at the Fasoli's home at around 7pm on 6 January 2012, pretending to be a police officer kitted out with a police utility belt, handcuffs and a pistol holster.&lt;ref name="London Independent"&gt;{{cite news |title=Murder victim inadvertently filmed his own death during bondage sex game |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/bondage-sex-game-murder-victim-film-death-peter-fasoli-london-northolt-fake-policeman-classic-fm-a7871291.html?amp |accessdate=1 August 2017 |date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 11, 2015, he was named the Deputy U.S. Chief Technology Officer.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/05/11/white-house-names-dr-ed-felten-deputy-us-chief-technology-officer&lt;/ref&gt;

Felten has done a variety of [[computer security]] research, including groundbreaking work on proof-carrying authentication and work on security related to the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]], but he is perhaps best known for his paper on the [[Secure Digital Music Initiative]] (SDMI) challenge.

==Biography==
Felten attended the [[California Institute of Technology]] and graduated with a degree in [[Physics]] in 1985. He worked as a staff programmer at Caltech from 1986 to 1989 on a parallel supercomputer project at Caltech. He then enrolled as a graduate student in Computer Science at the [[University of Washington]]. He was awarded a [[Master of Science]] degree in 1991 and a [[Ph.D]] in 1993. His Ph.D. thesis was on developing an automated protocol for communication between parallel processors.

In 1993, he joined the faculty of [[Princeton University]] in the Department of Computer Science as an Assistant Professor. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1999 and to Professor in 2003. In 2006, he joined the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]], but computer science remains his home department. In 2005, he became the Director of the [http://citp.princeton.edu Center for Information and Technology Policy] at [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. He has served as a consultant to law firms, corporations, private foundations, and government agencies. His research involves computer security, and technology policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

He lives in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] with his family. From 2006 to 2010, he was a member of the board of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF). In 2007, he was inducted as a Fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]].

In November 2010, he was named Chief Technologist of the [[Federal Trade Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 11, 2015, he was named Deputy U.S. Chief Technology Officer for [[The White House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==''United States v. Microsoft''==
Felten was a witness for the United States government in ''[[United States v. Microsoft]]'', where the software company was charged with committing a variety of antitrust crimes. During the trial, Microsoft's attorneys denied that it was possible to remove the [[Internet Explorer]] web browser from a [[Windows 98]] equipped computer without significantly impairing the operation of Windows.

Citing research he had undertaken with Christian Hicks and Peter Creath, two of his former students,&lt;ref name = "Ind-Stand"&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Felten testified that it was possible to remove Internet Explorer functionality from Windows without causing any problems with the operating system. He demonstrated his team's tool in court, showing 19 ways in which it is normally possible to access the web browser from the Windows platform that his team's tool rendered inaccessible.

Microsoft argued that Felten's changes did not truly remove Internet Explorer but only made its functionality inaccessible to the end user by removing icons, shortcuts and the iexplore.exe executable file, and making changes to the system registry. This led to a debate as to what exactly constitutes the "web browser," since much of the core functionality of Internet Explorer is stored in a shared [[dynamic-link library]], accessible to any program running under Windows.

Microsoft also argued that Felten's tool did not even completely remove web-browsing capability from the system since it was still possible to access the web through other Windows executables besides iexplore.exe, such as the Windows help system.

==The SDMI challenge==
As part of a contest in 2000, [[SDMI]] (Secure Digital Music Initiative) invited researchers and others to try to break the [[digital audio]] [[steganography|watermark]] technologies that they had devised. In a series of individual challenges, the participants were given a sample audio piece, with one of the watermarks embedded. If the participants sent back the sample with the watermark removed (and with less than an acceptable amount of [[signal loss]], though this condition was not stated by SDMI), they would win that particular challenge.

Felten was an initial participant of the contest. He chose to opt out of [[confidentiality]] agreements that would have made his team eligible for the cash prize. Despite being given very little or no information about the watermarking technologies other than the audio samples and having only three weeks to work with them, Felten and his team managed to modify the files sufficiently that SDMI's automated judging system declared the watermark removed.

SDMI did not accept that Felten had successfully broken the watermark according to the rules of the contest, noting that there was a requirement for files to lose no sound quality. SDMI claimed that the automated judging result was inconclusive, as a submission which simply wiped all the sounds off the file would have successfully removed the watermark but would not meet the quality requirement.

===SDMI lawsuits===
Felten's team developed a scientific paper explaining the methods used by his team in defeating the SDMI watermarks. Planning to present the paper at the Fourth International [[Information Hiding]] Workshop of 2001 in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], Felten was  threatened with legal action by SDMI,&lt;ref name = "SDMI-Letter"&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), and [http://verance.com Verance Corporation], under the terms of the [[DMCA]], on the argument that one of the technologies his team had broken was currently in use in the market. Felten withdrew the presentation from the workshop, reading a brief statement about the threats instead. SDMI and other copyright holders denied that they had ever threatened to sue Felten. However, SDMI appears to have threatened legal action when spokesman Matt Oppenheim warned Felten in a letter that "any disclosure of information gained from participating in the Public Challenge....could subject you and your research team to actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Felten, with help from the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], sued the groups, requesting a [[declaratory judgement]] ruling that their publication of the paper would be legal. The case was dismissed for a [[Standing (law)|lack of standing]].&lt;ref name = "Hearing Transcript"&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Felten presented his paper at the [[USENIX]] security conference in 2001.  The [[United States Department of Justice]] has offered Felten and other researchers assurances that the DMCA does not threaten their work and stated that the legal threats against them were invalid.

==Sony rootkit investigation==

The [[2005 Sony BMG CD copy protection scandal]] started when security researcher [[Mark Russinovich]] revealed on October 31, 2005 that Sony's [[Extended Copy Protection]] ("XCP") [[copy protection]] software on the CD ''[[Get Right with the Man]]'' by [[Van Zant]] contained hidden files that could damage the operating system, install [[spyware]] and make the user's computer vulnerable to attack when the CD was played on a Microsoft Windows-based PC. Sony then released a software patch to remove XCP.

On November 15, 2005, Felten and [[J. Alex Halderman]] showed that Sony's method for removing XCP copy protection software from the computer makes it more vulnerable to attack, as it essentially installed a [[rootkit]], in the form of an [[Active X]] control used by the uninstaller, and left it on the user's machine and set so as to allow any web page visited by the user to execute arbitrary code. Felten and Halderman described the problem in a blog post:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The consequences of the flaw are severe, it allows any Web page you visit to download, install, and run any code it likes on your computer. Any Web page can seize control of your computer; then it can do anything it likes. That's about as serious as a security flaw can get.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Diebold voting machine analysis==

On September 13, 2006, Felten and graduate students Ariel Feldman and [[Alex Halderman]] discovered severe security flaws in a Diebold Election Systems (now [[Premier Election Solutions]]) [[voting machine]]. Their findings claimed, "Malicious software running on a single voting machine can steal votes with little if any risk of detection. The malicious software can modify all of the records, audit logs, and counters kept by the voting machine, so that even careful forensic examination of these records will find nothing amiss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequoia voting machine analysis==
In early 2008, New Jersey election officials announced that they planned to send one or more [[Sequoia Voting Systems|Sequoia]] Advantage voting machines to Ed Felten and [[Andrew Appel]] (also of Princeton University) for analysis. In March 2008, Sequoia sent an e-mail to Professor Felten asserting that allowing him to examine Sequoia voting machines would violate the license agreement between Sequoia and the county which bought them, and also that Sequoia would take legal action "to stop [...] any non-compliant analysis, [...] publication of Sequoia software, its behavior, reports regarding same or any other infringement of our intellectual property."

  |title=Interesting e-mail by Sequoia

  |date=2008-03-17
  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
This action sparked outrage among computer technology activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After examining Sequoia's machines, Felten and Appel indeed discovered grave problems with the accuracy of the machines.&lt;ref name="Ref_b"&gt;Ed Felten: [http://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/nj-election-discrepancies-worse-previously-thought-contradict-sequoias-explanation NJ Election Discrepancies Worse Than Previously Thought, Contradict Sequoia's Explanation], ''Freedom To Tinker'', April 4th, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They also demonstrated that the machines can be hacked and compromised within minutes.&lt;ref name="Ref_c"&gt;Andrew Appel: [http://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/appel/security-seals-avc-advantage-voting-machines-are-easily-defeated Security Seals on AVC Advantage Voting Machines are Easily Defeated], ''Freedom To Tinker'', December 19th, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after that, Sequoia's corporate Web site was hacked. The hack was first discovered by Ed Felten. Sequoia took its Web site down on 20 March and removed the "intrusive content."&lt;ref name="Dee2008"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.efluxmedia.com/news_Sequoia_Voting_Systems_Admits_To_Hackers_Attacking_Their_Website_15405.html|title=Sequoia Voting Systems Admits To Hackers Attacking Their Website|publisher=eFluxMedia|author=Dee Chisamera|date=2008-03-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406084309/http://www.efluxmedia.com/news_Sequoia_Voting_Systems_Admits_To_Hackers_Attacking_Their_Website_15405.html|archivedate=2009-04-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cold boot attack==

In February 2008, Felten and his students were part of the team that discovered the [[cold boot attack]], which allows someone with physical access to a computer to bypass operating system protections and extract the contents of its memory.&lt;ref name="ColdBoot"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://citp.princeton.edu/memory/ |title=Lest We Remember: Cold Boot Attacks on Encryption Keys |author=J.

'''Enes Kanter''' (born May 20, 1992) is a Turkish professional [[basketball]] player for the [[New York Knicks]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). Standing at {{height|ft=6|in=11}}, he plays at the [[Center (basketball)|center]] position.

==Early life==
Kanter was born May 20, 1992, in [[Zürich]], [[Switzerland]],&lt;ref name=allen&gt;{{cite news |last=Allen |first=Percy |title=Huskies get commitment from 6-foot-10 Turkish star Enes Kanter |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/huskies/2010340248_umen24.html |work=SeattleTimes.com |date=November 23, 2009 |accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his father, Mehmet, attained his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] from the [[University of Zurich]]. His father is a professor of [[histology]] at [[Trakya University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/sports/ncaabasketball/08basketball.html|title=Turkish Team Says It Paid a Top Kentucky Recruit|first=Pete|last=Thamel|date=7 September 2010|publisher=|accessdate=22 May 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before moving to the United States, Kanter played under [[Serdar Apaydın]]'s management for the [[Fenerbahçe Men's Basketball|Fenerbahçe]] youth squad between 2006 and 2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fenerbahce.org/detay.asp?ContentID=16528 Enes Kanter hakkında bilgilendirme] {{tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then, during the 2008–09 season, Kanter was a seldom-used reserve for the Fenerbahçe senior team.&lt;ref name=decourcy&gt;{{cite web|last=DeCourcy |first=Mike |title=Enes Kanter a revolutionary case for Kentucky, NCAA |work=SportingNews.com |date=April 14, 2010 |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/story/2010-04-14/enes-kanter-revolutionary-case-for-kentucky-ncaa |accessdate=April 21, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824110049/http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/story/2010-04-14/enes-kanter-revolutionary-case-for-kentucky-ncaa |archivedate=August 24, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He played in at least nine games with the team – four in the [[EuroLeague]] and five in the [[Turkish Basketball Super League|Turkish Super League]].&lt;ref name=decourcy /&gt; Fenerbahçe and the [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] basketball team [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]] both offered Kanter professional contracts, but he declined because he wanted to play high school and college basketball in the United States.&lt;ref name=allen /&gt;

===Prep school===
In 2009, Kanter moved to the United States, where he enrolled at Stoneridge Preparatory School in [[Simi Valley, California]], and played for the basketball team in 2009–10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/high-school/story/_/id/4407971/kanter-enroll-findlay-prep/|title=Top Euro hoopster to enroll at U.S. high school|publisher=|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2010 [[Nike Hoop Summit]], Kanter played for the international team, recording 34 points and 13 rebounds.&lt;ref name=decourcy /&gt; His point total was a record for the event, breaking [[Dirk Nowitzki]]'s record set in the 1998 game.&lt;ref name=decourcy /&gt; Both [[Rivals.com]] and [[Scout.com]] rated Kanter as a five-star prospect, the highest possible rating.&lt;ref name=rivals&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/basketball/recruiting/player-Enes-Kanter-102889 |title=ENES KANTER |work=Yahoo.com |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scout&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scouthoops.scout.com/player/4508332n-enes-kanter |title=Enes Kanter Player Profile News |work=Scout.com |accessdate=April 21, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214184555/http://scouthoops.scout.com/player/4508332n-enes-kanter |archivedate=February 14, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College career==

Kanter was born in Switzerland to Turkish parents who later returned to their homeland. 

Kanter's younger brother, [[Kerem Kanter|Kerem]], played for the [[Green Bay Phoenix men's basketball|University of Wisconsin–Green Bay]] from 2014 to 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/article/5485443|title=NCAA Tournament: Green Bay's Kerem Kanter excited to play on older brother's home floor|last=Kersey|first=Jason|date=16 March 2016|website=NewsOK|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from UW–Green Bay in 2017, he transferred to [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Xavier University]] under the NCAA's graduate transfer rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cincinnati.com/story/sports/college/xavier/2017/05/22/report-kanter-pulling-out-nba-draft-play-xavier/102008840/ |title=Kanter pulling out of NBA Draft, will play at Xavier |first=Patrick |last=Brennan |newspaper=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]] |date=May 22, 2017 |accessdate=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since immigrating to the United States, Kanter has become a supporter of the [[Gülen movement|Hizmet Movement]] of [[Fethullah Gülen]], a "persona non grata" in Turkey. After the failed [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt|2016 ''coup d'état'' attempt]], Kanter heavily criticised Turkish president [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] on Twitter, leading to the cancellation of his account in Turkey. Soon after the coup attempt in July, his father and his family publicly disowned him due to his political views and his support for Gülen, imploring him to change his surname, on August 8. Kanter stated that he loves Gülen "more than his family", informally changing his name to Enes Gülen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebiglead.com/2016/08/08/enes-kanter-changed-his-twitter-handle-to-include-gulen-after-family-reportedly-disowns-him-for-political-views/|title=Enes Kanter Changed His Twitter Handle to Include "Gulen" After Family Reportedly Disowned Him for Political Views|date=8 August 2016|publisher=|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, his father was still dismissed from his university position a few weeks later, via the government decree numbered 272 on September 1, as part of [[2016–17 Turkish purges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntv.com.tr/galeri/turkiye/ihrac-edilen-akademisyenlerin-tam-listesi,3DEsXvUilESI478EBZQ5uA/knDxYV9eYUS7wBcahzmJCw|title=İhraç edilen akademisyenlerin tam listesi|date=4 September 2016|publisher=[[NTV (Turkey)|NTV]]|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birgun.net/haber-detay/enes-kanter-in-babasi-da-ihrac-edildi-133529.html|title=Enes Kanter'in babası da ihraç edildi|date=30 October 2016|publisher=[[BirGün]]|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazetevatan.com/enes-kanter-e-buyuk-sok-ihrac-edildi--1001168-gundem/|title=Enes Kanter'e büyük şok!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1986">'''Engineering law''' (or law in engineering) is the [[empirical]] study of the application of [[laws]] and legal [[strategy]] in [[engineering]]. Applied law aims to explain how [[law]] interacts with [[industry]]. The current [[school of thought]] within the academic community of [[lawyers]] and [[engineers]] is the [[wikt:pragmatic|pragmatic]] [[paradigm]]. Commonly, professionals have a [[Bachelors in Engineering]] and a [[Bachelors in Law]], and increasingly commonly a [[Masters of Business Administration]]. Pragmatic application of [[laws]] means the [[empirical]] study of how a [[corporate]] legal framework should be adopted.

== Graduate attributes and professional competencies == 
The requirements from the  perspective of the Washington Accord are for engineering graduates to attain the following knowledge and skill: 
'WA6: Apply reasoning informed by contextual knowledge to assess societal, health, safety, legal and cultural issues and the consequent responsibilities relevant to professional engineering practice and solutions to complex engineering problems.'

== Sub topics ==
Key topic areas for engineering law are: 
* Contract administration, especially in construction, procurement, and supply chain. 
* Product liability, especially for manufactured products.
* Intellectual property (IP) protection, which includes patents, copyrights, etc.
* Safety legislation and regulations, which includes plant safety, risk management, food safety. 
* Standards and certification, which are product-specific constraints on design and testing processes.
Patent Law, which are to help people do patent on any goods.

The '''Enrollment Act''', {{USStat|12|731}}, enacted March 3, 1863, also known as the '''Civil War Military Draft Act''',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Delehant|1967|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rpOkMyVjGKQC&amp;pg=PA1132 1132]}}&lt;/ref&gt; was legislation passed by the [[United States Congress]] during the [[American Civil War]] to provide fresh manpower for the [[Union Army]]. A form of [[conscription]], the controversial act required the enrollment of every male citizen and those immigrants who had filed for citizenship between ages twenty and forty-five. Federal agents established a quota of new troops due from each congressional district. In some cities, particularly [[New York City in the Civil War|New York City]], enforcement of the act sparked [[civil unrest]] as the war dragged on, leading to the [[New York City draft riots]] on July 13–16. It replaced the previous [[Militia Act of 1862]].

== Organization ==
[[File:New York enrollment poster june 23 1863.jpg|thumb|right|Recruiting poster from New York City printed by Baker &amp; Godwin, June 23, 1863]]The [[Provost Marshal General]] [[James Barnet Fry]] administered the national implementation of the Enrollment Act and answered directly to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton.  Beneath Provost Marshal General Fry were the State Acting Assistant Provost Marshal Generals.  The State Provost Marshal Generals were not authorized by the Enrollment Act, but were appointed personally by James Fry to attend to matters in each individual state. New York and Pennsylvania were the only states that had more than one State Acting Assistant Marshal general; New York had three and Pennsylvania had two.  Each state was divided along district lines with each district under the jurisdiction of an enrollment board.

The enrollment boards were headed by a district provost marshal and also included a surgeon and a commissioner. Each enrollment board employed clerks, deputies, and special agents as needed. The enrollment boards divided themselves into sub-districts along ward (in cities) and township (in rural areas) lines. In each sub-district a census was conducted by an enrollment officer to document every man eligible for the draft in the sub-district.

== Causes of unrest ==
[[File:New York Draft Riots - fighting.jpg|thumb|right|Rioters and Federal troops clash as a result of the 1863 Enrollment Act]]
The policies of substitution and commutation were controversial practices that allowed drafted citizens to opt out of service by either furnishing a suitable substitute to take the place of the draftee or paying $300. Both provisions were created with the intention of softening the effect of the draft on [[Pacifism|pacifists]], the antidraft movement, and the propertied classes. The result however was general public resentment of both policies. The two practices were major points of contention among the general public and led directly to the slogan "rich man's war, poor man's fight."

===Substitution===
The policy of substitutions was continued throughout the war. The problem with substitution was that it provided substitutes with powerful incentives to [[desertion|desert]] soon after enlisting. Career "jumpers" made a living off of enlisting as a substitute, collecting their compensation, deserting before their units were dispatched to the front, and repeating the process. The problem was well known to the military commanders who regularly saw the same recruits repeatedly. In addition, troops furnished by substitution were considered to be of an inferior quality in comparison to regulars and volunteers.

===Commutation===
Commutation (paying $300 to escape the draft) was created in an effort to keep substitution prices low. If commutation were not instated, the price of a substitute would have quickly soared past $300. Also, commutation was intended to raise money for the war effort. While commutation raised war funds, it was often a criticism of the draft that it was better at raising money than troops.  The rationalization for commutation was that unwilling troops were ineffective so the government might as well extract funds from the unwilling if it got poor service.  Despite the good intentions behind commutation, it was one of the most hated policies of the war.

==1864 amendment==
{{Expand section|date=June 2012}}
Congress passed an amendment to the Enrollment Act in 1864. Section 5 limited the length of an exemption from the draft by payment of a commutation fee to one year. Then, those drafted were required to serve or to furnish substitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berlin|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MdQ9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA14 14]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1865 amendment==
Congress passed another amendment to the Enrollment Act on March 3, 1865; this is sometimes referred to itself as the '''Enrollment Act of 1865'''. Section 21 of the Act ({{USStat|13|490}}) imposed denationalization (loss of citizenship) as a penalty for [[draft evasion]] or desertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matteo|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=40vcRpwqVXkC&amp;pg=PA35 35]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[John Marshall Harlan II]]'s dissent in ''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]'' mentioned the Enrollment Act of 1865 as an example of a law in which citizenship could be revoked without a person's consent and that the Congress then regarded it as constitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite case|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0387_0253_ZS.html|litigants=[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]|reporter=387 U.S. 253|date=1967|accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
''Environmental Law'' publishes four issues each year and contains articles, essays, book reviews by [[lawyers]] and [[academics]], and student-written notes and comments. Topics of discussion range from in-depth analysis of recent cases to more abstract discussions of the latest pollution prevention theories. The journal also publishes a ''Ninth Circuit Review'' on an annual basis as well as a "letters to the editor" section entitled "Clear the Air". ''Environmental Law'' is edited entirely by students.&lt;ref name=el/&gt;

The "Ninth Circuit Review" surveys recent decisions from the [[Ninth Circuit]] involving federal environmental statutes, Native American rights, common law environmental protections, procedural aspects of citizen suits, and all other topics exploring environmental issues. "Clear the Air" provides a forum for critics and skeptics to respond to articles published in the journal. The quick publication schedule for these letters enables researchers and practitioners to solicit answers and information from subscribers.

Professor Scott Crespi ranked ''Environmental Law'' as the third most influential environmental law review in the United States, behind Boalt’s ''[[Ecology Law Quarterly]]'' and the ''[[Harvard Environmental Law Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Scott Crespi, Ranking the Environmental Law, Natural Resources Law, and Land Use Planning Journals: A Survey of Expert Opinion, 23 WM. &amp; MARY ENVTL.

== History ==

[[File:Environmental Law, Vol 1.pdf|thumb|200px|Letter from President [[Richard Nixon]]]]

Established in 1969 by Dean [[Harold Wren (academic administrator)|Harold Wren]] and Professor Bill Williamson, ''Environmental Law'' was [[Lewis &amp; Clark Law School]]’s first law review.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lclark.edu/law/programs/environmental_and_natural_resources_law/perspectives/ Environmental Law and Natural Resources Law: A Long Perspective]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See [[Lewis &amp; Clark Law Review]] and [[Animal Law]]&lt;/ref&gt; The journal was launched amid the growing national awareness of environmental issues and was a catalyst behind the law school’s environmental and natural resources program, which is commonly ranked as the best in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/environmental-law US News &amp; World Report: Best Law Schools for Environmental Law]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.top-law-schools.com/environmental-law-schools.html|title=Best Environmental Law Programs|publisher=top-law-schools.com|accessdate=2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the mid-1960s and 1970s, the [[United States Congress]] enacted a series of significant environmental laws, including the [[Wilderness Act]], [[National Environmental Policy Act]], [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], [[Clean Water Act]], and [[Endangered Species Act]]. During this time, President [[Richard Nixon]] acknowledged the establishment of the nation's first law review dedicated to environmental law by writing a letter to the journal to thank Lewis &amp; Clark Law School for its participation in the national movement. ''Environmental Law'', President Nixon stated, provided "fresh hope" for answering "the great question" of the Seventies. The letter was republished on the first page of the first volume of ''Environmental Law'' and followed by articles by Senator [[Edmund S. Muskie]] and Supreme Court Justice [[William O. Douglas]].&lt;ref&gt;''See'' 1 Envtl. L. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Totalitarian principle==
{{main article|Totalitarian principle}}
In ''[[The Once and Future King]]'', author [[T. H. White]] proposed the opposite as the rule of [[totalitarianism]]: "Everything which is not forbidden is compulsory."&lt;ref&gt;	T. H. White, ''[[The Sword in the Stone (novel)|The Sword in the Stone]]'' (book 1 of ''The Once and Future King''), Collins (1938)&lt;/ref&gt; This quote has been suggested as a [[Totalitarian principle|principle of physics]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Weinberg, "Einstein's Mistakes," in Donald Goldsmith and Marcia Bartusiak (eds.), ''E: His Life, His Thought and His Influence on Our Culture,'' Sterling Publishing (2006) p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National traditions==
The claim that “everything which is not fobidden is allowed” is a principle only of English law does not stand the test of reality. In fact, it is a common principle of liberal democracies. In Germany, it has constitutional rank under Art. 2(1) of the GG which protects the general freedom to act (Allgemeine Handlungsfreiheit), as demonstrated e.g. by the judgment of the Bundesverfassungsgericht known as “Reiten im Walde” (BVerfGE 80, 137).

'''The Health Care Compliance Association (HCCA)''' is a [[nonprofit]], individual membership association which provides resources for ethics and [[compliance (regularion)|compliance]] professionals in the [[United States]]. It serves over 10,000 members through publications,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hcca-info.org/Membership/AboutHCCAMemberships.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; education programs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blickenwolf.com/Compliance/8th-compliance.html The 8th Element of Compliance]&lt;/ref&gt; conferences and professional networking [http://community.hcca-info.org] including an online social network, which has over 15,000 registered users.&lt;ref&gt;SCCE and HCCA Social Networks Now Open to All Compliance and Ethics Professionals [http://www.csrwire.com/press/press_release/19783-SCCE-and-HCCA-Social-Networks-Now-Open-to-All-Compliance-and-Ethics-Professionals]&lt;/ref&gt; HCCA also helps professionals become certified in health care compliance.

== History ==

The HCCA started as a meeting at the 1996 annual Medical Group Management Association.  Attendees included Roy Snell, then the compliance officer for the [[University of Wisconsin]] and now CEO of the HCCA, [[Brent Saunders]] of [[Thomas Jefferson University]] and Edward G. Longazel from the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. [http://www.hcca-info.org/Content/NavigationMenu/AboutHCCA/History/default.htm]
At HCCA’s first annual meeting, held in September 1997 in Los Angeles, CA, many members asked for more local networking opportunities. It was decided at that meeting that HCCA would establish ten HCCA Regions, based on the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] regions. From two members in a [[Minneapolis]] Chinese restaurant in 1996, grew to 2000 members three years later and today serves over 15,000 compliance professionals, including members of its sister association, the [[Society of Corporate Compliance and Ethics]] (SCCE).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hcca-info.org/Membership/AboutHCCAMemberships.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The HCCA has over 10,000 members alone.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hcca-info.org/Membership/AboutHCCAMemberships.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education, Publications and Events ==

The HCCA offers publications [http://www.hcca-info.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Publications] and live training to its members.[http://www.hcca-info.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Events1&amp;Template=/TaggedPage/TaggedPageDisplay.cfm&amp;TPLID=3&amp;ContentID=7444] Members of the HCCA have access to a repository of over 4,000 electronic documents including white papers and government memorandum. [http://community.hccainfo.org/CORPORATECOMPLIANCE/HCCA/Resources/Default.aspx] These resources cover the range of challenges faced by health care compliance professionals including changing regulatory requirements from [[HIPAA]] and the [[OIG]], as well as managing a program designed to meet the Organizational Sentencing Guidelines definition of an effective compliance program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ussc.gov/orgguide.htm Organizational Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt; HCCA has partnered with the OIG in issuing Government-industry roundtable reports&lt;ref&gt;[http://oig.hhs.gov/publications/docs/press/2008/RoundtablePReleaseFINAL01312008.pdf-OIG-and-HCCA-Issue-Government-Industry-Roundtable-Report OIG and HCCA Issue Government-Industry Roundtable Report]&lt;/ref&gt; to combat fraud and abuse&lt;ref&gt;http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/docs/complianceguidance/roundtable0700.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and to drive for quality in long term care.&lt;ref&gt;http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/docs/complianceguidance/Roundtable013007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, Daniel Levinson, [[inspector general]] of the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], has spoken at HCCA Compliance Institutes.[http://www.hcca-info.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Events1&amp;Template=/TaggedPage/TaggedPageDisplay.cfm&amp;TPLID=3&amp;ContentID=7444]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bakerdaniels.com/newsandevents/newsletters/detail.aspx?id=357AA90E78BE497DACDC74E96686B9F2 New OIG Guidance to Providers]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Certification ==

In 1998, the HCCA set out to develop a certification program for healthcare compliance professionals. After preliminary work by the HCCA Board of Directors and Education Committee, HCCA established the Compliance Certification Board (CCB) in 1999 to complete the process of developing an examination and assume responsibility for managing the certification program. [http://www.hcca-info.org/Content/NavigationMenu/CHCCertification/AboutCertification/default.htm ]

The independent CCB is governed by a Board of Directors appointed by the HCCA Board. The mission of the CCB is to develop criteria for the determination of competence in the practice of health care compliance at a variety of levels and to recognize individuals meeting these criteria. In pursuit of this mission, CCB utilizes four basic committees: Exam Development, Continuing Education, Admissions, and Ethics. Committee members are appointed by the CCB Board of Directors from among individuals Certified in Healthcare Compliance (CHC) and leaders in the field.

The HCCA has certification in 7 categories of healthcare compliance: CHC (Certified in Healthcare Compliance),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.compliancecertification.org/CHC/CertifiedinHealthcareCompliance.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; CHRC (Certified in Healthcare Research Compliance),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.compliancecertification.org/CHRC/CertifiedinHealthcareResearchCompliance.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; CHPC (Certified in Healthcare Privacy Compliance),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.compliancecertification.org/CHPC/CertifiedinHealthcarePrivacyCompliance.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; CHC-F (Certified in Healthcare Compliance Fellowship),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.compliancecertification.org/CHCF/CertifiedinHealthcareComplianceFellowship.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; CCEP (Certified Compliance &amp; Ethics Professional),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.compliancecertification.org/CCEP/CertifiedComplianceEthicsProfessional.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; CCEP-I (Certified Compliance &amp; Ethics Professional- International)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.compliancecertification.org/CCEPI/CertifiedComplianceEthicsProfessionalInt.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and CCEP-F (Certified Compliance &amp; Ethics Professional Fellowship).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.compliancecertification.org/CCEPF/CertifiedComplianceEthicsProFellowship.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== HCCA Social Network: HCCAnet ==

In 2008, HCCA launched a private social network that allows compliance professionals to connect online, engage in discussion, share documents including policies and procedures, and start discussion communities dedicated to particular areas of compliance, job titles, and individuals who work in various regions in the US and around the globe.  The social network, now called ''HCCAnet'', has profiles of over 15,000 compliance professionals who have used the service.

== Compliance Today ==

A monthly magazine, available in print and as an app, providing valuable information for compliance professionals. Your name and employer’s name will be published on the "New Members" page in the magazine to showcase your commitment to the profession.

== Resource Library ==

The HCCA has a dedicated library for members and non-members alike to easily search and have access to over 4,000 documents covering health care compliance issues.

A hearing is generally distinguished from a [[trial (law)|trial]] in that it is usually shorter and often less formal.&lt;ref name="Lorch000" /&gt;  In the course of [[litigation]], hearings are conducted as [[oral argument]]s in support of [[motion (legal)|motion]]s, whether to resolve the case without further trial on a [[motion to dismiss]] or for [[summary judgment]], or to decide discrete issues of law, such as the admissibility of [[evidence (law)|evidence]], that will determine how the trial proceeds.  Limited evidence and [[testimony]] may also be presented in hearings to supplement the legal arguments.&lt;ref name="Lorch000" /&gt;

In the [[United States]], one aspect of the "[[Warren Court#Due process and rights of defendants (1963–66)|due process revolution]]" is that many [[administrative law|administrative]] decisions that were once made much less formally must now be preceded by a hearing. An important step in this development was the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Goldberg v. Kelly]]'', 397 U.S. 254 (1970). There the Court held that an [[government agency|agency]] could not terminate a recipient's [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] benefits without a pre-termination hearing. The decision also illustrated that what constitutes a "hearing" can depend on the context. In ''Goldberg'', the goal of a speedy decision was held to "justify the limitation of the pre-termination hearing to minimum [[procedural law|procedural]] safeguards," which included such basic matters as the right to appear and to [[cross-examination|cross-examine]] witnesses, but did not include "a complete [[document|record]] and a [[comprehensive opinion]]".

The '''Height of Buildings Act of 1910''' was an [[Act of Congress]] passed by the [[61st United States Congress]] on June 1, 1910 to limit the height of buildings in [[Washington, D.C.]],&lt;ref name="NCPC"&gt;{{cite web |title=PART I: HISTORICAL BACKGROUND ON   THE HEIGHT OF BUILDINGS ACT |url=https://www.ncpc.gov/heightstudy/docs/Historical_Background_on_the_Height_of_Buildings_Act_(draft).pdf |website= |publisher=National Capitol Planning Commission |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; amending the [[Height of Buildings Act of 1899]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;"Fiscal Relation of the District of Columbia," from "Senate Documents - Volume 5" for the 64th Congress, pg. 863, published by GPO, 1916 (https://books.google.com/books?id=2q8qAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA863&amp;lpg=PA863&amp;dq=1899+%22Act+to+regulate+the+height+of+buildings+in+the+District+of+Columbia%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jpSP9wRVH2&amp;sig=oZxxJCRd9xE1WKhAHeqT1vYeWI0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lq1YS4mDM47KsQOF5PjFBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=1899%20%22Act%20to%20regulate%20the%20height%20of%20buildings%20in%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia%22&amp;f=false)&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[height restriction law]] was more comprehensive than the previous law, and generally restricts building heights along residential streets to {{convert|90|ft|m}}, and along commercial corridors to the width of the right-of-way of the street or avenue on which a building fronts, or a maximum of {{convert|130|ft|m}}, whichever is shorter.&lt;ref name="HeightAct"&gt;{{cite web |title=Chapter 6. Zoning and Height of Buildings. |url=https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/titles/6/chapters/6/ |website=DC Code - Chapter 6. Zoning and Height of Buildings. |publisher=District of Columbia Law Library |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In response to the construction of the 164-foot (50-meter) [[Cairo Apartment Building|Cairo Hotel]] in 1894, D.C. Commissioners issued height regulations for buildings in D.C., limiting their height to {{convert|90|ft|m}} for residential and {{convert|110|ft|m}} for business, or to the width of the street in front, whichever was smaller.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.h-net.org/~dclist/building_height&lt;/ref&gt;  The original Height of Buildings Act, passed by Congress in 1899, removed the front street restriction, but reaffirmed limiting buildings to {{convert|90|ft|m}} on residential streets and {{convert|110|ft|m}} on business streets.  It also made an exception for buildings on business streets {{convert|160|ft|m}} wide, which were permitted to be {{convert|130|ft|m}} tall.  

==Description==
The 1899 act was amended in 1910 creating Chapter 6, Subchapter 1, Section 5.&lt;ref name="HeightAct"/&gt;  Section 5 added the restriction that the height of any building would be limited to the width of the adjacent street plus {{convert|20|ft|m}} up to a maximum of {{convert|90|ft|m}} on residential streets, {{convert|130|ft|m}} on commercial streets, and {{convert|160|ft|m}} on a small portion of the north side of Pennsylvania Avenue between 1st and 15th Streets Northwest.&lt;ref name="HeightAct"/&gt; 

The act has since been amended eight times, of which five amendments made exceptions for specific buildings: St. Matthews Church in December 1930, the Harrington Hotel in June 1914, the National Press Club Building in April 1926, the United Masonic Temple in April 1930, and finally the Georgetown University Hospital in March 1945.&lt;ref name="NCPC"/&gt;  The other two amendments including raising the height maximum on residential streets by five additional feet, and permitting residential buildings to have eight instead of ten floors.&lt;ref name="NCPC"/&gt;

==Tallest buildings in Washington, D.C.==
{{Main|List of tallest buildings in Washington, D.C.}}
The [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception]], completed in 1959, was granted an exemption to the law by the District Zoning Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalshrine.com/site/pp.asp?c=etITK6OTG&amp;b=1204295|title=THE KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS CAMPANILE AND CARILLON|publisher=Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception|accessdate=2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Shrine stands as the [[List of tallest buildings in Washington, D.C.|tallest building in Washington, D.C.]], excluding the [[Washington Monument]] ({{convert|555|ft|m}}) and the [[Hughes Memorial Tower]] ({{convert|761|ft|m}}). When the original act was passed in 1899, the [[Old Post Office Building (Washington, D.C.)|Old Post Office Building]] was grandfathered in, and remains as the tallest [[high-rise]] federal building in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/contentView.do?P=PMHP&amp;contentId=19389&amp;contentType=GSA_BASIC |title=Old Post Office (DC) |publisher=[[General Services Administration]] |accessdate=2008-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926182200/http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/contentView.do?P=PMHP&amp;contentId=19389&amp;contentType=GSA_BASIC |archivedate=2006-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tallest commercial building in Washington, D.C. (another one granted an exception) is [[One Franklin Square]], the fifth highest building in the city, which was completed in 1989 and rises to {{convert|210|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=1franklinsquare-washington-dc-usa|title=One Franklin Square|publisher=Emporis.com|accessdate=2008-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed policy changes==
The current policy of the 1910 Height Act has been in place with only small modifications for over 100 years. Its influence on the development of the city both within the monumental core and beyond has shaped Washington's skyline. In order to determine if the city could be provided some relief related to building heights within the original boundaries of the L'Enfant Plan and a loosening of federal oversight outside of the monumental core while protecting federal interests, a revisiting of policy was deemed warranted by Congress at this time.

One specific issue the District of Columbia government identified that is impacting development within the downtown core is the law prohibiting the use of the penthouse level (i.e. roof) for needs other than mechanical (i.e. HVAC equipment) structures.  For example, the height of a building as calculated by the Height Act does not include roof top structures used for mechanical needs within the total allowable height. However, if structures on the roof top (such as a pool house associated with a roof top pool) are constructed for human occupation, it is then calculated as part of the overall height of the building under the law. As a result, architects and designers currently would have to lower their building designs by an entire floor to allow for some human occupied space on the roof, if the building is to reach the maximum allowable height. By allowing usable, human occupying space at the penthouse level, the District of Columbia is arguing that there would be no real impact on the overall height limit and it would not change the "human scale" of the current landscape within the city. The current allowable height within the downtown area of the city prohibits "people's enjoyment of some of the city's greatest spaces and most striking views".&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of Ms. Harriet Tregoning, DC Office of Planning, ''Changes to the Heights Act: Shaping Washington, D.C. for the Future'', 112th US Congress, Second Session, July 19, 2012, Serial No. 112-184, pg. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The second problem identified focuses on the area of the District of Columbia outside of the original Federal City laid out by L'Enfant. This area is typically north of Florida Avenue, NW (originally known as Boundary Avenue) and east of the Anacostia River. The passage of the 1973 District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act (Home Rule Act) allowed for many local government functions to be controlled at the local level for the first time. However, within the Home Rule Act, Congress specifically stated that the DC Council does not have the authority to "enact any act, resolution or rule which permits the building of any structure within the District of Columbia in excess of the height limitations contained in Section 5 of the Height Act." &lt;ref&gt;District of Columbia Home Rule Act, Public Law No. 93-198, Title 6, Section 602(a)(6), December 24, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; The District of Columbia can argue that its local zoning regulations are as stringent, if not more stringent, in managing building heights throughout the District.&lt;ref&gt;District of Columbia Zoning Regulations, Overlay Districts, http://dcoz.dc.gov/info/overlay.shtm&lt;/ref&gt; The local government has been a strong steward of the evolving architectural landscape of the city through zoning and preservation laws since gaining control through the Home Rule Act.&lt;ref&gt;DC Historic Preservation Regulations, 10DCMR Title 10-C, Rule 10-C2002 Design and Construction Standards and Guidelines, http://www.dcregs.dc.gov/Gateway/ChapterHome.aspx?ChapterNumber=10-C20&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 19, 2013, the National Capital Planning Commission released their final recommendations regarding the Height Master Plan for Washington, DC. The plan, which looked at the question of possible changes to the Height of Buildings Act of 1910, also reviewed "who or what entity should manage building heights....[and] gave voice to questions related to Home Rule as well as the role of the U.S. Congress...".&lt;ref name="ncpc.gov"&gt;National Capital Planning Commission, ''Executive Director's Recommendation-NCPC File Number 6886'', November 19, 2013, http://www.ncpc.gov/heightstudy/&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission has put forth four recommendations for Congress' consideration that would include both keeping the status quo in one instance, but proposing policy changes in the other. The first recommendation focuses on the area of the District of Columbia within the original L'Enfant city. "Due to the concentration of federal interests within the L'Enfant City and to protect the integrity of the form and character of the nation's capital, the federal Height Act should remain in place and no changes should be made to the formula or approach for calculating allowable building height." &lt;ref name="ncpc.gov"/&gt; The second recommendation focuses on the area outside of the L'Enfant City and provides the District of Columbia government a mechanism in which to identify targeted areas in the city where they could proposed building heights to exceed the maximum currently allowed by the 1910 Height Act. "These may  be authorized through the existing ''Comprehensive Plan'' process, pending Congressional approval. Should such targeted exceptions be authorized through the ''Comprehensive Plan'', the Height Act would remain in place for all other areas both inside and outside of the L'Enfant City." &lt;ref name="ncpc.gov"/&gt; The third recommendation focuses on the important vistas that currently exist within the city. "The city's most significant viewsheds, to include without limitations, those to and from the U.S. Capitol and White House, should be further evaluated and federal and local protections established, which include policies in the Federal and District Elements of the ''Comprehensive Plan''." &lt;ref name="ncpc.gov"/&gt; Finally, the last recommendation is in response to a specific request that the District of Columbia government put forth before Congress during the hearing in 2012. The National Capital Planning Commission agrees and recommends amending "the Height Act to allow for human occupancy in existing and future penthouses, with restrictions." &lt;ref name="ncpc.gov"/&gt;

{{Homicide}}

'''Human sacrifice''' is the act of killing one or more humans, usually as an offering to a deity, as part of a [[ritual]]. Human sacrifice has been practiced in various [[culture]]s throughout history. Victims were typically ritually killed in a manner that was supposed to please or appease [[deity|gods]], [[spirit]]s or the [[veneration of the dead|deceased]]. For example, as a [[propitiation|propitiatory offering]] or as a retainer sacrifice when a king's servants are killed in order for them to continue to serve their master in the next life. Closely related practices found in some [[tribe|tribal]] societies are [[human cannibalism|cannibalism]] and [[headhunting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Michael Rudolph |title=Ritual Performances as Authenticating Practices |publisher=LIT Verlag Münster |year=2008 |page=78 |isbn=3825809528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Iron Age]], with the associated developments in religion (the [[Axial Age]]), human sacrifice was becoming less common throughout the [[Old World]], and came to be looked down upon as [[barbarian|barbaric]] in [[classical antiquity]]. In the [[New World]], however, human sacrifice continued to be widespread to varying degrees until the [[European colonization of the Americas]].

In modern times, even the practice of [[animal sacrifice]] has disappeared from many religions, and human sacrifice has become extremely rare. Most religions condemn the practice, and modern secular laws treat it as [[murder]]. In a society which condemns human sacrifice, the term '''ritual murder''' is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4098172.stm |title=Boys 'used for human sacrifice' |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-06-16 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7415502.stm |title=Kenyan arrests for 'witch' deaths |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-05-22 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution and context==
{{original research|date=September 2014}}
{{Further|Origin of religion|Magical thinking|Anthropology of religion|Homo Necans|The Golden Bough|Life-death-rebirth deity|Crucifixion of Jesus}}

The idea of human sacrifice has its roots in deep prehistory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.livescience.com/history/070611_human_sacrifice.html |title=Early Europeans Practiced Human Sacrifice |publisher= Livescience.com |date=2007-06-11 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the evolution of [[behavioral modernity|human behaviour]]. From its historical occurrences it seems mostly associated with neolithic or nomadic cultures, on the emergent edge of civilization.  
[[File:Ashanti Yam Ceremony 1817.jpg|thumb|The [[Ashanti Empire|Ashanti]] yam festival, early 19th century]]
Human sacrifice has been practiced on a number of different occasions and in many different cultures. The various rationales behind human sacrifice are the same that motivate religious sacrifice in general. Human sacrifice is intended to bring good fortune and to pacify the gods, for example in the context of the dedication of a completed building like a temple or bridge.

In ancient Japan, legends talk about ''[[hitobashira]]'' ("human pillar"), in which maidens were [[premature burial|buried alive]] at the base or near some constructions to protect the buildings against disasters or enemy attacks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.japanfile.com/modules/wiwimod/index.php?page=HistoryofJapaneseCastles&amp;back=CastleSection |title=History of Japanese Castles |publisher=Japanfile.com |accessdate=2010-05-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727160336/http://www.japanfile.com/modules/wiwimod/index.php?page=HistoryofJapaneseCastles&amp;back=CastleSection |archive-date=2010-07-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and almost identical myths appear in the Balkans ([[The Building of Skadar]] and [[Bridge of Arta]]). 

For the re-consecration of the Great Pyramid of [[Tenochtitlan]] in 1487, the [[Aztecs]] reported that they killed about 80,400 prisoners over the course of four days. According to [[Ross Hassig]], author of ''Aztec Warfare'', "between 10,000 and 80,400 persons" were sacrificed in the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, Ross (2003). "El sacrificio y las guerras floridas". [[Arqueología mexicana]], p. 46–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human sacrifice can also have the intention of winning the gods' favour in warfare. In Homeric legend, [[Iphigeneia]] was to be sacrificed by her father [[Agamemnon]] to appease [[Artemis]] so she would allow the Greeks to wage the [[Trojan War]].

In some notions of an [[afterlife]], the deceased will benefit from victims killed at his funeral. [[Mongols]], [[Scythians]], early [[Egypt]]ians and various [[Mesoamerica]]n chiefs could take most of their household, including servants and [[concubine]]s, with them to the next world. This is sometimes called a "retainer sacrifice", as the leader's retainers would be sacrificed along with their master, so that they could continue to serve him in the afterlife.

[[File:Arago – 'Supplice Sandwich'.jpg|thumb|[[Hawaii]]an sacrifice, from [[Jacques Arago]]'s account of [[Louis de Freycinet|Freycinet]]'s travels around the world from 1817 to 1820]]
Another purpose is [[divination]] from the body parts of the victim. According to [[Strabo]], [[Celt]]s stabbed a victim with a sword and divined the future from his death spasms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/4D*.html |title="Strabo Geography", Book IV Chapter 4:5, published in Vol. II of the Loeb Classical Library edition, 1923 |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Headhunting]] is the practice of taking the head of a killed adversary, for ceremonial or magical purposes, or for reasons of prestige. It was found in many pre-modern [[tribal societies]].

Human sacrifice may be a ritual practiced in a stable society, and may even be conductive to enhance societal bonds (see: [[Sociology of religion]]), both by creating a [[human bonding|bond]] unifying the sacrificing community, and in combining human sacrifice and [[capital punishment]], by removing individuals that have a negative effect on societal stability (criminals, religious heretics, foreign slaves or prisoners of war). However, outside of [[civil religion]], human sacrifice may also result in outbursts of "blood frenzy" and [[mass murder|mass killings]] that destabilize society. The bursts of human sacrifice during [[European witch-hunts]],&lt;ref&gt;Stannard, David E.; American Holocaust; Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; or during the French Revolutionary [[Reign of Terror]], show similar sociological patterns{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} (see also [[Moral panic]]).

Many cultures show traces of prehistoric human sacrifice in their mythologies and religious texts, but ceased the practice before the onset of historical records. Some see the story of [[Binding of Isaac|Abraham and Isaac]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 22) as an example of an [[Etiology|etiological myth]] explaining the abolition of human sacrifice. The Vedic ''[[Purushamedha]]'' (literally "human sacrifice") is already a purely symbolic act in its earliest attestation. According to [[Pliny the Elder]], human sacrifice in [[Ancient Rome]] was abolished by a senatorial decree in 97 [[BCE]], although by this time the practice had already become so rare that the decree was mostly a symbolic act. Human sacrifice once abolished is typically replaced by either animal sacrifice, or by the "mock-sacrifice" of [[effigy|effigies]], such as the [[Argei]] in ancient Rome.

====Ancient Egypt====
{{Further|Ancient Egyptian retainer sacrifices}}

There may be evidence of retainer sacrifice in the early dynastic period at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], when on the death of a King he would be accompanied with servants, and possibly high officials, who would continue to serve him in eternal life. The skeletons that were found had no obvious signs of trauma, leading to speculation that the giving up of life to serve the King may have been a voluntary act, possibly carried out in a drug induced state. At about 2800 BCE any possible evidence of such practices disappeared, though echoes are perhaps to be seen in the burial of statues of servants in [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] tombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jacques Kinnaer |url=http://www.ancient-egypt.org/index.html |title="Human Sacrifice", retrieved 12 May 2007 |publisher=Ancient-egypt.org |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Abydos – Life and Death at the Dawning of Egyptian Civilization |publisher= National Geographic |date=April 2005 |accessdate= May 12, 2007 |url=http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0504/feature7/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mesopotamia====
Retainer sacrifice was practised within the royal tombs of ancient Mesopotamia. Courtiers, guards, musicians, handmaidens and grooms were presumed to have committed ritual suicide by taking poison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Practice of Human Sacrifice |author=Mike Parker-Pearson |date=2002-08-19 |newspaper=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/british_prehistory/human_sacrifice_03.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Acrobats Last Tumble |first= Bruce |last=Bowe |work= Science News, Vol 174 #1 |date= July 8, 2008 |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/32999/title/Acrobats_last_tumble}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new examination of skulls from the royal cemetery at Ur, discovered in Iraq almost a century ago, appears to support a more grisly interpretation of human sacrifices associated with elite burials in ancient Mesopotamia than had previously been recognized, say archaeologists. Palace attendants, as part of royal mortuary ritual, were not dosed with poison to meet death serenely. Instead, they were put to death by having a sharp instrument, such as a pike, driven into their heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/science/27ur.html?_r=4 |title=Ritual Deaths at Ur Were Anything but Serene |author= John Noble Wilford |date= 2009-10-26 |newspaper=Nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

References in the [[Bible]] point to an awareness of human sacrifice in the history of ancient near-eastern practice.

C.|last = Asthana|first2 = Anjali|last2 = Nirmal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible then recounts that following the King's sacrifice "There was great indignation [or wrath] against Israel", and that the Israelites had to raise their siege of the Moabite capital and go away. This verse had perplexed many later Jewish and Christian commentators who tried to explain why should the Moabite King's sacrifice make God angry at the Israelites. Whatever the explanation, evidently at the time of writing such an act of sacrificing the firstborn son and heir was considered as an emergency measure, to be performed in exceptional cases where Divine favor is desperately needed - and that in such cases it might be effective.

The [[binding of Isaac]] appears in the [[Book of Genesis]] (22); the story appears in the [[Quran]] but Ismael is the one to be sacrificed. In both the Quranic and Biblical stories, [[Yahweh|God]] tests [[Abraham]] by asking him to present his son as a sacrifice on [[Moriah]]. Abraham agrees to this command without arguing. The story ends with an [[angel]] stopping Abraham at the last minute and providing a ram, caught in some nearby bushes, to be sacrificed instead. Many Bible scholars have suggested this story's origin was a remembrance of an era when human sacrifice was abolished in favour of animal sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Child Sacrifice: Returning God's Gift |first=Susan |last=Ackerman |authorlink=Susan Ackerman (biblical scholar) |work= [[Biblical Archaeology Review]] |date=June 1993 |url=http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSBR&amp;Volume=9&amp;Issue=3&amp;ArticleID=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Child Sacrifice at Carthage—Religious Rite or Population Control? |first1= Lawrence E. |last1=Stager |first2=Samuel R. |last2=Wolff |work=Biblical Archaeology Review |date= Jan–Feb 1984 |url=http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSBA&amp;Volume=10&amp;Issue=1&amp;ArticleID=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible instance of human sacrifice mentioned in the Bible is the sacrifice of [[Jephthah]]'s daughter in Judges 11. Jephthah vows to sacrifice to God whatsoever comes to greet him at the door when he returns home if he is victorious. The vow is stated in the [[Book of Judges]], 11:31: "Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the Lord's, and I will offer Him a burnt offering." When he returns from battle, his virgin daughter runs out to greet him. She begs for, and is granted, "two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends", after which "he [Jephthah] did to her as he had vowed." According to some commentators of [[rabbinic literature]], Jepthah's daughter was not sacrificed, but was forbidden to marry and remained a spinster her entire life, fulfilling the vow that she would be devoted to the Lord.&lt;ref name="Radak-MD"&gt;[[David Kimhi|Radak]], [[Book of Judges]] 11:39; ''Metzudas Dovid'' ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Roman and Greek sources, [[Phoenicia]]ns and [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] sacrificed infants to their gods. The bones of numerous infants have been found in Carthaginian archaeological sites in modern times but the subject of [[child sacrifice]] is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05146/510878.stm |title=Carthage tries to live down image as site of infanticide |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=2005-05-26 |accessdate=2010-05-25 |first=Andrew |last=Higgins |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918085258/http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05146/510878.stm |archivedate=September 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a single child cemetery called the Tophet by archaeologists, an estimated 20,000 urns were deposited.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/01/science/relics-of-carthage-show-brutality-amid-the-good-life.html?pagewanted=all Relics of Carthage Show Brutality Amid the Good Life]". The New York Times. September 1, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plutarch]] (c. 46–120 CE) mentions the practice, as do [[Tertullian]], [[Orosius]], [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Philo]]. [[Livy]] and [[Polybius]] do not. The Bible asserts that children were sacrificed at a place called the [[tophet]] ("roasting place") to the god [[Moloch]]. According to Diodorus Siculus' ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'', "There was in their city a bronze image of Cronus extending its hands, palms up and sloping toward the ground, so that each of the children when placed thereon rolled down and fell into a sort of gaping pit filled with fire."&lt;ref name="Salisbury"&gt;{{Cite book|publisher= Routledge |page=228 |last=Salisbury |first=Joyce E. |title=Perpetua's Passion: The Death and Memory of a Young Roman Woman |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plutarch, however claims that the children were already dead at the time, having been killed by their parents, whose consent—as well as that of the children—was required; Tertullian explains the acquiescence of the children as a product of their youthful trustfulness.&lt;ref name="Salisbury"/&gt;

The accuracy of such stories is disputed by some modern historians and archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;Fantar, M’Hamed Hassine. Archaeology Odyssey Nov/Dec 2000, pp. 28–31&lt;/ref&gt;

References to human sacrifice can be found in Greek historical accounts as well as mythology. The human sacrifice in mythology, the ''[[deus ex machina]]'' salvation in some versions of [[Iphigeneia]] (who was about to be sacrificed by her father [[Agamemnon]]) and her replacement with a deer by the goddess [[Artemis]], may be a vestigial memory of the abandonment and discrediting of the practice of human sacrifice among the Greeks in favour of animal sacrifice.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[Human sacrifice in ancient Rome|In ancient Rome, human sacrifice]] was infrequent but documented. Roman authors often contrast their own behavior with that of people who would commit the heinous act of human sacrifice. These authors make it clear that such practices were from a much more uncivilized time in the past, far removed.&lt;ref name="Schultz, Celia E 2010"&gt;Schultz, Celia E. "The Romans and Ritual Murder." Journal of the American Academy of Religion 78.2 (2010): 516-41&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that many ritualistic celebrations and dedications to gods used to involve human sacrifice, but have now been replaced with symbolic offerings. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/1B*.html#38.2 |title=Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, i.19, 38 |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; says that the ritual of the [[Argei]], in which straw figures were tossed into the [[Tiber river]], may have been a substitute for an original offering of elderly men. Cicero claims that puppets thrown from the Pons Suplicius by the Vestal Virgins in a processional ceremony were substitutes for the past sacrifice of old men.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero "Pro Roscio Amerino" 35.100&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Battle of Cannae|Roman defeat at Cannae]], two Gauls and two Greeks in male-female couples were buried under the [[Forum Boarium]], in a stone chamber used for the purpose at least once before.&lt;ref&gt;Livy 22.55-57&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Livy|Livy's]] description of these sacrifices, he distances the practice from Roman tradition and asserts that the past human sacrifices evident in the same location were “wholly alien to the Roman spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Livy 22.57&lt;/ref&gt; The rite was apparently repeated in 113 BCE, preparatory to an invasion of Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 22.57.4; Plutarch, ''Roman Questions'', 83 and ''Marcellus'', 3; [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A History'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), vol. 1, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; They buried both the Greeks and the two Gauls alive as a plea to the Gods to save Rome from destruction at the hands of [[Hannibal]]. When the Romans conquered the Celts in Gaul, they tortured the people by cutting off their hands and feet and leaving them to die. The Romans justified their actions by also accusing the Celts of practicing human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parker-Pearson|first1=Mike|title=The Practice of Human Sacrifice|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/british_prehistory/human_sacrifice_01.shtml|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Pliny the Elder]], human sacrifice was banned by law during the [[Roman consul|consulship]] of [[Publius Licinius Crassus Dives (consul 97 BC)|Publius Licinius Crassus]] and [[Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus (consul 97 BC)|Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus]] in 97 BCE, although by this time it was so rare that the decree was largely symbolic.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 30.3.12&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans also had traditions that centered around ritual murder, but which they did not consider to be sacrifice. Such practices included burying unchaste [[Vestal Virgin]]s alive and drowning hermaphroditic children. These were seen as reactions to extraordinary circumstances as opposed to being part of Roman tradition. Vestal Virgins who were accused of being unchaste were put to death, and a special chamber was built to bury them alive. This aim was to please the gods and restore balance to Rome.&lt;ref name="Schultz, Celia E 2010"/&gt; Human sacrifices, in the form of burying individuals alive, were not uncommon during times of panic in ancient Rome. However, the burial of unchaste Vestal Virgins was also practiced in times of peace. Their chasteness was thought to be a safeguard of the city, and even in punishment the state of their bodies was preserved in order to maintain the peace.&lt;ref&gt;Frieze (Pentelic Marble; Ht. 29"; 1. 10 1/2").

Captured enemy leaders were only occasionally executed at the conclusion of a [[Roman triumph]], and the Romans themselves did not consider these deaths a sacrificial offering.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} [[Gladiator]] combat was thought by the Romans to have originated as fights to the death among war captives at the funerals of Roman generals, and [[Christian polemic]]ists such as [[Tertullian]] considered deaths [[Recreation and spectacle in the Roman Empire|in the arena]] to be little more than human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Edwards, ''Death in Ancient Rome'' (Yale University Press, 2007), pp. 59–60; David S. Potter, "Entertainers in the Roman Empire," in ''Life, Death, and Entertainment in the Roman Empire'' (University of Michigan Press, 1999), p. 305; Tertullian, ''De spectaculis'' 12.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Over time, participants became criminals and slaves, and their death was considered a sacrifice to the [[Manes]] on behalf of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Piscinus|first1=M. Horatius|title=Human sacrifice in Ancient Rome|url=http://societasviaromana.net/Collegium_Religionis/human_sacrifice.php|website=Societas Via Romana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political rumors sometimes centered around sacrifice and in doing so, aimed to liken individuals to barbarians and show that the individual had become uncivilized. Human sacrifice also became a marker and defining characteristic of magic and bad religion.&lt;ref&gt;Rives, J. "Human Sacrifice among Pagans and Christians." The Journal of Roman Studies 85 (1995): 65-85&lt;/ref&gt;

====Celts====
{{main|Wicker man|decapitation}}

Victims meant for [[Esus]] were [[hanging|hanged]], [[Tollund Man]] being an example, those meant for [[Taranis]] [[wikt:immolate|immolated]] and those for [[Teutates]] drowned. Some, like the [[Lindow Man]], may have gone to their deaths willingly.

[[decapitation#Celts|Ritualised decapitation]] was a major religious and cultural practice which has found copious support in the archaeological record, including the numerous skulls discovered in [[Londinium]]'s [[River Walbrook]] and the 12 headless corpses at the French late [[Iron Age]] sanctuary of [[Gournay-sur-Aronde]].&lt;ref&gt;French archaeologist Jean-Louis Brunaux has written extensively on human sacrifice and the sanctuaries of [[Belgic Gaul]]. See "Gallic Blood Rites," Archaeology 54 (March/April 2001), 54–57; ''Les sanctuaires celtiques et leurs rapports avec le monde mediterranéean'', Actes de colloque de St-Riquier (8 au 11 novembre 1990) organisés par la Direction des Antiquités de Picardie et l'UMR 126 du [[French National Centre for Scientific Research|CNRS]] (Paris: Éditions Errance, 1991); "La mort du guerrier celte.

====Germanic peoples====
{{Further|Germanic paganism|bog body}}

Human sacrifice was not a particularly common occurrence among the Germanic peoples, being resorted to in exceptional situations arising from crises of an environmental (crop failure, drought, famine) or social (war) nature, often thought to derive at least in part from the failure of the king to establish and/or maintain prosperity and peace (''árs ok friðar'') in the lands entrusted to him.&lt;ref&gt;Buchholz, Peter (1993). "Pagan Scandinavian Religion" in Pulsiano, P (Ed.) ''Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia". New York: Routledge. pp. 521–525.&lt;/ref&gt; In later Scandinavian practice, human sacrifice appears to have become more institutionalised, and was repeated as part of a larger sacrifice on a periodic basis (according to Adam of Bremen every nine years).&lt;ref&gt;Simek, Rudolf (2003). ''Religion und Mythologie der Germanen''. Wissenshaftliche Buchgesellschaft: Darmstadt. pp. 58–64. {{ISBN|3-8062-1821-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] practices of human sacrifice predating the [[Viking Age]] depend on archaeology and on a few scattered accounts in [[Greco-Roman ethnography]]. For example, [[Tacitus]] reports Germanic human sacrifice to (what he [[interpretatio romana|interprets]] as) [[Germanic Mercury|Mercury]], and to [[Isis]] specifically among the [[Suebians]]. [[Jordanes]] reports how the [[Goths]] sacrificed prisoners of war to [[Teiwaz|Mars]], suspending the severed arms of the victims from the branches of trees.

By the 10th century, Germanic paganism had become restricted to [[Norse paganism|Scandinavia]]. One account by [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]] as part of his account of an [[embassy]] to the [[Volga Bulgars]] in 921 claims that [[Norse funeral|Norse warriors]] were sometimes buried with enslaved women with the belief that these women would become their wives in [[Valhalla]]. In his description of the funeral of a [[Scandinavia]]n [[tribal chief|chieftain]], a slave volunteers to die with a Norseman. After ten days of festivities, she is stabbed to death by an old woman, a sort of priestess who is referred to as [[Völva]] or "Angel of Death", and [[Ship burial|burnt together with the dead in his boat]]. This practice is evidenced archaeologically, with many male warrior burials (such as the ship burial at [[Balladoole]] on the Isle of Man, or that at [[Oseberg]] in Norway&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba59/feat4.shtml |title=British Archaeology magazine 59, June 2001 |publisher=Britarch.ac.uk |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;) also containing female remains with signs of trauma.

According to [[Adémar de Chabannes]], just before his death in 932 or 933, [[Rollo]] (founder and first ruler of the Viking [[Duchy of Normandy|principality of Normandy]]) practised human sacrifices to appease the pagan gods, and at the same time made gifts to the churches in [[Normandy]].&lt;ref&gt;François Neveux, ''A brief history of the Normans: the conquests that changed the face of Europe'', Robinson, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adam von Bremen]] recorded human sacrifices to [[Odin]] in 11th-century Sweden, at the [[Temple at Uppsala]], a tradition which is confirmed by ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' and the [[Norse saga]]s. According to the [[Ynglinga saga]], king [[Domalde]] was sacrificed there in the hope of bringing greater future harvests and the total domination of all future wars. The same saga also relates that Domalde's descendant king [[Aun]] sacrificed nine of his own sons to Odin in exchange for longer life, until the Swedes stopped him from sacrificing his last son, [[Ongentheow|Egil]].

[[Heidrek]] in the [[Hervarar saga]] agrees to the sacrifice of his son in exchange for the command over a fourth of the men of [[Reidgotaland]]. With these, he seizes the entire kingdom and prevents the sacrifice of his son, dedicating those fallen in his rebellion to Odin instead.

====Slavic peoples====
{{Main|Slavic paganism}}
In the 10th century, Persian explorer [[Ahmad ibn Rustah]] described funerary rites for the [[Rus' people|Rus']] (Scandinavian [[Norsemen]] traders in northeastern Europe) including the sacrifice of a young female slave.&lt;ref name="Early Slavs, p.120"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Z9ItAtbJ5AC&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=maurice's%20strategikon%20slavs%20XI&amp;pg=PA120#v=onepage&amp;q=sacrifice&amp;f=false |title=The early Slavs: culture and society in early medieval Eastern Europe By Paul M.

Sullivan |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 12th-century Russian [[Primary Chronicle]], prisoners of war were sacrificed to the supreme Slavic deity [[Perun]]. Sacrifices to pagan gods, along with paganism itself, were banned after the [[Baptism of Rus']] by Prince [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Vladimir I]] in the 980s.&lt;ref&gt;''Lavrentevskaia Letopis'', also called the ''Povest Vremennykh Let'', in ''Polnoe Sobranie Russkikh Letopisei'' (PSRL), vol. 1, col. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archeological findings indicate that the practice may have been widespread, at least among slaves, judging from mass graves containing the cremated fragments of a number of different people.&lt;ref name="Early Slavs, p.120" /&gt;

===China===
The [[History of China|ancient Chinese]] are known to have made drowned sacrifices of men and women to the river god [[Hebo]].&lt;ref&gt;Strassberg, Richard E. (2002). ''A Chinese Bestiary: Strange Creatures from the Guideways Through Mountains and Seas''. Berkeley: University of California Press. Page 202.&lt;/ref&gt; They also have buried [[Slavery in China|slaves]] alive with their owners upon death as part of a [[funeral]] service. This was especially prevalent during the [[Shang Dynasty|Shang]] and [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] Dynasties. During the [[Warring States]] period, [[Ximen Bao]] of [[Wei (state)|Wei]] outlawed human sacrificial practices to the river god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_aboutchina/2003-09/24/content_26349.htm |title=Ximen Bao |publisher=Chinaculture.org |date=2003-09-24 |accessdate=2010-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303174603/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_aboutchina/2003-09/24/content_26349.htm |archivedate=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chinese lore, Ximen Bao is regarded as a folk hero who pointed out the absurdity of human sacrifice.

The sacrifice of a high-ranking male's slaves, [[concubine]]s or servants upon his death (called ''Xun Zang'' 殉葬 or ''Sheng Xun'' 生殉) was a more common form. The stated purpose was to provide companionship for the dead in the afterlife. In earlier times, the victims were either killed or buried alive, while later they were usually forced to commit suicide.

Funeral human sacrifice was widely practiced in the ancient Chinese [[state of Qin]].  According to the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' by [[Han Dynasty]] historian [[Sima Qian]], the practice was started by [[Duke Wu of Qin|Duke Wu]], the tenth ruler of Qin, who had 66 people buried with him in 678 BCE. The fourteenth ruler [[Duke Mu of Qin|Duke Mu]] had 177 people buried with him in 621 BCE, including three senior government officials.&lt;ref name="shiji"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The practice would continue until [[Duke Xian of Qin (Shixi)|Duke Xian of Qin]] abolished it in 384 BCE. Modern historian Ma Feibai considers the significance of Duke Xian's abolition of human sacrifice in Chinese history comparable to that of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s abolition of slavery in American history.&lt;ref name="han"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

After the abolition by Duke Xian, funeral human sacrifice became relatively rare throughout the central parts of China. However, the [[Hongwu Emperor]] of the [[Ming Dynasty]] revived it in 1395 when his second son died and two of the prince's concubines were sacrificed. In 1464, the [[Tianshun Emperor]] in his will forbade the practice for Ming emperors and princes.

Human sacrifice was also practised by the [[Manchus]]. Following [[Nurhaci]]'s death, his wife, [[Lady Abahai]], and his two lesser consorts committed suicide. During the [[Qing Dynasty]], sacrifice of slaves was banned by the [[Kangxi Emperor]] in 1673.

===Tibet===
Human sacrifice, including [[cannibalism]], was practiced in [[Tibet]] prior to the arrival of [[Tibetan Buddhism|Buddhism]] in the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[L. Austine Waddell]], ''Tibetan Buddhism: With Its Mystic Cults, Symbolism and Mythology, and in Its Relation to Indian Buddhism'', 1895,  p. 516:
"Human sacrifice seems undoubtedly to have been regularly practised in Tibet up till the dawn there of Buddhism in the seventh century."&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevalence of human sacrifice in medieval Buddhist Tibet is less clear. The [[Lamaism|Lamas]], as professing Buddhists, could not condone blood sacrifices, and they replaced the human victims with effigies made from dough. This replacement of human victims with effigies is attributed to [[Padmasambhava]], a Tibetan saint of the mid-8th century, in Tibetan tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Richard J. Kohn |title=Lord of the Dance: The Mani Rimdu Festival in Tibet and Nepal |publisher=SUNY Press |year=2001 |page=120 |isbn=0791448916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there is some evidence that outside of lamaism, there were practices of [[tantra|tantric]] human sacrifice which survived throughout the medieval period, and possibly into modern times. The 15th-century [[Blue Annals]], a document of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], reports upon how in 13th-century Tibet the so-called "18 robber-monks" slaughtered men and women in their ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Blue Annals, ed.{{By whom|date=February 2011}} 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;697.&lt;/ref&gt; Such practices of human sacrifice were mostly replaced by animal sacrifice, or the self-infliction of wounds in religious ritual, by the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} A systematic survey of evidence for human sacrifice in 20th-century Tibet turns up three instances:

#[[Charles Alfred Bell]] reports the finding of the remains of an eight-year-old boy and a girl of the same age in a stupa on the Bhutan-Tibet border, apparently ritually killed.&lt;ref&gt;Bell,{{Clarify|date=February 2011}} 1927, p.&amp;nbsp;80.&lt;/ref&gt;
#American anthropologist Robert Ekvall in the 1950s reported some instances of human sacrifice in remote areas of the [[Himalayas]].&lt;ref&gt;Ekvall,{{Clarify|date=February 2011}} 1964, pp.&amp;nbsp;165–166, 169, 172.&lt;/ref&gt;
Based on this evidence, Grunfeld (1996) concludes that it cannot be ruled out that isolated instances of human sacrifice did survive in remote areas of Tibet until the mid-20th century, but they must have been rare enough to have left no more traces than the evidence cited above.&lt;ref name="ATG 29"&gt;[[A.

In India, human sacrifice is mainly known as "Narabali". Here "nara" means man and "bali" means sacrifice. It takes place in some part of India mostly to Find Lost Treasure. In [[Maharashtra]] Government Make it illegal to practice with the [[Anti-Superstition and Black Magic Act]]

Currently human sacrifice is very rare and almost non-existent in modern India. However, there have been at least three cases through 2003–2013 where men have been murdered in the name of human sacrifice implying the practice may still be ongoing in greater numbers in the unpoliced slums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2892333.stm | work=BBC News | first=Mahesh | last=Pandey | title=Priest 'makes human sacrifice' | date=2003-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wishesh.com/kollywood/top-stories/27650-dalit-burnt-to-death-it%E2%80%99s-human-sacrifice,-says-family.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8624269.stm | work=BBC News | first=Subir | last=Bhaumik | title=India 'human sacrifice' suspected | date=2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest evidence for human sacrifice in the Indian subcontinent dates back to the Bronze Age [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. An Indus seal from [[Harappa]] depicts the upside-down nude female figure with legs outspread and a plant issuing from her womb. The reverse side of the seal depicts a man holding a sickle and a woman seated on the ground in a posture of prayer. Many scholars interpret this scene as a human sacrifice in honor of the Mother-Goddess, although many historians doubt it.&lt;ref name="Prakash"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Prakash, Om|title=Cultural History of India|page=89|isbn=81-224-1587-3|publisher=New Age International (P) Limited Publishers|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Singh"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Singh, Upinder|title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India|page=173|isbn=978-81-317-1120-0|publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pruthi"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Pruthi, Raj|title=Prehistory and Harappan Civilization|page=164|isbn=81-7648-581-0|publisher=Kul Bhushan Nangia A.P.H Publishing Corporation|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="World"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rao |first=B.

Regarding possible [[Vedic]] mention of human sacrifice, the prevailing 19th-century view, associated above all with [[Henry Colebrooke]], was that human sacrifice did not actually take place. Those verses which referred to ''[[purushamedha]]'' were meant to be read symbolically,&lt;ref name="VD"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Kooij, K.R. van |author2=Houben, Jan E.M. |title=Violence denied: violence, non-violence and the rationalization of violence in South Asian cultural history |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |year=1999 |pages=117, 123, 129, 164, 212, 269 |isbn=90-04-11344-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a "priestly fantasy". However, [[Rajendralal Mitra]] published a defence of the thesis that human sacrifice, as had been practised in [[Bengal]], was a continuation of traditions dating back to Vedic periods.&lt;ref name="Bremmer"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Bremmer, J.N.| title=The Strange World of Human Sacrifice| publisher=Peeters Akademik| location=Leuven| year=2007| page=159| isbn=90-429-1843-8| oclc=| doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann Oldenberg]] held to Colebrooke's view; but [[Jan Gonda]] underlined its disputed status.

Human and animal sacrifice became less common during the post-Vedic period, as ''ahimsa'' (non-violence) became part of mainstream religious thought. The [[Chandogya Upanishad]] (3.17.4) includes ahimsa in its list of virtues.&lt;ref name="VD"/&gt; The impact of Sramanic religions such as Buddhism and Jainism also became known in the Indian subcontinent.
[[File:Suttee. Wellcome V0041335.jpg|thumb|Suttee-Wife burning with her dead husband]]

It was agreed even by Colebrooke, however, that by the [[Puranic]] period—at least at the time of the writing of the [[Kalika-Purana]], human sacrifice was accepted. The Kalika Purana was composed in Northeast India in the 11th century. The text states that blood sacrifice is only permitted when the country is in danger and war is expected. According to the text, the performer of a sacrifice will obtain victory over his enemies.&lt;ref name="VD"/&gt; In the medieval period, it became increasingly common. In the 7th century, [[Banabhatta]], in a description of the dedication of a temple of [[Chandi]]ka, describes a series of human sacrifices; similarly, in the 9th century, [[Haribhadra (Seng-ge Bzang-po)|Haribhadra]] describes the sacrifices to Chandika in [[Odisha]].&lt;ref name="NC"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Hastings, James (ed.) |authorlink=James Hastings |title=[[Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics]], vol 9. |publisher=Kessenger Publishing |year=2003 |pages=15, 119 |isbn=0-7661-3680-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town of [[Kuknur]] in North Karnataka there exists an ancient [[Kali]] temple, built around the 8-9th century AD, which has a history of human sacrifices.&lt;ref name="NC"/&gt;

Human sacrifice is reputed to have been performed on the altars of the [[Hatimura Temple]], a [[Shakti]] (Great Goddess) temple located at [[Silghat]], in the [[Nagaon]] district of [[Assam]]. It was built during the reign of king [[Pramatta Singha]] in 1667 ''[[Saka era|Sakabda]]'' (1745–1746 AD). It used to be an important center of [[Shaktism]] in ancient Assam. Its presiding goddess is [[Durga]] in her aspect of ''[[Mahisamardini]]'', slayer of the demon Mahisasura. It was also performed in the [[Tamresari Temple]] which was located in [[Sadiya]] under the [[Chutiya kingdom|Chutia kings]].

Human sacrifices were carried out in connection with the worship of Shakti until approximately the early modern period, and in [[Bengal]] perhaps as late as the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="Lipner"/&gt; Although not accepted by larger section of [[Hindu culture]], certain Tantric cults performed human sacrifice until around the same time, both actual and symbolic; it was a highly ritualised act, and on occasion took many months to complete.&lt;ref name="Lipner"&gt; {{Cite book|author=[[Julius J.

The [[Aztec]]s were particularly noted for practicing human sacrifice on a large scale; an offering to [[Huitzilopochtli]] would be made to restore the blood he lost, as the sun was engaged in a daily battle. Human sacrifices would prevent the end of the world that could happen on each cycle of 52 years. In the 1487 re-consecration of the [[Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan]] some estimate that 80,400 prisoners were sacrificed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/aztecs/sacrifice.htm |title=The Enigma of Aztec Sacrifice |publisher=Latinamericanstudies.org |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdis.missouri.edu/exec/data/courses2/2065/lesson01.htm |title=Science and Anthropology |publisher=Cdis.missouri.edu |accessdate=2010-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219073727/http://cdis.missouri.edu/exec/data/courses2/2065/lesson01.htm |archivedate=2010-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though numbers are difficult to quantify as all obtainable Aztec texts were destroyed by Christian missionaries during the period 1528–1548.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;George Holtker, "Studies in Comparative Religion", The Religions of Mexico and Peru, Vol. 1, CTS&lt;/ref&gt;  The Aztec, also known as Mexica, periodically sacrificed children as it was believed that the rain god, [[Tlāloc]], required the tears of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benjamin|first1=Thomas|title=The Atlantic World: Europeans, Africans, Indians and Their Shared History, 1400-1900|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ross Hassig]], author of ''Aztec Warfare'', "between 10,000 and 80,400 people" were sacrificed in the ceremony. The old reports of numbers sacrificed for special feasts have been described as "unbelievably high" by some authors&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; and that on cautious reckoning, based on reliable evidence, the numbers could not have exceeded at most several hundred per year in Tenochtitlan.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; The real number of sacrificed victims during the 1487 consecration is unknown.

[[File:Kinderopfer 2.jpg|thumb|left|Aztec burial of a sacrificed child at [[Tlatelolco (archaeological site)|Tlatelolco]]]]
Michael Harner, in his 1997 article ''The Enigma of Aztec Sacrifice'', estimates the number of persons sacrificed in central Mexico in the 15th century as high as 250,000 per year. [[Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl]], a Mexica descendant and the author of ''[[Codex Ixtlilxochitl]]'', claimed that one in five children of the Mexica subjects was killed annually. [[Victor Davis Hanson]] argues that an estimate by Carlos Zumárraga of 20,000 per annum is more plausible. Other scholars believe that, since the Aztecs always tried to intimidate their enemies, it is far more likely that they inflated the official number as a [[propaganda]] tool.&lt;ref&gt;Duverger (op. cit), 174–77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtintouch.net/~nlight/mexican%20pyramid.htm |title=New chamber confirms culture entrenched in human sacrifice |publisher=Mtintouch.net |accessdate=2010-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206150349/http://www.mtintouch.net/~nlight/mexican%20pyramid.htm |archivedate=2008-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The peoples of the Southeastern United States known as the [[Mississippian culture]] (800 to 1600 CE) have been suggested to have practiced human sacrifice, because some artifacts have been interpreted as depicting such acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/tejas/fundamentals/miss.html |title=Mississippian Civilization |publisher=Texasbeyondhistory.net |date=2003-08-06 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mound 72]] at [[Cahokia]] (the largest Mississippian site), located near modern [[St. Louis, Missouri]], was found to have numerous pits filled with mass burials thought to have been retainer sacrifices. One of several similar pit burials had the remains of 53 young women who had been strangled and neatly arranged in two layers. Another pit held 39 men, women and children who showed signs of dying a violent death before being unceremoniously dumped into the pit. Several bodies showed signs of not having been fully dead when buried and of having tried to claw their way to the surface. On top of these people another group had been neatly arranged on litters made of cedar poles and cane matting. Another group of four individuals found in the mound were interred on a low platform, with their arms interlocked. They had had their heads and hands removed. The most spectacular burial at the mound is the "[[Birdman burial#Birdman burial|Birdman burial]]". This was the burial of a tall man in his 40s, now thought to have been an important early Cahokian ruler. He was buried on an elevated platform covered by a bed of more than 20,000 marine-shell disc beads arranged in the shape of a [[falcon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lithiccastinglab.com/gallery-pages/2001augustmound72excavation1.htm |title=Cahokia and the excavation of Mound 72|accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the bird's head appearing beneath and beside the man's head, and its wings and tail beneath his arms and legs.

Surrounding the birdman were several other retainers and groups of elaborate [[grave goods]].&lt;ref name=PAUKETAT2004&gt;{{cite book| authorlink= Timothy Pauketat |last= Pauketat|first=Timothy R. |title= Ancient Cahokia and the Mississippians| publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]| year=2004| isbn=0521520665 | pages= 88–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CMSH72&gt;{{cite web|url= http://cahokiamounds.org/explore/cahokia-mounds/number/72/|title= Mound 72|publisher= Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site|accessdate= 2012-03-31|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120623230142/http://cahokiamounds.org/explore/cahokia-mounds/number/72|archivedate= 2012-06-23|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ritual sacrifice of retainers and commoners upon the death of an elite personage is also attested in the historical record among the last remaining fully Mississippian culture, the [[Natchez people|Natchez]]. Upon the death of "[[Tattooed Serpent]]" in 1725, the war chief and younger brother of the "Great Sun" or Chief of the Natchez; two of his wives, one of his sisters (nicknamed ''La Glorieuse'' by the French), his first warrior, his doctor, his head servant and the servant's wife, his nurse, and a craftsman of war clubs all chose to die and be interred with him, as well as several old women and an infant who was strangled by his parents.&lt;ref name=LAVERE&gt;{{cite book | title= Looting Spiro Mounds: An American King Tut's Tomb | author= La Vere, David | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LqcUbGAhSuEC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=death+of+tattooed+serpent&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4lxSE40WMr&amp;sig=K8-4OoE5wVLzGELo59MqD0YMuqE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QfFUUdzSJ43K9gTZzICgBA&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=death%20of%20tattooed%20serpent&amp;f=false | publisher= University of Oklahoma Press | date = 2007-04-01 |isbn=  978-0806138138 |pages= 119–122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Great honor was associated with such a sacrifice, and their kin were held in high esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | title = Violence, symbols, and the archaeological record: A case study of Cahokia's Mound 72 | author = Koziol, Kathryn M. | url = http://udini.proquest.com/view/violence-symbols-and-the-goid:821569914/ | accessdate = 2012-03-29 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130719125819/http://udini.proquest.com/view/violence-symbols-and-the-goid:821569914/ | archivedate = 2013-07-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a funeral procession with the chiefs body carried on a litter made of cane matting and cedar poles ended at the temple (which was located on top of a low [[platform mound]]); the retainers with their faces painted red and drugged with large doses of nicotine, were ritually strangled.

The [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] practiced an annual [[Pawnee mythology|Morning Star Ceremony]], which included the sacrifice of a young girl.

The study of the images seen in Moche art has enabled researchers to reconstruct the culture's most important ceremonial sequence, which began with ritual combat and culminated in the sacrifice of those defeated in battle. Dressed in fine clothes and adornments, armed warriors faced each other in ritual combat. In this hand-to-hand encounter the aim was to remove the opponent's headdress rather than kill him. The object of the combat was the provision of victims for sacrifice. The vanquished were stripped and bound, after which they were led in procession to the place of sacrifice. The captives are portrayed as strong and sexually potent. In the temple, the priests and priestesses would prepare the victims for sacrifice. The sacrificial methods employed varied, but at least one of the victims would be bled to death. His blood was offered to the principal deities in order to please and placate them.&lt;ref name="Bourget"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bourget, Steve |title=Sex, Death, and Sacrifice in Moche Religion and Visual Culture |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-292-71279-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Incas performed [[Child sacrifice in pre-Columbian cultures|child sacrifices]] during or after important events,  such as the death of the [[Sapa Inca]] (emperor) or during a [[famine]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===West Africa===
[[File:Victims for sacrifice-1793.jpg|thumb|Victims for sacrifice - from ''[[Archibald Dalzel|The history of Dahomy, an inland Kingdom of Africa]]'', 1793]]

Human sacrifice was common in West African states up to and during the 19th century. The [[Annual customs of Dahomey]] was the most notorious example, but sacrifices were carried out all along the West African coast and further inland. Sacrifices were particularly common after the death of a King or Queen, and there are many recorded cases of hundreds or even thousands of slaves being sacrificed at such events. Sacrifices were particularly common in [[Dahomey]], in the [[Benin Empire]], in what is now [[Ghana]], and in the small independent states in what is now southern [[Nigeria]]. According to [[Rudolph Rummel]], "Just consider the Grand Custom in Dahomey: When a ruler died, hundreds, sometimes even thousands, of prisoners would be slain. In one of these ceremonies in 1727, as many as 4,000 were reported killed. In addition, Dahomey had an [[Annual customs of Dahomey|Annual Custom]] during which 500 prisoners were sacrificed."&lt;ref&gt;R. Rummel (1997)"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=N1j1QdPMockC&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Death by government]''". Transaction Publishers. p.63. {{ISBN|1-56000-927-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ashanti Region]] of modern-day [[Ghana]], human sacrifice was often combined with capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Williams (1988) The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 21, No. 3. (1988), pp.&amp;nbsp;433–441&lt;/ref&gt;

In the northern parts of West Africa, human sacrifice had become rare early as Islam became more established in these areas such as the [[Hausa States]]. Human sacrifice was officially banned in the remainder of West African states only by coercion, or in some cases [[annexation]], by either the British or French. An important step was the British coercing the powerful [[Egbo]] secret society to oppose human sacrifice in 1850. This society was powerful in a large number of states in what is now south-eastern [[Nigeria]]. Nonetheless, human sacrifice continued, normally in secret, until West Africa came under firm colonial control.

The ''[[Leopard men]]'' were a West African secret society active into the mid-1900s that practised [[cannibalism]]. In theory, the ritual cannibalism would strengthen both members of the society as well as their entire tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberiapastandpresent.org/RitualKillings1900_1950b.htm |title=The Leopard Society — Africa in the mid 1900s |accessdate=April 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tanganyika]], the ''Lion men'' committed an estimated 200 murders in a single three-month period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,867859,00.html Murder by Lion], TIME&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canary Islands===
It has been reported from Spanish chronicles that the [[Guanches]] (ancient inhabitants of these islands) performed both animal and human sacrifices.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/6630296/Sacrificios_de_ni%C3%B1os_y_sustitutorios_de_ovic%C3%A1pridos_al_dios_sol_sms_en_el_litoral_atl%C3%A1ntico_norteafricano_Child_and_Substitute_Ovicaprids_Sacrifices_to_the_Sun_God_%C5%A1m%C5%A1_in_the_North_African_Atlantic_Coast_ Sacrificios entre los Aborígenes canarios]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer solstice in [[Tenerife]] children were sacrificed by being thrown from a cliff into the sea.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt; These children were brought from various parts of the island for the purpose of sacrifice. Likewise, when an aboriginal king died his subjects should also assume the sea, along with the embalmers who embalmed the [[Guanche mummies]].

In [[Gran Canaria]],  bones of children were found mixed with those of lambs and goat kids and on Tenerife, amphorae have been found with the remains of children inside. This suggests a different kind of ritual infanticide to those who were thrown off the cliffs.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt;

==Prohibition in major religions==
===Judaism===
[[Judaism]] explicitly forbids human sacrifice, regarding it as murder. Jews view the ''[[Binding of Isaac#Jewish views|Akedah]]'' as central to the abolition of human sacrifice.  Some [[Talmud|Talmudic]] scholars assert that its replacement is the sacrificial offering of animals at the Temple —using Exodus 13:2–12f; 22:28f; 34:19f; Numeri 3:1ff; 18:15; Deuteronomy 15:19—others view that as being superseded by the symbolic ''[[Pars pro toto|pars-pro-toto]]'' sacrifice of the covenant of [[circumcision]]. Leviticus 20:2 and Deuteronomy 18:10 specifically outlaw the giving of children to [[Moloch]], making it punishable by stoning; the [[Tanakh]] subsequently denounces human sacrifice as barbaric customs of Moloch worshippers (e.g. Psalms 106:37ff).

Judges chapter 11 features a [[Biblical judges|Judge]] named [[Jephthah]] vowing that "whatsoever cometh forth from the doors of my house to meet me shall surely be the Lord's, and I will offer it up as a burnt-offering" in gratitude for God's help with a military battle against the Ammonites.&lt;ref name="Brenner-56"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brenner|first=Athalya|author-link=Athalya Brenner|title=Judges: a feminist companion to the Bible|year=1999|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-84127-024-1|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=de&amp;id=hT2vAwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=josephus++Jephthah++++burned++daughter+altar&amp;q=Yahveh%27s+altar#v=snippet&amp;q=Josephus&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much to Jephthah's dismay, his only daughter greeted him upon his triumphant return. Judges 11:39 states that Jephthah did as he had vowed, but "shies away from explicitly depicting her sacrifice, which leads some ancient and modern interpreters (e.g., [[Radak]]) to suggest that she was not actually killed."&lt;ref name="TJSB-524"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berlin|first1=Adele|last2=Brettler|first2=Marc Zvi|title=Jewish study bible|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-0199978465|page=524|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yErYBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17&amp;dq=The+Jewish+Study+Bible&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSnN-Dv4TNAhVJDSwKHSVeDq0Q6AEINzAA#v=snippet&amp;q=%22and%20he%20did%20to%20her%20as%20he%20had%20vowed%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Mishnah]] he was under no obligation to keep the ill-phrased, illegal vow. According to Rabbi [[Johanan HaSandlar|Jochanan]], in his commentary on the Mishnah, it was Jephthah's obligation to pay the vow in money.&lt;ref name="Brenner-56"/&gt; According to the [[meforshim|commentators of the rabbinic Jewish tradition]], Jepthah's daughter was not sacrificed, but was forbidden to marry and remained a spinster her entire life.&lt;ref name="Radak-MD" /&gt;

The 1st-century CE [[Hellenistic Judaism|Jewish-Hellenistic]] historian [[Flavius Josephus]], however, stated that Jephthah "sacrificed his child as a burnt-offering—a sacrifice neither sanctioned by the law nor well-pleasing to God; for he had not by reflection probed what might befall or in what aspect the deed would appear to them that heard of it".&lt;ref name="Brenner-73"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brenner|first=Athalya|author-link=Athalya Brenner|title=Judges: a feminist companion to the Bible|year=1999|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-84127-024-1|page=73|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=de&amp;id=hT2vAwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=josephus++Jephthah++++burned++daughter+altar&amp;q=Yahveh%27s+altar#v=snippet&amp;q=Josephus&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latin philosopher [[pseudo-Philo]], late first century CE, wrote that Jephthah burnt his daughter because he could find no sage in Israel who would cancel his vow. In other words, in the opinion of the Latin philosopher, this story of an ill-phrased vow consolidates that human sacrifice is not an order or requirement by [[God in Judaism|God]], but the punishment for those who illegally vowed to sacrifice humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women's Bible Commentary|author1=Carol Ann Newsom |author2=Sharon H.

[[File:Ofiara Abrahama1.jpg|thumb|An angel ends the [[Binding of Isaac]] by [[Abraham]] - believed to be a foreshadowing of the ''human sacrifice'' of Christ (''The Offering of Abraham, Genesis 22:1-13'', workshop of [[Rembrandt]], 1636; ''[[Christian art]]'')]]

===Christianity===
Christianity developed the belief that the story of [[binding of Isaac|Isaac's binding]] was a [[foreshadowing]] of the sacrifice of [[Christ]], whose death and resurrection enabled the salvation and atonement for man from its sins, including [[original sin]]. There is a tradition that the site of Isaac's binding, [[Moriah]], later became [[Jerusalem]], the city of Jesus's future crucifixion.&lt;ref&gt;http://"Voices From the Children of Abraham", [www.newmantoronto.com/040311childrenofabraham2.htm ]&lt;/ref&gt; The beliefs of most Christian denominations hinge upon the [[substitutionary atonement]] of the sacrifice of [[God the Son]], which was necessary for salvation in the afterlife. According to Christian doctrine, each individual person on earth must participate in, and/or receive the benefits of, this divine human sacrifice for the atonement of their [[Christian views on sin|sins]]. Early Christian sources explicitly described this event as a sacrificial offering, with Christ in the role of both [[priest]] and human sacrifice, although starting with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], some writers, such as [[John Locke]], have disputed the model of Jesus' death as a propitiatory sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Christian Theology: An Introduction |last= McGrath |first= Alister E. |pages= 390&amp;ndash;395 |edition= Second |publisher= [[Blackwell Publishing|Wiley-Blackwell]] |year= 1997 |isbn= 0-631-19849-0 }} According to [[Alister McGrath]], early sources describing a human sacrifice include the [[New Testament]]'s [[Letter to the Hebrews]] and writings by [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Athanasius of Alexandria]]. Later sources, besides Locke, include [[Thomas Chubb]] and [[Horace Bushnell]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[René Girard]] has argued that the Gospels are a radical subversion of pagan notions of sacrifice. Instead of humans offering victims to angry deities (as is always the case with pagan sacrifice), Jesus, as the incarnate presence of God (YHWH), offers himself into the hands of violent humans to reveal what the Hebrew prophets meant when they said that "the Lord" (YHWH) rejects sacrifice and desires justice and mercy instead. The "self-sacrifice" of Christ is, therefore, a revelation that violent sacrifice has nothing to do with God. It is simply murder—which the story of Cain and Abel showed at the very dawn of civilisation (Cain is called "father of cities"). Saint Paul calls on Christians in his Letter to the Romans (12:1) to do the very opposite of conventional religious sacrifice: "offer your own bodies as a living sacrifice", he says, instead of the dead bodies of others. In other words, the only kind of "sacrifice" acceptable to God is to give one's life for others, which means to live one's life for others, even unto death, just as Jesus did. It is in that sense that Christ "sacrificed" himself; and in that sense that his "pure sacrifice" is celebrated in the sacrament of the eucharist.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

[[Eastern Orthodox Christian|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholic]] Christians believe that this "pure sacrifice" as Christ's self-giving in love is made present in the [[sacrament]] of the [[Eucharist]]. In this tradition, bread and wine becomes the "[[Real Presence]]" (the literal [[Incarnation#Christianity|carnal Body]] and Blood of the Risen Christ. Receiving the Eucharist is a central part of the religious life of Catholic and Orthodox Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Sacrifice of the Mass}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oca.org/QA.asp?ID=202&amp;SID=3 |title="Sacrifice of the Mass", Orthodox Church of America |publisher=Oca.org |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Protestant]] traditions do not share the belief in the Real Presence but otherwise are varied, for example, they may believe that in the bread and wine, Christ is present only spiritually, not in the sense of a change in substance ([[Methodism]])&lt;ref name="wesley"&gt;{{cite wikisource |title= Articles of Religion |wslink= Articles of Religion (Methodist) |at= Article XVIII—Of the Lord's Supper |author= John Wesley |authorlink= John Wesley }}&lt;/ref&gt; or that the bread and wine of communion are a merely symbolic reminder ([[Baptist]]).&lt;ref name="baptist supper"&gt;{{cite book |title= Understanding Four Views on the Lord's Supper |series= Counterpoints: Church Life |editor1-first= Paul E.

In medieval Irish Catholic texts, there is mention of the early church in Ireland supposedly containing the practice of burying sacrificial victims underneath churches in order to consecrate them. This may have a relation to pagan Celtic practices of foundation sacrifice. The most notable example of this is the case of [[Odran of Iona]] a companion of [[St Columba]] who (according to legend) volunteered to die and be buried under the church of the monastery of Iona. However, there is no evidence that such things ever happened in reality and contemporary records closer to the time period have no mention of a practice like this.&lt;ref&gt;Adomnan of Iona. Life of St Columba. ed. by Richard Sharpe. Penguin Books, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern religions===
{{Main|Ahimsa}}
Many traditions of [[Eastern religions]] including [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and some sects of [[Hinduism]] embrace the doctrine of ''[[ahimsa]]'' (non-violence) which imposes [[vegetarianism]] and outlaws animal as well as human sacrifice.

In the case of Buddhism, both ''bhikkhus'' (monks) and ''bhikkhunis'' (nuns) were forbidden to take life in any form as part of the [[Vinaya|monastic code]], while non-violence was promoted among laity through encouragement of the [[Five Precepts]]. Across the Buddhist world both meat and alcohol are strongly discouraged as offerings to a Buddhist altar, with the former being synonymous with sacrifice, and the latter a violation of the Five Precepts.

In [[Hinduism]], based on the principle of ''ahimsa'', any human or animal sacrifice is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;By Walli, Koshelya: ''The Conception of Ahimsa in Indian Thought'', Varanasi 1974, p. 113-145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Ahiṃsā: Non-violence in Indian Tradition", by Tähtinen, p. 2–5;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Death and Dying, p. 12, by Glennys Howarth, Oliver Leaman&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th and 20th centuries, prominent figures of Indian spirituality such as [[Swami Vivekananda]],&lt;ref&gt;''Religious Vegetarianism'', ed. [[Kerry S. Walters]] and Lisa Portmess, Albany 2001, pp. 50–52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ramana Maharshi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beasyouare.info/beasyouare.html |title=Ramana Maharishi: ''Be as you are'' |publisher=Beasyouare.info |accessdate=2010-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419081500/http://www.beasyouare.info/beasyouare.html |archivedate=2010-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swami Sivananda]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlshq.org/teachings/ahimsa.htm |title=Swami Sivananda: ''Bliss Divine'', pp. 3–8 |publisher=Dlshq.org |date=2005-12-11 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami]]&lt;ref&gt;''Religious Vegetarianism'' p. 56–60.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasised the importance of ahimsa.

In Jainism, although ahimsa is considered its foremost vow, the extension of this to [[Self-denial|self-sacrifice]] at times may be considered equivalent to human sacrifice (or [[Suicide methods#Ritual suicide|ritual suicide]]), especially by those who oppose the Jain practice of Sallekhana ([[Suicide methods#Starvation|fasting to death]]), whereas Jaina scriptures supposedly (or interpretively) counter that ''Sallekhana leads to Ahimsa'', because their concept of [[simple living]] could even become excessive to that end (as it may be impossible to [[Life|exist]] more or less [[Altruism#Jainism|selflessly]]), when lifestyle remains a preclusion to the state of [[Moksha#Jainism|nirvana]], and likewise a notion of transcending the [[Paradox|problem]] (of how to live and let live), with one's bodily sacrifice being a voluntary spiritual practice; perhaps the courts having ruled back and forth on it as a legal matter suggests that the paradox (or debatability) of Ahimsa versus Sallekhana, which is essentially that of [[nonviolence]] amounting to [[violence]], involves determining whether such a death is a physical act of human sacrifice or lack thereof.

In their effort to discredit [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the [[People's Republic of China]] as well as  [[Kuomintang|Chinese nationalist]]s in the [[Republic of China]] make frequent and emphatic references to the historical practice of [[human sacrifice in Tibet]], portraying the [[People's Liberation Army invasion of Tibet (1950–1951)|1950 People's Liberation Army invasion of Tibet]] as an act of humanitarian intervention.
According to Chinese sources, in the year 1948, 21 individuals were murdered by state sacrificial priests from [[Lhasa]] as part of a ritual of enemy destruction, because their organs were required as magical ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Making of Modern Tibet|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CNHKBgAAQBAJ|publisher = Routledge|date = 2015-02-24|isbn = 9781317455837|first = A.

====Bangladesh====
In March 2010, a 26-year-old labourer in [[Bangladesh]] was killed by fellow workers on the orders of the owners after a fortune teller suggested that a human sacrifice would yield highly prized “red bricks”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1259736/Man-beheaded-redden-bricks.html Bangladeshi man beheaded by labourers to 'redden bricks' after fortune teller suggested sacrifice], March 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
Human sacrifice is illegal in [[India]]. However, a few cases do occur in remote and underdeveloped regions of the country, where modernity has not penetrated well and tribal/semi-tribal groups adhere to cultural practices as they did over the course of millennia. According to the ''[[Hindustan Times]]'', there was an incident of human sacrifice in western [[Uttar Pradesh]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;"After a rash of similar killings in the area—according to an unofficial tally in the English language-language ''Hindustan Times'', there have been 25 human sacrifices in western Uttar Pradesh in the last six months alone—police have cracked down against tantriks, jailing four and forcing scores of others to close their businesses and pull their ads from newspapers and television stations. The killings and the stern official response have focused renewed attention on tantrism, an amalgam of mysticism practices that grew out of Hinduism. &amp;mdash; ''In India, case links mysticism, murder'' – John Lancaster, [[Washington Post]], 29 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, police in [[Khurja]] reported "dozens of sacrifices" in the period of half a year in 2006, by followers of [[Kali]], the goddess of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=The Observer''  |author=Dan McDougall in Khurja, India |date= March 5, 2006 |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1723910,00.html |location=London |title=Indian cult kills children for goddess}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Stay informed today |author2=every day |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2013/08/atheism-india |title=Atheism in India: He’s not the son of God |publisher=Economist.com |date=2013-08-22 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dan McDougall in Khurja, India |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/05/india.theobserver |title=Indian cult kills children for goddess: 'Holy men' blamed for inciting dozens of deaths |publisher=Theguardian.com |date=2006-03-05 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/human-sacrifice--beheaded-body-found-near-kali-temple-in-birbhum/607102/ |title=Human sacrifice?

In 2015 during the ''Granite scam'' investigations of [[Tamil Nadu]] there were reports of possible human sacrifices in the [[Madurai region]] to pacify goddess [[Shakthi]] for getting power to develop the illegal granite business.

===Africa===
{{Further|Medicine murder|Child sacrifice in Uganda}}

Human sacrifice, in the context of religious ritual, still occurs in other traditional religions, for example in [[muti]] killings in [[South Africa]] and other ritual killings in [[West African Vodun]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} When the purpose of the practice is to procure wealth for the one who commissions the act, a human sacrifice is called a [[Money ritual]]. Human sacrifice is no longer officially condoned in any country, and such cases are regarded as murder.

In January, 2008, [[Milton Blahyi]] of [[Liberia]] confessed being part of human sacrifices which "included the killing of an innocent child and plucking out the heart, which was divided into pieces for us to eat." He fought against [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]]'s militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Paye |first=Jonathan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7200101.stm |title=news.bbc.co.uk, I ate children's hearts, ex-rebel says |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-01-22 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceania===

====Papua New Guinea====
[[Steven Tari]], a [[Papua New Guinea]] cult leader known as "Black Jesus" was castrated and disemboweled by villagers after being hacked to death. Police said that he was hunted down by a mob of villagers, after allegedly killing a teenage girl during a sacrifice ritual.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/papua-new-guinea-black-jesus-cannibal-castrated-503054 Papua New Guinea: 'Cannibal Black Jesus' Castrated and Disemboweled by Villagers]", International Business Times. 2013-09-02. Retrieved 2015-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ritual murder==
Ritual killings perpetrated by individuals or small groups within a society that denounces them as simple murder are difficult to classify as either "human sacrifice" or mere pathological homicide because they lack the societal integration of [[sacrifice]] proper.

The instances closest to "ritual killing" in the criminal history of modern society would be pathological [[serial killer]]s such as the [[Zodiac Killer]], and [[mass suicide]]s with a [[doomsday cult]] background, such as the [[Peoples Temple]], the [[Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God]], the [[Order of the Solar Temple]] or the [[Heaven's Gate (cult)|Heaven's Gate]] incidents.{{According to whom|date=November 2011}} Other examples include the "[[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]] killings" attributed to American cult leader [[Adolfo Constanzo]] and the "Superior Universal Alignment" killings in 1990s Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Lewan, Satanic Cult Killings Spread Fear in Southern Brazil, The Associated Press, 26 October 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''IETF language tag''' is an abbreviated [[language code]] (for example, ''en'' for English, ''pt-BR'' for Brazilian Portuguese, or ''nan-Hant-TW'' for Min Nan Chinese as spoken in Taiwan using traditional Han characters) defined by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) in the ''[[Best Current Practice|BCP]] 47'' document series, which is currently composed of normative RFC 5646 (referencing the related RFC 5645) and RFC 4647, along with the normative content of the ''[[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] Language Subtag Registry''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/|title=Language subtag lookup app:|last=|first=|date=|work=r12a.github.io|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-tag-extensions-registry&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iana.org/protocols/|title=IANA — Protocol Registries|work=iana.org|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Components of language tags are drawn from [[ISO 639]], [[ISO 15924]], [[ISO 3166-1]], and [[UN M.49]].

These language tags are used in a number of modern computing standards, including those from the IETF related to the Internet protocols such as [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.3.1|title=RFC 7231 - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content|work=ietf.org|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; those from the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] such as [[HTML]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/dirlang.html#h-8.1|title=Language information and text direction|work=w3.org|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[XML]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/#sec-lang-tag|title=Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition)|work=w3.org|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/#11iTXt|title=Portable Network Graphics (PNG) Specification (Second Edition)|work=w3.org|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and those from other private standardization bodies such as [[SGML]] or [[Unicode]] (in some of its standard annexes), or from national or regional standard bodies like [[ANSI]] or [[Ecma International|Ecma]] (for example in some of their standards related to computing languages, or bibliographic references and documents classification used in institutional libraries).

== History ==
IETF language tags were first defined in RFC 1766, edited by [[Harald Tveit Alvestrand]], published in March 1995. The tags used ISO 639 two-letter language codes and ISO 3166 two-letter country codes, and allowed registration of whole tags that included variant or script subtags of three to eight letters.

In January 2001 this was updated by RFC 3066, which added the use of ISO 639-2 three-letter codes, permitted subtags with digits, and adopted the concept of language ranges from HTTP/1.1 to help with matching of language tags.

The next revision of the specification came in September 2006 with the publication of RFC 4646 (the main part of the specification), edited by Addison Philips and [[Mark Davis (Unicode)|Mark Davis]] and &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 4647&lt;/nowiki&gt; (which deals with matching behaviour).  &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 4646&lt;/nowiki&gt; introduced a more structured format for language tags, added the use of ISO 15924 four-letter script codes and UN M.49 three-digit geographical region codes, and replaced the old registry of tags with a new registry of subtags. The small number of previously defined tags that did not conform to the new structure were grandfathered in order to maintain compatibility with &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 3066&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

The current version of the specification, RFC 5646, was published in September 2009. The main purpose of this revision was to incorporate three-letter codes from ISO 639-3 and 639-5 into the Language Subtag Registry, in order to increase the interoperability between ISO 639 and BCP 47.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ltru-charter.html Language Tag Registry Update charter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210235400/http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ltru-charter.html |date=2007-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Syntax of language tags ==
Each language tag is composed of one or more "subtags" separated by hyphens (-). Each subtag is composed of basic Latin letters or digits only.

With the exceptions of private-use language tags beginning with an ''x-'' prefix and grandfathered language tags (including those starting with an ''i-'' prefix and those previously registered in the old Language Tag Registry), subtags occur in the following order:
* A single ''primary language subtag'' based on a two-letter language code from [[ISO 639-1]] (2002) or a three-letter code from [[ISO 639-2]] (1998), [[ISO 639-3]] (2007) or [[ISO 639-5]] (2008), or registered through the BCP 47 process and composed of five to eight letters;
* Up to three optional ''extended language subtags'' composed of three letters each, separated by hyphens; (There is currently no extended language subtag registered in the Language Subtag Registry without an equivalent and preferred primary language subtag. This component of language tags is preserved for backwards compatibility and to allow for future parts of ISO 639.)
* An optional ''script subtag'', based on a four-letter script code from [[ISO 15924]] (usually written in [[Letter_case#Headings_and_publication_titles|Title Case]]);
* An optional ''region subtag'' based on a two-letter country code from [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] (usually written in upper case), or a three-digit code from [[UN M.49]] for geographical regions;
* Optional ''variant subtags'', separated by hyphens, each composed of five to eight letters, or of four characters starting with a digit; (Variant subtags are registered with IANA and not associated with any external standard.)
* Optional ''extension subtags'', separated by hyphens, each composed of a single character, with the exception of the letter ''x'', and a hyphen followed by one or more subtags of two to eight characters each, separated by hyphens;
* An optional ''private-use subtag'', composed of the letter ''x'' and a hyphen followed by subtags of one to eight characters each, separated by hyphens.

Subtags are not [[case-sensitive]], but the specification recommends using the same case as in the Language Subtag Registry, where region subtags are [[UPPERCASE]], script subtags are [[titlecase|Title Case]], and all other subtags are [[lowercase]]. This capitalization follows the recommendations of the underlying ISO standards.

Optional script and region subtags are preferred to be omitted when they add no distinguishing information to a language tag.  For example, ''es'' is preferred over ''es-Latn'', as Spanish is fully expected to be written in the Latin script; ''ja'' is preferred over ''ja-JP'', as Japanese ''as used in Japan'' does not differ markedly from Japanese as used elsewhere.

Not all linguistic regions can be represented with a valid region subtag: the subnational regional dialects of a primary language are registered as variant subtags.  For example, the ''valencia'' variant subtag for the [[Valencian]] dialect of [[Catalan language|Catalan]] is registered in the Language Subtag Registry with the prefix ''ca''.  As this dialect is spoken almost exclusively in Spain, the region subtag ''ES'' can normally be omitted.

IETF language tags have been used as [[locale (computer software)|locale]] identifiers in many applications.  It may be necessary for these applications to establish their own strategy for defining, encoding and matching locales if the strategy described in &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 4647&lt;/nowiki&gt; is not adequate.

The use, interpretation and matching of IETF language tags is currently defined in &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 5646&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 4647&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  The Language Subtag Registry lists all currently valid public subtags.  Private-use subtags are not included in the Registry as they are implementation-dependent and subject to private agreements between third parties using them.  These private agreements are out of scope of BCP 47.

== Relation to other standards ==
Although some types of subtags are derived from [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] or [[United Nations|UN]] core standards, they do not follow these standards absolutely, as this could lead to the meaning of language tags changing over time. In particular, a subtag derived from a code assigned by [[ISO 639]], [[ISO 15924]], [[ISO 3166]], or [[UN M.49]] remains a valid (though deprecated) subtag even if the code is withdrawn from the corresponding core standard. If the standard later assigns a new meaning to the withdrawn code, the corresponding subtag will still retain its old meaning.

This stability was introduced in RFC 4646.

=== ISO 639-3 and ISO 639-1 ===
RFC 4646 defined the concept of an "extended language subtag" (sometimes referred to as ''extlang''), although no such subtags were registered at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RFC 5645 and RFC 5646 added primary language subtags corresponding to [[ISO 639-3]] codes for all languages that did not already exist in the Registry. In addition, codes for languages encompassed by certain macrolanguages were registered as extended language subtags. Sign languages were also registered as extlangs, with the prefix ''sgn''. These languages may be represented either with the subtag for the encompassed language alone (''cmn'' for Mandarin) or with a language-extlang combination (''zh-cmn''). The first option is preferred for most purposes. The second option is called "extlang form" and is new in RFC 5646.

Whole tags that were registered prior to RFC 4646 and are now classified as "grandfathered" or "redundant" (depending on whether they fit the new syntax) are deprecated in favor of the corresponding ISO 639-3–based language subtag, if one exists. To list a few examples, ''nan'' is preferred over ''zh-min-nan'' for [[Min Nan]] Chinese; ''hak'' is preferred over ''i-hak'' and ''zh-hakka'' for [[Hakka Chinese]]; and ''ase'' is preferred over ''sgn-US'' for [[American Sign Language]].

=== ISO 639-5 and ISO 639-2 ===
[[ISO 639-5]] defines language collections with alpha-3 codes in a different way than they were initially encoded in ISO 639-2 (including one code already present in ISO 639-1). Specifically, the language collections are now all defined in ISO 639-5 as inclusive, rather than some of them being defined exclusively. This means that language collections have a broader scope than before, in some cases where they could encompass languages that were already encoded separately within ISO 639-2.

For example, the ISO 639-2 code ''afa'' was previously associated with the name "Afro-Asiatic (Other)", excluding languages such as Arabic that already had their own code. In ISO 639-5, this collection is named "Afro-Asiatic languages" and includes all such languages. ISO 639-2 changed the exclusive names in 2009 to match the inclusive ISO 639-5 names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_changes.php|title=ISO 639-2 Language Code List - Codes for the representation of names of languages (Library of Congress)|work=loc.gov|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid breaking implementations that may still depend on the older (exclusive) definition of these collections, ISO 639-5 defines a grouping type attribute for all collections that were already encoded in ISO 639-2 (such grouping type is not defined for the new collections added only in ISO 639-5).

BCP 47 defines a "Scope" property to identify subtags for language collections. However, it does not define any given collection as inclusive or exclusive, and does not use the ISO 639-5 grouping type attribute, although the description fields in the Language Subtag Registry for these subtags match the ISO 639-5 (inclusive) names. As a consequence, BCP 47 language tags that include a primary language subtag for a collection may be ambiguous as to whether the collection is intended to be inclusive or exclusive.

ISO 639-5 does not define precisely which languages are members of these collections; only the hierarchical classification of collections is defined, using the inclusive definition of these collections. Because of this, RFC 5646 does not recommend the use of subtags for language collections for most applications, although they are still preferred over subtags whose meaning is even less specific, such as "Multiple languages" and "Undetermined".

In contrast, the classification of individual languages within their macrolanguage is standardized, in both ISO 639-3 and the Language Subtag Registry.

=== ISO 15924, ISO/IEC 10646 and Unicode ===
Script subtags were first added to the Language Subtag Registry when RFC 4646 was published, from the list of codes defined in [[ISO 15924]]. They are encoded in the language tag after primary and extended language subtags, but before other types of subtag, including region and variant subtags.

Some primary language subtags are defined with a property named "Suppress-Script" which indicates the cases where a single script can usually be assumed by default for the language, even if it can be written with another script. When this is the case, it is preferable to omit the script subtag, to improve the likelihood of successful matching. A different script subtag can still be appended to make the distinction when necessary. For example, ''yi'' is preferred over ''yi-Hebr'' in most contexts, because the Hebrew script subtag is assumed for the [[Yiddish]] language.

As another example, ''zh-Hans-SG'' may be considered equivalent to ''zh-Hans'', because the region code is probably not significant; the written form of Chinese used in Singapore uses the same simplified Chinese characters as in other countries where Chinese is written. However, the script subtag is maintained because it is significant.

Note that ISO 15924 includes some codes for script variants (for example, ''Hans'' and ''Hant'' for simplified and traditional forms of Chinese characters) that are unified within [[Unicode]] and [[ISO/IEC 10646]]. These script variants are most often encoded for bibliographic purposes, but are not always significant from a linguistic point of view (for example, ''Latf'' and ''Latg'' script codes for the Fraktur and Gaelic variants of the Latin script, which are mostly encoded with regular Latin letters in Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646). They may occasionally be useful in language tags to expose orthographic or semantic differences, with different analysis of letters, diacritics, and digraphs/trigraphs as default grapheme clusters, or differences in letter casing rules.

=== ISO 3166-1 and UN M.49 ===
{{Further|Country code top-level domain#Historical ccTLDs}}

Two-letter region subtags are based on codes assigned, or "exceptionally reserved", in [[ISO 3166-1]]. If the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency were to reassign a code that had previously been assigned to a different country, the existing BCP 47 subtag corresponding to that code would retain its meaning, and a new region subtag based on [[UN M.49]] would be registered for the new country. UN M.49 is also the source for numeric region subtags for geographical regions, such as &lt;code&gt;005&lt;/code&gt; for South America.

Region subtags are used to specify the variety of a language "as used in" a particular region. They are appropriate when the variety is regional in nature, and can be captured adequately by identifying the countries involved, as when distinguishing [[British English]] (''en-GB'') from [[American English]] (''en-US''). When the difference is one of script or script variety, as for [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified]] versus [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional]] Chinese characters, it should be expressed with a script subtag instead of a region subtag; in this example, ''zh-Hans'' and ''zh-Hant'' should be used instead of ''zh-CN'' and ''zh-HK''.

When a distinct language subtag exists for a language that could be considered a regional variety, it is often preferable to use the more specific subtag instead of a language-region combination. For example, ''ar-DZ'' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] as used in [[Algeria]]) may be better expressed as ''arq'' for [[Algerian Arabic|Algerian Spoken Arabic]].

== Extensions ==
''Extension subtags'' (not to be confused with ''extended language subtags'') allow additional information to be attached to a language tag that does not necessarily serve to identify a language. One use for extensions is to encode locale information, such as calendar and currency.

Extension subtags are composed of multiple hyphen-separated character strings, starting with a single character (other than ''x''), called a ''singleton''. Each extension is described in its own [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] [[Request for Comments|RFC]], which identifies a Registration Authority to manage the data for that extension. [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] is responsible for allocating singletons.

Two extensions have been assigned as of January 2014.

=== Extension T (Transformed Content) ===
Extension T allows a language tag to include information on how the tagged data was transliterated, transcribed, or otherwise transformed. For example, the tag ''en-t-jp'' could be used for content in English that was translated from the original Japanese. Additional substrings could indicate that the translation was done mechanically, or in accordance with a published standard.

Extension T is described in RFC 6497, published in February 2012. The Registration Authority is the [[Unicode Consortium]].

=== Extension U (Unicode Locale) ===
Extension U allows a wide variety of locale attributes found in the [[Common Locale Data Repository]] (CLDR) to be embedded in language tags. These attributes include calendar and time zone data, collation order, currency, number system, and keyboard identification. Tags containing a ''u-'' extension are more likely to be used to identify locale data sets than for purely linguistic content.

Some examples include:
* ''ar-u-nu-latn'' represents Arabic-language content using [[Arabic numerals|Basic Latin digits]] (0 through 9) instead of [[Eastern Arabic numerals|Arabic-script digits]] (٠ through ٩).
* ''he-IL-u-ca-hebrew-tz-jeruslm'' represents Hebrew as spoken in Israel, using the traditional [[Hebrew calendar]], and in the "Asia/Jerusalem" time zone as identified in the [[tz database]].

Extension U is described in RFC 6067, published in December 2010. The Registration Authority is the [[Unicode Consortium]].

'''Japanese nationality''' is a legal designation and set of rights granted to those people who have met the criteria for [[citizenship]] by parentage or by [[naturalization]]. Nationality is in the jurisdiction of the [[Minister of Justice (Japan)|Minister of Justice]] and is generally governed by the Nationality Law of 1950.

==Nationality by birth==
[[Japan]] is a strict&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/12/06/national/crime-legal/tokyo-court-upholds-deportation-order-thai-teenager-born-raised-japan/ |title=Tokyo court upholds deportation order for Thai teenager born and raised in Japan |year=2016 |accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' state as opposed to ''[[jus soli]]'' state, meaning that it attributes citizenship by blood and not by location of birth. In practice, it can be by parentage and not by descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.moj.go.jp/MINJI/kokusekiho.html |title=The Nationality Law (Law No.147 of 1950, as amended by Law No.268 of 1952, Law No.45 of 1984, Law No.89 of 1993 and Law.No.147 of 2004,Law No.88 of 2008) Article 8 |year=2008 |accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Article 2 of the Nationality Act provides three situations in which a person can become a Japanese national at birth:

# When [[wiktionary:either|either]] parent is a Japanese national at the time of birth. If born abroad and the child has a foreign nationality at birth, the child must be registered within three months of birth or otherwise will have to live in Japan before the age of 20 and notify the MOJ.
# When either parent&lt;ref&gt;From Article 3 of the 1984 revision, enforced 1985 ([http://www.houko.com/00/01/S59/045.HTM 昭和59年法律第45号附則第3条]):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"父又は母が現に日本国民であるとき、又はその死亡の時に日本国民であつたときは、法務大臣に届け出ることによつて、日本の国籍を取得することができる。"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"If the father ''or mother'' [e.m.] is currently a Japanese citizen or was a Japanese citizen at their time of death, Japanese nationality can be acquired by contacting the Minister of Justice."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; dies before the birth and is a Japanese national at the time of death (limited to fathers until 1985)
# When the person is born on Japanese soil and both parents are unknown or [[statelessness|stateless]]

A system for acquiring [[nationality]] by birth after birth is also available. If an unmarried Japanese father and non-Japanese mother have a child, the parents later marry,  and the Japanese father acknowledges paternity, the child can acquire Japanese nationality, so long as the child has not reached the age of 20. Japanese nationality law effective from 1985 has been that if the parents are not married at the time of birth and the father has not acknowledged paternity while the child was still in the womb, the child will not acquire Japanese nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Japan's Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that denying nationality to children born out of wedlock to foreign mothers is unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=PDI20080604 /&gt;

Following this, the conservative [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] and others, claiming the possibility of false recognition of paternity, suggested mandatory DNA testing. This was rejected by the [[Democratic Party of Japan|Democratic Party]], and instead a bill was passed in 2009 allowing photographs of the father and child and scientific testing to be requested as evidence in cases of doubt.

==Naturalization==
Naturalization in Japan requires the applicant to give up their current [[citizenship]](s) either before or shortly after, depending on the nationality, the [[naturalization]] takes place if the loss of nationality does not occur automatically. Although there are rules in place, [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] does not strictly impose rules for the naturalization process, as the exact process for each specific nationality depends on the Japan's international relations and agreements with the given country. Basic naturalization requirements also differ from person to person regardless of their nationality and depending on the applicant's current status in Japan. Unlike most other countries, the applicant does not have to have been a [[Permanent residency|permanent resident]] to be eligible to apply for Japanese naturalization.&lt;ref name="ItoM"&gt;Ito, Masami, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20111227i1.html Many angles to acquiring Japanese citizenship]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 27 December 2011, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The outlined criteria for [[naturalization]] are provided in Article 5 of the Nationality Act:&lt;ref name="Nationality_Law"&gt;[http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/information/tnl-01.html Japan's Ministry of Justice: The Nationality Law] (in English)&lt;/ref&gt;

# Continuous residence in Japan for 5 years&lt;!-- Article talks about permanent residence, not naturalisation.   --&gt;
# At least 20 years old and otherwise legally competent
# History of good behavior generally, and no past history of seditious behavior
# Sufficient capital or skills, either personally or within family, to support oneself in Japan
# Stateless or willing to renounce foreign citizenship and swear allegiance to Japan

The [[Minister of Justice (Japan)|Minister of Justice]] may waive the age and residence requirements if the applicant has a special relationship to Japan (for example, a Japanese parent).

The Nationality Act also provides that the [[Diet of Japan]] may confer Japanese nationality by special resolution to a person who has provided extraordinary service to Japan. However, this provision has never been invoked.

Those that naturalize must choose a legal name, like other Japanese, that consists of all or any mix of Japanese [[hiragana]], [[katakana]], and approved [[kanji]]. Sometimes applicants were given advice on Japanese names, but choosing a Japanese sounding/appearing name was never a requirement; there are examples through history of naturalized Japanese choosing legal names that did not appear ethnically Japanese. However, in 1983, the Ministry of Justice revised its manuals and application guides and examples to make it clear that using names of non-Japanese origin can be acceptable, by making the "before" and "after" [[hanja]]/[[kanji]] name of fictitious example ethnically Korean applicants the same in order to emphasize that applicants who come from Chinese character name cultures can keep their names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sangiin.go.jp/japanese/joho1/kousei/syuisyo/147/touh/t147040.htm Answer to Councilor TAKEMURA Yasuko re CERD]&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known example of someone who did not adopt a Japanese name is [[Masayoshi Son]], the wealthiest man in Japan as of 2007, who naturalized using his [[Korean family name]] rather than the Japanese family name he used during his youth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-595948.html?refid=gg_x_02 Masayoshi Son was among the first to flout Japan's business establishment] [[The Washington Post]], May 9, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The application has to be made in person to the [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]] branch office with responsibility for the city where the applicant lives. A booklet will be given to the applicant at the first visit which explains every needed document and processes explained in Japanese.

The naturalization process has three stages.

* First stage: Initial application in person and gathering needed documents; preparing and filling out all necessary forms in [[Japanese language]] with [[handwriting]]; and submitting all prepared documents to the Ministry of Justice in person. An application number is provided to the applicant for future correspondence with the case.
* Second stage: The Ministry of Justice checks the submitted documents. Oral and written interview are scheduled a month or two after submitting the documents.
* Third stage: Finalization. The Ministry of Justice sends all documents to [[Tokyo]] and the applicant is requested to inform any changes of address, telephone, work, [[marital status]], etc. while application is being reviewed.

The booklet given at the beginning of the process lists every document that the applicant needs from their home country and their country's [[Diplomatic mission|embassy]] in Japan. The applicant needs to be able to speak and express himself/herself in Japanese and be able to answer the interview questions in Japanese. The interviewer will ask questions about the form applicant filled and about why applicant wants to acquire Japanese citizenship. At the end, there may be a written test at an [[Primary education|elementary school]] [[second grade]] level.

After the documents are sent to Tokyo for processing at the Ministry of Justice headquarters, it can take from 8 to 10 months (or longer depending on the applicant) from the first application. The applicant will be called by their interviewer about the decision once the interviewer gets the results from Tokyo.

==Loss of citizenship==

[[Loss of citizenship]] requires the approval of the Minister of Justice.

A Japanese national is assumed to have [[Renunciation of citizenship|renounced]] their nationality upon [[naturalization]] in any foreign country.&lt;ref name="ItoM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article 11, [http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/information/tnl-01.html The Nationality Law], Ministry of Justice of Japan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the revisions made to the Nationality Law in 1985, Articles 14 and 15 require any person who holds [[multiple citizenship]] to make a "declaration of choice" between the ages of 20 and 22, in which they choose to renounce either their Japanese nationality or their foreign citizenship(s). Failure to do so entitles the Minister of Justice to demand a declaration of choice at any time. If the required declaration is not made within one month, their Japanese nationality is automatically revoked.  A renunciation of foreign citizenship made before Japanese officials may be considered by a foreign state as having no legal effect as is the case with, for example, United States citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese nationals who hold multiple citizenship by birth, and who do not wish to lose their Japanese citizenship, are required to declare their desire to retain Japanese citizenship by the age of 21. Part of fulfilling this requirement is to "make an effort" to renounce other citizenships once they have declared their intent to retain Japanese nationality. This may be difficult for some Japanese with foreign nationality, for example,  [[Iran]]ian nationals cannot renounce their [[Iranian nationality law|Iranian nationality]] until age 25.&lt;ref name=IranCC&gt;{{Citation
|url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rsd/rsddocview.htm?tbl=RSDLEGAL&amp;id=3ae6b5a68
|title=Civil Code of Iran (last amended 1985)
|publisher=UNHCR
|year=2008
|accessdate=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Japanese national does not lose his or her nationality in situations where citizenship is acquired involuntarily such as when a Japanese woman marries an Iranian national. In this case she automatically acquires Iranian citizenship&lt;ref name=IranCC /&gt; and is permitted to be an Iranian-Japanese dual national, since the acquisition of the Iranian citizenship was involuntary.

Though it is unknown whether it has ever happened, citizenship can also be lost if a person becomes a civil servant of a foreign government, should their role be felt to contradict what it means to be a citizen of Japan.

In November 2008, Liberal Democratic Party member [[Tarō Kōno]] submitted a proposal to allow offspring of mixed-nationality couples in which one parent is Japanese to have more than one nationality. The proposal also calls for foreigners to be allowed to obtain Japanese nationality without losing their original citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== Dual nationality ==

It is generally difficult to have [[dual citizenship]] of Japan and another country, due to the provisions for loss of Japanese nationality when a Japanese national naturalizes in another country (see "Loss of citizenship" above), and the requirement to renounce one's existing citizenships when naturalizing in Japan (see "Naturalization" above).

There are still some ways in which a person may have [[dual citizenship]] of Japan and another country, including:

* They had [[dual citizenship]] prior to January 1, 1985, when the Nationality Law was enacted
* They acquire multiple citizenships at birth, such as being born to a non-Japanese citizen parent and acquiring that parent's citizenship as a result of that country's laws or by being born in a ''[[jus soli]]'' country. However, they must choose one citizenship/nationality before the age of 22 or within two years if the second citizenship is acquired after the age of 20, or they may lose their Japanese nationality (see "Loss of citizenship" above),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Travel freedom==
{{main|Visa requirements for Japanese citizens}}
[[File:Visa requirements for Japanese citizens.png|thumbnail|400px|right|Visa requirements for Japanese citizens]]
In 2018, Japanese citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 180 countries and territories, ranking the [[Japanese passport]] 1st in the world according to the [[Visa Restrictions Index]].

In 2017, the Japanese nationality is ranked twenty-ninth in the [[The Quality of Nationality Index|Nationality Index]] (QNI). This index differs from the [[Visa (document)#Visa restrictions|Visa Restrictions Index]], which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition to travel freedom, on internal factors such as peace &amp; stability, economic strength, and human development as well. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.businessinsider.de/nationalities-with-the-best-quality-of-life-2016-6?r=UK&amp;IR=T |title= The 41 nationalities with the best quality of life |date= 2016-02-06 |website=  www.businessinsider.de |access-date= 2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kotohira Jinsha v. McGrath, Attorney General''',. (90 F. Supp. 892) was a [[United States District Court for the District of Hawaii|District court]] case allowing [[Shinto]] Shrines to reopen following [[World War II]].

==Background==
[http://www.e-shrine.org/images/JUNE2015.pdf Kotohira Jinsha Shrine] was established in 1920.

December 7, 1941 the [[Empire of Japan]] [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] thereafter practice of Shinto was banned by marshal law, throughout the war clergy are deported to Japan or transferred to the U.S. mainland.

October 24, 1944 martial law was lifted in Hawaii.

September 2, 1945 Japan surrenders and World War II is over.

December 15, 1945 [[Shinto Directive]] abolishes [[State Shinto]], Japan’s [[state religion]].

April 6, 1946 without a clergy, the remaining ministry closes Kotohira Jinsha

==Case==
December 31, 1947 with declining tensions towards Japanese tradition, Shintos reopen Kotohira Jinsha despite the absence of a [[clergy]].

June 1, 1948 federal officers raided the shrine under the [[Trading with the Enemy Act 1917|Trading with the Enemy Act]] the seize the Kotohira Jinsha property and making arrests.

March 4, 1949 the [[Federal government of the United States|Federal Government]] announces the sale of the seized Kotohira Jinsha property.

April 4, 1949 Kotohira Jinsha reacted by hiring law firm, Robertson, Castle &amp; Anthony.

March 31, 1949 Kotohira Jinsha files lawsuit against the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General’s office]] (held by [[J. Howard McGrath]]) for misusing Section 9 of the Trading with the Enemy Act against a civilian organization and not under the influence of the Japanese government.

March 27, 1950 The trial started and ended on May 17, 1950.

May 18, 1950 Judge McLaughlin ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, Kotohira Jinsha.

===Judge=== 
[[Joseph Frank McLaughlin|Joseph F. McLaughlin]]

===Plaintiffs===
Robertson, Castle &amp; Anthony
*[[Joseph Garner Anthony|Joseph G. Anthony]]
*[[Frank D. Padgett]]

===Defendants===
Attorney General’s office
*[[Ray J. O'Brien]]
*[[Leon R. Gross]]
*[[Howard K. Hoddick]]

==Conclusion==
Judge McLaughlin found the Attorney General’s office in violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights of plaintiffs in the [[United States Constitution]] with reference to [[Robert H. Jackson]] in [[American Communications Association v. Douds]].

Judge J. Frank McLaughlin found the Attorney General’s office had no basis on which to exercise the Trading with the Enemy Act, moreover since 1945 Japan had abolished state religion under [[Douglas MacArthur]] and by [[judicial order]] return seized property to Kotohira Jinsha.

==Results==
Kotohira Jinsha Shrine reopened almost immediately after the case that year.
After relocating a second time in 1962 to make way for the [[Interstate H-1|H1 Freeway]] (the first time in 1931) to its current location.

The successful case demonstrated the possibility for other Japanese-based organizations perceived as being wronged by the United States to go to court.

In 2010 the [[Ground Zero mosque controversy]] over [[Park51]] near the [[World Trade Center site]], in comparison between the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] and [[September 11 attacks]], renewed interest Kotohira in ''Jinsha v. McGrath'' arose as a counterpart for Park51.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9040">{{Taxation}}
A '''landfill tax''' or '''levy''' is a form of [[tax]] that is applied in some countries to increase the cost of [[landfill]]. The tax is typically levied in units of currency per unit of weight or volume (£/t, €/t, $/yard³). The tax is in addition to the overall cost of landfill and forms a proportion of the [[gate fee]].

==Reasons for landfill tax==
A tax or fee may be imposed on landfills or other disposal facilities as a means of raising general revenues, to generate funds for inspection programs or long-term mitigation of environmental impacts related to disposal, or as a means of inhibiting disposal by raising the cost in comparison to preferable alternatives, in the same manner as an [[excise tax|excise]] or "[[sin tax]]".

Landfilling is discouraged due to a number of key reasons:

*[[Climate change]] caused by [[landfill gas]] from [[biodegradable waste]]
*Loss of resources
**Constraints on areas suitable for landfill sites
**Loss of recyclable components of waste landfilled
* [[Nimby]] objections causing political problems

==Landfill tax by country==
&lt;!--

Is it at a state rather than federal level?

see also Environmental Protection Regulations 1987 
===Australia===

 --&gt;

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]] the [[Waste Minimisation Act 2008]] allowed for the charging of a landfill levy. Half of the landfill levy goes to local authorities with the other half going into a Waste Minimisation Fund. As of 2010 it is set at $10 a tonne but it can be reviewed by the Minister for the Environment.&lt;ref name="mfe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/waste/waste-disposal-levy/faq.html|title=Waste Disposal Levy FAQs|date=22 September 2009|publisher=Ministry for the Environment|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Landfill Tax was introduced in 1996 by Conservative Secretary of State for the Environment, [[John Gummer]], and was the UK's first environmental tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN00237/SN00237.pdf|title=Landfill tax : introduction &amp; early history|website=parliament.uk|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Landfill Tax Regulations 1996|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1527/introduction/made|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tax is seen as a key mechanism in enabling the UK to meet its targets set out in the [[Landfill Directive]] for the landfilling of biodegradable waste. Through increasing the cost of landfill, other [[list of solid waste treatment technologies|advanced waste treatment technologies]] with higher gate fees are made to become more financially attractive.

The amount of tax levied is calculated according to the weight of the material disposed of and whether it is active or inactive waste.

*Inactive waste covers most materials used in a building's fabric as well as earth excavated for foundations. Most forms of concrete, brick, glass, soil, clay and gravel are classified as inactive.
*Active waste covers all other forms of waste such as wood, ductwork, piping and plastics.

Inevitably there will be some mixing of waste such as inert bricks and concrete mixed with small amounts of wood or mineral dust packaged in polythene bags. It is for the producer of the waste to decide what is reasonable and acceptable in terms of active waste contamination of inert waste.

The landfill site operator is responsible for paying the tax and will pass the cost on to businesses and local councils on top of normal landfill fees. VAT is charged on the landfill fees and the landfill tax.

Operators can reduce their tax liability by making payments to the Landfill Communities Fund under the [[Landfill Tax Credit Scheme]]. The fund aids community or environmental projects in the vicinity of a landfill site and is regulated by ENTRUST, a company limited by guarantee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.entrust.org.uk/landfill-community-fund|title=Landfill Communities Fund|website=www.entrust.org.uk|publisher=ENTRUST|access-date=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Landfill tax rates 2013–2014'''

*Standard rate for active waste: £80 per tonne&lt;ref&gt;[[Finance Act 2012]], section 205.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lower rate for inactive waste: £2.50 per tonne

Sections from the coalition government's Emergency Budget 2010:
*2.128 The standard rate of landfill tax will increase by £8 per tonne each year from 1 April 2011 until at least 2014. There will be a floor under the standard rate at £80 per tonne, so that the rate will not fall below £80 per tonne from April 2014 until at least 2020.
*2.129 New qualifying criteria for lower rated wastes will be legislated in the Finance Bill introduced in the autumn (2010), to come into effect on 1 April 2011.

'''Landfill tax rates 2015–16'''

From 1 April 2015 to April 2016 the landfill tax rates were:
* Standard rate for active waste: £82.60 per tonne&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EfW, landfill, RDF - letsrecycle.com|url = http://www.letsrecycle.com/prices/efw-landfill-rdf-2/|website = letsrecycle.com|access-date = 2016-01-31|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lower rate for inactive waste: £2.60 per tonne

With the [[Scotland Act 2012]], the [[Scottish Government]] gained the devolved power to levy its own landfill tax. The [[Scottish Landfill Tax]] was introduced by the [[Landfill Tax (Scotland) Act 2014]] and began to be payable on 1 April 2015.&lt;ref name="ZeroWaste"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zerowastescotland.org.uk/content/landfill-tax-scotland-0|title=A landfill tax for Scotland|website=zerowastescotland.org.uk|publisher=Zero Waste Scotland|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LegislationSCO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2014/2/|title=Landfill Tax (Scotland) Act 2014|website=Legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RevenueScotland"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revenue.scot/scottish-landfill-tax|title=Scottish Landfill Tax|website=Revenue Scotland|publisher=The Scottish Government|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 and 2016, there were concerns that some companies disposing waste to landfill were wrongly putting waste with a biodegradable and non-inert content into landfills at the inactive waste taxation level. A new testing regime was introduced, where a small amount of the load is tested to ascertain its biodegradable content.

'''Landfill tax rates 2018-19'''

From 1 April 2018 to April 2019 the landfill tax rates are:
* Standard rate for active waste: £88.95 per tonne
* Lower rate for inactive waste: £2.80 per tonne

The [[Welsh Government]] will take responsibility for the tax in Wales from April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.entrust.org.uk/landfill-community-fund/wales/|title=The LCF in Wales|website=ENTRUST|access-date=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
The United States has numerous federal laws and regulations regarding the operation of landfills,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} but there is no national landfill tax or fee.  Many{{Which|date=October 2009}} states and local governments collect fees and taxes on the collection or disposal of solid waste.

==== California ====
Landfills in California are subject to fees and taxes levied by cities and counties, as well as by the state.  The Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 authorized a state fee (set at $1.40 per ton effective 2002-07-01) to fund the activities of the [[California Integrated Waste Management Board]] (CIWMB).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/agendas/mtgdocs/2001/06/00005641.doc California Integrated Waste Management Board, June 19–21, 2001, Agenda Item 28] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;  Many cities and counties collect fees from landfills within their jurisdiction to recover the costs of local solid waste planning and inspection programs, to operate programs for the collection and disposal of household [[hazardous wastes]], and to fund some costs of recycling and reuse programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=prc&amp;group=41001-42000&amp;file=41900-41904 California Public Resources Code, Section 41900 et seq.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Landfills in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] are subject to the highest disposal tax in California, with the Disposal Facility Tax set at $13.00 per ton in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.municode.com/Resources/gateway.asp?pid=14367&amp;sid=5 San Jose Municipal Code, Chapter 4.78]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4688">A '''Notice of Intent to Deny''' ('''NOID''') is a notice issued by the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] to petitioners for residency, citizenship, family visas, and employment visas. Examples of petitions for which a NOID may be issued are [[Form I-129]] (alien worker authorization), [[Form I-140]] (immigrant worker authorization), and [[Form I-130]] (family visas).&lt;ref name=2005-memo/&gt;&lt;ref name=2013-memo/&gt;

== Situations where it is used ==

The NOID is used for situations where the adjudicator (the person evaluating the petition) believes that the petition should be denied, but that the petitioner may have additional evidence that might lead the petition to be approved.&lt;ref name=2013-memo&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/2013/June%202013/Requests%20for%20Evidence%20%28Final%29.pdf|title = Policy Memorandum|date = June 3, 2013|accessdate = January 16, 2016|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2005-memo&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/Static_Files_Memoranda/Archives%201998-2008/2005/rfe021605.pdf|title = Interoffice Memorandum|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|date = February 16, 2005|accessdate = January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main use is to save the petitioner and the USCIS time and effort involved in dealing with denials (through re-petitioning or appeal).

== Response protocol ==

The NOID is sent to, and the response must be sent by, the petitioner (or the attorney representing the petitioner, in cases where the petition is filed through an attorney) rather than the beneficiary.

The NOID is accompanied by stated reasons for issuing the NOID (which, if not addressed, will be the reasons for denial) and a time within which the petitioner must respond. If the petitioner submits no response, the petition is denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adjudicator's Field Manual, Sec. 10.5 Requesting Additional Information|url=https://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/AFM/HTML/AFM/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-1067/0-0-0-1318.html|website=USCIS|publisher=United States Citizenship &amp; Immigration Services|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the petitioner responds, the additional evidence is considered prior to a final decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adjudicator's Field Manual, Sec. 10.3 General Adjudication Procedures|url=https://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/AFM/HTML/AFM/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-1067/0-0-0-1166.html|website=USCIS|publisher=United States Citizenship &amp; Immigration Services|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differences with RFE ===

The following are some key differences between the [[Request For Evidence]] (RFE) and NOID:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Policy Memorandum: Requests for Evidence  and Notices of Intent to Deny|url=https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/2013/June%202013/Requests%20for%20Evidence%20%28Final%29.pdf|website=USCIS|publisher=United States Citizenship &amp; Immigration Services|accessdate=20 March 2018|date=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Likelihood of denial'': The RFE is issued when there is significant uncertainty about whether the petition will be approved, whereas the NOID is generally used when a denial is quite likely.
* ''Accompanying information'': A RFE comes with a list of additional types of evidence needed. A NOID comes equipped with a list of reasons for denial. While the two lists are somewhat related (insofar as a reason for denial translates to a piece of evidence that could overturn the denial) they have different framings.
* ''Time given to respond'': The time given to respond to a RFE is generally greater than that for a NOID.

=== Differences with Notice of Intent to Revoke ===

Another communication similar to NOID is the [[Notice of Intent to Revoke]], used in cases where the USCIS has received additional evidence after approving a petition and is reconsidering it for revocation. This is often prompted by a consular officer returning the petition to the USCIS. Consular officers return petitions to the USCIS if, in the course of deciding a visa application by the beneficiary based on the petition, they come across reason to believe that the petition was based on fraud or misrepresentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/unassigned/immigrant-visa-petitions-returned-state-department-consular-offices|title = Immigrant Visa Petitions Returned by the State Department Consular Offices|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The confusion occurs here because media technologist and the FCC know that IPTV or Internet Protocol TV and OTT are one and the same technology. Both are interchangeable names for streaming media over ther internet. The IPTV name came out first (where the FCC refers to internet Protocol when mentioning OVD but industry uses the name OTT (probably because there really is not any set Protocol)

'''Over the top''' ('''OTT''') is a term used to refer to [[content provider]]s that distribute [[streaming media]] as a standalone product directly to viewers over the [[Internet]], bypassing [[competitive local exchange carrier|telecommunications]], [[multichannel television]], and [[broadcast television]] platforms that traditionally act as a controller or distributor of such content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/can-cbs-change-streaming-game-star-trek-discovery-1037576|title=Can CBS Change the Streaming Game With 'Star Trek: Discovery'?|first=Natalie|last=Jarvey|date=15 September 2017|publisher=The Holywood Reporter|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term is most synonymous with subscription-based [[video on demand]] services that offer access to film and television content (including existing series acquired from other producers, as well as original content produced specifically for the service), including but not limited to [[Amazon Video]], [[fuboTV]], [[Hulu]], [[Netflix]], [[Now TV (Sky plc)|Now TV]], and [[Sky Go]] as well as a wave of "skinny" television services that offer access to live streams of linear [[Specialty channel|specialty channels]] similar to a traditional satellite or wireline television provider, but streamed over the public Internet, rather than a [[Closed platform|closed]], private network with proprietary equipment such as [[set-top box]]es.

Over the top services are typically accessed via websites on [[personal computer]]s, as well as via [[mobile app|apps]] on [[mobile device]]s (such as [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer|tablets]]), [[digital media player]]s (including [[video game console]]s), or televisions with integrated [[smart TV]] platforms.

==Definitions==
In 2011, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) stated that it "considers that Internet access to programming independent of a facility or network dedicated to its delivery (via, for example, cable or satellite) is the defining feature of what have been termed 'over-the-top' services".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/publications/reports/rp1110.htm#ftn2|title=Results of the fact-finding exercise on the over-the-top programming services|first=Government of Canada, Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|last=(CRTC)|website=www.crtc.gc.ca|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to video on demand video-delivery systems offered by cable and [[IPTV]], which are tightly managed networks where channels can be changed instantly, some OTT services such as iTunes require that the video be downloaded first and then played,&lt;ref name=tnroVSE&gt;{{cite Book| author = Gibbon, David C., and Liu, Zhu | date =  | title = Introduction to Video Search Engines | location = Washington, DC | publisher = Federal Communications Commission (FCC) | page = 251 | url =  | access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while other OTT players such as Apple TV, Amazon Unbox or Netflix offer movie downloads that start playing before the download completes (streaming).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disruptionmatters.com/2008/10/13/will-internet-tv-kill-iptv/|title=Will Internet TV Kill IPTV?|first=Jose Miguel|last=Cansado|date=13 October 2008|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[FCC]] categorizes the OTT services into two groups: [[multichannel video programming distributors]] (MVPDs); and [[online video distributor|online video distributors]] (OVDs).&lt;ref name=FCC17th2016&gt;{{cite report | author = FCC | date = May 6, 2016 | title = Annual Assessment of the Status of Competition in the Market for the Delivery of Video Programming [Seventeenth Report; MB Docket No. 15-158; DA 16-510] | location = Washington, DC | publisher = Federal Communications Commission (FCC) | pages = 4417–4587 | url = https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-16-510A1_Rcd.pdf | access-date= December 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/fcc-officially-launches-ovd-definition-nprm/136544|title=FCC Officially Launches OVD Definition NPRM|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual MVPDs include such varied services as [[DirecTV Now]], [[fuboTV]], [[Sling TV]], [[Hulu]] with Live TV, [[PlayStation Vue]], and [[YouTube TV]].

An OVD was defined by the FCC as:{{quote|any entity that provides video programming by means of the Internet or other Internet Protocol (IP)-based transmission path where the transmission path is provided by a person other than the OVD. An OVD does not include an MVPD inside its MVPD footprint or an MVPD to the extent it is offering online video programming as a component of an MVPD subscription to customers whose homes are inside its MVPD footprint.&lt;ref name=FCC17th2016&gt;{{cite report | author = FCC | date = May 6, 2016 | title = Annual Assessment of the Status of Competition in the Market for the Delivery of Video Programming [Seventeenth Report; MB Docket No. 15-158; DA 16-510] | location = Washington, DC | publisher = Federal Communications Commission (FCC) | pages = 4417–4587 | url = https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-16-510A1_Rcd.pdf | access-date= December 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Background==
In [[broadcasting]], ''over-the-top content'' (''OTT'') is the audio, video, and other media content delivered over the [[Internet]] without the involvement of a [[multiple-system operator]] (MSO) in the control or distribution of the content. The Internet provider may be aware of the contents of the [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) packets but is not responsible for, nor able to control, the viewing abilities, copyrights, and/or other redistribution of the content. This model contrasts with the purchasing or rental of video or audio content from an [[Internet service provider]] (ISP), such as [[pay television]],{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} [[video on demand]],{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} and from internet protocol television (IPTV).{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;IPTV is the delivery of television content using signals based on the logical Internet protocol (IP), rather than through traditional terrestrial, satellite signal, and cable television formats.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; OTT refers to content from a third party that is delivered to an end-user, with the ISP simply transporting IP packets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/03/jeff-bewkes-goes-over-the-top/|title=Time Warner Goes Over the Top|last=Hansell|first=Saul|work=The New York Times|date= March 3, 2009|accessdate=March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecnmag.com/News/2009/11/Over-the-Top-Video-and-Content-Delivery-Networks-Will-Transform-Video-On-Demand-Provisioning/|title=Over-the-Top Video and Content Delivery Networks Will Transform Video-On-Demand Provisioning|work=Electronic Component News|date=November 19, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305082324/http://www.ecnmag.com/News/2009/11/Over-the-Top-Video-and-Content-Delivery-Networks-Will-Transform-Video-On-Demand-Provisioning/|archivedate=March 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-will-it-take-to-make-over-the-top-video-successful-2010-12|title=Why 2011 Is Being Called The Year Of "The Cable Cut"|work=Business Insider|date=December 30, 2010|accessdate=March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-playing-the-ott-game-and-how-to-win-it-2010-12|title=Who Is Playing The OTT Game And How To Win It|work=Business Insider|date=December 30, 2010|accessdate=March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of content==
{{expand section | a thorough, sourced description of the types of OTT content current transmitted | small = no|date=December 2016}}
'''OTT television''', usually called [[Internet television|internet television or streaming television]], remains the most popular OTT content. This signal is received over the internet or through a cell phone network, as opposed to receiving the television signal from a terrestrial broadcast or satellite. Access is controlled by the video distributor, through either an app or a separate OTT dongle or box, connected to a phone, PC or television set. By mid-2017, 58 per cent of US households would access one in a given month and advertising revenues from OTT channels exceeded those from web browser plug-ins.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Orlowski; [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/08/08/desktop_vs_ott_video/ Can the last person watching desktop video please turn out the light?], The Register, 8 Aug 2017 (retrieved 8 Aug 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OTT messaging''' is defined as [[instant messaging]] services or [[online chat]] provided by third parties, as an alternative to [[text messaging]] services provided by a [[mobile network operator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-mobile-messaging-2013-5|title=Chart of the Day: Mobile Messaging|work=Business Insider|date=May 17, 2013|accessdate=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobilemarketingmagazine.com/over-the-top-messaging-overtakes-sms|title=Over-The-Top Messaging Apps Overtake SMS Messaging|last=Maytom|first=Tim|work=Mobile Marketing Magazine|date=August 4, 2014|accessdate=August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the [[Facebook]]-owned mobile application [[WhatsApp]], that serves to replace text messaging on Internet connected smartphones.&lt;ref name="wsj20140220"&gt;{{cite web|title=Facebook's $18 Billion Deal Sets High Bar|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=February 20, 2014|last=Albergotti|first=Reed|last2=MacMillan|first2=Douglas|last3=Rusli|first3=Evelyn|accessdate=March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parmy Olsen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/09/04/whatsapp-900-million-users/|title=WhatsApp hits 900 million users |last=Rao |first=Leena|work=Fortune|date=September 4, 2015|accessdate=January 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other providers of OTT messaging include [[Viber]], [[WeChat]], [[Skype]], and [[Google Allo]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/654-best-messaging-apps.html|title=Apps Roundup: Best Messaging Apps|work=Tom's Guide|date=Oct 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OTT voice calling''', usually called [[VOIP]], capabilities, for instance, as provided by [[Skype]], [[WeChat]], [[Viber]], and [[WhatsApp]] use open internet communication protocols to replace and sometimes enhance existing operator controlled services offered by mobile phone operators.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Modes of access==
Consumers can access OTT content through [[Internet access|Internet-connected]] devices such as [[smartphones|phones]] (including [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], and [[Windows phones|Windows]]-type mobile devices),{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} [[smart TV]]s (such as [[Google TV]] and [[LG Electronics]]' Channel Plus),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Roettgers, Janko | date=January 8, 2016 | title=LG's New TVs Mix Streaming Channels from Buzzfeed, GQ &amp; Vogue with Traditional Networks | url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/lgs-webos-internet-tv-channels-1201675137/ | journal = Variety | access-date=December 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=December 2016}} [[set-top box]]es (such as [[Apple TV]], [[Amazon Fire TV|Fire TV]] and [[Roku]]),{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} [[gaming consoles]] (such as the [[PlayStation 4]], [[Wii U]], and [[Xbox One]]),{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} and desktop and laptop computers and [[Tablet computer|tablets]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

A '''Personal Insolvency Arrangement''' (PIA) is  [[Ireland]]'s [[debt management]] solution for individuals who want to avoid outright [[bankruptcy]] and declare [[insolvency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal Insolvency Arrangements|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/personal_insolvency_arrangements.html|publisher=Government of Ireland|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement is one of the three alternatives authorized under Ireland's Personal Insolvency Act 2012; Debt Settlement Arrangements (DSA) and Debt Relief Notices (DRN) make the other two arrangements. PIA mandates a legal agreement between a [[debtor]] and their [[creditors]], which is mediated and administered by a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP). A PIA usually lasts for a term of six years and must include both [[unsecured debt]] and secured [[debts]].

== Eligibility ==
Eligibility criteria for a [[debtor]] include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eligibility criteria for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement.|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/act/pub/0044/sec0091.html|publisher=Irish Statue Book, Office of AG, Government of Ireland|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The debtor is [[insolvent]], that is they cannot pay debts in full when they are due.
* The debtor owes a debt to at least one [[secured creditor]] holding security over [[Ireland|Irish]] property or assets.
* The debtor has secured debts less than €3 million (unless [[creditors]] agree to upper limit)
* The debtor has co-operated with their secured creditor under a [[mortgage]] arrears process for 6 months.
* The debtor must live in the [[Republic of Ireland]], or ordinarily resided or had a place of business within [[Ireland]].
* The debtor provides a Prescribed Financial Statement and a PIP has examined the debtors financial situation and confirms eligibility.
Furthermore, a debtor must not have any agreements mandated under the instant Act, bankrupt nor accumulated 25% or more of their total debt during the previous 6 months

Personal Insolvency Act 2012 envisages that Personal Insolvency Arrangements can only be applied for through an approved third party termed as Personal Insolvency Practitioners. The practitioners are required to be authorised by the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) and include Solicitors [[Barristers]], Qualified [[accountants]], qualified financial [[Financial adviser|advisers]] etc. Till  31 October 2013, it was announced that there are a total of 72 registered Personal Insolvency Practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Register of Personal Insolvency Practitioners|url=http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/PIPs|publisher=Insolvency Service of Ireland|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The type of [[debts]] that can be included in a PIA are split into three types; Included, Excludable and Excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hundreds of new debt arrangements ‘in the pipeline’, Insolvency Service of Ireland says|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/hundreds-of-new-debt-arrangements-in-the-pipeline-insolvency-service-of-ireland-says-1.1569819|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debtor insolvency declaration ===
Initially, the [[debtor]] is required to approach a PIP to provide a full disclosure of his or her financial situation. After appraisal, the PIP suggests best possible agreement. If recommended, the debtor can proceed with the PIA application and appoint the PIP to act on their behalf. A Prescribed Financial Statement is then prepared for the debtor.  which details key information about a debtor’s [[finances]] and clearly shows their [[insolvent]] status.  It must be fully supported by appropriate financial documentation, such as pay slips, bank statements etc. A [[statutory declaration]] in the presence of witnesses to confirm the Prescribed Financial Statement is true and accurate, plus completes and signs the additional documents needed to accompany the Statement to apply for a Protective Certificate. The full application is sent to the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI).

=== Issuance of Protective Certificate ===
A court is authorized to issue a Protective Certificate to the [[debtor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Protective Certificate?|url=http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/PIA_and_PC|publisher=ISI Official Website|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides  [http://www.simplefs.co.uk/personal-insolvency-arrangements.asp PIP] and the debtor 70 days protection against creditor for preparation of a PIA proposal.

=== Preparation of PIA proposal ===
After issuance of  Protective Certificate, PIP has been mandated to prepare a draft PIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insolvency Process|url=http://www.personal-insolvency-arrangement.ie/|publisher=Personal-Insolvency-Arrangement.ie|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the process, the market value of the secured assets can either be agreed between the debtor, creditor and PIP or services of independent valuer can be solicited.

=== Creditors' meeting and approval of PIA ===
Sequel to debtor’s agreement on the PIA proposal, the PIP is required to call a [[creditor]]s' meeting in which through voting, creditors representing at least 65% of the total [[debts]] – 50% of the unsecured and 50% of the secured – must agree to the proposal. After approval in the vote, the documents are required to be forwarded to ISI, which will notify the [[Circuit Court]]. Thus final approval sits with the court, and any [[creditor]]'s objection will be considered by them.
The law requires that after approval the debtor’s name, address details, birth year and PIA start date o be made available on the [[Insolvency Service of Ireland|ISI website]].

=== Execution of PIA ===
After formal approval by the courts and notification with ISI, [[debtors]] are required to set up payments to the PIP, which in turn distribute the payments to creditors as per agreements. A PIA has a lifespan of six years.

==== Completion ====
If a debtor completes all of their obligations under the PIA, the agreement is considered complete. At completion, PIP through [[creditors]] finalize the treatment of the remaining balances debt; unsecured debt balances will be written off, while secured debt balances are discharged as per the PIA agreement. The PIP coordinates the removal of debtor’s information from the Register of Personal Insolvency Arrangements within three months, making the debtor solvent.

==== Failure ====
A PIA will be deemed to have failed if [[creditors]] do not agree to the PIA or if the debtor fails to maintain his or her duties and obligations.
This can be avoided if a debtor can anticipate a potential problem keeping up with payments, because their PIP may be able to arrange a variation with creditors to ensure a way can be found to continue with the PIA and prevent it from failing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What happens when a PIA fails?|url=http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/WP13000122|publisher=ISI website|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Philip Collins Ltd v Davis''''' [2000] 3 All ER 808 is an [[English unjust enrichment]] case, an example of a restitution claim and the [[change of position]] defence.{{who|date=December 2015}}

==Facts==
[[Phil Collins]] released ''[[Serious Hits… Live!]]'' with 15 tracks in 1990. [[Rahmlee Davis]] and [[Louis Satterfield]] contributed performances on five tracks and received album royalties via Collins' publishing company ''Philip Collins Ltd''. In 1997, Collins said they had been mistakenly overpaid by a factor of three. They had been paid as if they had performed on all fifteen tracks, but they had only performed on five. To reverse this alleged [[unjust enrichment]], Collins proposed to set off the overpaid [[royalties]] on future royalties. Davis and Satterfield argued back they were entitled to royalties without the pro rata reduction, and raised both [[estoppel]] and [[change of position]] defences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelso|first1=Paul|title=Collins sues tour horn players|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/mar/30/paulkelso|date=29 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==
Jonathan Parker J held Collins had overpaid Davis and Satterfield and he was entitled to set future royalties off against half of the sums overpaid. He said the overpayment was a mistake of fact, because Collins thought they had played in all 15 tracks. Collins was not estopped from maintaining there was overpayment of royalties because there was never any assumption between the parties that Davis and Satterfield would get royalties for all 15 tracks and there was no acquiescence in the assumption. Overpayment was not acquiescence. There was no evidence Davis and Satterfield ever thought they were entitled. The overpayments did not amount to representations that they were (so no [[estoppel by representation]]). But the fact of overpayment did result in a general change of position on Davis and Satterfield’s part. It increased their level of outgoings. However, the defence of change of position was not an “all or nothing” doctrine and, in this case, it would be fair to allow the defence to cover one half of the overpayments (''[[Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd]]'' [1991] 2 AC 548 applied). Finally, if Collins had made a claim to recover the overpayments his claim would have been statute barred under the Limitation Act 1980, s.5 because it was six years. But here it was not a return of overpayments, only an equitable set off against future royalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Phil Collins Wins Royalties Lawsuit|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/821217/phil-collins-wins-royalties-lawsuit/|work=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is an excerpt about the change of position defence at work.

{{Cquote|''The Change Of Position Issue''

76 As Mr Howe correctly observed in the course of argument, “change of position” is what this case is really all about.

77 In ''Lipkin Gorman'' (above) the House of Lords recognised change of position as a defence to restitutionary claims. In the course of his speech in that case Lord Goff said this (at p. 580c–h):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“I am most anxious that, in recognising this defence to actions of restitution, nothing should be said at this stage to inhibit the development of the defence on a case by case basis, in the usual way. It is, of course, plain that the defence is not open to one who has changed his position in bad faith, as where the defendant has paid away the money with knowledge of the facts entitling the plaintiff to restitution; and it is commonly accepted that the defence should not be open to a wrongdoer. These are matters which can, in due course, be considered in depth in cases where they arise for consideration. They do not arise in the present case. Here there is no doubt that the respondents have acted in good faith throughout, and the action is not founded upon any wrongdoing of the respondents. It is not however appropriate in the present case to attempt to identify all those actions in restitution to which change of position may be a defence. A prominent example will, no doubt, be found in those cases where the plaintiff is seeking repayment of money paid under a mistake of fact; but I can see no reason why the defence should not also be available in principle in a case such as the present, where the plaintiff's money has been paid by a thief to an innocent donee, and the plaintiff then seeks repayment from the donee in an action for money had and received. At present I do not want to state the principle any less broadly than this: that the defence is available to a person whose position has so changed that it would be inequitable in all the circumstances to require him to make restitution, or alternatively to make restitution in full. I wish to stress however that the mere fact that the defendant has spent the money, in whole or in part, does not of itself render it inequitable that he should be called upon to repay, because the expenditure might in any event have been incurred by him in the ordinary course of things. I fear that the mistaken assumption that mere expenditure of money may be regarded as amounting to a change of position for present purposes has led in the past to opposition by some to recognition of a defence which in fact is likely to be available only on comparatively rare occasions.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Lord Goff]] went on to emphasise that the defence of change of position will avail a defendant only to the extent that his position has been changed (see Lipkin Gorman, above, p. 580h).

78 Earlier in his speech in Lipkin Gorman (at p. 578) Lord Goff said this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“The claim for money had and received is not, as I have previously mentioned, founded upon any wrong committed by the club against the solicitors. But it does not, in my opinion, follow that the court has carte blanche to reject the solicitors' claim simply because it thinks it unfair or unjust in the circumstances to grant recovery. The recovery of money in restitution is not, as a general rule, a matter of discretion for the court. A claim to recover money at common law is made as a matter of right; and even though the underlying principle of recovery is the principle of unjust enrichment, nevertheless, where recovery is denied, it is denied on the basis of legal principle.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Thus, if recovery of the overpayments is to be denied in the instant case, it must be denied not as a matter of discretion but of legal principle. What, then, are the relevant legal principles, in the context of the instant case?

79 For obvious reasons, it would not be appropriate for me to attempt to set out an exhaustive list of the legal principles applicable to the defence of change of position, but four principles in particular seem to me to be called into play in the instant case.

80 In the first place, the [[Legal burden of proof|evidential burden]] is on the defendant to make good the defence of change of position. However, in applying this principle it seems to me that the court should beware of applying too strict a standard. Depending on the circumstances, it may well be unrealistic to expect a defendant to produce conclusive evidence of change of position, given that when he changed his position he can have had no expectation that he might thereafter have to prove that he did so, and the reason why he did so, in a court of law (see the observations of Slade L.J. in Avon County Council v. Howlett (above) at pp. 621–2, and [[Goff &amp; Jones]] (above) at p. 827). In the second place, as Lord Goff stressed in the passage from his speech in ''Lipkin Gorman'' quoted above, to amount to a change of position there must be something more than mere expenditure of the money sought to be recovered, “because the expenditure might in any event have been incurred … in the ordinary course of things”. In the third place, there must be a causal link between the change of position and the overpayment. In ''[[South Tyneside Metropolitan B.C. v. Svenska International plc]]'' [1995] 1 All E.R. 545, Clarke J., following Hobhouse J. in ''[[Kleinwort Benson Ltd v. South Tyneside MBC]]'' [1994] 4 All E.R. 972, held that, as a general principle, the change of position must have occurred after receipt of the overpayment, although in Goff &amp; Jones (above) the correctness of this decision is doubted (see ibid. pp. 822–3). But whether or not a change of position may be anticipatory, it must (as I see it) have been made as a consequence of the receipt of, or (it may be) the prospect of receiving, the money sought to be recovered: in other words it must, on the evidence, be referable in some way to the payment of that money. In the fourth place, as Lord Goff also made clear in his speech in ''Lipkin Gorman'', in contrast to the defence of estoppel the defence of change of position is not an “all or nothing” defence: it is available only to the extent that the change of position renders recovery unjust.

81 With those basic principles in mind, I turn to the facts of the instant case.

82 At the outset, when considering the facts of the instant case, two matters are to be borne in mind. In the first place, the recovery which is sought relates only to the excess payments of royalty, since one third of the sums actually paid was payable in any event. In consequence, any relevant change of position by the defendants must be referable to the receipt of such excess payments (or, it may be, the prospect of receiving such excess payments). In the second place, the fact that the defendants are currently in financial difficulties is not in itself indicative of a relevant change of position on their part. Although that fact might have been relevant in considering whether to order repayment of the sums overpaid, the claimant is not seeking an order which requires the defendants to make any payment to the claimant: as I explained earlier, it seeks only to set off the overpayments against future royalties.

83 In their witness statements, which formed the basis of their oral evidence in chief, the defendants addressed the issue of change of position in unequivocal terms. Mr Davis said this in his witness statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Until the royalty payments were stopped, I had adjusted my day to day life according to the regular payments I had received over such a long period, and had become both accustomed to and dependent upon them. I had a few savings. However, with many different projects underway including a clothing business and my solo career, these were soon exhausted. I had relied on the royalties both for my living expenses and to enable me to carry on working. My elderly mother in Chicago and three dependants as well as my household in Los Angeles had all been supported with these payments. I could no longer financially assist them—indeed, I have had to borrow money from family and friends. Most of this remains unpaid … The unannounced withholding of funds has had a domino effect upon my life since most of my projects were predicated on the existence of these royalties.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mr Satterfield said this in his witness statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“I was heavily reliant upon these royalty payments. Over the period until they were stopped, I would estimate that on average they represented 80–90 per cent of my total income. I had, and have, no savings, and the money was used for the day to day living expenses of my family and myself. In particular, the payments were invaluable in assisting my wife with medical treatment … I sold my home in Chicago to assist with the care she required … The cutting of the royalty payments could not have come at a worse time. In addition, the stopping of the payments dramatically affected my ability to work. There was still a reasonable demand for me. However, the nature of my work involves a great deal of travel, hotels, etc. There were engagements offered to me which I had to decline because I had no money. The effect is a vicious circle…”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

84 Had those factual accounts been true and accurate, they would undoubtedly have provided a strong foundation for a complete defence on grounds of change of position; particularly so in the case of Mr Davis. No doubt the statements were drafted with that very consideration in mind. In the event, however, the passages in the defendants' witness statements dealing with the question of change of position turned out to be seriously exaggerated. I do not entirely blame the defendants for this. It may well be that they did not sufficiently appreciate the need for precision in the framing of their witness statements. But whatever the reason, the fact remains that the defendants' oral evidence, coupled with such documentary evidence as they were able to produce relating to their financial affairs (I referred earlier to the fact that documents were disclosed on a piecemeal basis during the course of the trial), not only failed to approach the degree of particularity reflected in their witness statements, but actually demonstrated that statements of fact made in the passages quoted above were not true.

85 Thus, Mr Davis expressly accepted in cross-examination that there was no such “domino effect” as is referred to in his witness statement. He also accepted that he was not “dependent on” the royalty income. He frankly admitted that there is not, nor has there ever been, any reason why he cannot earn his living as a musician. It was also clear from his evidence that to the extent that he had not taken other jobs as a musician while the royalties were coming in, that was his choice. He acknowledged that at no stage did he have any savings to speak of, and that his present financial difficulties were due to some bad business decisions on his part. He was unable to point to any particular decision having been taken, or act done, whether by him or on his behalf, as being directly referable to the fact that he was in receipt of royalties calculated on a non-prorated basis. Rather, the true position (as revealed in cross-examination) was that he geared his expenditure to the level of his cash resources from time to time: he was content to enjoy the benefits of the royalty payments as and when they came in, and his outgoings increased accordingly. He was (as I find) fully aware at all material times that royalty income from a particular release tends to reduce over time to nil or a negligible sum. Consequently, he realised that his royalty income from the Live Album would not be maintained at the level of the payments received during the first year or so after its release. On the other hand, that realisation did not lead him to limit his outgoings to any significant extent.

86 So far as Mr Satterfield is concerned, I intend no criticism whatever of him when I describe him as having a somewhat relaxed and philosophical attitude to life in general, and in particular to financial and administrative matters. Like Mr Davis, Mr Satterfield accepted that there is nothing to prevent him continuing to earn his living as a musician, but, as he put it disarmingly in cross-examination, he earns money when he feels like it. He accepted that the assertion in his witness statement that he cannot work because he cannot afford the up-front hotel and travel costs is an overstatement. Further, it was apparent from his evidence, and I find, that such assets as he and his wife acquired post-1990 (including a number of properties in Chicago which his wife purchased with a view to refurbishment and letting) were not acquired in reliance on a future royalty stream but were purchased ad hoc, as and when they considered that they could afford it. At the conclusion of his cross-examination Mr Satterfield described his current financial position as follows (according to my note):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“I have no money left from my earnings. My lifestyle is hard to explain; you would not believe it. When I got the money in I spent it rather than saved it. A lot of the things I spent it on I am involved in now. I spent it for other people. I have done this throughout my career.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In general, whilst it would plainly not be accurate to describe the defendants as having been careful with their money, I am satisfied that in gauging how much they could spend from time to time they had regard to their current cash resources, the principal source of which (at least in the first two years after the release of the Live Album) was their royalty income.

87 On the basis of the defendants' oral evidence, coupled with such documentary evidence as they were able to produce, I am unable to find that any particular item of expenditure was directly referable to the overpayments of royalties. Their evidence was simply too vague and unspecific to justify such a finding. On the other hand, in the particular circumstances of the instant case the absence of such a finding is not, in my judgment, fatal to the defence of the change of position. Given that the approach of the defendants to their respective financial affairs was, essentially, to gear their outgoings to their income from time to time (usually, it would seem, spending somewhat more than they received), and bearing in mind that the instant case involves not a single overpayment but a series of overpayments at periodic intervals over some six years, it is in my judgment open to the court to find, and I do find, that the overpayments caused a general change of position by the defendants in that they increased their level of outgoing by reference to the sums so paid. In particular, the fact that in the instant case the overpayments took the form of a series of periodical payments over an extended period seems to me to be significant in the context of a defence of change of position, in that it places the defendants in a stronger position to establish a general change of position such as I have described, consequent upon such overpayments.

88 Nor, on the evidence, can the defendants' increased level of expenditure be regarded as consisting exclusively of expenditure which (to use Lord Goff's words) “might in any event have been incurred in the ordinary course of things”. I am satisfied that had the defendants been paid the correct sums by way of royalties their levels of expenditure would have been lower.

89 I accordingly conclude that each of the defendants has changed his position in consequence of the overpayments. The question then arises whether the defendants can rely on their change of position as a defence to the entirety of the claim, or only to some (and if so what) part of it.

90 In my judgment, the defence of change of position which I have found to be established cannot extend to the entirety of the claim, if only because had the correct amount of royalties been paid the defendants' level of outgoings might not have reduced proportionately. The defendants' propensity to overspend their income means that it is impossible to establish an exact correlation between their income and their outgoings.

91 So how far does the defence of change of position extend? I accept Mr Howe's submission that, on the particular facts of the instant case, the court should adopt a broad approach to this question; if only because, for reasons already given, the defendants' evidence as to their financial affairs does not admit of detailed analysis.

92 In all the circumstances as I have found them, I conclude that the defence of change of position extends to one half of the overpayments: in other words, that (subject to the Limitation Issue) the claimant's recovery should be limited to $172,575.61 and £14,685.12. In my judgment that represents, on the evidence, a conservative assessment of extent to which the overpayments led to a change of position on the part of the defendants.

93 It is, however, to be observed that limiting the claim to half the overpayments will almost certainly have no practical effect, since on the evidence it is highly improbable, to put it no higher, that the defendants' future royalty entitlement from sales of the Live Album will amount to anything approaching that sum.}}

The '''clergy–penitent privilege''', '''clergy privilege''', '''confessional privilege''',  '''priest–penitent privilege''', '''clergyman–communicant privilege''', or '''ecclesiastical privilege'''  is a rule of evidence that forbids judicial inquiry into certain communications (spoken or otherwise) between clergy and members of their congregation. The law recognises certain communication as [[Privilege (evidence)|privileged]] and not subject to otherwise obligatory disclosure; for example, this often applies to communications between [[lawyer]]s and clients. In many jurisdictions certain communications between a member of the [[clergy]] of some or all religious faiths (e.g., a minister, priest, rabbi, imam) and a person consulting them in confidence are privileged in law. In particular, Catholics are [[Confession (Catholic Church)|required to confess]] sins to priests, who are [[Seal of the Confessional in the Catholic Church|unconditionally forbidden]] by [[Canon law  of the Catholic Church|Church canon law]] from making any disclosure,&lt;ref name=unbreakable&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2014/07/11/priest-could-be-jailed-for-refusing-to-break-seal-of-confession/ |title=Priest could be jailed for refusing to break seal of Confession |newspaper=Catholic Herald|date=11 July 2014  |author=&lt;!--not stated--&gt; |accessdate= 30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a position supported by the law of many countries, although in conflict with civil law in some jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=unbreakable/&gt; It is a distinct concept from that of [[confidentiality]] (see [[non-disclosure agreement]]).

The protection of the clergy–penitent privilege relationships rests on one of the more basic privileges as strong or stronger than the similar clauses to confidentiality between lawyer and client.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,954420,00.html|title= Confidence and the Clergy |author= Richard N.

==Republic of Ireland==
The privilege was recognised under the [[common law]] of the [[Republic of Ireland]] as the privilege of the priest in the case of ''Cook v. Carroll'' [1945] IR 515.&lt;ref&gt;McNicol (1992) p. 338, n. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;, reversing an earlier judgment from 1802&lt;ref&gt;''[[Butler v. Moore]]''&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2011, in the wake of [[Catholic Church sexual abuse scandal in Ireland|several sex abuse scandals]], the [[Government of the 31st Dáil|Fine Gael–Labour government]] announced plans to criminalise failure to report an allegation of [[child abuse]], even if made during confession.&lt;ref name="journalie"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thejournal.ie/shatter-insists-mandatory-reporting-will-apply-to-priests-despite-cardinals-comments-212267-Aug2011/ |title=Shatter insists mandatory reporting will apply to priests despite Cardinal’s comments |date=29 August 2011 |publisher=TheJournal.ie  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seán Brady]], the Catholic [[primate of all Ireland]], condemned this as compromising the seal of the confessional.&lt;ref name="journalie"/&gt;

==United States==
{{main|Confessional privilege (United States)}}
According to former U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice, Warren Burger, "The clergy privilege is rooted in the imperative need for confidence and trust. The... privilege recognizes the human need to disclose to a spiritual counselor, in total and absolute confidence, what are believed to be flawed acts or thoughts and to receive consolations and guidance in return."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hiq4eCuGcjAC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=Two+kinds+of+laws+serve+to+limit,+influence,+or+inform+clergy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Dqg2cxycTk&amp;sig=0MSCbjlPHk1qmK_TfizC5HcDOlk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WOOKUeaHFIvnigLKy4DgBw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Two%20kinds%20of%20laws%20serve%20to%20limit%2C%20influence%2C%20or%20inform%20clergy&amp;f=false Child Abuse Investigations: Good, Bad or Ugly?]&lt;/ref&gt;

A pastor has a duty to hold in confidence any information obtained during a counseling session. A pastor who violates this trust might be on the losing end of a suit for an invasion of privacy or defamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title =  Pastoral Counseling: Safeguard Against Potential Liability  | journal = Church Solutions | author = David C. Gibbs, attorney | date = September 26, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] is largely cited as the [[Jurisprudence|jurisprudential]] basis. The earliest and most influential case acknowledging the priest–penitent privilege was ''People v. Phillips'' (1813), where the Court of General Sessions of the City of [[New York City|New York]] refused to compel a priest to testify. The Court opined:

{{Quote|text=It is essential to the free exercise of a religion, that its ordinances should be administered—that its ceremonies as well as its essentials should be protected. Secrecy is of the essence of penance. The sinner will not confess, nor will the priest receive his confession, if the veil of secrecy is removed: To decide that the minister shall promulgate what he receives in confession, is to declare that there shall be no penance...}}

A few years after ''Phillips'' was decided, ''People v. Smith'' distinguished the case on the grounds that the defendant had approached the minister as a "friend or adviser," not in his capacity as a professional or spiritual advisor. As with most privileges, a debate still exists about the circumstances under which the priest–penitent privilege applies. The capacity in which the clergyman is acting at the time of the communication is relevant in many jurisdictions.

=== Clergy–penitent privilege and mandated reporting ===
In U.S. practice, the confidentiality privilege has been extended to non-Catholic clergy and non-sacramental counseling, with explicit clergy exemptions put into most state law over the past several decades. In most states, information gained within a confession or private conversation is considered privileged and may be exempted from [[Mandated reporter|mandatory reporting requirements]].&lt;ref name ="ChildWelfareClergy"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/systemwide/laws-policies/statutes/clergymandated/ | title=Clergy as Mandatory Reporters of Child Abuse and Neglect| author=[[Child Welfare Information Gateway]] | publisher= [[United States Children's Bureau]] | year = 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

=== Federal rule===
Proposed, but rejected, Rule 506 (Communications to Clergy) of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] provides:

{{quote|
:(a) Definitions. As used in this rule:
::(1) A "clergyman" is a minister, priest, rabbi, or other similar functionary of a religious organization, or an individual reasonably believed so to be by the person consulting him. 
::(2) A communication is "confidential" if made privately and not intended for further disclosure except to other persons present in furtherance of the purpose of the communication. 
:(b) General rule of privilege. A person has a privilege to refuse to disclose and to prevent another from disclosing a confidential communication made by the person to a clergyman in his professional character as a spiritual adviser.
:(c) Who may claim the privilege. The privilege may be claimed by the person, by his guardian or conservator, or by his personal representative if he is deceased. The clergyman may claim the privilege on behalf of the person. His authority so to do is presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary.}}

=== Legal precedents in various states ===
According to New York state law, confessions and confidences made to a clergyman or other minister are privileged and cannot be used as evidence. This privilege is not limited to communications with a particular kind of priest or congregant, and it is not confined to statements made "under the cloak of confession". What matters is that the conversations were of a spiritual nature, were confidential enough to indicate that the penitent intended that they be kept secret, and that the penitent did not waive the privilege subsequently.&lt;ref name="law.justia.com"&gt;{{citation|year=2012|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/new-york/2012/cvp/article-45/4505/|title=Confidential Communication Clergy Privileged 4505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York law (NY CPLR 4505) provides that unless the person confessing or confiding waives the privilege, a clergyman, or other minister of any religion or duly accredited Christian Science practitioner, shall not be allowed to disclose a confession or confidence made to him in his professional character as a spiritual advisor.&lt;ref name="law.justia.com"/&gt;

A 1999 Oregon bill gives clergy members the same type of immunity long granted to spouses, whose conversations are privileged.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=8545/|title= Oregon House Backs Bill to Keep Confessions to Clergy Confidential |author=Associated Press | editor  = Freedomforum.org | date = February 12, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oregon Statute ORS 40.260 (Clergy–Penitent Privilege) states confidential communication made privately and not intended for further disclosure may not be examined unless consent to the disclosure of the confidential communication is given by the person who made the communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/40.260 |title= Clergy–Penitent privilege |author=State of Oregon |journal=Oregon Statutes| number = ORS 40.260|date = 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oregon's reporting law 419B.010(1), explicitly exempts pastors from any duty to report such privileged communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/419B.010 |title= Clergy–Penitent privilege |author=State of Oregon |journal=Oregon Statutes| number = ORS 491B.010(1) | date = 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In California, absent a waiver [Ca Evid &amp; 912], both clergy and penitent – whether or not parties to the action – have a privilege to refuse to disclose a "penitential" communication.[Ca Evid &amp; 1033, 1034].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jehovahs-witness.net/jw/friends/227338/1/Clergy-Confession-and-California-Law-I-found-this-interesting-info| title =  Clergy Confession and California Law  | date = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In twenty-five states, the clergyman–communicant statutory privilege does not clearly indicate who holds the privilege. In seventeen states, the penitent's right to hold the privilege is clearly stated. In only six states, both a penitent and a member of the clergy are expressly allowed by the statute to hold the privilege.

In Florida, pastors have an absolute right to keep counseling details confidential.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{citation| title =  Court Rules State Cannot Usurp Clergy Confidentiality  | date = November 2004 |work= Christian Examiner | publisher = Keener Communications Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Official Code of Georgia Annotated states: Every communication made by any person professing religious faith, seeking spiritual comfort, or seeking counseling to any Protestant minister of the Gospel, any priest of the Roman Catholic faith, any priest of the Greek Orthodox Catholic faith, any Jewish rabbi, or any Christian or Jewish minister or similar functionary, by whatever name called, shall be deemed privileged. No such minister, priest, rabbi, or similar functionary shall disclose any communications made to him or her by any such person professing religious faith, seeking spiritual guidance, or seeking counseling, nor shall such minister, priest, rabbi, or similar functionary be competent or compellable to testify with reference to any such communication in any court (O.C.G.A 24-5-502).

Louisiana's Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that a priest may be compelled to testify about what he was told in the confessional regarding a particular sexual abuse case, leaving the priest at risk of excommunication if he even confirms that a confession took place, or jail for contempt of court should he refuse to testify.&lt;ref name=unbreakable/&gt; However, the Court later ruled that a priest has no duty to report confidential information heard during a sacramental confession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/courts/article_54c7bc3c-9d5b-11e6-bd7e-e3457316f1e4.html |title=Priests can't legally be forced to reveal what's heard in confessional, Louisiana Supreme Court rules |newspaper=The Advocate|date=28 October 2016  |author=JOE GYAN JR.  |accessdate= 30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Priest–penitent privilege in England}}
{{see also|Priest–penitent privilege in England from the Reformation to the nineteenth century|Public Interest Immunity}}

The status of priest–penitent privilege in English law has not been absolutely determined (see specific articles).

==Canada==
Two [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] recognize the privilege in the communications between individuals and their religious leaders in their statutes ([[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] under its Evidence Act &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.assembly.nl.ca/Legislation/sr/statutes/e16.htm |title=&lt;nowiki&gt;Evidence Act, RSNL 1990 Ch. E-16, s 8 &lt;/nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Quebec]] under its '' [[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]]'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/C-12 |title=&lt;nowiki&gt;Charter of human rights and freedoms, C-12, s 9&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Otherwise, religious communication is covered by [[common law]].

Canadian law descends from British [[common law]], and as such the status of priest–penitent privilege is not well defined in national jurisprudence. ''[[R. v. Gruenke]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://canlii.ca/t/1fsjh |title=&lt;nowiki&gt;R. v. Gruenke, 1991 CanLII 40 (SCC), [1991] 3 SCR 263&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1991 is the leading [[Supreme Court of Canada]] case regarding this privilege. Religious communications are not presumptively (''[[prima facie]]'') privileged.

The court establishes that a test, proposed by [[John Henry Wigmore]], might be employed to determine whether a specific communication is privileged or not. The "Wigmore Criteria" are seen as a general framework, not a "carved in stone" approach. The "Wigmore Criteria" are generally used to determine if privilege covers communications that do not fall under the classic privileged communications such as [[Legal professional privilege|solicitor-client privilege]] or [[spousal privilege]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://canlii.ca/t/1mzhn |title=&lt;nowiki&gt;Slavutych v. Baker et al., 1975 CanLII 5 (SCC), [1976] 1 SCR 254&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To determine whether a communication is privileged, the "Wigmore Criteria" state that:
#The communications must originate in a confidence that they will not be disclosed.
#This element of confidentiality must be essential to the full and satisfactory maintenance of the relation between the parties.
#The relation must be one which in the opinion of the community ought to be sedulously fostered.
#The injury that would inure to the relation by the disclosure of the communication must be greater than the benefit thereby gained for the correct disposal of litigation.

The "Wigmore Criteria" are informed by the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] guarantee of freedom of religion (protected under s.2(a)) and the interpretive s.27 ("''This Charter shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the preservation and enhancement of the multicultural heritage of Canadians.''")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/charter/ |title=&lt;nowiki&gt;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms – PART I OF THE CONSTITUTION ACT, 1982&lt;/nowiki&gt;|location=s.2(a), s.27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of s.27, the term "religious communications" is used in place of the more common "priest–penitent" term. Similarly, analysis should begin from a non-denominational approach.

Religious freedom strengthens the argument in favour of recognition of the privilege for religious communications. However, religious communications are only privileged in particular cases when the Wigmore criteria are satisfied. While a formal confession process is not necessary, it can help in determining whether there is an expectation of privacy when evaluating the communication using the "Wigmore Criteria."

In ''[[R. v. Gruenke]]'', it was found that the communications were not privileged because there was no expectation of privilege between Ms. Gruenke and her pastor and her religious counsellor.

In October 1999, it was reported that the Canadian government had opposed a plan to recognize the value of priest–penitient privilege within the bounds of [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Canada+attacks+priest-penitent+rights-a076472026 Canada attacks priest–penitent rights]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poland ==
Article 178 of Polish [[criminal code]] explicitly forbids calling a clergyman as a witness in order to disclose information he obtained during confession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/DetailsServlet?id=WDU19970890555 Polish Criminal Code] (in Polish)&lt;/ref&gt; Article 261 of Polish [[civil code]] allows clergymen to abstain from testifying informations he obtained during confession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/DetailsServlet?id=WDU19640430296 Polish Civil Code] (in Polish)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justification of the principle==
McNicol&lt;ref&gt;McNicol (1992), pp. 328–331.&lt;/ref&gt; gives three arguments in favour of the privilege:
*[[Freedom of religion]].
*The ethical duty of ministers of religion to keep confessions confidential.
*The practical fact that ministers of religion will inevitably be ruled by the conscience and defy the courts, even at the cost of their own liberty.

==Bentham's views==
[[Jeremy Bentham]], writing in the early years of the nineteenth century, devoted a whole chapter to serious, considered argument that [[Roman Catholic]] confession should be exempted from disclosure in judicial proceedings, even in [[Protestant]] countries, entitled: ''Exclusion of the Evidence of a Catholic Priest, respecting the confessions entrusted to him, proper''.&lt;ref&gt;''Rationale of Judicial Evidence'', in Bowring, ''Works of Jeremy Bentham'', VII, Bk.IX, Pt.II, Ch.VI section 5, pp. 366–368&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ce"&gt;''Catholic Encyclopaedia'' (1913) "Seal of the Confessional"&lt;/ref&gt; Remarkably, Bentham was an opponent of professional privilege for the giving of legal advice. He noted:

{{quotation|Among the cases in which the exclusion of evidence presents itself as expedient, the case of Catholic confession possesses a special claim to notice. In a political state, in which this most extensively adopted modification of the Christian religion is established upon a footing either of equality or preference, the necessity of the exclusion demanded will probably appear too imperious to admit of dispute. In taking a view of the reasons which plead in favour of it, let us therefore suppose the scene to lie in a country in which the Catholic religion is barely tolerated: in which the wish would be to see the number of its votaries decline, but without being accompanied with any intention to aim at its suppression by coercive methods. Any reasons which plead in favour of the exclusion in this case will, a fortiori, serve to justify the maintenance of it, in a country in which this religion is predominant or established.}}

He refers the reasons in favour of the exclusion to two headings:
*evidence (the aggregate mass of evidence) not lessened
*"vexation", "preponderant vexation".

Under the first heading he says that the effect of non-exclusion would be the decrease in the practice of confession, he said:

{{quotation|The advantage gained by the coercion gained in the shape of assistance to justice, would be casual, and even rare: the mischief produced by it, constant and all-extensive. ... The advantages of a temporal nature, which, in the countries in which this religious practice is in use, flow from it at present, would in a great degree be lost: the loss of them would be as extensive as the good effects of the coercion in the character of an aid to justice. To form any comparative estimate of the bad and good effects flowing from this institution, belongs not, even in a point of view purely temporal, to the design of this work. The basis of the inquiry is that this institution is an essential feature of the Catholic religion, and that the Catholic religion is not to be suppressed by force. If in some shapes the revelation of testimony thus obtained would be of use to justice, there are others in which the disclosures thus made are actually of use to justice, under the assurance of their never reaching the ears of the judge. Repentance, and consequent abstinence from future misdeeds of the like nature; repentance, followed even by satisfaction in some shape or other, satisfaction more or less adequate for the past: such are the wellknown consequences of the institution: though in a proportion which, besides being everywhere unascertainable, will in every country and in every age be variable, according to the degree and quality of the influence exercised over the people by the religious sanction in that form, and the complexion of the moral part of their character in other respects. }}

The whole chapter is exclusively limited to the claim for protection for the Catholic practice of confession.&lt;ref&gt;See also, "Evidence that ought not to be admitted – Disclosure of Catholic Confession", ''Introductory View of the Rationale of Evidence'', in Bowring, ''Works of Jeremy Bentham'', VI, section 5, pp. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental aspect ==
Electricity from hydro schemes cuts down the use of [[Wood fuel|wood]] for [[cooking]], [[heating]] and [[light]]ing, consequently reducing [[deforestation]] which is a huge problem in the [[Deforestation by region|region]]. The hydro schemes also cut [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, by virtually eliminating the use of [[kerosene]] [[Kerosene lamp|lighting]], cutting the use of [[diesel engine|diesel]] [[Diesel generator|generators]], and also reducing the use of unsustainable wood. A detailed breakdown has not been made of [[Fossil fuel|fuels]] replaced, but an indication of the significance can be made by assuming that the estimated 110,000 [[Kilowatt hour|MWh]] of electricity generated each year replaces diesel generation producing around 0.8 [[tonne]]s of [[carbon dioxide]] per MWh.

'''Promulgation''' is the formal proclamation or declaration that a new [[statute|statutory]] or [[administrative law]] is enacted after its final [[Enactment of a bill|approval]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promulgate Law &amp; Legal Definition|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/promulgate/|website=USLegal.com|publisher=US Legal, Inc.|accessdate=October 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s, this additional step is necessary before the law can take effect.

After a new law is approved, it is announced to the public through the publication of [[government gazette]]s and/or on official government [[website]]s. National laws of extraordinary importance to the public may be announced by the [[head of state]] on national broadcast. Local laws are usually announced in local [[newspaper]]s and published in bulletins or [[compendium|compendia]] of municipal regulations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

[[File:VomStein (Gemälde Rincklake).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl Freiherr vom und zum Stein]]]]
[[File:Fürst Hardenberg.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl August von Hardenberg]].]]

The '''Prussian Reform Movement''' was a series of constitutional, administrative, social and economic reforms early in the nineteenth-century [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. They are sometimes known as the '''Stein-Hardenberg Reforms''', for [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Karl Freiherr vom Stein]] and [[Karl August Fürst von Hardenberg]], their main initiators. Before the Second World War, German historians, such as [[Heinrich von Treitschke]], saw the reforms as the first steps towards the [[unification of Germany]] and the foundation of the [[German Empire]].{{sfn|Dwyer|2014|p=255}}

The reforms were a reaction to the defeat of the Prussians by [[Napoleon I]] at [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena-Auerstedt]] in 1806, leading to the [[Treaties of Tilsit|second Treaty of Tilsit]], in which Prussia lost about half its territory and was forced to make massive tribute payments to France. To make those payments, it needed to rationalize its administration. Prussia's defeat and subjection also demonstrated the weaknesses of its [[absolute monarchy]] model of statehood and excluded it from the great powers of Europe.

To become a great power again, it initiated reforms from 1807 onwards, based on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas and in line with reforms in other European nations. They led to the reorganization of Prussia's government and administration and changes in its agricultural trade regulations, including the abolition of [[serfdom]] and allowing peasants to become landowners. In industry, the reforms aimed to encourage [[Competition (economics)|competition]] by suppressing the [[monopoly]] of [[guild]]s. The administration was decentralised and the nobility's power reduced. There were also parallel military reforms led by [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst]], [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau]] and [[Hermann von Boyen]] and educational reforms headed by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]. Gneisenau made it clear that all these reforms were part of a single programme when he stated that Prussia had to put its foundations in "the three-faced primacy of arms, knowledge and the constitution".&lt;ref&gt;Cited after {{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is harder to ascertain when the reforms ended – in the fields of the constitution and internal politics in particular, the year 1819 marked a turning point, with [[Concert of Europe|Restoration]] tendencies gaining the upper hand over constitutional ones. Though the reforms undoubtedly modernised Prussia, their successes were mixed, with results that were against the reformers' original wishes. The agricultural reforms freed some peasants, but the liberalisation of landholding condemned many of them to poverty. The nobility saw its privileges reduced but its overall position reinforced.

==Reasons, aims and principles==

===Prussia in 1807===

====Prussia's position in Europe====
[[File:Preussen-1806.jpg|thumb|Map showing Prussian territory after Tilsit (in orange)]]
In 1803, [[German Mediatisation]] profoundly changed the political and administrative map of Germany. Favourable to mid-ranking states and to Prussia, the reorganisation reinforced French influence. In 1805, the [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]] formed in the hope of stopping French domination of Europe from advancing further, but the coalition's armies were defeated at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] in December 1805. Triumphant, [[Napoleon I]] continued working towards dismantling the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. On 12 July 1806, he detached 16 German states from it to form the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] under French influence. On 6 August the same year, [[Francis I of Austria]] was forced to renounce his title of emperor, and the Empire had to be dissolved.

French influence reached as far as the Prussian frontier by the time [[Frederick III of Prussia|Frederick William III of Prussia]] realised the situation. Encouraged by the [[United Kingdom]], Prussia broke off its neutrality (in force since 1795) and repudiated the 1795 [[Peace of Basel]], joined the [[Fourth Coalition]] and entered the war against France.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=438}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prussia mobilised its troops on 9 August 1806 but two months later was defeated at [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena-Auerstedt]]. Prussia was on the verge of collapse, and three days after the defeat Frederick William III issued posters appealing to the inhabitants of his capital Berlin to remain calm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nordbruch|1996|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten days later, Napoleon entered Berlin.

The war ended on 7 July 1807 with the first Treaty of Tilsit between Napoleon and [[Alexander I of Russia]]. Two days later, Napoleon signed a second Treaty of Tilsit with Prussia, removing half its territory&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Knopper|Mondot|2008|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; and forcing Prussia's king to recognise [[Jérôme Bonaparte]] as sovereign of the newly created [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], to which Napoleon annexed the Prussian territories west of the [[river Elbe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prussia had had 9 million inhabitants in 1805,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pölitz|1830|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which it lost 4.55 million in the treaty.&lt;ref name="p501"&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=501}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also forced to pay 120 million francs to France in war indemnities&lt;ref name="p501" /&gt; and fund a French occupying force of 150,000 troops.

====Financial situation====
The biting defeat of 1806 was not only the result of poor decisions and Napoleon's military genius, but also a reflection on Prussia's poor internal structures. In the 18th century the Prussian state had been the model of [[enlightened despotism]] for the rest of Germany. To the west and south, there was no single state or alliance that could challenge it. Yet in the era of [[Frederick II of Prussia]] it was a country oriented towards reform, beginning with the abolition of torture in 1740.

[[File:Der König überall2.JPG|thumb|[[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]] inspecting his lands and talking to potato growers.]]
The economic reforms of the second half of the 18th century were based on a [[mercantilism|mercantilist]] logic. They had to allow Prussia a certain degree of [[self-sufficiency]] and give it sufficient surpluses for export. Joseph Rovan emphasises that {{cquote|the state's interest required that its subjects were kept in good health, well nourished, and that agriculture and manufacture made the country independent of foreign countries, all the while allowing it to raise money by exporting surpluses&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=413}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Economic development also had to fund and support the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Reihlen|1988|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prussia's infrastructure was developed in the form of canals, roads and factories. Roads connected its outlying regions to its centre, the [[Oder]], [[Warta]] and [[Noteć]] marshes were reclaimed and farmed&lt;ref name="p411"&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=411}}&lt;/ref&gt; and apple-growing was developed.

However, industry remained very limited, with heavy state-control. Trades were organised into monopolistic guilds and fiscal and customs laws were complex and inefficient. After the defeat of 1806, funding the occupation force and the war indemnities put Prussia's economy under pressure. As in the 18th century, the early 19th century reforms aimed to create budgetary margins, notably in their efforts towards economic development.

====Administrative and legal situation====
Frederick II of Prussia favoured both economic and political reform. His government worked on the first codification of Prussia's laws – the 19,000 paragraph ''Allgemeines Landrecht für die preußischen Staaten'' (literally the ''General legal code for the Prussia states''). Article 22 indicated that all his subjects were equal before the law: {{Cquote|The state's laws unite all its members, without difference of status, rank or sex}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Frederick died in 1786 leaving the code incomplete and was succeeded by [[Frederick William II of Prussia]], who extended the same administrative structure and the same civil servants.

The absolutist system started to re-solidify under the obscurantist influence of [[Johann Christoph von Wöllner]], financial privy councillor to Frederick William II. The reforms stalled, especially in the field of modernising society. The editing of the ''Allgemeines Landrecht'' was completed in 1792, but the [[French Revolution]] led to opposition to it, especially from the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then withdrawn from circulation for revision and did not come back into force until 1794. Its aims included linking the state and middle class society to the law and to civil rights, but at the same time it retained and confirmed the whole structure of the [[Ancien Régime]].&lt;ref name="p411" /&gt; [[Serfdom]], for example, was abolished in Prussia's royal domains but not in the estates of the great landowners east of the [[river Elbe]].&lt;ref name="Nipperdey_33"&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nobility also held onto its position in the army and administration.

In 1797 Frederick William III succeeded his father Frederick William II, but at the time of his accession he found society dominated by the old guard, apart from the ''Allgemeines Landrecht'' promulgated in 1794. His own idea of the state was absolutist and he considered that the state had to be in the hands of the sovereign.&lt;ref name="harvp|Griewank|2003|p=14"&gt;{{harvp|Griewank|2003|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1806, several observers and high-level civil servants such as [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom Stein]] and [[Karl August von Hardenberg]] underlined the fact that the Prussia state needed restructuring. As Minister of Finances and the Economy, Stein put some reforms in place, such as standardising the price of salt (then a state monopoly) and partially abolishing the export-import taxes between the kingdom's territories. In April 1806, he published ''Darstellung der fehlerhaften Organisation des Kabinetts und der Notwendigkeit der Bildung einer Ministerialkonferenz'' (literally ''Exposé on the imperfect organisation of the cabinet and on the necessity of forming a ministerial conference''). In it, he wrote: {{Cquote|There should be a new and improved organisation of state affairs, to the measure of the state's needs born of circumstances. The main aim is to gain more strength and unity across the administration}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Türk|Lemke|Bruch|2006|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prussia's war against Napoleon revealed the gaps in its state organisation. Pro-war and a strong critic of his sovereign's policies, Stein was dismissed in January 1807 after the defeat by France. However, Frederick William III saw that the Prussian state and Prussian society could only survive if they began to reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wehler|1987|p=401}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the treaty of Tislsit, he recalled Stein as a minister on 10 July 1807 with the backing of Hardenberg and Napoleon, the latter of whom saw in Stein a supporter of France.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Pertz, pp. 449–450.{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queen [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]] also supported Stein's re-appointment&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=451}}&lt;/ref&gt; – indeed, she was more in favour of reform than her husband and was its main initiator. Aided by Stein, Hardenberg and others, she had convinced her husband to mobilise in 1806 and in 1807 she had even met with Napoleon to demand that he review the hard conditions imposed in the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Förster|2004|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardenberg wrote the same year: {{cquote|I believe that queen Louise could tell the king what the queen of Navarre, [[Catherine de Foix]], said to her husband [[Jean d'Albret]] – "If we were born, your dear Catherine and my dear Jean, we would not have lost our kingdom"; for she would have listened to men of energy and asked advice, she would have taken them on and acted decisively. What [the king] lacks in personal strength is replaced in this way. An enterprising courage would have replaced a tolerant courage.&lt;ref name="harvp|Griewank|2003|p=14"&gt;{{harvp|Griewank|2003|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stein set certain conditions for his taking the job, among which was that the cabinets system should be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Pertz, pp. 115–116.{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its place, ministers had to win their right to power by speaking to the king directly. After this condition had been satisfied, Stein took up his role and was thus directly responsible for the civil administration as well as exercising a controlling role over the other areas. Frederick William III still showed little inclination to engage in reforms and hesitated for a long while.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Förster|2004|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reformers thus had to expend much effort convincing the king. In this situation, it was within the bureaucracy and the army that the reformers had to fight the hardest against the nobility and the conservative and restorationist forces. The idealist philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] thus had a great influence on the reformers – Stein and Hardenberg each produced a treatise describing their ideas in 1807.

====''Nassauer Denkschrift''====
[[File:Standbild Heumarkt Köln - Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom Stein.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl Heinrich vom Stein]], instigator of the early reforms]]
After his recall, Stein retired to his lands in [[Nassau, Germany|Nassau]]. In 1807, he published the ''Nassauer Denkschrift'', whose main argument was the reform of the administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the reforms in the states of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], Stein's approach was traditionalist and above all anti-Enlightenment, focussing instead on critiquing absolutism. Stein followed English models such as the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 and was sceptical of a centralised and militarised bureaucracy, favouring a decentralised and collegiate administration. With his collaborators, he followed (in his own words) a "policy of defensive modernisation, not with Napoleon but against him".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Stein, the administration should be split up by field and no longer by geographical area.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the administration had to be divided into two branches – the public revenue branch and the top-level state-policy branch (''oberste Staatsbehörde''). One of the main aims of this concept was to rationalise the state financial system to raise the money to meet its war indemnities under the treaty of Tilsit. Rationalising the state finances would allow the state to raise revenue but limit losses due to poor administrative organisation.

Stein was an anti-absolutist and an anti-statist, suspicious of bureaucracy and central government. For him, civil servants were only men paid to carry out their task with "indifference" and "fear of innovation".&lt;ref name="p141"&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above all, he set out to decentralise and form a collegiate state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein thus gave more autonomy to the provinces, [[Districts of Germany|Kreise]] and towns. Thanks to the different posts he had previously held, Stein, realised that he had to harmonise the government of the provinces.&lt;ref name="p141" /&gt; He had recourse to the old corporative constitution, as he had experienced in [[Westphalia]]. The landowner, according to Stein, was the keystone to local self-government – "If the landowner is excluded from all participation in the provincial administration, then the link which links him to the fatherland remains unused".&lt;ref name="p141"/&gt;

However, it was not only functional considerations which played a role for Stein. He felt he first had to educate the people in politics and provincial self-government was one of the most useful things in this area. On landowners' participation in the provincial administration, he wrote&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|the economy as regards administrative costs is however the least important advantage gained by the landowners' participation in the provincial administration. What is much more important is to stimulate the spirit of the community and of the civic sense, the use of sleeping and poorly led forces and spreading knowledge, the harmony between the spirit of the nation, its views and its needs and those of the national administrations, the re-awakening of the feelings for the fatherland, independence and national honour.}} In his reform projects, Stein tried to reform a political system without losing sight of the Prussian unity shaken by the defeat of 1806.

====''Rigaer Denkschrift''====
[[File:Standbild Heumarkt Köln - Barthold Georg Niebuhr.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr|Niebuhr]] on the Cologne monument (1878)]]
Stein and Hardenberg not only made a mark on later policy but also represented two different approaches to politics, with Hardenberg more steeped in Enlightenment ideas. He took the principles of the French Revolution and the suggestions created by Napoleon's practical policy on board more deeply than Stein.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardenberg was a [[statism|statist]] who aspired to reinforce the state through a dense and centralised administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kitchen|2006|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, these differences only represented a certain change of tendency among the reformers. The initiatives put in place were very much things of their own time, despite the latter umbrella concept of the 'Stein-Hardenberg reforms'.

The ''Rigaer Denkschrift'' was published the same year as Stein's work and presented on 12 September 1807. It bore the title 'On the reorganisation of the Prussian state'. Previously living in [[Riga]], Hardenberg had been summoned in July by the king of Prussia under pressure from Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardenberg developed ideas on the overall organisation of the Prussian state that were different from those of his fellow reformers. The main editors of the ''Rigaer Denkschrift'' were [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]], an expert financier, [[Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein]], a future minister of Finances&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Walther|1993|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Heinrich Theodor von Schön]]. These three men concluded that the Revolution had given France a new impetus: "All the sleeping forces were re-awakened, the misery and weakness, the old prejudices and the shortcomings were destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;''Rigaer Denkschrift'' in {{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|pp=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in their view, Prussia had to follow France's example: {{Cquote|The folly of thinking that one can access the revolution in the safest way, remaining attached to the [[ancien regime]] and strictly following the principles for which it argues has only stimulated the revolution and made it continually grow larger. These principles' power is so great – they are so generally recognised and accepted, that the state that does not accept them must expect to be ruined or to be forced to accept them ; even the rapacity of Napoleon and his most-favoured aides are submitted to this power, and will remain so against their will. One cannot deny that, despite the iron despotism with which he governs, he nevertheless follows these principles widely in their essential features ; at least he is forced to make a show of obeying them.&lt;ref name="Rigaer_88"&gt;''Rigaer Denkschrift'' in {{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The authors thus favoured a revolution "im guten Sinn" or "in the right sense",&lt;ref name="Rigaer_88"/&gt; which historians later described as "revolution from above". Sovereigns and their ministers thus put in place reforms to gain all the advantages of a revolution without any of the disadvantages, such as losing their power or suffering from setbacks or outbreaks of violence.

As in Stein's Denkschrift, the ''Rigaer Denkschrift'' favours reviving national spirit to work with the nation and the administration. Hardenberg also sought to define society's three classes – the nobility, the middle class and the peasants. For him, the peasants took part in "the most numerous and most important but nevertheless the most neglected and belittled class in the state" and added that "the peasant class has to become the main object of our attention".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardenberg also sought to underline the principal of merit which he felt had to rule in society, by affirming "no task in the state, without exception, is for this or that class but is open to merit and to skill and to the ability of all classes".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overview of the reforms===
Within fourteen months of his appointment, Stein put in place or prepared the most important reforms. The major financial crisis caused by the requirements of Tilsit forced Stein into a radical austerity policy, harnessing the state's machinery to raise the required indemnities. The success of the reforms begun by Stein was the result of a discussion already going on within the upper bureaucracy and Stein's role in putting them in place was variable – he was almost never, for example, involved in questions of detail. Many of the reforms were drafted by others among his collaborators, such as [[Heinrich Theodor von Schön]] in the case of the October decree.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Klein|1965|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Stein was responsible for presenting the reforms to the king and to other forces opposed to them, such as the nobility.

[[File:2006-08-07 Rathaus Schoeneberg Gedenkrelief vom Stein.jpg|thumb|left|Plaque celebrating Stein and the ''Städteordnung'' in Berlin (1913)]]
During Stein's short period of office, decisive laws were promulgated, even if the organizational law on state administration was not published until 1808 (i.e. after Stein's fall). It was during Stein's time in office that the edict of October 1807 and the cities' organizational reforms (''Städteordnung'') of 1808 were put into effect. After a short term of office by [[Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein]], Hardenberg regained control of policy. From 1810, he bore the title of ''[[Staatskanzler]]'',&lt;ref name="harvp|Büsch|1992|p=287"&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; retaining it until 1822. Thanks to him, land reform was completed via the Edicts of Regulation (''Regulierungsedikten'') of 1811 and 1816 as well as the ''Ablöseordnung'' (literally the ''redemption decree'') of 1821. He also pushed through the reforms of trades such as the edict on professional tax of 2 November 1810 and the law on policing trades (''Gewerbepolizeigesetz'') of 1811. In 1818 he reformed the customs laws, abolishing internal taxes. As for social reform, the edict of emancipation was promulgated in 1812 for Jewish citizens. Despite the different initial situations and aims pursued, similar reforms were carried out in the states of the Confederation of the Rhine, except for the military and educational reforms. The Restoration tendencies put a stop to the reformist policy in Prussia around 1819 or 1820.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main reform fields===
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|upright|In the field of political economy, the reformers were strongly influenced by [[Adam Smith]].]]
The reforms which were to be put in place were essentially a synthesis between historic and progressive concepts. Their aim was to replace the absolutist state structures which had become outdated. The state would have to offer its citizens the possibility of becoming involved in public affairs on the basis of personal freedom and equality before the law. The government's main policy aim was to make it possible to liberate Prussian territory from French occupation and return the kingdom to great-power status through modernising domestic policy.&lt;ref name="p453"&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prussian subject had to become an active citizen of the state thanks to the introduction of self-government to the provinces, districts (''kreise'') and towns. National sentiment had to be awakened as Stein foresaw in his Nassau work,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; but a citizen's duties were in some ways more important than his or her rights. Moreover, Stein's concept of self-government rested on a class-based society. A compromise between corporative aspects and a modern representative system was put in place. The old divisions into the [[three estates]] of nobility, clergy and [[bourgeoisie]] were replaced by divisions into nobility, bourgeoisie and peasants. The right to vote also had to be expanded, particularly to free peasants, which would be one of the bases for the freeing of the peasants in 1807.

The new organisation of power in the countryside and reform of industry were factors in the liberalisation of the Prussian economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, the Prussian reforms went much further than those in the states of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] and were much more successful. The 1806 financial crisis, intensified by the indemnities, the occupation costs and other war costs, gave the necessary impetus for these changes – in all, Prussia had to pay France 120 million francs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leo|1845|p=491}}&lt;/ref&gt; The freeing of the peasants, the industrial reforms and the other measures removed economic barriers and imposed free competition. The Prussian reforms relied on the economic liberalism of [[Adam Smith]] (as propounded by [[Heinrich Theodor von Schön]] and [[Christian Jakob Kraus]]) more heavily than the south German reformers. The Prussian reformers did not actively seek to encourage Prussian industry, which was then under-developed, but to remedy the crisis in the agricultural economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|pp=109–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State and administration==
The reformers' top priority was to reorganise the administration and the state. Before 1806, there was not really a single Prussian state, but a multiplicity of states and provinces, mostly only held together by the single person of the king himself. There was no unified administration – instead there were the two parallel structures of decentralised administrations (each responsible for all portfolios within a single given territory) and a centralised administration (responsible for a single portfolio across the whole of Prussia). This double structure made any coordinated action difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government also had no overview of Prussia's economic situation and its government ministers had little clout faced with the king's cabinet, where they had less power than the king's private political councillors.

===Bureaucracy and leadership===
The start of the Stein era saw the unification of the Prussian state, with the old system of cabinets being abolished. A ministry of state (''Staatsministerium'') was introduced on 16 December 1808 in place of a top-level administration poorly defined as the ''Generaldirektorium''. This reform was completed in 1810. Now the administration was ruled according to the principle of portfolios. The ''Staatsministerium'' included five major ministries – minister of the interior, minister for foreign affairs, minister for finances, minister for justice and minister of war, all responsible to the king alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; These modifications could not take full effect, however, until a more effective statist model of leadership was created. This was done by replacing Prussian absolutism with a double domination of king and bureaucracy, in which the ministers had an important role, reducing the king's influence and meaning he could now only reign through his ministers' actions. In Stein's era, the ''Staatsministerium'' was organised in a collegiate way without a prime minister – that post was set up under Hardenberg, who received the title of ''Staatskanzler'' or State Chancellor in June 1810&lt;ref name="harvp|Büsch|1992|p=287"/&gt; along with control over the ministers' relations with the king.

The role of the head of state was also considerably modified. From 1808, Prussia was divided into districts. The different governments of these districts were set up according to the principle of portfolios, as with the national ministers of state. Each region was given an ''[[Oberpräsident]]'' for the first time, directly subordinate to the national ministers and with the role of stimulating public affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their rôle, which even went as far as putting up sanitary cordons in the event of an epidemic, was similar to that of French [[prefect (France)|prefect]]s – that is, to represent regional interests to the central government. The post was abolished in 1810 but revived in 1815 to play an important part in political life. It was in this context that justice and administration were separated once and for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Botzenhart|1985|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the establishment of administrative acts, the people concerned thus had a right of appeal. Nevertheless, there was no judicial control on the administration. Aiming to reduce any influence on the administration, this was reinforced by different administrative acts. The organisation that the reformers put in place served as a model for other German states and to major businesses.

===National representation===
[[File:Friedrich-August-Ludwig-von-der-Marwitz-1777-1837.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich August von der Marwitz]] was one of the representatives of the aristocratic opposition.]]
In parallel to the ''Staatsministerium'', Stein planned the creation of a ''Staatsrat'' or [[Privy Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he had had no opportunity to set up a correctly functioning one by 1808 and it was Hardenberg who set it up in 1810. The text of the relevant law stated: {{Cquote|We ordain a Council of State and by edict give our orders and our decisions on one side in this upper chamber and on the other side in our cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The members of the Council of State had to be current ministers or former ministers, high-level civil servants, princes of the royal house or figures nominated by the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|pp=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; A commission was also formed to function as a kind of parliament, with major legislative rights. As a bastion of the bureaucracy, the Council of State had to prevent any return to absolutism or any moves to reinforce the interests of the [[Ancien Régime]]. The Council of State also had to [[subrogation|subroge]] all laws and administrative and constitutional procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way as the towns' self-government, Hardenberg foresaw the establishment of a national representative body made up of [[Imperial State|corporative]] and representative elements. The first assembly of notable figures was held in 1811 and the second in 1812. These were made up of a corporative base of 18 aristocratic landowners, 12 urban property owners and nine representatives from among the peasants. This corporative composition was based partly on the traditional conception of society and partly on practical and fiscal considerations&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=461}}&lt;/ref&gt; – in order to be able to pay its war indemnities to France, the Prussian state had to have massive recourse to credit contracts issued by the aristocrats and to gain credit in foreign countries the different states had to offer themselves as guarantors.

After the summoning of the provisional assemblies, it quickly became clear that their deputies' first priority was not the state's interests but more defending their own classes' interests. The nobility saw the reforms as trying to reduce their privileges and so blocked them in the assemblies, led by figures such as [[Friedrich August von der Marwitz]] and Friedrich Ludwig Karl Fink von Finkenstein. Their resistance went so far that the cabinet even resorted to imprisoning them at [[Spandau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bussiek|2002|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Reinhart Koselleck]] has argued that the establishment of a corporative national representative body prevented all later reforms. At the end of the reforming period, the districts and the provincial representative bodies (such as the ''Provinziallandtage'') remained based on corporative principles. Prussia was prevented from forming a true representative national body, with considerable consequences on the internal development of Prussia and the [[German Confederation]]. Thus, while the states of the Confederation of the Rhine located in southern Germany became constitutional states, Prussia remained without a parliament until 1848.&lt;ref name="harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=113"&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reform of the towns===
[[File:Stadtverordnete1808.jpg|thumb|upright|Religious service for the first Prussian municipal councillors in 1808 in Berlin]]
Prior to the reforms the Prussian towns east of the [[river Elbe]] were under the state's direct control, with any surviving instances of self-government retaining their names and forms but none of their power. Stein's reform of the towns used this former tradition of self-government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; All rights specific to a certain city were abolished and all the cities put under the same structures and rule – this even came to be the case for their courts and police. Self-government was at the centre of the town reforms of 1808, with the towns now no longer subject to the state and their citizens given a duty to participate in the towns' political life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the strongest indication of Stein's rejection of a centralised bureaucracy – self-government had to awaken its citizens' interest in public affairs in order to benefit the whole Prussian state.

The ''Städteordnung'' (Municipal Ordinance) of 1808 defined a citizen (or at least a citizen in the sense of the inhabitant of a town or city) as "a citizen or member of an urban community which possesses the right of citizenship in a town".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; The municipal councillors were representatives of the town and not of an order or [[Three Estates|estate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; These councillors could be elected by all landowning citizens with a taxable revenue of at least 15 [[Thaler|taler]]. A councillor's main task was to participate in the election of a municipal council or ''Magistrat'', headed by a mayor. The election of the mayor and the members of the council had to be ratified by the central government. Different officials were put in place to carry out administrative portfolios. The council managed the municipal budget and the town also managed its own police.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite some democratic elements, the town administrations retained large corporative elements – the groups were differentiated according to their estates and only citizens had full rights. Only landowners and industrial property-owners had a right to citizenship, though it was in principle also open to other people, such as ''Eximierten'' (bourgeois people, mostly those in state service) or ''Schutzverwandten'' (members of the lower classes without full citizenship rights). The costs linked to a citizen's [[octroi]] dissuaded many people. It was only the new reform of 1831 which replaced the 1808 assemblies of ''Bürger'' (citizens) with assemblies of inhabitants. Until the [[Vormärz]], self-government in the towns was in the hands of artisans and established businessmen. In the cities and large towns, the citizens with full rights and their families represented around a third of the total population. Resistance by the nobility prevented these reforms from also being set up in the countryside.&lt;ref name="harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=113"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|pp=38–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reforms were a step towards modern civic self-government.

===Customs and tax reforms===
Tax reform was a central problem for the reformers, notably due to the war indemnities imposed by Napoleon, and these difficulties marked Hardenberg's early reforms. He managed to avoid state bankruptcy&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Müller-Osten|2007|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; and inflation by increasing taxes or selling off lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; These severe financial problems led to a wholesale fiscal reform. Taxes were standardised right across Prussia, principally by replacing the wide variety of minor taxes with main taxes. The reformers also tried to introduce equal taxation for all citizens, thus bringing them into conflict with aristocratic privileges. On 27 October 1810, the king proclaimed in his ''Finanzedikt'':{{cquote|We find we need to ask all our faithful subjects to pay increased taxes, mainly in the taxes on consumer goods and deluxe objects, though these will be simplified and charged on fewer articles, associated with the raising of complementary taxes and [[excise]]s all as heavier taxes. These taxes will be borne in a proportional manner by all the classes of the nation and will be reduced as soon as the unfortunate need disappears.{{#tag:ref|"Wir sehen Uns genöthigt, von Unsern getreuen Unterthanen die Entrichtung erhöhter Abgaben, hauptsächlich von der Konsumtion und von Gegenständen des Luxus zu fordern, die aber vereinfacht, auf weniger Artikel zurückgebracht, mit Abstellung der Nachschüsse und der Thoraccisen, so wie mehrerer einzelner lästigen Abgaben, verknüpft und von allen Klassen der Nation verhältnißmäßig gleich getragen, und gemindert werden sollen, sobald das damit zu bestreitende Bedürfniß aufhören wird."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}}}
Excises were raised the following year on appeals.&lt;ref name="p118"&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1819, excise (originally only raised by the towns) was suppressed and replaced with a tax on the consumption of beer, wine, gin and tobacco.&lt;ref name="p28"&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the industrial sphere, several taxes were replaced with a progressively spread-out professional tax. Other innovations were an income tax and a tax on wealth based on a tax evaluation carried out by the taxpayer. 1820 saw protests against a tax on classes, the tax being defined by the taxpayer's position in society.&lt;ref name="p28" /&gt; This tax on classes was an intermediate form between [[Tax per head|poll tax]] and income tax. The towns had the possibility of retaining the tax on cattle and cereal crops. The results for fiscal policy remain controversial. The nobility was not affected by the taxes as the reformers had originally planned, so much so that they did not managed to put in place a 'foncier' tax also including the nobility. The poorest suffered most as a result of these measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zollvereinpreussen.jpeg|thumb|One of the forerunners of the ''Zollverein'' was [[Wilhelm Anton von Klewitz]], Prussian Minister of Finances.]]
It was only after the end of the Napoleonic Wars and after the territorial reorganisation of Europe at the [[Congress of Vienna]] that Prussia's customs duties were reformed. At the Congress Prussia regained its western territories, leading to economic competition between the industrialised part of these territories such as the [[Rhine Province]], the [[Province of Westphalia]] and the territories in Saxony on the one hand and the essentially agricultural territories to the east of the Elbe on the other. Customs policy was also very disparate.&lt;ref name="p118" /&gt; Thus, in 1817, there were 57 customs tariffs on 3,000 goods passing from the historic western territories to the Prussian heartland, with the taxes in the heartland not yet having spread to the formerly French-dominated western provinces.

This was one of the factors that made customs reform vital. That reform occurred on 26 May 1818, with the establishment of a compromise between the interest of the major landowners practicing free-exchange and those of the still-weak industrial economy asking for [[protectionism|protectionist]] custom duties. They therefore only took on what would now be called a tax for protecting internal markets from foreign competition and customs duties for haulage were lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mercantile policy instituted by Frederick II thus came to an end. Export bans were lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Reihlen|1988|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The customs laws and duties put in place by the reformers proved so simple and effective over time that they served as a model for taxation in other German states for around fifty years and that their basic principles remained in place under the [[German Empire]]. The Prussian customs policy was one of the important factors in the creation of the [[Zollverein|Deutscher Zollverein]] in the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fischer|1972|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wehler|1987|pp=442–445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and politics==

===Agricultural reforms===
Agriculture was reformed across Europe at this time, though in different ways and in different phases. The usefulness of existing agricultural methods came into doubt and so the [[Ancien Régime]]'s and [[Holy Roman Empire]]'s agricultural structures were abolished. Peasants were freed and became landowners; and services and [[corvée]]s were abolished. Private landownership also led to the breakdown of [[common land]]s – that is, to the usage of woods and meadows 'in common'. These communal lands were mostly given to lords in return for lands acquired by the peasants. Some meadow{{what|date=May 2018}} reforms had already taken place in some parts of Prussia before 1806, such as the freeing of the peasants on royal lands in the 18th century, though this freeing only fully came into force in 1807.

The landowning nobility successfully managed to oppose similar changes. The government had to confront aristocratic resistance even to the pre-1806 reforms, which became considerable. The ''Gesindeordnung'' of 1810 was certainly notable progress for servants compared to that proposed in the ''Allgemeines Landrecht'', but still remained conservative and favourable to the nobility. The nobility's opposition to this also led to several privileges being saved from abolition. The rights of the police and the courts were controlled more strongly by the state, but not totally abolished like religious and scholarly patrongage, hunting rights and fiscal privileges. Unlike the reforms in the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], the nobles were not asked to justify their rank. The reformers made compromises, but the nobility were unable to block the major changes brought by the reforms' central points.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|pp=40–43, 47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wehler|1987|p=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Edict of October 1807====
[[File:Oktoberedikt.jpg|thumb|upright|Frontispiece of the October 1807 edict.]]
The freeing of the peasants marked the start of the Prussian reforms. The kingdom's modernisation began by modernising its base, that is, its peasants and its agriculture. At the start of the 19th century, 80% of the German population lived in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Botzenhart|1985|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The edict of 9 October 1807, one of the central reforms, liberated the peasants and was signed only five days after Stein's appointment on von Schön's suggestion. The October edict began the process of abolishing [[serfdom]] and its hereditary character. The first peasants to be freed were those working on the domains in the ''Reichsritter'' and on 11 November 1810 at the latest, all the Prussian serfs were declared free:&lt;ref name="p51"&gt;{{harvp|Botzenhart|1985|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Cquote|On [[St Martin's Day]] 1810 all servitude ended throughout our states. After St Martin's Day 1810, there would be nothing but free people as was already the case over our domains in our provinces[...].{{#tag:ref|"Mit dem Martini-Tage Eintausend Achthundert und Zehn (1810.) hört alle Guts-Unterthänigkeit in Unsern sämmtlichen Staaten auf. Nach dem Martini-Tage 1810. giebt es nur freie Leute, so wie solches auf den Domainen in allen Unsern Provinzen schon der Fall ist [...]"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}}} However, though serfdom was abolished, [[corvée]]s were not – the October edict said nothing on the latter subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The October edict authorised all Prussian citizens to acquire property and choose their profession, including the nobles, who until then could not take on jobs reserved for the bourgeoisie: {{Cquote|Any nobleman is authorised, without prejudice to its estate, to take up a bourgeois job ; and any bourgeois or peasant is authorised to join the bourgeoisie in the case of the peasant or the peasantry in the case of the bourgeois.{{#tag:ref|"Jeder Edelmann ist, ohne allen Nachtheil seines Standes, befugt, bürgerliche Gewerbe zu treiben; und jeder Bürger oder Bauer ist berechtigt, aus dem Bauer- in den Bürger und aus dem Bürger- in den Bauerstand zu treten"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}}} The principle of "[[dérogeance]]" disappeared.

The peasants were allowed to travel freely and set up home in the towns and no longer had to buy their freedom or pay for its with domestic service. The peasants no longer had to ask their lord's permission to marry – this freedom in marriage led to a rising birth rate and population in the countryside. The freeing of the peasants, however, was also to their disadvantage – lordly domains were liberalised and major landowners were allowed to buy peasants' farms (the latter practice having been illegal previously). The lords no longer had an obligation to provide housing for any of their former serfs who became invalids or too old to work. This all led to the formation of an economic class made up of bourgeois and noble entrepreneurs who opposed the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Edict of regulation (1811)====
After the reformers freed the peasants, they were faced with other problems, such as the abolition of corvées and the establishment of properties. According to the ''Allgemeines Landrecht'', these problems could only be solved by compensating the financiers. The need to legally put in place a "revolution from above" slowed down the reforms.

The edict of regulation of 1811 solved the problem by making all peasants the owners of the farms they farmed. In place of buying back these lands (which was financially impossible), the peasants were obliged to compensate their former lords by handing over between a third and a half of the farmed lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=337}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid splitting up the lands and leaving areas that were too small to viably farm, in 1816 the buy-back of these lands was limited to major landowners. The smaller ones remained excluded from [[allodial title]].&lt;ref name="p117f"&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other duties linked to serfdom, such as that to provide domestic service and the payment of authorisation taxes on getting married, were abolished without compensation. As for corvées and services in kind, the peasants had to buy back from their lords for 25% of their value.

[[File:Baranowen-1850.jpg|thumb|Estate of Baranowen]]
The practical compensations in Prussia were without doubt{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} advantageous compared to the reforms put in place in the states of the Confederation of the Rhine. In effect, they allowed the process of reform to be accelerated. Nevertheless, the 12,000 lordly estates in Prussia saw their area increase to reach around 1.5 million Morgen&lt;ref name="p118f"&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; (around 38,000 hectares), mostly made up of common lands, of which only 14% returned to the peasants, with the rest going to the lords. Many of the minor peasants thus lost their means of subsistence and most could only sell their indebted lands to their lords and become agricultural workers.&lt;ref name="p94"&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[set-aside|jachère]] lands were made farmable, but their cultivation remained questionable due to their poor soil quality. The measures put in place by the reformers did have some financial success, however, with Prussia's cultivated land rising from 7.3 to 12.46 million hectares in 1848&lt;ref name="p94" /&gt; and production raised by 40%.&lt;ref name="p117f" /&gt;

In the territories east of the Elbe, the agricultural reforms had major social consequences. Due to the growth of lordly estates,&lt;ref name="p118f" /&gt; the number of lordly families rose greatly, right up until the second half of the 19th century. The number of exploited lands remained the same. A very important lower social class was also created. According to region and the rights in force, the number of agricultural day workers and servants rose 2.5 times. The number of minor landowners, known as ''Kätner'' after their homes (known as ''Kotten''), tripled or even quadrupled. Many of them were dependent on another job. Ernst Rudolf Huber, professor of public law, judged that the agricultural reforms were {{Cquote|one of the tragic ironies of German constitutional history. Through it was shown the internal contradiction of the bourgeois liberalism which created the liberty of the individual and his property and at the same time – due to its own law of the liberty of property – unleashed the accumulation of power in the hands of some people.&lt;ref name="harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=119"&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Reform of industry and its results===
[[File:Schneider wappen.jpg|thumb|upright|Arms of the tailors' guild – like the other guilds, it lost its influence due to the ''Gewerbefreiheit''.]]
The reformers aspired to free individual forces in the industrial sphere just as in the agricultural one, in their devotion to the theories of Adam Smith. To free these forces, they had to get rid of guilds and an economic policy based on mercantilism. To encourage free competition also meant the suppression of all limitations on competition.

It was in this context that the freedom of industry (''Gewerbefreiheit'') was introduced in 1810–1811.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; To set up an industry, one had to acquire a licence, but even so there were exceptions, such as doctors, pharmacists and hotelliers. The guilds lost their monopoly role and their economic privileges. They were not abolished, but membership of them was now voluntary, not compulsory as it had been in the past. State control over the economy also disappeared, to give way to a free choice of profession and free competition. The reform of industry unlocked the economy and gave it a new impetus. There was no longer any legal difference in the industrial sphere between the town and the countryside. Only mining remained as an exception until the 1860s.

Originally planned to encourage rural industry, the freedom of industry became the central condition for Prussian economic renewal on an industrial base. As had happened with the nobility, the citizens of the towns arose unsuccessfully opposed the reforms. Their immediate results were contradictory—early on, non-guild competition was weak, but after a period of adaptation the number of non-guild artisans rose significantly. However, in the countryside, the burdens of the artisans and other industries rose considerably. This rise in the number of artisans was not accompanied by a similar growth in the rest of the population.&lt;ref name="harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=119"&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of master-craftsmen rose too, but master-craftsmen remained poor due to the strong competition. During the [[Vormärz]], tailors, cobblers, carpenters and weavers were the main over-subscribed trades. The rise in the lower classes in the countryside accentuated the 'social question and would be one of the causes of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 Revolution]].&lt;ref name="harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=119"&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wehler|1987|pp=429–432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish emancipation===
{{further|Jewish emancipation|Disabilities (Jewish)}}
By the Edict of Emancipation of 11 March 1812, Jews [[Jewish emancipation|gained the same rights and duties]] as other citizens:
{{Cquote|We, Frederick William, King of Prussia by the Grace of God, etc. etc., having decided to establish a new constitution conforming to the public good of Jewish believers living in [[Royal we|our]] Kingdom, proclaim all the former laws and prescriptions not confirmed in this present Edict to be abrogated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} To gain civil rights, all Jews had to declare themselves to the police within six months of the promulgation of the edict and choose a definitive name.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Edict was the result of a long reflection since 1781, begun by [[Christian Wilhelm von Dohm]], pursued by [[David Friedländer]] in a thesis to Frederick William II in 1787 (Friedländer approved the Edict of 1812&lt;ref&gt;Jean Mondot, "L'émancipation des Juifs en Allemagne entre 1789 et 1815", in {{harvp|Knopper|Mondot|2008|p=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Humboldt's influence allowed for the so-called "[[Jewish question]]" to be re-examined.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Mondot, "L'émancipation des Juifs en Allemagne entre 1789 et 1815", in {{harvp|Knopper|Mondot|2008|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 8 of the Edict allowed Jews to own land and take up municipal and university posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews were free to practise their religion and their traditions were protected. Nevertheless, unlike the reforms in the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], the Edict of Emancipation in Prussia [[Disabilities (Jewish)|did have some limitations]] – Jews could not become army officers or have any government or legal role, but were still required to do military service.

Even if some traditionalists opposed the Edict of Emancipation&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=460}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it proved a major step towards Jewish emancipation in the [[German states]] during the 19th century. The judicial situation in Prussia was significantly better than that in most of southern and eastern Germany, making it an attractive destination for Jewish immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wehler|1987|p=408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other areas==

===Education===

====New organisation====
[[File:Reiterstandbild Wilhelm III Sockelfig Koeln2007 Humboldt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] wished to reform Prussia's school and university system.]]
For the reformers, the reform of the [[Prussian education system]] (''Bildung'') was a key reform. All the other reforms relied on creating a new type of citizen who had to be capable of proving themselves responsible and the reformers were convinced that the nation had to be educated and made to grow up. Unlike the state reforms, which still contained corporative elements, the ''Bildungsreform'' was conceived outside all class structures. [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] was the main figure behind the educational reform. From 1808, he was in charge of the department of religion and education within the ministry of the interior. Like Stein, Humboldt was only in his post for a short time, but was able to put in place the main elements of his reforms.

Humboldt developed his ideas in July 1809 in his treatise ''Über die mit dem Königsberger Schulwesen vorzunehmende Reformen'' (''On reforms to execute with the teaching in Königsberg''). In place of a wide variety of religious, private, municipal and corporative educational institutions, he suggested setting up a school system divided into ''Volksschule'' (people's schools), ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]s'' and universities. Humboldt defined the characteristics of each stage in education. Elementary teaching "truly only need be occupied with language, numbers and measures, and remain linked to the mother tongue being given that nature is indifferent in its design".{{#tag:ref|"Er hat es also eigentlich nur mit Sprach-, Zahl- und Mass-Verhältnissen zu thun, und bleibt, da ihm die Art des Bezeichneten gleichgültig ist, bei der Muttersprache stehen."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} For the second stage, that of being taught in school, Humboldt wrote "The aim of being taught in school is to exercise [a pupil's] ability and to acquire knowledge without which scientific understanding and ability are impossible.{{#tag:ref|"Der Zweck des Schulunterrichts ist die Uebung der Fähigkeit, und die Erwerbung der Kenntnisse, ohne welche wissenschaftliche Einsicht und Kunstfertigkeit unmöglich ist."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Finally, he stated that university had to train a student in research and allow him to understanding "the unity of science".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=365}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1812, a university entry had to obtain the ''[[Abitur]]''. The state controlled all the schools, but even so it strictly imposed compulsory education and controlled exams. To enter the civil service, performance criteria were set up. Education and performance replaced social origin.

====New humanism====
[[File:Wilhelm von Humboldt Denkmal - Humboldt Universität zu Berlin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of Humboldt in front of the [[Humboldt University]] in Berlin (1882)]]
Wilhelm von Humboldt backed a new [[humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the utilitarian teaching of the Enlightenment, which wished to transmit useful knowledge for practical life, Humboldt desired a general formation of man. From then students had to study antiquity and ancient languages to develop themselves intellectually.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=368}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only would they acquire this humanistic knowledge, they would also acquire other knowledge necessary for other jobs. The state would not seek to form citizens at all costs to serve it, but it did not entirely let go of that aim:
{{Cquote|Each [student] who does not give evidence of becoming a good artisan, businessman, soldier, politician is still a man and a good citizen, honest, clear according to his rank without taking account of his own job. Give him the necessary training and he will acquire the particular capacity for his job very easily and always hold onto liberty, as is the case so often in life, going from one to the other.{{#tag:ref|"Jeder ist offenbar nur dann ein guter Handwerker, Kaufmann, Soldat und Geschäftsmann, wenn er an sich und ohne Hinsicht auf seinen besonderen Beruf ein guter, anständiger, seinem Stande nach aufgeklärter Mensch und Bürger ist. Gibt ihm der Schulunterricht, was hierzu erforderlich ist, so erwirbt er die besondere Fähigkeit seines Berufs nachher sehr leicht und behält immer die Freiheit, wie im Leben so oft geschieht, von einem zum anderen überzugehen"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Giesecke|1991|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}}} Unlike Humboldt, for whom the individual was at the centre of the educational process, the republican [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] rather leaned towards national education to educate the whole people and thus to affirm the nation in the face of Napoleonic domination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In paying professors better and improving their training, the quality of teaching in the ''Volksschule''s was improved. The newly founded ''gymnasia'' offered a humanist education to ready pupils for university studies. In parallel ''Realschule''s were set up&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Büsch|1992|p=661}}&lt;/ref&gt; to train men in manual trades. Some schools for officer cadets were allowed to remain. Despite stricter state influence and control, the religious authorities retained their role in inspecting schools.

====Universities====
[[File:Berlin Universitaet um 1850.jpg|thumb|Berlin University around 1850.]]
In Humboldt's thinking, university represented the crowning glory of intellectual education and the expression of the ideal of freedom between teaching and research held an important place in it. German universities of the time were mostly mediocre.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=382}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Humboldt, "the state must treat its universities neither as gymnasia nor as specialist schools and must not serve its Academy as a technical or scientific deputation. Together, they must [...] demand nothing of them which does not give it profit immediately and simply".{{#tag:ref|"Der Staat muss seine Universittendäten weder als Gymnasien noch als Specialschulen behandeln, und sich seiner Akademie nicht als technischen oder wissenschaftlichen Deputation bedienen. Er muss im Ganzen [...] von ihnen nichts fordern, was sich unmittelbar und geradezu auf ihn bezieht."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

Students, in his view, had to learn to think autonomously and work in a scientific way by taking part in research. The foundation of [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin University]] served as a model. It was opened in 1810 and the great men of the era taught there – [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], the physician [[Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland]], the historian [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]] and the jurist [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the educational reforms' results were different from what Humboldt had expected. Putting in place his ideal of [[philology|philological]] education excluded the lower classes of society and allied the educational system to the restorationist tendencies. The major cost of education rendered the reforms in this area ineffective. The reformers had hoped that people would rise through the social scale thanks to education, but this did not happen so well as they had hoped.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|pp=120–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military===
[[File:Berlin Scharnhorst memorial.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]] in Berlin (1822)]]
[[File:Reorganisation.jpg|thumb|Commission for military reorganisation at [[Königsberg]] in 1807. The two men in the foreground are [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau|Gneisenau]] and [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]], with the seated person in civilian dress is [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom Stein|Stein]].]]
Unlike the reforms in the states of the Confederation of the Rhine, the Prussian policy was aimed against French supremacy right from the start. Also, the Prussian military reforms were much more profound than those in the south German states. They were instigated by a group of officers which had formed after the defeats of 1806 and notably included [[Gerhard Johann David von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]], [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau|Gneisenau]], [[Hermann von Boyen|Boyen]], [[Karl von Grolman|Grolman]] and [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]].&lt;ref name="p28"/&gt;

Chief of staff since 1806, Scharnhorst became head of the military reorganisation commission set up by Frederick William III in July 1807. For him, every citizen was a born defender of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Abenheim|1987|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; His main aim was to drive out the French occupiers. In close contact with Stein, Scharnhorst managed to convince the king that the military needed reform. Like the civil administration, the military organisation was simplified, via the creation of a Prussian ministry of war and of an army staff on 25 December 1808.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Millotat|2000|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scharnhorst was at the head of the new ministry and he aimed his reforms at removing the obstacles between army and society and at making the army ground itself in the citizens' patriotism.

====Military service====
[[File:Sommerschenburg Gneisenau.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial to Gneisenau in Sommersdorf-Sommerschenburg (1835)]]
The experiences of 1806 showed that the old organisation of the Prussian army was no longer a match for the might of the French army. Compared to the French defensive tactics, Prussian tactics were too immobile. Its officers treated their soldiers as objects and punished them severely&lt;ref name="p453" /&gt; – one of the most severe punishments, the ''Spießrutenlaufen'', consisted of making a soldier pass between two ranks of men and be beaten by them. The French instead had compulsory military service and the Prussian army's adoption of it was the centre of Prussia's military reforms.

[[File:Gneisenaustatue.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Statue of Gneisenau in Berlin (1855)]]
Frederick William III hesitated about the military reforms, the officer corps and nobility resisted them and even the bourgeoisie remained sceptical. The start of the [[German campaign of 1813]] was the key factor. On 9 February 1813 a decree replaced the previous conscription system with an obligation to serve by canton ''Kantonpflichtigkeit''),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=392}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this new system had to last for the whole war. Thus it looked to restore the pride and position of the common soldier in adapting army discipline to civil law. The punishments and in particular the 'schlague' (consisting of a soldier being beaten) were abolished. The social differences had to disappear. The Treaty of Tilsit had reduced the Prussian army to 42,000 men, but Scharnhorst put in place the "Krümper system",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lange|1857|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consisted of training a number of soldiers by making them turn without ever exceeding the numbers authorised by the Treaty. Between 30,000 and 150,000 supplementary men were also trained – the training system changed several times and so it is difficult to work out precise numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Neugebauer|Busch|2006|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsory military service was ordered by Frederick William III on 27 May 1814 then fixed by a military law on 3 September the same year:{{Cquote|Every man of 20 years is obliged to defend the fatherland. To execute this general obligation, particularly in time of peace, in such manner that the progress of science and industry will not be disturbed, the following exclusion must be applied in taking into account the terms of service and the duration of service.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=393}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Other====
The officer corps was also reformed and several officers dismissed.&lt;ref name="rovan459"&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=459}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nobility's privilege was abolished and a career as an officer was opened up to the bourgeois. The aristocrats disliked this and protested, as with [[Hans David Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg|Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg]]. In practice a system of co-opting of officers was put in place which gave generally favoured nobles, even if there remained some (albeit minor) bourgeois influence. Starting with the regiment of chasseurs on campaign, chasseur and protection units were set up.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gumtau|1837|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was [[Hans David Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg|Yorck von Wartenburg]] who from June 1808 occupied on their training.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Neugebauer|Busch|2006|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the officer corps, it was now the terms of service not the number of years served which determined promotion. The Prussian Academy of War also provided better officer training than before – dissolved after the defeat at Jena, it had been refounded in 1810 by Scharnhorst.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Millotat|2000|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1813–1814&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Braeuner|1863|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the line infantry troops, we also see the [[Landwehr]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=397}}&lt;/ref&gt; which served as reserve troops to defend Prussia itself. It was independent in organisation and had its own units and its own officers. In the ''Kreise'' (districts), commissions organised troops in which the bourgeois could become officers. The reformers' idea of unifying the people and the army seems to have succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nipperdey|1998|pp=50–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteer chasseur detachments (''freiwillige Jägerdetachements'') were also formed as reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Neugebauer|Busch|2006|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main leaders==
[[File:Reiterstandbild Wilhelm III Sockelfig Koeln2007vonSchon.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Theodor von Schön]]]]
The reforms are sometimes named after their leaders Stein and Hardenberg, but they were also the fruit of a collaboration between experts, each with his own speciality. One of these experts was [[Heinrich Theodor von Schön]] – born in 1773, he had studied law at Königsberg university to follow a career in political sciences. In 1793 he entered Prussian service.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roloff|1997|p=787}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine years later, he became financial councillor to the ''Generaldirektorium''. When the Prussian government fled to [[Königsberg]] after its defeat at Jena, he followed Stein there. It was there that he brought to bear his expertise on [[serfdom]] and it was his treatise that would help Stein write the October edict. Unlike Stein, Schön backed a greater liberalisation of landowning – for him, economic profitability had to take first priority, even if this was to the peasants' disadvantage.&lt;ref name="klein"&gt;{{harvp|Klein|1965|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1816, Schön became ''Oberpräsident'', a post he held for around 40 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rovan|1999|p=457}}&lt;/ref&gt; and devoted himself to the economic and social life of the provinces which he governed.&lt;ref name="klein" /&gt;

Schön also took part in editing the ''Rigaer Denkschrift''. In 1806 he travelled with a group of civil servants that had gathered around the just-dismissed Hardenberg – the group also included [[Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein]], [[Friedrich August von Stägemann]] and [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hensler|Twesten|1838|p=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niebuhr had studied law, philosophy and history at the university of Kiel between 1794 and 1796. In 1804 he was made head of the Danish national bank. His reputation as a financial expert quickly spread to Prussia. On 19 June 1806, Niebuhr and his family left for Riga with other civil servants to work with Hardenberg when he was dismissed. On 11 December 1809, he was made financial councillor and section chief for state debt. In 1810, he edited a note to the king in which he expressed strong doubts on whether a financial plan put in place by Hardenberg could be realised. Its tone he employed was so strong that the king disavowed him&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hensler|Twesten|1838|p=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so Niebuhr retired from politics.

The three other civil servants present at Riga – [[Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein]], [[Wilhelm Anton von Klewitz]] and [[Friedrich August von Stägemann]] – also played important rôles in the reforms. Altenstein became high financial councillor in the ''Generaldirektorium''. When Stein was dismissed in 1807, Altenstein and the minister of finances [[Friedrich Ferdinand Alexander zu Dohna-Schlobitten]] put in place the state reform conceived by Stein.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1810, Klewitz and Theodor von Schön edited the ''Verordnung über die veränderte Staatsverfassung aller obersten Staatsbehörden'' (''Decree on the new constitution of all the high portfolios of state''). Other collaborators took part in the reforms, such as Johann Gottfried Frey (chief of police in [[Königsberg]] and the real author of the ''Städteordnung''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schüler-Springorum|1996|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Friedrich Leopold Reichsfreiherr von Schrötter (who collaborated with Stein on the ''Städteordnung''), [[Christian Peter Wilhelm Beuth]] (in Prussian service since 1801, who had collaborated with Hardenberg on the fiscal and industrial laws) and Christian Friedrich Scharnweber (who had some influence on Hardenberg&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Vogel|1980|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Resurgence of Prussia==
[[File:An Mein Volk.jpg|thumb|upright|[[An Mein Volk]] – the Prussian king's appeal to his people on 17 March 1813]]
{{See also|German campaign (Napoleonic Wars)}}
From 1806 onwards isolated uprisings occurred in Germany and the German-speaking countries. On 26 August 1806 the bookseller [[Johann Philipp Palm]] was shot for publishing an anti-Napoleon pamphlet,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Radrizzani|2002|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a strong public outcry. In 1809, [[Andreas Hofer]] launched an insurrection in the Tyrol, but met the same fate as Palm. Anti-Napoleonic feeling developed little by little, with Germans feeling their spirits weighed down by the French occupation and Prussia still paying huge indemnities to the French. When Napoleon's 1812 [[French invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]] met with disaster, it lit a glimmer of hope in Germany and above all in Prussia. On 30 December 1812, [[Hans David Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg|Yorck von Wartenburg]] signed the [[convention of Tauroggen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which Prussia in effect turned against Napoleon and repudiated the Treaty of Tilsit.

On 13 March 1813 Frederick William III made his '[[An Mein Volk]]' speech, making an appeal:
{{Cquote|To my people! ... Brandenburgers, Prussians, Silesians, Pomeranians, Lithuanians! You know what you have endured for nearly seven years, you know what will be your sad fate if we do not end with honour the fight we have begun. Remember past times, the Great Elector, the great Frederick [II]. Keep in your minds the good things our ancestors won under his command: freedom of conscience, honour, independence, trade, industry and science. Keep in your minds the great example of our powerful Russian allies, keep in your mind the Spanish, the Portuguese, even the lesser people who have declared war on powerful enemies to win the same good things and have gained victory [...] Great sacrifices are demanded of all classes, for our beginning is great and the numbers and resources of our enemies are great [...] But whatever the sacrifices demanded of the individual, they pale beside the holy goods for which we make them, for the things for which we fight and must win if we do not wish to stop being Prussians and Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Demel|Puschner|1995|p=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The following 27 March Prussia declared war on France and the following 16–19 October saw the beginning of the end for Napoleonic power with the [[battle of Leipzig]]. On 1 October 1815 the Congress of Vienna opened and at it Harbenberg represented the victorious Kingdom of Prussia.

==Historiography==

===Early analyses===
[[File:Heinrich von Treitschke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Heinrich von Treitschke]] long influenced the positive perception of the Prussian reforms from the 19th to the 20th century.]]
In late 19th century historiography, the Prussian reforms and the "revolution from above" were considered by [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] and others to be the first step in the foundation of the German Empire on the basis of a 'small-Germany' solution. For [[Friedrich Meinecke]], the reforms put in place the conditions necessary for the future evolution of Prussia and Germany. For a long time, under the influence of [[Leopold von Ranke]], the era of reforms was presented first and foremost as a story of the deeds and destinies of "great men", as shown by the large number of biographies written about the reformers – [[Hans Delbrück]] wrote about Gneisenau and Meinecke about Boyen, for example.

Indeed, it was the military reforms which first gained the researchers' interest. It was only with the biography of [[Max Lehmann]] that Stein's life and actions were analysed. Unlike Stein, the biographers paid little attention to Hardenberg. Despite the significant differences between Stein and Hardenberg, historiography saw a fundamental continuity between their approaches that made them one single unified policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|pp=235–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors, such as [[Otto Hintze]], underlined the role of reform programmes such as the ''Allgemeines Landrecht'' of 1794. One such continuity confirmed the theory that the reformers were already a distinct group before the reforms occurred. [[Thomas Nipperdey]] resumed the debate by writing that there had been reform plans before the disaster of 1806, but that those behind them had lacked the energy to put them into force and also lacked internal cohesion.&lt;ref name="Nipperdey_33"/&gt; As for the agricultural reforms, the works of Georg Friedrich Knapp aroused a controversy at the end of the 19th century – he criticised the reform policy, stating that it favoured the aristocrats' interests and not the peasants' interests. He held Adam Smith's liberal interest responsible for the evolution of certain problems. Research later led to a global critique which could not be maintained. After all, the peasants' properties were developed, even if the lands they gained were most often revealed to be poor soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|pp=239–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuances in criticism===
[[File:Gaertner2.jpg|thumb|upright|It was only in 1848 that a plan for a constitution was discussed in the Sing-Akademie.]]
Today, the industrial reforms' success is also critiqued in a more nuanced way. They are considered not to have been the immediate reason for the artisans' misery, instead taken as the reduced influence of the legislation on their development. The historian Barbara Vogel tried to address an overall concept of agricultural and industrial approaches and to describe them as a "bureaucratic strategy of modernisation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Vogel|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; When industrial development was taken into account, the policy of reforms is seen to certainly be centred on the encouragement of rural industry in the historic Prussian territories, thus allowing the onset of Prussia's [[industrial revolution]].

[[Reinhart Koselleck]] tried to give a general interpretation of the reform policy in view of the 1848 revolution, in his work ''Preußen zwischen Reform und Revolution'' (''Prussia between Reform and Revolution''). He distinguished three different processes. The ''Allgemeines Landrecht'' represented – at the time of its publication – a reaction to social problems, but remained attached to corporative elements. Koselleck saw the birth of an administrative state during the reform era and during the reinforcement of the administration between 1815 and 1825 as an anticipation of the later constitution. However, in his view, the following decades saw the political and social movement suppressed by the bureaucracy. After the end of the reform period, Koselleck underlined that there was a rupture in the equilibrium between the high level civil servants and the bourgeois of the 'Bildungsbürgertum' who could not become civil servants. According to him, the bureaucracy represented the general interest against the individual interest and no national representative body was set up for fear of seeing the reforming movement stopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Koselleck|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Standbild Heumarkt Köln - Gesamtansicht.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] in the [[Heumarkt]] in [[Cologne]], erected to the glory of Prussia – round its base are statues of the great Prussian reformers such as [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom Stein|Stein]], [[Karl August von Hardenberg|Hardenberg]], [[Heinrich Theodor von Schön|Schön]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldt]]]]
[[File:Standbild Heumarkt Köln 1869 W. Gause.jpg|thumb|upright|Cologne monument (1878)]]
The historian Hans Rosenberg and later the representatives of the Bielefeld School supported the theory that the end of the process which would have led to a constitution in Prussia was one of the reasons for the end to its democratisation and for the ''[[Sonderweg]]''. Hans-Jürgen Puhle, professor at Frankfurt University, even held the Prussian regime to be "in the long term programmed for its own destruction".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Puhle|1980|p=15}}, cited in {{harvp|Langewiesche|1994|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers more orientated towards [[historicism]] such as Thomas Nipperdey underlined the divergence between the reformers' intentions and the unexpected later results of the reforms.

Several decades ago, the Prussian reforms from 1807 to 1819 lost their central position in historical study of 19th-century Germany. One contributing factor to this decline is that the reforms in the states of the Confederation of the Rhine were considered as similar by several historians. Another is that the Prussian regions – dynamic in industry and society – belonged to the French sphere of influence directly or indirectly until the end of the [[First French Empire|Napoleonic era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fehrenbach|1986|pp=241–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials to the reformers==

===Statues===
Several statues of the reformers were set up, especially of Stein. In 1870 a statue of Stein by [[Hermann Schievelbein]] was put up on the [[Dönhoffplatz]] in Berlin. Around its base can be read "To minister Baron vom Stein. The recognition of the fatherland.".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stamm-Kuhlmann|2001|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statue of Hardenberg by Martin Götze was also put up beside it in 1907. Stein's statue now stands in front of the [[Landtag of Prussia]] in Berlin.

===Cologne memorial===
One of the most important monuments to the reformers is that in the Heumarkt in [[Cologne]], made up of an equestrian statue of Frederick William III by Gustav Blaeser on a base surrounded by statues of important figures of the era, including several Prussian reformers: Stein, Hardenberg, Gneisenau, Scharnhorst, Humboldt, Schön, Niebuhr and Beuth. The monument's design process had been launched in 1857&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Reihlen|1988|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was inaugurated on 26 September 1878, with a medal marking the occasion bearing [[William I of Germany]] and his wife on the obverse and the monument and the phrase "To king Frederick William III, the Rhine states recognise him" on the reverse. The monument recalled the Berlin [[equestrian statue of Frederick the Great]], designed by [[Christian Daniel Rauch]], master of Blaeser.

===Other===
Stein featured on commemorative stamps in 1957 and 2007 and Humboldt in 1952, whilst several streets are now named after the reformers, especially in Berlin, which has a Humboldtstraße, a Hardenbergstraße, a Freiherr-vom-Stein-Straße, a Niebuhrstraße, a Gneisenaustraße and a Scharnhorststraße.

A '''rump legislature''' is a [[legislature]] formed of part, usually a minority, of the legislators originally elected or appointed to office.

The word "[[Buttocks|rump]]" normally refers to the back end of an animal; its use meaning "remnant" was first recorded in the context of the 17th century [[Rump Parliament]] in [[England]]. Since 1649, the term "rump parliament" has been used to refer to any parliament left over after the true parliament has formally dissolved.

In the United States in the 19th century, upon the secession of [[Virginia]] from the union on April 27, 1861, anti-secessionist legislators convened a rump legislature and formed a pro-Union reformed government which claimed to represent all of Virginia. This reformed government authorized the creation of the state of [[State of Kanawha|Kanawha]], later renamed [[West Virginia]].

By contrast, the [[Legislative Yuan]] of [[Taiwan]] between 1951 and 1991, having been relocated from Nanking to Taipei when the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic of China]] lost its [[Chinese mainland]] in late 1949, contained members originally [[:Category:Members of the 1st Legislative Yuan in Taiwan|elected from mainland constituencies]] who could not be replaced. The pre-reform Legislative Yuan was nevertheless widely regarded as a rump legislature, controlling only a fraction of the territory it claimed to represent.

'''''SCO v. IBM''''' is a [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] [[lawsuit]] in the [[United States]] [[United States District Court for the District of Utah|District Court of Utah]]. The [[SCO Group]] asserted that there are legal uncertainties regarding  the use of the [[Linux]] operating system due to alleged violations of [[IBM]]'s [[Unix]] [[licenses]] in the development of [[Linux]] code at [[IBM]].  The lawsuit was filed in 2003, it has lingered on through the bankruptcy of [[SCO Group]] and the adverse result in ''[[SCO v. Novell]]'', and was reopened for continued litigation by order of a new judge on June 14, 2013.&lt;ref name=gl130615&gt;{{cite web|title=Ladies and Gentlemen, SCO v.

On March 1, 2016, following the judge in the case ruling against the last remaining claims, SCO's suit against IBM was dismissed with prejudice; SCO then filed an appeal later that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/staticpages/index.php?page=20031016162215566|title=Groklaw - SCO v. IBM Timeline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
On March 6, 2003, the [[SCO Group]] (formerly known as [[Caldera International]] and [[Caldera Systems]]) filed a $1 billion lawsuit in the United States against [[International Business Machines|IBM]] for allegedly "devaluing" its version of the UNIX operating system. SCO retained [[Boies Schiller &amp; Flexner]] for this, and related subsequent litigation. The amount of alleged damages was later increased to $3 billion, and then $5 billion. SCO claimed that IBM had, without authorization, contributed SCO's [[intellectual property]] to the codebase of the [[Open-source software|open source]], [[Unix-like]] Linux operating system. In May 2003, SCO Group sent letters to members of the [[Fortune 1000]] and [[Fortune Global 500|Global 500]] companies warning them of the possibility of liability if they use Linux.

The claims and counter-claims made by both sides then escalated, with both IBM and Linux distributor [[Red Hat]] starting legal action against SCO, SCO threatening Linux users who do not take out SCO UNIX [[license]]s, and SCO suing [[SCO v. Novell|Novell]] (see also [[SCO-Linux controversies]]), [[SCO v. AutoZone|AutoZone]] and [[SCO v. DaimlerChrysler|DaimlerChrysler]].

On September 30, 2003, Judge Kimball (the presiding federal [[United States district court#United States district judges|district judge]]) granted the SCO Group's request for a delay until February 4, 2004, "to file any amended pleadings or add parties to this action".  The schedule was amended again on July 1, 2005.  In December 2006 the trial date was vacated pending the resolution of SCO's litigation with Novell, all parties agreeing that ''[[SCO v. Novell]]'' would resolve issues relating to ''SCO v. IBM''.

In an "Order Granting in Part IBM's Motion to Limit SCO's Claims" dated June 28, 2006, Judge Brooke Wells (the [[United States magistrate judge|federal magistrate judge]] presiding over discovery aspects of the case) barred SCO from asserting 187 of the 298 allegedly misused items that IBM had moved to exclude from the lawsuit for lack of specificity,&lt;ref name=gl060629&gt;{{cite news| last= Jones | first= Pamela | authorlink = Pamela Jones| title= Wells' Order Granting in Part IBM's Motion to Limit SCO's Claims, as text| work= [[Groklaw]] | date= 2006-06-29 | url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060628203537917 | accessdate= 2007-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating "many of SCO's arguments and much of [[Marc J. Rochkind|Mr. Rochkind's]] declaration miss the mark", and comparing SCO's tactics with those of an officer who accuses a citizen of theft, but will not disclose what the citizen is accused of stealing.  "Certainly if an individual was stopped and accused of shoplifting after walking out of [[Neiman Marcus]], they would expect to be eventually told what they allegedly stole. It would be absurd for an officer to tell the accused that 'you know what you stole I'm not telling.' Or, to simply hand the accused individual a catalog of Neiman Marcus' entire inventory and say 'it's in there somewhere, you figure it out.'"&lt;ref name=gl060629 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gl060628&gt;{{cite web|title=Wells Grants in Part IBM's Motion to Limit SCO's Claims!

On August 10, 2007, Judge Kimball, who also presides over the ''SCO v. Novell'' case, ruled that Novell, not the SCO Group, is the rightful owner of the copyrights covering the Unix operating system. The court also ruled that "SCO is obligated to recognize Novell's waiver of SCO's claims against IBM and Sequent". After the ruling Novell announced they have no interest in suing people over Unix and stated "We don't believe there is Unix in Linux".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER Civil Case No. 2:04CV139DAK | publisher = TuxRocks.com | url = http://sco.tuxrocks.com/Docs/Novell/Novell-377.pdf | accessdate= 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Novell doesn't believe there is Unix in Linux | publisher = PCWorld | date = 2007-08-15| url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,135959-c,unix/article.html | accessdate= 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt1&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge Says Unix Copyrights Rightfully Belong to Novell |publisher = New York Times|date = 2007-08-11| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/11/technology/11novell.html | accessdate= 2007-08-15 | first=John | last=Markoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gl070810&gt;{{cite web|title=Court Rules: Novell owns the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights!

In an order entered on 21 September 2007, Judge Kimball administratively closed the case of ''SCO v. IBM'' due to SCO filing for bankruptcy on 14 September 2007. This means that all action in ''SCO v. IBM'' is stayed until SCO emerges from bankruptcy proceedings. If and when it does, the case ''SCO v. IBM'' will resume where it left off.&lt;ref name=unknown&gt;{{cite web|title=Judge Kimball administratively closes SCO v. IBM pending bankruptcy proceedings of SCO.|publisher = [[Groklaw]]|date = 2007-09-20| url = http://groklaw.net/article.php?story=2007092110013091 | accessdate= 2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 24, 2009, the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit]] reversed the portion of the August 10, 2007 district court summary judgment in ''[[SCO v. Novell]]'' that Novell owned the copyright to Unix.  As a result, SCO was permitted to pursue its claim of ownership of the Unix copyrights at trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/AppealRuling.pdf Groklaw.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, 2010, the jury returned a verdict in ''SCO v. Novell'', finding that Novell owns the copyrights.&lt;ref name="Jury verdict 2010"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20100330152829622 | title=Novell Wins Again - Jury Rules Copyrights Didn't Go to SCO | accessdate=2010-03-30 | date=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SCO's claims ==
SCO's lawsuit has been consistent only in its claim of [[breach of contract]]&lt;ref name=gl040104 /&gt;&lt;ref name=sco_chart /&gt; (since the abandonment in early 2004 of its claim of misappropriation of [[trade secret]]s). SCO's initial claims were:&lt;ref name=gl040104&gt;{{cite web|title=Caldera's Complaint - Caldera v. IBM - as text |publisher = [[Groklaw]]|date = 2004-01-04| url = http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040704170212250 |accessdate = 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Misappropriation of trade secrets
* [[Unfair competition]]
* Interference with contract
* Breach of IBM Software Agreement

On July 22, 2003, SCO amended its complaint. It added two new claims:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCO's amended complaint | url = http://sco.tuxrocks.com/Docs/IBM/Doc-25.html | accessdate= 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Breach of IBM Sublicensing Agreement
* Breach of Sequent Software Agreement

On February 27, 2004, SCO amended the complaint again, dropping the trade secrets claim, but added the following:&lt;ref name=sco_chart&gt;{{cite web|title=Chart of SCO's Amended Complaints and IBM's 2nd Amended Answer|publisher = [[Groklaw]]|date = 2004-05-08| url = http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040508214237601 |accessdate = 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Breach of Sequent Sublicensing Agreement
* [[Copyright infringement]]
* Interference with business relationships

SCO's claims in press releases and interviews have changed repeatedly as the affair has progressed. SCO has also both claimed and denied that the alleged copyright violations involved the [[Linux kernel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCO-Caldera v IBM: SCO Clears Linux Kernel but Implicates Red Hat and SUSE Linux and the SCO-Caldera v IBM Lawsuit | publisher = MozillaQuest | date = 2003-04-28 | url = http://www.mozillaquest.com/Linux03/ScoSource-10_Story02.html | accessdate= 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--denial; see next quote for contradiction--&gt; ''Computerworld'' reported Chris Sontag of SCO as saying:

{{quote|It's very extensive. It is many different sections of code ranging from five to ten to fifteen lines of code in multiple places that are of issue, up to large blocks of code that have been inappropriately copied into Linux in violation of our source-code licensing contract. That's in the kernel itself, so it is significant. It is not a line or two here or there. It was quite a surprise for us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A: SCO's Chris Sontag on Linux, Unix and brewing legal fights | publisher = Computerworld | date = 2003-05-29 | url = http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/os/linux/story/0,10801,81613,00.html | accessdate= 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

SCO refuses to allow access to the samples of code containing the alleged copyright violations except under a [[non-disclosure agreement]] (NDA).  SCO's NDA would not only require that the signer keep confidential which lines of code SCO contested, but would also require that they hold confidential any information SCO told them, even if they already knew that information before being informed of it by SCO; all Linux kernel developers have considered this to be far too restrictive, so none of them have signed it. However, at SCO's annual reseller's convention in August 2003, they revealed two short sections of code they alleged were copyright violations, and images of Darl McBride's presentation of this code were soon after published on German computer magazine publisher [[Heinz Heise]]'s website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCO sagt der Open Source den Existenzkampf an|publisher = [[Heise Online]]|date = 2003-08-19|url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/39519 |accessdate = 2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 30, 2003, SCO Group's [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Darl McBride]] was quoted as saying that the Linux kernel contained "hundreds of [[Source lines of code|lines" of code]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = SCO to Novell: See you in court | publisher = News.com | date = 2003-05-30 | url = http://news.cnet.com/2100-1016-1011627.html | accessdate = 2007-08-15 | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120715175954/http://news.cnet.com/2100-1016-1011627.html | archivedate = 2012-07-15 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; from SCO's version of UNIX, and that SCO would reveal the code to other companies under NDA in July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCO Promises To Show Offending Code Next Week|last=Ricadela|first=Aaron|publisher=InformationWeek|date= 2003-05-30|url=http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=10100587|accessdate=2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; To put this into context, David Wheeler's SLOCCount&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dwheeler.com/sloc/redhat71-v1/kernel_sloc DWheeler.com]&lt;/ref&gt; estimates the size of the Linux 2.4.2 kernel as 2,440,919 source lines of code out of over 30 million physical source lines of code for a typical GNU/Linux distribution. Therefore, as per SCO's own estimate, the allegedly infringing code would make up about 0.001% of the total code of a typical GNU/Linux installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Counting Source Lines of Code (SLOC) | url=http://www.dwheeler.com/sloc/}}&lt;/ref&gt; SCO has since upwardly revised this figure to over a million lines of code, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCO: No choice but to go after Linux | publisher = Enterprise Linux News | date = 2003-10-08 | url = http://searchenterpriselinux.techtarget.com/qna/0,289202,sid39_gci931259,00.html | accessdate= 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Getting a glimpse at SCO's evidence | publisher = News.com | date = 2003-08-19 | url = http://news.cnet.com/2100-1016_3-5065422.html | accessdate = 2007-08-15 | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120722032936/http://news.cnet.com/2100-1016_3-5065422.html | archivedate = 2012-07-22 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Analysts Examine SCO Claims Against GPL | publisher = Linux Today | date = 2003-08-22 | url = http://www.linuxtoday.com/infrastructure/2003082201426NWCDLL | accessdate= 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCO's major claims have now been reported as relating to the following components of the Linux kernel:

* [[Symmetric multiprocessing]] (SMP),
* [[Non-uniform memory access]] (NUMA) multiprocessing,
* the [[read-copy-update]] (RCU) locking strategy,
** This technique is widely believed to have been developed at [[Sequent Computer Systems]], who were then bought by IBM, who holds several patents (including patent {{US patent|5442758|5,442,758}}) on this technique.
* [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]]'s Extended File System ([[XFS]]),
* IBM's [[IBM Journaled File System 2 (JFS2)|JFS]] [[journaling file system]]

These claims flow from the accusation of breach of contract.  The contract between IBM and [[AT&amp;T Corporation]] (to which SCO claims to be successor in interest) allows IBM to use the [[UNIX System V|SVR4]] code, but the SVR4 code, plus any derivative works made from that code, must be held confidential by IBM.  According to IBM's interpretation of the contract, and the interpretation published by AT&amp;T in their "$ echo" newsletter in 1985, "derivative works" means any works containing SVR4 code.  But according to SCO's interpretation, "derivative works" also includes any code built on top of SVR4, even if that does not contain, or even never contained, any SVR4 code. Thus, according to SCO, any [[AIX operating system]] code that IBM developed must be kept confidential, even if it contains nothing from SVR4.

== Free software and open source community reaction ==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2008}}
The lawsuit caused moral indignation and outrage in the [[free software]] and [[Open-source software|open source]] [[free software community|communities]], who consider SCO's claims to be without merit and even cynically dishonest.  Open source advocates' arguments include:

* that SCO does not even own the code in question. SCO has often called themselves "The owner of the UNIX operating system". But that claim is dubious at best. SCO certainly has no clear claim to SVR4 code. This view is now supported by the jury verdict in ''SCO v. Novell''.
* that the Linux operating system was unlikely to contain UNIX code, as it had been written from scratch by hundreds of collaborators, with a well-documented [[provenance]] and revision history that was entirely in the public view;
* that it made no technical sense to incorporate SCO UNIX code in Linux, as Linux had the technical features that are claimed to have been appropriated already implemented before SCO UNIX had them;
* that even if Linux and SCO UNIX had some code in common, this did not necessarily mean that this code was copied to Linux from SCO UNIX—perhaps the common pieces of code had been legitimately copied from another open source operating system, perhaps a [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]]-derived one, or one of the historical UNIX versions previously released by SCO;
* that [[Caldera Systems]] had begun as a Linux company before buying SCO's UNIX business and certain assets related to it, and has added many Linux-like features to SCO UNIX, and any common code may have in fact been copied from Linux into SCO UNIX:
** and furthermore, that if such reverse copying from Linux itself had occurred, that the distribution of SCO UNIX binaries containing [[GNU General Public License|GPL]]'d contributions may therefore require SCO either to remove their product from the market until GPL'd code has been removed, or to release their source code under the GPL to their users;
* that even if Linux did contain copied SCO UNIX code, the UNIX source code had already been made widely available without a [[non-disclosure agreement]], and therefore had no [[trade secret]] status (as a judge found in ''[[USL v. BSDi]]'');
* that even if Linux did contain some UNIX code, the SCO Group had lost any right to sue IBM for trade secret or other intellectual property infringement by distributing Linux itself (their Caldera OpenLinux distribution) under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL), both before and after their announcement, which precludes them from pursuing any other user of Linux.&lt;ref name=em1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=em2 /&gt;

SCO and its officers have been the subject of much criticism by the free software community, some of whom have stated that SCO's behavior may amount to illegal conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Groklaw gets a subpoena? | publisher = lamlaw.com | date = 2007-04-04 | url = http://www.lamlaw.com/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=192 | accessdate = 2007-08-26 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090618011207/http://www.lamlaw.com/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=192 | archive-date = 2009-06-18 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; SEC filings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = SCO execs cash in on suit spotlight | publisher = zdnet.com | date = 2003-07-29 | url = http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-130707.html | accessdate = 2009-09-22 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date= 2003-10-14 | url = https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102542/000104746903033257/a2118764zs-3a.htm#dg2003_selling_stockholders |title=Selling Stockholders}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that senior SCO executives dumped their personal holdings in SCO shortly after counter-suits were filed by IBM and Red Hat. SCO Group's CEO [[Darl McBride]] has been the subject of particular criticism, because of his extreme statements to the press.

On March 10, 2003, the [[Open Source Initiative]] (OSI) released a position paper on the ''SCO v. IBM'' complaint, written by [[Eric S. Raymond]], president of the OSI and author of ''[[The Cathedral and the Bazaar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= OSI Position Paper on the SCO-vs.-IBM Complaint | publisher = Eric Raymond | date = 2003-03-10 | url = http://www.opensource.org/sco-vs-ibm.html  | accessdate= 2007-09-01 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060407033041/http://www.opensource.org/sco-vs-ibm.html |archivedate = 2006-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 16, 2003, [[Groklaw]], a website founded by journalist/paralegal [[Pamela Jones]], began covering the SCO litigation on a daily basis, and became a voice for the community to express its views of SCO's claims, as well as being an experiment in applying Open Source principles to legal research. The SCO Group has singled the site out as a particular thorn in its side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=20050414214437589| title=SCO's 1Q 2005 Earnings Conference Call – transcript| work=Groklaw| date=2005-04-18| accessdate=2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 30, 2003, [[Linus Torvalds]], developer of the Linux kernel, was quoted as saying, regarding the case:

{{quote|Quite frankly, I found it mostly interesting in a [[Jerry Springer]] kind of way. White trash battling it out in public, throwing chairs at each other. SCO crying about IBM's other women. ...

''The Inquirer'' reported on June 15, 2003, that an unnamed Linux kernel programmer has written to SCO, threatening action based on their distribution of a Linux distribution that, according to their own claims, contains code not licensed under the GPL. According to the letter reproduced there, the programmer claimed that SCO's doing so was an infringement of his own copyright. SCO's response to this letter is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Linux kernel coder puts SCO on notice | publisher = The Inquirer |date = 2003-06-15| url = http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=10018 | accessdate= 2007-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview on June 23, 2003, Torvalds responded to SCO's allegation that Linux development had no process for vetting kernel contributions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Torvalds Speaks Out on SCO, Linux | publisher = eWeek |date = 2003-06-23| url = http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Linux-and-Open-Source/Torvalds-Speaks-Out-on-SCO-Linux/1/ | accessdate= 2007-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I allege that SCO is full of it, and that the Linux process is already the most transparent process in the whole industry.  Let's face it, nobody else even comes close to being as good at showing the evolution and source of every single line of code out there.}}

On June 27, 2003, [[Eben Moglen]], the counsel for the [[Free Software Foundation]], released a more complete statement regarding the SCO lawsuit. In this statement, he reiterates many of the points made above, and states that:&lt;ref name=em2&gt;{{cite news|title= FSF Statement on ''SCO v.

{{quote|As to its trade secret claims, which are the only claims actually made in the lawsuit against IBM, there remains the simple fact that SCO has for years distributed copies of the kernel, Linux, as part of GNU/Linux free software systems.

On July 31, 2003, the [[OSDL|Open Source Development Labs]] released a position paper on the ongoing conflict,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OSDL Releases Position Paper on SCO and Linux | publisher = PR Newswire | date = 2003-07-31 | url = http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/07-31-2003/0001992992&amp;EDATE= | accessdate= 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Questioning SCO: A Hard Look at Nebulous Claims|last=Moglen|first=Eben|publisher=OSDL|date=2003-07-31|format=PDF|url=http://old.linux-foundation.org/docs/osdl_eben_moglen_position_paper.pdf|accessdate=2007-08-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225714/http://old.linux-foundation.org/docs/osdl_eben_moglen_position_paper.pdf|archive-date=2007-09-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by the FSF's Eben Moglen.

=== Accusations of creating fear, uncertainty and doubt ===
A number of Linux supporters have characterized SCO's actions as an attempt to create [[fear, uncertainty and doubt]] about Linux. Many believe that SCO's aim is to be bought out by IBM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = SCO plays a nasty game with Linux market | publisher = TechRepublic | date = 2003-06-20 | url = http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-6298_11-5055277.html | accessdate = 2007-08-26 | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120722085240/http://www.techrepublic.com/article/sco-plays-a-nasty-game-with-linux-market/5055277 | archivedate = 2012-07-22 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have pointed to [[Microsoft]]'s subsequent licensing of the SCO source code as a possible ''[[quid pro quo]]'' for SCO's action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Update: Microsoft behind $50M SCO investment | publisher = Computerworld |date = 2004-03-11| url = http://www.computerworld.com/article/2563673/linux/update--microsoft-behind--50m-sco-investment.html | accessdate= 2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the SCO Group continued to express this position, they would have to pay a fine of [[Euro|€]]250,000. A similar injunction was sought around the same time in [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= SCO Shuts Down Polish Office; Former Manager Opens Linux Business | publisher = [[Groklaw]] | date = 2004-05-10| url = http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040510195102144 | accessdate= 2007-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 23, [[Open Source Victoria]] announced that they had filed a complaint with the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]], "asking the ACCC to investigate the SCO Group's activities in light of their unsubstantiated claims and their extortive legal threats for money against possibly hundreds of thousands of Australians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= OSV Files Complaint against The SCO Group with ACCC | publisher = Open Source Victoria | date = 2003-07-23| url = http://www.osv.org.au/index.cgi?tid=74 | accessdate= 2007-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The GPL issue ==
[[File:Eben Moglen-2007-06-27-portrait.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eben Moglen]] ]]
Within a few months of the filing of the lawsuit, Eben Moglen, the [[Free Software Foundation]]'s legal counsel, stated that SCO's suit should not concern Linux users other than IBM. In an interview with ''internetnews.com'', he was reported as saying:&lt;ref name=em1&gt;{{cite web|title= SCO Faces Hurdles in Linux Claims | publisher = internetnews.com |date = 2003-05-16| url = http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/2207791 | accessdate= 2007-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There is absolute difficulty with this line of argument which ought to make everybody in the world aware that the letters that SCO has put out can be safely put in the wastebasket...

From the moment SCO distributed the Linux kernel under GPL, they licensed the use. Always. That's what our license says.}}

Apparently noticing the incongruity of their selling a Linux distribution while suing IBM for stealing their intellectual property and giving it to the developers of that operating system, the SCO Group then announced on May 14, 2003, that they would no longer distribute Linux. According to a press release, SCO said that it would "continue to support existing SCO Linux and [[Caldera OpenLinux]] customers and hold them harmless from any SCO intellectual property issues regarding SCO Linux and Caldera OpenLinux products".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= SCO Suspends Distribution of Linux Pending Intellectual Property Clarification; Announces Greater Focus on UNIX and SCOx Strategy |work= SCO Group |date= 2003-05-14 |url= http://ir.sco.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=109149 |accessdate= 2007-08-26 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071014043832/http://ir.sco.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=109149 |archive-date= 2007-10-14 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCO currently claims:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= SCO's Supplemental Responses to IBM's 2nd Interrogatories and Requests for Documents | publisher = [[Groklaw]] |date = 2003-11-29| url = http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20031129053244861 | accessdate= 2007-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= SCO Intellectual Property License FAQ for Linux | publisher = SCO | url = http://www.sco.com/scosource/linuxlicensefaq.html | accessdate= 2007-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Any code belonging to SCO that might have been GPL'd was done by SCO employees without proper legal authorization, and thus is not legally GPL'd.
* That for code to be GPL'd, the code's copyright owner must put a GPL notice before the code, but since SCO itself was not the one to add the notices, the code was never GPL'd.

=== GPL and the US Constitution ===
During a certain period of its litigation against IBM, SCO alleged that the GPL violates the [[United States Constitution]]. This allegation was dropped however from SCO's claims in April 2004 in "SCO's Answer to IBM's Second Amended Counterclaims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCO Drops Its Claim That the GPL is Unconstitutional - SCO's Answer to IBM's Second Amended Counterclaims - as text | publisher = [[Groklaw]]|date = 2004-04-29| url = http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040428235932742 | accessdate= 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCO originally based its views on the following considerations:{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Section 8 of [[Article One (United States Constitution)|Article One]] of the [[United States Constitution]] states that

{{quote|''&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[United States Congress|Congress]] shall have power]'' to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.}}

Since the GNU General Public License for the most part disclaims exclusive rights, SCO claimed that its use violates this clause.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} SCO's argument asks the court to limit both Congress's discretion in implementing the copyright clause, which the Supreme Court refused to do in ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]'', and copyright holders' discretion over the enjoyment of their exclusive rights.{{original research inline|date=December 2013}} The GPL specifically prohibits, in section 7, distribution of software in jurisdictions where the laws are incompatible with the GPL, so a ruling that upheld SCO's constitutional argument would prevent distribution of Linux (and other copylefted software) in the United States.{{original research inline|date=December 2013}}

Other commentators disagree however. One such commentator, Tom Carey, partner and chairman of a Boston intellectual property law firm, even went so far as to say "Attacks on the GPL are far-fetched and a little bit desperate".&lt;ref name=eweek&gt;{{cite web|title=SCO Still Contends GPL Is Unconstitutional | publisher = eWeek | date = 2004-04-30 | url = http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1581586,00.asp | accessdate= 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stacey Quandt, principal analyst at Quandt Analytics, remarked, "SCO's prior claim that the GPL was unconstitutional was equivalent to Microsoft's claims about open source being un-American&amp;mdash;totally ridiculous.".&lt;ref name=eweek /&gt;

Professor Eben Moglen, on leave from the Columbia University law faculty for the year 2006-2007, speaking as counsel to the Free Software Foundation (FSF) who is responsible for drafting the GPL, also takes this view. He says, "I believe the constitutionality attack on the GPL is not a tenable legal argument but is rather a public relations argument." In a talk at Harvard in February, he addressed the issue of constitutionality by referring to Congress' recent extension of copyright term limits. "It turns out that there's no such thing as an unconstitutional copyright rule," he said, "if Congress passes it, and if it observes the distinction between expression and idea."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future of the GPL | publisher = LinuxInsider| date = 2004-03-15 | url = http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/33121.html | accessdate= 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Novell enters the controversy ==
{{Main|SCO v. Novell}}

[[Novell]] entered the controversy by publishing on May 28, 2003, a press release concerning the [[SCO Group]]'s ownership of [[Unix|UNIX]]. "To Novell's knowledge, the 1995 agreement governing SCO's purchase of UNIX from Novell does not convey to SCO the associated copyrights", a letter to the SCO Group's CEO Darl McBride said in part. "We believe it unlikely that SCO can demonstrate that it has any ownership interest whatsoever in those copyrights.  Apparently you share this view, since over the last few months you have repeatedly asked Novell to transfer the copyrights to SCO, requests that Novell has rejected."

SCO later claimed to have discovered an amendment to their contract with Novell transferring partial ownership to SCO.  Novell stated that the amendment "appears to bear a valid Novell signature, and the language, though convoluted, seems to support SCO's claim that ownership of some copyrights for Unix did transfer to SCO"; Novell also said that it could not find its own copy of the amendment.

But in subsequent letters to SCO that Novell released as part of a press release on December 22, 2003, [[Joseph LaSala Jr.]], Novell's general counsel, argued that the amendment provided for a copyright transfer only under certain conditions that SCO has allegedly failed to meet.

SCO was quick to dismiss Novell's claims.  The same day, during a conference call to discuss SCO's quarterly financial results, SCO CEO Darl McBride said "We see this as a fraudulent filing of copyright notices...and we'll take the appropriate measures as necessary with our legal team". SCO made good on this threat on January 20, 2004, when it filed ''[[SCO v. Novell]]''. On August 10, 2007, Judge Kimball issued a ruling which says in part "the court concludes that Novell is the owner of the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights." This decision is expected to impact the ''SCO v. IBM'' since the ruling states that Novell "is entitled, at its sole discretion, to direct SCO to waive its claims against IBM and Sequent".&lt;ref name=nyt1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Court Ruling Gives Novell Copyright in Unix System | publisher = Wall Street Journal | date = 2007-08-11 | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118678589019694632 | accessdate= 2007-08-15 | first1=Keith J. | last1=Winstein | first2=William M. | last2=Bulkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IBM's AIX license ==
Reuters reported that the SCO Group intended to revoke IBM's license to use UNIX code in their AIX operating system on June 13, 2003, if no resolution is reached before then. IBM responded that they believe that SCO has no power to do so, as their license is "irrevocable". On the following Monday, June 16, 2003, CNET reported that SCO had announced it had terminated IBM's license. IBM continues to distribute and support AIX, and the SCO Group now states that they will be seeking an injunction to force IBM not only to stop selling and supporting AIX, but also to return to the SCO Group or destroy all copies of the AIX operating system. IBM's continued distribution of AIX is the basis of SCO's copyright claim.

On June 9, however, Novell privately conversed with SCO expressing their belief that SCO did not have rights to terminate the license.  Three days later, Novell cited Section 4.16(b) of their Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) with SCO that gave Novell the ability to intercede in the dispute between SCO and IBM and waived SCO's rights to terminate the license.&lt;ref&gt;[http://radio.weblogs.com/0120124/2003/08/08.html "The Novell Letters"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212032042/http://radio.weblogs.com/0120124/2003/08/08.html |date=2007-12-12 }}, Groklaw, August 8, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 10, 2007, Judge Kimball ruled that Novell was the owner of UNIX and thus could waive SCO's termination of IBM's license.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20070810165237718 Groklaw Friday August 10, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

== IBM counterclaims against SCO ==
On August 6, 2003, IBM filed its [[counterclaim]]s against SCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The text of IBM's counterclaims | publisher = LWN.net|date = 2003-08-08| url = https://lwn.net/Articles/43592/ | accessdate= 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DEFENDANT IBM'S ANSWER TO THE AMENDED COMPLAINT AND COUNTERCLAIM-PLAINTIFF IBM'S COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST SCO | publisher = [[Groklaw]] | url = http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/Doc-27.pdf | accessdate= 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It made 10 counterclaims:

* [[Breach of contract]]
* [[Lanham Act]] violation
* [[Unfair competition]]
* Intentional interference with prospective economic relations
* Unfair and deceptive trade practices
* Breach of the [[GNU General Public License]]
* and four counts of [[patent infringement]]

In response to these counterclaims, SCO asserted that the GPL is unenforceable, void, and violates the [[United States Constitution]], but later dropped that claim.  If these claims were true, then the GPL'd applications that SCO continued to distribute (like [[Samba software|Samba]]) were being distributed without the permission of the copyright owners of those applications (since the permission was the GPL itself), which would be illegal.

On September 25, 2003, IBM amended its counterclaims bringing the total number of counterclaims to 13. The new counterclaims were:

* [[Copyright infringement]]
** This counterclaim involved an alleged copyright infringement by SCO of GPL-licensed IBM code in the Linux kernel. Some commentators had pointed out that if SCO managed to invalidate the GPL, they were highly likely to be caught by this counterclaim, as it is of the same form as their claim against IBM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IBM's Amended Counterclaims Against SCO as Text, Sept. 25, 2003 |publisher = [[Groklaw]]|date = 2003-11-02| url = http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20031102104937393 | accessdate= 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Estoppel|Promissory estoppel]]
* [[Declaratory judgment]]

On March 29, 2004, IBM amended its counterclaims again. It dropped one of the patent infringement claims, but added two new Declaratory judgments of Noninfringement of Copyrights. One of these sought a declaration that IBM's AIX-related activities did not infringe any of SCO's copyrights. The other one sought a similar declaration about IBM's Linux-related activities.

== Discovery ==
The [[discovery (law)|discovery]] portion of the lawsuit lasted several years. The basis for SCO's suit is that any code developed on top of [[SVRX]] is a derivative work of SVRX (which would include AIX), and that IBM has publicly admitted to contributing AIX code to the Linux kernel.  Since SCO has never seen the AIX code, it has, as part of the discovery process, [[Deposition (law)|deposed]] IBM for the AIX code, so that it can compare AIX code to Linux kernel code.  IBM, rejecting SCO's concept of derivative work, has deposed SCO for which lines of code it claims are infringing.  SCO has responded that it can't determine which code is infringing until it has had the chance to look at the AIX code.

On December 5, 2003, in the first oral arguments relating to the discovery process, a judge granted IBM's two motions to compel against SCO, and deferred consideration of SCO's motions until later. This gave SCO a 30-day deadline to provide "with specificity" which lines of code in Linux they claim form the basis of their case. This was widely regarded as a first-round victory for IBM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Transcript of Oral Arguments Friday, Dec. 5, 2003 SCO v.

On June 28, 2006, Judge Brooke Wells granted IBM's motion to strike most of SCO's evidence, citing in part SCO's inability to provide the specificity required by the court: 

{{quote|In December 2003, near the beginning of this case, the court ordered SCO to, "identify and state with specificity the source code(s) that SCO is claiming form the basis of their action against IBM". Even if SCO lacked the code behind methods and concepts at this early stage, SCO could have and should have, at least articulated which methods and concepts formed "the basis of their action against IBM". At a minimum, SCO should have identified the code behind their method and concepts in the final submission pursuant to this original order entered in December 2003 and Judge Kimball's order entered in July 2005.&lt;ref name=gl060629 /&gt;(paragraph 30)}}

== Copyright claims and DMCA notices ==
In late December 2003, new developments involving copyright claims emerged.

[[Novell]] registered their claim to the copyright of original [[Unix|UNIX]] source code, effectively challenging SCO's registration of the same code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Novell Statement on UNIX Copyright Registrations | publisher = Novell | url = http://www.novell.com/news/press/archive/2003/12/pr03080.html | accessdate= 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Novell Registers UNIX System V Copyrights - Dueling Copyrights | publisher = [[Groklaw]] | url = http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20031222051806656 | accessdate= 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''solar tree''' is a structure incorporating solar energy technology on a single pillar, like a tree trunk. It may be a solar artwork or a functional power generator.

==Intent and Context==
Solar trees are intended to bring visibility to solar technology and to enhance the landscape and architecture they complement, usually in a commercial or public context.  An objective of many solar tree installations is to promote awareness, understanding, and adoption of renewable energy. They are not typically used as a primary source of energy for a property—that role is accomplished by rooftop solar systems. Solar trees are complementary to rooftop solar systems, or other green building measures, symbolizing these larger investments and their environmental benefit.

==Benefits of solar tree==
Solar trees may build awareness and interest in solar technology and also provide shade and meeting places.

==Origin and Progress of solar tree==
Unique sculptural creations for a single sites began to appear in 1998 (e.g., the 7&amp;nbsp;kW tree in Gleisdorf, Austria) or earlier. A number of variants of solar trees have been conceived, not all of them realized in installations. Locations have included roadways, public areas in cities, schools and universities, office buildings, science museums, and more. Recently, designers and manufacturers have introduced solar trees as products, designed to deliver the benefits of solar trees in a repeatable way to more places. Examples include Ross Lovegrove's solar tree which incorporated seating, lighting, and circular groupings of photovoltaic cells, [http://envisionsolar.com/ Envision Solar] solar parking canopy specifically trademarked Solar Tree, and Spotlight Solar's line of architectural structures and most recently CSIR’s Solar Power Tree from India.

==Examples of solar tree==
Example 1: '''Original Solar Tree Artworks'''

:A number of sculptural structures which incorporate solar photovoltaic cells have been erected. Gleisdorf, Austria hosts a tree with 7kW capacity and other solar sculptures, many less tree-ish. Tree-like solar structures have been commissioned for retail stores like [https://web.archive.org/web/20150128114025/http://visitcolumbia.blogspot.com/2011/06/half-moon-outfitters-new-home-is-as.html Halfmoon Outfitters], and for towns like [https://web.archive.org/web/20150128114025/http://visitcolumbia.blogspot.com/2011/06/half-moon-outfitters-new-home-is-as.html Cherokee, NC].[[File:Solar Tree.jpg|thumb|Ross Lovegrove Solar Tree on display.]]

Example 2: '''Ross Lovegrove's Solar Tree'''

:[[Ross Lovegrove]], a Welsh industrial designer known for his organic inspired designs, conceived an organic-looking solar structure with multiple curve stems and circular collections of photovoltaic cells. It was first manufactured by [[Artemide]], a manufacturer of design differentiated products, based in Milan, Italy. In an effort to follow an environmentally conscious route, the company sought to incorporate solar power in their architectural designs.&lt;ref&gt;Artemide. . N.p.. Web. 20 Feb 2013. [http://www.artemide.us/?page=main/news_and_events&amp;index_id=3 Artemide Events Page].&lt;/ref&gt;

:Artemide defines the Solar Tree as “The successful marriage of the most advanced technology and the aesthetic requirements of the urban environment by way of renewable energy.”&lt;ref&gt;Artemide. . N.p.. Web. 20 Feb 2013. [http://www.artemide.us/?page=main/news_and_events&amp;index_id=3 Artemide Events Page].&lt;/ref&gt;

:Ross Lovegrove’s original design consisted of a sinuous tree constructed of steel pipes, measuring 5.5 meters, supporting a light bubble in which 38 solar cells, each with 38 watt capacity, connected to a hidden 12V battery system which lit an assortment of 1W LEDs at the tip. The solar cells for the project were commissioned by [[Sharp Solar]].

:How it works: The Solar Tree panels charge batteries during the day. At dusk the Solar Tree automatically switches on its LEDs.  The internal control can also regulate the amount of light produced depending on how much charge is left in the batteries.&lt;ref&gt;Design Boom May 26, 2012 [http://www.designboom.com/design/ross-lovegrove-solar-tree-at-clerkenwell-design-week/ Article on LoveGrove and solar trees]&lt;/ref&gt;  Artemide claims the Solar Tree will produce light for three consecutive overcast days.&lt;ref&gt;Solar Tree. Artemide. N.p.. Web. 20 Feb 2013. [http://www.artemide.us/pdfs/solartree.pdf Artemide Brochure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105102703/http://www.artemide.us/pdfs/solartree.pdf |date=2011-01-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The designer [[Ross Lovegrove]] claims, "Solar Tree represents the DNA of our time and it also shows it is possible to create beautiful things using the most advanced technology."&lt;ref&gt;Artemide . N.p.. Web. 20 Feb 2013. [http://www.artemide.us/?page=main/news_and_events&amp;index_id=3 Artemide on LoveGrove].&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007 Lovegrove was awarded the Vogue Traveller Ecology Prize for his work with the Solar Tree.

Example 3: '''Spotlight Solar structures'''
[[File:Spotlight Solar at Sandy Grove Middle School.jpg|thumb|Spotlight Solar product "Lift" at net-zero school in NC, Sandy Grove Middle School]]
:In 2011, [http://www.spotlightsolar.com/ Spotlight Solar] introduced a line of architectural products which customers refer to as solar trees. While sculptural, these are repeatable engineered products designed to place solar energy technology in high visibility locations in an attractive way. These structure have been used at green building sites such as the net-zero Sandy Grove Middle School,&lt;ref&gt;PR Web, [http://www.prweb.com/releases/spotlight_solar/green_building_solar_art/prweb10702354.htm announcement] of Sandy Grove Middle School project completion.&lt;/ref&gt; the St. Louis Rams' headquarters,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2014/03/st-louis-rams-score-solar-featuring-lumos-lsx-modules/ SolarWorld Article] on the Rams' solar projects&lt;/ref&gt; NC State University, and the Orange County Convention Center to demonstrate environmental stewardship and to complement other sustainability measures.

Example 4: '''CSIR's Solar Power Tree'''

[[File:Solartree.jpg|thumb|right|CSIR's Solar Power Tree]]
:In 2016, CSIR-[[Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute]], Durgapur, India invented another model of Solar Tree for its application at villages, besides national highway and conventional power grid system to fulfill the electricity crisis by increasing the share of renewable energy in the country. The developed structure is capable of generating the electricity in tune of 3-7 Kwh with a bare footprint of 2x2 sqft area. These solar trees are already installed and functioning at developer’s campus, CSIR’s Headquarter and at the residential campus of Minister of Science &amp; Technology of India&lt;ref&gt;•	Dr. Harsh Vardhan launches the ‘Solar Power Tree’ – an Innovation aimed at utilizing minimum land to harness maximum Solar Energy [http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=147570]&lt;/ref&gt; to demonstrate the success of the technology. Researchers at CSIR-CMERI are also working on bringing aesthetic models to suit the need of public parks, gardens, market places etc.

Example 5: '''Solar Power Tree Artifact'''
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Solar Power Tree Artifact.jpg|thumb|right|Solar Power Tree Artifact to light Auditorium Premises]] --&gt;
:In 2017, the 2.5 KW solar power tree artifact was first used by Durgapur Municipal Corporation, West Bengal, India at its Srijani Auditorium. The solar power tree artifact was designed and developed by Indian researchers.&lt;ref&gt;CSIR-CMERI, Durgapur: Solar Artifact [http://www.cmeri.res.in/technology/solar-artifact] Solar Power Tree Artifact&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the aesthetics, the power generated from this tree is stored in built-in battery banks and used for off-peak usage to light the garden and lawns.

:Example 6: '''Possibility Tree (Solar Tree)'''[[File:Muri2.jpg|alt=|thumb|Solar Tree named 'Possibility tree' has been installed at Muri Okunola garden, Adeyemo Alakija st, Victoria Island. Lagos. Nigeria by Folub Eletrik Servz.]]
::'Possibility tree' which is a Solar Tree has been installed at Muri Okunola garden, Adeyemo Alakija st, Victoria Island. Lagos. Nigeria by Folub Eletrik Servz, a power/renewable energy company in Lagos, Nigeria. It is actually the 1st in Nigeria and Africa. It's an iconic tree with lots of possibilities as thename implies. The tree has come with durable garden furniture with near-nature aesthetics. Apart from these, the power generated from this tree is stored in the battery and inverted for the purpose of quick charging of mobile devices such as mobile phone, camera, mp3 player and smart electronics and will still give light at night.  'Possibility tree' brings opportunity for users by networking,relaxation, sitting, charging, etc. According to CEO, Folub Eletrik Servz, Olabode Adefolu, a power/Renewable Energy Engr, the Possibility Tree is the successful marriage of the most advance technology-Renewable energy and the aesthetics requirements of the Smart city that Lagos is becoming. The Solar charging tree can be installed in public places such as streets, city parks, garden, cultural centres and squares providing passersby with opportunity to charge their mobile devices while outside considering the peculiarity of our country power shortages. It can equally accommodate free wireless internet in the immediate surrounding while complementing the existing one.  This idea came through increasing energy efficiency and promotion of renewable energy source which Folub Eletrik Servz has been championing through the annual [[Www.alternativepowerexhibition.com|Alternative Power Exhibition]](www.alternativepowerexhibition.com) that is in its 8th edition currently in Lagos, Nigeria.

==Further interpretations==
The [[Strawberry Tree (solar energy device)|Strawberry Tree]], invented by the Serbian company [[Strawberry Energy]], is a variation of the Solar Tree in that it is specifically designed to recharge mobile devices.  The company won the Sustainable Energy Week 2011” competition for its revolutionary contribution.&lt;ref&gt;strawberry tree (The Solar Energy Device)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a distinction to be made between organically inspired solo
r trees and structures which have been adopted to create energy efficient parking lots.&lt;ref&gt;Clean Technica Feb 21, 2013 [http://cleantechnica.com/2013/02/21/envision-plans-to-install-2300-rotating-solar-tree-car-shelters-in-south-carolina/ Clean Technica]&lt;/ref&gt;  Companies such as General Electric&lt;ref&gt;Clean Technica May 30, 2011 [http://cleantechnica.com/2011/05/30/ge-converts-parking-lot-to-solar-charging-station-for-electric-vehicles/ General Electric goes solar]&lt;/ref&gt; have installed solar panels in car parking lots to collect solar energy and protect vehicles from sun damage.  These car sheltering solar devices differ from artistic Solar Trees in that they have no organic aesthetic.  In contrast to the field of solar artwork, they would more appropriately be dubbed elevated solar panels.

==The Solar Tree Foundation==
[[Rein Triefeldt]] is a solar environmentalist artist that has also begun to construct solar trees.  He is one of the founders and the current president of the Solar Tree Foundation which began in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Rein Triefeldt. Princeton Green. N.p.. Web. 20 Feb 2013. [http://www.princetongreen.org/clientinc/upload/images/Rein_bio.pdf On Rein Triefeldt]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Solar Tree Foundation designs programs for elementary school students to show them the creative process for constructing a Solar Tree in order to educate a broad audience on the environmental and technological material.  It’s also designed with the intention of instilling an appreciation for artistic aesthetics interpreted through sculptures as a medium of expression.  This is performed by online lectures and webcams in which the students can engage with the architects and see the construction process in real time.&lt;ref&gt;Projects. Solar Tree Foundation. N.p.. Web. 20 Feb 2013. [http://solartree.org/projects.html Solar Tree Foundation Projects].&lt;/ref&gt;  Triefeldt believes that his Solar Trees will help preserve natural trees in the long run.

The latest solar tree constructed by the Solar Tree Foundation was erected for North Hillsborough Elementary School in Hillsborough California.  At peak efficiency, the 10,000&amp;nbsp;lb Solar Tree is claimed to produce 20,000 watts of energy per day.&lt;ref&gt;Solar Tree Foundation accessed: Feb 20, 2013 [http://solartree.org/press.html Solar Tree Foundation site]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Speed limits in the United States}}
[[File:US Speed Limits May 2015.svg|right|thumb|512px]]
'''Speed limits in the United States''' vary depending on jurisdiction, with {{convert|75|to|80|mph|abbr=on|round=10|km/h}} common in the [[Western United States]] and {{convert|65|to|75|mph|km/h|abbr=on|round=10}} common in the [[Eastern United States]]. States may also set special speed limits for trucks and night travel along with minimum speed limits. The highest speed limit in the country is {{convert|85|mph|abbr=on|round=10|km/h}}, which is posted on a single stretch of tollway in rural Texas.

{{Horizontal TOC|limit=2|nonum=y}}

==Alabama==
In [[Alabama]], it is illegal to drive at a speed that is not "reasonable and prudent" for the current conditions and hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/alison/codeofalabama/1975/32-5A-170.htm|title=Reasonable and prudent speed|website=Code of Alabama|at=sec. 32-5A-170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drivers must also not drive so slowly that they impede the flow of traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/alison/codeofalabama/1975/32-5A-174.htm|title=Minimum speed regulation|website=Code of Alabama|at=sec. 32-5A-174}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the speed limit is not otherwise posted, it is:
*{{convert|30|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in urban areas
*{{convert|35|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on unpaved roads
*{{convert|45|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on rural paved county roads
*{{convert|55|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on other two-lane roads
*{{convert|65|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on four-lane roads
*{{convert|70|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on [[List of Interstate Highways in Alabama|Interstate Highways]]
Trucks carrying [[Dangerous goods|hazardous materials]] are not to exceed {{convert|55|mph|km/h}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/alison/codeofalabama/1975/32-5A-171.htm|title=Maximum limits|website=Code of Alabama|at=sec. 32-5A-171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alaska==
In [[Alaska]], many of the major highways carry a {{convert|65|mph|adj=on}} speed limit, including:
*A majority of the [[Parks Highway]] between [[Fairbanks]] and [[Willow, Alaska|Willow]] (excepting slower zones through [[Nenana, Alaska|Nenana]], [[Denali National Park|Denali Park]], [[Cantwell, Alaska|Cantwell]], and [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]])
*Most of the [[Richardson Highway]] between [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]] and [[North Pole, Alaska|North Pole]]
*On the [[Glenn Highway]], the {{convert|35|mi|adj=on}} freeway between [[Wasilla, Alaska|Wasilla]] and [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], and most of the 100 miles west of Glennallen
*The [[Seward Highway]] freeway in Anchorage between 36th Avenue and Rabbit Creek Road, and other non-freeway parts of the [[Seward Highway]] south of Bird Point
*Most of the [[Alaska Highway]] between the Canadian border and [[Delta Junction, Alaska|Delta Junction]]
The [[Minnesota Drive Expressway]] features a {{convert|60|mph|adj=on}} speed limit, as does the [[Richardson Highway]] between Fairbanks and North Pole.

Since the mid-1990s, Alaska's major highways have gradually been upgraded from 55 mph to 60 or 65 mph.  However, several continue to carry the default {{convert|55|mph}} speed limit, including:
* The [[Sterling Highway]]
* The [[Tok Cut-Off]]
* The [[Haines Highway]]

The [[Dalton Highway]] and parts of the Elliot Highway are 50 mph.

Default speed limits in [[Alaska]] are:
*{{cvt|20|mph}} in alleys
*{{cvt|20|mph}} in a business district
*{{cvt|25|mph}} in a residential district
*{{cvt|55|mph}} on other roads
The speed limit when towing a mobile home is {{convert|45|mph}}.&lt;ref name="Alaska Speed Limit Rules"/&gt;

==American Samoa==

The speed limit in [[American Samoa]] is 45 mph (72 km/h), with 25-45 mph (40-72 km/h) in undivided rural areas and 20-25 mph (32-40 km/h) in residential areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frommers.com/destinations/americansamoa/3038010002.html Frommers. American Samoa. Retrieved 8 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arizona==
The default speed limit outside of "business or residential" districts in [[Arizona]] is {{convert|65|mph}}, within those districts the default speed limit is {{convert|25|mph}}. The school zone speed limit is {{convert|15|mph}}, while some may be {{convert|25 to 35|mph}}. Exceeding these limits only in the best of driving conditions is considered ''prima facie'' evidence of speeding. Altered speed limits are not ''prima facie''.&lt;ref name="State Legislature"&gt;Arizona Statutes Chapter 3 Article 6 28-701 [http://www.azleg.state.az.us/ArizonaRevisedStatutes.asp?Title=28|Arizona State Legislature]&lt;/ref&gt;

The maximum speed limit on [[Interstate Highway]]s is {{convert|75|mph}}. This limit may be applied outside of "[[Urban area#United States|urbanized areas]]", where speeds of over {{convert|85|mph}} on any highway (regardless of the posted speed limit) is considered a criminal (rather than civil) offense. However, [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|Interstate 10]] near the [[California]] border is reduced to {{convert|65|mph}}. Some portions of [[Interstate 15 in Arizona|Interstate 15]] have the same regulations due to sharp curves. There is an exception of urban highway in [[Casa Grande, Arizona|Casa Grande]], with a speed limit of {{convert|75|mph}}, while other urban highways are capped at {{convert|55 or 65|mph}}. Within "business or residential" districts, exceeding the speed limit by more than {{convert|20|mph}} is considered criminal. Within "urbanized areas", {{convert|55|mph}} speed limit citations are given for "waste of a finite resource". This exception only applies within a {{convert|10|mph|adj=on}} threshold. As long as the speed does not exceed {{convert|65|mph}}, the infraction is not recorded as a [[traffic ticket|traffic violation]] for the purposes of a [[Point system (driving)|point system]].

Non-passenger vehicles in excess of {{convert|13|ST}}, or "vehicles drawing a pole trailer" weighing more than {{convert|3|ST}} may not exceed {{convert|65|mph}} unless signs are posted that allow such a speed. Yet this does not differ from the default speed limit, and has the practical effect of requiring extra consideration for posting a standard speed limit sign in excess of {{convert|65|mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;Arizona Statutes Chapter 3 Article 6 28-709 [http://www.azleg.state.az.us/ArizonaRevisedStatutes.asp?Title=28|Arizona State Legislature]&lt;/ref&gt; A non-numeric minimum speed limit is incorporated with the basic speed rule in Arizona, which also prohibits speeds higher than would be "reasonable and prudent".&lt;ref name="State Legislature"/&gt;

Night speed limit signs are posted on some roads within [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] city limits that do not have street lights. Examples: Fort Lowell Road from Oracle Road to Country Club Road, 22nd Street from [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|Interstate 10]] to Cherry Avenue.

==Arkansas==
Urban districts by default are posted at {{cvt|30|mph}}. Outside of the municipal limits, two-lane state and federal highways have a speed limit of {{cvt|55|mph}} unless otherwise posted, and 2 lane county roads have a speed limit of {{cvt|45|mph}} unless otherwise posted. In June 2015, the [[Arkansas Highway Commission]] authorized the [[Arkansas Highway and Transportation Department]] (AHTD) to raise the speed limit on undivided 4 and 5 lane roads from {{cvt|55 to 60|mph}} while divided 4 lane roads are set to go from {{cvt|55 to 65|mph}}, these changes affect {{convert|285|miles}} of Arkansas highways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.truckinginfo.com/news/story/2012/06/some-rural-arkansas-highways-getting-higher-speed-limits.aspx|title=Some Rural Arkansas Highways Getting Higher Speed Limits|publisher=Truckinginfo.com.|date=June 15, 2012|accessdate=March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, AHTD has established freeway default speed limits. Along rural freeways the limit is {{cvt|70|mph}} while suburban freeways are posted at {{cvt|65|mph}}. School zone speed limits apply only when children are present, or when a lighted beacon is on if one is provided and such speed limits are set at {{cvt|25|mph}} unless otherwise posted.  It is fairly common however that schools serving only higher grade levels will not have a school speed limit in rural areas or where such school sits more than {{convert|500|feet}} off of the highway or street.

On March 16, 2017, the Arkansas House introduced a bill that would allow the state highway commission to increase speed limits up to 75&amp;nbsp;mph in rural interstate freeways and sets rural non-divided highway speed limits to 65&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Fort Smith/Fayetteville News|title=Proposed Bill Would Increase Speed Limits to 75 MPH|url=http://5newsonline.com/2017/03/17/proposed-bill-would-increase-interstate-speed-limits-to-75-mph/|last=Meyers|first=Shawnya|date=March 17, 2017|accessdate=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=40/29 News|url=http://www.4029tv.com/article/house-bill-2057-proposes-to-increase-speed-limit-to-75-mph-on-some-highways/9159952|last=Kee|first=Meghan|title=House Bill 2057 proposes to increase speed limit to 75 mph on some highways|date=March 20, 2017|accessdate=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=US News|title=Arkansas House Wants to Increase Speed Limit to 75 Mph|date=March 17, 2017|accessdate=March 20, 2017|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/arkansas/articles/2017-03-17/arkansas-house-wants-to-increase-speed-limit-to-75-mph}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bill became law on April 7, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2017/2017R/Pages/BillInformation.aspx?measureno=HB2057|title=Bill Information|website=www.arkleg.state.ar.us|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new 75 mph (121 km/h) speed limit doesn't apply to trucks. Trucks will still be limited to 70 mph. (Fact check, this provision was removed from act 1097.)

As of October 31, 2017, the speed limit law is being broken into four categories: rural interstates, Urban Interstates, rural divided unlimited access highways, and two lane highways. There are studies being made to increase rural interstate speed limits to 75 mph (121 km/h), urban interstate speed limits to a uniform 65 mph (105 km/h) speed limit, rural divided unlimited access highways to 65 mph (105 km/h) unless the DOT warrants a lower speed, and maintaining a 55 mph (89 km/h) speed limit with the option of increasing the limit to 60 mph (97 km/h) where higher speed limits can be warranted on two lane highways (as of July 1, 2018, no freeways in Arkansas have been increased to 75 mph).

As of July 16th, 2018, ARDOT was still considering speed limit changes. A spokesman from the department was quoted as saying "Everybody wants it, but when you're driving that much faster its more challenging to negotiate curves in the rural highways." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.thv11.com/article/news/traffic/ardot-prioritizes-safety-regarding-new-speed-limit-changes-across-the-state/91-574452278&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory behind California's 85th percentile statute is that, as a policy, most of the electorate should be seen as lawful, and limits must be practical to enforce. However, there are some circumstances where motorists do not tend to process all the risks involved, and as a mass choose a poor 85th percentile speed. This rule in substance is a process for voting the speed limit by driving; and in contrast to delegating the speed limit to an engineering expert.{{#tag:ref|Public opposition to speed limits being set by an authority, often arise because such agency has been viewed as abusing its power—such as by arbitrary indiscretion or by creating "speed traps". Because an expert can theoretically calculate a safer speed limit, than the populace's vote by driving, it is beneficial that local governments preserve strong public trust with their integrity in speed regulation. See ''A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets,'' [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials|AASHTO]], 4th Ed., 2001; {{ISBN|1-56051-156-7}} |group="Note" |name="Speed limit chosen by the people vs the expert"}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/uslimits/ USLIMITS2: A Tool to Aid Practitioners in Determining Appropriate Speed Limit Recommendations]&lt;/ref&gt;

The numerical limit set by [[California Department of Transportation|Caltrans]] [[traffic engineering (transportation)|engineers]] for speed limit signs, generally found on all non-[[limited access|controlled-access]] routes, is considered a presumptive maximum "reasonable and prudent" speed.

Many speed limit signs are identified as "maximum speed", usually when the limit is 55&amp;nbsp;mph (89&amp;nbsp;km/h) or more. When the [[National Maximum Speed Law]] was enacted, California was forced to create a new legal [[speed limit#Signage|signage]] category, "Maximum Speed", to indicate to drivers that the [[Speed limit#Basic rule: reasonable speed|Basic Speed Law]] did not apply for speeds over the federally mandated speed cap; rather, it would be a violation to exceed the fixed maximum speed indicated on the sign, regardless of whether the driver's speed could be considered "reasonable and prudent".

A driver can receive a [[traffic ticket|traffic citation]] for violating the [[Speed limit#Basic rule: reasonable speed|Basic Speed Law]] even if their speed is below the "maximum speed limit" if road, weather, or traffic conditions make that speed unsafe. However, because the Basic Speed Law establishes ''prima facie'' limits, not absolute ones, they can also defend against a citation for speeding "by competent [[evidence]] that the speed in excess of said limits did not constitute a violation of the basic speed law at the time, place and under the conditions then existing", per section 22351(b) of the California Vehicle Code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d11/vc22351.htm Speed Law Violations California Vehicle Code, section 22351(b)]. Dmv.ca.gov (May 22, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; As attorney David W. Brown says in his book ''Fight Your Ticket &amp; Win in California'', "a person traveling over the speed limit–but less than the usual 65&amp;nbsp;mph maximum speed (55&amp;nbsp;mph for two-lane undivided highways)–isn't necessarily violating the law"&lt;ref name="fytaw"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fight Your Ticket &amp; Win in California |last=Brown |first=David W. |year=2005 |edition=11th |publisher=[[Nolo.com|Nolo]] |location=Berkeley, CA |isbn=978-1-4133-0641-5 |chapter=Speed Violations and Radar |pages=4/2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5LsenQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "you can defend against a charge of violating the Basic Speed Law not only by showing you weren't exceeding the speed limit, but also by establishing that even if you were over the limit, your speed was nevertheless 'safe' under the circumstances."&lt;ref name="fytaw"/&gt;{{rp|4–10}}

However, the speed limit on the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]] and in [[San Francisco]] is only {{cvt|50|mph}}. In downtown Los Angeles, the maximum speed limit is {{cvt|55|mph}}. This includes the entire length of the [[Pasadena Freeway]] between [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] and downtown Los Angeles, and portions of the [[Hollywood Freeway|Hollywood]], [[Santa Ana Freeway|Santa Ana]], [[Santa Monica Freeway|Santa Monica]], and [[Harbor Freeway]]s. The default limit on 2-lane roads is {{cvt|55|mph}}. However, [[Caltrans]] or a local agency can post a speed of up to {{cvt|65|mph}} after an [[traffic engineering (transportation)|engineering study]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate?WAISdocID=9352382531+0+0+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve WAIS Document Retrieval]. Leginfo.ca.gov.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a {{cvt|55|mph}} speed limit for trucks with 3 or more axles and all vehicles while towing.

In California, the Maximum Speed in [[school zone]]s is {{cvt|15|or|25|mph}}, but may only be in effect when children are present within that school zone.&lt;ref name="CA prima facie limits"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CA School zone"/&gt;

==Colorado==

The maximum speed limit in [[Colorado]] is {{cvt|75|mph}} on rural Interstate highways and the toll road portion of [[Colorado State Highway 470|SH 470]] ([[E-470]]), even though  [[Interstate 70 in Colorado|Interstate 70]] in the Rocky Mountains has a {{cvt|65|mph}} limit because of steep grades and curves and a {{cvt|50|mph}} limit at the east and west ends of the [[Eisenhower Tunnel]]. The maximum speed limit on other rural highways is {{cvt|65|mph}}.

There are also basic prima facie speed limits in Colorado.&lt;ref name="Establishing Realistic Speed Limits Brochure"&gt;[http://www.coloradodot.info/library/Brochures/Establishing_Realistic_Speed_Limits_Brochure.pdf], CDOT Establishing Realistic Speed Limits Brochure.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{cvt|20|mph}} on narrow, winding mountain roads
* {{cvt|25|mph}} in any business district
* {{cvt|30|mph}} in any residential district
* {{cvt|40|mph}} on open mountain highways

===Night speed limits===
On certain stretches of rural highways, notably [[U.S. Route 160 in Colorado|US 160]] between [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] and [[Pagosa Springs, Colorado|Pagosa Springs]] and [[U.S. Route 550 in Colorado|US 550]] between Durango and [[Silverton, Colorado|Silverton]], nighttime speed limits are in effect during peak migratory periods for area wildlife. Speeding fines are doubled when nighttime speed limits are in effect.

==Connecticut==
Speed limits in [[Connecticut]] are normally {{cvt|65|mph}} on rural freeways; up to {{cvt|55|mph}} on rural divided and up to {{cvt|50|mph}} on rural undivided highways. In urban areas speed limits vary from {{cvt|25|mph}} on residential streets and central business districts, {{cvt|30 to(-) 40|mph}} on arterial roadways, and from {{cvt|45 to(-) 55|mph}} on urban freeways. [[Limited-access]] [[divided highway]]s have a minimum speed of {{cvt|40|mph}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cga.ct.gov/2005/pub/Chap248.htm#Sec14-220.htm Connecticut General Statutes §14–220] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928163416/http://www.cga.ct.gov/2005/pub/Chap248.htm#Sec14-220.htm |date=September 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is not always posted, and rarely enforced.  Connecticut was among the last states to raise its maximum speed limit from {{cvt|55|mph}} originally established by the [[National Maximum Speed Law]] in 1974.  The statewide maximum speed limit was increased from {{cvt|55|mph}} to {{cvt|65|mph}} on October 1, 1998, making Connecticut the last state in the continental United States to raise its speed limit above {{cvt|55|mph}}.

Speed limits for all roads within Connecticut—including local streets—are established by the State Traffic Commission, an agency composed of members of the [[Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles|Department of Motor Vehicles]] (CTDMV), the [[Connecticut Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection|Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection]] (DESPP), and the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] (CONNDOT).

The State Traffic Commission typically sets speed limits following engineering studies performed by CONNDOT. Data used in setting speed limits includes traffic volume vs. roadway capacity, design speed, road geometry, the spacing of intersections and/or interchanges, the number of driveways and curb cuts, and accident rates.

Municipalities are normally required to seek approval from the State Traffic Commission for changes to the posted speed limits on locally owned streets after appropriate engineering studies are performed.

Speeding fines are doubled in school zones when children are present, and construction areas when workers are present.

Prior to enactment of the National Speed Limit Law in 1974, Connecticut permitted a maximum speed limit of {{cvt|60|mph}} on rural freeways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.speed-limits.com/connecticut.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104002458/http://www.speed-limits.com/connecticut.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-11-04|title=Connecticut Speed Limit|date=2016-11-04|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 26, 2018 contractors started installing new speed limit signs on I-84 between the Waterbury/Cheshire line and the interchange with CT Route 9, increasing the speed limit to 65 mph.  This action follows a DOT study showing the 85th percentile speed of free flowing traffic on this segment averaged 77 mph.

==Delaware==
In [[Delaware]], three roads carry a {{convert|65|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} speed limit: [[Interstate 495 (Delaware)|Interstate 495]], the [[toll road]] portion of [[Delaware Route 1]] and the freeway portion of Route 1 up to exit 160 (US 40), and [[Interstate 95 in Delaware|Interstate 95]] from the Maryland line to the southern junction with I-495. The remainder of [[Interstate 95 (Delaware)|Interstate 95]] between the southern junction with I-495 and the [[Pennsylvania]] line and the freeway portion of [[Delaware Route 141]] are {{convert|55|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} while I-295 is {{convert|50|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Prior to the National Maximum Speed Law that went into effect nationwide, I-95 used to have a {{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} speed limit except around Wilmington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scrapbook 1969 - 1988 |publisher=Delaware Public Archives |format=PDF |url=http://archives.delaware.gov/exhibits/document/scrapbooks/turnpike3/scrapbook.pdf}}{{page needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, the state of Delaware increased the speed limit on Interstate 95 from {{convert|55|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} to {{convert|65|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} between the Maryland state line and the I-495 interchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Montgomery |first=Jeff |title=Coming to Delaware's I-95: 65 mph speed limit(this occurred from May 18 to May 21, 2015) |work=The News Journal |location=Wilmington, DE |date=February 25, 2015 |url=http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/traffic/2015/02/24/delaware-speeds/23953659/ |accessdate=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, the speed limit on Delaware Route 1 between Trap Shooters Road and the [[Puncheon Run Connector]] in [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]] was increased from {{convert|55|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} to {{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} while the speed limit on the Puncheon Run Connector was increased from {{convert|50|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} to {{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=TRAFFIC ALERT - State Route 1 and Puncheon Run Connector Speed Limit Increases|publisher=Delaware Department of Transportation|date=January 3, 2017|url=http://www.deldot.gov/home/newsroom/release.shtml?id=6373|accessdate=January 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All rural two-lane state-owned roads have {{convert|50|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} speed limits, while all urban speed limits, regardless of location, are held at {{convert|25|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} for two-lane roads and up to {{convert|35|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} for four-lane roads. Four lane highways such as [[U.S. Route 13 in Delaware|US 13]], [[U.S. Route 113|US 113]], portions of [[U.S. Route 40 in Delaware|US 40]] near [[Bear, Delaware|Bear]] and [[Glasgow, Delaware|Glasgow]], and the at-grade portions of DE 1 are normally {{convert|55|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.

[[School zone]]s have {{convert|20|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} speed limits.

[[Interstate 495 (Delaware)|Interstate 495]], which forms a bypass around [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], features [[variable speed limit]] signs for environmental purposes. These signs typically display a {{convert|65|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} speed limit, but this limit changes to {{convert|55|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on days when [[air quality]] is a concern. The limit is also lowered during construction, weather conditions, and when accidents occur.

All neighborhoods and subdivisions in Delaware have a maximum speed limit of {{convert|25|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} as set by state law. Frequent [[advertising campaigns]] on in-state radio stations remind residents of this (as of January 2013).{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Florida==
Florida has a maximum speed limit of {{cvt|70|mph}}, found on [[Controlled-access highway|freeways]], including rural [[Interstate Highway]]s, some urban freeways including [[Interstate 4|I-4]] in [[Lakeland, Florida|Lakeland]], [[Interstate 75 in Florida|I-75]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] and [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] (where I-75 ends), [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]] near [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]] and from Military Trail to Florida State Route 706 in [[Palm Beach County, Florida|Palm Beach County]], portions of the [[Orlando]] area Toll Roads such as [[Florida State Road 417|SR 417]] and [[Florida State Road 429|SR 429]], [[Florida's Turnpike]] through [[Port St Lucie]] and Orlando, [[Interstate 10 in Florida|I-10]] close to [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]], and most other rural [[limited access]] [[toll road]]s such as the [[Suncoast Parkway]] and the [[Beachline Expressway]] and rural portions of Florida's Turnpike. {{cvt|65|mph}} is typical on rural 4-lane highways (such as [[U.S. Route 19 in Florida|US-19]] north of [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], among other [[US Highways]]) as well as most other urban freeways and tollways. Rural two-lane roads typically have a speed limit of {{cvt|55|mph}} (the default limit for such roads), although [[FDOT]] is permitted to post {{cvt|60|mph}} on appropriately-suited highways. This is typically done on very rural state roads (such as [[Florida State Road 471|SR 471]]) and US Highways (such as [[U.S. Route 98 in Florida|US 98]] along most of the state's [[Florida Panhandle|panhandle]]).

Florida typically does not post night speed limits, but there are a few exceptions. For the most part, these night time reduced speeds are located in [[wildlife preserve]]s for such [[endangered species]] as the [[Florida panther]] and the [[key deer]]. Most of the [[Tamiami Trail]] through the [[Big Cypress National Preserve]] has a {{cvt|45|mph}} night speed limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sherpaguides.com/florida/everglades/tamiami_trail_miami.html |title=Tamiami Trail—Miami to the Western Everglades |accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On some stretches of road where the speed limit is reduced at night, the daytime speed limit sign is non-reflective, such that at night, only the night limit is visible.

Florida's minimum speed limit on Interstate Highways is {{cvt|50|mph}} in 70&amp;nbsp;mph zones. In 55&amp;nbsp;mph, and 65&amp;nbsp;mph urban interstate zones, the minimum is {{cvt|40|mph}}. At one time, these minimum speeds required signage, but these limits have since been codified in state law; signs indicating these minimum speeds still exist, but now simply serve as a reminder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0300-0399/0316/Sections/0316.183.html Statutes &amp; Constitution :View Statutes : Online Sunshine]. Leg.state.fl.us.&lt;/ref&gt; Urban freeways with speed limits of 50&amp;nbsp;mph typically do not have minimum speed limits, such as on [[Interstate 375 (Florida)|I-375]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]]. Additionally, the new [[Gandy Freeway]] in St Petersburg has a speed limit as low as {{cvt|45|mph}}.

Florida also does not impose lower truck speed limits. As such, all traffic is permitted to travel at the same speed.&lt;ref name="Florida Motorist Information"&gt;{{cite web |title=Florida Motorist Information |url=http://www.motorists.org/chapters/florida |publisher=National Motorists Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[School zone]]s in Florida usually have {{cvt|10-20|mph}} limits. Most have flashing yellow lights activated during the times they are in effect as well as accompanying signs that post the times these reduced speed limits are effective. All are strictly enforced and carry an increased penalty for violations.

==Georgia==
Rural [[List of Interstate Highways in Georgia (U.S. state)|Interstate Highways]] are posted at {{cvt|70|mph}}. Until 2014, sections of Interstates passing through a municipality or metropolitan area with a population over fifty thousand were capped at {{cvt|55-65|mph}}. However, a new law has permitted urban interstates to now be posted as high as 70&amp;nbsp;mph,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=May 29, 2014 |title=New Georgia laws could bump up urban speeds, limit left lane use |author=Keith Goble |work=Land Line |url=http://www.landlinemag.com/Story.aspx?StoryID=27097}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some have already reflected this change, such as [[Interstate 95 in Georgia|I-95]] through [[Brunswick, Georgia|Brunswick]], [[Interstate 85 in Georgia|I-85]] in [[Gwinnett County, Georgia|Gwinnett County]], and [[Interstate 75 in Georgia|I-75]] in [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]], [[Valdosta, Georgia|Valdosta]], and [[Tifton, Georgia|Tifton]]. Most urban interstates, however, still remain at or below 65&amp;nbsp;mph. [[Interstate 285 in Georgia|I-285]] in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area|Atlanta area]] was recently increased from {{cvt|55|mph}} to {{cvt|65|mph}} (with [[Variable speed limit]]s on the north portion). I-95 and [[Interstate 16 in Georgia|I-16]] through suburban [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] (the 65&amp;nbsp;mph limit on I-95 is only for a 1.5 mile section in the vicinity of the I-16 interchange), I-16 from the interchange with [[Interstate 75 in Georgia|I-75]] in central [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]] eastbound past Exit 2 is at 65&amp;nbsp;mph, and [[Interstate 185 in Georgia|I-185]] in [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]] remain at 65&amp;nbsp;mph, while the [[Downtown Connector]] and portions of [[Interstate 20 in Georgia|I-20]] in [[Atlanta]] are posted as low as {{cvt|50|mph}}. Most non-interstate freeways such as [[Georgia State Route 400|SR 400]] and the [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]] perimeter highway, are posted at 55 to 65&amp;nbsp;mph.

Four lane arterials and expressways can be posted as high as {{cvt|65|mph}}. However, [[John Forrest Dillon|Dillon's Rule]] enables counties outside municipalities to keep four-lane GRIP corridors at {{cvt|55|mph}}. However, in recent years, [[U.S. Route 1 in Georgia|US 1]] between Augusta and Wrens raised the speed limit to 65&amp;nbsp;mph. Other rural four-lane highways with a 65&amp;nbsp;mph include portions of [[U.S. Route 441 in Georgia|US 441]] near [[Irwinton, Georgia|Irwinton]], [[U.S. Route 25 in Georgia|US 25]] between [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]] and [[Statesboro, Georgia|Statesboro]], [[Georgia State Route 88|SR 88]] between [[Sandersville, Georgia|Sandersville]] and [[Wrens, Georgia|Wrens]], [[Georgia State Route 16|SR 16]] between [[Griffin, Georgia|Griffin]] and I-75, much of [[U.S. Route 341 in Georgia|US 341]] between [[Brunswick, Georgia|Brunswick]] and I-75, and much of [[U.S. Route 82 in Georgia|US 82]] in South Georgia.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Two lane state roads by default are posted at {{cvt|55|mph}}. County maintained roads will rarely have speed limits above {{cvt|50|mph}} in middle &amp; south Georgia, {{cvt|45|mph}} in north Georgia. Both in the Atlanta area, [[Ronald Reagan Parkway]] is posted at {{cvt|50|mph}} as a county maintained freeway and [[Sugarloaf Parkway]] is posted at {{cvt|55|mph}} along its new eastern freeway portion.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Inside the municipality, speed limits are generally posted at {{cvt|35|mph}} while it is {{cvt|25–30|mph}} in the downtown area.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

All roadways maintained by GDOT that are subject to speed limit reductions are given advanced notice with signage that says "REDUCED SPEED AHEAD". Furthermore, GDOT has a policy of doing {{cvt|5-10|mph}} increments but never higher than 10&amp;nbsp;mph.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Georgia is one of few states with anti-speed trap laws passed in the late 1990s. Speed violations less than {{cvt|15|mph}} over the speed limit will have no points assessed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dds.ga.gov/drivers/DLdata.aspx?con=1749471757&amp;ty=dl Points and Points Reduction] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814060529/http://www.dds.ga.gov/drivers/DLdata.aspx?con=1749471757&amp;ty=dl# |date=August 14, 2014 }}. Dds.ga.gov (October 4, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Fines are not assessed for motorists going less than {{cvt|10|mph}} over the speed limit. In 2009, Georgia introduced the "Super Speeder" law, which adds an additional speeding fine of $200 for motorists convicted of traveling {{cvt|75|mph}} or more on a two-lane or undivided road and {{cvt|85|mph}} or more on a divided highway.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Guam==

The speed limit in [[Guam]] is 45 mph (72 km/h), with 35-45 mph (56-72 km/h) in undivided  rural areas and 35 mph (56 km/h) in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gov.gu/compileroflaws/GCA/16gca/16gc003.PDF {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325115518/http://www.justice.gov.gu/compileroflaws/GCA/16gca/16gc003.PDF# |date=March 25, 2009 }} ''Justice.gov.gu.'' Retrieved 8 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hawaii==
Hawaii was the last state to raise its maximum speed limit after the [[National Maximum Speed Law]] was repealed in 1995, and still has the lowest maximum speed limit of any state. In 2002, following public outcry after a controversial experiment with [[speed limit#Enforcement|speed enforcement]] using [[traffic enforcement camera]]s, the state [[Hawaii Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] raised the speed limit to {{cvt|60|mph}} on [[Interstate H-1]] between [[Kapolei, Hawaii|Kapolei]] and [[Waipahu, Hawaii|Waipahu]], and [[Interstate H-3]] between the [[Tetsuo Harano Tunnels]] and the junction with H-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Rod Antone |title=State approves higher speed limits |url=http://starbulletin.com/2002/04/18/news/story5.html |newspaper=Honolulu Star-Bulletin |date=April 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; All other freeways, including [[Interstate H-2]], have a maximum speed limit of {{cvt|55|mph}}, with the limit dropping to {{cvt|45|mph}} in central [[Honolulu]]. Other highways generally have speed limits of 55&amp;nbsp;mph and in many cases much less.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaiihighways.com/FAQs-page2.htm#speed-limit FAQs page 2]. Hawaii Highways.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 6, 2016, Governor David Ige has signed a bill to allow the Speed Limit on Saddle Road to increase from 55&amp;nbsp;mph to 60&amp;nbsp;mph (the limit was increased to 60&amp;nbsp;mph the week of February 5, 2017).&lt;ref&gt;http://hawaiitribune-herald.com/news/local-news/ige-ok-s-higher-speed-limit-saddle-road&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawaii has a minimum speed along much of [[Interstate H-1]] of only {{cvt|10|mph}} below the speed limit. The minimum speed is usually {{cvt|45|mph}} when the speed limit is 55, and {{cvt|40|mph}} when the speed limit is 50.

==Idaho==

The speed limit on a freeway in Idaho is generally {{cvt|80|mph}} in rural areas and {{cvt|65|mph}} in urban areas. Trucks are limited to {{cvt|70|mph}}. Generally, both single- and multi-lane rural roads have {{cvt|70|mph}} limits. Roads with traffic lights are posted at {{cvt|60|mph}} or below. The school zone speed limit in Idaho is {{cvt|20|mph}}.

Idaho senator [[Bart Davis]] brought SB 1284a to the [[Idaho House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] for discussion in early 2014. The bill passed the [[Idaho Senate|Senate]] on February 25 and was signed into law by Governor [[Butch Otter]] on March 18, 2014, which was set to raise the speed limit on rural interstates to {{cvt|80|mph}} on July 1, 2014, the same date [[Wyoming]] raised its speed limit. Days before the law was to go into effect, however, it was put on hold in order to allow a more thorough review of the effects of a raised speed limit.&lt;ref name="New speed"&gt;{{cite web |title=80 mph speed limit law delayed |url=http://www.kboi2.com/news/local/Idaho-Speed-Limit-264926731.html |publisher=KBOI |accessdate=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A vote on July 14, 2014 approved the 80&amp;nbsp;mph increase on limited sections of interstates in the southern portions of Idaho.

On March 22, 2017 the speed limit on a four-lane, divided stretch of [[U.S. Route 20 in Idaho|US 20]] between [[Idaho Falls, Idaho|Idaho Falls]] and [[Ashton, Idaho|Ashton]] was raised from {{cvt|65|mph}} to 70&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Post Register|url=http://www.postregister.com/articles/news-daily-email-todays-headlines/2017/03/20/speed-limit-raises-70-mph-us-20-stretch#|last=Johnson|first=Lindsey|title=Speed limit raises to 70 mph on U.S. 20 stretch|date=March 20, 2017|accessdate=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Clearwater Tribune|url=http://www.clearwatertribune.com/news/online_only_news/speed-limit-on-section-of-u-s-increases-to-mph/article_b1a93c8a-0d92-11e7-adc7-27412fd5c40e.html|title=Speed limit on section of U.S. 20 increases Wednesday|date=March 20, 2017|accessdate=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.localnews8.com/news/speed-limit-changes/404486981|publisher=Local News 8|title=ITD changing Hwy. 20 speed limit this week|last=Kassahun|first=Pheben|date=March 20, 2017|accessdate=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illinois==
[[Interstate Highway]]s in [[Illinois]] are usually posted with both minimum and maximum speed limits, except in some urban areas, particularly Chicago. The standard speed limit is 70&amp;nbsp;mph for rural freeways, a 45&amp;nbsp;mph minimum speed limit, 65&amp;nbsp;mph for other 4 lane divided highways, and 55&amp;nbsp;mph for all other highways. Urban freeway/interstate speed limits can range from as low as 45&amp;nbsp;mph in downtown Chicago, where all the major interstates merge, to as high as 65&amp;nbsp;mph in the outer portions of the Chicago metro and East St. Louis metro areas, and in some smaller cities. Some interstates in small cities (e.g. I-55/74 through Bloomington-Normal, I-39/90 through the Rockford area, I-57 &amp; I-74 through Champaign-Urbana) do not have reduced speed limits, and a stretch of I-355 between I-55 and I-80 in the southwest suburbs of Chicago is signed at 70&amp;nbsp;mph. Most freeways and interstates in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook]], [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage]], and [[Lake County, Illinois|Lake]] Counties, and some interstates and freeways in [[Will County, Illinois|Will County]] maintain a 55-60&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Public Act 098-1126 |publisher=Illinois General Assembly |url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=098-1126 |date=January 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high population density, the only freeways in Cook County that exceed a speed limit of 60&amp;nbsp;mph are [[Interstate 57 in Illinois|I-57]] at the southern edge of the county, part of [[Interstate 80|I-80]] between Central Ave and Harlem Ave, and the southern segment of [[Interstate 355|I-355]], which passes through Cook County briefly before crossing into Will County to both the north and south.

On February 10, 2017, a bill was introduced to raise the speed limit on select rural interstate freeways and highways to 75&amp;nbsp;mph. The bill also contains a provision to increase maximum speed limits to 60 mph for all rural highways, roads, and streets that do not have 4 or more lanes of traffic.  This bill and one filed in 2018 died in the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=WQAD News 8|title=Proposed Illinois law looking to raise speed limit on interstates|last=Hepner|first=Christina|url=http://wqad.com/2017/02/19/proposed-illinois-law-looking-to-raise-speed-limit-on-interstates/|date=February 19, 2017|accessdate=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Status of SB2036|url=http://ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?GA=100&amp;DocTypeID=SB&amp;DocNum=2036&amp;GAID=14&amp;SessionID=91&amp;LegID=105516|website=Illinois General Assembly|accessdate=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indiana==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
In [[Indiana]] speed limits on [[Interstate Highway]]s are usually {{cvt|70|mph|0}} for cars and {{cvt|65|mph|0}} for trucks with a [[gross weight|gross vehicular weight (GVW)]] of {{convert|26000|lb}} or greater. In urban areas, it is generally {{cvt|55|mph|0}}, except stretches of [[Interstate 70 (Indiana)|Interstate 70]] in [[Indianapolis]] where it is {{cvt|50|mph|0}}. In suburban areas, it is {{cvt|65|mph|0}} for cars and {{cvt|60|mph|0}} for trucks.

Most non-Interstate Highways are {{cvt|55|mph|0}}, but some rural four-lane [[divided highway]]s are set at {{cvt|60|mph|0}}. These limits often decrease to {{cvt|30|-|50|mph|0}} approaching urban areas, and within cities a speed limit of {{cvt|20|-|30|mph|0}} is not uncommon, though larger [[arterial road]]s within cities may reach as high as {{cvt|45|mph|0}}.
On February 6, 2012 the Indiana toll road was raised from the Illinois state line to mile marker 20 to {{cvt|70|mph|0}} after a major highway reconstruction project.

==Iowa==
In [[Iowa]], the majority of highways have a {{convert|55|mph|abbr=on|adj=on|round=5}} speed limit. Rural Interstate Highways carry a {{convert|70|mph|abbr=on|adj=on|round=5}} limit and a {{convert|40|mph|abbr=on|adj=on|round=5}} minimum. Urban Interstate limits generally range from {{convert|55|to|65|mph|abbr=on|round=5}}, but may be lower in areas. The [[Interstate 74 Bridge]] from [[Bettendorf, Iowa|Bettendorf]] to [[Moline, Illinois]], for instance, has a {{convert|50|mph|abbr=on|adj=on|round=5}} limit because the bridge is narrow and has no shoulders. Four-lane roads may have a {{convert|65|mph|abbr=on|adj=on|round=5}} limit. If the road is built to [[Interstate Highway standards|freeway standards]], such as [[U.S. Highway 20 in Iowa|US&amp;nbsp;20]] between [[Interstate 35 in Iowa|I-35]] and [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]], it may have a minimum speed limit, but otherwise four-lane roads carry no minimum limit so slow-moving farm vehicles may use the roadway.

On February 21, 2017, a bill was introduced to raise speed limits from 70&amp;nbsp;mph to 75&amp;nbsp;mph on interstate freeways, however it was not enacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mitchell|first=Scimidt|title=Measure would raise Iowa interstate speed limit to 75 mph|url=http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/government/bill-aims-to-raise-iowa-interstate-speed-limit-to-75-mph-20170221|publisher=The Gazette|date=February 21, 2017|accessdate=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kansas==
After the National Maximum Speed Limit was repealed, [[Kansas]] raised its general interstate speed limit to {{Convert|70|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}; a study found "no statistically significant increases in crash, fatal crash and fatality rates were noted during the after period on either rural or urban interstate highway networks. On the other hand, statistically significant increases in crash, fatal crash and fatality rates were observed on the 2-lane rural highway network.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ntl.bts.gov/lib/11000/11100/11138/KSU983.pdf Text-i-ii-pages.PDF]. (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Governor [[Sam Brownback]] signed legislation raising Kansas' top speed limit to {{Convert|75|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on Rural Interstates and limited access portions of U.S. Routes, effective July 1, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top Kansas Speed Limit Rising |date=April 20, 2011 |newspaper=The Wichita Eagle |url=http://www.kansas.com/2011/04/20/1815851/top-kansas-speed-limit-rising.html }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kansas Department of Transportation]] announced on June 21, 2011, that 807 miles of roadway, comprising the rural areas of I-70, I-35, I-135, the [[Kansas Turnpike]] and the freeway-improved sections of US-69 and US-81, will be raised to 75&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Kansas routes designated for 75 mph speed limit |date=June 21, 2011 |publisher=Kansas Department of Transportation |url=http://www.ksdot.org/PDF_Files/Kansas-routes-designated-for-75-mph-speed-limit.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other four-lane, non-limited access divided highways have a speed limit of 70&amp;nbsp;mph, with 65&amp;nbsp;mph on two-lane undivided roads, and 55&amp;nbsp;mph on township roads. Prior to the National Maximum Speed Limit, the speed limit on the Kansas Turnpike used to be {{Convert|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, but was reduced to 75&amp;nbsp;mph on August 17, 1970. The minimum speed limit on Kansas Interstates is 40&amp;nbsp;mph.

==Kentucky==
[[Kentucky]] generally has a 70&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit on rural freeways as of 2007. The speed limit is reduced to 55 on multi-lane highways in some urban areas (I-71/[[Interstate 75 in Kentucky|75]] south of [[Cincinnati]], [[Interstate 64 in Kentucky|I-64]], [[Interstate 65 in Kentucky|I-65]], [[Interstate 71|I-71]] and [[Interstate 264 (Kentucky)|I-264]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], and [[KY 4]] in Lexington. There are two 50&amp;nbsp;mph areas in Louisville. One approaching the [[Sherman Minton Bridge]] crossing the [[Ohio River]] into [[Indiana]] on I-64, and one approaching the [[John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge|Kennedy Bridge]] on I-65 towards [[Indiana]]. The Transportation Cabinet is now authorized to raise any multilane, divided rural highway up to 65 MPH based on speed and design studies. Anyone may request an increase by contacting their local Transportation Cabinet office and specifying the roadway to be raised. Two-lane, undivided highways are limited to 55 MPH. Points are not assessed for speeds less than 10&amp;nbsp;mph over the speed limit only on limited access highways, or for tickets received by Kentucky licensed drivers out of state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kentucky Driver Manual |url=http://www.kentuckystatepolice.org/pdf/2011_ky_drivers_manual.pdf}}{{page needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A speed limit of 60&amp;nbsp;mph is posted on I-10 in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]], [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], and from [[LaPlace, Louisiana|LaPlace]] to [[New Orleans]], I-12 in Baton Rouge, I-20 in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] and [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]], I-49 in [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]] and Shreveport, I-310 in [[Destrehan, Louisiana|Destrehan]], I-220 in Shreveport, U.S. Routes [[U.S. Route 71|71]] and [[U.S. Route 167|167]] in [[Kingsville, Louisiana|Kingsville]], [[LA 3132]], and Interstates [[Interstate 110 (Louisiana)|110]], [[Interstate 210 (Louisiana)|210]], [[Interstate 510 (Louisiana)|510]], [[Interstate 610 (Louisiana)|610]], and [[Interstate 910 (Louisiana)|910]] (note: part of I-10 in Baton Rouge was raised to 70&amp;nbsp;mph, and part of I-12 in Baton Rouge was also raised to 65&amp;nbsp;mph).

Most two-lane highways in Louisiana have a maximum speed limit of 55&amp;nbsp;mph.

In August 2003, [[Murphy J. Foster, Jr.|Governor Mike Foster]] announced speed and lane restrictions on trucks on the 18&amp;nbsp;mile (29&amp;nbsp;km) stretch of [[Interstate 10]] known as the [[Atchafalaya Swamp Freeway]]. The restrictions lower the truck speed limit to 55&amp;nbsp;mph and restrict them to the right lane for the entire length of the elevated freeway.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061210110628/http://www.dps.state.la.us/tiger/lowerspdlimitsandlaneresttrucksI10.htm Lower Speed Limits and Lane Restrictions for Trucks on I-10 over Atchafalaya Basin]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other laws===
There are exceptions to the basic highway and speed laws&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/enforce/speedlaws501/toc/laspeed.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507042656/http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/enforce/speedlaws501/toc/laspeed.pdf# |date=May 7, 2014 }} -Louisiana divided highway speed limit.&lt;/ref&gt;

R.S. 32:64(A)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A person, who is operating a motor vehicle on a multilane highway at less than the normal speed of traffic, shall drive in the right-hand lane then available for traffic. R.S. 32:71(B)(1)

==Maine==
Maine carries the highest speed limit on the East Coast, with [[Interstate 95 in Maine|Interstate 95]] carrying a 75&amp;nbsp;mph limit between [[Old Town, Maine|Old Town]] and [[Houlton, Maine|Houlton]]. Sections of I-95 south of Old Town as well as [[Interstate 295 (Maine)|295]] carry 70&amp;nbsp;mph limits, except for brief 50-65 zones in more populated areas (NOTE: the speed limit on I-295 was recently restored to 65&amp;nbsp;mph between Falmouth and Topsham as of March 27, 2017). The [[Saco, Maine|Saco]] stub [[Interstate 195 (Maine)|I-195]] is 60&amp;nbsp;mph, and [[Interstate 395 (Maine)|I-395]] is 60&amp;nbsp;mph in [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]] and 65&amp;nbsp;mph in [[Brewer, Maine|Brewer]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Default speed limits in Maine are:
* 20&amp;nbsp;mph in a school zone within 30 minutes of the beginning or end of a school day, or during recess
* 20&amp;nbsp;mph near an intersection "when the operator's view is obstructed", unless [[right-of-way]] is given via signage
* 25&amp;nbsp;mph in business or residential districts, or other built-up areas
* 45&amp;nbsp;mph on other roads

In Maine, [[School Bus|school buses]] may not exceed 45&amp;nbsp;mph on roads with higher speed limits while transporting students. At other times, the limit is 55&amp;nbsp;mph, unless on an [[Interstate highway]], in which case the posted limit applies.

Also the speed limit  on county road is 30 MPH
Fines for speeding are at least $50 by law. Exceeding the speed limit by 30&amp;nbsp;mph or more is considered a [[criminal offense]].

==Maryland==
The speed limit on [[Maryland]]'s Interstate Highways are posted by default at 65&amp;nbsp;mph although 70&amp;nbsp;mph limits can be posted after a traffic and engineering study. Effective October 1, 2015 the speed limit on [[Interstate 68|I-68]] is 70&amp;nbsp;mph except for a seven-mile section around [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]]. Effective April 4, 2016, the speed limit on [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|I-70]] has been increased to 70&amp;nbsp;mph from the [[Pennsylvania]] state line to [[Maryland Route 180|MD 180]] in [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]] and from [[Maryland Route 144|MD 144]] in Frederick County to [[U.S. Route 29 in Maryland|US 29]] in [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard County]].&lt;ref name=wbal&gt;{{cite news|title=Speed limit increases to 70 mph on parts of I-70|publisher=WBAL-TV|location=Baltimore, MD|date=April 4, 2016|url=http://www.wbaltv.com/news/speed-limit-increases-to-70-mph-on-parts-of-i70/38856414|accessdate=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maryland's urban freeways normally have speed limits of 55&amp;nbsp;mph (like [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|I-495]]) or 60&amp;nbsp;mph, although some stretches are signed for 65&amp;nbsp;mph travel such as portions of [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]] and [[Interstate 97|I-97]] in and around the [[Baltimore]] suburbs, I-70 around Frederick, and I-81 around Hagerstown. I-70 around Hagerstown is posted at 70&amp;nbsp;mph. More restrictive limits are found on [[Interstate 83|I-83]] south of [[North Avenue (Baltimore)|North Avenue]] when approaching [[downtown Baltimore]] and on I-68 through Cumberland, both sections being marked at 40&amp;nbsp;mph.

Four lane non-interstates and non-freeways are posted at 55&amp;nbsp;mph. This includes the expressway grade roadways like [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|US 50]] and [[U.S. Route 301 in Maryland|US 301]] east of the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]], [[U.S. Route 15 in Maryland|US 15]] north of Frederick to the Pennsylvania state line, [[Maryland Route 404|MD 404]] around [[Denton, Maryland|Denton]] and US 29 between I-495 and I-70.

Normally, speed limit drops are in 5&amp;nbsp;mph to 10&amp;nbsp;mph increments. However, one speed zone drops from 55 to 25&amp;nbsp;mph along US 301 southbound at the [[Nice Bridge]] for the toll plaza.

Two lane roads are generally posted at 50&amp;nbsp;mph but there are a handful of routes posted at 55&amp;nbsp;mph. It is more common to see 55&amp;nbsp;mph on the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]] and in Frederick and [[Carroll County, Maryland|Carroll]] counties than the [[Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area|Baltimore-Washington corridor]] and [[Western Maryland]]. Two lane routes that have a speed limit of 55 mph enforce mandatory headlight use.

Urban and downtown speed limits are generally posted at 30&amp;nbsp;mph.

==Massachusetts==
As prescribed by Massachusetts law,&lt;ref&gt;{{M.G.L.|90|17}}&lt;/ref&gt; default speed limits are the following:

*{{convert|15|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in the area of a vehicle (for example, an ice cream truck) that is selling merchandise and is displaying flashing amber lights
*{{convert|20|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in a school zone when children are present
*{{convert|30|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on a road in a "thickly settled" or business district for at least {{convert|1/8|mi|m}}
*{{convert|40|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on a road outside of a "thickly settled" or business district for at least {{convert|1/4|mi|m}}
*{{convert|50|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on a divided highway outside of a "thickly settled" or business district for at least {{convert|1/4|mi|m}}

State highways and other arterials are often posted at {{cvt|35 to(-) 40|mph}} in urban areas and {{cvt|45 to(-) 50|mph}} in rural areas. A select number of undivided roads are posted at {{cvt|55|mph}}.  Divided highways are usually posted at {{cvt|45 to(-) 55|mph}} in rural areas as well as business districts. [[List of Interstate Highways in Massachusetts|Interstate highways]] and some non-Interstate [[controlled-access highway]]s in suburban and rural areas are posted at {{cvt|65|mph}}, but many non-Interstate highways are posted at {{cvt|55|mph}}, such as the freeway portions of [[U.S. Route 3 in Massachusetts|US 3]], [[U.S. Route 6 in Massachusetts|US 6]], [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]], and [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]], or {{cvt|60|mph}}, such as [[Massachusetts Route 3]] South of Boston. Urban freeways are often posted at {{cvt|55|mph}} and occasionally lower, but some rural freeways that pass through urban areas maintain their {{cvt|65|mph}} speed limit, such as the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] through the [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] and [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map|last=Carr|first=John|title=Map of Massachusetts speed limits|url=http://www.mit.edu/~jfc/maps/speed/Speed-Limits.gif|format=GIF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "thickly settled district" is an area where building structures such as residential and commercial are less than {{convert|200|ft|m}} apart for a distance of {{convert|1|mi|km}} or more. This can be subjective since a large part of eastern Massachusetts is built up with many different jurisdictions and different speed limits assigned.

==Michigan==
The maximum speed limit in [[Michigan]] is {{cvt|75|mph}}. Michigan uses a formula based on the number of driveways and streets, or on the 85th percentile of free-flowing traffic, and if none those methods are used a {{cvt|55|mph}} default applies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NMA Michigan |url=http://blog.motorists.org/how-to-fight-a-michigan-speeding-ticket/ |publisher=National Motorist Association |accessdate=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rural areas, speed limits are as follows:

* Freeway speeds for passenger vehicles range from {{cvt|70|mph}} to {{cvt|75|mph}}.
* Freeway speeds for trucks and military vehicles is {{cvt|65|mph}}.
* Non-freeway speeds for passenger vehicles and trucks range from {{cvt|55|mph}} to {{cvt|65|mph}}.

Freeways in Michigan are usually signed with both minimum and maximum speeds. By default, the freeway speed limit is {{cvt|70|mph}}, with a minimum speed of {{cvt|55|mph}} for all vehicles, despite a truck speed limit of {{cvt|65|mph}}—effectively permitting trucks only a {{cvt|10|mph}} range of legal speeds.&lt;ref name=MI300.1949.IV&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(s241gx553frlpfjo2guswzuf))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&amp;objectName=mcl-300-1949-VI-SPEED-RESTRICTIONS |title=Public Michigan Vehicle code: Speed Restrictions |date=November 9, 2006 |accessdate=April 30, 2007 |work=Michigan Legislature}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mackinac Bridge]], due to its substandard design, has a speed limit of {{cvt|45|mph}} for passenger vehicles and {{cvt|20|mph}} for trucks. The [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] and the [[Michigan State Police]] may raise the speed limit to {{cvt|75|mph}} after it is deemed safe to do so.&lt;ref name="mlive.com"&gt;http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/06/state_house_approves_75_mph_sp.html&lt;/ref&gt; MDOT and the MSP announced on April 26, 2017 that the speed limit was increased to 75 mph on several Michigan freeways, including [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|I-75]] from [[Bay City, Michigan|Bay City]] to [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]] (excluding the [[Mackinac Bridge]]), [[Interstate 69 in Michigan|I-69]] from Business Loop 69 in [[Clinton County, Michigan|Clinton County]] to I-94 in [[St. Clair County, Michigan|St. Clair County]] (excluding the section in and around [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], which remains at {{cvt|70|mph}}), [[U.S. Route 127 in Michigan|US 127]] from I-69 in [[Clinton County, Michigan|Clinton County]] to I-75 in [[Crawford County, Michigan|Crawford County]] (excluding the 15-mile stretch between [[St. Johns, Michigan|St. Johns]] and [[Ithaca, Michigan|Ithaca]], which is not freeway standard), and [[US Route 131|US 131]] from [[M-57 (Michigan highway)|M-57]] in [[Kent County, Michigan|Kent County]] to the end of the freeway north of [[Manton, Michigan|Manton]].  These increases commenced on May 1, 2017 and were completed by May 15, 2017. Speed limits in freeway work zones are statutorily limited to {{cvt|60|mph}} 24 hours per day. If workers are present (and not behind a barrier wall), drivers must slow to {{cvt|45|mph}} for the workers' safety.

Michigan's speed limits on urban Interstates are typically higher than its neighboring states. For example, in the Detroit metro area, [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|I-75]] southbound enters Detroit at [[M-102 (Michigan highway)|M-102]] (8 Mile Road, exit 59) and maintains a {{cvt|70|mph}} limit all the way until the interchange with [[Interstate 94 in Michigan|I-94]] (exit 53), where the speed limit drops to {{cvt|55|mph}}. Other freeways in Detroit such as [[Interstate 94 in Michigan|I-94]] and [[Interstate 96|I-96]] also have {{cvt|55|mph}} speed limits in and around the city's downtown area, but rise to {{cvt|70|mph}} relatively soon after leaving the downtown area. In Downtown [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Interstate 196|I-196]] has a speed limit of {{cvt|65|mph}}, the only other urban Interstate Highway to have a reduced speed limit. US 131 in Grand Rapids is one of the only non-Interstate urban freeways in Michigan with a {{convert|70|mph}} speed limit, which was raised from {{convert|55|mph}} since 2013. Furthermore, speed limits in smaller cities, such as [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]], [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], and [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] (the state capital) remain at {{cvt|70|mph}}.

The default speed on all other highways, whether two or four lanes, is {{cvt|55|mph}}. However, Michigan permits speed limits of up to {{cvt|65|mph}} after a safety study concludes the higher limit is safe to implement. Until 2016, this provision only applied to four-lane divided non-limited access highways. A {{convert|20|mile|adj=on}} stretch of [[U.S. Route 127 in Michigan|US&amp;nbsp;127]] between [[St. Johns, Michigan|St. Johns]] and [[Ithaca, Michigan|Ithaca]] was posted at {{cvt|65|mph}}, as a compromise to allow a freer flow of traffic due to insufficient funds to improve the section to freeway standards. The speed limit on [[U.S. Route 2 in Michigan|US&amp;nbsp;2]] between [[Rapid River, Michigan|Rapid River]] and [[Gladstone, Michigan|Gladstone]] in the [[Upper Peninsula]] was also raised to {{cvt|65|mph}}. In Summer 2017 Speed limits began increasing to 65 mph on several select two-lane roads in both the Lower and Upper Peninsulas of Michigan, including US 2 from St. Ignace to Rapid River and M-28 from I-75 to Munising.

==Midway Atoll==
The speed limit in [[Midway Atoll]] is 15 mph (24 km/h).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.govregs.com/regulations/expand/title50_chapterI_part38_subpartC_section38.13 Midway Atoll Code. Retrieved 8 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minnesota==
A 70&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit is only allowed on [[Minnesota]]'s [[Interstate Highway System|Interstates]] outside of urban areas. A speed limit of 55&amp;nbsp;mph is typically used in urban areas where a higher speed limit might be used, but traffic congestion or other reasons require a lower speed limit. Examples include [[Interstate 94 in Minnesota|I-94]], [[Interstate 35W (Minnesota)|I-35W]] and [[Interstate 35E (Minnesota)|I-35E]] in and around [[Minneapolis]], [[Moorhead, Minnesota|Moorhead]] and [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]]. 35E goes down to a speed limit of 45&amp;nbsp;mph in some areas of Saint Paul. A speed limit of 60&amp;nbsp;mph is typically used in suburban areas such as [[Interstate 494|I-494]] and [[Interstate 694|I-694]] loops in the Twin Cities metro area.

Non-Interstate [[divided highway]]s (both freeways and [[Limited-access road|expressways]]) have speed limits of 65&amp;nbsp;mph in rural areas and up to 60&amp;nbsp;mph in urban or suburban areas (NOTE: some non-interstate divided highways have gotten speed limit increases in November 2017 such as US Route 169 in the Twin Cities Metropolitan area). Rural two lane State and US highways in Minnesota have a default speed limits of 55&amp;nbsp;mph although several 60&amp;nbsp;mph speed limits have been posted after a traffic and engineering study that will continue until 2019. County roads have speed limits of up to 55&amp;nbsp;mph for 2 lanes and 60 for divided sections.

==Mississippi==
A speed limit of 70&amp;nbsp;mph is only allowed on [[Mississippi]]'s rural freeways; only the [[Interstate Highway|Interstates]] (except [[Interstate 110 (Mississippi)|I-110]]), [[U.S. Highway 78]], [[Mississippi Highway 304]], and a portion of [[U.S. Highway 82]] have speed limits of 70&amp;nbsp;mph, with these lengths making up approximately 86% of the state's freeway mileage.

A speed limit of 65&amp;nbsp;mph is typically used on the state's four-lane divided highways, which include parts of the following roadways:
* [[U.S. Route 45]] / [[U.S. Route 45 Alternate]]
* [[U.S. Route 49]] / [[U.S. Route 49W]]
* [[U.S. Route 61]]
* [[U.S. Route 72]]
* [[U.S. Route 82]]
* [[U.S. Route 84]]
* [[U.S. Route 90]]
* [[U.S. Route 98]]
* [[U.S. Route 278]]
* [[Mississippi State Highway 15|MS 15]]
* [[Mississippi State Highway 19|MS 19]]
* [[Mississippi State Highway 25|MS 25]]
* [[Mississippi State Highway 39|MS 39]]
* [[Mississippi State Highway 57|MS 57]]
* [[Mississippi State Highway 63|MS 63]]
* [[Mississippi State Highway 67|MS 67]]
* [[Mississippi State Highway 302|MS 302]]
* [[Mississippi State Highway 605|MS 605]]
* [[Mississippi State Highway 607|MS 607]]

A speed limit of 60&amp;nbsp;mph is typically used in urban areas where a higher speed limit might be used, but traffic or geometric conditions constitute a lower speed limit, including the following areas:
* [[Interstate 20]] in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], from [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] to [[Pearl, Mississippi|Pearl]], and [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian]]
* [[Interstate 55]] from Jackson to [[Ridgeland, Mississippi|Ridgeland]]
* [[Interstate 59]] in [[Laurel, Mississippi|Laurel]] and Meridian
* [[U.S. Route 61]] in [[Tunica Resorts, Mississippi|Tunica Resorts]]
* [[U.S. Route 78]] in [[New Albany, Mississippi|New Albany]]
* [[U.S. Route 82]] in [[Columbus, Mississippi|Columbus]]

House Bill 3, passed during the 2008 First Extraordinary Session of the state legislature, permits speed limits up to {{convert|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on toll roads in the state; however, {{As of|2016|lc=on}}, no such road has been constructed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/documents/20081E/html/HB/0001-0099/HB0003SG.htm HB 3 (As Sent to Governor)].

Mississippi has a minimum speed of 30&amp;nbsp;mph on four-lane [[United States Numbered Highways|U.S. highways]] when no hazard exists. Strangely, there is no law for the minimum speed of the state's growing number of four-lane state highways. The minimum is 40&amp;nbsp;mph on Interstate Highways and on four-lane U.S. designated highways that have a 70&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://198.187.128.12/mississippi/lpext.dll?f=templates&amp;fn=fs-main.htm&amp;2.0# |title=Mississippi Code §63-3-509 |access-date=August 13, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308095040/http://198.187.128.12/mississippi/lpext.dll?f=templates&amp;fn=fs-main.htm&amp;2.0# |archive-date=March 8, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Mississippi posted minimum speed limits (40&amp;nbsp;mph) on all rural Interstates, but this minimum speed limit was already state law before then.

==Missouri==
Statutory speed limits in [[Missouri]] are as follows:
* Interstate highways and freeways in rural areas: 70&amp;nbsp;mph
* Expressways in rural areas: 65&amp;nbsp;mph (notable exceptions being the US 54 &amp; US 63 Expressways to the north of Jefferson City, which are at-grade expressways with a 70&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit)
* Interstates, freeways, and expressways in urban areas: 60&amp;nbsp;mph
* Other numbered state-maintained rural highways: 60&amp;nbsp;mph
* State lettered highways: 55&amp;nbsp;mph

Freeways are defined as: "a limited access divided highway of at least ten miles in length with four or more lanes which is not part of the federal interstate system of highways which does not have any crossovers or accesses from streets, roads or other highways at the same grade level as such divided highway within such ten miles of divided highway."

Expressways are defined as: "a divided highway of at least ten miles in length with four or more lanes which is not part of the federal interstate system of highways which has crossovers or accesses from streets, roads or other highways at the same grade level as such divided highway."

Urban Areas are defined as: "an area of fifty thousand population at a density at or greater than one thousand persons per square mile".

The highways and transportation commission may raise or lower the speed limit on these highways, but no speed limit may be set above 70&amp;nbsp;mph on a numbered highway and 60&amp;nbsp;mph on a lettered highway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moga.mo.gov/statutes/C300-399/3040000010.HTM Missouri Revised Statutes §304-010]. Moga.mo.gov (August 28, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Interstate highways have minimum speed limits of 40&amp;nbsp;mph. There have been talks of 75 mph being enforced on Interstate highways, but a bill allowing the law has yet to be enforced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moga.mo.gov/statutes/C300-399/3040000011.HTM Missouri Revised Statutes §304-011]. Moga.mo.gov (August 28, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variable speed limits===
Missouri concluded a two-year experiment with [[variable speed limit]]s along [[Interstate 270 (Illinois-Missouri)|I-270]] around [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. Digital [[traffic sign|signs]] had been erected along the freeway as well as additional signs alerting drivers about the use of variable speed limits. The limits will vary between 40 and 60&amp;nbsp;miles per hour, depending on traffic conditions, and could change by up to 5&amp;nbsp;mph every 5&amp;nbsp;minutes. These speed limits, as of January 2012, are now posted as "Advisory Speed Limits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dickerson Oxton |url=http://www.dickersonoxton.com/missouri-accidents-county-2013/ |publisher=Missouri Motor Vehicle Accidents by County in 2013.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the closure and major rebuild of [[Interstate 64 in Missouri|I-64]] in St. Louis, an additional lane was added to [[Interstate 44 in Missouri|I-44]] and [[Interstate 70 in Missouri|I-70]], and the speed limit was thus reduced to 55&amp;nbsp;mph on those roads within the St. Louis County and City. The I-64 construction has been completed, and the extra lanes were removed in 2010. In October 2010, the speed limit was restored to 60&amp;nbsp;mph on both I-44 and I-70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kmov.com/news/local/MoDOT-to-increase-speed-limit-on-I-44-in-St-Louis-County-105691118.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027132320/http://www.kmov.com/news/local/MoDOT-to-increase-speed-limit-on-I-44-in-St-Louis-County-105691118.html |archivedate=October 27, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}.

===Exceptions to the statutory limits===
Most two-lane roads with shoulders have a 60&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit in Missouri. Two-lane roads without shoulders are usually, but not always, limited to 55&amp;nbsp;mph. However, the following two-lane highways have a 65&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit when bypassing or outside of incorporated areas.
* [[U.S. Route 54|US-54]] from [[El Dorado Springs, Missouri|El Dorado Springs]] west to the [[Kansas]] state line; from the [[Missouri Route 73|MO-73]] intersection southwest of [[Macks Creek, Missouri|Macks Creek]] to just west of the [[Niangua River]] bridge; and also along the [[Mexico, Missouri|Mexico]] bypass.
* [[U.S. Route 63|US-63]] from [[Vienna, Missouri|Vienna]] south to [[Thayer, Missouri|Thayer]], near the [[Arkansas]] state line. Some of this route has three lanes, with the passing lane alternating between northbound and southbound traffic.
* [[Missouri Route 5|MO-5]] between [[Camdenton, Missouri|Camdenton]] and [[Lebanon, Missouri|Lebanon]]. This road has three lanes, with the passing lane alternating between northbound and southbound traffic.
* [[Missouri Route 43|MO-43]] from US-54 south to [[Joplin, Missouri|Joplin]]
* [[Missouri Route 96|MO-96]] from I-44 west to [[Carthage, Missouri|Carthage]]

Most rural expressways have a 65&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit, but the following have a 70&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit.
* [[U.S. Route 54|US-54]] from the south end of the [[Mexico, Missouri|Mexico]] bypass to the Route W interchange just across the [[Missouri River]] from [[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]], with the exception of the I-70 interchange area at Kingdom City, which is 45&amp;nbsp;mph. US-54 also has a 70&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit from Fall Hill Road in [[Cole County, Missouri|Cole County]] to just north of the Business Route 54 intersection in [[Lake Ozark, Missouri|Lake Ozark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.connectmidmissouri.com/news/story.aspx?id=473645#.UV4ZK5OG16g|publisher=KRGC|date=June 22, 2010|accessdate=March 19, 2017|last=Miller|first=Kermit|title=Speed limit lowered on Highway 54}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[U.S. Route 63|US-63]] from the south end of the [[Kirksville, Missouri|Kirksville]] bypass to US-54 north of [[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]], with the exception of the section through [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]] from Route B to Route AC, which is 65&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tmn.truman.edu/theindex/2013/01/16/modot-increase-route-63-speed-limit/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814041632/http://tmn.truman.edu/theindex/2013/01/16/modot-increase-route-63-speed-limit/# |date=August 14, 2014 }} Truman State University Index (January 16, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/local/state-cuts-speed-on-highway/article_4a8be01c-b958-5b1f-be5d-924cf8f8d893.html|publisher=Columbia Tribune|date=April 11, 2010|accessdate=March 19, 2017|last=David|first=Brennan|title=Sate cuts speed on highway}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Missouri Route 7|MO-7]] from [[Interstate 49 in Missouri|I-49]] to just west of [[Clinton, Missouri|Clinton]].
* The [[U.S. Route 71 in Missouri|US-71]] expressway from [[Carthage, Missouri|Carthage]] to [[Harrisonville, Missouri|Harrisonville]] had a 70&amp;nbsp;mph limit before it was upgraded to [[Interstate 49 in Missouri|I-49]].

* MO-360 and US 160 outside of the Springfield, Missouri border has an upgraded speed limit of 70 MPH from the speed limit of 60 MPH

Most Missouri [[Missouri supplemental route|lettered highways]] are 55&amp;nbsp;mph, and in densely populated areas they can be less. There are several that have a speed limit of 60&amp;nbsp;mph, though.
* [[Missouri Route M (Jefferson County)|Route M]] in Jefferson County is an expressway for most of its length, and most of the highway has a speed limit of 60&amp;nbsp;mph.
* Route A in Jefferson County, an upgraded two lane road with shoulders, has a 60&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit. Route A travels between [[Hillsboro, Missouri|Hillsboro]] and [[Festus, Missouri|Festus]].
*Route B in Boone County is mostly an upgraded two lane road with shoulders. As such, it has a 60&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit from just north of [[Columbia, MO|Columbia]] to the end of the upgraded section 1 mile south of [[Hallsville, Missouri|Hallsville]].
*Route B in Cole County is a four-lane divided highway from [[US Route 54|US 54]] to Lorenzo Greene Dr in [[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]], and is an upgraded two-lane highway with shoulders for the rest of the way south to [[Wardsville, Missouri|Wardsville]]. Both sections have a 60&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit.
*Route C in Cole County is an upgraded two-lane highway with shoulders, and has a 60&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit from just west of [[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]] to just east of [[Russellville, Missouri|Russellville]].
*Route A in Osage County follows the former routing of [[US Route 50 in Missouri|US Route 50]] from its intersection with modern-day US 50 to [[Loose Creek, Missouri|Loose Creek]]. Since the roadway is designed to the same standards as a major highway, the speed limit is 60 on that stretch of road.

In the urban areas of: [[St. Louis]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]], [[St. Joseph, Missouri|St. Joseph]], and [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]], the speed limit typically drops to 60&amp;nbsp;mph on Interstates and freeways. In addition, on I-44 in [[Rolla, Missouri|Rolla]] the speed limit is reduced to 60&amp;nbsp;mph from just west of Exit 184 to Exit 186 because of a substandard design.

Freeway speed limits in urban areas can be as low as 45 or 50&amp;nbsp;mph in a few very short sections in downtown Kansas City and St. Louis, or as high as 65&amp;nbsp;mph in the outer portions of the St. Louis, Kansas City and St. Joseph areas. The [[Cape Girardeau, Missouri|Cape Girardeau]] and [[Joplin, Missouri|Joplin]] areas have no reduced freeway speed limits, and I-435 around [[Kansas City metropolitan area|Kansas City]] has a 70&amp;nbsp;mph limit from I-35 in [[Claycomo, Missouri|Claycomo]] to the Kansas State Line around the northern and western part of the metro area.

[[Interstate 29|I-29]] in Kansas City has a limit of 70&amp;nbsp;mph north of Barry Road in Platte County to south of Highway 169 in Buchanan County where the limit drops to 65&amp;nbsp;mph. North of Frederick Road in Buchanan County the limit returns to 70&amp;nbsp;mph until the [[Iowa]] state line.

==Montana==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Speed ~]] --&gt;
As of October 1, 2015, the maximum speed limit in Montana is 80&amp;nbsp;mph. On May 5, 2015, a bill to increase Montana's rural interstate highway speed limit to 80&amp;nbsp;mph was signed into law by Governor [[Steve Bullock (Montana politician)|Steve Bullock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://helenair.com/news/politics/updated-bullock-signs-higher-mph-interstate-speed-limit-into-law/article_f47fc9aa-2fee-5459-80a1-b252331380a3.html |title=Bullock signs higher 80 mph interstate speed limit into law |work=Helena Independent Record |date=May 5, 2015 |accessdate=May 6, 2015 |author=Dennison, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasonable and prudent===
[[File:MONTANA-PR.svg|thumb|right|250px|Typical speed limit sign that one would see at the Montana state line from December 1995 to June 1999]]

In the years before the 1974 [[National Maximum Speed Law#1974—55 mph National Speed Limit|national 55&amp;nbsp;mph limit]], and for three years after the [[National Maximum Speed Law#1995—Repeal of federal limits|1995 repeal of the increased 65&amp;nbsp;mph limit]], [[Montana]] had a non-numeric "reasonable and prudent" speed limit during the daytime on most rural roads. Montana Code Annotated (MCA) Section 61-8-303 said "A person ... shall drive the vehicle ... at a rate of speed no greater than is reasonable and proper under the conditions existing at the point of operation ... so as not to unduly or unreasonably endanger the life, limb, property, or other rights of a person entitled to the use of the street or highway."

Montana law also specified a few numeric limits: a night speed limit, usually 55 or 65&amp;nbsp;mph (89–105&amp;nbsp;km/h), depending on road type; 25&amp;nbsp;mph (40&amp;nbsp;km/h) in urban districts and 35&amp;nbsp;mph (56&amp;nbsp;km/h) in construction zones.

The phrase "reasonable and prudent" is found in the language of most state speed laws. This allows prosecution under non-ideal conditions such as rain or snow when the speed limit would be imprudently fast.

===No speed limit===
On March 10, 1996,&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=MT&amp;vol=97&amp;invol=486 FindLaw for Legal Professionals – Case Law, Federal and State Resources, Forms, and Code]. Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com.&lt;/ref&gt; a Montana [[highway patrol|patrolman]] issued a [[traffic ticket|speeding ticket]] to a driver traveling at 85&amp;nbsp;mph (136&amp;nbsp;km/h) on a stretch of [[Montana Highway 200|State Highway 200]]. The 50‑year‑old driver (Rudy Stanko) was operating a 1996 [[Chevrolet Camaro]] with less than 10,000&amp;nbsp;miles (16,093&amp;nbsp;km) on the [[odometer]].&lt;!-- The preceding text is relevant because newness of the vehicle and age-implied competence of driver are relevant. Part of reasonable and prudent is whether the vehicle and driver can handle the speed. --&gt; Although the officer gave no opinion as to what would have been a reasonable speed, the driver was convicted. The driver appealed to the [[Montana Supreme Court]]. The Court reversed the conviction in case No. 97-486 on December 23, 1998; it held that a law requiring drivers to drive at a non-numerical "reasonable and proper" speed "is so [[Void for vagueness|vague]] that it violates the [[Due Process]] Clause ... of the [[Montana Constitution]]".

Effective May 28, 1999, as a result of that decision, the [[Montana State Government|Montana Legislature]] established a speed limit of 75&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdt.mt.gov/travinfo/speed_limit.shtml Official Montana Department of Transportation site]. Mdt.mt.gov (May 28, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Montana's US, State, and even Secondary roads have speed limits posted 70&amp;nbsp;mph/night:65; truck:60/night:55.
Seven years later, a research study conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a long-time advocate of the federal National Maximum Speed Law, showed Montana's 75 mph speed limit on rural Interstates was well received by motorists; traffic speed measurements taken by IIHS showed 76 percent of cars in compliance with 75 mph on those roads. IIHS also found large trucks subject to Montana's unchanged 65 mph speed limit for large trucks on rural Interstates slowed down dramatically, from a mean speed of 70 mph in 1996 to 65 mph in 2006, with the 85th percentile large truck speed dropping 11 mph, from 79 mph in 1996 to 68 mph in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Retting, Richard, and Yeoh, Eric, 2008. "Traffic Speeds on Interstates and Freeways 10 Years After Repeal of National Maximum Speed Limit." Traffic Injury Prevention 9: 119-124, p. 122, Table II. {{ISSN|1538-9588}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===75 and 80 mph speed limits===
Despite this reversal, Montana's then-governor, [[Marc Racicot]], did not convene an emergency session of the legislature. Montana technically had no speed limit whatsoever until June 1999, after the Montana legislature met in regular session and enacted a new law. The law's practical effect was to require numeric speed limits on all roads and disallow any speed limit higher than 75&amp;nbsp;mph (121&amp;nbsp;km/h).

Montana law still contains a section that says "a person shall operate a vehicle in a careful and prudent manner and at a reduced rate of speed no greater than is reasonable and prudent under the conditions existing at the point of operation, taking into account the amount and character of [[traffic congestion|traffic]], [[driver visibility|visibility]], weather, and roadway conditions." However, this is a standard clause that appears in other state traffic codes and has the practical effect of requiring a speed lower than the speed limit where a lower speed is necessary to maintain a reasonable and prudent road manner.

Montana also has limited sections of night speed limits.&lt;ref name="MT Night"&gt;{{cite web |title=61-8-303(1)(b) - Speed restrictions |url=https://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca/title_0610/chapter_0080/part_0030/section_0030/0610-0080-0030-0030.html |website=Montana Code Annotated |publisher=[[State of Montana]] |accessdate=4 July 2018 |quote=the speed limit for vehicles traveling...on any other public highway of this state is 70 miles an hour during the '''daytime''' and 65 miles an hour during the '''nighttime'''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other speed limits in Montana are 15-35&amp;nbsp;mph in a school zone,&lt;ref&gt;http://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca/61/8/61-8-310.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 30&amp;nbsp;mph in a residential district, 35-45&amp;nbsp;mph on boulevards, 55&amp;nbsp;mph on traffic-light highways, 65-70&amp;nbsp;mph on rural divided 4-lane highways, and 55-70&amp;nbsp;mph on rural 2-lane undivided highways.

==Nebraska==
The maximum speed limit in Nebraska is 75&amp;nbsp;mph on rural Interstate highways. This speed limit only applies to [[Interstate 80]] between [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]] and [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]], and west of Lincoln to the [[Wyoming]] state line, as well as the small section of [[Interstate 76 (Colorado–Nebraska)|Interstate 76]] that enters the southwestern corner of the state from [[Colorado]] to join I-80. Freeways and expressways in urban areas are posted at 65&amp;nbsp;mph. The speed limit in rural areas of Nebraska is 65&amp;nbsp;mph unless otherwise posted, although rural divided highways and [[Super two]] highways are posted at 70&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transportation.nebraska.gov/docs/speed-limit.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent change to Nebraska's speed limits was enacted on April 17, 2018&lt;ref&gt;https://nebraskalegislature.gov/bills/view_bill.php?DocumentID=33960&lt;/ref&gt;, which resulted in all maximum speed limits in the state (except those for rural Interstate highways) being raised by five miles per hour.

==Nevada==
The maximum speed limits in [[Nevada]] are {{cvt|70-80|mph}} on rural freeways, {{cvt|65-75|mph|round=10}} on other rural divided highways, {{cvt|55-70|mph|round=10}} on primary undivided roads, and {{cvt|65|mph|round=10}} on urban freeways.
* [[Interstate 15 in Nevada|I-15]] is posted {{cvt|70|mph}} south of [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] to match [[California]]'s 70&amp;nbsp;mph posted limit, and {{cvt|75|mph|round=10}} northeast of Las Vegas.
* [[U.S. Route 95 in Nevada|US 95]] north of Las Vegas is {{cvt|70|mph}}. From south of [[U.S. Route 93 in Nevada|US 93]] near [[Boulder City, Nevada|Boulder City]] south to [[Nevada State Route 163|SR 163]], it is {{cvt|75|mph|round=10}}.
* [[Interstate 80 in Nevada|I-80]] from [[Reno, Nevada]] to [[Utah]] varies from {{cvt|65-80|mph|round=10}}. Most rural sections are posted at {{cvt|75|mph|round=10}}. The sections East of Oasis to the Utah Border and between [[Fernley, Nevada|Fernley]] and [[Winnemucca, Nevada|Winnemucca]] are {{cvt|80|mph}} as of 2018 except the portion in [[Lovelock, Nevada|Lovelock]]. Mountainous sections and those laid through narrow valleys are usually {{cvt|70|mph}}. West of Reno, I-80 is posted at {{cvt|65|mph|round=10}} as it quickly transitions from suburban Reno to crossing the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] into [[California]], where the limit is also 65&amp;nbsp;mph. 
* [[U.S. Route 50 in Nevada|US 50]] from [[Lake Tahoe]] to [[Ely, Nevada|Ely]] and [[Utah]] is {{cvt|65|mph|round=10}}.
* [[Interstate 580 in Nevada|I-580]] from exit 44 to just south of exit 56 is {{cvt|70|mph}} after which it is {{cvt|65|mph|round=10}}.
* US 95, I-15, and [[Interstate 215 in Nevada|I-215]] through downtown Las Vegas are all posted at {{cvt|65|mph|round=10}}.

Prior to the imposition of the {{cvt|50 and 55|mph|round=10}} speed limit in late 1973, Nevada also had a "reasonable and proper" speed Limit (non-numeric) on most of its rural highways, both freeway and others. The speed limit on certain two-lane highways is 70&amp;nbsp;mph including US 95 to the Oregon border (where the speed limit drops to 65&amp;nbsp;mph for trucks)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=§ 811.111 Violating a speed limit |publisher=OregonLaws.org |url=http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/811.111}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on certain sections of US 6 and 50 as they cross the Nevada desert. Speed limits are 15 to 25&amp;nbsp;mph in school zones and 25 to 30&amp;nbsp;mph in residential districts. In 2015, the [[Nevada State Legislature]] voted to increase the statewide maximum speed limit to 80 mph to take effect in October of that year. However, between October 2015 and May 2017, no 80 mph speed limits were posted in the state.

On May 8th, 2017, the Nevada DOT installed 80 mph speed limit signs on the 130 mile stretch of I-80 between [[Fernley, Nevada|Fernley]] and [[Winnemucca, Nevada|Winnemucca]], excluding the [[Lovelock, Nevada|Lovelock]] (exits 106 and 107) area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/2017-legislature/nevada-freeway-speed-limit-to-get-bump-to-80-mph/|title=Nevada freeway speed limit to get bump to 80 mph|date=2017-05-03|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|access-date=2017-05-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news3lv.com/news/local/nevada-implementing-80-mph-speed-limit-on-i-80|title=Nevada implementing 80 mph speed limit on I-80|last=Press|first=Associated|work=KSNV|access-date=2017-05-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Hampshire==
[[File:Antique New Hampshire speed limit sign.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Antique New Hampshire speed limit sign]]
The highest speed limit in [[New Hampshire]] is {{convert|70|mph|kph|1|abbr=on}}. It can be found on [[Interstate 93]] from mile marker 45 to the Vermont border (excluding the [[Franconia Notch Parkway]]). All other freeways and turnpikes have a maximum of 65&amp;nbsp;mph. The minimum speed on Interstate Highways in New Hampshire is 45&amp;nbsp;mph where posted.

Provided that no hazard exists that requires lower speed, the speed of any vehicle not in excess of the limit is deemed to be ''prima facie'' lawful. The limit for "rural residential districts" and Class V highways outside the city or town compact is 35&amp;nbsp;mph. The limit for any "business or urban residence district" is 30&amp;nbsp;mph. [[School zone]]s receive a 10&amp;nbsp;mph reduction in the limit 45&amp;nbsp;minutes before and after the beginning and end of a school day. The speed limit for a road work or construction area is 10&amp;nbsp;mph lower than the normal speed limit, but not more than 45&amp;nbsp;mph, when work is in progress. The speed limit for all other locations is 55&amp;nbsp;mph. The minimum limit that a speed can be set in a rural or urban district is 25&amp;nbsp;mph.

The speed limit on [[Interstate 93]] through [[Franconia Notch State Park]] falls to 45&amp;nbsp;mph where the highway narrows to one lane in each direction, but rises back to 70&amp;nbsp;mph (in 10&amp;nbsp;mph increments going south) once the highway leaves Franconia Notch. [[Interstate 393]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] has a 55&amp;nbsp;mph posted speed limit for its entire length, with the exception of 45&amp;nbsp;mph and 35&amp;nbsp;mph zones on the westbound portion closest to the city center and the end of the highway. [[Interstate 293]]'s speed limit through downtown [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]] falls to 50&amp;nbsp;mph as it runs along the [[Merrimack River]], but increases to 55&amp;nbsp;mph on either side of the city center.

Prior to 1974, the [[Interstate 95 in New Hampshire|New Hampshire Turnpike]], along with rural sections of Interstates [[Interstate 89|89]] and 93, were posted at 70&amp;nbsp;mph.

==New Jersey==
New Jersey's only statutory speed limits are 50&amp;nbsp;mph rural, 25&amp;nbsp;mph urban. Since the state is largely suburbanized, it ranges between 25–50&amp;nbsp;mph depending the jurisdiction of the road and whether the municipality is township, village, borough or city status.

The common limited access freeway speed limit is 65&amp;nbsp;mph. However, shorter length freeways such as [[U.S. Route 202 in New Jersey|US 202]], [[New Jersey Route 15|Route 15]], and [[New Jersey Route 33|Route 33]] remain at 55&amp;nbsp;mph. In all 65&amp;nbsp;mph speed zones, the fines for speeding and other moving violations are doubled. This was the condition set for higher speed limits in New Jersey back in the late 1990s. Urban freeway speed limits are 50 to 55&amp;nbsp;mph. However, some freeways in urban areas retain a 65&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit such as the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] up to Exit 13 ([[Interstate 278]]), [[Interstate 80 in New Jersey|I-80]] from the [[Delaware Water Gap]] (Exit 4) to the [[Passaic River]] (Exit 53) and [[Interstate 78 in New Jersey|I-78]] from the [[Delaware River]] to the [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] border (Exit 55). Only the New Jersey Turnpike has variable speed limits on its entire length.

Four lane or greater state highways (often with a [[Jersey barrier|jersey divider]] or grass median) are generally posted at 55&amp;nbsp;mph (Such as [[New Jersey Route 73|Route 73]] from [[County Route 544 (New Jersey)|CR 544]] in [[Evesham Township]] to the [[Atlantic City Expressway]]). County four-lane highways and municipal maintained four-lane roads (with a jersey divider or grass median) are not posted above 50&amp;nbsp;mph.

Two-lane rural state highways and county maintained roads generally have 40 to 50&amp;nbsp;mph limits. The only two lane surface roads posted at 55&amp;nbsp;mph in New Jersey are [[County Route 539 (New Jersey)|County Route 539]], [[New Jersey Route 70|Route 70]], and [[New Jersey Route 72|Route 72]] in the [[Pine Barrens (New Jersey)|Pine Barrens]] of [[Ocean County, New Jersey|Ocean]] and [[Burlington County, New Jersey|Burlington]] Counties&lt;ref name=539SLD&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/sldiag/00000539__-.pdf |format=PDF |title=Route 539 straight line diagram |publisher=[[New Jersey Department of Transportation]] (NJDOT) |accessdate=December 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=70SLD&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/sldiag/00000070__-.pdf |format=PDF |title=Route 70 straight line diagram |publisher=NJDOT |accessdate=December 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=72SLD&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/sldiag/00000072__-.pdf |format=PDF |title=Route 72 straight line diagram |publisher=NJDOT |accessdate=December 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New Jersey Route 54|Route 54]] in [[Atlantic County, New Jersey|Atlantic County]].&lt;ref name=54SLD&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/sldiag/00000054__-.pdf |format=PDF |title=Route 54 straight line diagram |publisher=NJDOT |accessdate=December 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Route 33 Freehold Bypass section where it is a [[super two]] freeway is also 55&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref name=33SLD&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/sldiag/00000033__-.pdf |format=PDF |title=Route 33 straight line diagram |publisher=NJDOT |accessdate=December 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban two lane roads in boroughs and cities are typically 25&amp;nbsp;mph or 35&amp;nbsp;mph. Residential streets at the municipal or county level are generally posted at 25&amp;nbsp;mph speed limits in boroughs and cities. However, they can be as high as 40 to 45&amp;nbsp;mph at the county level, less likely in municipal maintained roads. Generally, anything above 40&amp;nbsp;mph becomes uncommon. However, there are a handful of 45&amp;nbsp;mph residential stretches such as Terill Road in [[Scotch Plains, New Jersey|Scotch Plains]] and Woodbridge Avenue ([[County Route 514 (New Jersey)|CR 514]]) in [[Edison, New Jersey|Edison]]. All rural non posted roads have a speed limit of 50 mph, as per state law.

School zones through urban and suburban areas on two lane roadways normally have a speed limit of 25&amp;nbsp;mph when children are present. However, this limit can be as low as 20&amp;nbsp;mph and as high as 35&amp;nbsp;mph in some areas.

==New Mexico==
With the exception of wartime, [[New Mexico]] had no default numeric speed limit until the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/rdu/slaw1949.html history of speed limits, Ibiblio, 1998]. Ibiblio.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[National Maximum Speed Law#1974—55&amp;nbsp;mph National Speed Limit|national 55&amp;nbsp;mph limit]] in 1974, the speed limit on rural [[Interstate Highway|Interstates]] was 75 miles per hour during the day and 70&amp;nbsp;mph at night. Primary highways in open areas had daytime speed limits of 70&amp;nbsp;mph and nighttime ones of 60&amp;nbsp;mph. Secondary highways in open areas had daytime speed limits of 60&amp;nbsp;mph and nighttime ones of 50&amp;nbsp;mph. Before the end of [[National Maximum Speed Law#1987 and 1988—65&amp;nbsp;mph limit|federal speed controls]], the maximum speed limit was 65&amp;nbsp;mph on Interstate routes and 55&amp;nbsp;mph elsewhere. In May 1996 legislation enacted by Governor [[Gary Johnson]] raised the absolute speed limit in New Mexico to 75&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;New Mexico Statutes Chapter 66 Article 7 Part 4 Statute 66-7-301 (and in subsequent references −303, −305, −308, −311, −316, −317) [http://www.conwaygreene.com/nmsu/lpext.dll?f=templates&amp;fn=main-h.htm&amp;2.0|New New Mexico State Legislature] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231729/http://www.conwaygreene.com/nmsu/lpext.dll?f=templates&amp;fn=main-h.htm&amp;2.0%7CNew# |date=March 3, 2016 }} or [http://www.nmlaws.org/ nmlaws.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Signs are posted on the vast majority of the mileage of Interstate routes to that effect. The default speed limit for any road where no speed limit is posted is 55&amp;nbsp;mph.

New Mexico has six major freeway facilities, which include three lengthy Interstate routes. Part of [[U.S. Route 70 in New Mexico|US-70]] (as a [[divided highway]]) between [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] and [[Alamogordo, New Mexico|Alamogordo]] is the only section of non-Interstate route as well as being the only road in New Mexico that's not a freeway to have the 75&amp;nbsp;mph limit; New Mexico, Nevada (US 95 south of US 93), and Texas are the only three states with 75&amp;nbsp;mph limits on roads that aren't freeways. There is no statutory requirement for reduced speeds on urban freeways so that, for example at [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and [[Las Vegas, New Mexico|Las Vegas]] the speed limit remains 75&amp;nbsp;mph on [[Interstate 25 in New Mexico|I-25]]. New Mexico, Kansas, North Dakota, Colorado, and Texas are the only states to have a speed limit greater than 70&amp;nbsp;mph in urban highways. Nonetheless, there are 65&amp;nbsp;mph limits on freeways in more heavily urbanized areas such as [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and Las Cruces. Other reduced speed limits do exist, but the lowest speed limit under normal conditions on New Mexico's freeways is 55&amp;nbsp;mph, which can be found on two sections of Interstate 25: The first section being three miles from the [[Big I]] to Gibson Boulevard in Albuquerque, and the second being a short stretch near [[Raton Pass]]. These particular stretches of I-25 were originally built as relocations of US-85, whose design and construction predate the interstate highway era. As such, these stretches do not meet modern interstate highway standards, and have closely spaced interchanges, sharp curves, and/or limited sight distances.

By statute, other state maintained roads may have speed limits of up to 75&amp;nbsp;mph. Four-lane divided highways in open areas often have 65&amp;nbsp;mph limits, with some 70&amp;nbsp;mph limits, such as almost the entire length of [[U.S. Route 550|US 550]] from [[Bloomfield, New Mexico|Bloomfield]] to [[Bernalillo, New Mexico|Bernalillo]]. There is a trend toward posting a 70&amp;nbsp;mph limit on these highways, such as the recent 70&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit posting (increased from 65&amp;nbsp;mph) on a 23-mile stretch of [[U.S. Route 70 in New Mexico|U.S. 70]] west of [[Roswell, New Mexico|Roswell]].

Primary two-lane highways in open areas with parking shoulders often have 65&amp;nbsp;mph limits.

Most primary two-lane highways without parking shoulders in open and mixed rural areas still have a 55&amp;nbsp;mph limit, but some have 60&amp;nbsp;mph limits.

A 65&amp;nbsp;mph left lane minimum speed limit is sometimes indicated on 75&amp;nbsp;mph roads with steep grades, "slower traffic keep right" is also in effect. On one-way roadways state law reserves the left and center lanes of two or more lanes for passing.&lt;ref&gt;New Mexico Statutes Chapter 66 Article 7 Part 4 Statute 66-7-305, −308, −311, −316, −317 [http://www.conwaygreene.com/nmsu/lpext.dll?f=templates&amp;fn=main-h.htm&amp;2.0|New New Mexico State Legislature] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231729/http://www.conwaygreene.com/nmsu/lpext.dll?f=templates&amp;fn=main-h.htm&amp;2.0%7CNew# |date=March 3, 2016 }} or [http://www.nmlaws.org/ nmlaws.org]&lt;/ref&gt; There are reduced advisory speed limits for some roads during poor weather. Speeding fines are doubled in construction zones and designated safety corridors, with signs often stating this. There are no longer night speed limits, nor are there any differential speed limits for heavy trucks.

There are two other statutory speed limits in New Mexico that are often altered, especially on urban [[arterial road|arterials]] or even city or countywide:&lt;ref&gt;New Mexico Statutes Chapter 66 Article 7 Part 4 Statute 66-7-301, −303 [http://www.conwaygreene.com/nmsu/lpext.dll?f=templates&amp;fn=main-h.htm&amp;2.0|New New Mexico State Legislature] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231729/http://www.conwaygreene.com/nmsu/lpext.dll?f=templates&amp;fn=main-h.htm&amp;2.0%7CNew# |date=March 3, 2016 }} or [http://www.nmlaws.org/ nmlaws.org]&lt;/ref&gt; thirty miles per hour in a "business or residence district" and fifteen miles per hour near [[school zone|schools at certain times]]. For example, in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] the default speed limit is thirty miles per hour as per state law, but many streets have a different speed limit. Some school zones there have twenty miles per hour speed limits. The city of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe's]] default speed limit is twenty five miles per hour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://70.168.205.112/santafe_nm/lpext.dll?f=templates&amp;fn=main-h.htm&amp;2.0 City of Santa Fe Code Chapter XXIV ExhibitA 12-6-1.2A] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115113340/http://70.168.205.112/santafe_nm/lpext.dll?f=templates&amp;fn=main-h.htm&amp;2.0# |date=November 15, 2012 }}. 70.168.205.112.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are no signs to make drivers aware of the altered limit, the limit is signed on most roads where it applies. [[Los Alamos County, New Mexico|Los Alamos County]] alters the urban default and absolute speed limits to twenty five miles per hour and 50&amp;nbsp;mph respectively, but posts signs at county lines.
* The speed limit on [[New Mexico State Road 502|NM 502]] between San Ildefonso Pueblo and Pojoaque Valley High School had a 65-mph speed limit. In November 2005, the stretch between [[New Mexico State Road 4|NM-4]] and [[Pojoaque, New Mexico|Pojoaque]] became a safety corridor. In 2007, the speed limit on the San Ildefonso-Pojoaque stretch was lowered to 55&amp;nbsp;mph.
* On [[New Mexico State Road 68|Highway 68]], the speed limit is 60&amp;nbsp;mph on much of the four-lane stretch between Española and Velarde.
* Minimum 65 left lane signs are posted on I-40 west of Albuquerque, a night speed limit of 30&amp;nbsp;mph is posted on [[New Mexico State Road 7|State Highway 7]] west of White's City going into [[Carlsbad Caverns]].
* Truck speed limit signs are rarely posted. One road has a posted limit of 45&amp;nbsp;mph/trucks:35 in Escondida, just north of [[Socorro, New Mexico|Socorro]], and [[U.S. Route 82|US 82]] east of [[Alamogordo, New Mexico|Alamogordo]] has a posted limit of 55&amp;nbsp;mph/trucks:50 for approximately a two-mile stretch.
* As of December 24, 2009, [[U.S. Route 54|US 54]] still has a 55&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit north of [[Tularosa, New Mexico|Tularosa]]. Yet [[New Mexico State Road 9|NM-9]] and CR-A003 have a 65&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit east of [[Columbus, New Mexico|Columbus]] to NM 136 near [[Santa Teresa, New Mexico|Santa Teresa]]. CR-A003 (Columbus-Santa Teresa Highway) is the only county road in New Mexico to exceed the statutory maximum 55&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit for county roads.
* [[Interstate 10 in New Mexico|Interstate 10]] was 70&amp;nbsp;mph between the Texas-New Mexico state line and two miles south of [[Interstate 25 in New Mexico|I-25]] in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] until October 2012, when it was raised to 75&amp;nbsp;mph. While it is 75&amp;nbsp;mph in the rest of New Mexico, the speed limit is 65&amp;nbsp;mph in Las Cruces, [[Deming, New Mexico|Deming]], and [[Lordsburg, New Mexico|Lordsburg]]. I-25 was posted 70&amp;nbsp;mph in [[Sandoval County, New Mexico|Sandoval County]] from the Bernalillo-Sandoval county line to US 550, but the limit was raised to 75&amp;nbsp;mph in May 2014.
* State Highway 30, a paved two-lane road with shoulders, has a 55&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit from [[New Mexico State Road 502|NM 502]] to the junction with the road for Santa Clara Pueblo, then reduces to 45&amp;nbsp;mph and then to 40&amp;nbsp;mph upon entering the [[Española, New Mexico|Española]] city limits. Prior to 2008 the speed limits were 60&amp;nbsp;mph from NM 502 until the junction with the road for Santa Clara Pueblo where it reduced to 45&amp;nbsp;mph, raised back to 60&amp;nbsp;mph until the Española city limits where it reduced to 50&amp;nbsp;mph, and then to 40&amp;nbsp;mph near its northern terminus at US 84/285.
* [[U.S. Route 84|US 84]]/[[U.S. Route 285|285]] between Santa Fe and Pojoaque, before it was upgraded to a freeway, had a 45&amp;nbsp;mph limit from Guadalupe Road in Santa Fe to the interchange with NM 599, increased to 55&amp;nbsp;mph to the southern terminus of Santa Fe County Road 73, increased to 60&amp;nbsp;mph until entering Cuyamungue, decreased to 55&amp;nbsp;mph, and then to 45&amp;nbsp;mph upon entering Pojoaque. Since it was upgraded to a full freeway in 2005, the speed limit from Guadalupe Road to NM 599 is now 55&amp;nbsp;mph, increases to 65&amp;nbsp;mph until Pojoaque where it briefly reduces to 50&amp;nbsp;mph and then to 45&amp;nbsp;mph.
* The posted speed limit on Silver Avenue in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] is 18&amp;nbsp;mph. When the route was designated as a bicycle route in the late 2000s, Albuquerque officials established the unusual 18&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit on Silver Avenue to increase motorists' awareness of the street's designation as a city bicycle route.

Outside of [[Bernalillo County, New Mexico|Bernalillo County]], no points are assessed to one's license for speeding in rural areas in New Mexico, unless the excessive speed was a contributing factor to a traffic accident.

==New York==
[[File:SIGNS21.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A standard-style New York State speed sign indicating the state speed limit]]

Speed limits are statutory (set by law) or regulatory (enacted by regulation), not necessarily by engineering standards. [[New York (state)|New York]] has a blanket statutory "Reasonable and Prudent" speed law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYTYPE=LAWS+&amp;QUERYDATA=$$VAT1180$$@TXVAT01180+&amp;LIST=LAW+&amp;BROWSER=BROWSER+&amp;TOKEN=18192391+&amp;TARGET=VIEW Laws of New York]. Public.leginfo.state.ny.us.&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest posted speed limit in New York is 65&amp;nbsp;mph (105&amp;nbsp;km/h), found only on limited-access freeways (including some state highways, most of the [[New York State Thruway]] and select [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highways]]). The default speed limit, posted as the "State Speed Limit", is 55&amp;nbsp;mph, which is in effect unless otherwise posted or in the absence of speed limit signs.&lt;ref&gt;NYS DMV drivers' handbook&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York State Department of Transportation]] sets speed limits in the vast majority of the state. Counties and most towns must petition DOT to change a speed limit. State law allows villages, cities, towns with more than 50,000 residents, and certain towns defined by law to be "suburban" to set speed limits on state, county, and local roads within their borders.

There is no state law regarding minimum speed limits, but minimum speed limit of 40&amp;nbsp;mph has been set on the entire length of [[Interstate 787]] and the entire length of [[Interstate 495 (New York)|Interstate 495]] (the [[Long Island Expressway]]). The [[New York State Thruway]] does not have a firm minimum speed, but there are signs advising drivers to use their flashers when traveling at speeds below 40&amp;nbsp;mph.

While New York does not have truck speed restrictions ''per se'', the New England Thruway ([[Interstate 95 in New York|Interstate 95]]) features "State Speed Limit 55" signs right next to "Truck Speed Limit 50" signs.

New York law allows area speed limits. An area speed limit applies to all highways within a specified area, except those specifically excluded. The area may be an entire municipality, or only a specific neighborhood. The defined area may also be the grounds of a school, hospital, or other institution. Area speed limits are signed at their perimeters with signs reading "Area Speed Limit" and the speed limit value shown below. "Area" may be replaced with a term that more precisely defines the area boundaries, such as "Town", "City", "Park", "Village" or "Campus".

[[File:NY 28B reaching former southern terminus.jpg|thumb|250px|The phrase "End 30 Mile Speed" is occasionally seen on old signage marking the end of a speed zone; it was phased out in the 1980s.]]
Normally, the end of a lowered speed limit is marked with a sign reading "State Speed Limit 55", indicating that the statewide speed limit applies. In areas where a curve or other road condition makes the state speed limit inadvisable, a sign reading "End XX m.p.h. Limit" may be used, with XX replaced with the speed limit value. A "State Speed Limit 55" sign should be installed after the curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=N.Y.S Supplement to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways (2009 Edition) |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |date=March 16, 2011 |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/operating/oom/transportation-systems/repository/B-2011Supplement-adopted.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sign is sometimes misused in locations where the speed limit changes to a speed other than 55&amp;nbsp;mph. This is mainly applied on both undivided and divided rural non-freeway routes. Though rarely seen, some divided roadways are set as low as 45&amp;nbsp;mph but mainly stay at the state speed limit of 55&amp;nbsp;mph; in one exceptional case, that of the [[Scajaquada Expressway]], the speed limit was lowered to 30&amp;nbsp;mph in 2016 after a fatality.

The top speed limit in most residential/urban and business district areas is at 30&amp;nbsp;mph, and state law prohibits speed limits below 25&amp;nbsp;mph on most common residential areas, though a speed limit of 25 is mainly only used in the New York City area and rarely seen outside of said area. However, School speed limits may be set as high as 30&amp;nbsp;mph to as low as 20&amp;nbsp;mph. New York City has established a number of 20&amp;nbsp;mph "Neighborhood Slow Zones" in residential neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Neighborhood Slow Zones |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/slowzones.shtml |publisher=New York City Department of Transportation |accessdate=July 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In residential neighborhood areas outside of New York City range between 30–40&amp;nbsp;mph and 35–45&amp;nbsp;mph on suburban/urban arterial routes.

New York's Criminal Procedure Law prevents law enforcement personnel from issuing a ticket for any offense that they did not witness personally, meaning that, among other ramifications, the state's [[electronic toll collection]] system can not be used for speed enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYTYPE=LAWS+&amp;QUERYDATA=$$CPL140.10$$@TXCPL0140.10+&amp;LIST=LAW+&amp;BROWSER=BROWSER+&amp;TOKEN=18192391+&amp;TARGET=VIEW Laws of New York].

===History===
Many expressways and parkways in the New York City suburbs were posted as high as 65&amp;nbsp;mph. During the 1973 Oil Embargo, New York lowered its speed limit to 50. The [[National Maximum Speed Law]] brought statewide speed limits up to 55. The city of New York, being a city, retained the 50&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit. New York did not take advantage of the 1987 Congressional provision allowing 65&amp;nbsp;mph zones on rural freeways, instead waiting until NMSL's repeal in late 1995 (actually, portions of the NY State Thruway, I-88, I-84 {west of the Hudson River}, I-81 and the Adirondack Northway {I-87 north of exit 7} were increased to 65 mph on August 1, 1995, prior to the elimination of the NMSL).

Until September 2003, the state legislature needed to approve individual 65&amp;nbsp;mph zones, a lengthy process taking months or years of politically motivated debate. Then-Governor [[George Pataki]] signed legislation in September 2003 that enables [[New York State Department of Transportation|NYSDOT]] and [[New York State Thruway Authority]] to raise speed limits to 65&amp;nbsp;mph on its roads that meet established design and safety standards. This legislation became active in March 2004, and was the reason for the 65 zones on [[New York State Route 7|NY Route 7]] (locally known as "Alternate Route 7"), Interstate 684 and [[Interstate 84 in New York|Interstate 84 east of the Hudson River in New York]].

==North Carolina==
[[File:2004-05-02 Speed Limit 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sometimes, speed limits not ending in a ''5'' or a ''0'' are used to get drivers' attention; here, the limit is 3 instead of the expected 5 in a [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]] municipal parking lot.]]

Along rural primary and secondary roads outside municipal limits in [[North Carolina]], the [[Statute|statutory]] speed limit is 55&amp;nbsp;mph unless otherwise posted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=§ 20-141. Speed restrictions. |publisher=North Carolina General Assembly |url=http://www.ncleg.net/gascripts/statutes/statutelookup.pl?statute=20-141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[National Maximum Speed Law]] that went into effect nationwide, North Carolina used to have 60&amp;nbsp;mph speed limits on two-lane primary and secondary roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Enacted March 9, 1967 |publisher=North Carolina Department of Transportation |url=https://connect.ncdot.gov/resources/safety/Route%20Changes/1967_03_09.pdf}}{{page needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the municipal limits, the statutory speed limit is 35&amp;nbsp;mph unless otherwise posted. The downtown statutory speed limit is 20&amp;nbsp;mph unless otherwise posted. "Reduce Speed Ahead" (RSA) [[speed limit#Signage|signage]] is the [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] whenever the speed limit drops at any level. Note that the NC DOT uses the imperative verb "reduce" instead of the adjectival form "reduced" that is standard in other states, although some municipalities now use "reduced" in their signs. In addition, a speed limit drop of 15&amp;nbsp;mph or greater normally includes a second warning sign after the RSA. For example, in a 55&amp;nbsp;mph zone, a sign prior to the RSA sign would say "BEGIN 35 1000 FEET AHEAD" and then the 35&amp;nbsp;mph posted speed limit. Three to eight lane [[boulevards]] with or without center turn lanes, range from 35&amp;nbsp;mph to 50&amp;nbsp;mph within municipal limits statewide.

It is rare that NCDOT will assign a speed drop greater than 20&amp;nbsp;mph. In [[Bertie County]], the US 17 bypass in [[Windsor, North Carolina|Windsor]] drops from 70&amp;nbsp;mph to 45&amp;nbsp;mph. In [[Moore County, NC|Moore County]], Shady Lane Road outside of [[Carthage, NC|Carthage]] in the Hillcrest community drops from 55&amp;nbsp;mph to 30&amp;nbsp;mph.

[[School zone]] speed limits generally entail a 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;mph reduction below the original speed limit during times of day used for school arrivals and departures. Such a speed limit would be indicated when entering the school zone. Also, the default or modified speed limit is indicated after leaving the school zone. A school zone speed limit cannot be less than 20&amp;nbsp;mph.

[[Military base]]s are generally posted at a maximum of 50&amp;nbsp;mph. As of May 2010, [[Fort Bragg (North Carolina)|Fort Bragg]] military two-lane roadways are now posted at 55&amp;nbsp;mph instead of 50&amp;nbsp;mph. Prior to May 2010, the speed limits higher than 50&amp;nbsp;mph through military bases were only on N.C. Highway 690 along the north side of Fort Bragg, Murchison Road (also known as [[North Carolina Highway 210|N.C. Highway 210]]) and the All American Freeway (which is classified and numbered as a state-maintained secondary road even though it is a freeway).

The state park speed limit is 25&amp;nbsp;mph unless otherwise posted. These are not limited to places such as [[Hanging Rock State Park]] and [[Mount Mitchell State Park]]. The [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] is 45&amp;nbsp;mph. However, there are occasional 35&amp;nbsp;mph stretches. The [[National Park Service]] is responsible for highway maintenance and speed enforcement on the Parkway.

The county governments of [[North Carolina]] do not have any control over speed limits or any other aspect of road operation, as there are no county roads in the state. Municipalities, on the other hand, can set speed limits on city-controlled roadways, subject to applicable state laws. Freeways and expressways with no primary route number are part of the state secondary road system and bear route numbers of 1000 or greater. Their maximum posted speed limit is 55&amp;nbsp;mph with four exceptions.

A speed limit of 70&amp;nbsp;mph is relatively uncommon in much of metropolitan North Carolina, though it applies to many rural interstate highways in the state, as well as several non-interstate freeways. The following are the only roads with 70&amp;nbsp;mph limits:

* [[Interstate 40 in North Carolina|Interstate 40]] from [[Old Fort, North Carolina|Old Fort]] to [[Morganton, North Carolina|Morganton]], from [[Statesville, North Carolina|Statesville]] to [[Clemmons, North Carolina|Clemmons]], and from [[Garner, North Carolina|Clayton]] to [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]]
* [[Interstate 73 in North Carolina|Interstate 73/74]] south of [[Asheboro, North Carolina|Asheboro]] to Ellerbee.
* [[Interstate 77 in North Carolina|Interstate 77]] north of Statesville
* [[Interstate 85 in North Carolina|Interstate 85]] from Mile Marker 70 south of [[Salisbury, North Carolina|Salisbury]] to Mile Marker 130 east of [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]]. and through [[Granville County, NC|Granville County]] (as of October 2015).
* [[Interstate 95 in North Carolina|Interstate 95]] from the SC state line to Exit 10 (Chicken Road), along the [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]] Bypass and north of [[Kenly, North Carolina|Kenly]] to the VA state line.

* [[Interstate 540 (North Carolina)|Interstate 540]] for the entire length.
* [[Interstate 795 (North Carolina)|Interstate 795]] from [[Goldsboro, North Carolina|Goldsboro]] to [[Wilson, North Carolina|Wilson]]
* [[Triangle Expressway]] for the entire length.
* [[U.S. Route 1 in North Carolina|US Highway 1]] from the southern end of the [[Sanford, North Carolina|Sanford]] Bypass to [[North Carolina Highway 55|NC 55]] in [[Apex, North Carolina|Apex]].
* [[U.S. Route 17 in North Carolina|US Highway 17]] on the [[Elizabeth City, North Carolina|Elizabeth City]] and [[Windsor, North Carolina|Windsor]] bypasses.
* [[U.S. Route 29 in North Carolina|US Highway 29]] from Reidsville to the Virginia state line.
* [[U.S. Route 64 in North Carolina|US Highway 64]] from [[Interstate 440 (North Carolina)|Interstate 440]] to [[Williamston, North Carolina|Williamston]] (except on the [[Rocky Mount, North Carolina|Rocky Mount]] bypass) and from [[Plymouth, North Carolina|Plymouth]] to [[Columbia, North Carolina|Columbia]]
* [[U.S. Route 70 in North Carolina|US Highway 70]] on the [[Clayton, North Carolina|Clayton]] bypass, and from [[Dover, North Carolina|Dover]] to [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]]
* [[U.S. Route 74|US Highway 74]] / Future [[Interstate 74 in North Carolina|Interstate 74]] on the [[Rockingham, North Carolina|Rockingham]]-[[Hamlet, North Carolina|Hamlet]] Bypass and from [[Chadbourn, North Carolina|Chadbourn]] to [[Whiteville, North Carolina|Whiteville]], as well as a section from NC 108 east of I-26 in Polk County to mile 187 in Rutherford County.
* [[U.S. Route 264|US Highway 264]] from [[Wendell, North Carolina|Wendell]] to [[Greenville, North Carolina|Greenville]]
*NC Route 147 between NC Route 540 and I-40.

These lengths make up approximately 589 miles, or 27%, of the total freeway mileage in North Carolina (405 miles or 31% of the state's growing Interstate system). Four-lane freeway-grade highways are generally posted at 65&amp;nbsp;mph through the state of North Carolina.

===60 mph speed limits===
Interstate freeways with 60&amp;nbsp;mph speed limits are found along on [[Interstate 26|I-26]] between Asheville and [[Hendersonville, North Carolina|Hendersonville]] and north of Asheville to Tennessee; I-40 between [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]] and [[Waynesville, North Carolina|Waynesville]] and through [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]]; on I-85 in [[Gaston County, North Carolina|Gaston]] (east of US 321 to the Mecklenburg County line) and [[Mecklenburg County, North Carolina|Mecklenburg]] counties and through [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]]; on I-440 along the northern half of [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]]'s Beltline

Non-Interstate Freeways (US Highways) with 60&amp;nbsp;mph speed limits are found along on the US 1 [[Henderson, North Carolina|Henderson]] Bypass (as of December 2011); [[U.S. Route 23|US-23]] [[Waynesville, North Carolina|Waynesville]] Bypass; [[U.S. Route 64|US 64]] over the Virginia Dare Memorial Bridge between [[Manns Harbor, NC|Manns Harbor]] and [[Manteo, NC|Manteo]]; US 74 [[Laurinburg, North Carolina|Laurinburg]] bypass and in Brunswick County from the Leland Industrial Park to NC 133; [[US Highway 301|US 301]]/[[Interstate 95 Business (North Carolina)|Business 95]] between Fayetteville and Eastover; the [[U.S. Route 311|US-311]] [[High Point, North Carolina|High Point]] Bypass and the [[U.S. Route 401|US-401]] [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]] bypass.

Only two State Secondary Road freeways in the state that has a 60&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit are the Wade Avenue Extension as of February 2012 and Aviation Parkway (from south of Globe Rd to Airport Blvd) as of July 2014, which are both in Raleigh.

60&amp;nbsp;mph speed limits along non-freeway segments are growing in popularity and have replaced 55&amp;nbsp;mph limits on several boulevard and [[Limited-access road|expressway]] segments throughout the state. The boulevard speed limit changes go against the [[NCDOT]] rationale behind signing 60&amp;nbsp;mph speed limits along only freeway and expressway segments. As of June 1, 2008, some examples of the affected boulevards are [[U.S. Route 17 in North Carolina|US 17]] north of [[Elizabeth City, North Carolina|Elizabeth City]], [[U.S. Route 74|US 74]] east of [[Wadesboro, North Carolina|Wadesboro]] and [[North Carolina Highway 11|NC 11]] in [[Pitt County, North Carolina|Pitt County]].

60&amp;nbsp;mph speed limits along Expressways are [[U.S. Route 1 in North Carolina|US 1]] in northeastern [[Moore County, North Carolina|Moore County]], [[U.S. Route 17 in North Carolina|US 17]] on bypass routes in [[Brunswick County, North Carolina|Brunswick County]], [[U.S. Route 74|US 74]] east of [[Interstate 95 in North Carolina|I-95]], [[U.S. Route 117|US 117]] in [[Wayne County, North Carolina|Wayne County]] &amp; [[Duplin County, North Carolina|Duplin County]], [[U.S. Route 220|US 220]] in [[Rockingham County, North Carolina|Rockingham County]] only along bypass segments and on [[NC 16]] in [[Lincoln County, NC|Lincoln]] and [[Catawba County, NC|Catawba]] counties (as of October 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Charlotte Observer |date=October 17, 2012 |title=State pushes the limits on new |url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/10/17/3603429/state-pushes-the-limits-on-new.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130119081606/http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/10/17/3603429/state-pushes-the-limits-on-new.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the entire US 220 alignment from [[North Carolina Highway 68|NC 68]] to the [[Virginia]] state line was 60&amp;nbsp;mph but went back to 55&amp;nbsp;mph between NC 68 and NC 704.

Three State Secondary road expressways in the state that have a 60&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit are the US 117 Connector in Sampson and Duplin Counties between US 117 and I-40 (The designation in Sampson County leaving I-40 towards Duplin County is SR 1783/Connector Road) and the un-numbered connector northwest of Kinston serving the Global Transpark.

There is a default minimum speed limit on [[Interstate Highway|Interstate]] and primary highways only when [[traffic sign|signs]] are present. The minimum is 40&amp;nbsp;mph if the maximum is 55&amp;nbsp;mph. The minimum is 45&amp;nbsp;mph if the maximum is at least 60&amp;nbsp;mph. These minimums do not apply to vehicles that are towing other vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_20/GS_20-141.html North Carolina General Statutes §20-141(c)]. Ncleg.net (November 1, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

North Carolina as well as other states operates a Safe Driving Incentive Plan (SDIP),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumerarts.com/auto/frame/sdip.htm SDIP Points] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001034354/http://www.consumerarts.com/auto/frame/sdip.htm# |date=October 1, 2012 }}. Consumerarts.com (January 1, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; a program that leads to insurance surcharges for moving violations based on a point system. In general, for speeding violations less than 10&amp;nbsp;mph over the posted speed limit in a speed zone less than 55&amp;nbsp;mph, one point is assessed; two points are assessed for exceeding 10&amp;nbsp;mph over the limit or speeding in a zone with a speed limit of greater than 55&amp;nbsp;mph.

A driver's licence will be suspended for travelling faster than 15&amp;nbsp;mph over the speed limit, provided the speed travelled is greater than 55&amp;nbsp;mph; suspensions can result for other speeding infractions, such as travelling faster than 75&amp;nbsp;mph in a 65&amp;nbsp;mph or less zone or faster than 80&amp;nbsp;mph in a 70&amp;nbsp;mph zone.

==North Dakota==
[[North Dakota]]'s major interstates, [[Interstate 29 in North Dakota|I-29]] and [[Interstate 94 in North Dakota|I-94]], hold a 75&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit in most rural areas, with 55-75&amp;nbsp;mph zones within portions of the [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]] and [[Bismarck, North Dakota|Bismarck]]/[[Mandan, North Dakota|Mandan]] urban areas (I-29 in [[Grand Forks]] is signed at 75 mph). The state's 4 lane Divided Highways as well as 2 short stretches of undivided 4 lane highways (US 2 around Rugby and U.S. 83 as it passes the eastern Lake Sakakawea Reservoir) usually carry a 70&amp;nbsp;mph limit, with 2 lane restricted to up to a 65&amp;nbsp;mph limit, and gravel roads have up to 55&amp;nbsp;mph limits. Roads within cities hold their own defined limits with 25 MPH speed limits common in residential streets and 25-40&amp;nbsp;mph limits on Urban 4-6 lane divided and undivided streets, with school zones at 15–25&amp;nbsp;mph.

On January 3, 2017, a bill was introduced to increase the rural speed limit on I-29 and I-94 to 80&amp;nbsp;mph. The bill also would have called for 75 mph speed limits on 4-lane divided highways and 70 mph speed limits for two lane roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.grandforksherald.com/news/4188232-north-dakota-senator-proposes-80-mph-speed-limits-interstates |title=North Dakota senator proposes 80 mph speed limits for interstates |date=December 28, 2016 |website=[[Grand Forks Herald]] |accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However state Senate rejected both bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.prairiepublic.org/post/speed-limit-bill-i-94-and-i-29-fails-senate |title=Speed limit bill for I-94 and I-29 fails the Senate |date=February 15, 2017 |website=Prairie Public Bradcasting |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northern Mariana Islands==
The speed limit in the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] is 45 mph (72 km/h).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ghsa.org/state-laws/issues/speeding%20and%20aggressive%20driving ''Ghsa.org.'' Retrieved 8 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ohio==
[[File:Speed limits in Ohio.svg|thumb|right|300px|''Prima facie'' speed limits defined in {{ORC|45|11|21}}(B). Other divisions of section 4511.21 define processes by which these speed limits may be increased or decreased along specific roadways.]]

The maximum speed limit found on highways in [[Ohio]] is {{convert|70|mph}} on the Ohio Turnpike, Rural Freeways, and both the Expressway and Freeway portions of [[US 30]] from Mansfield, Ohio to the Indiana State Line and [[US 33]] from Wapakoneta to St. Mary's Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;http://limaohio.com/news/6069/speed-limit-on-u-s-30-bumped-to-70-mph&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2013/09/28/70-mph-speed-limit-is-days-away-on-rural-freeways.html&lt;/ref&gt; The speed limit ranges from {{convert|55|mph}} to {{convert|70|mph}} on other divided highways. A small portion of the westbound lane (less than 500 feet) of [[Ohio State Route 16|State Route 16]] in [[Licking County, Ohio|Licking County]] is signed at 70 MPH slightly before the route upgrades from a two-lane non-divided to a four-lane divided highway, but otherwise, no non-divided highway in the state currently has a speed limit higher than {{convert|55|mph}}, though ODOT is now permitted to increase undivided roads to {{convert|60|mph}}.

Ohio is the only state east of the Mississippi River to allow 70&amp;nbsp;mph speed limits on non freeway roads. Both divided and non divided roads.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Ohio has an urban speed limit of {{convert|65|mph}} on Interstates by state law, yet many urban areas have lower speed limits due to safety concerns found in speed studies. These commonly are in the 50–60&amp;nbsp;mph range. For instance, in most of metro [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]] and [[Cincinnati]], as well as in downtown [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], the speed limit is {{convert|55|mph}}, while in [[Cleveland]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], and [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]] the speed limit is {{convert|60|mph}}; however, in central [[Cleveland]] along the Inner Belt, the speed limit is {{convert|50|mph}}. On one case, however, the [[Ohio Turnpike]] has a {{convert|70|mph}} in the outer suburbs of Toledo, Akron, and Cleveland, even since all 241 miles of the highway has the 70 mph speed limit. Some urban areas are also posted with minimum speed limits, usually with a minimum of 40 or 45. At one time, portions of [[Interstate 76 (Ohio–New Jersey)|Interstate 76]] and [[Interstate 77]] in downtown [[Akron]] had a maximum speed limit of 50&amp;nbsp;mph and a minimum speed limit of 35&amp;nbsp;mph.

School zones in Ohio normally have a 20&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit, regardless of the road's normal speed limit, in effect during school hours.

==Oklahoma==
In [[Oklahoma]], the maximum posted speed limit is 75&amp;nbsp;miles per hour on [[Toll road|turnpikes]] and 70&amp;nbsp;mph on all other freeways. Most other rural highways, divided or undivided, have a 65&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit (although some rural [[divided highway]]s have a 70&amp;nbsp;mph limit). The minimum speed limit on almost all [[Interstate Highway]]s, freeways, and turnpikes is 40&amp;nbsp;mph, except when the speed limit is 75&amp;nbsp;mph (found only on turnpikes), in which case the minimum speed is 50&amp;nbsp;mph. In addition, rural sections of turnpike are supplemented with a sign warning "no tolerance". On May 9, 2016, Governor Fallin signed HB 3167 which removes numerical caps on rural highway speed limits in Oklahoma which takes effect in November 2016. Even with this bill the speed limits across the state are not expected to change because of budget issues in doing studies &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/capitol_report/speed-limits-not-expected-to-increase-under-new-law-odot/article_0221cd43-3978-5ff9-bb22-b1cb27f0a4b0.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oregon==
[[File:Speed35.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A standard-style Oregon speed sign removing the word "limit"]]
The highest posted speed limit in Oregon is 70&amp;nbsp;mph on I-84 east of The Dalles, I-82 and US 95 (trucks 65 mph). Oregon state statutes allow for a maximum speed limit of 70&amp;nbsp;mph on rural interstate highways, and the law gives the [[Oregon Department of Transportation]] (ODOT) discretion to define which freeway segments to post the 70&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit. ODOT did not raise speed limits beyond 65&amp;nbsp;mph on other freeways, and strongly opposed legislative efforts to raise the maximum allowable speed limit. However, in July 2015, Governor [[Kate Brown]] signed a bill raising speed limits on several highways in eastern Oregon; the bill included provisions to raise the speed limit to 70&amp;nbsp;mph on [[Interstate 84 in Oregon|I-84]] and [[U.S. Route 95#Oregon|US 95]]. It was announced on October 6, 2017 that the truck speed limit will be increasing to 60 mph on rural interstate highways where the car speed limit is 65 mph as soon as new signs are posted.

===Engineering studies===
Although the speed limit can be raised to 70&amp;nbsp;mph based on engineering studies under current law, ODOT has not identified any freeway sections that it believes should be raised beyond the 65&amp;nbsp;mph limit. In 2004, ODOT had released an engineering study on the average and 85th percentile speeds on interstate highways. This study found that the 85th percentile speed on rural interstates by passenger cars was 71.1&amp;nbsp;mph with a statewide average of 66.3&amp;nbsp;mph. The engineering study recommended raising the speed limit on rural interstates to 70&amp;nbsp;mph. Despite this, ODOT initially refused to post the 70&amp;nbsp;mph limit due to safety concerns and its associated monetary costs; however, there appears to be no higher fatality levels in other states when the limit was raised.&lt;ref name="Speed Limits: Frequently Asked Questions"&gt;{{cite web |title=Speed Limits: Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://www.motorists.org/speed-limits/faq |publisher=National Motorists Association |access-date=August 13, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140721071324/http://www.motorists.org/speed-limits/faq# |archive-date=July 21, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In all rural areas in Oregon, the speed limit is 55 unless otherwise posted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/HWY/TRAFFIC-ROADWAY/docs/pdf/oregon_speed_zone_report_proposal.pdf |title=Recommendation for Setting Speed Limits on Interstate Highways in Oregon |publisher=oregon.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2002, [[Oregon]] state law required that all speed limit signs omit the word LIMIT from their display. The reasoning behind this was related to the explicit "basic speed" law that existed, which allowed citation for exceeding speeds "too fast for conditions" regardless of the posted speed. The typeface of the numerals on the signs varies greatly depending on which jurisdiction made the sign, due to its non-standardized design. In 2002, the [[Oregon Department of Transportation]] revised its supplement to the [[MUTCD]], mandating the omission of the word LIMIT ''except'' on signs posted on [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate highways]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/HWY/TRAFFIC-ROADWAY/docs/pdf/english_chapter_3.pdf |title=Chapter 3 |publisher=oregon.gov |accessdate=December 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and within city limits. As of 2014, ODOT has replaced nearly all SPEED signs posted on Interstates with SPEED LIMIT signs, but it was left to the various city governments to replace signs in their jurisdictions at their leisure, if at all. Thus, older SPEED signs are still a common sight across the state.

===Attempts to raise speed limits===
Throughout the late 1990s the [[Oregon state legislature]] passed multiple bills that would have raised the speed limit to 75&amp;nbsp;miles per hour on rural [[Interstate Highways]] and up to 70&amp;nbsp;mph on certain rural two-lane highways in the eastern portions of the state. Each year [[Governor of Oregon|Governor]] [[John Kitzhaber]] vetoed the bill due to safety concerns and he was worried that the 20&amp;nbsp;mph increase in car and truck speeds would raise road hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oregon Bill Could Mean Big Speed Variance |url=http://www.truckinginfo.com/channel/safety-compliance/news/story/1999/03/oregon-bill-could-mean-big-speed-variance.aspx |publisher=Trucking Info}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the Oregon state legislature passed a bill that would have raised the maximum permissible speed limit on [[Interstate Highways]] to 70&amp;nbsp;mph for cars with a 5&amp;nbsp;mph differential for trucks, up from the previous 65&amp;nbsp;mph limit for cars with a 10&amp;nbsp;mph differential; this bill was signed into law by then newly elected Governor [[Ted Kulongoski]] on September 26, 2003.&lt;ref name="Another step toward unsplitting speeds"&gt;{{cite web |title=Another step toward unsplitting speeds |url=http://www.landlinemag.com/Magazine/2003/Nov/News/unsplitting-speeds.aspx |publisher=Land Line |accessdate=November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ODOT's 2004 study revealed that it is safe for cars to be traveling at 70&amp;nbsp;mph and trucks at 60&amp;nbsp;mph the Oregon Department of Transportation decided to not initially implement the increase out of concerns that it would not be safe to have trucks traveling at 65&amp;nbsp;mph. Prior to the [[National Maximum Speed Law]], the speed limit on Oregon freeways was 75&amp;nbsp;mph with some 70 limits on two-lane roads in eastern portions of the state. On July 20, 2015, Governor Brown signed HB 3402 into law. This bill raises the speed limit on [[Interstate 84 in Oregon|I-84]] east of The Dalles, I-82 (HB 4047 signed 2/23/16) and [[U.S. Route 95#Oregon|US 95]] to 70&amp;nbsp;mph for cars and 65&amp;nbsp;mph for trucks. It also increases speed limits on several other two lane rural highways to 65&amp;nbsp;mph for cars and 60&amp;nbsp;mph for trucks in Eastern Oregon. The law took effect on March 1, 2016.&lt;ref name="HB 3402"&gt;{{cite web |title=HB3402: Oregon Legislature Bill Tracker |url=http://gov.oregonlive.com/bill/2015/HB3402/ |accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===School speed limits===
In 2004, a law was passed revising Oregon's [[school zone|school speed limit laws]]. In school zones, on roads with speed limits of 30&amp;nbsp;mph or below, drivers were required to slow to 20&amp;nbsp;mph 24&amp;nbsp;hours a day, 365&amp;nbsp;days a year, regardless of whether or not children were present. This replaced most 'when children are present' placards. If the speed limit was 35&amp;nbsp;mph or higher, the school zone limit would be imposed either by flashing yellow lights or a placard denoting times and days of the week when the limit was in effect. The at-all-times rule was highly unpopular with motorists and was widely ignored. In 2006, the law was revised again, taking away the 'at all times' requirement and replacing it with a time-of-day system (usually school days, 7 a.m. to 5&amp;nbsp;pm). School crossings with flashing yellow lights remain. In many communities, school zones are strictly enforced and speed traps in these areas are commonly employed.

ODOT has not chosen a variation of speed between two-lane roads in Oregon, regardless of the terrain. Any rural two-lane road in the state has a default speed limit of 55&amp;nbsp;mph. Town speed limits are 20&amp;nbsp;mph in an alley, 20&amp;nbsp;mph in a school zone, 35&amp;nbsp;mph on boulevards, and 45&amp;nbsp;mph on roads with traffic lights.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

In [[Pennsylvania]] the maximum freeway speed limit is generally 65&amp;nbsp;mph (105&amp;nbsp;km/h), with select sections of rural freeway and most of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] signed at 70&amp;nbsp;mph (113&amp;nbsp;km/h), or 55&amp;nbsp;mph (89&amp;nbsp;km/h) such as most of standalone [[Interstate 70]]. The speed limit on urban freeways ranges from a low of 40&amp;nbsp;mph in downtown [[Pittsburgh]] and [[Philadelphia]] to a high of 70&amp;nbsp;mph in some suburban areas.

In 1940, when the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] was opened between [[Irwin, Pennsylvania|Irwin]] and [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Carlisle]], the entire 160&amp;nbsp;mile [[limited-access]] [[toll road]] did not have a speed limit, similar to that of the German [[Autobahn]]s. In 1941, a speed limit of 70&amp;nbsp;mph (113&amp;nbsp;km/h) was established, only to be reduced to 35&amp;nbsp;mph (56&amp;nbsp;km/h) during the war years (1942–45). After WWII, the limit was raised to 70&amp;nbsp;mph on the four-lane sections, with the two-lane tunnels having 50&amp;nbsp;mph (80&amp;nbsp;km/h) for cars and 40&amp;nbsp;mph (64&amp;nbsp;km/h) for trucks. Prior to the [[National Maximum Speed Law|1974 federal speed limit law]], all [[Interstate Highway|Interstates]] and the Turnpike had a 65&amp;nbsp;mph (105&amp;nbsp;km/h) speed limit on rural stretches and 60&amp;nbsp;mph (97&amp;nbsp;km/h) speed limit in urban areas.

In 1995, the state raised the speed limit on rural stretches of Interstate Highways and the Pennsylvania Turnpike system to 65&amp;nbsp;mph (105&amp;nbsp;km/h), with urban areas having a 55&amp;nbsp;mph (89&amp;nbsp;km/h) limit. In 1997, PennDOT raised the speed limit to some rural non-Interstate Highway [[bypass (road)|bypasses]] to 65&amp;nbsp;mph (105&amp;nbsp;km/h). In 2005, with the change in the designation of "urban zones" in the state (actually the law eliminating the prohibition against 65&amp;nbsp;mph limits in urban areas was enacted in 2000.  It took PennDOT and the PTC 5 years to realize the law had been changed), the entire lengths of both the Pennsylvania Turnpike's east–west mainline and [[Interstate 476|Northeast Extension]] were given 65&amp;nbsp;mph (105&amp;nbsp;km/h) limits, except at the tunnels and through the very winding 5.5&amp;nbsp;mile (9&amp;nbsp;km) eastern approach to the [[Allegheny Mountain Tunnel]].

The 70&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit was authorized by House Bill 1060, which was signed by Governor [[Tom Corbett]] on November 25, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Regular Session 2013-2014: House Bill 1060 |publisher=Pennsylvania General Assembly |url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2013&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=h&amp;type=b&amp;bn=1060}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="70 mph speed limits coming to Pennsylvania in 2014"&gt;{{cite news |title=70 mph speed limits coming to Pennsylvania in 2014 |url=http://articles.mcall.com/2013-12-13/news/mc-70-mph-valley-20131212_1_70-mph-65-mph-northeast-extension |newspaper=The Morning Call |accessdate=December 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 18, 2014, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission announced the return of the 70&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit on a 97-mile stretch of the mainline from the [[Blue Mountain (Pennsylvania)|Blue Mountain]] interchange (MP 201) to the [[Morgantown, Pennsylvania|Morgantown]] interchange (MP 298).&lt;ref name="'Speed limit 70' coming to turnpike"&gt;{{cite news |title='Speed limit 70' coming to turnpike. |url=http://www.tribune-democrat.com/latestnews/x1667069940/Speed-limit-70-coming-to-turnpike |newspaper=The Tribune-Democrat |accessdate=July 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signs were erected on July 22, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Katelyn |title=Speed limit raised to 70 mph on Pa.

On non-freeway roads, speed limits are generally held at 55&amp;nbsp;mph (89&amp;nbsp;km/h) for rural four-lane roads, 55&amp;nbsp;mph (89&amp;nbsp;km/h) for rural two-lane roads, 45–55&amp;nbsp;mph (72–89&amp;nbsp;km/h) for urban four lane roads and 40–45 (sometimes, but rarely, 50&amp;nbsp;mph) &amp;nbsp;mph (64–72&amp;nbsp;km/h) for urban two lane roads, 35–45&amp;nbsp;mph for roads in commercial business areas, 30-35&amp;nbsp;mph (56&amp;nbsp;km/h) for major roads in residential areas, 20-25&amp;nbsp;mph (40&amp;nbsp;km/h) for most municipal residential streets, including main north–south and east–west roads in county seats and other mid-sized to large towns, and 15-20&amp;nbsp;mph (24&amp;nbsp;km/h) for [[school zone]]s during school arrival and departure times only. It is also only in effect on days that the school the road goes near is in session. Many schools have signs that blink when the school speed limit is in effect. There is no reduced school speed on [[divided highway]]s, even if the school sits right beside the highway.

All state-owned two-lane roads in rural areas within Pennsylvania have a default speed limit of 55&amp;nbsp;mph unless otherwise posted.

The Pennsylvania Turnpike has a minimum speed limit of 15&amp;nbsp;mph below the posted maximum speed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paturnpike.com/geninfo/rulesregs/rulesregs.aspx The Pennsylvania Turnpike – About the PTC] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113091005/http://www.paturnpike.com/geninfo/rulesregs/rulesregs.aspx# |date=November 13, 2014 }}. Paturnpike.com.&lt;/ref&gt; though the minimum is only sporadically posted. This is not enforced for slow-moving trucks in areas with steep grades and signs are posted that instruct drivers to use their flashers if traveling below 50&amp;nbsp;mph (40 if the speed limit is 55). Pennsylvania has no default minimum speed limit on any other roads. However, minimum speed limits on certain highways may be enacted and posted as provided by Section 3364(c) of the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Code (Title 75 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes).&lt;ref name="dmv.state.pa.us"&gt;http://www.dmv.state.pa.us/pdotforms/vehicle_code/chapter33.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

§3364(a) also requires, "Except when reduced speed is necessary for safe operation or in compliance with law, whenever any person drives a vehicle upon a roadway having width for not more than one lane of traffic in each direction at less than the maximum posted speed and at such a slow speed as to impede the normal and reasonable movement of traffic, the driver shall, at the first opportunity when and where it is reasonable and safe to do so and after giving appropriate signal, drive completely off the roadway and onto the berm or shoulder of the highway. The driver may return to the roadway after giving appropriate signal only when the movement can be made in safety and so as not to impede the normal and reasonable movement of traffic."

Drivers cannot be stopped by police for driving less than 6&amp;nbsp;mph over the posted speed limit (10&amp;nbsp;mph if the speed limit is less than 55&amp;nbsp;mph and non-radar timing devices are used, as use of radar devices is limited to "members of the Pennsylvania State Police" by §3368c2).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motorists.org/chapters/pennsylvania Pennsylvania Motorist Information | National Motorists Association]. Motorists.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Puerto Rico==
The [[Territories of the United States|US territory]] of [[Puerto Rico]] regulates and posts speed limits in miles per hour, although highway signage for distances are in kilometers. Some people are hoping to have the speed limit in autopistas raised to 70&amp;nbsp;mph, along with 60&amp;nbsp;mph for trucks.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} [[Toll road|Tolled]] ''[[Autopistas of Puerto Rico|Autopistas]]'' as of 2015, can have speed limits up to 65&amp;nbsp;mph, while other [[Limited-access road|expressways]] have speed limits up to 60&amp;nbsp;mph. The rural default speed limit is 45&amp;nbsp;mph but may be increased to 55&amp;nbsp;mph. In residential areas, only multilane roads have limits up to 35&amp;nbsp;mph, other roads are restricted to a maximum speed of 25&amp;nbsp;mph. Only rural school zones have the higher 25&amp;nbsp;mph limit. Speed limits for "heavy motor vehicles", such as [[school bus]]es, are always 10&amp;nbsp;mph lower than that allowed for lighter vehicles, except in urban school zones where the limit is 20&amp;nbsp;mph. Vehicles carrying [[hazardous materials]] are limited to 30&amp;nbsp;mph in rural areas and 20&amp;nbsp;mph in urban ones.&lt;ref name="michie.lexisnexis.com"&gt;§ 5122. Maximum lawful speed limits and penalties., Subchapter IV, Chapter 27, Title 9 of the Laws of Puerto Rico [http://michie.lexisnexis.com/puertorico/lpext.dll?f=templates&amp;fn=main-h.htm&amp;cp=prcode]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhode Island==
Along two-lane roadways, the default speed limit is 50&amp;nbsp;mph during the daytime outside a business or residential district. "Daytime" means a half-hour before sunset and a half-hour after sunrise. At night time and also uncommon on the East Coast, the default speed limit is 45&amp;nbsp;mph outside a business or residential district. Through the CBD and residential district, the default speed limit is 25&amp;nbsp;mph. Through school zones within 300 feet, the default speed limit is 20&amp;nbsp;mph. Local governments are barred from raising the default speed limits during the day and at night. Divided highways such as rural Interstates are generally posted at 65&amp;nbsp;mph but 55&amp;nbsp;mph closer to Providence. Divided arterials and expressways are posted no higher than 55&amp;nbsp;mph. This includes US 1 south of RI 4 to Westerly. A speed limit of 65&amp;nbsp;mph may be allowed on rural interstates based on engineering studies. Currently,{{when|date=March 2015}} however, the only interstates raised to 65 are [[Interstate 95]] from exits 1-9 and [[Interstate 295 (Rhode Island–Massachusetts)|Interstate 295]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interstate Highways |url=http://rihighways.tripod.com/intersta.html |publisher=Rhode Island Highways}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Carolina==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
Interstate speed limits in [[South Carolina]] are posted at 70&amp;nbsp;mph. Interstates passing through "Urban" areas are dropped to 60&amp;nbsp;mph. The urban area assignment of 60&amp;nbsp;mph usually includes the metropolitan area and the actual inner city area. The three exceptions to the rule are [[Interstate 385|I-385]] in [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]], the [[South Carolina Highway 31|SC 31]] freeway around [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]] and [[Interstate 95 in South Carolina|I-95]] around [[Florence, South Carolina|Florence]]. I-385 has a 55 mph speed limit at its terminus within the Greenville area. SC 31 is posted at 65&amp;nbsp;mph even though it is in the greater Myrtle Beach area. SC 31 was originally posted at 60&amp;nbsp;mph when it was built in 2004. I-95 even as a 6 lane semi-urban built freeway, maintains a 70&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit through the Florence area (as of June 2013, from just south of exit 160 to just south of exit 164, the speed limit has been reduced to 60&amp;nbsp;mph, a textbook speed trap). It is 6 lanes from SC 327 to I-20.

Four-lane arterials by default are posted at 60&amp;nbsp;mph. Four-lane bypasses at 60&amp;nbsp;mph can be found in Marion and Sumter, but others remain at 55&amp;nbsp;mph. It is not uncommon that 55&amp;nbsp;mph can be expected in more built-up areas prior to municipalities and/or if the engineering on the highway is below standards. However, [[U.S. Route 123]] has a divided segment where the speed limit is 65&amp;nbsp;mph.

Two-lane roads are 55&amp;nbsp;mph by default. However, a handful of counties maintained as either state secondary roads or county roads are posted at 45&amp;nbsp;mph.

Central business districts (CBDs) are posted at 30&amp;nbsp;mph. Unlike North Carolina with their default downtown speed limit of 20&amp;nbsp;mph, they are rare to find in South Carolina in downtown areas. A recent trend is occurring with CBD speed limits that they are being signed at 25&amp;nbsp;mph in random municipalities around the state.

Speed limit drops generally are done in 10&amp;nbsp;mph increments but 20&amp;nbsp;mph are not uncommon. Improvements in the mid-2000s were done by [[South Carolina Department of Transportation|SCDOT]] to warn motorists ahead of time for speed drops on various roadways. However, there are still some roadways that have not received that treatment. However, there are a couple roadways that get 25&amp;nbsp;mph to 30&amp;nbsp;mph drops as well. The speed limit drops from 55&amp;nbsp;mph to 25&amp;nbsp;mph at a traffic circle with US 378 and SC 391 in eastern [[Saluda County, SC|Saluda County]]. On US 52 northbound approaching Kingstree, the speed limit drops from 60&amp;nbsp;mph to 35&amp;nbsp;mph

==South Dakota==
Shortly after the December 1995 repeal of the 65/55&amp;nbsp;mph [[National Maximum Speed Law]], [[South Dakota]] raised its general rural speed limits to 75&amp;nbsp;mph on freeways and 65&amp;nbsp;mph on other roads along with 70 on a few 4 lane divided highways. Almost a decade after posting the 75&amp;nbsp;mph limit, average speeds on South Dakotan rural freeways remain at or below the speed limit. In the urban areas of Sioux Falls and Rapid city, a 65&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit is posted on Interstates 90 and 29.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sddot.com/pe/data/Docs/SPEED2006.pdf Department of Transportation]. Sddot.com (April 17, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, SD State Legislature has passed the bill to raise the speed limit on Interstate 29 and Interstate 90 to 80&amp;nbsp;mph. It was signed into law and took effect in April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2015/03/17/mph-speed-limit-gas-tax-hike-signed-law/24924491/|publisher=Associated Press|date=March 17, 2015|accessdate=March 19, 2017|title=80 mph speed limit, gas tax hike signed into law}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the 80 MPH speed limit was initially signed on all rural freeways in the state, the Interstate 90 stretch from Rapid City to the Wyoming Border returned to 75&amp;nbsp;mph due to safety concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mitchellrepublic.com/news/state/3755376-i-90-speed-limit-returns-75-west-rapid-city|date=May 29, 2015|accessdate=March 19, 2017|last=Mercer|first=Bob|publisher=The Daily Republic|title=I-90 speed limit returns to 75 west of Rapid City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tennessee]] generally posts its rural interstates at 70&amp;nbsp;mph. These include all of the state's two-digit Interstates except [[Interstate 55 in Tennessee|Interstate 55]] and [[Interstate 26 in Tennessee|Interstate 26]]. The only auxiliary interstates in Tennessee with a 70 mph speed limit are [[Interstate 155 (Missouri–Tennessee)|Interstate 155]] and [[Interstate 840 (Tennessee)|Interstate 840]]. 70&amp;nbsp;mph speed limits are allowed on all other controlled access highways, and are found on controlled-access portions of [[U.S. Route 51 in Tennessee|U.S. 51]] and [[Tennessee State Route 22|S.R. 22]], [[Tennessee State Route 111|111]], [[Tennessee State Route 386|386]], and [[Tennessee State Route 396|396]]. In 70 mph zones, the default minimum speed limit is 55.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Summary of State Speed Laws |url=file:///C:/Users/jakew/Downloads/811457.pdf |location= |publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation |agency=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration |date=February 1, 2010 |access-date=2017-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812155911/http://c/ |archivedate=August 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban interstates are generally posted at 55 to 65&amp;nbsp;mph, however, portions of Interstates [[Interstate 24|24]], [[Interstate 40 in Tennessee|40]], and [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|65]] and S.R. 386 in Davidson County, as well as I-24 in Clarksville are posted at 70 mph. Four-lane divided highways are posted as high as 65&amp;nbsp;mph but are sometimes 55&amp;nbsp;mph. These are often hotbeds for speed camera enforcement leading into a municipality.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} 55&amp;nbsp;mph speed limits are allowed on two-lane state maintained roads, but some contain 45 and 50 mph limits, even in rural areas, primarily as a result of local policies. In [[East Tennessee]], most mountain roads leading to North Carolina are poorly posted at 45&amp;nbsp;mph. Furthermore, two-lane roads such as [[U.S. Route 321|US&amp;nbsp;321]] and [[Tennessee State Route 91|S.R. 91]] have the same mountain and road width characteristics when leaving Tennessee into North Carolina or Virginia at 55&amp;nbsp;mph.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Inside a municipality, speed limit assignments are often a mystery on state-maintained roads. This could range from 15 to 55&amp;nbsp;mph depending on the type of roadway. This is because the state of Tennessee grants strong [[Home Rule in the United States|home rule]] powers to municipalities and [[John Forrest Dillon|Dillon's Rule]] for unincorporated areas in the county for speed limit assignments on non-controlled access state-maintained roads, requiring that they fall within established constraints.&lt;ref name=code&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lawserver.com/law/state/tennessee/tn-code/tennessee_code_55-8-152|title=Terms Used In Tennessee Code 55-8-152|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=2010|website=lawserver.com|publisher=Lawserver|access-date=2018-01-27|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other states, this weakens [[Tennessee Department of Transportation|TennDOT]]'s ability to sign predictable speed limits in a reasonable and prudent matter.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Also, Tennessee has a high percentage of roadways maintained by the counties.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In the 2000s, all of the major cities in Tennessee except for [[Nashville]] and [[Clarksville, Tennessee|Clarksville]] petitioned TDOT to enact environmental speed limits in their respective counties after failing to meet [[US Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] air quality standards, reducing speed limits from 70 mph to 65&amp;nbsp;mph and 55&amp;nbsp;mph for trucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilson |first=John |date=February 8, 2005 |title=Truck Speed Lowered To 55 MPH In Hamilton County

Other rural highways had a maximum speed limit of 65&amp;nbsp;mph day and 55&amp;nbsp;mph night for cars and 50&amp;nbsp;mph day or night for trucks. Many of these other class roadways also had separate day and night speed limits as well.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

[[Texas]] is the only state that does not prescribe a different speed limit for each road type in its state or federal highway system. Texas law generally prescribes a statutory speed limit of {{Convert|70|mi/h|km/h|0}} for any rural road that is numbered by the [[state highway|state]] or federal government ([[United States Numbered Highways]] and [[Interstate Highway]]s)—whether two lane, four lane, freeway, or otherwise—{{Convert|60|mi/h|km/h|0}} for roads outside an urban district that are not federal or state highways, and {{Convert|30|mi/h|km/h|0}} for streets in an urban district.&lt;ref&gt;Texas Statutes, Transportation Code, [http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/TN/htm/TN.545.htm#545.352 § 545.352.

===Truck speed limits===
[[File:I-20 eastbound, 7 miles west of Pecos.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Example of 70 mph truck speed limit sign immediately behind an 80 mph speed limit sign, before truck speed limits were abolished]]

Texas once had separate, systemwide truck speed limits, but they were repealed in 1999 and 2011.

The truck speed limit used to be 60&amp;nbsp;mph (97&amp;nbsp;km/h) day/55&amp;nbsp;mph (89&amp;nbsp;km/h) night when the regular limit was higher. This speed limit did not apply to buses or to trucks transporting [[United States Postal Service]] mail.

Truck speed limits disappeared when all speed limits were capped at 55&amp;nbsp;mph (89&amp;nbsp;km/h) in 1974. They reappeared with the introduction of 65&amp;nbsp;mph (105&amp;nbsp;km/h) limits in 1987.

Effective September 1, 1999, Texas repealed truck speed limits on all roads except [[Farm to Market Road|farm to market and ranch to market]] roads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landlinemag.com/Archives/1999/august99/legislative_news.html Land Line Magazine: The Business Magazine for Professional Truckers].

Capitol.state.tx.us.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, a bill allowing 75&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit on roads in certain counties excluded trucks, introducing a 70&amp;nbsp;mph truck speed limit on roads with a higher limit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=77R&amp;Bill=HB299 Texas Legislature Online – 77(R) History for HB 299].

No. 2257 |publisher=Texas Legislature |url=http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/79R/billtext/html/HB02257F.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, truck speed limits were fully repealed in 2011.&lt;ref name="capitol.state.tx.us"/&gt;

===Night speed limits===
Before September 1, 2011, Texas had a statutory 65&amp;nbsp;mph (105&amp;nbsp;km/h) night speed limit on all roads with a higher daytime limit. In 2011, the Texas Legislature banned night speed limits effective September 1, 2011.&lt;ref name="capitol.state.tx.us"&gt;[http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=82R&amp;Bill=HB1353 Texas Legislature Online – 82(R) History for HB 1353]. Capitol.state.tx.us.&lt;/ref&gt; However as of June 2013, night speed limits (55) were retained on some county roads where the speed limit is 60 mph in [[Scurry County]], just outside of [[Snyder, Texas]].

===Environmental speed limits===

Texas is the first state to lower speed limits for air quality reasons, although the lowered limits may not meaningfully improve air quality.

In roughly a 50-mile (80&amp;nbsp;km) radius of the [[Houston]]–[[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] and [[Dallas]]–[[Fort Worth, Texas|Ft. Worth]] regions, the [[Texas Commission on Environmental Quality]] convinced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dot.state.tx.us/tdotnews/trnscrpt/2000/0500trns.htm |title=Texas Transportation Commission meeting minutes |date=May 25, 2000 |accessdate=July 24, 2007 |work=Texas Department of Transportation}} Search for words "environmental speed limits", and refer to the paragraphs containing the first instance of the word and subsequent paragraphs.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Texas Department of Transportation]] to reduce the speed limit on all roads with 70&amp;nbsp;mph (113&amp;nbsp;km/h) or 65&amp;nbsp;mph (105&amp;nbsp;km/h) speed limits by 5&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Speed Limit Reduction |publisher=Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission |url=http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/oprd/sips/speedlimit.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050914153755/http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/oprd/sips/speedlimit.html |archivedate=2005-09-14}} &lt;!-- Please change all TNRCC citations to those of TCEQ--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This was instituted as part of a plan to reduce smog-forming emissions in areas out of compliance with the federal [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tceq.state.tx.us/implementation/air/sip/speedlimit.html Vehicular Speed-Limit Reduction – Texas Commission on Environmental Quality] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126004805/http://www.tceq.state.tx.us/implementation/air/sip/speedlimit.html |date=January 26, 2010 }}. tceq.state.tx.us.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial studies found that lower speed limits could provide roughly 1.5% of the emissions reductions required for Clean Air Act compliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.smu.edu/acambre/esl-nctcog.htm Effectiveness of ESLs]. People.smu.edu (January 2, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; However, follow-up studies found that the actual reduction is far less:
# The emissions modeling software initially used, MOBILE 5a, overestimated the emissions contribution of speed limit reductions. Rerunning the models with the next generation software, MOBILE 6, produced dramatically lower emissions reductions.
# Speed checks in the Dallas area performed 1 year after implementation of speed limit reductions show that actual speed reductions are only about 1.6&amp;nbsp;mph, a fraction of the anticipated 10% (5.5&amp;nbsp;mph) speed reduction.
With both of these facts combined, it is possible that the speed limit reductions only provide a thousandth of the total emissions reductions necessary for Clean Air Act compliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.smu.edu/acambre/eslEPA102402.htm Letter to EPA about Environmental Speed Limits]. People.smu.edu (October 24, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2002, all speed limits in the Houston–Galveston area were capped at 55&amp;nbsp;mph (89&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SIP Revisions - Houston/Galveston, December 2000 |publisher=Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission |url=http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/oprd/sips/dec2000hga.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205075512/http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/oprd/sips/dec2000hga.html |archivedate=2005-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facing immense opposition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghasp.org/publications/55chronicle.html Air Alliance Houston] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412020916/http://www.ghasp.org/publications/55chronicle.html# |date=April 12, 2013 }}.

Due to its enormous unpopularity, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality examined alternatives to the 55&amp;nbsp;mph speed cap. Analysis suggested that the vast majority of emissions reductions were from reduced heavy truck emissions. A proposed alternative was to restore passenger vehicle limits but retain a 55&amp;nbsp;mph truck speed limit. Concerns about safety problems and enforceability of such a large differential (up to 15&amp;nbsp;mph on many roads) scuttled that proposal, and a compromise plan, described above, was enacted that retained uniform, but still reduced, speed limits.

In 2003, the [[Texas Legislature]] prospectively banned environmental speed limits, effective September 1, 2003. The wording of the bill allows environmental speed limits already in place to remain, but no new miles of roadway may be subjected to environmental speed limits.&lt;ref&gt;;[http://www.dfwinfo.com/trans/env_speed_limits/ North Central Texas Council of Governments – NCTCOG.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elimination of Dallas-Fort Worth region environmental speed limits===
In 2009, the [[North Texas Tollway Authority]] raised the speed limit by 10&amp;nbsp;mph on two tollways. Several miles of these tollways had 60&amp;nbsp;mph environmental speed limits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntta.org/NR/rdonlyres/60659628-D501-4A53-842A-79C81A6C4D72/0/SpeedLimits_raisedonPGBTDNT_FAQ.pdf North Texas Tollway Authority] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302111534/http://www.ntta.org/NR/rdonlyres/60659628-D501-4A53-842A-79C81A6C4D72/0/SpeedLimits_raisedonPGBTDNT_FAQ.pdf# |date=March 2, 2012 }}.

NTTA.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[Texas Department of Transportation]] cancelled all remaining environmental speed limits in the Dallas-Fort Worth region. Some speed limits were changed back to those in place before the environmental speed limits were enacted. On some roads the speed limit was not changed. On other roads, including some that never had environmental speed limits, speed limits were raised higher than they were before the environmental speed limits were enacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Texas Transportation Commission |title=Minute Order |author=Carol Rawson |date=January 29, 2015 |url=http://ftp.dot.state.tx.us/pub/txdot/commission/2015/0129/14g.pdf}}{{page needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===75 mph limits===
Because Texas law allows 75&amp;nbsp;mph speed limits on any numbered state highway or city maintained road, it is the only state with 75&amp;nbsp;mph limits on two-lane roads. Speed studies undertaken by TxDOT in response to legislation passed in 2011 took about 2 years, and the result is that the mileage of highway with a speed limit of 75&amp;nbsp;mph has increased from about 1,400 to about 19,000.&lt;ref&gt;TxDOT Commission meetings [http://www.txdot.gov/inside-txdot/administration/commission/2012-meetings.html see speed zone minute orders in monthly agendas]&lt;/ref&gt; 70&amp;nbsp;mph speed limits have become rare on Texas interstates. They are retained in stretches of I-10 and I-35 in Bexar County, on I-410, on I-35 from San Antonio to Austin, and I-35W in [[Denton County]] well  Most Texas interstates had been posted at 70&amp;nbsp;mph, notably in east Texas and the panhandle for 16 years from December 1995/early 1996 to early 2012. Also, there are multiple urban Interstates and Tollways in Texas where there can be a 75 mph speed limit such as parts of [[Texas State Highway 45|State Highway 45]], [[Interstate 20 in Texas|I-20]] in Odessa and [[Midland, Texas|Midland]] (prior to Feb 2016, it is now 65 mph on I-20 in Odessa-Midland), and [[Interstate 10 in Texas|I-10]] in the outer parts of [[San Antonio]]

Factoring in rounding (most countries round speed limits to the nearest 5&amp;nbsp;mph or 10&amp;nbsp;km/h), the {{Convert|80|mi/h|km/h|0}} limit is approximately the same speed as the 130&amp;nbsp;km/h (81&amp;nbsp;mph) recommended speed on the [[Autobahn]] and the actual 130&amp;nbsp;km/h (81&amp;nbsp;mph) speed limit for freeway-class roads in thirteen European countries and the Australian [[Northern Territory]].

==US Virgin Islands==
For "motorcars, pick-up trucks, or motorcycles", the fastest speed limit in [[United States Virgin Islands|this territory]] is 55&amp;nbsp;mph and is found on one road, the divided highway and freeway known as the [[Melvin H. Evans Highway]] on the island of [[St. Croix]]. Outside of towns, these vehicles are limited to 35&amp;nbsp;mph unless posted lower, except on the above-mentioned [[divided highway]] and parts of Centerline Road, which is limited to 40&amp;nbsp;mph. Within towns, these vehicles are limited to 20&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Section 494. speed limits, Chapter 43, Part II, Title 20 of the Virgin Islands Code [http://michie.lexisnexis.com/virginislands/lpext.dll?f=templates&amp;fn=main-h.htm&amp;cp=]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Motor trucks and buses" are limited to 40&amp;nbsp;mph on St. Croix's main divided highway, 30&amp;nbsp;mph on other highways outside of towns, and 15&amp;nbsp;mph within towns.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In [[Utah]], there is a minimum speed limit of 45&amp;nbsp;mph on [[Interstate Highway]]s when conditions permit. The maximum speed limit on Interstates is normally 70&amp;nbsp;mph in cities and, on most highways, 80&amp;nbsp;mph elsewhere. UDOT has now implemented HB83, raising the speed limit to 80&amp;nbsp;mph on an additional 289 miles of rural interstate, including I-80 from Nevada to mile marker 99, I-84 from Idaho to I-15, and I-15 between [[Saint George, Utah]] and [[Mona, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/f?p%3D100%3Apg%3A0%3A%3A%3A1%3AT%2CV%3A64%2C67335 |accessdate=August 13, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814053916/http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/f?p=100:pg:0:::1:T,V:64,67335 |archivedate=August 14, 2014 }}&lt;!-- not at archive.org --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

I-80 is briefly posted 65&amp;nbsp;mph/truck speed: 55 between [[U.S. Route 40 in Utah|US 40]] and [[Wanship, Utah|Wanship]]. Speeds between Salt Lake City and [[Park City, Utah|Park City]] on I-80 are variable based on road conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.udot.utah.gov/2014/01/variable-speed-limit-signs-now-activated-on-i-80/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Mona south until [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]], excluding curvy sections and mountain passes, the speed limit is 80 miles per hour. Excluding a rural break in [[Iron County, Utah|Iron]] and [[Washington County, Utah|Washington]] counties, the speed limit on I-15 in the urban areas of [[Washington, Utah|Washington]], and [[St George, Utah|St George]] is 70 miles per hour until the southern border of [[Arizona]]. The speed limit on I-15 in Cedar City is 75 miles per hour.
* The [[Legacy Parkway]], running between [[North Salt Lake, Utah|North Salt Lake]] and [[Farmington, Utah|Farmington]], has posted speed limits of 55&amp;nbsp;mph along its entire length (of ten miles) due to environmental concerns at the time of its construction.

===80 mph speed limit===
On April 3, 2013, [[Utah Department of Transportation]] spokesman John Gleason said "We’d only do it in a situation that would make sense: flat, straight roadways. The Utah Department of Transportation is looking at expanding zones where it can increase the speed limit from 75 to 80 miles per hour. The Utah State Legislature recently approved a bill allowing for a series of zones to become permanent, as well as expanding them in other places around the state. UDOT began a study on Monday (April 1, 2013) to place more zones on rural parts of I-15, I-80 and I-84. The areas under consideration, UDOT spokesman said, are on I-80 from Grantsville (exit 99) to Wendover, on the Utah-Nevada border; I-84 from Tremonton to the Utah-Idaho border; I-15 from Brigham City (North interchange) to the Utah-Idaho border; and I-15 from Santaquin to North Leeds." The speed limit on these sections has been increased from  80&amp;nbsp;mph as of September 17, 2013.

On February 13, 2014, UDOT voted to increase the speed limit on [[Interstate 80|I-80]] from Salt Lake City across the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] to the Nevada border to {{convert|80|mph}}. The change went into effect on July 1, 2014.&lt;ref name="Bill will add more 80 mph speed limit areas in Utah"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bill will add more 80 mph speed limit areas in Utah |url=http://www.standard.net/stories/2014/02/13/bill-will-add-more-80-mph-speed-limit-areas-utah |newspaper=Standard Examiner |accessdate=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July 1, 2014, the state raised the speed limit on all rural interstates in Utah to 80&amp;nbsp;mph except I-80 from the [[Wyoming]] border to Salt Lake City, on I-84 from its junction with I-80 to [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]] and on twisty sections of [[Interstate 70]] from its I-15 junction to the [[Colorado]] border (the speed limit on I-70 still varies between 60&amp;nbsp;mph and 80&amp;nbsp;mph depending on the topography of the section of freeway.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Utah adds 289 miles of roads with 80 mph speed limits |url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/politics/56883181-90/already-driving-hull-limits.html.csp |newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune |accessdate=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speed limit on every other highway is 55&amp;nbsp;mph unless otherwise posted, although several two-lane, undivided roads have 65&amp;nbsp;mph speed limits, with divided sections of [[U.S. Route 40]] and [[U.S. Route 189]] posted at 65&amp;nbsp;mph as well.

By the end of 2016, UDOT raised speed limits to 80&amp;nbsp;mph on additional sections of [[Interstate 15|I-15]] and [[Interstate 70|I-70]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Jasen|url=https://www.ksl.com/?sid=42330346&amp;nid=148|publisher=KSL.com|date=November 24, 2016|accessdate=March 19, 2017|title=UDOT to raise speed limits in rural areas of I-15 and I-70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vermont==
The standard speed limit in [[Vermont]] stands at 50&amp;nbsp;mph. This is applied to rural two-lane roads. On urban freeways, divided at-grade expressways, and rural [[Two-lane expressway|two-lane limited access roads]], the speed limit is 55&amp;nbsp;mph, such as on I-189 and Interstate 89 in Burlington, and US Route 7 and Vermont State Route 279 outside of Bennington. Rural freeways are posted at 65&amp;nbsp;mph. Furthermore, the speed limit drops from 65&amp;nbsp;mph on rural highways to 40&amp;nbsp;mph at the approach to the Canada–US border on Interstates 89 and 91, at Highgate and Derby Line, respectively. In school zones, the speed limit can range from 20&amp;nbsp;mph to 25&amp;nbsp;mph, depending on local authority. The minimum speed is defined at 40&amp;nbsp;mph only on Interstate highways. That includes where the limit is posted at 55 and 65&amp;nbsp;mph. However, as old signs are being replaced, the "40 MINIMUM" is being phased out, keeping only "SPEED LIMIT 65".

==Virginia==
A [[Virginia]] statute provides that the default speed limit "shall be 55&amp;nbsp;mph on interstate highways or other limited access highways with divided roadways, nonlimited access highways having four or more lanes, and all state primary highways".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+46.2-870 Va. Code § 46.2-870, "Maximum speed limits generally"]. Leg1.state.va.us.&lt;/ref&gt; "The maximum speed limit on all other highways shall be 55 miles per hour if the vehicle is a passenger motor vehicle, bus, pickup or panel truck, or a motorcycle, but 45 miles per hour on such highways if the vehicle is a truck, tractor truck, or combination of vehicles designed to transport property, or is a motor vehicle being used to tow a vehicle designed for self-propulsion, or a house trailer."&lt;ref name="leg1.state.va.us"&gt;[http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+46.2-870 ''Id.'']. Leg1.state.va.us.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same statute contains a number of exceptions, however, allowing higher speed limits "where indicated by lawfully placed signs, erected subsequent to a traffic engineering study and analysis of available and appropriate accident and law-enforcement data".&lt;ref name="leg1.state.va.us"/&gt; This provision allows speed limits of up to 70&amp;nbsp;mph on Interstate highways; multilane, divided, limited-access highways; and express or [[high-occupancy vehicle lane]]s if said lanes are physically separated from the regular travel lanes. (As of August 2015, Virginia has three such barrier-separated facilities: [[high-occupancy vehicle lane]]s on [[Interstate 64 in Virginia|I-64]] in the Tidewater area; as well as [[Virginia HOT lanes|high-occupancy/toll "Express Lanes"]] on [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|I-495]] and [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|I-95]], and HOT/HOV lanes on [[Interstate 395 (Virginia)|I-395]], all in Northern Virginia.) The statute also allows 60-mph speed limits on a number of specified non-limited access, multilane, divided highways.&lt;ref name="leg1.state.va.us"/&gt;

The 70-mph provision was added to Section 46.2-870 via an amendment effective on July 1, 2010. The previous version of the statute had authorized a 70-mph speed limit only on [[Interstate 85 in Virginia|I-85]]; the maximum limit permitted elsewhere was 65&amp;nbsp;mph. Notably, the revised statute does not ''require'' a 70-mph speed limit on any road nor make such limit automatic, due to the requirement for traffic and engineering studies. The [[Virginia Department of Transportation]] began studying Interstate highways with 65-mph speed limits during April 2010 to determine which roads should receive the 70-mph limit and announced that the studies would be conducted in three phases over a period of several months, with the initial phase focusing on 323 miles of highway with "no significant levels of crashes and congestion".&lt;ref&gt;Va. Dept. of Transportation, ''Speed Limits'', [http://www.virginiadot.org/info/faq/70_mph_speed_limit.asp] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201164022/http://www.virginiadot.org/info/faq/70_mph_speed_limit.asp# |date=February 1, 2014 }} (posted June 7, 2010; accessed June 16, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 1, 2010, VDOT increased the speed limit to 70&amp;nbsp;mph on a portion of one highway ([[Interstate 295 (Virginia)|I-295]] south of [[Interstate 64 in Virginia|I-64]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.timesdispatch.com/business/2010/jun/25/vdot25-ar-231096/ Stretch of I-295 will have 70-mph speed limit] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701221738/http://www2.timesdispatch.com/business/2010/jun/25/vdot25-ar-231096/# |date=July 1, 2010 }}. ''Richmond Times-Dispatch'' (June 25, 2010. Retrieved July 1, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; On October 20, 2010, Governor [[Bob McDonnell]] announced that by the end of 2010, VDOT would post 70-mph speed limits on 680 miles of Virginia Interstates located outside of urban areas, representing 61 percent of Virginia's total 1,119 miles of Interstate highways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roanoke.com/news/breaking/wb/264541 Gov. McDonnell: Interstate speed limits can increase to 70 mph]. Roanoke Times (2010-10-20, retrieved October 20, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; While the statute allows for speed limits up to 70&amp;nbsp;mph on urban Interstates, as of March 2015 VDOT has declined to post a limit higher than 65&amp;nbsp;mph on any urban highway other than I-295 in Richmond.

The statute also allows 70-mph speed limits on routes other than Interstates. Initially VDOT declined to consider any such routes for the higher limit, but in early 2012 VDOT posted a 70-mph limit on a portion of US-29 near [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Marshall (February 24, 2012).

The News &amp; Advance (Retrieved February 27, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Virginia statutes prescribe exceptions to the general rules set forth above. The notable aspect of Virginia's current speed limit laws is that the Department of Transportation has no authority to raise speed limits above the statutory limits unless the General Assembly passes a statute permitting the change. Since the [[National Maximum Speed Law]] was repealed in 1995, such statutory exceptions were largely confined to a highway-by-highway basis, as evidenced by the list of 60-mph exceptions in Va. Code § 46.2-870.

Notably, Virginia's reckless driving statute provides that driving 20&amp;nbsp;mph over the speed limit, or in excess of 80&amp;nbsp;mph regardless of the posted speed limit, is grounds for a reckless driving ticket. Thus, in a 70-mph zone traveling 11&amp;nbsp;mph over the speed limit is prosecutable as a misdemeanor with penalties of up to a $2,500 fine and/or 12 months in jail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+46.2-862 Virginia code 46.2-862] retrieved January 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginia law does not prescribe a fixed minimum speed limit, although a statute does authorize the posting of such limits where traffic and engineering studies indicate that they would be appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+46.2-877 Va. Code § 46.2-877, "Minimum speed limits"]. Leg1.state.va.us.&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginia is the only state that prohibits the use of [[radar detectors]] (the District of Columbia does as well, though it is not a state).

Effective July 1, 2018, higher speed limits (60 mph) should be coming to the expressway portions of U.S. 301, U.S. 501 between South Boston and the NC line (HB 55) and more sections of U.S. 17.  In addition expressway portions of VA routes 3 and 207 are scheduled to see increases to 60 mph. (SB 466, HB 73 and 684.)

==Wake Island==
The speed limit on [[Wake Island]] is 40 mph (64 km/h).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2002/04/09/02-8303/wake-island-code Wake Island Code. Retrieved 8 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Washington==
The Revised Code of Washington permits speed limits of 75&amp;nbsp;mph in sections deemed appropriate by an engineering study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.61.410 Revised Code of Washington, "Increases by secretary of transportation"]&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2016, the typical speed limit on a [[Washington (state)|Washington]] freeway is 70&amp;nbsp;mph rural, 60&amp;nbsp;mph urban (the speed limits on these types of freeways only vary in the [[Tri-Cities, Washington|Tri Cities]]), with a truck speed limit no higher than 60&amp;nbsp;mph. The posted truck speed limit does not apply to any auto stage towing a trailer or trucks less than 10,000 pounds gross weight. Limits were raised to current speeds following the elimination of the federal 55&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit, to more closely reflect the common speeds of traffic at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19960208&amp;slug=2313104 The Seattle Times, "State Releases Plan To Raise Speed Limits"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Washington State does not have a standard legislated statewide speed limit, leaving it to [[WSDOT]] to set individual speed limits for specific segments of road. This has resulted in a wide range of speed limits statewide, with many rural undivided 2 lane highways set at 65&amp;nbsp;mph, while some congested urban divided highways have limits as low as 40&amp;nbsp;mph.

The default speed limit on a rural 2-lane highway in Washington is 60; however, the limit on undivided highways varies. In mountainous country like the Cascades and Olympic Mountains, certain twisty roads are limited to 55&amp;nbsp;mph, whereas some flat, straight highways in eastern Washington have a limit of 65. The speed limit for motorhomes and autos with trailers is 60 like it is for trucks. Roads with traffic lights are limited to 55&amp;nbsp;mph. The school zone speed limit is 20&amp;nbsp;mph but is in effect only if children are present. Divided highways in Washington are rare, however, [[U.S. Route 395]] between Pasco and Ritzville is a high-speed divided highway with a maximum speed limit of 70&amp;nbsp;mph.

Some areas within Washington State use [[variable speed limit]]s such as on portions of [[Interstate 90 in Washington|I-90]] between Seattle and Issaquah and over [[Snoqualmie Pass]].

On January 23rd, 2017, the WSDOT considered raising the speed limit on [[I-90]] between Ellensburg and [[Spokane]] to 75 mph, but decided to retain the 70 mph limit.

==West Virginia==
The speed limit on most rural Interstates is 70&amp;nbsp;mph. Urban Interstate speed limits generally vary from 55&amp;nbsp;mph to 65&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;
 {{cite web |url=http://www.carinsurancepedia.com/states/west-virginia/ |title=West Virginia Automotive Facts |publisher=CarInsurancePedia |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sections of [[Interstate 64 in West Virginia|I-64]] and [[Interstate 68 in West Virginia|I-68]] have lower truck speed limits because of steep grades; otherwise, West Virginia does not post separate truck speed limits. The West Virginia Turnpike between Chelyan and Mahan has a 60&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit because of sharp curves.

Speed limits on 4-lane divided highways are normally 65&amp;nbsp;mph although some stretches within cities are posted as low as 50&amp;nbsp;mph. Open country highways have a [[Statute|statutory]] limit of 55&amp;nbsp;mph, which includes most rural two-lane highways and even includes some one lane back country roads or any road without a posted speed limit. Cities and towns set their own speed limits, which are usually between 25 and 55&amp;nbsp;mph. [[School zones]] have a [[Statute|statutory]] speed limit of 20&amp;nbsp;mph. Speed limits are commonly reduced by 15&amp;nbsp;mph in work zones.

On April 7, 2017, the [[West Virginia House of Delegates|House of Delegates]] passed a resolution that asks the [[West Virginia Department of Transportation|Department of Highways]] to study increasing the speed limit to 75 mph on rural interstates where deemed safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wsaz.com/content/news/W-Va-House-passes-resolution-to-increase-speed-limit-to-75-mph--418690193.html|title=W.Va.

On January 10, 2018, West Virginia lawmakers made a bill which would increase speed limits on interstates and limited access highways in rural areas to 80 mph. If that is done, West Virginia could become the 8th state to increase its speed limit to 80 mph, and it would be the third eastern state with a speed limit of greater than 70 mph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wsaz.com/content/news/Proposal-would-raise-speed-limits-to-80-mph-in-areas-468682943.html|title=Proposal would raise speed limits to 80 mph in areas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wisconsin==
The state of [[Wisconsin]]'s speed limits are set out in statutory law but may often be modified by the maintaining government entity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.wi.us/statutes/Stat0346.pdf Wisconsin Statutes Chapter 346 "Rules of the Road", Subchapter IX, "Speed Restrictions" §57 (346.57)]. (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a basic speed rule, Wisconsin law specifies certain occasions where reduced speeds are required including{{emdash}}and not limited to the approaches and traverses of [[level crossing|rail crossings]], winding roads, roads where people are present, and the crests of grades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.wi.us/statutes/Stat0346.pdf Wisconsin Statutes Chapter 346 "Rules of the Road", Subchapter IX "Speed Restrictions" §57 subsections 2 &amp; 3 (346.57)]. (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no numeric minimum speed limit, state law prohibits the impediment of traffic by unreasonably slow speeds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.wi.us/statutes/Stat0346.pdf Wisconsin Statutes Chapter 346 "Rules of the Road", Subchapter IX "Speed Restrictions" §59 "Minimum speed regulation" (346.59)]. (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt; Vehicles that lack rubber [[tire]]s filled with compressed air and/or carry a [[Slow moving vehicle|slow moving vehicle orange safety triangle]] have a hard limit of 20&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.wi.us/statutes/Stat0346.pdf Wisconsin Statutes Chapter 346 "Rules of the Road", Subchapter IX "Speed Restrictions" §58 "Special speed restrictions for certain vehicles" (346.58)]. (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of Wisconsin has four default speed limits.&lt;ref name="legis.state.wi.us"&gt;[http://www.legis.state.wi.us/statutes/Stat0346.pdf Wisconsin Statutes Chapter 346 "Rules of the Road", Subchapter IX "Speed Restrictions" §57 subsection 4 (346.57)]. (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt; 20&amp;nbsp;mph limits apply in [[school zone]]s (on major roads during school arrival and dismissal periods only), near parks with children, and in [[alley]]s. 10&amp;nbsp;mph default speed limits apply, unless modified by the managing authority, on "service roads" within corporate limits. Within municipal boundaries and in areas of dense urban development a 35&amp;nbsp;mph limit is in effect unless another speed limit is indicated. In some jurisdictions, the 25&amp;nbsp;mph limit is the default speed limit for residential areas. The entry to such an area is to be marked by speed limit signs. Outside of built-up areas (these include denser business, industrial or residential land uses according to the relevant law) a 55&amp;nbsp;mph limit is effective in the absence of other indications.

While all 2 lane roads maintained by WisDOT as of 2015 have a 55&amp;nbsp;mph maximum, a small portion of [[Minnesota State Highway 23]] that passes through the state south of [[Superior, Wisconsin|Superior]] but is maintained by MNDOT has a 60&amp;nbsp;mph limit through the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2014 Report on the Evaluation of Certain Highway Speed Limits |date=January 2015 |publisher=Minnesota Department of Transportation  |url=http://www.dot.state.mn.us/govrel/reports/2015/2015-Evaluation-of-Certain-Speed-Limits-report.pdf}}{{page needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the aforementioned default speed limits, there are other statutory speed limits that more often require signs to be effective.&lt;ref name="legis.state.wi.us"/&gt; 70&amp;nbsp;mph limits on freeways and 65&amp;nbsp;mph limits on [[Limited-access road|expressways]] require signs to be effective. The default speed limit on these types of roads is 55&amp;nbsp;mph as they do not directly interact with the built-up environment. In the densest urban districts a statutory 25&amp;nbsp;mph limit is effective when adequate signage is used, as are 35&amp;nbsp;mph limits in areas of light development. The same applies to 45&amp;nbsp;mph limits on highways designated as "rustic" roads. However, "an alleged failure to post [such a speed limit sign] is not a defense to a prosecution" in the case of such statutory limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=November 3, 2015 |author=Rachelle Baillon  |title=Drivers take note: 70 m.p.h. speed limit added to several new routes in southeast Wisconsin |publisher=Fox6now.com |url=http://fox6now.com/2015/11/03/wisdot-70-mph-speed-limit-added-to-new-routes-in-southeastern-wisconsin/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wyoming==
[[Wyoming]]'s highest speed limit is 80&amp;nbsp;mph, found on its Interstate highways, and 70&amp;nbsp;mph on its four lane divided highways. The speed limit for school zones is 20&amp;nbsp;mph, 30&amp;nbsp;mph in urban districts and residential areas, 70&amp;nbsp;mph for other paved roads, and 55&amp;nbsp;mph for unpaved roads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legisweb.state.wy.us/statutes/statutes.aspx?file=titles/Title31/T31CH5AR3.htm Article 3 - Speed Regulations]&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Interstate 80 in Wyoming|I-80]] in [[Evanston, Wyoming|Evanston]] and [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]], [[Interstate 25 in Wyoming|I-25]] in Cheyenne and [[Casper, Wyoming|Casper]], and [[Interstate 90 in Wyoming|I-90]] in [[Buffalo, Wyoming|Buffalo]], the speed limit is 65 mph.

In February 2014, the state Assembly passed a bill that would raise the speed limit from 75 to 80&amp;nbsp;mph on certain freeway segments that would meet safety standards. The bill passed the Senate on Feb 25 and raised the speed limit on certain freeway sections to 80&amp;nbsp;mph on July 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wyoming House endorses higher highway speed limit |author=Kyle Roerink |agency=Casper Star-Tribune |date=February 25, 2014

On February 1, 2016, the speed limit on WY 120 (two lane highway) from the Chief Joseph Highway to the Montana border increased to 70&amp;nbsp;mph. Two other two lane highway sections, WYO 130 from Interstate 80 south to Saratoga and US 85 from east of I-25 to Newcastle, increased to 70&amp;nbsp;mph.

'''Sustainable redevelopment''' is the [[doctrine]] within which a state, organization, or individual can work to recreate a [[Socio-economic status|socio-economic position]] attained prior to a deconstructive event while upholding sustainable and environmental practices. The doctrine is based on [[economics]] within [[environmentalism]]. Typically, by providing more upfront capital, one can create a system that is less energy intensive, less wasteful, and generally less expensive to maintain in the long run.&lt;ref name="DFD"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/dsd/dsd_index.shtml |title=Division for Sustainable Development :: About |author=[[United Nations]] |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By redeveloping sustainably, long term [[energy conservation|energy efficiencies]] can be realized, coupled with highly reduced [[greenhouse gas emissions]].

Within the ideals of [[nation-building]], sustainable redevelopment can take up a greater significance. Post-[[disaster]] countries are in a unique situation to deal with these systems of ideals. Within this context, the idea behind initiating post-trauma sustainable redevelopment is that the underlying [[infrastructure]] is destroyed or damaged, therefore the situation is ideal for realizing the opportunities inherent to the situation.

==Background==
[[Sustainable development]] and [[redevelopment]] are closely linked, and several organizations have been implicitly involved with sustainable development. This type of development, in contrast to redevelopment, is not different other than the application to a specified problem. Sustainable development, is a form of development that coexists with existing forms of development.

While the systems for recreation on a small/local level are not universally widespread, there are several institutions which engage in sustainable development, that can theoretically be carried over to redevelopment. The [[Kyoto Protocol]]'s 12th Article&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/mechanisms/clean_development_mechanism/items/2718.php |title=Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)  |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  speaks to "flexible mechanisms". These mechanisms allow countries which have ratified the Kyoto Protocol to lower their overall emissions through the most economical means, respective, of course, to that country. Theoretically, these mechanisms could be directed towards post-traumatic redevelopment.

==UN==
The United Nations Division for Sustainable Development "provides [[leadership]] and is an authoritative source of expertise within the United Nations system on sustainable development".&lt;ref name="DFD"/&gt; The Division for Sustainable Development has been essential in the creation of such policies as [[Agenda 21]], and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation.&lt;ref name="DFD"/&gt;

The [[United Nations]] declares that "Sustainable reconstruction management provides numerous environmental, safety and financial benefits."&lt;ref name="DFD"/&gt;

==World Bank==
The [[World Bank]] has been working on sustainable development projects through one of their internal groups, the Sustainable Development Network. These two groups work together to provide key sectors for sustainable development: "[[agriculture]] and [[rural development]], [[energy]], [[transport]], [[water]], [[Natural environment|environment]], [[urban development]], [[social development]], [[oil]], [[gas]], [[mining]], and [[chemical]]s, [[Information technology|information]] and [[Communication technology|communication]] technologies, and sub-national activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTSDNET /0,,contentMDK:22113416~menuPK:64885073~pagePK:64885161~piPK:64884432~theSitePK:5929282,00.html |title=Sustainable Development - About Sustainable Development |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=6 July 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Natural Hazards Institute==
The Natural Hazards Research and Application Information Center of the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] produced a work catalyzing the process for post-disaster sustainable redevelopment. In their book, “Holistic Disaster Recovery”, is spelled out the “Six Principles of [[Sustainability]]”

==The Six Principles of Sustainability==
1. Maintain and, if possible, enhance, its residents [[quality of life]].
2. Enhance local economic vitality.
3. Ensure social and intergenerational equity.
4. Maintain and, if possible, enhance, environmental quality.
5. Incorporate disaster resilience and [[Disaster mitigation|mitigation]].
6. Use a consensus-building, participatory process when making
decisions &lt;ref&gt;Natural Hazards Research and Applications Information Center. ''Holistic Disaster Recovery, Ideas for Building Local Sustainability After a Natural Disaster''. University of Colorado, 2001. Web. 19 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Anatomy of Power''''' is a [[1983 in literature|1983]] book by [[Harvard University|Harvard]] [[economist]] [[John Kenneth Galbraith]].  It sought to classify three types of power: ''compensatory power'' in which submission is bought, ''condign power'' in which submission is won by making the alternative sufficiently painful, and ''conditioned power'' in which submission is gained by persuasion.  In short; money, force and ideology.

It further divided power by source: power either stems from ''personality'' or leadership, ''property'' or wealth, or ''organisation''.

The book goes on to detail a brief history of the use of power, noting the broad arc of history in moving away from condign and towards compensatory and then conditioned power, and from personality and property towards organisation.  Finally, it details what Galbraith views as the main sources of power in the modern world: government, the military, religion and the press.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2305">'''Works of authority on the United Kingdom constitution''' are books written by constitutional theorists that are considered to be authoritative guides to the [[UK constitution]]. The United Kingdom has no written Constitution, thus these are guides as to the rules and customs of the land. They can be adopted or overidden by acts of Parliament.&lt;ref name="Bingham"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793208482|title=The Rule of Law|last=Bingham|first=Thomas|date=2011-07-07|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=9780141962016|location=London|oclc=793208482|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most prominent works of authority are:
* [[Walter Bagehot]]'s ''[[The English Constitution]]'' (1867)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3g0QAAAAYAAJ|title=The English constitution|last=Bagehot|first=Walter|date=1867|publisher=Chapman and Hall|location=London|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''An Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution'' (1885) by [[A. V. Dicey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/977548368|title=Introduction to the study of the law of the constitution.|last=Dicey|first=A. V|date=1886|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''A Treatise on the Law, Privileges, Proceedings and Usage of Parliament'' (popularly known as ''[[Erskine May: Parliamentary Practice|Parliamentary Practice]]''), first published in 1844, by [[Erskine May, 1st Baron Farnborough|Erskine May]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/6435965|title=A treatise upon the law, privileges, proceedings and usage of Parliament.|last=May|first=Thomas Erskine|date=1844|publisher=C. Knight &amp; Co.|location=London|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Rule of Law'' by [[Tom Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill|Lord Bingham]]&lt;ref name="Bingham" /&gt;

The former two are now historical, while the latter two are regularly updated to reflect developments in [[parliamentary procedure]].
