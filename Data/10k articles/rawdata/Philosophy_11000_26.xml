      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20931">The '''AICPA Code of Professional Conduct''' is a collection of codified statements issued by the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] that outline a [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]]'s ethical and professional responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aicpa.org/Research/Standards/CodeofConduct/Pages/et_50.aspx AICPA Code of Professional Conduct, Section ET 51.02, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, June 1st, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The code establishes standards for auditor independence, integrity and objectivity, responsibilities to clients and colleagues and acts discreditable to the accounting profession. The AICPA is responsible for drafting, revising and reissuing the code annually, on June 1. The current Code is available at the [http://www.aicpa.org/RESEARCH/STANDARDS/CODEOFCONDUCT/Pages/default.aspx AICPA] Web site. For older versions of the Code, see the links below.

==History==
[[Joseph Edmund Sterrett]] outlined the debate and issues in setting up a Code of Professional Conduct in his address to the annual meeting of the American Association of Public Accountants in 1907 &lt;ref&gt;[http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/u?/deloitte,23069 Sterrett, Joseph Edmund. "Professional Ethics. In ''Proceedings of the Annual Meeting at St. Paul, Minn., October Fourteenth--Seventeenth, Nineteen Hundred and Seven.''  American Association of Public Accountants. Pp. 108-133]&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest "official" version of the code of professional conduct among American accountants was issued by the American Institute of Accountants on April 9, 1917.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/u?/aicpa,66550 Code of Professional Conduct, American Institute of Accountants, April 9, 1917]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/u?/aah,318 Marquette, R. Penny. "Ethics, Professional." In ''History of Accounting: An International Encyclopedia,'' edited by [[Michael Chatfield]] and [[Richard Vangermeersch]]. New York: Garland Publishing, pp. 233-235]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable sections==
===Section 51 - Preamble ===
The opening principle of the code is that membership, and therefore adherence, to the code is voluntary. This means that an accountant is never under a legal responsibility to adhere to the code, and can renounce the code and membership in the AICPA at any time.

===Section 101 - Independence ===
Section 101 sets forth the various requirements to establish auditor independence and conditions that nullify it. Knowingly allowing a member who is not independent to continue to work on an engagement can result in disciplinary action from the AICPA, including possible revocation of the members status as a [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]]. Generally, the following actions will impair auditor independence:
* Authorizing, executing or consummating a transaction, or otherwise exercising authority on behalf of a client or having the authority to do so.
* Preparing source documents, in electronic or other form, evidencing the occurrence of a transaction.
* Having custody of client assets.
* Supervising client employees in the performance of their normal recurring activities.
* Determining which recommendations of the member should be implemented.
* Reporting to the board of directors on behalf of management.
* Serving as a client's stock transfer or escrow agent, registrar, general counsel or its equivalent.
* Establishing or maintaining internal controls, including performing ongoing monitoring activities.

Auditor independence is impaired if a member on the engagement team has a direct or material indirect financial interest in the client. Member's on the engagement team are not allowed to be on the board of trustees of a trust that owns, or has committed to owning more than 10% of the client's equity. A member or any of their immediate family are not allowed to own more than 5% of the clients equity. For the period being audited, the auditor is not allowed to operate as an officer, director, manager, promoter, underwriter or voting trustee for the client. If a member leaves the auditing firm and is employed by the client, the entire firms independence is deemed to be impaired. If an audit member is made a job offer by the client and does not immediately report and remove themselves from the engagement, their independence is impaired. However, if the member does report the job offer and rejects it, and is no longer being considered for a position with the client, then their independence is not impaired.

When the auditing member has a previous employment relationship with the client, barring certain exceptions, the auditor is required to liquidate any employee welfare programs that they have vested benefits in and collect or pay any loans outstanding to the client. The immediate family of the auditor is considered part of the test for impairment of independence. The exception to this is that the immediate family members of auditors are allowed to work for the client in non-management roles. If the auditor provides non-attest services such as tax support or consulting, they are required to adhere to the independence requirements of other regulatory bodies that govern those services. Failure to do so will impair their independence for their audit engagement as well.

'''Abner of Burgos''' (c. 1270 – c. 1347, or a little later) was a Jewish philosopher, a convert to Christianity and [[polemical]] writer against his former religion. Known after his conversion as '''Alfonso of Valladolid'''.

==Life==
As a student he acquired a certain mastery in Biblical and Talmudical studies, to which he added an intimate acquaintance with [[Peripatetic philosophy]] and [[astrology]]. He was graduated as a physician at 25, but throughout a long life he seems to have found the struggle for existence a hard one. In 1295, he reportedly treated a number of Jews for distress following their experiences in the failed messianic movement in Avila. As Abner reports in his ''Moreh Zedek/Mostrador de justicia,'' he himself "had a dream" in which a similar experience of crosses mysteriously appearing on his garments drove him to question his ancestral faith.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan Szpiech, ''Conversion and Narrative: Reading and Religious Authority in Medieval Polemic'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2013, chapter 5, pp.&amp;nbsp;143–73&lt;/ref&gt;

Not being of those contented ones who, as [[Moses Narboni]] says in his ''Maamar ha-Beḥirah'' (Essay on the Freedom of the Will; quoted by Grätz, p.&amp;nbsp;488), are satisfied with a peck of [[locust bean]]s from one Friday to another, he resolved to embrace Christianity though at the advanced age of sixty, according to [[Paulus de Santa Maria|Pablo de Santa María]] (''Scrutinium Scripturarum''); according to other writers he took this step soon after he was graduated in medicine. According to the statements of his contemporaries, such as Narboni, he converted, not from spiritual conviction, but for the sake of temporal advantage. Something of the apostate's pricking conscience seems to have remained with him, however, although he was immediately rewarded with a [[sacristan]]'s post in the prominent Metropolitan Church in [[Valladolid]] (whence he took the name of Alfonso of Valladolid). The argument that Abner converted for material gain is put into question by the fact that his post as a sacristan was extremely modest and he never, throughout his long and public polemical career after conversion (c. 1320-1347) advanced in his post to something more lucrative.

==Polemics==
Abner's most distinguishing characteristic was his use of postbiblical literature, including hundreds of Talmudic and Midrashic sources as well as much medieval Jewish and Arabic (in translation) literature, all in an effort to prove the truth of Christianity. Equally striking is the fact that he wrote his anti-Judaism polemics in Hebrew, unlike virtually every polemicist in the history of Christianity. His most major work, the ''Moreh Zedek'' (Teacher of Righteousness), which now survives only in a 14th-century Castilian translation as ''Mostrador de Justicia'', is one of the longest and most elaborate polemics against Judaism ever written and is one of the key sources for the history of anti-Jewish thought in thirteenth and fourteenth century Western Europe. Abner's text rivals (and in many ways surpasses) the ''[[Pugio Fidei]]'' in length, complexity, variety of sources, and psychological impact, although there is no evidence that Abner actually knew of the polemical Dominican work.

In an essay entitled ''Minhat Qenaot'' (A Jealousy Offering), he argued that man's actions are determined by [[planetary influence]], and he reinterpreted the notion of choice and free will in light of that determinism. Both his conversion and this defense of determinism aroused protests from his former Jewish study-partner, [[Isaac Pulgar]], marked by great bitterness.  Abner also exchanged a number of polemical letters with local Jews, which have survived along with the responses by each and the final riposte to all the letters by Abner, a short work known as the ''Teshuvot ha-Meshubot''.

Abner presented charges before [[Alfonso XI of Castile]], accusing his former brethren of using a prayer-formula in their ritual which blasphemed the Christian God and cursed all Christians.  The king ordered a public investigation at Valladolid, in which the representatives of the Jewish community were confronted with Abner. The conclusion was announced in the shape of a royal edict forbidding the use of the formula in question (February, 1336); a barren victory on both sides, for the Jews had no idea of ever using it, and Abner failed to prove that they had. He further accused the Jews, for instance, of constantly warring among themselves and splitting into hostile religious schisms; in support of this statement he adduces an alleged list of the "sects" prevailing among them: [[Sadducees]], [[Samaritans]], and other extinct division. He makes two "sects" of [[Pharisees]] and [[Rabbinites]], says that cabalists believe in a tenfold God, and speaks of a brand-new "sect" believing in a dual Deity, God and [[Metatron]].

==Works==
The following is a list of Abner's writings:
#The ''Moreh Zedek'' (Teacher of Righteousness), surviving only as the ''Mostrador de justicia'' (Paris BN MS Esp. 43, consisting of a dialogue containing ten chapters of discussions between a religious teacher (Abner?) and a Jewish controversialist.
#''Teshuvot la-Meharef'' (Response to the Blasphemer), also in Castilian translation, ''Respuestas al blasfemo'' (Rome. Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana MS 6423)
#Polemical letters and the ''Teshuvot ha-Meshubot''.
#The ''Libro de la ley''
#The determinist philosophical work ''Minhat Qenaot'' (Offering of Zeal), surviving only in Castilian translation as ''Ofrenda de Zelos'' or ''Libro del Zelo de Dios'' (Rome. Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana MS 6423)
#A Mathematical treatise ''Meyyasher Aqob'' (Straightening the Curve)

Some of his lost works may include:
# A supercommentary on [[Abraham ibn Ezra|Ibn Ezra]]'s commentary on the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]], written before his apostasy.
# '[[Milhamoth ha-Shem|'Sefer Milhamot Adonai'']] ("Wars of the Lord"). This too was translated into Spanish, by request of the [[Infanta Doña Blanca]], prioress of a convent in Burgos, under the similar title "Las Batallas de Dios."
# ''La Concordia de las Leyes,'' an attempt to provide Old Testament foundations for Christian dogmas. According to Reinhardt and Santiago (p.&amp;nbsp;86, n. 10.4) this text is found in Paris BN MS Esp. 43.
# ''Iggeret ha-Gezerah'' (Epistle on Fate).

Some of the works falsely attributed to him include:
# ''Libro de las tres gracias,'' Madrid Biblioteca Nacional MS 9302 (Kayserling). The title is a misreading of ''Libro de las tres creencias.'' According to Reinhardt and Santiago (pp.&amp;nbsp;86–88, n. 10.5) the text is also found in Escorial MSS h.III.3 and P.III.21, where it is called the ''Libro declarante.''
#''Libro de las hadas'' (also attributed to the Pseudo-San Pedro Pascual). According to Reinhardt and Santiago (p.&amp;nbsp;88, n. 10.6) this text is also found in Escorial MSS h.III.3 and P.III.21
#''Sermones a los moros y judios.'' Found as anonymous in Soria: Casa de la Cultura, MS 25-H (Reinhardt and Santiago, p.&amp;nbsp;314, n. 143.6)
#The ''Epistola Rabbi Samualis'' and ''Disputatio Abutalib'' of Alfonsus Bonihiminis.

{{about|the philosophical term||Aletheia (disambiguation)}}

'''''Aletheia''''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἀλήθεια|ἀλήθεια]]}}) is truth or disclosure in philosophy. It was used in Ancient Greek philosophy and revived in the 20th century by [[Martin Heidegger]].

It is a [[Greek (language)|Greek]] word variously translated as "unclosedness", "unconcealedness", "[[world disclosure|disclosure]]" or "[[truth]]". The literal meaning of the word {{lang|grc|[[alpha privative|ἀ]]–[[Lethe|λήθ]]εια}} is "the state of not being hidden; the state of being [[evidence|evident]]." It also means factuality or reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)lh/qeia|ἀλήθεια|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the opposite of [[lethe]], which literally means "oblivion", "forgetfulness", or "concealment".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|lh/qh|λήθη|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pindar's Olympian Ode,&lt;ref&gt;Pindar Olympian Ode.11.6 ff (trans. Conway) (Greek lyric C5th B.C.)&lt;/ref&gt; Aletheia is the daughter of Zeus, while Aesop in his Fables&lt;ref&gt;Aesop, Fables 530 (from Phaedrus Appendix 5)&lt;/ref&gt; said that she was crafted by Prometheus.

==Heidegger and ''aletheia''==
{{Further information|World disclosure}}
[[File:Van-gogh-shoes.jpg|thumb|300px|A painting that reveals (''alethe'') a whole world.  Heidegger mentions this particular work of Van Gogh's in "[[The Origin of the Work of Art]]".]]

In the early to mid 20th-century, [[Martin Heidegger]] brought renewed attention to the concept of ''aletheia'', by relating it to the notion of [[world disclosure|disclosure]], or the way in which things appear as entities in the world. While he initially referred to ''aletheia'' as "truth", specifically a form that is [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] in origin, Heidegger eventually corrected this interpretation, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To raise the question of ''aletheia'', of disclosure as such, is not the same as raising the question of truth. For this reason, it was inadequate and misleading to call ''aletheia'', in the sense of opening, truth."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''On Time and Being'' (New York: Harper and Row, 1972), p. 70, translation amended. The original in ''Zur Sache des Denkens'' (Tübingen: Max Niemayer, 1969), p. 86. Cited in [[Nikolas Kompridis]], ''Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future,'' (Boston: MIT Press, 2006), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heidegger gave an [[etymology|etymological]] analysis of ''aletheia'' and drew out an understanding of the term as 'unconcealedness'.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, M.  "Parmenides". Translated by Andre Schuwer and Richard Rojcewicz, Bloomington and Indianapolis, Indiana University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''aletheia'' is distinct from conceptions of truth understood as statements which accurately describe a state of affairs ([[Correspondence theory of truth|correspondence]]), or statements which fit properly into a system taken as a whole ([[Coherence theory of truth|coherence]]).  Instead, Heidegger focused on the elucidation of how an [[ontology|ontological]] "world" is disclosed, or opened up, in which things are made intelligible for human beings in the first place, as part of a holistically structured background of meaning.

Heidegger also wrote that "''Aletheia'', disclosure regarded as the opening of presence, is not yet truth. Is ''aletheia'' then less than truth? Or is it more because it first grants truth as ''adequatio'' and ''certitudo'', because there can be no presence and presenting outside of the realm of the opening?"&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''On Time and Being'' (New York: Harper and Row, 1972), p. 69, translation amended. Cited in Nikolas Kompridis, ''Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future,'' (Boston: MIT Press, 2006), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger began his discourse on the reappropriation of ''aletheia'' in his magnum opus, ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927),&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, M. ''Being and Time''. translated by Joan Stambaugh, Albany, State University of New York Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded on the concept in his ''Introduction to Metaphysics''. For more on his understanding of ''aletheia'', see ''Poetry, Language, and Thought'', in particular the essay entitled "[[The Origin of the Work of Art]]", which describes the value of the work of art as a means to open a "clearing" for the appearance of things in the world, or to disclose their meaning for human beings.&lt;ref&gt;According to Heidegger, art "gives things their look, and human beings their outlook." From "The Origin of the Work of Art."&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger revised his views on ''aletheia'' as truth, after nearly forty years, in the essay "The End of Philosophy and the Task of Thinking," in ''On Time and Being''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7340">'''Anti-foundationalism''' (also called '''nonfoundationalism''') is any philosophy which rejects a [[Foundationalism|foundationalist]] approach. An anti-foundationalist is one who does not believe that there is some fundamental belief or principle which is the basic ground or foundation of inquiry and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi, ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC right}}

==Anti-essentialism==

Anti-foundationalists use logical or historical or genealogical attacks on foundational concepts (see especially [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] and [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]), often coupled with alternative methods for justifying and forwarding intellectual inquiry, such as the pragmatic subordination of knowledge to practical action.&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi, ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 240-1&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault dismissed the search for a return to origins as Platonic essentialism, preferring to stress the contingent nature of human practices.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Gutting ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Foucault'' (2007) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-foundationalists oppose [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] methods. Moral and ethical anti-foundationalists are often criticized for [[moral relativism]], but anti-foundationalists often dispute this charge, offering alternative methods of moral thought that they claim do not require foundations. Thus while [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] accused Foucault of having "no order of human life, or way we are, or human nature, that one can appeal to in order to judge or evaluate between ways of life", Foucault nevertheless insists on the need for continuing ethical enquiry ''without'' any universal system to appeal to.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Bernauer/M.Mahon, 'Michel Foucault's Ethical Imagination', in Gutting ed., p. 149-50&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Niklas Luhmann]] used [[cybernetics]] to challenge the role of foundational unities and canonical certainties.&lt;ref&gt;Niklas Luhmann, ''Theories of Distinction'' (2002) p. 192 and p. 110-12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Totalisation and legitimation==

Antifoundationalists oppose totalising visions of social, scientific or historical reality, considering them to lack legitimation,&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi/C. Garratt, ''Postmodernism for beginners'' (Cambridge 1995) p. 105-9&lt;/ref&gt; and preferring local narratives instead. No social totality but a multitude of local and concrete practices; "not ''a'' history but at best histories".&lt;ref&gt;E. D. Ermath, ''Sequel to History'' (Princeton 1992) p. 56-66&lt;/ref&gt; In such [[neopragmatism]], there is no overall truth, merely an ongoing process of better and more fruitful methods of edification.&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi, ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; Even our most taken for granted categories for social analysis—of gender, sex, race, and class—are considered by anti-essentialists like [[Marjorie Garber]] as [[social constructs]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (1994) p. 122-130&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hope and fear==

[[Stanley Fish]] distinguishes between what he calls "antifoundationalist theory hope" and "antifoundationalist theory fear"—finding them however both equally illusory.&lt;ref&gt;H. Aram Veeser ed., ''The Stanley Fish Reader'' (1999) p. 94-5&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fear of the corrosive effects of antifoundationalism was widespread in the late twentieth century, anticipating such things as a cultural meltdown and moral anarchy,&lt;ref&gt;Ermath, p. 58-62&lt;/ref&gt; or (at the least) a loss of the necessary critical distance to allow for leverage against the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks eds., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; For Fish, however, the threat of a loss of objective standards of rational enquiry with the disappearance of any founding principle was a false fear: far from opening the way to an unbridled subjectivity, antifoundationalism leaves the individual firmly entrenched within the conventional context and standards of enquiry/dispute of the discipline/profession/habitus within which s/he is irrevocably placed.&lt;ref&gt;Veeser ed., p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

By the same token, however, the antifoundationalist ''hope'' of escaping local situations through awareness of the contingency of all such situations—through recognition of the conventional/rhetorical nature of all claims to master principles—that hope is to Fish equally foredoomed by the very nature of the situational consciousness, the all-embracing social and intellectual context, in which every individual is separately enclosed.&lt;ref&gt;Veeser ed., p. 196-7 and p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish has also noted how, in contradistinction to hopes of an emancipatory outcome from antifoundationalism, anti-essentialist theories arguing for the absence of a transcontextual point of reference have been put to conservative and neo-conservative, as well as progressive, ends.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Fish, ''Professional Correctness'' (1995) p. 130 and p. x&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for example, [[John Searle]] has offered an account of the construction of [[social reality]] fully compatible with the acceptance stance of "the man who is at home in his society, the man who is ''chez lui'' in the social institutions of the society...as comfortable as the fish in the sea".&lt;ref&gt;John R.

==Criticism==
Antifoundationalists have been criticised for attacking all general claims ''except'' their own; for offering a localizing rhetoric contradicted in practice by their own globalizing style.&lt;ref&gt;Nicos P. Mouzelis, ''Sociological Theory: What went Wrong?'' (1995) p. 43-4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Said]] condemned radical anti-foundationalism for excessive cultural relativism and overdependence on the [[linguistic turn]] at the expense of human realities.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Judt, ''Reappraisals'' (2008) p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Budaya''' is the plural form of the word ''Budi''. ''Budi'' is synonymous to ''akal budi'' or ''kebudayaan''. This original Indonesian word is very philosophical, since it has been explained, interpreted, re-interpreted, and made a philosophical discourse in Indonesian philosophers' circle up to this time. [[Indonesian philosophy]] world is not considered as complete without mentioning this discourse. Its derivatives, such as [[Budayawan]], [[Budiman]], and [[Budi daya]], are now also discussed among Indonesian philosophers, especially those who are called [[philosophers of Kebudayaan]].

[[Philosophers]] of the various schools of philosophy define the word ''Budi'' (plural, ''Budaya'') with different definitions, suited to their school interests. The oldest definition of the word is found in the 18th century Ancient [[Javanese language|Javanese]] manuscript ''Serat Centhini''. According to the text, ''Budi'' is suprahuman, spiritual entity which mediates between God's being and human's being. It is a purely spiritual substance originated from [[God]]. Here is the excerpt:

{{Quote|''Wujud tanpa kahanan puniki.Ing dalem kak sajati lantaran. Inggih budi lantarané. Sarupa wujud ing hu. Pan jumeneng Muhammad latip. Mustakik ing Hyang Suksma. Kenyatanipun. Budi wujud ing Hyang Suksma. Inggih budi inggih Hyang kang Mahasuci. Budi tatabonira''&lt;ref&gt;as quoted from ''Serat Centhini'' by P.J. Zoetmulder in his, ''Pantheïsme en Monisme in de Javaansche Soeloek-Litteratuur'', translated to Indonesian by Dick Hartoko, Jakarta, Penerbit Gramedia, 1998, 3rd edition, pp. 249-253&lt;/ref&gt;}}

English translation:

{{Quote|This being without existence is between the true reality. It has a mediation which is called Budi. Budi is similar to God's being. Budi is also called the spiritual [[Muhammad]]. It is a manifestation of the Spirit. Budi is the being of the Spirit and it is the All-Pure. Budi is its peaceful place.}}

It is the Budi with this meaning that is used by Dr. [[Wahidin Soedirohusodo]] to name his and his fellows' first native political society [[Budi Utomo]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]] of the early 19th century.

The ''Budi'' in this meaning is also similar to the [[Sufi]] [[concept]] of [[Nur Muhammad]] or the [[Platonism|Platonic]] concept of [[The Universal Soul]] or the [[Islamic]] philosophical concept of [[Al-'Aql Al-Awwal]].

==Modern definition (19th century onwards)==
Modern European learning introduced by the [[Brazllian|Portuguese]]-[[Spain|Spanish]] [[Catholics]] and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Protestants]] to Indonesian native educational institutions in the 20th century influenced the definition of the word ''Budi''. In this intellectual period, ''Budi'' is re-defined and re-interpreted not as spiritual as understood before, but as human entity. In 1961, for example, [[Nicolas Drijarkara]] defined ''Budi'' as ''[[ethical]] [[reason]]'' or ''moral reason'' as understood by the moralist [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref&gt;N. Drijarkara, ''Percikan Filsafat'', Jakarta, PT. Pembangunan, 1978, 3rd edition, p. 47''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poedjawijatna]], another philosopher, defined ''Budi'' as Indonesian translation of the English word ''reason'' or ''[[reasoning]]'' and ''Filsafat Budi'' as of the English word ''[[Logics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Poedjawijatna, ''Pembimbing ke Arah Alam Filsafat'', Jakarta, PT. Pembangunan, 1980, 5th edition, p. 14''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ki Hajar Dewantara]], a preeminent Javanese thinker, in the early 1970s defined ''Budi '' as the matured human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].&lt;ref&gt;as quoted by [[Kamadjaja|Karkono Kamajaya Partokusumo]] in his ''Kebudayaan Jawa dan Proses Demokratisasi'', in Agus R. Sarjono (ed.), ''Pembebasan Budaya-Budaya Kita'', Jakarta, Gramedia, p. 210''&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana]], a great Indonesian thinker of the century, defined ''Budi'' as psychological pattern contained in it basic life needs, [[instinct]]s, feelings, [[thought]], [[Passion (emotion)|passions]] and [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]]. Here is the excerpt: 

{{Quote|''Adalah pola kejiwaan yang di dalamnya terkandung dorongan-dorongan hidup yang dasar, inseting (instink), perasaan, dengan pikiran, kemauan dan fantasi yang kita namakan budi. Budi itu adalah dasar segala kehidupan kebudayaan manusia.''.&lt;ref&gt;as quoted by Karkono Kamajaya Partokusumo in his ''Kebudayaan Jawa dan Proses Demokratisasi'', in Agus R. Sarjono (ed.), ''Pembebasan Budaya-Budaya Kita'', Jakarta, Gramedia, pp. 210-211''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==''Budi'' as culture==
The philosopher in Indonesian history of philosophy who firstly understood ''Budi'' (or more frequently, ''Kebudayaan'') as culture is Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana (1908–1994).[[Koentjaraningrat]], an American-trained anthropologist, then continued using the meaning in his famous book, ''Manusia dan Kebudayaan di Indonesia''.&lt;ref&gt;Koentjaraningrat, ''Manusia dan Kebudayaan di Indonesia'', Jakarta, Penerbit Djambatan, 1995, 15th edition, p. 19''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sidi Gazalba]], another philosopher of ''Kebudayaan'', defined ''Budi'' or ''Kebudayaan'' as a way of life owned and held by any cultural unity.&lt;ref&gt;Sidi Gazalba, ''Sistematika Filsafat Buku I'', Jakarta, Bulan Bintang, 1985, 4th edition, pp. 59-60''&lt;/ref&gt; Today's Indonesian thinkers, like [[Sutan Syahrir]], [[Soedjatmoko]], [[Dick Hartoko]], [[Abdurrahman Wahid]], [[Mochtar Kusumaatmaja]], [[Mochtar Lubis]], [[Sayidiman Suryohadiprojo]], [[Y.B. Mangunwijaya]], [[Nurcholish Madjid]], [[Darmanto Jatman]], and other modernists, hold this cultural-anthropological meaning of ''Budi''. It can even be said that this meaning has been dominating the [[philosophical]] discourse of today. All philosophers holding this meaning has been acknowledged nationally as ''Philosophers of Kebudayaan''.

The '''''Bulssi Japbyeon''''' (roughly translated as 'Buddha's Nonsense') is a late 14th century Korean [[Neo-Confucian]] polemical [[critique of Buddhism]] by [[Jeong Dojeon]]. In this work he carried out his most comprehensive refutation of Buddhism, singling out [[Buddhist]] doctrines and practices for detailed criticism. 

Jeong stated that this book was written with the objective of refuting Buddhism once and for all "lest it destroy [[morality]] and eventually humanity itself." The charges leveled against Buddhism in the ''Bulssi japbyeon'' constitute a full inventory of the various arguments made by [[Confucian]]s and [[Neo-Confucian]]s from the time of the introduction of Buddhism into East Asia during the 2nd century CE. These arguments are arranged in eighteen sections, each of which criticises a particular aspect of Buddhist doctrine or practice.

'''Charles Tenshin Fletcher''' is a British-born American [[rōshi]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Manchester, England]], he moved to the United States in 1979 to study at the Zen Center of Los Angeles with founder [[Taizan Maezumi]] ''[[Rōshi]]'', for whom he served as ''[[jisha]]'' (personal attendant). In 1994, he received [[Dharma transmission]] (authorization to teach) in the White Plum lineage from [[Taizan Maezumi]] ''Rōshi''. He acted as administrator for many years at Zen Center of Los Angeles, and then was made abbot of [[Yokoji Zen Mountain Center]] in 1995 after the death of [[Taizan Maezumi]] ''Rōshi'' on May 15, 1995.

Charles Tenshin Fletcher ''Rōshi'' continues as the abbot at [[Yokoji Zen Mountain Center]], in the [[San Jacinto Mountains]], near [[Idyllwild]], California.  He is certified as a ''Kokusai Fukyōshi'' ("Official Foreign Representative") by Sōtō-shū Shûmusôchô, that is, the Japanese [[Sōtō]] Zen sect.&lt;ref&gt;http://zmc.org/tenshin&lt;/ref&gt;

Tenshin ''Rōshi'' has trained thoroughly in ''[[kōan]]'' and ''[[shikantaza]]'' as well as other more recently developed forms of practice. In addition to his work in the US, he returns to the UK annually to lead a ''[[sesshin]]'' near Liverpool.

[[File:Christos Yannaras.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Yannaras in 2002]]
'''Christos Yannaras''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Χρήστος Γιανναράς; born 10 April 1935) is a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[philosopher]], [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[theologian]] and author of more than 50 books which have been translated into many languages. He is a professor emeritus of [[philosophy]] at the [[Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences]], Athens. 

==Biography==
Yannaras was born in [[Athens]]. He studied [[theology]] at the University of Athens and philosophy at the [[University of Bonn]] (Germany) and the [[University of Paris]] (France). He received a Ph.D. from the Faculty of Theology at the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] (Greece). He holds also a Ph.D of the Faculté des Lettres et Sciences Humaines at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne-University of Paris IV]]. He has been nominated Doctor of Philosophy, ''[[honoris causa]]'', at the [[University of Belgrade]], St. Vladimir's Seminary, New York, and the Holy Cross School, Boston. He has been a visiting professor at the universities of Paris (the Catholic Faculty), Geneva, Lausanne and Crete. He was Professor of Philosophy at the Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences in Athens, from 1982 to 2002. He is an elected member of the Hellenic Authors' Society.

The main volume of Yannaras' work represents a long course on study and research of the differences between the Greek and Western European philosophy and tradition, differences that are not limited at the level of theory only but also define a [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] (mode of life).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7357">'''Clarence James Glacken''' (1909 &amp;ndash; August 20, 1989) was Professor of Geography at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. 
He was known for a 1967 [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]],  ''Traces on the Rhodian Shore'', that demonstrated how perceptions of the natural environment shaped the course of human events over millennia. He is recognised as a key contributor to the field of [[environmental history]].

==Background==
Glacken was born and raised in [[Sacramento]], California, attending Sacramento Junior College (now Sacramento City College).&lt;ref name="sacramentopress.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacramentopress.com/headline/62880/Traces_of_a_Native_Son_Searching_for_Clarence_Glacken |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222023940/http://sacramentopress.com/headline/62880/Traces_of_a_Native_Son_Searching_for_Clarence_Glacken |archivedate=2013-02-22 |df= }} Biographical article by Corianna Fish, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied history and interdisciplinary studies at Berkeley (BA with highest honors 1930, MA in 1931, Department of Social Institutions). In the 1930s and 1940s, as America faced the Great Depression, he held several government jobs including a job with the Farm Security Administration assisting refugees fleeing the Mid West Dust Bowl and unemployment, in the Central Valley of California. In 1937, he travelled alone for a year through Europe and Asia, sparking his interest in the relationship between human ideas and the natural world.

In 1941, he was drafted into the U.S. Army, becoming an analyst and expert in Japanese language and culture. Discharged at the end of the war he took a job in Korea at the military government's Bureau of Health and Welfare, and found time for some geographical study of land cover change.

These experiences experience led to a desire to pursue scholarship. He finished a PhD in Geography at [[Johns Hopkins University]] when in his forties, called “The Idea of the Habitable World.” (1949-1951). Later he undertook an ethnography of three villages in Okinawa, using his language skills, working for the Pacific Science Board of the National Research Council from 1951-2. The study was later published as a book (Glacken, 1955).

In 1952, he was appointed by [[Carl Sauer]] as Assistant Professor of Geography at the University of California, Berkeley, later becoming Professor. He pursued varied research interests and attended the landmark conference, ''Man's Role in Changing the Face of the Earth'' in 1955, led by colleague [[Carl Sauer]].  Glacken was Chair of the Berkeley Geography Department in the late 1960s, at a time of upheaval. He suffered a severe nervous breakdown in 1970, followed by a heart attack.&lt;ref name="cdlib1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb5f59n9gs&amp;brand=calisphere&amp;chunk.id=meta |title=University of California: In Memoriam, 1990 |publisher=Texts.cdlib.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his last decade, as interest in his environmental ideas grew, he remained severely depressed and mentally ill, and although he completed a sequel to ''Traces on the Rhodian Shore'' in 1982 dealing with human-environment relationships in the 20th century, the manuscript was returned by University of California Press. He destroyed his copies, and only fragments survive. There is a plan to publish them.&lt;ref&gt;''Genealogies of Environmentalism: The Lost Works of Clarence Glacken''. (edited by S. Ravi Rajan, Adam Romero and Michael Watts. Accepted for publication by the University of Virginia Press 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Sacramento at the age of 80, pre-deceased by his first wife (d.1941). His second wife was Mildred Mosher (b. 1913 in Pomona, CA died around 1982) with whom he had 2 children - the novelist [[Karen Kijewski]], and a son Michael.

==Scholarship==
''Traces on the Rhodian Shore'' (1967) examined nature and culture in western thought from ancient times to the end of the 19th century. The book was hailed as monumental in its scope, "bringing together ideas on this vast and universal topic as they never had been before, transcending geography as a discipline but also being recognized as one of the truly great books written by a geographer in this century".&lt;ref name="cdlib1"/&gt;

In this and in other volumes, Glacken showed how past generations contemplated and interpreted the mutual relations between nature and human cultures. "After more than a decade of research, Glacken concluded that there had been three major ideas in the history of Western environmental thought: the idea of a divinely designed earth (both ecological theory and the intelligent design argument are direct descendents), the idea of environmental influence on people (similar to the environmental determinism popular in early anthropology), and the idea of human influence on the environment."&lt;ref name="sacramentopress.com"/&gt;

To the [[Confucianism|Confucians]], [[marriage]] is of important significance both in the [[family]] and in society. In the perspective of family, marriage can bring families of different surnames (different clans) together, and continue the family life of the concerned clans. Therefore, only the benefits and demerits of the clans, instead of the individual couples, are concerned in a marriage. Socially, a married couple is the basic unit of the population; sometimes marriages can affect the country’s political stability and international relations (especially to certain foreign tribes like [[Mongolia]]ns, [[Manchu]]s, [[Huns]], and [[Turkic peoples|Turks]]); thus marriage can be related to [[politics]].

From the point of view of Confucian philosophy, one of the purposes of marriage is the cultivation of virtue.  The Chinese have seen that marriage ({{zh|s=婚姻|p=hūn yīn}}) should be founded on love since the concept of [[monogamy]] is rooted in their mindset. Ideographically, ‘’hūn’’ (婚) is identical to ‘’hūn’’ (昏, literally means an evening; a dusk) in ancient writings, though the former has the radical (Chinese character) ‘’nǔ’’ (女, literally means a female). Similarly, ‘’yīn’’ (姻) is the same as ‘’yīn’’ (因). According to Zhang Yi’s (張揖) ({{zh|t=廣雅•釋詁|p=Guangya Shigu}}), a dictionary for ancient Chinese characters, ‘’yīn’’ (因) means friendliness, love and harmony, indicating that correct way of living for a married couple.

==Further influences on marriage==
Due to the concept of [[filial piety]] and following rites of [[propriety]], marriage was a costly affair and seen as second only to [[funeral]] ceremonies. The use of a [[matchmaking|matchmaker]] was meant to ensure that the husband and wife were compatible with each other, but primarily worked in the families' best interests.

'''Constantin G. Stere''' or '''Constantin Sterea''' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]]; {{lang-ru|Константин Егорович Стере}}, ''Konstantin Yegorovich Stere'' or Константин Георгиевич Стере, ''Konstantin Georgiyevich Stere''; also known under his [[pen name]] ''Șărcăleanu''; June 1, 1865&amp;nbsp;– June 26, 1936) was a Romanian writer, [[jurist]], politician, ideologue of the ''[[Poporanism|Poporanist]]'' trend, and, in March 1906, co-founder (together with [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]] and [[Paul Bujor]]&amp;nbsp;— the latter was afterwards replaced by the physician [[Ioan Cantacuzino]]) of the [[literary magazine]] ''[[Viața Românească]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stere, "Cum am devenit...", p.13&lt;/ref&gt; One of the central figures of the Bessarabian [[intelligentsia]] at the time, Stere was a key actor during the [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania]] in 1918, and is associated with its legacy.

Constantin Stere was professor of [[Administrative law|Administrative]] and [[Constitutional law]] at the [[University of Iaşi]], serving as its [[Rector (academia)|rector]] between 1913 and 1916. He is also remembered for his partly [[autobiographical novel]] ''În preajma revoluției'' (literal translation: "On the Eve of the Revolution"&amp;nbsp;— in reference to the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution of 1917]]).

==Biography==

===Early life===
He was born in [[Horodiște, Dondușeni|Horodiște]], [[Soroca County (Romania)|Soroca County]],&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.28&lt;/ref&gt; to a family of [[boyar]] origins&lt;ref&gt;Nădejde, in Gorovei; Ornea, Vol.I, p.212&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Ciripcău]], [[Bessarabia]]&amp;nbsp;— which was part of the [[Russian Empire]] at the time. Stere was one of the three sons of an [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] couple of Russian citizens: Gheorghe or Iorgu Stere (known as ''Yegor Stepanovich Stere'', Егор Степанович Стере in Russian), a landowner whose family was originally from [[Botoșani County]] in the Romanian part of [[Moldavia]],&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.23-25&lt;/ref&gt; and Pulcheria (Пулкерия), a member of the impoverished gentry in Bessarabia.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.26-28&lt;/ref&gt; He spent most of his early years, until the age of eight, in Ciripcău, where the family [[manor house|manor]] was located.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.27-29, 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1874, he graduated from a [[Chișinău]] private school where classes were taught German, and entered the school for ''[[Russian nobility|dvoryane]]'' in the city, where he became close friends with Alexandru Grosu and Lev Matveyevich Kogan-Bernstein (who were the basis for the characters ''Sașa Lungu'' and ''Moise Roitman'' in Stere's novel).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.36-37&lt;/ref&gt; It was also around this time that he became acquainted with [[Progressivism|progressive]], [[Utopian socialism|utopian socialist]], and [[Darwinism|Darwinist]] ideas (notably reading the works of [[Nikolai Chernyshevsky]], [[Alexander Herzen]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Ferdinand Lassalle]], and [[Peter Lavrovich Lavrov]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.37-41&lt;/ref&gt; Stere later indicated that, before the late 1870s, he could not spell the [[Romanian alphabet]], which had just been adopted over the border (''see [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet]]''), and had to rely on a few books [[Smuggling|smuggled]] into Bessarabia for getting a sense of [[Literary language|literary]] [[Romanian language|Romanian]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.44-45&lt;/ref&gt;

While still students, Stere and Kogan-Bernstein engaged in revolutionary politics as [[Socialism|socialists]] and [[Narodnik]]s, initiating a [[Conspiracy (political)|conspirative]] "self-instruction" cell of six inside their school.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.46-48&lt;/ref&gt; The group was affiliated with [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]],&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p.82; Ornea, p.48-49&lt;/ref&gt; and Stere was responsible for multiplying and distributing locally the [[manifesto]] issued by the latter after it had assassinated [[List of Russian rulers|Emperor]] [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.50&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the first moment when Stere declared his opposition to a [[Social democracy|Social democratic]] program, a Narodnik-inspired objection which would later form one of the tenets of his doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.56-59&lt;/ref&gt;

He was first arrested in late 1883, after [[Okhrana]] units decapitated the Bessarabian wing of the Narodnaya Volya.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.60-61&lt;/ref&gt; Detained in [[Odessa]] (during which time he read intensely),&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.61-67&lt;/ref&gt; Stere was frequently visited by Maria Grosu, the sister of Alexandru, who had fallen in love with him&amp;nbsp;— a Narodnik and a [[Feminism|feminist]], she asked Stere for a [[marriage of convenience]] that was meant to help her become free from parental tutelage (according to the laws of the Russian Empire, unmarried women were under their father's protection).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.74-75&lt;/ref&gt; Stere agreed, and they were married in the prison [[chapel]] (1885).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.75-76&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siberia===
In 1885, he was [[Penal transportation|deported]] to [[Siberia]], serving a three-year term.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; Briefly kept in [[Tyumen]] prison awaiting transport further east, he was sent to [[Kurgan, Kurgan Oblast|Kurgan]] in the custody of two [[Special Corps of Gendarmes|gendarmes]] (October).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.80-86&lt;/ref&gt; He was joined there by Maria, who gave birth to their son Roman in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.87-88&lt;/ref&gt; Moving to [[Turinsk]], the Steres joined a group of revolutionaries in internal exile; Constantin Stere agreed to print copies of a Narodnik magazine, using a [[hectograph]], and was exposed during a raid by authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.90-93&lt;/ref&gt; He was swiftly taken to [[Tobolsk]], then shipped down the [[Irtysh River|Irtysh]] to the place where it met the [[Ob River|Ob]]; he traveled to the village of [[Sharkala]] (the northernmost part of Siberia he ever reached) in a [[Khanty people|Khanty]] canoe,&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.93-94&lt;/ref&gt; and was then settled in [[Beryozovsky District, Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug|Beryozovsky District]], only to be arrested again and sent back to Tobolsk in the autumn of 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.93-96&lt;/ref&gt;

He was tried for his activities in Turinsk, based on evidence collected by the Okhrana.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.96-97&lt;/ref&gt; While in prison, Stere, who was beginning to distance himself from socialism and [[proletarian internationalism]], argued in front of authorities that mention of his change in attitude was supposed to be kept by the court when passing the verdict. At the time, a physician who examined him noted that he had suffered a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]], and had him moved to a prison hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.98&lt;/ref&gt; According to most accounts, he had attempted suicide (a gesture caused by either the death of one of his brothers, who had himself committed suicide,&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.103&lt;/ref&gt; or by news that the Narodnik leader [[Lev Tikhomirov]] had become a supporter of the political establishment).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.104-106&lt;/ref&gt; In hospital, Stere stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Quite a while ago have I begun to remove myself from the influence of political exiles and their tradition. Recent times, filled with major hardships for me, I have decided firmly and sincerely to break with these traditions, as well as with all things «illegal» in my past."&lt;ref&gt;Stere, in Ornea, Vol.I, p.98-99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Instead, he became familiar with [[Neo-Kantianism|Neo-Kantian philosophy]], expanding on his interest in [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (which he was reading in Beryozovsky District).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.106-108&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this time that Stere began writing.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.108&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1889, the court decided to extend his term of exile by three more years, and relocated him to the village of Serginsk, near [[Minusinsk]]. He much later claimed that, while passing through the prison of [[Krasnoyarsk]], he met [[Vladimir Lenin]], the future [[Bolshevik]] leader&amp;nbsp;— this is unlikely, as Lenin passed through the city several years after Stere.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.111-112&lt;/ref&gt; His other claim to have met and befriended [[Józef Piłsudski]], future head of state of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] (and, at the time, a prominent member of the [[Polish Socialist Party]]), was confirmed by Piłsudski himself in 1927 (Stere's novel, ''În preajma revoluției'', included Piłsudski as a character, under the name ''Stadnicki'').&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.113&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Datoria'' and ''Evenimentul''===
In late 1891 or early 1892, having been set free, Stere returned to Bessarabia, and eventually sought political refuge inside Romania, crossing the border clandestinely.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.126-143&lt;/ref&gt; He studied Law at the [[University of Iași]] (under [[Petre Missir]], while carrying on as a [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] activist and quickly becoming an influential figure among the youth of [[Iași]], the inspiration behind a left-leaning student society that engaged in a virulent polemic with the nationalist youth,&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.156-160&lt;/ref&gt; and an acquaintance of socialist leaders such as [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]], [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]], [[Ioan Nădejde]], [[Sofia Nădejde]], [[Constantin Mille]], [[Theodor Speranția]], [[Vasile Morțun]], and [[Nicolae L. Lupu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.147-149, 150-153, 156, 194, 238-241&lt;/ref&gt; Later, a controversy erupted over Stere's academic credentials, as it was never consistently proven that he had passed his [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] between being arrested and applying for law school.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.52-55&lt;/ref&gt;

Stere's break with [[Marxism]] led him to attempt persuading the newly created [[Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party]] (PSDMR) to amend its [[proletariat]]-focused policies,&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p.83; Ornea, Vol.I, p.172, 180-185, 198&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1893, to found the student society ''Datoria'' ("The Duty"), which preserved the Narodnik focus on educating peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p.83; Ornea, Vol.I, p.161-165&lt;/ref&gt; He and his followers nevertheless continued to rely much of their thesis on Marxist concepts,&lt;ref&gt;Boatcă, p.18; Ionescu&lt;/ref&gt; coupled with an interest taken in the [[Reformism|reformist socialist]] way advocated by [[Eduard Bernstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Boatcă, p.15; Ornea, Vol.I, p.122-123&lt;/ref&gt;

After debuting as a journalist for the liberal-inspired ''[[Evenimentul]]'' in 1893 (and engaging in public debates with the socialist press),&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.165-175&lt;/ref&gt; Stere also sent substantial contribution to ''[[Adevărul]]'', a tribune of various left-wing trends that was being published in [[Bucharest]] under the direction of [[Anton Bacalbașa]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.173&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1893, he took part in founding ''Evenimentul Literar'', the literary supplement of ''Evenimentul''.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.183-188&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined in the socialists Bacalbașa and Ibrăileanu in a cultural polemic with the poet [[Alexandru Vlahuță]] and his magazine ''[[Vieața]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.190-197, 199&lt;/ref&gt; Vlahuță, who had sided with Dobrogeanu-Gherea during the latter's conflict with [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]],&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.193&lt;/ref&gt; nonetheless clashed with the [[Left-wing politics|leftists]] over the issue of "[[art for art's sake]]", arguing that the interest his adversaries took in [[didacticism]] was harming literature.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.193-197&lt;/ref&gt; This exchange of replies soon involved the former socialist [[Eduard Dioghenide]], who attacked ''Evenimentul Literar'' with [[Antisemitism|Antisemitic]] language, contending that Stere was "an employee of the little kikes" and had "lost his soul to the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jews]]".&lt;ref&gt;Dioghenide, in Ornea, Vol.I, p.199, 200&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Stere's activity with ''Datoria'' also came under attack from various student societies&amp;nbsp;— most of them associates of the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.198&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1890s, he had begun making use of the ''Șărcăleanu'' alias in his polemic articles,&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.187-188&lt;/ref&gt; which became a particular topic of dispute after his confrontation with Dioghenide (who first speculated that Stere was the author of ''Șărcăleanu'''s articles).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.199-202&lt;/ref&gt; Dioghenide's supporters, editors of the newspaper ''Naționalul'', consequently pressured Stere to indicate who ''Șărcăleanu'' was ("We wish to know him, does he wear [[Payot|sidelocks]] or is he a [[Judaism|Judaisized]] Romanian?").&lt;ref&gt;''Naționalul'', in Ornea, Vol.I, p.202&lt;/ref&gt; Similar calls were voiced by ''Vieața'', who alleged that Stere himself was a [[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union|Russian Jew]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.210&lt;/ref&gt;

Winning the support of several Conservative politicians, Stere successfully applied for Romanian citizenship in February 1895, obtaining [[naturalization]] through a special law, as "a Romanian from Bessarabia".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.211-214&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, Stere obtained a [[licensure]] with a thesis on [[Juristic person|legal entity]] and [[individualism]], one which drew criticism from the influential Conservative-inspired group ''[[Junimea]]'', on the assumption that it had been partly inspired by Marx.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.218; 225-236&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he also published an incomplete series of philosophical essays centered on the works of [[Wilhelm Wundt]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.220-223&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation, Stere, who was by then the father of four, lived for a while in [[Ploiești]], and afterwards joined the [[Bar association]] in Iași as a practicing lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.237-238&lt;/ref&gt; During the period, he met and befriended the influential writer [[Ion Luca Caragiale]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.241&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth of ''Poporanism''===
{{main|Poporanism}}
By 1898, Stere, who had continued to acquire influence with Iași-based socialists, became involved in disputes over the future of the [[Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party]] (PSDMR) and [[Vasile Morțun]]'s call for a merger with the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL)&amp;nbsp;— Morțun's camp, which also included [[Alexandru G. Radovici]], became known in time as "the generous ones" (''generoșii''). According to [[Constantin Titel Petrescu]], Stere, despite his own polemics with Dobrogeanu-Gherea, sided with the latter and against Morțun ("Even Stere [...] declared himself against moving to the Liberals").&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, in Ornea, Vol.I, p.244&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, during merger talks between the "generous ones" and the left-wing of the National Liberals, Stere was approached by the latter's [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]]; Brătianu and [[Gheorghe Gh. Mârzescu]], who were gathering supporters at a time when the PNL cabinet of [[Dimitrie Sturdza]] looked set to lose the [[Romanian general election, 1899|general elections of 1899]] to a strong coalition of Conservatives and former Liberals such as [[Petre S. Aurelian]], proposed to Stere that he become a city councilor in Iași, and he accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.245-248&lt;/ref&gt; During the period, he split with ''Evenimentul'', as the paper became close to Liberal splinter groups and virulently criticized the contacts between the PNL and former PSDMR affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.248-250&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, Stere entered the PNL as a left-wing [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] and [[Populism|populist]], supporting an original tactic that blended a Narodnik focus on the peasantry with a weariness towards [[capitalism]] and [[industrialisation]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.109-110; Boatcă, p.15; Hitchins, p.83, 85; Ionescu; Ornea, Vol.I, p.172, 175-180, 190-191, 297-298; Stahl&lt;/ref&gt; This was the origin of ''[[Poporanism]]'', a theory expanded upon in his influential 1908 essay ''Poporanism sau social-democrație?'', "Poporanism or [[Social democracy]]?" (Stere coined the original term in 1894, viewing it the best translation of the word ''Narodnik'').&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p.83; Ornea, Vol.I, p.175, 433-438&lt;/ref&gt;

In essence, ''Poporanism'' ceased to view socialism as a goal in countries such as Romania. Stere noted that the group to be defined as industrial [[proletariat]] accounted for ca. 1% of the total number of taxpayers (around 1907),&lt;ref&gt;Boatcă, p.15; Ornea, Vol.I, p.436-437, 446-447&lt;/ref&gt; and argued instead for a "peasant state", which was to encourage and preserve small [[Agriculture|agricultural]] plots as the basis for economic development. Citing the example of Denmark (''see [[Danish cooperative movement]]''), he also proposed that [[cooperative]] industries were to be created in the rural sphere, and that initiative agriculture could also rely in [[Agricultural cooperative|cooperative farms]]:&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p.84-85; Ornea, Vol.I, p.437-438; Stahl&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The essential role of peasant cooperatives resides in that they, while keeping the small-scale peasant holdings intact, award them the possibility to make use of all the advantages of large-scale production."&lt;ref&gt;Stere, in Stahl&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite its name, Stere understood the "peasant state" not as an actual [[hegemony]] of the peasantry, but as an immediate move from the census [[suffrage]] in the [[Kingdom of Romania]] to a [[universal suffrage|universal one]], intended to accurately reflect the country's social realities (''see [[1866 Constitution of Romania]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Boatcă, p.15; Ionescu&lt;/ref&gt; In an 1898 speech, he also stressed a loyalty for the [[King of Romania]] ([[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]] at the time).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol I, p.251&lt;/ref&gt;

Stere notably rejected [[Karl Kautsky]]'s support for capitalization in agriculture, arguing that it was neither necessary nor practical.&lt;ref&gt;Ionescu; Love; Stahl&lt;/ref&gt; He was not, however, opposed to [[modernization]], and invested trust in the role of [[intellectual]]s as militants and activists,&lt;ref&gt;Ionescu&lt;/ref&gt; as well as building on [[Werner Sombart]]'s theory that agrarian economies were facing new and special conditions (as opposed to those that bore the mark of the [[Industrial Revolution]]).&lt;ref&gt;Boatcă, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; Stere observed changes occurring in the developed world at the turn of the 19th century, and concluded that industrialization of backward countries was also being blocked by [[colonialism]] and the prosperity it had brought to the [[British Empire]] and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Boatcă, p.18-19&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a new form of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] was being created at a larger, non-national, scale; he deemed it "vagabond capital", and viewed in it the source for the lack of accuracy in Marxist [[Marx's theory of alienation|predictions over proletarian alienation]] (as it appeared that, in developed countries, the proletariat was growing wealthier).&lt;ref&gt;Boatcă, p.19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

This was also the start of a polemic between him and the Marxist [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]]. Although the two shared skepticism over the possibility of early socialist success in Romania (agreeing with [[Titu Maiorescu]]'s verdict that it was one of the "forms without substance", and thus an ill-suited effect of [[Westernization]]),&lt;ref name="Boatcă, p.15"&gt;Boatcă, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; Dobrogeanu-Gherea argued that Stere's program of basing Romania's economy on cooperatives and small-scale agricultural holdings could only lead to endemic [[underdevelopment]].&lt;ref&gt;Dobrogeanu-Gherea; Hitchins, p.87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early National Liberal politics===
As a city coucilor in 1899, Stere soon found himself in an unusual position after [[Minister of Interior and Administrative Reform (Romania)|Minister of the Interior]] [[Mihail Pherekyde]] ordered a clampdown on the surviving PSDMR.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.257&lt;/ref&gt; This came after the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative]] opposition voiced allegations that socialist clubs in the countryside were inciting laborers to revolt (an accusation which threatened to decrease the popularity of the [[Dimitrie Sturdza]] cabinet).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.257-265&lt;/ref&gt; As all former PSDMR members in the PNL came under scrutiny, he was himself the target of attacks in [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]], and notably criticized by the [[Junimea|Constitutional Party]]'s Titu Maiorescu for allegedly using his position to "disturb the elementary order; [...] leading to the only place it could lead: peasant rebellion".&lt;ref&gt;Maiorescu, in Ornea, Vol.I, p.266&lt;/ref&gt;

He lost his position in March 1899, following Sturdza's fall from power over a scandal involving relations between Romanian and [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.267&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, he welcomed the remaining "generous ones" inside the PNL as the PSDMR was dissolved (April 1899); those socialists who remained independent continued to consider Stere the main instigator of the move.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.268-270&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he relied on what he interpreted as [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]]'s promise that a PNL cabinet was going to enforce both [[universal suffrage]] and [[land reform]], and hoped to exercise an influence on the party's Left.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.245, 282-283, 301, 308&lt;/ref&gt; With Pherekyde, [[Petre Poni]], [[Toma Stelian]] and [[Spiru Haret]], Stere was soon involved in public protests against the successive Conservative cabinets of [[Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino]] and [[Petre P. Carp]]&amp;nbsp;— provoked by the [[Hallier Affair]]&amp;nbsp;— involving a French firm which used its government connections to regain a [[public works]] contract in the port of [[Constanța]], although it had failed to respect its obligations&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.283-284&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;—, and the "Law on [[Distilled beverage|spirits]]" (or "law on ''[[Țuică|țuica]]''")&amp;nbsp;— which established [[homebrewing]] tax, engendering violence in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.285-286&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a conflict between Cantacuzino and Carp, which caused the latter's cabinet to be invalidated with assistance from Conservative parliamentarians (February 1901) Sturdza returned to power triumphantly.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.289-290&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Romanian general election, 1901|1901 suffrage]], he was first elected to [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber]] for the 3rd Electoral College in Iaşi.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.290-296&lt;/ref&gt; Stere largely owed his 1901 appointment as Deputy Professor at the [[University of Iași]] to his political connections: falling short of legal requirements, he asked Brătianu and Spiru Haret to make an exception in his case&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.312-317&lt;/ref&gt; (in order to avoid breaking the law which prevented state employees from being elected deputies, he asked not to receive a salary for his first course).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.317-319&lt;/ref&gt; After he became a full Professor, his assistant at the department was [[Nicolae Daşcovici]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

Stere sided with Brătianu and [[Vasile Lascăr]] in 1904, at a time when the two confronted Sturdza and resigned from their government offices, provoking the cabinet's fall (and Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino's reinstatement as Premier).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.306-312&lt;/ref&gt;

===1905 Russian Revolution===
In his later years, Stere argued that he had foreseen Japan's victory in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and the string of social problems Russia experienced, and that he had sent the General Staff of the [[Romanian Armed Forces|Romanian Army]] a memorandum on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.339-340&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the [[Russian Revolution (1905)|Russian Revolution of 1905]], Stere and a group of his followers returned to Bessarabia in order to encourage local Romanian sentiment during elections for the [[State Duma of the Russian Empire|State Duma]] and ''[[zemstvo]]s''&amp;nbsp;— according to Stere, the group had the tacit approval of the Conservative government.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.342&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, Stere represented the [[Chișinău]] ''zemstvo'' as a lawyer in a civil lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.338, 342&lt;/ref&gt; They arrived at a time of conflict, when [[Black Hundreds]] activity was gaining momentum and peasant pressures in the countryside were meeting with resistance from [[reactionary]] politicians such as [[Vladimir Purishkevich]] and [[Pavel Krushevan]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.345-346&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Stere doubled as a correspondent for PNL [[French language]] newspapers, signing them as ''C. Șercăleano''.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.345&lt;/ref&gt;

He issued a magazine (''[[Basarabia (newspaper)|Basarabia]]'') of which he was editor (together with [[Ion Inculeț]], [[Teodor Inculeț]], [[Ion Pelivan]], [[Alexei Mateevici]], and [[Pan Halippa]]), attempting to profit from the political gains in Russia by calling for both in-depth social reforms and [[decentralization]]; their influence waned after [[reactionary]] politicians made electoral gains and, as the new administration, confiscated most of the magazine's issues (leading to its [[bankruptcy]] in 1907).&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p.251-252; Ornea, Vol.I, p.348-355&lt;/ref&gt; Stere himself first returned to Romania in early 1906, and immediately left on a trip to [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]]-ruled [[Transylvania]], where he met with the poet and activist [[Octavian Goga]] in [[Sibiu]], as well as with other prominent ethnic Romanians, becoming in time an unofficial envoy of the PNL in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.384-385&lt;/ref&gt; His involvement in the ''zemstvo'' trial became the topic of a scandal, after the institution accused Stere of having failed to fulfill his obligations as a lawyer, and called on him to return the fees he had received.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.432-433, 451-452&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Viața Românească''===
{{main|Viața Românească}}
[[File:I. Botez, C. Stere, G. Ibraileanu.jpg|thumb|300px|Ion Botez, Constantin Stere and [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]]]]
In its first editorial (1906), ''[[Viața Românească]]'' (a magazine which Stere had planned during his return to Bessarabia)&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.347, 355-357&lt;/ref&gt; summarized the cultural guidelines of the ''Poporanist'' trend, ones which Stere had first theorized in 1899 articles for ''Evenimentul Literar'':&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.190-193&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A 'national' culture with specific characteristics will only be born when the large, truly [[Romanians|Romanian]], popular masses will partake in ''creating'' and ''assessing'' cultural values&amp;nbsp;— [[literary language]], [[Literature of Romania|literature]], ways of living&amp;nbsp;— and this will only be possible when, through ''culture'', ''enlarged political participation'' and ''economical uplifting'', the peasantry will be awarded a ''social'' value in proportion with its numerical, economical, moral and national values, when we shall be ''one'' people, when all the [[social class]]es shall be of ''the same'' people [...]."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Viața Românească]]'', in Niculae ''et al.'', p.64 (italics as used in the original)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stere distanced himself from the competing and equally peasant-focused trend of ''[[Sămănătorul]]'', which aimed to preserve the peasant way of life in front of modernization rather than enforce the peasant economy advocated by ''Poporanism''.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p.84-85; Ornea, Vol.I, p.387-388&lt;/ref&gt; He was notably involved in polemics with ''Sămănătorul'''s [[Octavian Goga]] and [[Nicolae Iorga]].

As he later admitted, he attempted to divert attention from the ''Șărcăleanu'' alias by making use of another one, ''P. Nicanor &amp; Co.'' (used before and after him by various '' Viața Românească'' contributors to the magazine's closing column), and by writing an article in which he claimed Stere and Șărcăleanu were not one and the same, thus maintaining the relative ambiguity until the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Stere, "Cum am devenit...", p.14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

===1907 Revolt and aftermath===
Alongside other followers of Brătianu (including [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]]), Stere began campaigning in favor of dismissing the Conservative cabinet of [[Prime Minister of Romania|Premier]] [[Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino]], at a time when the latter also faced [[Take Ionescu]]'s dissidence.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.400&lt;/ref&gt; This coincided with the outbreak of the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|1907 Peasants' Revolt]], which managed to bring down the cabinet after Ionescu agreed to support the [[Dimitrie Sturdza]]'s return to power, as a means to ensure a response to the troubles.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.401-404&lt;/ref&gt; Like many other "generous ones", Stere was integrated in the new administration, and became a [[Prefect (Romania)|prefect]] of [[Iași County]]; instead of calling in the [[Romanian Armed Forces|Romanian Army]] to pacify the area, he interfered in landowner-peasant relations to ensure better conditions for the latter, thus causing alarm in the Conservative camp.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.404-412, 414-417&lt;/ref&gt; Although no violent reprisal against the rebels was recorded in his prefecture,&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.412&lt;/ref&gt; his association with the repressive cabinet was the topic of criticism from many of his former allies, most notably [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]], [[Paul Bujor]], and [[Constantin Mille]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.413-414&lt;/ref&gt; Together with his deputy prefect [[Gheorghe Gh. Mârzescu]], Stere resigned his position in April and was replaced with [[Gheorghe Kernbach]], preparing to run in the [[Romanian general election, 1907|legislative election of that year]]&amp;nbsp;— for the 2nd Electoral College in Iași; he won the seat in late May.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.418-423, 465&lt;/ref&gt;

In early June, Premier Sturdza appointed Stere, alongside Take Ionescu, [[Petre P. Carp]], [[Ion G. Duca]], [[Alexandru Djuvara]], [[Constantin Alimănișteanu]], [[Ion Radovici|Ion]] and [[Alexandru G. Radovici]], [[Dinu Brătianu|Dinu]] and [[Vintilă Brătianu]], and 24 other parliamentarians, to a Committee charged with settling the agricultural issue; ultimately dissolved later in the same month, the Committee did not achieve any clear result, and Stere's radical proposals were repeatedly ignored by his own party.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.429, 441-443&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, a conflict erupted between Stere and the independent [[Antisemitism|Antisemitic]] politician [[A. C. Cuza]], who had been one of his opponents in the election; after making use of the word "trivial" in reference to Stere's attitudes, Cuza was sued by the latter, and refused a challenge to face him in a [[duel]] (an additional aspect of the scandal was the accusation that Stere had purposely failed students who supported Cuza's policies).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.430-431&lt;/ref&gt; Following the creation of Take Ionescu's [[Conservative-Democratic Party]] (PCD), the PNL launched accusations that the new group was financed by the leaseholder [[Mochi Fischer]] (whose property in [[Flămânzi]] had seen the outbreak of the 1907 revolt); in reaction, the PCD newspaper ''Opinia'', representing the views of [[Alexandru Bădărău]], accused Stere of having failed to protect the interests of his clients in the [[Bessarabia]]n ''[[zemstvo]]''&amp;nbsp;— Stere challenged the article's author [[Gheorghe Lascăr]], former mayor of Iași, to a duel on [[Copou Hill]], during which Lascăr was defeated and injured (March 11, 1908).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.451-453&lt;/ref&gt;

Calling for an [[amnesty]] in respect to peasant rebels, Stere was initially silent on the new legislation (which, without questioning traditional landed property, allowed room for [[Communes of Romania|communal]] ownership), and was mostly absent from Chamber sessions.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.442-446, 450-451&lt;/ref&gt; He nevertheless authored several studies in which he condemned the state of affairs in Romanian agriculture, concluding one of them with a [[Latin]] verdict, paraphrasing [[Pliny the Elder]], ''Latifundia perdidere Romaniam'' ("The great estates have ruined Romania").&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.446-447&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed full support for the newly established agricultural bank, [[Casa Rurală]], at a time when the project for its creation was voted in Parliament (February 1908).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.448-450&lt;/ref&gt;

===First clashes with the PNL===
After again siding with Brătianu during the inner-party conflict with Sturdza&amp;nbsp;— culminating in Brătianu's arrival to power after the premier fell victim to a nervous disease&amp;nbsp;—, Stere replaced [[Petre Poni]] at the head of the Liberal club in Iași (June 1908), and soon came to be opposed by Mârzescu over his promotion of former socialists to party offices.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.460-471, 492&lt;/ref&gt; Following the PCD's rise to the detriment of the PNL, Stere was able to enlist his party's support for his vision of [[electoral reform]] (with a single electoral college, and idea also promoted by Take Ionescu), and reported on it in Parliament, being criticized by the Conservative opposition on the basis of suspicions that he was still promoting socialist ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.471-475&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-1909, he was the target of a campaign in ''[[Evenimentul]]'', which had by then turned Conservative, being again accused of having profited from the ''zemstvo'' in Bessarabia without providing the required services.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.494-510&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, Stere and Ibrăileanu began mentioning the ''Poporanist'' or "democratic peasantist" trend as a small but representative faction of the PNL.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.489-490&lt;/ref&gt; Such attitudes caused further tensions inside his party: [[Henri Sanielevici]], himself a former socialist National Liberal, commented that "[Stere] seeks to strengthen himself ''through'' and inside the Liberal Party and break with it only when he will become strong enough";&lt;ref&gt;Sanilevici, in Ornea, Vol.I, p.513 (Sanielevici's italics)&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when Brătianu was thought to be considering Stere for a cabinet position, the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] section of the PNL expressed its opposition and took steps to marginalize him (a catalysis for this attitude was the clash between the PNL and ''[[România Muncitoare]]'' affiliates, caused by the expulsion of the socialist activist [[Christian Rakovsky]], together with promises made by Brătianu that his party would not push for [[land reform]] and [[universal suffrage]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.511-520&lt;/ref&gt; Largely absent from the political scene during 1909-1910, Constantin Stere nevertheless aided the PNL, fallen from power in December 1910, to reach an agreement with the [[Conservative-Democratic Party|Conservative-Democrats]] over opposition to the [[Petre P. Carp]] cabinet, by improving his relations with [[Alexandru Bădărău]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.529-533, 554-557&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1910 ''Neo-[[Serfdom]] (A Social and Economic Study of Our Land Issue)'', Dobrogeanu-Gherea viewed the relation between left-leaning cultural circles in Romania and Stere's Narodnik focus as conjectural, and made mention of competing trends inside ''Poporanism'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[There is] the ''Poporanism'' established in this country around 15 years after [the Narodnik original] and from the very same source. Lacking the rigorous method of Marxism, [...] ''Poporanism'' appears to have being against Social Democracy as its sole attribute [...].&lt;br&gt;[There is also] our national, Romanian, ''Poporanism'', as it has originated from the different and real circumstances of our country. [It] is more practical than theoretical, and does not in fact have its own theory. Mr. Stere's effort to award it one was not at all successful. But this ''Poporanism'' has its own views and attitudes and&amp;nbsp;— what's more important&amp;nbsp;— its own [[Praxis (process)|praxis]]. And to this real praxis, influencing the real course of things in this country, all kinds of ''Poporanists'' have associated themselves in one way or another, including those who are under the influence of Russian [Narodnik ideas]. But even this national ''Poporanism'' is far, very far from being uniform. This can even be seen in those multiple groupings composing it, [...] which many times quarrel with one another."&lt;ref&gt;Dobrogeanu-Gherea&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The apparent heterogeneous character of ''Poporanism'' was also criticized by others, who noted that its discourse also featured [[Nationalism|nationalist]] rhetoric.&lt;ref name="Boatcă, p.15"/&gt; Nevertheless, PSDMR members other than Dobrogeanu-Gherea tended to refer to ''Viața Românească'' as "engaged in Sterist politics".&lt;ref name="Nădejde, in Gorovei"&gt;Nădejde, in Gorovei&lt;/ref&gt; Constantin Stere had a moderate reaction to the publishing of ''Neo-Serfdom'', briefly criticizing the arguments it brought against ''Poporanist'' politics (with Dobrogeanu-Gherea's renewed message that socialism was possible in backward countries); additional replies to the thesis came from Stere's disciple, the engineer [[Nicolae Profiri]] (among others who engaged in the debate was Dobrogeanu-Gherea's son, the future [[Leninism|Leninist]] [[Alexandru Dobrogeanu-Gherea]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.533-543&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1912, while visiting [[Florence]], Italy, Stere began a long extra-marital relationship with Ana Radovici, the widow of [[Ion Radovici]] (the latter had committed suicide in 1909).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.548-551&lt;/ref&gt; No longer elected to the Chamber in the [[Romanian general election, 1912|1912 suffrage]], he returned to his chair at the Iași University.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.551-553&lt;/ref&gt; During the electoral campaign, reelected leader of the Liberal club, he was again attacked by ''Evenimentul'', and, having taken part in denouncing [[A. C. Cuza]] for [[plagiarism]], clashed with his supporters (who briefly occupied the PNL headquarters in Iași in May).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Vol.I, p.553-558&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
In 1916, Stere strongly supported Romania's alliance with the [[Central Powers]], arguing in favor of a policy focused on Bessarabia's recovery and against what he saw as Russian [[expansionism]]&lt;ref name="Zbuchea"&gt;Zbuchea&lt;/ref&gt; - ultimately, this led him to split with the pro-[[Triple Entente|Entente]] PNL upon the outbreak of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Zbuchea"/&gt; The socialist [[Ioan Nădejde]] commented on the fact that Stere had become rivals with members of the [[Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party]] who had joined the PNL in 1899, and especially with their leader [[Vasile Morțun]].&lt;ref name="Nădejde, in Gorovei"/&gt; He joined his voice to a diverse [[intellectual]] opposition which also included the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]]'s [[Petre P. Carp]] and [[Alexandru Marghiloman]], the left-leaning writers [[Tudor Arghezi]], [[Dimitrie D. Pătrășcanu]], and [[Gala Galaction]], as well as the revolutionary socialist [[Christian Rakovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.256; Zbuchea&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Romania during World War I|occupation of Bucharest]] by the [[Central Powers]], Stere remained in the city, in contrast with the mass the Bucharesters who followed the Romanian authorities' refuge to Iași. With financial support from [[Alexandru Vaida-Voevod]], he began publishing his ''Lumina'', a newspaper that was nevertheless, according to its editor, "supportive of the Romanian point of view"&lt;ref name="Stere, in Coman, p.19"&gt;Stere, in Coman, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; and thus subject to [[censorship]] ("a German [censorship], for [views on] external politics [...] and for internal politics [the one] exercised by Petre P. Carp's men, who cut out my articles on [[Nationalization|expropriation]] [that is, [[land reform]]] and [[universal suffrage]]").&lt;ref name="Stere, in Coman, p.19"/&gt;

In late March 1918, he represented the [[Alexandru Marghiloman]] government in [[Chișinău]], during the time after the [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution]]s when Bessarabia had proclaimed itself a ''[[Moldavian Democratic Republic]]''&amp;nbsp;— he was charged with assisting Ion Inculeț in proposing a union of Bessarabia and Romania in ''[[Sfatul Țării]]'', the republic's legislative assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p.278; Zbuchea&lt;/ref&gt; After prolonged debates, the vote was carried in favor of union on March 27 (''see [[Greater Romania]]'').

With the change in fortunes brought by the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice with Germany]], Stere was charged with [[treason]] and imprisoned; never facing trial, he was eventually set free.&lt;ref&gt;Slabey Roucek, p.85&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation of the Peasants' Party===
In the late 1910s, he became discreetly involved in the movement that led to the creation of the ''Bessarabian Peasants' Party'' (founded and led by [[Pan Halippa]] and [[Ion Inculeț]]). In late 1918, most of it merged into [[Ion Mihalache]]'s [[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]] (PȚ), of which he and Halippa became high-ranking members&lt;ref&gt;Slabey Roucek, p.85-86&lt;/ref&gt; (Inculeț disagreed with the political union, and led a smaller party that eventually merged into the PNL).&lt;ref&gt;Niculae ''et al.'', p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

Stere caused a scandal after running and winning elections for the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania]] in [[Soroca]] (1921, under the [[Alexandru Averescu]] government), when all parties joined [[Nicolae Iorga]] in opposition to his appointment in office (Iorga considered Stere's anti-Entente past to be equivalent with [[treason]]).&lt;ref&gt;Scurtu&lt;/ref&gt; Fears of [[Bolshevik]] appeal in Bessarabia led to widespread allegations that the former socialist Stere was "Bolshevizing" the region.&lt;ref&gt;Slabey Roucek, p.86&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking from the non-[[Communism|communist]] Left, [[Ioan Nădejde]] expressed concerns that Stere was radicalizing his message:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] Stere aims to scrape together a socialist party, allied with the Peasants' Party, against all other social classes, and thus follows a policy out of which, in the end, we could only get Bolshevism."&lt;ref name="Nădejde, in Gorovei"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1919, Stere had shown his awareness of that he and his party were being criticised by various political groups claiming Marxist orthodoxy, [[far left]] included. Stating again his belief in the fragile and minority position of industrial proletarians in the landscape of Romanian economy of the period, he indicated that the latter class was destined to adapt its demands to the interests of the peasantry:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] for a country such as Romania, it is obvious that the urban [[working class]]' fate is literally in the hands of the rural working class. [...]&lt;br&gt;In these conditions, would it not be an act of suicide from the industrial working class of Romania if it were to adopt a hostile attitude toward the peasantry?&lt;br&gt;And: it is obvious that, no matter what the political and social doctrine preached by the urban proletariat, it would become hostile toward the peasantry if it wanted to impose upon it a form of economic structuring rejected by the peasantry, such as, for one, the immediate and violent [[Nationalization|socialization]] of peasant agriculture.&lt;br&gt;A socialist worker expresses, in the pages of [a socialist journal], the fear that the Peasants' Party of Romania will follow the example of the peasant parties in [[History of Bulgaria (1878–1946)|Bulgaria]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] [that is, the [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]] and the [[Peasant Party (Serbia)|Serbian Peasant Party]]], who, once in power, are said to have oppressed the workers.&lt;br&gt;But can this serve as an argument against the solidarity in interests of the workers in villages and cities?&lt;br&gt;In these murky times, we have also assisted to the spectacle of bloody repression, by a socialist government [formed by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]], of the [[German Revolution|workers' movements in Germany]].&lt;br&gt;Does this mean that there is a real conflict of interests between those elements of the German proletariat that are being led by the orthodox Social Democracy, and the elements that follow the banner of the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Party]]?"&lt;ref&gt;Stere, in Niculae ''et al.'', p.93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Scandal and dissidence===
Stere's position in his party's leadership prevented it from entering a close union with the [[Transylvania]]-based [[Romanian National Party]] (PNR) in 1924, as the PNR's leaders resented his anti-Entente past.&lt;ref&gt;Niculae ''et al.'', p.13; Scurtu&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, however, he was admitted as one of the leaders of the newly created [[National Peasants' Party]], a fusion of the two groups that was partly aided by the attack of National Liberal agents on [[Pan Halippa]] and the government's refusal to punish the guilty.&lt;ref&gt;Slabey Rocek, p.91&lt;/ref&gt; Stere was the author of a legislation which aimed at providing for a degree of administrative decentralization and local initiative in government, passed in 1929 by the [[Iuliu Maniu]] executive.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p.409&lt;/ref&gt;

He soon clashed with the more [[Conservatism|conservative]] politicians who had been members of the PNR. In March 1930, the mention of his name during a public celebration provoked a number of [[Romanian Armed Forces|Romanian Army]] generals to leave in protest; immediately after, the National Liberal group around [[Vintilă Brătianu]] began attacking Stere's party for harbouring him, and for causing a split between Army and political establishment.&lt;ref&gt;Coman, p.20-21&lt;/ref&gt; General [[Henry Cihoschi]], the [[List of Romanian Ministers of National Defense|Minister of Defense]], was publicly criticized in [[Parliament of Romania|parliament]] for not siding with his subordinates, and had to resign on April 4; Maniu appeared to support Stere's ousting.&lt;ref&gt;Coman, p.20, 22&lt;/ref&gt;

In reply, Stere again expressed his view that Romania's government had been wrong in 1916,&lt;ref&gt;Coman, p.19; Zbuchea&lt;/ref&gt; and left to create the minor [[Democratic Peasants' Party–Stere]] (not to be confused with the one created later by [[Nicolae L. Lupu]]), which he led into a union with [[Grigore Iunian]]'s ''Radical Peasants' Party''.

==Legacy==
[[File:Stamp of Moldova 304.gif|thumb|1995 stamp]]

Despite his dissidence, Stere's ideas remained highly influential inside the National Peasants' Party, and constituted a major influence on the doctrines of [[Virgil Madgearu]].&lt;ref&gt;Coman, p.23; Ornea, Vol.I, p.438; Hitchins, p.320-321, 388&lt;/ref&gt; ''Poporanism'', alongside Marxism itself, was a contributing factor in [[Dimitrie Gusti]]'s original theories on [[sociology]].&lt;ref&gt;Vulcănescu&lt;/ref&gt;

Stere's original ideas on economic development and Marxist topics were subject to [[Censorship in Communist Romania|censorship]] in [[Communist Romania]]; although works on him were published after the establishment of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]'s rule, they generally avoided presenting and quoting his writings.&lt;ref name="Boatcă, p.23"&gt;Boatcă, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; Described as a "[[reactionary]]" until the 1960s,&lt;ref name="Boatcă, p.23"/&gt; he was considered by revised official [[historiography]] to have taken a "[[Radicalism (historical)|radical]]-[[bourgeoisie]] position".&lt;ref&gt;Coman, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the [[Romanian Academy]] granted posthumous membership to Constantin Stere.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.acad.ro/membri_ar/pag_membri_pm.htm ''Membrii post-mortem al Academiei Române''], at the [[Romanian Academy]] site; retrieved April 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

''În preajma revoluției'' first appeared in eight volumes between 1932 and 1936, when it met with popular and critical success, although this was largely due to the fact that its author was cloaked in legend. The Communist regime banned the work for its duration, considering it unpublishable, even after Ceaușescu steered a course away from Soviet tutelage. The book was published between 1990 and 1991 at Chișinău, while Stere's biographer [[Zigu Ornea]] put out another edition in 1991-1993. Both editions of the somewhat problematic 2331-page text were flawed, and in 2010, the Iași-based literary historian Victor Durnea began publishing a critical, annotated edition of Stere's works, starting with the novel. The manuscripts no longer exist, Stere's archive in his country house at [[Bucov]] having mysteriously disappeared after [[World War II]], so that Durnea's interventions were limited to introducing uniformity into the available text, eliminating arbitrary decisions both by Stere and his editors, and replacing obsolete terms and punctuation that resulted from the author's culturally Russian outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Voncu&lt;/ref&gt;

'''De-identification''' is the process used to prevent a [[personal identity|person's identity]] from being connected with information. For example, data produced during [[human subject research]] might be de-identified to preserve [[privacy for research participants|research participants' privacy]]. 

When applied to [[metadata]] or general data about identification, the process is also known as [[data anonymization]]. Common strategies include deleting or masking [[personal identifier]]s, such as [[personal name|name]] and [[social security number]], and suppressing or generalizing [[quasi-identifier]]s, such as [[date of birth]] and [[zip code]]. The reverse process of using de-identified data to identify individuals is known as ''re-identification''. Successful re-identifications&lt;ref name="sweeney2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sweeney | first1 = L. | title = Simple Demographics Often Identify People Uniquely | journal = Data Privacy Working Paper | volume = 3 | year = 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="demontjoye2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = de Montjoye | first1 = Y.-A. | title = Unique in the crowd: The privacy bounds of human mobility | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 3 | year = 2013 | doi=10.1038/srep01376| bibcode = 2013NatSR...3E1376D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="demontjoye2015"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = de Montjoye | first1 = Y.-A. | title = Unique in the shopping mall: On the reidentifiability of credit card metadata | journal = Science | volume = 347 | year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="narayanan2006"&gt;{{Cite arXiv| last1 = Narayanan | first1 = A. | title = How to break anonymity of the netflix prize dataset | |arxiv=cs/0610105 | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; cast doubt on de-identification's effectiveness. A systematic review of fourteen distinct [[Data Re-Identification|re-identification]] attacks found "a high re-identification rate […] dominated by small-scale studies on data that was not de-identified according to existing standards."&lt;ref name="Malin, El Emam, et al"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = El Emam| first1 = Khaled | title = A Systematic Review of Re-Identification Attacks on Health Data | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 10 | issue = 4  | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0028071 | bibcode = 2011PLoSO...628071E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

De-identification is adopted as one of the main approaches of data [[privacy protection]]. It is commonly used in fields of communications, multimedia, biometrics, big data, cloud computing, data mining, internet, social networks and audio–video surveillance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ribaric|first=Slobodan|last2=Ariyaeeinia|first2=Aladdin|last3=Pavesic|first3=Nikola|date=2016-09-01|title=De-identification for privacy protection in multimedia content: A survey|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923596516300856|journal=Signal Processing: Image Communication|volume=47|pages=131–151|doi=10.1016/j.image.2016.05.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, the [[United States President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology]] found de-identification "somewhat useful as an added safeguard" but not "a useful basis for policy" as "it is not robust against near‐term future re‐identification methods".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=PCAST|title=Report to the President - Big Data and Privacy: A technological perspective|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/PCAST/pcast_big_data_and_privacy_-_may_2014.pdf|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

=== In designing survey ===

A survey is conducted, such as a [[census]], to collect information about a group of people. To encourage participation and to protect the privacy of survey respondents, the researchers attempt to design the survey in such a way that people can participate in the survey and when the result is published it will not be possible to match any participant's individual response with any data published in the result.

=== Before using information ===

A online shopping website wants to know its users' preferences and shopping habits. It decides to retrieve customers' data from its database and do analysis on them. The personal data information including [[Personal identifier|personal identifiers]] were collected directly when customers created their accounts. The website needs to pre-handle the data by de-identification techniques before analyzing data records to avoid violating customers' privacy.&amp;nbsp;

==Anonymization==
[[Anonymity|Anonymization]] refers to irreversibly severing a data set from the identity of the data contributor in a study to prevent any future re-identification, even by the study organizers under any condition.&lt;ref name="storage"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Godard | first1 = B. A. | last2 = Schmidtke | first2 = J. R. | last3 = Cassiman | first3 = J. J. | last4 = Aymé | first4 = S. G.

== Techniques ==
Common strategies of de-identification are masking [[Personal identifier|personal identifiers]] and generalizing [[Quasi-identifier|quasi-identifiers]]. [[Pseudonymization]] is the main technique used to mask [[Personal identifier|personal identifiers]] from data records and k-anonymization is usually adopted for generalizing [[Quasi-identifier|quasi-identifiers]].

=== Pseudonymization ===
Pseudonymization is performed by replacing real names with a temporary ID, it deletes or masks personal identifiers to make individuals unidentified. This method makes it possible to track the individual's record over time even though the record will be updated. However, it can not prevent the individual from being identified if some specific combinations of attributes in data record indirectly identify the individual. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[Ito K, Kogure J, Shimoyama T, Tsuda H.] Ito K, Kogure J, Shimoyama T, Tsuda H. (2016). "De-identification and Encryption Technologies to Protect Personal Information". FUJITSU SCIENTIFIC &amp; TECHNICAL JOURNAL. 28-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== k-anonymization ===
[[K-anonymity|k-anonymization]] defines attributes that indirectly points to the individual's identity as [[Quasi-identifier|quasi-identifiers]](QIs) and deal with data by making at least k individuals have same combination of QI values.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; QI values are handled following specific standards. For example, the k-anonymization replaces some original data in the records with new range values and keep some values unchanged. New combination of QI values prevents the individual from being identified and also avoid destroying data records. &amp;nbsp;

==Applications==
Research into de-identification is driven mostly for protecting [[health information]].&lt;ref name="library"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nicholson | first1 = S. | last2 = Smith | first2 = C. A. | doi = 10.1002/meet.1450420106 | title = Using lessons from health care to protect the privacy of library users: Guidelines for the de-identification of library data based on HIPAA | journal = Proceedings of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | volume = 42 | pages = n/a | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some libraries have adopted methods used in the [[healthcare industry]] to preserve their readers' privacy.&lt;ref name="library"/&gt;

In big data, de-identification is widely adopted by individuals and organizations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the development of social media, e-commerce, and big data, de-identification is required and used for data privacy when users' personal data are collected by companies or third-party organizations who will analyze it for their own personal usage. Social network sites collect and save their users' data for analysis of user behavior. They adopt this approach to protect their users' privacy. Those online shopping websites adopt this method as well.

==Limits==
Whenever a person participates in [[genetics]] research the donation of a biological specimen often results in the creation of a large amount of personalized data. Such data is uniquely difficult to de-identify.&lt;ref name="nolonger"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McGuire | first1 = A. L. | last2 = Gibbs | first2 = R. A. | title = GENETICS: No Longer De-Identified | doi = 10.1126/science.1125339 | journal = Science | volume = 312 | issue = 5772 | pages = 370–371 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16627725 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anonymization of genetic data is particularly difficult because of the huge amount of genotypic
information in biospecimens,&lt;ref name="nolonger"/&gt; the ties that specimens often have to medical history,&lt;ref name="Genotype-phenotype"&gt;{{Cite journal 
| last1 = Thorisson | first1 = G. A.

| last3 = Brookes | first3 = A. J.

| title = Genotype–phenotype databases: Challenges and solutions for the post-genomic era 
| journal = Nature Reviews Genetics 
| volume = 10 
| issue = 1 
| pages = 9–18 
| year = 2009 
| pmid = 19065136 
| pmc = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the advent of modern bioinformatics tools for [[data mining]].&lt;ref name="Genotype-phenotype"/&gt; There have been demonstrations that data for individuals in aggregate collections of genotypic data sets can be tied to the identities of the specimen donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Homer | first1 = N. | last2 = Szelinger | first2 = S. | last3 = Redman | first3 = M. | last4 = Duggan | first4 = D. | last5 = Tembe | first5 = W. | last6 = Muehling | first6 = J. | last7 = Pearson | first7 = J. V. | last8 = Stephan | first8 = D. A. | last9 = Nelson | first9 = S. F. | last10 = Craig | first10 = D. W. | editor1-last = Visscher | editor1-first = Peter M. | title = Resolving Individuals Contributing Trace Amounts of DNA to Highly Complex Mixtures Using High-Density SNP Genotyping Microarrays | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000167 | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 4 | issue = 8 | pages = e1000167 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18769715| pmc =2516199 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have suggested that it is not reasonable to ever promise participants in genetics research that they can retain their anonymity, but instead such participants should be taught the limits of using coded identifiers in a de-identification process.&lt;ref name="meeting"/&gt;

==De-identification laws in the United States of America ==

The [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] Privacy Rule provides mechanisms for using and disclosing health data responsibly without the need for patient consent. These mechanisms center on two HIPAA de-identification standards – Safe Harbor and the Expert Determination Method. [[Safe harbor (law)|Safe Harbor]] relies on the removal of specific patient identifiers (e.g. name, phone number, email address, etc.) while the Expert Determination Method requires knowledge and experience with generally accepted statistical and scientific principles and methods to render information not individually identifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.privacy-analytics.com/de-id-university/white-papers/de-identification-201/ |title=De-Identification 201 |first= |last= |work=Privacy Analytics |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safe harbor===

The [[safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] method uses a list approach to de-identification and has two requirements:

# The removal or generalization of 18 elements from the data.
# That the Covered Entity or Business Associate does not have actual knowledge that the residual information in the data could be used alone, or in combination with other information, to identify an individual. Safe Harbor is a highly prescriptive approach to de-identification. Under this method, all dates must be generalized to year and zip codes reduced to three digits. The same approach is used on the data regardless of the context. Even if the information is to be shared with a trusted researcher who wishes to analyze the data for seasonal variations in acute respiratory cases and, thus, requires the month of hospital admission, this information cannot be provided; only the year of admission would be retained.

===Expert Determination===
Expert Determination takes a risk-based approach to de-identification that applies current standards and best practices from the research to determine the [[Likelihood principle|likelihood]] that a person could be identified from their protected [[health information]]. This method requires that a person with appropriate [[knowledge]] of and experience with generally accepted statistical and scientific principles and methods render the information not individually identifiable. It requires:
# That the risk is very small that the information could be used alone, or in combination with other reasonably available information, by an anticipated recipient to identify an individual who is a subject of the information; 
# Documents the methods and results of the analysis that justify such a determination.

===Research on decedents===
The key law about research in [[electronic health record]] data is [[HIPAA]] Privacy Rule. This law allows use of electronic health record of deceased subjects for research (HIPAA Privacy Rule (section 164.512(i)(1)(iii))).&lt;ref&gt;{{CodeFedReg|45|164|512)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3610">[[Image:Stephen Batchelor.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Stephen Batchelor (agnostic)|Stephen Batchelor]] giving a Dharma talk at [[Upaya Zen Center]] in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]]]
A '''Dharma talk''' (Sanskrit) or '''Dhamma talk''' (Pali) or '''Dharma sermon''' (''Japanese'': '''法語''' (ほうご, Hōgo), ''Chinese'': 法語) is a public discourse on [[Buddhism]] by a Buddhist teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sawada | first = Janine Anderson | title = Confucian Values and Popular Zen: Sekimon Shingaku in Eighteenth-Century Japan | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | date =1993 | url = http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45733077&amp;referer=one_hit | page=20 | isbn = 0-8248-1414-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[Zen]] traditions a Dharma talk may be referred to as a [[Buddhist terms and concepts#T|t]]eisho (提唱).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Farrer-Halls | first = Gill | title =The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Buddhist Wisdom | publisher =Quest Books | date =2000 | url =http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42763937&amp;referer=one_hit | page=151| isbn = 0-8356-0786-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to [[Taizan Maezumi]] and [[Bernard Glassman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Maezumi | first = Taizan |author2=Bernard Glassman | title = The Hazy Moon of Enlightenment | publisher=Wisdom Publications | date = 2007 | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/73742251&amp;referer=one_hit | series=On Zen Practice | page=Glossary | isbn = 0-86171-314-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a teisho is "a formal commentary by a Zen master on a koan or Zen text. In its strictest sense, teisho is non-dualistic and is thus distinguished from a Dharma talk, which is a lecture on a Buddhist topic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Maezumi | first = Taizan |author2=Bernard Glassman | title = The Hazy Moon of Enlightenment | publisher=Wisdom Publications | date = 2007 | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/73742251&amp;referer=one_hit | series=On Zen Practice | page=163 | isbn = 0-86171-314-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, a teisho is thus a ''formal'' Dharma talk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = O'Halloran | first =Maura | title = Pure Heart, Enlightened Mind: The Life and Letters of an Irish Zen Saint | publisher = Wisdom Publications | date = 2007 | url =http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/83977483&amp;referer=one_hit | page=80 | isbn = 0-86171-283-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vietnam]]ese master [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] says the following about Dharma talks:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hanh | first = Nhat | title = Opening the Heart of the Cosmos: Insights on the Lotus Sutra | publisher = Parallax Press | date = 2003 | url = http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52980455&amp;referer=one_hit | page=43 | isbn = 1-888375-33-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A Dharma talk must always be appropriate in two ways: it must accord perfectly with the spirit of the Dharma and it must also respond perfectly to the situation in which it is given. If it only corresponds perfectly with the teachings but does not meet the needs of the listeners, it's not a good Dharma talk; it's not appropriate.}}

'''Ecomasculinity''' is a complimentary field of thought to [[ecofeminism]]. Whereas ecofeminism has traditionally focused on studying issues such as how the exploitation of women and women's bodies is congruent with the exploitation of nature, ecomasculinity studies men's role in this process and also looks for ways to enable men to take on roles that would challenge exploitative thought patterns and practices. As an academic field, early work on ecomasculinity has been carried on by the likes of Richard Twine, Paul Pulé, and Greta Gaard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9765">[[File:Paul Feyerabend Berkeley.jpg|thumb|right|[[Paul Karl Feyerabend]] (1924–1994), originator of epistemological anarchism.]]
'''Epistemological anarchism''' is an [[epistemology|epistemological]] theory advanced by [[Austria]]n [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Paul Feyerabend]] which holds that there are no useful and exception-free [[methodology|methodological rules]] governing the [[scientific progress|progress of science]] or the growth of [[knowledge]]. It holds that the idea of the operation of science by fixed, universal rules is unrealistic, pernicious, and detrimental to science itself.&lt;ref name="contra"&gt;{{cite book | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul |authorlink = Paul Feyerabend | title = Against Method | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-0-86091-646-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the term [[wikt:anarchism|anarchism]] in the name reflected the [[methodological pluralism]] prescription of the theory, as the purported [[scientific method]] does not have a monopoly on truth or useful results. Feyerabend once famously said that because there is no fixed scientific method, it is best to have an "anything goes" attitude toward methodologies.&lt;ref name="contra"/&gt; Feyerabend felt that science started as a liberating movement, but over time it had become increasingly dogmatic and rigid, and therefore had become increasingly an [[ideology]] and despite its successes science had started to attain some oppressive features and it was not possible to come up with an unambiguous way to distinguish science from [[religion]], [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], or [[mythology]]. He felt the exclusive dominance of science as a means of directing society was [[authoritarian]] and ungrounded.&lt;ref name="contra"/&gt; Promulgation of the theory earned Feyerabend the title of "the worst enemy of science" from his detractors.&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt;

==Rationale==
The theory draws on the observation that there is no identifiable fixed [[scientific method]] that is consistent with the practices of the paradigm of scientific progress – the [[scientific revolution]].&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt; It is a radical critique of [[rationalism|rationalist]] and [[empiricism|empiricist]] [[historiography]] which tend to represent the heroes of the scientific revolution as scrupulous researchers reliant on [[empirical research]], whereas Feyerabend countered that [[Galileo]], for example, relied on [[rhetoric]], [[propaganda]] and epistemological tricks to support his doctrine of [[heliocentrism]] and that [[aesthetic]] criteria, personal whims and [[social constructionism|social factors]] were far more prevalent than the dominant historiographies allowed.&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=feyerabend |title=Paul Feyerabend |last=Preston |first=John|2007-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scientific law]]s such as those posited by [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotelian]] or [[Newtonian physics]] that assumed the stance of objective models of the universe have been found to come short in describing the entirety of the universe. The movement of universal models from Aristotelian to Newtonian physics to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[relativity theory]], where each preceding theory has been refuted as entirely universal model of reality, illustrates for the epistemological anarchist that scientific theories do not [[correspondence theory of truth|correspond to truth]], as they are in part cultural manifestations, and ergo not objective.&lt;ref name="contra"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-86091-646-8 | title = Against Method | page = 66 | publisher = Verso | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 1983 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feyerabend drew a comparison between one scientific paradigm triumphing over or superseding another, in the same manner a given [[myth]] is adapted and [[Appropriation (sociology)|appropriated]] by a new, triumphant successor myth in [[comparative mythology]]. Feyerabend contended, with [[Imre Lakatos]], that the [[demarcation problem]] of distinguishing on objective grounds science from [[pseudoscience]] was irresolvable and thus fatal to the notion of science run according to fixed, universal rules.&lt;ref name="contra"/&gt;

Feyerabend also notes that science's success is not solely due to its own methods, but also to its having taken in knowledge from unscientific sources. In turn the notion that there is no knowledge outside science is a 'convenient [[fairy-tale]]' held only by dogmatists who distort history for the convenience of scientific institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-86091-646-8 | title = Against Method | page = 306 | publisher = Verso | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 1983 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, Copernicus was heavily influenced by Pythagoras, whose view of the world had previously been rejected as mystical and irrational. [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] writings played an important role in the works of Copernicus as well as Newton.&lt;ref name="Feyerabend 1983 306–307"&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-86091-646-8 | title = Against Method | pages = 306–307 | publisher = Verso | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 1983 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There exists fairly accurate astronomical knowledge that reaches back even to the [[Stone Age]], measured in stone observatories in England and the South Pacific.&lt;ref name="Feyerabend 1983 306–307"/&gt; Pre-Modern inventions such as crop rotation, hybrid plants, chemical inventions and architectural achievements not yet understood like that of the pyramids are all examples which threaten the notion that science is the only means of attaining knowledge.&lt;ref name="Feyerabend 1983 306–307"/&gt;

Feyerabend also criticized science for not having evidence for its own philosophical precepts, particularly the notions of Uniformity of Law and of Uniformity of Process across time and space. "We have to realize that a unified theory of the physical world simply does not exist," said Feyerabend; "we have theories that work in restricted regions, we have purely formal attempts to condense them into a single formula, we have lots of unfounded claims (such as the claim that all of chemistry can be reduced to physics), phenomena that do not fit into the accepted framework are suppressed; in physics, which many scientists regard as the one really basic science, we have now at least three different points of view...without a promise of conceptual (and not only formal) unification".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 0-86091-184-5 | title = Farewell To Reason| page = 100 | publisher = Verso | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 1987 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Feyerabend held that deciding between competing scientific accounts was complicated by the [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurability]] of scientific theories. Incommensurability means that scientific theories cannot be reconciled or synthesized because the interpretation and practice of science is always informed by theoretical assumptions, which leads to proponents of competing theories using different terms, engaged in different [[language-game]]s and thus [[talking past each other]]. This for Feyerabend was another reason why the idea of science as proceeding according to universal, fixed laws was both historically inaccurate and prescriptively useless.

==Other proponents==

[[Terence McKenna]] was a fan of philosophers such as Feyerabend and [[Thomas Kuhn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 1-56455-206-3 | title = The Search of the Original Tree of Knowledge | publisher = Sounds True, Incorporated | last = McKenna | first = Terence | year = 1992 | authorlink = Terence McKenna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ian Hacking]] was a friend of Feyerabend's, and they corresponded with and cited each other. He wrote the introduction and praised the last edition of ''[[Against Method]]'', quoting French philosopher [[Jean Largeault]], who called it "more than a book: it is an event".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 1-56455-206-3 | title = Against Method (fourth edition) | page = introduction | publisher = Verso | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 2010 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Imre Lakatos]] was also a friend of Feyerabend's. The two wrote letters to each other on the philosophy of science which would have been published in a book called ''For and Against Method'', but the death of Lakatos ended their plans to produce this dialogue volume.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feyerabend/&lt;/ref&gt; While Lakatos never publicly labeled himself so, Feyerabend contended that he was a fellow epistemological anarchist. Lakatos was the one who suggested and encouraged that Feyerabend write a book based on his philosophy and the lectures he gave in his classes, which turned out to be his seminal work ''Against Method''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 0-226-24532-2 | title = Killing Time: The Autobiography of Paul Feyerabend | publisher =  University Of Chicago Press | page= 139 | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 1996 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''François Laruelle''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ɑː|r|ˈ|w|ɛ|l}}; {{IPA-fr|laʁɥɛl|lang}} {{audio|Fr-François Laruelle.oga|&lt;small&gt;(listen)&lt;/small&gt;}}; born 22 August 1937) is a [[French philosopher]], formerly of the [[Collège international de philosophie]] and the [[University of Paris X: Nanterre]]. Laruelle has been publishing since the early 1970s and now has around twenty book-length titles to his name. Alumnus of the [[École Normale Supérieure]], Laruelle is notable for developing a science of philosophy that he calls ''[[non-philosophy]]''. He currently directs an international organisation dedicated to furthering the cause of non-philosophy, the Organisation Non-Philosophique Internationale.

==Work==
Laruelle divides his work into five periods: Philosophy I (1971–1981), Philosophy II (1981–1995), Philosophy III (1995–2002), Philosophy IV (2002–2008), and Philosophy V (2008–present). The work comprising Philosophy I finds Laruelle attempting to subvert concepts found in [[Nietzsche]], [[Heidegger]], [[Deleuze]] and [[Derrida]]. Even at this early stage one can identify Laruelle's interest in adopting a transcendental stance ''towards'' philosophy. With Philosophy II, Laruelle makes a determined effort to develop a transcendental approach to philosophy itself. However, it is not until Philosophy III that Laruelle claims to have started the work of non-philosophy.

===Non-philosophy===
{{main article|Non-philosophy}}

Laruelle claims that all forms of philosophy (from [[ancient philosophy]] to [[analytic philosophy]] to [[deconstruction]] and so on) are structured around a prior decision, but that all forms of philosophy remain constitutively blind to this decision. The 'decision' that Laruelle is concerned with here is the dialectical splitting of the world in order to grasp the world philosophically. Laruelle claims that the decisional structure of philosophy can only be grasped non-philosophically. In this sense, non-philosophy is a science of philosophy.

==Reception and influence==
A decade ago, he was described by Scottish philosopher [[Ray Brassier]] as "the most important unknown philosopher working in Europe today"&lt;ref&gt;Brassier 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;24.&lt;/ref&gt; and was described by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] as "engaged in one of the most interesting undertakings of contemporary philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], ''What is Philosophy?'', Trans. Hugh Tomlinson and Graham Burchell (New York: Columbia University Press, 1994), p. 220n5.&lt;/ref&gt; The first English-language reception of his work (Brassier's account of Laruelle in ''Radical Philosophy'' in 2003) has been followed with a slew of introductions from John Ó Maoilearca (Mullarkey), Anthony Paul Smith, Rocco Gangle, [[Katerina Kolozova]], and Alexander Galloway, as well as Brassier's own subsequent book, ''Nihil Unbound''.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Brassier, ''Nihil Unbound''. Palgrave Macmillan, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Laruelle's international reception is growing with dozens of titles a year translated and published in English by such publishing houses as Polity Books, Edinburgh University Press, Continuum, Palgrave Macmillan, Columbia University Press, Urbanomic/Sequence and others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17194">'''Hashkafa''' ({{lang-he-n|השקפה}}; lit. "outlook") is the [[Hebrew]] term for [[worldview]] and guiding [[philosophy]], used almost exclusively within [[Orthodox Jewish]] communities. It is a perspective that Orthodox Jews adopt that defines many aspects of their lives. Although Orthodox communities prefer clinging to the [[mesorah (disambiguation)|mesorah]] (or [[Jewish]] tradition) more so than other Jewish denominations, they acknowledge that society has changed since the Revelation at [[Mount Sinai]]. Therefore, Hashkafa is necessary to contextualize religious observance.

Hashkafa works in conjunction with ''[[halakha]]''—the codified list of laws and commandments derived from the [[Torah]] and the oral tradition—to direct and enrich the day-to-day life of observant Orthodox Jews. When a hashkafa is inconsistent with ''halakha'', it is inherently illegitimate. While ''halakha'' is a rigid [[legal system]] that generally doesn’t afford much variation in practice, hashkafa provides a more flexible framework and is often the source of major disagreement between different Orthodox groups. For example, Orthodox halakhic authorities—or [[Rabbi]]s—prohibit listening to music with profane lyrics. However, there is disagreement about listening to "kosher" non-Jewish music, which is part of the broader hashkafic (i.e. relating to hashkafa) discussion about cultural integration. [[Modern Orthodox]] Jews will generally listen to such music, while [[Hasidic Jews]] will distance themselves from it.

Hashkafa plays a crucial role in how Orthodox Jews interact with the world around them and influences individual beliefs about [[secularity]], gender roles, and modernity. It also guides many practical decisions: where to send children to school, what synagogue to attend, and what community to live in.

== Origin and source ==
Although the word hashkafa is not explicitly mentioned in the Torah, the idea of broad guiding philosophies certainly stems from it. The Torah lays the foundations for such a construct in [[Deuteronomy]] 6:18 ({{Hebrew|דברים ו:יח}}), where it says: "And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the Lord."&lt;ref&gt;JPS Bible English Translation. Online&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Tanakh (or Hebrew Bible) mentions the phrase "walking in His Ways",&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 8:6, 19:9, 26:17, 28:9, 30:16; Kings 1 2:3; Isaiah 42:24; Psalms 119:3. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to God, eight times. These verses make no mention of any specific commandments like observing the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] or celebrating [[Passover]]; rather, they command the more fundamental principles—or hashkafas—of doing what is right and emulating God's ways.

[[Leviticus]] 19:2 ({{hebrew|ויקרא יט:ב}}) describes another non-specific, all-encompassing meta-principle, stating, "Ye shall be holy."&lt;ref&gt;JPS Bible English Translation.&lt;/ref&gt; Once again, this verse does not mention a specific commandment; instead, it insists on leading a life centered around holiness. The prominent Jewish philosopher [[Nachmanides]] (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|רמב׳׳ן}}) argues that the reason the Torah writes in such broad strokes in the aforementioned cases is because it would be impossible for the Torah to legislate every possible circumstance for all times and places. Therefore, the Torah provided principles that can be used to judge specific and new situations in accordance with Torah Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hebrew|רמב׳׳ן דברים ו:יח}}. Nachmanides Commentary on the Torah, Deuteronomy 6:18. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hashkafa is crucial because it contextualizes religiosity and makes Torah relevant intergenerationally. According to strict Torah law, [[drunkenness]] and [[gluttony]] are permissible, as long as the wine is [[Kashrut|kosher]] and the meat is [[Ritual slaughter|ritually slaughtered]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Hebrew|רמב׳׳ן ויקרא יט:ב}}. Nachmanides Commentary on the Torah, Leviticus 19:2. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, if one considers the foundational principle of acting in a manner that is holy, then gluttony and drunkenness are incongruous with the Torah.

With the rise of Jewish philosophy and great Jewish thinkers, various sects of Orthodox Judaism have developed throughout history, each with their distinct hashkafa. While certain meta-principles are present in all sects—primarily the ones precisely demarcated in the Torah and Talmud, others have been the subject of much disagreement, especially those that deal with pertinent and pressing issues. Despite the vast differences between Hasidism and Modern Orthodoxy, both are still considered legitimate. The idea that there can be more than one correct understanding is deeply rooted in Jewish texts. The most well known of such statements is from the [[Midrash]]—the collection of [[exegesis]] of [[Torah]] taught by Rabbinical Sages of the post-temple era—in Bamidbar Rabbah 13:15, which explains that there are "seventy faces to Torah".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hebrew4christians.com/Articles/Seventy_Faces/seventy_faces.html|title=The "Seventy Faces" of Torah|website=www.hebrew4christians.com|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This perplexing statement is generally understood to mean that the nature of the Torah's truth is multifaceted. Similarly, the [[Babylonian Talmud]] states regarding a legal debate that "these and these are the words of the living Lord";&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, Vilna Edition. Tractate Eruvin 13b. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; in other words, both opinions are valid. Because no single hashkafa is believed to have a monopoly on the truth, great amount of philosophical flexibility is provided to Jewish thinkers, which results in different—sometimes even contradictory—hashkafas.

Who may develop a new hashkafa is a complicated question that has been debated for centuries. Hashkafa must always be consistent with halakha; therefore, generally the most prominent rabbinic scholars of their times have successfully implemented new hashkafas because they are experts in both Jewish law and philosophy. Novel hashkafas seem to develop during periods of change and instability, within the Jewish community and within the larger society.

== Examples ==

=== Modern Orthodox ===
[[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] is a stream of Orthodox Judaism that attempts to meld the secular, modern world with traditional Jewish values and the observance of Jewish law. Modern Orthodox Jews value studying secular knowledge and are culturally engaged in society. Modern Orthodoxy is often tied to [[Religious Zionism]]. Although not identical, these hashkafas share many of the same values like supporting the [[State of Israel]].

=== Haredi Judaism ===
[[Haredi Judaism]], also called Yeshivishe, Misnagid, or Litvishe, is a stream of Orthodox Judaism that rejects modern secular culture. This stream emerged in response to the Jewish assimilation and secularization during the [[Enlightenment era]] with hopes to decrease the influence of secular society on Judaism. In contrast to Modern Orthodox Jews who embrace the modern world, Haredim (i.e. followers of Haredi Judaism) follow a strict reading of Jewish law by segregating themselves from modern society.

=== Hasidic Judaism ===
[[Hasidic Judaism]] is a stream of Orthodox Judaism that focuses on spirituality and Jewish mysticism as a fundamental aspect of faith. It was founded in 18th-century Eastern Europe by Rabbi [[Israel Baal Shem Tov]]. Hasidic Jews often engage in spiritually uplifting activities such as singing and taking cleansing ritual baths. They are recognized by their unique black garb and [[Payot|sidelocks]].

Other hashkafas include [[Torah Umadda]], Torah U’Parnasah, [[Carlebach movement|and Carlbachian]].

== Topics ==

=== Secular knowledge ===
Judaism values secular knowledge and non-Jews who study it. The Talmud in Brachot 58a says that one who sees a non-Jewish scholar should make this blessing: "Blessed be He who gave His wisdom to flesh and blood."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aish.com/ci/be/The_Jewish_Ethicist_Jewish_Wisdom_vs_Secular_Knowledge.htm|title=Redirecting...|website=www.aish.com|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the extent to which a Jew should immerse himself in secular knowledge is contentious. Some argue that the pursuit of secular knowledge complements and refines the understanding of Jewish religious knowledge. This is a fundamental principle of Torah U’Madda, an idea closely associated with Yeshiva University. Others view secular knowledge as a worthwhile endeavor as long as it serves a practical end, such as learning biology to become a physician.

Yet others vehemently oppose pursuing secular knowledge as they believe it is not valuable enough. Some even believe that secular knowledge is dangerous because it contains ideas that are antithetical to the Torah and can cause people to stray from their religious life. [[Evolution]] is one popular example.

=== Modernity ===
Because Orthodox Judaism is so deeply entrenched in its tradition, the question of how to incorporate and adapt to modernity, in terms modern of culture and thought, lies at the center of disagreements between orthodox groups. Modern Orthodox Jews view their interactions with the world around them and the development of society as an integral part of their theology. They do not view modernity as a threat; they embrace it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishboston.com/what-defines-the-modern-orthodox-movement/|title=What defines the Modern Orthodox movement?|website=JewishBoston|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Orthodox Jews are likely to view themselves as citizens of the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishboston.com/what-defines-the-modern-orthodox-movement/|title=What defines the Modern Orthodox movement?|website=JewishBoston|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Great Jewish thinkers such as Rabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] and Rabbi [[Joseph Soloveitchik]] sometimes integrated modern thought into their worldview.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=41323|title=Review of Sokol, Moshe, Judaism Examined: Essays in Jewish Philosophy and Ethics|last=Levy|first=David B.|date=2014-07-01|website=www.h-net.org|language=en|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hasidism is generally opposed to the idea of integrating modern ideas and culture into their well-established theological thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/hasidism/historical_overview|title=YIVO {{!}} Hasidism: Historical Overview|website=www.yivoencyclopedia.org|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hasidic Jews usually do not wear modern clothing, while Modern Orthodox Jews find no objection to it, provided that the clothing is modest.

=== Gender roles ===
The appropriate role of women in Jewish life and society at large varies across the spectrum of hashkafas. Hashkafas that more readily incorporate modern thought into Jewish life, tend to believe in greater gender equality. However, they will not ignore the framework of Halacha and sacrifice adherence to Jewish tradition for this end.

Some hashkafas do not address or value gender equality; consequently, distinct gender roles are magnified. Many women, especially within the Hasidic community, take pride in their unique role as [[homemaker]]s, and make their family and children their main focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2012/02/07/i-was-a-hasidic-jew-but-i-broke-free/|title=I was a Hasidic Jew – but I broke free|last=Stewart|first=Sara|website=New York Post|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there is much disagreement about the educational curriculum for women, particularly if the Talmud may be studied by women. With the exception of Modern Orthodoxy, the majority of hashkafas do not allow women to study Talmud.

=== Redemption ===
Since the emergence of the Zionist movement, many questions have arisen about the permissibility of an autonomous Jewish state in the Land of Israel prior to the arrival of the [[Messiah]]. This issue is especially complicated because the Jewish homeland is governed by secular Jews who are not strictly orthodox. There are some who oppose the State of Israel in its entirety and reject its legitimacy. Religious Zionists and Modern Orthodox Jews view the State of Israel as the first step in the process of redemption. Modern day Israel is a particularly antagonistic subject because the line between hashkafa and halakha in this area is blurry. Certain hasidic groups believe that an autonomous Jewish state in the Land of Israel is forbidden by Jewish law, and label [[Zionist]]s as heretics.

== Social life ==
For many within the Orthodox Jewish world, self-identity stems from subscribing to a specific hashkafa; therefore, hashkafa plays a central role in the social life of observant Jews. Hashkafas create cultures that can be very different. In the United States, Modern Orthodox Jews cluster to form tight-knit communities and that have their own synagogues, high schools, and community centers. Hasidic Jews also tend to live amongst themselves because cross-cultural social integration is difficult. Jews of similar hashkafas prefer together because they share much in common.

===Marriage and dating: shidduchim===
[[Shidduch|Shidduchim]], matching two people together for marriage, is heavily influenced by hashkafas. Jewish blogs are rife with posts about the marital compatibility of men and women who have different hashkafas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/coffeeroom/topic/do-girl-and-boy-need-same-exact-hashkafa|title=Do Boy &amp; Girld Need Exact Same Hashkafa? « YWN Coffee Room|website=www.theyeshivaworld.com|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dating websites, like JWed and JDate, require members to fill in a box about their hashkafa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jwed.com/new-profile.php?token=0bf29bc6&amp;sessionid=5607061460134010|title=JWed.com - Jewish Dating for Marriage|website=www.jwed.com|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; People assume that if a husband and wife have similar hashafas, they will most likely have a happy marriage.

===Head covering: kippah===
[[File:Kippa.jpg|thumb|Knitted Kippah Srugah or "Srugie"]]Although superficial and cliché, the type of head covering that a man wears is believed to be an expression of the hashkafa he subscribes to. People who identify as [[Religious Zionism|Religious Zionists]] or Modern Orthodox often wear knitted, colored [[Kippah|kippot]] (Hebrew plural of kippah). It is sometimes affectionately, and sometimes derogatorily, referred to as a "srugie" (i.e., "knitted" or "crocheted"). Men from more Yeshivishe or Haredi circles wear black, velvet ones. Many believe that kippot are self-conscious manifestations of a person's hashakfic orientation and social affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/coffeeroom/topic/black-knitted-kippa|title=Black knitted kippa? « YWN Coffee Room|website=www.theyeshivaworld.com|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This superficial and often misguided habit to pigeonhole people based on head coverings has been criticized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.frumsatire.net/2008/07/17/lets-face-it-the-type-of-yarmulke-you-wear-does-matter/|title=Lets face it the type of yarmulke you wear does matter|last=17|first=Heshy Fried on July|last2=2008|website=Frum Satire|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Kipa2kipa.jpg|thumb|Black Velvet "Yarmulke"]]

==Non-Orthodox Hashkafas==
Taken at its broadest and simplest definition, hashkafa is the overarching Torah principles that guide human action. In that sense of the word, the term Hashkafa is significant to almost all Jewish denominations who mutually associate with certain principles listed in the Torah, especially on a humanistic and philosophical level. One such example is the principle of ''[[tikkun olam]]''—taken to mean fixing the world and making it a better place—which is a nonsectarian belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usy.org/yourusy/sato/tikun_olam/|title=Tikun Olam Program {{!}} United Synagogue Youth - Conservative Jewish Teen Programming &amp; Teen Travel|website=www.usy.org|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reform Jews, Conservative Jews, and Orthodox Jews all value and emphasize this principle, but each endeavor to fulfill this concept differently based upon their respective traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishvaluesonline.org/594|title=Where does the concept of tikkun olam (repairing the world) originate, and is it a mitzvah (commandment) or does it hold the same level of importance as a mitzvah? {{!}} Jewish Values Online|website=www.jewishvaluesonline.org|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reform Judaism focuses on social action within the larger global community, while certain Orthodox groups might reject such efforts as unnecessary. Nonetheless, the term hashkafa itself generally is used only within the Orthodox community and refers solely to their guiding philosophies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6229">'''Hitbodedut''' ({{lang-he|התבודדות}}, lit. "self-seclusion",  Ashkenazic pronunciation: ''hisboydedes/hisboydedus'' or ''hisbodedus'', Sephardic pronunciation: ''hitbodedút'' ) refers to an unstructured, spontaneous and individualized form of [[prayer]] and [[meditation]], popularized by [[Rebbe]] [[Nachman of Breslov]]. Through ''hitbodedut'' one is meant to establish a close, personal relationship with [[God]] and gain a clearer understanding of one's personal motives and aspirations. However, Rebbe Nachman states that the ultimate goal is to free oneself of all negative traits that obstruct the spiritually-transforming [[Nondualism|non-dual]] realization of the "Imperative Existent," which is the Divinity inherent in all being.&lt;ref&gt;''Likutey Moharan'' I, 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
According to Rebbe Nachman, the practice of self-secluded meditation and prayer was practiced by the forefathers of Judaism—Avraham, Yitzchak, Yaakov, Moshe, David, the prophets, and their students—as well as the Torah leaders of each generation.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Avraham ben HaRambam in ''HaMaspik l'Ovdei Hashem'', ''Hisbodedus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
[[File:חסיד מתבודד.jpg|thumb|225px|left|Breslover Hasid practicing ''hitbodedut'' in the [[Jerusalem Forest]]. ''Hitbodedut'' can be performed indoors or amidst nature, and alternatively at night.]]
The method involves talking to God in an intimate, informal manner while secluded in a private setting such as a closed room or a private outdoor setting. Rebbe Nachman taught that the best place for ''hitbodedut'' is in the forests or fields. "When a person meditates in the fields, all the grasses join in his prayer and increase its effectiveness and power," he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;''Likutey Moharan'' II, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; He also suggested practicing ''hitbodedut'' in the middle of the night, when the desires and lusts of this world are at rest,&lt;ref&gt;''Likutey Moharan'' I, 52.&lt;/ref&gt; although doing it during the day is just as effective.

During a session of ''hitbodedut'', the practitioner pours out his heart to God in his own language, describing all his thoughts, feelings, problems and frustrations. Nothing was viewed by Rebbe Nachman as being too mundane for discussion, including business dealings, conflicting desires and everyday interactions. Even the inability to properly articulate what one wishes to say is viewed as a legitimate subject to discuss with God. One should also use the opportunity to examine his behavior and motivations, correcting the flaws and errors of the past while seeking the proper path for the future.

Rebbe Nachman told his leading disciple, [[Nathan of Breslov|Reb Noson]], that ''hitbodedut'' should be practiced in a simple, straightforward manner, as if he were conversing with a close friend.&lt;ref&gt;''Tzaddik'' #439; ''Kochavey Or'' #4.&lt;/ref&gt; He also advised:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is very good to pour out your thoughts before God like a child pleading before his father. God calls us His children, as it is written ([[Deuteronomy]] 14:1), "You are children to God." Therefore, it is good to express your thoughts and troubles to God like a child complaining and pestering his father."&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Nachman's Wisdom #7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Silent meditation==
''Hitbodedut'' also lends itself to certain silent meditation techniques. One is the "silent scream," which Rebbe Nachman himself practiced. He described the silent scream as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You can shout loudly in a "small still voice"… Anyone can do this. Just imagine the sound of such a scream in your mind. Depict the shout in your imagination exactly as it would sound. Keep this up until you are literally screaming with this soundless "small still voice."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is actually a scream and not mere imagination. Just as some vessels bring the sound from your lungs to your lips, others bring it to the brain. You can draw the sound through these nerves, literally bringing it into your head. When you do this, you are actually shouting inside your brain.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Nachman's Wisdom #16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another form of ''hitbodedut'' is called ''bitul'' (nullification), in which the practitioner meditates on God's presence to the exclusion of all other things, including himself.

''Hitbodedut'' is performed in one's mother tongue, in contrast to most other [[Jewish services|Jewish prayers]] that are recited in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Rebbe Nachman did not intend for ''hitbodedut'' to take the place of the three daily prescribed [[Jewish services]], but to supplement them. He recommended that his followers engage in ''hitbodedut'' for at least one hour each day.  

Hitbodedut is a staple practice for all [[Breslov (Hasidic dynasty)|Breslover Hasidim]]. The practice has been much publicized throughout [[Israel]] and the [[Jewish diaspora]] as a unique form of Jewish meditation, and is practiced by some Jews who are not Breslover Hasidim.

'''Insight''' is the understanding of a specific [[causality|cause and effect]] within a specific context. The term insight can have several related meanings:
*a piece of information
*the act or result of understanding the inner nature of things or of seeing [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitively]] (called [[noesis]] in Greek)
*an [[introspection]]
*the power of acute observation and [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], [[discernment]], and [[perception]], called intellection or noesis
*an understanding of cause and effect based on identification of relationships and behaviors within a model, context, or scenario (see [[artificial intelligence]])

An insight that manifests itself suddenly, such as understanding how to solve a difficult problem, is sometimes called by the [[German language|German]] word ''[[Eureka effect|Aha-Erlebnis]]''. The term was coined by the German psychologist and theoretical linguist [[Karl Bühler]]. It is also known as an [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], [[Eureka effect|eureka moment]] or (for cross word solvers) the penny dropping moment (PDM).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Friedlander|first=Kathryn J.|last2=Fine|first2=Philip A.|date=2016|title=The Grounded Expertise Components Approach in the Novel Area of Cryptic Crossword Solving|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/Article/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00567/abstract|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=7|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00567|issn=1664-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sudden sickening realisations identifying a problem rather than solving it, so Uh-oh rather than Aha moments are further seen in negative insight.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=Gillian|last2=Kemp|first2=Shelly M.|date=2016-02-01|title=Uh-Oh!

In psychology, insight occurs  when a solution to a problem presents itself quickly and without warning.&lt;ref name="Cognitive book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson-Riegler|first=Bridget Robinson-Riegler, Gregory|title=Cognitive psychology : applying the science of the mind|publisher=Pearson Allyn &amp; Bacon|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-205-03364-5|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the sudden discovery of the correct solution following incorrect attempts based on trial and error.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salvi|first1=Carola|last2=Bricolo|first2=Emanuela|last3=Bowden|first3=Edward|last4=Kounios|first4=John|last5=Beeman|first5=Mark|journal=Thinking and Reasoning|date=2016|doi=10.1080/13546783.2016.1141798|title=Insight solutions are correct more often than analytic solutions|pages=1–18|pmc=5035115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Psychology: Themes and Variations"&gt;{{cite book |author=Weiten, W. |author2=McCann, D.|title=Themes and Variations|year=2007|publisher=Thomson Wadsworth|location=Nelson Education ltd|isbn=978-0176472733}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solutions via Insight have been proven to be more accurate than non-insight solutions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Insight was first studied by [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt Psychology]], in the early part of the 20th century, during the search for an alternative to [[associationism]] and the associationistic view of learning.&lt;ref name="Nature of insight"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Edited by Robert&amp;nbsp;J.|title=The nature of insight|year=1996|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA; London|isbn=0-262-69187-6|edition=Reprint.|author2=Davidson, Janet E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some proposed potential mechanisms for insight include: suddenly seeing the problem in a new way, connecting the problem to another relevant problem/solution pair, releasing past experiences that are blocking the solution, or seeing problem in a larger, coherent context.&lt;ref name="Nature of insight" /&gt;

===Classic methods===
[[File:Nine Dot Problem, DLW.png|thumb|Solution to the Nine Dot problem.&lt;ref name=Nine-dot/&gt;{{pn|date=February 2018}}]]
Generally, methodological approaches to the study of insight in the laboratory involve presenting participants with problems and puzzles that cannot be solved in a conventional or logical manner.&lt;ref name="Nature of insight" /&gt; Problems of insight commonly fall into three types.&lt;ref name="Nature of insight" /&gt;

====Breaking functional fixedness====
[[File:RAT problem, DLW.png|thumb|Example of an RAT problem.]]
The first type of problem forces participants to use objects in a way they are not accustomed to (thus, breaking their [[functional fixedness]]), like the "Duncker candle problem".&lt;ref name="Nature of insight" /&gt; In the "Duncker candle problem", individuals are given matches and a box of tacks and asked to find a way to attach a candle to the wall to light the room.&lt;ref name=Duncker&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duncker|first1=Karl|last2=Lees|first2=Lynne&amp;nbsp;S.|title=On problem-solving|journal=Psychological Monographs|date=1 January 1945|volume=58|issue=5|pages=i–113|doi=10.1037/h0093599}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solution requires the participants to empty the box of tacks, set the candle inside the box, tack the box to the wall, and light the candle with the matches.

====Spatial ability====
The second type of insight problem requires spatial ability to solve, like the "Nine-dot Problem".&lt;ref name="Nature of insight" /&gt; The famous "Nine-dot problem" requires participants to draw four lines, through nine dots, without picking their pencil up.&lt;ref name=Nine-dot&gt;{{cite book|last=Sloan|first=Sam Loyd; with an introduction by Sam|title=Cyclopedia of puzzles|year=2007|publisher=Ishi Press International|location=Bronx, NY|isbn=0-923891-78-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=February 2018}}

====Using verbal ability====
The third and final type of problem requires verbal ability to solve, like the [[Remote Associates Test]] (RAT).&lt;ref name="Nature of insight" /&gt; In the RAT, individuals must think of a word that connects three, seemingly unrelated, words.&lt;ref name=RAT&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mednick|first=Sarnoff|title=The associative basis of the creative process|journal=Psychological Review|date=1 January 1962|volume=69|issue=3|pages=220–232|doi=10.1037/h0048850}}&lt;/ref&gt; RAT are often used in experiments, because they can be solved both with and without insight.&lt;ref name="Kounios &amp; Beeman (2009)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kounios|first=John|author2=Beeman, Mark|title=The Aha! Moment: The Cognitive Neuroscience of Insight|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=1 August 2009|volume=18|issue=4|pages=210–216|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01638.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specific results===

====Versus non-insight problems====
Two clusters of problems, those solvable by insight and those not requiring insight to solve, have been observed.&lt;ref name="Gilhooly &amp; Murphy (2005)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilhooly|first=KJ|author2=Murphy, P|title=Differentiating insight from non-insight problems|journal=Thinking &amp; Reasoning|date=1 August 2005|volume=11|issue=3|pages=279–302|doi=10.1080/13546780442000187}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An individual’s cognitive flexibility, [[fluency]], and vocabulary ability are predictive of performance on insight problems, but not on non-insight problems.&lt;ref name="Gilhooly &amp; Murphy (2005)" /&gt;  In contrast, [[Fluid and crystallized intelligence|fluid intelligence]] is mildly predictive of performance on non-insight problems, but not on insight problems.&lt;ref name="Gilhooly &amp; Murphy (2005)" /&gt; More recent research suggests that rather than insight versus search, that the subjective feeling of insight varies, with some solutions experienced with a stronger feeling of Aha than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Webb|first=Margaret E.|last2=Little|first2=Daniel R.|last3=Cropper|first3=Simon J.|date=2016|title=Insight Is Not in the Problem: Investigating Insight in Problem Solving across Task Types|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01424/full|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=7|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01424|issn=1664-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Danek|first=Amory H.|last2=Fraps|first2=Thomas|last3=von Müller|first3=Albrecht|last4=Grothe|first4=Benedikt|last5=Öllinger|first5=Michael|date=2014-12-08|title=It's a kind of magic—what self-reports can reveal about the phenomenology of insight problem solving|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01408|issn=1664-1078|pmc=4258999|pmid=25538658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Emotion====
People in a better mood are more likely to solve problems using insight.&lt;ref name="Subramaniam, Kounios, Parrish &amp; Jung-Beeman (2009)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Subramaniam|first=Karuna |author2=Kounios, John |author3=Parrish, Todd B. |author4=Jung-Beeman, Mark|title=A Brain Mechanism for Facilitation of Insight by Positive Affect|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=1 March 2009|volume=21|issue=3|pages=415–432|doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21057|pmid=18578603}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research demonstrated that self-reported positive affect of participants uniquely increased insight before and during the solving of a problem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shen | first1 = W. | last2 = Yuan | first2 = Y. | last3 = Liu | first3 = C. | last4 = Luo | first4 = J. | year = 2015 | title = In search of the 'Aha!' experience: Elucidating the emotionality of insight problem-solving | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume =  107| issue = | pages =  281–298| doi = 10.1111/bjop.12142 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as indicated by differing brain activity patterns.&lt;ref name="Subramaniam, Kounios, Parrish &amp; Jung-Beeman (2009)" /&gt;  People experiencing anxiety showed the opposite effect, and solved fewer problems by insight.&lt;ref name="Subramaniam, Kounios, Parrish &amp; Jung-Beeman (2009)" /&gt; Emotion can also be considered in terms of the insight experience and whether this is  a positive Aha or negative Uh-oh moment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Incubation====
Using a geometric and spatial insight problem, it was found that providing participants with breaks improved their performance as compared to participants who did not receive a break.&lt;ref name="Segal (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Segal|first=Eliaz|title=Incubation in Insight Problem Solving|journal=Creativity Research Journal|date=1 March 2004|volume=16|issue=1|pages=141–148|doi=10.1207/s15326934crj1601_13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the length of incubation between problems did not matter. Thus, participants' performance on insight problems improved just as much with a short break (4&amp;nbsp;minutes) as it did with a long break (12&amp;nbsp;minutes).&lt;ref name="Segal (2004)" /&gt;

====Sleep====
Research has shown [[sleep]] to help produce insight.&lt;ref name="Wagner, Gais, Haider, Verleger &amp; Born (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wagner|first=Ullrich |author2=Gais, Steffen |author3=Haider, Hilde |author4=Verleger, Rolf |author5=Born, Jan|title=Sleep inspires insight|journal=Nature|date=22 January 2004|volume=427|issue=6972|pages=352–355|doi=10.1038/nature02223|pmid=14737168}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Individuals were initially trained on insight problems. Following training, one group was tested on the insight problems after sleeping for eight hours at night, one group was tested after staying awake all night, and one group was tested after staying awake all day. Those that slept performed twice as well on the insight problems than those who stayed awake.&lt;ref name="Wagner, Gais, Haider, Verleger &amp; Born (2004)" /&gt;

====In the brain====
{{See also|Eureka effect#Evidence for the Aha! effect in EEG studies}}
Differences in brain activation in the left and right hemisphere seem to be indicative of insight versus non-insight solutions.&lt;ref name="Bowden &amp; Beeman (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowden|first=Edward M.|author2=Jung-Beeman, Mark|title=Aha! Insight experience correlates with solution activation in the right hemisphere|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|date=1 September 2003|volume=10|issue=3|pages=730–737|doi=10.3758/BF03196539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using RAT’s that were either presented to the left or right visual field, it was shown that participants having solved the problem with insight were more likely to have been shown the RAT on the left visual field, indicating right hemisphere processing. This provides evidence that the right hemisphere plays a unique role in insight.&lt;ref name="Bowden &amp; Beeman (2003)"/&gt;

fMRI and EEG scans of participants completing RAT's demonstrated unique brain activity corresponding to problems solved by insight.&lt;ref name="Kounios &amp; Beeman (2009)" /&gt;  For one, there is high EEG activity in the alpha- and gamma-band about 300 milliseconds before participants indicated a solution to insight problems, but not to non-insight problems.&lt;ref name="Kounios &amp; Beeman (2009)" /&gt;  Additionally, problems solved by insight corresponded to increased activity in the temporal lobes and mid-frontal cortex, while more activity in the posterior cortex corresponded to non-insight problems.&lt;ref name="Kounios &amp; Beeman (2009)" /&gt;  The data suggests there is something different occurring in the brain when solving insight versus non-insight problems that happens right before the solving of the problem. This conclusion has been supported also by eye tracking data which shows an increased eye blink duration and frequency when people solve problems via Insight. 
This latter result, paired with an eye pattern oriented to look away from sources of visual inputs ( such as looking at blank wall, or out the window at the sky )proves different attention involvement in Insight problem solving vs problem solving via anlaysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salvi|first1=Carola|last2=Bricolo|first2=Emanuela|last3=Franconeri|first3=Steven|last4=Kounios|first4=John|last5=Beeman|first5=Mark|title=Sudden insight is associated with shutting out visual inputs|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|date=December 2015|volume=22|issue=6|pages=1814–1819|doi=10.3758/s13423-015-0845-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Group insight====
It was found that groups typically perform better on insight problems (in the form of [[Rebus|rebus puzzles]] with either helpful or unhelpful clues) than individuals.&lt;ref name="Smith, Bushouse, Lord (2010)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=C.&amp;nbsp;M.|author2=Bushouse, E. |author3=Lord, J. |title=Individual and group performance on insight problems: The effects of experimentally induced fixation|journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|date=13 November 2009|volume=13|issue=1|pages=91–99|doi=10.1177/1368430209340276}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:RAT Problem, DLW.png|thumb|left|Example of a rebus puzzle. Answer: man overboard.]] Additionally, while incubation improves insight performance for individuals, it improves insight performance for groups even more.&lt;ref name="Smith, Bushouse, Lord (2010)" /&gt;  Thus, after a 15-minute break, individual performance improved for the rebus puzzles with unhelpful clues, and group performance improved for rebus puzzles with both unhelpful and helpful clues.&lt;ref name="Smith, Bushouse, Lord (2010)" /&gt;

====Individual differences====
Personality and gender, as they relate to performance on insight problems, was studied using a variety of insight problems.  It was found that participants who ranked lower on emotionality and higher on openness to experience performed better on insight problems. Men outperformed women on insight problems, and women outperformed men on non-insight problems.&lt;ref name="Lin, Hsu, Chen, Wang (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lin|first=Wei-Lun |author2=Hsu, Kung-Yu |author3=Chen, Hsueh-Chih |author4=Wang, Jenn-Wu|title=The relations of gender and personality traits on different creativities: A dual-process theory account|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2011|doi=10.1037/a0026241|volume=6|issue=2|pages=112–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher intelligence (higher IQ) has also been found to be associated with better performance on insight problems.  However, those of lower intelligence benefit more than those of higher intelligence from being provided with cues and hints for insight problems.&lt;ref name="Nature of insight" /&gt;

A recent large-scale study in Australia suggests that insight may not be universally experienced, with almost 20% of respondents reporting that they had not experienced insight.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ovington|first=Linda A.|last2=Saliba|first2=Anthony J.|last3=Moran|first3=Carmen C.|last4=Goldring|first4=Jeremy|last5=MacDonald|first5=Jasmine B.|date=2015-11-01|title=Do People Really Have Insights in the Shower? The When, Where and Who of the Aha! Moment|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jocb.126/abstract|journal=The Journal of Creative Behavior|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1002/jocb.126|issn=2162-6057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Metacognition====
Individuals are poorer at predicting their own [[metacognition]] for insight problems, than for non-insight problems.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe &amp; Wiebe (1987)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Metcalfe|first=Janet|author2=David Wiebe|title=Intuition in insight and noninsight problem solving|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|year=1987|volume=15|issue=3|pages=238–246|doi=10.3758/BF03197722}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals were asked to indicate how "hot" or "cold" to a solution they felt. Generally, they were able to predict this fairly well for non-insight problems, but not for insight problems.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe &amp; Wiebe (1987)" /&gt;  This provides evidence for the suddenness involved during insight.

====Naturalistic settings====
Recently, insight was studied in a non-laboratory setting.&lt;ref name="Klein &amp; Jarosz (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klein|first=G.|author2=Jarosz, A.|title=A Naturalistic Study of Insight|journal=Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making|date=17 November 2011|volume=5|issue=4|pages=335–351|doi=10.1177/1555343411427013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accounts of insight that have been reported in the media, such as in interviews, etc., were examined and coded. It was found that insights that occur in the field are typically reported to be associated with a sudden "change in understanding" and with "seeing connections and contradictions" in the problem.&lt;ref name="Klein &amp; Jarosz (2011)" /&gt;  It was also found that insight in nature differed from insight in the laboratory. For example, insight in nature was often rather gradual, not sudden, and incubation was not as important.&lt;ref name="Klein &amp; Jarosz (2011)" /&gt; Other studies used online questionnaires to further explore insight outside of the laboratory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jarman|first=Matthew S.|date=2014-07-01|title=Quantifying the Qualitative: Measuring the Insight Experience|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10400419.2014.929405|journal=Creativity Research Journal|volume=26|issue=3|pages=276–288|doi=10.1080/10400419.2014.929405|issn=1040-0419}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; verifying the notion that insight often happens in situations such as in the shower,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; echoing the idea that creative ideas occur in situations where divergent thought is more likely, sometimes called the Three B's of Creativity, in Bed, on the Bus or in the Bath.

====Animals====
Studies on [[primate cognition]] have provided evidence of what may be interpreted as insight in animals. In 1917, [[Wolfgang Köhler]] published his book ''[[The Mentality of Apes]]'', having studied primates on the island of [[Tenerife]] for six years. In one of his experiments, apes were presented with an insight problem that required the use of objects in new and original ways, in order to win a prize (usually, some kind of food). He observed that the animals would continuously fail to get the food, and this process occurred for quite some time; however, rather suddenly, they would purposefully use the object in the way needed to get the food, as if the realization had occurred out of nowhere. He interpreted this behavior as something resembling insight in apes.&lt;ref name="Kohler (1925)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Köhler|first=Wolfgang|title=The mentality of apes|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-20979-X|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent study suggested that elephants might also experience insight, showing that a young male elephant was able to identify and move a large cube under food that was out of reach so that he could stand on it to get the reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foerder|first=Preston|last2=Galloway|first2=Marie|last3=Barthel|first3=Tony|last4=Iii|first4=Donald E. Moore|last5=Reiss|first5=Diana|date=2011-08-18|title=Insightful Problem Solving in an Asian Elephant|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0023251|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=6|issue=8|pages=e23251|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023251|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories===
There are a number of theories representing insight; at present, no one theory dominates interpretation.&lt;ref name="Nature of insight" /&gt;

====Dual-process theory====
According to the dual-process theory, there are two systems used to solve problems.&lt;ref name="Lin, Hsu, Chen, Wang (2011)" /&gt;  The first involves logical and analytical thought processes based on reason, while the second involves intuitive and automatic processes based on experience.&lt;ref name="Lin, Hsu, Chen, Wang (2011)" /&gt;  Research has demonstrated that insight probably involves both processes; however, the second process is more influential.&lt;ref name="Lin, Hsu, Chen, Wang (2011)" /&gt;

====Three-process theory====
According to the three-process theory, intelligence plays a large role in insight.&lt;ref name="Davidson (1984)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davidson|first=J. E. |author2=Sternberg, R. J. |title=The Role of Insight in Intellectual Giftedness|journal=Gifted Child Quarterly|date=1 April 1984|volume=28|issue=2|pages=58–64|doi=10.1177/001698628402800203}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, insight involves three different processes (selective encoding, combination, and comparison), which require intelligence to apply to problems.&lt;ref name="Davidson (1984)" /&gt;  Selective encoding is the process of focusing attention on ideas relevant to a solution, while ignoring features that are irrelevant.&lt;ref name="Davidson (1984)" /&gt;  Selective combination is the process of combining the information previously deemed relevant.&lt;ref name="Davidson (1984)" /&gt;  Finally, selective comparison is the use of past experience with problems and solutions that are applicable to the current problem and solution.&lt;ref name="Davidson (1984)" /&gt;

====Four-stage model====
According to the four-stage model of insight, there are four stages to problem solving.&lt;ref name="Hadamard (1975)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hadamard|first=Jacques|title=An essay on the psychology of invention in the mathematical field|year=1975|publisher=Dover Publ.|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-486-20107-8|edition=Unaltered and unabridged reprint of the enlarged (1949)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First, the individual prepares to solve a problem.&lt;ref name="Hadamard (1975)" /&gt;  Second, the individual incubates on the problem, which encompasses trial-and-error, etc.&lt;ref name="Hadamard (1975)" /&gt;  Third, the insight occurs, and the solution is illuminated.&lt;ref name="Hadamard (1975)" /&gt;  Finally, the verification of the solution to the problem is experienced.&lt;ref name="Hadamard (1975)" /&gt;  Since this model was proposed, other similar models have been explored that contain two or three similar stages.&lt;ref name="Nature of insight" /&gt;

==Psychiatry==
{{see also|Egosyntonic and egodystonic|Introspection|Self-awareness}}
In [[psychology]] and [[psychiatry]], insight can mean the ability to recognize one's own [[mental illness]].&lt;ref&gt;Marková I.&amp;nbsp;S. (2005) ''Insight in Psychiatry''.

"Insight" can also refer to other matters in psychology; [[problem solving]] behavior requiring insight is the subject of [[insight phenomenology]].

An insight is the derivation of a rule which links [[cause]] with [[Causality|effect]].  The [[mind]] is a model of the universe built up from insights.

Thoughts of the mind fall into two categories: 
# Analysis of past experience with the purpose of gaining insight for use within this model at a later date
# Simulations of future scenarios using existing insights in the mind model in order to predict outcomes
A mature mind has assimilated many insights and represents a sophisticated model of the universe. The mind-model might be inaccurate. When insight is not subordinate to a validation discipline like the '[[scientific method]]', '[[List of fallacies|fallacious]]' thinking can result in a confused mind.
 
Intuition, which is often described in the popular literature as an alternative thought process, is merely another manifestation of insight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Giannini | first1 = AJ | last2 = Daood | first2 = J | last3 = Giannini | first3 = MC | last4 = Boniface | first4 = RS | last5 = Rhodes | first5 = PG | year = 1978 | title = Intellect versus intuition&amp;mdash;a dichotomy in the reception of nonverbal communication | url = | journal = Journal of General Psychology | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = 19–25 | doi=10.1080/00221309.1978.9920890}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this process, multiple bits of seemingly unrelated data are linked together and a hypothesis or plan of action is generated. Usually this process is generated in a novel situation. Such a circumstance links data which had previously seemed unrelated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Giannini | first1 = AJ | last2 = Barringer | first2 = ME | last3 = Giannini | first3 = MC | last4 = Loiselle | first4 = RH | year = 1984 | title = Lack of relationship between handedness and intuitive and intellectual (rationalistic) modes of information processing | url = | journal = Journal of General Psychology | volume = 111 | issue = | pages = 31–37 | doi=10.1080/00221309.1984.9921094}}&lt;/ref&gt; The categories and analytical process, however, are not distinct from any other form of insight. The only difference is the degree of novelty of the stimulus.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Spirituality==
The [[Pali]] word for "insight" is ''[[vipassana]]'', which has been adopted as the name of a kind of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[mindfulness]] meditation. Recent research indicates that mindfulness meditation does facilitate solving of insight problems with dosage of 20&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ren|first=Jun|author2=Huang, ZhiHui |author3=Luo, Jing |author4=Wei, GaoXia |author5=Ying, XiaoPing |author6=Ding, ZhiGuang |author7=Wu, YiBin |author8= Luo, Fei |title=Meditation promotes insightful problem-solving by keeping people in a mindful and alert conscious state|journal=Science China Life Sciences|date=29 October 2011|volume=54|issue=10|pages=961–965|doi=10.1007/s11427-011-4233-3|pmid=22038009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
Pat Conroy{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} points out that an insight is a statement based on a deep understanding of your target [[consumer]]s' attitudes and beliefs, which connect at an emotional level with your consumer, provoking a clear response (''This brand understands me!  That is exactly how I feel! &amp;mdash; even if they've never thought about it quite like that)'' which, when leveraged, has the power to change [[consumer behavior]].  Insights must effect a change in consumer behavior that benefits your [[brand]], leading to the achievement of the [[marketing]] objective.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Insights can be based on:
# Real or perceived weakness to be exploited in competitive product performance or value
# Attitudinal or perceived barrier in the minds of consumers, regarding your brand
# Untapped or compelling belief or practice

Insights are most effective when they are/do one of the following:
# Unexpected
# Create a disequilibrium
# Change momentum
# Exploited via a benefit or point of difference that your brand can deliver

In order to be actionable, as the expression of a consumer truth, an insight as to be stated as an articulated sentence, containing:&lt;ref&gt;cf. http://www.insightquest.fr/quest-ce-quun-insights.html&lt;/ref&gt;
#  An observation or a wish, e.g. "I would like to ...."
#  A motivation explaining the wish, e.g. " because ..."
#  A barrier preventing the consumer from being satisfied with the fulfillment of his/her motivation, e.g. " but..."

The gap between the second and the third term offers a tension, which constitutes a potential for a brand. Like there are concept writers for copies, there are insight writers.

In technical terminology of insight in market research is the understanding of local market by referring different source of information (such as quantitative research and qualitative research) proving for the consumers' insight.

'''Jan Zwicky''' (born 10 May 1955) is a Canadian philosopher, poet, essayist, and musician.

==Life and career==
Zwicky received her BA from the [[University of Calgary]] and earned her PhD at the [[University of Toronto]] in 1981 where her studies focussed on the [[philosophy of logic]] and [[philosophy of science|science]]. She subsequently taught philosophy at [[Princeton University]]; philosophy and interdisciplinary humanities at the [[University of Waterloo]]; philosophy at the [[University of Western Ontario]]; philosophy, English, and creative writing at the [[University of New Brunswick]]; and philosophy at the [[University of Alberta]].

Zwicky is [[emeritus|Professor Emerita]] in the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Victoria]], where she taught both philosophy and interdisciplinary humanities courses from 1996 until 2009. She has served as a faculty member at the [[Banff Centre]] Writing Studio, has conducted numerous writing workshops, and has served as an editor for Brick Books since 1985. Since 2017 she has been the series editor of Oksana Poetry and Poetics, published by the University of Regina Press.

==Philosophy&lt;ref&gt;''Lyric Ecology: An Appreciation of the Work of Jan Zwicky'', eds Mark Dickinson and Clare Goulet. (Toronto: Cormorant Books, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;==

[[Heraclitus]], [[Plato]], [[Freud]], [[Simone Weil]] and [[Wittgenstein]] are the thinkers who figure most prominently in Zwicky's philosophical work, which challenges the hegemonic status of logico-linguistic analysis in 20th and 21st century Anglo-American philosophy. She is a realist who aims to defeat analytic skepticism by exploring the relationship between philosophical and poetic thinking, and by developing the notions of ''resonance'' and ''lyric'' understanding in [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]]:

"Lyric shares with the coherentists, pragmatists, and nihilists the view that foundationalism is intellectually bankrupt: that what analytic system cannot sustain is anything like the claim of naive realism. However, lyric shares with naive realism the view that skepticism is false. What it does not share is the view that it is demonstrably, within system, false." (''Lyric Philosophy'' L264)

Her books, ''Lyric Philosophy'' and ''Wisdom &amp; Metaphor'', discuss but also enact this idea of resonance. They consist of many voices that range across diverse disciplines, so that Zwicky's [[aphoristic]] remarks on the left-hand pages are read with and against excerpts from the [[history of philosophy]], musical scores, paintings, photographs, and poems on the right-hand pages. While Zwicky orders her remarks carefully and has a linear philosophical argument to make, each page is also designed to evoke remarks or images from other pages, prompting non-linear connections and directly demonstrating what she refers to as lyric structure, characterized by resonance.

Zwicky believes that [[Heraclitus]], [[Plato]], and [[Wittgenstein]] have purposefully constructed philosophical texts in this way before her. She cites [[Freud]]'s distinction between primary and secondary processes, as well as [[Max Wertheimer]]'s work in [[gestalt psychology]], as support for the concepts she promotes. She references pieces of music, works of art, and natural eco-systems as objects that also exhibit lyric structure.

Zwicky presents logical analysis and lyric thinking as complementary and includes both in a broader, more total conception of reason. She believes that the Anglo-American notion of what constitutes good philosophy is excessively narrow, and criticizes Continental and poststructural views for their anti-realist vision of the world as nothing more than a projection of human thought and desire. Zwicky promotes balance, arguing that neglect of either logical or lyric thinking leads to our ontological, epistemological, ethical and environmental peril.

Dr. James O. Young, Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Victoria]] has said: "There’s a reasonable chance that people will be reading her work a century from now. This is something that one says about only a very small number of philosophers."&lt;ref name="vic"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ring.uvic.ca/02sep19/zwicky.html | title=Excellence in Teaching Awards. Philosopher/poet wins humanities teaching award.  | publisher=The Ring. University of Victoria's community newspaper. | author= Joy Poliquin| accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetry==

Zwicky's poetry is influenced by music in the classical European, blues, and jazz traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Medley| first = Mark| author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = The Griffin Poetry Prize Questionnaire: Jan Zwicky| newspaper = National Post| pages = | year = | date = 4 June 2012| url = http://news.nationalpost.com/afterword/the-griffin-poetry-prize-questionnaire-jan-zwicky| accessdate = 31 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also deals with the natural world, and has often been cited for its intense lyricism. Numerous individual poems have been translated into Czech, French, German, Serbian, Spanish and Italian.

Among her many accolades, both Zwicky's [[1999 Governor General's Awards|''Songs for Relinquishing the Earth'']] and [[2004 Governor General's Awards|''Robinson's Crossing'']] were shortlisted for [[Governor General's Awards]] for Poetry. ''Songs for Relinquishing the Earth'' won the award in 1999. ''Robinson’s Crossing'' won the [[Dorothy Livesay Poetry Prize]] in 2004.

Her 2011 book, ''Forge'', was shortlisted for the 2012 Canadian [[Griffin Poetry Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.griffinpoetryprize.com/awards-and-poets/shortlists/2012-shortlist/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Corcoran''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɔr|k|ər|ən}}; born 1937) is an American [[logic]]ian, [[philosopher]], [[mathematician]], and [[History of logic|historian of logic]]. He is best known for his philosophical work on concepts such as the nature of [[inference]], relations between [[Condition (philosophy)|conditions]], [[argument-deduction-proof distinctions]], the relationship between [[logic]] and [[epistemology]], and the place of [[proof theory]] and [[model theory]] in logic. Nine of Corcoran's papers have been translated into Spanish, Portuguese, [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Arabic]]; his 1989 "signature" essay&lt;ref&gt;Argumentations and Logic.

==Education==
Corcoran studied engineering at the [[Baltimore Polytechnic Institute]], with a degree in Advanced Curriculum Engineering in 1956, and at the [[Johns Hopkins University]] with a BES in Mechanical Engineering in 1959. After briefly working in engineering, he studied philosophy at the [[Johns Hopkins University]] where he obtained his PhD in philosophy in 1963. His post-doctoral studies in mathematics were at [[Yeshiva University]] in
1964 and at the [[University of California Berkeley]] in 1965. His dissertation topic was Generative Structure of Two-valued Logics.

Corcoran's first logic teacher was [[Albert Hammond]]. Corcoran studied Plato and Aristotle with [[Ludwig Edelstein]].  His next two logic teachers were [[Joseph Ullian]] and [[Richard Wiebe]]. Corcoran's dissertation supervisor was [[Robert McNaughton]].  At Yeshiva University in New York City Corcoran studied with [[Raymond Smullyan]] and [[Martin Davis]]. Corcoran's first tenure-track position was at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where his dissertation supervisor was a Professor of Computer and Information Science.

==Research profile==

Corcoran's work in [[history of logic]] involves most of the discipline's
productive periods. He has discussed [[Aristotle]], the [[Stoicism|Stoics]], [[William of Ockham]], [[Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri]], [[George Boole]], [[Richard Dedekind]], [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Clarence Irving Lewis]], the American Postulate Theorists, [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], and [[Warren Goldfarb]].

His 1972 interpretation of Aristotle's [[Prior Analytics]],&lt;ref&gt;Degnan, M. 1994. Recent Work in Aristotle's Logic. Philosophical Books 35.2 (April, 1994): 81-89.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed independently by [[Timothy Smiley]] at about the same time, has been found to be more faithful than previous interpretations both to the Greek text and to the historical context. It has formed the basis for subsequent investigations by Edgar Andrade, George Boger, Manuel Correia, Paolo Crivelli, [[Newton da Costa]], Catarina Dutilh, Paolo Fait, Nicolas Fillion, James Gasser, Klaus Glashoff, John Martin, Mary Mulhern, Michael Scanlan, Robin Smith, Neil Tennant, and others. It was adopted for the 1989 translation of the Prior Analytics by Robin Smith and for the 2009 translation of the Prior Analytics Book A by [[Gisela Striker]].

His 1980 critical reconstruction of Boole's original 1847 system revealed previously unnoticed gaps and errors in Boole's work and established the essentially Aristotelian basis of Boole's philosophy of logic. A 2003 article&lt;ref&gt;Corcoran, John (2003). “Aristotle's Prior Analytics and Boole's Laws of Thought”. ''History and Philosophy of Logic'', '''24''': 261–288. Reviewed by Risto Vilkko. ''Bulletin of Symbolic Logic'', '''11'''(2005) 89–91. Also by Marcel Guillaume, ''Mathematical Reviews'' 2033867 (2004m:03006).&lt;/ref&gt; provides a systematic comparison and critical evaluation of [[Aristotelian logic]] and [[Boolean logic]]; it also reveals the centrality of [[wholistic reference]] in Boole's [[philosophy of logic]]. According to Corcoran, Boole fully accepted and endorsed Aristotle's logic. Boole did not dispute one point that Aristotle made, but he did  “go under, over, and beyond” Aristotle's logic by 1) providing it with mathematical foundations involving equations,2) extending the class of problems it could treat—to assessing validity he added solving equations--,and 3) expanding the range of applications it could handle—e.g. from propositions having only two terms to those having arbitrarily many.

More specifically, Boole agreed with what [[Aristotle]] said; Boole's ‘disagreements’, if they might be called that, concern what Aristotle did not say. 
First, in the realm of foundations, Boole reduced Aristotle's four propositional forms of to one form, that of equations—-by itself a revolutionary idea. 
Second, in the realm of logic's problems, Boole's addition of equation solving to logic—-another revolutionary idea—-involved Boole's doctrine that Aristotle's rules of inference (the “perfect syllogisms”) must be supplemented by rules for equation solving. 
Third, in the realm of applications, Boole's system could handle multi-term propositions and arguments whereas Aristotle could handle only two-termed subject-predicate propositions and arguments. For example, Aristotle's system could not deduce “No quadrangle that is a square is a rectangle that is a rhombus” from “No square that is a quadrangle is a rhombus that is a rectangle” or from “No rhombus that is a rectangle is a square that is a quadrangle”.

==Scientific work==

His work in [[philosophy of logic]] focuses on the nature of logic, the role of logic in
inquiry, the conceptual structure of logic, the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[epistemological]] presuppositions
of logic, the nature of [[mathematical logic]] and the gaps between logical theory and mathematical
practice. His [[mathematical logic]] treats [[propositional logic]]s, [[modal logic]]s, identity logics,
[[syllogistic]] logics, the logic of first-order variable-binding term operators, [[second-order logic]]s,
[[model theory]], and [[Concatenation theory|the theory of strings]] – a discipline which is foundational in all areas of logic
and which provides essential background for all of his other mathematical work. In [[philosophy of mathematics]] Corcoran has been guided by a nuanced and inclusionary [[Platonism]] which
strives to do justice to all aspects of mathematical and logical experience including those aspects
emphasized by competing philosophical perspectives such as [[logicism]], [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]],
[[deductivism]], and [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]]. Although several of his philosophical papers presuppose little
history or mathematics, his historical papers often involve either original philosophy (e.g. his
recent BSL article “Schemata”) or original mathematics (e.g. his 1980 HPL article
“Categoricity”). He has referred to the mathematical dimension of his approach to history as
mathematical archaeology. His philosophical papers often involve original historical research. He has been
guided by the Aristotelian principle that the nature of modern thought is sometimes best
understood in light of its historical development, a view that he attributes to [[Arthur Lovejoy]]’s
History of Ideas Program at Johns Hopkins University and in which he has been encouraged by
the American philosopher and historian Peter Hare.&lt;ref&gt;Corcoran, John, (2009). Remembering My Life with Peter Hare. Remembering Peter Hare 1935–2008. Ed. J. Campbell. Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy. pp. 9–16.

==Collaboration==

Many of Corcoran’s articles and reviews are co-authored and many of his single-author
publications acknowledge involvement of colleagues and students. Corcoran emphasizes the
intensely and essentially personal nature of all genuine knowledge including logical knowledge.
Nevertheless, he also stresses the importance of communities of knowers and how much each person can
benefit in the personal search for truth from critical cooperation with other objective researchers. For over 40 years he was the leader of the “Buffalo Syllogistic Group”—a community of philosophers, historians, linguists, logicians, and mathematicians dedicated to the study of the origin of logic. The achievements of this community are sketched in his 2009 paper [http://www.revistas.unal.edu.co/index.php/idval/article/viewFile/12581/13183 “Aristotle’s Logic at the University at Buffalo’s Department of Philosophy”, Ideas y Valores]: Revista Colombiana de Filosofía 140 (August 2009) 99–117.
A list of his publications, complete through 2000, appears in the 1999 volume of [http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/tf/01445340.html History and Philosophy of Logic], which also includes the expository article by M. Scanlan and S. [[Stewart Shapiro|Shapiro]]
“The Work of John Corcoran: An Appreciation”. Other articles about his work include
“Corcoran the Mathematician” by S. [[Stewart Shapiro|Shapiro]], “Corcoran the Philosopher” by J. M. Sagüillo, and
“Corcoran in Spanish” by C. Martínez-Vidal; all appear in a 2007 volume published by the
[[University of Santiago de Compostela]] Press.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=9IMEm4dYQXUC .&lt;/ref&gt;
Corcoran's work in the 1990s on information-theoretic logic is discussed by [[José Miguel Sagüillo|José M. Sagüillo]] in the article “Methodological Practice and Complementary Concepts of Logical Consequence: Tarski's Model-Theoretic Consequence and Corcoran's Information-Theoretic Consequence” (History and Philosophy of Logic
volume 30, 2009, 21-48), which received the 2009 Ivor Grattan-Guinness Award for the History and Philosophy of Logic ( http://informaworld.com/thpl ).

==Teaching==
Corcoran's courses are all introductory, having no prerequisites and presupposing no
previous knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1091372&lt;/ref&gt; In each course he reconstructs its subject-matter from the ground up and never covers the same material twice. Stressing the priority of education over indoctrination and the superiority of learning how to think over learning what to think, he strives to assist his
students in connecting with the reality logic is about so that they may become autonomous judges of the adequacy of the field.&lt;ref&gt;Corcoran, John, 2012. ‘’Farewell letter to my students”. ‘‘Philosophy Now’’.  
Issue ‘’’97’’’ September/October 2012.http://www.pdcnet.org/philnow/content/philnow_2012_0092_0018_0018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kazimierz Kuratowski''' (Polish pronunciation: {{IPA|[kaˈʑimjɛʂ kuɾaˈtɔfskʲi]}}, 2 February 1896 – 18 June 1980) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[mathematician]] and [[logic]]ian. He was one of the leading representatives of the [[Warsaw School of Mathematics]].

==Biography and studies==

Kazimierz Kuratowski was born in [[Warsaw]], [[Vistula Land]] (the part of the former [[Kingdom of Poland]] controlled by the [[Russian Empire]]), on 2 February 1896, into an assimilated Jewish family. He was a son of Marek Kuratow, a [[barrister]], and Róża Karzewska. He completed a Warsaw secondary school, which was named after general Paweł Chrzanowski. In 1913, he enrolled in an engineering course at the [[University of Glasgow]] in [[Scotland]], in part because he did not wish to study in Russian; instruction in Polish was prohibited. He completed only one year of study when the outbreak of [[World War I]] precluded any further enrollment. In 1915, Russian forces withdrew from Warsaw and [[Warsaw University]] was reopened with Polish as the language of instruction. Kuratowski restarted his university education there the same year, this time in mathematics. He obtained his Ph.D. in 1921, in newly [[Second Polish Republic|independent Poland]].

===Doctoral thesis===
In autumn 1921 Kuratowski was awarded the Ph.D. degree for his groundbreaking work. His thesis statement consisted of two parts. One was devoted to an [[axiomatic]] construction of [[topology]] via the closure axioms. This first part (republished in a slightly modified form in 1922) has been cited in hundreds of scientific articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuratowski|1922}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second part of Kuratowski's thesis was devoted to [[Continuum (set theory)|continua]] irreducible between two points.  This was the subject of a French doctoral thesis written by [[Zygmunt Janiszewski]].  Since Janiszewski was deceased, Kuratowski's supervisor was [[Wacław Sierpiński]]. Kuratowski's thesis solved certain problems in set theory raised by a Belgian mathematician, [[Charles Jean de la Vallée-Poussin|Charles-Jean Étienne Gustave Nicolas]], Baron de la Vallée Poussin.

===Academic career until World War II===
Two years later, in 1923, Kuratowski was appointed deputy professor of mathematics at Warsaw University. He was then appointed a full professor of mathematics at [[Lwów Polytechnic]] in [[Lwów]], in 1927. He was the head of the Mathematics department there until 1933. Kuratowski was also dean of the department twice. In 1929, Kuratowski became a member of the [[Warsaw Scientific Society]]

While Kuratowski associated with many of the scholars of the [[Lwów School of Mathematics]], such as [[Stefan Banach]] and [[Stanislaw Ulam]], and the circle of mathematicians based around the [[Scottish Café]] he kept close connections with Warsaw. Kuratowski left Lwów for Warsaw in 1934, before the famous [[Scottish Book]] was begun (in 1935), hence did not contribute any problems to it. He did however, collaborate closely with Banach in solving important problems in [[measure theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Kuratowski.html MacTutor article: Kazimierz Kuratowski].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.day.kiev.ua/en/article/society/scottish-book-lvivs-mathematical-relic www.day.kiev.ua article: "Scottish Book: Lviv’s mathematical relic"].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 he was appointed the professor at [[Warsaw University]]. A year later Kuratowski was nominated as the head of Mathematics Department there. From 1936 to 1939 he was secretary of the Mathematics Committee in The Council of Science and Applied Sciences.

===During and after the war===
During World War II, he gave lectures at the [[Education in Poland during World War II|underground university in Warsaw]], since higher education for Poles was forbidden under [[Nazi occupation of Poland|German occupation]].

In February 1945, Kuratowski started to lecture at the reopened Warsaw University. In 1945, he became a member of the [[Polish Academy of Learning]], in 1946 he was appointed vice-president of the Mathematics department at Warsaw University, and from 1949 he was chosen to be the vice-president of Warsaw Scientific Society. In 1952 he became a member of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]], of which he was the vice-president from 1957 to 1968.

After World War II, Kuratowski was actively involved in the rebuilding of scientific life in Poland. He helped to establish the State Mathematical Institute, which was incorporated into the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1952. From 1948 until 1967 Kuratowski was director of the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences, and was also a long-time chairman of the Polish and International Mathematics Societies. He was president of the Scientific Council of the State Institute of Mathematics (1968–1980). From 1948 to 1980 he was the head of the topology section. One of his students was [[Andrzej Mostowski]].

==Legacy==
Kazimierz Kuratowski was one of a celebrated group of Polish mathematicians who would meet at Lwów's [[Scottish Café]]. He was a president of the Polish Mathematical Society (PTM) and a member of the Warsaw Scientific Society (TNW). What is more, he was chief editor in "Fundamenta Mathematicae", a series of publications in "Polish Mathematical Society Annals". Furthermore, Kuratowski worked as an editor in the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] Bulletin. He was also one of the writers of the Mathematical monographs, which were created in cooperation with the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IMPAN). High quality research monographs of the representatives of Warsaw's and Lwów’s School of Mathematics, which concerned all areas of pure and applied mathematics, were published in these volumes.

Kazimierz Kuratowski was an active member of many scientific societies and foreign scientific academies, including the Royal Society of [[Edinburgh]], [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Italy]] and the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR).

===Kazimierz Kuratowski Prize===
In 1981, IMPAN, the [[Polish Mathematical Society]], and Kuratowski's daughter Zofia Kuratowska established a prize in his name for achievements in mathematics to people under the age of 30 years.&lt;ref name="prize"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nagroda im. Kazimierza Kuratowskiego|url=https://www.impan.pl/pl/wydarzenia/nagrody/nagroda-kazimierza-kuratowskiego|website=Instytut Matematyczny Polskiej Akademii Nauk|accessdate=19 July 2017|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize is considered the most prestigious of awards for young Polish mathematicians; past recipients have included [[Józef H. Przytycki]], [[Mariusz Lemańczyk]], [[Tomasz Łuczak]], [[Mikołaj Bojańczyk]], and [[Wojciech Samotij]].&lt;ref name="prize"/&gt;

==Research==
Kuratowski’s research mainly focused on abstract topological and metric structures. He implemented the closure axioms (known in mathematical circles as the [[Kuratowski closure axioms]]). This was fundamental for the development of topological space theory and irreducible continuum theory between two points. The most valuable results, which were obtained by Kazimierz Kuratowski after the war are those that concern the relationship between [[topology]] and [[analytic functions]] (theory), and also research in the field of cutting Euclidean spaces. Together with [[Stanislaw Ulam|Ulam]], who was Kuratowski’s most talented student during the [[Lwów]] Period, he introduced the concept of so-called quasi homeomorphism that opened up a new field in topological studies.
Kuratowski’s research in the field of measure theory, including research with [[Banach]], [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]], was continued by many students. Moreover, with [[Alfred Tarski]] and [[Wacław Sierpiński]] he provided most of the theory concerning [[Polish space]]s (that are indeed named after these mathematicians and their legacy). Knaster and Kuratowski brought a comprehensive and precise study to connected components theory. It was applied to issues such as cutting-plane, with the paradoxical examples of connected components.

Kuratowski proved the Kuratowski-Zorn lemma (often called just [[Zorn's lemma]]) in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Fundamenta Mathematicae 3: p.&lt;/ref&gt; This result has important connections to many basic theorems. Zorn gave its application in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, 41: p.&lt;/ref&gt; Kuratowski implemented many concepts in set theory and topology. In many cases, Kuratowski established new terminology and symbolism.
His contributions to mathematics include:
* a characterization of [[topological space]]s which are now called [[Kuratowski closure axioms]];
* proof of the [[Zorn's lemma|Kuratowski–Zorn lemma]];
* in [[graph theory]], the characterization of [[planar graph]]s now known as [[Kuratowski's theorem]];
* identification of the [[ordered pair]] &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; with the set &lt;math&gt;\{\{x\},\{x,y\}\};&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuratowski|1921|p=171}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Kuratowski finite set definition, see [[Kuratowski-finite]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuratowski|1920}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* introduction of the [[Tarski–Kuratowski algorithm]];
* [[Kuratowski's closure-complement problem]];
* [[Kuratowski's free set theorem]];
* Kuratowski convergence of subsets of metric spaces;
* the [[Kuratowski and Ryll-Nardzewski measurable selection theorem]];

Kuratowski’s post-war works were mainly focused on three strands:
* The development of homotopy in continuous functions.
* The construction of connected space theory in higher dimensions.
* The uniform depiction of cutting Euclidean spaces by any of its subsets, based on the properties of continuous transformations of these sets.

==Publications==
Among over 170 published works are valuable monographs and books including Topologie (Vol. I, 1933, translated into English and Russian, and Vol. II, 1950) and Introduction to Set Theory and Topology (Vol. I, 1952, translated into English, French, Spanish, and Bulgarian). He authored  "A Half Century of Polish Mathematics 1920-1970: Remembrances and Reflections" (1973)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuratowski|1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Notes to his autobiography" (1981).  The latter was published posthumously thanks to Kuratowski's daughter Zofia Kuratowska, who prepared his notes for printing. Kazimierz Kuratowski represented Polish mathematics in the International Mathematics Union where he was vice president from 1963 to 1966. What is more, he participated in numerous international congresses and lectured at dozens of universities around the world. He was an honorary causa doctor at the Universities in Glasgow, Prague, Wroclaw, and Paris. He received the highest national awards, as well as a gold medal of the [[Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences]], and the [[Polish Academy of Science]]. Kuratowski died on 18 June 1980 in Warsaw.

The '''knowledge revolution''' refers to a global-scale [[paradigm shift]] that many{{who|date=February 2016}} compare to the [[British Agricultural Revolution|agricultural]] and [[industrial revolution]]s.  The revolution is about a fundamental socioeconomic change from [[added value|adding value]] by producing things which is, ultimately limited, to adding value by creating and using [[knowledge]] which can grow indefinitely.

==Theories==

Overviews of the knowledge revolution were provided by [[Marilyn Ferguson]],&lt;ref name=ferguson&gt;{{cite book|author=Ferguson, Marilyn|year=1980|title=The Aquarian Conspiracy|publisher=J.P. Tarcher|location=Los Angeles, CA. |isbn=9780874774580|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; who refers to the ascendance of an irreversible shift in the global state of mind; a fundamentally new world view that encompasses insights from ancient times through current breakthrough science.  Sakaiya&lt;ref&gt;Sakaiya, Taichi. 1991. The Knowledge-Value Revolution. Kodansha International, New York. p157&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that three major disrupters of the established order – population shifts, resource supply, and technological developments are producing phenomena never before encountered in the industrial society.  Brown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brown, David|year=1997|title=Cybertrends|publisher=Penguin Books, London|pages=14|isbn=9780670861422}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that the revolution will not flow from the mobilization of new machines; rather, it will require a fundamental revamp of the human context in which machines are used.  Finally, Johnson &lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Steven D. 1997. Interface Culture. p5&lt;/ref&gt; observes that when such paradigm shifts occur only once every few centuries, one has to be a visionary to see beyond the limits of current forms.

From a perspective of understanding this global societal sea change, Savage&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Charles M. 1990 5th Generation Management. Digital Press, Burlington, MA. p76&lt;/ref&gt; states that the shift is one of attitudes, values, and norms.  It will only come through a struggle of thought because many of the changes are counterintuitive from a traditional point of view and they are difficult to conceptualize with industrial era vocabulary.  He also notes that it will not be a simple or cumulative process, in that new principles will have to be learned and some old principles will have to be unlearned.  Brown (1999) indicates that creating new frameworks for the evolving world will require challenging the assumptions that support our traditional intellectual constructs.

In terms of what will shift, Gilder&lt;ref&gt;Gilder, George. 1989. Microcosm: The Quantum Revolution in Economics and Technology.&lt;/ref&gt; states that the basic tenet of the knowledge revolution will be the “overthrow of matter.”  Wealth, in the form of physical assets will diminish, while wealth, in the form of knowledge assets will increase.  The power of mind will usurp the brute force of things.  Similarly, [[Jeremy Rifkin]]&lt;ref&gt;Rifkin, Jeremy. 2000. The Age of Access. Penguin Putnam, New York. p55&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that whereas the industrial age emphasized the exchange of goods and services, the coming age will emphasize the exchange of concepts.

From an organizational perspective, Amidon&lt;ref&gt;Amidon, Debra M. 1997. Innovation Strategy for the Knowledge Economy. Butterworth-Heinemann, Newton, MA p14, {{ISBN|9780750698412}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that the knowledge movement is reshaping how organizations are created, evolve, mature, and evolve or die.  It is reshaping how business is done, how economies develop, and how societies prosper.  Ruggles and Holtshouse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Ruggles, Rudy and David Holtshouse|year=1999|title=The Knowledge Advantage|publisher=Capstone Business Books, Dover, NH|pages=49|isbn=978-1841120676}}&lt;/ref&gt; note that the movement is characterized by a dispersion of power and by managers who lead by empowering [[knowledge worker]]s to contribute and make decisions.

From a societal perspective, [[John Seely Brown]]&lt;ref name=jsbrown&gt;Brown, John Seely. 1999. In: The Knowledge Advantage (Ruggles, 1999). forward&lt;/ref&gt; asks a number of key questions, including who will control the keys to the digital domain? Who will be the trusted intermediary in the marketplace?  How transparent will their mediation be?  What standards will be used for accountability? [[Thomas A. Stewart]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stewart, Thomas A.|year=1997|title=Intellectual Capital|publisher=Bantam Doubleday Dell, New York|pages=17|isbn=978-0385483810}}&lt;/ref&gt; points out that just as the industrial revolution did not end agriculture because people have to eat, this revolution will not end industry because we still need physical products.

The digital revolution is revolutionizing the future agriculture. Thus, future agriculture, more importantly, the agricultural systems modelling could benefit from the advancements in [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] with [[big data]], [[crowdsourcing]], [[remote sensing]], and high computational abilities, catching up with the relative slow developments{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} over the last two decades. Tools to enable visualization of agricultural source data, model outputs and synthesized data products are needed to enhance the discovery and understanding of information for the entire spectrum of future agriculture users, including data collectors, model developers, model users, integrative research, application developers and end users. To make sense of large amounts of unfamiliar or complex data, humans need overviews, summaries, and the capability to look for patterns and discover emergent phenomena, empirical models, and theories related to the data.

'''Knowledge organization''' ('''KO'''), '''organization of knowledge''', '''organization of information''', or '''information organization''' is a branch of [[library and information science]] (LIS) concerned with activities such as [[Documentation science|document description]], [[bibliographic index|indexing]], and [[library classification|classification]] performed in libraries, [[database]]s, [[archive]]s, etc. It addresses the "activities carried out and tools used by people who work in places that accumulate information resources (e.g., books, maps, documents, datasets, images) for the use of humankind, both immediately and for posterity. It discusses the processes that are in place to make resources findable, whether someone is searching for a single known item or is browsing through hundreds of resources just hoping to discover something useful. Information organization supports a myriad of information-seeking scenarios."&lt;ref&gt;Joudrey, Daniel N., and Arlene G. Taylor. ''The Organization of Information'', 4th ed. Santa Barbara,CA: Libraries Unlimited, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional human-based approaches performed by librarians, archivists, and subject specialists are increasingly challenged by computational ([[big data]]) algorithmic techniques.  KO as a field of study is concerned with the nature and quality of such knowledge organizing processes (KOP) (such as [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] and [[ontology (information science)|ontology]]) as well as the resulting [[Knowledge organization system|knowledge organizing systems]] (KOS).

Divergent historical and theoretical approaches towards organizing knowledge are based on different views of [[knowledge]], [[cognition]], [[language]], and [[social organization]]. This richness lends itself to many complementary ways to consider knowledge organization.  The academic [[International Society for Knowledge Organization]] (ISKO) engages with these issues via the research journal ''[[Knowledge Organization (journal)|Knowledge Organization]]''.

==Theoretical approaches==

One widely used analysis of organizational principles summarizes them as Location, Alphabet, Time, Category, Hierarchy (LATCH).&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Saul Wurman]], ''Information Anxiety'', 1990 {{ISBN|0553348566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional approaches===
Among the major figures in the history of KO are [[Melvil Dewey]] (1851–1931) and [[Henry E. Bliss|Henry Bliss]] (1870–1955). 

Dewey's goal was an efficient way to manage library collections; not an optimal system to support users of libraries. His system was meant to be used in many libraries as a standardized way to manage collections. The first version of this system was created in 1876. 

An important characteristic in Henry Bliss' (and many contemporary thinkers of KO) was that the sciences tend to reflect the order of Nature and that library classification should reflect the order of knowledge as uncovered by science: 
 
[[Natural order (philosophy)|Natural order]] --&gt; [[Scientific Classification]] --&gt; Library classification (KO)

The implication is that librarians, in order to classify books, should know about scientific developments. This should also be reflected in their education: “Again from the standpoint of the higher education of librarians, the teaching of systems of classification . . . would be perhaps better conducted by including courses in the systematic encyclopedia and methodology of all the sciences, that is to say, outlines which try to summarize the most recent results in the relation to one another in which they are now studied together. . . .” ([[Ernest Cushing Richardson]], quoted from Bliss, 1935, p.&amp;nbsp;2).

Among the other principles, which may be attributed to the traditional approach to KO are: 

* Principle of [[controlled vocabulary]]
* [[Cutter Expansive Classification|Cutter’s rule]] about specificity
* [[Hulme’s principle]] of literary warrant (1911)
* Principle of organizing from the general to the specific

Today, after more than 100 years of research and development in LIS, the “traditional” approach still has a strong position in KO and in many ways its principles still dominate.

===Facet analytic approaches===
The date of the foundation of this approach may be chosen as the publication of [[S. R. Ranganathan]]’s [[Colon classification|Colon Classification]] in 1933. The approach has been further developed by, in particular, the British Classification Research Group.  In many ways this approach has dominated what might be termed “modern classification theory.” 

The best way to explain this approach is probably to explain its analytico-synthetic methodology. The meaning of the term “analysis” is: Breaking down each subject into its basic concepts. The meaning of the term synthesis is: Combining the relevant units and concepts to describe the subject matter of the information package in hand.

Given subjects (as they appear in, for example, book titles) are first analyzed into a few common categories, which are termed “facets”. Ranganathan proposed his PMEST formula: Personality, Matter, Energy, Space and Time:

*

===The information retrieval tradition (IR) ===
Important in the IR-tradition have been, among others, the Cranfield experiments, which were founded in the 1950s, and the TREC experiments ([[Text Retrieval Conference]]s) starting in 1992. It was the Cranfield experiments, which introduced the famous measures [[Precision and recall|“recall” and “precision”]] as evaluation criteria for systems efficiency. The Cranfield experiments found that classification systems like UDC and facet-analytic systems were less efficient compared to free-text searches or low level indexing systems (“UNITERM”). The Cranfield I test found according to Ellis (1996, 3–6) the following results. 

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!system
!recall
|-
|UNITERM
|82,0%
|-
| Alphabetical [[subject heading]]s
| 81,5% 
|-
|UDC
|75,6%
|-
|Facet classification scheme
|73,8%
|}

Although these results have been criticized and questioned, the IR-tradition became much more influential while library classification research lost influence. The dominant trend has been to regard only [[statistical average]]s. What has largely been neglected is to ask: Are there certain kinds of questions in relation to which other kinds of representation, for example, controlled vocabularies, may improve recall and precision?

===User-oriented and cognitive views ===
The best way to define this approach is probably by method: Systems based upon user-oriented approaches must specify how the design of a system is made on the basis of empirical studies of users.  

User studies demonstrated very early that users prefer verbal search systems as opposed to systems based on classification notations. This is one example of a principle derived from empirical studies of users. Adherents of classification notations may, of course, still have an argument: That notations are well-defined and that users may miss important information by not considering them. 

[[Folksonomy|Folksonomies]] is a recent kind of KO based on users' rather than on librarians' or subject specialists' indexing.

===Bibliometric approaches===
These approaches are primarily based on using bibliographical references to organize networks of papers, mainly by bibliographic coupling (introduced by Kessler 1963) or co-citation analysis ( independently suggested by Marshakova 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=System of Document Connections Based on References|url=http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/marshakova/marshakovanauchtechn1973.pdf|journal=Nauchn-Techn.Inform.|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Small 1973). In recent years it has become a popular activity to construe bibliometric maps as structures of research fields. 

Two considerations are important in considering bibliometric approaches to KO: 

# The level of indexing depth is partly determined by the number of terms assigned to each document. In citation indexing this corresponds to the number of references in a given paper. On the average, scientific papers contain 10–15 references, which provide quite a high level of depth. 
# The references, which function as access points, are provided by the highest subject-expertise: The experts writing in the leading journals. This expertise is much higher than that which library catalogs or bibliographical databases typically are able to draw on.

===The domain analytic approach===
Domain analysis is a sociological-epistemological standpoint. The indexing of a given document should reflect the needs of a given group of users or a given ideal purpose. In other words, any description or representation of a given document is more or less suited to the fulfillment of certain tasks. A description is never objective or neutral, and the goal is not to standardize descriptions or make one description once and for all for different target groups. 

The development of the Danish library “[[KVINFO]]” may serve as an example that explains the domain-analytic point of view. 

KVINFO was founded by the librarian and writer Nynne Koch and its history goes back to 1965. Nynne Koch was employed at the Royal Library in Copenhagen in a position without influence on book selection. She was interested in women’s’ studies and began personally to collect printed catalog cards of books in the Royal Library, which were considered relevant for women’s studies. She developed a classification system for this subject. Later she became the head of KVINFO and got a budget for buying books and journals, and still later, KVINFO became an independent library. The important theoretical point of view is that the Royal Library had an official systematic catalog of a high standard. Normally it is assumed that such a catalog is able to identify relevant books for users whatever their theoretical orientation. This example demonstrates, however, that for a specific user group (feminist scholars), an alternative way of organizing catalog cards was important. In other words: Different points of view need different systems of organization. 

DA is the only approach to KO which has seriously examined epistemological issues in the field, i.e. comparing the assumptions made in different approaches to KO and examining the questions regarding subjectivity and objectivity in KO. Subjectivity is not just about individual differences. Such differences are of minor interest because they cannot be used as guidelines for KO. What seems important are collective views shared by many users. A kind of subjectivity about many users is related to philosophical positions. In any field of knowledge different views are always at play. In arts, for example, different views of art are always present. Such views determine views on art works, writing on art works, how art works are organized in exhibitions and how writings on art are organized in libraries (see Ørom 2003). In general it can be stated that different philosophical positions on any issue have implications for relevance criteria, information needs and for criteria of organizing knowledge.

'''Ksenija Atanasijević''' (1894–1981) was the first recognised major female [[Serbia]]n [[philosopher]], and one of the first female professors of [[Belgrade University]], where she graduated. She wrote about [[Giordano Bruno]], [[ancient Greek philosophy]] and the history of Serbian philosophy,&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book | title=Routledge encyclopedia of philosophy |page=51 |editor=Edward Craig |publisher=Taylor and Francis |year=1998 |isbn=0-415-07310-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and translated some of the most important philosophical works into the [[Serbian language]], including works by [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]. She was also an early Serbian [[feminist]] writer and philosopher.

== Biography ==
Ksenija Atanasijević was born on February 5, 1894 in [[Belgrade]], the youngest of six children to Doctor Svetozar Atanasijević and Jelena Atanasijević, née Čumić, who died while giving her birth. Her father was a well-respected doctor and director of the State Hospital in Belgrade. Her mother's family was related to the famed Belgrade lawyer, writer and politician Aćim Čumić. Twelve years later, her father died. Ksenija's stepmother, Sofija Kondić, who taught at the Women's College (''Viša ženska škola'') in Belgrade, became her rightful guardian. Kondić was well-qualified to continue Ksenija's education. From Kondić Ksenija received her first lessons in philosophy: she learned quickly and eagerly, and no sooner another tragedy befall on her. Ksenija's older brother was killed in World War I.

Ksenija's best friends while growing up were poet [[Rastko Petrović]] and his sister, painter [[Nadežda Petrović]].

=== Scholarship ===

While Ksenija attended the Lyceum, she was also influenced by Nada Stoiljković, her philosophy professor. Stoiljković suggested that Ksenija should take up philosophy with her former professor at Belgrade, [[Branislav Petronijević]], and so, in the autumn of 1918, Ksenija Atanasijevic became Petronijevic's pupil at the University of Belgrade.

Authoritarian and demanding, Petronijević was exactly what Ksenija needed at that point. A brilliant professor and one of the most famous philosophers of his day in Serbia and elsewhere, he was a hard taskmaster.

Petronijević's aim was to challenge his pupils to be able to maintain a philosophical discussion with their tutor. Ksenija was one of the most brilliant students ever to attend the university and it was not long before she attracted the attention of Belgrade's most distinguished intellectuals. She graduated in July 1920 with the highest marks in her graduating class, obtaining a university diploma in "pure and applied philosophy and classics." An excellent student, she decided to pursue an academic career in philosophy and soon after graduation, began working on a doctoral thesis on [[Giordano Bruno]]'s ''De triplici minimo''. She went to Geneva and Paris to seek out rare philosophical works and to discuss her thesis with specialists in the field, and on January 20, 1922, defended her Ph.D with honors in Belgrade before a panel of academics, including rector [[Jovan Cvijić]], [[Mihailo Petrović]], [[Milutin Milanković]], [[Veselin Čajkanović]], and [[Branislav Petronijević]], her mentor. After her thesis was successfully defended, she became the first woman to hold a Ph.D. in Philosophy in Serbia. She was then 28 years old.

=== Recognition ===

In 1924, she became the first female university professor to be appointed to the Arts Faculty, Department of Philosophy at the University of Belgrade, where she taught classics, medieval and modern philosophy and aesthetics for twelve years.

During her teaching career, she was a committed feminist both in theory and practice. She was a member of the Serbian Women's League for Peace and Freedom, the Women's Movement Alliance, and editor of the first feminist journal in the country, "The Women's Movement" (''Ženski pokret''), published from 1920 to 1938.

In 1936, she was removed from her university position on trumped-up charges of plagiarism because some of her male colleagues who worked alongside her felt threatened by her exceptional abilities. It was the result of a reaction to the liberal ideas she espoused and promoted and especially to her decision not to become part of an entirely male-dominated, academic ideological clique. Her sense of intellectual autonomy meant that not only was she unwilling to accept conservative ideologies structuring her teaching and writing, she was also capable of criticizing the work of her peers. At the time the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' cited her study, ''The Metaphysical and Geometrical Doctrine of Bruno'', written in French in Paris in 1924 as an authoritative work about an important and often neglected aspect of Bruno's philosophy. Her consequent dismissal caused a considerably outcry in Belgrade among intellectuals. At a public meeting where many people spoke in support of her, the most prominent speakers were law professor Živojin M. Perić and poets [[Rastko Petrović]] and [[Sima Pandurović]].

=== Atanasijević's life 1936&amp;ndash;1946 ===

Pandurović, who stood by her throughout the ordeal, was quoted in a newspaper article saying: "She has been accused at the plenum of the University Council of plagiarism by one member of the faculty who has not the remotest inkling of philosophy and who has unaccountably taken it on himself to defend that discipline from a genuine thinker."

Despite the support Atanasijević received, however, her position at the university was never restored to her, and she spent the rest of her working life—until 1941—as an inspector for the Ministry of Education. World War II brought troubles and unrest, even for the apolitical Ksenija Atanasijević. After writing articles against anti-Semitism and National Socialism, she was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] in 1942.  Then when the war ended, Atansijević was arrested again, but this time by Tito's communists on charges of war crimes, like those attributed to [[Veselin Čajkanović]] and others for teaching during [[Nazi]] occupation. Once released, she retired in 1946 after a short stint as an employee of the [[National Library of Serbia]].

== Legacy ==

Ksenija Atansijević left a substantial volume of work, including more than 400 texts, among them books and essays in philosophy, psychology, history, and literature. Her interest in philosophy was broad and eclectic, covering [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], [[aesthetics]] and the [[history of philosophy]]. She is best known for her original interpretations of Giordano Bruno's work and for her 'philosophy of meaning' developed in ''Filozofski fragmenti'' (Philosophical fragments, 1928–1929), considered by many to be her most important and significant work. She died in Belgrade in 1981.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1746">'''Legal moralism''' is the [[theory]] of [[jurisprudence]] and the [[philosophy of law]] which holds that laws may be used to prohibit or require behavior based on [[society]]'s collective judgment of whether it is [[morality|moral]].

"'''Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness'''" is a well-known phrase in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref name="DOIdraft"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/rough.htm |title=The Declaration of Independence: Rough Draft |publisher=USHistory.org |accessdate=May 18, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330160602/http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/rough.htm |archivedate=March 30, 2014 |df= }} Scanned image of the Jefferson's "original Rough draught" of the Declaration of Independence, written in June 1776, including all the changes made later by John Adams, Benjamin Franklin and other members of the committee, and by Congress.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase gives three examples of the "[[unalienable rights]]" which the Declaration says have been given to all humans by their creator.

== Origin and phrasing ==
The [[United States Declaration of Independence]] was drafted by [[Thomas Jefferson]], and then edited by the [[Committee of Five]], which consisted of Jefferson, [[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Roger Sherman]], and [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert Livingston]]. It was then further edited and adopted by the [[Committee of the Whole]] of the [[Second Continental Congress]] on July 4, 1776.&lt;ref name="Rakove2009-722"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Annotated U.S. Constitution and Declaration of Independence |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |first=Jack N. |last=Rakove |authorlink=Jack N. Rakove |pages=7–22 |year=2009 |isbn=0674036069}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dube1996"&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/dube/inde2.htm |chapter=The Declaration of Independence |title=A Multitude of Amendments, Alterations and Additions |publisher=U.S. National Park Service |location=Pennsylvania |first=Ann Marie |last=Dube |date=May 1996 |oclc=44638441}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second paragraph of the first article in the Declaration of Independence contains the phrase  "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness".

Jefferson's "original Rough draught" is on exhibit in the Library of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/trt001.html |title=We Hold These Truths To Be Self Evident... |publisher=U.S. Library of Congress |accessdate=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version was used by [[Julian P. Boyd|Julian Boyd]] to create a transcript of Jefferson's draft,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Papers of Thomas Jefferson. Volume 1: 1760–1776 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |editor-first=Julian P. |editor-last=Boyd |year=1950 |pages=243–47 |oclc=16353926}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reads:

{{quote|We hold these truths to be sacred &amp; undeniable; that all men are created equal &amp; independent, that from that equal creation they derive rights inherent &amp; inalienable, among which are the preservation of life, &amp; liberty, &amp; the pursuit of happiness; ...}}

The Committee of Five edited Jefferson's draft.  Their version survived further edits by the whole Congress intact, and reads:&lt;ref name="doi"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html |title=Declaration of Independence |publisher=U.S. National Archives |accessdate=May 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We hold these truths to be self-evident, that [[all men are created equal]], that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. ——}}

A number of possible sources or inspirations for Jefferson's use of the phrase in the Declaration of Independence have been identified, although scholars debate the extent to which any one of them actually influenced Jefferson. Jefferson declared himself an [[Epicurean]] during his lifetime: this is a philosophical doctrine that teaches the pursuit of happiness, here meaning "prosperity, thriving, wellbeing"&lt;ref name="guardian20160917"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/17/american-dream-divided-nation-equal-opportunity-trump-clinton-campaign |title=Two American Dreams: how a dumbed-down nation lost sight of a great idea |work=The Guardian |first=Ben |last=Fountain |date=September 17, 2016 |accessdate=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gettys20160704"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cupola.gettysburg.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1074&amp;context=histfac |title=What About That Pursuit of Happiness? |publisher=Philly.com ''via'' Gettysburg College |first=Timothy J. |last=Shannon |date=July 4, 2016 |accessdate=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proposes [[autarchy]], which translates as self-rule, self-sufficiency or freedom. The greatest disagreement comes between those who suggest the phrase was drawn from [[John Locke]] and those who identify some other source.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

=== Lockean roots hypothesis ===
In 1689, Locke argued in his ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' that political society existed for the sake of protecting "property", which he defined as a person's "life, liberty, and estate".&lt;ref name="Locke-Laslett1988"&gt;{{cite book |title=Two Treatises of Government |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, NY |first=John |last=Locke |authorlink=John Locke |editor-first=Peter |editor-last=Laslett |at=Sec. 87, 123, 209, 222 |year=1988 |origyear=1689 |isbn=052135448X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[A Letter Concerning Toleration]]'', he wrote that the magistrate's power was limited to preserving a person's "civil interest", which he described as "life, liberty, health, and indolency of body; and the possession of outward things".&lt;ref name="Locke-Tully1983"&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Letter Concerning Toleration |publisher=Hackett Publishing |location=Indianapolis, IN |first=John |last=Locke |authorlink=John Locke |editor-first=James H. |editor-last=Tully |page=26 |year=1983 |origyear=1689 |isbn=091514560X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He declared in his ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' that "the highest perfection of intellectual nature lies in a careful and constant pursuit of true and solid happiness".&lt;ref name="Locke-Nidditch1975"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Essay Concerning Human Understanding |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford, UK |first=John |last=Locke |authorlink=John Locke |editor-first=Peter H. |editor-last=Nidditch |at=Book 2, Chapter 21, Section 51 |year=1975 |origyear=1689 |isbn=0198245955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to those scholars who saw the root of Jefferson's thought in Locke's doctrine, Jefferson replaced "estate" with "the pursuit of happiness", although this does not mean that Jefferson meant the "pursuit of happiness" to refer primarily or exclusively to property. Under such an assumption, the Declaration of Independence would declare that government existed primarily for the reasons Locke gave, and some have extended that line of thinking to support a conception of [[limited government]].&lt;ref name="Zuckert1996"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Natural Rights Republic |publisher=University of Notre Dame Press |location=Notre Dame, IN |first=Michael P. |last=Zuckert |pages=73–85 |year=1996 |isbn=0268014809}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Corbett2009"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Lockean Commonwealth |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany, NY |first=Ross J. |last=Corbett |year=2009 |isbn=1438427948}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pangle1988"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Spirit of Modern Republicanism |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, IL |first=Thomas L. |last=Pangle |authorlink=Thomas Pangle |year=1988 |isbn=0226645401}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gibson2009"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Interpreting the Founding |publisher=University Press of Kansas |location=Lawrence, KS |first=Alan |last=Gibson |edition=2nd |year=2009 |isbn=0700617051}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rahe1994"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Republics Ancient &amp; Modern, Volume 3; Inventions of Prudence: Constituting the American Regime |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |location=Chapel Hill, NC |first=Paul A. |last=Rahe |pages=13–19 |year=1994 |origyear=1992 |isbn=080784473X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Virginia Declaration of Rights ===
The first and second article of the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]],  written by [[George Mason]] and adopted unanimously by the [[Fifth Virginia Convention|Virginia Convention of Delegates]] on June 12, 1776, speaks of happiness in the context of recognizably Lockean rights and is paradigmatic of the way in which "the fundamental natural rights of mankind" were expressed at the time.&lt;ref name="Rakove2009-78"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Annotated U.S. Constitution and Declaration of Independence |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, MA |first=Jack N. |last=Rakove |authorlink=Jack N.

{{quote|That all men are by nature equally free and independent and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a state of society, they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.|2=&lt;small&gt;[[Virginia Declaration of Rights]]&lt;ref name="vdor"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/virginia_declaration_of_rights.html |title=The Virginia Declaration of Rights |publisher=U.S. National Archives |accessdate=May 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt; }}

[[Benjamin Franklin]] was in agreement with [[Thomas Jefferson]] in downplaying protection of "property" as a goal of government.  It is noted that Franklin found property to be a "creature of society" and thus, he believed that it should be taxed as a way to finance civil society.&lt;ref name="Franklin-Skousen2006"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Compleated Autobiography |publisher=Regnery Publishing |location=Washington, D.C. |first=Benjamin |last=Franklin |authorlink=Benjamin Franklin |editor-first=Mark |editor-last=Skousen |page=413 |year=2006 |isbn=0-89526-033-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternative hypotheses ===
In 1628, Sir [[Edward Coke]] wrote in ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England|The First Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England]]'', his commentary on [[Thomas de Littleton]], that "It is commonly said that three things be favoured in Law, Life, Liberty, Dower."&lt;ref name="Coke1628"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/firstpartofinsti011628coke |title=The First Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England |publisher=Adam Islip |location=London |first=Edward |last=Coke |authorlink=Edward Coke |at=Section 193 |date=1628 |oclc=84760833}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[common law]], [[dower]] was closely guarded as a means by which the [[widow]] and orphan of a deceased landowner could keep their [[real property]].&lt;ref name="Whitehead1922"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQoaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA178&amp;lpg=PA178 |title=The Law of Real Property in Illinois |volume=1 |publisher=Burdette J.

[[Garry Wills]] has argued that Jefferson did not take the phrase from Locke and that it was indeed meant to be a standard by which governments should be judged.&lt;ref name="Wills2002"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Inventing America: Jefferson's Declaration of Independence |publisher=Mariner Books |location=New York, NY |first=Gary |last=Wills |year=2002 |origyear=1978 |isbn=978-0-618-25776-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wills suggests [[Adam Ferguson]] as a good guide to what Jefferson had in mind:

{{quote|If, in reality, courage and a heart devoted to the good of mankind are the constituents of human felicity, the kindness which is done infers a happiness in the person from whom it proceeds, not in him on whom it is bestowed; and the greatest good which men possessed of fortitude and generosity can procure to their fellow creatures is a participation of this happy character. If this be the good of the individual, it is likewise that of mankind; and virtue no longer imposes a task by which we are obliged to bestow upon others that good from which we ourselves refrain; but supposes, in the highest degree, as possessed by ourselves, that state of felicity which we are required to promote in the world.|[[Adam Ferguson]]|An Essay on the History of Civil Society&lt;ref name="Ferguson-Oz1995"&gt;{{cite book |title=An Essay on the History of Civil Society |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, NY |first=Adam |last=Ferguson |editor-first=Fania |editor-last=Oz-Salzberger |pages=99–100 |year=1995 |origyear=1767 |isbn=052144215X}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The 17th-century cleric and philosopher [[Richard Cumberland (philosopher)|Richard Cumberland]] wrote that promoting the well-being of our fellow humans is essential to the "pursuit of our own happiness".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/1353 |title=A Treatise of the Laws of Nature |publisher=Liberty Fund |location=Indianapolis, IN |first=Richard |last=Cumberland |pages=523–24 |year=2005 |origyear=1727 |isbn=0865974721}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Locke never associated [[natural rights]] with happiness, but his philosophical opponent [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] made such an association in the introduction to his ''Codex Iuris Gentium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Leibniz: Political Writings |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, NY |first=Gottfried Wilhelm |last=Leibniz |editor-first=Patrick |editor-last=Riley |edition=2nd |page=171 |year=1988 |isbn=0521353807}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Wollaston]]'s ''The Religion of Nature Delineated'' describes the "truest definition" of "natural religion" as being "''The pursuit of happiness'' by the practice of reason and truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r7gOAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=The Religion of Nature Delineated |publisher=Samuel Palmer |location=London |first=William |last=Wollaston |authorlink=William Wollaston |edition=8th |page=90 |year=1759 |origyear=1722 |oclc=2200588}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An English translation of [[Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui]]'s ''Principles of Natural and Politic Law'' prepared in 1763 extolled the "noble pursuit" of "true and solid happiness" in the opening chapter discussing natural rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/1717 |title=The Principles of Natural and Politic Law |publisher=Liberty Fund |location=Indianapolis, IN |first=Jean-Jacques |last=Burlamaqui |authorlink=Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui |page=31 |year=2006 |origyear=1747 |isbn=0865974969}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian [[Jack Rakove]] posits Burlamaqui as the inspiration for Jefferson's phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Revolutionaries: A New History of the Invention of America |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |location=Boston, MA |first=Jack N. |last=Rakove |authorlink=Jack N.

Another possible source for the phrase is in the ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' published by Sir [[William Blackstone]], from 1765 to 1769, which are often cited in the laws of the United States. Blackstone argues that God 'has so intimately connected, so inseparably interwoven the laws of eternal justice with the happiness of each individual, that the latter cannot be attained but by observing the former; and, if the former be punctually obeyed, it cannot but induce the latter. In consequence of which mutual connection of justice and human felicity, he has not perplexed the law of nature with a multitude of abstracted rules and precepts, referring merely to the fitness or unfitness of things, as some have vainly surmised; but has graciously reduced the rule of obedience to this one paternal precept, “that man should pursue his own true and substantial happiness.” This is the foundation of what we call ethics, or natural law.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |sectionurl=https://archive.org/stream/lawsofenglandc01blacuoft#page/40/mode/2up |section=Section the Second: Of the Nature of Laws in General |title=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]] |publisher=Clarendon Press |first=William |last=Blackstone |author-link=William Blackstone |pages=40-41 |year=1765 |oclc=65350522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparable mottos worldwide ==
Other [[tripartite motto]]s include "[[liberté, égalité, fraternité]]" (liberty, equality, fraternity) in France; "[[Deutschlandlied|Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit]]" (unity, justice and liberty) in Germany and "[[peace, order, and good government]]" in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Canadian Politics: Critical Approaches |publisher=Nelson Thomson Learning |location=Scarborough, ON |first=Perry Rand |last=Dyck |edition=3rd |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-17-616792-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also similar to a line in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights]]: "life, liberty, security of the person" (this line was also in the older Canadian Bill of rights, which added "enjoyment of property" to the list).

The phrase can also be found in Chapter III, Article 13 of the 1947 [[Constitution of Japan]], and in President [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s [[Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam|1945 declaration of independence]] of the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]. An alternative phrase "life, liberty, and property", is found in the [[Declaration of Colonial Rights]], a resolution of the [[First Continental Congress]]. The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the United States Constitution declare that governments cannot deprive any person of "life, liberty, or property" without [[due process]] of law. Also, Article 3 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] reads, "Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person".

'''The Metaphysical Society of America''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] organization founded by [[Paul Weiss (philosopher)|Paul Weiss]] in 1950. As stated in its constitution, "The purpose of the Metaphysical Society of America is the study of reality." The society is a member of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]].

== Early history and purpose==
In his opening address, "The Four-Fold Art of Avoiding Questions", Paul Weiss spoke of the need for a society that would reinvigorate philosophic inquiry.  He denounced "parochialism," referring to those who insisted upon "some one method, say that of pragmatism, instrumentalism, idealism, analysis, linguistics or logistics, and denied the importance of meaningfulness of anything which lies beyond its scope or power," as well as those who confined their studies to only some historic era.

Early in the history of the society, there was some dispute about whether certain schools of thought should be included in the program.  By the second meeting there was controversy regarding papers by logicians, a controversy possibly fueled by the dominance of [[positivism]] in that decade.  Before 1960, there had been some fear of admitting the existential metaphysics.  However, as Paul Weiss remarked in 1969, the society had succeeded in accomplishing metaphysical diversity: 
{{quote|Gradually and persistently, year after year, men of the most diverse backgrounds and commitments exhibited the strengths and weaknesses of their doctrines and methods. Every year, men from all over the United States met to engage in original and historic studies of basic questions regarding the nature of knowledge and reality.}}

A book on the history of the society, ''[http://www.rodopi.nl/functions/search.asp?BookId=VIBS+272 Being in America: Sixty Years of the Metaphysical Society]'', was published by [[Rodopi (publisher)|Rodopi]] in 2014 in its [[Histories and Addresses of Philosophical Societies|Histories and Addresses of Philosophical Societies Series]].

'''Natural design''' is an approach to [[psychology]] and [[biology]] that holds that concepts such as "motivation", "emotion", "inner feeling", "development", "adaptation" refer not to down-reductive explanations of things but to up-reductive descriptions of patterns of which those things are part. It has its roots in philosophical behaviorism and the [[new realism]]. It also refers to an holistic approach to Design called for by Prof David W. Orr (Professor of Environmental Studies and Politics, Oberlin College USA) &lt;ref&gt;David W. Orr, (2002) "The Nature of Design: Ecology, Culture, and Human Intention". Oxford University Press, USA&lt;/ref&gt;  and developed for research practice by Prof Seaton Baxter (Emeritus Professor for the Study of Natural Design, [[Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design]], [[University of Dundee]]). &lt;ref&gt;Baxter, S. (2006), The Way to Natural Design: Learning to see and Confront the Bigger Design Questions, Enhancing Curricula, 3rd International CLTAD Conference, 6-7 April ‘06, Lisbon, Portugal.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Natural design has attribution to the process of natural selection. All species have been designed based on their life situation in order to have more offspring. This resulted as only better designed organisms can be found today because natural selection is only limited by the rapidity of environment change and the capacity of the genes to generate variation. Moreover, the theory of evolution by natural selection can some how explain the behavior of animals.&lt;ref&gt;N.S. Thompson, (1987) '''Natural Design and the Future of Comparative Psychology'''. ''Journal of Comparative Psychology. 101, 282-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studying of behavior==

Darwinism, psychologist who studies in behavior, stated two consequences of studying behavior.

#Conceptual consequence of breaking the mind and design. The presence of design was no longer evidence of an intending mind if Darwinism was correct. Therefore, design could exist by itself.

#Break down of the dualism and the partition that hitherto had existed between psychology and biology. Each discipline now could explain the preferred domain of the other such as instinct and natural selection can be used to human behavior and intentions are able to explain animal behavior.

These two results provided two competing systems for study of behavior and evolved into ethology and further evolved into comparative psychology.&lt;ref&gt;N.T. Thompson, (1987) '''Natural Design and the Future of Comparative Psychology'''. ''Journal of Comparative Psychology. 101, 282-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Summulae logicales.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece of work by Peter of Spain]]
__NOTOC__
'''Peter of Spain''' ({{lang-la|Petrus Hispanus}}; [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and {{lang-es|Pedro Hispano}}; {{floruit|13th}} century) was the author of the ''{{lang|la|Tractatus}}'', later known as the ''{{lang|la|Summulae Logicales}}'', an important [[medieval]] [[medieval university|university]] textbook on [[Aristotelian logic]]. As the Latin ''[[Hispania]]'' was considered to include the entire [[Iberian peninsula]], he is traditionally and usually identified with the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] scholar and ecclesiastic Peter Juliani, who was elected [[Pope John XXI]] in 1276.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Haren, ''Medieval Thought'' (1985), p.148.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a more recent defense of the identity between Petrus Hispanus and Pope John XXI, see the preface of W. Degen and B Bapst (2006), ''Logische Abhandlungen'', Munich.&lt;/ref&gt; The identification is sometimes disputed, usually by [[Spanish people|Spanish]] authors, who claim the author of the ''{{lang|la|Tractatus}}'' was a [[Castilian people|Castilian]] [[Dominican Order|Blackfriar]]. He is also sometimes identified as [[Petrus Ferrandi Hispanus]] ({{abbr|d.|died}} 1254&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|x|sometime between}} 1259).

==Life==
{{see also|Pope John XXI}}
The author of the ''{{lang|la|Tractatus}}'' is assumed to have studied under [[John Pagus]].

==Philosophical works==
There are a large volume of manuscripts and printed editions of the ''{{lang|la|Summulae Logicales}}'', indicative of its great success throughout [[Europe]]an universities well into the seventeenth century. The most recent edition is Peter of Spain (Petrus Hispanus Portugalensis), ''Tractatus called afterwards Summule Logicales'', edited by Lambertus Marie de Rijk, Wijsgerige Teksten en Studies 22 (Assen: Van Gorcum, 1972). A later logical work of his is, in the most recent edition, Peter of Spain (Petrus Hispanus Portugalensis), ''Syncategoreumata'', edited by Lambertus Marie de Rijk and translated by Joke Spruyt, Studien und Text zur Geistesgeschichte des Mittelalters 30 (New York: E. J. Brill, 1992).

Peter of Spain supported an investigation of teaching at the [[University of Paris]] which resulted in the [[bishop of Paris|Parisian bishop]]'s [[Condemnation of 1277]], which denounced Aristotelian propositions which conflicted with [[dogma|church doctrine]].&lt;ref&gt;Principe, Lawrence M. (2002) History of Science: Antiquity to 1700. Lecture 19. The Teaching Company, Chantilly, VA)&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Dialectica est ars artium, scientia scientiarum, ad omnium methodorum principia viam habens; sola enim dialectica probabiliter disputat de principiis omnium aliarum scientiarum, et ideo in acquisitione omnium aliarum scientiarum dialectica debet esse prior.'' "Dialectic [that is, logic, in Peter's terminology] is the art of arts, science of sciences, having the way to the principles of all methods; for in fact dialectic alone credibly argues about the principles of all other sciences, and therefore in [one's] acquisition (learning) of all other sciences dialectic must be prior." — Peter of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;As quoted, for instance, in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=etJhAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA131 Papst Johannes XXI]'' by Stapper, Richard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=etJhAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA5&amp;dq=est+ars+artium p. 5], collected in ''Kirchengeschichtliche Studien'' v. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical works==
[[File:Thesaurus pauperum V00179 00000004.tif|thumb|''Thesaurus pauperum'']]
A Petrus Hispanus, usually identified as the same scholar,&lt;ref&gt;Spruyt, Joke (2001), "Peter of Spain", ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Revised 2007. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/peter-spain/ Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; was also credited as the author of a ''Commentary on Isaac'', one of the foundational texts of [[clinical pharmacology]]. A Pedro Hispano was also credited with the ''Treasury of the Poor'' (''{{lang|la|Thesaurus Pauperum}}''), a comprehensive recipe book for contraception and inducement of menstruation. Many of Peter’s recipes have been found to be surprisingly effective by contemporary research, and it is believed that women in antiquity had more control over their reproduction than previously believed.&lt;ref&gt;John M.

A '''polychotomy''' (päl′i kät′ə mē; plural ''polychotomies'') is a division or separation into many parts or classes. Polychotomy is a generalization of [[dichotomy]], which is a polychotomy of exactly two parts.  In [[evolutionary biology]], the term '''polychotomy''' can also be considered a historically based misspelling of [[polytomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, David J. (1995). “Polychtomous or Polytomous?,” Applied Psychological Measurement, Vol. 19, No. 1, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quentin Meillassoux''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|eɪ|ə|ˈ|s|uː}}; {{IPA-fr|mɛjasu|lang}}) is a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]]. He teaches at the [[Pantheon-Sorbonne University|Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne]], and is the son of the anthropologist [[Claude Meillassoux]].

==Biography==
Meillassoux is a former student of the philosophers {{ill|Bernard Bourgeois|fr}} and [[Alain Badiou]]. Badiou, who wrote the foreword for Meillassoux's first book ''After Finitude'' (''Après la finitude'', 2006),&lt;ref&gt;''Après la finitude. Essai sur la nécessité de la contingence'', Paris, Seuil, coll. L'ordre philosophique, 2006 (foreword by Alain Badiou).&lt;/ref&gt; describes the work as introducing an entirely new option into modern philosophy, one that differs from [[Immanuel Kant]]'s three alternatives of [[criticism]], [[skepticism]], and [[dogmatism]].&lt;ref&gt;''After Finitude'', trans. Ray Brassier, Continuum, 2008, foreword, p. vii&lt;/ref&gt; The book was translated into English by philosopher [[Ray Brassier]]. Meillassoux is associated with the [[speculative realism]] movement.

In this book, Meillassoux argues that [[post-Kantian philosophy]] is dominated by what he calls "correlationism," the often unstated theory that humans cannot exist without the world nor the world without humans.&lt;ref&gt;''After Finitude'', Chap. 1, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In Meillassoux's view, this is a dishonest maneuver that allows philosophy to sidestep the problem of how to describe the world as it really is prior to all human access. He terms this pre-human reality the "ancestral" realm.&lt;ref&gt;''After Finitude'', Chap. 1, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with the mathematical interests of his mentor Alain Badiou, Meillassoux claims that mathematics is what reaches the primary qualities of things as opposed to their [[Primary/secondary quality distinction|secondary qualities]] as manifested in perception.

Meillassoux tries to show that the agnostic scepticism of those who doubt the reality of cause and effect must be transformed into a radical certainty that there is no such thing as causal necessity at all. This leads Meillassoux to proclaim that it is absolutely necessary that the laws of nature be contingent. The world is a kind of hyper-chaos in which the [[principle of sufficient reason]] is abandoned even while the [[Law of noncontradiction|principle of non-contradiction]] must be retained.

For these reasons, Meillassoux rejects [[Copernican Revolution (metaphor)|Kant's so-called Copernican Revolution]] in philosophy. Since Kant makes the world dependent on the conditions by which humans observe it, Meillassoux accuses Kant of a "Ptolemaic Counter-Revolution."

Several of Meillassoux's articles have appeared in English via the British philosophical journal ''[[Collapse (journal)|Collapse]]'', helping to spark interest in his work in the Anglophone world. His unpublished dissertation ''L'inexistence divine'' (1997) is forthcoming in book form.&lt;ref&gt;''After Finitude'', Bibliography, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Meillassoux's book on [[Stéphane Mallarmé]] was published in France under the title ''Le nombre et la sirène. Un déchiffrage du coup de dés de Mallarmé''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.fr/nombre-sir%C3%A8ne-Quentin-Meillassoux/dp/2213665915 |title=Le nombre et la sirène |publisher=Amazon.fr |date= |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this second book, he offers a detailed reading of Mallarmé's famous poem "[[Un coup de dés jamais n'abolira le hasard]]" ("A Throw of the Dice Will Never Abolish Chance"), in which he finds a numerical code at work in the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doctorzamalek2.wordpress.com/2011/09/24/meillassoux-on-mallarme-first-half|title=Graham Harman (website), Meillassoux on Mallarmé|date= |accessdate=2011-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meillassoux clarified and revised some of the views exposed in ''After Finitude'' during  his lectures at the [[Free University of Berlin]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oursecretblog.com/txt/QMpaperApr12.pdf Iteration, Reiteration, Repetition: A speculative analysis of the meaningless sign] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019050909/http://oursecretblog.com/txt/QMpaperApr12.pdf |date=October 19, 2013 }} Freie Universitat Berlin, April 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Socialist Party of Senegal''' (''Parti Socialiste du Sénégal'', PS) is a [[political party]] in [[Senegal]]. It was the ruling party in [[Senegal]] from independence in 1960 until 2000. [[Ousmane Tanor Dieng]] has been the First Secretary of the party since 1996. The best-known figure of the PS was [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]], the first President of Senegal.

In the [[Senegalese presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], the party's candidate, long-time president [[Abdou Diouf]], was defeated by the leader of the [[Senegalese Democratic Party]], [[Abdoulaye Wade]], in a second round of voting. Diouf received the most votes, 41.3%, in the first round, but in the second round he received only 41.51% against Wade.&lt;ref name=DB&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/sn.html Elections in Senegal], African Elections Database.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Senegalese parliamentary election, 2001|parliamentary election]] held on 29 April 2001, the party won 17.4% of the popular vote and 10 out of 120 seats.&lt;ref name=DB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/2277_01.htm 2001 parliamentary election], IPU PARLINE.&lt;/ref&gt; Tanor Dieng was the party's candidate in the [[Senegalese presidential election, 2007|February 2007 presidential election]]; he took third place with 13.56% of the vote.&lt;ref name=Final&gt;[http://www.seneweb.com/news/elections2007/article.php?artid=9107 "Le texte intégral de la décision du Conseil constitutionnel"], Agence de Presse Sénégalaise (Seneweb.com), March 11, 2007 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The party participated in a boycott of the [[Senegalese parliamentary election, 2007|June 2007 parliamentary election]].

The Socialist Party is a full member of the [[Socialist International]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialistinternational.org/viewArticle.cfm?ArticlePageID=931 List of Socialist International member parties].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political history ==
The Socialist Party of Senegal was first created in 1958 right before Senegal gained independence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kanté|first=Babacar|date=1994|title=Senegal's Empty Elections|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/225418|journal=Journal of Democracy|language=en|volume=5|issue=1|pages=96–108|doi=10.1353/jod.1994.0007|issn=1086-3214}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Party was founded by Leopold Sedar Senghor and it was in power under him politically from 1960 to 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=v2-FAgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=leopold+sedar+senghor&amp;ots=daNHO1i50J&amp;sig=TESDlCsR6_aILe4ojCpn5IsOhg0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Pan-African History: Political Figures from Africa and the Diaspora Since 1787|last=Adi|first=Hakim|last2=Sherwood|first2=Marika|date=2003-12-16|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134689330|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Socialist Party of Senegal was initially known as the Senegalese Progressive Union (UPS).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Senghor had founded the Senegalese Democratic Bloc in 1948 and in 1958 it merged with another political party to become the UPS.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/senegal-1974-present/|title=Senegal: 1974-present {{!}} ICNC|work=ICNC|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The UPS became the ruling party of Senegal in 1960 once independence was gained.  The UPS officially was known as the Socialist Party of Senegal starting in 1976.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

When Senegal gained independence in 1960, Senghor was unanimously elected president.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In the early 1960s, there was a personal and political rivalry between President Senghor and Prime Minister Mamadoua Dia.  In 1962, there was a coup attempt.  Dia accept blame and was sent to prison as a result.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1963 Senghor ran unopposed for president and consequently won.  By 1966, Senegal could be considered a one-party state.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This occurred because Senghor was running unopposed as president and the economic stability of Senegal began to fade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mbow|first=Penda|date=2008|title=Senegal: The Return of Personalism|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/230464|journal=Journal of Democracy|language=en|volume=19|issue=1|pages=156–169|doi=10.1353/jod.2008.0013|issn=1086-3214}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Senegal relied heavily on peanut-farming and this source of economic stability was in decline.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Single-party rule prevented an overwhelming economic crisis and ensured social stability in Senegal, which was appealing to people in the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Leopold Sedar Senghor voluntarily resigned from position of president in 1980 and Abdou Diouf came into power as Senghor's hand-picked successor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the 2000 presidential election, the Socialist Party of Senegal was defeated and no longer the ruling party for the first time in 40 years.  Abdou Diouf, the 19-year incumbent of the Social Party, was defeated by Abdoulaye Wade.  The removal of Diouf from office by an election broke the political monopoly the Socialist Party had on Senegal and helped establish Senegal as one of the African countries with the most advanced democracies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5133">The '''stemma codicum of  [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's Metaphysics]]''' is a visual representation with the shape  of a  family tree, which is the standard one in '''[[stemmatics]]'''. It is meant to show the relationships of the surviving manuscripts  of the Greek text, with special reference to those which are to be taken into account for a [[critical edition]], hence for translations in modern languages, for commentaries, and for any other kind of scholarly reference to the text of the Metaphysics. It is partly conjectural by its own nature and it is an object of lively debate, since these latest years especially. 
The main controversial question the stemma is meant to answer is the role of the so called beta group of manuscripts of the [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]], described as a separate beta branch in the stemma. Special focus is on manuscript Ab (Laur. 87.12), as opposed  to the alpha group of manuscripts (which forms the main part of the tree) and especially to its oldest representative, namely J (Wien Phil. Gr. 100) and E (Paris. Gr. 1853).&lt;ref&gt;S. Fazzo, "Lo stemma codicum della Metafisica di Aristotele",  ''Revue d'Histoire des Textes'', XII, 2017, pp. 35-58&lt;/ref&gt;
The first partial draft of a stemma, including Ab, E, J, has been produced  by [[Alfred Gercke]] in 1892&lt;ref&gt;A. Gercke, "Aristoteleum", in ''Wiener Studien'', 14, 1892, p. 146-148.&lt;/ref&gt;.
On this basis, 20th century editors, William David Ross (1924) and Werner Jaeger (1957), have taken into account eclectically Ab in the one side and J and E on the other.

Different versions of the stemma codicum of the ''Metaphysics'' have been proposed since 1970&lt;ref&gt;Silvio Bernardinello, ''Eliminatio Codicum della Metafisica di Aristotele'', Padova, Antenore 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;
, most remarkably by Dieter Harlfinger in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;D. Harlfinger, "Zür Überlieferungsgeschichte der Metaphysik", in P. Aubenque, ''Essais sur la Métaphysique d'Aristote'', Paris, Vrin 1979, pp. 7-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Harlfinger’s stemma, current 20th century editions of the ''Metaphysics'' (Ross, Jaeger) rely on the most valuable manuscripts for most of the fourteen  books, except for the last ones: starting from the final part of the 12th book, they should not have used Ab, but other beta manuscripts instead (M, C), which form no longer a unified group with Ab.

In 2010 Silvia Fazzo suggested a revision of Harlfinger’s stemma according to which manuscript Ab should not be followed in the whole of book 12 either, nor in the final part of book 11. She showed that starting from book 11 chapter 8 already Harlfinger’s supposed beta manuscripts Ab, M, C do not form any unified group.&lt;ref&gt;S. Fazzo, "Lo stemma codicum della Metafisica di Aristotele", ''cit.''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Pantelis Golitsis replied to Fazzo’s revision showing that starting from book 11 chapter 8 manuscripts M and C can not be regarded as representative of a separate beta branch. Based on unpublished new collations funded by the DFG, Golitsis shows that M and C are heavily collated (others would say ‘contaminated’ in this case) with various sources including late manuscripts of the  alpha group (when this kind of collation is concerned, Golitsis argues that the idea of contamination should be left aside and rejected).  He then submitted a revised version of Harlfinger’s stemma codicum.&lt;ref&gt;P. Golitsis, "Editing Aristotle’s Metaphysics: A Response to Silvia Fazzo’s Critical Appraisal of Oliver Primavesi’s Edition of Metaphysics Alpha", ''Archiv für Geschichte der Philosophie'', 98 (2016), 458-473.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Fazzo further argued that neither Ab nor its cognate manuscripts M and C should be followed at all as long as the reading of J and E is not proved to be corrupt. Based on published and available materials she submitted a different stemma where all manuscripts ultimately stem from a unique source, possibly archetype Π from which manuscripts J and E are directly derived. As a consequence, a critical editor is left with manuscripts J and E as the most reliable basis.&lt;ref&gt;S. Fazzo, "Verso una nuova editio minor della Metafisica di Aristotele", ''Chora. Revue d’Etudes Anciennes'', XIII, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 Fazzo submitted her stemma to discussion in the ''Revue d’Histoire des Textes'', prefaced with a general history of the stemma codicum of the Metaphysics. There she agrees with Golitsis vs. Harlfinger that manuscripts M and C should not be regarded as representative of an independent beta source for the final books of the Metaphysics. Moreover, Fazzo argues that the bifid shape of 20th century proposals concerning the stemma codicum heavily depends on the implicit acceptance of Jaeger's genetic views as applied to the manuscripts tradition of the ''Metaphysics''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4666">The '''TaKeTiNa Rhythm Process''', developed by Austrian percussionist [[Reinhard Flatischler]], is a musical, meditative group process for people who want to develop their awareness of [[rhythm]]. 
In a TaKeTiNa process, there are three different rhythmic layers—represented by the voice, claps, and steps—that continue simultaneously. Vocalization and clap rhythms, accompanied by the [[berimbau]], constantly change while the steps, supported by a [[surdo]] drum, remain the same. The surdo stabilizes the basic rhythm of the steps, while [[call-and-response]] singing serves to destabilize and re-stabilize the rhythmic movements. In this process, the simultaneity of stabilization and destabilization creates a disturbance that allows participants to repeatedly fall out, and then fall back into rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;Flatischler (1996), {{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4963">The '''Misanthropic Luciferian Order''' ('''MLO''') is an [[occult]] order founded in Sweden in 1995 and later renamed to '''Temple of the Black Light'''. 

The MLO released ''Liber Azerate'', a modern [[grimoire]] written by the order's Magister Templi [[Frater Nemidial]], in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.angelfire.com/extreme/slayermagazine/interview_mlo2.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on the internet in Swedish and Norwegian. Azerate is the hidden name of the "eleven anti-cosmic gods" described in the book. A related musical work is the 2006 [[Dissection (band)|Dissection]] album ''[[Reinkaos]]'', the lyrics of which were co-written by Frater Nemidial, and which album [[Jon Nödtveidt]] explained was "based on the book ''Liber Azerate'' and the teachings of MLO".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071221140152/http://www.dissection.nu/interviews/Interview2.htm ''Interview for the Fans by the Fans''. ''Final Interview with Jon Nödtveidt''], accessed on 22 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The MLO propagate "[[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]]-[[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] [[Satanism]]" or "Current 218".

==Beliefs==
The MLO consist of the unified belief in "Chaosophy". They believe that [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]] is an infinidimensional and pandimensional plane of possibilities, in contrast to [[cosmos]] which only has three spatial dimensions and one linear time dimension. They also believe that, in comparison with the linear time of cosmos, chaos can be described as timeless in the way that it is not contained nor limited by one-dimensional time, and formless, because of its ever-changing and infinite number of space dimensions.

Militant [[Gnosticism in modern times|neo-gnosticism]] and [[nihilism]] is taught within the group and they say that the true [[Satanism|Satanist]] must not be a part of the modern society, as it is founded upon lies. The very fabric of this reality is a lie that hinders chaos from realizing itself.

These are the three dark veils before [[Satan]], in their belief system seen as the three Forces that were expelled from [[Ein Sof|Ain Sof]] in order to make way for the manifestation of the Black Light in the Outer Darkness that soon became [[Qliphoth|Sitra Ahra]]:
*000 - [[Tohu wa-bohu|Tohu]] - Chaos: Qemetiel ("Crown of Gods")
*00 - Bohu - Emptiness: Beliaal ("Without God")
*0 - Chasek - Darkness: Aathiel ("Uncertainty")

These three powers can be seen as the Burning Trident held high above the [[Thaumiel|Thaumielitan]]. These three powers can also be viewed as Wrathful Reflections of Ain, Ain Soaf and Ain Soaf Aur.

==Criminal activities==
{{Main article|Keillers Park murder}}
In the summer of 1997, Josef Ben Meddour was murdered by members Jon Nödtveidt and his accomplice Vlad. This act was described by the police to be a homophobic hate crime. When Nödveidt and Vlad were arrested for the crime respectively on the 15th and 18th of December 1997, the police discovered satanic altars in the homes of the two suspects.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlin (2012), p. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; A human skull was also found at Vlad's place, for which he was charged with possession of human parts.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlin (2012), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the police, the cult never had more than a handful of followers.&lt;ref name=p13&gt;Ohlin (2012), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

During their investigations, the police interrogated former members of the MLO, who described the organisation and narrated the occult ceremonies they had attended. Rituals included meditation, invocations of demons and animal sacrifices – cats, which were bought through classified ads. During the weeks that preceded the murder of Josef ben Meddour, Vlad had been more and more extremist in his speech, and the idea of performing human sacrifices, followed by a mass suicide, was discussed at length. During a meeting at Nödtveidt's place, a list of possible victims was made. It included a former follower who had defected, band members from Dissection, and even Nödtveidt's girlfriend.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlin (2012), p. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

These plans led to the defection of some members of the MLO, who did not want to take part in any assassination, or who feared for their own lives. As a result, when the arrests were made, the number of active members was down to three: Nödtveidt, Vlad and his girlfriend.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlin (2012), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Nödtveidt committed suicide in a ritual.

'''Tychism''' ({{lang-el|τύχη|translation=chance}}) is a thesis proposed by the American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] that holds that absolute [[Chance (philosophy)|chance]], or [[indeterminism]], is a real factor operative in the universe. This doctrine forms a central part of Peirce's comprehensive evolutionary [[cosmology]]. It may be considered both the direct opposite of [[Einstein]]'s oft quoted dictum that: "[[God does not play dice]] with the universe" and an early philosophical anticipation of [[Werner Heisenberg]]'s [[uncertainty principle]].

{{quote|In an article published in ''The Monist'' for January, 1891, I endeavored to show what ideas ought to form the warp of a system of philosophy, and particularly emphasized that of absolute chance. In the number of April, 1892, I argued further in favor of that way of thinking, which it will be convenient to christen tychism (from ''tyché'', chance). A serious student of philosophy will be in no haste to accept or reject this doctrine; but he will see in it one of the chief attitudes which speculative thought may take, feeling that it is not for an individual, nor for an age, to pronounce upon a fundamental question of philosophy. That is a task for a whole era to work out. I have begun by showing that tychism must give birth to an evolutionary cosmology, in which all the regularities of nature and of mind are regarded as products of growth, and to a [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]]-fashioned idealism which holds matter to be mere specialized and partially deadened mind." - C.S. Peirce, "The Law of Mind", 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1892), "The Law of Mind", ''[[The Monist]]'', v. II, n. 4, July, pp. 533-559 (see first paragraph). ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=8akLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA533 Eprint]. ''Internet Archive'' [https://archive.org/stream/monist15instgoog#page/n545/mode/1up Eprint]. Reprinted ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', v. 6, paragraphs 102-163, ''Philosophical Writings of Peirce'' pp. 339-360, and ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 1, pp. 312-333.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The thesis==
In his theory of tychism, Peirce sought to deny the central position of the [[The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated|doctrine of necessity]] which maintains that "the state of things existing at any time, together with certain immutable laws, completely determine the state of things at every other time."&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1892) "The Doctrine of Necessity Examined", ''The Monist'', v. II, n. 3, pp. 321-337, see p. 323. ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=8akLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA323 Eprint]. ''Internet Archive'' [https://archive.org/stream/monist15instgoog#page/n337/mode/1up Eprint]. Reprinted in ''Collected Papers'' v. 6, paragraph 35-65, see 37; and in ''Philosophical Writings of Peirce'' pp. 324-38, and ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 1, pp 298-311.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the principal arguments of the [[Necessitarianism|necessitarians]] is that their position involves a presupposition of all science. Peirce attacks this idea asserting: "To 'postulate' a proposition is no more than to hope it is true."&lt;ref&gt;"The Doctrine of Necessity Examined" (see previous footnote), see p. 323. In ''Collected Papers'', see v. 6, paragraph 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus an avenue is opened up allowing the entry of chance as a fundamental and absolute entity.

Peirce does not, of course, assert that there is ''no'' law in the universe. On the contrary, he maintains that an absolutely chance world would be a contradiction and thus impossible.
Complete lack of order is itself a sort of order. The position he advocates is rather that there are in the universe both regularities and irregularities.

To explain the presence of such a universal "law" Peirce proposes a ''cosmological theory of evolution'' in which law develops out of chance. The hypothesis that ''out of irregularity, regularity constantly evolves'' seemed to him to have decided advantages not the least being its explanation of "why laws are not precisely or always obeyed, for what is still in a process of evolution can not be supposed to be absolutely fixed."&lt;ref&gt;Hamblin, pg. 380.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Underpinnings===

Attempting to provide an explanation of some of the more general observable traits of the universe, Peirce formulates four reasons in support of his hypothesis:
# Growth and increasing complexity
# Variety and diversity
# Regularity (laws of nature)
# Mind/consciousness/feeling&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, pg. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;
He then asks us to consider how these features could possibly be explained by a strictly [[Determinism|determined]], [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] theory of the way of all things.

==Evolution==
[[File:Universe expansion2.png|thumb|150px|Evolution begins]]
Peirce very pointedly observed that all the scientifically viable theories of [[evolution]] are based on tychistic formulations.

[[Herbert Spencer]] had argued that evolution was an inevitable upwards progress driven by the law of the [[conservation of energy]]. Peirce rejected this idea, pointing out that energy conservation, like other laws of classical physics, is [[time reversal symmetry|time-symmetric]]. Turning to [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] he points out that the fundamental driver of his theory is accidental variation, noting that "Darwinian evolution is evolution by the operation of chance, and the destruction of bad results." Even the [[catastrophism]] of [[Clarence King]] and others, which postulates an acceleration in evolutionary change via sudden environmental dislocations, naturally falls under the rubric of tychism.

This evolutionary aspect of tychism compels Peirce to expand Darwin's view to a cosmological level, sending its operations back to the origin of the universe under the regulative principle of his [[synechism]].

It involves a moral disposition to do [[good]], and also the intuition and sensibility to do so competently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/oriental/main.html |title=The Main Concepts of Confucianism |publisher=Philosophy.lander.edu |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Cheng)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Yi'' resonates with Confucian philosophy's orientation towards the cultivation of benevolence (''ren'') and skillful practice (''li'').

''Yi'' represents moral acumen which goes beyond simple rule following, and involves a balanced understanding of a situation, and the "creative insights" necessary to apply [[virtue|virtues]] "with no loss of sight of the total good. ''Yi'' represents this ideal of totality as well as a decision-generating ability to apply a virtue properly and appropriately in a situation." &lt;ref&gt;(Cheng p. 271)&lt;/ref&gt;

In application, ''yi'' is a "complex principle" which includes:

# skill in crafting actions which have moral fitness according to a given concrete situation
# the wise recognition of such fitness
# the intrinsic satisfaction that comes from that recognition.&lt;ref&gt;(Cheng)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and [[Bön]], '''Zhitro''' ({{lang-bo|ཞི་ཁྲོ}}) is the name referring to a cycle or [[mandala]] of 100 peaceful (''zhi'') and wrathful (''khro'') tantric deities and of a genre of scriptures and associated [[vajrayana|tantric]] practices which focus on those deities which represent the purified elements of the body and mind. These hundred peaceful and wrathful deities are believed to manifest to a deceased person following the dissolution of the body and consciousness in the intermediate state, or [[bardo]], between death and rebirth.  The best-known, though by no means only, example of this genre of texts and practices is commonly known as the Kar-ling Zhitro cycle after [[Karma Lingpa]], the [[tertön]] who (re)discovered or revealed this collection of texts. The text which is well known in the west as "[[The Tibetan Book of the Dead|Tibetan Book of the Dead]]" (though more properly called "The Great Liberation by Hearing in the Intermediate State") forms one section of Karma Lingpa's Zhitro cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author1=Padmasambhava|author-link1=Padmasambhava| author2=Karma Lingpa |author3=Gyurma Dorje |author-link3=Gyurme Dorje| editor1-last=Jinpa |editor1-first=Thupten |editor1-link= Thupten Jinpa |editor2-last= Coleman|editor2-first=Graham |others=His Holiness the Dalai Lama (introduction)| title = The Tibetan Book of the Dead: First Complete English Translation,| year = 2005 | publisher = Viking, Penguin Classics| location = London and New York| isbn = 9780713994148 |oclc=60794350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exegesis==
{{Over-quotation|date=March 2008}}
A prominent [[sadhana]], or practice text, is part of a group of [[bardo]] teachings which are held in the Nyingma tradition to have originated with [[Padmasambhava]] in the 8th century and were rediscovered as [[terma (religion)|terma]], or 'treasure teachings' in the 14th Century by the [[tertön]] [[Karma Lingpa]]. The Zhitro [[mandala]] teachings were found in the same terma collection as the ''[[Bardo Thodol]]'', a text well known in the West as ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead''.

The [[Dzogchen]] practice of Zhitro involves viewing the body as a [[mandala]] of both peaceful and [[wrathful deities]], the inclusivity promoting awareness in the practitioner of the universality of [[Buddha-nature]]. As a [[subtle body]] practice using yogic practices to manipulate the [[lung (Tibetan Buddhism)|lung]], or subtle-winds, of the body, this is a [[completion stage]] practice of the [[Inner Tantras]]. The Lion's Roar Tantric Glossary&lt;ref&gt;[http://lionsroar.name/tantric_glossary.htm Lion's Roar Tantric Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; describes the Zhitro [[mandala]] practice:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Zhi-khro is a practice of Tibetan Buddhism involving visualizing the body as a composite of the 100 peaceful and wrathful deities. In the practice, the deities are first visualized in mandalas of 42 peaceful and 58 wrathful deities centered in the heart, throat and crown chakra, and then in all the channels and nadis of the body.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shugchang, ''et al.'' (2000) define and frame the Zhi-khro teachings in relation to the [[Inner Tantras]], [[Anuyoga]], [[Atiyoga]], ''[[Guhyagarbha tantra]]'', [[rigpa]], [[Śūnyatā]], [[non-dual]]ity, [[kye-rim]], [[dzog-rim]] and [[bardo]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ''zhi-khro'', which translates as the peaceful and wrathful deities, is considered part of the inner tantra. It is actually a condensed teaching based upon the essential
meaning of the Guhyagarbha Tantra combined with the views expressed in the anu and ati yoga teachings. Many great masters have said that the ''zhi-khro'' teachings are the inner tantra of the inner tantra. In this case we're not making distinctions among the various inner tantras, nor between the creation and completion stages, but joining them all together. This is the union of rigpa and emptiness, the oneness of birth, death, and life experiences. There is no basis for discriminating because all are aspects of one true nature. Nothing is rejected or exclusively accepted. This teaching is known as the one that unifies everything into a single state.&lt;ref&gt;Shugchang, Padma (editor); Sherab, Khenchen Palden &amp; Dongyal, Khenpo Tse Wang (2000).

Gyatso (2006) relates how Zhitro was received by [[Yeshe Tsogyal]] through the ''[[Wang (Tibetan Buddhism)|wang]]'' of a [[Vidyadhara]] through the [[Bardo]] of [[trance]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
After succeeding in a variety of feats, including beheading a tiger, she gains access to an elaborate palace where she receives esoteric initiations from several vidyādharas and buddhas. She returns to Chingpu and after a year is robbed by seven bandits whom she then converts to Buddhist practice. She proceeds with the bandits on a magic carpet to the place Oḍḍiyāna where they all receive peaceful and wrathful deity practice (zhitro) initiations from a vidyādhara, who gives her the secret name Kharchen Za and cavorts in bliss with her.&lt;ref&gt;Gyatso, Janet (2006).
