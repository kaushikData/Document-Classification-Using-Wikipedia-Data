[[File:ოზურგეთის მაზრა.jpg|thumb|250px|Guria under the Russian Empire]]
The '''1841 rebellion in Guria''' ({{lang-ka|გურიის აჯანყება}}, ''guriis ajanq'eba''; {{lang-ru|Мятеж в Гурии}}, ''myatezh v Gurii'') was a conflict in the former [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[principality of Guria]], at that time part of the [[Georgia-Imeretia Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]], that took place as a reaction to the government's newly introduced duties and taxes for the Georgian peasants. The rebels, joined by several nobles, were initially successful in overrunning much of Guria, but they were finally defeated by the Russian army and the allied Georgian nobility in September 1841.

==Background==
Guria, a small and poor Georgian rural province on the [[Black Sea]], had been under the Russian hegemony since 1810. In 1829, the Russians eliminated the local autonomous [[Gurieli|princely rule]] and imposed a [[Georgia within the Russian Empire|Russian administration]]. The province had already been a scene of anti-Russian insurrection in 1820&lt;ref name="Suny"&gt;[[Ronald Grigor Suny|Suny, Ronald Grigor]] (1994), ''The Making of the Georgian Nation'', p. 85. Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|0253209153}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would gain more notability with a popular [[Gurian Republic|Social-Democratic uprising]] in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen F. Jones|Jones, Stephen F.]] (1989), "Marxism and Peasant Revolt in the Russian Empire: The Case of the Gurian Republic", ''[[Slavonic and East European Review]]'' '''67''': 403–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rebellion==
In 1841, without regard to local conditions, the Russian government ordered Gurian peasants to cultivate potatoes and to pay their taxes in Russian cash. Guria still maintained a primarily [[natural economy]] based on corn and millet. Rumors began to spread among the peasants that money payments would soon be required and that peasants would be drafted into the army.&lt;ref name="Suny"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MERSH13"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Rhyne|editor1-first=George N.|editor2-last=Wieczynski|editor2-first=Joseph L.|title=The Modern Encyclopedia of Russian and Soviet History, Volume 13|publisher=Academic International Press|isbn=0-87569-064-5|page=201|chapter=Guria Uprising of 1841|date=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the tax collections began in May 1841, the peasants of the [[Lanchkhuti]] community resisted and took to arms on May 22, 1841. The disturbances spread through all Guria and soon the rebels had almost 7,200 men in their ranks. They took control of most fortified points in the province and blocked roads leading to the city of [[Kutaisi]]. On August 9, 1841, the insurgents headed by Abes Bolkvadze clashed with the Russian troops of Colonel Brusilov at Gogoreti, inflicted heavy casualties upon them and forced Brusilov to retreat. Twice that month the Gurians tried but failed to take [[Ozurgeti]], the principal town of Guria and the last remaining outpost of the Russians. Dissension within the rebel ranks led to the defection of many noble allies, most importantly of Prince David [[Gugunava]]. Eventually, on September 5, some 2,500 regular Russian troops under Colonel Moisey Argutinsky-Dolgorukov—aided by the volunteer units provided by the pro-Russian nobles—attacked the rebels and defeated them, killing more than 60. By late September Guria was again calm and under the Russian control, but the government made no further effort to collect taxes in cash or cultivate potatoes. By 1842, most arrested rebel leaders were released, except Prince Ambako [[Shalikashvili]], who was banished to [[Siberia]].&lt;ref name="Suny"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MERSH13"/&gt; According to a Russian source published in 1901, the Russian losses in the rebellion were at least 32 killed, 115 wounded, and 17 captured.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} Гизетти А.

The rebellion was described by the peasant writer [[Egnate Ninoshvili]] (1859–1894) in his historical novel, ''The Revolt in Guria'' (ჯანყი გურიაში),&lt;ref name="Lang"&gt;[[David Marshall Lang|Lang, David Marshall]] (1962), ''A Modern History of Georgia'', p. 126.

'''Arun III''' is an ''under-construction'' run-of-the river type hydro-electric project constructed by SJVN Arun III Power Development Company Private Limited (A wholly owned subsidiary of SJVN Ltd) in [[Nepal]] at the [[Arun River (Nepal)|Arun River]]. In this project, 900 [[megawatt]]s of electricity was expected to be produced.&lt;ref name=NepalInvestmentBoard&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.ibn.gov.np/project/arun-3-hep |title=Arun-3 Hydro Electricity Project |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=6 June 2018 |quote=}} Nepal Investment Board &lt;/ref&gt; 

The project was formed by Nepal Government in 1992. However, the NGOs, environment protectors and individuals worried against rampant privatization in the culture and natural beauty of the Arun valley expressed numerous concerns against it. Besides, the criticism of the project included fear of increase of already high electricity tariffs and if the size of the project was appropriate for a country of Nepal's size. There was also a debate for the road to the project area concerning deforestation and habitat fragmentation. Finally in 1995, the [[World Bank]] decided to withdraw their support, effectively cancelling the project. {{Fact|date=September 2007}}

The Project again resurfaced and Project Development Agreement (PDA) was signed in November 2014, which brought into limelight the 21.9% free power to Nepal for 25 years, effectively silencing the Organisations and individuals working hard to protect the Arun valley. The surplus power from the project will be exported to India from Dhalkebar in Nepal to Muzaffarpur in Bihar. In 2017 the cabinet of india approved the project once the resistance for the project were weakened, and so the project is being pushed to be inaugurated in October, despite numerous objections to it,&lt;ref&gt;http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2017-10-03/indian-pm-modi-likely-to-visit-nepal-this-month.html&lt;/ref&gt; by the Indian prime minister.

[[File:CarlosAuersperg.jpg|thumb|''Prince Karl of Auersperg,&lt;br&gt; Minister-President 30 December 1867 – 24 September 1868'']]

The '''"Citizens' Ministry"'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Laurence |last=Cole |title=Military Culture and Popular Patriotism in Late Imperial Austria |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 |page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Bürgerministerium'') is a term used in a political debate, and later in historical literature. It also applies to the "Doctors' Ministry" (''Doktorenministerium''). They are used as summary descriptions for the four governments of the Austrian part of [[Austria-Hungary]] ([[Cisleithania]]), from 30 December 1867 to 4 April 1870, when the government tendered its resignation, and was dismissed on 12 April 1870. These were the initial administrations after the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Austro-Hungarian Compromise]] (''Ausgleich'') of 1867 that divided the empire's internal administration.

These were the ministries of [[Prince Karl of Auersperg]] (30 December 1867 – 24 September 1868), [[Taaffe]] (24 September 1868 – 15 January 1870), [[Baron Ignaz von Plener]] (15 January 1870 – 1 February 1870), and [[Leopold Hasner von Artha]] (1 February 1870 – 12 April 1870), during which the composition of the cabinet changed slightly. Cabinet members were drawn mainly from the [[German-Liberal Party]]. The Citizens' Ministry pursued a liberal political agenda, but failed in 1870 due to their inability to adequately manage the tensions between the many nationalities. When Hasner refused [[Emperor Franz Josef I]]'s request to dissolve the uncooperative regional Diet Assemblies, he resigned, bringing the ''Bürgerministerium'' to an end.

== Etymology ==
The term ''Bürgerministerium'', which may be translated as "citizens' ministry" or "bourgeois ministry"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Peter G. J. |last=Pulzer |title=The Rise of Political Anti-semitism in Germany &amp; Austria |edition=2nd |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1988 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-first=Lorraine |editor-last=Murray |title=The Britannica Guide to Countries of the European Union: Austria, Croatia, and Slovenia |publisher=Britannica |year=2014 |page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the German term ''Bürger'' should be understood in its double meaning: both ''citoyen'' and ''[[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Gerald |last=Stourzh |title=The Age of Emancipation and Assimilation – Liberalism and its Heritage |work=Österreich-Konzeptionen und jüdisches Selbstverständnis |publisher=Niemeyer |year=2001 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to four of the nine members of the Auersperg government. They were drawn from the [[bourgeoisie]], rather than nobility, while Plener had been knighted eleven years earlier. The majority of ministers were therefore commoners, a novelty at the time.

The term "Doctors' Ministry" refers to the five members who had obtained doctorates. The other three (Auersperg, Taaffe and Plener) had law degrees. Thus the proportion of graduates among the ministers was very high, also a novelty.

== Members ==
[[File:EduardTaaffe.jpg|thumb|''Count Eduard Taaffe,&lt;br&gt; Minister-President 24 September 1868 – 15 January 1870'']]
On 30 December 1867, Emperor Franz Joseph I proclaimed the former President of the Upper House of the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Council]] (''Reichsrat''), Prince Karl von Auersperg, as minister-president of the [[Cisleithania]]n part of the empire, or formally, the "President of My Council of Ministers of the Kingdoms and Lands represented in the Imperial Council" (''Präsidenten Meines Ministerrates der im Reichsrat vertretenen Königreiche und Länder''). After conflicts in the cabinet over concessions to various nationalities and ethnic groups represented in the Council of Ministers, he resigned in protest on 4 September 1868. Although an advocate of centralism, he agreed to negotiations with the Czechs in order to win their participation in the Imperial Council. In his view, Taaffe and Foreign Minister [[Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust]] (30 December 1867 – 8 November 1871) made excessive concessions to the [[Czech National Party]].
&lt;ref&gt;Pieter M. Judson: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgTHXMQh81cC&amp;pg=PA135#v=onepage&amp;q=federalism&amp;f=false Exclusive revolutionaries. Liberal politics, social experience, and national identity in the Austrian Empire, 1848–1914]''. The University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor 1996, {{ISBN|0-472-10740-2}}, S.&amp;nbsp;135ff.&lt;/ref&gt; 
He was succeeded by Eduard Taaffe until 15 January  1870 and then Plener and Hasner.

The Ministry proclaimed by the Emperor on 30 December 1867 consisted of;&lt;ref&gt;{{ANNO|wrz|01|01|1868|01|AUTOR=|Amtlicher Theil|ZUSATZ=(Nr. 1/1868)|ALTSEITE=1.}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Minister-president (''Ministerpresident''): Prince Karl of Auersperg
* Deputy Prime Minister (''Stellvertreter des Ministerpresidenten''), [[Austrian Minister of Defence (Austria-Hungary)|National Defense (''Landesverteidigung'')]] and Public Security: Count Eduard Taaffe (previously Minister of the Interior (''Innenminister''), from 24 September 1868)
* Interior (''Innenminister''): Dr. [[Carl Giskra]] (previously President of the Lower House of the Imperial Council – ''President des Abgeordnetenhauses des Reichsrates'')
* Finance (''Finanzminister'':): Dr. [[Rudolf Brestel]]
* Justice (''Justizminister''): Prof. [[Eduard Herbst]]
* Agriculture (''Ackerbauminister''): Count [[Alfred Józef Potocki|Alfred Potocki]] (dismissed 15 January 1870)
* Commerce (''Handelsminister''): [[Baron Ignaz von Plener|Count Ignaz Edler von Plener]]
* Culture and Education (''Minister für Kultus und Unterricht''): Dr. [[Leopold Hasner von Artha|Hasner Leopold Ritter von Artha]]
* Minister without portfolio (''Minister ohne Portefeuille''): Dr. [[Johann Nepomuk Berger (politician)|Johann Nepomuk Berger]] (dismissed 15 January 1870)

Taaffe, Potocki and Berger became the minority over their support of federalism and eventually resigned in 1870 when the Emperor did not support them and their "Minority Memorandum".

Cloud [[computing]] and storage provides users with capabilities to store and process their data in third-party [[data center]]s.&lt;ref name="cloudid"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haghighat | first1 = M. | last2 = Zonouz | first2 = S. | last3 = Abdel-Mottaleb | first3 = M. | year = 2015 | title = CloudID: Trustworthy Cloud-based and Cross-Enterprise Biometric Identification | doi = 10.1016/j.eswa.2015.06.025 | journal = Expert Systems with Applications | volume = 42 | issue = 21| pages = 7905–7916 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations use the cloud in a variety of different service models (with acronyms such as [[SaaS]], [[PaaS]], and [[IaaS]]) and deployment models ([[Cloud computing#Private cloud|private]], [[Cloud computing#Public cloud|public]], [[Cloud computing#Hybrid|hybrid]], and [[community cloud|community]]).&lt;ref name="Srinivasan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Srinivasan|first=Madhan|title='State-of-the-art cloud computing security taxonomies: a classification of security challenges in the present cloud computing environment|publisher= ACM ICACCI'|year=2012|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2345396.2345474}}&lt;/ref&gt; Security concerns associated with cloud computing fall into two broad categories: security issues faced by cloud providers (organizations providing [[Software as a service|software-]], [[Platform as a service|platform-]], or [[Infrastructure as a service|infrastructure-as-a-service]] via the cloud) and security issues faced by their customers (companies or organizations who host applications or store data on the cloud).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://security.sys-con.com/node/1231725|title=Swamp Computing a.k.a. Cloud Computing|publisher=Web Security Journal|date=2009-12-28|accessdate=2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The responsibility is shared, however. The provider must ensure that their infrastructure is secure and that their clients’ data and applications are protected, while the user must take measures to fortify their application and use strong passwords and authentication measures.

When an organization elects to store data or host applications on the public cloud, it loses its ability to have physical access to the servers hosting its information. As a result, potentially sensitive data is at risk from insider attacks. According to a recent [[Cloud Security Alliance]] report, insider attacks are the sixth biggest threat in cloud computing.&lt;ref name="Top Threats to Cloud Computing v1.0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Threats to Cloud Computing v1.0|url=https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/topthreats/csathreats.v1.0.pdf|publisher=Cloud Security Alliance|accessdate=2014-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, cloud service providers must ensure that thorough background checks are conducted for employees who have physical access to the servers in the data center. Additionally, data centers must be frequently monitored for suspicious activity.

In order to conserve resources, cut costs, and maintain efficiency, cloud service providers often store more than one customer's data on the same server. As a result, there is a chance that one user's private data can be viewed by other users (possibly even competitors). To handle such sensitive situations, cloud service providers should ensure proper [[Isolation (database systems)|data isolation]] and logical storage segregation.&lt;ref name="Srinivasan"/&gt;

The extensive use of [[virtualization]] in implementing cloud infrastructure brings unique security concerns for customers or tenants of a public cloud service.&lt;ref name="Cloud Virtual Security Winkler"&gt;{{cite web|last=Winkler|first=Vic|title=Cloud Computing: Virtual Cloud Security Concerns|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/hh641415.aspx|publisher=Technet Magazine, Microsoft|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Virtualization alters the relationship between the OS and underlying hardware – be it computing, storage or even networking. This introduces an additional layer – virtualization – that itself must be properly configured, managed and secured.&lt;ref name="virtualization risks hickey"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hickey|first=Kathleen|title=Dark Cloud: Study finds security risks in virtualization|url=http://gcn.com/articles/2010/03/18/dark-cloud-security.aspx|publisher=Government Security News|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific concerns include the potential to compromise the virtualization software, or "hypervisor". While these concerns are largely theoretical, they do exist.&lt;ref name="Securing the Cloud Winkler virt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Winkler|first=Vic|title=Securing the Cloud: Cloud Computer Security Techniques and Tactics|year=2011|publisher=Elsevier|location=Waltham, MA USA|isbn=978-1-59749-592-9 |page=59|url=http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/bookdescription.cws_home/723529/description#description}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a breach in the administrator workstation with the management software of the virtualization software can cause the whole datacenter to go down or be reconfigured to an attacker's liking.

== Cloud security controls ==

Cloud security architecture is effective only if the correct defensive implementations are in place. An efficient cloud security architecture should recognize the issues that will arise with security management.&lt;ref name="Krutz, Ronald L. 2010"&gt;Krutz, Ronald L., and Russell Dean Vines. "Cloud Computing Security Architecture." Cloud Security: A Comprehensive Guide to Secure Cloud Computing. Indianapolis, IN: Wiley, 2010. 179-80. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The security management addresses these issues with security controls. These controls are put in place to safeguard any weaknesses in the system and reduce the effect of an attack. While there are many types of controls behind a cloud security architecture, they can usually be found in one of the following categories:&lt;ref name="Krutz, Ronald L. 2010"/&gt;

;Deterrent controls
:These controls are intended to reduce attacks on a cloud system. Much like a warning sign on a fence or a property, deterrent controls typically reduce the threat level by informing potential attackers that there will be adverse consequences for them if they proceed.  (Some consider them a subset of preventive controls.)

;Preventive controls
:Preventive controls strengthen the system against incidents, generally by reducing if not actually eliminating vulnerabilities.  Strong authentication of cloud users, for instance, makes it less likely that unauthorized users can access cloud systems, and more likely that cloud users are positively identified.

;Detective controls
:Detective controls are intended to detect and react appropriately to any incidents that occur. In the event of an attack, a detective control will signal the preventative or corrective controls to address the issue.&lt;ref name="Krutz, Ronald L. 2010"/&gt;  System and network security monitoring, including intrusion detection and prevention arrangements, are typically employed to detect attacks on cloud systems and the supporting communications infrastructure.

;Corrective controls
:Corrective controls reduce the consequences of an incident, normally by limiting the damage. They come into effect during or after an incident.  Restoring system backups in order to rebuild a compromised system is an example of a corrective control.

==Dimensions of cloud security==

It is generally recommended that information security controls be selected and implemented according and in proportion to the risks, typically by assessing the threats, vulnerabilities and impacts. Cloud security concerns can be grouped in various ways; Gartner named seven&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/security-central/gartner-seven-cloud-computing-security-risks-853|title=Gartner: Seven cloud-computing security risks|publisher=InfoWorld|date=2008-07-02|accessdate=2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Cloud Security Alliance]] identified twelve areas of concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/top-threats-cloud-computing-plus-industry-insights/|title=Top Threats to Cloud Computing Plus: Industry Insights|last=|first=|date=2017-10-20|year=|website=|publisher=Cloud Security Alliance|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cloud access security broker]]s (CASBs) are software that sits between cloud users and cloud applications to provide visibility into cloud application usage, data protection and governance to monitor all activity and enforce security policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is a CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker)?|publisher=CipherCloud|url = https://www.ciphercloud.com/what-is-a-casb|accessdate = 2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security and privacy==

;Identity management :Every enterprise will have its own [[identity management system]] to control access to information and computing resources. Cloud providers either integrate the customer’s identity management system into their own infrastructure, using [[Federated identity management|federation]] or [[Single sign-on|SSO]] technology, or a biometric-based identification system,&lt;ref name="cloudid"/&gt; or provide an identity management system of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darkreading.com/identity-management-in-the-cloud/d/d-id/1140751 |title=Identity Management in the Cloud |publisher=Information Week |date=2013-10-25 |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; CloudID,&lt;ref name="cloudid"/&gt; for instance, provides privacy-preserving cloud-based and cross-enterprise biometric identification. It links the confidential information of the users to their biometrics and stores it in an encrypted fashion. Making use of a searchable encryption technique, biometric identification is performed in encrypted domain to make sure that the cloud provider or potential attackers do not gain access to any sensitive data or even the contents of the individual queries.&lt;ref name="cloudid"/&gt;

;Physical security :Cloud service providers physically secure the IT [[Computer hardware|hardware]] (servers, routers, cables etc.) against unauthorized access, interference, theft, fires, floods etc. and ensure that essential supplies (such as electricity) are sufficiently robust to minimize the possibility of disruption.  This is normally achieved by serving cloud applications from 'world-class' (i.e. professionally specified, designed, constructed, managed, monitored and maintained) data centers.

;Personnel security :Various information security concerns relating to the IT and other professionals associated with cloud services are typically handled through pre-, para- and post-employment activities such as security screening potential recruits, security awareness and training programs, proactive.
;Privacy :Providers ensure that all critical data (credit card numbers, for example) are [[data masking|masked]] or encrypted and that only authorized users have access to data in its entirety. Moreover, digital identities and credentials must be protected as should any data that the provider collects or produces about customer activity in the cloud.

==== Cloud Vulnerability and Penetration Testing ====
Scanning could from outside and inside using free or commercial products is very important because without a hardened environment your service is considered as a soft target. Virtual servers should be hardened like a physical server against [[Data leakage prevention|data leakage]], malware, and exploited vulnerabilities. "Data loss or leakage represents 24.6% and cloud related malware 3.4% of threats causing cloud outages”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thangasamy|first=Veeraiyah|date=2017|title=Journal of Applied Technology and Innovation|url=|journal=http://www.apu.edu.my/ejournals/jati/journal/JATI-VOLUME_1-ISSUE_2-2017.pdf|volume=1|pages=97|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scanning and penetration testing from inside or outside the cloud require to be authorized by the cloud provider. Since the cloud is a shared environment with other tenants following penetration testing rules of engagement step-by-step is a mandatory requirement. Violation of [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/pentest-rules-of-engagement acceptable use policy] which can lead to termination of the service.

== Data security ==
A number of security threats are associated with cloud data services: not only traditional security threats, such as network eavesdropping, illegal invasion, and denial of service attacks, but also specific cloud computing threats, such as side channel attacks, virtualization vulnerabilities, and abuse of cloud services. The following security requirements limit the threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jun Tang|first=Yong Cui|date=2016|title=Ensuring Security and Privacy Preservation for Cloud Data Services|url=http://www.4over6.edu.cn/cuiyong/lunwen/Ensuring%20Security%20and%20Privacy%20Preservation%20for%20Cloud%20Data%20Services.pdf|journal=ACM Computing Surveys|doi=10.1145/2906153|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Confidentiality ===
Data confidentiality is the property that data contents are not made available or disclosed to illegal users. Outsourced data is stored in a cloud and out of the owners' direct control. Only authorized users can access the sensitive data while others, including CSPs, should not gain any information of the data. Meanwhile, data owners expect to fully utilize cloud data services, e.g., data search, data computation, and data sharing, without the leakage of the data contents to CSPs or other adversaries.

=== Access controllability ===
Access controllability means that a data owner can perform the selective restriction of access to her or his data outsourced to cloud. Legal users can be authorized by the owner to access the data, while others can not access it without permissions. Further, it is desirable to enforce fine-grained access control to the outsourced data, i.e., different users should be granted different access privileges with regard to different data pieces. The access authorization must be controlled only by the owner in untrusted cloud environments.

=== Integrity ===
Data integrity demands maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data. A data owner always expects that her or his data in a cloud can be stored correctly and trustworthily. It means that the data should not be illegally tampered, improperly modified, deliberately deleted, or maliciously fabricated. If any undesirable operations corrupt or delete the data, the owner should be able to detect the corruption or loss. Further, when a portion of the outsourced data is corrupted or lost, it can still be retrieved by the data users.

== Encryption ==
Some advanced [[encryption]] algorithms which have been applied into cloud computing increase the protection of privacy. In a practice called [[crypto-shredding]], the keys can simply be deleted when there is no more use of the data.

=== Attribute-based encryption (ABE) ===
[[Attribute-based encryption]] is a type of [[public-key encryption]] in which the [[secret key]] of a user and the ciphertext are dependent upon attributes (e.g. the country in which he lives, or the kind of subscription he has). In such a system, the decryption of a ciphertext is possible only if the set of attributes of the user key matches the attributes of the ciphertext.

==== Ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-ABE) ====

In the CP-ABE, the encryptor controls access strategy. The main research work of CP-ABE is focused on the design of the access structure.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Key-policy ABE (KP-ABE) ====

In the KP-ABE, attribute sets are used to describe the encrypted texts and the private keys are associated to specified policy that users will have.

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) ===
Fully [[homomorphic encryption]] allows computations on encrypted data, and also allows computing sum and product for the encrypted data without decryption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|

=== Searchable encryption (SE) ===
Searchable encryption is a cryptographic system which offer secure search functions over encrypted data.

SE schemes can be classified into two categories: SE based on secret-key (or symmetric-key) cryptography,
and SE based on public-key cryptography.
In order to improve search efficiency, symmetric-key SE generally builds keyword indexes to answer user queries.

==Compliance==

Numerous laws and regulations pertain to the storage and use of data.  In the US these include privacy or data protection laws, [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]] (PCI DSS), the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA), the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]], the [[Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002]] (FISMA), and [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998]], among others.

Similar laws may apply in different legal jurisdictions and may differ quite markedly from those enforced in the US.  Cloud service users may often need to be aware of the legal and regulatory differences between the jurisdictions.  For example, data stored by a cloud service provider may be located in, say, Singapore and mirrored in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyslegaledge.com/2014/08/29/managing-legal-risks-arising-from-cloud-computing/|title=Managing legal risks arising from cloud computing  |publisher=DLA Piper |accessdate=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these regulations mandate particular controls (such as strong access controls and audit trails) and require regular reporting. Cloud customers must ensure that their cloud providers adequately fulfil such requirements as appropriate, enabling them to comply with their obligations since, to a large extent, they remain accountable.

;Business continuity and data recovery
:Cloud providers have [[business continuity planning|business continuity]] and [[data recovery]] plans in place to ensure that service can be maintained in case of a disaster or an emergency and that any data loss will be recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/benefits-cloud-based-recovery.aspx|title=It’s Time to Explore the Benefits of Cloud-Based Disaster Recovery |publisher=Dell.com |accessdate=2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plans may be shared with and reviewed by their customers, ideally dovetailing with the customers' own continuity arrangements. Joint continuity exercises may be appropriate, simulating a major Internet or electricity supply failure for instance.

;Log and audit trail
:In addition to producing logs and [[audit trail]]s, cloud providers work with their customers to ensure that these logs and audit trails are properly secured, maintained for as long as the customer requires, and are accessible for the purposes of forensic investigation (e.g., [[eDiscovery]]).

;Unique compliance requirements
:In addition to the requirements to which customers are subject, the data centers used by cloud providers may also be subject to compliance requirements. Using a cloud service provider (CSP) can lead to additional security concerns around data jurisdiction since customer or tenant data may not remain on the same system, or in the same data center or even within the same provider's cloud.&lt;ref name="Securing the Cloud Winkler"&gt;{{cite book|last=Winkler|first=Vic|title=Securing the Cloud: Cloud Computer Security Techniques and Tactics|year=2011|publisher=Elsevier|location=Waltham, MA USA|isbn=978-1-59749-592-9|pages=65, 68, 72, 81, 218–219, 231, 240|url=http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/bookdescription.cws_home/723529/description#description}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The European Union’s [[General Data Protection Regulation|GDPR]] regulation has introduced new compliance requirements for customer data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.safeswisscloud.ch/en/blog/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-how-does-new-european-data-protection-standard-impact|title=General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): How does the new European data-protection standard impact a company's cloud strategy? {{!}} Safe Swiss Cloud|website=safeswisscloud.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal and contractual issues==

Aside from the security and compliance issues enumerated above, cloud providers and their customers will negotiate terms around liability (stipulating how incidents involving data loss or compromise will be resolved, for example), [[intellectual property]], and end-of-service (when data and applications are ultimately returned to the customer). In addition, there are considerations for acquiring data from the cloud that may be involved in litigation.&lt;ref name="adams"&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Richard|title='The emergence of cloud storage and the need for a new digital forensic process model|publisher=Murdoch University|year=2013|url=http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/19431/1/emergence_of_cloud_storage.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These issues are discussed in [[service-level agreement]]s (SLA).

===Public records===

Legal issues may also include [[Records management|records-keeping]] requirements in the [[public sector]], where many agencies are required by law to retain and make available [[Records management#Managing electronic records|electronic records]] in a specific fashion. This may be determined by legislation, or law may require agencies to conform to the rules and practices set by a records-keeping agency. Public agencies using cloud computing and storage must take these concerns into account.

The '''Commemorative Works Act of 1986''' (Public Law 99-652; 40 U.S. Code Chapter 89) is a United States federal law which bars the construction of commemorative works on the [[National Mall]] and the [[National Capital Area]] unless they are approved by the [[National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission]] (NCMAC). The law also establishes criteria a memorial must meet in order to be approved the NCMAC, and establishes a seven-year deadline by which construction must begin or the memorial loses its congressional authorization. As of April 2014, the law has been amended five times, most notably by the '''Commemorative Works Clarification and Revision Act of 2003''' (Public Law 108-126).

==Commemorative Works Act of 1986==

===Legislative history===
By 1986, there were 110 national monuments, memorials, and statues in Washington, D.C., and its immediate environs. The pressure to build more memorials on the National Mall was extremely heavy, with roughly 15 new proposals being introduced in each session of Congress. Approximately 25 additional memorials had been seriously proposed but lacked a congressional sponsor to introduced authorizing legislation in Congress. The sheer number of memorials being proposed was not the only problems. The memorials were increasingly large, and often included extensive exhibits that threatened to turn memorials into miniature museums.&lt;ref name="Shannon"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shannon|first=Don|title=Proliferating Memorials Create a Space Problem|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 26, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11, 1986, Representative [[Mo Udall]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Arizona]]) introduced H.R. 4378, the Commemorative Works Act of 1986, in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. The bill was favorably reported by the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources|House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs]] on April 23, and passed the House by voice vote on May 5. A companion bill, S. 2522, was introduced in the [[United States Senate]] by Senator [[Malcolm Wallop]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Wyoming]]) on June 5. The bill was assigned to the [[United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources|Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources]], which favorably reported the bill with amendments on August 15. The bill passed the Senate, with additional amendments, by voice vote on September 10. The House made additional amendments of its own, and concurred with the Senate bill by voice vote on September 29. The Senate concurred with the House-amended bill by voice vote on October 16.  President [[Ronald Reagan]] signed the bill into law on November 14, 1986.

The Commemorative Works Act (CWA) established "significant procedural roadblocks" to the creation of new memorials.&lt;ref name="ForgeyManyMore"&gt;{{cite news|last=Forgey|first=Benjamin|title=How Many More Memorials?|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=June 17, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provisions===
Section 2(c) of the Commemorative Works Act of 1986 defines a "commemorative work" as a garden, memorial, memorial grove, monument, sculpture, statue, or other structure or landscape feature designed to perpetuate the memory of a person, group, or event.&lt;ref&gt;Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 2(c).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map Number 869-86501 - US National Park Service - 24 June 2003.jpg|thumb|Map showing the Reserve (greyed out area), Area I (within black boundary) and Area II of the National Capital Area.]]
Section 2(e) established specific zones within the National Capital Region to which various rules established by the Act would apply. Working with the [[General Services Administration]] and the [[National Park Service]], Congress had on May 1, 1986, created a map (number 869/86501) of these areas, which it named Area I and Area II.  Area I roughly encompassed a zone extending from the [[White House]] to the [[United States Capitol]]; from the Capitol along Maryland Avenue SW to and along the [[14th Street Bridge (Potomac River)|14th Street Bridge]]; the [[Virginia]] shore of the [[Potomac River]] from the 14th Street Bridge to [[Columbia Island (District of Columbia)|Columbia Island]]; Columbia Island; the National Park Service land fronting [[Arlington National Cemetery]] (excluding [[List of memorials and monuments at Arlington National Cemetery#Memorial Drive|Memorial Drive]]) north to [[Key Bridge (Washington, D.C.)|Key Bridge]]; Key Bridge due east across the Potomac River to [[Rock Creek (Potomac River)|Rock Creek]]; Rock Creek north to 26th Street NW and L Street NW; south on 26th Street NW to I Street NW; roughly west from the intersection of I and 26th Streets NW to the National Park Service land on the D.C. shore of the Potomac River; south along the Potomac River to [[West Potomac Park]] (including the grounds of the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]]); east along the National Mall to [[The Ellipse]]; and north to the White House.  Area II consisted of those parts of the National Capital Area outside Area I.&lt;ref name="Shannon" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 2(e).&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 3(a) of the Act barred establishment of a memorial anywhere within Area I or Area II without specific authorization by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 3(a).&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 4(a) of the Act formally established the National Capital Memorial Advisory Committee (NCMAC).  This committee had been informally established earlier by the [[United States Department of the Interior]]. The Act charged NCMAC with administering the Commemorative Works Act, and specified the membership of the committee. These were:&lt;ref name="Shannon" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 4(a).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Director of the National Park Service (who was also designated the committee's chair)
*[[Architect of the Capitol]]
*Chair of the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]]
*Chair of the [[United States Commission of Fine Arts]]
*Chair of the [[National Capital Planning Commission]]
*[[Mayor of the District of Columbia]]
*Commissioner of the Public Building Service of the General Services Administration
*[[United States Secretary of Defense]]
Section 7(a)(1) required memorials to be submitted to NCMAC for siting approval. Section 7(a)(1) required memorials to be submitted to the Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission for both site and design approval.&lt;ref name="ForgeyManyMore" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 7(a).&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 6(a) of the Commemorative Works Act established the criteria a commemorative work had to meet to be erected in Area I. Either the [[United States Secretary of the Interior]] or the Administrator of the General Services Administration could approve a memorial within Area I if and only if the person, group, or event to be commemorated was of "preeminent historical and lasting significance to the Nation."&lt;ref name="ForgeyManyMore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Section6"&gt;Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 6(a).&lt;/ref&gt; This determination could be made only after consulting with NCMAC. Even so, the affiramtive determination had to be approved by Congress within 150 days, or it was considered disapproved.&lt;ref name="Section6" /&gt;

Section 6(b) of the Commemorative Works Act established the criteria a commemorative work had to meet to be erected in Area II. Section 6(b)(1) governed military commemorative works. It barred memorials for "lesser" conflicts and those commemorating only a unit of the [[armed forces of the United States]]. An individual or the last surviving member of a group to be commemorated had to have died at least 25 years ago for a memorial to be erected. Other commemorative works—those not commemorating a war, branch of the armed forces, individual, or group—were permissible in Area II only if they were "a subject of lasting historical significance."&lt;ref name="SiteChosen"&gt;{{cite news|title=Site Chosen for Disabled Vets Memorial|newspaper=Associated Press|date=August 31, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 6(b).&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 8(a) barred the District of Columbia or Department of the Interior from issuing a construction permit for a commemorative work unless its site and design had been approved by the Secretary or Administrator, the Commission of Fine Arts, and the National Capital Planning Commission; unless the memorial planners could prove they had consulted knowledgeable individuals regarding historic preservation and "structural soundness and durability" about the memorial design; the memorial's builder had design and construction contracts signed; and the memorial's builder had sufficient funds in hand to complete construction.&lt;ref&gt;Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 8(a).&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Committee on Energy and Natural Resources|2007|page=1}}{{Efn|Throughout American history, funding for federal memorials had traditionally come from private donors. The federal government rarely provided public financing.}}&lt;ref name="Shannon" /&gt;

Section 8(b) also required memorial builders to collect an amount equal to 10 percent of the total cost of construction. This amount was to be turned over to the [[United States Treasury]], which would hold them in trust as a perpetual operations and maintenance fund for the memorial.&lt;ref&gt;Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 8(b).&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Committee on Energy and Natural Resources|2007|page=1}}&lt;ref name="DAVMagNeedsSppt"&gt;{{cite news|title=The American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial Needs Your Support|newspaper=DAV Magazine|date=March 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 10(b) provided that the authorization for a memorial would expire at the end of five years, unless a construction permit had been issued by the Department of the Interior or the General Services Administration or Congress had expressly enacted legislation authorizing an extension of the deadline.&lt;ref&gt;Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 10(b).&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Committee on Energy and Natural Resources|2007|page=1}} Section 10(e) exempted any memorial authorized before the 99th Congress from the five-year deadline.&lt;ref&gt;Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 10(e).&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Committee on Energy and Natural Resources|2007|page=1}}

Section 10(c) of the Act required that title to completed commemorative works be transferred to the Department of the Interior or the General Services Administration upon completion.&lt;ref&gt;Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 10(c).&lt;/ref&gt;

==1991 amendments==
The [[102nd United States Congress|102nd Congress]] amended the Commemorative Works Act for the first time. Representative [[Bill Clay]] (D-[[Missouri]]) introduced H.R. 3169 on August 1, 1991. It was referred to the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, which approved an amended bill on October 21. The House approved the bill by voice vote the same day. The bill was passed to the Senate, and referred to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. It was reported favorably on November 12, and approved by the Senate in a voice vote on November 27.  President [[George H. W. Bush]] signed it into law on December 11, 1991 (Public Law 102-216).

Public Law 102-216 lengthened the term of memorial authorization to seven years from five years.{{sfn|Committee on Energy and Natural Resources|2007|page=1}}&lt;ref&gt;An Act to lengthen from five to seven years the expiration period applicable to legislative authority relating to construction of commemorative works on Federal land in the District of Columbia and its environs, Public Law 102-216 (December 11, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

==1994 amendments==
In 1994, Congress enacted amendments to the Commemorative Works Act (Public Law 103-321).

On August 6, 1993, Representative [[Nancy Johnson]] (R-[[Connecticut]]) introduced H.R. 2947. It was referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources (the successor committee to the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs), and reported favorably (with amendments) on November 20, 1993. It passed the House on a voice vote on November 23. On October 15, 1993, Senator [[John Warner]] (R-Virginia]] introduced companion legislation (S. 1552) in the Senate. It was referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which favorably reported it, with amendments, on April 5, 1994. It passed the Senate on a voice vote on April 12. The House voted 378-to-0 to accept the amendment Senate bill on August 16, 1994. President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the bill into law (Public Law 103-321) on August 26.

Several memorials were close to losing their congressional authorization in 1994. The backers of these memorials convinced Congress that they were close to raising enough funds to build their commemorative works and obtain final design approval. In Section 1 of the amendments, Congress extended the authorization for the [[National Liberty Memorial#Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial|Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial]], National Peace Garden, and [[Women in Military Service for America Memorial]] from seven years to 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;To amend the Commemorative Works Act, and for other purposes, Public Law 103-321 (August 26, 1994), Section 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2(a) of the amendment made minor revisions to the commemorative works encompassed by the CWA. Commemorative works now included plaques and inscriptions, and memorial sponsors had to be either a public agency or a [[nonprofit]] organization as defined by the [[Internal Revenue Code]].&lt;ref&gt;To amend the Commemorative Works Act, and for other purposes, Public Law 103-321 (August 26, 1994), Section 2(a).&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2(b)(2) added the requirement that a major conflict occur at least 10 years ago in order to be authorized in Area I.&lt;ref&gt;To amend the Commemorative Works Act, and for other purposes, Public Law 103-321 (August 26, 1994), Section 2(b)(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2(c) changed the requirements for meeting the construction deadline.  Instead of commencing construction by the deadline, memorial backers now merely had to request a construction permit by the deadline. Memorial backers were also now required to show that they had considered alternative sites and alternative designs for their memorial as well.&lt;ref&gt;To amend the Commemorative Works Act, and for other purposes, Public Law 103-321 (August 26, 1994), Section 2(c).&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2(e)(2) established a new section of the CWA.  It allowed the Secretary of the Interior or the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) to suspend the fundraising for or construction of a commemorative work if the fundraising efforts misrepresented what the funds were being raised for, or if the fundraising effort implied it was an official effort of the United States government. Annual reports regarding fundraising were now required to be submitted either to Interior or GSA.&lt;ref&gt;To amend the Commemorative Works Act, and for other purposes, Public Law 103-321 (August 26, 1994), Section 2(e)(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

==2002 amendments==
On August 21, 2002, Congress enacted a law entitled "Codifying Title 40, United States Code—Public Buildings, Property, and Works" (Public Law 107–217). Subtitle II-Public Buildings and Works, Part D-Public Buildings, Grounds, and Parks in the District of Columbia, Sections 8901 to 8909 further amended the Commemorative Works Act.

Section 8902(a)(1) included "landscape features" in the definition of commemorative works. Section 8902(a)(2) expanded the range of organizations which could build memorials to any organization authorized by Congress (regardless of its nonprofit or for-profit status).&lt;ref&gt;Codifying Title 40, United States Code—Public Buildings, Property, and Works, Public Law 107-217 (August 21, 2002), Section 8902(a).&lt;/ref&gt; Section 8903(b) now barred absolutely works commemorating lesser conflicts or units of the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;Codifying Title 40, United States Code—Public Buildings, Property, and Works, Public Law 107-217 (August 21, 2002), Section 8903(b).&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the National Capital Memorial Advisory Committee was a creation of the Department of the Interior, it could be dissolved by the department at will, which would leave the CWA without an enforcing body. To rectify this, Section 8904 established a new National Capital Memorial Commission. It had the same membership, chair, and authority as its predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;Codifying Title 40, United States Code—Public Buildings, Property, and Works, Public Law 107-217 (August 21, 2002), Section 8904.&lt;/ref&gt;

Part D also made changes to the procedures by which memorials would be considered.  Now it was mandatory under Section 8905(a)(1) for a memorial's backers to consult with the National Capital Memorial Commission (NCMC) regarding alternative sites and designs.&lt;ref&gt;Codifying Title 40, United States Code—Public Buildings, Property, and Works, Public Law 107-217 (August 21, 2002), Section 8905(a)(1).&lt;/ref&gt; No longer could memorial backers submit their proposed sites and designs directly to the CFA or the NCPC.  Now, according to Section 8905(a)(2), only the Department of the Interior or GSA had that authority (which effectively forced memorial backers to coordinate with them to get a submission made).&lt;ref&gt;Codifying Title 40, United States Code—Public Buildings, Property, and Works, Public Law 107-217 (August 21, 2002), Section 8905(a)(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress also tightened the rules for approving a memorial.  Section 8905(b) now required that the work be placed only in an area "relevant to the subject of the work"; that the new memorial not "interfere with, or encroach on, an existing commemorative work"; protect as much open space as possible and be compatible with existing public use; be constructed of durable materials; and contain landscaping compatible with the local climate.&lt;ref&gt;Codifying Title 40, United States Code—Public Buildings, Property, and Works, Public Law 107-217 (August 21, 2002), Section 8905(b).&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 8906(b)(1) now required that the 10 percent trust fund be turned over to the Treasury before a construction permit could be issued.&lt;ref&gt;Codifying Title 40, United States Code—Public Buildings, Property, and Works, Public Law 107-217 (August 21, 2002), Section 8906(b)(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

==2003 amendments==
Congress enacted the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center Authorization (Public Law 108–126) on November 17, 2003. Unlike subsequent memorial nonprofits, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Foundation (VVMF) continued to operate and solicit funds long after the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] had been constructed. The foundation was now self-perpetuating, and had a large staff, lobbyists, and programming. The VVMF began agitating for a museum about the Vietnam War to be constructed near the memorial. The VVMF had raised significant sums of money to construct this museum (which it called a "visitor's center", so as not to alarm [[Smithsonian Institution]] officials), and it had a potent and well-organized grassroots campaign pressuring Congress to approve the plan.

Title I of the act authorized construction of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitors' Center.

Title II of the act was titled the Commemorative Works Clarification and Revision Act of 2003 (CWCRA).

Title II, Section 202 made a major revision to Area I.  Congress now defined within Area I a zone it called the Reserve.  The Reserve was designated generally as the National Mall from the Capitol to the [[Lincoln Memorial]], and the cross-axis of the Mall from the White House to the [[Jefferson Memorial]]. Section 202 expressly prohibited new commemorative works or visitors' centers within the Reserve.&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center Authorization, Public Law 108–126 (November 17, 2003), Title II—Commemorative Works, Section 202.&lt;/ref&gt; A new map, numbered 869/86501 B and dated June 24, 2003, was created to depict the Reserve.&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center Authorization, Public Law 108–126 (November 17, 2003), Title II—Commemorative Works, Section 203(b).&lt;/ref&gt;

Title II, Section 203(a) now explicitly required NCMC, CFA, NCPC, and other bodies with oversight over memorial siting to seek to locate commemorative works throughout the entire National Capital Area (not just Area I or areas adjacent to it).&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center Authorization, Public Law 108–126 (November 17, 2003), Title II—Commemorative Works, Section 203(a).&lt;/ref&gt;

Title II, Section 203(c) also changed what works could qualify for placement in Area I and Area II.  Works commemorating lesser conflicts were no longer outright barred.  Now a commemorative work could memorialize a lesser conflict so long as it did not solely do so.{{Efn|This section also changed the name of NCMC back to the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission.}}&lt;ref name="Memorial Visitor Center Authorization 2003"&gt;Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center Authorization, Public Law 108–126 (November 17, 2003), Title II—Commemorative Works, Section 203(c).&lt;/ref&gt;

Title II, Section 203(c)(3) relaxed slightly the standard for issuing a construction permit.  Now the Secretary of the Interior or the Administrator of the GSA, in consultation with NCMAC, had the discretion to issue a construction permit if both the NCPC and CFA had issued final (not preliminary) design approval and the foundation had 75 percent (not 100 percent) of the construction funds in hand. Either the Secretary or Administrator also had the authority to extend for up to three years the authorization of a memorial if these conditions were met.&lt;ref name="Memorial Visitor Center Authorization 2003"/&gt; Title II, Section 203(f) made it clear, however, that the 10 percent trust fund contribution must also be made (in addition to having 75 percent of construction funds) for a construction permit to issue.&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center Authorization, Public Law 108–126 (November 17, 2003), Title II—Commemorative Works, Section 203(f).&lt;/ref&gt;

Title II, Section 204 made adjustments to the approval criteria. It barred construction of any museum in either Area I or [[East Potomac Park]], and authorized the CFA and NCPC to develop joint regulations, guidelines, and criteria to carry out the CWA. It also barred recognition of donor contributions on any memorial.&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center Authorization, Public Law 108–126 (November 17, 2003), Title II—Commemorative Works, Section 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2009 amendments==
Congress enacted the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 (Public Law 111–11) on March 30, 2009. Title VII—National Park Service Authorizations, Subtitle B—Amendments to Existing Units of the National Park System, Section 7116(e) made minor technical corrections to the CWA (primarily in the name of committees).&lt;ref&gt;Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, Public Law 111–11 (March 30, 2009), Title VII—National Park Service Authorizations, Subtitle B—Amendments to Existing Units of the National Park System, Section 7116(e).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Common ground''' is the overlap between the positions of parties that may otherwise disagree. "Finding common ground" is a technique people use to facilitate [[interpersonal relationship]]s. To find common ground between parties, participants must search for signals of [[Recognition (sociology)|recognition]], which are often subtle and prone to misunderstanding. Generally, [[smile]]s, bland faces, or frowns can be the positive, neutral, or negative signals. When verbal communication is possible, the participants can [[speech|speak]] and then [[wikt:listen|listen]]. Another aspect to establishing common ground is the use of visual cues. According to Gergle et al (2013), visual cues also help establish common ground in that it gives a reference to the speaker as to how much is understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gergle|first=Darren|date=2013|title=Using Visual Information for Grounding and Awareness in Collaborative Tasks|url=|journal=HCI Journal|volume=|pages=1-43|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In academia, ''grounding criterion'' is the standard that communicators must meet for a communication to succeed. Effective communication can be further thought of as having two distinct parts—the presentation phase, in which the information is relayed, and the acceptance phase, in which the receiver acknowledges comprehension of the information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Perspectives on socially shared cognition|last=Clark|first=Herbert H.|last2=Brennan|first2=Susan E.|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=1991|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=129-130|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the ''[[commons]]'' in many communities were places available to everyone, such as the [[village pump]], or the [[sidewalk]] of a [[road]]. Thus, even for those far from [[home]], the sight of someone familiar only from the ''commons'' might be comforting to a homesick or lonely traveller. This effect can be seen in many [[kinship group]]s. One measure for interpersonal relationships is ''warmth''. Thus discovery of ''common ground'' is commonly cause for comfort and additional [[happiness]] among the participants, and is one step on the way to [[respect]] or perhaps [[friendship]].

However, to some people in small-enough communities, conflict may have occurred between them too often to find common ground, and isolation from each other is the only path toward [[healing]] and a [[health]]y [[personal relationship|relationship]]. For such people, shunning of the commons is necessary. But if one is ''forced'' onto the commons, then a minimal acceptable behavior toward others is necessary when on common ground, as in a [[truce]].

As an example, one technique for [[Anonymity|anonymous]] [[trade]] between mutually suspicious parties was for the offerers to lay the goods (such as [[gold]]) in a clearing (the potential ''common ground''), and then to hide in the forest with the gold in their plain sight, while armed with weapons, in the event of treachery. Thus, offers could be made to traders. The traders, who bore goods (and who were also armed with weapons), would lay the trade goods in the clearing, and take the gold back with them. This was a mechanism for trading between the [[Moors]] and the gold miners of [[History of Africa|Africa]] over a millennium ago, and also for trade with [[Sumatra]] (the ''isle of gold'') and other islands of [[Southeast Asia]]. This has some structural similarity to the policy of [[mutually assured destruction]] during the [[Cold War]] era.

Today, we have the advantage of more highly developed communications techniques, but the basic need for minimizing suspicion and maximizing [[Trust (sociology)|trust]] remains with us, worldwide, at a time when [[Social polarization|polarization]] is increasing.

Government efforts resulted in increased trust of citizens and positive changes in the level of corruption.1 However, addressing the corruption-prone areas requires stronger political will, efforts and healthy environment for broad stakeholder participation in the fight against corruption. With the existing financial resources, growing skills and capacities in government institutions, Azerbaijan has the potential for more significant and comprehensive actions to rid public institutions and the business sector from entrenched corruption.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 122nd place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2017|last=e.V.|first=Transparency International|work=www.transparency.org|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International anti-corruption indices and reports ==
According to [[Transparency International]], [[Azerbaijan]] demonstrates improvement in international anti-corruption reports; however, its position in these indices is weak comparatively to that of neighbouring countries, such as [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/azerbaijan_national_integrity_system_assessment_2014|title=TI Publication - Azerbaijan National Integrity System Assessment 2014|last=e.V.|first=Transparency International|website=www.transparency.org|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/NIT2016_Azerbaijan.pdf|title=Corruption|last=|first=|date=|website=World Bank World Development Indicators|access-date=|quote=Azerbaijan is among the most corrupt countries in the world. The Council of Europe Group of States Against Corruption (GRECO) report on Azerbaijan, released in April 2015, noted, “Despite some serious efforts were undertaken since 2011 to tackle low-level public sector corruption there is little evidence of it being pursued with determination among the political elite and the upper echelons of the public service.” According to Transparency International’s 2015 Corruption Perceptions Index, Azerbaijan ranked 119 out of 168 countries.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transparency International's 2017 [[Corruption Perceptions Index|Corruption Perception Index]] (CPI), Azerbaijan achieved its best position in that year since its inclusion in the report in 2000.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Thus, in 2015, Azerbaijan was ranked 20th out of 168 countries compared to 2001 when it was ranked 87th out of 90 countries.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.transparency.org/cpi2015/|title=Transparency International - Corruption Perception Index 2015|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 CPI results show that even though Azerbaijan is ahead of the Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, it is behind Georgia and Turkey.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The [[World Bank]]’s [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] support the above-mentioned comparative statistics between countries and report that Azerbaijan's ability to control corruption has increased to 20 (2015) from 7 (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/index.aspx#reports|title=World Bank, Worldwide Governance Indicators|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 [[Global Corruption Barometer]] (GCB) report of Transparency International indicates that 9% of respondents in Azerbaijan think that corruption has increased a lot.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/gcb2013|title=Transparency International - Global Corruption Barometer results 2013|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While 69% consider that the government's efforts are effective in the fight against corruption Furthermore, 71% of respondents agree that an ordinary person can make a difference in the fight against corruption in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Citizens participation and the values of integrity, accountability, and transparency are crucial components of fighting corruption.  It is important to develop programs and actions to change the cultural understanding of corruption and helped citizens to act against abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00460|title=Increase in the number of civil complaints against acts of corruption.

Framework Programme 7 (FP7).|last=|first=|date=|website=SIOR, Social Impact Open Repository|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2013 GCB report, health, the judiciary, and police were perceived as the most corrupt sectors by respondents. In comparison to the 2010 GCB report, improvement is noted in the more recent report with increased levels of trust in the civil service, education, and police.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is noted that, contrary to international perceptions, Azerbaijani respondents perceive political parties as one of the least corrupt sectors alongside the media and religious bodies&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The 2014 National Integrity Assessment report of the Azerbaijani National Chapter of Transparency International characterized Azerbaijan as having a strong executive branch, and law enforcement and anti-corruption agencies while the report indicates that the judiciary and legislative branches of governance are comparatively weak, with the pillars that perform watchdog functions, including civil society, the media, and political parties, being the weakest links in the national integrity system.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to the Global Integrity Index (GIX) (2011), the anti-corruption legislative framework of Azerbaijan is strong (89 out of 100); however, its implementation is very weak (38 out of 100) considering the powers that have been granted by law.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalintegrity.org/research/reports/global-integrity-report/global-integrity-report-2011/|title=Global Integrity Report 2011|website=www.globalintegrity.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azerbaijan has improved its anti-corruption legislation to bring it into line with the standards of international conventions. However, it lacks the supporting legislative Acts and institutional measures to apply it in practice, thus creating a disparity between the existing legislation and its application.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Azerbaijan is a member of the Council of Europe's Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) and has passed its first, second and third evaluation rounds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In GRECO's fourth evaluation round report, it is noted that, even though serious anti-corruption efforts have been carried out by the Azerbaijani government to fight against corruption, corruption is still being referred to as one of most problematic areas in the country&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, the GRECO report notes that the lack of control on ancillary activities and asset disclosure of Members of Parliament weakens the anti-corruption framework: the report recommends that anti-corruption efforts be deepened and institutionalized in the field of asset declaration and conflicts of interest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Azerbaijan has signed the Istanbul Anti-Corruption Action Plan ([[Istanbul Action Plan]], or IAP) which covers Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan and the other ACN countries in 2003. The Implementation of the plan includes regular and systematic peer review of the legal, and institutional framework for fighting corruption in the covered countries by the signing parties. Since then Azerbaijan has actively taken part in the monitoring rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/corruption/acn/istanbulactionplancountryreports.htm|title=Istanbul Anti-corruption Action Plan country reports - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international corruption reports and surveys conclude that Azerbaijan demonstrates steady improvement in anti-corruption rankings, but its progress is relatively slower than that of neighbouring countries. Furthermore, Azerbaijan has advanced with its anti-corruption legislation and strong executive branch; however, the legislature and the judiciary are perceived weak and potentially more exposed to corruption.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On March 2017, the authorities of Azerbaijan have authorised publication of the Fourth Round Compliance Report on Azerbaijan by GRECO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Azerbaijan - Publication of 4th Round Compliance Report|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/greco/-/azerbaijan-publication-of-4th-round-compliance-report|accessdate=13 April 2017|work=Group of States against Corruption}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political context and background timeline of corruption issues   ==
After the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]] in late 1991, the transition period in Azerbaijan was complicated and further prolonged by the inability of the national political elite to ensure the existence of key public institutions during 1991–1993&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=THE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS OF AZERBAIJAN: A DICHOTOMY BETWEEN TEXT AND REALITY|last=Badalov|first=Mehti|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, during those years, Azerbaijan was forced to engage in military clashes with Armenia over the region of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=www.ismor.com/cornwallis/cornwallis_2005/CX_2005_12-Baranick2-CX-July17.pdf|last=M.|first=Baranick|publisher=|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, as a result of the invasion by Armenia, Azerbaijan lost 20% of its territory. In the same year, the [[List of United Nations Security Council resolutions on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict|United Nations Security Council adopted four resolutions (822, 853, 874 and 884)]] which condemned the use of force against Azerbaijan and the occupation of its territories.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Statement by Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov at the First Meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Contact Group on the aggression of Armenia against Azerbaijan|last=Elmar Mammadyarov|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN Security Council demanded from Armenia the immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of the occupying forces.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

As a result of the war with Armenia, the influx of more than one million [[Refugees in Azerbaijan|refugees and internally displaced people]] had a devastating impact on both the social and economic situation in Azerbaijan (Badalov and Mehdi, 2004). This tragic event shifted the priority of the country from building public institutions to accommodating internally displaced people (IDPs) and providing them with the necessary living standards.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In addition, the collapse of the Soviet Union caused economic paralysis in Azerbaijan. Therefore, the main priorities of the Azerbaijani government were to divert all of its financial and political resources to safeguarding IDPs and to fighting against the invasion by Armenia in the international legal arena.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== First indicator of anti-corruption political will ==
Following a period of state building after 1993, adoption of the new Constitution and with Azerbaijan's increasing economic power, President [[Heydar Aliyev]] identified four key reform areas comprising: (i) re-organization of state institutions; (ii) adoption of clear and transparent regulations for civil service recruitment; (iii) creation of various anti-corruption preventive and judicial institutions; and (iv) establishment of an anti-corruption policy.&lt;ref name="Anti korrupsiya"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://antikorrupsiya.gov.az/view.php?lang=en&amp;menu=27&amp;page=2|title=Anti korrupsiya|website=antikorrupsiya.gov.az|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Aliyev next signed the decree on “Strengthening the fight against corruption in the Republic of Azerbaijan” on 8 August 2000, which is considered to be the first indicator of the commitment of political will to the fight against corruption in Azerbaijan. The document clearly indicates that despite reforms having been carried out in the field of fighting against economic crimes, corruption and bribery continued to be widespread in public administration and financial regulatory bodies&lt;ref name="Anti korrupsiya"/&gt;

The document also noted that some public officials were misusing their powers to embezzle state property.&lt;ref name="Anti korrupsiya"/&gt; Furthermore, it stated that legal violations in the private sector and financial regulatory bodies were the main impediments to the establishment of a safe market economy, entrepreneurship and foreign direct investments (FDIs). This anti-corruption decree shows that the fight against corruption came to the state policy agenda almost one decade after the year of independence, and that the main reason behind this document was to attract foreign investment. Another important aspect of this decree is that it assigned tasks to relevant authorities to prepare the draft law and the State Program on Combating Corruption.&lt;ref name="Anti korrupsiya"/&gt;

== Institutional arrangements and coordination mechanisms ==

=== Commission on Combating Corruption ===
[[Commission on Combating Corruption]] is set up according to the article 4.2 of the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on "Fight Against Corruption" and functions as a specialized agency on combating corruption since 2005. Commission is composed of 15 members. 5 members of the Commission are appointed by the President of the Republic, 5 by the Parliament and the 5 by the Constitutional Court. The statute of it approved by the Law of Azerbaijan Republic dated May 3, 2005 defines the authorities of the Commission.

Commission on Combating Corruption (CCC) is the main organization and government body which is responsible for policies and prevention measures to fight against corruption. CCC is also responsible for making progress and action plans according to the requirements of the international organizations Azerbaijan has joined with the purpose of eliminating corruption. Azerbaijan has also adopted National Action Plan for 2016-2018 on Promotion of Open Government (hereinafter Action Plan) which addresses anti-corruption, through public consultations with the help of proposals of several NGOs.

=== Anti-Corruption General Directorate ===
Anti-Corruption (bribery) General Directorate with the Prosecutor General of the Republic of Azerbaijan was established by the Order of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan No.114 dated March 3, 2004.  Directorate General - is a body specialized in the field of preliminary investigation conducted on the corruption crimes, and is subordinated to the Prosecutor General of the Republic of Azerbaijan.

Main responsibilities of the Directorate include: consideration and investigation of complaints received in relation to corruption offenses; to institute criminal proceedings and conduct a preliminary investigation of corruption crimes; carry out operational-search activities to prevent, detect and disclose corruption crimes; on the basis of orders of the Directorate to oversee the implementation of laws during the implementation of operational-search measures on corruption crimes by other bodies of operational and search activities; compensation for material damage caused as a result of corruption offenses as well as to implement legal measures to enable confiscation of property; get acquainted with measures on fight against corruption; collect, analyze and summarize information on offenses relating to corruption; to enhance the effectiveness of the fight against corruption make proposals and recommendations; ensure the implementation of safety measures of witnesses, victims, defendants and others involved in criminal proceedings during the preliminary investigation of corruption crimes, as well as during the trial of these crimes; via the Prosecutor General to regularly inform the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Commission for combating corruption about the measures undertaken in the field of fight against corruption; cooperate with the government and other authorities in the field of fighting corruption; to inform the public on their activities, to ensure transparency in its activities, etc.

=== Civil Service Commission ===
Corrupt practices, including nepotism and cronyism, were widespread in civil service recruitment in Azerbaijan until 2005 Azerbaijan did not have the necessary legislative and institutional basis to prevent corruption in one of the most important sectors of public administration. The widespread practice used in the recruitment of personnel was based on recommendations and bribes. In addition, Azerbaijan did not have a merit-based recruitment system and the Chief Executives of the executive bodies had wide discretion in appointing any personnel. In 2005, the Civil Service Commission (CSC) was established by Presidential Decree, with the commission legally authorized to conduct civil service recruitment and to place candidates in state positions in a centralized manner based on competition and objective evaluation (OECD Istanbul Anti-corruption Action Plan, 2016). Furthermore, the CSC has powers to audit the ethics compliance of civil servants and to implement state policy on supplementary education, attestation and the social protection of civil servants.

The CSC has reduced the risk of corruption and has prevented the use of personal affiliations in the civil service recruitment system. Some loopholes are still present in the recruitment system: the OECD Anti-Corruption Network has pointed out that new preventive regulations should also cover the recruitment of high-level civil servants.

=== [[ASAN service|ASAN Service]] ===
Issues of corruption in public service delivery were one of the problematic areas within the public sector. Citizens faced administrative burdens and bureaucratic barriers in obtaining basic public services. In some situations, citizens were extorted to pay bribes to obtain public services. To eliminate corruption in public service delivery, a new preventive institution, namely, the Azerbaijan service assessment network (ASAN) (''asan'' means “easy” in the Azerbaijani) was established by Presidential Decree in 2012.&lt;ref name="Jafarov"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2013/jul/31/azerbaijan-public-service-assessment-network|title=Azerbaijan's one-stop public service shop is driving up efficiency|last=Jafarov|first=Kamal|date=2013-07-31|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, this institution provides 34 services for 10 state bodies. It was the first one-stop-shop service delivery model in the world to provide the services of various state bodies rather than only the services of one state body.&lt;ref name="Jafarov"/&gt;

No conflict of interest exists between ASAN service employees and Azerbaijani citizens as ASAN service employees do not provide any kind of service themselves. All services are provided by the employees of the 10 state bodies under one roof, based on the standards of the ASAN service. Employees of the ASAN service monitor the work of the state bodies, check for compliance with ethics rules and manage the queue system.&lt;ref name="Jafarov"/&gt;

Monitoring report by [[OECD]] has praised Azerbaijan "for advancing Azerbaijani Service and Assessment Network (ASAN) centers, which has contributed to eliminating the conditions that are conducive to corruption when delivering various administrative services to the public".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/corruption/acn/Azerbaijan-Round-4-Monitoring-Report-ENG.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2017|title=Anti-Corruption Reforms in AZERBAIJAN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan 2016 report by [[EEAS]] acknowledged ASAN services have been a great help in the elimination of corruption and bribery, as well as removing bureaucracy in public service delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/eu_business_climate_survey_azerbaijan_2016_final_5.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2017|title=EU Business Climate Survey Azerbaijan 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar institution is planned to be established in Afghanistan as well.  A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the State Agency for Public Service and Social Innovations under the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan and Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Afghanistan on July 12, 2016. The aim of the Memorandum is to establish a public service delivery mechanism in Afghanistan based on Azerbaijani model “ASAN service”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asan.gov.az/en/content/view/249/2884#.WUnu6uuGPIU|title=Afghanistan applies "ASAN service" model|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judicial-Legal Council (JLC) ===
The Judicial-Legal Council (JLC), established in 2005, is an independent body and has organizational and financial independence. It is financed from the state budget and its prospective year's budget cannot be less than the previous year's budget. The JLC has 15 members, nine of whom are judges, while five are from the Prosecutor General's Office and the Bar Association of the Republic of Azerbaijan, and one member is from the executive body. The JLC has the competence to carry out the selection of candidate judges and to undertake evaluation, promotion and transfer of judges. Those members of the JLC who are not judges are also granted immunity.

The JLC has the authority to bring judges to account in terms of disciplinary liability; to discuss the issue of terminating the term of judges; and to propose this course of action to the relevant state body. Furthermore, the JLC has the right to endorse the Prosecutor General's Office to initiate criminal proceedings against judges and to temporarily suspend them from their position. The JLC also analyzes the activities of judges and the organization of the courts; submits proposals regarding the improvement of legislation related to courts and judges; and arranges specialized courses, and relevant seminars and training to raise the level of professionalism of judges. The JLC convenes the Judges’ Selection Committee which has the right to select candidates for vacant judicial posts. This Committee is composed of 11 members, who include judges, JLC staff, representatives of the respective executive body and the Prosecutor General's Office, defence lawyers and academics.

== Legal framework for the work of the anti-corruption ==
The main anti-corruption law, the ''Law of 2004 on Combating Corruption'', which defines the directions of the fight against corruption, was adopted on 13 January 2004. This law, which consists of the following four chapters, defines the main principles and framework for fighting against corruption: (i) general provisions; (ii) prevention of corruption; (iii) criminalization of corruption; and (iv) removal of the proceeds of corruption offences.

This law explained the notion of corruption; introduced a list of corruption offences (stipulating that these offences will give rise to civil, administrative and criminal liability); identified specialized anti-corruption agencies (ACAs); and regulated the general rules on asset declarations, the rule of restrictions on gifts and the prohibition on working together for those who are next of kin.

In 2006, a new chapter on corruption offences was added to the Azerbaijani Criminal Code. It is important to note that this existing criminal legislation fully addresses the requirements of UNCAC's Article 15 (Bribery of national public officials); Article 16 (Bribery of foreign public officials and officials of public international organizations); and Article 21 (Bribery in the private sector), which together criminalize the active and passive bribery of national/foreign public officials as well as persons carrying out organizational-administrative or administrative-economic functions in commercial and non-commercial organizations.

UNCAC's Article 17 (Embezzlement, misappropriation or other diversion of property by a public official) and Article 22 (Embezzlement of property in the private sector) are criminalized in the Azerbaijani Criminal Code along with Article 178 (Fraud) and Article 179 (Misappropriation and embezzlement of property). Even though public officials are not specified as the subject of Articles 178 and 179, an aggravating condition for both criminal offences is commission of the offence by any person through the use of his/her service position, with this including public officials and people working in the private sector (E-qanun.az, 2016).

It should be noted that UNCAC's Article 18 (Trading in influence) and Article 19 (Abuse of power) are not mandatory provisions, but both active/passive trading in influence and abuse of power were criminalized in the Azerbaijani Criminal Code with Article 308 (Abuse of power) and Article 312-1 (Trading in influence).

Illicit enrichment, UNCAC non-mandatory requirement, is not criminalized in Azerbaijan's national legislation. Very few states have introduced this corruption offence to their criminal legislation: different controversies about this issue include the point that a reversal of the burden of proof is used in illicit enrichment (Dionisie and Checchi, 2007). To elaborate, in illicit enrichment, public officials are obliged to explain the source of a significant increase in his/her assets and financial situation. It is important to note that the reversal of the burden of proof is contrary to the principles of the presumption of innocence and the protection of property, as laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights (Huseynov, 2014).

In addition, the Azerbaijani Criminal Code criminalizes the laundering of the proceeds of crime and its concealment: this legislation fully complies with the mandatory obligation arising from UNCAC's Article 23 (Laundering of proceeds of crime) and Article 24 (Concealment). Article 193-1 of the Criminal Code includes two crimes on money laundering. Firstly, the Criminal Code criminalizes the concealment of the real source, disposition, movement or ownership of the rights to money resources and other property, knowing that they have been obtained through illegal acts. Secondly, the Criminal Code criminalizes the carrying out of financial operations, the conversion or the transfer of proceeds of crime.

The Criminal Code provides for the criminal liability of legal persons with criminal charges incurring the following: sanctions, confiscation, depriving a legal person of the right to engage in certain activities, or liquidation of a legal entity. Even though Azerbaijan's national domestic legislation on the criminal liability of legal persons is advanced, it is not functional as no specific procedures on the criminal liability of legal persons have been adopted in the Criminal Procedure Code. The Criminal Code is not self-executing law: each liability or measure in the Criminal Code has to be regulated with the Criminal Procedure Code.

Azerbaijan's national domestic legislation complies with the requirements of UNCAC's Article 29 (Statute of limitations). Article 75 of the Azerbaijani Criminal Code indicates that a person shall be released from criminal liability if the following time limits have expired since the commission of the act: 
* two years after the commission of a crime not representing big public danger
* seven years after the commission of a less-grave crime 
* twelve (12) years after the commission of a grave crime
* twenty (20) years after the commission of an especially grave crime. 
The Criminal Code specifies that the limitation period is to be counted from the day the crime is committed to the time the court verdict is entered. If a new crime is committed, the limitation period for each crime should be counted separately. The statute of limitations should be stopped if the accused is evading the investigation for the court trial. In this situation, the limitation period should be resumed at the time of detaining the accused or his/her acknowledgement of guilt.

=== Preventive anti-corruption legislation ===
UNCAC's Article 5 (Preventive anti-corruption policies and practices) requires member states to develop and implement or to maintain effective, coordinated anti-corruption policies. In the last 10 years, the Azerbaijani government has adopted five anti-corruption programs:
* State Program on Combating Corruption (2004–2006)
* National Strategy on Increasing Transparency and Fighting Against Corruption (2007–2011)
* National Anti-Corruption Action Plan (2012–2015)
* National Action Plan for Promoting Open Government (2012–2015)
* National Action Plan for Promoting Open Government (2016–2018)
It should be noted that all state programs and action plans were adopted with Presidential Decrees. In the state programs, key anti-corruption laws were adopted; the specialized ACAs began functioning; reforms were implemented in state institutions; and efficient cooperative relationships with CSOs were established. Azerbaijan has ratified all international documents on the fight against corruption. The implemented reforms have positively impacted on economic development, with Azerbaijan becoming a world leader in gross domestic product (GDP) during 2005–2006. As a result of the measures implemented to strengthen financial control, the state budget was dramatically increased.

Within Azerbaijan's national anti-corruption strategies, national legislation was brought into line with the requirements of international conventions on the fight against corruption. In addition, the Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure Code were amended to criminalize active/passive bribery, trading in influence, abuse of power and other corruption-related offences. These corruption offences were all included in the category of grave crimes. Furthermore, the new ''Law of 2014 on the Prevention of the Legalization of Criminally Obtained Funds or Other Property and the Financing of Terrorism'' was adopted and respective changes were made to the Criminal Code to criminalize money laundering and the financing of terrorism.

The ''Law of 2011 on Reviewing Citizens’ Appeals'' was amended to reduce the time taken in reviewing corruption-related appeals by state bodies and to receive and respond to appeals in electronic form.

One of the key preventive legislative Acts, the ''Law of 2005 on Access to Information'' was adopted on 5 December 2005. This law specified the scope of information that should be disclosed by state bodies and indicated the methods to be used for disclosing information and the types of information to be disclosed. In addition, it required state bodies to designate responsible structures or public officials to provide information regarding the work of state bodies. More than 30 laws were amended to satisfy the implementation of this law. The electronic database of Azerbaijan's national legislation was established and made publicly available.

The ''Law of 2007 on Rules of Ethics Conduct of Civil Servants'' was adopted as were ethics codes for the sectors of prosecutors, judges and employees of the Ministries of Customs and Taxes. This law provided 15 ethics conduct rules including rules: on gifts; impermissibility of acquiring material and non-material gifts, privileges and concessions; prevention of corruption; prevention of conflict of interest; and use of information and property.

Article 13 (Prevention of corruption) of the ''Law of 2007 on Rules of Ethics Conduct of Civil Servants'' indicates that a civil servant shall refuse any offered illegal material/non-material gifts or privileges. In the case that those gifts and privileges are given for reasons not depending on the actions of the civil servant, he/she should disclose them to the head of the state body and must return those benefits to the state body.

Article 14 (Prohibition on accepting gifts) of this law provides that the civil servant shall not demand or accept any gift which may influence his/her work. However, a civil servant can accept the gift as a sign of hospitality but this should not exceed the value of €30. If a civil servant is not sure whether he/she should accept the gift, he/she must consult with his/her immediate supervisor.

The '''Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia''' ({{lang-ru|Деклара́ция прав наро́дов Росси́и}}) was a document promulgated by the [[Bolshevik]] government of [[Russia]] on November 15 (November 2 by [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|Old Style]]), 1917 (signed by [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]).

The document proclaimed:

# Equality and sovereignty of peoples of Russia
# Right of peoples of Russia&amp;nbsp; of a free [[self-determination]], including [[secession]] and formation of a separate state
# Abolition of all national and religious privileges and restrictions
# Free development of national minorities and ethnographical groups populating the territory of Russia.

The meaning of the Declaration is still disputed in Russian historiography. In 1917 the Bolshevist thinking was still largely idealistic, dominated by vague ideas of "universal happiness". Also, at that moment Bolsheviks believed that the [[World revolution]] was imminent, so they did not care much about loss of territories.&amp;nbsp;

However, in the cold-war western literature, it is often argued that in fact Lenin and Stalin agreed to liberate mostly the territories they had no sovereignty over since Russia had lost them to [[Central Powers]] in 1915 and 1916. Many historians suggest that the purpose of the document was to limit the public dissent after Russia lost most of its western areas and try to complicate the matters behind the front lines. 

But in reality, the declaration had the effect of rallying some ethnic non-Russians behind the Bolsheviks. [[Latvian riflemen]] were important supporters of Bolsheviks in the early days of [[Russian Civil War]] and Latvian historians recognize the promise of sovereignty as an important reason for that. [[White movement|White Russians]] did not support self-determination and, as a result, few Latvians fought on the White side.

Actually, the right of secession was soon exercised by many nations that earlier had been incorporated into [[Imperial Russia]]. Many areas in [[Russia]] itself were also declared independent republics. [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevist Russia]] would, however, attempt to establish Soviet power in as many of those as possible. All three [[Baltic states]] experienced wars between Soviet governments aiming to establish a Communist state allied with Bolshevist Russia and non-Communist governments aiming for an independent state. The Soviet governments received direct military support from Russia. After the non-Communist side won, Russia recognized them as the legitimate governments of the Baltic states in 1920.

Russian historiography often cited the document as one of the main bases for the liberation of [[Central Europe]]an states. However, it is to be noted that [[Poland]], [[Ukraine]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Belarus]] and [[Estonia]] were either created as [[puppet state]]s by the [[Central Powers]] or liberated by the nations of the abovementioned countries themselves after the collapse of [[Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]].

== List of seceded lands ==
The following countries declared their independence soon after the Bolsheviks' declaration, establishing themselves as non-Communist states. Although the role this declaration played in their declared independence is doubtful, it eased [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevist Russia]]'s recognition of their independence. Except for Finland, all of these areas were outside of Russian sovereignty following the Austro-German successes in the [[World War I|Great War]] and were officially ceded in the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], but note that the Bolsheviks could not have known this development at the time of the Declaration.

These countries declared their independence, as Communist states, soon after the declaration:

Several other independent republics were proclaimed but happened to be short-lived:

* [[Orenburg]]
* {{flagicon image|Ingrian people.svg}} [[North Ingria]]

==Later developments==
Bolsheviks never rejected the idea of self-determination, but the Soviet Constitutions (of 1924, 1936 and 1977) limited the right of secession to the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|constituent republics]] only. In 1990 [[Lithuania]] declared its independence again, citing their right to secession as written down in the Soviet Constitution.

In 2008, they were a primary opponent of an attempt to revoke an anti-discrimination law in Maine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-06-19-maine_N.htm|title=Maine group drops push to repeal gay rights law|date=19 June 2008|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, EqualityMaine was one of the main supporters of a push to recognize [[same-sex marriage in Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressherald.com/news/gay-rights-group-honors-sponsor-of-marriage-bill_2010-03-28.html Gay rights group honors sponsor of marriage bill] March 28, 2010; Portland Press Herald&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="npr09"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103888604|title=The Nation: The Year Of Same-Sex Marriage!|last=Nichols|first=John|date=7 May 2009|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 2011, EqualityMaine and [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders]] (GLAD) announced plans to place a voter initiative in support of same-sex marriage on the state's November 2012 ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/30/gay-marriage-maine_n_887872.html|title= Gay Marriage: Maine Supporters Plan Referendum|date=June 30, 2011|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=September 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leading the effort to gather the signatures necessary for a citizen's initiative, EqualityMaine was among the lead groups of the Maine Freedom to Marry Coalition, the group that led the effort to win the right to marry for same-sex couples in Maine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2012/02/23/politics/secretary-of-state-says-same-sex-marriage-will-be-on-the-ballot/?ref=inline|title=Secretary of state says same-sex marriage will be on the ballot|date=February 23, 2012|publisher=Bangor Daily News|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, EqualityMaine announced a new, five year strategic plan. That new strategic plan focuses the organization's work on issues that affect LGBT youth, LGBT elders, LGBT people living in rural Maine and transgender Mainers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2013/07/09/news/portland/with-marriage-equality-a-success-in-maine-now-what/|title=With marriage equality a success in Maine, now what?|date=July 9, 2013|publisher=Bangor Daily News|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Equality California''''' or '''EQCA''' is a [[non-profit]] [[civil rights]] organization that advocates for the rights of [[LGBT]] people in [[California]]. It is the largest statewide LGBT organization in the United States and the largest member of the [[Equality Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=5426|title=The Bay Area Reporter Online {{!}} Political Notebook: Equality Federation welcomes new executive director|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is currently based in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eqca.org/about/office-locations/|title=Office Locations|website=www.eqca.org|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
Equality California is an umbrella organization for the Equality California Institute, a [[501(c) organization|501(c)(3)]]  organization that conducts public education programs for members of the LGBT community and the general public, as well as for healthcare workers, educators and public policymakers; and Equality California, a [[501c4|501(c)(4)]] that maintains three [[political action committee]]s (PACs), and, as of September 2016 has sponsored passage of more than 118 laws in the California Legislature expanding LGBT civil rights in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lgbtweekly.com/2016/09/07/eqcas-legislative-wrap-up-eight-wins-for-lgbt-equality/|title=EQCA's legislative wrap-up: Eight wins for LGBT equality|website=LGBT Weekly|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
Equality California's leadership includes Executive Director Rick Zbur,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/politics/2014/09/12/equality-california-new-director-rick-zbur/15535811/|title=Rick Zbur takes helm of Equality California|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is supported by the separate boards of Equality California and Equality California Institute, as well as the Equality Council, a body of LGBT community leaders and allies. Zbur retired from his senior partnership with the law firm [[Latham &amp; Watkins]], where he was the first openly gay partner, to become Equality California's executive director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eqca.org/about/our-staff/rick-zbur/|title=Rick Zbur|website=www.eqca.org|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent history ===
When Zbur assumed the position of the organization's executive director in 2014, a rapid string of LGBT civil rights victories&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21623671-week-americas-supreme-court-dealt-supporters-gay-marriage-great-victory-we-look|title=So far, so fast|date=2014-10-11|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; made it clear that a victory in the two-decade struggle to win marriage equality appeared imminent and that the priorities of LGBT organizations would have to evolve if they were to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://prospect.org/article/what-do-when-i-do-done|title=What to Do When &amp;amp;#039;I Do&amp;amp;#039; Is Done|newspaper=The American Prospect|access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/nation/article/After-marriage-LGBT-activists-prepare-for-next-6353754.php|title=After marriage, LGBT activists prepare for next challenge|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2014, months before the historic 2015 [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision in [[Obergefell v.

The organization divided its new mission and its programs into three areas: ending LGBT disparities in health and well-being, advancing the civil rights and acceptance of LGBT people and achieving a fair and just society for LGBT people and all the communities of which they are a part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=71124|title=Bay Area Reporter|last=Hemmelgarn|first=Seth|date=December 10, 2015|work=EQCA's new focus draws attention|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] focus has led the organization to initiate programs and take positions on issues that have not traditionally been a focus of LGBT civil rights organizations, including filing an [[Amicus curiae|''amicus'' brief]] in ''[[United States v.

=== Early history ===
The California Alliance for Pride and Equality (CAPE) was founded in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/documents/item/365282-1024-california-alliance-for-pride-and-equality|title=1024 California Alliance for Pride and Equality - ProPublica|website=www.propublica.org|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the CAPE Foundation was launched in 2000 to expand education and outreach efforts. In 2003, the organizations became Equality California, the Equality California Institute and Equality California Political Action Committee. During that time, the organization grew exponentially under the leadership of Executive Director Geoffrey Kors. In 2004, Equality California merged with [[Marriage Equality California]] in order to better coordinate efforts to pass marriage equality legislation in California. From Marriage Equality USA, EQCA subsumed both the local grassroots organizing chapters of MECA throughout California, as well as hiring their volunteer leadership to become the field staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eqca.org/site/apps/nl/content2.asp?c=9oINKWMCF&amp;b=40338&amp;ct=1635865 |title=Equality California - old |publisher=Eqca.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new consolidated programs became a co-branded joint project of EQCA and MECA under the direction of [[Molly McKay]] and Geoffrey Kors. For several years local chapters and staff worked as part of the joint project, until eventually the decision was made to drop joint branding and the program became the Equality California field team.

In 2006, Equality California Institute launched "Let California Ring,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.letcaliforniaring.org/site/c.ltJTJ6MQIuE/b.3793463/k.BE14/Home.htm|title=Home  -  Let California Ring|website=www.letcaliforniaring.org|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;" an educational campaign aimed at swaying public opinion on marriage equality. Let California Ring produced the well-received "Garden Wedding" ad, which aired only in the Santa Barbara media market as part of a study of the effect of various messages on public opinion. It was credited with a 11-point jump in support for marriage equality in the study area, and, in fact, Santa Barbara was the only county in Southern California to vote against [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/12/the-marriage-plot-inside-this-years-epic-campaign-for-gay-equality/265865/|title=The Marriage Plot: Inside This Year's Epic Campaign for Gay Equality|last=Ball|first=Molly|newspaper=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Equality California was an organizational plaintiff in ''[[In re Marriage Cases]],'' a consolidation of lawsuits filed by the [[National Center for Lesbian Rights]] (NCLR), [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), [[Lambda Legal]], several law firms and a number of individuals challenging California’s marriage laws that excluded same-sex couples. The California Supreme Court on May 15, 2008 ruled that California same-sex couples had a right to marry under the [[Constitution of California|California Constitution]]. Same-sex couples were able to marry as of June 17, 2008. Voters amended the state constitution to prohibit same-sex couples from marrying in November of that year with the passage of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3937550/same-sex-marriage-supreme-court-timeline/|title=See an Interactive Timeline of the Long Path to Marriage Equality|last=Zorthian|first=Julia|website=TIME.com|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equality California PACs ===

==== Candidates PAC ====
The stated purpose of Equality California's Candidate PAC is to "achieve equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Californians by supporting candidates who share the goals and objectives of Equality California and opposing candidates who do not " by working to elect openly LGBT and pro-LGBT candidates to state and local office across California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eqca.org/our-endorsements/equality-california-pacs/|title=Equality California PACs|website=www.eqca.org|access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the state level, the organization endorses LGBT and allied candidates with a 100-percent record of supporting LGBT issues, and, in the case of incumbent legislative candidates, a history of scoring 100 percent on Equality California's "[http://lgbtweekly.com/2016/10/09/equality-california-endorses-three-lgbt-allies-for-california-legislature/ Equality Scorecard]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lgbtweekly.com/2016/10/09/equality-california-endorses-three-lgbt-allies-for-california-legislature/|title=Equality California endorses three LGBT allies for California Legislature|website=LGBT Weekly|access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, that requirement of 100-percent support led Equality California to take the unusual step of revoking its endorsement of six state legislators, following  their abstentions or opposition in a key vote on SB 1146.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-updates-lgbt-group-withdraws-endorsements-from-1474419459-htmlstory.html|title=Essential Politics September archives: Brown signs new laws and issues vetoes, fall campaigns heat up|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also endorses openly LGBT candidates at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=71942|title=The Bay Area Reporter Online {{!}} Online Extra: Political Notes: EQCA endorses 3 Oakland lesbian candidates|newspaper=Bay Area Reporter|access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2549">The '''Estonian Provisional Government''' ({{lang-et|Eesti Ajutine Valitsus}}) was formed on February 24, 1918, by the [[Salvation Committee]] appointed by ''[[Maapäev]]'', the Estonian Province Assembly. 

==History==
The Provisional Government was led by [[Konstantin Päts]]. [[Jüri Vilms]] was appointed minister of justice, [[Jaan Poska]] minister of foreign affairs, [[Juhan Kukk]] minister of finance, Jaan Raamot minister of food and agriculture, [[Andres Larka]] minister of war. Villem Maasik was minister of labour and welfare, Ferdinand Peterson minister of roads and Peeter Põld minister of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical Dictionary of Estonia |last=Miljan |first=Toivo |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8108-4904-4 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKWRct15XfkC&amp;pg=PA224 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main functions of the Provisional Government were lobbying for diplomatic recognition for Estonian independence abroad, oppose the German occupation of Estonia and organise elections to the [[Estonian Constituent Assembly]].

After the formation of the Provisional Government the country was occupied by German troops and became administered by [[Ober Ost]]. As the result of [[German revolution]] and capitulation of Germany in [[World War I]] on November 11,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Constitutional Law of 10 EU Member States |last=Kortmann |first=C.|authorlink= |author2=J.

The Estonian Provisional Government resigned on May 8, 1919, after the Estonian Constituent Assembly had met on April 23, 1919, and the first elected government of the [[Republic of Estonia]] took office.

'''Export subsidy''' is a government policy to encourage export of goods and discourage sale of goods on the domestic [[Market (economics)|market]] through direct payments, low-cost [[loans]], tax relief for exporters, or government-financed international advertising. An export subsidy reduces the price paid by foreign importers, which means [[Domestic market|domestic]] consumers pay more than foreign consumers. The [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) prohibits most subsidies directly linked to the volume of [[exports]], except for [[Least Developed Countries|LDCs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/agrm8_e.htm Anti-dumping, subsidies, safeguards: contingencies, etc], Understanding the WTO: The Agreements&lt;/ref&gt; Incentives are given by the government of a country to exporters to encourage export of goods.  

Export subsidies are also generated when internal price supports, as in a guaranteed minimum price for a [[commodity]], create more production than can be consumed internally in the country. (These [[price]] supports are often coupled with import tariffs, which keeps the domestic price high by discouraging or taxing imports on the difference between the world price and the mandatory minimum.) Instead of letting the commodity rot or destroying it, the government exports it. [[Saudi Arabia]] is a net exporter of [[wheat]], [[Japan]] often is a net exporter of [[rice]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

At the WTO's Tenth Ministerial Conference, which was held in [[Nairobi, Kenya]] from 15 to 19 December 2015, the WTO member states agreed to eliminate export subsidies for agricultural products; least-developed nations have until the end of 2018 to eliminate agricultural export subsidies (until 1 January 2017 in relation to cotton exports), while developed nations agreed to eliminate most such subsidies immediately.

Export subsidies can cause [[inflation]]: the government subsidises the industry based on costs, but an increase in the subsidy is directly spent on wage hikes demanded by employees. Now the wages in the subsidised [[industry]] are higher than elsewhere, which causes the other employees demand higher [[wage]]s, which are then reflected in prices, resulting in inflation everywhere in the [[economy]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Some countries provide indirect export subsidies in the form of tax reductions. In the United States closely held exporters of U.S. made goods may get a reduction of tax using an Interest Charge Domestic International Sales Corporation (IC-DISC).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aicpa.org/Publications/TaxAdviser/2012/October/Pages/clinic-story-05.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Food, Inc.''''' is a 2008 American [[documentary film]] directed by filmmaker [[Robert Kenner]].&lt;ref name="Severson"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/movies/07seve.html Severson, Kim. "Eat, Drink, Think, Change."] ''[[The New York Times]].'' June 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The film examines [[corporate farming]] in the [[United States]], concluding that [[agribusiness]] produces food that is unhealthy, in a way that is environmentally harmful and abusive of both animals and employees. The film is narrated by [[Michael Pollan]] and [[Eric Schlosser]].&lt;ref name="Biancolli"&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/06/12/MVE1184DN6.DTL Biancolli, Amy.

June 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film received positive responses and was nominated for several awards, including the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Academy Award]] and the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Documentary Feature|Independent Spirit Awards]] in 2009, both for Best Documentary Feature.

==Content==
The film's first segment examines the industrial production of meat (chicken, beef, and pork), calling it inhumane and economically and environmentally [[sustainability|unsustainable]]. The second segment looks at the [[Intensive farming|industrial production of grains and vegetables]]  (primarily corn and soy beans), again labeling this economically and environmentally unsustainable. The film's third and final segment is about the economic and legal power, such as [[food labeling regulations]], of the major food companies, the profits of which are based on supplying cheap but contaminated food, the heavy  use of petroleum-based chemicals (largely pesticides and fertilizers), and the promotion of unhealthy food consumption habits by the American public.&lt;ref name="Severson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Troubling"&gt;"New Film Offers Troubling View of US Food Industry." ''[[Associated Press]].'' June 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
It shows companies like [[Wal-Mart]] transitioning towards organic foods as that industry is booming in the recent health movement.

==Production==
[[Michael Pollan]] was a consultant and appears in the film. [[Eric Schlosser]] co-produced and appears in the film. [[Participant Media]] was the production company.&lt;ref name="Severson" /&gt; The film took three years to make.&lt;ref name="Simmons"&gt;[http://www.thisisbrandx.com/2009/06/what-really-goes-into-the-bag-behind-the-movie-food-inc.html Simmons, Krista.

June 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There is some dispute as to how long the film was in production. In another interview, director Robert Kenner claims the film took six years to make.

June 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Director Kenner claims that he spent large amounts of his budget on legal fees to try to protect himself against lawsuits from industrial food producers, pesticide and fertilizer manufacturers, and other companies criticized in the film.&lt;ref name="Simmons" /&gt;

An extensive marketing campaign was undertaken to promote the film. A [[Food, Inc.

The film's director, Robert Kenner, has denied attacking the current system of producing food, noting in one interview: "All we want is transparency and a good conversation about these things."  In the same interview, he went on to say, "...the whole system is made possible by government subsidies to a few huge crops like corn. It's a form of [[socialism]] that's making us sick."&lt;ref name="Birdsall"&gt;[http://blogs.sfweekly.com/foodie/2009/06/a_conversation_with_food_inc_d.php Birdsall, John.

==Critical reception==
The film has been highly rated by critics collectively, with a combined rating of 95% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/food_inc/ "Food, Inc. (2009)" RottenTomatoes.com ] Accessed 2010-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt; and 80 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/foodinc?q=food%20inc "Food, Inc." Metacritic.com No date.] Accessed 2009-11-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Staten Island Advance]]'' called the documentary "excellent" and "sobering", concluding: "Documentaries work when they illuminate, when they alter how we think, which renders ''Food, Inc.'' a solid success, and a must-see."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silive.com/entertainment/tvfilm/index.ssf/2009/06/food_inc_moon_top_this_weeks_a.html Hill, Todd. "'Food, Inc.,' 'Moon' Top This Week's Alternatives to Mainstream Movies."] ''[[Staten Island Advance]].'' June 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' called it "terrifying" and "frankly riveting".&lt;ref name="Braun" /&gt; The ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'' was equally positive, calling the film "visually stylish" and "One of the year’s most important films..."&lt;ref name="Drake"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/entertainment/Heres-why-food-is-factory-fresh-47882367.html |title=Drake, Rossiter.

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', too, praised ''Food, Inc.'s'' cinematography, and called the film "eloquent" and "essential viewing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/la-et-food12-2009jun12,0,307895.story Goldstein, Gary. "Movie Review: 'Food, Inc.'" ''Los Angeles Times.'' June 12, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]'' noted that despite the film's focus on American food manufacture, the film is worth viewing by anyone living in a country where large-scale food production occurs.&lt;ref name="Chesterman" /&gt; The paper's reviewer declared ''Food, Inc.'' "must-see", but also cautioned that some of the scenes are "not for the faint of heart".&lt;ref name="Chesterman" /&gt; 

The ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' noted that other documentaries and books have examined similar issues before; however, the film was still worth seeing: "The food-conglomerate angle was covered in a less-ambitious documentary called ''[[King Corn (film)|King Corn]],'' and a more-ambitious documentary called ''[[The Corporation (2003 film)|The Corporation]]'' touched on the menace of the multinationals; but this one hits the sweet spot, and it does it with style."&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;[http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/entertainment/reviews.nsf/movie/story/8F061D73E70A33C2862575DF007717B4?OpenDocument Williams, Joe.

June 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The review concluded that the most powerful portion of the film focused on Monsanto's pursuit of legal action against farmers it accuses of improperly saving and reselling or replanting Monsanto’s patented seed, in violation of a signed stewardship agreement and contract not to save and resell or replant seeds produced from the crops they grow from Monsanto seed.&lt;ref name="MonsantoResponse" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt;

The Environmental Blog sympathized with the film's message and urged viewers to "vote to change this system,"&lt;ref name="enviroblog"&gt;[http://www.theenvironmentalblog.org/2009/12/food-inc-review/ Food Inc Review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026175821/http://www.theenvironmentalblog.org/2009/12/food-inc-review/ |date=October 26, 2011 }} - The Environmental Blog&lt;/ref&gt; but other reviews have not been as positive. A commentator at ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine found the film compelling but incomplete. The picture, the reviewer found, "fails to address how we might feed the country—or world" on the sustainable agriculture model advocated by the filmmakers, and that it failed to address critical issues of cost and access.&lt;ref name="Ruiz" /&gt; A reviewer for ''[[The Washington Times]]'' said the movie was "hamstrung" because few corporate executives wished to be interviewed by those documentarians, although the reviewer agreed that the film was aiming for balance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jun/19/edge-moore-worry-haunts-cinema/ Bunch, Sonny.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26335">In different administrative and organizational forms, the '''Food for Peace''' program of the United States has provided food assistance around the world for more than 50 years. Approximately 3 billion people in 150 countries have benefited directly from U.S. food assistance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/2018/05/america-overseas-food-aid-regulations-decrease-generosity/|title=Reforming U.S. Food Aid Can Feed Millions More at the Same Cost|work=National Review|date=May 14, 2018|accessdate=July 27, 2018|first=Brett|last=Schaefer}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The '''Office of Food for Peace''' within the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) is the [[Federal Government of the United States|U.S. Government's]] largest provider of overseas food assistance. The food assistance programming is funded primarily through the Food for Peace Act. The Office of Food for Peace also receives International Disaster Assistance Funds through the [[Foreign Assistance Act]] (FAA) that can be used in emergency settings (more information below).

While U.S. food aid started out in the 1950s as a means to donate surplus U.S. commodities, the U.S. government moved away from this decades ago, and now purchases food from American farmers through a competitive process. The Office of Food for Peace donates food based on an identified need, in close consultation with the host government requesting the assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usaid.gov/food-assistance/faq|title=U.S. Agency for International Development, Food Aid Frequently Asked Questions|work=USAID|date=April 12, 2018|accessdate=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2010s the program underwent revisions offered by in the Administration's Fiscal Year 2014 budget{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. These revisions would change the program to provide cash donations rather than American grown and delivered food. On April 24, 2013, the chairman of [[USA Maritime]], a coalition of carriers and maritime unions, wrote a statement which discussed the efficacy of the program and specifically the importance of the U.S. Merchant Marine in delivering the U.S. food aid to people who are undernourished around the world. Henry cited the fact that USAID's own data actually revealed that the traditional efforts to deliver food as opposed to cash transfers for countries to buy their own food is actually 78 percent cheaper per ton of food. Henry offers that this is a significant fact in the effort to address global hunger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bridgedeck.org/forms/USA-Maritime-Food-for-Peace-press-release-24-April-2013.pdf Statement of USA Maritime of Proposed Changes to the Food For Peace Program 2013], Retrieved June 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early history of United States food assistance ==
America's food assistance programs began in 1812 when [[James Madison]] sent emergency aid to earthquake victims in Venezuela. As director of the [[American Relief Administration]], Herbert Hoover led a $20 million feeding program in Russia during the 1920s under the [[Russian Famine Relief Act]]. In 1949, the United States launched the [[Marshall Plan]], which provided large quantities of food aid commodities to the people of Western Europe. The Marshall Plan helped rejuvenate and unite Europe while laying the foundations for a permanent U.S. food assistance program. Many of the European countries the U.S. Government helped at that time have since become major food exporters and important international donors.

== Authorizing legislation ==

=== Public Law 480 (1954) ===
On July 10, 1954, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] signed the [[Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954|Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act]] — or Public Law (P.L.) 480 — an action which simultaneously created the Office of Food for Peace. By signing this legislation, the President laid "the basis for a permanent expansion of our exports of agricultural products with lasting benefits to ourselves and peoples of other lands." The bill, a solution for food deficient, cash-poor countries, created a secondary foreign market by allowing food-deficient countries to pay for American food imports in their own currencies instead of in U.S. dollars. The law's original purpose was to expand international trade, to promote the economic stability of American agriculture, to make maximum use of surplus agricultural commodities in the furtherance of foreign policy, and to stimulate the expansion of foreign trade in agricultural commodities produced in the United States.&lt;ref name=Eisenhower/&gt;

=== Kennedy era and Food for Peace Act (1966) ===
[[File:JFKennedy GeorgeMcGovern.jpg|thumb|right|George McGovern as Food for Peace director in 1961, with President John F. Kennedy]]
In 1961, President [[John F. Kennedy]] termed the law "Food for Peace," stating, "Food is strength, and food is peace, and food is freedom, and food is a helping hand to people around the world whose good will and friendship we want."&lt;ref name="JFK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=74154 |title=`Remarks of Senator John F. Kennedy, Corn Palace, Mitchell, SD', September 22, 1960 |editor1=Peters, Gerhard |editor2=Woolley, John T |publisher = University of California - Santa Barbara |work= The American Presidency Project |accessdate= July 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through new amendments, the law switched its focus from disposing of surplus agricultural commodities to addressing humanitarian needs and responding to growing food crisis demands. In signing the extension of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act in 1959, President Eisenhower criticized the shortcomings of the amendment.  He specifically referred to the extension as the Food for Peace program.  Although Kennedy may have expanded the program, he was not the first to refer to the program as Food for Peace.&lt;ref name=Eisenhower&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=11519 |title=Dwight D.

Former U.S. Representative from South Dakota [[George McGovern]] was picked to become a Special Assistant to the President and first director of Kennedy's high-priority Food for Peace program, which realized what McGovern had been advocating in the House.&lt;ref name="cby-266"&gt;''Current Year Biography 1967'', p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; McGovern assumed the post on January 21, 1961.&lt;ref name="jfk-let"/&gt;

As director, McGovern urged the greater use of food to enable foreign economic development, saying, "We should thank God that we have a food abundance and use the over-supply among the under-privileged at home and abroad."&lt;ref name="nyt-mitn-61"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FA0E15FD3E5D1B728DDDA80B94DB405B818AF1D3 | title=Man in the News: George Stanley McGovern: Friend of Farmers | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 31, 1961 | page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found space for the program in the [[Old Executive Office Building|Executive Office Building]] rather than be subservient to either the [[U.S. Department of State]] or [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, ''A Thousand Days'', p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; McGovern worked with deputy director [[James W. Symington]] and Kennedy advisor [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]] in visiting South America to discuss surplus grain distribution, and attended meetings of the United Nations' [[Food and Agriculture Organization]].&lt;ref name="cby-266"/&gt;

By the close of 1961, the Food for Peace program was operating in a dozen countries,&lt;ref name="cby-266"/&gt; and 10 million more people had been fed with American surplus than the year before.{{sfn|Anson, McGovern|1972|pp=110-113}} In February 1962, McGovern visited India and oversaw a greatly expanded [[school lunch]] program thanks to Food for Peace; subsequently one in five Indian schoolchildren would be fed from it,{{sfn|Anson, McGovern|1972|pp=110-113}} and by mid-1962, 35 million children around the world.{{sfn|Knock, Feeding the World|2000|p=107}} During an audience in Rome, [[Pope John XXIII]] warmly praised McGovern's work.{{sfn|Anson, McGovern|1972|pp=110-113}}{{sfn|Knock, Feeding the World|2000|pp=114-115}}

McGovern resigned his post on July 18, 1962, wanting to resume his electoral political career.&lt;ref name="cby-266"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jfk-let"/&gt; Kennedy said that under McGovern, the program had "become a vital force in the world", improving living conditions and economies of allies and creating "a powerful barrier to the spread of Communism".&lt;ref name="jfk-let"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=8773 | title=Letter Accepting Resignation of George McGovern as Director of the food for Peace Program | author=Kennedy, John F. | publisher=[[The White House]] | date=July 18, 1962 | authorlink=John F.

McGovern was succeeded by [[Richard W. Reuter]], who had been the executive director of [[CARE]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newspapers.com/image/90817282/?terms=%22food%2Bfor%2Bpeace%22%2Bmcgovern%2Bresigned&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1965, during the [[Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon B.

=== Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act (1990) ===
In 1990, the U.S. Congress passed, and President [[George H.W. Bush]] signed into law the first comprehensive restatement and reorganization of P.L. 480 in the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act (the 1990 Farm Bill). This bill made a significant change in the overall focus of P.L. 480. Once seen as simply an aspect of foreign policy, P.L. 480 now has food security as a primary goal.

=== Food for Peace Act (2008) ===
In 2008, the Food for Peace Act formally replaced the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. Programs are authorized, along with all U.S. agricultural programs, through the Farm Bill which Congress typically amends and reauthorizes every five years.

The purpose of the Food for Peace Act is to:

*Combat world hunger and malnutrition and their causes
*Promote broad-based, equitable and sustainable development, including agricultural development
*Expand international trade
*Foster and encourage the development of private enterprise and democratic participation in developing countries 
*Prevent conflicts

The Food for Peace Act includes four sections, referred to as titles, which regulate food aid commodities and development and relief support. The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) manages Title I, while USAID manages Titles II, III and V.

*'''Title I: Economic Assistance and Food Security'''—governs concessional sales of U.S. agricultural commodities to developing countries and private entities
*'''Title II: Emergency and Private Assistance Programs'''—provide for the direct donation of U.S. agricultural commodities for emergency relief and development programs
*'''Title III: Food for Development'''—provides government-to-government grants of agricultural commodities, which are tied to policy reform
*'''Title IV: General Authorities and Requirements''' – establishes prohibited uses including no aid to human rights violators, no aid to military, and no competition with U.S. producers
*'''Title V: John Ogonowski and Doug Bereuter Farmer-to-Farmer (FTF) Program'''—-provides voluntary technical assistance to farmers, farm groups, and agribusinesses.
*'''Title VI: Enterprise for the America's Initiative''' – official debt relief linking Food for Peace and AID debt owed to the United States to the promulgation of structural adjustment and open investment policies

== Title I: Economic Assistance and Food Security (USDA)==
The Title I authority of the Food for Peace Act is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and provides funding for a concessional sales program and the Food for Progress grant program.

The concessional sales program supports trade and development. The primary objective of the concessional sales component is to provide food assistance to targeted developing countries to promote economic growth. The 1996 Farm Bill modified Title I concessional loans to allow USDA to enter into loan agreements with private entities in addition to its government-to-government mandate. As a result, the new goal of the Title I program was to prioritize areas that had the potential to become commercial markets for U.S. agricultural commodities.

Food for Progress authorizes the [[Commodity Credit Corporation]] (CCC) to finance the sale and export of agricultural commodities to development countries and emerging democracies on credit terms, or on a grant basis, to support developing countries and countries that are emerging democracies and have made commitments to introduce or expand free enterprise elements into their agricultural economies.

Since fiscal year 2006, new funding has not been requested because demand for food assistance using credit financing has fallen or grant programs have been a more appropriate tool.

== Title II: Emergency and Development Food Assistance Programs (USAID) ==
Title II is administered by the USAID Office of Food for Peace as authorized in the Food for Peace Act which states

&lt;blockquote&gt;the Administrator may provide agricultural commodities to meet emergency food needs under this title through governments and public or private agencies […] The Administrator may provide agricultural commodities for nonemergency assistance under this title through eligible organizations.&lt;ref name="Food for Peace Act"&gt;[http://www.fas.usda.gov/excredits/foodaid/pl480/Food_for_Peace_Act.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It authorizes use of U.S. agricultural commodities for both emergency and development food assistance programs to:

*Address famine or other urgent relief requirements
*Combat malnutrition
*Alleviate the causes of hunger, mortality, and morbidity
*Promote economic and community development
*Promote sound environmental practices
*Carry out feeding programs

Title II emergency and development programs have provided more than 106 million metric tons of commodities to more than 3 billion people in 150 countries. Title II programs respond to emergencies and focus on reducing food insecurity in vulnerable populations as well as improving resilience to shocks, by incorporating many activities to strengthen local capacity to prevent and respond to natural disasters.

Since 2011, the Office of Food for Peace has begun work to reformulate its food commodities to make them more nutritious.  These reformulated products are used for both emergency and development programs.

== Title III: Food for Development (USAID) ==
The Food for Peace Title III program is a USAID-administered tool for enhancing food security and supporting long-term economic development in the least-developed countries. When funded, the USG donates agricultural commodities to the recipient country and funds their transportation to the point of entry in the recipient country. These commodities are sold on the domestic market and the revenue generated from their sale is used to support and implement economic development and food security programs.

Funds were last requested or appropriated for Title III before 2000.

== Title IV: General Authorities and Requirements ==
Title IV of the Food for Peace Act authorizes active participation of the private sector in storage, marketing, transport and distribution. It requires multi-year agreements and an annual report to Congress. Title IV also contains debt forgiveness provisions and establishes the prohibited uses of food aid, which are:

*No aid to human rights violators (can be waived in emergency situations)
*No aid to military
*No competition with U.S. producers

== Title V: John Ogonowski and Doug Bereuter Farmer-to-Farmer (F2F) Program (USAID) ==
Title V funds the Farmer-to-Farmer Program which was authorized in the [[Food Security Act of 1985]]. The U.S. Congress authorized the FY 2008-2012 phase of the Farmer-to-Farmer Program in the 2008 Food for Peace Act, designating it the "John Ogonowski and Doug Bereuter Farmer-to-Farmer Program" in honor of Ogonowski, one of the pilots killed on September 11, 2001, and former Congressman Bereuter, who initially sponsored the program.

The Farmer-to-Farmer Program provides voluntary technical assistance to farmers, farm groups and agribusinesses in developing and transitional countries to promote sustainable improvements in food processing, production and marketing. The program relies on the expertise of volunteers from U.S. farms, land grant universities, cooperatives, private agribusinesses and nonprofit farm organizations to respond to the needs of host-country farmers and organizations.

== Title VI: Enterprise for the America's Initiative ==
Title VI of the Food for Peace Act authorizes official debt relief. It links Food for Peace and AID debt owed to the United States to the promulgation of structural adjustment and open investment policies. Title VI is administered by the [http://www.treasury.gov Department of the Treasury].

== Related legislation ==
*'''Food for Progress Act of 1985'''—allows for commodity donations to be available to emerging democracies and developing countries committed to the introduction or expansion of free enterprise in their agricultural economies.
*'''Section 416 of the Agricultural Act of 1949'''—establishes the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program which consists of donations of U.S. agricultural products, as well as financial and technical assistance, for school feeding and maternal and child nutrition projects in low-income countries. It also provides for overseas donations of surplus food and feed grain owned by the USDA Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC).
*'''Africa: Seeds of Hope Act of 1988: Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust'''—creates a food reserve administered under the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture. This reserve is available to meet emergency humanitarian food needs in developing countries, allowing the United States to respond to unanticipated food crises. Under the 2008 Food for Peace Act, the Administrator of USAID oversees release and use of these funds.

== Food for Peace programs ==

=== Emergency programs ===
USAID's Office of Food for Peace manages two programs to support emergency food assistance efforts. Emergency programs authorized under Title II of the Food for Peace Act provide in-kind commodities and associated costs. Emergency programs implemented by Food for Peace using International Disaster Assistance Funds (called the Emergency Food Security Program, or EFSP) provide cash that can be used for local and regional purchase of food and other interventions such as food vouchers and cash transfers. Title II is authorized by the Food for Peace Act, while EFSP is authorized under the [[Foreign Assistance Act]] (FAA). EFSP is deployed to respond to the highest priority emergency food security needs as a complement to Title II in-kind food aid. Both programs provide emergency food assistance to address needs arising from natural disasters, such as floods or droughts, and complex emergencies, which are often characterized by insecurity and population displacement.

=== Development programs ===
The Office of Food for Peace manages development food assistance programs through Title II of the Food for Peace Act, which target the underlying causes of hunger and malnutrition, including interventions in health and nutrition, agriculture, and water and sanitation, among others. These programs focus on approximately 20 priority countries determined based on the weighted average of the country ranking under three food security indicators:
*Percent of children stunted
*Percent of population living on less than $1.25 per day
*Percent of population undernourished

Additional considerations such as security conditions also factor into countries selected.

==== International Food Relief Partnership (IFRP) ====
The International Food Relief Partnership (IFRP) is a sub-program of Title II food assistance. IFRP provides small grants to predominantly faith-based groups working on nutritional support programs. IFRP allows for the transportation, delivery, and distribution of shelf-stable prepackaged foods overseas and the establishment and maintenance of stockpiles of the foods in the United States.

== USAID's Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) ==
USAID's Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) works with other U.S. Government agencies to monitor, collect, analyze and disseminate critical data and information on conditions of food availability and access in the most food insecure countries. These agencies include the U.S. Geological Survey, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and U.S. Department of Agriculture. FEWS NET provides decision-makers in the U.S. Government, host country governments, and a variety of other regional and international partners timely, unbiased, and insightful early warning and vulnerability information.

'''"Hail, America"''' is a regal [[concert march]] composed by [[George Drumm]]. It is known for its fanfare and [[trio (music)|trio]] sections performed during the presidential entrance at state dinners, but is not to be confused with ''[[Hail to the Chief]]'', the president's arrival march. It has also been used as the honors music for the [[President-Elect of the United States]].

==Background==
"Hail, America" was composed by George Drumm, a German immigrant to the United States, in 1917 and first publicly performed during a concert in [[New York City]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Most Brilliant Season for Symphony Orchestra Forecast|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/181441616/|accessdate=January 28, 2017|work=[[Minneapolis Star-Tribune]]|date=October 26, 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EKD"/&gt; Drumm appears to have composed the march to rebut questions as to his national loyalty after the [[1917 United States declaration of war on Germany|United States declaration of war on Germany]]. According to Drumm, he wrote the march while riding the [[New York City Subway|subway]] between [[Manhattan]] and [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name="Rhein"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heimerl|first1=Stefan|title=Georg Drumm, der Autodidakt|url=http://storys.rheinpfalz.de/georg-drumm-der-autodidakt|accessdate=January 24, 2017|work=[[Die Rheinpfalz]]|date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Drumm, Composer|url=http://www.germany.travel/en/ms/german-originality/heritage/famous-people/music/george-drumm-composer.html|website=German National Tourism Bureau|publisher=Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy|accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dwight Eisenhower]] preferred "Hail, America" to the traditional arrival march "[[Hail to the Chief]]" and ordered it performed at the 1953 and 1957 inaugurations to introduce him. Beginning with [[John F. Kennedy]], the use of "Hail to the Chief" was resumed.&lt;ref name="EKD"&gt;{{cite web|title=Palatine Emigrant Is Composer of US Presidential Hymn - or Is He?|url=https://www.ekd.de/english/4250-edi_160109_drummer.html|website=EKD|publisher=[[Evangelical Church in Germany]]|accessdate=January 25, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202061558/https://www.ekd.de/english/4250-edi_160109_drummer.html|archivedate=February 2, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:"Hail, America" Trump inauguration.ogv|thumb|"Hail, America", performed during the platform entrance of [[Donald Trump]] during the 2017 United States presidential inauguration]]
The trio section of "Hail, America" was performed to introduce then President-Elect [[Barack Obama]] during the 2009 U.S. presidential inauguration and, eight years later, to introduce then President-Elect [[Donald Trump]] at the 2017 U.S. presidential inauguration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Inaugural Prelude|date=2017|publisher=[[U.S. Marine Band]]|url=http://www.marineband.marines.mil/Portals/175/Docs/Programs/170120_prelude_rev2.pdf?ver=2017-01-19-103101-447|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Inaugural Prelude|date=2009|publisher=[[U.S. Marine Band]]|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidential entrance==
"Hail, America" is performed by [[U.S. Marine Band|"the President's Own" United States Marine Band]] during a short transit ceremony by which the [[President of the United States]] moves from the second floor to the state floor of the White House on official occasions. In the ceremony, the president, the [[First Lady of the United States]] and, if applicable, a guest of honor and the guest of honor's spouse, descend the [[Grand Staircase (White House)|Grand Staircase]] accompanied by a military escort advancing the [[flag of the United States]] and the [[flag of the President of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirk|first1=Elise|title=Musical Highlights from the White House|date=1992|publisher=Krieger|isbn=0894646648|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Trio_of_"Hail,_America".ogg|thumb|right|the fanfare and trio sections of "Hail, America" performed by the U.S. Marine Band]]
The Grand Staircase was reconstructed in the imperial stair form by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] specifically to serve as a stage for the presidential entrance, whose early version had the president followed by a procession of 30 attendants and dignitaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Domestic Architecture of Benjamin Henry Latrobe |publisher=[[The Johns Hopkins University Press]]  |author1=Michael W.

Snadon |year=2006 |pages=360–363|isbn=0-8018-8104-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rhein"/&gt; Cartoons at the time frequently portrayed Roosevelt descending the stairs crowned by a [[diadem]]. "Hail, America", however, did not become the musical accompaniment to the ceremony until the presidency of Eisenhower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The White House: Actors and Observers|date=2002|publisher=UPNE|isbn=9781555535476|pages=xv-xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EKD"/&gt;

Early in the presidency of [[Jimmy Carter]] the presidential entrance was scrapped as part of an effort by Carter to make White House events less formal.&lt;ref name="LBT"/&gt; During the 1977 state visit of Mexico, presidents Carter and [[José López Portillo]] descended the staircase without a military escort or the performance of "Hail, America". However, Misty Malarkey Yin Yang, [[Amy Carter]]'s cat, escaped from its room and unexpectedly joined presidents Carter and Portillo, according to one source "marching down the stairs most regally and surefooted" at the head of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bauer|first1=Stephen|title=At Ease in the White House: Social Life as Seen by a Presidential Military Aide|date=2004|publisher=Taylor Trade Publications|isbn=1589790790|page=277|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DLhkbjPpb20C&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Another source, however, seems to dispute Misty Malarkey Yin Yang's composure, reporting instead that the cat actually appeared "very confused" while leading Carter and Portillo.&lt;ref name="LBT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/30533578/|title=Informality at White House|accessdate=January 24, 2017|work=Independent Press-Telegram|date=February 20, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The performance of the presidential entrance ceremony was resurrected the following week, during the official visit of [[Canada]]. Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]], who had participated in the presidential entrance during previous visits to the United States, at the time remarked "I love coming in to that music" in reference to "Hail, America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trescott|first1=Jacqueline|title=Surprises and Flourishes At the 2nd State Dinner|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1977/02/22/surprises-and-flourishes-at-the-2nd-state-dinner/222cc9a6-eb38-4c95-9203-f2d92d13e594/|accessdate=January 24, 2017|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=February 22, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hans Carl von Carlowitz.jpg|thumb|Hans Carl von Carlowitz]]
'''Hans Carl von Carlowitz''', originally ''Hannß Carl von Carlowitz'' (24 December 1645 - 3 March 1714), was a German tax accountant and mining administrator. His book ''Sylvicultura oeconomica, oder haußwirthliche Nachricht und Naturmäßige Anweisung zur wilden Baum-Zucht'' (1713) was the first comprehensive treatise about forestry.  He is considered to be the father of sustainable yield forestry.

== Life ==
Hans Carl von Carlowitz was born in [[Chemnitz-Rabenstein|Oberrabenstein]] bei [[Chemnitz]]. He was the son of forest master Georg Carl von Carlowitz. He studied law and public administration in [[Jena]], learned foreign languages, travelled to [[France]], [[Russia]] and [[Italy]] in his youth and was engaged in the natural and mining sciences.

1677 he became a mining administrator and in 1711 he became in charge of mining at the court of Kursachsen in [[Freiberg (Sachsen)]]. Freiberg, which is located in the foot hills of the [[Erzgebirge]], was known for its [[silver mine]]s.  In this post, he was responsible, among other things, for the supply of timber to the mining industry, which employed about ten thousand miners at the time. He died in [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]].

== Importance ==
[[Image:Carlowitz Sylvicultura.jpg|thumb|250px|Cover of ''Sylvicultura oeconomica, oder haußwirthliche Nachricht und Naturmäßige Anweisung zur wilden Baum-Zucht'' of 1713]]
The idea of [[sustainability]], wherever it occurs in the history, emerges in time of crisis and scarcity. Around 1700, the mining industry and livelihood of thousands was threatened in [[Saxony]].  It was not that the mines had been exhausted of their ores, the problem was an acute scarcity of timber.  The mining industry and smelting of ores had consumed whole forests.  In the vicinity of places of mining activity the [[old growth forest]]s had disappeared completely.  Trees had been cut at unsustainable rates for decades without efforts to restore the forests.  First, the river systems in the Erzgebirge was engineered, so logs could be transported from ever more distant forest areas, but these measures only postponed the crisis.  The prices for timber rose ever more, which led to [[bankruptcy]] and closure of parts of the mining industry.
Hans Carl von Carlowitz was raised in and influenced by this environment.  He traveled widely in his youth and learned much from the forced discipline of the French minister [[Jean Baptiste Colbert]], who had enacted a forestry reform in [[France]].

His importance as author is in the fact that he was the first one who comprehensively wrote about forestry. His treatise is a compilation of the knowledge about forest management at the time.  He used his own experience to expand the scientific knowledge base that remained after the devastation of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Hans Carl von Carlowitz was the first one to clearly formulate the concept of sustainability in forestry.

{{quote|“Wird derhalben die größte Kunst/Wissenschaft/Fleiß und Einrichtung hiesiger Lande darinnen beruhen / wie eine sothane ''Conservation ''und Anbau des Holtzes anzustellen / daß es eine continuierliche beständige und nachhaltende Nutzung gebe / weiln es eine unentberliche Sache ist / ohne welche das Land in seinem Esse nicht bleiben mag.“}} (page 105-106 in the „Sylvicultura Oeconomica“).

The full title of his book loosely translated is: {{quote|„Sylvicultura Oeconomica, or the economic news and instructions for the natural growing of wild trees, besides thorough explanation how with gods good will the ever stronger scarcity of timber is to be managed by sowing, growing and planting of seedlings, also through wild and planned cultivation of a once cut and barren land can again be made useful as timber land - through the collection of seeds from seed trees, the preparation of soil for sowing and the care of seedlings.  Besides, how to multiply the timber harvest at every stage of growth, the types of broad-leaf and needle trees and their seeds, also how to manage foreign kinds of trees, and further how to fell trees and make charcoal or other uses from the wood.  To be the best utility for the heating, building, brewing, mining and smelting activities requires the careful management of sustainable forestry resources.“}}

The '''House of Deputies''' is one of the legislative houses of the [[bicameral]] [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|General Convention]] of the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]]. The other is the [[House of Bishops]].

==Membership==
Each diocese of the Episcopal Church, as well as the [[Navajoland Area Mission]] and the [[Convocation of Episcopal Churches in Europe]], are entitled to representation in the House of Deputies by four [[clergy]] deputies, either [[presbyter]]s or [[deacon]]s, canonically resident in the diocese and four [[Laity|lay]] deputies who are [[confirmation|confirmed]] [[communicant]]s in good standing.&lt;ref name=09ConstArtISec.4&gt;The Episcopal Church (2009), ''Constitution and Canons'', Constitution Article I Section 4, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each diocese chooses the manner in which deputies are chosen. They are generally elected by diocesan conventions. If a special meeting of the General Convention occurs, the deputies elected to the preceding General Convention continue to serve as deputies. If a vacancy occurs in a diocesan delegation, the diocese determines how a new deputy is chosen.&lt;ref name=09CanonI.1.3&gt;Title I Canon 1 Section 3, p. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Officers==
===President and vice president===
The House of Deputies elects a president from among its members as its [[speaker (politics)|presiding officer]].&lt;ref name=09TitleI.Canon1.Sec1.b&gt;Title I Canon 1 Section 1 (b), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; The president can be of either order. Presidents are elected every three years, taking office at the adjournment of the General Convention at which they were elected and continuing until the adjournment of the following General Convention. Individuals can be elected for up to three consecutive terms. The president appoints an advisory council and a [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|chancellor]] educated in [[secular]] and [[ecclesiastical law]] for advice and consultation. A vice president, who must be from a different order than the president, is also elected. In cases of resignation, death, or inability of the president, the vice president performs the duties of the office until a new president is elected.

The president since 2012 is Gay Clark Jennings of the [[Episcopal Diocese of Ohio|Diocese of Ohio]].&lt;ref name=HoDPresident&gt;House of Deputies, [http://houseofdeputies.org/about-the-president.html], accessed August 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; She is the first ordained woman to hold the position. The first laywoman to be elected House of Deputies president was [[Pamela Pauly Chinnis|Pamela P. Chinnis]] of the [[Episcopal Diocese of Washington|Diocese of Washington (D.C.)]] (1991–2000). The first layman to be elected to the office of President of the House of Deputies was former Supreme Court Justice [[Owen Roberts]] who served in that capacity in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, C. Rankin. "The General Convention Offices and Officers 1785–1950".&lt;/ref&gt; 

The vice president of the House of Deputies is [[Byron Rushing]] of the [[Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts]], elected on July 11, 2012.&lt;ref name=HoDVicePresident&gt;Episcopal News Service, [http://episcopaldigitalnetwork.com/ens/2012/07/11/byron-rushing-elected-vice-president-of-the-house-of-deputies/], accessed August 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secretary===
The secretary of the House of Deputies is elected every three years by majority vote at the start of each General Convention.&lt;ref name=09TitleI.Canon1.Sec1.a&gt;Title I Canon 1 Section 1 (a), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The secretary certifies deputies and keeps minutes and records of the house. In addition, the secretary also notifies the bishops and secretaries of every diocese to actions of General Convention, especially alterations to the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' and the constitution of the Episcopal Church. If the offices of president and vice president become vacant during the triennium, the secretary performs the duties of president until the next meeting of General Convention. With the approval of the house, the secretary may appoint assistant secretaries.&lt;ref name=09TitleI.Canon1.Sec1.c-i&gt;Title I Canon 1 Section 1 (c–i), pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

At each regular meeting of General Convention, the secretary of the House of Deputies is by concurrent action of both houses made the secretary of the General Convention. In this capacity, the secretary oversees the publishing of the Journal of the General Convention.&lt;ref name=09TitleI.Canon1.Sec1.j&gt;Title I Canon 1 Section 1 (j), pp. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory S. Straub was elected secretary of the House of Deputies and the General Convention in 2006.&lt;ref name=HoDsecretary&gt;The Episcopal Church, [http://generalconvention.org/officers/exec_off Executive Officer and Secretary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106153239/http://generalconvention.org/officers/exec_off |date=2011-01-06 }}, accessed January 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
In many cases, a simple majority vote of all deputies is sufficient for a motion to pass. However, the lay or clerical representation of any three dioceses may require a "vote by orders". In some cases, the constitution and canons require a vote by orders. In a vote by orders, the votes of the clerical and lay orders are counted separately. Each diocese has a single vote in each order and a majority of dioceses must vote in favor in each order for a motion to pass.&lt;ref name=09ConstArtISec.5&gt;Constitution Article I Section 5, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park''' is a large [[wildlife]] preserve and [[conservation biology|conservation]] area in southern [[Africa]]. 
The park straddles the border between [[South Africa]] and [[Botswana]] and comprises two adjoining national parks:
* Kalahari Gemsbok National Park in [[South Africa]]
* Gemsbok National Park in [[Botswana]]
The total area of the park is {{convert|38000|km2|sqmi}}. Approximately three-quarters of the park lies in [[Botswana]] and one-quarter in [[South Africa]]. ''[[wikt:Kgalagadi|Kgalagadi]]'' means "place of thirst."{{cn|date=October 2017}}

In September 2014, more than half of the [[Botswana]] portion of the park was sold for gas-fracking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barbee|first1=Jeffrey|title=Botswana sells fracking rights in national park|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/02/botswana-sells-fracking-rights-in-national-park|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and terrain==
The park is located largely within the southern [[Kalahari Desert]]. The terrain consists of red [[sand dune]]s, sparse [[vegetation]], occasional [[tree]]s, and the dry riverbeds of the [[Nossob River|Nossob]] and [[Auob River]]s. The rivers are said to flow only about once per century. However, water flows underground and provides life for grass and [[acacia|camelthorn]] trees growing in the river beds. The rivers may flow briefly after large thunderstorms.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

==Wildlife==
The park has abundant, varied wildlife. It is home to large [[mammal]]ian predators such as [[lion]]s, [[cheetah]]s, [[African leopard]]s, and [[hyena]]s. Migratory herds of large [[herbivores]] such as blue [[wildebeest]], [[Springbok (antelope)|springbok]], [[Common Eland|eland]], and red [[hartebeest]] also live and move seasonally within the park, providing sustenance for the predators. More than 200 species of bird can be found in the park, including [[vulture]]s and [[bird of prey|raptors]] such as [[eagle]]s, [[buzzard]]s, and [[secretary bird]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.travel4wildlife.com/four-secretary-bird-facts/|title=Secretary Birds in the Kgalagadi National Park|last=|first=|date=2012-11-19|work=Travel For Wildlife|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005, the protected area is considered a [[Panthera leo melanochaita|Lion]] Conservation Unit and a lion stronghold in Southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN Cat Specialist Group (2006). Conservation Strategy for the Lion ''Panthera leo'' in Eastern and Southern Africa. IUCN, Pretoria, South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weather==
The weather in the Kalahari can reach extremes. January is midsummer in southern Africa and the daytime temperatures are often in excess of {{convert|40|C|F}}. Winter nights can be quite cold with temperatures below freezing. Extreme temperatures of {{convert|-11|C|F}} and up to {{convert|45|C|F}} have been recorded. [[Precipitation]] is sparse in this desert area.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

==Facilities==
Within the park there are three traditional tourist lodges, called "rest camps". These are fully serviced lodges and include amenities such as [[air conditioning]], shops and [[swimming pool]]s. There are also six wilderness camps in the park. The wilderness camps provide little more than shelter and wash water; visitors must supply their own food, drinking water and firewood.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

==History==
The Kalahari [[Gemsbok National Park]] in [[South Africa]] was established on 31 July 1931 mainly to protect the migrating game, especially the [[gemsbok]], from poaching. In 1948 an informal verbal agreement was made between the then [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]] and the [[Union of South Africa]] to set up a conservation area in the contiguous areas of the two lands. In June 1992 representatives from the [[South African National Parks|South African National Parks Board]] Board (now SANParks) and the [[Department of Wildlife and National Parks]] of [[Botswana]] set up a joint management committee to manage the area as a single ecological unit. A management plan was drafted, reviewed, and approved in 1997. The parties agreed to cooperate in tourism and share equally in park entrance fees. On 7 April 1999, [[Botswana]] and [[South Africa]] signed a historic bilateral agreement whereby both countries undertook to manage their adjacent national parks, the Gemsbok National Park in [[Botswana]] and the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park in South Africa as a single ecological unit. The boundary between the two parks had no physical barriers, although it is also the international border between the two countries. This allowed for the free movement of animals. On 12 May 2000, [[President]] [[Festus Mogae]] of [[Botswana]] and [[President of South Africa|President]] [[Thabo Mbeki]] of [[South Africa]] formally launched Southern Africa's first [[peace park]], the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

==Cultural preservation and establishment of !Xaus Lodge==
In October 2002, the governments set aside 580&amp;nbsp;km² (224&amp;nbsp;mi²) for the use of the native peoples, the [[Bushmen|Khomani San]] and Mier communities. This was divided between 277.69&amp;nbsp;km² of San Heritage Land and 301.34&amp;nbsp;km² of Mier Heritage Land. The South African National Parks (SANParks) manages the land under contract. The settlement agreement also provided for the communities to receive funds for the specific purpose of constructing a tourism facility. The lodge was named !Xaus Lodge (meaning 'heart' in the local language) and is managed commercially on behalf of the ‡Khomani San and Mier communities by Transfrontier Parks Destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.xauslodge.co.za/about-us|title=About Us {{!}} Xaus Lodge|website=www.xauslodge.co.za|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fracking==
In September 2014, the government of Botswana quietly sold the rights to [[Fracking|frack]] for [[shale gas]] in Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. It granted prospecting licences for {{convert|29,291|km2|ha|lk=in}}, {{convert|34,435|km2|ha|lk=in}} and {{convert|23,980|km2|ha|lk=in}} – more than half of the Botswanan part of the park – to a [[United Kingdom]]-listed company called "Nodding Donkey". The sale was not reported at the time. In November 2015, the company changed its name to "Karoo Energy".&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Barbee: [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/02/botswana-sells-fracking-rights-in-national-park Botswana sells fracking rights in national park] Guardian, 2&amp;nbsp;December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Awng was born in the Kachin State in north of [[Burma]] to a small [[Christian]] minority. His Christian name was Dennis Daws, a name he later changed. Awng became a popular singer and musician in Burma during the 1980s. Due to having participated in the wave of anti-government demonstrations in 1988, that resulted in more than 3,000 dead civilians, he was forced to leave Burma and has been living in exile in [[Eidsvoll]], [[Norway]] since.&lt;ref name="Taunggyi"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,235508,00.html |title=Hard Rock |accessdate=2007-10-07 |publisher=Time Magazine | date=2002-05-06 | first=PHIL ZABRISKIE | last=Taunggyi}}&lt;/ref&gt; He fled to Norway to work with the opposition [[Democratic Voice of Burma]] radio and television broadcaster. From abroad he continued to release albums and activists sang his songs while facing down the military in both the 1996,&lt;ref name="Taunggyi" /&gt; and the [[2007 Burmese anti-government protests|2007 anti-government]]&lt;ref name="Burmas forbudte sanger" /&gt; street protests. Awng is considered a "subversive element" by the military junta in Burma.

==Music==
Awng's music is a mix of Western style rock music and east Asian ballads.&lt;ref name="Burmas forbudte sanger"/&gt; Since he flew into exile he has not produced more than two albums in the last fourteen years. Even under the scrutiny of the notorious censorship board, the [[Press Scrutiny and Registration Division|Press Scrutiny Board]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=2707 |title=And The Band Played On |accessdate=2007-10-07 |publisher=The irrawaddy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803105654/http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=2707 |archivedate=2010-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Awng managed to produce one album a year in Burma.&lt;ref name="Taunggyi"/&gt; He occasionally performs his music for Burmese exiles in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theworld.org/?q=taxonomy_by_date/2/20071004 |title=PRI's The World - Burmese musicians |accessdate=2007-10-07 |publisher=PRI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==For The Lady==
In 2004 Awng was part of a musical project to raise funds for the [[U.S. Campaign for Burma|US campaign for Democracy in Burma]]. Together with well-known pop stars such as [[U2]], [[Avril Lavigne]], [[Talib Kweli]] and more they created an album dedicated to the famous Burmese [[democracy]] activist [[Aung San Suu Kyi]]. Awng penned the album's final cut with his "Tempest of Blood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/burmese/highlights/story/2004/11/041101_for_the_lady.shtml |title=For The Lady |accessdate=2007-10-07 |publisher=BBC Burmese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309202649/http://www.bbc.co.uk/burmese/highlights/story/2004/11/041101_for_the_lady.shtml |archivedate=2005-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''NationStates''''' is a multiplayer [[Government simulation game|government simulation]] [[browser game]]. It was created by [[Max Barry]] and was publicly released on 13 November 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barry|first1=Max|title=NationStates is 2!|url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=news/2004/11/13/index.html|accessdate=25 June 2017|publisher=NationStates News|date=13 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; based loosely on his novel ''[[Jennifer Government]]''.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/16/technology/online-diary.html|title=ONLINE DIARY|last=O'Connell|first=Pamela Licalzi|date=16 January 2003|work=The New York Times|page=3|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barry founded the site as an independent vehicle publicising the book one week before its release.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;  The site continues to promote books written by Barry, but has developed to be a sizeable online community, with over 5 million user-created nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=news/2017/02/14/index.html|title= Five Miiiiiillion Nations|website=www.nationstates.net|publisher=NationStates News|author=Barry, Max|date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
In an interview, Max Barry said the influence for the game began with a questionnaire he took: "NationStates was influenced by a little political quiz I did once, where you answer a bunch of multiple-choice questions and have your politics categorised. ... It was fun, but I also wanted to see what kind of country my policies created, and have to deal with the consequences."&lt;ref name="Ewing 2003"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jody Ewing|url=http://jodyewing.com/author-interviews/max-barry/|title=Young author’s new book ‘Jennifer Government’ Headed for Big Screen|website=JodyEwing.com|publisher=Siouxland Weekender|date=16 January 2003|accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:Updated NS Graph.svg|thumb|A chart showing the game's 27 government types]]

=== "Issues" gaming ===
Players set up their nation by answering a short questionnaire about their intentions for its economy, civil rights and political freedoms,&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=97793&amp;page=1&amp;singlePage=true | title=A Web Site of Virtual Nations | publisher=ABC News | accessdate=10 April 2014 | author=Goldman, Noah}}&lt;/ref&gt;  giving it a name,&lt;ref name="Agencies 2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2006-09-12/news/27451151_1_cyber-world-private-sector-theocracy|title=Virtual nations take control over the cyber world|author=Agencies|date=12 September 2006|website=[[The Economic Times]]|publisher=[[The Times Group]]|access-date=13 January 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a flag from current countries and territories or their own, a [[national animal]], a currency, and an official motto.&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt; The player's response to the initial questionnaire defines the type of government they are running,&lt;ref name="sommerer"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christa Sommerer |author2=L. C. Jain |author3=Laurent Mignonneau |title=The Art and Science of Interface and Interaction Design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2a4CRJviwGkC&amp;pg=PA173|year=2008|publisher=Springer |isbn=354079869-2|pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it can change over time as you answer Issues.

Gameplay hinges on deciding government policies: Multiple times each day the player is presented with an automatically assigned "issue",&lt;ref name="sommerer" /&gt; such as choosing whether to allow a right-wing protest march, or dealing with food shortages in their country.&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt; The player chooses a government stance from a list of options, or may choose to dismiss the problem. Each action or inaction affects the prosperity of the player's country, and may have unforeseen effects. For instance, granting greater political freedom may lead to more civil unrest.&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt; Some issues are written by the game's developers, while others are submitted by players with in-game "populations" of 50,000,000 or greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?p=32581705#how|title=NationStates Forums {{!}} Got Issues?|last=|first=|date=|website=NationStates|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first 30 days of a nation's existence, only game-created issues can be answered, but after that period any approved issue can be answered.&lt;ref name="sommerer" /&gt; The player's responses to issues affect the nation's status in three main factors: the level of ''[[political rights|Political Freedoms]]'' and ''[[Civil Rights]]'' and the strength of the ''[[Economy]]''.&lt;ref name="sommerer" /&gt;

Based on the nation's civil, economic and political freedoms, the nation is assigned to one of 27 government types,&lt;ref name="sommerer" /&gt; from [[Anarchy]], to Inoffensive Centrist Democracy, to Psychotic Dictatorship. Although there is no way of "winning" the game, daily "World Census reports" are compiled for each region and the entire world, ranking nations on anything from economic strength to the most liberal [[public nudity]] laws.&lt;ref name="sommerer" /&gt;

As of 21 May 2018, there are now 1,000 different issues that nations can be confronted with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=news/2018/05/21/index.html |title=Issue 1K |last=Barry |first=Max |date=21 May 2018 |website=NationStates |publisher= |access-date=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Raiding/defending gameplay ===
Outside the basic technical parameters of nation play, players can also move freely between regions, and use their status to "endorse" each other, making one of them regional World Assembly Delegate, a tactic commonly referred to as raiding. This sometimes, depending on the regional settings, gives the invaders power over the region's appearance, border control, "embassies" with other regions, among other powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=faq|title=NationStates FAQ|last=Barry|first=Max|date=|website=NationStates|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain regions, such as the Black Hawks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_black_hawks|title=NationStates {{!}} The Black Hawks|last=|first=|date=|website=NationStates|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; exist to do such, leading to the rise of other, "defending" regions who seek to prevent raiders from doing so, such as The Order of the Grey Wardens.

=== Regions ===
A region is defined as a group of nations which come together in order to interact. They do this on a Regional Message Board, which functions much like a chat room, or on regional offsite forums, through groups such as [[xenForo]] and [[Discord (software)|Discord]]. Furthermore, many regions, particularly larger ones, have "regional [[government]]s", which involve themselves in the World Assembly, in inter-regional gameplay, and domestic regional affairs. Some of these regions, such as The North Pacific,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; have adopted democratic governmental models, while others, such as Lazarus, opt for anarchy or other forms of regional government.

New nations appear in one of five main game regions (known in the game as "feeders") located in the NationStates version of the [[Pacific Ocean]] (The East, West, North, South and the Pacific), but nations are able to move to other regions, or create their own. Nations that remain inactive and are resurrected are put into three "sinker" regions called [[Osiris]], [[Baldr|Balder]], and [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], all named after characters that purportedly rose from the dead. Nations ejected or banned from a region are moved to a region known as "The Rejected Realms". Players may have multiple nations (contributing to the active nation count), but only one nation may be a member of the World Assembly.

=== The World Assembly ===
The World Assembly is an international law-making body within NationStates, in which players may submit resolutions that, if they garner enough approvals from regional World Assembly Delegates, reach a vote among all members of the organization (membership is voluntary). These resolutions, some of which are drafted on the forums, have covered a range of international issues, such as [[human rights]] and [[environmental protection]], usually written in a format similar to that in a [[Model United Nations]] resolution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Involvement in the World Assembly has led to an argument among nations as to the merits of national [[Sovereignty]] as opposed to the [[World Federalist Movement]] (also called International Federalism), which has the power to make binding laws over its member nations. One example of these contentious resolutions was "Reproductive Freedoms", which requires member nations to legalize [[abortion]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Player United Massachusetts&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popularity===
The game attracted a thousand nations within two weeks, and had 20,700 by the end of the first year.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt; Barry was surprised by the popularity of the game, and saw its discussion forums developing into an arena for political debate.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt; He was impressed by some of the activity in the forums, relating how "One nation accused another of conducting secret missile tests and posted photos to prove it. That escalated into an international crisis that was only solved by sending in teams of independent weapons inspectors".&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

==United Nations incident==
In 2008, Barry received a [[cease and desist]] order from the [[United Nations]] for using the UN name and logo for the international ruling body on the website. In response, he removed the logo and changed the name to the World Assembly on 1 April,&lt;ref name="blog"&gt;[http://maxbarry.com/2008/04/02/news.html The United Nations vs Me], retrieved 17 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; which many initially took as one of Barry's annual April Fool's Day jokes.

The '''National Conference on Organized Resistance''' (NCOR) was an annual event that brought together activists from a variety of issues, struggles, ideologies and backgrounds for a weekend of learning and reflecting on the state of [[progressivism|progressive]] movements occurring locally, nationally and worldwide. Through diverse workshops, panel discussions, [[skillshare]]s, tabling, and the creation of an open and safe space, NCOR sought to promote organized action amongst participants against the injustices and inequalities that are confronted in people's daily lives and in the world. NCOR was held on the main campus of [[American University]] in northwest [[Washington, DC]], from 1998 to 2008.

While the overall political mood of the conference was that of [[anarchism]], the event drew both speakers and participants across the spectrum of the left - from the [[International Socialist Organization]] to the Catalyst Project to the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]].

NCOR was partially funded by American University's student Club Council, the rest coming from admission to the conference. This had forced NCOR (now an official "club" on campus) to adhere to official campus policies, including having to forgo catering by the local [[Food Not Bombs]] chapter, as food in AU's student union building must be professionally catered for insurance reasons.  

In October 2008, it was announced that future NCOR events were indefinitely canceled due to no current American University students volunteering to be part of the next organizing collective. &lt;ref&gt;[http://ncor.wordpress.com National Conference on Organized Resistance] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Organic Law of Village Committees of the People's Republic of China''' ({{zh |s = 中华人民共和国村民委员会组织法 |p = Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó cūnmín wěiyuánhuì zǔzhīfǎ }}) consists of 30 [[:wikt:article|article]]s about [[self-governance]], [[self-education]] and [[elections]] in [[Chinese villages]].

The [[Organic Law]] of Village Committees sets the rules and regulations under which the Chinese villagers may govern their villages as well as [[terms and conditions]] for village elections.

After a trial implementation in 1987 the Organic Law of Village Committees was fully adopted in 1998 by the [[National People’s Congress]] of China.

The ''Parliament of England'' was the [[legislature]] of the [[Kingdom of England]], existing from the early 13th century until 1707, when it became the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] after the political union of England and Scotland created the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. 

In 1066, [[William of Normandy]] introduced what, in later centuries, became referred to as a [[feudal]] system, by which he sought the advice of a council of [[Tenant-in-chief|tenants-in-chief]] (a person who held land) and [[ecclesiastic]]s before making laws. In 1215, the tenants-in-chief secured [[Magna Carta]] from [[John of England|King John]], which established that the king may not levy or collect any taxes (except the feudal taxes to which they were hitherto accustomed), save with the consent of his [[Curia regis|royal council]], which gradually developed into a parliament.

Over the centuries, the English Parliament progressively limited the power of the [[English monarchy]] which arguably culminated in the [[English Civil War]] and the trial and execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649. After the restoration of the monarchy under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], and the subsequent [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, the supremacy of Parliament was a settled principle and all future English and later British sovereigns were restricted to the role of [[constitutional monarch]]s with limited executive authority. The [[Act of Union 1707]] merged the English Parliament with the [[Parliament of Scotland]] to form the [[Parliament of Great Britain]]. When the [[Parliament of Ireland]] was abolished in 1801, its former members were merged into what was now called the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].

==History==
Under a monarchical system of government, monarchs usually must consult and seek a measure of acceptance for their policies if they are to enjoy the broad cooperation of their subjects. Early kings of England had no [[standing army]] or [[police]], and so depended on the support of powerful subjects. The monarchy had agents in every part of the country. However, under the [[feudal system]] that evolved in England following the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] of 1066, the laws of the Crown could not have been upheld without the support of the [[nobility]] and the [[clergy]]. The former had economic and military power bases of their own through major ownership of land and the feudal obligations of their tenants (some of whom held lands on condition of military service). The Church was virtually a law unto itself in this period as it had its own system of religious law courts.

In order to seek consultation and consent from the nobility and the senior clergy on major decisions, post-Norman Conquest English monarchs called [[Magnum Concilium|Great Councils]]. A typical Great Council would consist of [[archbishops]], [[bishops]], [[abbots]], [[barons]] and [[earls]], the pillars of the feudal system. When this system of consultation and consent broke down, it often became impossible for government to function effectively. The most prominent instances of this prior to the reign of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] are the disagreements between [[Thomas Becket]] and [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] and between [[King John of England|King John]] and the barons. Becket, who served as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] between 1162 and 1170, was murdered following a long running dispute with [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] over the jurisdiction of the Church. John, who was king from 1199 to 1216, aroused such hostility from many leading noblemen that they forced him to agree to [[Magna Carta]] in 1215. John's refusal to adhere to this charter led to civil war (see [[First Barons' War]]).

The Great Council evolved into the Parliament of England. The term (French ''parlement'' or Latin ''parlamentum'') came into use during the early 13th century, when it shifted from the more general meaning of "an occasion for speaking." It first appears in official documents in the 1230s. As a result of the work by historians G. O. Sayles and H. G. Richardson, it is widely believed that the early parliaments had a judicial as well as a legislative function.

During the 13th and 14th centuries, the kings began to call [[Knights of the Shire]] to meet when the monarch saw it as necessary. A notable example of this was in 1254 when [[sheriffs]] of counties were instructed to send Knights of the Shire to parliament to advise the king on [[Taxation in medieval England|finance]].&lt;ref name="parliament.uk"&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g03.pdf "A Brief Chronology of the House of Commons"], Factsheet G3, General Series, August 2010, House of Commons Information Office&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, parliaments were mostly summoned when the king needed to raise money through taxes. Following the Magna Carta this became a convention. This was due in no small part to the fact that King John died in 1216 and was succeeded by his young son Henry III. Leading [[peerage of England|peers]] and [[clergy]] governed on Henry's behalf until he came of age, giving them a taste for power that they would prove unwilling to relinquish. Among other things, they made sure that Magna Carta would be reaffirmed by the young king.

===Parliament in the reign of Henry III===
Once the reign of John ended and Henry III took full control of the government, leading peers became increasingly concerned with his style of government, specifically his unwillingness to consult them on decisions he took, and his seeming patronisation of his foreign relatives over his native subjects. Henry's support of a disastrous papal invasion of [[Sicily]] was the last straw. In 1258, seven leading barons forced Henry to swear to uphold the [[Provisions of Oxford]], superseded, the following year, by the [[Provisions of Westminster]].  This effectively abolished the absolutist Anglo-Norman monarchy, giving power to a council of fifteen barons, and providing for a thrice-yearly meeting of parliament to monitor their performance. Parliament assembled six times between June 1258 and April 1262, most notably at [[Oxford Parliament (1258)|Oxford]] in 1258.

The French-born nobleman [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], [[Earl of Leicester]], emerged as the leader of this characteristically English rebellion. In the following years, those supporting Montfort and those supporting the king grew more hostile to each other. Henry obtained a [[papal bull]] in 1263 exempting him from his oath and both sides began to raise armies. At the [[Battle of Lewes]] on 14 May 1264, Henry was defeated and taken prisoner by Montfort's army. However, many of the peers who had initially supported Montfort began to suspect that he had gone too far with his reforming zeal. His support amongst the nobility rapidly declined. So in 1264, Montfort summoned the first parliament in English history without any prior royal authorisation. The archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls and barons were summoned, as were two knights from each shire and two [[burgess (title)|burgess]]es from each borough. Knights had been summoned to previous councils, but the representation of the boroughs was unprecedented. This was purely a move to consolidate Montfort's position as the legitimate governor of the kingdom, since he had captured Henry and his son Prince Edward (later [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]) at the Battle of Lewes.

A parliament consisting of representatives of the realm was the logical way for Montfort to establish his authority. In calling this parliament, in a bid to gain popular support, he summoned knights and burgesses from the emerging [[landed gentry]] class, thus turning to his advantage the fact that most of the nobility had abandoned his movement. This parliament was summoned on 14 December 1264. It first met on 20 January 1265 in Westminster Hall&lt;ref name="parliament.uk"/&gt; and was dissolved on 15 February 1265. It is not certain who actually attended this parliament. Nonetheless, Montfort's scheme was formally adopted by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] in the so-called "[[Model Parliament]]" of 1295. The attendance at parliament of knights and burgesses historically became known as the summoning of "the Commons", a term derived from the Norman French word "commune", literally translated as the "community of the realm".

Following Edward's escape from captivity, Montfort was defeated and killed at the [[Battle of Evesham]] in 1265. Henry's authority was restored and the Provisions of Oxford were forgotten, but this was nonetheless a turning point in the history of the Parliament of England. Although he was not obliged by statute to do so, Henry summoned the Commons to parliament three times between September 1268 and April 1270. However, this was not a significant turning point in the history of parliamentary democracy. Subsequently, very little is known about how representatives were selected because, at this time, being sent to parliament was not a prestigious undertaking. But Montfort's decision to summon knights of the shires and burgesses to his parliament did mark the irreversible emergence of the landed gentry as a force in politics. From then on, monarchs could not ignore them, which explains Henry's decision to summon the Commons to several of his post-1265 parliaments.

Even though many peers who had supported the Provisions of Oxford remained active in English public life throughout Henry's reign, the conditions they had laid down for regular parliaments were largely forgotten, as if to symbolise the historical development of the English Parliament via convention rather than statutes and written constitutions.

===The emergence of parliament as an institution===
[[File:Medieval parliament edward.Jpg|thumb|A 16th-century depiction of Edward's parliament]]

During the reign of [[Edward I]], which began in 1272, the role of Parliament in the government of the English kingdom increased due to Edward's determination to unite England, Wales and Scotland under his rule by force. He was also keen to unite his subjects in order to restore his authority and not face rebellion as was his father's fate. Edward therefore encouraged all sectors of society to submit petitions to parliament detailing their grievances in order for them to be resolved. This seemingly gave all of Edward's subjects a potential role in government and this helped Edward assert his authority. Both the [[Statute of Westminster 1275]] and [[Statute of Westminster 1285]], with the assistance of [[Robert Burnell]], codified the existing law in England.

As the number of petitions being submitted to parliament increased, they came to be dealt with, and often ignored, more and more by ministers of the Crown so as not to block the passage of government business through parliament. However the emergence of petitioning is significant because it is some of the earliest evidence of parliament being used as a forum to address the general grievances of ordinary people. Submitting a petition to parliament is a tradition that continues to this day in the Parliament of the United Kingdom and in most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] realms.

These developments symbolise the fact that parliament and government were by no means the same thing by this point. If monarchs were going to impose their will on their kingdom, they would have to control parliament rather than be subservient to it.

From Edward's reign onwards, the authority of the English Parliament would depend on the strength or weakness of the incumbent monarch. When the king or queen was strong he or she would wield enough influence to pass their legislation through parliament without much trouble. Some strong monarchs even bypassed it completely, although this was not often possible in the case of financial legislation due to the post-Magna Carta convention of parliament granting taxes. When weak monarchs governed, parliament often became the centre of opposition against them. Subsequently, the composition of parliaments in this period varied depending on the decisions that needed to be taken in them. The nobility and senior clergy were always summoned. From 1265 onwards, when the monarch needed to raise money through taxes, it was usual for knights and burgesses to be summoned too. However, when the king was merely seeking advice, he often only summoned the nobility and the clergy, sometimes with and sometimes without the knights of the shires. On some occasions the Commons were summoned and sent home again once the monarch was finished with them, allowing parliament to continue without them. It was not until the mid-14th century that summoning representatives of the shires and the boroughs became the norm for all parliaments.

One of the moments that marked the emergence of parliament as a true institution in England was the deposition of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]. Even though it is debatable whether Edward II was deposed ''in'' parliament or ''by'' parliament, this remarkable sequence of events consolidated the importance of parliament in the English unwritten constitution. [[Parliament of 1327|Parliament]] was also crucial in establishing the legitimacy of the king who replaced Edward II: his son [[Edward III of England|Edward III]].

In 1341 the Commons met separately from the nobility and clergy for the first time, creating what was effectively an Upper Chamber and a Lower Chamber, with the knights and burgesses sitting in the latter. This Upper Chamber became known as the [[House of Lords]] from 1544 onward, and the Lower Chamber became known as the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], collectively known as the [[Houses of Parliament]].

The authority of parliament grew under Edward III; it was established that no law could be made, nor any tax levied, without the consent of both Houses and the Sovereign. This development occurred during the reign of Edward III because he was involved in the [[Hundred Years' War]] and needed finances. During his conduct of the war, Edward tried to circumvent parliament as much as possible, which caused this edict to be passed.

The Commons came to act with increasing boldness during this period. During the Good Parliament (1376), the Presiding Officer of the lower chamber, [[Peter de la Mare|Sir Peter de la Mare]], complained of heavy taxes, demanded an accounting of the royal expenditures, and criticised the king's management of the military. The Commons even proceeded to [[impeach]] some of the king's ministers. The bold Speaker was imprisoned, but was soon released after the death of Edward III. During the reign of the next monarch, [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], the Commons once again began to impeach errant ministers of the Crown. They insisted that they could not only control taxation, but also public expenditure. Despite such gains in authority, however, the Commons still remained much less powerful than the House of Lords and the Crown.

This period also saw the introduction of a [[suffrage|franchise]] which limited the number of people who could vote in elections for the House of Commons. From 1430 onwards, the franchise was limited to [[Forty Shilling Freeholders]], that is men who owned freehold property worth forty shillings or more. The Parliament of England legislated the new uniform county franchise, in the statute 8 Hen. 6, c. 7. The ''Chronological Table of the Statutes'' does not mention such a 1430 law, as it was included in the Consolidated Statutes as a recital in the Electors of Knights of the Shire Act 1432 (10 Hen. 6, c. 2), which amended and re-enacted the 1430 law to make clear that the resident of a county had to have a forty shilling freehold in that county to be a voter there.

===King, Lords and Commons===
During the reign of the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor monarchs]] the modern structure of the English Parliament began to be created. The Tudor monarchy was powerful, and there were often periods of several years when parliament did not sit at all. However the Tudor monarchs were astute enough to realise that they needed parliament to legitimise many of their decisions, mostly out of a need to raise money through taxation legitimately without causing discontent. Thus they consolidated the state of affairs whereby monarchs would call and close parliament as and when they needed it.

By the time Henry Tudor ([[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]) came to the throne in 1485 the monarch was not a member of either the Upper Chamber or the Lower Chamber. Consequently, the monarch would have to make his or her feelings known to Parliament through his or her supporters in both houses. Proceedings were regulated by the presiding officer in either chamber. From the 1540s the presiding officer in the House of Commons became formally known as the "[[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker]]", having previously been referred to as the "prolocutor" or "parlour" (a semi-official position, often nominated by the monarch, that had existed ever since [[Peter de Montfort]] had acted as the presiding officer of the Oxford Parliament of 1258). This was not an enviable job. When the House of Commons was unhappy it was the Speaker who had to deliver this news to the monarch. This began the tradition whereby the Speaker of the House of Commons is dragged to the Speaker's Chair by other members once elected.

A member of either chamber could present a "bill" to parliament. Bills supported by the monarch were often proposed by members of the [[Privy Council]] who sat in parliament. In order for a bill to become law it would have to be approved by a majority of both Houses of Parliament before it passed to the monarch for [[royal assent]] or [[veto]]. The royal veto was applied several times during the 16th and 17th centuries and it is still the right of the monarch of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth realms to veto legislation today, although it has not been exercised since 1707 (today such exercise would presumably precipitate a [[constitutional crisis]]).

When a bill was enacted into law, this process gave it the approval of each estate of the realm: the King, Lords, and Commons. In reality, this was not a democratic process. The Parliament of England was far from being a democratically representative institution in this period. It was possible to assemble the entire peerage and senior clergy of the realm in one place to form the estate of the Upper Chamber. However, the voting franchise for the House of Commons was small; some historians estimate that it was as little as three per cent of the adult male population; and there was no secret ballot. This meant that elections could be controlled by local grandees, because in many boroughs a majority of voters were in some way dependent on a powerful individual, or else could be bought by money or concessions. If these grandees were supporters of the incumbent monarch, this gave the Crown and its ministers considerable influence over the business of parliament. Many of the men elected to parliament did not relish the prospect of having to act in the interests of others. So a law was enacted, still on the statute book today, whereby it became unlawful for members of the House of Commons to resign their seat unless they were granted a position directly within the patronage of the monarchy (today this latter restriction leads to a [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|legal fiction]] allowing ''de facto'' resignation despite the prohibition, but nevertheless it is a resignation which needs the permission of the Crown). However, it must be emphasised that while several elections to parliament in this period were in some way corrupt by modern standards, many elections involved genuine contests between rival candidates, even though the ballot was not secret.

It was in this period that the [[Palace of Westminster]] was established as the seat of the English Parliament. In 1548, the House of Commons was granted a regular meeting place by the Crown, [[St Stephen's Chapel]]. This had been a royal chapel. It was made into a debating chamber after [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] became the last monarch to use the Palace of Westminster as a place of residence and following the suppression of the college there. This room became the home of the House of Commons until it was destroyed by fire in 1834, although the interior was altered several times up until then. The structure of this room was pivotal in the development of the Parliament of England. While most modern legislatures sit in a circular chamber, the benches of the British Houses of Parliament are laid out in the form of choir stalls in a chapel, simply because this is the part of the original room that the members of the House of Commons used when they were granted use of St Stephen's Chapel. This structure took on a new significance with the emergence of political parties in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, as the tradition began whereby the members of the governing party would sit on the benches to the right of the Speaker and the opposition members on the benches to the left. It is said that the Speaker's chair was placed in front of the chapel's altar. As Members came and went they observed the custom of bowing to the altar and continued to do so, even when it had been taken away, thus then bowing to the Chair, as is still the custom today.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The numbers of the [[Lords Spiritual]] diminished under Henry VIII, who commanded the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], thereby depriving the abbots and priors of their seats in the Upper House. For the first time, the [[Lords Temporal]] were more numerous than the Lords Spiritual. Currently, the Lords Spiritual consist of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Bishops of London, Durham and Winchester, and twenty-one other English diocesan bishops in seniority of appointment to a diocese.

The [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542|Laws in Wales Acts]] of 1535–42 annexed [[Wales]] as part of England and this brought Welsh representatives into the Parliament of England, first elected in 1542.

===Rebellion and revolution===
{{Parliaments of England 1601}}
Parliament had not always submitted to the wishes of the Tudor monarchs. But parliamentary criticism of the monarchy reached new levels in the 17th century. When the last Tudor monarch, Elizabeth I, died in 1603, King James VI of Scotland came to power as King James I, founding the Stuart monarchy.

In 1628, alarmed by the arbitrary exercise of royal power, the House of Commons submitted to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] the [[Petition of Right]], demanding the restoration of their liberties. Though he accepted the petition, Charles later dissolved parliament and ruled without them for eleven years. It was only after the financial disaster of the Scottish [[Bishops' Wars]] (1639&amp;ndash;1640) that he was forced to recall Parliament so that they could authorise new taxes. This resulted in the calling of the assemblies known historically as the [[Short Parliament]] of 1640 and the [[Long Parliament]], which sat with several breaks and in various forms between 1640 and 1660.

The Long Parliament was characterised by the growing number of critics of the king who sat in it. The most prominent of these critics in the House of Commons was [[John Pym]]. Tensions between the king and his parliament reached boiling point in January 1642 when Charles entered the House of Commons and tried, unsuccessfully, to arrest Pym and four other members for their alleged treason. The [[five members]] had been tipped off about this, and by the time Charles came into the chamber with a group of soldiers they had disappeared. Charles was further humiliated when he asked the Speaker, [[William Lenthall]], to give their whereabouts, which Lenthall famously refused to do.

From then on relations between the king and his parliament deteriorated further. When trouble started to brew in Ireland, both Charles and his parliament raised armies to quell the uprisings by native Catholics there. It was not long before it was clear that these forces would end up fighting each other, leading to the [[English Civil War]] which began with the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642: those supporting the cause of parliament were called Parliamentarians (or [[Roundhead]]s).

Battles between Crown and Parliament would continue throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, but parliament was no longer subservient to the English monarchy. This change was symbolised in the execution of Charles I in January 1649. It is somewhat ironic that this event was not instigated by the elected representatives of the realm. In [[Pride's Purge]] of December 1648, the [[New Model Army]] (which by then had emerged as the leading force in the parliamentary alliance) purged Parliament of members that did not support them. The remaining "[[Rump Parliament]]", as it was later referred to by critics, enacted legislation to put the king on trial for treason. This trial, the outcome of which was a foregone conclusion, led to the execution of the king and the start of an 11-year republic. The House of Lords was abolished and the purged House of Commons governed England until April 1653, when army chief [[Oliver Cromwell]] dissolved it following disagreements over religious policy and how to carry out elections to parliament. Cromwell later convened a parliament of religious radicals in 1653, commonly known as [[Barebone's Parliament]], followed by the unicameral [[First Protectorate Parliament]] that sat from September 1654 to January 1655 and the [[Second Protectorate Parliament]] that sat in two sessions between 1656 and 1658, the first session was unicameral and the second session was bicameral.

Although it is easy to dismiss the English Republic of 1649-60 as nothing more than a Cromwellian military dictatorship, the events that took place in this decade were hugely important in determining the future of parliament. First, it was during the sitting of the first Rump Parliament that members of the House of Commons became known as "MPs" (Members of Parliament). Second, Cromwell gave a huge degree of freedom to his parliaments, although royalists were barred from sitting in all but a handful of cases. His vision of parliament appears to have been largely based on the example of the Elizabethan parliaments. However, he underestimated the extent to which Elizabeth I and her ministers had directly and indirectly influenced the decision-making process of her parliaments. He was thus always surprised when they became troublesome. He ended up dissolving each parliament that he convened. Yet it is worth noting that the structure of the second session of the Second Protectorate Parliament of 1658 was almost identical to the parliamentary structure consolidated in the [[Glorious Revolution]] Settlement of 1689.

In 1653 Cromwell had been made head of state with the title Lord Protector of the Realm. The Second Protectorate Parliament offered him the crown. Cromwell rejected this offer, but the governmental structure embodied in the final version of the [[Humble Petition and Advice]] was a basis for all future parliaments. It proposed an elected House of Commons as the Lower Chamber, a House of Lords containing peers of the realm as the Upper Chamber, and a constitutional monarchy, subservient to parliament and the laws of the nation, as the executive arm of the state at the top of the tree, assisted in carrying out their duties by a Privy Council. Oliver Cromwell had thus inadvertently presided over the creation of a basis for the future parliamentary government of England. In 1657 he had the [[Parliament of Scotland]] unified with the English Parliament.

In terms of the evolution of parliament as an institution, by far the most important development during the republic was the sitting of the Rump Parliament between 1649 and 1653. This proved that parliament could survive without a monarchy and a House of Lords if it wanted to. Future English monarchs would never forget this. Charles I was the last English monarch ever to enter the House of Commons. Even to this day, a Member of the Parliament of the United Kingdom is sent to [[Buckingham Palace]] as a ceremonial hostage during the [[State Opening of Parliament]], in order to ensure the safe return of the sovereign from a potentially hostile parliament. During the ceremony the monarch sits on the throne in the House of Lords and signals for the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]] to summon the House of Commons to the Lords Chamber. The Lord Great Chamberlain then raises his wand of office to signal to the [[Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod]], who has been waiting in the central lobby. Black Rod turns and, escorted by the [[Doorkeeper (Houses of Parliament)|doorkeeper]] of the House of Lords and an inspector of police, approaches the doors to the chamber of the Commons. The doors are slammed in his face – symbolising the right of the Commons to debate without the presence of the Queen's representative. He then strikes three times with his staff (the Black Rod), and he is admitted.

===Parliament from the Restoration to the Act of Settlement===
The revolutionary events that occurred between 1620 and 1689 all took place in the name of parliament. The new status of parliament as the central governmental organ of the English state was consolidated during the events surrounding the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of the monarchy in 1660. Following the death of Oliver Cromwell in September 1658, his son [[Richard Cromwell]] succeeded him as Lord Protector, summoning the [[Third Protectorate Parliament]] in the process. When this parliament was dissolved following pressure from the army in April 1659, the Rump Parliament was recalled at the insistence of the surviving army [[Grandee (New Model Army)|grandee]]s. This in turn was dissolved in a coup led by army general [[John Lambert (general)|John Lambert]], leading to the formation of the [[English Committee of Safety#1659|Committee of Safety]], dominated by Lambert and his supporters. When the breakaway forces of [[George Monck]] invaded England from Scotland where they had been stationed—without Lambert's supporters putting up a fight—Monck temporarily recalled the Rump Parliament and reversed [[Pride's Purge]] by recalling the entirety of the Long Parliament. They then voted to dissolve themselves and call new elections, which were arguably the most democratic for 20 years although the franchise was still very small. This led to the calling of the [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]] which was dominated by royalists. This parliament voted to reinstate the monarchy and the House of Lords. [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] returned to England as king in May 1660. The Anglo-Scottish parliamentary union that Cromwell had established was dissolved in 1661 when the Scottish Parliament resumed its separate meeting place in Edinburgh.

The Restoration began the tradition whereby all governments looked to parliament for legitimacy. In 1681 Charles II dissolved parliament and ruled without them for the last four years of his reign. This followed bitter disagreements between the king and parliament that had occurred between 1679 and 1681. Charles took a big gamble by doing this. He risked the possibility of a military showdown akin to that of 1642. However he rightly predicted that the nation did not want another civil war. Parliament disbanded without a fight. Events that followed ensured that this would be nothing but a temporary blip.

Charles II died in 1685 and he was succeeded by his brother [[James II of England|James II]]. During his lifetime Charles had always pledged loyalty to the Protestant Church of England, despite his private Catholic sympathies. James was openly Catholic. He attempted to lift restrictions on Catholics taking up public offices. This was bitterly opposed by Protestants in his kingdom. They invited [[William III of England|William of Orange]],&lt;ref&gt;Wouter Troost, ''William III the Stadholder-King: A Political Biography'' (2004) {{ISBN|0-7546-5071-5}} p 191&lt;/ref&gt; a Protestant who had married Mary, daughter of James II and [[Anne Hyde]] to invade England and claim the throne. William assembled an army estimated at 15,000 soldiers (11,000 foot and 4000 horse)&lt;ref&gt;Troost, pp 204–205&lt;/ref&gt; and landed at [[Brixham]] in southwest England in November, 1688. When many Protestant officers, including James's close adviser, [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]], defected from the English army to William's invasion force, James fled the country. Parliament then offered the Crown to his Protestant daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary]], instead of his son ([[James Francis Edward Stuart]]). Mary refused the offer, and instead William and Mary ruled jointly, with both having the right to rule alone on the other's death. As part of the compromise in allowing William to be King—called the [[Glorious Revolution]]—Parliament was able to have the 1689 [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] enacted. Later the 1701 [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]] was approved. These were statutes that lawfully upheld the prominence of parliament for the first time in English history. These events marked the beginning of the English constitutional monarchy and its role as one of the three elements of parliament.

===Union: the Parliament of Great Britain===
{{Main|Parliament of Great Britain}}

Following the [[Treaty of Union 1707|Treaty of Union]] in 1707, Acts of Parliament passed in the Parliament of England and the [[Parliament of Scotland]] created a new [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and dissolved both parliaments, replacing them with a new [[Parliament of Great Britain]] based in the former home of the English parliament. The Parliament of Great Britain later became the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] in 1801 when the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] was formed through the [[Act of Union 1800]].

Even if the aim of peripheral nationalists is emancipation, their solution may not be the creation of a nation-state for themselves, in which case a federal solution is preferred, according with the concept of "regional pluralism" in opposition to [[monism]] or imperialism.&lt;ref name=seiler/&gt; Peripheral nationalisms may demand a recognition of the national identity of their own regions (i.e. their own existence as a "nation"). The existence of such nations may coexist within the State they belong to (e.g. by proposing the concept of a "nation composed of several nations" or a "[[plurinationalism|nation of nations]]"), or they may defend their right to self-determination, secession, and the ability to create their own independent State.

The [[Red Spear Society]] staged a '''major uprising in 1928/29''' against the rule of [[Liu Zhennian]], the [[Nationalist government]]-aligned [[warlord]] ruler of eastern [[Shandong]] province in [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republican China]]. Motivated by their resistance against [[Tax resistance|high taxes]], rampant [[banditry]] and the brutality of Liu's [[private army]], the Red Spear peasant insurgents captured large areas on the [[Shandong Peninsula]] and were able to set up a [[proto-state]] in [[Penglai, Shandong|Dengzhou]] county. Despite this, the whole insurgency was eventually crushed by Liu in late 1929.

== Background ==
[[File:Chinese pirate spear hmsL4.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Red Spear Society]] was named for the weapon most commonly used by its members: A simple [[spear]] with a red tassel, similar to the one seen here.{{sfnp|Perry|1980|p=153}} ]]

The Red Spear Society was a movement and network of peasant [[self-defense]] and [[vigilante]] militias that sprung up throughout China in response to the chaos of the [[Warlord Era]] in the 1910s and 1920s. As the influence of the Red Spears grew, branches of the movement were set up in several Chinese provinces, such as [[Shandong]]. The largest area of Red Spears activity in Shandong was its western counties, while the [[Shandong Peninsula]] in the east remained relatively calm until the late 1920s. The only eastern area with a large Red Spears presence was [[Laiyang]] county.{{sfnp|Bianco|2015|pp=4–6}}{{sfnp|Perry|1980|pp=152–154}}

This changed in fall of 1928, as [[banditry]] on the peninsula rapidly increased, leading to additional villages joining the Red Spear Society to defend themselves. The Red Spears' power and influence consequently grew greatly.{{sfnp|Bianco|2015|pp=5, 6}} Meanwhile, the situation for the civilian population in eastern Shandong worsened due to the ascension of [[Liu Zhennian]]. Liu, a former subordinate of [[Fengtian clique|Fengtian warlord]] [[Zhang Zongchang]], defected to the Nationalists during the [[Northern Expedition]] in 1928. In return, the new [[Nationalist government]] in [[Nanjing]] allowed him to keep the Shandong Peninsula as his personal fiefdom.{{sfnp|Jowett|2017|pp=45, 196, 197}}{{sfnp|Bianco|2015|pp=5, 6}} Liu's rule was marked by the brutality of his [[private army]],{{sfnp|Bianco|2015|pp=5, 6}} and high taxes{{sfnp|Bianco|2015|pp=5, 6}} (though these taxes were still lower than those under the previous regime of Zhang Zongchang).{{sfnp|Department of State|1943|p=141}} Furthermore, Liu did nothing to curb the widespread and escalating banditry. All this motivated additional peasants to join the Red Spears and the peasant movement to take a more aggressive stance against the perceived oppression by the government.{{sfnp|Bianco|2015|pp=5, 6}}

== Uprising ==
{{further|Warlord Rebellion in northeastern Shandong}}

The situation began to escalate in late 1928, as the Red Spears organized a militant [[tax resistance]], so that officials no longer dared to venture into areas held by the peasant movement such as Laiyang and [[Zhaoyuan, Shandong|Zhaoyuan]].{{sfnp|Bianco|2015|pp=5, 6}} The escalating Red Spears' revolt was helped by the deteriorating security in Shandong, as elements of Liu's army mutinied at [[Longkou|Longkou and Huangxian]] in January 1929 and then fled into areas controlled by the Red Spears.{{sfnp|Department of State|1943|pp=140, 141}} This mutiny was followed by a [[Warlord Rebellion in northeastern Shandong|full-blown rebellion]] of demobilized ex-warlord troops led by Zhang Zongchang who wanted to regain control of Shandong. This insurgency devastated the northern Shandong Peninsula, as over 50 villages and six towns were destroyed by rebel troops. Both Zhang's followers as well as Liu's soldiers plundered, murdered and raped civilians, while captured women and girls were sold as slaves on Huangxian's market for 10–20 [[Mexican peso#Use outside Mexico|Mexican dollars]]{{sfnp|Jowett|2017|p=197}}{{sfnp|Bianco|2015|p=6}}{{sfnp|Department of State|1943|pp=142, 143}} (the Mexican silver dollar was the main currency used in China at the time).{{sfnp|Bonavia|1995|p=76}} This chaos allowed the Red Spears to further increase their power, as the desperate rural population flocked en masse to their cause in order to receive at least some protection from the rampaging soldiers and bandits.{{sfnp|Bianco|2015|p=6}}

[[File:ChinaYantaiPenglai.png|thumb|right|By summer 1929, the [[Red Spear Society]] largely controlled [[Penglai, Shandong|Dengzhou]] county (red) and had a presence in several other counties on the [[Shandong Peninsula]]. ]]

By the time Liu Zhennian managed to crush the warlord rebellion in summer 1929, the Red Spear Society had grown so powerful that it had set up a [[proto-state]] in [[Penglai, Shandong|Dengzhou]] county. There, it had established a headquarters, named a magistrate, taken over the local administration and introduced land as well as head taxes in order to fund itself.{{sfnp|Bianco|2015|p=6}} In several other counties the peasant rebels at least prevented tax collection by government officials. The Red Spears also introduced compulsory membership to a certain degree, so that at least one member of every family in those villages the insurgents controlled had to be a Red Spear. Those among the rural population who worked at [[Yantai|Zhifu]] were also forced to pay a special tax which was used by the Red Spears to buy weapons and ammunition.{{sfnp|Bianco|2015|p=6}} Access to the insurgent areas was tightly controlled, and anyone wearing a government or military uniform was shot on sight. At this point, even those who  did not speak the local dialect and therefore appeared to be outsiders, no longer dared to venture into the Red Spears' territory.{{sfnp|Bianco|2015|p=6}} The peasant insurgents even came to behave like a [[mafia]], looting, raping, robbing and kidnapping for ransom.{{sfnp|Bianco|2015|p=9}} The victims of these activities mostly belonged to the wealthier upper class or were [[Christianity in China|Christians]], who consequently fled into the city of Dengzhou. As historian Lucien Bianco noted, secret societies in rural China had the "chronic tendency to degenerate into gangs", though at least some of the peasant rebels' criminal activities may have stemmed from military necessity.{{sfnp|Bianco|2015|p=9}}

The number of Red Spears on the Shandong Peninsula had grown to about 50,000–60,000 in August 1929, and the peasant movement had thus become so strong that Liu Zhennian could no longer ignore them as he had done before. On 23 September, he launched an encirclement campaign between Dengzhou and Huangxian, pursuing a [[scorched earth]] policy to force the rebels into submission. His soldiers completely destroyed 18 villages and largely burned more than sixty others, killing all inhabitants they encountered, including women and children. By November, the Red Spears had ceased to exist in the area.{{sfnp|Bianco|2015|pp=6, 7}}

== Aftermath ==
Overall, once Liu had decided to finally take action, he had been able to crush the uprising relatively quickly and easily. According to Bianco, this was typical of rural rebellions at the time, which had only a chance to succeed as long as no concentrated action was undertaken against them by government representatives.{{sfnp|Bianco|2015|pp=7, 8}} Despite continued challenges to his rule, Liu himself remained in power until he was [[Han–Liu War|defeated in a war]] with the ruler of western Shandong, [[Han Fuju]], in 1932. Han was a relatively capable and popular civilian administrator, and his reign restored order and stability on the Shandong Peninsula.{{sfnp|Jowett|2017|pp=206–208}}

On the other side, many of those peasant rebels who had escaped or simply survived Liu's ruthless campaign found themselves with the official magistrate of Zhaoyuan. He gave the remaining Red Spears leaders jobs and enlisted the common fighters among the ex-insurgents into a local militia. This was an attempt to win them over, so that they would not resume their struggle against the authorities.{{sfnp|Bianco|2015|p=7}}

==Background==
During the last decade of the 20th century and at the beginning of the 21st century, a number of outposts as well as neighborhoods in established settlements, were built in areas that are listed in the Judea and Samaria [[land registration]] as lands privately owned by Palestinians. At the beginning of the 21st century, several of these Palestinian owners petitioned the [[Supreme Court of Israel]], claiming those residencies were built on their own private land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://versa.cardozo.yu.edu/viewpoints/israeli-supreme-court-military-demolition-palestinian-homes|title=The Israeli Supreme Court on Military Demolition of Palestinian Homes|newspaper=VERSA: Opinions of the Supreme Court of Israel|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some of these instances, the Court acknowledged their property rights and directed to demolish houses, such as: at a neighborhood in [[Beit El]], at the [[Amona, Mateh Binyamin|Amona]] outpost, nine houses in [[Ofra]], and more. Great efforts by the [[Government of Israel|government]] to prevent these demolitions resulted in some of the proceeding extending over the course of years, but did not end up halting the demolitions. To prevent this from reoccurring, MPs of parties from the right drafted legislation that would prevent such judicial rulings of demolition of houses in the settlements of Judea and Samaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Israeli-lawmakers-both-praise-and-slam-Settlement-law-480770|title=Israeli Law Makers Both Praise and Slam New Law|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme Court challenge==
On February 8, 2017 the law was brought before the Supreme Court of Israel by 17 Palestinian local governments and three human rights organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2017/feb/08/israel-supreme-court-petitioned-to-strike-down-settler-law-1568453.html|title=Israel Supreme Court petitioned to strike down settler law|newspaper=The New Indian Express|access-date=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Attorney General of Israel]] [[Avichai Mandelblit]] has announced that he will not be defending the law on behalf of the government at the Supreme Court because he deems it [[Basic Laws of Israel|unconstitutional]], and that it may lead to a suit against [[Israel]] at the [[International Criminal Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4914676,00.html|title=Attorney General to Netanyahu: I will not Defend the Regulation Law before the Supreme Court (Hebrew)|newspaper=Ynet|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ministry of Justice (Israel)|Israeli Justice Minister]] [[Ayelet Shaked]], whose party [[The Jewish Home]] was behind the legislation, responded by saying that the State plans to hire a private lawyer to represent it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/feb/08/israeli-groups-sue-to-stop-settlement-legalization|title=Israeli groups sue to stop settlement legalization law|newspaper=Spokesman|access-date=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all of the presidents can be characterized as [[Christian]], at least by upbringing, though some were unaffiliated with any specific religious body. [[Protestants]] predominate, with [[Episcopal Church (USA)|Episcopalians]] and [[Presbyterians]] being the most prevalent. There have been four [[Nontrinitarian]] presidents, and a single [[Roman Catholic]] president ([[John F. Kennedy]]). No president thus far has been openly an atheist.&lt;ref name="nationalpublicradio2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/06/12/413654984/americas-religious-nones-are-growing-quickly-should-republicans-worry |last1=Kurtzleben |first1=Danielle |publisher=National Public Radio |title='Religious Nones' Are Growing Quickly. Should Republicans Worry? |accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it has been acknowledged that two US Presidents&amp;mdash;[[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Andrew Johnson]]&amp;mdash;had no religious affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewforum.org/2009/01/15/the-religious-affiliations-of-us-presidents/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal affiliation==
Most presidents have been formal members of a particular church or religious body, and a specific affiliation can be assigned to every president from [[James A. Garfield]] on. For many earlier presidents, however, formal church membership was forestalled until they left office; and in several cases a president never joined any church. Conversely, though every president from [[George Washington]] to [[John Quincy Adams]] can be definitely assigned membership in an [[Anglican]] or [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] body, the significance of these affiliations is often downplayed as unrepresentative of their true beliefs.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The pattern of religious adherence has changed dramatically over the course of United States history, so that the pattern of presidential affiliations is quite unrepresentative of modern membership numbers. For example, [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] are extraordinarily well represented among the presidents compared to a current membership of about 2% of the population; this is partly because the [[Church of England]], from which the Episcopal Church is derived, was the [[state religion|established church]] in some of the British Colonies (such as New York and Virginia) before the [[American Revolution]]. The Episcopal Church has been much larger previously, with its decline in membership occurring only in more recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.org/Almanack/life/religion/religionhdr.cfm Colonial Williamsburg website] has four articles on religion in colonial Virginia&lt;/ref&gt; The first seven presidents listed as Episcopalians were all from Virginia. Unitarians are also overrepresented, reflecting the importance of those colonial churches. Conversely, [[Baptists]] are underrepresented, a reflection of their quite recent expansion in numbers; there has been only one [[Catholic]] president, although they are currently the largest single denomination, and there have been no [[Adventism|Adventist]], [[Anabaptist]], [[Lutheran]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], [[Pentecostal]], or [[Latter Day Saint]] presidents.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

While many presidents did not formally join a church until quite late in life, there is a genre of tales of deathbed conversions. Biographers usually doubt these, though the baptism of [[James K. Polk]] is well documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8ufqRJuwy8C&amp;lpg=PA181&amp;ots=wIIw_2bBEc&amp;dq=deathbed%20conversion%20james%20k%20polk&amp;pg=PA183#v=onepage&amp;q=baptism&amp;f=false|title=James K. Polk: A Biographical Companion|last=Byrnes|first=Mark Eaton|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2001|isbn=9781576070567|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|pages=52|quote="On his deathbed Polk was baptized into the Methodist church."|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal beliefs==
The inner beliefs of the presidents are much more difficult to establish than church membership. While some presidents have been relatively voluble about religion, many have been reticent to the point of complete obscurity. Researchers have tried to draw conclusions from patterns of churchgoing or religious references in political speeches. When explicit statements are absent, it is difficult to assess whether the presidents in question were irreligious, were unorthodox in their beliefs, or simply believed that religion was not a matter for public revelation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

On the other hand, there are several presidents who considered themselves aligned with a particular church, but who withheld from formal affiliation for a time. [[James Buchanan]], for instance, held himself allied with the Presbyterian church, but refrained from joining it until he left office.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Some presidents changed their beliefs and affiliation at some point in their lives; synthesis of statements and membership from different periods can be misleading.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Deism and the Founding Fathers===
[[Deism]] was a religious philosophy in common currency in colonial times, and some Founding Fathers (most notably [[Thomas Paine]], who was an explicit proponent of it, and [[Benjamin Franklin]], who spoke of it in his Autobiography) are identified more or less with this system. [[Thomas Jefferson]] became a deist in later life, and Washington, [[James Madison]], [[James Monroe]], and [[John Tyler]] are often identified as having some degree of deistic beliefs.&lt;ref name="adherents"/&gt;

===Unitarianism and Nontrinitarianism===
Four presidents are affiliated with Unitarian churches, and a fifth (Jefferson) was an exponent of ideas now commonly associated with Unitarianism. Unitarians fall outside of [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] Christianity, and the question arises as to the degree to which the presidents themselves held Christian precepts. The information is generally available in the statements of the presidents themselves; for example, John Quincy Adams left detailed statements of his beliefs. William Howard Taft, a Unitarian, is noted to have said in a letter to a friend, "I am interested in the spread of [[Christian civilization]], but to go into a dogmatic discussion of creed I will not do whether I am defeated or not. . . . If the American electorate is so narrow as not to elect a Unitarian, well and good. I can stand it."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher = [[National Public Radio]]|title = Weekly Standard: Bigoted Against Brigham's Faith?|first = Philip|last = Terzian|authorlink = Philip Terzian|date = November 4, 2011|url = https://www.npr.org/2011/11/04/142014074/weekly-standard-no-bigotry-for-brigham-followers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two presidents were [[Quakers]] ([[Herbert Hoover]] and [[Richard Nixon]]) and information about their religion is harder to come by. Quakerism is, by its nature, not circumscribed by doctrines, but even so it is hard to determine whether either Hoover or Nixon had much adherence even to Quaker practice. For instance, it is common among Quakers to refuse to swear oaths; however, recordings show that Nixon did swear the oath of office in the conventional manner in all cases, and while the matter is clouded for Hoover, there is newspaper and circumstantial evidence that he did likewise.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} While Abraham Lincoln never officially joined a church, there has been some research indicating that he may have had Quaker leanings. During his time in office, he had numerous meetings with Quakers and had investigated a supposed Quaker ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Bassuk, Daniel. (1987). "Abraham Lincoln and the Quakers". Pendle Hill Quaker Center for Study and Contemplation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only other president with any association with a definitely non-Trinitarian body is [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], whose parents moved from the [[River Brethren]] to the antecedents of the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. Eisenhower himself was baptized in the Presbyterian church shortly after assuming the presidency, the only president thus far to undergo such a rite while in office; and his attendance at [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] was in sharp opposition to the tenets of the groups to which his parents belonged.&lt;ref name="DDE library"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Worship the Only True God'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 2002, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonreligious Presidents===

There are some presidents for whom there is little evidence as to the importance of religion in their lives. For example, almost no evidence exists for [[James Monroe|Monroe's]] personal religious beliefs, though this may be the result of the destruction of most of his personal correspondence, in which religious sentiments may have been recorded. As with claims of [[deism]], these identifications are not without controversy. No president has declared himself to be [[Atheism|atheist]].&lt;ref name="nationalpublicradio2" /&gt;

==Civic religion==
[[St. John's Episcopal Church, Washington, D.C.|St. John's Episcopal Church]] (built 1815-1816) just across [[Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.|Lafayette Square]] and north of the White House, is the church nearest to the [[White House]], and its services have been attended at least once by nearly every President since [[James Madison]] (1809–1817).&lt;ref&gt;https://stjohns-dc.org/welcome-to-saint-johns-church/history/&lt;/ref&gt; Another Episcopal church, [[Washington National Cathedral]], chartered by Congress in 1893, has been the scene of many funeral and memorial services of Presidents and other dignitaries, as well as the site of interfaith presidential prayer services after their inaugurations, and the burial place of [[Woodrow Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;https://cathedral.org/history/timeline/&lt;/ref&gt;

Presidential proclamations, from the earliest days, have often been laden with religious if not explicitly Christian language. In at least two cases, Presidents saw fit to issue denials that they were atheists. At the same time, this was tempered, especially in early years, by a strong commitment to [[disestablishment]]. Several Presidents especially stand out as exponents of this. Consideration of this has become increasingly contentious as topics such as [[civil rights]] and [[human sexuality]] have increasingly put churches at odds with each other and with the government.

==Studies of presidential religion==
Presidential biographers have often been brought to consider the issue of presidential religion. In the case of certain key figures (particularly Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln), they have devoted considerable attention to the subject.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Some researchers have produced general surveys of presidential religion. A recent example is ''The Faiths of the Founding Fathers'' by David L. Holmes (New York, Oxford University Press USA, 2006), which examines the views of some early presidents as well as other political figures of the period. The [[Adherents.com]] website maintains a list of presidential affiliations, with subpages for each president.&lt;ref name="adherents"&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious Affiliation of U.S. Presidents |url=http://adherents.com/adh_presidents.html|publisher=adherents.com|accessdate=2007-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these subpages refer to a site by one Peter Roberts, which has links and some more detailed information on the religion of the presidents, vice presidents, and founding fathers.&lt;ref name="peter.roberts"&gt;see {{cite web

#:&lt;blockquote&gt;Like many others of his time (he died just one year after the founding of institutional Unitarianism in America), Jefferson was a Unitarian in theology, though not in church membership. He never joined a Unitarian congregation: there were none near his home in Virginia during his lifetime. He regularly attended [[Joseph Priestley]]'s Pennsylvania church when he was nearby, and said that Priestley's theology was his own, and there is no doubt Priestley should be identified as Unitarian. Jefferson remained a member of the Episcopal congregation near his home, but removed himself from those available to become godparents, because he was not sufficiently in agreement with the [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] theology. His work, the [[Jefferson Bible]], was Unitarian in theology...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
#* In a letter to [[Benjamin Rush]] prefacing his "Syllabus of an Estimate of the Merit of the Doctrines of Jesus", Jefferson wrote:
#:&lt;blockquote&gt;In some of the delightful conversations with you, in the evenings of 1798–99, and which served as an anodyne to the afflictions of the crisis through which our country was then laboring, the Christian religion was sometimes our topic; and I then promised you, that one day or other, I would give you my views of it. They are the result of a life of inquiry &amp; reflection, and very different from that anti-Christian system imputed to me by those who know nothing of my opinions. To the corruptions of Christianity I am indeed opposed; but not to the genuine precepts of Jesus himself. I am a Christian, in the only sense he wished any one to be; sincerely attached to his doctrines, in preference to all others; ascribing to himself every human excellence; &amp; believing he never claimed any other.&lt;ref&gt;transcript from {{cite web|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/resourcelib/docs/133/Letter_from_Thomas_Jefferson_to_Benjamin_Rush_1.html|title=Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Benjamin Rush|publisher=beliefnet|accessdate=2008-12-30}} The original letter may be viewed on the [[Library of Congress]] website here [http://memory.loc.gov/master/mss/mtj/mtj1/028/0100/0191.jpg].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

#* Although Madison tried to keep a low profile in regards to religion, he seemed to hold religious opinions, like many of his contemporaries, that were closer to deism or Unitarianism in theology than conventional Christianity.

#* Towards the end of his life, he wrote, "I reverence God as my creator. As creator of the world. I reverence him with holy fear. I venerate Jesus Christ as my redeemer; and, as far as I can understand, the redeemer of the world. But this belief is dark and dubious."&lt;ref name="UU.JQA" /&gt;

#* Life before the presidency
#** Some believe that for much of his life, Lincoln was a Deist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/john_remsburg/six_historic_americans/chapter_5.html Six Historic Americans: Abraham Lincoln] John E. Remsburg, 1906&lt;/ref&gt;
#** Rev. Dr. [[Phineas D. Gurley]], pastor of the New York Avenue Presbyterian church in Washington D.C., which Lincoln attended with his wife when he attended any church, never claimed a conversion. According to D. James Kennedy in his booklet, "What They Believed: The Faith of Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln", "Dr. Gurley said that Lincoln had wanted to make a public profession of his faith on Easter Sunday morning. But then came Ford's Theater." (p.&amp;nbsp;59, Published by Coral Ridge Ministries, 2003) Though this is possible, we have no way of verifying the truth of the report. The chief evidence against it is that Dr. Gurley, so far as we know, never mentioned it publicly. The determination to join, if accurate, would have been extremely newsworthy. It would have been reasonable for Dr. Gurley to have mentioned it at the funeral in the White House, in which he delivered the sermon which has been preserved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/gurley.htm White House Funeral Sermon for President Lincoln] Abraham Lincoln Online&lt;/ref&gt; The only evidence we have is an affidavit signed more than sixty years later by Mrs. Sidney I. Lauck, then a very old woman. In her affidavit signed under oath in Essex County, New Jersey, February 15, 1928, she said, "After Mr. Lincoln's death, Dr. Gurley told me that Mr. Lincoln had made all the necessary arrangements with him and the Session of the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church to be received into the membership of the said church, by confession of his faith in Christ, on the Easter Sunday following the Friday night when Mr. Lincoln was assassinated." Mrs. Lauck was, she said, about thirty years of age at the time of the assassination.
#** [[John Remsburg]], President of the [[American Secular Union]], argued against claims of Lincoln's conversion in his book ''Six Historic Americans'' (1906). He cites several of Lincoln's close associates:
#*** ''The man who stood nearest to President Lincoln at Washington – nearer than any clergyman or newspaper correspondent – was his private secretary, [[John George Nicolay|Col. John G. Nicolay]]. In a letter dated May 27, 1865, Colonel Nicolay says: "Mr. Lincoln did not, to my knowledge, in any way change his religious ideas, opinions, or beliefs from the time he left Springfield to the day of his death."''
#*** ''After his assassination [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mrs. Lincoln]] said: "Mr. Lincoln had no hope and no faith in the usual acceptance of these words." His lifelong friend and executor, [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|Judge David Davis]], affirmed the same: "He had no faith in the Christian sense of the term." His biographer, [[Ward Hill Lamon|Colonel Lamon]], intimately acquainted with him in Illinois, and with him during all the years that he lived in Washington, says: "Never in all that time did he let fall from his lips or his pen an expression which remotely implied the slightest faith in Jesus as the son of God and the Savior of men."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/john_remsburg/six_historic_americans/chapter_5.html#3 Chapter III – Review Of Christian Testimony: Reed And His Witnesses] Six Historic Americans: Abraham Lincoln, John E.

#* Eisenhower's religious upbringing is the subject of some controversy, due to the conversion of his parents to the [[Bible Student movement]], the forerunner of the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], in the late 1890s. Originally, the family belonged to the [[River Brethren]], a [[Mennonite]] sect.&lt;ref name="DDE library" /&gt; According to the Eisenhower Presidential Library, there is no evidence that Eisenhower participated in either the Bible Student group or the Jehovah's Witnesses, and there are records that show he attended [[Sunday school]] at a River Brethren church.&lt;ref name="DDE library" /&gt;
#* Until he became president, Eisenhower had no formal church affiliation, a circumstance he attributed to the frequent moves demanded of an Army officer. He was baptized, confirmed, and became a communicant in the Presbyterian church in a single ceremony February 1, 1953, just 12 days after his first inauguration, the only president to undergo any of these rites while in office.&lt;ref name="DDE library" /&gt;
#* Eisenhower was instrumental in the addition of the words "''under God''" to the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]] in 1954 (an act highly promoted by the [[Knights of Columbus]]), and the 1956 adoption of "''[[In God We Trust]]''" as the [[motto]] of the USA, and its 1957 introduction on paper currency. He composed a prayer for his first inauguration, began his Cabinet meetings with silent prayer, and met frequently with a wide range of religious leaders while in office.&lt;ref name="DDE library" /&gt;

{{Status of religious freedom |persecution}}
'''Religious antisemitism''' is aversion to or discrimination against Jews as a whole based on religious beliefs, false claims against [[Judaism]] and religious [[antisemitic canards]]. It is sometimes called '''theological antisemitism'''.

Some scholars have argued that modern antisemitism is primarily based on nonreligious factors. [[John Higham (historian)|John Higham]] being emblematic of this school of thought. However, this interpretation has been challenged. In 1966 [[Charles Glock]] and [[Rodney Stark]] first published public option polling data showing that most Americans based their stereotypes of Jews on religion. Further opinion polling since in America and Europe has supported this conclusion.&lt;ref name ="Michael"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5G3feplFBYUC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=religious+anti+semitism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjv9OCW9OzMAhVIOz4KHTLvAhgQ6AEINDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=religious%20anti%20semitism&amp;f=false| title = A Concise History of American Antisemitism | author= Robert Michael |publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield | page = 101 | year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of religious antisemitism==

Father [[Edward Flannery]] in his ''The Anguish of the Jew: Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism'', traces the first clear examples of specific anti-Jewish sentiment back to [[Alexandria]] in the third century BCE. Flannery writes that it was the Jews' refusal to accept Greek religious and social standards that marked them out. Hecataetus of Abdera, a Greek historian of the early third century BCE, wrote that Moses "in remembrance of the exile of his people, instituted for them a misanthropic and inhospitable way of life." [[Manetho]], an Egyptian historian, wrote that the Jews were expelled Egyptian [[Leprosy|lepers]] who had been taught by [[Moses]] "not to adore the gods." The same themes appeared in the works of [[Chaeremon]], [[Lysimachus]], [[Poseidonius]], [[Apollonius Molon]], and in [[Apion]] and [[Tacitus]]. [[Agatharchides of Cnidus]] wrote about the "ridiculous practices" of the Jews and of the "absurdity of their Law," and how [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy Lagus]] was able to invade [[Jerusalem]] in 320 BCE because its inhabitants were observing the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]].&lt;ref name=Flannery&gt;Flannery, Edward H. ''The Anguish of the Jews: Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism''. Paulist Press, first published in 1985; this edition 2004, pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian antisemitism==
{{main article|Christianity and antisemitism|Anti-Judaism}}

Christian religious antisemitism is often expressed as anti-Judaism, i.e., it is argued that the antipathy is to the practices of [[Judaism]]. As such, it is argued, antisemitism would cease if Jews stopped practicing or changed their public faith, especially by [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to Christianity, the official or right religion. However, there have been times when converts were also discriminated against, as in the case of liturgical exclusion of Jewish converts in the case of Christianized ''[[Marranos]]'' or Iberian Jews in the late 15th century and 16th century accused of secretly practising Judaism or Jewish customs.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Flannery, Edward H. ''The Anguish of the Jews: Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism'', Stimulus Books, first published 1985, this edition 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Testament and antisemitism===
{{Main article|Antisemitism in the New Testament}}

Frederick Schweitzer and Marvin Perry write that the authors of the gospel accounts sought to place responsibility for the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] and his death on Jews, rather than the Roman emperor or [[Pontius Pilate]].&lt;ref&gt;Perry &amp; Schweitzer (2002), pp. 27, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Christians for centuries viewed Jews as "the Christ Killers".&lt;ref name=Perry2002p18&gt;Perry &amp; Schweitzer (2002), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of the [[Second Temple]] was seen as judgment from God to the Jews for that death,&lt;ref&gt;Richardson (1986), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; and Jews were seen as "a people condemned forever to suffer exile and degradation".&lt;ref name=Perry2002p18/&gt; According to historian [[Edward H. Flannery]], the [[Gospel of John]] in particular contains many verses that refer to Jews in a pejorative manner.&lt;ref&gt;Flannery (2004) p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

In {{bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|2:14–16|31}}, [[Paul (apostle)|Paul]] states that the Churches in Judea had been persecuted by the Jews who killed Jesus and that such people displease God, oppose all men, and had prevented Paul from speaking to the gentile nations concerning the New Testament message. Described by [[Hyam Maccoby]] as "the most explicit outburst against Jews in Paul's Epistles",&lt;ref name=Maccoby203&gt;[[Hyam Maccoby]], ''The Mythmaker: Paul and the Invention of Christianity'', [[Harper &amp; Row]], 1986, {{ISBN|0-06-015582-5}}, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; these verses have repeatedly been employed for antisemitic purposes. Maccoby views it as one of Paul's innovations responsible for creating Christian antisemitism, though he notes that some have argued these particular verses are later interpolations not written by Paul.&lt;ref name=Maccoby203/&gt; [[Craig Blomberg]] argues that viewing them as antisemitic is a mistake, but "understandable in light of [Paul's] harsh words". In his view, Paul is not condemning all Jews forever, but merely those he believed had specifically persecuted the prophets, Jesus, or the 1st-century church. Blomberg sees Paul's words here as no different in kind than the harsh words the prophets of the Old Testament have for the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[[Craig Blomberg]], ''From Pentecost to Patmos: An Introduction to Acts Through Revelation'', [[B&amp;H Publishing Group]], 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-8054-3248-0}}, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Christianity===
A number of early and influential Church works — such as the dialogues of [[Justin Martyr]], the homilies of [[John Chrysostom]], and the testimonies of church father [[Cyprian]] — are strongly anti-Jewish.

During a discussion on the celebration of [[Easter]] during the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 CE, Roman emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] said, &lt;blockquote&gt; ...it appeared an unworthy thing that in the celebration of this most holy feast we should follow the practice of the Jews, who have impiously defiled their hands with enormous sin, and are, therefore, deservedly afflicted with blindness of soul. (...) Let us then have nothing in common with the detestable Jewish crowd; for we have received from our Saviour a different way.&lt;ref name=Eusebius&gt;[[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]]. [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/25023.htm "Life of Constantine (Book III)"], 337 CE. Retrieved March 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Prejudice against Jews in the [[Roman Empire]] was formalized in 438, when the ''Code of [[Theodosius II]]'' established Christianity as the only legal religion in the Roman Empire. The [[Justinian Code]] a century later stripped Jews of many of their rights, and Church councils throughout the 6th and 7th century, including the Council of Orleans, further enforced anti-Jewish provisions. These restrictions began as early as 305, when, in Elvira, (now [[Granada]]), a Spanish town in [[Andalucia]], the first known laws of any church council against Jews appeared. Christian women were forbidden to marry Jews unless the Jew first converted to Catholicism. Jews were forbidden to extend hospitality to Catholics. Jews could not keep Catholic Christian [[concubine]]s and were forbidden to bless the fields of Catholics. In 589, in Catholic [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], the [[Third Council of Toledo]] ordered that children born of marriage between Jews and Catholic be baptized by force. By the Twelfth Council of Toledo (681) a policy of forced conversion of all Jews was initiated (Liber Judicum, II.2 as given in Roth).&lt;ref name=Roth&gt;Roth, A. M. Roth, and Roth, Norman. ''Jews, Visigoths and Muslims in Medieval Spain'', Brill Academic, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands fled, and thousands of others converted to Roman Catholicism.

===Medieval and Renaissance Europe===
{{Main article|Jews in the Middle Ages|Antisemitism in Europe (Middle Ages)}}
Antisemitism was widespread in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]]. In those times, a main cause of prejudice against Jews in Europe was the religious one. Although not part of [[Roman Catholic]] [[dogma]], many Christians, including members of the [[clergy]], held the Jewish people [[collective guilt|collectively responsible]] for the death of Jesus, a practice originated by [[Melito of Sardis]].

Among socio-economic factors were restrictions by the authorities. Local rulers and church officials closed the doors for many professions to the Jews, pushing them into occupations considered socially inferior such as accounting, rent-collecting and [[moneylending]], which was tolerated then as a "[[consequentialism|necessary evil]]".&lt;ref name=Paley&gt;Paley, Susan and Koesters, Adrian Gibbons, eds. {{cite web|url=http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/pdf/ViewersGuide.pdf |title="A Viewer's Guide to Contemporary Passion Plays" |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301033826/http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/pdf/ViewersGuide.pdf |archivedate=2011-03-01 |df= }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(74.4&amp;nbsp;KB)}}.

[[File:Judensau Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|left|18th century Frankfurt Judensau]]
German for "Jews' sow", ''[[Judensau]]'' was the derogatory and dehumanizing imagery of Jews that appeared around the 13th century. Its popularity lasted for over 600 years and was revived by the Nazis. The Jews, typically portrayed in [[obscene]] contact with [[unclean animals]] such as [[pig]]s or [[owl]]s or representing a [[devil]], appeared on [[cathedral]] or [[church (building)|church]] ceilings, pillars, utensils, etchings, etc. Often, the images combined several antisemitic motifs and included derisive prose or poetry.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Dozens of Judensaus... intersect with the portrayal of the Jew as a [[deicide|Christ killer]]. Various illustrations of the murder of [[Simon of Trent]] blended images of Judensau, the [[devil]], the murder of little Simon himself, and the [[Crucifixion]]. In the 17th-century engraving from Frankfurt...&lt;ref&gt;Cohen's book includes an earlier variation of the same image.&lt;/ref&gt; a well-dressed, very contemporary-looking Jew has mounted the sow backward and holds her tail, while a second Jew sucks at her milk and a third eats her feces. The horned devil, himself wearing a [[Yellow badge|Jewish badge]], looks on and the butchered Simon, splayed as if on a cross, appears on a panel above."&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Cohen (2007): ''Christ Killers: The Jews and the Passion from the Bible to the Big Screen.''

In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''"[[Merchant of Venice]]",'' considered to be one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time, the villain [[Shylock]] was a Jewish moneylender. By the end of the play he is mocked on the streets after his daughter elopes with a Christian. Shylock, then, compulsorily converts to Christianity as a part of a deal gone wrong. This has raised profound implications regarding Shakespeare and antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berens.org/tikkun.html On Beyond Shylock] by Bradley S. Berens&lt;/ref&gt;

On many occasions, Jews were subjected to [[blood libel against Jews|blood libels]], false accusations of drinking the blood of Christian children in mockery of the Christian [[Eucharist]].
Jews were subject to a wide range of legal restrictions throughout the Middle Ages, some of which lasted until the end of the 19th century. Jews were excluded from many trades, the occupations varying with place and time, and determined by the influence of various non-Jewish competing interests. Often Jews were barred from all occupations but money-lending and peddling, with even these at times forbidden.

===19th century===
{{See also|Christianity and Judaism|Catholic Church and Judaism}}
[[File:proper hands.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Branford Clarke]] illustration of the KKK against both Jews and Catholics in [[Heroes of the Fiery Cross]] by Bishop [[Alma White]] 1928 Published by the [[Pillar of Fire Church]] in [[Zarephath, NJ]]]]
Throughout the 19th century and into the 20th, the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] still incorporated strong antisemitic elements, despite increasing attempts to separate [[anti-Judaism]], the opposition to the Jewish religion on religious grounds, and [[racial antisemitism]]. [[Pope Pius VII]] (1800–1823) had the walls of the Jewish [[Ghetto]] in Rome rebuilt after the Jews were [[Napoleon and the Jews|released by Napoleon]], and Jews were restricted to the Ghetto through the end of the Papal States in 1870.

Additionally, official organizations such as the [[Jesuits]] banned candidates "who are descended from the Jewish race unless it is clear that their father, grandfather, and great-grandfather have belonged to the Catholic Church" until 1946. Brown University historian [[David Kertzer]], working from the Vatican archive, has further argued in his book ''[[The Popes Against the Jews]]'' that in the 19th century and early 20th century the Church adhered to a distinction between "good antisemitism" and "bad antisemitism".

The "bad" kind promoted hatred of Jews because of their descent. This was considered un-Christian because the Christian message was intended for all of humanity regardless of ethnicity; anyone could become a Christian. The "good" kind criticized alleged Jewish conspiracies to control newspapers, banks, and other institutions, to care only about accumulation of wealth, etc. Many Catholic bishops wrote articles criticizing Jews on such grounds, and, when accused of promoting hatred of Jews, would remind people that they condemned the "bad" kind of antisemitism. Kertzer's work is not, therefore, without critics; scholar of Jewish-Christian relations [[Rabbi David G. Dalin]], for example, criticized Kertzer in the ''[[Weekly Standard]]'' for using evidence selectively.

===The Holocaust===
{{further|Martin Luther and antisemitism}}

The Nazis used [[Martin Luther]]'s book, ''[[On the Jews and Their Lies]]'' (1543), to [[Luther and antisemitism#Use by the Nazis|claim]] a moral righteousness for their ideology.  Luther even went so far as to advocate the murder of those Jews who refused to convert to Christianity, writing that "we are at fault in not slaying them"&lt;ref&gt;Luther, Martin. ''On the Jews and Their'' ''Lies'', cited in Robert.Michael. "Luther, Luther Scholars, and the Jews,"''Encounter'' 46 (Autumn 1985) No.4.343–344&lt;/ref&gt;

Archbishop [[Robert Runcie]] has asserted that: "Without centuries of Christian antisemitism, Hitler's passionate hatred would never have been so fervently echoed...because for centuries Christians have held Jews collectively responsible for the death of [[Jesus]]. On Good Friday Jews, have in times past, cowered behind locked doors with fear of a Christian mob seeking 'revenge' for deicide. Without the poisoning of Christian minds through the centuries, the Holocaust is unthinkable."&lt;ref&gt;"''After the evil: Christianity and Judaism in the shadow of the Holocaust"'', Richard Harries, p. 21, Oxford University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The dissident Catholic priest [[Hans Küng]] has written that "Nazi anti-Judaism was the work of godless, anti-Christian criminals. But it would not have been possible without the almost two thousand years' pre-history of 'Christian' anti-Judaism..."&lt;ref&gt;Hans Küng, ''On Being a Christian'' (Doubleday, Garden City NY, 1976), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The document [[Dabru Emet]] was issued by many American Jewish scholars in 2000 as a statement about Jewish-Christian relations. This document states,&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Nazism was not a Christian phenomenon. Without the long history of Christian anti-Judaism and Christian violence against Jews, Nazi ideology could not have taken hold nor could it have been carried out. Too many Christians participated in, or were sympathetic to, Nazi atrocities against Jews. Other Christians did not protest sufficiently against these atrocities. But Nazism itself was not an inevitable outcome of Christianity."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to American [[historian]] [[Lucy Dawidowicz]], antisemitism has a long history within Christianity. The line of "antisemitic descent" from Luther, the author of On the Jews and Their Lies, to Hitler is "easy to draw." In her ''[[The War Against the Jews]], 1933-1945'', she contends that Luther and Hitler were obsessed by the "demonologized universe" inhabited by Jews. Dawidowicz writes that the similarities between Luther's anti-Jewish writings and modern antisemitism are no coincidence, because they derived from a common history of ''Judenhass'', which can be traced to [[Haman (Bible)|Haman's]] advice to [[Ahasuerus]]. Although modern German antisemitism also has its roots in German [[nationalism]] and the [[liberalism|liberal]] revolution of 1848, [[Christianity|Christian]] antisemitism she writes is a foundation that was laid by the [[Roman Catholic Church]]  and "upon which Luther built."&lt;ref&gt;''The War Against the Jews, 1933-1945''. First published 1975; this Bantam edition 1986, p.23. {{ISBN|0-553-34532-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawidowicz' allegations and positions are criticized and not accepted by most historians however. For example, in "Studying the Jew" Alan Steinweis notes that, "Old-fashioned antisemitism, Hitler argued, was insufficient, and would lead only to pogroms, which contribute little to a permanent solution. This is why, Hitler maintained, it was important to promote 'an antisemitism of reason,' one that acknowledged the racial basis of Jewry."&lt;ref&gt;(Studying the Jew: Scholarly Antisemitism in Nazi Germany by Alan Steinweis :8)&lt;/ref&gt; Interviews with Nazis by other historians show that the Nazis thought that their views were rooted in biology, not historical prejudices. For example, "S. became a missionary for this biomedical vision... As for anti-Semitic attitudes and actions, he insisted that 'the racial question... [and] resentment of the Jewish race... had nothing to do with medieval anti-Semitism...' That is, it was all a matter of scientific biology and of community."&lt;ref&gt;(The Nazi Doctors: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide by Robert Lifton :130)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Holocaust===

The [[Second Vatican Council]], the ''[[Nostra aetate]]'' document, and the efforts of [[Pope John Paul II]] helped reconcile Jews and Catholicism in recent decades, however. According to Catholic Holocaust scholar [[Michael Phayer]], the Church as a whole recognized its failings during the council, when it corrected the traditional beliefs of the Jews having committed deicide and affirmed that they remained [[Jews as the chosen people|God's chosen people]].&lt;ref&gt;"''Pius XII, The Holocaust and the Cold War''", Indiana University Press, p. 252, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-253-34930-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the Church Council of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], the largest [[Lutheran]] denomination in the United States and a member of the [[Lutheran World Federation]] publicly [[Luther and antisemitism#Recent Lutheran Church responses|rejected]] Luther's antisemitic writings.

===Accusations of deicide===
{{Main article|Jewish deicide}}

Though never a part of [[Christian]] [[dogma]], many Christians, including members of the [[clergy]], held the Jewish people under an [[antisemitic canard]] to be [[collective guilt|collectively responsible]] for [[deicide]], the [[Jewish deicide|killing of Jesus]], whom they believed was the son of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/jubilee_2000/magazine/documents/ju_mag_01111997_p-31_en.html|title=Nostra Aetate: a milestone - Pier Francesco Fumagalli|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this interpretation, the Jews present at Jesus' death as well as the Jewish people collectively and for all time had committed the sin of deicide, or God-killing. The accusation has been the most powerful warrant for antisemitism by Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Perry &amp; Schweitzer (2002), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Passion play]]s are dramatic stagings representing the trial and death of [[Jesus]] and they have historically been used in remembrance of Jesus' death during [[Lent]]. These plays historically blamed the Jews for [[deicide|the death of Jesus]] in a [[polemic]]al fashion, depicting a crowd of Jewish people condemning Jesus to death by [[crucifixion]] and a Jewish leader assuming eternal [[collective guilt]] for the crowd for the murder of Jesus, which, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' explains, "for centuries prompted vicious attacks — or [[pogrom]]s — on Europe's Jewish communities".&lt;ref name=Sennott&gt;Sennott, Charles M.[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/04/10/in_poland_new_passion_plays_on_old_hatreds/ "In Poland, new 'Passion' plays on old hatreds"], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', April 10, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic antisemitism==
{{main article|Islam and antisemitism}}
{{See also|Antisemitism in the Arab world|History of the Jews under Muslim rule}}

With the origin of [[Islam]] in the 7th century AD and its rapid spread through the [[Arabian peninsula]] and beyond, Jews (and many other peoples) became subject to the will of Muslim rulers. The quality of the rule varied considerably in different periods, as did the attitudes of the rulers, government officials, clergy and general population to various subject peoples from time to time, which was reflected in their treatment of these subjects.

Various definitions of antisemitism in the context of Islam are given. The extent of antisemitism among [[Muslim]]s varies depending on the chosen definition:
*Scholars like [[Claude Cahen]] and [[Shelomo Dov Goitein]] define it to be the animosity specifically applied to Jews only and do not include discriminations practiced against Non-Muslims in general.&lt;ref name="Shelomo Dov Goitein"&gt;[[Shelomo Dov Goitein]], A Mediterranean Society: An Abridgment in One Volume, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cahen"&gt;"Dhimma" by Claude Cahen in [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OxfordDic"&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion,''Antisemitism''&lt;/ref&gt; For these scholars, antisemitism in Medieval Islam has been local and sporadic rather than general and endemic [Shelomo Dov Goitein],&lt;ref name="Shelomo Dov Goitein"/&gt; not at all present [Claude Cahen],&lt;ref name="Cahen"/&gt; or rarely present.&lt;ref name="OxfordDic"/&gt;
*According to [[Bernard Lewis]], antisemitism is marked by two distinct features: Jews are judged according to a standard different from that applied to others, and they are accused of "cosmic evil."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Bernard. "The New Anti-Semitism", The American Scholar, Volume 75 No. 1, Winter 2006, pp. 25–36. The paper is based on a lecture delivered at Brandeis University on March 24, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; For Lewis, from the late 19th century, movements appear among Muslims of which for the first time one can legitimately use the technical term antisemitic.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis(1984), p.184&lt;/ref&gt; However, he describes demonizing beliefs, anti-Jewish discrimination and systematic humiliations, as an "inherent" part of the traditional Muslim world, even if violent persecutions were relatively rare.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis(1984), p.8, 32–33, 41–45, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-modern times===
{{Status of religious freedom}}
According to Jane Gerber, "the Muslim is continually influenced by the theological threads of anti-Semitism embedded in the earliest chapters of Islamic history."&lt;ref name="Gerber 1986, p. 82"&gt;Gerber (1986), p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; In the light of the Jewish defeat at the hands of [[Muhammad]], Muslims traditionally viewed Jews with contempt and as objects of ridicule. Jews were seen as hostile, cunning, and vindictive, but nevertheless weak and ineffectual. Cowardice was the quality most frequently attributed to Jews. Another stereotype associated with the Jews was their alleged propensity to trickery and deceit. While most anti-Jewish polemicists saw those qualities as inherently Jewish, [[Ibn Khaldun]] attributed them to the mistreatment of Jews at the hands of the dominant nations. For that reason, says Ibn Khaldun, Jews "are renowned, in every age and climate, for their wickedness and their slyness".&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1999), pp. 129&amp;ndash;130&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muhammad]]'s attitude towards Jews was basically neutral at the beginning. During his lifetime, Jews lived on the [[Arabian Peninsula]], especially in and around [[Medina]]. They refused to accept Muhammad's teachings. Eventually he fought them, defeated them, and most of them were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur 191&amp;ndash;192&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sirah Rasul Allah|traditional biographies of Muhammad]] describe the expulsion of the [[Banu Qaynuqa]] in the post [[Battle of Badr|Badr]]period, after a marketplace quarrel broke out between the Muslims and the Jews in [[Medina]]&lt;ref&gt;Akram Diya al Umari (1991) ''Madinan Society At the Time of the Prophet,'' (Virginia: International Islamic Publishing House and the [[International Institute of Islamic Thought]]) "The Expulsion of Banu Qaynuqa"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodinson (1971), pg. 172-3&lt;/ref&gt; and Muhammad's negotiations with the tribe failed.&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1956), pg. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his defeat in the [[Battle of Uhud]], Muhammad said he received a divine revelation that the Jewish tribe of the [[Banu Nadir]] wanted to assassinate him. Muhammad besieged the Banu Nadir and expelled them from Medina.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman ''Jews of Arab Lands'' 14&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad also [[Battle of Khaybar|attacked the Jews of the Khaybar]] oasis near Medina and defeated them, after they had betrayed the [[Muslims]] in a time of war, and he only allowed them to stay in the oasis on the condition that they deliver one-half of their annual produce to Muslims.

Anti-Jewish sentiments usually flared up during times of Muslim political or military weakness or when Muslims felt that some Jews had overstepped the boundaries of humiliation prescribed to them by Islamic law.&lt;ref name="Lewis 1999 p. 130"&gt;Lewis (1999), p. 130; Gerber (1986), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, ibn Hazm and [[Abu Ishaq]] focused their anti-Jewish writings on the latter allegation. This was also the chief motivating factor behind the massacres of Jews in [[Granada]] in 1066, when nearly 3,000 Jews were killed, and in [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]] in 1033, when 6,000 Jews were killed.&lt;ref name=Morris10&gt;[[Benny Morris|Morris, Benny]]. ''Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-2001''. Vintage Books, 2001, pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; There were further massacres in Fez in 1276 and 1465.&lt;ref name="Gerber 1986, p. 84"&gt;Gerber (1986), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic law does not differentiate between Jews and Christians in their status as ''[[dhimmi]]s''. According to [[Bernard Lewis]], the normal practice of Muslim governments until modern times was consistent with this aspect of [[sharia]] law.&lt;ref name="Lewis p128"/&gt; This view is countered by Jane Gerber, who maintains that of all dhimmis, Jews had the lowest status. Gerber maintains that this situation was especially pronounced in the latter centuries in the [[Ottoman Empire]], where Christian communities enjoyed protection from the European countries&lt;!-- huh? --&gt;, which was unavailable to the Jews. For example, in 18th-century [[Damascus]], a Muslim noble held a festival, inviting to it all social classes in descending order, according to their social status: the Jews outranked only the peasants and the prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Gerber (1986), pp. 84&amp;ndash;85&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jews in Islamic texts===
[[Leon Poliakov]],&lt;ref name="EncJud"&gt;Poliakov&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Laqueur]],&lt;ref name="Laqueur192"/&gt; and [[Jane Gerber]],&lt;ref&gt;Gerber 78&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that later passages in the [[Qur'an]] contain very sharp attacks on Jews for their refusal to recognize [[Muhammad]] as a [[prophet]] of [[God]].&lt;ref name="EncJud"/&gt; There are also Qur'anic verses, particularly from the earliest Qur'anic [[sura]]hs, showing respect for the Jews (e.g. see {{Quran-usc|2|47}}, {{Quran-usc|2|62}})&lt;ref name="Poliakov (1961), pg. 27"&gt;Poliakov (1961), pg. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glazov, Jamie, "Symposium: The Koran and Anti-Semitism", FrontPageMag.com, June 25, 2004. (retrieved May 3, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and preaching tolerance (e.g. see {{Quran-usc|2|256}}).&lt;ref name="Laqueur192"&gt;Laqueur 192&lt;/ref&gt; This positive view tended to disappear in the later Surahs. Taking it all together, the Qur'an differentiates between "good and bad" Jews, Poliakov states.&lt;ref name="Poliakov (1961), pg. 27"/&gt; Laqueur argues that the conflicting statements about Jews in the Muslim holy text have defined [[Arab]] and Muslim attitudes towards Jews to this day, especially during periods of rising [[Islamic fundamentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur 191&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences with Christianity===
[[Bernard Lewis]] holds that Muslims were not antisemitic in the way Christians were for the most part because:
# The [[Gospel]]s are not part of the educational system in Muslim societies and therefore, Muslims are not brought up with the stories of [[Jewish deicide]]; on the contrary, the notion of deicide is rejected by the Qur'an as a blasphemous absurdity.
# Muhammad and his early followers were not Jews and therefore, they did not present themselves as the true Israel or feel threatened by the survival of the old Israel.
# The Qur'an was not viewed by Muslims as a fulfillment of the [[Hebrew Bible]], but rather as a restorer of its original messages that had been distorted over time. Thus no clash of interpretations between [[Judaism]] and Islam could arise.
# Muhammad was not killed by the Jewish community and he was ultimately victorious in his clash with the Jewish community in Medina.
# Muhammad did not claim to be either the Son of God or the Messiah. Instead, he claimed that he was only a prophet; a claim which Jews repudiated less.
# Muslims saw the conflict between Muhammad and the Jews as something of minor importance in Muhammad's career.&lt;ref name="Lewis 1999 p117-118"&gt;Lewis (1999), pp. 117-118&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status of Jews under Muslim rule===
Traditionally Jews living in Muslim lands, known (along with Christians) as [[dhimmis]], were allowed to practice their religion and to administer their internal affairs but subject to certain conditions.&lt;ref name = "Gerber p10,20"&gt;Lewis (1984), pp.10,20&lt;/ref&gt; They had to pay the [[jizya]](a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males) to Muslims.&lt;ref name = "Gerber p10,20"/&gt; Dhimmis had an inferior status under Islamic rule. They had several social and legal [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]] such as prohibitions against bearing arms or giving testimony in courts in cases involving Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1987), p. 9, 27&lt;/ref&gt; The most degrading one was the requirement of distinctive clothing, not found in the Qur'an or hadith but invented in [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] [[Baghdad]]; its enforcement was highly erratic.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1999), p.131&lt;/ref&gt; Jews rarely faced martyrdom or exile, or forced compulsion to change their religion, and they were mostly free in their choice of residence and profession.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1999), p.131; (1984), pp.8,62&lt;/ref&gt;

The notable examples of massacre of Jews include the [[1066 Granada massacre]], when a Muslim mob stormed the royal palace in [[Granada]], [[crucifixion|crucified]] [[Jew]]ish [[vizier]] [[Joseph ibn Naghrela]] and massacred most of the Jewish population of the city. "More than 1,500 Jewish families, numbering 4,000 persons, fell in one day."&lt;ref name = "Gottheil-1906"&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=412&amp;letter=G&amp;search=Granada Granada] by Richard Gottheil, [[Meyer Kayserling]], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. 1906 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first persecution of Jews on the Peninsula under Islamic rule. There was also the killing or forcibly conversion of them by the rulers of the [[Almohad]] dynasty in [[Al-Andalus]] in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), p. 52; Stillman (1979), p.77&lt;/ref&gt; Notable examples of the cases where the choice of residence was taken away from them includes confining Jews to walled quarters ([[mellah]]s) in Morocco beginning from the 15th century and especially since the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Most conversions were voluntary and happened for various reasons. However, there were some forced conversions in the 12th century under the [[Almohad]]dynasty of North Africa and [[al-Andalus]] as well as in Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), pp.17,18,94,95; Stillman (1979), p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-modern times===
The portrayal of the Jews in the early Islamic texts played a key role in shaping the attitudes towards them in the Muslim societies. According to [[Jane Gerber]], "the Muslim is continually influenced by the theological threads of anti-Semitism embedded in the earliest chapters of Islamic history."&lt;ref name="Gerber 1986, p. 82"/&gt; In the light of the Jewish defeat at the hands of Muhammad, Muslims traditionally viewed Jews with contempt and as objects of ridicule. Jews were seen as hostile, cunning, and vindictive, but nevertheless weak and ineffectual. Cowardice was the quality most frequently attributed to Jews. Another stereotype associated with the Jews was their alleged propensity to trickery and deceit. While most anti-Jewish polemicists saw those qualities as inherently Jewish, [[Ibn Khaldun]] attributed them to the mistreatment of Jews at the hands of the dominant nations. For that reason, says ibn Khaldun, Jews "are renowned, in every age and climate, for their wickedness and their slyness".&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1999), pp. 129–130&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Muslim writers have inserted racial overtones in their anti-Jewish polemics. [[Al-Jahiz]] speaks of the deterioration of the Jewish stock due to excessive inbreeding. [[Ibn Hazm]] also implies racial qualities in his attacks on the Jews. However, these were exceptions, and the racial theme left little or no trace in the medieval Muslim anti-Jewish writings.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1999), pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-Jewish sentiments usually flared up at times of the Muslim political or military weakness or when Muslims felt that some Jews had overstepped the boundary of humiliation prescribed to them by the Islamic law.&lt;ref name="Lewis 1999 p. 130"/&gt; In [[Al-Andalus|Moorish Iberia]], ibn Hazm and [[Abu Ishaq]] focused their anti-Jewish writings on the latter allegation. This was also the chief motivation behind the 1066 Granada massacre, when "[m]ore than 1,500 Jewish families, numbering 4,000 persons, fell in one day",&lt;ref name = "Gottheil-1906"/&gt; and in [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]] in 1033, when 6,000 Jews were killed.&lt;ref name=Morris10&gt;[[Benny Morris|Morris, Benny]]. ''Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881–2001''. Vintage Books, 2001, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; There were further massacres in Fez in 1276 and 1465.&lt;ref name="Gerber 1986, p. 84"/&gt;

Islamic law does not differentiate between Jews and Christians in their status as dhimmis. According to [[Bernard Lewis]], the normal practice of Muslim governments until modern times was consistent with this aspect of [[sharia]] law.&lt;ref name = "Lewis p128"&gt;Lewis (1999), p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; This view is countered by Jane Gerber, who maintains that of all dhimmis, Jews had the lowest status. Gerber maintains that this situation was especially pronounced in the latter centuries, when Christian communities enjoyed protection, unavailable to the Jews, under the provisions of [[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire]]. For example, in 18th century [[Damascus]], a Muslim noble held a festival, inviting to it all social classes in descending order, according to their social status: the Jews outranked only the peasants and prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Gerber (1986), pp. 84–85&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865, when the equality of all subjects of the Ottoman Empire was proclaimed, [[Ahmed Cevdet Pasha]], a high-ranking official observed: "whereas in former times, in the Ottoman State, the communities were ranked, with the Muslims first, then the Greeks, then the Armenians, then the Jews, now all of them were put on the same level. Some Greeks objected to this, saying: 'The government has put us together with the Jews. We were content with the supremacy of Islam.'"&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1999), pp. 136–137; Gerber (1986), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have questioned the correctness of the term "antisemitism" to Muslim culture in pre-modern times.&lt;ref name="Lewis 1999 p117-118" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cahen, Cl. "[http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_SIM-1823 ḎH̲imma.]" Encyclopaedia of Islam. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2006.

According to Chazan and Davies, this lack of uniqueness ameliorated the circumstances of Jews in the medieval world of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of religion, anti-semitism article.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Norman Stillman]], antisemitism, understood as hatred of Jews as Jews, "did exist in the medieval Arab world even in the period of greatest tolerance".&lt;ref&gt;Stillman (1979), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Also see Bostom, Bat Ye'or, and the CSPI issued text, supporting Stillman and cited in the bibliography.

===Nineteenth century===
Historian [[Martin Gilbert]] writes that in the 19th century the position of Jews worsened in Muslim countries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

There was a massacre of Jews in [[Baghdad]] in 1828&lt;ref name=Morris10/&gt; and in 1839, in the eastern Persian city of [[Meshed]], a mob burst into the Jewish Quarter, burned the synagogue, and destroyed the [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]]. It was only by forcible conversion that a massacre was averted.&lt;ref name=Gilbert179&gt;[[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Dearest Auntie Fori. The Story of the Jewish People''. HarperCollins, 2002, pp. 179–182.&lt;/ref&gt; There was another massacre in Barfurush in 1867.&lt;ref name=Morris10/&gt;

In 1840, the [[History of the Jews in Syria|Jews of Damascus]] were falsely accused of having murdered a Christian monk and his Muslim servant and of having [[blood libel|used their blood]] to bake [[Matzo|Passover bread]] or Matza. A Jewish barber was tortured until he "confessed"; two other Jews who were arrested died under torture, while a third converted to Islam to save his life. Throughout the 1860s, the [[History of the Jews in Libya|Jews of Libya]] were subjected to what Gilbert calls punitive taxation. In 1864, around 500 Jews were killed in [[Marrakech]] and [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]] in [[Morocco]]. In 1869, 18 Jews were killed in [[Tunis]], and an Arab mob looted Jewish homes and stores, and burned synagogues, on [[Djerba|Jerba Island]]. In 1875, 20 Jews were killed by a mob in [[Demnat]], Morocco; elsewhere in Morocco, Jews were attacked and killed in the streets in broad daylight. In 1891, the leading Muslims in [[Jerusalem]] asked the Ottoman authorities in [[Constantinople]] to prohibit the entry of Jews arriving from Russia. In 1897, synagogues were ransacked and Jews were murdered in [[Tripolitania]].&lt;ref name=Gilbert179/&gt;

[[Benny Morris]] writes that one symbol of Jewish degradation was the phenomenon of stone-throwing at Jews by Muslim children. Morris quotes a 19th-century traveler: "I have seen a little fellow of six years old, with a troop of fat toddlers of only three and four, teaching [them] to throw stones at a Jew, and one little urchin would, with the greatest coolness, waddle up to the man and literally spit upon his Jewish [[gaberdine]]. To all this the Jew is obliged to submit; it would be more than his life was worth to offer to strike a Mahommedan."&lt;ref name=Morris10/&gt;

According to [[Mark R. Cohen|Mark Cohen]] in ''The Oxford Handbook of Jewish Studies'', most scholars conclude that Arab antisemitism in the modern world arose in the 19th century, against the backdrop of conflicting Jewish and Arab nationalism, and was imported into the Arab world primarily by nationalistically minded Christian Arabs (and only subsequently was it "Islamized").&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark R. Cohen|Mark Cohen]] (2002), p.208&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Islamic antisemitism===
{{see also|Jewish exodus from Arab lands}}
The massacres of Jews in Muslim countries continued into the 20th century. Martin Gilbert writes that 40 Jews were murdered in [[Taza]], Morocco in 1903. In 1905, old laws were revived in [[Yemen]] forbidding Jews from raising their voices in front of Muslims, building their houses higher than Muslims, or engaging in any traditional Muslim trade or occupation.&lt;ref name=Gilbert179/&gt; The Jewish quarter in Fez was almost destroyed by a Muslim mob in 1912.&lt;ref name=Morris10/&gt;

Antagonism and violence increased still further as resentment against [[Zionism|Zionist]] efforts in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] spread. The [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]], [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]] played a key role in violent opposition to Zionism and closely allied himself with the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ilan Pappe|Pappe, Ilan]] (2002) 'The Rise and Fall of a Palestinian Dynasty. The Husaynis 1700-1948.'' AL Saqi edition 2010. {{ISBN|978-0-86356-460-4}}. pp.309,321&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Aharon Cohen|Cohen, Aharon]] (1970) ''Israel and the Arab World''. W.H. Allen. {{ISBN|0-491-00003-0}}. p.312&lt;/ref&gt; From 1941 al-Husayni was based in Germany from where he urged attacks on Jews. There were [[Nazism|Nazi]]-inspired pogroms in [[Algeria]] in the 1930s, and massive attacks on the Jews in [[Iraq]] and [[Libya]] in the 1940s (see [[Farhud]]). Pro-Nazi Muslims slaughtered dozens of Jews in Baghdad in 1941.&lt;ref name=Morris10/&gt;

[[Anti-Zionism|Anti-Zionist]] propaganda in the Middle East frequently adopts the terminology and symbols of [[the Holocaust]] to [[Demonization|demonize]] Israel and its leaders. At the same time, [[Holocaust denial]] and Holocaust minimization efforts have found increasingly overt acceptance as sanctioned historical discourse in a number of Middle Eastern countries. Arabic- and Turkish-editions of Hitler's''[[Mein Kampf]]'' and ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' have found an audience in the region with limited critical response by local intellectuals and media. See [[International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust]].

According to [[Robert Satloff]], Muslims and Arabs were involved both as rescuers and as perpetrators of the Holocaust during pro-Nazi rule of Vichy in French North Africa, and during Italian and German Nazi occupation of Tunisia and Libya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meforum.org/article/1073Righteous Muslims. A briefing by Robert Satloff]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by Rachel Silverman, ''Jewish Exponent'', December 14, 2006 ([[Middle East Forum]], December 11, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a [[Pew Global Attitudes Project]] report released on  August 14, 2005, Anti-Jewish sentiment was endemic. Of six Muslim majority countries surveyed, all have high percentages of their populations with unfavorable views of Jews. [[Turkey]] reported that 60% had unfavorable views of Jews, [[Pakistan]] reported 74%, [[Indonesia]] reported 76%, and [[Morocco]] reported 88%. 100% of [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] Muslims viewed Jews unfavorably, as did 99% of the [[Jordan]]ian people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?ReportID=248 PEW Global Attitudes Report] statistics on how the world views different religious groups&lt;/ref&gt;

George Gruen attributes the increased animosity towards Jews in the [[Arab world]] to several factors, including the breakdown of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and traditional [[Islamic]] society; domination by Western [[colonialism|colonial powers]] under which Jews gained a larger role in the commercial, professional, and administrative life of the region; the rise of [[Arab nationalism]], whose proponents sought the wealth and positions of local Jews through government channels; resentment against Jewish [[nationalism]] and the Zionist movement; and the readiness of unpopular [[regime]]s to [[scapegoat]] local Jews for political purposes.&lt;ref name=Gruen&gt;Gruen, George E.[http://www.jcpa.org/jl/jl102.htm "The Other Refugees: Jews of the Arab World"], ''The Jerusalem Letter'', [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], June 1, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blood libel==
{{main article|Blood libel}}
[[Blood libels]] are false accusations that Jews use human blood in religious [[rituals]].&lt;ref&gt;"Blood Accusation", Jewish Encyclopedia, retrieved 7 May 2007.[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1173&amp;letter=B Jewish Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;
Historically these are accusations that the blood of [[Christian]] children is especially coveted. In many cases, blood libels served as the basis for a blood libel [[cult]], in which the alleged victim of human sacrifice was elevated to the status of a [[martyr]] and, in some cases, [[canonized]].

Although the first known instance of a blood libel is found in the writings of [[Apion]], who claimed that the Jews sacrificed [[Greeks|Greek]] victims in the Temple, no further incidents are recorded until the 12th century, when blood libels began to proliferate. These libels have persisted from then through the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;"The World: Saudi Editor Retracts Article That Defamed Jews", Los Angeles Times, March 20, 2003, fetched 19 the April 2008, [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/110674395.html?dids=110674395:110674395&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+20%2C+2002&amp;author=MICHAEL+SLACKMAN&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.3&amp;desc=The+World%3B+Saudi+Editor+Retracts+Article+That+Defamed+Jews]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, blood libel continues to be a major aspect of antisemitism. It has extended its reach to accuse Jews of many different forms of harm that can be carried out against other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antisemitism.uk/recognising-antisemitism/blood-libel/|title=Recognising Antisemitism: Blood Libel|date=2016-02-15|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Basic Forms of government}}
A '''republic''' ({{lang-la|[[res publica]]|links=yes}}) is a [[form of government]] in which the country is considered a "public matter", not the [[Res privata|private concern or property]] of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are not inherited. It is a form of government under which the [[head of state]] is not a [[monarch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UTkBAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22res%20publica%22%20republic%20democracy%20monarch&amp;pg=PA640#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20republic,%20according%20to%20the%20modern%20usage%20of%20the%20word,%20signifies%20a%20political%20community%20which%20is%20not%20under%20monarchical%20government%22&amp;f=false|title=The Standard Library Cyclopedia of Political, Constitutional, Statistical and Forensic Knowledge|last=Bohn|first=H.

In [[American English]], the definition of a republic refers specifically to a form of government in which elected individuals represent the citizen body&lt;ref name="M-W"/&gt; and exercise power according to the [[rule of law]] under a [[constitution]], including [[separation of powers]] with an elected [[head of state]], referred to as a '''constitutional republic'''&lt;ref name=Woodburn&gt;Woodburn, James Albert.

{{As of|2017}}, [[List of countries by system of government|159]] of the world's [[List of sovereign states|206 sovereign states]] use the word "republic" as part of their official names – not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word "republic" used in the names of all nations with elected governments. While heads of state often tend to claim that they rule only by the "[[consent of the governed]]", elections in some countries have been found to be held more for the purpose of "[[Election#Sham_election|show]]" than for the actual purpose of in reality providing citizens with any genuine ability to choose their own leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://time.com/17720/north-korea-election-a-sham-worth-studying/ North Korea Elections: A Sham Worth Studying] Time magazine. By Emily Rauhala.  Mar 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''republic'' comes from the Latin term ''res publica'', which literally means "public thing," "public matter," or "public affair" and was used to refer to the state as a whole. The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient [[Roman Republic]], lasting from the [[Overthrow of the Roman monarchy|overthrow of the kings]] in 509 B.C. to the establishment of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] in 27 B.C. This [[Constitution of the Roman Republic|constitution]] was characterized by a [[Roman Senate|Senate]] comprised of wealthy aristocrats and wielding significant influence; [[Curiate Assembly|several]] [[Centuriate Assembly|popular]] [[Tribal Assembly|assemblies]] of all free citizens, possessing the power to elect magistrates and pass laws; and a [[Cursus honorum|series of magistracies]] with varying types of civil and political authority. With power spread so widely, the Roman constitution epitomized the republican ideals of both [[Mixed government|mixed government]] and broad public participation in politics. These ideals would prove influential in the modern revival of republican political thought during the Italian Renaissance.

Most often a republic is a single [[sovereign state]], but there are also sub-sovereign state entities that are referred to as republics, or that have governments that are described as "republican" in nature.

It was seen as authoritarian, as its electoral system was structured so as to automatically guarantee the election of government-sponsored candidates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UV3Yp0NFip8C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=%22soviet+union+elections%22+rigged&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=26N2gy538Y&amp;sig=d0HPJxJ96HSDWkDGA0x3WGRPx-o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVy_SJwPXWAhWLxVQKHXP1DtQQ6AEIogEwFA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22soviet%20union%20elections%22%20rigged&amp;f=false Democracy and Democratization: Processes and Prospects in a Changing World] Pg 15.

== Etymology ==
The term originates as the Latin translation of [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''[[politeia]]''. [[Cicero]], among other Latin writers, translated ''politeia'' as ''res publica'' and it was in turn translated by Renaissance scholars as "republic" (or similar terms in various western European languages).{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The term ''politeia'' can be translated as form of government, polity, or regime and is therefore not always a word for a specific type of regime as the modern word republic is. One of [[Plato]]'s major works on political science was titled ''Politeia'' and in English it is thus known as ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]''. However, apart from the title, in modern translations of ''The Republic'', alternative translations of ''politeia'' are also used.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allan Bloom|Bloom, Allan]]. ''The Republic''. Basic Books, 1991. pp. 439–40&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in Book III of his ''Politics'' (1279) Aristotle was apparently the first classical writer to state that the term ''politeia'' can be used to refer more specifically to one type of ''politeia'': "When the citizens at large govern for the public good, it is called by the name common to all governments (''to koinon onoma pasōn tōn politeiōn''), government (''politeia'')". Also amongst classical Latin, the term "republic" can be used in a general way to refer to any regime, or in a specific way to refer to governments which work for the public good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/political-science-terms-and-concepts/republic|title=Republic {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval [[Northern Italy]], a number of city states had [[Medieval commune|commune]] or [[signoria]] based governments. In the late Middle Ages, writers such as [[Giovanni Villani]] began writing about the nature of these states and the differences from other types of regime. They used terms such as ''libertas populi'', a free people, to describe the states. The terminology changed in the 15th century as the renewed interest in the writings of [[Ancient Rome]] caused writers to prefer using classical terminology. To describe non-monarchical states writers, most importantly [[Leonardo Bruni]], adopted the Latin phrase ''[[res publica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rubinstein, Nicolai. "Machiavelli and Florentine Republican Experience" in ''Machiavelli and Republicanism'' Cambridge University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Bruni and [[Machiavelli]] used the term to describe the states of Northern Italy, which were not monarchies, the term ''res publica'' has a set of interrelated meanings in the original Latin. The term can quite literally be translated as "public matter".&lt;ref name=Ideas2099&gt;"Republic"j, ''New Dictionary of the History of Ideas''. Ed. [[Maryanne Cline Horowitz]]. Vol. 5. Detroit: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2005. p. 2099&lt;/ref&gt; It was most often used by Roman writers to refer to the state and government, even during the period of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Lewis|first=Charlton T.|author2=Charles Short |title=res, II.K|encyclopedia=[[A Latin Dictionary]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1879|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dres|accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent centuries, the English word "[[commonwealth]]" came to be used as a translation of ''res publica'', and its use in English was comparable to how the Romans used the term ''res publica''.&lt;ref name=Haakonssen&gt;Haakonssen, Knud. "Republicanism." ''A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy''. Robert E. Goodin and Philip Pettit. eds. Cambridge: Blackwell, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, during [[The Protectorate]] of [[Oliver Cromwell]] the word commonwealth was the most common term to call the new monarchless state, but the word republic was also in common use.&lt;ref name=Kingsxxiii&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Everdell|2000}} p. xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in [[Polish language|Polish]] the term was translated as ''[[:wikt:rzeczpospolita|rzeczpospolita]]'', although the translation is now only used with respect to Poland.

Presently, the term "republic" commonly means a system of government which derives its power from the people rather than from another basis, such as [[heredity]] or [[divine right of kings|divine right]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/republic-government|title=Encyclopedia Britannica|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
While the philosophical terminology developed in classical Greece and Rome, as already noted by Aristotle there was already a long history of city states with a wide variety of constitutions, not only in Greece but also in the Middle East. After the classical period, during the [[Middle Ages]], many free cities developed again, such as [[Venice]].

=== Classical republics ===
{{Main article|Classical republic}}
[[File:Republica Romana.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|A map of the [[Roman Republic]]]]

The modern type of "republic" itself is different from any type of state found in the classical world.&lt;ref&gt;Nippel, Wilfried. "Ancient and Modern Republicanism." ''The Invention of the Modern Republic'' ed. Biancamaria Fontana. Cambridge University Press, 1994 p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reno, Jeffrey. "republic." ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, there are a number of states of the [[classical era]] that are today still called republics. This includes ancient [[Classical Athens|Athens]] and the [[Roman Republic]]. While the structure and governance of these states was very different from that of any modern republic, there is debate about the extent to which classical, medieval, and modern republics form a historical continuum. [[J. G. A. Pocock]] has argued that a distinct republican tradition stretches from the classical world to the present.&lt;ref name="Ideas2099"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pocock&gt;Pocock, J.G.A. ''The Machiavellian Moment: Florentine Political Thought and the Atlantic Republican Tradition'' (1975; new ed. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars disagree.&lt;ref name="Ideas2099"/&gt; Paul Rahe, for instance, argues that the classical republics had a form of government with few links to those in any modern country.&lt;ref name=Rahe&gt;Paul A. Rahe, ''Republics, Ancient and Modern'', three volumes, University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

The political philosophy of the classical republics has in any case had an influence on republican thought throughout the subsequent centuries. Philosophers and politicians advocating republics, such as [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]], [[Montesquieu]], [[John Adams|Adams]], and [[James Madison|Madison]], relied heavily on classical Greek and Roman sources which described various types of regimes.

[[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' discusses various forms of government. One form Aristotle named ''politeia'', which consisted of a mixture of the other forms. He argued that this was one of the ideal forms of government. [[Polybius]] expanded on many of these ideas, again focusing on the idea of [[mixed government]]. The most important Roman work in this tradition is Cicero's ''[[De re publica]]''.

Over time, the classical republics were either conquered by empires or became ones themselves. Most of the Greek republics were annexed to the [[Macedonian Empire]] of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]. The Roman Republic expanded dramatically conquering the other states of the Mediterranean that could be considered republics, such as [[Carthage]]. The Roman Republic itself then became the Roman Empire.

=== Other ancient republics ===
The term "republic" is not commonly used to refer to pre-classical city states, especially if outside Europe and the area which was under Graeco-Roman influence.&lt;ref name="Ideas2099"/&gt; However some early states outside Europe had governments that are sometimes today considered similar to republics.

In the [[ancient Near East]], a number of cities of the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] achieved collective rule. [[Arwad]] has been cited as one of the earliest known examples of a republic, in which the people, rather than a monarch, are described as sovereign.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bernal, ''Black Athena Writes Back'' (Durham: Duke University Press, 2001), p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2018}} The [[Israelite]] confederation of the era before the [[United Monarchy]] has also been considered a type of republic.&lt;ref name="Ideas2099"/&gt;&lt;ref name="William R. Everdell 2000"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Everdell|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Africa the [[Kingdom of Aksum|Axum Empire]] was organized as a confederation ruled similarly to a royal republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/15|title=Aksum|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the [[Igbo people#Traditional society|Igbo]] nation of what is now [[Nigerian history|Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://upress.kent.edu/Nieman/Concepts_of_Democracy.htm "Concepts of Democracy and Democratization in Africa Revisited"].

The ancient [[Indian subcontinent]] had a number of early republics among [[Mahajanapadas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iloveindia.com/history/ancient-india/16-mahajanapadas.html 16 Mahajanapadas – Sixteen Mahajanapadas, 16 Maha Janapadas India, Maha Janapada Ancient India].

Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Early republican institutions comes from the independent "republics" of India, ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sanghas]]'' and ''[[gana]]s'', which existed as early as the 6th century B.C. and persisted in some areas until the 4th century. The evidence for this is scattered, however, and no pure historical source exists for that period. In addition, [[Diodorus]]—a Greek historian who wrote two centuries after the time of [[Alexander the Great]]'s invasion of India—mentions, without offering any detail, that independent and democratic states existed in India.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus 2.39&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars note the word ''democracy'' at the time of the 3rd century B.C. and later suffered from degradation and could mean any autonomous state, no matter how oligarchic in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, 1973, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Sainte, 2006, pp. 321–3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mahajanapadas (c. 500 BCE).png|right|250px|thumb|The [[Mahajanapadas]] were the sixteen most powerful and vast kingdoms and republics of the era, there were also a number of smaller kingdoms stretching the length and breadth of [[Ancient India]]. Among the Mahajanapadas and smaller states, the [[Shakya]]s, [[Koliya]]s, [[Malla (India)|Malla]]s, and [[Licchavi (clan)|Licchavi]]s followed republican government.]]
Key characteristics of the ''gana'' seem to include a monarch, usually known by the name [[raja]], and a deliberative assembly. The assembly met regularly. It discussed all major state decisions. At least in some states, attendance was open to all free men. This body also had full financial, administrative, and judicial authority. Other officers, who rarely receive any mention, obeyed the decisions of the assembly. Elected by the ''gana'', the monarch apparently always belonged to a family of the noble class of ''[[Kshatriya]] [[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]]''. The monarch coordinated his activities with the assembly; in some states, he did so with a council of other nobles.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 1997, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Licchavi (clan)|Licchavis]] had a primary governing body of 7,077 rajas, the heads of the most important families. On the other hand, the [[Shakya]]s, [[Koliya]]s, [[Malla (India)|Malla]]s, and [[Licchavi (clan)|Licchavi]]s, during the period around [[Gautama Buddha]], had the assembly open to all men, rich and poor.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 1997, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Early "republics" or [[Gaṇa sangha]],&lt;ref name=Thapar&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5irrXX0apQC&amp;pg=PA147 |title=Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300|last=Thapar|first=Romila|authorlink=Romila Thapar|year=2002|work=Google Books|publisher=University of California|pages=146–150|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Malla (Ancient India)|Mallas]], centered in the city of [[Kusinagara]], and the [[Vajji]] (or Vriji) confederation, centered in the city of [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]], existed as early as the 6th century BCE and persisted in some areas until the 4th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Raychaudhuri Hemchandra (1972), ''Political History of Ancient India'', Calcutta: University of Calcutta, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous clan amongst the ruling confederate clans of the Vajji Mahajanapada were the [[Licchavi (clan)|Licchavi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Republics in ancient India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zcoUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA93|publisher=Brill Archive|pages=93–|id=GGKEY:HYY6LT5CFT0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Magadha kingdom included republican communities such as the community of Rajakumara. Villages had their own assemblies under their local chiefs called Gramakas. Their administrations were divided into executive, judicial, and military functions. 

Scholars differ over how best to describe these governments, and the vague, sporadic quality of the evidence allows for wide disagreements. Some emphasize the central role of the assemblies and thus tout them as democracies; other scholars focus on the upper-class domination of the leadership and possible control of the assembly and see an [[oligarchy]] or an [[aristocracy]].&lt;ref name="Bongard"&gt;Bongard-Levin, 1996, pp. 61–106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharma"&gt;Sharma 1968, pp. 109–22&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the assembly's obvious power, it has not yet been established whether the composition and participation were truly popular. The first main obstacle is the lack of evidence describing the popular power of the assembly. This is reflected in the ''[[Arthashastra]]'', an ancient handbook for monarchs on how to rule efficiently. It contains a chapter on how to deal with the ''sangas'', which includes injunctions on manipulating the noble leaders, yet it does not mention how to influence the mass of the citizens—a surprising omission if democratic bodies, not the aristocratic families, actively controlled the republican governments.&lt;ref&gt;Trautmann T. R., ''Kautilya and the Arthashastra'', Leiden 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue is the persistence of the [[Varna (Hinduism)|four-tiered Varna class system]].&lt;ref name="Bongard"/&gt; The duties and privileges on the members of each particular caste—rigid enough to prohibit someone sharing a meal with those of another order—might have affected the roles members were expected to play in the state, regardless of the formality of the institutions. A central tenet of democracy is the notion of shared decision-making power. The absence of any concrete notion of citizen equality across these caste system boundaries leads many scholars to claim that the true nature of ''ganas'' and ''sanghas'' is not comparable to truly democratic institutions.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;

=== Icelandic Commonwealth ===
The Icelandic Commonwealth was established in AD 930 by refugees from [[Norway]] who had fled the unification of that country under King [[Harald Fairhair]]. The Commonwealth consisted of a number of clans run by chieftains, and the [[Althing]] was a combination of parliament and supreme court where disputes appealed from lower courts were settled, laws were decided, and decisions of national importance were taken. One such example was the [[Christianisation of Iceland]] in 1000, where the Althing decreed, in order to prevent an invasion, that all Icelanders must be baptized, and forbade celebration of pagan rituals. Contrary to most states, the Icelandic Commonwealth had no official leader.

In the early 13th century, the [[Age of the Sturlungs]], the Commonwealth began to suffer from long conflicts between warring clans. This, combined with pressure from the Norwegian king [[Haakon IV of Norway|Haakon IV]] for the Icelanders to rejoin the Norwegian "family", led the Icelandic chieftains to accept Haakon IV as king by the signing of the ''Gamli sáttmáli'' ("[[Old Covenant (Iceland)|Old Covenant]]") in 1262. This effectively brought the Commonwealth to an end. The Althing, however, is still Iceland's parliament, almost 800 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-iceland-free-speech-20110403,0,5332545.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Henry | last=Chu | title=Iceland seeks to become sanctuary for free speech | date=April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mercantile republics ===
[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo 080.jpg|thumb|[[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], ''[[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] offers the wealth of the sea to Venice'', 1748–1750. This painting is an allegory of the power of the Republic of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]].]]

In Europe new republics appeared in the late Middle Ages when a number of small states embraced republican systems of government. These were generally small, but wealthy, trading states, like the [[Italian city-states]] and the [[Hanseatic League]], in which the merchant class had risen to prominence.  Knud Haakonssen has noted that, by the [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]], Europe was divided with those states controlled by a landed elite being monarchies and those controlled by a commercial elite being republics.&lt;ref name=Haakonssen /&gt;

Across Europe a wealthy merchant class developed in the important trading cities. Despite their wealth they had little power in the [[feudalism|feudal system]] dominated by the rural land owners, and across Europe began to advocate for their own privileges and powers. The more centralized states, such as France and England, granted limited city charters.

In the more loosely governed [[Holy Roman Empire]], 51 of the largest towns became [[free imperial city|free imperial cities]]. While still under the dominion of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] most power was held locally and many adopted republican forms of government.&lt;ref name="Finer 1999. pg. 950-955"&gt;Finer, Samuel. ''The History of Government from the Earliest Times'' Oxford University Press, 1999. pp. 950–55.&lt;/ref&gt; The same rights to imperial immediacy were secured by the major trading cities of Switzerland. The towns and villages of alpine [[Switzerland]] had, courtesy of geography, also been largely excluded from central control. Unlike Italy and Germany, much of the rural area was thus not controlled by feudal barons, but by independent farmers who also used communal forms of government. When the [[Habsburgs]] tried to reassert control over the region both rural farmers and town merchants joined the rebellion. The [[Swiss people|Swiss]] were victorious, and the [[Swiss Confederacy]] was proclaimed, and Switzerland has retained a republican form of government to the present.&lt;ref name="William R. Everdell 2000"/&gt;

Italy was the most densely populated area of Europe, and also one with the weakest central government. Many of the towns thus gained considerable independence and adopted commune forms of government. Completely free of feudal control, the Italian city-states expanded, gaining control of the rural hinterland.&lt;ref name="Finer 1999. pg. 950-955"/&gt; The two most powerful were the [[Republic of Venice]] and its rival the [[Republic of Genoa]]. Each were large trading ports, and further expanded by using naval power to control large parts of the Mediterranean. It was in Italy that an ideology advocating for republics first developed. Writers such as [[Bartholomew of Lucca]], [[Brunetto Latini]], [[Marsilius of Padua]], and Leonardo Bruni saw the medieval city-states as heirs to the legacy of Greece and Rome.

Two Russian cities with powerful merchant class—[[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]] and [[Pskov Republic|Pskov]]—also adopted republican forms of government in 12th and 13th centuries, respectively, which ended when the republics were conquered by [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovy]]/[[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]] at the end 15th – beginning of 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Joseph Maria Feldbrugge. ''Law in Medieval Russia'', IDC Publishers, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant form of government for these early republics was control by a limited council of elite [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]. In those areas that held elections, property qualifications or guild membership limited both who could vote and who could run. In many states no direct elections were held and council members were hereditary or appointed by the existing council. This left the great majority of the population without political power, and riots and revolts by the lower classes were common. The late Middle Ages saw more than 200 such risings in the towns of the Holy Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Finer, pp. 955–956.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar revolts occurred in Italy, notably the [[Ciompi Revolt]] in Florence.

==== Mercantile republics outside Europe ====
Following the collapse of the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum]] and establishment of the [[Turkey|Turkish]]  [[Anatolian Beyliks]], the [[Ahiler]] merchant fraternities established a state centered on [[Ankara]] that is sometimes compared to the Italian mercantile republics.

=== Calvinist republics ===
{{see also|European wars of religion}}
While the classical writers had been the primary ideological source for the republics of Italy, in Northern Europe, the [[Protestant Reformation]] would be used as justification for establishing new republics.&lt;ref&gt;Finer, Samuel. ''The History of Government from the Earliest Times.'' Oxford University Press, 1999. p. 1020.&lt;/ref&gt; Most important was [[Calvinist]] theology, which developed in the Swiss Confederacy, one of the largest and most powerful of the medieval republics. [[John Calvin]] did not call for the abolition of monarchy, but he advanced the doctrine that the faithful had the duty to overthrow irreligious monarchs.&lt;ref&gt;"Republicanism." ''Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment'' p. 435&lt;/ref&gt; Advocacy for republics appeared in the writings of the [[Huguenots]] during the [[French Wars of Religion]].&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction." ''Republicanism: a Shared European Heritage.'' By Martin van Gelderen and Quentin Skinner. Cambridge University Press, 2002 p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvinism played an important role in the republican revolts in England and the Netherlands. Like the city-states of Italy and the Hanseatic League, both were important trading centres, with a large merchant class prospering from the trade with the New World. Large parts of the population of both areas also embraced Calvinism. During the [[Dutch Revolt]] (beginning in 1566), the [[Dutch Republic]] emerged from rejection of [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Habsburg]] rule. However, the country did not adopt the republican form of government immediately: in the formal declaration of independence ([[Act of Abjuration]], 1581), the throne of [[Philip II of Spain|king Philip]] was only declared vacant, and the Dutch magistrates asked the [[Francis, Duke of Anjou|Duke of Anjou]], queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth of England]] and prince [[William the Silent|William of Orange]], one after another, to replace Philip. It took until 1588 before the [[The Estates|Estates]] (the ''Staten'', the representative assembly at the time) decided to vest the sovereignty of the country in themselves.

In 1641 the [[English Civil War]] began. Spearheaded by the [[Puritans]] and funded by the merchants of London, the revolt was a success, and [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] was executed. In England [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Algernon Sidney]], and [[John Milton]] became some of the first writers to argue for rejecting monarchy and embracing a republican form of government. The [[English Commonwealth]] was short lived, and the monarchy soon restored. The Dutch Republic continued in name until 1795, but by the mid-18th century the [[stadtholder]] had become a ''de facto'' monarch. Calvinists were also some of the earliest settlers of the British and Dutch colonies of North America.

Along with these initial republican revolts, [[early modern Europe]] also saw a great increase in monarchical power. The era of [[absolute monarchy]] replaced the limited and decentralized monarchies that had existed in most of the Middle Ages. It also saw a reaction against the total control of the monarch as a series of writers created the ideology known as [[liberalism]].

Most of these [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers were far more interested in ideas of [[constitutional monarchy]] than in republics. The [[The Protectorate|Cromwell regime]] had discredited republicanism, and most thinkers felt that republics ended in either [[anarchy]] or [[dictatorship|tyranny]].&lt;ref&gt;"Republicanism." ''Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment'' p. 431&lt;/ref&gt; Thus philosophers like [[Voltaire]] opposed absolutism while at the same time being strongly pro-monarchy.

[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] praised republics, and looked on the city-states of Greece as a model. However, both also felt that a nation-state like France, with 20 million people, would be impossible to govern as a republic. Rousseau admired the [[Corsican Republic|republican experiment in Corsica]] (1755–1769) and described his ideal political structure of small, self-governing [[commune]]s. Montesquieu felt that a city-state should ideally be a republic, but maintained that a limited monarchy was better suited to a large nation.

The [[American Revolution]] began as a rejection only of the authority of the [[British Parliament]] over the colonies, not of the monarchy. The failure of the British monarch to protect the colonies from what they considered the infringement of [[Rights of Englishmen|their rights to representative government]], the monarch's branding of those requesting redress as traitors, and his support for sending combat troops to demonstrate authority resulted in widespread perception of the British monarchy as [[tyranny|tyrannical]].

With the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] the leaders of the revolt firmly rejected the monarchy and embraced republicanism. The leaders of the revolution were well versed in the writings of the French liberal thinkers, and also in history of the classical republics. [[John Adams]] had notably written a book on republics throughout history. In addition, the widely distributed and popularly read-aloud tract ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'', by [[Thomas Paine]],  succinctly and eloquently laid out the case for republican ideals and independence to the larger public. The [[Constitution of the United States]], ratified in 1789, created a relatively strong [[federal republic]] to replace the relatively weak [[confederation]] under the first attempt at a national government with the [[Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]] ratified in 1781. The first ten amendments to the Constitution, called the [[United States Bill of Rights]], guaranteed certain [[natural rights]] fundamental to republican ideals that justified the Revolution.

The [[French Revolution]] was also not republican at its outset. Only after the [[Flight to Varennes]] removed most of the remaining sympathy for the king was a republic declared and [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] sent to the guillotine. The stunning success of France in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] saw republics spread by force of arms across much of Europe as a series of [[French client republic|client republics]] were set up across the continent. The rise of [[Napoleon]] saw the end of the [[French First Republic]] and her [[Sister Republic]]s, each replaced by "[[Popular monarchy|popular monarchies]]". Throughout the Napoleonic period, the victors extinguished many of the oldest republics on the continent, including the [[Republic of Venice]], the [[Republic of Genoa]], and the [[Dutch Republic]]. They were eventually transformed into monarchies or absorbed into neighbouring monarchies.

Outside Europe another group of republics was created as the [[Napoleonic Wars]] allowed the states of Latin America to gain their independence. Liberal ideology had only a limited impact on these new republics. The main impetus was the local European descended [[Creole class|Creole]] population in conflict with the [[Peninsulares]]—governors sent from overseas. The majority of the population in most of Latin America was of either African or [[Amerindian]] descent, and the Creole elite had little interest in giving these groups power and broad-based [[popular sovereignty]]. [[Simón Bolívar]], both the main instigator of the revolts and one of its most important theorists, was sympathetic to liberal ideals but felt that Latin America lacked the social cohesion for such a system to function and advocated autocracy as necessary.

In Mexico this [[autocracy]] briefly took the form of a monarchy in the [[First Mexican Empire]]. Due to the [[Peninsular War]], the Portuguese court was relocated to Brazil in 1808. Brazil gained [[independence]] as a monarchy on September 7, 1822, and the [[Empire of Brazil]] lasted until 1889. In the other states various forms of autocratic republic existed until most were liberalized at the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Latin American Republicanism" New Dictionary of the History of Ideas.

The [[French Second Republic]] was created in 1848, but abolished by [[Napoleon III]] who proclaimed himself Emperor in 1852. The [[French Third Republic]] was established in 1870, when a civil revolutionary committee refused to accept Napoleon III's surrender during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Spain briefly became the [[First Spanish Republic]] in 1873–74, but the monarchy was soon restored. By the start of the 20th century France, Switzerland and San Marino remained the only republics in Europe. This changed when, after the 1908 [[Lisbon Regicide]], the [[5 October 1910 revolution]] established the [[First Portuguese Republic|Portuguese Republic]].

[[File:Chinese republic forever.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A 1920s poster that commemorates the permanent President of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] [[Yuan Shikai]] and the provisional President of the Republic [[Sun Yat-sen]]]]
In East Asia, China had seen considerable [[anti-Qing sentiment]] during the 19th century, and a number of protest movements developed calling for constitutional monarchy. The most important leader of these efforts was [[Sun Yat-sen]], whose [[Three Principles of the People]] combined American, European, and Chinese ideas. Under his leadership the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] was proclaimed on January 1, 1912.

Republicanism expanded significantly in the aftermath of [[World War I]], when several of the largest European empires collapsed: the [[Russian Empire]] (1917), [[German Empire]] (1918), [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] (1918), and [[Ottoman Empire]] (1922) were all replaced by republics. New states gained independence during this turmoil, and many of these, such as [[Irish Republic|Ireland]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], [[Finland]] and [[Czechoslovakia]], chose republican forms of government. Following Greece's defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–22)]], the monarchy was briefly replaced by the [[Second Hellenic Republic]] (1924–35). In 1931, the proclamation of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] (1931–39) resulted in the [[Spanish Civil War]] that would be the prelude of [[World War II]].

Republican ideas were spreading, especially in Asia. The United States began to have considerable influence in East Asia in the later part of the 19th century, with [[Protestant]] missionaries playing a central role. The liberal and republican writers of the west also exerted influence. These combined with native [[Confucian]] inspired political philosophy that had long argued that the populace had the right to reject unjust government that had lost the [[Mandate of Heaven]].

Two short-lived republics were proclaimed in East Asia, the [[Republic of Formosa]] and the [[First Philippine Republic]].

=== Decolonization ===
[[File:Commonwealth republics.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A map of the Commonwealth republics]]

In the years following World War II, most of the remaining European colonies gained their independence, and most became republics. The two largest colonial powers were France and the United Kingdom. Republican France encouraged the establishment of republics in its former colonies. The United Kingdom attempted to follow the model it had for its earlier settler colonies of creating independent [[Commonwealth realm]]s still linked under the same monarchy. While most of the settler colonies and the smaller states of the Caribbean retained this system, it was rejected by the newly independent countries in Africa and Asia, which revised their constitutions and became republics.

Britain followed a different model in the Middle East; it installed local monarchies in several colonies and mandates including [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], [[Oman]], [[Yemen]] and [[Libya]]. In subsequent decades revolutions and [[coup]]s overthrew a number of monarchs and installed republics. Several monarchies remain, and the Middle East is the only part of the world where several large states are ruled by monarchs with almost complete political control.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Lisa. "Absolutism and the Resilience of Monarchy in the Middle East." ''Political Science Quarterly'', Vol. 106, No. 1 (Spring, 1991), pp. 1–15&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socialist republics ===
{{See also|People's Republic|Socialist state}}
In the wake of the First World War, the Russian monarchy fell during the [[Russian Revolution]]. The [[Russian Provisional Government]] was established in its place on the lines of a liberal republic, but this was overthrown by the [[Bolsheviks]] who went on to establish the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]]. This was the first republic established under [[Marxist-Leninist]] ideology. Communism was wholly opposed to monarchy, and became an important element of many republican movements during the 20th century. The Russian Revolution spread into [[Mongolia]], and overthrew its theocratic monarchy in 1924. In the aftermath of the Second World War the communists gradually gained control of [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Albania]], ensuring that the states were reestablished as socialist republics rather than monarchies.

Communism also intermingled with other ideologies. It was embraced by many national liberation movements during [[decolonization]]. In Vietnam, communist republicans pushed aside the [[Nguyễn Dynasty]], and monarchies in neighbouring [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]] were overthrown by communist movements in the 1970s. [[Arab socialism]] contributed to a series of revolts and coups that saw the monarchies of [[Egypt]], Iraq, Libya, and Yemen ousted. In Africa Marxist-Leninism and [[African socialism]] led to the end of monarchy and the proclamation of republics in states such as [[Burundi]] and [[Ethiopia]].

=== Islamic republics ===
{{Main article|Islamic republic}}

Islamic political philosophy has a long history of opposition to absolute monarchy, notably in the work of [[Al-Farabi]]. [[Sharia law]] took precedence over the will of the ruler, and electing rulers by means of the [[Shura]] was an important doctrine. While the early [[caliphate]] maintained the principles of an elected ruler, later states became hereditary or military dictatorships though many maintained some pretense of a consultative shura.

None of these states are typically referred to as republics. The current usage of republic in Muslim countries is borrowed from the western meaning, adopted into the language in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lewis]]. "The Concept of an Islamic Republic" ''Die Welt des Islams'', New Series, Vol. 4, Issue 1 (1955), pp. 1–9&lt;/ref&gt; The 20th century saw republicanism become an important idea in much of the Middle East, as monarchies were removed in many states of the region. Iraq became a secular state. Some nations, such as [[Indonesia]] and [[Azerbaijan]], began as secular. In [[Iran]], the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution]] overthrew the monarchy and created an [[Islamic republic]] based on the ideas of [[Islamic democracy]].

== Head of state ==
=== Structure ===

With no monarch, most modern republics use the title [[president]] for the [[head of state]]. Originally used to refer to the presiding officer of a committee or governing body in Great Britain the usage was also applied to political leaders, including the leaders of some of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] (originally Virginia in 1608); in full, the "President of the Council".&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], ''s. v.''&lt;/ref&gt; The first republic to adopt the title was the [[United States|United States of America]]. Keeping its usage as the head of a committee the [[President of the Continental Congress]] was the leader of the original congress. When the new constitution was written the title of [[President of the United States]] was conferred on the head of the new [[executive branch]].

If the head of state of a republic is also the [[head of government]], this is called a [[presidential system]]. There are a number of forms of presidential government. A full-presidential system has a president with substantial authority and a central political role.

In other states the legislature is dominant and the presidential role is almost purely ceremonial and apolitical, such as in Germany and India. These states are [[parliamentary republic]]s and operate similarly to constitutional monarchies with [[parliamentary system]]s where the power of the monarch is also greatly circumscribed. In parliamentary systems the head of government, most often titled [[prime minister]], exercises the most real political power. [[Semi-presidential system]]s have a president as an active head of state, but also have a head of government with important powers.

The rules for appointing the president and the leader of the government, in some republics permit the appointment of a president and a prime minister who have opposing political convictions: in France, when the members of the ruling [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] and the president come from opposing political factions, this situation is called [[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]].

In some countries, like [[Switzerland]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[San Marino]], the head of state is not a single person but a committee (council) of several persons holding that office. The Roman Republic had two [[consul]]s, elected for a one-year term by the ''[[comitia centuriata]]'', consisting of all adult, freeborn males who could prove citizenship.

=== Elections ===
In [[liberal democracies]] presidents are elected, either directly by the people or indirectly by a parliament or council. Typically in presidential and semi-presidential systems the president is directly elected by the people, or is indirectly elected as done in the United States. In that country the president is officially elected by an [[electoral college]], chosen by the States, all of which do so by direct election of the electors. The indirect election of the president through the electoral college conforms to the concept of republic as one with a system of indirect election. In the opinion of some, direct election confers [[Legitimacy (political science)|legitimacy]] upon the president and gives the office much of its political power.&lt;ref&gt;"Presidential Systems" ''Governments of the World: A Global Guide to Citizens' Rights and Responsibilities.'' Ed. C. Neal Tate. Vol. 4. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2006. pp. 7–11.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this concept of legitimacy differs from that expressed in the United States Constitution which established the legitimacy of the United States president as resulting from the signing of the Constitution by nine states.&lt;ref&gt;Article VII, Constitution of the United States&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that direct election is required for legitimacy also contradicts the spirit of the [[Connecticut Compromise|Great Compromise]], whose actual result was manifest in the clause&lt;ref&gt;Article II, Para 2, Constitution of the United States&lt;/ref&gt; that provides voters in smaller states with more representation in presidential selection than those in large states; for example citizens of Wyoming in 2016 had 3.6 times as much electoral vote representation as citizens of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-petrocelli/its-time-to-end-the-electoral-college_b_12891764.html|title=Voters In Wyoming Have 3.6 Times The Voting Power That I Have. It's Time To End The Electoral College|first=William|last=Petrocelli|date=10 November 2016|website=huffingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In states with a parliamentary system the president is usually elected by the parliament. This indirect election subordinates the president to the parliament, and also gives the president limited legitimacy and turns most presidential powers into [[reserve power]]s that can only be exercised under rare circumstance. There are exceptions where elected presidents have only ceremonial powers, such as in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

=== Ambiguities ===
The distinction between a republic and a monarchy is not always clear. The [[constitutional monarchies]] of the former British Empire and Western Europe today have almost all real political power vested in the elected representatives, with the monarchs only holding either theoretical powers, no powers or rarely used reserve powers. Real legitimacy for political decisions comes from the elected representatives and is derived from the will of the people. While hereditary monarchies remain in place, political power is derived from the people as in a republic. These states are thus sometimes referred to as [[crowned republic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;The novelist and essayist [[H. G. Wells]] regularly used the term crowned republic to describe the United Kingdom, for instance in his work ''A Short History of the World''. [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] in his poem ''[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/t/tennyson/alfred/idylls/chapter13.html Idylls of the King]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Terms such as "liberal republic" are also used to describe all of the modern liberal democracies.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Montfort Dunn|Dunn, John]]. "The Identity of the Bourgeois Liberal Republic." The Invention of the Modern Republic. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also self-proclaimed republics that act similarly to monarchies with absolute power vested in the leader and passed down from father to son. North Korea and Syria are two notable examples where a son has inherited political control. Neither of these states are officially monarchies. There is no constitutional requirement that power be passed down within one family, but it has occurred in practice.

There are also [[elective monarchy|elective monarchies]] where ultimate power is vested in a monarch, but the monarch is chosen by some manner of election. A current example of such a state is [[Malaysia]] where the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] is elected every five years by the [[Conference of Rulers]] composed of the nine hereditary rulers of the [[Malay states]] and the [[Vatican City-State]], where the [[pope]] is selected by cardinal-electors, currently all [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] under a specific age. While rare today, elective monarchs were common in the past. The Holy Roman Empire is an important example, where each new emperor was chosen by a group of electors. Islamic states also rarely employed [[primogeniture]], instead relying on various forms of election to choose a monarch's successor.

The [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] had an elective monarchy, with a wide suffrage of some 500,000 nobles. The system, known as the [[Golden Liberty]], had developed as a method for powerful landowners to control the crown. The proponents of this system looked to classical examples, and the writings of the Italian Renaissance, and called their elective monarchy a ''[[rzeczpospolita]]'', based on ''res publica.''

=== Sub-national republics ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
In general being a republic also implies [[sovereignty]] as for the state to be ruled by the people it cannot be controlled by a foreign power. There are important exceptions to this, for example, republics in the [[Soviet Union]] were member states which had to meet three criteria to be named republics:

# be on the periphery of the Soviet Union so as to be able to take advantage of their theoretical right to secede;
# be economically strong enough to be self-sufficient upon secession; and
# be named after at least one million people of the ethnic group which should make up the majority population of said republic.

It is sometimes argued that the former Soviet Union was also a supra-national republic, based on the claim that the member states were different [[nations]].

[[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was a federal entity composed of six republics (Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia). Each republic had its parliament, government, institute of citizenship, constitution, etc., but certain functions were delegated to the federation (army, monetary matters). Each republic also had a right of self-determination according to the conclusions of the [[second session of the AVNOJ]] and according to the [[Constitution of Yugoslavia|federal constitution]].

States of the United States are required, like the federal government, to be republican in form, with final authority resting with the people. This was required because the states were intended to create and enforce most domestic laws, with the exception of areas delegated to the federal government and prohibited to the states. The founding fathers of the country intended most domestic laws to be handled by the states. Requiring the states to be a republic in form was seen as protecting the citizens' rights and preventing a state from becoming a dictatorship or monarchy, and reflected unwillingness on the part of the original 13 states (all independent republics) to unite with other states that were not republics. Additionally, this requirement ensured that only other republics could join the union.

In the example of the United States, the original 13 British [[colonies]] became [[independent (nation)|independent]] states after the American Revolution, each having a republican form of government. These independent states initially formed a loose confederation called the United States and then later formed the current United States by ratifying the current [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]], creating a [[Political union|union]] of [[sovereign state]]s with the union or [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] government also being a republic. Any state joining the union later was also required to be a republic.

== Other meanings ==
=== Political philosophy ===
{{Main article|Republicanism}}

The term ''republic'' originated from the writers of the Renaissance as a descriptive term for states that were not monarchies. These writers, such as Machiavelli, also wrote important prescriptive works describing how such governments should function. These ideas of how a government and society should be structured is the basis for an ideology known as [[classical republicanism]] or [[civic humanism]]. This ideology is based on the Roman Republic and the city states of Ancient Greece and focuses on ideals such as [[civic virtue]], [[rule of law]] and mixed government.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/republicanism/ Republicanism]" ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.'' Jun 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

This understanding of a republic as a distinct form of government from a [[liberal democracy]] is one of the main theses of the Cambridge School of historical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, John P. "Machiavelli against Republicanism: On the Cambridge School's 'Guicciardinian Moments'" ''Political Theory'', Vol. 31, No. 5 (Oct., 2003), pp. 615–43&lt;/ref&gt; This grew out of the work of [[J. G. A. Pocock]] who in 1975 argued that a series of scholars had expressed a consistent set of republican ideals. These writers included Machiavelli, Milton, Montesquieu and the founders of the United States of America.

Pocock argued that this was an ideology with a history and principles distinct from liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Pocock, J. G. A ''The Machiavellian Moment: Florentine Political Thought and the Atlantic Republican Tradition'' Princeton: 1975, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas were embraced by a number of different writers, including [[Quentin Skinner]], [[Philip Pettit]]&lt;ref&gt;Philip Pettit, ''Republicanism: A Theory of Freedom and Government'', NY: Oxford U.P., 1997, {{ISBN|0-19-829083-7}}; Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cass Sunstein]]. These subsequent writers have further explored the history of the idea, and also outlined how a modern republic should function.

=== United States ===
{{Main article|Republicanism in the United States}}

A distinct set of definitions for the word republic evolved in the [[United States]]. In common parlance, a republic is a state that does not practice [[direct democracy]] but rather has a government [[Representative democracy|indirectly controlled by the people]]. This understanding of the term was originally developed by James Madison, and notably employed in [[Federalist No. 10|Federalist Paper No. 10]]. This meaning was widely adopted early in the history of the United States, including in [[Noah Webster]]'s dictionary of 1828. It was a novel meaning to the term; representative democracy was not an idea mentioned by Machiavelli and did not exist in the classical republics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Everdell|2000}} p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that contemporaries of Madison considered the meaning of the word to reflect the definition found elsewhere, as is the case with a quotation of [[Benjamin Franklin]] taken from the notes of [[James McHenry]] where the question is put forth, "a Republic or a Monarchy?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/73/1593.html|title=1593. Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790). Respectfully Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations. 1989|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term republic does not appear in the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]], but does appear in Article IV of the Constitution which "guarantee[s] to every State in this Union a Republican form of Government." What exactly the writers of the constitution felt this should mean is uncertain. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], in ''[[Luther v. Borden]]'' (1849), declared that the definition of ''republic'' was a "[[political question]]" in which it would not intervene. In two later cases, it did establish a basic definition. In ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1875), the court ruled that the "equal rights of citizens" were inherent to the idea of a republic.

However, the term republic is not synonymous with the republican form. The republican form is defined as one in which the powers of sovereignty are vested in the people and are exercised by the people, either directly, or through representatives chosen by the people, to whom those powers are specially delegated.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Duncan'', 139 U.S. 449, 11 S.Ct. 573, 35 L.Ed. 219; ''Minor v. Happersett'', 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 162, 22 L.Ed. 627.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GOVERNMENT (Republican Form of Government) – One in which the powers of sovereignty are vested in the people and are exercised by the people ... directly ... Black's Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, p. 695&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond these basic definitions the word republic has a number of other connotations. W. Paul Adams observes that republic is most often used in the United States as a synonym for state or government, but with more positive connotations than either of those terms.&lt;ref&gt;W. Paul Adams "Republicanism in Political Rhetoric Before 1776." ''Political Science Quarterly'', Vol. 85, No. 3 (Sep., 1970), pp. 397–421&lt;/ref&gt;  Republicanism is often referred to as the founding ideology of the United States. Traditionally scholars believed this American republicanism was a derivation of the classical liberal ideologies of [[John Locke]] and others developed in Europe.

A political philosophy of republicanism that formed during the Renaissance period and initiated by Machiavelli was thought to have had little impact on the founders of the United States. In the 1960s and 1970s, a revisionist school{{Citation needed|reason=This claim seems to be an opinion or possibly a biased position and needs a verifiable source or verifiable academic position; It also does not mention if it is an actual school or a school of thought which leads to more confusion as to its merits|date=May 2012}} led by the likes of [[Bernard Bailyn]] began to argue that republicanism was just as or even more important than liberalism in the creation of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, Bernard. ''The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution''. Cambridge: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; This issue is still much disputed and scholars like [[Isaac Kramnick]] completely reject this view.&lt;ref&gt;Kramnick, Isaac. ''Republicanism and Bourgeois Radicalism: Political Ideology in Late Eighteenth-Century England and America.'' Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Mueller joined the U.S. Marine Corps.

== United States Marine Corps service ==

After returning from Vietnam, Mueller was briefly stationed at [[Henderson Hall (Arlington, Virginia)|Henderson Hall]], before leaving active-duty service in August 1970.&lt;ref name="wapomil"/&gt;

== Legal career ==
After receiving his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree in 1973 from the [[University of Virginia School of Law]], Mueller worked as a litigator at the firm [[Pillsbury, Madison and Sutro]] in San Francisco until 1976. He then served for 12 years in [[United States Attorney]] offices.

After serving as a partner at the Boston law firm of [[Hill and Barlow]], Mueller returned to government service. In 1989, he served in the [[United States Department of Justice]] as an assistant to Attorney General [[Dick Thornburgh]] and as acting Deputy Attorney General.

'''Secure messaging''' is a server-based{{undue weight inline|reason=There are also serverless approaches to secure messaging.|date=July 2016}} approach to protect sensitive data when sent beyond the corporate{{undue weight inline|reason=Not all secure messaging is business related.|date=July 2016}} borders and provides compliance with industry regulations such as [[HIPAA]], [[GLBA]] and [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act|SOX]]. Advantages over classical secure e-mail are that confidential and authenticated exchanges can be started immediately by any internet user worldwide since there is no requirement to install any software nor to obtain or to distribute [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic keys]] beforehand. Secure messages provide non-repudiation as the recipients (similar to [[online banking]]) are personally identified and transactions are logged by the secure email platform.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== Functionality ==
Secure messaging works as an online messaging service. Users enroll to a secure messaging platform. The user logs into his account by typing in his username and password (or strong authentication) similar to a web-based email account. Out of a message center messages can be sent over a [[Transport Layer Security|secure SSL-connection]] or via other equally protecting methods to any recipient. If the recipient is contacted for the first time a message unlock code [[#MUC (message unlock code)|(see below MUC)]] is needed to authenticate the recipient. Alternatively, Secure Messaging can be used out of any standard email program without installing software.

== Secure delivery ==
Secure Messaging possesses different types of delivery: secured web interface, [[S/MIME]] or [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] encrypted communication or [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] secured connections to email domains or individual email clients. One single secure message can be sent to different recipients with different types of secure delivery the sender does not have to worry about.

== Trust management ==
Secure Messaging relies on the method of the dynamic personal [[web of trust]]. This method synthesizes the authentication approach of web of trust, known from [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]], with the advantages of hierarchical structures, known from centralized [[Public key infrastructure|PKI systems]]. Those combined with certificates provide high quality of electronic identities. This approach focuses on the user and allows for immediate and personal bootstrapping of trust, respectively revocation.

== Physical security ==
In traditional client-server email, message data is downloaded to a local hard drive, and is vulnerable if the computer is lost, stolen, or physically accessed by an unauthorized person. Secure Messages are stored on a network or internet server which are typically more physically secure, and are encrypted when data is inbound or outbound. However, an abundance of data still makes the server an attractive target for remote attacks. Of course, the intentions of the server operator may also come into question.{{Citation need|date=March 2018}}

== Application ==
Secure Messaging is used in many business areas with company-wide and sensitive data exchanges. Financial institutions, insurance companies, public services, health organizations and service providers rely on the protection from Secure Messaging. Secure Messaging can be easily integrated into the corporate email infrastructures.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In the government context, secure messaging can offer electronic [[registered mail]] functions. For this to be binding, some countries, such as Switzerland,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isb.admin.ch/themen/sicherheit/00530/01200/index.html?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; require it to be accredited as a secure platform.

== Technical requirements ==
There is no software required for using Secure Messaging. Users only need a valid email address and a working internet connection with an up-to-date [[web browser]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18182">'''Sex Panic!''', sometimes rendered '''SexPanic!''' or '''Sex Panic''', was a sexual activism group founded in New York City in 1997.&lt;ref name="Kurth"&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |author=Kurth |title=The Trouble With Normal |work=[[Salon.com]] |url=http://www.salon.com/books/feature/1999/12/08/warner/ |date=8 December 1999 |accessdate=16 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group characterized itself as a "pro-queer, pro-feminist, anti-racist [[direct action]] group" campaigning for [[sexual freedom]] in the age of [[AIDS]].&lt;ref name="HGLR"/&gt; It was founded to oppose both mainstream political measures to control sex, and elements within the gay community who advocated [[same-sex marriage]] and the restriction of public sexual culture as solutions to the [[HIV]] crisis.&lt;ref name="Melancholia"/&gt; The group has been depicted as a faction in a gay "[[culture war]]" of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.&lt;ref name="Rofes"/&gt;

Sex Panic!'s actions and attitudes were criticized as immature&lt;ref name="Kramer"/&gt; and even fanatical by its opponents,&lt;ref name="Horowitz"/&gt; but other commentators called the group a vital component of [[grassroots]] gay activism&lt;ref name="Beyond"/&gt; that resisted gay marginalization and countered forced conformity to [[social norms]].&lt;ref name="Rimmerman"/&gt;

==Origins==
According to founder member Christopher Murray, in a 1997 letter to the ''New York Times'', Sex Panic! was formed by six HIV-positive gay men opposed to a "gay [[neo-conservative]] movement" and to the closure of gay venues around New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Murray |title=In debate, gay men aim to find middle path |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E3D9153FF935A25751C1A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon= |work=New York Times |date=16 December 1997 |accessdate=17 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The closure of gay venues stemmed from the urban [[rezoning]] policies of New York City mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]]'s administration.&lt;ref name="Rimmerman"&gt;{{cite book |first=Craig A. |last=Rimmerman |title= From Identity to Politics |publisher=Temple University Press |year=2002 |page=116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0BexugIsxsC |accessdate=16 February 2009 |isbn=978-1-56639-905-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Giuliani had passed laws that made it harder for sex-related businesses to operate in central city areas, forcing many to close or relocate to the waterfront. These policies, Sex Panic! founder [[Michael Warner]] wrote, served to stigmatize sex and sexuality in ways that had negative consequences for public health efforts to combat HIV and AIDS.&lt;ref name="Warner"/&gt; Reducing the availability and visibility of venues for sex did not, Warner, argued, make people safer; on the contrary it reduced the number of public sites where safer sex messages could be broadcast and gay men encouraged to consider their sexual health honestly, critically, and without the confusion and misinformation fostered by a culture of shame.&lt;ref name="trouble"&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Warner |title=The Trouble with Normal |isbn= |year=1999 |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|The Free Press]] |page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as mainstream politics, the group opposed the anti-[[promiscuity]] arguments of prominent gay rights campaigners [[Larry Kramer]], [[Andrew Sullivan]], [[Michelangelo Signorile]], and [[Gabriel Rotello]].&lt;ref name="Rofes"&gt;{{cite book |first=Eric |last=Rofes |title=Dry Bones Breathe |publisher=Haworth Press |year=1998 |isbn=0-7890-0470-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FUka9tomMLkC |page=323 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan's 1995 book ''[[Virtually Normal: An Argument About Homosexuality]]'' had called for the abandonment of radical gay [[identity politics]] in favour of campaigning for the [[same-sex marriage|right to marry]], which he presented as the highest social value attainable and the token of a maturity and moral responsibility the gay movement had lacked.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Sullivan |title=Virtually Normal: an argument about homosexuality |year=1995 |publisher=Picador |isbn=0-330-34453-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan's arguments for marriage included the assertion that it was a good defense against the spread of HIV and AIDS; Rotello argued similarly that these diseases could not be eradicated so long as a 'core group' of gay men participated in risky sex. Marriage, Rotello suggested in his 1997 book ''[[Sexual Ecology]]'', was a powerful incentive to behaviour less likely to spread disease, while exclusion from the benefits it offered created an equally powerful stigma.&lt;ref name="Rimmerman"/&gt; These views, the founders of Sex Panic! argued, supported a mainstream political culture that demonized gay people and portrayed gay sex in general, rather than unsafe sex in particular, as a vector of disease.&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;

===Name===
The organization's name references a concept used by historians to describe repressive measures against sex in the name of the public good; 'sex panics' in this sense have been documented since at least the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Rimmerman"/&gt; A [[Gay City News]] journalist, evaluating the group's role in the history of sex scandals through the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, described the choice of name as an act of self-empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Paul |last=Schindler |title=Sex Panic |work=Gay City News |url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/TF_in_news/07_0909/stories/15_Sex_Panic.pdf |accessdate=12 March 2009 |date=9 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Membership===
Founder and early members of Sex Panic! included historian [[Allan Bérubé]],&lt;ref name="Beyond"&gt;{{cite book |first=Tim |last=Dean |title=Beyond Sexuality |publisher=[[Chicago University Press]] |year=2000 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=68hI6_16VGEC |isbn=0-226-13934-4 |page=154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Murray,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Christopher |last=Murray |title=In Debate, Gay Men Aim to Find Middle Path: letter to the editor |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E3D9153FF935A25751C1A961958260 |work=New York Times |date=16 December 1997 |accessdate=27 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; art historian [[Douglas Crimp]],&lt;ref name="Melancholia"/&gt; [[Columbia Law School]] professor Kendall Thomas,&lt;ref name="Horowitz"/&gt; [[Rutgers University]] English professor [[Michael Warner]], research activist Greg Gonsalves, and scientific artist Dennis Davidson.&lt;ref name="Rimmerman"/&gt; Feminist authors Eva Pendleton,&lt;ref name="Beyond"/&gt; Jane Goldschmidt of the [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]],&lt;ref name="Beyond"/&gt; and literary critic Ann Pellegrini&lt;ref name="Beyond"/&gt; were also early members.

==Aims and activities==
Members Eva Pendleton and Jane Goldschmidt articulated Sex Panic!'s goals in 1998:&lt;ref name="HGLR"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eva |last=Pendleton |author2=Jane Goldschmidt  |title=Sex Panic! - Make the Connections |journal=Harvard Gay and Lesbian Review |volume=5 |issue=3 |year=1998 |pages=30–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Our multi-issue agenda aims to defend public sexual culture and safer sex in New York City from police crackdowns, public stigma, and morality crusades. We are committed to HIV prevention through safer sex, sexual self-determination for all people, and democratic urban space.|Pendleton and Goldschmidt|''[[The Gay &amp; Lesbian Review Worldwide|Harvard Gay and Lesbian Review]]''}}

The group argued that the best response to sexual health crisis was to promote [[safer sex]], and argued that approaches that contradicted the '[[condom]] code' - the advocacy of [[barrier methods]] as the only sure protection - actually undermined efforts to curb the crisis by encouraging carelessness and hypocrisy.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul A. |last=Robinson |title=Queer Wars |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-226-72200-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TGjZO-uvlSoC |page=141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This opposed the group to the arguments of Rotello, Signorile, and others, who said that the spread of the disease was best contained by a "new maturity" of marriage and monogamy, sex with only one partner, and the deliberate use of shame to discourage participation in potentially risky sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Aaron |last=Betsky |title=Post Ex Sub Dis: Urban Fragmentations and Constructions |publisher=Ghent Urban Studies Team |year=2002 |page=85 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XbrjHuB0lrkC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=%22gabriel+rotello%22+shame |isbn=978-90-6450-478-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an approach, Sex Panic! argued, was either naive or deliberately disingenuous.&lt;ref name="Warner"&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael Warner | title=The Trouble with Normal |chapter=The Politics of Shame and HIV Prevention | type= hardback | publisher=The Free Press | year=1999 | isbn=0-684-86529-7  | pages=227 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than demonizing sex with multiple partners, Sex Panic! stressed a need to counteract the effects of shame. They argued that it was absurd and repressive to insist that everyone adopt what Warner called a "Fifties gay life" of monogamy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Edward |last=Hellmore |title=America rallies to a teenage gay icon |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/apr/30/gayrights.theobserver |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=30 April 2000 |accessdate=16 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  to pretend that sex in private was somehow necessarily safer than sex in public, and outright dangerous to create a situation that bred ignorance about safer sex methods, despair over the possibilities for protecting oneself, and a resulting increase in infection rates.&lt;ref name="Warner"/&gt; It was not gay sex or promiscuous sex, founder member Thomas pointed out, that spread HIV, but unsafe sex.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt;

Some of the group's tactics were deliberately eye-catching. The [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]] for one 1997 event was headlined "DANGER! ASSAULT! TURDZ!",&lt;ref name="flyer"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sex Panic meeting leaflet, New York, June 1997 |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/sexpanic1.html |work=People with a History: An Online Guide to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans* History  |publisher=Internet History Sourcebooks Project, [[Fordham University]]|location=New York |accessdate=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter a reference to Signorile, Rotello, Kramer, and Sullivan.&lt;ref name="Horowitz"/&gt; Other activities included demonstrating alongside [[ACT-UP]] against the [[GMHC]]'s plans to identify [[seropositive]] patients by name in public HIV status reporting, rather than the anonymized reporting the group favoured.&lt;ref name="Rimmerman"/&gt;

Other measures were more conventional. In June 1997 the group conducted [[teach-in]]s at New York's Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center.&lt;ref name="flyer"/&gt; The group also held a November 1997 summit in [[San Diego, California]], where a series of lectures and workshops discussed what the group called an "emerging culture war" within the gay community and sought to forge alliances between gay men and other marginalized groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.managingdesire.org/sexpanic/sexpanicpressrelease.html |title=National Sex Panic Summit |accessdate=17 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the conference, founder Eric Rofes urged attendees to start grass-roots movements of their own to combat the repression of sexual minorities. The outspoken methods of Sex Panic!, he argued, were indispensable, since the movement they fought worked by means of marginalization, silencing, and oppression.  To be 'neutral' in the face of public discourses that sought to shame and marginalize gay communities, Rofes argued, was to be complicit in that shaming and marginalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Eric |last=Rofes |url=http://www.managingdesire.org/sexpanic/rofessexpanic.html |title=The Emerging Sex Panic Targeting Gay Men: Speech given at the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force's Creating Change Conference in San Diego, November 16, 1997 |publisher=Managing Desire |accessdate=12 March 2009 |quote=When the panic is over and attention has shifted to other issues, when we all shake our heads and say "How did we ever let it get to that stage?," these people are complicit in the destruction. There is no neutral here.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Larry Kramer, an overt target of the group's campaigns, published an [[op-ed|editorial]] piece in the ''New York Times'' criticizing the group's tactics and goals.&lt;ref name="Kramer"&gt;{{cite news |first=Larry |last=Kramer |title=Gay culture, Redefined |work=[[New York Times]]|date=12 December 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex Panic!, Kramer said, was "on the way to convincing much of America that all gay men are back to pre-AIDS self-destructive behavior that will wind up costing the taxpayer a lot of extra money."&lt;ref name="Kramer"/&gt;

Other commentators accused Sex Panic! of irresponsibility in the face of the HIV epidemic. David Dalton, in the [[San Francisco Examiner]], said the group was telling young men that "a sex act... is worth more than your life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=David |last=Dalton |title=Gay group-think promotes murderous irresponsibility |work=[[San Francisco Examiner]] |url=http://www.aegis.com/news/sfe/1998/se980104.html |date=12 January 1998 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218042531/http://www.aegis.com/news/sfe/1998/se980104.html |archivedate=18 February 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Salon'', [[David Horowitz]] charged Sex Panic! with "intellectual fascism and sexual fanaticism"&lt;ref name="Horowitz"&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Horowitz |title=Right on! The boys in the bath houses |url=http://www.salon.com/col/horo/1997/11/03horo.html |work=[[Salon.com]] |date=3 November 1997 |accessdate=17 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; over their defence of sex clubs, which he characterized as the "death camps of the current contagion." The group's insistence that a gay public sexual culture continue in the face of the epidemic was, in Horowitz's view, "homicidal", and its membership composed of "sexual extremists" cloistered in complicit universities.&lt;ref name="Horowitz"/&gt; Sex Panic! member Douglas Crimp rebutted the charges that this was a mere intellectual exercise. Mainstream venues where such debate took place, he argued, were dominated by the group's opponents and had failed to engage with queer theory, so necessarily saw the group's members as fringe extremists. He argued too that the very life-and-death nature of the AIDS crisis made the group's purpose political, rather than academic, rejecting the claim that the group's insistence on the complexity of the issues it addressed was "dangerous relativism".&lt;ref name="Melancholia"&gt;{{cite book |first=Douglas |last=Crimp |title=Melancholia and Moralism |publisher=MIT |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FFwOGTzpIA0C |isbn=0-262-53264-6 |page=291 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others were sympathetic to parts of Sex Panic!'s manifesto but opposed to certain particulars. David Salyer in ''Survival News'', a journal of the [[AIDS Survival Project]], applauded the group's demands for an end to discrimination and greater promotion of safer sex messages, but objected to the emphasis the group placed on public sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Salyer |title=The Panic Over ''Sex Panic!'' |url=http://www.thebody.com/content/art32486.html |work=Survival News |date=August 1998 |publisher=AIDS Survival Project |accessdate=17 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Activist [[John-Manuel Andriote]] also criticized Sex Panic!'s assertion that public, visible, anonymous sex was necessarily a cornerstone of gay experience. Michael Warner had told the ''New York Times'' that "'It is an absurd fantasy to expect gay men to live without a sexual culture when we have almost nothing else that brings us together".&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt; Andriote responded that the AIDS crisis itself had been an alternative community-forming experience for gays and lesbians, who cooperated to support one another and campaign for awareness. Through the crisis, Andriote said, gay men had acquired a broader common experience than "a priapic brotherhood of sexual rebellion", offering an alternative grounds for a group politics of identity.&lt;ref name="Andriote"&gt;{{cite book |first=John-Manuel |last=Andriote |title=Victory Deferred: How AIDS Changed Gay Life in America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0BexugIsxsC |pages=413–414 |year=1999 |isbn=978-1-56639-905-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex Panic! members accused their opponents of mischaracterizing their positions. Founder member Kendall Thomas objected to a ''New York Times'' piece claiming the group saw "promiscuous sex" as the "essence of gay liberation"; the newspaper printed an amendment, stating Thomas's view to be that "any attempt to fight AIDS by demonizinging &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''[[sic]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; the culture of sexual freedom is doomed".&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite news |first=Sheryl Gay |last=Stolberg |title=Identity crisis: Gay culture weighs sense and sexuality |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E1DA133BF930A15752C1A961958260&amp;sec=health&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 |work=New York Times |date=23 November 1997 |accessdate=17 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Dean called the group's criticism of Rotello and Signorile "utterly confused and defensive", but noted its significance in re-energizing AIDS debates and reviving the political argument over gay assimilation.&lt;ref name="Beyond"/&gt; Craig Rimmerman similarly praised the group's "invaluable contribution" to sustaining gay and lesbian grassroots activism and fighting "normalizing tendencies" in public discourse about sexual health.&lt;ref name="Rimmerman"/&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Shalom aleikhem''''' &lt;!-- also cover the pronunciation of any variants where they appear in the article --&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|ə|ˌ|l|ɒ|m|_|ə|ˈ|l|eɪ|x|ə|m|,_|ˌ|ʃ|oʊ|l|ə|m|-}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Merriam-Webster|shalom aleichem|accessdate=May 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/amp/english/shalom-aleichem|title=shalom aleichem|work=Collins Dictionary|accessdate=May 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-he-n|שָׁלוֹם עֲלֵיכֶם}} ''shālôm ʻalêḵem''){{needs IPA|Hebrew}} is a [[spoken greeting]] in [[Hebrew]], meaning "[[peace be upon you (disambiguation)|peace be upon you]]." The appropriate response is ''aleikhem shalom'' ("unto you peace") ({{lang-he-n|עֲלֵיכֶם שָׁלוֹם}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com|shalom aleichem |publisher=|accessdate=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Jewish Hello |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1582771/jewish/The-Jewish-Hello.htm |publisher=[[Chabad.org]] |author=Dovid Zaklikowski |access-date=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of greeting is traditional among [[Jews]] throughout the world. It occurs six times in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]. The greeting is more common amongst [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. Only the plural form "{{Hebrew|עֲלֵיכֶם}}" is used even when addressing one person. A religious explanation for this is that one greets both the body and the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], but Hebrew does occasionally use the plural as a sign of respect (e.g. a name of God is Elohim {{Hebrew|אלוהים}}, literally gods).

==Other religions==
Many religions share cognates to this greeting.

The related [[Arabic]] variation ''[[As-salamu alaikum|{{transl|ar|DIN|as-salāmuʿalaikum}}]]'', ("peace be upon you") is used by Arabs of different religions as a greeting and by [[Muslims]] of many language and ethnic backgrounds. The appropriate response is Wa alaikum salaam ("unto you peace"). (In [[Arabic]] {{lang|ar|السلام عليكم}})  As-salāmu alaykum and its variants are used by Muslims outside of the Arab world in [[Turkey]], [[Indonesia]], [[Central Asia]], [[Iran]], [[Sahel]] Africa, [[East Africa]], and many other places.
[[Aramaic]] and [[classical Syriac]] use {{transl|syc|Shlomo 'ahlaykhu|italic=yes}} which means ''peace for you.''

Within the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Churches, ''Peace be with you'' (in [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|"Εἰρήνη πᾶσι"}}, in [[Latin]]: {{lang|la|"Pax vobiscum"}}) is the initial [[liturgy|liturgical]] greeting by a [[bishop]] or [[priest]] during divine services. In at [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] catholic priests who are not bishops say "[[Dominus vobiscum|The Lord be with you]]." The response is "And with your spirit." A somewhat similar greeting used within the Mass by bishops and priests is "The peace of the Lord be with you always." In Orthodox Church the greeting is always the same: ''Peace be with you''.

Similarly, "Peace be with you" is used within [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] liturgies of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] and other [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] churches, with the response being "And also with you." The same is true of some Presbyterian and Reformed churches, such as the Presbyterian Church.

'''Social capital''' broadly refers to those factors of effectively functioning [[social group|social groups]] that include such things as interpersonal relationships, a shared sense of [[Identity (social science)|identity]], a shared understanding, shared [[Social norm|norms]], shared [[Value (ethics)|values]], [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], [[cooperation]], and [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]]. However, the many views of this complex subject make a single definition difficult.

The term generally refers to (a) resources, and the value of these resources, both tangible (public spaces, private property) and intangible ("actors", "human capital", people), (b) the relationships among these resources, and (c) the impact that these relationships have on the resources involved in each relationship, and on larger groups. It is generally seen as a form of capital that produces public goods for a common good.

Social capital has been used to explain the improved performance of diverse groups, the growth of entrepreneurial firms, superior managerial performance, enhanced supply chain relations, the value derived from strategic alliances, and the evolution of communities.

During the 1990s and 2000s, the concept has become increasingly popular in a wide range of social science disciplines and also in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adler | first1 = S.

== Background ==
The term ''social capital'' was in intermittent use from about 1890, before becoming widely used in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=social+capital&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=0&amp;smoothing=0 |title=Google Ngram Viewer |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 19th century, [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] had observations about American life that seemed to outline and define social capital. He observed that Americans were prone to meeting at as many gatherings as possible to discuss all possible issues of state, economics, or the world that could be witnessed.  The high levels of transparency caused greater participation from the people and thus allowed for democracy to work better. The French writer highlighted also that the level of social participation (social capital) in American society was directly linked to the equality of conditions (Ferragina, 2010; 2012; 2013).

[[L. J. Hanifan]]'s 1916 article regarding local support for rural schools is one of the first occurrences of the term ''social capital'' in reference to social cohesion and personal investment in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Hanifan, L. J. (1916) "The rural school community center", ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'' 67:  130-138. Also see Hanifan, L. J. (1920)''The Community Center'', Boston:  Silver Burdett.&lt;/ref&gt;  In defining the concept, Hanifan contrasts social capital with material goods by defining it as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not refer to real estate, or to personal property or to cold cash, but rather to that in life which tends to make these tangible substances count for most in the daily lives of people, namely, goodwill, fellowship, mutual sympathy and social intercourse among a group of individuals and families who make up a social unit… If he may come into contact with his neighbour, and they with other neighbours, there will be an accumulation of social capital, which may immediately satisfy his social needs and which may bear a social potentiality sufficient to the substantial improvement of living conditions in the whole community. The community as a whole will benefit by the cooperation of all its parts, while the individual will find in his associations the advantages of the help, the sympathy, and the fellowship of his neighbours (pp. 130-131).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[John Dewey]] used the term in his monograph entitled "School and Society" in 1900, but he offered no definition of it.

[[Jane Jacobs]] used the term early in the 1960s. Although she did not explicitly define the term ''social capital'', her usage referred to the value of networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jacobs |first=Jane |year=1961 |title=The Death and Life of Great American Cities |publisher=Random House |page=138 |quote="If self-government in the place is to work, underlying any float of population must be a continuity of people who have forged neighborhood networks. These networks are a city's irreplaceable social capital. Whenever the capital is lost, from whatever cause, the income from it disappears, never to return until and unless new capital is slowly and chancily accumulated."}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Political scientist Robert Salisbury advanced the term as a critical component of interest group formation in his 1969 article "An Exchange Theory of Interest Groups" in the ''Midwest Journal of Political Science''.  Sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] used the term in 1972 in his ''Outline of a Theory of Practice'',&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 1972"&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. (1972) ''Outline of a Theory of Practice''&lt;/ref&gt; and clarified the term some years later in contrast to [[cultural capital|cultural]], [[economic capital|economic]], and [[symbolic capital]].  Sociologists [[James Samuel Coleman|James Coleman]], and [[Barry Wellman]] &amp; Scot Wortley adopted [[Glenn Loury]]'s 1977 definition in developing and popularising the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coleman|first=James|date=1988|title=Social Capital in the Creation of Human Capital|jstor=2780243|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=94|pages=95–120|doi=10.1086/228943|citeseerx=10.1.1.208.1462}}. Wellman, Barry and Scot Wortley. (1990). "Different Strokes from Different Folks: Community Ties and Social Support". ''American Journal of Sociology'' 96: 558-88. Loury, Glenn (1977). A Dynamic Theory of Racial Income Differences.  Chapter 8 of ''Women, Minorities, and Employment Discrimination'', Ed. P.A. Wallace and A. Le Mund.  Lexington, Mass.: Lexington Books.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s the concept gained popularity, serving as the focus of a [[World Bank]] research programme and the subject of several mainstream books, including [[Robert Putnam]]'s ''[[Bowling Alone]]''&lt;ref name="Putnam 2000"&gt;Putnam, Robert. (2000), "Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community" (Simon and Schuster).&lt;/ref&gt; and Putnam and [[Lewis Feldstein]]'s  ''[[Better Together (book)|Better Together]]''.

The concept that underlies social capital has a much longer history; thinkers exploring the relation between associational life and democracy were using similar concepts regularly by the 19th century, drawing on the work of earlier writers such as [[James Madison]] (''[[The Federalist Papers]]'') and Alexis de Tocqueville (''[[Democracy in America]]'') to integrate concepts of social cohesion and connectedness into the pluralist tradition in American political science. John Dewey may have made the first direct mainstream use of ''social capital'' in ''The School and Society'' in 1899, though he did not offer a definition.

The power of ''community governance'' has been stressed by many philosophers from antiquity to the 18th century, from [[Aristotle]] to [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Edmund Burke]] (Bowles and Gintis, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bowles | first1 = S. | last2 = Gintis | first2 = S. | year = 2002 | title = Social Capital and Community Governance | url = | journal = The Economic Journal | volume = 112 | issue = 483| pages = 419–436 | doi=10.1111/1468-0297.00077| citeseerx = 10.1.1.508.4110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This vision was strongly criticised at the end of the 18th century, with the development of the idea of ''Homo Economicus'' and subsequently with ''[[rational choice theory]]''. Such a set of theories became dominant in the last centuries, but many thinkers questioned the complicated relationship between ''modern society'' and the importance of ''old institutions'', in particular family and traditional communities (Ferragina, 2010:75).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/385876|title=Social Capital and Equality: Tocqueville's Legacy: Rethinking social capital in relation with income inequalities|first=Emanuele|last=Ferragina|date=8 July 2010|journal=The Tocqueville Review/La Revue Tocqueville|volume=31|issue=1|pages=73–98|via=Project MUSE|doi=10.1353/toc.0.0030}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate of community versus modernization of society and individualism has been the most discussed topic among the founders of sociology ([[Ferdinand Tönnies|Tönnies]], 1887;&lt;ref&gt;Tonnies, F. (1955) [1887]. ''Community and Association''. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], 1893;&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. (1893) "De la Division du Travail". Les Classiques de Science Sociale.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]], 1905;&lt;ref&gt;Simmel, G. (1969) [1905] "The Metropolis and Mental Life", in Richard Sennet (eds) ''Classic Essays on the Culture of Cities''. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Weber|Weber]], 1946).&lt;ref&gt;Weber, M. (1946) "The Protestant Sects and the Spirit of Capitalism". In Hans H. Gert and Mills C. Wright (eds) ''From Max Weber''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; They were convinced that industrialisation and urbanization were transforming social relationships in an irreversible way. They observed a breakdown of traditional bonds and the progressive development of [[anomie]] and [[social alienation|alienation]] in society (Wilmott, 1986).&lt;ref&gt;Wilmott, P. (1986) ''Social Networks, Informal Care and Public Policy''. London: Policy Studies Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Tönnies' and Weber's works, reflection on social links in modern society continued with interesting contributions in the 1950s and in the 1960s, in particular ''[[Social movement#Mass society theory|mass society theory]]'' (Bell, 1962;&lt;ref&gt;Bell, D. (1962) "America as a Mass Society", in Daniel Bell (eds) ''The End of Ideology''. New York: Collier Books&lt;/ref&gt; Nisbet, 1969;&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, R. A. ''The Quest for Community''. New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Stein, 1960;&lt;ref&gt;Stein, M. R. (1960) ''The Eclipse of Community: an Interpretation of American Studies''. Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Whyte, 1956).&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, W. (1956) ''[[The Organization Man]]''. New York: Simon and Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; They proposed themes similar to those of the founders, with a more pessimistic emphasis on the development of society (Ferragina, 2010: 76). In the words of Stein (1960:1): "The price for maintaining a society that encourages cultural differentiation and experimentation is unquestionably the acceptance of a certain amount of disorganization on both the individual and social level." All these reflections contributed remarkably to the development of the social capital concept in the following decades.

The appearance of the modern social capital conceptualization is a new way to look at this debate, keeping together the importance of community to build generalized trust and the same time, the importance of individual free choice, in order to create a more cohesive society (Ferragina, 2010;&lt;ref&gt;Ferragina, Pp. 76 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Ferragina, 2012&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YG0ryZmv5bMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Ferragina, E.

It is for this reason that social capital generated so much interest in the academic and political world
(Rose, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rose | first1 = N | year = 2000 | title = Community Citizenship and the Third Way | url = | journal = American Behavioural Scientist | volume = 43 | issue = 9| pages = 1395–1411 | doi=10.1177/00027640021955955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation ==
Pierre Bourdieu's work tends to show how social capital can be used practically to produce or reproduce inequality, demonstrating for instance how people gain access to powerful positions through the direct and indirect employment of social connections. Robert Putnam has used the concept in a much more positive light: though he was at first careful to argue that social capital was a neutral term, stating "whether or not [the] shared are praiseworthy is, of course, entirely another matter",&lt;ref name="Edwards 1997"&gt;Foley, M. W. &amp; Edwards, B. (1997). ''Escape from politics?''&lt;/ref&gt; his work on American society tends to frame social capital as a producer of "[[civic engagement]]" and also a broad societal measure of communal health.&lt;ref name="Alessandrini 2002"&gt;Alessandrini, M. (2002). ''Is Civil Society an Adequate Theory?''&lt;/ref&gt; He also transforms social capital from a resource possessed by individuals to an attribute of collectives, focusing on norms and trust as producers of social capital to the exclusion of networks.

Mahyar Arefi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arefi | first1 = M | year = 2003 | title = Revisiting the Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative (LANI): Lessons for Planners | url = | journal = Journal of Planning Education and Research | volume = 22 | issue = 4| page = 384 | doi=10.1177/0739456x03022004005}}&lt;/ref&gt; identifies [[consensus]] building as a direct positive indicator of social capital. Consensus implies "shared interest" and agreement among various actors and stakeholders to induce collective action. Collective action is thus an indicator of increased social capital.

Edwards and Foley, as editors of a special edition of the ''American Behavioural Scientist'' on "Social Capital, Civil Society and Contemporary Democracy", raised two key issues in the study of social capital. First, social capital is not equally available to all, in much the same way that other forms of capital are differently available. Geographic and social isolation limit access to this resource. Second, not all social capital is created equally. The value of a specific source of social capital depends in no small part on the socio-economic position of the source with society. On top of this, Portes has identified four negative consequences of social capital: exclusion of outsiders; excess claims on group members; restrictions on individual freedom; and downward levelling norms.&lt;ref name="Portes 1998"&gt;Portes, A. (1998). ''Social Capital: its origins and applications in modern sociology'' Annual Review of Sociology, 24, 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Varshney&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/varshney/home|title=Ashutosh Varshney: Home|website=umich.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied the correlation between the presence of interethnic networks (bridging) versus intra-ethnic ones (bonding) on ethnic violence in India.&lt;ref name="Varshney"&gt;Varshney Ashutosh, Ethnic Conflict and Civil Society India and Beyond, in World Politics, Volume 53, Number 3, April 2001, pp. 362-398&lt;/ref&gt;
He argues that interethnic networks are agents of peace because they build bridges and manage tensions, by noting that if communities are organized only along intra-ethnic lines and the interconnections with other communities are very weak or even nonexistent, then ethnic violence is quite likely.
Three main implications of intercommunal ties explain their worth:
# Facilitate communication in the community across ethnic lines
# Squelch false rumors
# Help the administration carry out its job and in particular peace, security and justice

This is a useful distinction; nevertheless its implication on social capital can only be accepted if one espouses the functionalist understanding of the latter concept. Indeed, it can be argued that interethnic, as well as intra-ethnic networks can serve various purposes, either increasing or diminishing social capital. In fact, Varshney himself notes that intraethnic policing (equivalent to the "self-policing" mechanism proposed by Fearon and Laitin)&lt;ref name="Fearon"&gt;James Fearon and David Laitin, 1996, "Explaining Inter-Ethnic Cooperation", American Political Science Review, December 1996&lt;/ref&gt; may lead to the same result as interethnic engagement.

Social capital is often linked to the success of democracy and political involvement. [[Robert D. Putnam]], in his book ''[[Bowling Alone]]'' makes the argument that social capital is linked to the recent decline in American political participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Putnam |first=Robert D. |date=January 1995|title=Bowling Alone: America's Declining Social Capital |journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=6|issue=1|pages=65–78|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/DETOC/assoc/bowling.html|doi=10.1353/jod.1995.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Putnam's theoretical framework has been firstly applied to the South of Italy (Putnam, 1993). This framework has been rediscussed by considering simultaneously the condition of European regions and specifically Southern Italy (Ferragina, 2012; Ferragina, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;The results suggest that medieval history does not explain the lack of social capital in the South of Italy. On the contrary, the historical legacy mitigates the negative effect of inequitable income distribution, low labour market participation and weak national cohesion on social capital (Ferragina 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions, forms, and measurement ==

Social capital has multiple definitions, interpretations, and uses. Thomas Sander&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tom Sander|url = http://www.hks.harvard.edu/programs/saguaro/about/who-we-are/tom-sander|website = www.hks.harvard.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-02|laysource = Executive Director of the Saguaro Seminar: Civic Engagement in America, a program of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines it as "the collective [[Value theory|value]] of all [[social network]]s (who people know), and the inclinations that arise from these networks to do things for each other ([[Norm (social)|norms]] of [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]])." Social capital, in this view, emphasizes "specific [[Goodness and value theory|benefits]] that flow from the [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]], [[information]], and [[cooperation]] associated with social networks". It "creates value for the people who are connected, and for [[Free rider problem|bystanders]] as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hks.harvard.edu/programs/saguaro/about-social-capital|title = About Social Capital|date = |accessdate = December 2, 2015|website = Saguaro Seminar: Civic Engagement in America|publisher = John F.

David Halpern argues that the popularity of social capital for policymakers is linked to the concept's duality, coming because "it has a hard nosed economic feel while restating the importance of the social." For researchers, the term is popular partly due to the broad range of outcomes it can explain;&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, D (2005) ''Social Capital'' Cambridge: Polity Press. p1-2&lt;/ref&gt; the multiplicity of uses for social capital has led to a multiplicity of definitions. Social capital has been used at various times to explain superior managerial performance,&lt;ref&gt;Moran 2005&lt;/ref&gt; the growth of entrepreneurial firms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stam | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2014 | title = Social capital of entrepreneurs and small firm performance: A meta-analysis of contextual and methodological moderators | url = | journal = Journal of Business Venturing | volume = 29 | issue = 1| pages = 152–173 | doi=10.1016/j.jbusvent.2013.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; improved performance of functionally diverse groups,&lt;ref&gt;Evans and Carson 2005&lt;/ref&gt; the value derived from strategic alliances,&lt;ref&gt;Koka and Prescott 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and enhanced supply chain relations.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath and Sparks 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
'A resource that actors derive from specific social structures and then use to pursue their interests; it is created by changes in the relationship among actors'; (Baker 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;619).

Early attempts to define social capital focused on the degree to which social capital as a resource should be used for public good or for the benefit of individuals. Putnam&lt;ref&gt;1993&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that social capital would facilitate co-operation and mutually supportive relations in communities and nations and would therefore be a valuable means of combating many of the social disorders inherent in modern societies, for example crime. In contrast to those focusing on the individual benefit derived from the web of social relationships and ties individual actors find themselves in, attribute social capital to increased personal access to information and skill sets and enhanced power.&lt;ref&gt;Uzzi and Dunlap 2005&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, individuals could use social capital to further their own career prospects, rather than for the good of organisations.

In ''The Forms of Capital''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Pierre |last=Bourdieu |authorlink=Pierre Bourdieu |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/bourdieu-forms-capital.htm |title=The Forms of Capital |year=198 |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Bourdieu]] distinguishes between three forms of capital: [[capital (economics)|economic capital]], [[cultural capital]] and social capital. He defines social capital as "the aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition."&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 1983"&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. (1983). "Ökonomisches Kapital, kulturelles Kapital, soziales Kapital" in Soziale Ungleichheiten (Soziale Welt, Sonderheft 2), edited by Reinhard Kreckel. Goettingen: Otto Schartz &amp; Co. pp. 249&lt;/ref&gt; His treatment of the concept is instrumental, focusing on the advantages to possessors of social capital and the ''"deliberate construction of sociability for the purpose of creating this resource."''&lt;ref name="Portes 1998" /&gt; Quite contrary to Putnam's positive view of social capital, Bourdieu employs the concept to demonstrate a mechanism for the generational reproduction of inequality. Bourdieu thus points out that the wealthy and powerful use their "old boys network" or other social capital to maintain advantages for themselves, their social class, and their children.

[[James Samuel Coleman|James Coleman]] defined social capital functionally as "a variety of entities with two elements in common: they all consist of some aspect of social structure, and they facilitate certain actions of actors...within the structure"&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coleman|first=James|date=1988|title=Social Capital in the Creation of Human Capital|jstor=2780243|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=94|pages=95–120|doi=10.1086/228943|citeseerx=10.1.1.208.1462}}&lt;/ref&gt;—that is, social capital is anything that facilitates individual or collective action, generated by networks of relationships, reciprocity, trust, and social norms.&lt;ref name="Portes 1998" /&gt; In Coleman's conception, social capital is a neutral resource that facilitates any manner of action, but whether society is better off as a result depends entirely on the individual uses to which it is put.&lt;ref name="Edwards 1997" /&gt;

According to Robert Putnam, social capital "connections among individuals – social networks and the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness that arise from them."&lt;ref name="Putnam2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert D. Putnam|title=Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rd2ibodep7UC&amp;pg=PA19|date=7 August 2001|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-0304-3|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Putnam and his followers, social capital is a key component to building and maintaining [[democracy]]. Putnam says that social capital is declining in the United States. This is seen in lower levels of trust in government and lower levels of civic participation. Putnam also says that television and [[urban sprawl]] have had a significant role in making America far less 'connected'. Putnam believes that social capital can be measured by the amount of trust and "reciprocity" in a community or between individuals.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Putnam also suggests that a root cause of the decline in social capital is women's entry the workforce, which could correlate with time restraints that inhibit civic organizational involvement like parent-teacher associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Putnam | first1 = R. D. | year = 1995 | title = Bowling alone: America's declining social capital | url = http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/RGID/article/view/60809| journal = Journal of Democracy | volume = 6 | issue = 1| pages = 65–78 | doi=10.1353/jod.1995.0002| format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Technological transformation of leisure (e.g., television) is another cause of declining social capital, as stated by Putnam. This offered a reference point from which several studies assessed social capital measurements by how media is engaged strategically to build social capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = D | year = 2006 | title = On and off the 'net: Scales for the social capital in an online era.

[[Nan Lin]]'s concept of social capital has a more individualistic approach: "Investment in social relations with expected returns in the marketplace." This may subsume the concepts of some others such as Bourdieu, Flap and Eriksson.&lt;ref&gt;as noted in Lin, Nan (2001). ''Social Capital'', Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton (1997){{citation needed|date=February 2016}} considered social capital as subjective phenomenon formed by values and attitudes which influence interactions.

In “Social capital, civil society, and development,” political economist [[Francis Fukuyama]] defines social capital as generally understood rules than enable people to cooperate such as the norm of reciprocity or religious doctrine like Christianity. Social capital is formed by repeated interactions over time and he argues is critical for development and difficult to generate through public policy. The importance of social capital for economic development is that these norms of behavior reduce [[transaction cost]] of exchange such as legal contracts and government regulations. Fukuyama suggests that while social capital is beneficial for development, it also imposes cost on non-group members with unintended consequences for general welfare. Referencing [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] in ''[[Democracy in America]],'' and what he described as the ‘art of association’ of Americans’ propensity for civil association, Fukuyama argues social capital is what produces a civil society. While civic engagement is an important part of democracy and development, Fukuyama states that, “one person’s civic engagement is another’s [[rent-seeking]].” Therefore, while social capital can facilitate economic development by reducing transaction cost and increasing productivity, social capital can also distort democracy if civic association enables special interest to gain special favors. However, Fukuyama argues despite the risk of society having too much social capital, it is nonetheless worse to have too little and be unable to organize for public goods and welfare enhancing activity.

Nahapiet and Ghoshal in their examination of the role of social capital in the creation of intellectual capital, suggest that social capital should be considered in terms of three clusters: structural, relational, and cognitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nahapiet | first1 = J. | last2 = Ghoshal | first2 = S. | year = 1998 | title = Social capital, intellectual capital and the organizational advantage | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 23 | issue = 2| pages = 242–266 | doi=10.5465/amr.1998.533225 | jstor=259373| citeseerx = 10.1.1.598.8940 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlos García Timón]] describes that the structural dimensions of social capital relate to an individual ability to make weak and strong ties to others within a system. This dimension focuses on the advantages derived from the configuration of an actor's, either individual or collective, network.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The differences between weak and strong ties are explained by Granovetter.&lt;ref name="Granovetter 1973"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Granovetter | first1 = M.

This is best characterized through trust of others and their cooperation and the identification an individual has within a network. Hazleton and Kennan&lt;ref&gt;Hazleton V. &amp; Kennan, W. (2000). Social capital: reconceptualizing the bottom line. Corporate Communications: An International Journal, 5 (2), 81-86.&lt;/ref&gt; added a third angle, that of communication. Communication is needed to access and use social capital through exchanging information, identifying problems and solutions, and managing conflict. According to [[Max Boisot|Boisot]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Boisot|Boisot, M.]] (1995) ''Information space: A framework for learning in organizations, institutions and culture'', London, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; and Boland and Tenkasi,&lt;ref&gt;Boland and Tenkasi (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; meaningful communication requires at least some sharing context between the parties to such exchange. The cognitive dimension focuses on the shared meaning and understanding that individuals or groups have with one another.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

A number of scholars have raised concerns about lack of precise definition of social capital. Portes, for example, noted that the term has become so widely used, including in mainstream media, that "the point is approaching at which social capital comes to be applied to so many events and in so many different contexts as to lose any distinct meaning."&lt;ref name="Lesser2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alejandro Portes|chapter=Social Capital: Its Origins and Applications in Modern Sociology|editor=Eric L. Lesser|title=Knowledge and Social Capital: Foundations and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQdKAf8-_yUC&amp;pg=PA44|date=1 February 2000|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-7507-7222-8|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robison, Schmid, and Siles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robison | first1 = L.J. | last2 = Schmid | first2 = A.A. | last3 = Siles | first3 = M.E. | year = 2002 | title = Is Social Capital Really Capital? | url = | journal = Review of Social Economy | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 1–21 | doi=10.1080/00346760110127074| citeseerx = 10.1.1.195.8949 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  reviewed various definitions of social capital and concluded that many did not satisfy the formal requirement of a definition.  They noted that definitions must be of the form A=B while many definition of social capital described what it can be used to achieve, where it resides, how it can be created, and what it can transform.  In addition, they argue that many proposed definition of social capital fail to satisfy the requirements of capital.  They propose that social capital be defined as "sympathy".  The object of another's sympathy has social capital.  Those who have sympathy for others provide social capital.  One of the main advantages of having social capital is that it provides access to resources on preferential terms.  Their definition of sympathy follows that used by Adam Smith, the title of his first chapter in the "Theory of Moral Sentiments."

A network-based conception can also be used for characterizing the social capital of collectivities (such as organizations or business clusters).&lt;ref&gt;Huber, F. (2009) ''[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122242385/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 Social Capital of Economic Clusters: Towards a Network-based Conception of Social Resources]''. Journal of Economic and Social Geography (TESG) 100(2):160-170&lt;/ref&gt; Lester (name change to Amber Persons) noted that negative social capital may be the cause for disadvantageous differences among minority firms versus majority firms. While studying norms among African-American family firms and Euro-American family firms, Lester noted that negative social capital was created when the owner of the company was pressured to engage in social behavior not conducive to firm profits.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, M. et. al (2013) ''Family Firms and Negative Social Capital: A Property Rights Theory Approach'' Journal of Behavior and Applied Management 15(11): 11-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roots ==

=== A new name from an old idea ===
The modern emergence of social capital concept renewed the academic interest for an old debate in social science: the relationship between trust, social networks and the development of modern industrial society. Social Capital Theory gained importance through the integration of classical sociological theory with the description of an intangible form of capital. In this way the classical definition of capital has been overcome allowing researchers to tackle issues in a new manner (Ferragina, 2010:73).
Through the social capital concept researchers have tried to propose a synthesis between the value contained in the communitarian approaches and individualism professed by the 'rational choice theory.' Social capital can only be generated collectively thanks to the presence of communities and social networks, but individuals and groups can use it at the same time. Individuals can exploit social capital of their networks to achieve private objectives and groups can use it to enforce a certain set of norms or behaviors. In this sense, social capital is generated collectively but it can also be used individually, bridging the dichotomized approach 'communitarianism' versus 'individualism' (Ferragina, 2010:75).&lt;ref&gt;Ferragina (2010), Pp.75&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Definitional issues ===

The term ''[[capital (economics)|capital]]'' is used by analogy with other forms of economic capital, as social capital is argued to have similar (although less measurable) benefits. However, the analogy with capital is misleading to the extent that, unlike traditional forms of capital, social capital is not depleted by use;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Bollier]]: ''The Cornucopia of the Commons]'' ([http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/reclaiming-the-commons/the-cornucopia-of-the-commons link]), [[Yes! (U.S. magazine)|''yes!'' magazine]], June 30, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; in fact it is depleted by non-use (''use it or lose it''). In this respect, it is similar to the now well-established economic concept of [[human capital]].

Social capital is also distinguished from the economic theory [[social capitalism]].  Social capitalism as a theory challenges the idea that socialism and capitalism are mutually exclusive. Social capitalism posits that a strong social support network for the poor enhances capital output. By decreasing poverty, capital market participation is enlarged.

=== Sub-types ===
In ''Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community'' (Putnam, 2000), Harvard political scientist [[Robert D. Putnam]] wrote: "[[Henry Ward Beecher]]'s advice a century ago to 'multiply picnics' is not entirely ridiculous today. We should do this, ironically, not because it will be good for America — though it will be — but because it will be good for us."&lt;ref name="Putnam 2000" /&gt;

[[Daniel P. Aldrich]], Associate Professor at Purdue University, describes three mechanisms of social capital. Aldrich defines the three differences as bonding, bridging, and linking social capital. Bonding capital are the relationships a person has with friends and family, making it also the strongest form of social capital. Bridging capital is the relationship between friends of friends, making its strength secondary to bonding capital. Linking capital is the relationship between a person and a government official or other elected leader. Aldrich also applies the ideas of social capital to the fundamental principles of disaster recovery, and discusses factors that either aid or impede recovery, such as extent of damage, population density, quality of government and aid. He primarily examines Japanese recovery following the 2011 Fukishima nuclear meltdown in his book "Building Resilience: Social Capital in Post-Disaster Recovery."{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Putnam speaks of two main components of the concept: ''bonding social capital'' and ''bridging social capital'', the creation of which Putnam credits to Ross Gittell and Avis Vidal. Bonding refers to the value assigned to social networks between homogeneous groups of people and Bridging refers to that of social networks between socially heterogeneous groups. Typical examples are that criminal gangs create bonding social capital, while [[choir]]s and bowling clubs (hence the title, as Putnam lamented their decline) create bridging social capital.&lt;ref name="KaidHoltz-Bacha2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lynda Lee Kaid|author2=Christina Holtz-Bacha|title=Encyclopedia of Political Communication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bCd1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT106|date=21 December 2007|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-6562-9|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction is useful in highlighting how social capital may not always be beneficial for society as a whole (though it is always an asset for those individuals and groups involved). Horizontal networks of individual citizens and groups that enhance community productivity and cohesion are said to be positive social capital assets whereas self-serving exclusive gangs and hierarchical patronage systems that operate at cross purposes to [[societal]] interests can be thought of as negative social capital burdens on society.

Social capital development on the internet via social networking websites such as [[Facebook]] or [[Myspace]] tends to be bridging capital according to one study, though "virtual" social capital is a new area of research.&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, N. B., Steinfield, C., &amp; Lampe, C. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two other sub-sources of social capital.  These are consummatory, or a behavior that is made up of actions that fulfill a basis of doing what is inherent, and instrumental, or behavior that is taught through ones surroundings over time.&lt;ref name="Portes p. 7-8"&gt;Portes p. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Two examples of consummatory social capital are value interjection and solidarity.  Value interjection pertains to a person or community that fulfills obligations such as paying bills on time, philanthropy, and following the rules of society.  People that live their life this way feel that these are norms of society and are able to live their lives free of worry for their credit, children, and receive charity if needed.  Coleman goes on to say that when people live in this way and benefit from this type of social capital, individuals in the society are able to rest assured that their belongings and family will be safe.&lt;ref&gt;Portes p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding of solidarity may be traced to 19th century [[socialism|socialist]] thinkers. The main focus of these thinkers was the urban working class of the Industrial Revolution. They analyzed the reasons these workers supported each other for the benefit of the group and held that this support was an adaptation to the immediate social environment, as opposed to a trait that had been taught to the workers in their youth.&lt;ref name="Portes p. 7-8" /&gt;  As another example, Coleman states that possessing this type of social capital individuals to stand up for what they believe in, and even die for it, in the face of adversity.&lt;ref name="Portes p. 8"&gt;Portes p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; (While the notion of solidarity as social capital is sometimes attributed to [[Karl Marx]], in particular, the term "social capital" had a quite different meaning for Marx. All forms of "capital" were, for Marx, possessed only by capitalists and he emphasied the basis of labour in capitalist society, as a class constituted by individuals obliged to sell their [[labour power]], because they lacked sufficient capital, in any sense of the word, to do otherwise. Marx saw "social capital" as a theoretical total amount of capital, purely in the sense of accumulated wealth or property, that existed within in a particular society. He thereby contrasted it with specific and discrete "individual capital".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1885-c2/ch18.htm Karl Marx, 1885, ''Capital Volume II, Part III: The Reproduction and Circulation of the Aggregate Social Capital, Chapter 18: Introduction  I. The Subject Investigated''], (24 March 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;)

The second of these two other sub-sources of social capital is that of instrumental social capital. The basis of the category of social capital is that an individual who donates his or her resources not because he is seeking direct repayment from the recipient, but because they are part of the same social structure. By his or her donation, the individual might not see a direct repayment, but, most commonly, they will be held by the society in greater honor.&lt;ref name="Portes p. 8" /&gt; The best example of this, and the one that Portes mentions, is the donation of a scholarship to a member of the same ethnic group.  The donor is not freely giving up his resources to be directly repaid by the recipient, but, as stated above, the honor of the community.  With this in mind, the recipient might not know the benefactor personally, but he or she prospers on the sole factor that he or she is a member of the same social group.&lt;ref&gt;Portes p. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Social capital is also linked  with religious communities. Religion represents important aspect of social capital ([[religious social capital]]).&lt;ref&gt;[''Wojciech Sadłoń: Religijny kapitał społeczny. Saabrucken: Bezkresy Wiedzy, 2014, s. 297. {{ISBN|978-3-639-89111-9}}''].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measurement ===

There is no widely held consensus on how to measure social capital, which has become a debate in itself.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Why refer to this phenomenon as 'capital' if there is no true way to measure it?  While one can usually intuitively sense the level/amount of social capital present in a given relationship{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}(regardless of type or scale), quantitative measuring has proven somewhat complicated.  This has resulted in different metrics for different functions.

==== Name generators ====
One type of quantitative social capital measure uses name generators to construct social networks and to measure the level of social capital. These networks are constructed by asking participants to name people that they interact with, such as "Name all the people you've discussed important matters within the past six months." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marsden|first=Peter V.|date=1987-01-01|title=Core Discussion Networks of Americans|jstor=2095397|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=52|issue=1|pages=122–131|doi=10.2307/2095397}}&lt;/ref&gt; Name generators are often useful to construct core discussion networks of close ties, rather than weaker ties.

==== Social capital scales ====
Many studies measure social capital by asking the question: "do you trust the others?" Other researches analyse the participation in voluntary associations or civic activities.

To expand upon the methodological potential of measuring online and offline social bonding, as it relates to social capital,&lt;ref&gt;Williams (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; offers a matrix of social capital measures that distinguishes social bridging as a form of less emotionally tethered relationships compared to bonding. Bonding and bridging sub-scales are proposed, which have been adopted by over 300 scholarly articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=8554118995697847065&amp;as_sdt=205&amp;sciodt=0,1&amp;hl=en|title=- Google Scholar|website=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lin, Peng, Kim, Kim &amp; LaRose (2012) offer a noteworthy application of the scale by measuring international residents originating from locations outside of the United States. The study found that social media platforms like [[Facebook]] provide an opportunity for increased social capital, but mostly for extroverts. However, less introverted social media users could engage social media and build social capital by connecting with Americans before arriving and then maintaining old relationships from home upon arriving to the states. The ultimate outcome of the study indicates that social capital is measurable and is a concept that may be operationalized to understand strategies for coping with cross-cultural immersion through online engagement.

==== Cohesion measures ====
The level of cohesion of a group also affects its social capital and vica versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320656629|title=Public Brainpower: Civil Society and Natural Resource Management|last=Overland|first=Indra|date=2018-01-01|pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://my.vanderbilt.edu/perkins/files/2011/09/PerkinsLong.2002.Neighborhood_sense_of_communitysocial_capital.pdf|title=Perkins, D.D., &amp; Long, D.A. (2002). Neighborhood sense of community and social capital: A multi-level analysis. In A. Fisher, C. Sonn, &amp; B. Bishop (Eds.), Psychological sense of community: Research, applications, and implications (pp. 291-318). New York: Plenum|format=PDF|accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there is no one quantitative way of determining the level of cohesiveness, but rather a collection of social network models that researchers have used over the decades to operationalize social capital. One of the dominant methods is Ronald Burt's constraint measure, which taps into the role of tie strength and group cohesion. Another network-based model is network transitivity.

==== Other assorted measurement and social capital findings ====
In measuring political social capital, it is common to take the sum of society's membership of its groups.  Groups with higher membership (such as [[political parties]]) contribute more to the amount of capital than groups with lower membership, although many groups with low membership (such as communities) still add up to be significant.  While it may seem that this is limited by population, this need not be the case as people join multiple groups.  In a study done by Yankee City,&lt;ref&gt;W. Lloyd Warner, J.O. Low, Paul S. Lunt, &amp; Leo Srole (1963). ''Yankee City''.  New Haven, CT: Yale University Press&lt;/ref&gt; a community of 17,000 people was found to have over 22,000 different groups.

Knack and Keefer (1996) measured econometrically correlations between confidence and civic cooperation norms, with economic growth in a big group of countries. They found that confidence and civic cooperation have a great impact in economic growth, and that in less polarized societies in terms of inequality and ethnic differences, social capital is bigger.

Narayan and Pritchet (1997) researched the associativity degree and economic performance in rural homes of Tanzania. They saw that even in high poverty indexes, families with higher levels of incomes had more participation in collective organizations. The social capital they accumulated because of this participation had individual benefits for them, and created collective benefits through different routes, for example: their agricultural practices were better than those of the families without participation (they had more information about agrochemicals, fertilizers and seeds); they had more information about the market; they were prepared to take more risks, because being part of a social network made them feel more protected; they had an influence on the improvement of public services, showing a bigger level of participation in schools; they cooperated more in the municipality level.

How a group relates to the rest of society also affects social capital, but in a different manner.  Strong internal ties can in some cases weaken the group's perceived capital in the eyes of the general public, as in cases where the group is geared towards crime, distrust, intolerance, violence or hatred towards others.  The [[Ku Klux Klan]] is an example of this kind of organizations.

Sociologists [[Carl L. Bankston]] and [[Min Zhou]] have argued that one of the reasons social capital is so difficult to measure is that it is neither an individual-level nor a group-level phenomenon, but one that emerges across levels of analysis as individuals participate in groups. They argue that the metaphor of "capital" may be misleading because unlike financial capital, which is a resource held by an individual, the benefits of forms of social organization are not held by actors, but are results of the participation of actors in advantageously organized groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bankston | first1 = Carl L. | last2 = Zhou | first2 = Min | year = 2002 | title = Social Capital as Process: The Meanings and Problems of a Theoretical Metaphor? | url = | journal = Sociological Inquiry | volume = 72 | issue = 2| pages = 285–317 | doi=10.1111/1475-682x.00017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, Foschi and Lauriola presented a measure of sociability as a proxy of social capital. The authors demonstrated that facets of sociability can mediate between general personality traits and measures of civic involvement and political participation, as predictors of social capital, in a holistic model of political behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foschi | first1 = R. | last2 = Lauriola | first2 = M. | year = 2014 | title = Does sociability predict civic involvement and political participation? | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/106/2/339/| journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 106 | issue = 2| pages = 339–357 | doi=10.1037/a0035331| pmid = 24467426 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integrating history and socio-economic analysis ==

=== Beyond Putnam ===
Robert Putnam's work contributed to shape the discussion of the importance of social capital. His conclusions have been praised but also criticized. Criticism has mainly focused on:
* the lack of awareness of the structural socio-economic conditions of society (see Skocpol 1996;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Skocpol | first1 = T | year = 1996 | title = Unravelling from Above | url = | journal = The American Prospect | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 20–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Skocpol et al. 2000;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Skocpol | first1 = T. | last2 = Ganz | first2 = M. | last3 = Munson | first3 = Z. | year = 2000 | title = A Nation of Organisers: The institutional Origins of Civic Voluntarism in the United States | url = http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:12641806| journal = American Political Science Review | volume = 94 | issue = 3| pages = 527–46 | doi=10.2307/2585829| jstor = 2585829 | format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomson | first1 = I.T. | year = 2005 | title = The Theory that Won't Die: From Mass Society to the Decline of Social Capital | url = | journal = Sociological Forum | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 421–48 | doi=10.1007/s11206-005-6596-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; as for example, the level of income inequality (Knack and Keefer 1997;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knack | first1 = S. | last2 = Keefer | first2 = P. | year = 1997 | title = Does Social Capital Have an Economic Pay-Off ?

(2010) Social Capital and Equality: Tocqueville's legacy. The Tocqueville Review, XXXI, 73–98&lt;/ref&gt;
* the excessive determinism of the historical analysis (Lupo 1993;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lupo | first1 = S | year = 1993 | title = Usi e Abusi del Passato. Le Radici dell'Italia di Putnam | url = | journal = Meridiana | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 151–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lemann 1996;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lemann | first1 = N | year = 1996 | title = Kicking in Groups | url = | journal = Atlantic Monthly | volume = 277 | issue = | pages = 22–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarrow 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tarrow | first1 = S | year = 1996 | title = Making Social Science Work across Space and Time: A Critical Reflection on Robert Putnam's Making Democracy Work | url = | journal = American Political Science Review | volume = 90 | issue = 2| pages = 389–97 | doi=10.2307/2082892| jstor = 2082892 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Putnam's social capital index does not consider racial diversity which links to worse outcomes (Hero 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Racial Diversity and Social Capital: Equality and Community in America|last = Hero|first = Rodney|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-521-69861-0|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor does Putnam consider ethnic diversity, which often creates barriers to cooperation and democratization.&lt;ref&gt;Dowley, Kathleen M., and Brian D. Silver, "Social Capital, Ethnicity and Support for Democracy in the Post-Communist States," Europe-Asia Studies, Vol. 54, No. 4 (2002): 505-527.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the conflation of social capital with civil society, the lack of empirical evidence connecting social capital's promotion of economic growth and substantiating the decline of social capital in the United States in the last 35 years, and the assumption that social networks produce win-win relationships (Defilippis 2001).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeFilippis|first=James|date=2001-01-01|title=The myth of social capital in community development|journal=Housing Policy Debate|volume=12|issue=4|pages=781–806|doi=10.1080/10511482.2001.9521429|issn=1051-1482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferragina (2012;&lt;ref name="books.google.com" /&gt; 2013) integrated the insights of these two criticisms and proposed a cross-regional analysis of 85 European regions, linking together the socio-economic and the historic- institutional analyses to explore the determinants of social capital. He argued that to investigate the determinants of social capital, one has to integrate the synchronic and the diachronic perspectives under the guidance of a methodological framework able to put these two approaches in continuity.

=== The sleeping social capital theory ===
Putnam's work, nourished by doctrines like the ''[[end of history]]'' (Fukuyama 1992)&lt;ref&gt;Fukuyama, F. (1992) The End of History and the Last Man, London, Penguin&lt;/ref&gt; was largely deterministic, and proposed the dismissal of more articulated historical interpretations. This determinism has reduced Southern Italian history as being a negative path to modernity; only the Italian regions that experienced the development of medieval towns during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries have got high levels of social capital today, the others 'are condemned' by the prevalence of the authoritarian rule of the Normans more than 800 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shindler|first1=Michael|title=A Criticism of Putnam's Theory of Social Capital|url=http://theapollonianrevolt.com/analysis-social-capital-approach/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021174153/http://theapollonianrevolt.com/analysis-social-capital-approach/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 October 2014|website=The Apollonian Revolt|publisher=The Apollonian Revolt|accessdate=6 April 2015|format=MLA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, from a purely historical perspective, the medieval town is not unanimously considered to be a symbol of freedom, creation of horizontal ties and embryo of democratic life. In Making Democracy Work, Putnam disregarded the division within municipal towns and their dearth of civic participation and considered only the experience of few areas in North Central Italy, ignoring the existence of important towns in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YG0ryZmv5bMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Ferragina, E.

To this more complicated historical picture, Ferragina (2012)&lt;ref name="books.google.com" /&gt; added the result of a regression model, which indicated that social capital in the South of Italy and Wallonia should be much lower than currently detected according to their socio-economic condition. He unfolded Putnam's theory by undertaking a comparative analysis between these two deviant cases and two regular cases located in the same country, namely Flanders and the North of Italy. The historical legacy does not have a negative effect on the present lack of social capital in Wallonia and the South of Italy, but the potentially positive effect of the historical legacy is currently curtailed by the poor socio-economic conditions, notably by the high level of income inequality and the low level of labour market participation. This historical interpretation is driven by the comparison with Flanders and the North East of Italy.

The value of the historical legacy for present socio-economic development is similar to the 'appropriable social capital' theorized by Coleman (1990)&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, J.S. (1990) Foundations of Social Theory, Cambridge MA, Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; at the individual level.&lt;ref name="Ferragina, E. 2012"&gt;Ferragina, E. (2012) Social Capital in Europe: A Comparative Regional Analysis. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar&lt;/ref&gt; Using the example of the Korean students, Coleman argued that the construction of a secret network of people (at a time in which the appreciation for the authoritarian government was rapidly declining among the population) as a means of organizing the democratic revolt was the result of a process of socialization that took place during their childhood (with the involvement in the local churches).

The relation between historical evolutions and the socio-economic variables has similar characteristics at the macro level.&lt;ref name="Ferragina, E. 2012" /&gt; Only after reaching a sufficient level of labour market activity and income redistribution (this is comparable to the growing unpopularity of the authoritarian government) can the memory of historical events of social engagement become fully appropriable by the population (this is comparable to the participation in the local churches during childhood), leading to the development of innovative forms of social participation (this is comparable to the construction of the secret circles that enhanced the democratic revolt). This process increases social capital even further if socio-economic development is matched by the revival of the unique historical legacy of the area.&lt;ref&gt;Social Capital in Europe: A Comparative Regional Analysis. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar&lt;/ref&gt; The reconstruction of this unique past can rapidly become a source of pride for the entire area, contributing in turn to an increasing intra-regional solidarity, and with it enhancement of social networks and social trust.

The Flemish case (and also to a lesser extent that of the North East of Italy) illustrates this process well. The socio-economic improvements that took place in the nineteenth century were matched by the revival of the glorious Flemish traditions of the thirteenth and fourteenth century. The increase of social capital generated by the reduction of income inequality and the increasing participation in the labour market due to the economic development was multiplied by the reconstruction of Flemish identity and pride. This pride and self-confidence has, in turn, increased the feeling of solidarity within the region and contributed to generate a level of social capital, which is hardly explicable by the single socio-economic predictors.&lt;ref name="Ferragina, E. 2012" /&gt;

Ferragina suggests that, in the divergent cases, the value of the historical legacy is affected by the poor present socio-economic conditions. Social capital sleeps, not because of the absence of certain clearly defined historical steps as suggested by Putnam, but because socio-economic underdevelopment profoundly depressed the self-pride of Southern Italians and Walloons.

The biased and simplistic interpretations of Southern Italian and Walloon history will be discarded only when their socio-economic conditions reach a sufficient level, enacting a cycle similar to Flanders and the North East of Italy. Stronger redistribution, an increase of labour market participation accompanied by a simultaneous process of 'reinvention of the past' could enhance a positive cycle of social capital increase in both areas. The historical legacy in these two areas should not be seen as the root of the present lack of social capital but as a potential element for improvement. Important moments of social engagement also existed in the history of these two areas; the imagery of Walloons and Southern Italians should be nourished by these almost forgotten examples of collective history (i.e. the Fasci Siciliani in the south of Italy) rather than the prevailing idea that the historical legacy of these areas is simply an original sin, a burden to carry through the process of modernization.&lt;ref name="Ferragina, E. 2012" /&gt;

=== Social capital motives ===
Robison and colleagues measured the relative importance of selfishness and four social capital motives using resource allocation data collected in hypothetical surveys and non-hypothetical experiments. The selfishness motive assumes that an agent's allocation of a scarce resource is independent of his relationships with others. This motive is sometimes referred to as the selfishness of preference assumption in neoclassical economics. Social capital motives assume that agents' allocation of a scarce resource may be influenced by their social capital or sympathetic relationships with others which may produce socio-emotional goods that satisfy socio-emotional needs for validation and belonging.  The first social capital motive seeks for validation by acting consistently with the values of one's ideal self.  The second social capital motive seeks to be validated by others by winning their approval.  The third social capital motive seeks to belong.  Recognizing that one may not be able to influence the sympathy of others, persons seeking to belong may act to increase their own sympathy for others and the organizations or institutions they represent.  The fourth social capital motive recognizes that our sympathy or social capital for another person will motivate us to act in their interest.  In doing so we satisfy our own needs for validation and belonging.  Empirical results reject the hypothesis often implied in economics that we are 95% selfish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robison | first1 = Lindon J. | last2 = Shupp | first2 = Robert S. | last3 = Jin | first3 = Songqing | last4 = Siles | first4 = Marcelo E. | last5 = Ferrarini | first5 = Tawni H. | year = 2012 | title = The relative importance of selfishness and social capital motives | url = | journal = The Journal of Socio-Economics | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 118–127 | doi=10.1016/j.socec.2011.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with neoliberalism ==

The social capital concept has influenced academic literature and public debate through the specter of social disintegration: would anybody disagree with the fact that we need healthy communities and civic engagement to protect our democracies? Ferragina and Arrigoni have argued that the popularity of this theory is rooted in the connection made with neoliberalism by James Coleman (1990) and Robert Putnam (1993). They contend that social capital theory has become an analytical tool to avoid the debate on the effects of neoliberal policies on civic engagement (Ferragina and Arrigoni 2016: 9&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Rise and Fall of Social Capital: Requiem for a Theory?|first1=Emanuele|last1=Ferragina|first2=Alessandro|last2=Arrigoni|date=1 August 2017|journal=Political Studies Review|volume=15|issue=3|pages=355–367|doi=10.1177/1478929915623968}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

More specifically, by elaborating the most popular version of social capital theory, Putnam (1993) revitalised Tocqueville's seminal work on American democracy, showing that 'the health of liberal democracy' depends upon social engagement. However, in linking social capital, neoliberalism, and rational choice theory, Putnam did not consider that the intensity of social engagement in a society tends to be strictly related to the level of economic inequality (Ferragina, 2010, 2012) and other structural factors (Costa and Kahn, 2003), such as the universal nature of the welfare state (Rothstein, 2008). Hence, by arguing that the disadvantaged need more social capital to insure themselves against the odds of a competitive world, Putnam implicitly suggests that being powerless is a result of not having enough capital rather than a structural problem of society (Ferragina and Arrigoni 2016).

However, in a period during which neoliberal governance is showing many drawbacks and the marked incapacity to deliver economic growth (Piketty, 2014), it is possible that to strengthen secondary groups and social engagement, more equality and greater levels of solidarity are needed (as classically argued by Tocqueville, see Ferragina, 2010).

There is a tension between the individualisation of social risks pursued by several political parties and the call to create social capital: it is becoming harder to blame the individual for collective problems. Prior to the start of the economic crisis in 2008, the tension between rising economic inequality and the demand to strengthen civic engagement was undermined by neoliberalism's capacity to sustain a certain level of economic growth. One might claim this capacity contributed to a transposition of social capital theory within public discourse. The limitations of finance as the central engine of economic growth, the material hardships fostered by the crisis, and the austerity measures implemented by governments in response to these challenges are critically undermining the legitimacy of neoliberal policies (Ferragina and Arrigoni 2016: 10).

== Relation with civil society ==
A number of authors&lt;ref name="Alessandrini 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cox in Alessandrini (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt in Alessandrini (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walzer (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; give definitions of civil society that refer to voluntary associations and organisations outside the market and state. This definition is very close to that of the third sector, which consists of "private organisations that are formed and sustained by groups of people acting voluntarily and without seeking personal profit to provide benefits for themselves or for others".{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} According to such authors as Walzer, Alessandrini, Newtown, Stolle and Rochon, Foley and Edwards, and Walters, it is through civil society, or more accurately, the third sector, that individuals are able to establish and maintain relational networks. These voluntary associations also connect people with each other, build trust and reciprocity through informal, loosely structured associations, and consolidate society through altruism without obligation. It is "this range of activities, services and associations produced by... civil society"&lt;ref name="Alessandrini 2002" /&gt; that constitutes the sources of social capital.

If civil society, then, is taken to be synonymous with the third sector then the question it seems is not 'how important is social capital to the production of a civil society?' but 'how important is civil society to the production of social capital?'.{{Original research inline|date=September 2007}} Not only have the authors above documented how civil society produces sources of social capital, but in Lyons work ''Third Sector'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Third Sector| year=2001| last=Lyons}}&lt;/ref&gt; social capital does not appear in any guise under either the factors that enable or those that stimulate the growth of the third sector, and Onyx&lt;ref&gt;Onyx (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; describes how social capital depends on an already functioning community.

The idea that creating social capital (i.e., creating networks) will strengthen civil society underlies current Australian social policy aimed at bridging deepening social divisions. The goal is to reintegrate those marginalised from the rewards of the economic system into "the community". However, according to Onyx (2000), while the explicit aim of this policy is inclusion, its effects are exclusionary.

Foley and Edwards&lt;ref&gt;Foley and Edwards (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; believe that "political systems... are important determinants of both the character of civil society and of the uses to which whatever social capital exists might be put".&lt;ref name="Edwards 1997" /&gt; Alessandrini agrees, saying, "in Australia in particular, neo-liberalism has been recast as economic rationalism and identified by several theorists and commentators as a danger to society at large because of the use to which they are putting social capital to work".&lt;ref name="Alessandrini 2002" /&gt;

The resurgence of interest in social capital as a remedy for the cause of today's social problems draws directly on the assumption that these problems lie in the weakening of civil society. However this ignores the arguments of many theorists who believe that social capital leads to exclusion{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} rather than to a stronger civil society. In international development, [[Ben Fine]] and John Harriss have been heavily critical of the inappropriate adoption of social capital as a supposed panacea (promoting civil society organisations and NGOs, for example, as agents of development) for the inequalities generated by neo liberal economic development.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, Ben. (2001). ''Social Capital versus Social Theory: Political Economy and Social Science at the Turn of the Millennium''. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-24179-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harriss, J. (2001).  ''Depoliticizing Development: The World Bank and Social Capital''. Leftword/Anthem/Stylus.&lt;/ref&gt;  This leads to controversy as to the role of state institutions in the promotion of social capital.
An abundance of social capital is seen as being almost a necessary condition for modern [[liberal democracy]].  A low level of social capital leads to an excessively rigid and unresponsive political system and high levels of corruption, in the political system and in the region as a whole.  Formal public institutions require social capital in order to function properly, and while it is possible to have too much social capital (resulting in rapid changes and excessive regulation), it is decidedly worse to have too little.

Kathleen Dowley and Brian Silver published an article entitled "Social Capital, Ethnicity and Support for Democracy in the Post-Communist States". This article found that in post-communist states, higher levels of social capital did not equate to higher levels of democracy. However, higher levels of social capital led to higher support for democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen M. Dowley and Brian D. Silver, "Social Capital, Ethnicity and Support for Democracy in the Post-Communist States", ''Europe-Asia Studies'', 54, No. 4 (2002): 505-527.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of intellectuals in developing countries have argued that the idea of social capital, particularly when connected to certain ideas about civil society, is deeply implicated in contemporary modes of donor and NGO driven imperialism and that it functions, primarily, to blame the poor for their condition.&lt;ref&gt;For instance see David Moore's edited book 'The World Bank', University of KwaZulu-Natal Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of social capital in a Chinese social context has been closely linked with the concept of ''[[guanxi]]''.

An interesting attempt to measure social capital spearheaded by Corporate Alliance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corporatealliance.net |title=corporatealliance.net |publisher=corporatealliance.net |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the English speaking market segment of the United States of America and Xentrum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xentrum.org |title=xentrum.org |publisher=xentrum.org |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the Latin American Chamber of Commerce&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camaralatinoamericana.com/ |title=Camara Latinoamericana &gt; Home |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2014-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128191333/http://camaralatinoamericana.com/ |archivedate=28 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Utah on the Spanish speaking population of the same country, involves the quantity, quality and strength of an individual social capital.  With the assistance of software applications and web-based relationship-oriented systems such as [[LinkedIn]], these kinds of organizations are expected to provide its members with a way to keep track of the ''number'' of their relationships, meetings designed to boost the ''strength'' of each relationship using group dynamics, executive retreats and networking events as well as training in how to reach out to higher circles of ''influential'' people.

== Women's engagement with politics ==
{{See also|Sex differences in social capital}}

There are many factors that drive volume towards the ballot box, including education, employment, civil skills, and time. Careful evaluation of these fundamental factors often suggests that women do not vote at similar levels as men. However the gap between women and men voter turnout is diminishing and in some cases women are becoming more prevalent at the ballot box than their male counterparts. Recent research&lt;ref name="Harell 2009"&gt;Harell, A. (2009). ''Equal Participation but Separate Paths?: Women's Social Capital and Turnout''&lt;/ref&gt; on social capital is now serving as an explanation for this change.

Social capital offers a wealth of resources and networks that facilitate political engagement. Since social capital is readily available no matter the type of community, it is able to override more traditional queues for political engagement; e.g.: education, employment, civil skills, etc.

There are unique ways in which women organize. These differences from men make social capital more personable and impressionable to women audiences thus creating a stronger presence in regards to political engagement. A few examples of these characteristics are:
* Women's informal and formal networks tend toward care work that is often considered apolitical.&lt;ref name="Eliasoph 1998"&gt;Eliasoph, N. 1998. ''Avoiding Politics.'' Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Women are also more likely to engage in local politics and social movement activities than in traditional forums focused on national politics.&lt;ref name="Vickers 1997"&gt;Vickers, J. 1997. ''Reinventing Political Science: A Feminist Approach.'' Halifax: Fernwood.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Women are more likely to organize themselves in less hierarchical ways and to focus on creating consensus.&lt;ref name="Eliasoph 1998" /&gt;

The often informal nature of female social capital allows women to politicize apolitical environments without conforming to masculine standards, thus keeping this activity at a low public profile. These differences are hard to recognize within the discourse of political engagement and may explain why social capital has not been considered as a tool for female political engagement until as of late.&lt;ref name="Harell 2009" /&gt;

== Effects on health ==
A growing body of research has found that the presence of social capital through social networks and communities has a protective quality on health. Social capital affects health risk behavior in the sense that individuals who are embedded in a network or community rich in support, social trust, information, and norms, have resources that help achieve health goals.&lt;ref name="Lin 2001"&gt;Lin, N. Building a network theory of social capital. In N. Lin, K. Cook, &amp; R.S. Burt, (Eds.), ''Social capital: Theory and research,'' (pp.3-29). New York: Aldine de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a person who is sick with cancer may receive information, money, or moral support he or she needs to endure treatment and recover. Social capital also encourages social trust and membership. These factors can discourage individuals from engaging in risky health behaviors such as smoking and binge drinking.&lt;ref name="Bolin 2003"&gt;Bolin, K., Lindgren, B., Lindstrom, M., &amp; Nystedt, P. (2003)''Investments in social capital implications of social interactions for the production of health.''&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, neighbourhood social capital may also aid in buffering health inequities amongst children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/13/65|title=BMC Public Health – Full text – Does neighbourhood social capital aid in levelling the social gradient in the health and well-being of children and adolescents? A literature review|website=biomedcentral.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petrikova Ivica|first=Chadha Dhruv|date=2013|title=The Role of Social Capital in Risk-Sharing: Lessons from Andhra Pradesh|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0973174113504848|journal=Journal of South Asian Development|volume=8|pages=359-383|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inversely, a lack of social capital can impair health. For example, results from a survey given to 13- to 18-year-old students in Sweden showed that low social capital and low social trust are associated with higher rates of psychosomatic symptoms, musculoskeletal pain, and depression.&lt;ref name="Aslund 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aslund | first1 = C. | last2 = Starrin | first2 = B. | last3 = Nilsson | first3 = K. | year = 2010 | title = Social capital in relation to depression, musculoskeletal pain, and psychosomatic symptoms: a cross-sectional study of a large population-based cohort of Swedish adolescents | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/10/715/abstract | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 10 | issue = | page = 715 | doi=10.1186/1471-2458-10-715| pmid = 21092130 | pmc = 3091587 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, negative social capital can detract from health. Although there are only a few studies that assess social capital in criminalized populations, there is information that suggests that social capital does have a negative effect in broken communities. Deviant behavior is encouraged by deviant peers via favorable definitions and learning opportunities provided by network-based norms.&lt;ref name="Sutherland &amp; Cressey, 1978"&gt;Sutherland, Edwin H. and Donald R. Cressey (1978). ''Criminology.'' Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott Company.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in these same communities, an adjustment of norms (i.e. deviant peers being replaced by positive role models) can pose a positive effect.

== Effects of the Internet ==
Similar to watching the news and keeping abreast of current events, the use of the Internet can relate to an individual's level of social capital. In one study, informational uses of the Internet correlated positively with an individual's production of social capital, and social-recreational uses were negatively correlated (higher levels of these uses correlated with lower levels of social capital).&lt;ref name="Shah, Kwak, &amp; Holbert, 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shah | first1 = D. V. | last2 = Kwak | first2 = N. | last3 = Holbert | first3 = R.

He created it after an incident where a lady passed out during a train ride due to the congestion in the train and help was delayed because of the congestion in the train and the inefficiency of the train conductor. His blog exposed the poor conditions of train stations, overcrowding train rides and inefficiency of the train conductor which eventually influenced changes within the transit system.&lt;ref name="Rainie &amp; Wellman, 2012"&gt;Rainie L. &amp; Wellman B. (2012). ''Networked: The New Social Operating System, Chapter 8: Networked Creators.'' Massachusetts Institute of Technology: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Another perspective holds that the rapid growth of social networking sites such as [[Facebook]] and [[Myspace]] suggests that individuals are creating a virtual-network consisting of both bonding and bridging social capital. Unlike face to face interaction, people can instantly connect with others in a targeted fashion by placing specific parameters with internet use. This means that individuals can selectively connect with others based on ascertained interests, and backgrounds. [[Facebook]] is currently the most popular social networking site and touts many advantages to its users including serving as a ''[[social lubricant (disambiguation)|social lubricant]]'' for individuals who otherwise have difficulties forming and maintaining both strong and weak ties with others.&lt;ref name="Steinfield et al., 2006"&gt;Steinfield, C., DiMicco, J. M., Ellison, N. B., &amp; Lampe, C. (2009). "Bowling Online: Social Networking and Social Capital within the Organization." Proceedings of the Fourth Communities and Technologies Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;

This argument continues, although the preponderance of evidence shows a positive association between social capital and the internet. Critics of virtual communities believe that the Internet replaces our strong bonds with online "weak-ties"&lt;ref name="Cummings, Butler, &amp; Kraut, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cummings | first1 = J. | last2 = Butler | first2 = B. | last3 = Kraut | first3 = R. | year = 2002 | title = The quality of online social relationships | url = | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 45 | issue = 7| pages = 103–108 | doi=10.1145/514236.514242}}&lt;/ref&gt; or with socially empty interactions with the technology itself.&lt;ref name="Nie, 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nie | first1 = N.

(1997). ''The individual within the collective : Virtual ideology and the realization of collective principles.'' In S. Jones(Ed.), Virtual culture (pp.36-54). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; A few articles suggest that technologically based interactions has a negative relationship with social capital by displacing time spent engaging in geographical/ in-person social activities.&lt;ref name="Cummings, Butler, &amp; Kraut, 2002" /&gt; However, the consensus of research shows that the more time people spend online the more in-person contact they have, thus positively enhancing social capital.&lt;ref&gt;Boase, Jeffrey and Barry Wellman. 2005.

Recent research, conducted in 2006, also shows that Internet users often have wider networks than those who uses internet irregularly or not at all. When not considering family and work contacts, Internet users actually tend to have contact with a higher number of friends and relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, S. (2006). Do Internet users have more social ties? A call for differentiated analyses of Internet use" ''Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication'' 11(3). article 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by another study that shows that internet users and non-internet users do feel equally close to the same number of people; also the internet users maintain relationships with 20% more people that they "feel somewhat close" to.&lt;ref&gt;Boase, J., Horrigan, J., Wellman, B., &amp; Rainie, L. (2006). The strength of internet ties. Washington, DC: Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research shows that younger people use the Internet as a supplemental medium for communication, rather than letting the Internet communication replace face-to-face contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McPherson | first1 = M. | last2 = Smith-Lovin | first2 = L. | last3 = Brashears | first3 = M. E. | year = 2006 | title = Social isolation in America: Changes in core discussion networks over two decades | url = | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 71 | issue = 3| pages = 353–375 | doi=10.1177/000312240607100301| citeseerx = 10.1.1.101.6700 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This supports the view that Internet communication does not hinder development of social capital and does not make people feel lonelier than before.

Ellison, Steinfield &amp; Lampe (2007) suggest social capital exercised online is a result of relationships formed offline; whereby, bridging capital is enabled through a "maintenance" of relationships. Among respondents of this study, social capital built exclusively online creates weaker ties.&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, N.B., Steinfield, C. &amp; Lampe, C (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction of social bonding is offered by Ellison et al., 2007, suggesting bonds, or strong ties, are possible through social media, but less likely.

== Effects on educational achievement ==
Coleman and Hoffer collected quantitative data of 28,000 students in total 1,015 public, Catholic and other private high schools in America from the 7 years' period from 1980 to 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman and Hoffer (1987) "High School and Beyond"&lt;/ref&gt;  It was found from this longitudinal research that social capital in students' families and communities attributed to the much lower dropout rates in [[Catholic school]]s compared with the higher rates in public.

Teachman et al.&lt;ref&gt;Teachman et al. (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; further develop the family structure indicator suggested by Coleman. They criticise Coleman, who used only the number of parents present in the family, neglected the unseen effect of more discrete dimensions such as stepparents' and different types of single-parent families. They take into account of a detailed counting of family structure, not only with two biological parents or stepparent families, but also with types of single-parent families with each other (mother-only, father-only, never-married, and other). They also contribute to the literature by measuring parent-child interaction by the indicators of how often parents and children discuss school-related activities.

Morgan and Sorensen&lt;ref name="Morgan 1999"&gt;Morgan and Sorensen (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; directly challenge Coleman for his lacking of an explicit mechanism to explain why Catholic schools students perform better than public school students on standardised tests of achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Chen (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Researching students in Catholic schools and public schools again, they propose two comparable models of social capital effect on mathematic learning.  One is on Catholic schools as norm-enforcing schools whereas another is on public schools as horizon-expanding schools. It is found that while social capital can bring about positive effect of maintaining an encompassing functional community in norm-enforcing schools, it also brings about the negative consequence of excessive monitoring. Creativity and exceptional achievement would be repressed as a result. Whereas in horizon expanding school, social closure is found to be negative for student's mathematic achievement. These schools explore a different type of social capital, such as information about opportunities in the extended social networks of parents and other adults.  The consequence is that more learning is fostered than norm-enforcing Catholic school students. In sum, Morgan and Sorensen's (1999) study implies that social capital is contextualised, one kind of social capital may be positive in this setting but is not necessarily still positive in another setting.&lt;ref name="Morgan 1999" /&gt;

In the setting of education through Kilpatrick et al., (2010)&lt;ref&gt;Kilpatrick, S. &amp; Johns, S. &amp; Mulford B. (2010) 'Social capital, educational institutions and leadership', in E. Baker, B. McGraw &amp; P. Peterson (eds), ''The International Encyclopedia of Education'', 3rd edition, Elsevier Science.&lt;/ref&gt; state, '... social capital is a useful lens for analysing lifelong learning and its relationship to community development'. Social capital is particularly important in terms of education. Also the importance of education with '...schools being designed to create "functioning community"- forging tighter links between parents and the school' (Coleman &amp; Hoffer, 1987) linking that without this interaction, the social capital in this area is disadvantaged and demonstrates that social capital plays a major role in education.

Without social capital in the area of education, teachers and parents that play a responsibility in a students learning, the significant impacts on their child's academic learning can rely on these factors. With focus on parents contributing to their child's academic progress as well as being influenced by social capital in education. Without the contribution by the parent in their child's education, gives parents less opportunity and participation in the student's life. As Tedin et al. (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tedin | first1 = Kent L. | last2 = Weiher | first2 = Gregory R. | year = 2011 | title = General Social Capital, Education-Related Social Capital, and Choosing Charter Schools | url = | journal = The Policy Studies Journal | volume = 39 | issue = 4| pages = 609–29 | doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.2011.00424.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; state '...one of the most important factors in promoting student success is the active involvement of parents in a child's education.'' With parents also involved in activities and meetings the school conducts, the more involved parents are with other parents and the staff members. Thus parent involvement contributes to social capital with becoming more involved in the school community and participating makes the school a sustainable and easy to run community.

In their journal article "Beyond social capital: Spatial dynamics of collective efficacy for children", Sampson et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Sampson| year=1999| title=Beyond social capital: Spatial dynamics of collective efficacy for children|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; stress the normative or goal-directed dimension of social capital. They claim, "resources or networks alone (e.g. voluntary associations, friendship ties, organisational density) are neutral--- they may or may not be effective mechanism for achieving intended effect"&lt;ref&gt;Sampson et al., 1999, p.635, quoted by Chen, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Marjoribanks and Kwok&lt;ref&gt;Marjoribanks and Kwok (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a survey in [[Hong Kong]] secondary schools with 387 fourteen-year-old students with an aim to analyse female and male adolescents differential educational achievement by using social capital as the main analytic tool. In that research, social capital is approved of its different effects upon different genders. In his thesis "New Arrival Students in Hong Kong: Adaptation and School Performance", Hei Hang Hayes Tang argues that adaptation is a process of activation and accumulation of (cultural and social) capitals. The research findings show that supportive networks is the key determinant differentiating the divergent adaptation pathways. Supportive networks, as a form of social capital, is necessary for activating the cultural capital the newly arrived students possessed. The amount of accumulated capital is also relevant to further advancement in the ongoing adaptation process.&lt;ref&gt;Hei Hang Hayes Tang (2002) "New Arrival Students in Hong Kong: Adaptation and School Performance"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Min Zhou]] and [[Carl L. Bankston]]&lt;ref&gt;* [[Min Zhou|Zhou, Min]] and [[Carl L. Bankston]] III ''[[Growing Up American]]: How Vietnamese Children Adapt to Life in the United States'' New York: Russell Sage Foundation(1998)&lt;/ref&gt; in their study of a [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] community in New Orleans find that preserving traditional ethnic values enable [[immigrant]]s to integrate socially and to maintain [[social solidarity|solidarity]] in an ethnic community.  Ethnic solidarity is especially important in the context where immigrants just arrive in the host society.  In her article "Social Capital in Chinatown", Zhou examines how the process of adaptation of young [[Chinese American]]s is affected by tangible forms of social relations between the community, immigrant families, and the younger generations.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  Chinatown serves as the basis of social capital that facilitates the accommodation of immigrant children in the expected directions.  Ethnic support provides impetus to academic success.  Furthermore, maintenance of literacy in native language also provides a form of social capital that contributes positively to academic achievement.  Stanton-Salazar and Dornbusch&lt;ref&gt;Stanton-Salazar (1995) (quoted by Wong, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; found that bilingual students were more likely to obtain the necessary forms of institutional support to advance their school performance and their life chances.

Putnam (2000) mentions in his book ''Bowling Alone'', "[[Child development]] is powerfully shaped by social capital" and continues "presence of social capital has been linked to various positive outcomes, particularly in education".&lt;ref&gt;Putnam (2000), p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; According to his book, these positive outcomes are the result of parents' social capital in a community. In states where there is a high social capital, there is also a high education performance.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam (2000), p.300&lt;/ref&gt; The similarity of these states is that parents were more associated with their children's education. Teachers have reported that when the parents participate more in their children's education and school life, it lowers levels of misbehavior, such as bringing weapons to school, engaging in physical violence, unauthorized absence, and being generally apathetic about education.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam (2000), p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; Borrowing Coleman's quotation from Putnam's book, Coleman once mentioned we cannot understate "the importance of the embeddedness of young persons in the enclaves of adults most proximate to them, first and most prominent the family and second, a surrounding community of adults".&lt;ref&gt;Putnam (2000), p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

== In geography ==
In order to understand social capital as a subject in geography, one must look at it in a sense of space, place, and territory.  In its relationship, the tenets{{Who|date=February 2013}} of geography relate to the ideas of social capital in the family, community, and in the use of social networks.  The biggest advocate for seeing social capital as a geographical subject was American economist and political scientist Robert Putnam.  His main argument for classifying social capital as a geographical concept is that the relationships of people is shaped and molded by the areas in which they live.&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

Putnam (1993) argued that the lack of social capital in the South of Italy was more the product of a peculiar historical and geographical development than the consequence of a set of contemporary socio-economic conditions. This idea has sparked a lengthy debate and received fierce criticism (Ferragina, 2010; Ferragina 2012: 3).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emanueleferragina.com/attachments/002_Ferragina%20Tocqueville%20review.pdf Ferragina, E. (2010) Social Capital and Equality: Tocqueville's Legacy. The Toqueville Review, vol. XXXI: 73-98]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YG0ryZmv5bMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Ferragina, E. (2012 p. 3) Social Capital in Europe: A Comparative Regional Analysis. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar |accessdate=2014-04-20|isbn=9781781000229 |last1=Ferragina |first1=Emanuele |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many areas in which social capital can be defined by the theories and practices. [[Anthony Giddens]] developed a theory in 1984 in which he relates social structures and the actions that they produce. In his studies, he does not look at the individual participants of these structures, but how the structures and the social connections that stem from them are diffused over space.&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, p. 196–198&lt;/ref&gt;  If this is the case, the continuous change in social structures could bring about a change in social capital, which can cause changes in community atmosphere. If an area is plagued by social organizations whose goals are to revolt against social norms, such as gangs, it can cause a negative social capital for the area causing those who disagreed with said organizations to relocate thus taking their positive social capital to a different space than the negative.

Another area where social capital can be seen as an area of study in geography is through the analysis of participation in volunteerism and its support of different governments. One area to look into with this is through those who participate in social organizations. People that participate are of different races, ages, and economic status.&lt;ref name="Mohan, p. 197"&gt;Mohan, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; With these in mind, variances of the space in which these different demographics may vary, causing a difference in involvement among areas. Secondly, there are different social programs for different areas based on economic situation.&lt;ref name="Mohan, p. 197" /&gt; A governmental organization would not place a welfare center in a wealthier neighborhood where it would have very limited support to the community, as it is not needed. Thirdly, social capital can be affected by the participation of individuals of a certain area based on the type of institutions that are placed there.&lt;ref name="Mohan, p. 197" /&gt; Mohan supports this with the argument of J. Fox in his paper "Decentralization and Rural Development in Mexico", which states "structures of local governance in turn influence the capacity of grassroots communities to influence social investments."&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; With this theory, if the involvement of a government in specific areas raises the involvement of individuals in social organizations and/or communities, this will in turn raise the social capital for that area. Since every area is different, the government takes that into consideration and will provide different areas with different institutions to fit their needs thus there will be different changes in social capital in different areas.

== In leisure studies ==
In the context of [[leisure studies]], social capital is seen as the consequence of investment in and cultivation of social relationships allowing an individual access to resources that would otherwise be unavailable to him or her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glover | first1 = T. D. | last2 = Shinew | first2 = K.J. | last3 = Perry | first3 = D. | year = 2005 | title = Association, sociability, and civic culture: The democratic effect of community gardening | url = | journal = Leisure Sciences | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 75–92 | doi=10.1080/01490400590886060}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of social capital in relation to [[leisure]] is grounded in a perspective that emphasizes the interconnectedness rather than the separateness of human activity and human goals. There is a significant connection between leisure and democratic social capital.&lt;ref name="Hemingway"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hemingway | first1 = J. L. | year = 1999 | title = Leisure, social capital, and democratic citizenship | url = | journal = Journal of Leisure Research | volume = 31 | issue = 2| pages = 150–165 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific forms of leisure activity contribute to the development of the social capital central to [[democracy]] and democratic citizenship. The more an individual participates in social activities, the more [[autonomy]] the individual experiences, which will help her or his individual abilities and skills to develop. The greater the accumulation of social capital a person experiences, may transfer to other leisure activities as well as personal social roles, relationships and in other roles within a [[social structure]].&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt;

== Negative social capital ==
It has been noted that social capital may not always be used for positive ends.  While pursuing doctoral studies, Lester was the first to create figures and equate negative social capital with negative returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.ibam.com/pubs/jbam/articles/vol15/No1/article%203%20Lester%20et%20al%20after%20assistant%20ed.pdf|title = Family Firms and Negative Social Capital: A Property Rights Theory Approach|last = Lester|first = Monica|date = 2013|journal = Journal of Behavioral &amp; Applied Management|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 25, 2015|last2 = Maheshwari|first2 = Sharad K.|last3 = McLain|first3 = Michael|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208133824/http://www.ibam.com/pubs/jbam/articles/vol15/No1/article%203%20Lester%20et%20al%20after%20assistant%20ed.pdf|archivedate = 8 December 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Lester, negative social capital was a societal ill, not a business one.  An example of the complexities of the effects of negative social capital is violence or criminal [[gang]] activity that is encouraged through the strengthening of intra-group relationships (bonding social capital).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ilan|first=Johnathan|date=Spring 2012|title=Street Social Capital in the Liquid City|journal=Ethnography|volume=14|pages=3–24|doi=10.1177/1466138112440983}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The negative consequences of social capital are more often associated with ''bonding'' vis-à-vis ''bridging''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://my.vanderbilt.edu/perkins/files/2011/09/Perkins_Hughey_Speer-JCDS-33-no1-2002.pdf Perkins, D.D., Hughey, J., &amp; Speer, P.W. (2002). Community psychology perspectives on social capital theory and community development practice. ''Journal of the Community Development Society'', 33 (1), 33-52.] (p. 47)&lt;/ref&gt;

Without "bridging" social capital, "bonding" groups can become isolated and disenfranchised from the rest of society and, most importantly, from groups with which bridging must occur in order to denote an "increase" in social capital.  Bonding social capital is a necessary antecedent for the development of the more powerful form of bridging social capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bolin | first1 = B. | last2 = Hackett | first2 = E.J. | last3 = Harlan | first3 = S.L. | last4 = Kirby | first4 = A. | last5 = Larsen | first5 = L. | last6 = Nelson | first6 = A. | last7 = Rex | first7 = T.R. | last8 = Wolf | first8 =  | year = 2004 | title = Bonding and Bridging: Understanding the Relationship between Social Capital and Civic Action | url = | journal = Journal of Planning Education and Research | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 64–77 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonding and bridging social capital can work together productively if in balance, or they may work against each other. As social capital bonds and stronger homogeneous groups form, the likelihood of bridging social capital is attenuated.  Bonding social capital can also perpetuate sentiments of a certain group, allowing for the bonding of certain individuals together upon a common radical ideal.  The strengthening of insular ties can lead to a variety of effects such as ethnic marginalization or social isolation.  In extreme cases ethnic cleansing may result if the relationship between different groups is so strongly negative. In mild cases, it just isolates certain communities such as suburbs of cities because of the bonding social capital and the fact that people in these communities spend so much time away from places that build bridging social capital.

Social capital (in the institutional [[Robert Putnam]] sense) may also lead to bad outcomes if the political institution and democracy in a specific country is not strong enough and is therefore overpowered by the social capital groups. "Civil society and the collapse of the Weimar Republic" suggests that "it was weak political institutionalization rather than a weak civil society that was Germany's main problem during the Wihelmine and Weimar eras."&lt;ref&gt;Sheri Berman,''World Politics'' 49, 3, April 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Because the political institutions were so weak people looked to other outlets. "Germans threw themselves into their clubs, voluntary associations, and professional organizations out of frustration with the failures of the national government and political parties, thereby helping to undermine the Weimar Republic and facilitate Hitler's rise to power." In this article about the fall of the [[Weimar Republic]], the author makes the claim that Hitler rose to power so quickly because he was able to mobilize the groups towards one common goal. Even though German society was, at the time, a "joining" society these groups were fragmented and their members did not use the skills they learned in their club associations to better their society. They were very introverted in the Weimar Republic. Hitler was able to capitalize on this by uniting these highly bonded groups under the common cause of bringing Germany to the top of world politics. The former world order had been destroyed during World War I, and Hitler believed that Germany had the right and the will to become a dominant global power. Additionally, in his essay "A Criticism of Putnam's Theory of Social Capital",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theapollonianrevolt.com/analysis-social-capital-approach/ |accessdate=6 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419030009/http://theapollonianrevolt.com/analysis-social-capital-approach/ |archivedate=19 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Shindler expands upon Berman's argument that Wiemar social clubs and similar associations in countries that did not develop democracy, were organized in such a way that they fostered a "we" instead of an "I" mentality among their members, by arguing that groups which possess cultures that stress solidarity over individuality, even ones that are "horizontally" structured and which were also common to pre-[[soviet]] [[eastern europe]], will not engender democracy if they are politically aligned with non-democratic ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shindler|first1=Michael|title=A Criticism of Putnam's Theory of Social Capital|url=http://theapollonianrevolt.com/analysis-social-capital-approach/|website=The Apollonian Revolt|publisher=The Apollonian Revolt|accessdate=6 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419030009/http://theapollonianrevolt.com/analysis-social-capital-approach/|archivedate=19 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later work by Putnam also suggests that social capital, and the associated growth of public trust are inhibited by immigration and rising racial [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] in communities.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Robert D. (2006) ''E Pluribus Unim: Diversity and Community in the Twenty-First Century,'' Nordic Political Science Association&lt;/ref&gt; Putnam's study regarding the issue argued that in American areas with a lack of homogeneity, some individuals neither participated in bonding nor bridging social capital. In societies where immigration is high (USA) or where ethnic heterogeneity is high (Eastern Europe), it was found that citizens lacked in both kinds of social capital and were overall far less trusting of others than members of homogenous communities were found to be.  Lack of homogeneity led to people withdrawing from even their closest groups and relationships, creating an atomized society as opposed to a cohesive community. These findings challenge previous beliefs that exposure to diversity strengthens social capital, either through bridging social gaps between ethnicities or strengthening in-group bonds. It is very important for policy makers to monitor the level of perceived socio-economic threat from immigrants because negative attitudes towards immigrants make integration difficult and affect social capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marozzi|first1=Marco|title=Construction, Robustness Assessment and Application of an Index of Perceived Level of Socio-economic Threat from Immigrants: A Study of 47 European Countries and Regions|journal=Social Indicators Research|volume=128|pages=413–437|date=2015|doi=10.1007/s11205-015-1037-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproduction of inequality ===
James Coleman has indicated that social capital eventually led to the creation of human capital for the future generation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Human capital, a private resource, could be accessed through what the previous generation accumulated through social capital.  Field suggested that such a process could lead to the very inequality social capital attempts to resolve.&lt;ref&gt;John Field, 2003. ''Social Capital''&lt;/ref&gt;  While Coleman viewed social capital as a relatively neutral resource, he did not deny the class reproduction that could result from accessing such capital, given that individuals worked toward their own benefit.  Even though Coleman never truly addresses Bourdieu in his discussion, this coincides with Bourdieu's argument set forth in ''Reproduction in Education, Society and Culture''.  Bourdieu and Coleman were fundamentally different at the theoretical level (as Bourdieu believed the actions of individuals were rarely ever conscious, but more so only a result of their habitus (see below) being enacted within a particular field, but this realization by both seems to undeniably connect their understanding of the more latent aspects of social capital.

According to Bourdieu, habitus refers to the social context within which a social actor is socialized.  Thus, it is the social platform, itself, that equips one with the social reality they become accustomed to.  Out of habitus comes field, the manner in which one integrates and displays his or her habitus.  To this end, it is the social exchange and interaction between two or more social actors.  To illustrate this, we assume that an individual wishes to better his place in society.  He therefore accumulates social capital by involving himself in a social network, adhering to the norms of that group, allowing him to later access the resources (e.g. social relationships) gained over time.  If, in the case of education, he uses these resources to better his educational outcomes, thereby enabling him to become socially mobile, he effectively has worked to reiterate and reproduce the stratification of society, as social capital has done little to alleviate the system as a whole.  This may be one negative aspect of social capital, but seems to be an inevitable one in and of itself, as are all forms of capital.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

'''Supremacism''' is an [[ideology]] which holds that a particular class of people is [[superior (hierarchy)|superior]] to others, and that it should dominate, control, and subjugate others, or is entitled to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/supremacist|title=Supremacist|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supposed ''superior'' class of people can be an [[Human development (biology)|age]], [[race (human categorization)|race]] (classification of human beings) [[species]], [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], [[gender]] ([[social construct]]), [[sexuality]], [[language]], [[social class]], [[ideology]], [[nation]], or [[culture]], or any other part of a population.

{{further information|patriarchy|matriarchy|androcentrism|gynecentrism|male privilege}}
Some [[Feminism|feminist]] theorists have argued that in [[patriarchy]], a standard of male supremacism is enforced through a variety of cultural, political, and interpersonal strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Reeves Sanday,  ''Female power and male dominance: on the origins of sexual inequality,'' Cambridge University Press, 1981, [https://books.google.com/books?id=39ScGl-T3J0C&amp;pg=PA6 pp. 6–8], [https://books.google.com/books?id=39ScGl-T3J0C&amp;pg=PA113 113–14], [https://books.google.com/books?id=39ScGl-T3J0C&amp;pg=PA174 174], [https://books.google.com/books?id=39ScGl-T3J0C&amp;pg=PA182 182]. {{ISBN|0-521-28075-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-28075-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 19th century there have been a number of feminist movements opposed to male supremacism, usually aimed at achieving equal legal rights and protections for women in all cultural, political and interpersonal relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= |title=Collins Dictionary and Thesaurus |year=2006 |publisher=Collins |location=London |isbn=0-00-722405-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Humm, Maggie |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Modern feminisms: Political, Literary, Cultural |year=1992 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-231-08072-7 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cornell&gt;{{cite book |author=Cornell, Drucilla |authorlink=Drucilla Cornell|title=At the heart of freedom: feminism, sex, and equality |year=1998 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J. |isbn=978-0-691-02896-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racial==
{{further information|White supremacy|Black supremacy|Arab supremacy|Eurocentrism|Scientific racism|Indocentrism|Sinocentrism|Racism|Racialism|Institutional racism}}
Centuries of European colonialism in the Americas, Africa, Australia, Oceania, and Asia were justified by [[white supremacist]] attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Takashi Fujitani, Geoffrey Miles White, Lisa Yoneyama,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ltm9hv0_4A0C ''Perilous memories: the Asia-Pacific War(s)''], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ltm9hv0_4A0C&amp;pg=PA303 p. 303], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 19th century, the phrase "[[The White Man's Burden]]", referring to the thought that whites have the obligation to make the societies of the other peoples more 'civilized', was widely used to justify imperialist policy as a noble enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Miller, Stuart Creighton| title= Benevolent Assimilation: The American Conquest of the Philippines, 1899–1903 | publisher= Yale University Press | year=1982 | isbn=0-300-03081-9}} p. 5: "...imperialist editors came out in favor of retaining the entire archipelago (using) higher-sounding justifications related to the "white man's burden."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Opinion archive, International Herald Tribune| title=In Our Pages: 100, 75 and 50 Years Ago; 1899: Kipling's Plea | journal=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=February 4, 1999 | volume= | issue= | pages= 6 | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1999/02/04/edold.t_10.php }}: Notes that Rudyard Kipling's new poem, "The White Man's Burden", "is regarded as the strongest argument yet published in favor of expansion."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Carlyle]], known for his historical account of the French Revolution, ''[[The French Revolution: A History]],'' which inspired [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]],'' argued that European supremacist policies were justified on the grounds they provided the greatest benefit to "inferior" native peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cruel.org/econthought/texts/carlyle/carlodnq.html | title=Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even at the time of its publication in 1849, Carlyle's main work on the subject, the ''[[Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question]],'' was received poorly by his contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cruel.org/econthought/texts/carlyle/negroquest.html | title=Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[American Civil War]], the [[Confederate States of America]] was founded with a constitution that contained clauses restricting the government's ability to limit or interfere with the institution of "negro" slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_csa.asp | title=Constitution of the Confederate States | date=March 11, 1861 }}: "No bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law denying or impairing the right of property in negro slaves shall be passed."&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Cornerstone Speech]], Confederate vice president [[Alexander H. Stephens|Alexander Stephens]] declared that one of the Confederacy's foundational tenets was [[white supremacy]] over black slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/cornerstone-speech/ | title="Corner Stone" Speech | author=[[Alexander H. Stephens|Alexander Stephens]] | date=March 21, 1861 }}: "Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its corner- stone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition."&lt;/ref&gt; Following the war, a secret society, the [[Ku Klux Klan]], was formed in the South. Its purpose was to "restore" white supremacy after the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] period, even though there still was white, Protestant supremacy in the United States, at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877,'' Perennial (HarperCollins), 1989, pp. 425–26.&lt;/ref&gt; The group preached supremacy over all other races, as well as supremacy over [[Jews]], [[Catholic]]s, and other minorities.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

[[Cornel West]], an African-American philosopher, writes that [[Black supremacist]] religious views arose in America as part of [[Nation of Islam|black Muslim]] theology in response to [[white supremacism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cornel West]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=p89c2eTJgJgC Race Matters]'', Beacon Press, 1993, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p89c2eTJgJgC&amp;pg=PA99 p. 99]: "The basic aim of [[Nation of Islam|black Muslim]] theology—with its distinct black supremacist account of the origins of white people—was to counter white supremacy."&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 20th century until the end of [[World War II]], known as the pre-1945 [[Shōwa era|''Shōwa'' era]], in Japan, the propaganda of the [[Empire of Japan]] used the old concept of ''[[hakko ichiu]]'' to support the idea that the [[Yamato people|Yamato]] were a superior race, destined to rule Asia and the Pacific. Many documents, such as ''[[Kokutai no Hongi]],'' ''[[Shinmin no Michi]],'' and ''[[An Investigation of Global Policy with the Yamato Race as Nucleus]],'' discussed this concept of Japanese supremacy.

In Africa, black Southern [[Sudan]]ese allege that they are subjected to a racist form of [[Arab supremacy]], which they equate with the historic white supremacism of South African [[apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theworld.org/2011/02/racism-in-sudan/ | title=Racism in Sudan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alleged [[genocide]] in the ongoing [[War in Darfur]] has been described as an example of [[Arab]] [[racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bnaibrith.ca/prdisplay.php?id=605 |title=Welcome To B'nai Brith |publisher=Bnaibrith.ca |date=2004-08-04 |accessdate=2010-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919002351/http://bnaibrith.ca/prdisplay.php?id=605 |archivedate=2010-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Asia, ancient Indians considered all foreigners as [[barbarian]]s. The Muslim scholar [[Al-Biruni]] wrote that the Indians called foreigners impure.&lt;ref name="The First Spring p.313"&gt;''The First Spring: The Golden Age of India'' by Abraham Eraly p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; A few centuries later, Dubois observes that "Hindus look upon Europeans as barbarians totally ignorant of all principles of honour and good breeding... In the eyes of a Hindu, a Pariah ([[Dalit|outcaste]]) and a European are on the same level."&lt;ref name="The First Spring p.313"/&gt; The Chinese viewed the Europeans as repulsive, ghost-like creatures, and even devils. The Chinese writers also referred to the Europeans as barbarians.&lt;ref&gt;''The Haunting Past: Politics, Economics and Race in Caribbean Life'' by Alvin O. Thompson p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
{{main articles|Völkisch movement|White supremacy#Germany}}
From 1933–1945, [[Nazi Germany]], under the rule of [[Adolf Hitler]], promoted the idea of a superior, [[Aryan race|Aryan]] ''[[Herrenvolk]]'', or [[master race]]. The [[Nazi propaganda|state's propaganda]] advocated the belief that [[Germanic peoples]], whom they called "Aryans", were a master race or a ''Herrenvolk'' that was superior to the [[Jews]], [[Slavs]], and [[Romani people]], so-called "gypsies". [[Arthur de Gobineau]], a French racial theorist and aristocrat, blamed the fall of the [[Ancien Régime|ancien régime]] in France on racial intermixing, which he argued had destroyed the purity of the Nordic race. Gobineau's theories, which attracted a strong following in Germany, emphasized the existence of an irreconcilable polarity between Aryan and Jewish cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Blamires, Cyprian; Jackson, Paul. ''World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia:'' Volume 1. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, Inc, 2006. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious==

===Christian===
Some academics and writers claim that [[Christian]] supremacism was a motivation for the [[Crusades]] in the [[Holy Land]], as well as for crusades against [[Muslim]]s and [[pagan]]s throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Lansing, Edward D. English, ''A companion to the medieval world,'' Volume 7, John Wiley and Sons, 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ecpGCF8-XCkC&amp;pg=PA457 p. 457], {{ISBN|1-4051-0922-X}}, 9781405109222&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Atlantic slave trade]] has been attributed in part to Christian supremacism as well.&lt;ref&gt;Mary E. Hunt, Diann L. Neu, ''New Feminist Christianity: Many Voices, Many Views,'' SkyLight Paths Publishing, 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HxU8716h2VgC&amp;pg=PA122 p. 122], {{ISBN|1-59473-285-X}}, 9781594732850&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ku Klux Klan]] has been described as a [[white supremacist]] Christian organization, as are many other white supremacist groups, such as the [[Posse Comitatus (organization)|Posse Comitatus]] and the [[Christian Identity]] and [[Positive Christianity]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;R. Scott Appleby, ''The ambivalence of the sacred: religion, violence, and reconciliation'', Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict series, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8RqbMGvsz5MC&amp;pg=PA103 p. 103], {{ISBN|0-8476-8555-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8476-8555-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = PublicEye.org - The Website of Political Research Associates|url = http://www.publiceye.org/rightwoo/rwooz9-07.html|website = www.publiceye.org|accessdate = 2015-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muslim===
Some academics and writers also allege Muslim or [[Islamic]] supremacism. Others claim that the [[Qur'an]] and other Islamic documents always speak of tolerant, protective beliefs, which have been misused, misquoted, and misinterpreted by both [[Islamic extremists]] and [[Islamophobia|Islamophobes]].&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Cohen, Ian Lague, Khaled Abou El Fadl, ''The place of tolerance in Islam,'' Beacon Press, 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fMCMR68rNxQC&amp;pg=PA23 p. 23], {{ISBN|0-8070-0229-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8070-0229-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of how supremacists have exploited the name of Islam include the Muslim participation in the [[African slave trade]], the early 20th century [[pan-Islamism]] promoted by [[Abdul Hamid II]],&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Jenkins, ''Political Islam in Turkey: running west, heading east?,'' Macmillan, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=c8VtheVUlfgC&amp;pg=PA60 p. 59],  {{ISBN|1-4039-6883-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4039-6883-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[jizya]] and rules of marriage in Muslim countries being imposed on non-Muslims,&lt;ref&gt;Malise Ruthven, ''Islam: a very short introduction,'' Oxford University Press, 1997, Macmillan, 2008 [https://books.google.com/books?ei=IkyMTPbhFsGB8gbVtZjnCg&amp;ct=result&amp;id=BL_rG9gIq64C&amp;dq=Islamic+supremacism&amp;q=Islamic+supremacism#search_anchor p. 117], {{ISBN|0-19-950469-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-950469-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the majority Muslim interpretations of the rules of pluralism in [[Malaysia]], and "defensive" supremacism practiced by some Muslim immigrants in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Bassam Tibi, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1754-9469.2010.01038.x/full Ethnicity of Fear? Islamic Migration and the Ethnicization of Islam in Europe], [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] online, June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers posit that Islam, unlike other religions, positively commands its adherents to impose its [[sharia|religious law]] on all peoples, believers and unbelievers alike, whenever possible and by any means necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Jewish===
Some academics and writers allege [[Judaism|Jewish]] supremacism, often in relation to [[Israel]] and [[Zionism]]. Author Minna Rozen writes that 17th century Jews who lived in Jerusalem were supremacist in their views that they were superior over other Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Minna Rozen, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Pt50fMlgKuMC&amp; Jewish identity and society in the seventeenth century: reflections on the life and work of Refael Mordekhai Malki],''  Mohr Siebeck, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Pt50fMlgKuMC&amp;pg=PA129 129], 1992 {{ISBN|3-16-145770-6}}, {{ISBN|978-3-16-145770-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ilan Pappé]], an Israeli historian, writes that the [[First Aliyah]] to Israel "established a society based on Jewish supremacy."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ilan Pappé]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=JzfgvSiUt9QC The Israel/Palestine question], [https://books.google.com/books?id=JzfgvSiUt9QC&amp;pg=PA89 89], 1999 {{ISBN|0-415-16947-X}}, 9780415169479&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Massad]], a Professor of Arab Studies, holds that "Jewish supremacism" always has been a "dominating principle" in religious and secular Zionism.&lt;ref&gt;David Hirsch, [http://www.yale.edu/yiisa/workingpaper/hirsh/David%20Hirsh%20YIISA%20Working%20Paper1.pdf Anti-Zionism and Antisemitism: Cosmopolitan Reflections] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011202833/http://www.yale.edu/yiisa/workingpaper/hirsh/David%20Hirsh%20YIISA%20Working%20Paper1.pdf |date=2008-10-11 }}, The Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Antisemitism Working Paper Series; discussion of [[Joseph Massad]]'s "The Ends of Zionism: Racism and the Palestinian Struggle", Interventions, Volume 5, Number 3, 2003, 440–51, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Joseph Massad]]'s [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/mealac/faculty/massad/ "Response to the Ad Hoc Grievance Committee Report1"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913023411/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/mealac/faculty/massad/ |date=2006-09-13 }} on his [[Columbia University]] web site during a 2002 rally he said "Israeli Jews will continue to feel threatened if they persist in supporting Jewish supremacy." Massad notes there that others have misquoted him as saying Israel was a "Jewish supremacist and racist state."  See for example David Horowitz, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CYqZjtVp00AC&amp; The professors: the 101 most dangerous academics in America],'' Regnery Publishing, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CYqZjtVp00AC&amp;pg=PA271 271], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Defamation League]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Duke: Ideology|url=http://archive.adl.org/learn/ext_us/david_duke/ideology.html|website=ADL.org|publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Southern Poverty Law Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Renaissance|url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/groups/american-renaissance|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; condemn writings about "Jewish Supremacism" by [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust-denier]], former [[Grand Wizard]] of the KKK, and [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorist]], [[David Duke]], as [[antisemitic]] – in particular, his book: ''[[Jewish Supremacism: My Awakening to the Jewish Question]].''&lt;ref&gt;Duke, David.

"'''Tea Peter'''" is the twenty-first episode of the [[Family Guy (season 10)|tenth season]] of the [[animated television series]] ''[[Family Guy]]''. The episode originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the [[United States]] on May 13, 2012. In this episode, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] joins the [[Tea Party movement]] and, along with his father-in-law, [[Carter Pewterschmidt|Carter]], successfully shuts down the government. However, things do not turn out as expected, and Peter has to find out a way to make things the way they were.

The episode was written by [[Patrick Meighan (writer)|Patrick Meighan]] and directed by [[Pete Michels]]. It received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and cultural references. It was viewed by 4.94 million viewers, according to [[Nielsen ratings]]. The episode features guest performances from [[Kirker Butler]], Chris Cox, [[Ralph Garman]], [[Ari Graynor]], [[Alexa Ray Joel]], [[Christine Lakin]], [[Tara Strong]], [[Nicole Sullivan]], Julius Sharpe, and [[Fred Tatasciore]], along with several guest performers for the series.

==Plot==
At the grand re-opening of Goldman's Pharmacy, Peter finds a "come in, we're open" sign on the front door, and decides to buy one. After people mistake the sign as a business, Peter decides to go into business for himself. The business, however, becomes short-lived when Joe is forced to shut him down for having an unlicensed business. After fighting City Hall and losing, Peter finds a sympathetic ear in Quagmire when they see a news report about the Tea Party and decide to join, much to the dismay of Brian, who informs him that the [[Tea Party Movement|Tea Party]] is really a tool of big business. Joe tags along with Peter and Quagmire to a rally where Peter's father-in-law, Carter, is posing as an everyday worker named "[[Joe the Plumber|Joe Workingman]]". Following the rally, Peter stops inside to use the restroom, where he finds Carter. Although he manages to persuade Peter that the two are separate, Carter enlists Peter to help get rid of the government. Despite the family's resistance, Peter makes calls for Carter on behalf of the Tea Party and successfully campaigns to have [[Mayor West]] shut down Quahog's government. The citizens of Quahog celebrate their new [[Stateless society|freedom from government]], getting away with many things. From Quagmire marrying and impregnating a giraffe and flatly telling that the giraffe's son is not his, to Chris overdosing on [[Mescaline]] and going to Las Vegas. However, Brian makes the Griffins aware of Carter's pollution, and as time goes on things get [[Anarchy|worse]], up to the point where basic services (such as electricity and plumbing) are completely inaccessible and the citizens start rioting in the streets. After visiting Carter to help him and getting turned down by him, Peter calls the town together. He delivers a heartfelt speech about the government, although he manages to present it as an "[[Social cycle theory|entirely new thing]]". After convincing the citizens to successfully reform the government, Peter looks on the Internet to see what people are saying about him, only to be disappointed by the result.

==Reception==
In its original broadcast on May 13, 2012, "Tea Peter" was watched by 4.94 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings, despite airing simultaneously with  ''[[Celebrity Apprentice]]'' on [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] and the series finale of ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].&lt;ref name= "tvnum"/&gt; It also acquired a 2.4/6 rating in the 18–49 demographic group, losing to ''Desperate Housewives'' but beating ''Celebrity Apprentice''.&lt;ref name= "tvnum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/05/15/sunday-final-ratings-once-upon-a-time-family-guy-survivor-adjusted-up-survivor-reunion-dateline-adjusted-down/134077/|title=Sunday Final Ratings: 'Once Upon A Time', Family guy', 'Survivor' Adjusted Up; 'Survivor: Reunion', 'Dateline' Adjusted Down|last=Bibel|first=Sarah|date=May 15, 2012|work=TV by the Numbers|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratings fell from the previous episode, "[[Leggo My Meg-O]]".&lt;ref name= "tvnum2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/05/08/sunday-final-ratings-simpsons-amazing-race-finale-harrys-law-adjusted-up-desperate-housewives-nyc-22-adjusted-down/132865/|title=Sunday Final Ratings: 'Simpsons', 'Amazing Race' Finale, 'Harry's Law' Adjusted Up; 'Desperate Housewives', 'NYC 22' Adjusted Down|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|publisher=TV by the Numbers|date=May 8, 2012|accessdate=June 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode received mixed reviews. Kevin McFarland of ''[[The A.V.

He continued, "I didn't buy that final step, but it was the only bit of irony in the entire plot, and I appreciate whenever ''Family Guy'' goes for satire with a bit of meaning instead of shouting distilled vitriol for its perceived opponents from a soapbox."&lt;ref name= "avclub"/&gt; Carter Doston of TV Fanatic gave a 2.7/5 rating.&lt;ref name= "tvfanatic"&gt;{{cite web|title= Family Guy Review: A Spot of Tea, Old Chap?|url=https://www.tvfanatic.com/2012/05/family-guy-review-a-spot-of-tea-old-chap/|work= TV Fanatic|author= Doston, Carter|date= May 14, 2012|accessdate= June 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He criticized the lack of comedy used, "Seth MacFarlane is a noted liberal, and the politics of the show follow the same track, so an episode mocking the rise of this provocative conservative political movement was inevitable. The problem is that the show forgot to make it funny."&lt;ref name= "tvfanatic"/&gt; He also said "this episode did nothing more than state the obvious, and in a way that was neither profound nor at the very least entertaining."&lt;ref name= "tvfanatic"/&gt;

==Overview==
The project, launched in March 2012, operates at the [[Ezri Center for Iran and Persian Gulf Studies]] at the [[University of Haifa]]. TeHTel includes a [[Persian language|Persian]] website, and profiles on international and Persian-language [[social network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Aviv | last=Mizrahi | url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4202438,00.html | script-title=he:TeHTel: לקרוא את דפני ליף בפרסית | publisher=[[Ynet]] | date=17 March 2012 | accessdate=18 November 2014 |language=Hebrew |trans-title=TehTel: reading Daphni Leef in Farsi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project's website received millions of pageviews, its articles are quoted and copied by major Iranian media channels and websites, and Iranian users posted tens of thousands of comments in Persian in response to content published by the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Yoni | last=Shadmi |url=http://theliberal.co.il/%D7%9C%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8-%D7%A2%D7%9D-%D7%94%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D/|script-title=he:לדבר עם האיראנים | publisher=Liberal Magazine | website=theliberal.co.il | location=Israel | date=17 August 2015 | accessdate=18 November 2014 | language=Hebrew |trans-title=Speaking with the Iranians }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The project's staff keep in daily contact with Iranian citizens.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

==Project description==
TeHTel created a network of hundreds of Israeli content partners, including major Israeli media organizations and independent bloggers and photographers. The project's editors pick different articles originally published in Hebrew by the content partners, translate the selected articles to Persian, and publish the translated content in Persian-language websites and social networks. 

The translated content serves as a basis for dialogue between Israeli and Iranian citizens, as well as internal Iranian discussions. The project publishes articles in a variety of topics, from everyday life in Israel, through culture and politics, to economics and Middle Eastern issues. According to the University of Haifa, the project is careful to avoid propaganda and public relations articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Gal | last=Mor |url=http://www.holesinthenet.co.il/holesinthenet-media-story-2311|script-title=he:טהראן-חיפה-תל אביב: האתר הישראלי ששובר את מחסום האיבה | work=www.holesinthenet.co.il | location=Israel | publisher=Holes in the Net |date=1 June 2013 |accessdate=18 November 2014 |language=Hebrew |trans-title=Tehran – Haifa – Tel Aviv: the Israeli website that breaks the hatred barrier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the project deals with sensitive issues, such as tensions in Israel between Sephardi and Ashkenazi Jews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=Avraham | url=http://b.walla.co.il/item/2718608|script-title=he:"השד העדתי" של אמנון לוי הפכה ללהיט אנטי-ישראלי באיראן | publisher=[[Walla!

Israeli articles published by TeHTel are frequently copied and quoted by online Iranian media, such as [[Raja News]] and [[YJC (Iran)|YJC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Israeli female soldiers on duty | url=http://www.yjc.ir/fa/news/4076864/%D8%AF%D9%87-%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%B9%DA%A9%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%DB%8C%D9%84%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%AE%D8%AA%D8%B1-%D9%87%D9%86%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%88%D8%B8%DB%8C%D9%81%D9%87 | website=www.yjc.ir | location=Iran | publisher=YJC | accessdate=18 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a website affiliated with the conservative [[Revolutionary Guard Corps]].
The project's staff regularly communicates with thousands of Iranian citizens. Users speak about their lives and political ideas, and sometimes share intimate details about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Dudi | last=Cohen | url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4220113,00.html | script-title=he:איראנים בפורום ישראלי: "רוצים להגיע לישראל | publisher=[[Ynet]] | date=24 April 2012 |accessdate=18 November 2014 |language=Hebrew |trans-title=Iranians in an Israeli Forum: we want to come to Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Dudi | last=Cohen | url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4267496,00.html | script-title=he:איראני רצה להתאבד, וזכה לחיבוק מישראלים | publisher=[[Ynet]] | date=24 April 2012 | accessdate=18 November 2014 | language=Hebrew |trans-title=An Iranian Citizen wanted to commit suicide, and received help from Israelis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From time to time, the project creates joint Iranian-Israeli activities. 

The project also promotes and markets content created by Iranians to Israeli audiences. The project publishes [http://tehtel.com/%D9%85%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA-1323-%D8%B3%D9%81%D8%B1-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86.aspx Hebrew translations] of articles by Iranian bloggers, including photographic journeys in Iran. In addition, the project publishes Iranian content in Israeli media venues. Through the project, Iranians published articles in prominent Israeli newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Mansouryar | first1=Mohammad | last2=Shadmi | first2=Yoni | title=Skyping beyond governments | url=http://www.tehtel.com/%D9%85%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%87-1103,75-%D9%85%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%87-%D9%85%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%B1%DA%A9-%D8%B5%D9%84%D8%AD-%D8%A2%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%B2-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-%D9%88-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%DB%8C%D9%84%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A8%D8%B2%D8%B1%DA%AF-%D8%AA%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B2%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%DB%8C%D9%84.aspx | publisher=Yedioth Ahronoth, as published by TeHTel | accessdate=18 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another case, the project's staff translated to Hebrew a video clip shot in Tehran by a local Iranian studio, and helped the clip reach Israeli mainstream audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=What Iranians really want: A unique glimpse in honor of the Persian New Year | first1=Kenan | last1=Ido | first2=Jonny | last2=Silver | url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/.premium-1.584789 | newspaper=Haaretz | date=11 February 2014 | accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iranian response to TeHTel==
A month after TeHTels launched, the Iranian senior official [[Mohsen Rezaee]] denounced the project. Rezaee is the former commander of the [[Iranian Revolutionary Guard]] corps, a candidate in the Iranian presidential elections, and the current secretary of the [[Expediency Discernment Council]]. 
Rezaee claimed that the project is "a new espionage tool of the Israeli regime," adding that "although the project's editors claim that the site is designed to create friendships between the two peoples, it seems that the main purpose is to create a new espionage and intelligence gathering technique against Iran". Following Rezaee, a number of sites associated with high ranking Iranian government officials denounced the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Dudi | last=Cohen | url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4216888,00.html | script-title=he:בכיר איראני נגד אתר ישראלי: "כלי ריגול חדש | publisher=[[Ynet]] | date=17 April 2012 |accessdate=18 November 2014 | language=Hebrew |trans-title=A senior Israeli official attacks an Israeli web site: "a new tool for espionage" }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In response to Rezaee, the project's staff published an open letter, calling for dialogue.

A month after the incident, a group named "the cyber fighters and officers of [[Kerman Province]]", a group of Iranian hackers affiliated with conservative elements, published a harsh condemnation of the project. In the same month, the project was attacked by Iranian hackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Globes service |url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000745170| script-title=he:האקרים איראניים תקפו את אתר ההידברות הישראלי-איראני",  | publisher=[[Globes]] |date=1 May 2012 |accessdate=18 November 2014 |language=Hebrew |trans-title=Iranian Hackers attacked the Israeli-Iranian dialogue website"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Why Have I Taken Up the Struggle Against Bolshevism'''" ({{lang-ru|«Почему я стал на путь борьбы с большевизмом»}}) is a two-page [[open letter]] by the Russian [[lieutenant general]] and the commander of the [[Russian Liberation Army]] [[Andrey Vlasov]]. After the twenty-three years' service in the Soviet military,&lt;ref name="Andreyev 1989 23"&gt;{{harvnb|Andreyev|1989|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vlasov changed the allegiance during World War II to [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborate with Nazi Germany]]. According to [[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]], Vlasov was outraged when [[Joseph Stalin]] denied him permission to retreat in time from an unavoidable [[encirclement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Service | first =Robert | title =A History of Modern Russia from Nicholas II to Vladimir Putin| publisher =Harvard University Press | year =2005 | page =277 | isbn =067401801X}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[2nd Shock Army]]. In June 1942 Vlasov refused to be airlifted for evacuation to the [[Rear (military)|rear]] and chose to stay with his men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://his.1september.ru/2005/03/32.htm| script-title=ru:Предатель или порядочный солдат? |publisher =журнал "История"|author=Кирилл Александров|language=Russian| accessdate = 27 Feb 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having been captured by the Germans in the same month, Vlasov published his open letter in the newspaper ''Zarya'' on March 3, 1943. For his speeches about future independent Russia Vlasov was placed by Germans under [[house arrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.istpravda.ru/research/7659/| script-title=ru:Генерал Власов: "Почему я стал на путь борьбы с большевизмом?"|publisher =Историческая правда|language=Russian| accessdate =27 Feb 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Vlasov was drafted into the [[Red Army]] in 1919. Having attended an infantry tactics course, he became a battalion commander. In 1930 Vlasov became a tactics instructor. Several years later Vlasov was entrusted with command of the 11th Infantry Regiment, that shortly afterwards was officially recognized as the best in the [[Kiev Military District]].&lt;ref name="Andreyev 1989 21"&gt;{{harvnb|Andreyev|1989|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939 Vlasov became the chief military adviser to [[Chiang Kai-shek]], who awarded Vlasov the [[Golden Order of the Dragon]].&lt;ref name="Andreyev 1989 21"/&gt; Upon his return to the Soviet Union, Vlasov was appointed the commander of the 99th Infantry Division, which he retrained and reformed, bringing it out of disarray. For this work Vlasov received the [[Order of Lenin]] and a gold watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andreyev|1989|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, Vlasov failed to defend [[Kiev]], but successfully recaptured [[Solnechnogorsk]] and [[Volokolamsk]] from Germans. In that period, American journalist [[Larry LeSueur]], who interviewed Vlasov, and the French journalist [[Ève Curie]] both mentioned Vlasov's popularity among soldiers.&lt;ref name="Andreyev 1989 23"/&gt; 
 
==Contents==
Vlasov begins his letter with the commitment to "give an honest answer" to the question, why he "is stepping up against [[Bolshevism]]".&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://generalvlasov.ru/documents/otkritoe-pismo-vlasova.html| script-title=ru:Почему я стал на путь борьбы с большевизмом? |publisher =General Vlasov.ru|language=Russian| accessdate = 27 Feb 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vlasov explains, that he fought in the ranks of the Soviet army because he believed that "[[October Revolution|the revolution]] would give the Russian people land, freedom and happiness", but he "realized that the victory of the Bolsheviks had brought the Russian people none of the things it had fought for during the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] years".&lt;ref name="letter"/&gt; Criticizing Stalin, Vlasov expresses his opposition to [[collectivization]], [[political commissar]]s and the [[Great Purge#Purge of the army|purge of the Soviet army command]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="letter"/&gt; In Vlasov's opinion, "Bolshevism has fenced off the Russian people from Europe by an impenetrable wall".&lt;ref name="letter"/&gt; As the commander of the defeated [[2nd Shock Army]], Vlasov wrote that "perhaps nowhere else did the Stalin's disregard for the life of the Russian people manifest itself as much, as in the practice of the 2nd Shock Army".&lt;ref name="letter"/&gt; According to Vlasov, "the soldiers and commanders received 100 or even 50 grams of rusks a day, swelled up from hunger and many became incapable of moving through the swamps to which they had been sent on the direct orders of the high command".&lt;ref name="letter"/&gt; "With a full sense of responsibility to the motherland, the people and history for the actions" he commits, Vlasov calls people to fight and "build a new Russia".&lt;ref name="letter"/&gt; The letter emphasizes several points in bolded font and ends with the belief, that the Russian people "will find the strength to unite in the time of severe calamities, overthrow the hateful yoke and build a new state in which they will find happiness".&lt;ref name="letter"/&gt;

'''William Warder Norton''' (September 17, 1891 &amp;ndash; November 7, 1945) was a publisher and co-founder of [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]].

==Biography==
He grew up in [[Columbus, Ohio]], moved to [[New York City]] and started an import-export business, met and married [[Margaret Dows Herter]], known as Polly or Mary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwnorton.com/area4/about.htm |title=About W. W. Norton |accessdate=2007-08-26 |quote=The roots of the company date back to 1923, when William Warder Norton and his wife, [[Mary D. Herter Norton]], began publishing lectures delivered at the [[People's Institute]], the adult education division of New York City's [[Cooper Union]]. The Nortons soon expanded their program beyond the Institute, acquiring manuscripts by celebrated academics from America and abroad. |publisher=[[W.W. Norton]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, they began publishing lectures delivered at the [[People's Institute]], the adult education division of New York City's [[Cooper Union]]. William and Margaret had a daughter, Anne Aston Warder Norton (1928-1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Anne Aston Warder Warder Norton Jones Dead at 48. Was a Volunteer in Social Work and a Civil Rights Activist. |quote=Anne Aston Warder Norton Jones, daughter of the late William Warder Norton, founder and head of W.W. Norton Company, book publishers, went missing for four days and was found dead in her car in a park near her mother's home on March 5th, 1977, in [[Wilton, Connecticut]]. She was 48 years old and lived in Riverdale, the Bronx. She was survived by four children. |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=March 9, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nortons soon expanded their program beyond the Institute, acquiring manuscripts by celebrated academics from America and abroad. This is the beginning of W. W. Norton &amp; Company. Starting in 1942 he was very active with the [[Council on Books in Wartime]]. It was that council, which was a consortium of publishers, that agreed to an equitable distribution of paper and binding materials, all these scarce materials that went into the manufacture of books. He died at 54, just four months after [[Victory in Europe Day|V-E Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=W. W. Norton Dead. Book Publisher, 54.

His home was at 1 [[Lexington Avenue]]. |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=November 9, 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;
