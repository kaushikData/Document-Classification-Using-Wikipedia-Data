'''21900 Orus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊr|ə|s}} {{Respell|OHR|əs}}), provisional designation ''{{mp|1999 VQ|10}}'', is a [[Jupiter trojan]] from the [[Greek camp]], approximately {{convert|53|km|mi|abbr=off|sigfig=2|sp=us}} in diameter, and a target of the [[Lucy (spacecraft)|''Lucy'' mission]] to be visited in November 2028.&lt;ref name="Levison-2017" /&gt; The dark Jovian [[asteroid]] belongs to the [[#Largest Jupiter trojans|100 largest Jupiter trojans]] and has a [[rotation period]] of 13.5 hours.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt; It was discovered on 9 November 1999, by Japanese amateur astronomer [[Takao Kobayashi]] at his private [[Ōizumi Observatory]] in Gunma Prefecture, Japan, and later named after the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]] warrior [[Orus (disambiguation)|Orus]] from Greek mythology.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

''Orus'' is a dark Jovian [[asteroid]] orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's {{L4}} [[Lagrangian point]], 60[[degree (angle)|°]] ahead of the Gas Giant's orbit in a [[Orbital resonance|1:1 resonance]] {{cross reference|(see [[Trojans in astronomy]])}}. It is also a non-[[Asteroid family|family]] asteroid in the [[background asteroid|Jovian background population]].&lt;ref name="AstDys-object" /&gt;

It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.9–5.3&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 11 years and 7 months (4,240 days; [[semi-major axis]] of 5.13&amp;nbsp;AU). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.04 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 8[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; The body's [[observation arc]] begins with a [[precovery]], published by the [[Digitized Sky Survey]] and taken at [[Palomar Observatory]] in November 1951, or 48 years prior to its official discovery observation.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

== ''Lucy'' mission target ==

''Orus'' is planned to be visited by the [[Lucy (spacecraft)|''Lucy'' spacecraft]] which will launch in 2021. The fly by is scheduled for 20 November 2028, and will approach the asteroid to a distance of 1000 kilometers at a velocity of 7.1 kilometers per second.&lt;ref name="Levison-2017" /&gt; The mission's targets with their flyby dates are:&lt;ref name="Levison-2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2017/pdf/2025.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[52246 Donaldjohanson]] — 20 April 2025: 4&amp;nbsp;km diameter C-type asteroid in the inner main-belt, member of ~130Myr old Erigone family;
* [[3548 Eurybates]] — 12 August 2027: 64&amp;nbsp;km diameter C-type Jupiter Trojan in the Greek camp at {{L4}}, largest member of the only confirmed disruptive collisional family in the Trojans;
* [[15094 Polymele]] — 15 September 2027: 21&amp;nbsp;km diameter P-type Trojan at {{L4|nolink=yes}}, likely collisional fragment;
* [[11351 Leucus]] — 18 April 2028: 34&amp;nbsp;km diameter D-type [[List of slow rotators (minor planets)|slow rotator]] Trojan at {{L4|nolink=yes}};
* '''{{mp|21900 Orus}}''' — 11 November 2028: 51&amp;nbsp;km diameter D-type Trojan at {{L4|nolink=yes}}; 
* [[617 Patroclus]] — 2 March 2033: P-type [[binary asteroid|binary]] Trojan. The primary, Patroclus, has a mean diameter of 113&amp;nbsp;km and its companion, Menoetius, has a diameter of 104&amp;nbsp;km. The pair orbit at a separation of 680&amp;nbsp;km. The binary resides in the [[Trojan camp]] at {{L5}}.

== Physical characteristics ==

''Orus'' is characterized as a [[D-type asteroid|D-type]] and [[C-type asteroid]] by the ''Lucy'' mission team and by [[PanSTARRS]] photometric survey, respectively.&lt;ref name="Levison-2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Veres-2015" /&gt; It has a [[Asteroid color indices|V–I]] color index of 0.95, seem among most larger D-type Jupiter trojans.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

The first photometric observations of ''Orus'' have been made in October 2009, by astronomer [[Stefano Mottola]] in a photometric [[lightcurve]] survey of 80 Jupiter trojans, using the 1.2-meter telescope at [[Calar Alto Observatory]]. The obtained rotational lightcurve rendered a [[rotation period|period]] of {{val|13.45|0.08}} hours with a brightness variation of 0.18 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=2]]}}).&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mottola-2011" /&gt;

In 2016, Mottola published a revised rotation period of {{val|13.48617|0.00007|ul=h}}, from ground-based observations taken over five apparitions in support of the ''Lucy'' mission. He finds that Orus is a retrograde rotator. The lightcurve suggests the presence of a large crater in the proximity of its north pole.&lt;ref name="Mottola-2016" /&gt;

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese [[Akari (satellite)|Akari]] satellite and the [[NEOWISE]] mission of NASA's [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]], the body has an [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] of 0.083 and 0.075, with a diameter of 53.87 and 50.81 kilometers, respectively.&lt;ref name="Grav-2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AKARI" /&gt; The ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous C-type asteroids of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 55.67 kilometers with an [[absolute magnitude]] of 10.0.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

{{Largest Jupiter trojans}}

== Naming ==

This [[minor planet]] was named from [[Greek mythology]] after Orus, an [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]] warrior in Homer's ''[[Iliad]]''. He was killed in the [[Trojan War]] by the Trojan prince [[Hector]], after whom the largest Jupiter trojan [[624 Hektor]] is named.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; The approved naming citation was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 22 February 2016 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 98711}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

'''''9 Circles''''' is a [[play (theatre)|play]] by [[Bill Cain]] based on the military career and subsequent civilian trial of murderer [[Steven Dale Green]].&lt;ref name=AmericaMagazine9Circles/&gt;&lt;ref name=ChicagoTribune2013-09-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=DenverPost2012-01-19/&gt;&lt;ref name=ChicagoNow2013-09-07/&gt;&lt;ref name=ToonariPost2013-03-20/&gt;&lt;ref name=MDTheatreGuide2013-02-13/&gt;&lt;ref name=DCTheatreScene2013-02-13/&gt;&lt;ref name=Westword/&gt;&lt;ref name=Boston/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wapo2013-02-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nytimes2017-02-17/&gt;&lt;ref name=TimeSquare2017-03-17/&gt;

Cain is a [[Jesuit priest]].&lt;ref name=AmericaMagazine9Circles/&gt;&lt;ref name=ChicagoTribune2013-09-18/&gt; The play's title refers to [[Dante Alighieri]]'s [[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]—in which Dante navigates a descent into the "nine circles of hell". In Cain's play, Green passes through his discharge from the Army and various judicial and administrative procedures, roughly paralleling the nine circles of Dante's ''Inferno''.  Cain structured the play so other cast members would return to play multiple characters, at each different circle.

The play won praise for being nuanced, and not taking the easy path of demonizing the protagonist.&lt;ref name=AmericaMagazine9Circles/&gt;&lt;ref name=ChicagoTribune2013-09-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=DenverPost2012-01-19/&gt;&lt;ref name=ChicagoNow2013-09-07/&gt;&lt;ref name=ToonariPost2013-03-20/&gt;&lt;ref name=MDTheatreGuide2013-02-13/&gt;&lt;ref name=DCTheatreScene2013-02-13/&gt;&lt;ref name=Westword/&gt;&lt;ref name=Boston/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wapo2013-02-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nytimes2017-02-17/&gt;&lt;ref name=TimeSquare2017-03-17/&gt;  However, [[Chris Jones (reviewer)|Chris Jones]], reviewing a [[Chicago]] production of the play, reported that audience members concluded the play meant to imply that Green, who was originally from [[Midland, Texas]], which had been [[United States President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s primary home, had the assistance of the President himself in clearing his entry into the Army in spite of his criminal record.&lt;ref name=ChicagoTribune2013-09-18/&gt;

The play is receiving its Texas premiere in San Antonio, Texas with The Surround Project's production in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesurroundproject.com|title=(no title) |website=www.thesurroundproject.com |language=en-US |access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The script won the [[Steinberg Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/news/local/door-co/entertainment/2018/02/12/third-avenue-playhouse-opens-winter-play-reading-festival/331652002/ Third Avenue Playhouse opens Winter Play Reading Festival]&lt;/ref&gt;  Cain is the only playwright to have two plays win this award two years in a row.

| quote       = Jesuit playwright Bill Cain S.J., has penned a new and searingly powerful play. Just a year after his earlier successful play about the gun powder plot, Equivocation (see my review), Cain portrays in his new play, 9 Circles, a character, Daniel Reeves, as a disturbed 19-year-old snarled in the web of war. Cain's drama mirrors, through a fictional adaptation, the 2006 Iraq slayings and, subsequent, gang rape of a 14-year-old girl by United States troops. Like the real life Pvt. Steven Dale Green who, partially, serves as the prototype for Cain's Reeves and now awaits life prison without parole for his war crime, the fictional Reeves displays an 'anti-social personality disorder'.

| quote       = Or maybe that should be what a man can do to a war. "9 Circles" revolves around a central character, Private Daniel Reeves (Andrew Goetten), who already has been in plenty of trouble before he walks into the office of a recruiting officer looking for soldiers to go to Iraq. Cain's point, surely, is that Daniel, who goes on to commit horrible crimes that appall even the judicial system set up to process and try him, is precisely the wrong kind of man to be allowed to carry military-grade weaponry. The stresses of war, the play argues, could send anyone over the edge. When starting with a guy wound tight enough to burst his own blood-vessels, the smart leader would anticipate trouble.

| quote       = "9 Circles" is based on the infamous case of former 101st Airborne Division Pfc. Steven Dale Green, convicted in a federal court in 2009 of raping and killing an Iraqi 14-year-old girl and murdering her family. (Green's sentence, life in prison, was different than that of Reeves in the play.)

| quote       = Playwright Bill Cain’s story is set in 2006 Iraq but it could as easily be 2013 Syria.  The play’s underlying questions of ‘what is the USA doing? And why?’ are timely to today’s government debates.  Cain plots a soldier’s persecution for horrific war crimes as the 9 circles of Dante’s “Inferno.”  A troubled nineteen year old is recruited by the military.  His stint is marred by extracurricular war activities.  Now, he is the focal point for the rage of the nationS.  He is *the* enemy, both foreign and domestic.

| quote       = From that point on, Reeves is on a downward spiral. He ends up in jail, accused of raping a 14-year old Iraqi girl and killing her along with her entire family. As he waits for a judge to decide his fate, he encounters various people who allegedly want to help him, from an enigmatic army lawyer (William Bolz) to a pastor with a penchant for internet porn (Whitney Derendinger). In a way, they play the role of Virgil to Reeves’ Dante, and each one of them helps guide Reeves along the path to self-discovery.

| quote       = I was ambivalent about seeing Curious Theatre's regional premiere of Bill Cain's 9 Circles, whose plot tracks very closely with Green's known actions and experiences. &lt;!-- Publicity implied the play would involve some kind of revelatory understanding on the part of the protagonist, here called Daniel Reeves, perhaps even his redemption — though no one actually used this word. It was an idea I fiercely resisted: Green's crime seemed beyond redemption. And all the usual explanations offered in these circumstances — the fog of war; the insanity caused by witnessing the death of fellow soldiers; a government that sends impoverished and sometimes unstable young men into battle; endless television propaganda about a clash of civilizations between Christianity and Islam (propaganda that both the real life Green and the fictive Reeves believed); the methods by which the Army turns recruits into killers, in part by convincing them that the enemy is subhuman — all of these faltered in the face of its viciousness and enormity. I kept remembering the dying Nazi who begged Simon Wiesenthal, as a representative of the Jewish faith, to forgive him. Only the dead could grant such forgiveness, Wiesenthal said. Or perhaps in Green's case, only Abeer's little brothers, who came home from school to a scene of blood and fire. --&gt;

'''A Shaded View on Fashion Film (ASVOFF)''' is the first annual festival in the world about fashion films.

Created by journalist Diane Pernet and launched in September 2008 as a three-day event at the national museum of Paris, Jeu de Paume, ASVOFF which took the form of a full festival showcasing feature films, documentaries, conferences, performances and installations. Pioneering, having brought together names such as [[Mike Figgis]], [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]], [[Erwin Olaf]], [[Nobuyoshi Araki]], [[WIng Shya]], [[Steven Klein (photographer)|Steven Klein]], [[Chris Cunningham]], [[Chloë Sevigny]], Ruth Hogben, Georgie Greville, Elisha Smith-Leverock, Waris Ahluwalla, Maison [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Nick Knight (photographer)|Nick Knight]], [[Johan Renck]], [[Jerry Schatzberg]], [[William Klein (photographer)|William Klein]], [[Tim Yip]], [[Larry Clark]], [[Ellen Von Unwerth]], [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]], [[Inez van Lamsweerde]] &amp; Vinoodh Matadin, [[Indrani]], [[Rossy de Palma]], Michael Nyman and welcomed by: Centre Pompidou, Jeu de Paume, Milano's Palazzo Morando, FIAF, NYC, Festival du nouveau cinema Montreal, CPH-DOX, Barbican Art Gallery, Guggenheim, Bilbao, Pica Contemporary Art Museum, Perth with the support of Italian Vogue, Bvlgari, Dom Perignon, FIAF and Kering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashadedviewonfashionfilm.com/archives |title=archives |publisher=A Shaded View on Fashion Film |date= |accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diane Pernet's first degree was in documentary film making at [[Temple University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoomagazine.de/the_magazine/contributors/ |title=Zoo Magazine |publisher=Zoomagazine.de |date= |accessdate=2 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110722142221/http://www.zoomagazine.de/the_magazine/contributors/| archivedate= 22 July 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she has been making small low-fi movies for years. She also worked as a [[costume designer]] for, amongst others, director [[Amos Gitai]]. So the founder of ASVOFF knows how important fashion is in a film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fashionista.com/2010/08/diane-pernet-on-tavi-fashion-film-and-the-future-of-catwalks/ |title=Diane Pernet on Tavi, Fashion Film, and the Future of Catwalks – Fashionista: Fashion Industry News, Designers, Runway Shows, Style Advice |publisher=Fashionista.com |date=12 August 2010 |accessdate=2 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110721062420/http://fashionista.com/2010/08/diane-pernet-on-tavi-fashion-film-and-the-future-of-catwalks/| archivedate= 21 July 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Mark Eley of [[Eley Kishimoto]] commissioned her to make a road movie for the launch of his new [[Fashion|menswear]] line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/aug/13/observerreview.onlinesupplement1?INTCMP=SRCH |title=Celebrity surfers &amp;#124; Technology &amp;#124; The Observer |publisher=Guardian |date= 13 August 2006|accessdate=2 August 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a short film that documented his participation in the GUMBALL 3000 which was a car race that went from London to [[Monte Carlo]]. The 18-minute film was called The Adventure of Pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gumball3000.com/videos/detail/95?page=1 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125152731/http://www.gumball3000.com/videos/detail/95?page=1 |date=25 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She showed the film to Dino Dinco, her Los Angeles collaborator at the time and he asked her if she wanted to screen it in LA. A day later EGR (Enrique Gonzalez Rangel), her Mexico City contributor, sent her a fashion film that he made and Pernet posted it on her blog. The idea to create a travelling fashion film festival had been on the back burner for years before Pernet showed Adventure of Pleasure to Dinco. The name "You Wear It Well,"  was based on a Rod Stewart song. The first fashion film festival, "You Wear It Well," launched in August 2006, premiering in Los Angeles at Cinespace. Dinco and Pernet arranged a second edition of "You Wear It Well" in 2007.&lt;ref name="blogspot1"&gt;[http://fashionheroines.blogspot.com/2010/05/diane-pernet-talks-about-blogging.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dianepernet.typepad.com/diane/2006/08/you_wear_it_wel.html |title=Diane, A Shaded View on Fashion: You Wear it Well's first prize winner in Copenhagen was Jeremy Scott's Starring |publisher=Dianepernet.typepad.com |date= |accessdate=2 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819085842/http://dianepernet.typepad.com/diane/2006/08/you_wear_it_wel.html# |archivedate=19 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the work of Diane Pernet and EGR, You Wear It Well featured video creations from [[Maison Martin Margiela]], [[Nick Knight (photographer)|Nick Knight]]/[[Alexander McQueen]], [[Jeremy Scott]], Bernhard Willhelm, Marcelo Krasilcic, [[Jean-Charles de Castelbajac]], NOKI and Ruben Toledo.&lt;ref&gt;http://dianepernet.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/ywiwpostersf.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007 Diane Pernet also co-curated the NOOVO fashion and photography festival in Santiago de Compostela.
"You Wear It Well" was dissolved in 2007 when Pernet with the support of her current producer, David Herman, took the festival from a one-day program to a three-day program and to make it an extension of the ASVOF blog, hence the name ASVOFF (A Shaded View on Fashion Film). In September 2008, ASVOFF was launched in Paris at Jeu de Paume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeudepaume.org/?page=article&amp;sousmenu=102&amp;idArt=807&amp;lieu=7 |title=A Shaded View on Fashion Film |publisher=Jeu de Paume |date= |accessdate=2 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718025534/http://www.jeudepaume.org/?page=article&amp;sousmenu=102&amp;idArt=807&amp;lieu=7| archivedate= 18 July 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Libya}}

The '''Allied administration of Libya''' was the control of the ex-Italian colony of [[Libya]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] from 1943 until Libyan independence was granted in 1951. It was divided into the following:
*[[British Military Administration (Libya)|British Military Administration of Libya]] (British Administration after 1950)
*[[Fezzan-Ghadames (French Administration)|Military Territory of Fezzan-Ghadames]]

==Characteristics==
The Allied administration was done by the [[United Kingdom]] in [[Tripolitania]] and [[Cyrenaica]], and by [[France]] in [[Fezzan]]. Officially Libya remained "[[Italian Libya]]" until February 1947, when [[Italy]] signed the Peace Treaty losing all the colonies and possessions of the defeated former Italian Empire.

The British administered it as the [[British Military Administration (Libya)|British Military Administration of Libya]].

The French forces occupied the area that was the former Italian [[Territorio Sahara Libico]] and made several requests to annex administratively their Fezzan to the [[French colonial Empire]]. The administrative personnel remained the former Italian bureaucrats.

{{Quote|The British administration began the training of a badly needed Libyan civil service. Italian administrators continued to be employed in Tripoli, however. The Italian legal code remained in effect for the duration of the war. In the lightly populated Fezzan region, a French military administration formed a counterpart to the British operation. With British approval, Free French forces moved north from Chad to take control of the territory in January 1943. French administration was directed by a staff stationed in Sabha, but it was largely exercised through Fezzan notables of the family of Sayf an Nasr. At the lower echelons, French troop commanders acted in both military and civil capacities according to customary French practice in the Algerian Sahara. In the west, Ghat was attached to the French military region of southern Algeria and Ghadamis to the French command of southern Tunisia--giving rise to Libyan nationalist fears that French intentions might include the ultimate detachment of Fezzan from Libya.|Library of Congress:Libya|&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ly0034)  Library of Congress:Libya]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==

{{See also|Western Desert Campaign}}
[[Image:British tanks and crews line up on Tripoli's waterfront.jpg|thumb|British tanks and crews line up on [[Tripoli]]'s waterfront after capturing the city during [[World War II]] - December 1942]]


In November 1942, the Allied forces retook Cyrenaica. By February 1943, the last German and Italian soldiers were driven from Libya and the Allied occupation of Libya began.

In the early post-war period, Tripolitania and Cyrenaica remained under [[United Kingdom|British]] administration, while the [[France|French]] controlled Fezzan. In 1944, Idris returned from exile in [[Cairo]] but declined to resume permanent residence in Cyrenaica until the removal in 1947 of some aspects of foreign control. Under the terms of the 1947 peace treaty with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], Italy, which hoped to maintain the colony of [[Tripolitania]], (and France, which wanted the [[Fezzan]]), relinquished all claims to Libya. Libya so remained united.

Severe anti-Jewish violence erupted in Libya following the liberation of North Africa by Allied troops. From November 5 to November 7, 1945, more than 140 Jews (including 36 children) were killed and hundreds injured in a [[1945 Tripoli pogrom|pogrom in Tripoli]]. Five synagogues in Tripoli and four in provincial towns were destroyed, and over 1,000 Jewish residences and commercial buildings were plundered in Tripoli alone.&lt;ref name=Selent&gt;Selent, pp. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shields&gt;Shields, Jacqueline."[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/jewref.html Jewish Refugees from Arab Countries]" in [[Jewish Virtual Library]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, 2003, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1948, anti-Jewish rioters in Libya killed another 12 Jews and destroyed 280 Jewish homes.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt; The fear and insecurity which arose from these anti-Jewish attacks and the [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel|founding of the state of Israel]] led many Jews to [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim lands|flee Libya]]. From 1948 to 1951, 30,972 Libyan Jews [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim lands|moved to Israel]].&lt;ref name=berkeley&gt;[http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/JewsofLibya/LibyanJews/thejews.html History of the Jewish Community in Libya] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718035942/http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/JewsofLibya/LibyanJews/thejews.html |date=18 July 2006 }}". Retrieved July 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, the rest of Libyan Jews (some 7,000) were evacuated to Italy.

{{Quote|Disposition of Italian colonial holdings was a question that had to be considered before the peace treaty officially ending the war with Italy could be completed. Technically, Libya remained an Italian possession administered by Britain and France, but at the Potsdam Conference in 1945 the Allies--Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States--agreed that the Italian colonies seized during the war should not be returned to Italy. Further consideration of the question was delegated to the Allied Council of Foreign Ministers, which included a French representative; although all council members initially favored some form of trusteeship, no formula could be devised for disposing of Libya. The United States suggested a trusteeship for the whole country under control of the United Nations (UN), whose charter had become effective in October 1945, to prepare it for self-government. The Soviet Union proposed separate provincial trusteeships, claiming Tripolitania for itself and assigning Fezzan to France and Cyrenaica to Britain. France, seeing no end to the discussions, advocated the return of the territory to Italy. To break the impasse, Britain finally recommended immediate independence for Libya{{cn|date=August 2018}}|Library of Congress: United Nations and Libya}}

[[Idris I of Libya|Idris as-Senussi]], the [[Emir]] of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica and the leader of the [[Senussi]] Muslim Sufi order, represented Libya in the UN negotiations, and on 24 December 1951, Libya declared its independence with representatives from Cyrenaica, Tripolitania and Fezzan declaring a [[Political union|union]] with the country being called the United Kingdom of Libya, and Idris as-Senussi being offered the crown. In accordance with the constitution the new country had a [[federal government]] with the three states of Cyrenaica, Tripolitania and Fezzan having [[autonomy]]. The kingdom also had three capital cities: [[Tripoli]], [[Benghazi]] and [[Bayda, Libya|Bayda]]. Two years after independence, on 28 March 1953, Libya joined the [[Arab League]].

When Libya declared its independence on 24 December 1951, ending the Allied occupation of Libya, it was the first country to achieve independence through the [[United Nations]] and one of the first former European possessions in [[Africa]] to gain independence.

'''''Baltimore Rising''''' is a 2017 documentary on the [[2015 Baltimore protests|protests in Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray]].  It was created, directed, and produced by actor and filmmaker [[Sonja Sohn]] and [[HBO Films]].  It covers the [[death of Freddie Gray]], the protests and riots immediately following, efforts to keep the peace during the unsuccessful prosecutions of the six police officers involved, as well as efforts to change policing by both the [[Maryland General Assembly]] and the [[US Department of Justice]].  It includes segments covering the perspective of [[Black Lives Matter]] protesters, community leaders, and members of the [[Baltimore Police Department]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/what-happened-after-freddie-gray-baltimore-rising-depicts-protests-shook-689699 WHAT HAPPENED AFTER FREDDIE GRAY? 'BALTIMORE RISING' DEPICTS PROTESTS THAT SHOOK THE NATION]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the protesters, it focuses on [[Kwame Rose]] and Makayla Gilliam-Price, two young (17-21 years old) activists.  Among community leaders, the documentary shows Adam Jackson and Dayvon Love, members of the group Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle.  Among the police, ''Baltimore Rising'' includes Lt. Colonel Melvin Russell, head of a community affairs program in the BPD; Dawnyell Taylor, the lead police investigator into the death of Gray; and interim police commissioner Kevin Davis, who came to his position shortly after Gray's death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-tv-baltimore-rising-20170727-story.html HBO doc 'Baltimore Rising' explores life after Freddie Gray]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hbo.com/content/hboweb/en/documentaries/baltimore-rising/synopsis.html Baltimore Rising synopsis]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Baltimore Rising'' premiered on [[HBO]] on November 20, 2017.

==Reception==
Melanie McFarland of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' praised the documentary, writing it accurately communicated the "systemic and entrenched" problems on both sides: police who feel unsafe, retreat to their cars, and see everyone as potentially dangerous suspects, which furthers the alienation felt by the community and by the activists.  She also felt that while it provided no neat conclusions or solutions, it accurately presented and summarized the many conflicting voices and opinions in the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.salon.com/2017/11/20/baltimore-rising-questing-for-justice-from-the-ground-up/ "Baltimore Rising": Questing for justice from the ground up]&lt;/ref&gt;  Hank Steuver of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called ''Baltimore Rising'' simultaneously fascinating, scattered, and frustrating.  He felt that this reflected the disorganized nature of the protests and the difficulties with channeling grievances into useful systemic change, however, so the frustration was authentic and accurate to the source material.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/like-the-activism-it-chronicles-baltimore-rising-struggles-to-find-real-progress/2017/11/19/2aba2e00-cbc4-11e7-aa96-54417592cf72_story.html Like the activism it chronicles, ‘Baltimore Rising’ struggles to find real progress]&lt;/ref&gt;  David Zurawick of ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' thought ''Rising'' was excellent, especially its "brilliant" opening, but felt it was somewhat too lenient in its treatment of the Baltimore police's efforts, which he felt should have been examined more skeptically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/tv/z-on-tv-blog/bs-fe-zontv-baltimore-rising-hbo-20171106-story.html Sonja Sohn's 'Baltimore Rising' on HBO drills down on life after Freddie Gray]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BioSentinel''' is a planned low-cost [[CubeSat]] spacecraft on an [[astrobiology]] mission that will use [[yeast]] to detect, measure, and compare the impact of [[Outer space#Environment|deep space]] radiation on [[DNA repair]] over long time beyond [[low-Earth orbit]].&lt;ref name="Bio2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mstl.atl.calpoly.edu/~bklofas/Presentations/DevelopersWorkshop2014/Ricco_BioSentinel.pdf |format=PDF |title=BioSentinel: DNA Damage-and-Repair Experiment Beyond Low Earth Orbit |last=Ricco |first=Tony |work=NASA Ames Research Center |date=2014 |accessdate=2015-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=techport&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA TechPort -- BioSentinel Project|url=https://techport.nasa.gov/view/14653|website=NASA TechPort|publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selected in 2013 for a 2020 launch, the spacecraft will operate in the deep space radiation environment throughout its 18-month mission.&lt;ref name="BioSentinel Home"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/engineering/projects/biosentinel.html |title=Home Page of BioSentinel |last=Caldwell |first=Sonja |work=NASA |date=5 August 2014 |accessdate=2015-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This will help scientists understand the [[health threat from cosmic rays]] and deep space environment on living [[organism]]s and reduce the risk associated with long-term human exploration, as [[NASA]] plans to send humans farther into space than ever before.&lt;ref name=techport /&gt;&lt;ref name="BioSentinel Home"/&gt;

==Background==

BioSentinel is one of thirteen low-cost [[CubeSat]] missions selected as secondary payloads for the first test flight of NASA's [[Space Launch System]] called [[Exploration Mission 1]].&lt;ref name="BioSentinel Home"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SClark"&gt;{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Stephen |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/2015/04/08/nasa-adding-to-list-of-cubesats-flying-on-first-sls-mission/ |title=NASA adding to list of CubeSats flying on first SLS mission |work=Spaceflight Now |date=8 April 2015 |accessdate=2015-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft will be deployed in [[cis-lunar space]]. The BioSentinel mission will be NASA's first time since [[Apollo 17]] in 1972, to send living organisms to deep space (beyond [[low Earth orbit]]).&lt;ref name="SClark"/&gt;

==Objective==
The primary objective of BioSentinel is to develop a biosensor using a simple model organism ([[yeast]]) to detect, measure, and correlate the impact of [[space radiation]] to living organisms over long durations beyond [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) and into heliocentric orbit. While progress has been made with simulations, no terrestrial laboratory can duplicate the unique space radiation environment.&lt;ref name=techport /&gt;&lt;ref name="BioSentinel Home"/&gt;

==Biological science==
The BioSentinel biosensor uses the budding [[yeast]] ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' to detect and measure [[DNA repair#Double-strand breaks|double-strand breaks]] (DSBs) on [[DNA]] that occur in response to ambient space radiation.&lt;ref name='Hugo 2016'&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20160012542.pdf BioSentinel: Mission Development of a Radiation Biosensor to Gauge DNA Damage and Repair Beyond Low Earth Orbit on a 6U NanosatelliteHugo] (PDF). Hugo Sanchez, NASA. 20 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This yeast strain was selected because its DSB repair mechanisms are well studied and are very similar to those in human cells.&lt;ref name="Bio2014"/&gt; The biosensor consists of [[Genetically modified organism|specifically engineered]] yeast strains and nutrient selection strategies that ensure that only cells that can repair their DSBs will grow in specialized media. Therefore, culture growth and metabolic activity of yeast cells directly indicate a successful DSB-and-repair event.&lt;ref name="Bio2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BioSentinel Home"/&gt;

After completing the Moon flyby and spacecraft checkout, the science mission phase will begin with the wetting of the first set of yeast-containing wells with specialized media.&lt;ref name="BioSentinel Home"/&gt;  Multiple sets of wells will be activated at different time points over the 18-month mission. One reserve set of wells will be activated in the occurrence of a [[solar particle event]] (SPE). Approximately, a 4 to 5 [[Rad (unit)|krad]] total [[Absorbed dose|ionizing dose]] is anticipated.&lt;ref name="Bio2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecs.fullerton.edu/~cblee/ISSC2015/2014/docs2014/A1_Sorgenfrei_Presentation.pdf BioSentinel Presentation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526003532/http://www.ecs.fullerton.edu/~cblee/ISSC2015/2014/docs2014/A1_Sorgenfrei_Presentation.pdf |date=May 26, 2015 }} 2014 (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Payload science data and spacecraft telemetry will be stored on board and then downloaded to the ground.&lt;ref name="BioSentinel Home"/&gt;

Biological measurements will be compared to data provided by onboard [[Dosimeter|radiation sensors]] and dosimeters. Additionally, three identical BioSentinel payloads will be developed for comparison reference, one of them will be exposed at [[low Earth orbit]] outside the [[International Space Station]] (ISS), where there is a comparatively low-radiation environment due to [[Earth's magnetic field]] protecting the space station.&lt;ref name="Bio2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BioSentinel Home"/&gt;

==Spacecraft==
[[File:BioSentinel CubeSat orbit.png|thumb|left|Representative heliocentric orbit of the BioSentinel spacecraft]]
The Biosentinel spacecraft will consist on a 6U [[CubeSat]] [[Satellite bus|bus]] format, with external dimensions of 10×20×30&amp;nbsp;cm and a mass of about {{convert|14|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Bio2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=techport /&gt;&lt;ref name="BioSentinel Home"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunter BioSentinel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/biosentinel.htm |title=BioSentinel |last=Krebs |first=Gunter Dirk |work=Gunter's Space Page |date=2015 |accessdate=2015-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Gunter2015'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/nea-scout.htm |title=NEA-Scout |last=Krebs |first=Gunter Dirk |date=13 April 2015 |accessdate=2015-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At launch, BioSentinel resides within the second stage on the launch vehicle from which it is deployed to a lunar flyby trajectory and into an Earth-trailing [[heliocentric]] orbit.

Of the total 6 Units volume, 4 Units will hold the science payload, including a [[radiation dosimeter]] and a dedicated 3-color [[Absorption spectroscopy|spectrometer]] for each well; 1U will house the ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem) and 1U will house the [[attitude control]] thruster assembly, which will be 3D printed all in one piece: cold gas ([[DuPont R236fa]]) propellant tanks, lines and seven nozzles. The use of 3D printing also allows the optimization of space for increased propellant storage&lt;ref name='Stevenson 2017'&gt;[https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=http://scholar.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=3373&amp;context=smallsat Design and characterization of a 3D-printed attitude control thruster for an interplanetary 6U CubeSat] (PDF). Terry Stevenson, et al. Georgia Institute of Technology. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; (165 grams&lt;ref name='Hugo 2016'/&gt;). The thrust of each nozzle is 50 [[Newton (unit)|mN]], and a specific impulse of 31 seconds.&lt;ref name='Stevenson 2017'/&gt; The attitude control system is being developed and fabricated by the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]. 

Electric power will be generated by deployable [[solar panel]]s rated at 30W, and telecommunications will rely on the [[Iris (transponder)|Iris transponder]] at [[X band]].&lt;ref name="Bio2014"/&gt;

The spacecraft is being developed by NASA [[Ames Research Center]], NASA [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], NASA [[Johnson Space Center]], NASA [[Marshall Space Flight Center]], [[NASA Headquarters]], [[Loma Linda University Medical Center]], and the [[University of Saskatchewan]] in Canada.&lt;ref name="Bio2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=techport /&gt;

'''Breaking news''', interchangeably termed '''late-breaking news''' and also known as a '''special report''' or '''special coverage''' or '''news bulletin''', is a [[news|current issue]] that broadcasters feel warrants the interruption of scheduled programming and/or current news in order to report its details. Its use is also assigned to the most significant story of the moment or a story that is being covered live. It could be a story that is simply of wide interest to viewers and has little impact otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Always Free Online|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/breaking-news|author=Christopher Merrill|publisher=Collins English Dictionary|date=January 20, 2014|accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Breaking News –  Journalism Terms|url=http://journalism.about.com/od/journalismglossary/g/breakingnews.htm|publisher=Journalism.about.com|date=December 20, 2013|accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many times, breaking news is used after the news organization has already reported on the story. When a story has not been reported on previously, the graphic and phrase "Just In" is sometimes used instead.

==Formats==
===Television===
The format of a ''special report'' or ''breaking news'' event on television commonly consists of the current non-news programming (or, in some cases, regularly scheduled newscasts) suddenly switching to a reverse countdown, usually from 5 seconds, to allow any [[Network affiliate|affiliated stations]] to switch to the network news feed (television stations typically do not provide these countdowns for local coverage, normally leading with a graphic and/or voiceover announcing the cut-in). If a national network newscast is in progress when the breaking news event occurs, the newscast will pause temporarily to allow other network affiliates to join the network news feed.
There is then an opening graphic, featuring music (such as [[NBC]]'s "[[The Mission (theme music)|The Pulse of Events]]", composed by [[John Williams]]) which adds an emphasis on the importance of the event. This is usually followed by the introduction of a [[news anchor]], who welcomes the viewer to the broadcast and introduces the story at hand. [[Lower thirds]] and other graphics may also be altered to convey a sense of urgency. 

Once the story is introduced, the network or local station may, if possible, choose to continue to show a live shot of the anchor or may cut away to video or images of the story that is being followed during the broadcast. Additionally, the coverage may be passed to a [[reporter]] at the location of the breaking event, possibly sharing more information about the story as it breaks.

Depending upon the story being followed, the report may last only a few minutes, or continue for multiple hours – or with the longest uninterrupted news events, four days – at a time (events in which the latter instances has occurred include the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] and the [[September 11 attacks]], which took place between November 22–26, 1963 and September 11–15, 2001, respectively). If coverage continues for an extended amount of time, the network may integrate analysis about the story through analysts in-studio, via phone, [[communications satellite|satellite]], [[broadband]] (B-GAN) or through other means of communication. Depending on the severity of the event, regular [[television commercial|commercial advertising]] may be completely suspended for sustained coverage, and network affiliates will be required to insert their [[station identification]] in at the top of the hour overlaid during the report rather than through the usual means of a station imaging promo or program reminder. 

If a story occurs during the [[Dayparting|Early Fringe]] timeslot and depending on the magnitude of the events at hand, local stations might be given the opportunity to break away from the network feed and begin their evening newscasts. This is set up by a cue from the network's talent that they will pause for a few seconds to reset coverage, at which point an opening graphic may be rolled again. Information is also disseminated from an internal alert service utilized by a station's [[master control]]. After the local newscast, stations will likely return to the network's feed as they normally would for the nightly news, but they may be joining in on an "extended edition". Whether or not a station will take over for local news is usually the choice of that station's [[news director]].

When the coverage comes to a close, the network or station may either resume programming that was occurring prior to the event or begin new programming (if the breaking news occurs during a newscast the network will switch back to the newscast upon completion if time permits), depending upon the amount of time spent on the coverage. The anchor will usually remind viewers to check the network's website (or that of the station, if coverage is provided locally), or watch any [[United States cable news|cable news]] channels that may be co-owned with the network for more information. If the story breaks during daytime programming, the anchor will usually remind viewers that there will be or might be more details on their local news that day and a full wrap-up on the network's evening news program. Usually, regular daytime programming is re-joined in progress and segments may be missed.

If the event occurs during [[prime time]], the anchor will usually remind viewers that there will be more details on their late local newscast and on the network's [[breakfast television|overnight news program]] (if applicable) the next morning. Programming at this time is either joined in progress or started back up at the point of the interruption, depending on whether the program is new to air, highly rated or has time left in its time slot to finish airing (for instance, [[ABC News (United States)|ABC]]'s breaking news report involving the April 2017 [[2017 Shayrat missile strike|Shayrat missile strike]] took into account a new episode of the popular series ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]'', where the show was resumed right at the point of interruption twice for those reports; [[NBC]]'s coverage featured the low-rated ''[[The Blacklist: Redemption]]'' joined in the middle of an episode in progress after their special report without any of that consideration). In either of the above instances, network (and in some cases, for local stations, [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]]) programs that have segments not aired or are pre-empted in their entirety by breaking news reports – particularly those that extend to or longer than 20 or 45 minutes, depending on the length of the previously scheduled program – may have to be rescheduled to air at a later time. 

Some events, like [[State of the Union address]]es and [[United States presidential debates|presidential debates]], are scheduled to start at the top of the hour during prime time. Under those circumstances, regularly scheduled network programming is preempted for the entire duration of the event. If there is sufficient time (generally 60 minutes or more) remaining in prime time, the network may broadcast its next regularly scheduled program in its entirety or join regularly scheduled programming in progress. However, if there is insufficient time remaining for any prime-time programs, the special report will continue until the network affiliates begin airing their late local newscasts.

In the United States, on days when [[United States presidential elections|presidential elections]] take place, regularly scheduled prime-time programming is suspended so that networks can air up-to-the-minute coverage of the elections. Likewise, regularly scheduled daytime programs are suspended during coverage of [[United States presidential inaugurations|presidential inaugurations]]. However, during those types of events, regular commercial advertising is shown. Similar procedures are enacted for elections or political inaugurations that take place in other countries.

===Radio===
On radio, the process of a breaking news story is somewhat the same, though some different considerations are made for the medium. For instance, a breaking news theme is required by default to have an urgent tenor and be used only for the purpose of true breaking news or bulletins. This is obvious on the local [[all-news radio]] stations owned by [[Entercom]] (formerly owned by [[CBS Radio]]), which very rarely use a breaking news theme for all but the most urgent and dire of breaking news, and is purposefully structured to give a sense of attention for the listener, almost sounding like an alarm. For local events, continuous coverage may be imposed, or else the station may wait until they have a reporter at the scene and will promise more details of the event as they become available.

National news that is broadcast over a [[radio network]] requires constant monitoring by station employees to allow the network coverage to air, although many stations will take the 'urgent' signal sent by the network and break into programming immediately. Again, continuous coverage from a national radio network depends on the severity of the event, and often the network may just pass down the coverage by their local affiliate with spare commentary by the network's anchors.

Other considerations are made also; FM music stations rarely relay breaking news unless it is an event of grave national concern, though local weather warnings are relayed when in effect (either in the form of updates provided by an on-staff anchor or [[disc jockey]], an emergency alert system or through an audio simulcast of a television station which maintains a contractual partnership with a radio outlet). Less urgent events allow a network to feed updates to stations at 20, 30 and 50 minutes after the hour to give a summary of events. Stations are also careful about what stories are relayed during play-by-play broadcasts of professional and college sports, as those are the programs most listened to on radio, so breaking news coverage is limited to only commercial breaks.

==Usage==
News bulletins have been a fixture of radio broadcasting since at least the 1920s. Examples of early news bulletins in the [[Golden Age of Radio]] include fictionalized versions in the 1938 radio drama ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]'' and coverage of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], which was also the first television news bulletin, reported on stations in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. [[KTLA]] in Los Angeles is credited with being the first television station to provide extended coverage of a breaking news event: for 27½ hours from April 8 to 9, 1949, the station carried live coverage of an attempt to rescue three-year-old [[Kathy Fiscus]], who had fallen down an abandoned well in [[San Marino, California]], where she ultimately perished due to [[asphyxia]] from a lack of oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Kathy Fiscus Story: Turning Point in TV News|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-kathy-fiscus-story-19890408-story.html|author=[[Stan Chambers]]|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 8, 1989|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Los Angeles Television News Pioneer Stan Chambers Dies at 91|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/los-angeles-television-news-pioneer-stan-chambers-dies-28953145|website=[[ABC News]]|date=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades before 24-hour news networks such as [[CNN]] began to exist, programming interruptions were restricted to extremely urgent news, such as the death of an important political figure. For example, one of the earliest such interruptions that modern viewers would recognize as "breaking news" coverage was for the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy]] in 1963, (with [[CBS News]] anchorman [[Walter Cronkite]]'s [[Walter Cronkite#Kennedy assassination|coverage]] being especially noted), and as such reflected the relatively crude technology and procedures of that era. Such breaks are now common at 24-hour [[news channel]]s, which may have an anchor available for live interruption at any time. Some networks, such as [[Sky News]], largely emphasize this, even advertising the station/network as being "''first for breaking news''".

Another type of breaking news is that of [[severe weather]] events, which had such coverage evolve in a very similar manner. In [[North America]] until the 1990s, television and radio stations normally only provided long-form weather coverage during immediate, ongoing threats (such as a [[tornado]] that has been confirmed visually or by [[Doppler weather radar|radar]] to be producing damage or a landfalling [[hurricane]]); cut-ins and, in the case of television stations, [[news ticker|alert crawls]] during regular programming were used otherwise, even when higher-end alerts such as [[tornado warning]]s were issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The History (and Future) of Tornado Warning Dissemination in the United States|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2010BAMS3062.1|author=Timothy A. Coleman|author2=Kevin R. Knupp|author3=[[James Spann]]|author4=J. B. Elliot|author5=Brian E. Peters|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|format=[[PDF]]|date=May 2011 |doi=10.1175/2010BAMS3062.1 |volume=92 |journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society |pages=567–582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advancements in newsgathering and weather technology (including the deployment of [[helicopter]]s to provide aerial coverage and radar systems that can detect specific storm attributes), coupled with a few highly life-threatening events during the 1990s (such as [[Hurricane Andrew]] and the [[1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak]]) and the resulting heightened urgency to advise those in the storm's path to take safety precautions in advance made extended (or "wall-to-wall") weather coverage once a high-end alert is issued more common in storm-prone areas, with cut-ins only being used in weather events of lesser severity.

In various countries and at various news outlets, terms such as "(late)breaking", "urgent", "flash", "bulletin", and "alert" may accompany breaking news reports. The term ''breaking news'' has come to replace the older use of ''news bulletin'', with the latter term relegated to only the most extraordinary of events. There has been widespread use of ''breaking news'' at the local level, particularly when one station in a [[media market|market]] wants to emphasize the exclusivity of coverage. Not all viewers agree that stories assigned as ''breaking news'' rise to the significance or level of interest that warrant such a designation.

American network news divisions still use the term ''special report'' for either a breaking news,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Check Out Latest Breaking News Headlines|url=http://www.mid-day.com/news|publisher=[[Mid Day]]|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a developing news story or both, but tend to use the term ''breaking news'' on their [[Breakfast television|morning]] and evening news programs. Most local stations across the United States that interrupt regular programming for a news story use the ''breaking news'' and ''special report'' terms (though, local broadcast news outlets use the former most often), with a voice-over stating either "This is a breaking news special report" or "This is a special breaking news report" or "This is a(n) (network name) News Special Report" or "This is a(n) (station brand name) breaking news (special) report" or "(From [station brand name],) this is breaking news." The breaking news ending has a past-tense variation, followed by a disclaimer for viewers who would like more information to see the network's news division website.

However, "special report" has also been de-emphasized by cable news channels in the United States, as both Fox News Channel and CNN now use that phrase for regular programming; Fox News carries ''[[Special Report with Bret Baier]]'', a daily political affairs program, while CNN's ''Special Report'' is a catch-all banner for CNN's library documentary and [[true crime]] programming.

==Criticism==
In early coverage of a breaking story, details are commonly sketchy, usually due to the limited information that is available at the time. For example, during the [[Sago Mine disaster]], there were initial reports that all twelve miners were found alive, but news organizations later learned that only one actually survived.

Often it is considered important to be quick with news bulletins also for less important news. Such news might not be updated later, even if it was found that information was wrong or severely incomplete. If someone (e.g. when editing Wikipedia) later wants to research the event, only incomplete information might be found.

[[File:MSNBC 12-28-17 breaking news.jpg|right|thumb|An example of "breaking news" with no new developments, seen in a screenshot of [[MSNBC]]'s [[The 11th Hour (news program)|''The 11th Hour'']], on December 28, 2017 describing events from August 2017 during the [[2017–18 North Korea crisis]].]]

Another criticism has been the diluting of the importance of "breaking news" by the need of [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour news channels]] to fill time, applying the title to [[soft news]] stories of questionable importance and urgency (for example, [[car chase]]s). Others question as to whether the use of the term is excessive, citing occasions when the term is used even though scheduled programming is not interrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When Is Breaking News… Not?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|url=http://www.insidethecbc.com/breakingnot|work=InsideTheCBC.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208101055/http://insidethecbc.com/breakingnot|archivedate=2008-02-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some programs, such as [[HLN (TV network)|HLN]]'s defunct ''[[Nancy Grace (TV series)|Nancy Grace]]'', used the term for recurring coverage of events which occurred months before, even when [[criminal trial]] coverage which may deserve the breaking news tag was not occurring and no new information has developed.

In June 2013, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[WDRB]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]] gained notice in the television industry for a [[promo (media)|promo]] that criticized the broad and constant use of the "breaking news" term, explaining that it has been overused as a "marketing ploy" by other news-producing stations, who tend to apply the term to stories that are low in urgency and/or relevance. To coincide with the promo, on its website, WDRB posted "Contracts" with its viewers and advertisers, with the former list promising to use "breaking news" judiciously (applying it to stories that are "both 'breaking' and 'news'").&lt;ref name=TVSpy06042013&gt;{{cite news|title=Louisville Station Stops Using 'Breaking News'|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvspy/louisville-station-stops-using-breaking-news_b92526|work=[[AdWeek|TVSpy]]|date=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4473">'''Bribe Payers Index''' ('''BPI''') is a measure of how willing a nation's business sector appears to engage in corrupt business practices. The first BPI was published by [[Transparency International]] on October 26, 1999.

==The BPI 2011==
===Methodology===
The BPI 2011 ranked 28 of the [[List of countries by exports|leading exporting countries]] on the likelihood their multinational businesses will use [[bribe]]s when operating abroad. The ranking is calculated from responses by businessmen to two questions on the [[World Economic Forum]]’s Executive Opinion Survey.

The first question asks for the country of origin of foreign-owned companies doing the most business in their country. The second question is: "In  your  experience,  to  what  extent  do  firms  from  the  countries  you  have  selected  make undocumented extra payments or bribes?" Answers are to be given on a scale of 1 (bribes are common or even mandatory) to 10 (bribes are unknown).

The BPI ranking is the averaged score, with higher scores suggesting a lower likelihood of using bribery.

These countries were selected as the leading international or regional exporting countries. Their combined global exports represented 75 percent of the world total in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[International Monetary Fund]], international finance statistics, 2005 figures.

'''Combined drug intoxication''' ('''CDI'''), also known as '''multiple drug intake''' ('''MDI''') or '''lethal  intoxication''', is an [[Unnatural death|unnatural]] cause of human death. CDI is often confused with drug overdose, but it is a different phenomenon. It is distinct because it is due to the simultaneous use of multiple drugs, whether the drugs are [[Prescription drug|prescription]], [[Over-the counter drug|over-the-counter]], [[Recreational drug|recreational]], or some other combination.  Alcohol can exacerbate the symptoms and may directly contribute to increased severity of symptoms.  The reasons for [[toxicity]] vary depending on the mixture of drugs. Usually, most victims die after using two or more drugs in combination that suppress breathing, and the low blood [[oxygen]] level causes [[brain death]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120718175713/http://www.americanoutreach.org/combined-drug-intoxication.htm "Combined Drug Intoxication"]. American Outreach. (March 22, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDI/MDI phenomenon seems to be becoming more common in recent years. In December 2007, according to Dr. John Mendelson, a [[pharmacology|pharmacologist]] at the [[California Pacific Medical Center|California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute]], deaths by combined drug intoxication were relatively "rare" ("one in several million"), though they appeared then to be "on the rise".&lt;ref name=Montgomery&gt;{{cite web|author=James Montgomery|title=Hawthorne Heights Guitarist Casey Calvert's Fatal Drug Interaction Was Rare, Experts Say: Number of Accidental-Interaction Deaths Still Remains Relatively Low, Although Such Incidents Are on the Rise|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1577017/20071220/hawthorne_heights.jhtml|work=[[MTV]].com|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=June 21, 2007|accessdate=2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008, the [[Associated Press]] and [[CNN]] reported on a medical study showing that over two decades, from 1983 to 2004, such deaths have soared.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news |title=Home deaths from Drug Errors Soar |url=http://stateschronicle.com/home-deaths-drug-errors-soar-6337.html |work=[[CNN]] |publisher=''cnn.com'' ([[Associated Press]]) |date=July 28, 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-04 |quote=Deaths from medication mistakes at home, such as actor [[Heath Ledger]]'s accidental overdose, rose dramatically during the past two decades, an analysis of U.S. death certificates finds. ... Prescription drug abuse plays a role in the rise in fatalities, but it's unclear how much, researchers said. ... The authors blame soaring home use of prescription painkillers and other potent drugs, which 25 years ago were given mainly inside hospitals. ... 'The amount of medical supervision is going down and the amount of responsibility put on the patient's shoulders is going up,' said lead author David P. Phillips of the [[University of California, San Diego]]. ... The findings, based on nearly 50 million U.S. death certificates, are published in Monday's Archives of Internal Medicine. Of those, more than 224,000 involved fatal medication errors, including overdoses and mixing prescription drugs with alcohol or street drugs. ... Deaths from medication mistakes at home increased from 1,132 deaths in 1983 to 12,426 in 2004. Adjusted for population growth, that amounts to an increase of more than 700 percent during that time. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322180942/http://stateschronicle.com/home-deaths-drug-errors-soar-6337.html |archivedate=March 22, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also become a prevalent risk for older patients.&lt;ref name=Rubin&gt;{{cite news|title=Mixing Drugs Puts More Older Patients at Risk|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-12-23-mixing-drugs_N.htm|work=[[USA Today]]|format=[[World Wide Web|Web]]|publisher=[[Gannett Corporation]]|date=December 23, 2008|accessdate=2008-12-24 | first=Rita | last=Rubin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risk factors ==
People who engage in [[polypharmacy]] and other [[hypochondriac]] behaviors are at an elevated risk of death from CDI. Elderly people are at the highest risk of CDI, because of having many age-related health problems requiring many medications combined with age-impaired judgment, leading to confusion in taking medications.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rubin/&gt;

== Prevention ==
In general, the simultaneous use of multiple drugs should be carefully monitored by a qualified individual such as [[board certified]] and [[licensed]] [[Physician|medical doctor]], either an [[allopathic|MD]] or [[Osteopathic medicine|DO]] Close association between prescribing physicians and pharmacies, along with the [[Automation|computerization]] of [[Medical prescription|prescription]]s and patients' medical histories, aim to avoid the occurrence of dangerous drug interactions. Lists of contraindications for a drug are usually provided with it, either in monographs, package inserts (accompanying prescribed medications), or in warning labels (for OTC drugs). CDI/MDI might also be avoided by physicians requiring their patients to return any unused prescriptions. Patients should ask their doctors and pharmacists if there are any interactions between the drugs they are taking.

== Acetaminophen/paracetamol deaths{{anchor|Paracetamol / Acetaminophen deaths}}==
On June 30, 2009, an FDA advisory panel recommended that [[Vicodin]] and another painkiller, [[Percocet]], be removed from the market because they have allegedly caused over 400 deaths a year. The problem is with [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen/Tylenol for example) overdose and liver damage. These two drugs, in combination with other drugs like [[Nyquil]] and [[Theraflu]], can cause death by multiple drug intake and/or drug overdose. Another solution would be to not include paracetamol with [[Vicodin]] or [[Percocet]].

Australian actor [[Heath Ledger]] was found dead on January 22, 2008, in his [[SoHo]], New York City, apartment; the [[toxicology]] report concluded that the cause of death was "acute intoxication" resulting from "the combined effects of [[oxycodone]], [[hydrocodone]], [[diazepam]], [[temazepam]], [[alprazolam]], and [[doxylamine]]" and "that the manner of [his] death" was "accident, resulting from the [[drug abuse|abuse of prescription medications or combined drug intoxication (CDI)]]."&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chan&gt;{{cite news |author=Sewell Chan and James Barron (contributing) |title=City Room: Heath Ledger's Death Is Ruled an Accident|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/06/heath-ledgers-death-is-ruled-an-accident/|work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=''cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com'' |date=February 6, 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNNLedger&gt;{{cite news|author=[[CNN]]|title=Ledger's Death Caused by Accidental Overdose|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Movies/02/06/heath.ledger/index.html|work=CNN.com|format=[[World Wide Web|Web]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=February 6, 2008|accessdate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Speedball deaths ===
Some [[speedball (drug)|speedball]] deaths that are diagnosed as MDI/CDI might simply be drug overdose, which is a related but completely different phenomenon. The following list is for speedball CDI/MDI deaths only. Any combination of uppers and downers can be called a speedball death.

* [[John Belushi]], actor/comedian, from [[cocaine]] and heroin '[[speedball (drug)|speedball]]'
* [[Elisa Bridges]], actress, from heroin, [[methamphetamine]], [[pethidine]] and [[alprazolam]]
* [[Ken Caminiti]], baseball athlete, from cocaine and [[opioid]] painkillers
* [[Chris Farley]], actor/comedian, from cocaine and heroin 'speedball'
* [[Zac Foley]], bass player for [[EMF (band)|EMF]], from multiple illegal drugs
* [[Trevor Goddard]], actor, from cocaine, heroin and [[temazepam]]
* [[Mitch Hedberg]], stand-up comedian, also from 'speedball'
* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], Oscar-winning actor, from heroin, cocaine and [[amphetamines]]
* [[John Kahn]], a Jerry Garcia collaborator and member of the [[Jerry Garcia Band]], from heroin, [[cocaine]] and [[fluoxetine]]
* [[Chris "Mac Daddy" Kelly]] of [[Kris Kross]], from cocaine and heroin
* [[Brent Mydland]], keyboardist for [[The Grateful Dead]], from cocaine and heroin
* [[River Phoenix]], actor, from heroin and cocaine
* [[Layne Staley]] of [[Alice in Chains]], from cocaine and heroin
* [[Scott Weiland]] of [[Stone Temple Pilots]]/[[Velvet Revolver]] from cocaine, [[Methylenedioxyamphetamine]] (MDA), alcohol, [[buprenorphine]], and [[alprazolam]]

== CDI-related legal cases ==

=== Karen Ann Quinlan ===
{{Main|Karen Ann Quinlan case}}
The [[Right to Die]] case of then-comatose Karen Ann Quinlan (March 29, 1954 – June 11, 1985) made legal history in 1975 and 1976, stimulating public scrutiny of ethical and moral implications of her case. In 1975, after drinking [[gin and tonic]]s at a party and then taking [[Diazepam]], Quinlan collapsed, suffered [[respiratory failure]] and [[irreversible brain damage]], and, after being taken to the hospital, lapsed into a [[persistent vegetative state]]. After she had been kept alive on a [[ventilator]] for several months without improvement, her parents requested that the hospital discontinue such active care and allow her to die. The hospital refused, and the subsequent legal battles made newspaper headlines and set significant precedents. After the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] ruled in her parents' favor, Quinlan spent nine more years comatose in the hospital, before dying from [[pneumonia]] in 1985.

=== Michael Jackson ===
The CDI/MDI death of Michael Jackson led to the [[trial of Conrad Murray]], whose license was revoked in four states and who was sentenced to serve four years in a California prison.&lt;ref name=who2&gt;{{cite web|title=Karen Ann Quinlan (Medical patient)|url=http://www.who2.com/karenannquinlan.html|work=[[Who2.com]]|format=[[World Wide Web|Web]]|publisher=Who2, LLC|year=2008|accessdate=2008-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal=Houston Press|url=http://digitalissue.houstonpress.com/display_article.php?id=870488|author=Lauren Marmaduke|title=Music's Top 5 Dubious 'Dr. Feelgoods'|date=October 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/28/michael-jackson-doctor|title=In the public eye – feelgood physicians|author=David Batty|journal=The Guardian|date= June 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Steven Mikulan|title=Dr. Feelgoods and Their Celeb Patients: Who Needs Who?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14610">'''Commemorations of the American Revolution''' (1775-1783) have given it a central place in the American memory.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kammen, ''A Season of Youth: The American Revolution and the Historical Imagination'' (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; As the founding story, it is covered in the schools, memorialized by a national holiday, and commemorated in innumerable monuments. Thus [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] (the "Fourth of July") is a major national holiday celebrated annually. Besides local sites such as Bunker Hill, one of the first national pilgrimages for memorial tourists was [[Mount Vernon]], George Washington's estate, which attracted ten thousand visitors a year by the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Jean B. Lee, "Historical Memory, Sectional Strife, and the American Mecca: Mount Vernon, 1783-1853," ''Virginia Magazine of History and Biography'' (2001) 109#3 pp. 255-300 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4249931 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memory==
{{see also|United States Bicentennial}}
[[File:American revolution bicentennial.svg|thumb|250px]]
Every nation constructs and honors the memory of its founding, and following generations use it to establish its identity and define patriotism.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Schwartz,  "The social context of commemoration: A study in collective memory." ''Social forces'' 61.2 (1982): 374-402. [https://www.sfu.ca/cmns/faculty/marontate_j/487/07-spring/Readings/schwarts1982.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The memory of the Founding and the Revolution has long been used as a political weapon.  For example, the right-wing "[[Tea Party movement]]" of the 21st century explicitly memorialized the Boston Tea Party as a protest against intrusive government.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Lepore, ''The Whites Of Their Eyes: The Tea Party's Revolution and the Battle Over American History'' (Princeton University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1850s, editors and orators both North and South claimed their region was the true custodian of the legacy of 1776, as they used the Revolution symbolically in their rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan B. Crider, "De Bow's Revolution: The Memory of the American Revolution in the Politics of the Sectional Crisis, 1850-1861," ''American Nineteenth Century History'' (2009) 10#3 pp 317–332&lt;/ref&gt; David Ryan, noting that the Bicentennial was celebrated a year after the United States' humiliating 1975 withdrawal from Vietnam, says the Ford administration stressed the themes of renewal and rebirth based on a restoration of traditional values, and presented a nostalgic approach to 1776 that made it seem eternally young and fresh.&lt;ref&gt;David Ryan, "Re-enacting Independence through Nostalgia - The 1976 US Bicentennial after the Vietnam War," ''Forum for Inter-American Research'' (2012) 5#3 pp 26–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Revolution became the main source of the non-denominational "[[American civil religion]]" that has shaped patriotism, and the memory and meaning of the nation's birth ever since. Specific battles are not central (as they are for the Civil War) but rather certain events and people have been celebrated as icons of certain virtues (or vices). The American Revolution is remembered for its  [[Moses]]-like leader ([[George Washington]]),&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Hay, "George Washington: American Moses," ''American Quarterly'' (1969) 21#4 pp 780-91 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2711609 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; its [[prophet]]s ([[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Thomas Paine]]), disciples ([[Alexander Hamilton]], [[James Madison]]) and [[martyr]]s ([[Boston Massacre]], [[Crispus Attucks]], [[Nathan Hale]]), as well as its devils ([[Benedict Arnold]]), holy sites ([[Valley Forge]], [[Charlestown, Boston|Bunker Hill]]), rituals ([[Boston Tea Party]]), holy symbol ([[Flag of the United States|the new flag]]), sacred holidays ([[Independence Day]]), and holy scriptures whose every sentence is carefully studied and applied ([[The Declaration of Independence]], [[United States Constitution|the Constitution]] and [[United States Bill of Rights|the Bill of Rights]]).&lt;ref&gt;Catherine L. Albanese, ''Sons of the Fathers: The Civil Religion of the American Revolution'' (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great Men==
There are innumerable monuments or commemorations of the major [[Founding Fathers]], with the names of Washington and Jefferson (and Lincoln) most often selected for buildings, sculptures, [[U.S. presidents on U.S. postage stamps|postage]], and [[United States dollar|currency]].&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence S. Kaplan, ''Thomas Jefferson: Westward the Course of Empire'' (1999) p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Randal Strock|title=The Presidential Book of Lists: From Most to Least, Elected to Rejected, Worst to Cursed|year=2008|publisher=Random House |pages=228–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1920s, Washington and Jefferson, together with Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln, were chosen by sculptor [[Gutzon Borglum]] and approved by President [[Calvin Coolidge]] to be the four American heroes celebrated at the [[Mount Rushmore National Memorial]].    Over the decades the interpretive framework used by the [[National Park Service]] to explain this commemoration has changed, with such themes as localism giving way to nationalism, and overpowering gigantic images of Great Men giving way a little to increased attention paid to the ordinary workers who built it. The visit became less a patriotic pilgrimage than a family-oriented tourist event with success measured in terms of attendance at the remote South Dakota site, which reached a million visitors a year in 1959, and passed the two million level in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Bergman, "Can Patriotism Be Carved in Stone? A Critical Analysis of Mt. Rushmore's Orientation Films" ''Rhetoric and Public Affairs'' (2008) 11#1 pp. 89-112 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41940343 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sites and battlefields==
{{Further|Category:American Revolutionary War sites}}
Today, more than 100 battlefields and historic sites of the American Revolution are protected and maintained by federal, state and local governments.  The [[National Park Service]], a federal agency, alone owns and maintains more than 50 battlefield parks and sites related to the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nps.gov/revwar/contact/park_info.html National Park Service Revolutionary War Sites.] Accessed Jan. 4, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; On Veteran's Day (November 11) in 2014, the [[Civil War Trust]], the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] and other preservation groups announced the creation of "Campaign 1776," an initiative to protect and interpret the battlefields of the American Revolution and the War of 1812. As does the [[Civil War Trust]], "Campaign 1776" uses public-private partnerships to provide the funding to acquire battlefield properties.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.civilwar.org/news/historians-and-preservation-groups-announce-landmark-national-campaign-save-revolutionary-war Campaign 1776 Announced] Accessed Jan. 4, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of 2017, "Campaign 1776" had acquired more than 675 battlefield acres at 10 battlefields of the Revolutionary War or War of 1812 in six states.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.civilwar.org/preserve/saved-land Civil War Trust "Saved Land" webpage.] Accessed Jan. 4, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 8, 2018, the organization became the [[American Battlefield Trust]] comprised two divisions, the Civil War Trust and the Revolutionary War Trust.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.battlefields.org/news/national-historic-preservation-group-forms-american-battlefield-trust] [[American Battlefield Trust]] May 8, 2018 announcement, "National historic preservation ground forms American Battlefield Trust."

==Bicentennial of 1976==
{{Main|United States Bicentennial}}
The [[United States Bicentennial]] was a series of celebrations and observances during the mid-1970s that paid tribute to historical events leading up to the creation of the United States of America as an independent republic. It was a central event in the memory of the [[American Revolution#Memory|American Revolution]]. The Bicentennial culminated on Sunday, July 4, 1976, with the 200th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Capozzola, "'It Makes You Want to Believe in the Country': Celebrating the Bicentennial in the Age of Limits" in Beth Bailey &amp; David Farber, eds., ''America in the 70s'' (2004) pp 29-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
===Sons of the American Revolution===
{{Main|Sons of the American Revolution}}
The ''National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution'' ('''SAR''' or '''NSSAR''') is a [[Congressional charter|congressionally chartered]] organization based in Louisville, Kentucky. Its purpose is "maintaining and extending the institutions of American freedom, an appreciation for true patriotism, a respect for our national symbols, the value of American citizenship, and the unifying force of ''"[[e pluribus unum]]"'' that was created, from the people of many nations, coming together as one nation and one people." Sons of the American Revolution is a patriotic organization. Its members are male descendants of people who served in the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783), or who contributed to establishing the independence of the United States. The society is dedicated to perpetuating American ideals and traditions, and to protecting the U.S. Constitution. Holidays of commemoration and memorializing for [[Constitution Day (United States)|Constitution Day]] (September 17, 1787), [[Flag Day (United States)|Flag Day]] (June 14th, 1777), and [[Bill of Rights Day]] (December 15, 1791) were established through its efforts. The society was founded on April 30, 1889.&lt;ref&gt;"Sons of the American Revolution." World Book Online Reference Center. World Book, 2013. Web. 9 May 2013.

[[Image:Lorrin A. Thurston, 1892.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lorrin A. Thurston]] long  advocated annexation by the [[United States]] ]]

The '''Committee of Safety''', formally the '''Citizen's Committee of Public Safety''', was a 13-member group of the '''Annexation Club'''. The group was composed of mostly American citizens who were members of the ''[[Reform Party of the Hawaiian Kingdom|Missionary Party]]'', as well as foreign residents in the [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i]] that planned and carried out the [[overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i]] on January 17, 1893. The goal of this group was to achieve [[Annexation of Hawaii|annexation of Hawai{{okina}}i]] by the [[United States]]. The new independent [[Republic of Hawaii|Republic of Hawai{{okina}}i]] government was thwarted in this goal by the administration of President [[Grover Cleveland]], and it was not until 1898 that the United States Congress approved a joint resolution of annexation creating the U.S. [[Territory of Hawaii|Territory of Hawai{{okina}}i]].

==Formation==

The Committee of Safety originated from a leadership group when members of the Missionary Party began to run as Independent Party candidates. For the elections of 1884 the Missionary Party strictly ran all candidates as Independent Party candidates. To ensure that Missionaries were on the Independent ticket the “Committee of Nine” was formed April 16, 1883, to assume the leadership position of the Independent Party. The Committee of Nine were staunchly loyal to the Missionary Party, having social and economic philosophies that reflected the Missionary values. The Independent Party won 13 seats and was the minority party in the Hawaii legislature. For the following elections of 1886 the committee reconvened, this time calling themselves the “Committee of Thirteen” due to the change in members. Their intent was to make the Independent Party the majority party in the legislature. At the end of the elections the Independents won ten seats, a net loss of three seats.

==Hawaiian League==

In January 1887 the Committee of Thirteen formed a [[secret society]] called the Hawaiian League. No official records were kept, but [[Lorrin A. Thurston]] (the grandson of American missionaries [[Asa Thurston]] and [[Lorrin Andrews]]) drafted the group's constitution. The group was headed by an executive committee of lawyers and businessmen mostly of non-aboriginal non-indigenous naturalized United States citizens. Membership grew through the year, including some German and British citizens, and a few [[Hapa haole|part-Hawaiians]].
Although the politicians changed the name of their party from "Missionary" to "Reform", many wanted to become part of the [[United States]], not just reform the monarchy.&lt;ref name="kingdom3"&gt;{{cite book |title=Hawaiian Kingdom 1874-1893, the Kalakaua Dynasty |author= [[Ralph Simpson Kuykendall]] |url= http://www.ulukau.org/elib/cgi-bin/library?c=kingdom3&amp;l=en |volume=3 |publisher= University of Hawaii Press |date= 1967 |isbn= 978-0-87022-433-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|347–350}} 
This was why the Hawaiian League was also called the Annexation Club, although not often in public. 

The Hawaiian League came into control of the [[Honolulu Rifles]].  Made of about 200 armed local (non-native) men, who fought under the command of enthusiastic annexationist [[Volney V. Ashford]].&lt;ref name="kingdom3"/&gt;{{rp|352–353}}
In June 1887, the Hawaiian League used the Rifles to force [[Kalākaua|King Kalākaua]] to enact the [[Bayonet Constitution]] which limited his power. 
After [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]] came to power in 1891, she attempted to restore power to the throne. This caused the group to act again.

The precipitating event&lt;ref name="kingdom3"/&gt;{{rp|582 }} leading to the overthrow was the attempt by Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani to promulgate a new constitution which would have strengthened the power of the monarch relative to the legislature in which Euro-American business elites held disproportionate power, a political situation that was a direct result of the 1887 constitution. The conspirators' stated  goals were to depose the queen, overthrow the monarchy, and seek Hawaii's annexation to the United States.&lt;ref name="kingdom3"/&gt;{{rp|353,587–88  }}

On January 16, the Marshal of the Kingdom [[Charles B. Wilson]] was tipped off to the imminent planned coup. Wilson requested warrants to arrest the 13-member Committee of Safety, and put the Kingdom under [[martial law]]. Because the members had strong political ties with United States Government Minister [[John L. Stevens]], the requests were repeatedly denied, fearing if approved, the arrests would escalate the situation. After a failed negotiation with Thurston,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Twombly | first = Alexander  | authorlink = Alexander Stevenson Twombly | title = Hawaii and its people | publisher = Silver, Burdett and company | year= 1900 | isbn = | page = 333 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson began to collect his men for the confrontation. Wilson and Captain of the [[ʻIolani Barracks|Royal Household Guard]], [[Samuel Nowlein]], had rallied a force of 496 men who were kept at hand to protect the Queen.

The Revolution ignited on January 17 when a policeman was shot and wounded while trying to stop a wagon carrying weapons to the Honolulu Rifles. The Committee of Safety feared the shooting would bring government forces to rout out the conspirators and stop the coup before it could begin. The Rifles garrisoned [[Ali'iolani Hale]] across the street from [[ʻIolani Palace]] and waited for the queen’s response. 

As these events were unfolding, the Committee of Safety expressed concern for the safety and property of American residents in Honolulu.  United States Government Minister [[John L. Stevens]], advised about these supposed threats to non-combatant American lives and property&lt;ref&gt;Kinzer, S. (2006) America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq. p. 30. [Minister Stevens] "certainly overstepped his authority when he brought troops ashore, especially since he knew that the 'general alarm and terror' of which the Committee of Safety had complained was a fiction."&lt;/ref&gt; by the Committee of Safety, obliged their request and summoned a company of uniformed U.S. Marines from the {{USS|Boston|1884|6}} and two companies of U.S. sailors to land on the Kingdom and take up positions at the U.S. Legation, Consulate, and Arion Hall on the afternoon of January 16, 1893. 162 sailors and [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] aboard the [[USS Boston (1884)|USS ''Boston'']] in Honolulu Harbor came ashore well-armed but under orders of neutrality. The sailors and Marines did not enter the Palace grounds or take over any buildings, and never fired a shot, but their presence served to intimidate royalist defenders. Historian William Russ states, "the injunction to prevent fighting of any kind made it impossible for the monarchy to protect itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= William Adam Russ  | title = The Hawaiian Revolution (1893-94) | publisher = Associated University Presses  | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-945636-43-1 | page = 350 }} &lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the Queen's desire "to avoid any collision of armed forces, and perhaps the loss of life" for her subjects and after some deliberation, at the urging of advisers and friends, the Queen ordered her forces to surrender. The Honolulu Rifles took over government buildings, disarmed the Royal Guard, and declared a  [[Provisional Government of Hawaii|Provisional Government]].

The Committee of Safety issued the following proclamation, read aloud on January 17 by its Chairman [[Henry E. Cooper]] to a large crowd assembled in front of the royal residence  [[Iolani Palace|{{okina}}Iolani Palace]]:&lt;ref&gt;Westervelt, William Drake, "Hawaiian Historical Legends", Forgotten Books Easy Reading Series, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"First - The Hawaiian monarchial system of government is hereby abrogated.

Second - A [[Provisional Government of Hawaii|Provisional Government]] for the control and management of public affairs and the protection of public peace is hereby established, to exist until terms of union with the United States of America have been negotiated and agreed upon".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Hawaiian League unofficially adopted the [[American Flag]] to appeal to the US and promote annexation. The flag was raised over ʻIolani Palace by Stevens on January 17, 1893. The flag was eventually lowered by [[James H. Blount]] that April for spreading a false presumption that the US had taken control.

==International response==
During the overthrow, the [[Japan]]ese Imperial Navy gunboat ''Naniwa'' was docked at Pearl Harbor. The gunboat's commander, [[Heihachiro Togo]], who later commanded the Japanese battleship fleet at [[Battle of Tsushima|Tsushima]], refused to accede to the Provisional Government's demands that he strike the colors of the Kingdom, but later lowered the colors on order of the Japanese Government. Along with every other international legations in Honolulu, the Japanese Consulate-General, Suburo Fujii, quickly recognized the Provisional Government as the legitimate successor to the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://morganreport.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=1102-1127#SWORN_STATEMENT_OF_ROSWELL_RANDALL_HOES. The Morgan Report, p1106-1107], "The receipt of your communication, dated the 17th instant, inclosing a copy of proclamation issued on the same day, informing me that for reasons set forth in said proclamation the Hawaiian monarchy has been abrogated and a Provisional Government established, which is now in possession of the Government departmental buildings, the archives, and the treasury, and requesting me on behalf of H. I. J. M.'s Government to recognize said Provisional Government as the de facto Government of the Hawaiian Islands, pending the receipt of instructions from H. I. J. M.'s Government, to whom advices of your action and of the position which I have taken in relation thereto have been despatched."&lt;/ref&gt;

Every government with a diplomatic presence in Hawaii recognized the Provisional Government within 48 hours of the overthrow, including the United States, although the recognition by the United States government and its further response is detailed in the section above on "American Response". Countries recognizing the new Provisional Government included Chile, Austria-Hungary, Mexico, Russia, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Spain, Japan, Italy, Portugal, Great Britain, Denmark, Belgium, China, Peru, and France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://morganreport.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=1103-1111 The Morgan Report, p 1103-1111]&lt;/ref&gt; When the Republic of Hawaii was declared on July 4, 1894, immediate recognition was given by every nation with diplomatic relations with Hawaii, except for Britain, whose response came in November 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}} "The provisional government, whatever its faults, had had little difficulty in obtaining recognition, even from Cleveland, and it was not considered likely that the republic would have any foreign problems. Recognition came even more quickly than it had in 1893, for at least there was no question of a revolution's having taken place or of the government's control of the domestic situation."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:D-CON.jpg|thumb|Poster by Yibao Gao outside of D-CON 2010]]
D-CON was founded by Kieran Baxter, Sarah Dargie, Yibao Gao  and Jamie Keddie in late 2008. It first ran on 28 February 2009 and attracted 350 guests. This made it the highest attended anime convention in Scotland, followed closely in numbers by another Scottish convention, Auchinawa.

The second D-CON was held on 6–7 March 2010, where over 2000 guests attended the convention in the course of the weekend.&lt;ref name=dcon2&gt;{{cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = D-Con Press and Journal  | url=http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/1635940 | accessdate = 2010-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Video-gaming companies, [[Gamestation]] and [[Realtime Worlds]], sent representatives to the event to give talks. An early showing of ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'' was also given in the gaming room.

D-CON 2011 saw a higher attendance again. A preview of the Nintendo 3DS was given as well as [[Kendo]] demonstrations along with many other events similar to the previous 2010 event.

A gap year was taken in 2012 with the president, Jamie Keddie, and co-founders agreeing to return in 2013.

The '''Digital Equipment Computer Users' Society''' ('''DECUS''') was an independent [[computer user group]] related to [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC).

The [[Connect (users group)|Connect User Group Community]], formed from the consolidation in May, 2008 of DECUS, [[Encompass]], [[HP-Interex]], and [[ITUG]] is the [[Hewlett-Packard]]’s largest user community representing more than 50,000 participants.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
DECUS was the '''Digital Equipment Computer Users' Society''', a [[users' group]] for [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] computers. Members included companies and organizations who purchased DEC equipment; many members were [[application programming|application programmers]] who wrote code for DEC machines or [[system programming|system programmers]] who managed DEC systems. DECUS was founded in March 1961 by [[Edward Fredkin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://discover.lib.umn.edu/cgi/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=umfa;cc=umfa;rgn=main;view=text;didno=cbi00150 | title=Digital Equipment Computer Users Society Proceedings and Publications, 1962-1992. Finding Aid. | work=University of Minnesota Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/decus/confProceedings/DECUS_1963.pdf |title=DECUS Proceedings 1963 PDF File |date=1963 |accessdate=29 June 2016 |work=Digital Equipment Computer Users Society (DECUS)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DECUS was legally a part of [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] and subsidized by it; however, it was run by volunteers. Digital staff members were not eligible to join DECUS, yet were allowed and encouraged to participate in DECUS activities. Digital, in turn, relied on DECUS as an important channel of communication with its customers.

DECUS had a software library which accepted orders from anyone, distributing programs submitted to it by people willing to share. It was organized by processor and operating system, using information submitted by program submitters, who signed releases allowing this and asserting their right to do so. The DECUS library published catalogs of these offerings yearly, though because it had the catalog mastered by an outside firm, it did not have easy ways to retrieve the content of early catalogs (prior to circa 1980) in machine readable format. Later material was maintained in house and was more easily edited. The charges for copying were somewhat high, reflecting the fact the copies were made by hand on DECUS equipment.

There were two DECUS US symposia per year, in which members and DEC employees gave presentation, and could visit an exhibit hall containing many new computer models and peripherals among other things. By grace of the DEC employees, it became a custom to allow users to copy media for one another on these machines. This activity grew with time, and in the spring of 1977 some volunteers from the RSX SIG (Special Interest Group) led by Phil Cannon, Jim Neeland, and several others, arranged an informal drop-off, and made master distributions of all material submitted. Then they and other volunteers essentially made copies of this master distribution on
tapes for the rest of the symposium, for anyone with a blank tape to write on. This very quickly grew, getting noted in LUG (local user group) and SIG (special interest group) newsletters, and the process of creating a master quickly attracted others who would make a master index of whatever had been submitted. The process of physically creating master tapes remained much the same until around 1979 when the tapecopy coordinators arranged copying facilities somewhere near the symposium site, as 9 track tape drives were not appearing as much on the exhibit hall floor enough to rely on by then. By fall 1979, there was a release form used with submissions, so that the DECUS library could distribute the combined tapes, making them more easily available to those who did not get to the symposia. The VAX/VMS SIG started producing SIG tapes in spring 1979 and other SIGs, notably RSTS, RT-11, Languages and Tools, and the 10/20 SIGs, had analogous distributions made in somewhat similar fashion. The distribution by copying only at the symposium was seen to be inadequate, so a tree of people, each of whom would receive a copy of the material and make copies for others, was devised. In these cases the person desiring the material was expected to furnish blank media, as no money ever changed hands. The tapes grew in size constantly, and eventually moved to 8mm Exabyte media and to CDs, and then to DVDs. By that time nobody worried much about the cost of blanks. The RSX SIG tapes continued until 1992, when material was drying up. Some RSX material was put on VMS SIG tapes after that, and around 1987 the Languages and Tools sig tapes merged in. The distributions continued to be released twice a year until 2005, and were released yearly in 2006 and 2007 when the tapecopy coordinator who had been making masters since the mid 1980s, Glenn Everhart, passed the material on. By that time, network distribution had become good enough that media copy was no longer necessary in most places.
   The SIG tapes contain a large variety of material which has been useful as examples of prior art in patent disputes. They always favored distribution of full sources (and occasionally did not include binary-only submissions), making them match what patent examiners understand as "publication". They have always been available to anyone in the public, just more awkward for some to get at than others.&lt;ref&gt;Private communication, Glenn Everhart, tapecopy coordinator emeritus, DECUS VMS SIG&lt;/ref&gt;

The DECUS U.S. Chapter conducted technical conferences at various locations, and ran other operations like Local User Groups (LUGs) and Special Interest Groups. Chapters in other nations did likewise. DECUS also promoted the open exchange of user-developed software, largely via [[magnetic tape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/computer-science/history/pdp-11/decus/index.html | title=PDP-11 DECUS Software Index | work=The PDP-11 archives at metalab.unc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DECUS played a critical role in the development of [[computer games]] in North America in the 1970s.  The pioneering titles ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure|Adventure]]'' by [[Will Crowther]]; ''[[Baseball (Computer Game)|Baseball]]'', ''[[Dungeon (computer game)|Dungeon]]'' and ''[[Star Trek (Script Game)|Star Trek]]'' by [[Don Daglow]] and ''[[Hunt the Wumpus]]'' by [[Gregory Yob]] provided a foundation for the games industry.  One of the first real-time interactive multi-user games, ''[[MTrek]]'' (MultiTrek), was also distributed on DECUS tapes.  Major commercial game titles including ''[[Zork]]'' and ''[[Classic Empire|Empire]]'' were first popularized by DECUS.

In the 1990s, DECUS played a significant role in integration of isolated post-Soviet scientific, technology and business communities into worldwide community.&lt;ref&gt;M.I.Trofimov, ''Computer Markets in the USSR'', in 1991 DECUS Europe Symposium, New Styles of Computing, Programme, The Hague, Holland, September 9th to 13th 1991  ,p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''First Soviet Speaker for DECUS Europe'', in 1991 DECUS Europe Symposium, Daily Mail,Symposium Roundup.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.I.Trofimov,  ''DEC Style in Computing'', Soft Market, Special Issue from Russia, Moscow: ELIAS,1992, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, [[Compaq]] acquired Digital, and DECUS became a Compaq user group.

In 2000, the DECUS U.S. Chapter incorporated as the independent user group [[Encompass]].

In 2002, [[Hewlett-Packard]] acquired Compaq, and DECUS became an HP User Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.3000newswire.com/subscribers/BrowderQA-05Nov.html|title=Q&amp;A: Kristi Browder, Leading An Offer of an Enterprise Group|website=www.3000newswire.com|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the HP user communities [[Encompass]], [[ITUG]] and [[HP-Interex|HP Interex EMEA]] consolidated to form [[Connect (users group)|Connect Worldwide]].

==Local Chapters==
Membership was organized by country. Each chapter acted as part of the worldwide Association of Hewlett-Packard User Groups. DECUS had some 7,500 members, mostly system, network, and applications specialists as well as IT Managers.

Association activities: The '''HP User Society DECUS''' promoted the exchange of information and know-how between its members, manufacturers and partners. The association supported its members in the representation of their interests against HP and partners, helped in problem solving and facilitates formation of opinion and advanced training by organizing events.

==Well-known members==
Some early and well-known members of '''DECUS''' were the late [[Terry Shannon (IT)|Terry Shannon]] and [[John R. Wisniewski]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Bombings==

===Madalla===
At least 37 people died and 57 others were injured in an attack at St. Theresa Catholic Church in [[Madalla]], a [[satellite town]] of [[Abuja]] located {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} from the city center.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; A local coordinator with the [[National Emergency Management Agency]] (NEMA) confirmed the death toll.

NEMA spokesperson Yushau Shuaibu said that the Madalla bombing occurred on the street outside the church. He added that the church, which can hold 1,000 people, was badly affected by the blast. Witnesses said that the windows of nearby houses were shattered by the explosion. Officials at the local hospital said that the condition of many injured people was serious.&lt;ref name=dna/&gt; Slaku Luguard, a NEMA coordinator, said that rescue workers found at least 25 bodies and officials were tallying the wounded in various hospitals. NEMA acknowledged that it did not have enough ambulances to help the wounded. Luguard also said that an angry crowd, which gathered at the blast site, blocked emergency workers from getting inside: "We're trying to calm the situation. There are some angry people around trying to cause problems," he said.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/26/world/africa/explosion-rips-through-catholic-church-in-nigeria.html|title= Explosions Rip Through Churches in Nigeria|date= 25 December 2011|work=New York Times|accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
;Domestic
*President [[Goodluck Jonathan]] described the incident as "unfortunate" and "an unwarranted affront on our collective safety and freedom," adding that Boko Haram would "not be (around) for ever. It will end one day." He also said that "Nigerians must stand as one to condemn them."&lt;ref name=jpost&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=250882|title=Islamists explode five bombs in Nigeria churches|date=25 December 2011|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-condemnations"/&gt;
*National Security Adviser Gen. [[Owoye Andrew Azazi]] recognised that Boko Haram was trying to provoke religious warfare among Nigerians and called on fellow Christians not to talk of retaliation against Muslims, but to question the strategic intentions of the actual perpetrators and act accordingly. He said that it is impossible to police a country as populous as Nigeria, and that the best way to defeat Boko Haram was through active citizen involvement to help the security services.&lt;ref&gt;Ahamefula Ogbu and Seriki Adinoyi, "In Jos, Christian, Muslim Leaders Seal Peace Deal," This Day Live (Lagos, Nigeria), 28 December 2011. http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/in-jos-christian-muslim-leaders-seal-peace-deal/105975/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109005017/http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/in-jos-christian-muslim-leaders-seal-peace-deal/105975# |date=9 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party]] Governor of [[Bayelsa State]] [[Timipre Sylva]] termed the attacks as "a senseless criminal behaviour by enemies of humanity. It is strange to the Nigerian character, and does not honour any faith or tradition. All men and women of conscience in Nigeria must condemn this callousness and contribute their various efforts to the collective task of stopping the mindless terror campaign. This is a time to stand together, faith with faith, nationality with nationality and culture with culture, to confront this growing threat to our nationhood and common humanity. Jesus Christ, whose birth is being celebrated this season, is a symbol of love and peace. And Mohammed, whose birth we shall also mark in the next month or two, preached peace and harmonious coexistence. It is, therefore, difficult to figure out the source of inspiration of these attackers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.momentng.com/en/news/5636/sylva-condemns-bomb-blats-cautions-against-retaliation--.html|title=Sylva condemns bomb blats, cautions against retaliation|date=26 December 2011|publisher=The Moment|accessdate=26 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120051941/http://www.momentng.com/en/news/5636/sylva-condemns-bomb-blats-cautions-against-retaliation--.html#|archive-date=20 January 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All people of goodwill, and especially all religious leaders of goodwill, should stand together in full solidarity with the victims and in unambiguous opposition to those who would kill and maim in the name of their own perverted faith. We pray for the full recovery of the injured and for the arrest and prosecution, to the full extent of the law in Nigeria, of those who planned and implemented these hate-filled, [[anti-Christian]] terrorist attacks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=ijITI2PHKoG&amp;b=2818289&amp;ct=11560019¬oc=1|title=AJC Condemns Deadly Terrorist Attacks on Churches in Nigeria|date= 25 December 2011|publisher=AJC|accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Council on American-Islamic Relations]]&amp;nbsp;– CAIR issued a statement that read: "We condemn the unconscionable and inexcusable attacks on Nigerian churches and offer sincere condolences to the loved ones of those killed or injured.

*[[Islamic Supreme Council of Canada]]&amp;nbsp;– Founder [[Syed Soharwardy]] said: "This is an extremely deplorable crime...It's not Islam. This is an un-Islamic action" On the day of Christmas this terrorism is worse of its kind. The attacks on churches while Christians were praying and celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ cannot be done by anyone who knows and follows Islam, the group said in a media release published by CTV Calgary. We remind the media and the people that the group who has claimed the responsibility, Boko Haram is a [[Wahhabi|Wahabi]] group. We do not consider these people to be the true followers of Islam. Islamic Supreme Council of Canada expresses deep sadness on the loss of innocent lives. We stand shoulder to shoulder with the worldwide Christian community in solidarity against this violence."&lt;ref name="onislam"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.onislam.net/english/news/africa/455135-world-muslims-condemn-nigeria-attacks.html|title=World Muslims Condemn Nigeria Attacks|date=26 December 2011|website=OnIslam.net|accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Muslim Council of Britain]]&amp;nbsp;– Secretary general [[Farooq Murad]] said: "There is nothing in our faith of Islam that can condone attacks on places of worship or on Christians as we have seen today. The attacks take place at the most important celebrations for Christians, it is offensive and Muslims condemn such actions. It threatens the fragile state of relations between Muslims and Christians, which has been peaceful in the past. Sectarian attacks as we have seen in Nigeria and in Iraq last week are reprehensible&amp;nbsp;– people who claim to carry out such carnage in the name of Islam are completely mistaken and are as much enemy of Muslims as anyone else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5iuIY44499owUBgKbV5fRlz5IMncA?docId=N0639171324805256090A|title= Nigeria terror attacks condemned|date= 26 December 2011|publisher= Press Association|accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fair of Lyon''' ('''{{lang-fr|Foire de Lyon}}'''; or '''''{{lang|fr|Foire internationale de Lyon}}''''') is a [[trade fair]], traditionally held in March in [[Lyon]], France. Begun as an initiative by Lyon mayor [[Édouard Herriot]] in 1916, the fair has been held in the [[Eurexpo]] convention center in [[Chassieu]] since 1985.

== History ==

[[File:Lyon - Place des Terreaux.jpg|thumb|Engraving of [[Place des Terreaux]] decorated to celebrate the Fair of Lyon, by {{Interlanguage link multi|Charles Pinet|fr}}]]

The creation of the Fair of Lyon began in 1916 through an initiative by then mayor [[Édouard Herriot]]. He decided to build a vast "Palace" to accommodate the commercial stalls that were crowding the quays and streets, and impeding traffic flow in the area. The Fair Palace was built from 1918 to 1938 on land located between the [[Rhône]] and [[Parc de la Tête d'Or]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Charles|last=Delfante|title=Cent Ans d'Urbanisme à Lyon|edition=LUGD|pp=164-165|year=1994|isbn=978-2841470044|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent construction did not adhere to the original plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsu.archi.fr/sites/default/files/nodes/document/667/files/lyon-cite-internationale.pdf|title=La Cité Internationale|website=Plate-Forme D'Observation Des Projets et Stratégies Urbaines|date=June 2006|access-date=13 January 2016|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings of the Fair Palace were ultimately destroyed to make room for the [[Cité Internationale]], leaving only the main façade of the central pavilion, now integrated into the [[Musée d'art contemporain de Lyon]]. In 1985 the fair was moved to the [[Eurexpo]] convention center in the commune of [[Chassieu]], east of the [[Metropolis of Lyon]].

{{Primary sources|date=November 2008}}
{{notability|date=April 2009}}
}}

[[Pacific Grove, California]]'s '''Feast of Lanterns''' is an annual celebration, over 100 years old, of the legend of the [[Willow pattern|Blue Willow]], a fabricated "[[China|Chinese]]" story. However, in Pacific Grove's version of the story, the fleeing couple turns into [[Monarch butterfly|monarch butterflies]] (because Pacific Grove likes to be known as "Butterfly Town, USA"), as opposed to birds, to flee the evil [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarin]].

==History==
Some type of Japanese/Chinese boat parade with lanterns did occur sometime between 1875 until 1905 with roots in the Chautauqua's Illumination Night first practiced at the original [[Chautauqua, New York]] however, currently there is no written scholarship to refer.

The Feast of Lanterns was originally developed in 1905 to spark interest in the [[Chautauqua]] Literary and Scientific Circle. Participation in the program had diminished, and organizers felt that a large closing ceremony would reinvigorate engagement with the CLSC. The festival happened annually until 1917, and then only intermittently until 1958, when the Pacific Grove City Council revived the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pgmuseum.org/archives/exhibit/feast~1.htm Pacific Grove Museum: The Feast of Lanterns]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
The Feast of Lanterns play is performed on the Saturday of the last full weekend of every July, and the small town of Pacific Grove crams onto Lover's Point Beach to watch the show. In support of the town-wide holiday, lanterns can be seen hanging on the porches of many local homes. Lantern soup and lantern pie are delicious delicacies to be found exclusively at the "Feast of Lanterns." The afternoon preceding the Feast of Lanterns, the city holds its annual Pet Parade, which circles its main street, Lighthouse Avenue.

The Feast of Lanterns holiday ends with propelled fireworks as well as unique Chinese board fireworks and lit Torei gates over Lover's Point Beach, with Queen Topaz and her peasant lover, Chang, escaping safely together.

==The Royal Court==
The Royal Court of Feast of Lanterns Princesses is a group of 4-9 high school aged girls and boys who are citizens of [[Pacific Grove, California|Pacific Grove]].The number of Princesses there are depends on how many apply. Each princess is a different gem (i.e., Princess [[Pearl]], Princess [[Tourmaline]], Princess [[Turquoise]], etc.), and they are led by the Feast of Lanterns Queen, who is known as Queen [[Topaz]]. Queen Topaz is the star of the annual skit. The boys, which have been recently allowed to participate, pose as male faux Chinese assistants or as the young character Chang in the play. The Royal Court spends their entire month of July establishing themselves in the community, visiting retirement homes, preschools, and other events while giving out their personal signed trading cards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13831">In the [[United Kingdom]], the '''Fixated Threat Assessment Centre''' ('''FTAC''') is a joint police/mental health unit set up in October 2006 by the [[Home Office]], the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] and [[Metropolitan Police Service]] to assess and manage the risk  to politicians, members of the [[House of Windsor|British Royal Family]], and other public figures from obsessive individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article1847697.ece|publisher=The Times|title=VIP 'stalker' squad set up by government|author=Joanna Bale|date=May 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal | journal = Journal of Forensic Psychiatry &amp; Psychology | title = The Fixated Threat Assessment Centre: preventing harm and facilitating care | first5 = L. | volume = 21 | pages = 1 | doi = 10.1080/14789941003596981 | year = 2010 | last1 = James | last5 = Preston | last2 = Kerrigan | first1 = D. | first2 = T. | last3 = Forfar | last4 = Farnham | first3 = R. | first4 = F. | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
The rationale for a joint police/mental health unit was the finding that the main danger of death or serious injury to politicians in Western Europe came from attacks by people suffering from a mental health illness, who had given warnings of what they might do in the form of inappropriate, harassing or threatening communications or approaches towards the politicians in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forensis.org/PDF/published/2007_TheRoleofMental.pdf|publisher=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica|title=The role of mental disorder in attacks on European politicians 1990–2004|author1=James DV |author2=Mullen PE |author3=Meloy JR |author4=Pathe´ MT |author5=Farnham FR |author6=Preston L |author7=Darnley B |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar picture was found in a study of historical attacks on the British royal family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/reprint/36/1/59|publisher=Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law|title=Attacks on the British Royal Family - The Role of Psychotic Illness|author1=David James |author2=Paul E. Mullen |author3=Michele T. Pathe´ |author4=J. Reid Meloy |author5=Frank R. Farnham |author6=Lulu Preston |author7=Brian Darnley |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate detailed study of recent inappropriate communications and approaches to members of the royal family found that 83% of the individuals concerned were suffering from [[psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forensis.org/PDF/published/2009_StalkersandHara.pdf|publisher=Psychological Medicine|title=Stalkers and harassers of royalty: the role of mental illness and motivation|author1=David James |author2=Paul E. Mullen |author3=Michele T. Pathe´ |author4=J. Reid Meloy |author5=Lulu Preston |author6=Brian Darnley |author7=Frank R. Farnham |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Similar findings have come from the United States, where Park Dietz has written: “Every instance of an attack on a public figure by a lone stranger in the United States for which adequate information has been made publicly available has been the work of a mentally disordered person who issued one or more pre-attack signals in the form of inappropriate letters, visits or statements...."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/reprint/38/3/341|publisher=Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law |title=Commentary – Approaching and stalking public figures – a prerequisite to attack|author1=Park Dietz |author2=Daniel Martell |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of FTAC in the UK is to detect such signals, to evaluate the risks involved and to intervene to reduce them. Such intervention often entails the obtaining of treatment and care for the fixated individual from psychiatric and social services and general practitioners in their town of residence.

==The Fixated==
The word ‘fixated’ in the name of the unit indicates that the main motivational drives behind the [[stalking]] of public figures are pathologically intense fixations on individuals or causes, these being obsessive pre-occupations pursued to an abnormally intense degree.&lt;ref name="Paul E. Mullen, David James, J. Reid Meloy, Michele T. Pathe´, Frank R. Farnham, Lulu Preston, Brian Darnley and Jeremy Berman 2009"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a903475075|publisher=Journal of Forensic Psychiatry &amp; Psychology|title=The fixated and the pursuit of public figures|author1=Paul E. Mullen |author2=David James |author3=J. Reid Meloy |author4=Michele T. Pathe´ |author5=Frank R. Farnham |author6=Lulu Preston |author7=Brian Darnley |author8=Jeremy Berman |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of those pursuing the Royal Family, these fixations divide between beliefs that the individual was a member of the family or married to a member of the family; that the royal personage was involved in plots to persecute them; and that the Royal Family were culpable for failing to redress a particular grievance, often delusional, with which the individual was angrily obsessed.

==Staffing and Role==
FTAC is staffed by ten police officers from the [[Metropolitan Police Service]], three full-time senior forensic nurses, a full-time senior social worker and a number of senior forensic psychiatrists and psychologists from the Barnet Enfield and Haringey NHS Trust and the Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust. FTAC receives around 1,000 referrals a year of people who have engaged in threatening or harassing communications towards politicians or the Royal Family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11259190|publisher=BBC News|title=How do the police keep an eye on VIP stalkers?|author=Chris Summers|date=September 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around half are assessed as being of low risk after initial enquiries. The remainder are investigated by FTAC staff. They may then be referred to local health services for further assessment and potential [[involuntary commitment]]. In some cases, they may be detained by police under the [[Mental Health Act 1983#Civil sections|section 136 powers]] of the [[Mental Health Act 1983]] prior to referral.

Although run by London's Metropolitan Police Service, FTAC is responsible for dealing nationally with the stalking or harassment of public figures by lone individuals.  According to its founder, David James, it attempts not only to provide protection for the subjects of obsessive attention, but also to help people with obsessions who have [[mental illness]]es that might otherwise have gone undiagnosed or untreated. The basis of the approach arises from the fact that the majority of the fixated are driven by delusional beliefs based in potentially treatable mental disorders. Treating those with evident mental illness will have an important effect in reducing the level of risk to public figures, whilst at the same time improving the health and welfare of the individuals concerned.&lt;ref name="Paul E. Mullen, David James, J. Reid Meloy, Michele T. Pathe´, Frank R. Farnham, Lulu Preston, Brian Darnley and Jeremy Berman 2009"/&gt; The strap-line on FTAC's stationery is 'Preventing Harm and Facilitating Care'.

According to a statement made in June 2007 by the then Minister of State for the Home Office Tony McNulty,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"FTAC does not detain people in psychiatric hospitals. When it encounters an individual in need of mental health care it alerts their general practitioners and psychiatrists, who then provide appropriate help under existing legislation. FTAC may make use of police powers under section 136 of the Mental Health Act 1983 to take a person who appears to be suffering from mental disorder, and in immediate need of care or control, to a place of safety. When people are removed to hospital under section 136, they are examined by a registered medical practitioner and interviewed by an approved social worker, not associated with FTAC, in order to make any necessary arrangements for their treatment or care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070625/text/70625w0068.htm|title=Daily Hansard - Written Answers - 25 Jun 2007 : Column 301W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Activity==
In a parliamentary reply made in June 2009, the Secretary of State for the Home Office David Hanson said: "Since 2006, when FTAC began operation, 246 people have been detained under the Mental Health Act following a referral from FTAC and a subsequent decision by local health services. No individual has received a custodial sentence as a result of FTAC involvement."&lt;ref name="hansard10jun2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090610/text/90610w0004.htm|title=Daily Hansard - Written Answers - 10 Jun 2009 : Column 875W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also stated that during that same period, 27 people had been conveyed to a "[[place of safety]]" by FTAC staff under section 136 of the Mental Health Act 1983.&lt;ref name="hansard10jun2009"/&gt;

FTAC published the details of its interventions in its first 100 cases in the ''Journal of Forensic Psychiatry &amp; Psychology'' in 2010. Eighty-six per cent of those assessed by FTAC were diagnosed as suffering from psychotic illness; 57% of the sample group were subsequently admitted to hospital, and 26% treated in the community. In 80% of cases, the risk level was reduced to low by FTAC intervention, the remainder of cases remaining under continued FTAC management&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In protection terms, FTAC’s activities are said to benefit the families of the fixated individuals and the general public as much as the public figures that they are hounding. This is because those close to the fixated are more regularly exposed to their irrational and threatening behaviour than the public figures they target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/cbm.769|publisher=Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health|title=Protecting the prominent? A research journey with Paul Mullen|author=David James |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding is similar to that made in the USA by Dietz and Martell in a report prepared for the National Institute of Justice: “The persons most at risk of violence from the individual mentally ill person who pursues public figures are not the public figures or those that protect them – assuming they have the necessary security arrangements - but rather the private citizens who are the family members and neighbours of the mentally disordered subject.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/6007;jsessionid=1435D130C3F9DEA26C73544A4A54C97B?keyword=mental+disorders|title=Mentally disordered offenders in pursuit of celebrities and politicians|author1=Park Elliott Dietz |author2=Daniel Allen Martell |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The setting up of FTAC was the main recommendation of the report of Fixated Research Group (FRG) which undertook a major research project on behalf of the [[Home Office]] between 2003 and 2006. This looked at inappropriate communications and approaches to members of the Royal Family, and systematically examined 8,000 files held by [[SO14]], the royalty protection division of the Metropolitan Police Service’s [[Protection Command]].
The Fixated Research Group was composed of forensic psychiatrists and psychologists from the UK, Australia and the USA, who are experts in the field of stalking. They included Paul Mullen and Michele Pathé from Australia, co-authors of ‘Stalkers and their Victims’,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cup.es/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521732413&amp;ss=fro|publisher=Cambridge University Press|title=Stalkers and their Victims, 2nd edition|author1=Paul Mullen |author2=Michele Pathé |author3=Rosemary Purcell |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and J. Reid Meloy from San Diego, editor of ''The Psychology of Stalking''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/bookdescription.cws_home/679416/description#description|publisher=Academic Press|title=The Psychology of Stalking|author=J Reid Meloy|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  series of research papers published by the group in peer-reviewed scientific journals forms the evidence base for the Fixated Threat Assessment Centre.

==Other applications of the model==
The researchers at FTAC contend that the joint police-NHS model has other possible applications within the UK, such as in police responses to stalking of ordinary people and in homicide prevention. In their view, a logical further development would be the modification of the role of NHS police-liaison psychiatric nurses, so that they become embedded in police responses at borough or county level in order to perform an enabling role, to the benefit of individual patients and of public protection.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

{{Greek economic crisis}}

A [[referendum]] to decide whether [[Greece]] was to accept the bailout conditions in the [[Greek government-debt crisis|country's government-debt crisis]] proposed jointly by the [[European Commission]] (EC), the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) on 25 June 2015, took place on 5 July 2015.&lt;ref name="Referendum announcement"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-33296839|title=Greece debt crisis: Tsipras announces bailout referendum| publisher=BBC News|date=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum was announced by [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]] [[Alexis Tsipras]] in the early morning of 27 June 2015, and ratified the following day by the [[Hellenic Parliament|Parliament]] and the [[President of Greece|President]]. It was the first referendum to be held since the [[Greek republic referendum, 1974|republic referendum of 1974]], and the only one in modern Greek history not to concern the form of government.

As a result of the referendum, the bailout conditions were rejected by a majority of over 61% to 39% approving, with the "No" vote winning in all of Greece's regions. The referendum results also forced the immediate resignation of [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] leader [[Antonis Samaras]] as party president because of the perceived negative result of the "Yes" choice, to which the conservative party and Samaras had committed themselves.&lt;ref name='samarasresigns'&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://www.ekathimerini.com/198993/article/ekathimerini/news/greek-conservative-opposition-chief-samaras-resigns|title=Greek conservative opposition chief Samaras resigns|work=Ekathimerini|accessdate=5 July 2015|date=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although winning the referendum, Finance Minister [[Yanis Varoufakis]] also resigned and was replaced on 6 July by [[Euclid Tsakalotos]].

Despite the result of the referendum, on 13 July 2015 the government of Tsipras reached an agreement with the European authorities for a [[Third Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece|3-year-bailout]] with even harsher austerity conditions as the ones rejected by the voters. This represented a "drastic turnaround" for Prime Minister Tsipras position,&lt;ref name=wsj20150708&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as he had been [[Greek legislative election, January 2015|elected in an anti-austerity platform]]. Former Finance Minister [[Varoufakis]] characterised the harshness of the deal as a new [[Treaty of Versailles]] and "Greece’s Terms of Surrender".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/varoufakis-greece-deal-new-versailles-surrender-blog-parliament/ |title=Varoufakis calls Greek deal ‘new Versailles’ |last=Brown |first=Stephen |date=15 July 2015 |website= |publisher=Politico |access-date=25 September 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July and August, Tsipras was able to get the new [[Greek government-debt crisis countermeasures#Tenth austerity package and reforms (July 2015)|austerity packages]] and the entire bailout agreement approved by the [[Hellenic Parliament|Parliament]], but had to relly in the pro-European Union opposition parties as around 40 MPs of the [[Syriza|major ruling party]] abstained or voted against the measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greek parliament approves bailout prior measures package |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-greece/greek-parliament-approves-bailout-prior-measures-package-idUSKBN0P40EO20150715|publisher=Reuters|date=15 July 2015 |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=As Greek Bailout Deal Passes, Alexis Tsipras Faces Rebellion |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/15/world/europe/greece-bailout-vote.html |publisher=The New York Times |date=14 August 2015 |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This triggered the [[Greek legislative election, September 2015|September 2015 snap election]], where Tsipras was re-elected albeit with an historical low turnout. The second Tsipras government was thus marked by an intense austerity policy in the context of the [[Third Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece|third bailout to Greece]]. The country left bailout in August 2018, though austerity policies continued after that due to pressure from European Union and IMF.

==Background==

The referendum was announced by Tsipras in the early morning of 27 June 2015.&lt;ref name="Referendum announcement"/&gt; No prior notice of the decision was given to the Eurogroup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EU taken by surprise by Greek referendum|url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/europe/69776916/eu-taken-by-surprise-by-greek-referendum|website = Stuff|accessdate = 2015-07-10|date = 29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early hours of 28 June 2015, Parliament voted on whether or not the government's proposed bailout referendum should be held, with 178 MPs (Syriza, [[Independent Greeks|ANEL]] and [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]]) for, 120 MPs (all other parties) against and two MPs abstaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Traynor|first1=Ian|last2=Hooper|first2=John|title=Greek banks to stay closed on Monday|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/28/greek-crisis-ecb-decide-emergency-funding|accessdate=6 July 2015|work=The Guardian|date=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Referendum question==
[[File:Greece 2015 referendum ballot.png|thumb|left|Ballot paper used in the referendum (ΟΧΙ = No, ΝΑΙ = Yes)]]
Voters were asked whether they approve of the proposal made to Greece by the [[Juncker Commission]], the IMF and the ECB during the [[Eurogroup]] meeting on 25 June. This proposal with a list of [http://europa.eu/rapid/attachment/IP-15-5270/en/List%20of%20prior%20actions%20-%20version%20of%2026%20June%2020%2000.pdf ''10 prior action items'']&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/attachment/IP-15-5270/en/List%20of%20prior%20actions%20-%20version%20of%2026%20June%2020%2000.pdf EU-IMF-ECB proposal with ''10 prior action items'']&lt;/ref&gt; was [http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5270_en.htm published] by the commission, but withdrawn when negotiations were abandoned shortly after.
  
The Greek government thus asked to vote on two previous documents, titled ''"[http://www.referendum2015gov.gr/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/REFORMS-FOR-COMPLETION-OF-CURRENT-PROGRAM-1.pdf Reforms For The Completion Of The Current Program And Beyond]"'' and ''"[http://www.referendum2015gov.gr/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P.S.A.pdf Preliminary Debt Sustainability Analysis]."''.&lt;ref name="documents-gr"&gt;{{el icon}} [https://www.efsyn.gr/arthro/ayto-einai-erotima-toy-dimopsifismatos Στις 5 Ιουλίου ψηφίζουμε «ναι» ή «όχι» στην πρόταση των «θεσμών»]&lt;/ref&gt; The possible answers were stated as "Not approved/No" and "Approved/Yes".&lt;ref name="parliament"&gt;{{el icon}} [http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/Enimerosi/Simera-sti-Vouli/?ilt_id=d2c5678b-a7d9-41b0-ba0c-a4c4002f9f0f Hellenic Parliament, 27 June 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tovima"&gt;{{el icon}} [http://www.tovima.gr/politics/article/?aid=717101 Αυτό είναι το ερώτημα του δημοψηφίσματος που προτείνει η κυβέρνηση]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legality concerns ==
[[Evangelos Venizelos]] from [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]] party, as well as the [[To Potami]] and [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] parties, said that the proposed referendum would be unconstitutional, as the [[Constitution of Greece|constitution]] does not allow for referendums on fiscal matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{el icon}} [http://www.emea.gr/βενιζέλος-«αντισυνταγματικό-το-δημο/450891 Βενιζέλος: «Αντισυνταγματικό το δημοψήφισμα!»]&lt;/ref&gt;  Article 44, section 2 provides for two referendum procedures, one for 'crucial national matters' (first clause) and a second for 'Bills passed by Parliament regulating important social matters, with the exception of the fiscal ones' (second clause).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/UserFiles/f3c70a23-7696-49db-9148-f24dce6a27c8/001-156%20aggliko.pdf The Constitution of Greece, Article 44, Section 2.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Syriza-led government argued the referendum was in accordance with the first clause, and therefore not unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="parliament"/&gt;

The Athens [[bar association|Bar Association]]&amp;nbsp;(DPS), which is the largest legal association in Greece, raised a range of concerns about whether the referendum law approved by the [[Hellenic Parliament]] and [[President of Greece]] was legal. They said the call of referendum and the referendum question itself, featured ''"significant problems on the validity and meaning of voting "yes"/"no" in that referendum"'', in a situation where the result of such referendum could have major importance for the future of Greece. Procedural guarantees for calling referendums provided for by law 4023/2011, as well as Constitutional requirements (Article 44, sections 2 and 3) regarding which issues could be put to a referendum, were assessed not to have been met.&lt;ref name="Legality concerns"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsa.gr/%CE%BD%CE%AD%CE%B1/%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%BA%CE%BF%CE%B9%CE%BD%CF%8E%CF%83%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%82/%CE%B1%CF%80%CF%8C%CF%86%CE%B1%CF%83%CE%B7-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%BF%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%B7%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%BF%CF%8D-%CF%83%CF%85%CE%BC%CE%B2%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BB%CE%AF%CE%BF%CF%85-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%B4%CF%83%CE%B1-%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%BF-%CE%B4%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%BF%CF%88%CE%AE%CF%86%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%BC%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82-5%CE%B7%CF%82-%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BB%CE%AF%CE%BF%CF%85-2015|title=Decision of the Board of DPS for the referendum on 5 July 2015 (Απόφαση του Διοικητικού Συμβουλίου του ΔΣΑ για το δημοψήφισμα της 5ης Ιουλίου 2015)|language=Greek|publisher=Athens Bar Association (DPS)|date=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, Bloomberg reported they had found a translation mistake in the Greek version of the "''Preliminary Debt Sustainability Analysis''" part of the Institutions "unified proposal" being put to referendum. In this part there were three debt sustainability scenarios, and under the first two the original English document concludes that "this gross financing need metric points to no sustainability issues"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iefimerida.gr/sites/default/files/eurogroupdebtanalysis.pdf Preliminary Debt Sustainability Analysis for Greece], original in English.&lt;/ref&gt; (Bloomberg's wording for the conclusion was "that there are no sustainability issues") when the country's financing needs are taken into account, while the official Greek translation published to Greek voters and sent to reporters on 29 June, was missing the word "no", so that the Greek text reads ''"there are sustainability issues"''.&lt;ref name="Translation mistake"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-01/it-s-not-all-greek-to-voters-as-key-debt-document-mistranslated|title=Key Greek Referendum Debt Document Mistranslated|publisher=Bloomberg|date=1 July 2015|first=Nikos|last=Chrysoloras}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding stressed the importance of the second concern raised by DPS, about the referendum putting ''"a pair of uncertified documents"'' to a vote, instead of what the law required, ''"a pair of certified translated documents approved by the initial issuer of the documents"''.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

=== Court ruling ===
Greece's top administrative court, the [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]], ruled on the legality of the referendum two days before it was due to be held against a claim that was submitted by private individuals and argued that the referendum could be violating the country's constitution by posing a question regarding "public finances".&lt;ref name="Legality to be judged by Council of State"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/198843/article/ekathimerini/news/greeces-top-court-to-rule-on-legality-of-referendum|title=Greece's top court to rule on legality of referendum|work=Ekathimerini.com|date=2 July 2015|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court's decision was that the referendum was within the jurisdiction of the government and that the court had no authority on the issue, thus rejecting the claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protothema.gr/politics/article/490058/apofasi-ste-dimopsifisma/|title=Κανονικά διεξάγεται το δημοψήφισμα - Το ΣτΕ απέρριψε τις αιτήσεις|work=protothema.gr|accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

=== European Commission ===
The President of the European Commission, [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], said on 29 June during a press conference on Greece that "the momentum [for finding an agreement] was destroyed unilaterally by the announcement of a referendum and by the decision to mount a 'no' campaign to reject this agreement".&lt;ref name="European Commission statement 29-06-2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-15-5274_en.htm|title=Transcript of President Jean-Claude Juncker's press conference on Greece|publisher=European Commission|date=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Commission further objected to the timing of the referendum, stressing it should have been held to allow sufficient time before 30 June 2015 deadline when the ''"20 February 2015 offer ratified by other national parliaments"''—in which Greece had been offered the prospect of completing and extending its existing bailout agreement by a new (yet to be mutually agreed) set of renegotiated terms—expired.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The Commission also objected to the approach of not choosing a referendum question reflecting the entire dimensions of the comprehensive bailout offer, which was not only about implementation of a "reform programme", but also included a €35bn investment package which it said would spur job creation along with economic growth, and included a guarantee for debt relief according to a renewal of the ''"November 2012 debt relief statement"''.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} This would ensure—conditional on the completion of the second bailout programme under its new renegotiated terms—automatic debt relief, to the extent that the Greek [[debt-to-GDP ratio]] would be reduced to levels below 124% in 2020 and 110% in 2022.&lt;ref name="European Commission statement 29-06-2015"/&gt;

The European Commission also found it strange and inappropriate, that the Greek government asked for voters' opinion on the ''"Institution's 25 June compromise proposal"'' rather than the latest ''"Institution's 26 June compromise proposal"''.&lt;ref name="European Commission statement 29-06-2015"/&gt; It said the latest ''"26 June compromise proposal"''&lt;ref name="European Commission statement 28-06-2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5270_en.htm|title=European Commission - Press release: Information from the European Commission on the latest draft proposals in the context of negotiations with Greece|publisher=European Commission|date=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; differed from the ''"25 June version"'' on several points (meeting objections tabled by the Greek government), of which one of the most significant was that the VAT rate for hotels had been reduced from 23% to 13%.&lt;ref name="European Commission statement 29-06-2015"/&gt;

The European Commission claimed that neither of the Institution's proposals, contrary to claims by the Greek government, had contained "excessive austerity", public wage cuts or pension cuts. Instead they had lowered their demand for a public budget primary surplus from the previously required 4.5%—now to be 1% in 2015 followed by a gradual increase to a level of 3.5% for 2018 and beyond—saving Greece from implementing €12bn of extra austerity measures.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Their request for a "wage reform", it said, was about conducting an [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] approved review and update of the current collective bargaining rights in the private sector (not removal of collective bargaining rights)—and implementation of a new approved wage scheme in which public workers were paid in future according to qualifications and performance (instead of clientele deals). Their "pension reform", it said, was calling for the cancellation of incentives for early retirement, along with moving to a system in which all people in Greece received pensions on the same terms (not treating some sectors more beneficially than others).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The claim by Juncker that there were no pension cuts in the proposal raised eyebrows, with ''Financial Times'' journalist Peter Spiegel tweeting that it was "simply not true".&lt;ref name='greekreporter'&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/06/29/ft-journalist-spiegel-caught-juncker-lying-about-greece/|title=FT Journalist Spiegel Caught Juncker Lying About Greece|work=Greek Reporter|accessdate=4 July 2015|date=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important elements of the proposals, the European Commission said, were: to implement a more efficient and independent Tax Collection Authority, opening up closed professions to competition (i.e. so that the Greek price for electricity—which is currently the most expensive in EU—would decline), and to implement a string of measures to ensure more social fairness (guaranteed minimum income scheme, making tax payments more proportionate to income, targeting extra saving cuts in public spending on areas with no adverse impact for average citizens—i.e. increased defense cuts, removing socially unjust favorable tax treatments of ship-owners, fighting corruption in which the focus should be "big fish" rather than "ordinary people", and safeguarding a lasting social fairness by supporting more transparency and efficiency in public administration—in particularly through establishment of a new politically-independent tax administration).&lt;ref name="European Commission statement 29-06-2015"/&gt;

Further, the European Commission signaled that the referendum question, to which they would recommend a "Yes", from its viewpoint should be understood as whether or not Greece wanted to remain part of Europe and the Eurozone, which at the present state included acceptance of receiving conditional bailout help on a set of mutually negotiated and agreed terms. The Commission claimed the biggest impediment to jobs, growth and investment at the moment in Greece, was not the contents of the Institution's bailout proposals, but instead a paralyzing uncertainty caused by the Greek government's decision to cut itself off from continued bailout support and a moratorium on implementing structural reforms. According to the Commission, this uncertainty and standstill could only be removed if Greece at the negotiating table agreed on one of the latest compromise proposals which the Institutions had tabled after accommodating a range of objections and requests tabled by the Greek government. They claimed the confidence effect of voting "Yes" to the settlement of such a deal, the predictability it would bring, together with the injection of liquidity into the economy from disbursements, would restore job creation and growth to the benefit of Greece.&lt;ref name="European Commission statement 29-06-2015"/&gt;

=== Council of Europe ===
The [[Council of Europe]] stated that the Greek referendum does not meet European standards, as voters were not given a two-week period to make up their minds, as non-binding guidelines recommend. Due to the hasty schedule, the Council of Europe was not able to send [[Election monitoring|election observers]] and the Greek government had not requested them either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/01/eurozone-greece-rights-idUSL8N0ZH3IO20150701|title=Greek referendum falls short of standards - Council of Europe|publisher=Reuters|date=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the head of the Greek delegation and vice president of the Council's parliamentary assembly, [[Dimitris Vitsas]], denied that there was any decision made by the Council of Europe and said that it was only a personal opinion expressed by the Council's general secretary, [[Thorbjørn Jagland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{el icon}} [http://www.stokokkino.gr/details.php?id=1000000000011991 Διαψεύδει ο Δημήτρης Βίτσας ότι το Συμβούλιο της Ευρώπης είναι αντίθετο με το δημοψήφισμα - stokokkino.gr]&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Tiny Kox]], the head of the Left wing in the Council's assembly supporting the same view and asking the general secretary to clarify his previous announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{el icon}} [http://www.avgi.gr/article/5680498/kox-den-uparxei-anakoinosi-tou-sumbouliou-tis-europis-gia-to-dimopsifisma Κοξ: Δεν υπάρχει ανακοίνωση του Συμβουλίου της Ευρώπης για το δημοψήφισμα avgi.gr]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{el icon}} [http://newpost.gr/post/472421/syriza-ti-leei-o-tiny-kox-gia-to-symboylio-ths-eyrwphs-kai-to-dhmopshfisma - newpost.gr]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations independent experts===
The [[United Nations Independent Expert on the Promotion of a Democratic and Equitable International Order]] and on [[human rights]] and [[international law]], [[Alfred de Zayas]] and [[Virginia Dandan]] respectively, welcomed the Greek referendum and called for international solidarity, while expressing disappointment that the IMF and the EU have failed to reach a non austerity based solution yet, and supporting that ''no treaty or loan agreement can force a country to violate the civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights of its population, nor can a loan agreement negate the sovereignty of a State''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN human rights experts welcome Greek referendum and call for international solidarity|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16170&amp;LangID=E|publisher=ohchr.org|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positions on implications of the referendum===
{{main article|Endorsements in the Greek bailout referendum, 2015}}
There has been substantial disagreement between campaigns on the implications of the referendum, and the public has interpreted it in a variety of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3945677/greece-referendum-vote/ |title=Greek Voters Confused by Referendum Wording as Vote Nears |author=Associated Press |work=TIME.com |accessdate=5 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706002849/http://time.com/3945677/greece-referendum-vote/ |archivedate=6 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tsipras has argued that a "No" vote would represent a rejection of the austerity terms demanded by the creditors, and strengthen the Greek negotiating position. Tsipras declared "On Sunday, we are not simply deciding to remain in Europe -- we are deciding to live with dignity in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.news.yahoo.com/greece-pm-urges-no-vote-live-dignity-europe-182709597.html|title=Greece PM urges 'No' vote to 'live with dignity in Europe'|date=3 July 2015|work=Yahoo News UK|accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tsipras has repeatedly rejected Greek and international warnings that a "No" vote would be perceived by Greek's main creditors as a "No" to reforms in Greece, and a "No" to remaining in the Eurozone.&lt;ref&gt;{{el icon}} [http://www.naftemporiki.gr/story/973690/al-tsipras-to-oxi-den-simainei-riksi-me-tin-europi Αλ.

Many international leaders as well as mainstream economists and media warned that if the "No" vote leads to a failure to secure continued bailout support for Greece in due time, this would likely lead to a broader Greek [[sovereign default]], a haircut on Greek bank deposits, a collapse of the banking sector, followed by an aggravated depression of the Greek economy, and a [[Greek withdrawal from the eurozone|Greek exit from the euro area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Elliot | first = Larry | last2 = Wearden | first2 = Graeme | last3 = Smith | first3 = Helena | title = Europe's big guns warn Greek voters that a no vote means euro exit | pages = | newspaper = The Guardian | location = London | date = 30 June 2015 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/29/greek-crisis-referendum-eurozone-vote-germany-france-italy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Deen | first = Mark | last2 = Fouquet | first2 = Helene | title = Hollande Says Greece’s Referendum Will Determine Euro Membership | pages = | newspaper = Bloomberg News | location = New York | date = 29 June 2015 | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-29/hollande-says-greece-s-referendum-will-determine-euro-membership}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A new local currency to replace the euro would be strongly devalued, which would decrease the purchasing power for Greeks and lead to [[inflation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-03/greek-debt-crisis-economist-explains-fallout/6592554|title=Greek debt crisis: Economist explains fallout if Greece goes back to drachma|date=3 July 2015|accessdate=3 July 2015|newspaper=abc News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/03/greece-economy-collapse-close-food-medicine-shortage|title=Greek economy close to collapse as food and medicine run short|date=3 July 2015|accessdate=3 July 2015|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/9963b74c-219c-11e5-aa5a-398b2169cf79.html#axzz3euesvmM5|title=Greek banks prepare plan to raid deposits to avert collapse|date=3 July 2015|accessdate=3 July 2015|newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eurogroup]] president Jeroen Dijsselbloem said that "in case of a 'No', Greece's (financial) situation will become exceptionally difficult...

=== Greek organisations ===
Reception by professional/societal associations in Greece:
* Technical Chamber of Greece (TCG): Had called a steering committee meeting for approval of a "Yes" recommendation statement, but had to abort their meeting when evidently a group of radical Syriza supporters (not members of the organisation) had hijacked their meeting. The TCG president said: "It is assumed that the referendum is paramount democratic choice of the people. But how is democracy strengthened when people, who obviously support the opinion of SYRIZA, come and threaten our Steering Committee not to make a decision to communicate the opinion of our association in important matters?"&lt;ref name="Reception by Greek associations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kathimerini.gr/821608/article/epikairothta/ellada/epixeirhsh-apotrophs-toy-nai-me-efodoys|title="Επιχείρηση" αποτροπής του "ναι" με εφόδους ('Enterprise' deterrence 'yes' due to raids)|language=Greek|publisher=Kathimerini|date=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his initial address, when prime minister Tsipras of the ruling Syriza party announced the plebiscite on 5 July, he recommended a "No" vote to the Greek people.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Monde'', AFP, Reuters, 28 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Most other Syriza members also supported a "No" vote.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

ANEL, the other ruling party in coalition with Syriza, announced that they were campaigning for a "No" vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =  Referendum divides coalition partner | pages = | newspaper = Ekathimerini | location =  | date = 2 July 2015 | url = http://www.ekathimerini.com/198863/article/ekathimerini/news/referendum-divides-coalition-partner }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Far-right politics|far-right]] [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] party, not being in the government, also called for a "No" vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=LIVE!

[[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]], [[To Potami]] and [[PASOK]] parties campaigned for a "Yes" vote.

[[Communist Party of Greece|KKE]] declared it was against both of the latest two versions of the cash-for-reform counter proposals being submitted to the negotiation table between Greece and its public creditors (the counter proposal of the Greek government, and the latest compromise counter proposal of the institutions), and said that it would try to change the question of the referendum, so that people can vote not only against the latest compromise counter-proposal of the Institutions but also against the latest counter-proposal of the Greek government.&lt;ref name=902Chionis&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Θ.

==Opinion polls==
According to opinion polls, since the imposition of [[capital controls]] in Greece as a result of the [[European Central Bank|ECB]]'s decision not to enlarge its [[Emergency Liquidity Assistance]] programme in Greece, there was a trend from a clear No-vote majority to a head-to-head race, or even a slight advantage for the Yes-vote, to accept the proposed bailout terms (as of 3 July 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Financial Times|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/fastft/354731/yes-edges-ahead-latest-greek-opinion-poll|title=Yes edges ahead in latest Greek opinion poll|date=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Fox News|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/07/03/poll-shows-tight-race-ahead-greece-referendum/|title=Poll shows tight race ahead of Greece referendum|date=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Before the referendum announcement===
Two opinion polls were conducted shortly before the announcement of the referendum on 27 June, and prior to the referendum question being made public. The first asked how people would vote if a debt-deal were put to a referendum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tovima.gr/politics/article/?aid=717394|title=Δημοσκόπηση: Προβάδισμα "ναι" σε δημοψήφισμα, πριν τη "βόμβα Τσίπρα"|date=28 June 2015|accessdate=29 June 2015|quote=αν η νέα επώδυνη συμφωνία παραπεμφθεί σε δημοψήφισμα, εσείς τι θα ψηφίσετε}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second whether people supported reaching an agreement with the creditor institutions or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Xinhua |url=http://www.globalpost.com/article/6597052/2015/06/28/most-greeks-want-stay-eurozone-debt-deal-lenders-survey |title=Most Greeks want stay in eurozone, debt deal with lenders: survey |date=28 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630181054/http://www.globalpost.com/article/6597052/2015/06/28/most-greeks-want-stay-eurozone-debt-deal-lenders-survey |archivedate=30 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_28/06/2015_551603|publisher=e Kathimerini|title=Greek MPs approve referendum as lenders see difficulties ahead|date=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both found support for a deal in principle.

== Results ==

== Aftermath ==

Three days following the ''no'' vote of the referendum, the Athens government "formally asked for a three-year bailout from the [[eurozone]]’s rescue fund [on 8 July 2015] and pledged to start implementing some economic-policy overhauls" beginning by mid-July 2015. European finance leaders scheduled a "crisis summit" on 12 July to consider the request.  The Greek request includes a "drastic turnaround" for Prime Minister Tsipras regarding "pension cuts, tax increases and other austerity measures."&lt;ref name=wsj20150708&gt;
{{cite news |title=Greece Requests Three-Year Bailout in First Step Toward Meeting Creditors’ Demand |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/greek-prime-minister-pledges-concrete-proposals-to-bridge-creditor-impasse-1436348229 |accessdate=10 July 2015 |work=Wall Street Journal |date=2015-07-08 |first1=Gabriele |last1=Steinhauser |first2=Tom |last2=Fairless}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The total amount of loans requested in the Greek proposal is 53.5 billion euros ({{USD|59 billion}}).  The Greek parliament approved the Prime Minister's request on Friday, 10 July, and the completed package was forwarded to the eurogroup in advance of Sunday's meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/latest-eu-economics-chief-says-greece-deal-possible-074059545.html# The Latest: Greece seeks 53.5B euros in new bailout package], accessed 10 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; On Monday, 13 July, the Syriza-led government of Greece accepted a bailout package that contains larger pension cuts and tax increases than the one rejected by Greek voters in the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/12/thisisacoup_n_7781736.html German-Led Eurozone Launching Coup Against Greek Government].

'''Idea''' was a television special starring the [[Bee Gees]] with [[Brian Auger]] and [[Brian Auger and The Trinity|The Trinity]], [[Julie Driscoll]] and Lil Lindfors. It was aired on 11 December 1968 on [[Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen]] (ZDF). The TV special was produced by [[Michèle Arnaud]] and directed by [[Jean-Christophe Averty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Bee-Gees-The-Julie-Driscoll-Brian-Auger-The-Trinity-Lil-Lindfors-Idea-TV-Special-1968/release/1517334 |title= The Idea TV Special 1968 |publisher=Discogs |accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
On 12 September 1968, the Bee Gees flew to Brussels and spent two weeks recording a television show directed by Jean-Christophe Averty to promote their album ''[[Idea (album)|Idea]]'' on French television. It features the guest appearances by Brian Auger and The Trinity, Julie Driscoll and Lil Lindfors. Swedish singer Lil Lindfors performed "[[Words (Bee Gees song)|Words]]" in her native language. The Bee Gees performed the songs from ''[[Horizontal (album)|Horizontal]]'' and ''Idea'' (1968). The special effects on "[[Indian Gin and Whisky Dry]]" to make it appear that the Bee Gees are bouncing up and down in the glasses. On "[[I Started a Joke]]" features a floating question marks.&lt;ref name="floating"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=KugbDQHX0R8C&amp;pg=PT354&amp;dq=bee+gees+brussels&amp;hl=fil&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xQUVUZOkCMOAiQeurYCADQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA |title=The Bee Gees: Tales of the Brothers Gibb |last=Hughes |first=Andrew |accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Bee Gees' stay in Brussels, the Belgian police would not allow their limousine to stop outside the hotel, The Metropole, due to a fashion show held there by French pop star [[Johnny Hallyday]]'s wife [[Sylvie Vartan]]. [[Maurice Gibb|Maurice]]'s leg was injured as he attempted to get out of the car, leading to a formal complaint being filed with a chief of police by the Bee Gees' manager [[Robert Stigwood]].&lt;ref name="floating"/&gt;

'''India Fashion Week'''   is a bi-annual [[fashion week]] organized and promoted by the [[Fashion Design Council of India]]. It was sponsored by Wills Lifestyle from 2006-2014 before  Amazon.in became the sponsor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdci.org/newsdetails.aspx?nid=889|title=India Fashion Week - Sponsor Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first event in 2000 featured the work of 33 designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fashion week in India|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/884706.stm |publisher=BBC News|date=18 August 2000 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also over thirty presenters at the Spring Fashion Week in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ramp fun begins: Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week Autumn/Winter 2013 opens today |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Fashion/Ramp-fun-begins-Wills-Lifestyle-India-Fashion-Week-Autumn-Winter-2013-opens-today/Article1-1025245.aspx |newspaper=Hindustan Times |date=12 March 2013  |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, fire permits were not secured in time for the first day events which caused an extra day to be added to accommodate the presentations that had been cancelled on the first day.&lt;ref name="2010reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/indiamasala/2010/03/29/fashion-diary-clothes-controversies-and-a-finale-that-wasnt/|title=Fashion diary – clothes, controversies and a finale that wasn’t|last=David Lalmalsawma|date=29 March 2010|work=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''June Events''' are alternatives to [[May Ball]]s held by some [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] colleges.

The necessarily high price of [[May Ball]] tickets motivates some colleges to host Events instead.{{fact|date=June 2010}} These evenings, tending to be shorter in duration and of a much lower key, are more affordable but constrained by a much lower budget. 

==Alternation==
Some colleges chose to alternate between a May Ball and a June Event each year.{{fact|date=June 2010}} [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel College]]'s May Ball is held in May Week every other year, with alternate years featuring an Event on [[Suicide Sunday]].{{fact|date=June 2010}}

In 2006, members of the College voted in favour of restoring [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]]'s lost tradition of hosting a May Ball for 2007.{{fact|date=June 2010}} In 2008 they will hold another June Event.

The '''Late November 1984 [[Nor'easter]]''' occurred on the United States' [[Thanksgiving|Thanksgiving Day]], November 22, 1984. A deep [[extratropical cyclone]] located just off the shore of Florida led to significant beach erosion and the grounding of the freighter ''Mercedes I'' for several months along the coastal town of [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;Vanderbilt University Television News Archive. [http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=87852 Headline: Florida / Grounded Freighter.] Retrieved on November 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It formed unusually early, and its effects were seen unusually far south into Florida.

==Meteorological history==
When a cyclone aloft cut off from the main band of the [[Westerlies]], it spurred [[cyclogenesis]] in the [[Florida Straits]] by November 22, which led to a [[nor'easter]] at an unusually southern latitude near the [[Bahamas]]. The surface cyclone slowly traveled through the [[Florida Straits]] up the [[Gulf Stream]] between Florida and the Bahamas before drifting back out to sea. The storm attempted to gain some central convection during several periods of its life cycle. It was at its most intense on November 23 and November 24, with a central pressure near 1005&amp;nbsp;[[pascal (unit)|hPa]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Commerce. [http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/dwm/1984/19841119-19841125.djvu Daily Weather Maps:  November 19- November 25, 1984.] Retrieved on November 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cyclone moved far enough to the east to allow winds and seas to subside on November 26.  There is some evidence that it may have become a subtropical cyclone around November 28, while located in the vicinity of [[Bermuda]].&lt;ref&gt;Danielle Manning and Robert Hart. [http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/108582.pdf Using ERA40 in Cyclone Phase Space to Refine the Classification of Historical Tropical Storms.] Retrieved on November 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is why the system is considered the 19th tropical depression of the 1984 Atlantic hurricane season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/newhurdat-all.html|title=HURDAT2 Atlantic Hurricane Database|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|author=[[Hurricane Research Division]]|date=November 2012|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, wind and high seas were the storm's main impact due to the strong pressure gradient between the cyclone's center and a 1040&amp;nbsp;hPa surface high over the [[Ohio Valley]]. Winds as high as {{convert|58|mph|km/h}} with swells of up to {{convert|20|ft|m}} were reported by ships in the eastern [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Along the Atlantic coast, winds reached {{convert|58|mph|km/h}} at [[Vero Beach, Florida|Vero Beach]], {{convert|55|mph|km/h}} at [[Melbourne, Florida|Melbourne]], {{convert|46|mph|km/h}} at [[Titusville, Florida|Titusville]], and {{convert|44|mph|km/h}} at [[Cocoa Beach, Florida|Cocoa Beach]]. Offshore the Atlantic coast, seas also reached {{convert|20|ft|m}}. Coastal erosion took its toll between [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] and Palm Beach during the three-day storm, which eventually subsided on November 26. About five-sixths of a new pier at St. Augustine was destroyed. Erosion from this cyclone would be the worst experienced in southern [[Brevard County, Florida|Brevard County]] until [[Hurricane Frances]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Florida Department of Environmental Protection.

Later that day, flurries were witnessed across the [[Florida Panhandle]] in its wake.  A frontal wave which became a powerful [[Christmas 1994 Nor'easter]] moved across Florida, bringing windy and rainy conditions to the state.

In [[Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]], '''Liberation Day''' ([[Jèrriais]]: ''Jour d'la Libéthâtion'') is celebrated each year on 9 May, to mark the end of the [[Occupation of the Channel Islands|occupation by Nazi Germany]] during World War II. It is celebrated as Guernsey and Jersey's national day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/jersey/8533765.stm |title=Jersey 'lieu day' motion for Sunday Liberation Day |publisher=BBC News |date=24 February 2010 |accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|Liberation of the German-occupied Channel Islands}}
[[File:Jour d'la Libéthâtion Jèrri 9 d'Mai 2011 065.jpg|thumb|left|Re-enacting the raising of flags on Liberation Day 2011]]
On 9 May 1945, [[HMS Bulldog (H91)|HMS ''Bulldog'']] arrived in [[St Peter Port]], Guernsey, and the German forces surrendered unconditionally aboard the vessel at dawn. British forces landed in St Peter Port shortly afterwards, greeted by crowds of joyous but malnourished islanders singing, amongst other patriotic songs, "Sarnia-Cherie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prGeoO4bgUw |title=Sarnia Chérie (Guernsey anthem) - Sung on Liberation Day in 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same day, {{HMS|Beagle|H30|6}}, which had set out from [[Plymouth]], arrived in [[Jersey]] to accept the surrender of the occupying forces there. Two naval officers, Surgeon Lieutenant Ronald McDonald and Sub Lieutenant R Milne, were met by the Harbour Master, who escorted them to his office where they together hoisted the [[Union Flag]], before also raising it on the flagstaff of the Pomme D'Or Hotel. This has been re-enacted every year on Liberation Day since 1995. From 2003 to 2011 Harbour Master and Jerseyman Captain Howard Le Cornu performed this annually. His father, John E. Le Cornu, and uncle, David M. Le Cornu, had been in the crowds and had witnessed the occasion on 9 May 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-jersey-13336914 |title=Jersey youth vital to Liberation Day – Bailiff |date=9 May 2011 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-jersey-13338561 |title=Jersey celebrates Liberation Day anniversary |publisher=BBC News |date=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sark was liberated on 10 May 1945, and the German troops in Alderney surrendered on 16 May 1945.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

==Official status==

The Public Holidays and Bank Holidays (Jersey) Act 1952 established Liberation Day as a public holiday if it fell on a weekday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Holidays and Bank Holidays (Jersey) Act 1952|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fhtm%2fROFiles%2fR%26O3000-3999%2fJersey_R_%26_O_3038.htm|accessdate=13 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808043848/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2Fhtm%2FROFiles%2FR&amp;O3000-3999%2FJersey_R_&amp;_O_3038.htm|archivedate=8 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Public Holidays and Bank Holidays (Jersey) Act 2010 further laid down that Liberation was also to be a public holiday if it falls on a Saturday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Holidays and Bank Holidays (Jersey) Act 2010|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f15%2f15.560.20_PublicHolidaysandBankHolidaysAct2010_RevisedEdition_1January2012.htm|accessdate=13 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808043851/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2Fconsolidated%2F15%2F15.560.20_PublicHolidaysandBankHolidaysAct2010_RevisedEdition_1January2012.htm|archivedate=8 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not a public holiday, and no day off in lieu is provided, if it falls on a Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=States of Jersey Official Report|url=http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/Pages/Hansard.aspx?docid=4787a29e00a6babd61bafe7642095881_StatesAssembly&amp;qtf_teaser:query=AND(bcalcontent.bidxcontentlvl1:%22liberation%22,ANY(bcalcontent.bidxcontentlvl1:%22day%22,bcalcontent.bidxcontentlvl1:%22days%22))#_Toc274307186|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceremonies==
[[File:Jour d'la Libéthâtion Jèrri 9 d'Mai 2012 35.jpg|thumb|Bailiff, Lieutenant-Governor and other officials in procession on Liberation Day 2012]]
Since the 50th anniversary of Liberation in 1995, a pattern of official ceremonies has developed based in and around Liberation Square in [[Saint Helier]] where the events at the Harbour Master's Office and Pomme D'Or Hotel occurred in 1945. Following a special sitting of the [[States of Jersey]] in the morning, States Members, clergy, the [[Bailiff of Jersey]], the [[Lieutenant-Governor of Jersey|Lieutenant-Governor]], [[Jurat]]s, Crown Officers and other officials process from the Royal Square to Liberation Square accompanied by the Royal Mace and the Bailiff's Seal. An open air ecumenical service takes place in Liberation Square followed by the singing of "Man Bieau P'tit Jèrri"/"Beautiful Jersey" (in Jèrriais and English) and a re-enactment of the raising of flags (including that at [[Fort Regent]]). A parade of vintage and military vehicles, bands and service organisations is reviewed by the official party.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

The afternoon community celebrations are of an informal character, including a programme of entertainments and stalls in Saint Helier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/jersey/8670959.stm |title=Jersey islanders mark Liberation Day |publisher=BBC News |date=9 May 2010 |accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An official ceremony also takes place at the Crematorium where there is a memorial to victims and slave workers of various nationalities. Representatives of affected nationalities take part in the commemoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Never forget the price of freedom|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/news/2012/05/10/never-forget-the-price-of-freedom/|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canadian blues festivals''' range from small, community-based festivals that feature mostly local performers to major corporate-sponsored festivals that draw nationally  and internationally prominent blues bands and huge crowds. Some of the large festivals include the [[Ottawa Bluesfest]], Bluesfest Windsor, the [[Harvest Jazz &amp; Blues Festival]] in [[Fredericton]], New Brunswick, Tremblant International Blues Festival in [[Mont-Tremblant]], [[Quebec]] and the [[Edmonton's Labatt Blues Festival]]. These festivals, which are usually organized by volunteer-based blues societies, are an important part of the [[Canadian blues]] scene.

The following is a '''list of ongoing armed conflicts''' that are taking place around the world and continue to result in violence.

==List guidelines==
This list of ongoing armed conflicts is for the sole purpose of identifying present-day conflicts and the death toll associated with each conflict. The guidelines of inclusion are:
* Armed conflicts consist in the use of armed force between two or more organized armed groups, governmental or non-governmental alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How is the Term "Armed Conflict" Defined in International Humanitarian Law?|url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/opinion-paper-armed-conflict.pdf|website=International Committee of the Red Cross|date=March 2008|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interstate, intrastate and non-state armed conflicts are listed.
* Fatality figures include battle-related deaths (military and civilian) as well as civilians intentionally targeted by the parties to an armed conflict. Only direct deaths resulting from violence are included for the current and past year; excess deaths indirectly resulting from famine, disease and disruption of services are included along with violent deaths only in the cumulative fatalities count, when available.''
* Listed conflicts are at least 100 cumulative deaths in total and at least 1 death in current or past calendar year.
* Fatality totals may be underestimated or unavailable due to a lack of information. A figure with a plus sign indicates that at least that many people have died (e.g. 455+ indicates that at least 455 people have died) – the actual toll could be higher.
* Location refers to the state(s) where the main violence takes place, not to the warring parties. Italics indicate disputed territories and [[list of states with limited recognition|unrecognized states]]''.
* Only states with ongoing military activity are listed, past states and states where conflicts are no longer active are omitted.
* Military conflicts that no longer produce deaths are not listed here, but can be found in the historical [[list of wars]] and the [[list of wars extended by diplomatic irregularity]].

The '''Manoel Theatre''' ({{lang-mt|It-Teatru Manoel}}; {{lang-it|Teatro Manoel}}) is a [[theatre]] and important performing arts venue in [[Malta]]. The theatre is often referred to as simply '''"The Manoel"''', and is named after [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master]] of [[Knights Hospitaller|the Order of the Knights Hospitaller]], [[António Manoel de Vilhena|Fra António Manoel de Vilhena]], who ordered its construction in 1731. The theatre is reputed to be Europe's third-oldest working theatre (older than the San Carlo in Naples), and the oldest theatre still in operation in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].&lt;ref name=VLH&gt;{{cite web|title=Manoel Theatre|url=http://www.maltaattraction.com/content.aspx?id=199484|publisher=Valletta - Living history|accessdate=1 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217231601/http://www.maltaattraction.com/content.aspx?id=199484|archivedate=17 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre is located on Old Theatre Street ([[Maltese language|Maltese]]: ''Triq it-Teatru l-Antik'') in [[Valletta]]. It considers itself as the country's national theatre and the home of [[Malta Philharmonic Orchestra]] ([[Maltese language|Maltese]]: ''Orkestra Filarmonika Nazzjonali'').&lt;ref name=VLH/&gt; Originally called the ''Teatro Pubblico,'' its name was changed to ''Teatro Reale,'' or Theatre Royal, in 1812, and renamed ''Manoel Theatre'' in 1866. The first play to be performed was [[Francesco Scipione, marchese di Maffei|Maffei]]'s [[Merope (Messenia)#Maffei.27s Merope|Merope]]. 

The theatre is a small, 623 seat venue, with an oval-shaped [[auditorium]], three tiers of boxes constructed entirely of wood, decorated with gold leaf, and a pale blue [[trompe-l'oeil]] ceiling that resembles a round cupola. The building is a Grade 1 [[listed building]] as noted by Malta's Superintendence of Cultural Heritage, and is also scheduled by the [[Malta Environment and Planning Authority]] (MEPA).&lt;ref name=Sup&gt;{{cite web|title=National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands|url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/01140.pdf|publisher=Superintendence of Cultural Heritage|accessdate=28 February 2014|date=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the construction of the theatre, plays and amateur theatrical productions were staged in the halls and ''[[piano nobile]]s'' of the Knights' auberges. These were palaces constructed for the ''[[Langue (Knights Hospitaller)|langues]]'' of the Order. The Langue of Italy often held such entertainment, staged by its knights in their Auberge. The records of the Langue even state that on February 2, 1697, some Maltese gentlemen presented a play in the ''[[Auberge d'Italie]].'' Women were prohibited from attending these events after incidents during the Carnival festivities of 1639.

In 1731, [[António Manoel de Vilhena]] commissioned and personally funded the construction of the building to serve as a public theatre "''for the honest recreation of the people.''"{{refn|group=n|This phrase was inscribed above the main entrance to the theatre,&lt;ref name=FacR&gt;{{cite news|title=Manoel Theatre façade to be restored|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2013-09-26/news/manoel-theatre-facade-to-be-restored-2727215104/|accessdate=1 March 2014|newspaper=The Malta Independent|date=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which still reads to this today: "''Ad honestam populi oblectationem.''"{{la icon}} }} The Grand Master bought two houses from the Priory of [[Navarre]], with a frontage on what is now Old Theatre Street for the sum of 2,186 ''scudi''.{{refn|group=n|Vilhena also paid a further 2,000 ''scudi'' for the reconstruction of the Navarrese knights' two remaining houses, which then became known as the New Priory of Navarre.&lt;ref name=RMK&gt;Repertorio Fondazione Manoel, R.M.K. Treas. A. 25 fo. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;}} It has a plain [[façade]], in keeping with Valletta's [[Mannerism (architecture)|Mannerist]] style, and has three floors with a [[mezzanine]]-level above the ground floor. The façade incorporates a doorway surmounted by a stone balustraded open balcony, itself supported by three heavy scroll corbels.&lt;ref name=Sup/&gt; The interior is decorated in [[Rococo]] style. The theatre was possibly designed by [[Romano Carapecchia]], and was built by [[Francesco Zerafa]] and Antonio Azzopardi.&lt;ref name=Sup/&gt;

Construction was finished in only ten months. This however, may be because alterations were made to the fabric of the three adjoining houses, incorporating them into a theatre. The building occupied an area of 94½ [[Maltese units of measurement|square canes]],{{refn|group=n|{{convert|496.31|sqyd|m2|lk=in|sigfig=3}}}} which was later altered to 93 square canes and 2½ palms.{{refn|group=n|{{convert|488.64|sqyd|m2|lk=in|sigfig=3}}}}&lt;ref name=Denaro/&gt; The theatre is said to have been modelled after the contemporary [[Palermo]] Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Scicluna, Sir Hannibal P., "Buildings and Fortifications of Valletta", in ''Malta and Gibraltar''; London, W.H. &amp; L. Collingridge, at p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; Its auditorium was originally semi-circular or horseshoe shaped, with an illuminated parterre that served as a small dance floor. The first theatrical performance to be staged at the ''Teatro Pubblico'' was Scipione Maffei's classic tragedy ''Merope'', on January 9, 1732.&lt;ref&gt;''Compendio del Giornale del Sac. Fra. Gaetano Rebout. R.M.L.'', Ms. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The actors in that production were the Knights themselves, and the set was designed by the Knights' chief military architect, Francois Mondion.&lt;ref name=Wix/&gt;

On January 26, 1732 a satirical and anti-clerical play "''Il bacchettiere falso''" by Girolamo Gigli was performed. On January 18, 1769, the play "Il trionfo di Minerva", by Lentisco Adrasteo was presented on the occasion of [[Manuel Pinto da Fonseca|Grand Master Manuel Pinto da Fonseca]]'s birthday.&lt;ref name=Wix/&gt; A similar honour was also given to [[Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim]], on his elevation as Grand Master. On this occasion, Hompesch appeared on the balcony thanking the crowd, showering handfuls of gold coins on the people that had gathered to applaud.&lt;ref name=Wix&gt;{{cite web|title=The Opera Page|url=http://czh227.wix.com/the-opera-page#!page-2|publisher=Wix.com|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the next half-century, it was the venue for an extensive repertoire of lyric operas performed by companies of visiting professionals or by amateur groups of knights, and French tragedies or Italian comedies. Works by [[Johann Adolf Hasse]], [[Niccolò Piccinni]] and Baldassare [[Galuppi]] were extremely popular at the theatre during its early years.

In its early days, the management of the theatre, and censorship of its performances, was entrusted to a senior knight, known as the ''Protettore.''&lt;ref name=BEG&gt;{{cite web|title=The Beginning|url=http://www.teatrumanoel.com.mt/?m=content&amp;id=135|publisher=Teatru Manoel|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded [[impresario]] was Melchiorre Prevvost Lanarelli in 1736, and the last Giovanni Le Brun in 1866. From 1768 to 1770 the impresario was a woman, Natala Farrugia.&lt;ref name=BEG /&gt; In setting up the theatre, Grand Master de Vilhena set the rent to be paid by the impresario at 320 ''scudi'' per annum, of which 80 accrued for rent from [[Easter]] to August, 120 for autumn, and another 120 ''scudi'' from [[Christmas Island|Christmas]] to [[Carnival]]. When dances or ''veglioni'' ([[masked ball]]) were held in the theatre, the pit was raised by a scaffolding to the level of the stage. On August 22, 1778, regulations were passed for the lighting of the theatre and corridors on such occasions, with the shading of lights, in any manner, being prohibited.&lt;ref name=Denaro&gt;{{cite journal |last=Denaro |first=Victor |year=1960 |title=The Manoel Theatre |journal=Melita Historica |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1–4 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1778, to avoid scandal, theatre companies were prohibited from sleeping in the boxes of the theatre. This was a practice which was common during that time.&lt;ref name=Denaro/&gt; A few years later, in 1783, the ''Teatro Pubblico'' underwent considerable modification and decoration, based on a design by the Roman architect, Natale Marini.&lt;ref name="Sup" /&gt; A model was displayed before the [[Inquisition|inquisitor]] and many knights, and the model was so admired that the Commissioners of the Foundation of the Theatre decided to add a further two ''louis,'' as a bonus to Marini’s invoice of 49 ''scudi.''&lt;ref&gt;''Diverse Scritture relative alla Fondazione Manoel'', R.M.L., Treas. A. 32, cited by {{harvp|Denaro|1960|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manoel theatre (12843815575).jpg|thumbnail|left|The pale blue, [[trompe-l'oeil]] ceiling that resembles a round cupola.]]

[[Nicolas Isouard]]'s first known opera, ''Casaciello perseguitato da un mago,'' was performed here in 1792, and Isouard became director of this theatre in 1798, after the [[French occupation of Malta|French captured Malta]], and continued to premiere other operas there.&lt;ref name=FacR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Xuereb, The Manoel Theatre, a short history, Valletta, Friends of the Manoel Theatre&lt;/ref&gt; Several of Isouard's own works, including ''Avviso ai Maritati'' and ''Artaserse'', were performed at the Manoel during this time. French rule over Malta was short-lived and within two years the islands passed into the hands of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]]. An English gentleman who accompanied [[Battle of Alexandria|Abercrombie’s expedition to Egypt]] in 1801, wrote that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"La Valette possesses an opera, small indeed, but neat, though much out of repair. Italy and Sicily supply it with very tolerable vocal performers, and it is a very agreeable entertainment for the garrison. It was excessively crowded every night by the officers of the expedition, to whom it was a great source of amusement. The price of admission is one shilling."&lt;ref name=Egy&gt;{{cite book|last=Walsh|first=Thomas|title=Journal of the Late Campaign in Egypt: Including Descriptions of that Country, and of Gibraltar, Minorca, Malta, Marmorice, and Macri; with an Appendix; Containing Official Papers and Documents|year=1803|publisher=T.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Manoel theatre (12851453033).jpg|thumbnail|The proscenium and theatre-boxes at the Manoel.]]

During the early [[Crown Colony of Malta|British Era]], the "''Teatro Pubblico''" was renamed as the ''"Teatro Reale"'', going through a series of enlargements and re-modellings throughout the 19th century, most notably in 1812, when [[George Whitmore (British Army officer)|Sir George Whitmore]] added today's gallery and [[proscenium]], raised the ceiling by one storey, and added eight more boxes, bringing the total to 67. Whitmore also transformed the auditorium to the oval shape that it has today.&lt;ref name=Denaro/&gt; Further alterations were made in 1844, when the Manoel’s set designer, Ercolani, repainted the panels on the wooden boxes and had them gilded. Another stratum of silver leaf was added to the panels and ceiling in 1906. Throughout this time, the Teatro Reale was rented out to professional impresarios, who hosted nine-month opera seasons.&lt;ref name=Denaro/&gt; It was visited by many foreign dignitaries, including [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]], and [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|H.M. Queen Adelaide, the Queen Dowager]], widow of William IV of England, who attended performances of ''Elisir d'Amore'' and ''[[Gemma di Vergy]]'' at the theatre, during her convalescence in Malta.&lt;ref name=Denaro/&gt; ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' was given as a gala night in honour of the Queen Dowager, featuring [[soprano]] Camilla Darbois.&lt;ref&gt;Rolandi, Ulderico, "Musica e Musicisti in Malta", in ''Archivio Storico di Malta'', Vol. I, Fasc.

In 1861, the Teatro Reale was given on perpetual lease, by the government, to Dr. Salvatore Mifsud and Anacleto Conti for an annual ground rent of £236,15, and in 1862, the directum dominium was sold to Emmanuele Scicluna for £7,833.6.8.&lt;ref name=FacR/&gt;&lt;ref name=Denaro/&gt; Subsequent owners were Carmelo Arpa, a chemist (1889) and the Gollcher family (1906-7).&lt;ref&gt;Records of Notary Luigi Vella of 5 May 1861, and of 9 September 1802, cited by {{harvp|Denaro|1960|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre had fallen into disuse in 1866, as a result of the construction of Malta's new [[Royal Opera House, Valletta|Royal Opera House]], designed by [[Edward Middleton Barry]], on Strada Reale, at the entrance to Valletta. The theatre began to serve as a doss house for homeless and indigent citizens,&lt;ref name=FacR/&gt; who rented out the stalls for a few pennies a night.&lt;ref name=Denaro/&gt; However, in 1873, the ''Teatro Reale'' - was officially renamed the "''Manoel Theatre''",&lt;ref name=FacR/&gt; and it enjoyed a brief new lease on life when the Royal Opera House burnt down. But by 1877, the Royal Opera House had been rebuilt, and once more, the Manoel Theatre was eclipsed and fell again into disuse. On December 27, 1922, January 6, 1923 and February 3, 1923, the Manoel Theatre was the venue for the first public airing of Malta's National Anthem, "''[[L-Innu Malti]].''"&lt;ref name=Denaro/&gt; During the [[Second World War at Sea series|Second World War]], the Manoel Theatre served as emergency accommodation for victims of the constant bombardment by the [[Luftwaffe]] and the [[Regia Aeronautica]].&lt;ref name=FacR/&gt; In the early 20th century, it was also used intermittently as the venue for Carnival balls and, for a period of about twenty years, it operated as a [[movie theatre]].

The theatre was included on the Antiquities List of 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protection of Antiquities Regulations 21st November, 1932 Government Notice 402 of 1932, as Amended by Government Notices 127 of 1935 and 338 of 1939. |url=https://www.mepa.org.mt/file.aspx?f=2627 |website=[[Malta Environment and Planning Authority]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6guMwmZDW?url=https://www.mepa.org.mt/file.aspx?f=2627 |archivedate=20 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite numerous alterations over the years, it retains many of its old architectural features, such as the white [[Carrara marble]] staircase, shell-shaped niches, and [[Vienna|Viennese]] chandeliers. Two water reservoirs beneath the floor create an acoustic environment that is so precise, that the hushed page-turnings of an [[orchestra conductor]] can be heard clearly throughout the auditorium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anthem Guide to the Opera, Concert Halls and Classical Music Venues of Europe|year=2009|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=0857286838|page=323|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mfxgGNCV62IC|editor=Steven Isserlis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the destruction of the [[Royal Opera House, Valletta|Royal Opera House]] by [[World War II|Axis bombardment]] on April 7, 1942, the Manoel Theatre was expropriated by the [[Government of Malta]] in 1956, and was quickly restored to its former glory. It reopened in December 1960 with a performance of [[Coppélia]] by [[Ballet Rambert]].&lt;ref name=20th&gt;{{cite web|title=The 20th Century|url=http://www.teatrumanoel.com.mt/?m=content&amp;id=139|publisher=Teatru Manoel|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years the theatre [[foyer]] was enlarged by means of the annexation of the adjacent Palazzo Bonici, a grand 18th century palace that was the former home of the Testaferrata Bonnici family, however on January 9, 2007, the Constitutional Court of Malta revoked the 1958 order of possession and use in respect of this property, and ordered that the property be returned to its original owner.&lt;ref name=TOM1&gt;{{cite news|last=Cooke|first=Patrick|title=Government breached noble’s property rights|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130904/local/Government-breached-noble-s-property-rights.484738|accessdate=1 March 2014|newspaper=Times of Malta|date=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This annex currently houses the theatre's bar and restaurant.&lt;ref name=TOM1/&gt;

'''Melodifestivalen 2016''' was the 56th edition of the Swedish music competition [[Melodifestivalen]], which selected Sweden's entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016]]. The competition was organised by [[Sveriges Television]] (SVT) and took place over the six-week period between 6 February and 12 March 2016.

For the 15th consecutive year, the format of the competition consisted of six shows: four semi-final rounds, a second chance round and a final. The 28 competing entries were divided into four semi-finals, with seven compositions in each. From each semi-final, the songs that earned first and second place qualified directly to the final, while the songs that placed third and fourth proceeded to the Second Chance round. The bottom three songs in each semi-final were eliminated from the competition. An additional four entries qualified from the Second Chance round to the final, bringing the total number of competing entries in the final to 12. All six shows were hosted by [[Gina Dirawi]], who was joined by guest co-hosts during each show: [[Petra Mede]] (Semi-final 1), [[Henrik Schyffert]] (Semi-final 3), [[Sarah Dawn Finer]] (Semi-final 4), [[Peter Jöback]] (Second Chance round), [[Ola Salo]] (Second Chance round) and [[William Spetz]] (Final); [[Charlotte Perrelli]] was originally announced as the guest co-host for the second semi-final, however, her role was changed to guest performer after a conflict of interest arose due to her endorsement deal with the Swedish mobile brand [[Comviq]].

An initial 28 entries were selected for the competition through three methods: an open call for song submissions, direct invitations to specific artists and songwriters and a wildcard given to one of the artists that participated in the ''Svensktoppen nästa'' competition organised by [[Sveriges Radio P4]]. Twenty-seven entries ultimately competed as one of the selected songs, "Himmel för två" to have been performed by [[Anna Book]], was disqualified prior to the start of semi-finals as it had competed in the [[Moldova in the Eurovision Song Contest 2014|2014 Moldovan Eurovision Song Contest national selection]], thus violating the rules of the competition.

"[[If I Were Sorry]]" performed by [[Frans Jeppsson-Wall|Frans]] was selected as the winner of the 2016 competition after scoring the highest amount of points following the combination of votes from 11 international jury groups and a public vote consisting of telephone, SMS and app voting. The song represented [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016]], which took place in the [[Stockholm Globe Arena]] in [[Stockholm]] on 10, 12 and 14 May 2016. "If I Were Sorry" competed directly in the final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2016 on 14 May due to Sweden being the host nation for the contest following the victory of [[Måns Zelmerlöw]] and the song "[[Heroes (Måns Zelmerlöw song)|Heroes]]" in {{ESCYr|2015}}. At the contest, Sweden placed fifth out of the 26 competing nations in the final, scoring 261 points.

===Entry selection===
Entries for the 2016 competition were selected through three methods:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dags att börja skriva låtar till Melodifestivalen 2016|url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/dags-att-borja-skriva-latar-till-melodifestivalen-2016|website=svt.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|accessdate=4 February 2016|language=Swedish|date=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inbjudan till Melodifestivalen 2016 |url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/article3060958.svt/binary/Inbjudan%20till%20Melodifestivalen%202016.pdf |website=svt.se |publisher=[[Sveriges Television]] |accessdate=4 February 2016 |language=Swedish |date=26 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704123010/http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/article3060958.svt/binary/Inbjudan%20till%20Melodifestivalen%202016.pdf |archivedate=4 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*14 entries were chosen by a selection panel from submissions received by SVT through an open call for songs.
*13 entries were selected by SVT via special invitations to artists and songwriters.
*1 entry was provided by the selected artist from the competition ''Svensktoppen nästa'' organised by [[Sveriges Radio P4]].

SVT opened two submission contests that accepted entries between 1 and 16 September 2015 for interested artists and songwriters to submit their proposals for the competition. The ''Regular contest'' was open for entries that had at least one songwriter that already had a musical work published, while the ''Public contest'' accepted entries from songwriters without previously published musical work.&lt;ref name=rules&gt;{{cite web|title=Invitation to the 2016 Melodifestival|url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/article3060975.svt/BINARY/Melodifestivalen%202016%20rules.pdf|website=svt.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|accessdate=4 February 2016|date=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entries submitted for the competition were required to be new compositions which had never been published between 2–3 minutes in length and with at least one songwriter that had Swedish citizenship. The choice of language was free, however, SVT reserved 30% of the contest's places for entries sung mainly in Swedish. SVT also aimed to have at least 50% of the contest's places for entries written by female composers and lyricists either in a solo or collaborative capacity.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;

Following the conclusion of the submission periods, SVT received 2,450 entries—an increase of 273 entries from the previous year. 1,982 of the entries were entered into the ''Regular contest'', while 468 entries were entered into the ''Public contest''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dahlander|first1=Gustav|last2=Källman|first2=Pär|title=Nu är låtarna till Melodifestivalen 2016 på plats|url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/nu-ar-latarna-till-melodifestivalen-2016-pa-plats|website=svt.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|accessdate=4 February 2016|language=Swedish|date=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; SVT created a shortlist of entries from the received submissions and formed a selection panel that was tasked to select fourteen entries for the competition. The selection panel consisted of seventeen members: ten men and seven women 18–64 years of age. Half of the jury members represented people working in or involved with the music industry (professional dancers, artist managers, music editors and programme/music directors) and the other half consisted of members of the public who are viewers of Melodifestivalen (with professions such as engineers, bloggers, teachers, consultants and students).&lt;ref name=selection_panel&gt;{{cite web|last1=Petersson|first1=Emma|title=De valde låtarna – här är Melodifestivalens urvalsjury 2016|url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/de-valde-latarna-har-ar-melodifestivalens-urvalsjury-2016|website=svt.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|accessdate=4 February 2016|language=Swedish|date=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voting===
During the six shows, viewers could cast their votes through telephone, SMS and mobile application voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Albinsson|first1=Mathilde|title=Nya regler: Så funkar appen i Melodifestivalen 2016|url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/nya-regler-sa-funkar-appen-i-melodifestivalen-2016|website=svt.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|accessdate=4 February 2016|language=Swedish|date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For telephone and SMS voting, viewers were able to cast their vote through two different voting lines per voting method: a regular line costing 3.60 SEK and a donation line costing 9.90 SEK of which 8.90 SEK was donated to the charity organisation [[Radiohjälpen]]. Up to 20 votes could be cast per phone number per voting line, allowing a single phone number to contribute a maximum of 80 votes in each round of voting. With the mobile application, each device could send up to 5 votes for free per entry. The results of the semi-finals and Second Chance round were determined solely by viewer votes, while in the final, the results were determined through a 50/50 combination of viewer votes and the votes of eleven international jury groups.&lt;ref name=voting_rules/&gt; 36,711,512 votes were cast in total during the six shows with 4,633,907 SEK collected for Radiohjälpen.&lt;ref name=MF2016_results/&gt;

==Competing entries==
The twenty-eight competing entries were announced to the public during a press conference on 30 November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Escudero|first1=Victor M.|title=Sweden: Who will compete in Melodifestivalen 2016?|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=sweden_who_will_compete_in_melodifestivalen_2016|website=eurovision.tv|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=17 January 2016|date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the press conference, it was only known that the group [[Smilo]] (formerly Smajling Swedes) had been selected for the competition from the artists that participated in the ''Svensktoppen nästa'' competition organised by [[Sveriges Radio P4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Laufer|first1=Gil|title=Sweden: Smajling Swedes to Melodifestivalen 2016!|url=http://esctoday.com/105544/sweden-smajling-swedes-to-melodifestivalen-2016/|website=esctoday.com|publisher=ESCToday.com|accessdate=4 February 2016|date=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the competing artists were former Melodifestivalen winners [[Tommy Nilsson]] ([[Melodifestivalen 1989|1989]]) and [[Martin Stenmarck]] ([[Melodifestivalen 2005|2005]]). [[Krista Siegfrids]] had also participated in the Eurovision Song Contest in {{ESCYr|2013}} where she [[Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013|represented Finland]].

On 4 February 2016, SVT held a press conference where they announced that "Himmel för två", written by Sven-Inge Sjöberg, Lennart Wastesson, Larry Forsberg and [[Camilla Läckberg]] and to have been performed by Anna Book, was disqualified from the competition. The disqualification came two days before the song was set to be performed in the first semi-final after it was discovered that the song had previously competed in the audition stage of the [[Moldova in the Eurovision Song Contest 2014|2014 Moldovan Eurovision Song Contest national selection]] under the title "Taking Care of a Broken Heart" with lyrics in English.&lt;ref name=Anna_Book&gt;{{cite web|title=Anna Books bidrag "Himmel för två" diskvalificeras från Melodifestivalen 2016|url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/anna-books-bidrag-himmel-for-tva-diskvalificeras-fran-melodifestivalen-2016|website=svt.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|accessdate=4 February 2016|language=Swedish|date=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semi-finals==
As in previous years, Melodifestivalen commenced with four semi-finals, which determined the eight entries that advanced directly to the final and the eight entries that qualified to the Second Chance round. The running order for each semi-final was announced on 12 January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dahlander|first1=Gustav|title=Från Samir &amp; Viktor till Molly Sandén – startordningen i Melodifestivalen 2016|url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/fran-samir-och-viktor-till-molly-sanden-startordningen-i-melodifestivalen-2016-oscar-zia-far-unik-plats|website=svt.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|accessdate=4 February 2016|language=Swedish|date=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The semi-final results were based solely on viewer votes. Two rounds of voting took place in each semi-final to determine which entries would advance further and which entries would be eliminated. All seven competing entries in each semi-final (six in the first semi-final) participated in the first round of voting where the top five advanced to the second round, while the bottom two were eliminated. In the second round of voting, the two entries that occupied the first and second places qualified directly to the final, while the third and fourth placed entries proceeded to the Second Chance round. The fifth placed entry was eliminated. All votes from the second round of voting were added to the votes that each entry received from the first round of voting in order to determine the final outcome.&lt;ref name=voting_rules/&gt;
 
===Semi-final 1===
The first semi-final took place on 6 February 2016 at the [[Scandinavium]] in [[Gothenburg]], hosted by [[Gina Dirawi]] and [[Petra Mede]]. "[[Don't Worry (Ace Wilder song)|Don't Worry]]" performed by [[Ace Wilder]] and "[[Constellation Prize (song)|Constellation Prize]]" performed by [[Robin Bengtsson]] qualified directly to the final, while "[[Bada nakna]]" performed by [[Samir &amp; Viktor|Samir and Viktor]] and "[[Rik (song)|Rik]]" performed by [[Albin Johnsén|Albin]] and [[Mattias Andréasson|Mattias]] advanced to the Second Chance round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Escudero|first1=Victor M.|title=Melodifestivalen gets underway in Sweden|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=melodifestivalen_gets_underway_in_sweden|website=eurovision.tv|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=6 February 2016|date=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 4,389,687 votes were cast by the viewers during the show with a total of 477,689 SEK collected for [[Radiohjälpen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Petersson|first1=Emma|title=Ace Wilder och Robin Bengtsson är i final i Melodifestivalen 2016|url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/ace-wilder-med-don-t-worry-ar-i-final-i-melodifestivalen-2016|website=svt.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|accessdate=7 February 2016|language=Swedish|date=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish girl group and [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006 Spanish Eurovision entrants]] [[Las Ketchup]] also performed their song "[[The Ketchup Song (Aserejé)]]" as an interval act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Petersson|first1=Emma|title=Minut för minut – så blir Melodifestivalen 2016 i Göteborg: Deltävling ett|url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/minut-for-minut-sa-blir-melodifestivalen-2016-i-goteborg-deltavling-ett|website=svt.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|accessdate=7 February 2016|language=Swedish|date=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recurring interval acts such as [[Jonas Gardell]]'s schlager school and dramatic readings of past Melodifestivalen song lyrics by Swedish actors were also part of the programme; [[Stina Ekblad]] performed a dramatic reading of [[Samir &amp; Viktor|Samir and Viktor]]'s [[Melodifestivalen 2015]] entry "[[Groupie (Samir &amp; Viktor song)|Groupie]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Albinsson|first1=Mathilde|title=Gardells schlagerskola gör comeback i Melodifestivalen 2016|url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/gardells-schlagerskola-gor-comeback-i-melodifestivalen|website=svt.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|accessdate=7 February 2016|language=Swedish|date=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Palmér|first1=Saga|title=Sveriges skådespelarelit hyllar Melodifestivalen 2016|url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/sveriges-skadespelarelit-hyllar-melodifestivalen-2016|website=svt.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|accessdate=7 February 2016|language=Swedish|date=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days prior to the semi-final on 4 February, "Himmel för två", performed by [[Anna Book]], was disqualified after it was discovered that the song had previously been entered and performed in the audition round of the [[Moldova in the Eurovision Song Contest 2014|2014 Moldovan Eurovision Song Contest national selection]].&lt;ref name=Anna_Book/&gt; Book performed the song during the semi-final as an interval act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Petersson|first1=Emma|title=Anna Book sjunger i första deltävlingen i Melodifestivalen 2016 i Göteborg|url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/anna-book-sjunger-i-forsta-deltavlingen-i-melodifestivalen-2016|website=svt.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|accessdate=5 February 2016|language=Swedish|date=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final==
The final took place on 12 March 2016 at the [[Friends Arena]] in Solna, hosted by [[Gina Dirawi]] and [[William Spetz]]. Twelve entries competed during the show. Eight of the entries qualified directly from the semi-finals, while four of the competing entries qualified from the Second Chance round. The winner was selected by a combination of viewer votes and eleven international jury groups. The viewers and the juries each had a total of 473 points to award. Each jury group distributed their points as follows: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 points. The viewer vote was based on the percentage of votes each song achieved through the following voting methods: telephone, SMS and mobile application. For example, if a song gained 10% of the viewer vote, then that entry would be awarded 10% of 473 points rounded to the nearest integer: 47 points. Viewers were able to cast their vote in the final from the start of the show until five minutes after the jury groups had distributed their points, allowing the viewers to respond to the outcome of the jury results. In the event of a tie, the viewer vote would overrule the jury.&lt;ref name=voting_rules&gt;{{cite web|title=Hur röstar jag under direktsändningarna?|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/gruppsida.aspx?programid=2023&amp;grupp=19035&amp;artikel=6362497|website=sverigesradio.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Radio]]|accessdate=7 February 2016|language=Swedish|date=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[If I Were Sorry]]" performed by [[Frans Jeppsson-Wall|Frans]] was selected as the winner after placing second with the international jury vote and winning the public vote to finish with an overall 156-point total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Escudero|first1=Victor M.|title=Frans wins Melodifestivalen in Sweden|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=frans_wins_melodifestivalen_in_sweden|website=eurovision.tv|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=12 March 2016|date=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A record total of 12,643,477 votes were cast by the viewers during the show with a total of 2,174,489 SEK collected for [[Radiohjälpen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Palmér|first1=Saga|title=Melodifestivalen 2016 krossar alla röstningsrekord med 12 miljoner röster|url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/melodifestivalen-2016-krossar-alla-rostningsrekord-med-12-miljoner-roster|website=svt.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=Swedish|date=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The '''New Jersey State Fair''' is a non-profit agricultural fair held every August at the Sussex County Fairgrounds in [[Augusta, New Jersey|Augusta]], New Jersey. The fair has been held in conjunction with the [[Sussex County Farm and Horse Show]] since 1999 and draws 220,000 residents annually. The Augusta-based event was commonly referred to as the '''Sussex County Fair''' by locals. This fair is not affiliated with nor is to be confused with [[State Fair Meadowlands]], which is a carnival held every June at the [[Meadowlands Sports Complex]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey|East Rutherford]], New Jersey.

==Mission statement==
The stated mission of the '''New Jersey State Fair / Sussex County Farm and Horse Show''' is:

*to showcase New Jersey’s agriculture;
*provide safe, family-friendly entertainment;
*present educational activities;
*promote youth development;
*give financial support to charitable non-profit agencies

== Summary ==
The New Jersey State Fair/Sussex County Farm and Horse Show is an annual event held during the first week of every August at the Sussex County Fairgrounds. A traditional agricultural fair, it offers livestock competitions, food tasting competitions, 4-H competitions and exhibitions, crafts, and AHSA-sanctioned horse competitions, including the Sussex County Grand Prix and the [[Lou Dobbs]] Show, Show Jumping Hall of Fame Amateur-Owner Classic. Other fair favorites include an annual fiddlers contest, a Queen of the Fair competition,  demolition derby, oxen and tractor pulls, carnival rides, and exhibits from local organizations. Fair proceeds are donated to local charities, which is a tradition dating to 1933.

The fair's roots extend back to 1923 when a Sussex County riding club held a horse show for the children of its members. The horse show thereafter expanded, and was held annually in Branchville, New Jersey, from 1933 to 1975, and then from 1976 to the present at its current location in Augusta, New Jersey. The fair was initially called the Sussex County Horse Show from 1936 to 1940, and then as the Sussex County Farm and Horse Show from 1940 to 1999. In 1999, the Sussex County Farm and Horse Show purchased the rights to the New Jersey State Fair name, which previously operated at [[Garden State Park]] in [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey|Cherry Hill]], New Jersey, and was officially renamed the New Jersey State Fair/Sussex County Farm and Horse Show.&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey State Fair History Committee (2007) ''A Fair to Remember: A Documentary on the History of the Sussex County Farm and Horse Show.''

''[https://web.archive.org/web/20150329133906/http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/putin-is-exploiting-the-legacy-of-the-soviet-union-to-further-russias-ends-in-ukraine-9170539.html Putin is exploiting the legacy of the Soviet Union to further Russia's ends in Ukraine]''. [[The Independent]]. March 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A. ''[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/06/09/calls-for-a-return-to-stalingrad-name-test-the-limits-of-putins-soviet-nostalgia/ Calls for a return to ‘Stalingrad’ name test the limits of Putin’s Soviet nostalgia]''. [[Washington Post]]. June 9, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; is a social phenomenon of [[nostalgia]] for the [[Soviet Union|Soviet era]], whether [[politics of the Soviet Union|its politics]], [[Soviet people|its society]], [[culture of the Soviet Union|its culture]], or simply its [[aesthetics]]. Such nostalgia is observed among people in Russia and the other [[post-Soviet states]], as well as persons born in the [[Soviet Union]] but long since living abroad.

In 2004 a television channel [[Nostalgiya (television, Russia)|Nostalgiya]] stylized with a [[hammer and sickle]] was launched  in Russia.

==Reasons==
According to polls, what is missed most about the former Soviet Union was its shared economic system, which provided a modicum of financial stability. [[Neoliberal]] economic reforms after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the USSR]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]] resulted in harsh living standards for the general population. Policies associated with [[privatization]] allowed of the country's economy to fall in the hands of a [[Russian oligarch|newly established business oligarchy]]. The sense of belonging to a great [[superpower]] was a secondary reason for the nostalgia; many felt humiliated and betrayed by their experiences throughout the 1990s and blamed the upheaval on advisors from Western powers, especially as NATO moved closer into Russia's sphere of influence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/12/21/why-do-so-many-people-miss-the-soviet-union/ Why do so many people miss the Soviet Union?] ''[[The Washington Post]].'' December 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Dr. [[Kristen R. Ghodsee]], a researcher on post-communist nostalgia in Eastern Europe:

{{bquote|"Only by examining how the quotidian aspects of daily life were affected by great social, political and economic changes can we make sense of the desire for this collectively imagined, more egalitarian past. Nobody wants to revive 20th century [[totalitarianism]]. But nostalgia for communism has become a common language through which ordinary men and women express disappointment with the shortcomings of parliamentary democracy and neoliberal capitalism today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wamc.org/post/dr-kristen-ghodsee-bowdoin-college-nostalgia-communism|title=Dr. Kristen Ghodsee, Bowdoin College - Nostalgia for Communism|last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Peach Drop''' is an annual [[New Year's Eve]] [[List of objects dropped on New Year's Eve|drop]] event held in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. From 1989 through 2017, the event was held at [[Underground Atlanta]], but has since been held at [[Woodruff Park]]. The drop's use of a peach symbolizes Georgia's identity as the "Peach State".

As Underground Atlanta was sold to a private developer, the Drop was held there for the last time for 2016-17. Since 2018, the drop has occurred from the [[Flatiron Building (Atlanta)|Flatiron Building]], with festivities at [[Woodruff Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/atlanta-police-ramp-security-plans-for-new-peach-drop-location/2kzTML6beejWaANAcJyAAL/|title=Atlanta police ramp up security plans for new Peach Drop location|last=Stevens|first=Alexis|website=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|access-date=2017-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pyongyang International Film Festival''' is a biennial cultural exhibition held in [[Pyongyang]], [[North Korea]]. The [[film festival]] is a very cosmopolitan event; prior to 2002, it was reserved to "non-aligned and other developing countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pyongyanginternationalfilmfestival.com/|website=PIFF |title=Pyongyang International Film Festival|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The event originated in 1987 as the '''Pyongyang Film Festival of the Non-aligned and Other Developing Countries'''.&lt;ref name=bfi-200901&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/features/lonely-place-north-korea-s-pyongyang-international-film |title=In a lonely place: North Korea's Pyongyang International Film Festival |author=James Bell |work=Sight &amp; Sound |publisher=British Film Institute |date=January 2009 |accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maiden event, held from September 1 through September 10, showed short films, features, and documentaries that were judged for competitive awards.

The film festival returned in 1990 and would be regularly held every other year.&lt;ref name=bfi-200901/&gt; Recurrent subject matter included domestic cinema that commonly praised the high leadership such as a film shown at the 1992 film festival, verbosely translated, ''Glory of Our People in Holding the Great Leader in High Esteem'', and foreign films about revolutionary resistance.

In 2000, officials widened the acceptable breadth of film watching, by screening Japanese films for the first time when [[Yoji Yamada]] arrived to present six of his films.{{Sfn|Schönherr|2012|p=12}}

The ninth festival, held in 2004, moderated cultural restrictions further with the screening of a dubbed and censored version of the [[United Kingdom|British]] comedy ''[[Bend It Like Beckham]]'' and [[United States|U.S.]]-produced [[South Africa]]n drama ''[[Cry, The Beloved Country (1995 film)|Cry, The Beloved Country]]''. ''Bend it like Beckham'' won the music prize and later it became the first Western-made film shown on television in North Korea.

In 2006, the Swedish horror comedy ''[[Frostbiten]]'' was shown at the festival, the first foreign horror film to ever be shown in North Korea.

''[[The Schoolgirl's Diary]]'', which premiered at the 2006 festival, in 2007 became the first North Korean film in several decades to be picked up for international distribution, when it was purchased by French company Pretty Pictures. It was released in France in late 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1928365,00.html|publisher=The Guardian|date=2006-10-22|accessdate=2007-05-27|title=Cinematic bombshell from Kim|last=Burke|first=Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==

The festival is held in the autumn every two years. It has an international jury and both competitive and non-competitive submissions. In that sense, it is "structured ... very much like any other international film festival".{{Sfn|Schönherr|2012|p=11}}

Since 2000, the festival has been dominated by films from Western Europe.{{Sfn|Schönherr|2012|p=12}} Many of the films are censored and often have themes emphasising family values, loyalty and the temptations of money. In 2008, 110 films were shown from a total of 46 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-fg-film11-2008oct11,0,7893170.story?page=1 "North Korea Film Festival"], ''LA Times'', October 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; South Korean films are not shown because of the current political climate.&lt;ref name=mail-20160924&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3805128/Festival-brings-world-cinema-Pyongyang.html |title=Festival brings (some) world cinema to Pyongyang |agency=AFP |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=24 September 2016 |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=November 2017}} Films critical of North Korean from anywhere in the world are not allowed and neither are sexually explicit films. Anything else goes, and the organizers try to get as many films and visitors to attend.{{Sfn|Schönherr|2012|p=11}} Diplomatic connections or the personal initiative of filmmakers is what often results in a film being admitted. The result is often "an odd mix" of films that are not united by one genre. In recent years, the festival has enjoyed recent popularity abroad, mainly due to the success of [[South Korean cinema]] prompting foreign film enthusiasts' curiosity about the North. Consequentially, film submissions have increased and the selection of films has improved in quality.{{Sfn|Schönherr|2012|p=12}}

In 2016, the animated Spanish film ''[[Mortadelo and Filemon: Mission Implausible]]'' was featured, became the first animated Spanish film and the first comic's adaptation to be shown.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The festival is one of the few North Korean functions that actively seeks connection with the outside world.{{Sfn|Schönherr|2012|p=11}} [[Johannes Schönherr]], author of ''North Korean Cinema: A History'' and a festival delegate in 2000, said "The Pyongyang International Film Festival is a big propaganda event and foreigners who attend the event become extras in the big propaganda show."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Moxley|first=Mitch|date=2015-02-03|title=The Reddest Carpet: I Survived the North Korean Film Festival|url=https://www.gq.com/story/north-korean-film-festival-exclusive|journal=GQ Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5030">[[File:Bildungsstreik Göttingen 1568.jpg|thumb|A [[sit-in]] is one of many tools in the modern movement's repertoires of contention.]]
[[File:Rough music.png|thumb|Repertoires can be transitory; consider the disappearance of [[rough music]], popular in the 18th century [[Great Britain]].]]
[[File:Schienenblockade.jpg|thumb|Activists blocking [[Fossil fuel phase-out|railway lines leading to a coal mine]] to [[Climate change mitigation|limit climate change]] ([[Ende Gelände 2016]]).]]

'''Repertoire of contention''' refers, in [[social movement]] theory, to the set of various protest-related tools and actions available to a movement or related organization in a given time frame.&lt;ref name=bw/&gt;&lt;ref name="SnowSoule2004"/&gt;

== Description ==

Repertoires are often shared between social actors; as one group (organization, movement, etc.) finds a certain tool or action successful, in time, it is likely to spread to others.&lt;ref name=bw/&gt;&lt;ref name="SnowSoule2004"/&gt; However, in addition to providing options, repertoires can be seen as limiting, as people tend to focus on familiar tools and actions, and innovation outside their scope is uncommon (see [[diffusion of innovations]]).&lt;ref name=bw/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tarrow1998"/&gt;

Actions and tools that belong to common repertoires of contention include, but are not limited to: creation of special-purpose associations and coalitions, public meetings, solemn [[procession]]s, [[vigils]], [[Political rally|rallies]], [[demonstration (people)|demonstration]]s, [[sit-in]]s, [[petition]] drives, statements to and in public [[Mass media|media]], [[boycott]]s, [[strike (action)|strike]]s and [[pamphleteering]]. Repertoires change over time, and can vary from place to place.&lt;ref name="SnowSoule2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tarrow1998"/&gt; They are determined both by what the actors know how to do, and what is expected from them.&lt;ref name="Tarrow1998"/&gt; Early repertoires, from the time before the rise of the modern [[social movement]], included [[food riot]]s and [[banditry]].&lt;ref name="SnowSoule2004"/&gt; The changing nature of repertoires of contention can be seen in a sample element of the mid-18th century [[Great Britain|British]] repertoire of contention, the [[rough music]]: a humiliating and loud public punishment inflicted upon one or more people who have violated the standards of the rest of the community.&lt;ref name="Tilly2003"/&gt; For yet another example, consider that in the recent years, [[Internet]]-focused repertoires have been developed (see [[hacktivism]]).&lt;ref name=bw/&gt; Recent scholarship has introduced a notion that in addition to the "traditional" and "modern" repertoires, a new, "digital", repertoire may be emerging.&lt;ref name="EarlKimport2011"/&gt;

While the term is used most often in the social movement theory context, it can be applied to any political actors.&lt;ref name="Tilly2002"/&gt; Repertoires of contention also existed before the birth of the modern social movement (a period most scholars identify as the late 18th to early 19th century).&lt;ref name="Tarrow1998"/&gt;

The term is attributed to [[Charles Tilly]].&lt;ref name="bw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tarrow1998"/&gt;

'''''Seedbed''''' is a [[performance art|performance piece]] first performed by [[Vito Acconci]] on 15–29 January 1972 at [[Sonnabend Gallery]] in [[New York City]].

In the piece, there is a low wooden ramp merging with the floor. The ramp extends across the width of the room, beginning two feet up the side of one wall and slanting down to the middle of the floor.

In his original performance of the piece, Acconci lay hidden underneath the ramp installed at the Sonnabend Gallery, masturbating. The artist's spoken fantasies about the visitors walking above him were heard through loudspeakers in the gallery.&lt;ref name="description"&gt;{{

"In this legendary sculpture/performance Acconci lay beneath a ramp built in the Sonnabend Gallery. Over the course of three weeks, he masturbated eight hours a day while murmuring things like, "You're pushing your cunt down on my mouth" or "You're ramming your cock down into my ass." Not only does the architectural intervention presage much of his subsequent work, but all of Acconci's fixations converge in this, the spiritual sphincter of his art. In ''Seedbed'', Acconci is the producer and the receiver of the work's pleasure. He is simultaneously public and private, making marks yet leaving little behind, and demonstrating ultra-awareness of his viewer while being in a semi-trance state." - [[Jerry Saltz]]

A video of the piece itself shows no sexual content; it all is merely suggested.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ubu.com/film/acconci_seedbed.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marina Abramović]] performed ''Seedbed'' as part of her ''[[Seven Easy Pieces]]'' in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pastexhibitions.guggenheim.org/abramovic/ Guggenheim, Past exhibitions]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty''' ('''SHAC''') was an international [[animal rights]] campaign to close down [[Huntingdon Life Sciences]] (HLS), Europe's largest contract [[Animal testing|animal-testing]] laboratory.  SHAC ended its campaign in August 2014. HLS tests medical and non-medical substances on around 75,000 animals every year, from rats to primates.&lt;ref name="BBCJan182001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugresearcher.com/news/ng.asp?n=72122-faseb-us-government-huntingdon "New bill clamps down on animal activist activity"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712081822/http://www.drugresearcher.com/news/ng.asp?n=72122-faseb-us-government-huntingdon |date=12 July 2007 }}, ''Drug Researcher'', 17 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=42 "From push to shove"] Southern Poverty Law Center, Fall 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, Mark.

SHAC was started in November 1999 by three British animal rights activists—[[Greg Avery]], [[Heather Nicholson|Heather James]], and Natasha Dellemagne—after video footage supposed to have been shot covertly inside HLS in 1997 by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) showed HLS staff shaking, punching, and shouting at beagles in their care.&lt;ref&gt;Alleyne, Richard. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1318487/Terror-tactics-that-brought-a-company-to-its-knees.html "Terror tactics that brought a company to its knees"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 19 January 2001.

PETA stopped its protests against the company after HLS threatened it with legal action, and SHAC took over as a [[leaderless resistance]].&lt;ref name=DowardAug2004&gt;Doward, Jamie and Townsend, Mark. [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/focus/story/0,6903,1273697,00.html "Beauty and the beasts"], ''The Observer'', 1 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign used tactics ranging from non-violent protest to the alleged firebombing of houses owned by executives associated with HLS's clients and investors. The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC), which monitors US domestic extremism, has described SHAC's ''modus operandi'' as "frankly terroristic tactics similar to those of anti-abortion extremists," and in 2005 an official with the FBI's counter-terrorism division referred to SHAC's activities in the United States as domestic terrorist threats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=42 "From push to shove"], Southern Poverty Law Group ''Intelligence Report'', Fall 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, John E.

In 2009 and 2010, 13 members of SHAC, including Avery, James, and Dellemagne, were jailed for between 15 months and eleven years on charges of conspiracy to blackmail or harm HLS and its suppliers.&lt;ref name="Evers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weaver"/&gt;

On 12 August 2014, SHAC officially announced it was closing its campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shac.net |title=SHAC ends |publisher=Shac.net |accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The company has been the subject of several undercover investigations since 1989. Sarah Kite of the [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]] (BUAV) secured a job and filmed inside HLS in 1989. Zoe Broughton did the same for Channel Four in 1996, as Michelle Rokke claimed to have done for PETA in 1997. Lucy Johnston for ''The Daily Express'' gained access in 2000. A diary kept by Kite, who worked undercover there for eight months, alleged that HLS workers routinely mishandled the animals, shouting at them, throwing them into their cages, and mocking them for having fits in response to toxicity tests. In 1997, Zoe Broughton came out with footage showing puppies being hit and shaken. A year later, Michelle Rokke allegedly obtained footage of the [[vivisection]] of a monkey in HLS in New Jersey, in which a technician expresses concern that the animal is inadequately anaesthetized.&lt;ref name=investigations&gt;[http://www.insidehls.com/inside_kite.htm "The First Investigation"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827213152/http://www.insidehls.com/inside_kite.htm |date=27 August 2008 }}; [http://www.insidehls.com/inside_broughton.htm "It's a Dog's Life"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827213115/http://www.insidehls.com/inside_broughton.htm |date=27 August 2008 }} (Zoe Broughton for Channel Four in 1996); [http://www.insidehls.com/inside_rokke.htm "HLS busted again"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827212839/http://www.insidehls.com/inside_rokke.htm |date=27 August 2008 }} (Michelle Rokke for PETA in 1997); and Johnstone, Lucy and Calvert, Jonathan.

According to Mark Matfield of the [[Research Defence Society]], a pro-animal testing lobby group in the UK, HLS lost a great deal of business after these investigations, primarily among the pharmaceutical industry. "There was an ingrained feeling among scientists and business people that this company had transgressed in a very serious way," he said.&lt;ref name=Rudacille&gt;Rudacille, Deborah.

==Structure==

===SHAC UK===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Heather Nicholson (SHAC).jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Heather Nicholson]] founded SHAC with Greg Avery and Natasha Dellemagne. They were sentenced in 2009 to 11 and nine years imprisonment.]] --&gt;
SHAC was founded in November 1999 by Greg Avery; his second wife, Natasha Avery (née Dellemagne); and his first wife, Heather Nicholson (née James). Avery and Nicholson had been involved in previous high-profile campaigns against facilities in the UK that bred animals for laboratories. In 1997, after a ten-month campaign, they caused the closure of [[Consort beagles|Consort Kennels]], which bred beagles for animal research. Later that year, they started [[Save the Hill Grove Cats]] against Hill Grove farm in Oxfordshire, which bred cats for laboratories. The farm closed after two years.&lt;ref name=Jonas/&gt;

SHAC maintained a decentralized approach with no official central leadership, allowing activists throughout the UK and North America to act autonomously, though ''The Guardian'' described Avery in 2008 as the ''de facto'' leader.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/dec/24/profile-animal-research-activists "Campaigns, protests and prison terms: how activists formed militant cell"], ''The Guardian'', 24 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After Avery was jailed, another activist, Thomas Harris, ran the group in the UK until he was imprisoned in 2010.&lt;ref name=Weaver&gt;Weaver, Matthew. [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/oct/25/animal-research-animal-welfare "Animal rights activists jailed for terrorising suppliers to Huntingdon Life Sciences"], ''The Guardian'', 25 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Before their convictions, Nicholson, Avery, and Dellemagne would publish reports on the SHAC website and by mail, and provide press information and interviews; in April 2004 they were reported to be living together rent-free in a cottage provided by a supporter, Virginia Jane Steele.&lt;ref name=DowardApril2004&gt;Doward, Jamie. [https://www.theguardian.com/animalrights/story/0,11917,1189921,00.html "Sex and violence allegations split animal rights campaign"], ''The Observer'', 11 April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; SHAC also obtains income from fundraising stalls. According to ''The Times'', one stall in London's Oxford Street could generate £500 in a single day, and in total around £1 million in donations had been raised by 2008.&lt;ref name=TimesYeoman&gt;Yeoman, Fran. [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article5391799.ece "The £1m hate campaign paid for by high street collections"], ''The Times'', 24 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to prosecutors in a 2008 court case, the senior members of SHAC co-ordinated the campaign from a cottage in Little Moorcote, near [[Hook, Hart|Hook]], Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article4902105.ece "Animal rights activists' 'blackmail campaign spanned Europe and US'"], ''The Times'', 7 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They would meet every three months to receive updates from colleagues in the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name=Bugged&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7657837.stm "Police bugged animal rights group"], BBC News, 7 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Times'', Gavin Medd-Hall, a former computer technician, would lead research into potential targets. The police found spreadsheets at the cottage documenting the location of targets and details about their children and security arrangements.&lt;ref name=TimesYeoman/&gt; Sarah Whitehead, an experienced campaigner known in the group as "Mumsy", would lead younger members and carry up to five attacks in a night, according to the judge.&lt;ref name=Weaver/&gt;

===SHAC USA===
SHAC USA was founded in 2004 by Kevin Jonas, sometimes spelled Kjonaas by the media, a political science graduate of the [[University of Minnesota]], after he had spent two years working in the UK with Greg Avery. Prosecutors in the U.S. said that a house in [[Somerset, New Jersey]] — a few miles from a HLS laboratory — was the headquarters of SHAC USA; Jonas lived there with Lauren Gazzola, SHAC USA's campaign co-ordinator, and Jacob Conroy.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt; According to Jonas, the "SHAC campaign" came to mean any action aimed at contributing to the demise of HLS, whether legal or not, while SHAC itself referred only to the incorporated group that ran a news and information service. Jonas writes that these distinctions were made in various legal proceedings.&lt;ref name=Jonas&gt;Jonas, Kevin. "Bricks and Bullhorns" in Best, Steven and Nocella, Anthony J. (eds.) ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters?'', Lantern Books, 2004; see p. 271 for legal distinctions.&lt;/ref&gt; He told the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2002: "There's a very famous quote by John F. Kennedy. 'If you make peaceful revolution impossible, you make violent revolution inevitable.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=42 "From Push to Shove"], Southern Policy Law Center, Fall 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; After he was imprisoned in 2006 for inciting harassment against HLS, [[Pamelyn Ferdin]], a former child actor, became president of SHAC USA.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt;

===Methods===

====Secondary and tertiary targeting====
SHAC's ''modus operandi'' is known as secondary and tertiary targeting. Activists engage in [[direct action]]—ranging from lawful protests to intimidation, harassment, and violent attacks—not only against HLS, its employees, and its employees' families, but also against secondary and tertiary targets such as HLS's business partners, and ''their'' business partners, insurers, caterers, cleaners, children's nursery schools, and office suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/4295706.stm "Childcare group warned of 'hell'"], BBC News, 29 September 2005.

*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1247506.stm "Lab firm ditched by share brokers"], BBC News, 28 March 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SHAC website said it published names and addresses only so that people could protest within the law,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shac.net/disclaimer/disclaimer.html SHAC Disclaimer]&lt;/ref&gt; but testimony to the British House of Commons in 2003 included excerpts from a document reported to have come from SHAC, which advised activists on tactics for protests outside targets' homes. These included throwing rape alarms in roof guttering at night, setting off fireworks, and ordering taxis and pizzas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030319/halltext/30319h01.htm House of Commons Hansard Debates], 19 March 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, HLS managing director in the UK, [[Brian Cass]], was beaten outside his home by three masked men — animal rights activist David Blenkinsop was sentenced to three years in prison for the attack — and HLS marketing director Andrew Gay was attacked on his doorstep with a chemical spray to his eyes that left him temporarily blinded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=42 "From push to shove"], Southern Poverty Law Group ''Intelligence Report'', Fall 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shareholders====
In 2000, SHAC obtained a list of HLS shareholders, including the names of usually anonymous beneficial owners — those holding shares through third parties — and the pension funds of the British Labour Party, Rover cars, and the London Borough of Camden. The list was passed to ''The Sunday Telegraph'', which published it on 3 December 2000, and several beneficial owners disposed of their shares; the Labour Party sold its 75,000 shares in January 2001. Two weeks after the ''Telegraph'' story, an equity stake of 32 million shares was placed on the London Stock Exchange for one penny each.&lt;ref&gt;Huntingdon Life Sciences, financial report 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 December 2000, HLS was dropped from the New York Stock Exchange because its [[market capitalization]] had fallen below NYSE limits, and on 29 March 2001, HLS lost both of its [[market maker]]s and its place on the London Stock Exchange. Shortly after this, HLS moved its headquarters to the United States, incorporating as Life Sciences Research (LSR), and secured a $15m loan from investment bank [[Stephens Inc.|Stephens, Inc]], its largest shareholder. In September 2005, after the firebombing of the homes of a Canadian brokerage employee and a British pharmaceutical executive, the New York Stock Exchange asked LSR to delay moving its listing from the [[OTC Bulletin Board]] to the main exchange.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/story/0,3604,1565018,00.html "Huntingdon delays listing after attacks"], ''The Guardian'', 8 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; LSR has since transferred its listing to the [[NYSE Arca]] electronic exchange. HLS is no longer a publicly traded company after being bought by CEO Andrew Baker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Preclinical-Research/LSR-goes-private-in-Lion-Holdings-takeover "LSR goes private in Lion Holdings takeover"], ''Outsourcing'', pharma.com, 1 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005, Vancouver-based brokerage [[Canaccord Capital]] announced that it had dropped a client, Phytopharm PLC, in response to the May 2005 [[Animal Liberation Front]] (ALF) firebombing of a car belonging to Canaccord executive Michael Kendall. The ALF stated on its website that activists placed an incendiary device under the car, which was in Kendall's garage at home when it caught fire during the night. Kendall and his family went into hiding. Phytopharm was targeted, as were those doing business with it, because it had business links with HLS.&lt;ref&gt;Won, Shirley, and Zehr, Leonard.

In May 2006, an anonymous group said it would be writing to every one of GlaxoSmithKline's 170,000 small investors warning them to sell their shares. The letters began arriving at investors' home addresses on 7 May 2006, asking that shares be sold within 14 days, and that the group be informed of the sale by e-mail via a Hotmail address.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/animalrights/story/0,,1770638,00.html "Animal rights activists tell drug firm's small investors to sell up or else"], ''The Guardian'', 9 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of letters sent was smaller than claimed; the BBC said at least 50 shareholders received the warning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4756381.stm Glaxo wins injunction over threat], 9 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''The Sunday Telegraph'' the following week, British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] expressed support for animal experimentation in the face of an ''"appalling ... campaign of intimidation."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1518328/Tony-Blair-Time-to-act-against-animal-rights-protesters.html|title=Tony Blair: Time to act against animal rights protesters|date=2006-05-13|access-date=2018-01-26|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ties to the ALF===
The SHAC website features ALF news. Kevin Jonas — who took charge of SHAC UK while the Averys and James were jailed for six months in 2002 — declared his support for the ALF, and [[Robin Webb]], spokesman for the ALF in the UK, attended and addressed SHAC conferences in the United States.&lt;ref name=DowardAug2004/&gt;

A posting on the website ''Bite Back'' on 7 September 2005 claimed the ALF had carried out an attack on the home of Paul Blackburn, corporate controller of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), in [[Buckinghamshire]], because GSK is a customer of HLS. The activists admitted to detonating a device containing two litres of fuel and four pounds of explosives on the doorstep of Blackburn's home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article571964.ece Bomb attack on Glaxo executive], ''The Times'', 28 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the ALF warned that it was targeting HLS suppliers, and that year firebombed a car belonging to the finance director of Canaccord Capital, a brokerage firm. Members of SHAC said the company had acted as brokers for [[Phytopharm]], which had used HLS for contract testing.&lt;ref&gt;Laville, Sandra and Campbell, Duncan. [https://www.theguardian.com/animalrights/story/0,11917,1514393,00.html "Animal rights extremists in arson spree"], ''The Guardian'', 25 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, Donald Currie was jailed for 12 years in connection with fire bombing offenses against HLS customers; police described him as an "active bomber for the [[Animal Liberation Front]]."&lt;ref&gt;Addley, Esther. [https://www.theguardian.com/frontpage/story/0,,1852939,00.html "Animal Liberation Front bomber faces jail after admitting arson bids"], ''The Guardian'', 18 August 2006.

A British police operation found that the core group of SHAC activists would compile private encrypted reports detailing the legal protests and an illegal blackmail campaign—the former attributed to SHAC, the latter claimed by the ALF or [[Animal Rights Militia]].&lt;ref name=TimesYeoman/&gt; In 2008 and 2010 when 13 SHAC members, including the Averys and Nicholson, were convicted of conspiracy to blackmail, police said their actions were on behalf of the ALF; senior members of SHAC were regarded by police as key figures within the ALF, according to ''The Guardian''. The members had sent incriminating emails describing their involvement in direct action, including one email sent to ''Bite Back'' in 2007 providing the details of an ALF attack the previous evening.&lt;ref&gt;Laville, Sandra. [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/dec/24/huntingdon-life-sciences "Animal rights extremists still targeting lab"], ''The Guardian'',  24 December 2008.
*Laville, Sandra. [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/dec/23/ukcrime-animalwelfare "From a Hampshire cottage, animal extremists plotted campaign of violence"], ''The Guardian'', 23 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; SHAC spokespersons have denied any link between their campaign and the ALF.

The FBI linked SHAC with attacks claimed by the militant animal rights group, the [[Animal Liberation Brigade]]. They issued an arrest warrant for [[Daniel Andreas San Diego]], who they described as being "involved with the Stop Huntington Animal Cruelty campaign", in connection with bomb attacks against two of HLS's clients in California.&lt;ref name="Doyle"&gt;Doyle, Leonard. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/5217035/Animal-rights-activist-added-to-FBIs-most-wanted-terrorist-list.html Animal rights activist added to FBI's most wanted terrorist list], ''The Telegraph'', 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[wiretap]] of Kevin Jonas' telephone revealed San Diego had called him on the day of one of the bombings.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt; San Diego was added to the [[FBI Most Wanted Terrorists]] List in 2009 and remains at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wanted_terrorists/daniel-andreas-san-diego/view|title=FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists List: Daniel Andreas San Diego|date=2009-04-21|publisher=FBI|accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convictions and legislation==
Several companies targeted by SHAC in the UK obtained injunctions. These include HLS itself, Chiron UK, Phytopharm, Daiichi UK, Asahi Glass, Eisai, Yamanouchi Pharma, Sankyo Pharma, and BOC. The injunctions compelled SHAC to print the injunction on their website, so that SHAC's action targets were juxtaposed with a legal notification that there was a 50-yard exclusion zone around the homes of employees and places of business. Protest outside HLS itself was allowed to occur one day a week with a police presence. HLS tried but failed in June 2004 to obtain a permanent injunction against SHAC. SHAC's argument against the enforceability of such injunctions was that, despite having hundreds of supporters, a website, mailing address, telephone information hotline, mailing list, and bank account, it does not exist as a corporate or charitable body, and therefore cannot prevent its supporters from taking action against HLS.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2004/06/24/cnhunt24.xml "Huntingdon told to prove animal rights group exists"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 24 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

SHAC's campaign prompted the introduction of sections 145–149 of the British [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]], which created new offences intended to protect animal-testing facilities, including prohibiting acts or threats intended to cause someone to terminate or not enter into a contract with such a facility.&lt;ref&gt;Tempest, Matthew. [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1320712,00.html "Crackdown on animal rights extremists"], ''The Guardian'', 31 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051030225623/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmstand/d/st050120/am/50120s08.htm "Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill"], House of Commons, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The first person to be convicted under the Act was Joseph Harris, a doctor of [[molecular biology]], who attacked property owned by companies supplying materials to HLS; he received a three-year sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/5362926.stm "Animal rights protester is jailed"], BBC News, 20 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2007, a number of SHAC supporters were charged with illegal street collecting without a licence.&lt;ref&gt;Smit, Martina.

In March 2007, three activists were jailed under the Act for intimidating HLS suppliers; one supplier dropped its contract with HLS after being invaded by demonstrators wearing skull masks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6423061.stm "Three 'violent' activists jailed"], BBC News, 6 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006: SHAC 7 (U.S.)===
[[File:SHAC7.png|right|thumb|300px|Logo of the SHAC 7 Support Group]]

In March 2006, a federal jury in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], found six members of SHAC guilty of using their website to incite attacks on those who did business with HLS.&lt;ref&gt;Kocieniewski, David. [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/03/nyregion/03animals.html "Six Animal Rights Advocates Are Convicted of Terrorism"], ''The New York Times'', 3 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, seven individuals (the SHAC 7) were charged: Kevin Jonas (former president of Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty USA), Lauren Gazzola, Jacob Conroy, Joshua Harper, Andrew Stepanian, Darius Fullmer, and John McGee. McGee was later dropped from the case.&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;Cook, John. [http://www.salon.com/life/feature/2006/02/07/thugs_puppies "Thugs for Puppies"], ''Salon'', 7 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They were charged with conspiracy to violate the [[Animal Enterprise Protection Act]], in the first application of the 1992 statute. Jonas, Gazzola, Conroy, and Harper were charged with conspiracy to harass using a telecommunications device (sending [[black fax]]es), while Jonas, Gazzola, Conroy, and SHAC USA were charged with stalking via the internet. The defense of the SHAC 7 rested largely on the 1969 case ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'', in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that political speech is legal unless it can be shown that a defendant has told specific individuals to commit specific, imminent acts of violence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/news/outfront/2006/01/america_no1_threat.html "America's #1 Threat"], ''Mother Jones'', January/February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They were sentenced on 3 March 2006, four of them to between three and six years, and ordered to pay joint restitution of $1,000,001.00. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

In 2011, [[NPR]] reported that Andrew Stepanian of the SHAC 7 -- since released—had been imprisoned in the highly restrictive [[Communication Management Unit]] of the U.S. federal prison system.&lt;ref name=npr2/&gt;

===2007: Operation Achilles (UK)===
On 1 May 2007, a series of raids—Operation Achilles—took place against SHAC in Europe, involving 700 police officers in England, Amsterdam, and Belgium.&lt;ref name=Evers&gt;Evers, Marco. [http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,517875,00.html "Resisting the Animal Avengers", Part 1], [http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,517875-2,00.html Part 2], ''Der Spiegel'', 19 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-two people were arrested, including Greg and Natasha Avery, and Heather Nicholson, who were charged with blackmail, along with nine others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/animalrights/story/0,,2070273,00.html "Animal rights activists involved in bid to shut lab among 30 arrested in raids"], ''The Guardian'', 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Averys pleaded guilty in July 2008, along with a co-accused Dan Amos. In October 2008 Trevor Holmes, Gerrah Selby, Daniel Wadham, Gavin Medd-Hall, and Heather Nicholson, who denied the charges, were sent to court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/92cf1796-93d2-11dd-b277-0000779fd18c.html "Activists in live testing trial deny blackmail"], ''The Financial Times'', 6 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors told jurors that a 2007 meeting between the defendants had been bugged by police, and revealed that SHAC supported illegal acts that were traced to attacks on people across Great Britain. The prosecution also alleged there was evidence of direct email links between SHAC, the Animal Liberation Front, and Animal Rights Militia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7655147.stm "Five deny animal rights blackmail "], BBC News, 6 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes was acquitted but the other four were convicted.

In 2010, five more members of SHAC pleaded guilty to criminal charges. Sarah Whitehead, Nicole Vosper and Thomas Harris plead guilty to conspiracy to blackmail; Jason Mullan and Nicola Tapping plead guilty to breaching section 145 of [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005|SOCPA]].

The '''Supercar Challenge''' is a motor racing series centered on the [[Benelux]]. A special feature is that touring cars, GTs and Sportscars can all participate on an equal basis within the same class, enabled by very open regulations. The championship was first held in 2001, after replacing the [[Supercar Cup]]. From 2001 to 2011 the championship was called the Dutch Supercar Challenge, but due to interest from drivers, teams and tracks outside the [[Netherlands]] the organisers decided to drop 'Dutch' from its name on 11 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nieuwe naam voor DSC: Supercar Challenge powered by Dunlop|url=http://www.supercarchallenge.nl/nl/nieuwe_naam_voor_dsc_supercar_challenge_powered_by_dunlop.html|website=supercarchallenge.nl|publisher=Supercar Challenge|accessdate=December 2, 2016|date=February 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format and regulations==
A typical race weekend exists of the usual practice on Friday and Saturday, qualifying on Saturday and two races of 45 to 60 minutes with one pit stop of at least 60 seconds. One race is on Saturday and one Sunday. The four classes usually run separate races two classes at a time. The two fastest run together and the two slowest run their race separate. The exception is at [[Spa-Francorchamps]] where all four classes can and do run together in two races over the weekend. All races are started from a rolling start though in the past standing starts have been used as well. "Success time" is awarded after every race. The first-place finisher gets 15 seconds, second place gets 10, third place gets 5, fourth place loses 5 seconds, fifth place loses ten and all below fifth place lose 15 seconds. This is added to the time of the minimum pit stop duration. The reason no "success ballast" is used, is the immense variety in vehicles competing. For instance, a 50&amp;nbsp;kg weight has a much larger effect on a Lotus Elise than it has on a Dodge Viper Competition Coupe even though these can compete in the same class.

===Classes===
* Sport I - Vehicles over 5.2&amp;nbsp;kg/bhp. Engines maximum 3000cc and 6 cylinders.
* Supersport II - Vehicles over 4.7&amp;nbsp;kg/bhp but under 5.2&amp;nbsp;kg/bhp. Engines maximum 5000 cc and 8 cylinders.
* Supersport I - Vehicles over 3.7&amp;nbsp;kg/bhp but under 4.7&amp;nbsp;kg/bhp. Minimum mass is 1080&amp;nbsp;kg. Engines as in Supersport II
* GT - Vehicles over 2.7&amp;nbsp;kg/bhp but under 3.6&amp;nbsp;kg/bhp. Minimum mass is 1180&amp;nbsp;kg.

==Single make series==
During most of its lifetime the Supercar Challenge has served as a host to many single make series. In the first two years the Marcos Mantis Cup ran within the GT class. In 2003 it was fully integrated in the GT class. Starting in 2008 the Mosler Challenge has run within GT. In 2010 three series were added. Those are [[BRL V6]] and the [[Saker Challenge]], not to be confused with the series of the same name the DNRT hosts, both within Supersport I and [[BRL Light]] in Supersport II. The BRL series were before separate events and still have a slightly different calendar. The races at Silverstone don't pay them points while the races at the Zolder truck Grand Prix do though to all other classes they don't count.

The {{Nihongo|'''Takenaga incident'''|竹永事件|Takenaga jiken|lead=yes}} was a surrender by an [[Imperial Japanese Army]] battalion that occurred on 3 May 1945, near the end of the [[Pacific War]]. The battalion, commanded by [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Masaharu Takenaga,{{#tag:ref|In the Australian Army's official history of the war, the name is mistakenly transliterated as ''Tagenaka'' instead of ''Takenaga''.&lt;ref name="long334"&gt;Long 1963, "[http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070081--1-.PDF Chapter 14: Maprik and Wewak Taken] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217142457/http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070081--1-.PDF |date=2015-02-17 }}", p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}} surrendered to the Australian Army in eastern [[New Guinea]]. This was extremely unusual for the Japanese Army, where surrender was seen as highly dishonourable.

== Incident ==

From March to April 1945, the 239th Infantry Regiment of the [[41st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|41st Division]], assigned to the [[Eighteenth Army (Japan)|Eighteenth Army]] of the Imperial Japanese Army, was engaged in hostilities with the Australian Army in eastern New Guinea. The Australians were pursuing them through the southern [[Torricelli Mountains]], near [[Aitape]], on the north coast. According to the records of the 41st Division, the 2nd Battalion, commanded by Takenaga and comprising around 50 soldiers, decided to head west, separating themselves from their regiment, who were retreating to the east.&lt;ref name="sosyo385"&gt;[[#ref_sosyo|Military Archives 1975]], p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to notes made by a [[sergeant major]] in the battalion, the main force of the regiment retreated without giving them any notice, after which they thought that they had been abandoned and decided to fend for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ref_satoh|Satō 2003]], p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of April (the 12th, according to a villager), around 45 of Takenaga's men raided Tau, a village of only a few houses, in order to find food. Villagers armed with throwing spears and hand grenades attacked the soldiers as they were searching, which caused them to retaliate. The villagers quickly retreated, but the soldiers and the villagers suffered two fatalities each. The Japanese soldiers left Tau the next morning, but remained in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ref_satoh|Satō 2003]], p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tanaka233"&gt;[[#ref_tanaka|Tanaka 1993]], pp. 233–235.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Army learned of the presence of the Japanese troops through reports from police and villagers, and on 16 April they dispatched a platoon from the [[2/5th Battalion (Australia)|2/5th Battalion]], led by Lieutenant C. H. Miles, to deal with them.&lt;ref name="long334" /&gt; On 24 April, Miles' platoon came into contact with Takenaga's battalion, and two Japanese soldiers were killed after the two sides exchanged fire.&lt;ref name="hata393"&gt;[[#ref_hata|Hata &amp; Takahashi 1998]], p. 393.&lt;/ref&gt;

Takenaga's troops managed to shake off pursuit by the Australians, but decided that they would surrender. They took a leaflet containing a notice of surrender that one of the soldiers had been carrying, added some conditions underneath in English, tied it to a pole for the Australians to find, and left the area. Scouts from Miles' platoon then found the leaflet and brought it back with them. On 2 May, the Australian platoon spotted Takenaga's unit near Womgrer village, and asked a native to help them make contact. Two truce bearers from the Japanese side came to the Australians to negotiate, and on the following day Takenaga's unit surrendered at Womgrer and were disarmed. At the time of surrender, Takenaga's unit consisted of 42 men: five officers (including Takenaga), four warrant officers, and 33 non-commissioned officers and soldiers. They were equipped with five light machine guns, 17 rifles, five pistols, and 750 rounds of ammunition.&lt;ref name="hata393" /&gt; The prisoners, escorted by Miles' platoon, marched for three days in an orderly fashion to Maprik Airport, and were then transported to Aitape.

The other Japanese forces thought that Takenaga's unit had got lost, and attempted to search for them, but came to know of their surrender through propaganda posters distributed by the Australian Army.&lt;ref name="hata388"&gt;[[#ref_hata|Hata &amp; Takahashi 1998]], p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theories about the decision to surrender ===

There are two theories about the process that led Takenaga's unit to the decision to surrender. The first is that all of the members of the unit were involved in the decision, and the second is that only the officers were involved.

According to [[Ikuhiko Hata]] and Fumio Takahashi, whom Hata depended on for his research, after the battalion commanders agreed to surrender, the other soldiers in Takenaga's unit were assembled to see whether they would agree with the plan. Takahashi and Hata say that according to one of the surviving company commanders, after being told that the surrender was an order from Takenaga, those in favour were asked to raise their hands. Then, when around half of the soldiers did not raise their hands, they were issued hand grenades and told that they should choose their own fate (a Japanese euphemism for suicide). After this, all of the soldiers agreed to the surrender plan.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ref_hata|Hata &amp; Takahashi 1998]], pp. 392–393.&lt;/ref&gt;

An opposing point of view is held by Kiyohiko Satō, who says that only the battalion commanders were asked whether they agreed to the plan, and that the rest of the soldiers were not given a choice. According to Satō, the witnesses mentioned by Hata and Takahashi denied being interviewed on the subject at all. Furthermore, from freshly conducted interviews and from the sergeant major's notes, Satō infers that only the officers and warrant officers were involved in the decision to surrender, and that the other soldiers only received an order.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ref_satoh|Satō 2003]], pp. 136, 138, 143–144.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|According to Satō, when he approached Takahashi about the circumstances of his research, Takahashi falsely claimed that the witnesses he cited had since died, and said that his article in the journal ''Rekishi to Jinbutsu'' (History and People) had contained a certain amount of dramatisation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ref_satoh|Satō 2003]], pp. 109–111.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}

== Background ==
[[File:Aust soldiers Wewak June 1945.jpg|thumb|Australian soldiers attacking the Japanese Army in [[Wewak District]], June 1945.|alt=Black and white photograph of two Australian soldiers taking cover behind an embankment. One is aiming his rifle over the top.]]

In the [[New Guinea campaign]], the [[Eighteenth Army (Japan)|Eighteenth Army]] of Japan were left behind the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] front, and although their position was of no strategic value, they still continued to fight. After United States forces crushed the 18th Army's counteroffensive in the [[Battle of Driniumor River]], the Japanese were left alone. However, when the Australian Army took over the New Guinea campaign in the second half of 1944, they decided to do a thorough cleanup of the remaining Japanese forces.

The strength of the Japanese forces was greatly weakened, as their naval supply lines had been cut and they had lost most of their existing supplies at Driniumor River. While the usual size of a Japanese Army division in wartime was 20,000 troops, at the start of May, 1945, this had been reduced to only around 1000.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ref_sosyo|Military Archives 1975]], p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The combined weaponry of the 41st and [[20th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|20th]] Divisions was also reduced to 1 mortar, 20 heavy machine guns, and 24 light machine guns. There was even a shortage of pistols, and only 20–30 rounds available for each.&lt;/ref&gt; Takenaga's unit was no exception: while it was a battalion in name, in terms of numbers it was on the scale of a platoon, and at that one with only around half the usual number of infantry. The rest of the unit was made up of former mountain artillery from the 41st Division, whose squads were disbanded when all of their guns were destroyed at Driniumor River, and marines, among others. Takenaga himself was an artillery specialist, and had been moved to the 239th Infantry Regiment from his post as commander of the 3rd Battalion, 41st Mountain Artillery Regiment. The 18th Army had predicted that their food and medicine would run out by September, 1945, and that their weapons would become unusable by the end of the year. The situation was so dire that in July the 18th Army gave the order (18th Army Order No. 371) that the entirety of its forces should adhere to ''gyokusai'', or honourable death without surrender, a move unprecedented even among the Imperial Army.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ref_sosyo|Military Archives 1975]], p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; One second lieutenant reflected that in the final stages of the campaign, the army had stopped being an army and had become a band of beggars.&lt;ref name="sosyo408"&gt;[[#ref_sosyo|Military Archives 1975]], p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

The severity of the situation that the Japanese Army faced in New Guinea is demonstrated by the incidents of [[cannibalism]] that occurred there. Some commentators think that Takenaga's unit was among those where cannibalism was practised. There was suspicion that directly before they surrendered, Takenaga's unit ate the body of one of the villagers from Tau that had been killed in the fighting there, and the Australian Army decided to investigate. When they interrogated the prisoners from Takenaga's unit, they received statements indicating that some of the unit had been involved in eating the villager, but that the soldiers responsible had since died. For this reason, the Australian Army did not bring any charges of cannibalism against the prisoners. There are also records from survivors written after the war admitting that they were involved. From the fact that Australian Army records state that Takenaga's unit was healthy and orderly, [[Yuki Tanaka (historian)|Yuki Tanaka]] infers that the whole unit regularly practised cannibalism as a group.&lt;ref name="tanaka233" /&gt; Kiyohiko Satō, while admitting that some of the unit members were involved in cannibalism, casts doubt over Tanaka's conclusions by pointing to evidence such as descriptions in notes left by the soldiers that suggests cannibalism was not a group practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ref_satoh|Satō 2003]], pp. 154–155.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hatazo Adachi.jpg|thumb|upright|Lieutenant General [[Hatazō Adachi]] of the [[Eighteenth Army (Japan)|Eighteenth Army]].|alt=Black and White portrait of Adachi in military dress.]]

In order to uphold the [[Senjinkun military code]], it was considered extremely dishonourable to become an enemy prisoner in Japan at the time, even in a situation as desperate as the one faced by the Japanese Army in New Guinea. In the Japanese Army Penal Code, commanding officers ordering their troops to surrender was treated as a form of desertion, and even when troops gave their all in battle, surrender was still punishable by six months' imprisonment (article 41). Lieutenant General [[Hatazō Adachi]], commander of the 18th Army, also gave an order on 18 March 1945, telling his soldiers that they should under no circumstances bring upon themselves the shame of being taken prisoner. As a result, examples of the Japanese Army surrendering as a group are extremely rare. Apart from Takenaga's unit, the only other examples of group surrender by the Japanese Army in the Pacific War were two other groups in New Guinea that are discussed below, and the Army Naval Raiding Squadron, commanded by Umezawa and defending [[Zamami Island]], in the [[Battle of Okinawa]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#ref_hata|Hata &amp; Takahashi 1998]], pp. 466–467.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Takenaga's unit was not the first example; there was a previous incident in May, 1905, at the [[Battle of Mukden]] in the [[Russo-Japanese War]], where 42 survivors of a company of the 49th Infantry Regiment of the 1st Division were all taken prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ref_hukiura|Fukiura 1990]], pp. 170–171.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a trend among the Australian Army to kill Japanese soldiers who attempted to surrender. There was an unspoken agreement among front-line Australian soldiers to kill all Japanese soldiers without taking any prisoners, and these actions were given tacit consent from the Australian command.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ref_tanaka|Tanaka 1993]], pp. 247–248.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==

Takenaga's unit were held in Aitape for around one month, before being broken up and sent to prison camps in [[Lae]] and in Australia, where they received good treatment. They were all interrogated, and in particular, Lieutenant Colonel Takenaga was transported to [[Manila]] for a detailed interrogation. As well as giving character information about the commanders of the 18th Army, Takenaga gave his opinion of how the Allies should deal with Emperor Hirohito: "If the Emperor is killed then the Japanese people will resist until the bitter end, but if there is an order from the Emperor then they will probably surrender peacefully."&lt;ref&gt;[[#ref_hata|Hata &amp; Takahashi 1998]], pp. 400–401.&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for interrogation, the soldiers in Takenaga's unit had invented false personal and unit names before their surrender, but from documents seized in [[Wewak District]] the Australian Army recognised these as falsehoods. Some of the prisoners also helped with translation of seized documents and with propaganda broadcasts urging the Japanese Army to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ref_satoh|Satō 2003]], p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Takenaga's surrender, the 18th Army continued to fight in New Guinea until the end of the war on 15 August 1945. To replace Takenaga's unit, the 2nd Battalion of the 239th Infantry Regiment was reformed with new members.{{#tag:ref|On paper, the reformed battalion consisted of the battalion headquarters, two infantry companies, and one machine-gun company. In practice, it was on the same scale as Takenaga's unit: around one platoon's worth of soldiers with only one heavy machine gun.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ref_satoh|Satō 2003]], p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}} However, in August 1945, right before the end of the war, two companies from the reformed 2nd Battalion successively surrendered to the Australians. According to Australian Army records, 12 soldiers and their captain were captured on 10 August, and 16 soldiers and their captain were captured on 11 August.&lt;ref&gt;Long 1963, "[http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070082--1-.PDF Chapter 15: Tazaki and Shiburangu] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217131254/http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070082--1-.PDF |date=2015-02-17 }}", pp. 367–368.&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons are said to include the Australian Army's solicitation for the Japanese forces' surrender, the precedent set by Takenaga's unit, and the fact that they had been ordered to defend their positions to the death.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ref_satoh|Satō 2003]], pp.155, 167.&lt;/ref&gt; The survival rate of the 18th Army after the Battle of Driniumor River was only 25%, a figure significantly lower than the figure of 84% for Takenaga's unit (of the 50 who survived Driniumor, 42 went on to survive the war).&lt;ref&gt;[[#ref_satoh|Satō 2003]], p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

The surrender of Takenaga's unit was seen as an extremely dishonourable act by the Japanese Army. Upon learning of it, Lieutenant General Adachi strongly reprimanded the commanders of the 41st Division,&lt;ref name="hata388" /&gt; and prayed to the emperor, while shedding tears, apologising for his lack of virtue.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ref_satoh|Satō 2003]], pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the war, Takenaga was mostly considered a disgrace, and it was a long time before any light was shone on the Takenaga incident. While Takenaga's surrender was recorded in ''Dai Yonjūichi Nyū Ginia Sakusenshi'' (History of the 41st Division's New Guinea Operation), compiled by people associated with the 41st Division, and in ''[[Senshi Sōsho]]'', a military history of the Pacific War published by the [[Japanese Defense Agency]],&lt;ref name="sosyo385" /&gt; there were also histories that recorded the event as though Takenaga's unit had been wiped out. Awareness of the incident gradually increased after the publication of Fumio Takahashi's article in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;[[#ref_satoh|Satō 2003]], p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; but even as of 2009 there were still military personnel who denied that the surrender occurred. For example, in an interview for [[NHK]], Masao Horie, who was a staff officer for the 18th Army and a major at the time of the incident, said, "Up until now I have never heard of anything like a surrender, and I believe that there were no soldiers who surrendered. If it's true that there was a commander who surrendered, then it is a shame."&lt;ref&gt;[[#ref_nhk|NHK 2009]], pp. 263–264.&lt;/ref&gt;

The former members of Takenaga's unit were repatriated at the end of the war, along with prisoners from other units. Many of them did not join veterans' associations, did not take any interviews, and lived the rest of their lives quietly. Takenaga worked as a private labourer, and died of illness in 1967. He did not suffer any particular discrimination from his former classmates in the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]], and they attended his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ref_satoh|Satō 2003]], pp. 160–161.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bari Teatro Petruzzelli Epoca.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Teatro Petruzzelli shortly after its completion]]
The '''Teatro Petruzzelli''' is the largest [[theatre]] of the city of [[Bari]] and the fourth Italian theatre by size.

==History==
===The birth and the golden age===
The history of the Teatro Petruzzelli of Bari begins when Onofrio and Antonio Petruzzelli, traders and ship builders of [[Trieste]], presented the designs for the theatre drawn up by their brother-in-law, the engineer Angelo Bari Cicciomessere (then Messeni) to the city of Bari.  The proposal for building the Petruzzelli was accepted and, on 29 January 1896, a contract was signed between the family and the city administration. Two years later, in October 1898, work began and it ended in 1903. 

The interior of the theatre was painted by [[Raffaele Armenise]]. On completion the Teatro Petruzzelli overtook the Teatro Comunale of [[Corato]] as the largest theatre of [[Apulia]]. The theatre was inaugurated on Saturday, 14 February 1903 with [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]]'s ''[[Les Huguenots]]''. 

In the 1980s, the theatre hosted two major operatic debuts, that of ''[[Iphigénie en Tauride (Piccinni)|Iphigénie en Tauride]]'' by [[Niccolò Piccinni]] which had never been presented after its debut in [[Paris]] in 1779, and the Neapolitan version of [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]]'s ''[[I Puritani]]'', which was written for [[Maria Malibran]] but was never performed by her. Both events contributed to making the city world famous. 

In addition to operas, [[dance|ballet]]s and big concerts were presented. Many great international artists have performed at the Petruzzelli: these include [[Tito Schipa]], [[Herbert von Karajan]], [[Rudolf Nureyev]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Juliette Gréco]]. Great Italian artists include [[Eduardo De Filippo]], [[Riccardo Muti]], [[Carla Fracci]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]], [[Piero Cappuccilli]] and [[Giorgio Gaber]]. 

The Petruzzelli also hosted important concerts of light music (among others concerts by [[Paolo Conte]] and  [[Ornella Vanoni]]) and it was the headquarters of ''Azzurro'', a musical programme, for almost all of the 1980s. The interior was also used as a location by directors such as [[Franco Zeffirelli]] and [[Alberto Sordi]], whose ''[[Polvere di stelle]]'' was shot there.

===The burning and reconstruction===
During the night of  26 and 27 October 1991 the theatre was completely destroyed by [[fire]], the result of [[arson]]. The last opera presented was ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]''. 
[[File:Bari Teatro Petruzzelli 2008 Interno.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Inside the rebuilt theatre]] 
The criminal trial of those accused of setting the fire ended with the acquittal of the defendants and the condemnation of the perpetrators of the incident. 

A civil action followed which involved the Messeni Nemagna family and temporary manager Fernando Pinto, who was accused of failing to insure the theatre, ended with his conviction and the order to pay compensation of 57 billion [[Italian lira|lire]] in favour of the owners of the theatre. On 21 November 2002 the Ministry for Heritage and Cultural Activities signed a "Protocol of Understanding" between the family that owned the theatre and the City, the Province of Bari and the [[Apulia]] Region, stating that the theatre would be rebuilt by 22 November 2006. 

However, since the work of reconstruction never started, on 3 October 2006 the Theatre become the property of the Municipality of Bari in accordance with an Article related to the [[Finance Act]] of 2006.  But on 30 April 2008 the [[Constitutional Court]], in its decision No. 128/2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/giurisprudenza/pronunce/scheda_ultimo_deposito.asp?comando=let&amp;sez=ultimodep&amp;nodec=128&amp;annodec=2008&amp;trmd=&amp;trmm= Sentenza della Corte Costituzionale] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509103521/http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/giurisprudenza/pronunce/scheda_ultimo_deposito.asp?comando=let&amp;sez=ultimodep&amp;nodec=128&amp;annodec=2008&amp;trmd=&amp;trmm= |date=9 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
ordered that the Theatre be given back to the Messeni Nemagna family. 

The Petruzzelli, reconstructed entirely with public money in 2008, was returned to the City of Bari on 7 September 2009 for breach of article 5 of the contract dated 29 January 1896 between the City of Bari and Antonio Onofrio and Petruzzelli. The article stated: "In the event that the building collapses because of an earthquake, fire or for any other cause, the grantee and its successors would have the right to rebuild the Politeama to its original state, provided that the work was undertaken within a year and be completed in three years from the date on which the collapse has occurred, or have a duty to clear the land and leave it free of debris and return it to the City within a year counting from the above term." 

The Fondazione Lirico Sinfonica Petruzzelli e Teatri di Bari was eventually identified as the only entity  able to assume the management, maintenance and insurance of the Teatro Petruzzelli, based on what was written in former Article 23 of Law 800, which states that municipalities must make theatres available for opera companies after the end of concert seasons. The Teatro Petruzzelli officially reopened Sunday 4 October 2009, nearly 18 years after the fire, with a performance of the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] by the Orchestra of the Province of Bari, conducted by Fabio Mastrangelo. 

On 6 December 2009 the first opera season in the re-built theatre began with ''[[Turandot]]'' by [[Giacomo Puccini]], directed by Roberto De Simone, the orchestral under the direction of Maestro Renato Palumbo.

===Announcement of cancellation of planned programmes===
Due to the economic situation in Italy, it was announced that the opera house has cancelled its October and November 2014 presentations.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Braw, [http://www.newsweek.com/2014/08/15/lights-go-out-italys-fourth-largest-opera-house-263569.html "The Lights Go Out On Italy's Fourth Largest Opera House"], ''Newsweek'', 8 August 2014 on newsweek.com&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE the first paragraph without prior consensus, see [[Talk:The Eighth (United States)]]. --&gt;'''The Eighth''' was a [[Federal holidays in the United States|federal holiday]] in the [[United States]] from 1828 until 1861 commemorating the U.S. victory in the [[Battle of New Orleans]] on January 8, 1815.&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE the first paragraph without prior consensus, see [[Talk:The Eighth (United States)]]. --&gt;

==Origins==
The Eighth was celebrated widely across the [[Southern United States]] after the [[War of 1812]]. January 8 became an official federal holiday in 1828, following [[United States presidential election, 1828|Andrew Jackson's election as president]] and continued as such from that time until the start of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The holiday remains largely forgotten by the American public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The War of 1812: Official National Park Service Handbook |editor=[[National Park Service]]. Northeast Regional Office |date=2013 |location=Fort Washington, PA |publisher=[[Eastern National]] |page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Bryan (Ohio) Times'' article from January 4, 2005, the Battle of New Orleans was a "major turning point" in American history, but many people who live in [[New Orleans]] did not even know that the battle happened in their city. As it was the final war waged against the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], some consider it to be America's second [[independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gerome |first=John |date=January 4, 2005 |title=The Battle of New Orleans was once a national holiday |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=799&amp;dat=20050104&amp;id=hsBOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=h0kDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5012,160153&amp;hl=en |work=The Bryan Times |volume=57 |number=2 |location=Bryan, Ohio |agency=[[Associated Press]] |page=10 |access-date=October 17, 2017 |via=[[Google News Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians recall the celebrations were larger than [[Christmas]] and were only surpassed by [[Independence Day (United States)|The Fourth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Herstein |first=Beth |date=January 8, 2010 |title=War Stories |url=http://www.livingneworleans.com/?p=3625 |magazine=New Orleans Living Magazine |access-date=October 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "'''Unplug America - Give Mother Earth a Rest Day'''" tradition was started in 1992 by [[Indigenous Peoples]] and is observed on October 13 each year. It is a day to live simply and [[off grid]], enjoy the nature around you and breathe fresh air. Unplug your TV, computers... and take a walk. The campaign focuses primarily on America because of massively high per capita consumption in the US.

In the early 1990s, the UNPLUG from Mother Earth Campaign was initiated by three Indigenous-based organizations. These organizations and leaders were [[Tom B.K. Goldtooth]], [[Indigenous Environmental Network]] (IEN); [[Winona LaDuke]], Indigenous Women's Network (IWN)and Christopher Peters, 7th Generation Fund (SGF). Nilak Butler (deceased), member of IEN and IWN also assisted in the development of this UNPLUG Campaign during the 1990s in her capacity as an Indigenous staff organizer within the Indigenous Nuclear Free Campaign of U.S. Greenpeace. Periodically throughout the 1990s and 2000s the UNPLUG from Mother Earth Campaign was initiated by these organizations, expanding to include other organizations such as Honor The Earth and White Earth Land Recovery Project. There is no ownership of the concept of this campaign. It has been the principle of IEN, IWN and SGF for people of the United States, Canada, other industrialized countries and of the world to adopt this campaign.

The '''V de V Challenge Monoplace''' is a single-seater racing series active in Europe. The series was founded in 2010 set up by [[V de V Sports]].

==History==
The series was founded in 2010 and originally divided into three sub classes. The series saw the light as the [[Tatuus]] FR2000, which was abundant in Europe, was replaced by the [[Barazi-Epsilon]] FR2.0-10 in various [[Formula Renault]] series. The Tatuus FR2000 formed Class A along with 1990-2007 [[Formula 3]] cars and [[Van Diemen]] [[Formula X]] cars. During the inaugural season only Tatuus FR2000 competed in Class A. Class B was open for the Tatuus FR1600, 1995-1999 Formula Renault cars, [[Formula Ford Zetec]] cars and [[Formula Renault Campus]]. Finally, Class C was open for [[Formula BMW]] and other single seaters with a motorbike engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monoplace &gt;&gt; Challenge MONOPLACE |url=http://www.vdev.fr/monospace_challenge.html |website=V de V |accessdate=18 December 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304113449/http://www.vdev.fr/monospace_challenge.html |archivedate=4 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural race was run at [[Circuit de Haute Saingonge]] near [[La Genétouze, Charente-Maritime]]. Experienced gentleman racer [[Philippe Haezebrouck]] won Class A and the overall championship. As of 2011 the [[Tatuus N.T07]] was accepted in the series. The car previously raced in the [[International Formula Master]] between 2007 [[International Formula Master|2007]] and [[2009 International Formula Master|2009]]. The car formed Class A along with older Formula 3 chassis. The Tatuus FR2000 was relegated into Class B along with Formula X. Grids grew in the sophomore season as the series visited Spain for the first time, at [[Circuito del Jarama|Jarama]] and [[Ciudad del Motor de Aragón|Motorland Aragon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Single-seater &gt;&gt; SINGLE-SEATER V de V Challenge |url=http://www.vdev.fr/singleseater_challenge.html |website=V de V |accessdate=18 December 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920040845/http://www.vdev.fr/singleseater_challenge.html |archivedate=20 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Young [[Simon Gachet]] won Class B and the overall championship, as it was still the most abundant car in the field. For 2012 the class rules were again amended with the [[Scuderia Coloni|Coloni]] CN1/98 [[1998 Euro Open by Nissan|Formula Nissan]] added to Class A. [[Hugo Blanchot]] won the overall championship scored ten podium finishes in fifteen races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Single-seater V de V Challenge 2012 standings|url=https://www.driverdb.com/championships/standings/single-seater-v-de-v-challenge/2012/|website=DriverDB.com|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2013 the Tatuus FR2000 was further relegated into Class C. As the [[Barazi-Epsilon]] FR2.0-10 was replaced by the Tatuus FR 2.0-13 the car was accepted in Class B. Tatuus [[Formula Abarth]] chassis were also added to Class C. [[John Filippi]] won the overall championship in a Tatuus N.T07 as the Baraz-Epsilon car became more prominent but was not as fast at the Tatuus. 

As of 2014 also current spec Formula Renault cars were allowed by the V de V organisation, starting with the Tatuus FR 2.0-13. The car was allowed in Class A as Formula Master cars and Formula 3 cars were no longer allowed. Italian driver [[Daniele Cazzaniga]] won the series in 2014 with eight 2013 spec Formula Renault cars filling the top ten. The following season the class distribution remained the same with [[David Droux]] winning the overall championship.

'''Yazid ibn al-Muhallab''' ({{lang-ar|يزيد بن المهلب}}) (672–720) was a provincial governor in the time of the [[Umayyad dynasty]] and the progenitor of the [[Muhallabid]] family that became important in early [[Abbasid]] times.

In [[Anno Hegirae|A.H.]] 78 (697-698 CE) [[al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]], the Caliphate's viceroy of the eastern provinces, appointed Yazid's father [[al-Muhallab ibn Abi Suffrah]] as governor of [[Khurasan]]. In A.H. 82 (701-702) al-Muhallab's son Mughirah died and al-Muhallab sent Yazid to replace him. Soon afterwards al-Muhallab died and al-Hajjaj appointed Yazid governor of Khurasan.  There Yazid confronted external and internal enemies, including some rebels entering his province who were supporters of [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath]]. Yazid defeated them. Yazid seized Nizak's fortress and made peace with him.

In A.H. 85 (704-705) al-Hajjaj replaced Yazid naming his younger brother [[al-Mufaddal ibn al-Muhallab|al-Mufaddal]] governor of Khurasan.  Various reasons are suggested, including that al-Hajjaj encountered a prophecy that his successor would be named Yazid and al-Hajjaj considered this Yazid the only one threatening enough to worry about.  Al-Hajjaj imprisoned and tortured Yazid. In A.H. 90 (708-709) Yazid disguised escaped and made his way to Palestine where he was granted refuge by [[Suleiman ibn Abd al-Malik]]. Al-Hajjaj pressed Caliph [[al-Walid I]] who commanded his brother to send him Yazid in chains. Suleiman had his own son chained to Yazid approach the caliph and speak favouring Yazid's safety. Al-Walid accepted this and told al-Hajjaj to desist. Yazid returned to Suleiman and the two were very close to each other.

When Suleiman came to the throne in A.H. 96 (715), he appointed Yazid to govern [[Iraq]]. The next year Suleiman appointed Yazid governor of Khurasan. Yazid fought in Jurjan and Tabaristan, personally engaging in combat. In A.H. 99 (717-718) the new caliph [[Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz]] dismissed Yazid due to his tortures against people of conquered territories, especially [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and [[Sogd]]s.  Yazid was captured on his way to Basra and brought before Umar who intensely disliked him. Umar imprisoned Yazid. In A.H. 101 (719-720) when Umar fell ill, Yazid escaped. Umar died.

Yazid approached Basra. Many joined him. He refused to swear allegiance to the new caliph, [[Yazid II]]. He attacked those holding his brothers, defeated them and freed his brothers. His son Khalid was arrested in Kufah and sent to Damascus where he remained in prison until he died. Yazid was advised to head east, but he declined to follow this advice. In A.H. 102 (720-721) [[Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik]] and [[al-Abbas ibn al-Walid]] led forces against him. On August 25, Maslamah's troops advanced to battle, frightening some of Yazid's men who fled. Yazid had these beheaded. He then rode directly at Maslamah. Maslamah's cavalry intercepted him and cut him down.

Fighting continued. In Wasit, Yazid's son Mu'awiyah on news of his father's death executed some prisoners, including [['Adi ibn Artah al-Fazari|Adi ibn Artat]], the Basran governor who had sent Yazid to Umar in A.H. 99. Mu'awiyah and other surviving members of the Yazid's family sailed to Bahrayn, then near Kirman. They advanced to Qandabil where they were denied entrance. There was a glorious fight in which all but two died, those two making their way to Zabulistan. Some captured boys were sent to Yazid II who beheaded them.
