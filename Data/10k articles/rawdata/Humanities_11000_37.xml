'''Americana''' is a collective term for [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] related to the history, geography, folklore and cultural heritage of the [[United States of America]]. It is generally defined as any collection of materials and things concerning or characteristic of the United States or of the [[American people]]; in its broadest sense, Americana is representative or even stereotypical of [[culture of the United States|American culture]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/americana|title=Americana|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/americana|title=Americana|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

What is and is not considered Americana is heavily influenced by national identity, historical context, patriotism and nostalgia. The [[ethos]] or guiding beliefs or ideals which have come to characterize America, such as [[The American Dream]], are central to the idea. American historian [[Hampton Sides]] wrote in ''[[Americana (book)|Americana: Dispatches from the New Frontier]]'':

{{quote|The United States of America is such as glorious mess of contradiction, such a crazy quilt of competing themes, such a fecund mishmash of people and ideas, that defining us is pretty much pointless. There is, of course, a kind of faded notion of "Americana", one that concerns Route 66, diners, freak rock formations, and the like—but even in it's halcyon days this "roadside attraction" version of America was never an accurate or nuanced distillation of our massively complicated culture.

There are scenes and places, wattages and personages, that belong—inextricably, unmistakably—to this country alone. There is an American quality, a tone, an energy ... instantly recognizable ..."&lt;ref name="Americana: Dispatches from the New Frontier"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sides|first=Hampton|title=Americana: Dispatches from the New Frontier|date=2007|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=1400033551|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hXeRDJTlQkQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Americana&amp;pg=PT7#v=onepage&amp;q=Americana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2018}}}}

Many kinds of cultural artifacts fall within the definition of Americana: the things involved need not be old, but are usually associated with some quintessential element of the American experience. Each period of [[History of the United States|United States history]] is reflected by the advertising and marketing of the time, and the various types of antiques, collectibles, memorabilia and vintage items from these time periods are typical of what is popularly considered Americana. ''[[The Atlantic]]'' described the term as "slang for the comforting, middle-class ephemera at your average antique store—things like needle-pointed pillows, [[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[daguerreotype]]s, and engraved silverware sets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/08/why-is-a-music-genre-called-americana-so-overwhelmingly-white-and-male/278267/|title=Why Is a Music Genre Called 'Americana' So Overwhelmingly White and Male?|author=Giovanni Russonello|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Americana encompasses not only material objects but also people, places, concepts and historical eras which are popularly identified with American culture.

The name "Americana" also refers to [[Americana (music)|Americana music]], a genre of contemporary music which incorporates elements of various American music styles, including country, roots-rock, folk, bluegrass and blues, resulting in a distinctive roots-oriented sound.&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shriver|first=Jerry|title=Grammys will be putting Americana on the map|journal=USA Today|date=31 August 2009|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2009-08-30-americana-main_N.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Grammy&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Grammy Category Descriptions|url=http://entry.grammy.com/eop/Resources/54CatDescGuide.pdf|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Americana as nostalgia==
From the mid to late 20th century, Americana was largely conceptualized as a [[nostalgia]] for an idealized life in small towns and cities in the United States around the turn of the century, roughly in the period between 1880 and the [[World War I|First World War]], popularly considered "The Good Old Days".&lt;ref name="Sears 1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=Stephen |title=Hometown U.S.A. |year=1975 |publisher=American Heritage |location=New York |isbn=0-671-22079-9 |pages=6–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that much of the structure of 20th-century American life and culture had been cemented in that time and place. American author [[Henry Seidel Canby]] wrote:

{{quote|"It is the small town, the small city, that is our heritage. We have made twentieth-century America from it, and some account of these communities as they were ... we owe our children and grandchildren."&lt;ref name="Canby"&gt;{{cite book |last=Canby |first=Henry Seidel |title=The Age of Confidence: Life in the Nineties |year=1934 |publisher=Farrar &amp; Rinehart |location=New York |asin=B000857UVO}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The nostalgia for this period was based on a remembrance of confidence in American life that had emerged during the period due to such factors as a sense that the [[American frontier|frontier]] had finally been "conquered", with the [[U.S. Census Bureau]]'s declaration that it was "closed" in 1890, as well as the recent victory in the [[Spanish–American War]].&lt;ref name="Sears 1" /&gt; By 1912, the contiguous United States was at last fully politically incorporated, and the idea of the nation as a single, solid unity could begin to take hold.

As Canby put it,

{{quote|Americans at this time "really believed all they heard on the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] or read in school readers. They set on one plane of time, and that the present, the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the [[manifest destiny]] of America, the new plumbing, the growth of the factory system, the morning paper, and the church sociable. It was all there at once, better than elsewhere, their own, and permanent. ... They had just the country they wanted...and they believed it would be the same, except for more bathtubs and faster trains, forever ... for the last time in living memory everyone knew exactly what it meant to be an American."&lt;ref name="Canby" /&gt;}}

On growing up [[Italian-American]], novelist [[Don DeLillo]] stated:

{{quote|"It’s no accident that my first novel was called Americana. This was a private declaration of independence, a statement of my intention to use the whole picture, the whole culture. America was and is the immigrant's dream, and as the son of two immigrants I was attracted by the sense of possibility that had drawn my grandparents and parents." (from ''Conversations With Don DeLillo'')&lt;ref name="Conversations with Don DeLillo"&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeLillo|first1=Don|title=Conversations with Don DeLillo|date=January 13, 2005|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=1578067049|page=88|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIOdBrl1keUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The [[zeitgeist]] of this idealized period is captured in the [[Disneyland]] theme park's [[Main Street, U.S.A.]] section (which was inspired by both [[Walt Disney]]'s hometown of [[Marceline, Missouri]] and [[Harper Goff]]'s childhood home of [[Fort Collins, Colorado]]),&lt;ref name="fort-collins.co.us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.ci.fort-collins.co.us/Local_history/Topics/legends/disney.htm |title=Local History Archive Larimer Legends - Old Town &amp; Disneyland - City of Fort Collins, Colorado |publisher=Library.ci.fort-collins.co.us |date= |accessdate=2013-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125183538/http://library.ci.fort-collins.co.us/Local_history/Topics/legends/disney.htm |archivedate=2009-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the musical and movie ''[[The Music Man]]'' and [[Thornton Wilder]]'s stage play ''[[Our Town]]''.&lt;ref name="Sears 1" /&gt; Especially revered in nostalgic Americana are small-town institutions like the barber shop,&lt;ref name="Sears 2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=Stephen |title=Hometown U.S.A. |year=1975 |publisher=American Heritage |location=New York |isbn=0-671-22079-9 |pages=12–13, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; drug store, soda fountain and ice cream parlor;&lt;ref name="Sears 3"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=Stephen |title=Hometown U.S.A. |year=1975 |publisher=American Heritage |location=New York |isbn=0-671-22079-9 |pages=12–13, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of these were eventually resurrected by mid-twentieth century nostalgia for the time period in businesses like the [[Farrell's Ice Cream Parlour]] chain, with its 1890s theme.&lt;ref name="franchise"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nrn.com/corporate/farrells-looks-restart-growth |title=Farrell's looks to restart growth Owner outlines expansion plans for iconic ice cream chain |date=August 31, 2010 |work=Nation's Restaurant News |accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arabic miniatures''' are small [[painting]]s on [[paper]], usually book or manuscript illustrations but also sometimes separate artworks. The earliest date from around 1000 AD, with a flourishing of the artform from around 1200 AD.&lt;ref name=DavidCollection&gt;{{cite web |title=Miniature Painting |url=https://www.davidmus.dk/en/collections/islamic/materials/miniatures |publisher=The David Collection |accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MMA1933"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Islamic Miniature Painting and Book Illumination |journal=Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art |date=October 1933 |volume=28 |issue=10 |pages=166–171 |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3255467.pdf.bannered.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic miniature artists include [[al-Jazari]], who illustrated his own ''Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices''.&lt;ref name=Jazari&gt;al-Jazari, ''The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices: Kitáb fí ma'rifat al-hiyal al-handasiyya'', transl. &amp; anno.

A '''Bible case''' is a small, generally rectangular shaped bag, the primary purpose of which is to protect the owner's [[Bible]] from damage and also to allow the owner to easily identify their bible from others. They are made from a number of different materials, amongst the most popular being, [[leather]], [[denim]] and [[suede]]. Most are fastened with a [[Zipper|zip]] although some may use [[snap fastener]]s. The cases are generally only slightly larger than the bibles themselves and are therefore available in many different sizes.

It is not unusual to see decoration on bible cases such as pictures or bright colours. Some cases have handles on them in a similar style to [[briefcase]]s. Further personalisation can be made by adding the owners name or a bible quote. Many cases have several compartments or zipped sections in which to store useful items that are bible related such a [[hymn|hymn book]], [[note pad]] or [[pen]].

The historical forebear of the bible case is the [[bible box]], which is still in use although on a smaller scale than bible cases. The advantage of the case is that it is cheaper and more portable, whilst boxes offer more protection and lessen the chance of bibles, especially more expensive ones, being lost.

The '''''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society''''' is an [[academic journal]] on the [[history of science]] published annually by the [[Royal Society]]. It publishes [[obituaries]] of [[Fellow of the Royal Society|Fellows]] of the [[Royal Society]]. It was established in 1932 as ''Obituary Notices of Fellows of the Royal Society'' and obtained its current title in 1955, with volume numbering restarting at 1. Prior to 1932, obituaries were published in the ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society]]''.

The memoirs are a significant historical record and most include a full [[bibliography]] of works by the subjects. The memoirs are often written by a scientist of the next generation, often one of the subject's own former students, or a close colleague. In many cases the author is also a Fellow. Notable biographies published in this journal include [[Albert Einstein]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rsbm.1955.0005 |title=Albert Einstein. 1879-1955 |year=1955 |last1=Whittaker |first1=E. |journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society |volume=1 |pages=37-67}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Turing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rsbm.1955.0019 |title=Alan Mathison Turing. 1912-1954 |year=1955 |last1=Newman |first1=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2006">A '''book token''' is a type of gift [[voucher]] redeemable in hundreds of participating [[bookshop]]s as an alternative to [[cash]].

== History ==
The term "book token" was first coined in the 1920s by Harold Raymond, an English publisher who noticed that for Christmas his friends had received a collective total of only three books out of 119 total gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/weekend/story/0,,2210824,00.html |title=An appreciation of a token |date=2007-11-17|accessdate=2007-12-25 |last=Mangan |first=Lucy |coauthors= |publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that some sort of coupon could be used to take the risk out of book gift giving. Book tokens were officially distributed in 1932. They were sold that November, just in time for the holidays.  

In the 1990s, "lick and stick" stamps were replaced with tokens in voucher form, to resemble British currency.

== Current versions ==
=== UK ===
{{main|National Book Tokens}}
Book Tokens Ltd (part of the Booksellers Association Group of Companies) was established as the sole issuer of book tokens in the UK. They have now grown into one of the largest multi-retail gift cards in the UK and Ireland and were renamed "National Book Tokens" in 2000, the year the tokens were also sold online for the first time by firstbookshop.com. The seller of electronic book tokens promises the gift card will be able to be used at any time at all reputable book sellers with the exception of airports and some train stations. The cards do expire every two years but can be replaced for free. Gift givers can choose from different designs and receive promotions such as free books by Penguin when spending more than a certain amount.

=== Other countries ===

National book voucher schemes are also run in the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]] and [[Switzerland]].

==Introduction==
Theravada Buddhist cosmology describes the 31 planes of existence in which rebirth takes place. The order of the planes are found in various discourses of [[Gautama Buddha]] in the Sutta Pitaka. For example, in the [[Saleyyaka Sutta]] of the [[Majjhima Nikaya]] the Buddha mentioned the planes above the human plane in ascending order.&lt;ref&gt;Nanamoli Bhikkhu, The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha. Wisdom Publications,1995, page 1186.&lt;/ref&gt; In several [[sutra|suttas]] in the [[Anguttara Nikaya]], the Buddha described the causes of rebirth in these planes in the same order. In Buddhism, the ''[[Deva (Buddhism)|devas]]'' are not immortal gods that play a creative role in the cosmic process. They are simply elevated beings who had been reborn in the celestial planes as a result of their words, thoughts, and actions. Usually, they are just as much in bondage to delusion and desire as human beings, and as in need of guidance from the Enlightened One. The Buddha is the "teacher of devas and humans (satthadevamanussanam). The devas came to visit the Buddha in the night. The Devatasamyutta and the Devaputtasamyutta of the Samyutta Nikaya gives a record of their conversations. The devaputtas are young devas newly arisen in heavenly planes, and devatas are mature deities.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi, Bhikkhu (trans.) (2000). The Connected Discourses of the Buddha: A New Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya. Boston: Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-331-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are more than 10,000 [[crore]] (100 billion) solar systems in our Galaxy, and more than 10,000 crore (100 billion) galaxies in our Universe. There are many Universes in space. Past and future lives may occur on other planets. The data for the 31 planes of existence in samsara are compiled from the Majjhima Nikaya, Anguttara Nikaya, [[Samyutta Nikaya]], [[Digha Nikaya]], [[Khuddaka Nikaya]], and others. The 31 planes of existence can be perceived by a Buddha's Divine eye (''dibbacakkhu'') and some of his awakened disciples through the development of ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhana]]'' meditation. According to the ''suttas'', a Buddha can access all these planes and know all his past lives as well as those of other beings.

In the Maha-Saccaka Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya of the Pali Canon, Gautama Buddha said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away &amp; reappearance of beings. I saw — by means of the divine eye, purified &amp; surpassing the human — beings passing away &amp; re-appearing, and I discerned how they are inferior &amp; superior, beautiful &amp; ugly, fortunate &amp; unfortunate in accordance with their kamma: 'These beings — who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, &amp; mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views — with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell. But these beings — who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech &amp; mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views — with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destinations, in the heavenly world.' Thus — by means of the divine eye, purified &amp; surpassing the human — I saw beings passing away &amp; re-appearing, and I discerned how they are inferior &amp; superior, beautiful &amp; ugly, fortunate &amp; unfortunate in accordance with their kamma.&lt;ref&gt;Nanamoli Bhikkhu, The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha. Wisdom Publications,1995, page 1070.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the Itivuttaka edition of the Khuddaka Nikaya and in the Māpuññabhāyi Sutta of the Anguttara Nikaya, the Buddha told about his past lives:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Whenever the eon contracted I reached the "Plane of Streaming Radiance", and when the eon expanded I arose in an empty divine mansion. And there I was Brahma, the great Brahma, the unvanquished victor, the all-seeing, the all-powerful. Thirty-six times I was Sakka, ruler of the devas. And many hundreds of times I was a wheel-turning monarch, righteous, a king of righteousness, conqueror of the four regions of the earth, maintaining stability in the land, in possession of the seven treasures.&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, In the Buddha's Words. Wisdom Publications, 2005, page 588.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Māpuññabhāyi Sutta, Aṅgutarra Nikaya 7.59: Pali Text Society, A iv 88-89&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Causes for rebirth in various planes===
The process by which sentient beings migrate from one state of existence to another is dependent on causes and conditions. The three causes are giving or charity, moral conduct, meditative development, and their opposites. Rebirth in the [[Kama-loka]] depends on a person's moral conduct and practice of giving. Rebirth in the [[Trailokya|Rupa-loka]] and [[Trailokya|Arupa-loka]] also requires meditation development. Liberation from all rebirth requires wisdom in addition to moral conduct and meditation.

About the cycle of rebirth, [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], a scholar monk who has translated numerous texts from the Pali Canon, writes that beyond all planes of existence is the unconditioned [[Nibbana]], the final goal of the Buddha's teaching: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A blissful heavenly rebirth, however, is not the final purpose for which the Buddha taught the Dhamma. At best it is only a temporary way station. The ultimate goal is the cessation of suffering, and the bliss of the heavens, no matter how blissful, is not the same as the cessation of suffering.  According to the Buddha's teaching, all states of existence within the round of rebirths, even the heavens, are transient, unreliable, bound up with pain. Thus, the ultimate aim of the Dhamma is nothing short of liberation, which means total release from the round of rebirth and death.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi, Bhikkhu (ed.) (2005). In The Words of the Buddha: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon. Boston: Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-491-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Liberation from rebirth===
Liberation from the rounds of rebirth requires more than just meditation achievement. It is necessary to apply ''[[Yoniso Manasikara]]'' after emerging from ''[[Samma Samadhi]]'' (1st to 4th jhana) in order to arrive at a breakthrough by wisdom. The [[Udana]] shows that after emerging from the ''[[jhana]]s'', the Buddha directed his attention to the cause of ''[[dukkha]]'' and the way leading to its cessation. This process culminates in the discovery of ''[[Pratītyasamutpāda]]'' (dependent origination) and the [[Four Noble Truths]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When the seven days had come to a close, the Exalted One arose from the state of trance and in the first watch of the night, thoroughly thought out the chain of cause and effect, in direct order, thus; "If there is this (state), another (state) arises, by the arising of this (state), a (state) is produced, that is to say:
"From Ignorance spring Fabrications, from Fabrications springs Consciousness, from Consciousness spring Mind and Material Form, from Mind and Material Form, the six Organs of Sense, from the six Organs of Sense, Contact, from Contact, Sensations, from Sensations, Desire, from Desire, Attachment, from Attachment, Becoming, from Becoming, Birth, from Birth spring Decay, Death, Sorrow, Lamentation, Pain, Grief and Despair. Thus, the whole mass of suffering originates".&lt;ref&gt;Strong, Dawsonne. ( trans. ) (2010). The Udana: The Solemn Utterances of the Buddha. Charleston: [[Nabu Press]]. {{ISBN|1-149-10776-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"By the destruction of Ignorance, Fabrications are destroyed, by the destruction of Fabrications, Consciousness is destroyed, by the destruction of Consciousness, Mind and Material Form are destroyed, by the destruction of Mind and Material Form, the six Organs of Sense are destroyed, by the destruction of the six Organs of Sense, Contact is destroyed, by the destruction of Contact, Sensations are destroyed, by the destruction of Sensations, Desire is destroyed, by the destruction of Desire, Attachment is destroyed, by the destruction of Attachment, Becoming is destroyed, by the destruction of Becoming, Birth is destroyed, and by the destruction of Birth, Decay, Death, Sorrow, Lamentation, Pain, Grief and Despair are destroyed. Thus, the whole mass of suffering is brought to an end."&lt;ref&gt;Strong, Dawsonne. ( trans. ) (2010). The Udana: The Solemn Utterances of the Buddha. Charleston: [[Nabu Press]]. {{ISBN|1-149-10776-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The 31 Planes of Existence===

====Arupa-Loka (Formless Realms)====
The immaterial or formless sphere (''arupa loka'') includes four planes into which beings are born as a result of attaining the Four Formless Jhana ''[[Arupajhana|arūpadhyānas]]''. The inhabitants of these realms are possessed entirely of mind. Having no physical form or location, they are unable to hear ''Dhamma'' teachings. They achieve this by attaining the formless ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhana]]'' levels in a previous life, and now enjoy the fruits (''[[vipaka|vipāka]]'') of the good [[karma]] of that accomplishment for a period before rebirth in a lower plane again. They do not interact with the rest of the universe.

* 31 - Sphere of Neither Perception Nor Non-Perception (''nevasannanasannayatanupaga deva''): Rebirth in this plane is a result of attaining the fourth formless ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhana]] in a previous life. The beings in this plane only have mind and no physical body. They are unable to hear Dhamma. In this sphere the formless beings do not engage in "perception". Uddaka Ramaputra's father reached this plane and thought that this is awakening. After having experienced this state the Buddha realized that it will eventually lead to further rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, In the Buddha's Words. Wisdom Publications, 2005, page 801.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 30 - Sphere of Nothingness (''akincannayatanupaga deva''): Rebirth in this plane is a result of attaining the third formless ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhana]]'' in a previous life. This is considered a form of perception, though a very subtle one. This was the sphere reached by Āḷāra Kālāma, [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]]'s first teacher. Alara Kalama thought that it is the state of awakening or liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, In the Buddha's Words. Wisdom Publications, 2005, page 796.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 29 - The Sphere of Infinite Consciousness (''vinnanancayatanupaga deva''): Rebirth in this plane is a result of attaining the second formless ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhana]]''. In this sphere formless beings dwell meditating on their consciousness (''[[vijnana|vijñāna]]'') as infinitely pervasive.  
* 28 - Sphere of Infinite Space (''akasanancayatanupaga deva''): Rebirth in this plane is a result of attaining the first formless ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhana]]''.

====Rupa-Loka (Fine-Material World )====
The fine material sphere (''rupa-loka'') consists of sixteen planes. Beings are reborn into these planes as a result of attaining the form ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhanas]]''. The prevalent mode of experience here is meditative rather than sensory. They have bodies made of fine matter. The sixteen planes correspond to the attainment of the four form ''jhanas''. The ''devas'' of the ''rupa-loka'' have physical forms, but are sexless and passionless. Beings in the lower planes are not able to see beings in planes higher than theirs. The beings of the Form realm are not subject to the extremes of pleasure and pain, or governed by desires for things pleasing to the senses, as the beings of the ''Kāma-loka'' are. The bodies of Form realm beings do not have sexual distinctions. Like the beings of the Arupa-loka, the dwellers in the Rupa-loka have minds corresponding to the ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyānas]]'' (Pāli: jhānas). In their case it is the four lower ''jhanas'' or ''[[Rupajhana|rūpadhyānas]]''.

=====Pure Abodes (Suddhavasa)=====
{{Main|Pure land}}
The [[Pure land#.C5.9Auddh.C4.81v.C4.81sa worlds|Pure Abodes]] are distinct from the other worlds of the ''rupa-loka'' in that they do not house beings who have been born there through ordinary merit or meditative attainments. Birth in these five realms are a result of attaining the fruit of non-returning or ''[[Anagami]]'', the third level of enlightenment. These Pure Abodes are accessible only to those who have destroyed the lower five fetters, consisting of self-view, sceptical doubt, clinging to rites and ceremonies, sense desires, and ill-will.&lt;ref&gt;Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), pp. 31, 95, entries for "Anāgāmin" (retrieved 26 Sep 2007 at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:735.pali{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}) and "Āgāmin" (at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:2587.pali{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}).&lt;/ref&gt; They will destroy their remaining fetters of craving for fine material existence, craving for immaterial existence, conceit, restlessness and ignorance  during their existence in the Pure Abodes. Those who take rebirth here are called "non-returners" because they do not return from that world, but attain final ''nibbana'' there without coming back. They guard and protect Buddhism on earth, and will pass into enlightenment as ''[[Arhat]]s'' when they pass away from the ''[[Pure land#.C5.9Auddh.C4.81v.C4.81sa worlds|Suddhavasa]]'' worlds. According to the Ayacana Sutta, among its inhabitants is [[Brahmā (Buddhism)#Brahm.C4.81 Sahampati|Brahma Sahampati]], who begs the Buddha to teach ''[[Dhamma]]'' to the world.

The five Pure Abodes are:
* 27 - Peerless Devas (''Akanittha deva''): World of ''devas'' "un-equal in rank". The highest of all the ''Rūpadhātu'' worlds, it is often used to refer to the highest extreme of the universe. The current ''[[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra]]'' will eventually be born there.
* 26 - Clear-Sighted Devas (''Sudassi deva''): The "clear-seeing" ''devas'' live in a world similar to and friendly with the {{IAST|Akanitṭha}} world. 
* 25 - Beautiful Devas (''Sudassa deva''): The world of the "beautiful" devas is said to be the place of rebirth for five kinds of ''anāgāmins''. 
* 24 - Untroubled Devas (''Atappa deva''): The world of the "untroubled" devas, for whose company those of lower realms long.
* 23 - Devas not Falling Away (''Aviha deva''): The world of the "not falling" devas, perhaps the most common destination for reborn ''Anāgāmins''. Many achieve arhatship directly in this world, but some pass away and are reborn in sequentially higher worlds of the Pure Abodes until they are at last reborn in the {{IAST|Akanitṭha}} world. These are called in Pāli {{IAST|uddhaṃsotas}}, "those whose stream goes upward".

=====Bṛhatphala Planes=====
These two realms are a result of attaining the fourth jhana. They remain in the tranquil state attained in the 4th Jhana, and is characterized by equanimity ([[Upeksa|{{IAST|upekṣā}}]]).  
* 22 - Unconscious beings (''Asaññasatta''): Realm of mindless beings who have only bodies without consciousness. Rebirth into this plane results from a meditative practice aimed at the suppression of consciousness. Those who take up this practice assume release from suffering can be achieved by attaining unconsciousness. However, when the life span in this realm ends, the beings pass away and are born in other planes where consciousness returns.  
* 21 - Very Fruitful devas (''vehapphala deva''): In the Jhana Sutta of the Anguttara Nikaya the Buddha said "The Vehapphala devas, monks, have a life-span of 500 eons. A run-of-the-mill person having stayed there, having used up all the life-span of those devas, goes to hell, to the animal womb, to the state of the hungry shades."&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro, Bhikkhu (trans.) (2010). Jhana Sutta: Mental Absorption(1)" (AN 4.123). Retrieved 2010-09-23 from "Access to Insight" at  http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.123.than.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

====={{IAST|Śubhakṛtsna}} Planes=====
These three realms are a result of attaining the third jhana. The mental state of the devas of these worlds corresponds to the third jhana, and is characterized by a quiet joy ([[sukha]]).  These devas have bodies that radiate a steady light. 
* 20 - Devas of Refulgent Glory (''subhakinna deva''): The Buddha said, "The Subhakinha devas, monks, have a life-span of 64 mahakalpas. A run-of-the-mill person having stayed there, having used up all the life-span of those devas, goes to hell, to the animal womb, to the state of the hungry shades."&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro, Bhikkhu (trans.) (2010). Jhana Sutta: Mental Absorption(1)" (AN 4.123). Retrieved 2010-09-23 from "Access to Insight" at  http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.123.than.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  
* 19 - Devas of Unbounded Glory (''appamanasubha deva''): The world of devas of "limitless beauty".
* 18 - Devas of Limited Glory (''parittasubha deva''): The world of devas of "limited beauty".

=====Ābhāsvara Planes=====
These three are a result of attaining the second jhana. The mental state of the devas of the ''[[Abhasvaras|Ābhāsvara]]'' worlds corresponds to the second dhyāna, and is characterized by delight ([[Pīti|prīti]]) as well as joy ([[sukha]]). 
* 17 - Devas of Streaming Radiance (''abhassara deva''): The Abhassara devas have a life-span of 8 mahakalpas. After that period they are reborn in a lower realm.&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro, Bhikkhu (trans.) (2010). Jhana Sutta: Mental Absorption(1)" (AN 4.123). Retrieved 2010-09-23 from "Access to Insight" at  http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.123.than.html.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 16 - Devas of Unbounded Radiance (''appamanabha deva''): The world of devas of "limitless light", a concept on which they meditate. Their lifespan is 4 ''[[mahākalpas]]''.
* 15 - Devas of Limited Radiance (''parittabha deva''): The world of devas of "limited light". Their lifespan is 2 ''mahākalpas''.

=====Brahmā Planes=====
{{Main|Brahma (Buddhism)}}
The mental state of the devas of the Brahmā worlds corresponds to the first jhana. Like all beings, the brahmas are still tied to the cycle of rebirth, though sometimes they forget this and imagine themselves to be immortal. The Buddha said "The devas of Brahma's retinue, monks, have a life-span of an eon. A run-of-the-mill person having stayed there, having used up all the life-span of those devas, goes to hell, to the animal womb, to the state of the hungry shades."&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro, Bhikkhu (trans.) (2010). Jhana Sutta: Mental Absorption(1)" (AN 4.123). Retrieved 2010-09-23 from "Access to Insight" at  http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.123.than.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

One way to rebirth in the brahma world is mastery over the first jhana. Another is through meditations on loving kindness, compassion, altruistic joy, and equanimity. According to the Subha Sutta, the Brahmin Subha asked the Buddha to teach him how to be born in the world of Brahma. And the Buddha said to him: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Then young man, listen carefully I will tell.’ The young man agreed and the Blessed One said. The bhikkhu pervades one direction with thoughts of loving kindness, so too the second, the third, the fourth, above, below, across, in every respect, in all circumstances, the entire world, he pervades with the thought of loving kindness grown great and immeasurable without anger and ill will. Young man, when the release of the mind in loving kindness, is developed thus, none of the measured actions remain. Just as a clever drummer in no time would make known the message in the four directions. In the same manner, when the release of the mind in loving kindness, is developed thus, none of the measured actions remain. This is the method to be born with Brahma. 
Again the bhikkhu pervades one direction with the thought of compassion,…re…. with intrinsic joy,…re… with equanimity, so too the second, the third, the fourth, above, below, across, in every respect, in all circumstances, the entire world, he pervades with equanimity grown great and immeasurable without anger and ill will. Young man, when the release of the mind in equanimity, is developed thus, none of the measured actions remain. Just as a clever drummer in no time would make known the message in the four directions. In the same manner, when the release of the mind in equanimity is developed thus, none of the measured actions remain. This is the method to be born with Brahma.&lt;ref&gt;Nanamoli, Bhikkhu (trans.) (1995, ed. Bhikkhu Bodhi). The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha: A New Translation of the Majjhima Nikaya. Boston: Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-072-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* 14 - Great Brahmas (''Maha brahma''): One of this realm's most famous inhabitants is the Great [[Brahma]], a deity whose delusion leads him to regard himself as the all-powerful, all-seeing creator of the Universe. According to the Brahmajāla Sutta, a Mahā brahmā is a being from the Ābhāsvara worlds who falls into a lower world through exhaustion of his merits and is reborn alone in the Brahma-world; forgetting his former existence, he imagines himself to have come into existence without cause.

Related Sutta: Kevaddha Sutta

* 13 - Ministers of Brahma (''brahma-purohita deva''): The "Ministers of Brahmā" are beings, also originally from the Ābhāsvara worlds, that are born as companions to Mahābrahmā after he has spent some time alone. Since they arise after his thought of a desire for companions, he believes himself to be their creator, and they likewise believe him to be their creator and lord. 
* 12 - Retinue of Brahma (''brahma-parisajja deva''): The "Councilors of Brahmā" or the devas "belonging to the assembly of Brahmā".

====Kama-Loka (The Sense-Sphere realm)====
{{Main|Desire realm}}
Birth into these heavenly planes takes place as a result of giving and moral discipline. The Sense-Sphere Realm is the lowest of the three realms. The driving force within this realm is sensual desire. These devas enjoy aesthetic pleasures, long life, beauty, and certain powers. The heavenly planes are not reserved only for good Buddhists. Anyone who has led a wholesome life can be born in them. People who believe in an "eternal heaven" may carry their belief to the deva plane and take the long life span there to be an eternal existence. Only those who have known the Dhamma will realize that, as these planes are impermanent, some day these sentient beings will fall away from them and be reborn elsewhere. The devas can help people by inclining their minds to wholesome acts, and people can help the devas by inviting them to rejoice in their meritorious deeds.

=====Higher Kama (Karma) Loka=====
These devas live in four heavens that float in the air, leaving them free from contact with the strife of the lower world.
* 11 - Devas Wielding Power over the Creation of Others (''Parinimmita-vasavattin deva''): These devas enjoy sensual pleasures created by others for them. These devas do not create pleasing forms that they desire themselves, but their desires are fulfilled by the acts of other devas who wish for their favor. [[Mara (demon)|Mara]], the personification of delusion and desire, lives here. 
* 10 - Devas Delighting in Creation (''Nimmanarati deva''): These devas delight in the sense objects of their own creation. They are capable of changing appearance to please themselves. The lord of this world is [[Sunirmita]] (Pāli Sunimmita).
* 9 - Contented deva (''Tusita deva''): [[Tushita]] is the home of the contented gods, among whom many [[Bodhisattva]]s, including the future Buddha [[Maitreya]], abide. Before his birth as Siddhartha, the present Buddha also used to dwell with the other [[Bodhisattva]]s in this realm. His name in this realm was Śvetaketu (Pāli: Setaketu). While Maitreya is undoubtably the most important of the dwellers in {{IAST|Tuṣita}}, the ruler of this world is {{IAST|Santuṣita}} (Pāli: Santusita).
* 8 - [[Yama]] devas: These Yama devas live in the air, free of all difficulties.

=====Lower Kama-Loka=====
{{Main|Sumeru}}
The lower devas of the Kama-loka live on different parts of the mountain at the center of the world, Sumeru. They are even more passionate than the higher devas, and do not simply enjoy themselves but also engage in strife and fighting. 
* 7 - [[Thirty-three gods]] (''Tavatimsa deva''): Beings that live on the peak of Sumeru are like the Olympian gods. Their ruler is Sakka or [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra]], a devotee of the Buddha. Sakka rules by righteousness, patience towards aggressors, and compassionate treatment of wrongdoers. Sakka and the devas honor sages and holy men. He earned his place as ruler of the devas by fulfilling seven vows which embody the standards of the virtuous householder while he was still a human being. The Buddha holds up Sakka's patience and forgiveness as a model for the ''[[bhikkhu]]s''. Many devas dwelling here live in mansions in the air. Besides the thirty-three devas, many other devas and supernatural beings dwell here, including the attendants of the devas and many [[apsaras]]es (nymphs).

Related Suttas: Sakka-panha Sutta and the Sakka Samyutta (11th section of the Samyutta Nikaya) which also contains 25 short discourses connected with Sakka.

* 6 - [[Four Great Kings]] (''catummaharajika deva''): The world of the Four Great Kings includes the martial kings who guard the four quarters of the Earth. The chief of these kings is Vaisravana, but all are ultimately accountable to Sakra.  Dhatarattha, king of the Eastern Direction, is lord of the gandhabbas. Virulha, king of the Southern Direction, is lord of the kumbandas. Virupakkha, king of the Western Direction, is lord of the nagas. Kuvera, who rules as king of the Northern Direction, is lord of the yakkhas. The devas who guide the Sun and Moon are also part of this world.

This is  home to the four types of earthly demigod or nature-spirit:  
Gandhabba - the celestial musicians or fairies
[[Yakkha]] - tree spirits of varying degrees of ethical purity. They are analogous to the goblins, trolls, ogres, and fairies of Western fairy tales. They inhabit remote areas such as forests, hills, and abandoned caves. Though living in misery they have the potential for awakening and can attain the path and fruits of the spiritual life.

Related Suttas: Yakkhasayutta of the Samyutta Nikaya.

According to the Atanatiya Sutta: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"There are non-humans who are fierce, violent, given to retaliation; those non-humans heed neither the (four) great kings, nor their ministers nor their attendants. They are called rebels against the (four) great kings. Even as in the kingdom of Magadha, the thieves heed neither the king of Magadha, nor the ministers, nor their attendants, and are called rebels against the king of Magadha, so there are non-humans who are fierce... (as before). They are called rebels against the (four) great kings."

======Human Beings (manussa loka)======
* 5 - [[Human]] (''manussa loka''): Birth in this plane results from giving and moral discipline of middling quality. This is the realm of moral choice where destiny can be guided. The Khana Sutta mentioned that this plane is a unique balance of pleasure and pain. It facilitates the development of virtue and wisdom to liberate oneself from the entire cycle or rebirths. For this reason rebirth as a human being is considered precious according to the Chiggala Sutta. In the Cula-kammavibhanga Sutta (The Shorter Analysis of Action), the Buddha taught that:

Killing others lead to short life if one becomes reborn in the human plane instead of the four lower States of Deprivation. By abandoning the very acts of killing and harming, one gets to be reborn in a heavenly world. Alternatively, one gets to be reborn in the human world being endowed with long life.

Injuring of others beings can lead to rebirth in the States of Deprivation. Alternatively, the person comes back in the human plane as someone very sickly. Non-injuring of others leads to rebirth in good destinations. Alternatively, one comes back to the human plane enjoying good health.

The same goes for the following:
* Beautiful or Unattractive Human Rebirth depends on whether the person has an irritable character in this life.
* Influential or Ordinary Human Rebirth depends on whether the person is envious of the gain and honor received by others in this life.
* Rich or Poor Human Rebirth depends on whether one is generous to others, such as providing the requisites of holy people, in this present life.

Related Suttas: Janussonin Sutta, Cula-kammavibhanga Sutta,

======States of Deprivation (Apaya)======
Rebirth into these planes results from unwholesome conduct. Beings reborn there have no moral sense and generally cannot create good kamma (karma). However, when the unwholesome kamma that brought them to these planes is exhausted, some stored good kamma can bring them rebirth in some other plane. Only stream-enterers and other ariyans can be sure they will never again be born in these planes of misery.

* 4 - [[Asura (Buddhism)|Asura]]: They are demons or "titans" that are engaged in endless conflict with each other. From the Jataka Tales, we are told that the Asuras are always fighting to regain their lost kingdom on the top of Mount Sumeru, but are unable to break the guard of the Four Great Kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kavassery|first=Rajesh|title=Jataka Tales|year=2007|publisher=Sura Books|isbn=9789555738019|page=118}}; also, see, Pali Text Society, Jataka Tales; PTS, J.i.202-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Asuras are divided into many groups, and have no single ruler, but among their leaders are [[Vemacitrin]] (Pāli: Vepacitti) and Rāhu. According to Marasinghe:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In later texts we find the Asura realm as one of the four unhappy states of rebirth. The Nikāya evidence however does not show that the Asura realm was regarded as a state of suffering"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marasinghe|first=M.M.J.|title=Gods in Buddhism|year=2009|publisher=Sarasavi Publishers|isbn=9789555738019|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Came glasswork''' is the process of joining cut pieces of [[art glass]] through the use of [[came]] strips or foil into picturesque designs in a framework of soldered metal.

Final products include a wide range of glasswork, including [[stained glass]] and [[leadlight|lead light]] pieces. Came is made of different metals, such as [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[brass]] and [[copper]]. The metal came selected generally depends upon the size, complexity and weight of the project. As an alternative to came, copper foil may be used, for small, intricate pieces.

==Overview==
Came glasswork includes assembling pieces of cut and possibly painted [[Art glass|glass]] using [[came]] sections. The joints where the came meet are [[solder]]ed to bind the sections. When all of the glass pieces have been put within came and a border put around the entire work, pieces are [[cement]]ed and supported as needed.&lt;ref name=Shannon/&gt; The work may be made [[waterproof]] by forcing a soft oily cement or [[Putty|mastic]] between the glass and the cames. A form of [[embellishment]] and [[gilding]], such as [[Angel gilding]] and [[Eglomise]], may be added to finish the piece.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Works may need to be reinforced, like large pieces or ones that will be exposed to the outdoor elements. Support can be provided as the piece is made through the use of reinforced and metal-covered lead came, the use of steel strips in the came channels, or use of rigid cames, such as [[copper]], [[brass]] or [[zinc]]. Bars of steel or [[steel]] [[rebar]] may be attached to the back of finished works as reinforcement.&lt;ref name=Shannon60&gt;Shannon, George and Pat Torlen. (2002).

Readers Digest. p. 114. {{ISBN|0-89577-063-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in the book ''De Divers Artibus''. Theophilus was a Benedictine Monk who was a glass and pigment worker who practiced in the late 11th and early 12th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Smedley, J. et al. (1998).

==Materials==
Materials to complete a glasswork project may include the [[pattern]], [[Art glass|cut glass]], [[came]], [[wood]] [[Molding (decorative)|trim]], [[solder]], [[cement]]. Additional supplies include [[newspaper]], cutter oil, a [[plywood]] board, [[masking tape]], flux,{{refn|Flux is used during the soldering process to better disperse heat from the soldering iron, improve the soldering process and to clean.

===Came===
Lead came is often supplied in lengths of 2&amp;nbsp;m and in widths of differing sizes. It also comes in flat or domed profiles.

====Brass and copper====
Brass and copper have been used to bring a copper or golden hue to the works.&lt;ref name=Berry10&gt;Berry, Leigh Ann. (2003). ''Basic Stained Glass Making: All the Skills and Tools You Need to Get Started''. Stackpole Books. p. 10. {{ISBN|0-8117-2846-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, though, they were used only for windows between about 1890 and 1920. Both metals were often alternatives to zinc for [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] designed windows.&lt;ref name=DOI&gt;Department of Interior. (2004). ''The Preservation of Historic Architecture: The U.S. Government's Official Guidelines for Preserving Historic Homes''. Lyons Press Series. Globe Pequot. p. 397. {{ISBN|1-59228-126-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heinz/&gt;

====Brass-capped lead====
Brass-capped lead is another type of came used for glasswork projects.&lt;ref name=Stevenson12/&gt;

====Lead====
The traditional method of creating "camework glass" uses [[lead]] [[came]], which ages into a dark blue-gray [[patina]]. In comparison to other came metal strips, like brass, copper and zinc, lead is softer and more flexible, making it easier to cut and bend. It's also inexpensive and durable. A downside is that the finished projects may be prone to sagging due to lead's softness. This can be mitigated somewhat by stretching the lead to make it more rigid before it is used.&lt;ref name=Shannon&gt;Shannon, George and Pat Torlen. (2002). ''The new stained glass: techniques, projects, patterns, designs''. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. p. 51. {{ISBN|1-895569-80-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DOI/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stevenson12&gt;Stevenson, Christine. (2004). ''Creative Stained Glass: Modern Designs &amp; Simple Techniques''. Lark Books. p. 12. {{ISBN|1-57990-487-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Special precautions should be taken when working with this metal came to avoid to lead contamination.&lt;ref name=Stevenson12/&gt;

The lead came windows of the medieval churches are sturdier than those of the 19th century and much of the 20th century. The composition of lead came changed over time, at first by removing other metals to make a "pure lead" and then again during war years when lead was needed for ammunition. Since the 1970s a new form of lead, restoration lead, was developed based upon medieval lead's metal composition. Restoration lead is stronger than lead came of the prior 100 years or so.&lt;ref name=DOI/&gt;

Water tightness is achieved by brushing [[adhesive|cement]] under the flanges of the leads to both faces prior to installation or by applying [[putty]] afterwards. Typically the cement consisted of [[linseed oil]], [[Chalk|whiting]], [[lamp black]] and [[white spirit]].

Zinc makes a lightweight, strong and rigid came, which lends itself to glasswork projects that don't have many curved lines, are large, or have a number of straight lines that require greater support than lead would afford. Zinc accepts finishes, such as black and copper. Because of its strength, zinc is often used for border cames, which are U-channel cames for the outside edges.&lt;ref name=DOI/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stevenson12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, George and Pat Torlen. (2002). ''The new stained glass: techniques, projects, patterns, designs''. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. p. 55-60. {{ISBN|1-895569-80-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Lloyd Wright used zinc came for his stained glass windows.&lt;ref name=Heinz&gt;Heinz, Thomas A. (September / October 1989). "Use &amp; Repair of Zinc Cames in Art-Glass Windows." ''Old House Journal''. pp. 35–38.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beveled glass]] work is generally done in zinc came, primarily because of its ability to manage the weight of heavy plate glass; whereas beveled glass works made of lead came are much more likely to buckle or sag over time.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg, Anita and Seymour Isenberg. (2002). ''How to Work in Beveled Glass: Forming, Designing, and Fabricating''. Dover Stained Glass Instruction Series. Courier Dover Publications. p. 21. {{ISBN|0-486-42062-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper foil is an easy, versatile alternative to came and is particularly useful for small projects.&lt;ref name=Stevenson12/&gt; Using [[copper]] [[foil (chemistry)|foil]], the edges of the glass pieces are wrapped with adhesive copper tape and [[soldering|soldered]] together along the adjacent copper strips. The copper foil technique (commonly called [[Louis Comfort Tiffany|''Tiffany'']] stained glass, even though there is a debate about whether [[John La Farge]] or [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] originated it) was invented in the 19th century, enabling creation of [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] works, in addition to [[two-dimensional]] ones to which the lead came method is limited. A patent for the method of "Joining Glass Mosaics" was issued to Sanford Bray in 1886. This new method of joining pieces of stained glass used copper/copper foil instead of lead sashes. By using copper foil, one could now make cylinders, cones, and globe-shaped shades or many other irregular forms.

[[File:Libros de Eloísa Cartonera 2.jpg|thumb|Cartonera books from Eloísa Cartonera.]]
'''Cartonera''' is a social, political and artistic [[publishing]] movement that began in [[Argentina]] in 2003 and has since spread to countries throughout [[Latin America]] and, more recently, to [[Europe]] and [[Africa]]. The founders, [[Washington Cucurto]], Javier Barilaro, and Fernanda Laguna started [[Eloísa Cartonera]] in [[Buenos Aires]] in response to the [[1998–2002 Argentine great depression|2001 economic crisis]] during which the [[Argentine peso]] plummeted to one third of its value. The tough economic conditions led to an increase in the number of [[Waste picker|cartoneros]], people who make their living collecting and selling salvaged materials to recycling plants.

Cartonera books are made from cardboard bought from cartoneros at three to five times the price set by recycling plants. The cardboard is then used to create covers for short books of prose or poetry. Each book cover is hand painted and sold on the streets at the cost of production in order to increase access to literature. This method of publication has provided the opportunity for unknown authors to be published, as well as for renowned authors to reach a more diverse audience. Beyond selling affordable books, the cartoneras promote literacy and the democratization of literature through workshops and book fairs which bring the greater public in contact with literature. The cartonera publishers also involve the community in the process of book creation and distribution through a cooperative learning experience which pushes aside educational and socioeconomic divides among participants. The books are generally published in small editions of 100 or fewer; however, popular texts are kept in print or printed through neighboring cartoneras.&lt;ref&gt;Laguna, Fernanda. "No hay cuchillo sin rosas: Historia de una editorial latinoamericana". Buenos Aires: Eloísa Cartonera. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bilbija"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.meiotom.art.br/AkademiaCartoneraArticles.pdf |year=2009 |title=Akademia Cartonera: A Primer of Latin American Cartonera Publishers |publisher=Parallel Press / University of Wisconsin–Madison Libraries |editor-last=Bilbija |editor-first=Ksenija |editor2-last=Celis Carbajal |editor2-first=Paloma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the cartoneras publish books in print form, information about the publishing houses themselves is often available electronically through their webpages, blogs, and wikis, or through online newspaper stories, interviews, and journal articles. While digital mediums are often used to write about cartonera, the books themselves are art-objects steeped in the smells and smudges of tempera paint and rough scissor-cut edges. Some cartonera books are now being preserved, most notably through the [https://uwdc.library.wisc.edu/collections/arts/eloisacart/ University of Wisconsin-Madison's Cartonera Publishers library collection and database], but the majority of the editions continue to circulate (as they are intended to do) and will disintegrate within ten years due to acid in the cardboard. As with other digitized databases and guides, the list below includes some of the presently known cartoneras, a number which is always shifting.

Rosa had established a relationship with Cooperglicério, an organization that oversees forty-five [[Recycling cooperative|recycling cooperatives]], based in the Glicério neighborhood of [[São Paulo]]. Dulcinéia Catadora currently holds weekly workshops in São Paulo’s trash and recycling centers where catadores help make books as part of the collaboration between Dulcinéia Catadora and the Cooperglicério recycling collective.

'''''Celebrity Eye Candy''''' is a television series on [[VH1]] that first aired on December 15, 2005. It features photos and videos of celebrities taken by the [[paparazzi]] within the past week. Frequently the celebrities were shown in a poor light. The host of the show is never seen and is a voice-over only. He often opens the show with a somewhat humorous song about the video that was presented over the course of the show. In addition, the host normally sings a few songs about celebrities doing something normal things, such as scratching an itch or grocery shopping.

The show initially aired weekly episodes for approximately 4 months but with mediocre [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]]. It was put on hiatus in July 2006. It returned in February 2007, albeit on a more sporadic airing basis.

'''Chepstow Castle''' ({{lang-cy|Castell Cas-gwent}}) at [[Chepstow]], [[Monmouthshire]], [[Wales]] is the oldest surviving post-Roman stone fortification in Britain.  Located above cliffs on the [[River Wye]], construction began in 1067 under the instruction of the [[Normans|Norman]] Lord [[William FitzOsbern]].  Originally known as [[Striguil]], it was the southernmost of a chain of castles built in the [[Welsh Marches]], and with its attached [[Marcher Lord|lordship]] took the name of the adjoining market town in about the 14th century.

In the 12th century the castle was used in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent]], the first independent Welsh kingdom to be [[Norman invasion of Wales|conquered by the Normans]]. It was subsequently held by two of the most powerful Anglo-Norman magnates of medieval England, [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|William Marshal]] and [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Richard de Clare]]. However, by the 16th century its military importance had waned and parts of its structure were converted into domestic ranges. Although re-garrisoned during and after the [[English Civil War]], by the 1700s it had fallen into decay.  With the later growth of tourism, the castle became a popular visitor destination. 

The ruins were [[Grade I]] listed on 6 December 1950.

== Building of the castle ==
[[File:Chepstow Castle from North bank.jpg|thumb|400px|Chepstow Castle, seen from the north bank of the River Wye]]
Chepstow Castle is situated on a narrow ridge between the limestone river cliff and a valley, known locally as the Dell, on its landward side. Its full extent is best appreciated from the opposite bank of the River Wye.  The castle has four [[Motte-and-bailey|bailey]]s, added in turn through its history. Despite this, it is not a defensively strong castle, having neither a strong [[keep]] nor a [[concentric castle|concentric]] layout. The multiple baileys instead show its construction history, which is generally considered in four major phases.&lt;ref name="Cadw, 1986" &gt;{{harvnb|Cadw|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first serious architectural study of Chepstow began in 1904&lt;ref name="St John Hope, 1904" &gt;{{Cite journal

=== Foundation, 1067–1188 ===
[[File:Chepstow Castle (Wales).JPG|thumb|The Great Tower]]
The speed with which [[William the Conqueror]] committed to the creation of a [[castle]] at Chepstow is testament to its strategic importance.  There is no evidence for a settlement there of any size before the [[Norman invasion of Wales]], although it is possible that the castle site itself may have previously been a prehistoric or early medieval stronghold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ggat.org.uk/cadw/historic_landscape/wye_valley/english/wyevalley_003.htm  Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust Historic Landscape Characterisation: Chepstow]&lt;/ref&gt; The site overlooked an important crossing point on the [[River Wye]], a major artery of communications inland to [[Monmouth]] and [[Hereford]]. At the time, the Welsh kingdoms in the area were independent of the English Crown and the castle in Chepstow would also have helped suppress the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] from attacking [[Gloucestershire]] along the Severn shore towards [[Gloucester]].  However, recent analysis suggests that the rulers of [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent]], who had recently fought against [[Harold Godwinson|King Harold]], may initially have been on good terms with the Normans.&lt;ref name=gch &gt;Miranda Aldhouse-Green and Ray Howell (eds.), ''Gwent In Prehistory and Early History: The Gwent County History Vol.1'', 2004, {{ISBN|0-7083-1826-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precipitous limestone cliffs beside the river afforded an excellent defensive location.  Building work started under William FitzOsbern in 1067 or shortly afterwards.  The Great Tower was probably completed by about 1090, possibly intended as a show of strength by King William in dealing with the Welsh king [[Rhys ap Tewdwr]].&lt;ref name=castle&gt;Rick Turner and Andy Johnson (eds.), ''Chepstow Castle – its history and buildings'', 2006, {{ISBN|1-904396-52-6}} {{harvnb|Turner|Johnson|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was constructed in stone from the first (as opposed to wood, like most others built at this time), marking its importance as a stronghold on the border between [[England]] and [[Wales]].  Although much of the stone seems to have been quarried locally, there is also evidence that some of the blocks were re-used from the [[Roman empire|Roman]] ruins at [[Caerwent]].&lt;ref name=castle/&gt;   

The castle originally had the Norman name of [[Striguil]], derived from the Welsh word ''ystraigl'' meaning "river bend". FitzOsbern also founded a [[priory]] nearby, and the associated market town and port of Chepstow developed over the next few centuries. The castle and the associated [[Marcher lord]]ship were generally known as Striguil until the late 14th century, and as Chepstow thereafter.&lt;ref name="castle"/&gt;

===Expansion by William Marshal and Roger Bigod, 1189–1300===
[[File:Chepstow Castle 1825 plan.png|thumb|350px|Plan of Chepstow Castle from 1825]]
Further fortifications were added by [[William Marshal]], [[Earl of Pembroke]], starting in the 1190s. The wood in the doors of the gatehouse has been dated by [[dendrochronology]] to the period 1159–89.&lt;ref name=castle/&gt; Marshal extended and modernised the castle, drawing on his knowledge of warfare gained in France and [[the Crusades]]. He built the present main gatehouse, strengthened the defences of the Middle [[Motte-and-bailey|Bailey]] with round towers, and, before his death in 1219, may also have rebuilt the Upper Bailey defences. Further work to expand the Great Tower was undertaken for William Marshal's sons [[William Marshal, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|William]], [[Richard Marshal, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Richard]], [[Gilbert Marshal, 4th Earl of Pembroke|Gilbert]] and [[Walter Marshal, 5th Earl of Pembroke|Walter]], in the period to 1245.&lt;ref name="castle" /&gt; 

In 1270, the castle was inherited by Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk, who was a grandson of William Marshal's eldest daughter, [[Maud Marshal|Maud]]. He constructed a new range of buildings in the Lower Bailey, as accommodation for himself and his family.  Bigod was also responsible for building Chepstow's town wall, the "Port Wall", around 1274–78. The castle was visited by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] in 1284, at the end of his triumphal tour through Wales.  Soon afterwards, Bigod had built a new tower (later known as "Marten's Tower"), which now dominates the landward approach to the castle, and also remodelled the Great Tower.&lt;ref name="castle" /&gt;

==Later history==
===Decline in defensive importance, 1300–1403===
[[File:Loz chepstow side.png|thumb|The external walls]]
From the 14th century, and in particular the end of the wars between England and Wales in the early 15th century, its defensive importance declined. In 1312 it passed into the control of [[Thomas of Brotherton, 1st Earl of Norfolk|Thomas de Brotherton, Earl of Norfolk]], and later his daughter [[Margaret, Duchess of Norfolk|Margaret]].  It was garrisoned in response to the rebellion of [[Owain Glyndŵr]] in 1403 with twenty men-at-arms and sixty archers but its great size, limited strategic importance, geographical location and the size of its garrison all probably contributed to Glyndŵr's forces avoiding attacking it, although they did successfully attack [[Newport Castle]].

===The 15th to 17th centuries ===
In 1468, the castle was part of the estates granted by the Earl of Norfolk to [[William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1468 creation)|William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke]] in exchange for lands in the east of England.  In 1508, it passed to [[Charles Somerset, 1st Earl of Worcester|Sir Charles Somerset]], later the Earl of Worcester, who remodelled the buildings extensively as private accommodation. From the 16th century, after the abolition of the Marcher lords' autonomous powers by [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] through the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542|Laws in Wales Acts of 1535 and 1542]], and Chepstow's incorporation as part of the new county of [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], the castle became more designed for occupation as a great house.&lt;ref name="castle" /&gt;

===The Civil War and its aftermath===
The castle saw action again during the [[English Civil War]], when it was in the front line between [[Cavalier|Royalist]] [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] and [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] [[Gloucestershire]].  It was held by the Royalists and [[siege|besiege]]d in both 1645 and in 1648, eventually falling to the Parliamentarian forces on 25 May 1648. A memorial to Sir [[Nicholas Kemeys]], who led the Royalist defence during the [[Second English Civil War|Second Civil war]] and was killed in combat after refusing to surrender after the castle's fall, lies within the keep.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/206177&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, the castle was garrisoned and maintained as an artillery fort and barracks. It was also used as a political prison.  Its occupants included Bishop [[Jeremy Taylor]], and – after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of the monarchy – [[Henry Marten (regicide)|Henry Marten]], one of the Commissioners who signed the death warrant of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], who was imprisoned here before his own death in 1680.

===Decay of the building, and the start of tourism===
[[File:Chaepstow Castle from bridge.jpg|thumb|Chepstow Castle showing the Great Tower, seen from the 1816 Wye Bridge]]
In 1682, the castle came into the ownership of the [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Duke of Beaufort]].  The garrison was disbanded in 1685, and the buildings were partly dismantled, leased to tenants and left to decay.  Various parts of the castle were used as a farmyard and a glass factory.  By the late 18th century, its ruins became, with other sites in the [[Wye Valley|Wye valley]], a "[[Picturesque]]" feature on the "[[Wye tour]]", pleasure boat trips down the river from [[Ross-on-Wye]] via [[Monmouth]].  The first guide book to the castle and town was written by [[Charles Heath (Monmouth)|Charles Heath]] of [[Monmouth]] and was published in 1793.&lt;ref name="castle" /&gt;

===The 19th and 20th centuries===
By the 1840s, tourism was continuing to grow, particularly with day trips on [[steam ships]] from [[Bristol]]. At the same time, the courtyard of the castle began to be used for local horticultural shows, fêtes, and, increasingly from the 1880s, historical [[Procession|pageants]] sanctioned by the Duke of Beaufort. Although he tried to sell the castle in 1899, no buyer could be found.

In 1910/11, the castle and adjoining river bed were the site of well-publicised excavations by Dr. [[Orville Ward Owen]], who was attempting to find secret documents to prove that [[Shakespeare]]'s plays had in fact been written by [[Francis Bacon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rainsbury|first=Anne|title=Chepstow and the River Wye|publisher=The History Press|date=2009|edition=2nd|series=Britain in Old Photographs|pages=138–139|isbn=978-0-7524-5019-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1913, the movie "[[Ivanhoe (1913 U.S. film)|Ivanhoe]]", starring [[King Baggot]], was made in the grounds.  The following year, the castle was bought by businessman [[John Lysaght (company)|William Royse Lysaght]], of [[Tutshill]], and conservation work began.&lt;ref name=castle/&gt;

In 1953, the Lysaght family put the castle into the care of the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]]. In 1977 [[Terry Gilliam]] shot some of his film adaptation of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s "[[Jabberwocky (film)|Jabberwocky]]" at the castle. In the early 1980s, it was used as a location for [[ITV Wales &amp; West|HTV]]'s "[[Robin Of Sherwood]]" starring [[Michael Praed]].{{cn|date=October 2016}}  Brazilian heavy metal band [[Sepultura]] recorded part of their fifth album ''[[Chaos A.D.]]'' in the castle, in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://teamrock.com/feature/2004-02-25/sepultura-spreading-chaos  "Sepultura: Spreading Chaos", ''TeamRock.com'', 25 February 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The castle today ==
Chepstow Castle is open to the public, and since 1984 has been in the care of [[Cadw]], the [[Welsh Assembly Government|Welsh government]] body with the responsibility for protecting, conserving and promoting the built heritage of Wales. There are special events held often in the castle and visitors are now able to walk along the battlements and into Marten's Tower.&lt;ref &gt;[http://www.castlewales.com/chepstow.html castlewales.com] &lt;/ref&gt; The castle has been used for the filming of the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' 50th anniversary broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/10367245.Dr_Who_past_and_present_film_at_Chepstow_Castle/  South Wales Argus, ''Dr Who past and present, Matt Smith and David Tennant, film at Chepstow Castle'', 19 April 2013].

'''Classical Christian education''' is an approach to learning which emphasizes biblical teachings and incorporates a teaching model from the [[classical education movement]] known as the ''[[Trivium (education)|Trivium]]'', consisting of three parts: grammar, logic, and rhetoric. According to [[Douglas Wilson (theologian)|Douglas Wilson]], this method of instruction was developed by early Christians as part of the [[Liberal arts|Seven Liberal Arts]].&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite book |title=Recovering the Lost Tools of Learning: An Approach to Distinctively Christian Education |author=Wilson, Douglas |authorlink=Douglas Wilson (theologian) |publisher=Good News Publishers |year=1991 |isbn=0-89107-583-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yeWEnAc6n8MC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson's writings and the [[Logos School]] he founded have been cited as being influential in reviving the Trivium and fueling a modern educational movement, primarily among American Protestants.&lt;ref name="Leithart"&gt;{{cite web |title=The New Classical Schooling |author=Leithart, Peter J. |authorlink=Peter Leithart |date=2008-01-29 |url=http://www.firstprinciplesjournal.com/articles.aspx?article=128 |publisher=Intercollegiate Studies Institute |work=First Principles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baptist"&gt;{{cite news |author=Ledbetter, Reed Tammi |title=University model, classical education emerging anew as schooling alternatives |date=2003-03-12 |work=Baptist Press |url=http://www.sbcbaptistpress.org/bpnews.asp?ID=15427}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Higher Yearning: At Patrick Henry College, Home-Schooled Students Learn to Confront the World |author=Copeland, Libby |date=2001-11-27 |page=C01 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A19351-2001Nov26&amp;notFound=true |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical Christian education is characterized by a reliance on [[classics|classical works]] by authors such [[Homer]], [[Sophocles]], [[Plato]], [[Josephus]], [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], and an integration of a [[Christian worldview]] into all subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Veritas: School Combines Christian, Classical Education |date=2008-08-24 |author=Peterson, Patti |publisher=The Virginian-Pilot |url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/education/1531348/veritas_school_combines_christian_classical_education/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, classical Christian education exposes students to [[Western Civilization]]'s history, art and culture, teaching [[Latin]] as early as the second grade and often offering several years of [[Greek language|Greek]].&lt;ref name="Baptist"/&gt; Many schools have been marked by higher than average scores on standardized tests.&lt;ref name="Leithart"/&gt;

==Philosophy==
The modern Classical-Christian educational movement began when Douglas Wilson published "The Lost Tools of Learning".  In it he expanded on a paper written by [[Dorothy Sayers]] by the same title.&lt;ref name="Sayers"&gt;{{cite web |title= The Lost Tools of Learning |url=http://www.gbt.org/text/sayers.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She lamented that the “great defect of our education" was that schools taught information, but did not teach students how to think.   Wilson described an educational model based on the child's developmental capabilities and natural inclinations.  
*From birth, the child learns language and about itself. 
*From about age 2 to age 4, the child develops social skills and gains mobility and dexterity
*The Grammar stage begins around age 5. In this stage, the child is in a "parrot" stage of repeating what they are told.  This phase sees them enjoying simple songs over and over, so songs, rhymes and memory aid teach the basics of reading, writing, numbers and math, and observational science. Many schools begin Latin language training in 3rd grade.  Some schools will also teach a Christian [[Catechism]] while students are in this phase, as foundation for intensive study of the texts and structures of the Bible. 
*The Logic stage begins in 6th grade. At this age, students naturally develop an argumentative behavior, and are equipped with tools of logic and how to formulate a defense for an idea.  This provides the foundation for Sayers' 'teaching them to think' model. 
*The Rhetoric phase happens during high school, blending the prior learning with specialized knowledge, generally in a college preparatory curriculum. &lt;Ref name="CCS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Classical Christian Education Overview |url=http://www.calvaryclassical.org/academics/classical-christian-education/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Christianity is one of the three major religions in the world. It covers a wide range of contents, including culture, history, morality, philosophy and so on. It forms the basic background of Western culture. For a long time, the academic circles have made a systematic study of Christianity, but the systematic research based on the Bible in the Christian educational thought is rare. In fact, the educational thoughts included in the Bible are of great value, because Christian educational thought is based on Biblical belief and has the basis of Biblical records&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=St. John|first=Henry|date=1941|title=Christian Education|url=www.jstor.org/stable/43812032|journal=Blackfriars|volume=22|pages=395–405|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Education is the process of educating people. Christianity has its own distinctive characteristics in its own way of education. Christian educational thought holds that, because children have the nature of sin, the education of children is not based on their natural growth for some guidance or inspiration, but according to the Bible to achieve the desired results. From the Bible's passage, it can be seen that the characteristics of Christian education.

=== Establishment of standards ===
Parents must make their children clear about what they expect. If the parents do not set the standards to which the child must comply, the child will not know the right or wrong of his behavior, and there is no reason for the parents to punish him for his fault. The Bible's principle of setting standards is embodied in Romans 4:15: "Where there is no law, there is no transgression."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mutch|first=William James|date=1923|title=What Is Christian Education?|url=www.jstor.org/stable/1195252|journal=The Journal of Religion|volume=3|pages=276–289|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the law is the standard set by God to man, and transgression is a violation of known standards. The establishment of standards is the basis for impartial discipline of children. Children have the right to know what their parents want him to do or not to do. The establishment of standards should correspond to children's understanding. It is only when a child understands a standard and is able to abide by it that he is responsible for its conduct. When parents set standards for their children, they should also explain to them that they will be punished if they do not comply with the standards; that is, standards should include warnings.

=== Blame ===
Christian education believes that because of the evil nature of every child, he was more inclined to be disobedient. Even if the child knows clearly that disobedience is punishable, he often cannot resist the power of his own desires and nature. Therefore, when parents set up standards, they should be psychologically prepared for children to violate this standard&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cornel|first=Drucilla|date=2013|title=Christian Education South Africa|url=www.jstor.org/stable/41175221.|journal=Fordham University|volume=I &amp; II|pages=390–405|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. When a child makes a mistake, his parents must point out his mistakes and blame him.

=== Acknowledge a mistake ===
Among the basic tenets of Christianity, confession and repentance is an extremely important content: People are guilty, in order to obtain forgiveness, so they must confess to God. In addition, the Bible also believes that there are natural criteria for measuring right and wrong. A well-educated child will take the initiative to admit his mistake when he realizes that he has done something wrong. A child who is not well educated will admit his mistake when he is found to be wrong and reprimanded. A child who does not admit even when his is being blamed is in a state of rebellion, and blame is the only way to deal with his behavior&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leitch|first=Addison Hardie|date=1947|title=Philosophy of Christian Education|url=www.jstor.org/stable/41175221|journal=Christian Education|volume=30|pages=167–182|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Forgiveness ===
After children admit their mistakes, parents should immediately forgive their children completely and let him feel fully accepted. There is no hint of forgiveness for any promise or grief or crying. A child may not feel sorry for his faults. Parents should not expect their immature children to react like adults to their own mistakes. The result of forgiveness is the restoration of the fellowship between the child and his parents. Children are free from the torment of fault and alienation from their parents, and parents no longer experience the tension caused by conflict with their children. For parents, it is important to make sure that their children and their fellowship have already begun again&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guffin|first=Gilbert L|date=1952|title=Why A 'Christian' Education|url=www.jstor.org/stable/41175843|journal=Christian Education|volume=35|pages=269–275|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Criticism ==
The controlling and teaching emphasized by Christian education aims at curbing the tendency of evil in children's nature and emphasizing that children should obey their parents in everything. This kind of education method is often criticized as "autocracy" by some educational experts in society, but the so-called autocracy is based on the phenomenon that parents have their own mistakes but also force their children to obey. Moreover, using "autocracy" to generalize Christian education is contrary to the spirit of "love" of Christianity. In a sense, Christian education does have a "despotic" component; that is, children should obey their parents in everything, but this is entirely for the child's own benefit.

The central theme of the book is [[state formation]]. Tilly writes about the complex history of European state formation from the [[Middle Ages]] to the 1990s - a thousand-year time span. While examining political, social, and technological change, Tilly attempts to explain the unprecedented success of the European [[Nation state|nation-state]] as the dominant [[polity]] in the world,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Coercion, Capital, and European States, AD 990-1990|last = Tilly|first = Charles|publisher = B.

== Overview ==
[[File:Jacques Bertaux - Prise du palais des Tuileries - 1793.jpg|thumb|According to Tilly, the [[French Revolution]] unfolded from protests against the high taxes the French rulers imposed to balance for the expensive [[American Revolutionary War|American War]].]]
Tilly asks a double question in ''Coercion, Capital, and European States'', namely: "What accounts for the great variation over time and space in the kinds of states that have prevailed in Europe since AD 990, and why did European states eventually converge on different variants of the national state?"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to Tilly's theory, military innovation in pre-modern Europe, especially the use of gunpowder and mass armies, made war considerably more expensive. In order to continue to fund warfare, conquest, and security, only states with sufficient capital and a large population could afford paying for their security and ultimately surviving in a hostile environment. Those in power were forced to develop a means of extraction by, for example, introducing taxation and conscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.so.17.080191.002515|title = Comparative Perspectives on the State|last = Barkey|first = Karen|date = August 1991|journal = Annual Review of Sociology|doi = 10.1146/annurev.so.17.080191.002515|pmid = |access-date = January 25, 2016|first2 = Sunita|last2 = Parikh|issue = 17|pages = 523–549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, these means of extraction resulted in the creation of state bureaucracies and a centralized state.

The type of state that develops is dependent on the structure of the area. In areas where merchants and capital were the predominant class, city states arose, such as Venice. In areas where independent landlords were the predominant class, centralized absolutism arose, such as Russia. If an area would have both classes more or less equal, a combination of state forms would develop, for example as happened in France and England, according to Tilly. Eventually, all states will develop into the type of state form that Tilly calls the [[nation state]].

With this theory, Tilly questions previous formulations of state development in Europe, arguing that they are unsuccessful in explaining the great variety in kinds of states that have prevailed at different stages of European history since AD 990. He say that they fail "because they locate explanations of state-to-state variation in individual characteristics of states rather than relations among them, and because they assume implicitly a deliberate effect to construct the sorts of substantial, centralized states that come to dominate European life during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Unlike other theories, like the idea of the [[social contract]], Tilly stated that "[w]ar wove the European network of national states, and preparation for war created the internal structures of states within it."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://isnblog.ethz.ch/international-relations/charles-tilly-ad-990-1992-twenty-years-on|title=Charles Tilly, AD 990-1992: Twenty Years On|last=Lindberg|first=Marten|date=November 2011|website=The International Relations and Security Work|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interaction between the rulers on the hand and the manipulators of capital on the other, resulted in three state formations, Tilly argues. These state formations are tribute-taking empires, systems of fragmented sovereignty, and national states.

=== From Militarization to Civilianization ===
Tilly notes a "central paradox" in his theory of European state building: "the pursuit of war and military capacity, after having created national states as a sort of by-product, led to a civilianization of government and domestic politics".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Tilly, this transfer of power from armed forces to civilian entities was not so much a tug-of-war but rather happened incrementally. The ''nature'' of power—coercion—did not change, but the individuals that wielded it did. Tilly provides five main reasons for this incremental transition (p.&amp;nbsp;206):
# The building up and maintenance of military forces required massive extractive structures that were run by civilians, eventually forming a counterweight to the same military forces;
# War making forced states to legitimize civilian input since it had to bargain for necessary resources with civilian entities;
# War making dramatically expanded the state and did not downsize its capacities at the end of conflicts;
# Individuals involved in war making were promised dues at the end of the war, and thus legitimately claimed their dues at demobilization;
# Borrowing during conflicts led to bureaucracies being created to service the skyrocketing state debts, which in turn encouraged states to intervene in the local economy.

=== State Building in the Developing World ===
[[Jeffrey Herbst]] is an example of a scholar that builds on Tilly's theory. Herbst explains the relative failure of state building in Africa by the lack of external threats that forced European leaders to concentrate capital and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = War and the State in Africa|jstor = 2538753|journal = International Security|date = 1990-01-01|pages = 117–139|volume = 14|issue = 4|doi = 10.2307/2538753|first = Jeffrey|last = Herbst}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tilly concludes his book, however, emphasizing caution in applying his model to contemporary [[state-building]]. the Tilly argues that the militarization of politics in many developing countries should not be understood as a step towards the development of a stable nation state. He asserts that current conditions of state formation today (at the time of writing, in 1990) are vastly different from what they were in Europe over his study period. First, Tilly notes that the military apparatus in developing countries today is not generally concerned with conquering or defending territory, as opposed to European armies (p.&amp;nbsp;207). Thus, they turn their full capacity to internal control, so that the objective is not to control territory but populations. Second, Tilly writes that the Cold War has led to a competition between the United States and the Soviet Union to arm, fund and control developing countries, especially their militaries. Thus, military groups thrived as other organizations withered. Progressively, the military was better able to control the state, whereas civilian organizations could not rival its strength. In other words, Tilly argues that the military groups that run contemporary developing states have little in common with their European counterparts.

He further proposes three hypothesis to start to theorize the lack of civilianization in developing countries (p.&amp;nbsp;220):
# Failure of civilian institutions that lead to military intervention;
# Disproportionate external support for the military;
# No institutional tool to bargain and contain the military since it is artificially funded externally.
Tilly's main claim is thus that the European nation-state as it was constructed is certainly not a ''de facto'' endgame, or ideal polity model. In fact, Tilly argues that it is improbable that current Third World states follow exactly the same processus of state building- and we should not expect them to do so.

== Reception ==

=== Academic discussion ===

==== Tarrow, 2008 ====
American sociologist [[Sidney Tarrow]] discussed the book during a 2008 conference organized by the [[Social Science Research Council]] in honor of Charles Tilly. During his talk, he addressed what he saw as four gaps in the book:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
# '''The scope conditions of Tilly's theory'''. War is seen by Tilly as the "prime mover of early modern European state-making, because its requisites led to processes of extraction, protection, production, and distribution."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, Tarrow wonders how that can explain non-European states and states that formed more recently, such as post-colonial states. There is a lot of literature on "correcting Tilly" on state-building in the [[North–South divide|global South]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2486.2008.00746.x/abstract|title = Tilly Tally: War-Making and State-Making in the Contemporary Third World|last = Taylor|first = Brian D.|date = March 2008|journal = International Studies Review|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2486.2008.00746.x|pmid = |access-date = January 25, 2016|last2 = Botea|first2 = Roxana|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''The theory's internal validity'''. In the 1975 book ''The Formation of National States in Western Europe'', Tilly critiques [[Joseph Strayer]]'s model of state formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = On the Medieval Origins of the Modern State|last = Strayer|first = Joesph R.|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1970|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ''Coercion, Capital, and European States'', "the successful cases looked remarkably like Strayer's model."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
# '''There is no attention for the role of religion and capitalism in European state development''', while Tarrow argues "[w]e know how deeply Catholic/Protestant conflicts divided Europe in the [[Thirty Years' War|Thirty Year's War]], and how the settlement of that conflict produced the European state system after the [[Peace of Westphalia|Treaty of Westphalia]]." Concerning capitalism, Tarrow said that "not all European states were equally in need of domestic capital to finance their wars", referring to Sweden under King [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]]. 
# '''The role of rights in state development in the United States''', characterized by the so-called "[[War on Terrorism – Timeline|War on Terror]]". According to Tarrow, Tilly "saw his country at risk of abandoning its devotion to its regime of rights."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Leander, 2012 ====
French/Swedish sociologist [[Anna Leander]] examined Tilly's relevance twenty years later in her article ''Wars and the Un-Making of States: Taking Tilly Seriously in the Contemporary World''. Leander argues that the "war makes states"  no longer holds for four reasons:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.peacepalacelibrary.nl/ebooks/files/338105247.pdf|title = Wars and the Un-Making of States: Taking Tilly Seriously in the Contemporary World|last = Leander|first = Anna|date = 2012|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[State-building]]'''. While rulers' competition for controlling coercion is a crucial element of Tilly's hypothesis, today's rulers "take increasingly minor roles in the organization of coercion".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; State-building is not a product of interstate conflict anymore but rather of diplomacy and high-politics.
# '''Privatization of coercion'''. Another crucial element - the rulers' monopoly on legitimate violence - is disappearing. Europe and North America have seen a growth of 10 per cent per years in private security companies taking over the state prerogatives since the 1970s, a ''[[Peace Research Institute Frankfurt]]'' report shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Private Security Companies and the State Monopoly on Violence|url = http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?id=113632|website = www.isn.ethz.ch|access-date = 2016-01-25|first = ISN|last = Editors}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Privatization of capital'''. Just like coercion, controlling capital is a crucial element in Tilly's hypothesis, as wars are expensive. However, national economics is a function of international economics and subject to international norms, rules, and regulations in the modern world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
# '''Different interest groups'''. Tilly concludes that the civilianization of government evolved through the bargaining between rulers and their citizens. However, "the privatization of coercion and capital and the decentralization of political power has left rulers as brokers between different [...] interest groups rather than ''ruling them'' from a national center".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== 1992 Edition ==
A revised edition of the book was published in 1992 with the title ''Coercion, Capital, and European States AD 990-1992''. For that edition, Tilly made minor revisions throughout the book and added an extra section discussing the rapid changes in Central and Eastern Europe after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

==Biography==

Dobbie took his degrees at [[Columbia University]]: A.B. 1927, A.M. 1929 (in American literature, taking a rare first class), Ph.D. 1937. While at Columbia, he became a lecturer in 1934 (one of four in the department at the time, 'actually overworked assistants who did what was called the "scutters' work" of the Department, handling proseminars with the M.A. candidates'), Instructor in 1937, Assistant Professor in 1942, Associate Professor in 1945, and Professor in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3114">'''Linguistic entailments''' occur when one may draw necessary conclusions from a particular use of a word. [[Logical consequence|Entailment]] phrases are relations between propositions, and are always worded as, "''if A then B,''" meaning that if ''A'' is true, then ''B'' must also be true. Another way of phrasing this is, "''if A is true, then B must necessarily be true.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Semantic Entailment and Formal Derivability|last=Beth|first=Evert Willem|publisher=|year=1955|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Semantics ==
In semantics, entailments depend entirely on the denotation (also called the "dictionary definition" of the words in question). An example of this, as shown in M. Lynne Murphy's ''Lexical Meaning'' would be, "If it is a shoe, then it is made to be worn on a foot." This example references the 'footwear' meaning of the word shoe, and not the adjective, which is considered a different use of the word and thus a different meaning. For an entailment to be true, the ''then'' statement must ''always'' be true when the ''if'' statement is true. To judge whether an entailment is true, one can ask, "Could it ''ever'' be the case that ''B'' isn't true while ''A'' is true?" In order to accurately recognize entailments, a strong knowledge of the denotation of the word is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lexical Meaning|last=Murphy|first=M. Lynne|publisher=Cambridge Textbooks in Semantics|year=2010|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=31–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pragmatics ==
In pragmatics, entailment falls in a category with implicature and presupposition. All three deal with assumptions made by the listener or reader about a situation.

Entailment differs from [[implicature]] in that for the latter the truth of A suggests the truth of B, but does not require it. For example, the sentence "Jack missed the meeting after his car broke down" ''implies'' that Jack missed the meeting ''because'' his car broke down; but in reality Jack could have missed the meeting four days after his car broke down because he slept in too late. Entailments do not allow these reinterpretations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Presupposition and Implicature in Compositional Semantics|last=Sauerland|first=U|publisher=Pelgrave|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entailment also differs from [[presupposition]] in that in presupposition, the truth of what one is presupposing is taken for granted. The classic and often mentioned example of this is, "the king of France is ill". This sentence ''presupposes'' that there is a king of France, which there is currently not. This means that though the sentence is syntactically sound, it is still incorrect because there is no referent for "the king of France". Entailment also does not allow for a lack of referent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Genre painting''', also called '''petit genre''', depicts aspects of [[everyday life]] by portraying ordinary people engaged in common activities. One common definition of a '''genre scene''' is that it shows figures to whom no identity can be attached either individually or collectively—thus distinguishing ''petit genre'' from [[history painting]]s (also called ''grand genre'') and [[portrait]]s. A work would often be considered as a genre work even if it could be shown that the artist had used a known person—a member of his family, say—as a model. In this case it would depend on whether the work was likely to have been intended by the artist to be perceived as a portrait—sometimes a subjective question. The depictions can be realistic, imagined, or romanticized by the artist. Because of their familiar and frequently sentimental subject matter, genre paintings have often proven popular with the [[bourgeoisie]], or [[middle class]].
[[Image:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 014.jpg|thumb|280px|right|''Peasant Dance'', c. 1568, oil on wood, by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Brueghel]] the Elder]]

Genre subjects appear in many traditions of art. Painted decorations in [[Art of Ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptian]] [[tomb]]s often depict banquets, recreation, and agrarian scenes, and [[Peiraikos]] is mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] as a [[Hellenistic]] panel painter of "low" subjects, such as survive in [[mosaic]] versions and provincial wall-paintings at [[Pompeii]]: "barbers' shops, cobblers' stalls, asses, eatables and similar subjects".&lt;ref&gt;Book XXXV.112 of ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]] often illustrated scenes of everyday peasant life, especially in the [[Labours of the Months]] in the calendar section of [[books of hours]], most famously the [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]].

==To 1800==
[[File:Merry company, by Dirck Hals.jpg|thumb|''Merry Company'', a [[Merry company]] scene, by [[Dirck Hals]]]]

The [[Low Countries]] dominated the field until the 18th century, and in the 17th century both [[Flemish Baroque painting]] and [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] produced numerous specialists who mostly painted genre scenes.  In the previous century, the Flemish [[Renaissance]] painter [[Jan Sanders van Hemessen]] painted innovative large-scale genre scenes, sometimes including a moral theme or a religious scene in the background in the first half of the 16th century.  These were part of a pattern of "[[Mannerist]] inversion" in [[Antwerp]] painting, giving "low" elements previously in the decorative background of images prominent emphasis.  [[Joachim Patinir]] expanded [[landscape painting|his landscapes]], making the figures a small element, and [[Pieter Aertsen]] painted works dominated by spreads of [[still life]] food and genre figures of cooks or market-sellers, with small religious scenes in spaces in the background.  [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] made peasants and their activities, very naturalistically treated, the subject of many of his paintings, and genre painting was to flourish in Northern Europe in Brueghel's wake. 
[[File:Wybrand Hendriks - Interieur met naaiende vrouw.jpg|thumb|''Interior with Sewing Woman'', c. 1800-1810 by [[Wybrand Hendriks]] ]] [[Adriaen van Ostade|Adriaen]] and [[Isaac van Ostade]], [[Jan Steen]], [[Adriaan Brouwer]], [[David Teniers the Younger|David Teniers]], [[Aelbert Cuyp]], [[Johannes Vermeer]] and [[Pieter de Hooch]] were among the many painters specializing in genre subjects in the Low Countries during the 17th century. The generally small scale of these artists' paintings was appropriate for their display in the homes of middle class purchasers. Often the subject of a genre painting was based on a popular ''emblem'' from an [[Emblem book]]. This can give the painting a double meaning, such as in [[Gabriel Metsu]]'s [[:Image:Gabriel Metsu 003.jpg|''The Poultry seller'', 1662]], showing an old man offering a [[rooster]] in a symbolic pose that is based on a lewd engraving by Gillis van Breen (1595–1622), with the same scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/jong076erot01_01/jong076erot01_01_0001.htm | title=E. de Jongh, 'Erotica in vogelperspectief. De dubbelzinnigheid van een reeks zeventiende-eeuwse genrevoorstellingen'· dbnl |first=| last=DBNL| date=| website=DBNL |accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[merry company]]'' showed a group of figures at a party, whether making music at home or just drinking in a tavern. Other common types of scenes showed markets or fairs, village festivities ("kermesse"), or soldiers in camp.

[[File:Jean-Baptiste Greuze - Filial Piety - WGA10664.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]], ''Filial Piety'', 1765]]

In Italy, a "school" of genre painting was stimulated by the arrival in [[Rome]] of the Dutch painter [[Pieter van Laer]] in 1625. He acquired the nickname "Il Bamboccio" and his followers were called the ''[[Bamboccianti]]'', whose works would inspire [[Giacomo Ceruti]], [[Antonio Cifrondi]], and [[Giuseppe Maria Crespi]] among many others.

[[Le Nain|Louis le Nain]] was an important exponent of genre painting in 17th-century France, painting groups of peasants at home, where the 18th century would bring a heightened interest in the depiction of everyday life, whether through the [[romanticism|romanticized]] paintings of [[Antoine Watteau|Watteau]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]], or the careful [[realism (arts)|realism]] of [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin|Chardin]]. [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] (1725–1805) and others painted detailed and rather sentimental groups or individual portraits of peasants that were to be influential on 19th-century painting.

In England, [[William Hogarth]] (1697–1764) conveyed comedy, social criticism and moral lessons through canvases that told stories of ordinary people ful of narrative detail (aided by long sub-titles), often in serial form, as in his ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'', first painted in 1732–33, then engraved and published in print form in 1735.

Spain had a tradition predating ''[[The Book of Good Love]]'' of social observation and commentary based on the Old Roman Latin tradition, practiced by many of its painters and [[illuminated manuscript|illuminators]].  At the height of the Spanish Empire and the beginning of its slow decline, many [[picaresque]] genre scenes of street life—as well as the kitchen scenes known as ''[[bodegones]]''—were painted by the artists of The [[Spanish Golden Age]], notably [[Velázquez]] (1599–1660) and [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] (1617–82). More than a century later, the Spanish artist [[Francisco de Goya]] (1746–1828) used genre scenes in painting and [[printmaking]] as a medium for dark commentary on the human condition. His ''[[The Disasters of War]]'', a series of 82 genre incidents from the [[Peninsular War]], took genre art to unprecedented heights of expressiveness.

==19th century==
[[File:Wassilij Grigorjewitsch Perow 004.jpg|thumb|right|280px|[[Vasily Perov]], ''The Hunters at Rest'' (1871), [[Tretyakov Gallery]]]]
[[File:Jagerswoning Rijksmuseum SK-A-1157.jpeg|thumbnail|280px|[[Henry Voordecker]], ''[[Hunter's Home]]'' (1826)]]
[[File:1820-Country-Wedding-John-Lewis-Krimmel.jpg|thumb|280px|[[John Lewis Krimmel]], ''Country Wedding'' (1820)]]

With the decline of religious and historical painting in the 19th century, artists increasingly found their subject matter in the life around them. [[Realism (art)|Realists]] such as [[Gustave Courbet]] (1819–77) upset expectations by depicting everyday scenes in huge paintings—at the scale traditionally reserved for "important" subjects—thus blurring the boundary which had set genre painting apart as a "minor" category. Realist paintings on such a scale, and the new type showing people at work, emphasizing the effort involved, would not normally be called "genre paintings".  Both monumental scale and the depiction of exhausting work are exemplified by ''[[Barge Haulers on the Volga]]'' ([[Ilya Repin]], 1873). [[History painting]] itself shifted from the exclusive depiction of events of great public importance to the depiction of genre scenes in historical times, both the private moments of great figures, and the everyday life of ordinary people. In French art this was known as the [[Troubador style]].  This trend, already apparent by 1817 when [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] painted ''Henri IV Playing with His Children'', culminated in the [[pompier]] art of French academicians such as [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1824–1904) and [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier]] (1815–91).  In the second half of the century interest in genre scenes, often in historical settings or with pointed social or moral comment, greatly increased across Europe.

[[William Powell Frith]] (1819–1909) was perhaps the most famous English genre painter of the Victorian era, painting large and extremely crowded scenes; the expansion in size and ambition in 19th-century genre painting was a common trend. Other 19th-century English genre painters include [[Augustus Leopold Egg]], [[Frederick Daniel Hardy]], [[George Elgar Hicks]], [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[John Everett Millais]].  Scotland produced two influential genre painters, [[David Allan (painter)|David Allan]] (1744–96) and [[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]] (1785–1841). Wilkie's ''The Cottar's Saturday Night'' (1837) inspired a major work by the French painter [[Gustave Courbet]], ''[[After Dinner at Ornans]]'' (1849). Famous [[Russia]]n realist painters like [[Vasily Perov]] and [[Ilya Repin]] also produced genre paintings.

In Germany, [[Carl Spitzweg]] (1808–85) specialized in gently humorous genre scenes, and in Italy [[Gerolamo Induno]] (1825–90) painted scenes of military life. Subsequently, the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], as well as such 20th-century artists as [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Itshak Holtz]], [[Edward Hopper]], and [[David Park (painter)|David Park]] painted scenes of daily life. But in the context of modern art the term "genre painting" has come to be associated mainly with painting of an especially anecdotal or sentimental nature, painted in a traditionally realistic technique.

The first true genre painter in the United States was the German immigrant [[John Lewis Krimmel]], who learning from Wilkie and Hogarth, produced gently humorous scenes of life in Philadelphia from 1812–21. Other notable 19th-century genre painters from the United States include [[George Caleb Bingham]], [[William Sidney Mount]], and [[Eastman Johnson]]. [[Harry Roseland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safran-arts.com/42day/art/art4may/art0512.html|title=ART / 4 / 2DAY|first=John F.|last=Canu|date=|website=www.safran-arts.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on scenes of poor African Americans in the post-American Civil War South,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/reprint/158/5/970.pdf{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Rogers (sculptor)|John Rogers]] (1829–1904) was a sculptor whose small genre works, mass-produced in cast plaster, were immensely popular in America.  The works of American painter [[Ernie Barnes]] (1938–2009) and those of illustrator [[Norman Rockwell]] (1894–1978) could exemplify a more modern type of genre painting.

'''Glienicke Palace''' ({{lang-de|Schloss Glienicke}}) is a palace located on the peninsula of [[Berlin]]-[[Wannsee]], [[Germany]]. It was designed by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]] for Prince [[Carl of Prussia]] in 1826.

==Location==
The palace is situated near the [[Glienicke Bridge]], on the [[Bundesstraße 1]] across from the [[Jagdschloss Glienicke|Glienicke Hunting Lodge]]. Around the palace is [[Park Glienicke]].

==History==
It was designed by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]] for Prince [[Carl of Prussia]] in 1826. The building, originally merely a cottage, was turned into a summer palace in the late [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style. Particularly striking are two golden lion statues in front of the frontage, which were also designed by Schinkel. The lions are versions of the ''[[Medici lions]]'' from the [[Villa Medici]]. In the palace are antique [[work of art|objets d'art]], which the Prince brought back from his trips. 

==World Heritage Site==
[[Image:Gemälde August Haun.jpg|thumb|225px|right|''Garden-courtyard in Glienicke'' (1837) by August C. Haun]]
Since 1990, Glienicke Palace and the park have been part of the UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] "[[Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin]]". The palace is administered by the ''[[Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg|Stiftung Preußische Schlösser und Gärten Berlin-Brandenburg]]''. The palace's park is now called the ''Volkspark Glienicke''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9197">[[File:Inkstick.jpg|right|200px|thumb|An old Chinese inkstick made in the form of lotus leaves and flowers.]]
'''Inksticks''' (Chinese: 墨 ''{{audio|Zh-mò.ogg|Mò|help=no}}''; Japanese: 墨 ''Sumi''; Korean: 먹 ''Meok'') or Ink Cakes are a type of solid ink (''[[India ink]]'') used traditionally in several [[East Asian]] cultures for calligraphy and [[brush painting]]. Inksticks are made mainly of [[soot]] and [[animal glue]], sometimes with [[incense]] or medicinal scents added. To make ink, the inkstick is ground against an [[inkstone]] with a small quantity of water to produce a dark liquid which is then applied with an [[ink brush]]. Artists and calligraphers may vary the thickness of the resulting ink according to their preferences by reducing or increasing the intensity and time of ink grinding.

Along with the [[inkstone]], [[brush]], and [[paper]], the inkstick is considered one of the [[Four Treasures of the Study]] of classical Chinese literary culture.

==History==
[[File:Huizhouhukaiwenmo.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Commemorative Chinese inksticks for collectors.]]
The earliest artifacts of Chinese inks can be dated back to 12th century BC{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}, with charred materials, plant dyes, and animal-based inks being occasionally used, mineral inks being most common. Mineral inks based on materials such as [[graphite]] were ground with water and applied with [[brush]]es. The mineral origins of Chinese inks were discussed by the [[Eastern Han]] dynasty scholar [[Xu Shen]] (許慎, 58 – c. 147). In his [[Shuowen Jiezi]], he wrote "Ink, whose semantic component is 'earth', is black." (墨，從土、黑也), indicating that the character for "ink" (墨) is composed of the characters for "black" (黑) and "soil" (土), due to the earthly origins of the dark mineral used in its production.

[[File:Boite de batons d'encre de Chine en couleur.jpg|thumb|Colored inksticks, usually used as accents in [[Chinese painting]].]]
The transition from graphite inks to soot and charred inks occurred prior to the [[Shang dynasty]]. From studies of ink traces in artifacts of various dynasties, it is believed the inks used in the [[Zhou dynasty]] are quite similar to those used in the [[Han dynasty]]. However, these early inks, up to the [[Qin dynasty]], were likely stored in liquid or powdered forms that have not been well preserved and thus their existence and constitution can only be studied from painted objects and artifacts.&lt;ref name=inkHist&gt;{{citation |chapter=墨的發展史 |title=《墨》，文房四寶叢書之四|first=玫芬| last=蔡|year=1994 |publisher=彰化社會教育館 |location=彰化市}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical proof for these first "modern" Chinese [[soot]] and [[animal glue]] inks were found in archaeological excavations of tombs dated to the end of the [[Warring States period]] around 256 BC. This ink was formed by manual labor into pellets which were ground into ink on top of a flat inkstone using a smaller stone [[pestle]]. Many pellet-type inks and grinding implements have been found in Han dynasty tombs, with large ingot-type inks appearing in the late Eastern Han. These latter inks have physical markings which indicate that kneading was used in their production.&lt;ref name=inkHist/&gt;

One of the first literary records of inkstick production in Japan is from ''qimin yaoshu'' (齊民要術)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=齊民要術 |first=賈|last=思勰|date=386-534 A.D. (N.Wei)|url=http://zh.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=齊民要術/卷第九}}&lt;/ref&gt; written during the [[Northern Wei]] dynasty. Elaboration of the techniques, technical requirements, and ingredients were also noted in scroll ten of ''yunlu manchao'' (雲麓漫鈔)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= 雲麓漫鈔 |first=彥衛|last=趙|date=~1195 A.D.(Song)|url=http://zh.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=雲麓漫鈔}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "ink" chapter of ''tiangong kaiwu'' (天工開物), the notable [[Ming dynasty]] encyclopedia by ''Song Yingxing'' (宋應星).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= 天工開物 |first=應星|last=宋|date=1637 (Ming)|url=http://zh.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=天工開物/墨}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

In general, inksticks are made of soot and animal glue, with other ingredients occasionally added as preservatives or for aesthetics:
*''Soot'': [[Soot]] is produced by [[:wikt:anoxic|anoxic]] burning of oils such as [[tung oil]] (桐油), [[soybean oil]], [[tea seed oil]], or [[lard]], or from wood such as [[pine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Some Typical Ink Sticks|url=http://www.algonet.se/~claesg/sticks.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990420191901/http://www.algonet.se/%7Eclaesg/sticks.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1999-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Animal glue]]'': [[Egg white]], fish skin, or ox [[Animal glue#Hide glue|hide glues]] are used to bind the inkstick together.
*''Incense and medicines'': To improve the physical aesthetics of the inkstick, [[incense]] and [[Chinese herbology|herb extracts]] from [[Traditional Chinese medicine]] such as [[clove]], [[comfrey]], ash (''[[Fraxinus]] chinensis'') bark, [[sappanwood]], [[Santalum album|white sandalwood]], [[Liquidambar orientalis|Oriental sweetgum]], or even [[Musk deer|deer]] [[musk]], and [[pearl]] dust were added. These ingredients may serve as preservatives for the inkstick.

The ingredients are mixed together in precise proportions into a dough and then kneaded until the dough is smooth and even. The dough is then cut and pressed into a mold and slowly dried. Badly made inksticks will crack or [[Crazing|craze]] due to inadequate kneading, imprecise soot to glue ratio, or uneven drying.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Hui Ink Stick|url=http://www.acornplanet.com/hui_inkstick.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common shape for inksticks is rectangular/cuboid though other shapes are sometimes used. Inksticks often have various inscriptions and images incorporated into their design, such as indications of the maker or the type of inkstick, poetry, or an artistic image.

A good inkstick is said to be as hard as stone, with a texture like a rhino, and black like lacquer (堅如石，紋如犀，黑如漆). The grinding surface of a quality inkstick should in reflected light have a sheen that is blueish-purple, black if not so good, and white if bad. The best inksticks make very little noise when grinding due to the fine soot used, which makes the grinding action very smooth, whereas a very loud or scratchy grinding noise indicates an ink of poor quality with a grainy soot. Likewise, a quality inkstick should not damage or scratch the inkstone.

==Types==
There are many types of inksticks produced. An artist or calligrapher may use a specific ink for a special purpose or to create special effects.

*'''Oil soot ink''' is made using the soot of burnt [[tung oil]] or various other oils. There is more glue in this type of ink than the other kinds, so it does not spread as much. It gives a warm black color and is good as a general purpose painting and calligraphy ink.
*'''Pine soot ink''' is made from the soot of pine wood. It has less glue and so spreads more than oil soot ink. It gives a blueish-black color and is good for calligraphy and [[gongbi]] painting.
*'''Lacquer soot ink''' is made from the soot of dried raw lacquer. It has a shiny appearance and is most suitable for painting.
*'''Charcoal ink''' is made using ordinary wood charcoal. It has the least amount of glue and so spreads on paper more than other inks. It is mainly used for freestyle painting and calligraphy.
*'''Blueish ink (青墨)''' is oil or pine soot that has been mixed with other ingredients to produce a subtle blueish-black ink. Mainly used for calligraphy.
*'''Coloured ink''' is oil soot ink that has been blended with pigments to create a solid ink of color. Most popular is cinnabar ink, which was reportedly used by Chinese emperors.

An artist might commission a custom ink to suit their needs. Medical ink is produced by mixing standard ink with herbal medicines, and can be ground and taken internally. Some inks are made in highly decorative and odd shapes for collectors rather than actual use.

Within each type of ink there are many variations regarding additional ingredients and fineness of the soot. An artist selects the best type of ink suited to their needs depending on discipline, paper type, and so on.

'''Keresan''' {{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|ɹ|iː|s|ən}}, also '''Keres''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɛ|ɹ|ᵻ|s}}, is a [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American language]], spoken by the [[Keres people|Keres]] [[Pueblo people]] in [[New Mexico]]. Depending on analysis, Keresan is considered a small [[language family]] or a [[language isolate]] with several [[dialect cluster|dialects]]. The varieties of each of the seven Keres pueblos are [[mutually intelligible]] with its closest neighbors. There are significant differences between the Western and Eastern groups, which are sometimes counted as separate languages.

==Family division==

* '''Eastern Keres''': total of 4,580 speakers (1990 census)
** '''[[Cochiti Pueblo]]''' ''Kotyit dialect'': 384 speakers (1990 census)
** '''[[San Felipe Pueblo]] – [[Santo Domingo Pueblo]]''': 
***''Katishtya dialect'': 1,560 speakers (1990 census) 
***''Kewa dialect'': 1,880 speakers (1990 census)
** '''[[Zia Pueblo]] – [[Santa Ana Pueblo]]''': 
***''Ts'ia dialect'': 463 speakers (1990 census) 
***''Tamaiya dialect'': 229 speakers (1990 census)
* '''Western Keres''': total of 3,391 speakers (1990 census)
** '''[[Acoma Pueblo]]'''  ''Áak’u dialect'': 1,696 speakers (1980 census)
** '''[[Laguna, New Mexico|Laguna Pueblo]]''' ''Kawaika dialect'': 1,695 speakers (1990 census)

==Genetic relationships==

Keres is now considered a [[language isolate]]. In the past, [[Edward Sapir]] grouped it together with a [[Hokan languages|Hokan]]–Siouan stock. [[Morris Swadesh]] suggested a connection with [[Wichita language|Wichita]]. [[Joseph Greenberg]] grouped Keres with [[Siouan]], [[Yuchi language|Yuchi]], [[Caddoan]], and [[Iroquoian]] in a superstock called Keresiouan. None of the proposals has been validated by subsequent linguistic research.

==Phonology==
Keresan has between 42 and 45 consonant sounds, and around 40 vowel sounds, adding up to a total of about 95 [[phoneme]]s, depending on the analysis and the language variety. Based on the classification in the [[World Atlas of Language Structures]], Keres is a language with a ''large'' consonant inventory.

The great number of consonants relates to the three-way distinction between [[Voicelessness|voiceless]], [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] and [[Ejective consonant|ejective]] consonants (e.g. /t tʰ t’/), and to the larger than average&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/10724704|title=Patterns of sounds|last=Ian.|first=Maddieson,|date=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521113267|location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]|oclc=10724704}}&lt;/ref&gt; number of [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]] (i.e. /s s’ ʂ ʂ’ ʃ ʃ’ h/) and [[Affricate consonant|affricates]], the latter also showing the three-way distinction found in [[Stop consonant|stops]].

The large number of vowels derives from a distinction made between [[Vowel length|long]] and short vowels (e.g. /e eː/), as well as from the presence of [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]] and voicelessness. Thus, a single vowel quality may occur with seven distinct realizations: / é è e̥ éː èː êː ěː /, all of which are used to distinguish words in the language.

===Vowels===
Keresan vowels have a [[Phoneme|phonemic]] distinction in [[Vowel length|duration]]: all vowels can be long or short. Additionally, short vowels can also be voiceless. The vowel chart below contains the vowel phonemes and allophones from the information of the Keresan languages combined from The Language of Santa Ana Pueblo (1964),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Language of Santa Ana Pueblo, Smithsonian Bulletin 191, Anthropological Papers, No. 69|last=Davis|first=Irvine|publisher=|year=1964|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Phonemes of Keresan (1946),&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and Kansas Working Papers in Linguistics (1987).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Notes:
* Western Keres does not have phonemic /oː/ or /o/, though both vowels may occur phonetically.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Eastern Keres words containing /o/ show /au/ in Western Keres.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A study for a lexicon of Laguna Keresan|last=Valiquette|first=Hilaire|publisher=|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Kotyit Keres: [ ʂóːkʰɑ̥tʃʰɑ̥ ] - ''I see you''
** K'awaika Keres: [ ʂɑ̌ukʰɑ̥tʃʰɑ̥ ] - ''I see you''

==== Voiceless vowels ====
All Keresan short vowels may be [[Voicelessness|devoiced]] in certain positions. The phonemic status of these vowels is controversial.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Grammar of Laguna Keres|last=Lachler|first=Jordan|publisher=University of New Mexico Dissertation|year=2005|isbn=|location=Albuquerque|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maring (1967) considers them to be phonemes of Áák'u Keres, whereas other authors disagree. There are phonetic grounds for vowel devoicing based on the environment they occur, for instance word-finally, but there are also exceptions. Vowels in final position are nearly always voiceless and medial vowels occurring between voiced consonants, after nasals and ejectives are nearly always voiced.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Word-final devoicing: [ pɑ̌ːkʊ̥ ] ''because''
* Word-medial devoicing: [ ʔìpʰi̥ʃɑ́ ] ''white paint''

===Tones===
Acoma Keres has four [[Tone (linguistics)|lexical tones]]: high, low, falling and rising.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Grammar of Acoma Keresan|last=Maring|first=Joel M.|publisher=Indiana University Dissertation|year=1967|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falling and rising tones only occur in long vowels and voiceless vowels bear no tones:

|}

===Syllable structure===

Most Keresan syllables take a CV(V) shape.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The maximal syllable structure is CCVVC and the minimal syllable is CV. In native Keresan words, only a glottal stop /ʔ/ &lt;'&gt; can close a syllable, but some loanwords from Spanish have syllables that end in a consonant, mostly a nasal (i.e. /m n/ but words containing these sequences are rare in the language.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spencer|first=Robert|date=1947|title=Spanish Loanwords in Keresan|url=|journal=Southwestern Journal of Anthropology|volume=3|pages=130–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to extensive vowel devoicing, several Keresan words may be perceived as ending in consonants or even containing consonant clusters.
* Word-internal cluster: ''yʾâakạ srûunị'' 'stomach' /jˀɑ̂ːkḁʂûːni/ &gt;   [jɑ̂ːkḁʂûːni] ~ [jɑ̂ː'''kʂ'''ûːni]
* Word-final coda: ''úwàak&lt;u&gt;ạ&lt;/u&gt;'' 'baby'; /úwɑ̀ːkḁ/ &gt; [úwɑ̀ːkʰḁ] ~ [úwɑ̀ː'''kʰ''']'

==== Phonotactics ====
The only sequence of consonants (i.e. [[consonant cluster]]) that occurs in native Keresan words is a sequence of a fricative /ʃ ʂ/ and a stop or affricate. Clusters are restricted to beginnings of syllables (i.e. the [[Syllable|syllable onset]]). When the alveolo-palatal consonant /ʃ/ occurs as C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, it combines with alveolar and palatal C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas the retroflex alveolar /ʂ/ precedes bilabial and velar C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;s, which suggest a complementary distribution. Consonant clusters may occur both word-initially and word-medially.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Orthography ==
Traditional Keresan beliefs postulate that Keres is a sacred language that must exist only in its spoken form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandt|first=Elizabeth|date=1981|title=Native American Attitudes toward Literacy and Recording in the Southwest|url=|journal=Journal of the Linguistic Association of the Southwest|volume=4 |issue=2|pages=185–195|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language's religious connotation and years of persecution of Pueblo religion by European colonizers may also explain why no unified orthographic convention exists for Keresan. However, a practical spelling system has been developed for Laguna (K’awaika)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and more recently for Acoma (Áak’u) Keres,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keres.co/|title=The Keres Language Project|last=|first=|date=|website=The Keres Language Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which are remarkably consistent.

In the Keres spelling system, each symbol represents a single phoneme. The letters &lt; c q z f &gt; and sometimes also &lt; v &gt; are not used. [[digraph (orthography)|Digraphs]] represent both palatal consonants (written using a sequence of C and &lt; y &gt;), and retroflex consonants, which are represented using a sequence of C and the letter &lt; r &gt;. These [[graphemes]] used for writing Western Keres are shown between &lt;&gt; below.

=== Vowel Symbols ===
Vowel sounds are represented straightforwardly in the existing spellings for Keresan. Each vowel sound is written using a unique letter or digraph (for long vowels and [[diphthongs]]). However, there are two competing representations for the vowel /ɨ/. Some versions simply use the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] &lt;ɨ&gt; whereas others use the letter &lt;v&gt; (the sound /v/ as in ''veal'' does not occur in Keresan). Voiceless vowels have also been represented in two ways; either underlined or with a dot below (see table).

==== Diacritics for Tone ====
Tone may or may not be represented in the orthography of Keresan. When represented, four diacritics may be used above the vowel. Unlike the system used for [[Navajo language|Navajo]], diacritics for tone are not repeated in long vowels.

==== Keres Alphabet and Alphabetical order ====
Although Keresan is not normally written, there exists only one dictionary of the language in which words are listed in any given order. In this [http://dictionary.keres.co/ dictionary] of Western Keres, digraphs count as single letters, although ejective consonants are not listed separately; occurring after their non-ejective counterparts. Both the glottal stop &lt; ' &gt;  and long vowels (e.g. &lt; aa, ee, ii &gt; etc.) are not treated as separate letters.

=== Sample texts ===

==== Orthography marking tone ====
&lt;u&gt;Woodpecker and Coyote&lt;/u&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

''Ái dítʾîishu srbígà kʾánâaya dyáʾâʾu. Sh'ée srbígà ái dyěits&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt; ái náyáa shdyɨ dyáʾa.''

==== Orthography without tone marking ====
&lt;u&gt;Boas text&lt;/u&gt; &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

''Baana’a, egu kau’see’e, atsi s’aama-ee srayutse.''

== Morphosyntax ==
Keresan is a [[Split ergativity|split-ergative]] language in which verbs denoting states (i.e. [[stative verb]]s) behave differently from those indexing actions, especially in terms of the [[Grammatical person|person]] [[affix]]es they take. This system of [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]] marking is based on a split-intransitive pattern, in which [[Subject (grammar)|subjects]] are marked differently if they are perceived as actors than from when they are perceived as undergoers of the action being described.

The morphology of Keresan is mostly [[prefix]]ing, although [[suffix]]es and [[reduplication]] also occur.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Keresan distinguishes [[noun]]s, verbs, [[Numeral (linguistics)|numerals]] and [[Grammatical particle|particles]] as word classes. Nouns in Keresan do not normally distinguish [[Grammatical case|case]] or [[Grammatical number|number]], but they can be [[Agreement (linguistics)|inflected]] for [[Grammatical possession|possession]], with distinct constructions for [[Inalienable possession|alienable]] and inalienable possession. Other than possession, Keresan nouns show no comprehensive [[noun class]]es.

=== Word order ===
Keresan is a [[Word order|verb-final]] language, though word order is rather flexible.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Laguna Keres&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

|&lt;small&gt;Bill&lt;/small&gt;

|-
| colspan="3" |'John saw Bill'
|}

==== Negation ====
Negation is doubly marked in Keresan. In addition to the adverb ''dzaadi'', verbs index negation through a suffix (e.g. ''-u'').
* ''Gukacha'' 'S/he saw her/him'
* '''''Dzaadi''' gukacha'''u''''' 'S/he didn't see her/him'

=== Verbal morphology ===
The [[verb]] is a central [[grammatical category]] in Keres, conveying the most information about events in communicative acts.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Through its [[morpheme]]s, Keresan verbs code not only person and number of the initiator of the action (e.g. 'Tammy drink'''s''' decaf') as is common in [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] languages, but also how the initiator is implicated in the action. For instance, the three verbs that describe Tammy's actions in 'Tammy kicked the ball' vs. 'Tammy jumped' vs. 'Tammy sneezed', where ''kicking, jumping'' and ''sneezing'' require different levels of effort from Tammy. The person and number of the undergoer of the action is also coded on the verb (e.g. ''gukacha'' means 'S/he sees her/him' on its la ), as well as how the speaker assesses the action ('I think Tammy arrived from class' vs. 'Tammy arrived from class'). Finally, the internal temporal structure of the action (i.e. [[Aspect (grammar)|aspect]], as in 'Tammy '''was''' sneez'''ing''' in class' vs. 'Tammy sneez'''ed''' in class').

According to Maring (1967), the Keresan verb is organized around the following grammatical categories (pp. 39-40)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

* '''''Subject/Object relations'''''
** ''Subject of intransitive verbs:'' marked by a prefix that distinguishes 3-4 persons in the singular (see below).
** ''Subject of transitive verbs:'' marked by a prefix that distinguishes 3-4 persons in the singular (see below).
** ''Object of transitive verbs:'' marked by a prefix that combines with the subject prefix, or by a [[suffix]]
* '''''Number relations'''''
** ''Singular:'' usually marked by a prefix
** ''Dual:'' can be marked by a prefix, partial reduplication or by suffixes
** ''Plural:'' can be marked by a prefix, partial reduplication, by suffixes or by [[Suppletion|suppletive stem forms]] (i.e. singular and plural forms are not related [[Etymology|etymologically]])
* '''''Temporal relations'''''
** ''Future:'' is marked on the verb by a series of prefixes that also encode number
* '''''Modality relations'''''
** ''Indicative''
** ''[[Dubidative]]''
** ''[[Hortative]]''
*** ''Negative hortative''
** ''Negative''
*** ''Future negative''
* '''''Voice relations'''''
** ''Active''
** ''[[Passive voice|Passive]]''
** ''[[Reflexive voice|Reflexive]]''
** ''Reciprocal''
* '''''Aspect'''''
** ''Imperfective''
** ''Inceptive''
** ''Repetitive''
** ''Continuative''
** ''Habitual''
** ''Inchoative''
** ''Perfective''

==== The verbal prefix ====
In Keres, the verbal prefix carries information from five different grammatical categories: [[Argument (linguistics)|argument role]], [[Grammatical mood|modality]], [[Affirmation and negation|polarity]],&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; person and number. That is, a single Keresan verb prefix codes who initiated the action and how implicated that entity is (the subject/case), whom underwent the effects of the action (the direct object), the speaker's assessment of the action (the modality)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29387125|title=The evolution of grammar : tense, aspect, and modality in the languages of the world|last=L.|first=Bybee, Joan|date=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=Perkins, Revere D. (Revere Dale), Pagliuca, William.|isbn=0226086631|location=Chicago|oclc=29387125}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whether it occurred or not (polarity). On the other hand, information about when the action took place (i.e. [[Tense–aspect–mood|tense]]) is expressed elsewhere in a clause, mostly by adverbs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===== Number =====
Keresan verbs distinguish three numbers: [[Grammatical number|singular]], [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] (two entities) and [[plural]] (more than two entities);  and four [[Person (grammar)|persons]]: [[Grammatical person|first]] (the speaker), second (the hearer), third (a known, definite or salient entity being talked about) and [[Obviative|fourth]] (a non-salient, unknown or indefinite entity being talked about, also known as obviative) persons. The plural and dual forms are often marked by reduplication of part of the stem ('''''gu'''kacha'' 's/he saw it' vs '''guʾu'''kacha 'the two of them saw it').

===== Argument role =====
Languages encode two main types of actions: those in which the main participant initiates an action that produces change in an object (e.g. ''kick &lt;u&gt;a ball,&lt;/u&gt; buy &lt;u&gt;a gift&lt;/u&gt;, cook &lt;u&gt;a dish&lt;/u&gt;, read &lt;u&gt;a book&lt;/u&gt;'');  and those in which the action produces no (perceived) change in the world or that have no object (''sneezing, breathing, growing, diving'', etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/70727915|title=Syntax : an introduction. Volume 1|last=1936-|first=Givón, Talmy,|date=2001|publisher=J. Benjamins|isbn=1588110656|edition= Rev.|location=Amsterdam|oclc=70727915}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Actions that take an object are encoded by [[transitive verbs]], whereas those that take no object are expressed via [[intransitive verb]]s.

====== Intransitive verbs ======
In [[Indo-European languages]] like English, all intransitive verbs behave similarly ('They sneeze/breathe/dive/think/etc.'). In Keresan, actions that take no object are conceptualized in two distinct ways depending on how implicated the initiator of the action is. More active-like intransitive verbs are coded through one set of morphemes, whereas actions conceptualized as involving the initiator at a lesser degree are coded using a separate set of prefixes.

|'''Less'''
|''to believe'' (-hima), ''to be born'' (-dyá), ''to sleep (''-bái),

|}
Ideas expressed in Indo-European languages with adjectives are most often encoded by verbs in Keresan. That is, in Keresan one says 'He selfishes' as opposed to 'He is selfish'. Such "actions" are beyond the control of the entity that is characterized by them, and thus belong in the Inactive intransitive category. The different sets of prefixes are shown below:

=== Time (tense) adverbials ===
The category of tense is expressed in Keresan via adverbs that indicate when the action about which one is speaking took place.

== Lexicon ==
New words are coined through a number of roots that are combined to pre-existing ones. Compounding is a common strategy for word building, although [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivation]] also occurs.

=== Numerals ===
The Keresan numeral system is a base 10 system. Numerals 11-19, as well as those between the multiple of tens, are formed by adding the word ''k'átsi'' (/ kʼátsʰɪ /  'ten') ''f''ollowed by the word ''dzidra (''/tsɪtʂa/ 'more'). Numerals 20 and above are formed by adding a multiplicative adverb (''-wa'' or ''-ya'') to the base number and the word ''k'átsi''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Loanwords from Spanish ===
[[European colonization of the Americas|European colonizers]] arriving in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest US]] brought with them [[material culture]] and concepts that were unknown to the peoples living in the area. Words for the new ideas introduced by Spaniards were often [[Loanword|borrowed]] into Keres directly from [[Early Modern Spanish]], and a large number of these persists in Modern Keresan.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''Kfar HaHoresh''' ({{lang-he-n|כְּפַר הַחֹרֶשׁ, כפר החורש}}, ''lit.'' village of the thicket) is a [[kibbutz]] in northern [[Israel]]. Located near [[Nazareth]], it falls under the jurisdiction of [[Jezreel Valley Regional Council]]. 
In {{Israel populations|Year}} it had a population of {{Israel populations|Kefar Hahoresh}}.{{Israel populations|reference}}

==History==
The kibbutz was established in 1933 by members of the [[Gordonia (youth movement)|Gordonia]] youth movement who had previously been living in [[Ness Ziona]]. The land had been bought by the [[Jewish National Fund]] in 1930. Today the kibbutz has been privatized. The Arabic-language radio station ''Radio A-Shams'' broadcasts from the kibbutz.

==Archaeology==
An important [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] site in the vicinity of the kibbutz is under excavation since early 1990s by an expedition of [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] directed by Professor [[Nigel Goring-Morris]]. According to the excavator, the site represents a regional funerary center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/goringmorris/index.html |title=The 2007–8 excavation seasons at Pre-Pottery Neolithic B Kfar HaHoresh, Israel |volume=82 |issue=318 |date=December 2008 |journal=[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]] |publisher=[[Durham University]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915232159/http://antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/goringmorris/index.html |archive-date=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is associated with the [[Neolithic]] transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/new-fieldwork-at-shuqba-cave-and-in-wadi-en-natuf-western-judea/A6EA5D669E97668F9B34308C682FD3E0 |title=New fieldwork at Shuqba Cave and in Wadi en-Natuf, Western Judea |last=Boyd |first=Brian |author-link=Brian Boyd |last2=Crossland |first2=Zoë |date=December 2000 |doi=10.1017/S0003598X00060294 |volume=74 |issue=286 |pages=755-756 |journal=[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
The kibbutz fielded a football team, which competed in [[1949–50 Liga Meuhedet|Liga Meuhedet]] in [[1949–50 in Israeli football|1949–50]]; the team finished eighth in the league's North Division.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10290">'''Ledger art''' is a term for [[Plains Indians|Plains Indian]] narrative drawing or painting on paper or cloth. Ledger art flourished primarily from the 1860s to the 1920s. A revival of ledger art began in the 1960s and 1970s. The term comes from the accounting [[ledger]] books that were a common source of paper for [[Plains Indians]] during the late 19th century.
[[File:Ledger-sm2.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Kiowa]] ledger art from 1874]]

==Historical precedents==
[[File:At the Sand Creek Massacre, 1874-1875.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sand Creek massacre]] as drawn by eyewitness [[Howling Wolf (Cheyenne)|Howling Wolf]] (1874–1875).]]
Ledger art evolved from [[Plains hide painting]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;[https://plainsledgerart.org/history/ "Ledger Art History."] ''Department of Ethnic Studies, University of California San Diego: Plains Indian Ledger Art Project.'' 2011 (retrieved 2 Oct 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Among Plains tribes, women traditionally paint abstract, geometrical designs, whereas men paint [[Representation (arts)|representational]] designs. The men's designs were often heraldic devices or visions painted on shields, [[tipi]]s, shirts, leggings, or robes. Before the Plains tribes were forced to live on reservations in the 1870s, men generally painted personal feats in battle or hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 138&lt;/ref&gt; Plains ledger art depicted communally acknowledged events of valor and tribal importance in order to gain status for the individuals who participated in them, and their band and kin.  Plains pictorial art emphasizes narrative action and eliminates unnecessary detail or backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, 11&lt;/ref&gt; Figures tended to be drawn in hard outlines and filled with solid fields of color.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, 63&lt;/ref&gt;

These were all traditionally painted on animal hides – particularly [[American bison|buffalo]] hides. When buffalo became scarce after eradication programs encouraged by the US federal government, Plains artists began painting and drawing on paper, canvas, and muslin.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

==New materials==
An increasing supply of ledger books and other paper came from traders, government agents, missionaries, and military officers.&lt;ref&gt;Swan, 70&lt;/ref&gt; With these came pencils, ink fountain pens, crayons, and watercolor paints.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 139&lt;/ref&gt; These new tools allowed for greater detail and experimentation than the earlier tools, such as bone or wood styli dipped in mineral pigments, had. The compact ledger books and pencils were highly portable, making them ideal for nomadic lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fort Marion==
[[File:Blackhawk-spiritbeing.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Drawing by [[Black Hawk (artist)|Black Hawk]] ([[Sans Arc|Sans Arc Lakota]]), c. 1880 depicting a horned Thunder Being (''Haokah'') on a horse-like creature with eagle talons and buffalo horns. The creature's tail forms a rainbow that represents the entrance to the Spirit World, and the dots represent hail. Accompanying the picture on the page were the words: "Dream or vision of himself changed to a destroyer and riding a buffalo eagle."]]
The most celebrated ledger artists were prisoners of war at [[Castillo de San Marcos|Fort Marion]] in [[St. Augustine, Florida]]. In 1874, in what became known as the [[Red River War]] or Buffalo War, a group of [[Cheyenne]], [[Kiowa]], [[Comanche]], [[Arapaho]], and [[Caddo]] warriors fought the US Army to protect the last free herd of buffalo and to assert their autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, 12–14&lt;/ref&gt; In the harsh winter of 1874 to 1875, many tribal camps were forced to surrender to various Indian agencies, and the supposed leaders of the Red River War were rounded up and sent to Fort Marion.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, 14&lt;/ref&gt; From 1875 to 1878, the 71 men and one woman were under the command of [[Richard Henry Pratt]], who used the opportunity to give the Indians a Western education.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

He also provided the prisoners with basic art supplies, such as pencils, ink, crayons, watercolor paint, and paper.

Twenty-six of the Fort Marion prisoners engaged in drawing. They were younger Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Kiowa men.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, 29&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most prolific and well-known artists include [[Paul Caryl Zotom]] (Kiowa); [[David Pendleton Oakerhater]] or Making Medicine (Cheyenne); [[Tichkematse]] or Squint Eyes (Cheyenne), who later worked for the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, DC; [[Wohaw]] (Kiowa); [[Howling Wolf (Cheyenne)]]; [[Etahdleuh Doanmoe]] (Kiowa); White Bear (Arapaho); Koba (Kiowa); and [[Bear’s Heart]] (Cheyenne).  Tichtematse, Howling Wolf, White Bear, and Koba all continued drawing after their release from prison.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, 110&lt;/ref&gt;

Battle exploits dominated ledger art. Other traditional themes such as hunting, courtship,&lt;ref name=gus&gt;Fauntleroy, Gussie. [http://www.nativepeoples.com/Native-Peoples/September-October-2011/Looking-Between-the-Lines/#.Tj60ZAFyY4Y.facebook "Ledger Art: Looking Between the Lines."] ''Native Peoples.'' Sept/Oct 2011 (retrieved 7 Aug 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; and religious practices were common subjects. Ledger artists also documented their rapidly changing environment by portraying encroaching European Americans and new technologies such as trains and cameras. Many ledger artists worked with ethnologists, by documenting shield and tipi designs, ethnobotanical information, [[winter count]]s, dance customs and regalia, and other cultural information. Dreams and visions inspired ledger art just as they had inspired earlier hide paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 140&lt;/ref&gt;

The artists creating ledger art today often reference pre-reservation lifeways, historical transitions, and social commentary.  They use this style to illustrate cultural continuity between historical and contemporary Native life.&lt;ref name=gus/&gt;

==As fine art==
[[File:RedDogDrawing.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The warrior "Low Dog" by Red Dog, 1884 ledger art]]
Missionaries, anthropologists, and tourists eagerly collected ledger books in the late 19th century. [[Carl Sweezy]] (1881–1953) (Arapaho) and ''[[Haungooah]]'' (Silver Horn) (1860–1940) (Kiowa) both established professional careers as ledger artists.

They inspired the [[Kiowa Five]] or, as they are increasingly known, the Kiowa Six.  These artists painted with more sophisticated materials and met with international success when they exhibited their work in the 1928 International Art Congress in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]].

==Today==
Numerous modern Plains artists create ledger paintings, including many women artists despite its history as a male domain.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;  Many seek out 19th-century documents on which to paint, creating ironic juxtapositions between the printed text and the paintings. [[Dwayne Wilcox]] ([[Oglala Lakota]]) uses the style of 19th-century Lakota painters to express humorous views of modern realities for Lakota people. [[Arthur Amiotte]] (Oglala Lakota) builds upon the collage aspect of ledger art and combines text, photography, naturalistic painting and stylized Plains pictorial art in his work. [[Dolores Purdy Corcoran]] ([[Caddo]]/[[Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska|Winnebago]]) is a female ledger artist who uses bright colors and female figures frequently in her work.&lt;ref&gt;Fauntleroy, Gussie.

'''Legal naturalism''' is a term coined by [[Olufemi Taiwo]] to describe a current in the social philosophy of [[Karl Marx]] which can be interpreted as one of [[Natural Law]]. Taiwo considered it the manifestation of Natural Law in a [[dialectical materialism|dialectical materialist]] context.

The '''Liberal Republican Party of the United States''' was an American [[political party]] that was organized in May 1872 to oppose the reelection of President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and his [[Radical Republican]] supporters in the [[United States presidential election, 1872|presidential election of 1872]]. The party emerged in Missouri under the leadership of Senator [[Carl Schurz]] and soon attracted other opponents of Grant. The party opposed Grant's [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] policies and sought [[U.S. Civil Service Reform|civil service reform]]. It lost in a landslide and disappeared after the 1872 election.

The [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] had emerged as the dominant party in the aftermath of the Civil War, but many original Republicans became dissatisfied with the leadership of President Grant. Prominent Liberal leaders like Schurz, [[Charles Sumner]] and [[Lyman Trumbull]] had been leaders in the fight against slavery and for the first stages of Reconstruction. They considered the job done and by 1872 demanded an end to Reconstruction and a restoration of  self-government to the South.  Liberal Republicans decried the scandals of the Grant administration and sought civil service reform.

The [[1872 Liberal Republican convention]] nominated a ticket consisting of [[Horace Greeley]], longtime publisher of the ''[[New-York Tribune]]''; and Missouri Governor [[Benjamin Gratz Brown]]. Seeking to defeat Grant, the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] nominated the Liberal Republican ticket and endorsed the Liberal Republican platform. However, Grant emerged triumphant in the election, capitalizing on superior party organization. Democrats lacked of enthusiasm for Greeley, who for decades had denounced them. Greeley received 44% of the popular vote, winning the states of Texas, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and Maryland. Grant received 286 of the 352 [[electoral college]] votes.  Greeley died shortly after the election.

The Liberal Republican Party vanished immediately after the election, though a handful of its leaders continued to serve in Congress. Former Liberals party members scattered into the Democratic and Republican parties.  By cutting the allegiance of liberal elements to the Republican Party, the Liberal Republicans made it possible for many of these leaders, such as Schurz, to move to the Democratic Party.

==History of the party==
[[File:1872 Cincinnati Convention of Liberal Republicans (cropped).jpg|thumb|Interior of the convention hall during the announcement of [[Horace Greeley]] as the [[1872 Liberal Republican convention|party's nominee for President in 1872]]]]

===Formation===
The party began in Missouri in 1870 under the leadership of [[Carl Schurz]] and spread nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;Gerber (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; It had strong support from powerful Republican newspaper editors such as [[Murat Halstead]] of the ''Cincinnati Commercial'', [[Horace White (writer)|Horace White]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', [[Henry Watterson]] of the ''[[Louisville Courier-Journal]]'', [[Samuel Bowles (journalist)|Samuel Bowles]] of the ''[[The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Springfield Republican]]'' and especially [[Whitelaw Reid]] and [[Horace Greeley]] of the ''[[New-York Tribune]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Summers, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Many Liberal Republican leaders had been Democrats and members of the [[Free Soil Party]] before joining the Republican Party after its creation in the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Downey, pp. 730-731&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberal Republicans thought that the Grant administration and the President personally were fully corrupt. More important they thought that the goals of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] had been achieved. These goals were first the destruction of slavery and second the destruction of Confederate nationalism. With these goals achieved the tenets of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] demanded that federal military troops be removed from the South, where they were propping up allegedly corrupt Republican regimes. Many of the original founders of the Republican party and leaders of the Civil War joined the movement, including its nominee [[Horace Greeley]], [[Charles Sumner]] of Massachusetts, [[Lyman Trumbull]] of Illinois, [[Cassius Marcellus Clay (1810–1903)|Cassius Marcellus Clay]] of Kentucky and [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]] of Massachusetts. The party platform demanded "the immediate and absolute removal of all disabilities imposed on account of the rebellion" and local self-government for the southern states. It regarded "a thorough [[Civil Service Reform Act|reform of the civil service]] as one of the most pressing necessities of the hour". Many Liberal Republicans also sought a downward revision of the [[tariffs in United States history|tariff]], believing that powerful industries had unfairly won the [[Protectionism|protection]] of certain goods.&lt;ref name="Ross 1910"&gt;Ross (1910)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberal Republicans believed in civil and political rights for African Americans and argued that goal had been achieved. Hence, now they said it was time for "amnesty", which meant restoring the right to vote and hold office to ex Confederates.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Burg, "Amnesty, Civil Rights, and the Meaning of Liberal Republicanism, 1862-1872". ''American Nineteenth Century History'' 2003 4(3): 29-60.&lt;/ref&gt; A key motivation for many Liberal Republicans was a belief in [[states' rights]] and a fear of a strong federal government.&lt;ref name="mdinunzio1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DiNunzio|first1=Mario R.|title=Lyman Trumbull, the States' Rights Issue, and the Liberal Republican Revolt|journal=Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society (1908-1984)|date=Winter 1973|volume=66|issue=4|pages=364–375|jstor=40190731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Liberal Republicans had joined the Republican Party in the 1850s in opposition to the expansion of slavery into the territories, but with slavery no longer an issue and the Civil War over other issues such as federal power re-emerged.&lt;ref name="mdinunzio1"/&gt; Many of the Liberal Republicans, including Trumbull, had opposed the [[impeachment of Andrew Johnson]] and were wary of an upset of the traditional constitutional balance of power.&lt;ref name="mdinunzio1"/&gt;

===1872 convention===
Led by Schurz, judge [[Stanley Matthews (lawyer)|Stanley Matthews]] and editor William Grosvenor, the Liberal Republican Party organized a [[1872 Liberal Republican convention|national convention]] in Cincinnati in May 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Downey, pp. 730-731&lt;/ref&gt; In Missouri, Democrats and Liberal Republicans had successfully [[Missouri gubernatorial election, 1870|defeated]] the incumbent Republican governor and the Liberal Republicans hoped to nominate a presidential candidate who could likewise win the support of Democrats.&lt;ref name=witcover/&gt; Though Schurz had founded the party, he was ineligible to run for President as he had been born in Germany and instead became the chairman of the convention. Those who attended the convention had various motivations, though all were united in opposition to Grant. Many delegates were attracted to the party's support for civil service reform and an end to Reconstruction. Others like [[Reuben Fenton]] hoped to recapture control of state party organizations. In Missouri, the Liberal Republicans had become established as a major party, but the other states lacked a party organization and their delegations were little more than self-appointed committees.&lt;ref&gt;Downey, pp. 734-736&lt;/ref&gt;

Entering the convention, Supreme Court Justice [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]], Senator [[Lyman Trumbull]] of Illinois and former Congressman [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]] of Massachusetts were among the major candidates for the presidential nomination.&lt;ref name=witcover&gt;{{cite book|last1=Witcover|first1=Jules|title=Party of the People|date=2003|publisher=Random House|pages=241–243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schurz favored Adams, but was unwilling to publicly back a candidate as he wished to retain the appearance of impartiality. Davis entered the week of the convention with perhaps the strongest backing, but saw his candidacy damaged by unfavorable coverage from newspapers aligned with the Liberal Republican movement.&lt;ref&gt;Downey, pp. 737-738&lt;/ref&gt; Newspaper publisher [[Horace Greeley]] of New York won the support of many former Davis backers, despite some concern about his lack of support for tariff reduction.&lt;ref&gt;Downey, pp. 741-743&lt;/ref&gt;

On the first ballot of the convention, Adams and Greeley emerged as the two strongest contenders for the nomination. Most delegates voted for Adams or Greeley on subsequent ballots, though Trumbull retained significant support. On the sixth and final ballot, Greeley picked up just enough to clinch the nomination. Following the presidential nomination, the convention chose Missouri Governor [[Benjamin Gratz Brown]] as the party's vice presidential nominee. Brown had supported Greeley's nomination as a way to increase his power within the state party at the expense of Schurz and Brown won the support of most pro-Greeley delegates on the vice presidential ballot.&lt;ref&gt;Downey, pp. 741-750&lt;/ref&gt;

===1872 campaign===
{{see also|United States presidential election, 1872|Horace Greeley presidential campaign, 1872}}
Prior to the Liberal Republican convention, Democratic leaders had given the Liberal Republicans assurances that they would nominate the Liberal Republican ticket. The Democrats believed that they could not win the 1872 election without anti-Grant Republicans and Democratic leaders hoped that they would reap patronage rewards from a Liberal Republican presidency. However, Democratic leaders were dismayed by the nomination of Greeley. Many Southern Democrats were eager to elect any candidate that might put an end to Grant's Reconstruction policies, but Greeley's frequent attacks on the Democratic Party had earned the enmity of many Democrats, especially in the Northeast.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, pp. 129-135&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these qualms, most Democrats decided that Greeley was better than Grant and represented their only chance to defeat the Republican President. Though several state conventions endured considerable debate, every state Democratic convention other than Delaware's convention ultimately endorsed Greeley. By a wide margin, the July [[1872 Democratic National Convention]] voted to endorse the Liberal Republican ticket and accept the party's platform without modification. After the convention, a group of disaffected Democrats led by [[Blanton Duncan]] nominated [[Charles O'Conor (American politician)|Charles O'Conor]] and [[John Quincy Adams II]] on the [[Straight-Out Democratic Party]] ticket, but both refused the nomination and neither actively campaigned.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, pp. 129-141, 146-147&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberal Republican Party fused with the Democratic Party in all states except for Louisiana and Texas. In states where Republicans were stronger, the Liberal Republicans fielded a majority of the joint slate of candidates for lower offices; while in states where Democrats were stronger, the Democrats fielded the most candidates. In many states, such as Ohio, each party nominated half of a joint slate of candidates. Even initially reluctant Democratic leaders like [[Thomas F. Bayard]] came to support Greeley.&lt;ref name="Ross 1910"/&gt;

The 1872 campaign was primarily conducted on personalities rather than issues, with Greeley and Grant both sustaining numerous personal attacks.&lt;ref name=ross150160/&gt; Greeley favored protectionism and did not emphasize civil service reform, two of the motivating issues for the party's founders. Greeley attacked many of Grant's many appointments as corrupt, but Greeley's past associations with Republican leaders undermined the corruption argument.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, pp. 167-169&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Liberal Republican leaders like Schurz and Sumner coalesced behind Greeley and most actively campaigned for the party's nominee.&lt;ref name=ross150160&gt;Ross, pp. 150-160&lt;/ref&gt; Grant's backers accused the Liberal Republicans of seeking to overturn the results of the Civil War and the Republicans mobilized veteran's organizations in support of Grant. Liberal Republicans argued that they sought reconciliation of North and South and that the time had come to end radical Reconstruction policies.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, pp. 173-176&lt;/ref&gt; Each party sought to appeal to African Americans, with the Liberal Republican appeal centering on Greeley's long history of abolitionism. However, [[Fredrick Douglass]] successfully organized blacks in support of Grant.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, pp. 163-165&lt;/ref&gt; Many inside and outside of the Liberal Republican Party believed that their coalition would triumph in the 1872 election and the outcome of the election remained in doubt until October.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, pp. 177-183&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Republicans utilized superior organization, the backing of financiers like [[Jay Cooke]] and lingering Democratic doubts about Greeley to win most elections throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, pp. 184-190&lt;/ref&gt;

In the election, Greeley won 43.8% of the popular vote and just 66 of the 352 electoral votes, while O'Conor won 0.3% of the popular vote. Greeley died on November 29, 1872 before the presidential electors met on December 4 to cast the electoral votes. The Greeley electors were not able to coordinate their votes before meeting, but their action made no difference in the face of Grant's [[electoral college]] landslide.&lt;ref&gt;Most Greeley electors (42 of 66) voted for Thomas A. Hendricks for President. Greeley electors who were Liberal Republicans cast 18 electoral votes for B. Gratz Brown (8 in Missouri, 6 in Georgia, and 4 in Kentucky). Two Greeley electors voted for Charles Jenkins, one for David Davis, and three electors (in Georgia) voted for Greeley, even though he had died. Congress refused to count the three electoral votes cast for Greeley.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
Although the Liberal Republican Party did not survive Greeley's death, several of its reforms materialized in the following decade. Reform Republicans accomplished the nomination and then election of [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in [[United States presidential election, 1876|1876]], who brought Reconstruction to an end and removed some of the more offensive of Grant's appointments. The Liberal Republican call for civil service reform was passed during the administration of President [[Chester Arthur]].&lt;ref name="Ross 1910"/&gt; However, Greeley's relatively poor performance (he fared worse than [[Horatio Seymour]] had in [[United States presidential election, 1868|1868]]) also put an end to the Democratic experiment with fusion tickets.&lt;ref name=witcover/&gt;

Though the national party organization disappeared, several Liberal Republican members continued to serve in Congress after the 1872 elections. While those in the House were allowed to keep their committee assignments and chairmanships, Liberal Republican Senators became de facto independents and received inferior committee assignments. Most Liberal Republican Congressmen eventually joined the Democratic Party. Outside of the South, some Liberal Republicans sought the creation of a new party opposed to Republicans, but Democrats were unwilling to abandon their old party affiliation and even relatively successful efforts like Wisconsin's [[Reform Party (19th-century Wisconsin)|Reform Party]] collapsed. Even the Missouri Liberal Republican Party collapsed as the Democrats became the major opposition party to the Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, pp. 192-230&lt;/ref&gt;

Democrats won several seats in Congress and numerous other offices in the [[United States elections, 1874|1874 elections]], aided by dissatisfaction with Grant and the defection of former Liberal Republicans. As Republicans became increasingly worried about their chances in the [[United States elections, 1876|1876 elections]], they courted former Liberal Republican leaders like Schurz and Fenton. Both parties made direct appeals to former Liberal Republicans in the 1876 elections and former party supporters split roughly evenly between the two presidential candidates. Schurz actively campaigned for Hayes and became the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of Interior]] after Hayes won the election. In the following years, former Liberal Republicans became members in good standing of both major parties. In the 1880s, many would join the [[Mugwumps|Mugwump]] movement in opposition to [[James G. Blaine]]. Many also joined the [[Greenback Party]], which sought inflationary policies and labor reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, pp. 230-239&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
[[File:Cincinnati Convention of Liberal Republicans.png|thumb|[[Thomas Nast]]'s caricature of the [[1856 Democratic National Convention|Cincinnati Convention]] from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', April 13, 1872]]
Historian Richard Gerber (1975) argues that most authors and historians portray the Liberal Republicans as an aberration, noting the many unresolved issues of the [[Reconstruction Era]]. He groups the historical interpretations of the party that prevailed after 1872 into two main categories. One historical interpretation emphasizes the Liberal Republican push for the re-establishment of self-government in the South and the restoration of national unity. The second interpretation sees the Liberal Republicans as primarily motivated by opposition to the corruption of the Grant administration and support for lower tariffs.&lt;ref&gt;Gerber (1975), pp. 40-42, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

Downey (1967) argues Greeley was nominated as a result of a crass political bargain imposed against the will of a convention that really wanted Charles Francis Adams. Men like Schurz supported Adams, but were inexperienced political idealists and not professional politicians. They neither acted nor voted as a bloc, particularly after the collapse of a boom for David Davis, a collapse engineered by a group of leading reformist Republican editors. The shift of particular votes to Greeley was not decisive, but the feeling of the delegates that Adams could not win support among Irish workers, the Western masses, or Democratic voters.&lt;ref&gt;Downey (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lunde (1978) argues Grant supporters hailed the Civil War as a great triumph which had bound the United States into a united nation, linked not only by sentiment but by rapidly increasing networks of railroads. The Democrats and their Liberal Republican allies thought the war was a tragedy, recoiled against centralization and sought to recapture the purity of prewar days through reconciliation and respect for the autonomy of the states. Greeley's benevolent image of nationalism was defeated by the centralizing, "blood and iron" concept of Grant.&lt;ref&gt;Lunde (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

McPherson (1972) argues that three-quarters of ex abolitionists favored Grant, although such antislavery Republicans as Charles Francis Adams, Carl Schurz and Charles Sumner were key supporters of Greeley. Focused on the welfare of the freedmen, abolitionists were appalled by Greeley's formula for cooperation with "better class" southern whites by granting amnesty to all Confederates and adopting a hands-off policy toward the South. They supported Grant in the belief that his Southern policy promised the best protection for the African Americans. Most abolitionists believed that, moral suasion having failed earlier, true equality could be achieved only through relentless law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

Slap (2006) redeems the reputation of the Liberal Republicans from allegations of opportunism (as presented by [[Ari Hoogenboom]]), of elitism (as presented by John G. Sproat) and racism as presented by the [[Neoabolitionism|neoabolitionists]].  He joins Heather Cox Richardson and David Quigley in concluding that Reconstruction ended not because of politicized violence in the South, but because of the Northern decision that the war goals had been achieved and it would thwart [[Republicanism in the United States|republican ideals]] to continue Army rule of the South.

'''Linguistic Intelligence''' is a part of [[Howard Gardner]]'s [[Theory of multiple intelligences|multiple intelligence theory]] that deals with individuals' ability to understand both [[Spoken language|spoken]] and [[written language]], as well as their ability to speak and write themselves.  In a practical sense, linguistic intelligence is the extent to which an individual can use [[language]], both written and verbal, to achieve goals.&lt;ref name="FM 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fernandez-Martinez|first=Fernando|author2=Kseniya Zablotskaya |author3=Wolfgang Minker |title=Text categorization methods for automatic estimation of verbal intelligence|journal=Expert Systems with Applications|date=Aug 2012|volume=39|issue=10|pages=9807–9820|doi=10.1016/j.eswa.2012.02.173}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, high linguistic intelligence has been linked to improved [[problem solving]], as well as to increased [[Abstraction|abstract reasoning]].&lt;ref name="Luwel 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Luwel|first=Koen|author2=Ageliki Foustana |author3=Patrick Onghena |author4=Lieven Verschaffel |title=The role of verbal and performance intelligence in children's strategy selection and execution|journal=Learning and Individual Differences|date=Apr 2013|volume=24|pages=134–138|doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2013.01.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, only the verbal aspects are taken into consideration. This is usually referred to as verbal intelligence or verbal fluency, and is commonly a reflection of an individual's overall linguistic intelligence.

==Physiologic and functional overview==
In order to understand linguistic intelligence, it is important to understand the [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanisms]] that control speech and language. These mechanisms can be broken down into four major groups: [[speech|speech generation]] (talking), [[Hearing|speech comprehension]] (hearing), [[Writing|writing generation]] (writing), and [[Reading (process)|writing comprehension]] (reading).

===Spoken language===

====Generation====
{{Main|Speech}}
[[File:Inferior frontal gyrus.png|thumb|left|[[Inferior frontal gyrus]]; a major part of the [[inferior frontal cortex]]]]
Speech production is process by which a thought in the brain is converted into an understandable auditory form.&lt;ref name="Bohland 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bohland|first=Jason|author2=Daniel Bullock |author3=Frank Guenther |title=Neural Representations and Mechanisms for the Performance of Simple Speech Sequences|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=Jul 2010|volume=22|issue=7|pages=1504–1529|doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21306|pmid=19583476|pmc=2937837}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dan 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dan|first=Haruka |author2=Sano, Kyutoku |author3=Oguro, Yokota |author4=Tsuzuki, Watanabe|title=Language-specific cortical activation patterns for verbal fluency tasks in Japanese as assessed by multichannel functional near-infrared spectroscopy|journal=Brain and Language|date=Aug 2013|volume=126|issue=2|pages=208–216|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2013.05.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodd 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodd|first=J.M. |author2=M.H. Davis |author3=I.S. Johnsrude|title=The neural mechanisms of speech comprehension: fMRI studies of semantic ambiguity|journal=Cerebral Cortex|date=Aug 2005|volume=15|issue=8|pages=1261–1269|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhi009|pmid=15635062}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a multistage mechanism that involves many different areas of the brain. The first stage is planning, where the brain constructs words and sentences that turn the thought into an understandable form.&lt;ref name="Bohland 2010" /&gt; This occurs primarily in the [[inferior frontal cortex]], specifically in an area known as [[Broca's area]].&lt;ref name="Dan 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodd 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Konrad 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Konrad|first=Andreas|author2=Goran Vucurevic |author3=Francesco Musso |author4=Georg Winterer |title=VBM-DTI Correlates of Verbal Intelligence: A Potential Link to Broca's area|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=Apr 2012|volume=24|issue=4|pages=888–895|doi=10.1162/jocn_a_00187 |pmid=22220724}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next, the brain must plan how to physically create the sounds necessary for speech by linking the planned speech with known sounds, or [[phonemes]]. While the location of these associations is not known, it is known that the [[supplementary motor area]] plays a key role in this step.&lt;ref name="Bohland 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Penfield&gt;{{cite book|last=Penfield|first=Wilder|title=Speech and Brain-Mechanism|year=1959|publisher=Atheneum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the brain must signal for the words to actually be spoken. This is carried out by the [[premotor cortex]] and the [[motor cortex]].&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt;

[[File:Human motor cortex topography.png|thumb|right|[[Motor cortex]] with muscle [[localization of function|localization]] shown]]
In most cases, speech production is controlled by the left hemisphere. In a series of studies, [[Wilder Penfield]], among others, probed the brains of both right-handed (generally [[Lateralization of brain function|left-hemisphere dominant]]) and left-handed (generally [[Lateralization of brain function|right-hemisphere dominant]]) patients. They discovered that, regardless of [[handedness]], the left hemisphere was almost always the speech controlling side. However, it has been discovered that in cases of neural [[Stress (biology)|stress]] ([[hemorrhage]], [[stroke]], etc.) the right hemisphere has the ability to take control of speech functions.&lt;ref name=Doidge&gt;{{cite book|last=Doidge|first=Norman|title=The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science|year=2007|publisher=Penguin Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comprehension ===
{{Main|Hearing}}
Verbal Comprehension is a fairly complex process, and it is not fully understood. From various studies and experiments, it has been found that the [[superior temporal sulcus]] activates when hearing human speech, and that speech processing seems to occur within [[Wernicke's area]].&lt;ref name="Rodd 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt;

====Auditory feedback and feedforward====
Hearing plays an important part in both speech generation and comprehension. When speaking, the person can hear their speech, and the brain uses what it hears as a [[feedback]] mechanism to fix [[speech error]]s.&lt;ref name="Perkell 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkell|first=Joseph|title=Movement goals and feedback and feed forward control mechanisms in speech production|journal=Journal of Neurolinguistics|date=Sep 2012|volume=25|issue=5|pages=382–407|doi=10.1016/j.jneuroling.2010.02.011|pmc=3361736}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a single [[feedback]] correction occurs multiple times, the brain will begin to incorporate the correction to all future speech, making it a [[Feed forward (control)|feed forward]] mechanism.&lt;ref name="Perkell 2012" /&gt; This is apparent in some deaf people. [[Deafness]], as well as other, smaller deficiencies in hearing, can greatly affect one's ability to comprehend spoken language, as well as to speak it.&lt;ref name="Tourville 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tourville|first=Jason|author2=Kevin Reilly |author3=Frank Guenther |title=Neural mechanisms underlying auditory feedback control of speech|journal=NeuroImage|date=1 February 2008|volume=39|issue=3|pages=1429–1443|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.09.054}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the person loses hearing ability later in life, most can still maintain a normal level of verbal intelligence. This is thought to be because of the brain's [[Feed forward (control)|feed forward]] mechanism still helping to fix [[speech error]]s, even in the absence of [[auditory feedback]].&lt;ref name="Perkell 2012" /&gt;

===Written language===

====Generation====
{{Main|Writing}}
Generation of written language is thought to be closely related to speech generation, relying on [[Broca's area]] for early processing and on the [[inferior frontal gyrus]] for semantic processing.&lt;ref name="Rodd 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; However, writing differs in two major ways. First, instead of relating the thought to sounds, the brain must relate the thought to symbols or letters, and second, the [[motor cortex]] activates a different set of muscles to write, than when speaking.&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt;

====Comprehension====
{{Main|Reading (process)|l1=Reading}}
Written comprehension, similar to spoken comprehension, seems to occur primarily in [[Wernicke's area]].&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; However, instead of using the auditory system to gain language input, written comprehension relies on the visual system.

==Genetic links==
[[File:Protein NRXN1 PDB 1c4r.png|thumb|right|Protein NRXN1, which is created from the NRXN1 gene]]
While the capabilities of the physical structures used are large factors in determining linguistic intelligence, there have been several [[genes]] that have been linked to individual linguistic ability.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szalontai|first=Adam|author2=Katalin Csiszar |title=Genetic insights into the functional elements of language|journal=Human Genetics|date=September 2013|volume=132|issue=9|pages=959–986|doi=10.1007/s00439-013-1317-0|pmid=23749164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NRXN1]] gene has been linked to general language ability, and [[mutation]]s of this gene has been shown to cause major issues to overall linguistic intelligence.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; The [[CNTNAP2]] gene is believed to affect [[language development]] and performance, and [[mutation]]s in this gene is thought to be involved in [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]].&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[PCDH11]] has been linked to language capacity, and it is believed to be one of the factors that accounts for the variation in linguistic intelligence.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt;

==Measurement and testing==
In general, it is difficult to test for linguistic intelligence as a whole, therefore verbal intelligence is often measured instead. This is done using various types of [[verbal fluency test]]s.&lt;ref name="Dan 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Konrad 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CC 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Casals-Coll|first=M. |author2=Sanchez-Benavides |author3=Quintana |author4=Manero |author5=Rognoni |author6=Calvo |author7=Palomo |author8=Aranciva |author9=Tamayo |author10=Pena-Casanova |title=Spanish normative studies in young adults (NEURONORMA young adults project): Normative data: norms for verbal fluency tests|journal=Neurologia|date=Jan–Feb 2013|volume=28|issue=1|pages=33–40|doi=10.1016/j.nrleng.2012.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verbal fluency tests===
*[[Semantics|Semantic]] Fluency Test - Subjects are asked to produce words in groups, such as animals, kitchen tools, fruits, etc. This type of test focuses on the subject's ability to generate words that have meaning to them. This test has been found to be sensitive to age.&lt;ref name="CC 2013" /&gt;
*Formal Fluency Test - Subjects are asked to produce words given specific letter-based rules. This test has been found to be sensitive to education level.&lt;ref name="CC 2013" /&gt;
**Initial Letter Fluency Test - A type of formal fluency test where the subject is asked to list words starting with a specific letter.&lt;ref name="CC 2013" /&gt;
**Excluded Letter Fluency Test - A type of formal fluency test where the subject is asked to list words that do not contain a certain letter.&lt;ref name="CC 2013" /&gt;
*[[Verb]] Fluency Test - Subjects are asked to list verbs. Subjects are then tested on their ability to use listed verbs.&lt;ref name="CC 2013" /&gt;
*Verbal Reproduction Test - Subjects are asked to listen to a [[monologue]]. They are then asked to repeat the monologue, and the subject is scored based on the number of words and [[Lemma (morphology)|lemmas]] used from the original monologue.&lt;ref name="FM 2012" /&gt;

===Verbal fluency in children===
In one series of tests, it was shown that when children were given verbal fluency tests, a larger portion of their [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] activated compared to adults, as well as activation of both the left and right hemispheres. This is most likely due to the high [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]] of newly developing brains.&lt;ref name="Gaillard 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaillard|first=W.D. |author2=Hertz-Pannier |author3=Mott |author4=Barnett |author5=LeBihan |author6=Theodore |title=Functional anatomy of cognitive development - fMRI of verbal fluency in children and adults|journal=Neurology|date=Jan 2000|volume=54|issue=1|pages=180–185|doi=10.1212/wnl.54.1.180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible conflict===
Recently, a study was done showing that verbal fluency test results can differ depending on the mental focus of the subject. In this study, mental focus on physical [[speech production]] mechanisms caused speech production times to suffer, whereas mental focus on [[auditory feedback]] improved these times.&lt;ref name="Lisman 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lisman|first=Amanda|author2=Neeraja, Sadagopan |title=Focus of attention and speech motor performance|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|date=May–Jun 2013|volume=46|issue=3|pages=281–293|doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2013.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disorders affecting linguistic intelligence==
{{Main|Speech-language pathology}}
Since linguistic intelligence is based on several complex skills, there are many disorders and injuries that can affect an individual's linguistic intelligence.

===Injuries===
Damage and injury in the brain can severely lower one's ability to communicate, and therefore lower one's linguistic intelligence. Common forms of major damage are [[strokes]], [[concussions]], [[brain tumor]]s, [[Virus|viral]]/[[bacteria]]l damage, and [[drug]]-related damage. The three major [[Language disorder|linguistic disorders]] that result from these injuries are [[aphasia]], [[alexia (condition)|alexia]], and [[agraphia]].&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; [[Aphasia]] is the inability to speak, and can be caused by damage to [[Broca's area]] or the [[motor cortex]].&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; Alexia is the inability to read, which can arise from damage to [[Wernicke's area]], among other places.&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; [[Agraphia]] is the inability to write which can also arise from damage to [[Broca's area]] or the [[motor cortex]].&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; In addition, damage to large areas of the brain can result in any combinations of these disorders, as well as a loss of other abilities.&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt;

===Pure language disorders===
There are several disorders that primarily affect only language skills. Three major pure language disorders are [[Developmental verbal dyspraxia]], [[specific language impairment]], and [[stuttering]].&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[Developmental verbal dyspraxia]] (DVD) is a disorder where children have errors in consonant and vowel production.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[Specific language impairment]] (SLI) is a disorder where the patient has a lack of [[language acquisition]] skills, despite a seemingly normal [[intelligence]] level in other areas.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[Stuttering]] is a fairly common disorder where speech flow is interrupted by involuntary repetitions of [[syllable]]s.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt;

===Other disorders affecting language===
Some disorders cause a wide array of effects, and language impairment is merely one of many possible [[symptom]]s. The two major disorders of this type are  [[autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorder]] and [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[Autism]] and other [[autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]] (ASD) are disorders in which the patient suffers from decreased [[social skills]] and lowered [[Cognitive flexibility|mental flexibility]]. As a result, many patients suffering from ASDs also have language problems, arising from both the lack of social interaction and lowered mental flexibility.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[Epilepsy]] is a disorder where electrical malfunctions or mis-communications in the brain cause [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]], leading to muscle [[spasm]]s and activation of other organs and systems of the body. Over time, epilepsy can lead to cognitive and behavioral decay. This mental decay can eventually lead to a loss of language and communication skills.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt;

While [[compass surveying]], the magnetic needle is sometimes disturbed from its normal position under the influence of external attractive forces. Such a disturbing influence is called as '''local attraction'''.&lt;ref&gt;surveying volume 1 by Dr B.c Punmia and Ashok Kumar Jain. Chapter Compass Surveying&lt;/ref&gt; The external forces are produced by sources of local attraction which may be current carrying wire (magnetic materials) or [[metal]] objects.&lt;ref&gt;surveying by prof. Sk Duggal available on internet from Google books&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to denote amount of deviation of the needle from its normal position. It mostly causes errors in observations while [[surveying]] and thus suitable methods are employed to neglect these errors.&lt;ref&gt;Surveying by prof. Cl Kocher ,Principal of Mehar chand Polytechnic College, [[Jalandhar]] City, [[Punjab]]/Compass Surveying&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
The sources of local attraction may be natural or artificial. Natural sources include [[Iron ores]] or magnetic rocks while as artificial sources consist of steel structures, iron pipes, current carrying [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductors]]. The [[iron]] made [[surveying]] instruments such as metric chains, ranging rods and arrows should also be kept at a safe distance apart from [[compass]].&lt;ref&gt;surveying by Prof. Aftab Ahmad&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection==
Local attraction at a place can be detected by observing bearings from both ends of the line in the area. If fore bearing and back bearing of a line differ exactly by 180°, there is no local attraction at either station. But if this difference is not equal to 180°, then local attraction exists there either at one or both ends of the line.&lt;ref&gt;surveying by Prof. Cl Kocher&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two common methods of correcting observed bearings of the lines taken in the area affected by Local Attraction. The first method involves '''correcting the bearing with the help of corrected included angles''' and the second method involves correcting the '''bearing of traverse from one correct bearing''' ( in which difference between fore bearing and back bearing is exactly equal to 180°) by the process of distribution of error to other bearings.&lt;ref&gt;Surveying by Dr. Bc Punmia/Compass Surveying&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Looted art''' has been a consequence of [[looting]] during war, [[natural disaster]] and [[riot]] for centuries. Looting of [[art]], [[archaeology]] and other cultural property may be an opportunistic criminal act or may be a more organized case of [[Crime|unlawful]] or [[unethical]] pillage by the victor of a conflict.  The term "looted art" reflects bias, and whether particular art has been taken legally or illegally is often the subject of conflicting laws and subjective interpretations of governments and people; use of the term "looted art" in reference to a particular art object implies that the art was taken illegally.

Related terms include ''[[art theft]]'' (the stealing of valuable artifacts, mostly because of commercial reasons), ''[[illicit antiquities]]'' (covertly traded antiquities or artifacts of archaeological interest, found in illegal or unregulated excavations), ''[[provenance]]'' (the origin or source of a piece of art), and ''[[art repatriation]]'' (the process of returning artworks and antiques to their rightful owners).

Art [[looting]] has a long history, the winning party of armed conflicts often plundering the loser, and in the absence of social order, the local population often joining in. The contents of nearly all the tombs of the [[Pharaoh]]s were already completely looted by [[grave robber]]s before the invasion of Egypt by [[Alexander the Great]] in 332&amp;nbsp;BCE. There have been a total of seven [[Sack of Rome (disambiguation)|sackings of Rome]]. The [[Old Testament]] includes several references to looting and to the looting of art and treasures; in the [[Book of Chronicles]] it is said: "King [[Shishak]] of Egypt attacked Jerusalem and took away the treasures of the Lord's temple and of the royal palace; he took everything, including the gold shields that [[Solomon]] had made",&lt;ref&gt;2 Chronicles. Chapter. 12:9. The NET Bible, New English Translation Bible (1996). Biblical Studies Press, L.L.C.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Book of Jeremiah]] 15:11 [[The name of God in Judaism#In English|the Lord]] says: "Jerusalem, I will surely send you away for your own good. I will surely bring the enemy upon you in a time of trouble and distress ... I will give away your wealth and your treasures as plunder. I will give it away free of charge for the sins you have committed throughout your land."&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 15:11. The NET Bible, New English Translation Bible (1996). Biblical Studies Press, L.L.C.&lt;/ref&gt; Other famous examples include the Roman [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|Sack of Corinth]] in 146 BC, the Sack of  [[Constantinople]] by the [[Fourth Crusade]], the [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)|Sack of Baghdad in 1258]], [[Hernán Cortés]] and the looting of the [[Aztec]] gold. In only some of these was the removal of artworks for their own sake (rather than the value of their materials for example) a primary motivation.

Since the rise of an [[Illicit antiquities|art market]] for monumental sculpture, abandoned monuments all over the world have been at risk, notably in [[Iran]], the old territories of [[Mesoamerican culture]] and Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;Mydans, Seth. Raiders of Lost Art Loot Temples in Cambodia. New York Times, April 1, 1999,Section A, Page 4, Column 3, 1152 words&lt;/ref&gt;

After the looting of Europe by Napoleon, others copied the institutionalized model of systematic plunder and looting. During the [[American Civil War]], legal frameworks and guidelines emerged that justified and legalized the plunder and looting of opposing parties and nations. [[Henry Wager Halleck]], a United States Army officer, scholar, and lawyer argued: "No belligerent would be justifiable in destroying temples, tombs, statutes [sic], paintings, or other works of art (except so far as their destruction may be the accidental or necessary result of military operations.) But, may he not seize and appropriate to his own use such works of genius and taste as belong to the hostile state, and are of a moveable character?".&lt;ref&gt;Halleck. International law, or, Rules regulating the intercourse of states in peace and war. Ch. XIX, Sections 10–11. (1861)&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1862, [[Francis Lieber]], a professor at [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]], who had worked with Halleck on guidelines for guerrilla warfare, was asked by Halleck, now [[General-in-Chief]] of [[Union Army|armies of the Union]], to develop a code of conduct for the armed forces. The code of conduct, published as General Orders No. 100 on April 24, 1863, signed by United States President [[Abraham Lincoln]], later became known as the [[Lieber Code]]&lt;ref name=lieber&gt;Francis Lieber, LL.D. [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lieber.htm Instructions for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field]. Originally Issued as General Orders No. 100, Adjutant General's Office, 1863, Washington 1898: [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]]&lt;/ref&gt; and specifically authorized the Armies of the United States to plunder and loot the enemy – a mindset that Hitler's armies copied one century later. The Lieber Code said in Article 36: "If such works of art, libraries, collections, or instruments belonging to a hostile nation or government, can be removed without injury, the ruler of the conquering state or nation may order them to be seized and removed for the benefit of the said nation. The ultimate ownership is to be settled by the ensuing treaty of peace."&lt;ref&gt;Hartigan, Richard Shelly, ed. Lieber's Code and the Law of War. Chicago: Precedent, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Leon. The Law of War: A Documentary History. New York: Random House, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Russian and American forces relied on similar frameworks when they plundered Germany after the defeat of the [[Nazis]].&lt;ref name=ushmm&gt;United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Looted Art. http://www.ushmm.org/research/library/bibliography/index.php?content=looted_art&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lieber Code further defined the conditions of looting and the relationship between private plunder and booty and institutionalized looting "All captures and booty belong, according to the modern law of war, primarily to the government of the captor." (Article 45), "Neither officers nor soldiers are allowed to make use of their position or power in the hostile country for private gain, not even for commercial transactions otherwise legitimate." (Article 46) and "... [I]f large sums are found upon the persons of prisoners, or in their possession, they shall be taken from them, and the surplus, after providing for their own support, appropriated for the use of the army, under the direction of the commander, unless otherwise ordered by the government." (Article 72)&lt;ref name=lieber/&gt;

Massive art looting occurred during [[World War II]]; see [[art theft during World War II]].

==Looting of countries==

===Looting of Afghanistan===
Many art pieces and artifacts from Afghanistan were looted during several wars; scores of artworks were smuggled to Britain and sold to wealthy collectors. "There are also fears that the bulk of the collection once in [[Kabul Museum]], ... is now in smugglers' or collectors' hands. The most famous exhibits were the [[Begram ivories]], a series of exquisite Indian panels nearly 2,000 years old, excavated by French archaeologists in the Thirties (1930s)".&lt;ref&gt;Jason Burke. [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,450009,00.html Looted Afghan art smuggled to London]. [[The Observer]]. March 11, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2004, much of the missing collection numbering 22,513 items was found safely hidden. Over 200 crates had been moved downtown for storage at the end of the Soviet occupation including the Bactrian gold and Bagram Ivories.&lt;ref&gt;Carlotta Gall. [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/18/international/middleeast/18afghan.html Afghan Artifacts, Feared Lost, Are Discovered Safe in Storage]. [[New York Times]]. November 18, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Some 228 of these treasures, including pieces of Bactrian Gold and many of the Bagram Ivories, were exhibited at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., from May 25 to September 7, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/afghanistaninfo.shtm Hidden Treasures from the National Museum, Kabul].

===Looting of Cyprus===
Following the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974 by [[Turkey]] and the occupation of the northern part of the island, churches belonging to the [[Cypriot Orthodox Church]] have been looted in what is described as “one of the most systematic examples of the looting of art since World War II”.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;Morris, Chris. “Shame of Cyprus’s Looted Churches”. BBC News. 18 January 2002. Web. 9 February 2012. &lt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1768274.stm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1998"&gt;Miller, Judith, &amp; Stephen Kinzer. “Greek Orthodox Church Icons Ravaged in the Turkish Part of Cyprus”.

Most notable was the case of the Kanakaria mosaics, 6th-century AD frescos that were removed from the original church, trafficked to the US and offered for sale to a museum for the sum of US$20,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Litigators of the lost art – court orders return of Byzantine mosaics to their homeland|journal=Saturday Evening Post|date=October 1989|first=Steve|last=Mannheimer|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-7980763.html |accessdate=2007-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were subsequently recovered by the Orthodox Church following a court case in Indianapolis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Autocephalous Greek-Orthodox Church of Cyrprus v.

The northern part of the island is where the church and art looting was concentrated.&lt;ref name="byzantinefrescochapel1"&gt;“Cyprus History”. Byzantinefrescochapel.org. The Menil Collection. 2011. Web. 12 February 2012. &lt; http://www.byzantinefrescochapel.org/cyprus-history/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; It is rumored that the Turkish-Cypriot leaders did not feel an obligation to preserve the artifacts and monuments in the north because they felt that the Greek-Cypriot government had oppressed them for too long.&lt;ref name="nytimes1998"/&gt;

Archaeological sites, museums, churches, monasteries, castles, libraries, and private art collections have all been affected by the looting of the northern area of Cyprus; icons, frescoes, archaeological artifacts, and cultural heritage have been stripped from areas around the island and have been taken to places all over the world or simply destroyed.&lt;ref name="europesworld2007"&gt;Jansen, Michael. “The Pillage by Turkey of the 12,000 year old cultural heritage of Cyprus”.

====Non-Christian places of importance====

Many non-Christian sites have been affected by the looting and destruction of northern Cyprus. During the time of the invasion, work on archaeological sites was halted. While the projects on the Greek-Cypriot southern area were started again after a short period of delay, the projects in the Turkish north were never started again. Many of the houses and workshops associated with archaeological projects in the north were looted, so the work that had been done was lost to the researchers.&lt;ref name="Nicolaou, Kyriakos 1976"&gt;Nicolaou, Kyriakos. 1976. “Archaeological News from Cyprus, 1974”. American Journal of Archaeology, 80 (4):361-375.&lt;/ref&gt; Many areas on the island of Cyprus were damaged by bombing and machine gun fire, and because of these issues, the pavement mosaics of the House of Dionysos in Paphos suffered extensive damage. The fighting not only was destroying Byzantine and Christian cultural heritage, but it was even destroying culture that had been in existence for far longer. There have been appeals filed with UNESCO, ICOM, and ICOMOS to help with the preservation of the remaining cultural heritage on the island, and a representative of UNESCO was appointed to help by 1976.&lt;ref name="Nicolaou, Kyriakos 1976"/&gt;

====Looted religious sites and icons====

On the island of Cyprus before the invasion, the majority of the inhabitants were Greek-Cypriots, and for these citizens, the Greek Orthodox Church was and continues today to be central to their identity and faith.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"/&gt; In the north, there is a fear that Christianity is dying out because the churches and monasteries have been destroyed, transformed, or are falling into ruin. The northern Turkish inhabitants have transformed some former religious sites into mosques, army barracks, stables, night clubs and hotels, and it has been documented that only 3 churches and 1 monastery are currently in a dignified state out of the 520 churches and monasteries that were in the northern area of the country before the Turkish invasion.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;“Greek Orthodox Church sues Turkey Over Access to Religious Sites in Cyprus”. The Guardian. The Associated Press in Nicosia. 23 November 2009. Web. 9 February 2012. &lt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/nov/24/greek-orthodox-church-sues-turkey?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="repubblica2006"&gt;Magister, Sandro. ”Cyprus: Portrait of a Christianity Obliterated”. Chiesa News. Gruppo Editoriale L’Espresso Spa. 3 September 2006. Web. 9 February 2012. &lt;http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/46544?eng=y&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; At least 55 churches have been converted into mosques, while another 50 churches and monasteries have been converted into other structures to serve the Turkish-Cypriots’.&lt;ref name="cyprusnet2005"/&gt; A spokesman for the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus stated that the transformations of buildings happened because the buildings were falling into ruin, and he also stated that it is an Ottoman custom to transform buildings attributed to other religions into mosques; this idea can be linked to other Islamic sites, like the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, Israel.&lt;ref name="repubblica2006"/&gt;

Yannis Eliades, the director of the Byzantine Museum of Nicosia, has estimated that 25,000 icons have disappeared since the Turkish military initially invaded the island in 1974, while others estimate that between 15,000 and 20,000 icons are missing, along with dozens of frescoes and mosaics dating between the 6th and 15th centuries, thousands of chalices, wood carvings, crucifixes, and Bibles.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="repubblica2006"/&gt; However, there have been some case in which the Church of Cyprus was able to reclaim icons or mosaics, and this is a great step forward for the reformation of their cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"/&gt;

The transformations of religious sites have also spurred lawsuits from the few hundred Greek-Cypriots that are still living in the northern area. The Greek Orthodox Church has taken Turkey to the European Court of Human Rights because they were preventing practicing Christians from worshiping at previously religious, but currently transformed buildings. Even though the buildings have been destroyed or converted, the Greek-Cypriot citizens still want to be able to worship at these places to keep continuity with their faith without regard to the destruction.&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt;

Gruppo Editoriale L’Espresso Spa. 3 September 2006. Web. 9 February 2012. &lt;http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/46544?eng=y&gt;.

====Aydin Dikmen considered a key suspect====

Aydin Dikmen is a 60-year-old man who has been arrested in relation to the looting and selling of looted goods from the island of Cyprus. He had been suspected of being involved in the selling of looted art since 1982, but he kept a low profile and fell off the radar for some time.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt; His involvement was cemented when Peg Goldberg was sued by the Church of Cyprus in 1989 because she knew that she bought the mosaics from Dikmen; he claimed that he found the remains in the rubble of a church that had been forgotten and basically destroyed while he was working as an archaeologist in the northern part of Cyprus.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bourloyannis, M. Christiane 1992"&gt;Bourloyannis, M. Christiane, and Virginia Morris. 1992. “Autocephalous Greek-Orthodox Church of Cyprus v. Goldberg &amp; Feldman Fine Arts, Inc”. The American Journal of International Law, 86 (1): 128-133.&lt;/ref&gt; We also have documentation of another transaction where Dikmen worked with art collectors in the United States; Dominique de Menil, of the Menil Collection in Houston, Texas, bought two 13th-century frescoes from Dikmen on behalf of the Church of Cyprus in 1983.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt;

Those two previous cases are only two cases in which Dikmen’s presence has been suggested; he has been implicated in many more transactions, but those accusations have yet to be proven. However, in 1997, former colleagues of Dikmen helped the authorities arrest Dikmen and raid his many apartments. In these apartments, some of which Dikmen rented under false names and used as storage space, the authorities found a surplus of icons, frescoes, early Bibles, ancient pottery, statues, and coins from Cyprus. After learning of another residence of Dikmen’s, the authorities found 30 to 40 more crates filled with icons, frescoes, mosaics, and artifacts.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt; Also in one of the residences, the authorities found drawings containing information on how to cut out mosaics to keep the faces of the religious figures intact, while still taking the piece away from the original space; this shows how systematic and planned out the looting of the churches and monasteries was for Dikmen and his associates in the northern part of Cyprus.&lt;ref name="nytimes1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt; The organization and the intense planning involved brings up the issue of possible aid coming from Turkish authorities in the northern part of Cyprus; there are rumors that the government and military knew about the looting and chose to not do anything about it. This discomforting idea is continually straining the ties between Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus.&lt;ref name="nytimes1998"/&gt;

Since Dikmen’s arrest in 1998, the Antiphonitis frescoes and the Kanakarian mosaics have been returned to Cyprus, and soon the 13th-century frescoes currently housed by the Menil Collection in Houston will be returned to the island, as well.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="menil1"&gt;“The Menil Collection Celebrates Return of Byzantine Frescoes With Public Events Honoring Sacred Works”. Byzantine Fresco Chapel News. The Menil Collection. 30 January 2012. Web. 7 February 2012. &lt; http://www.menil.org/documents/MenilCelebratesReturnofByzantineFrescoeswithPublicEventsHonoringSacredWorks.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The search for the looted art of Cyprus continues, and there seems to be more and more evidence of Dikmen’s presence in other transactions of international looted art. Many think that Dikmen is just a middle man who is working on behalf of more knowledgeable and rich patrons, but the mystery is still not solved. Hopefully the truth will be discovered in the future, and these beautiful artifacts, icons, mosaics, and frescoes can be returned to Cyprus to enhance their cultural heritage and identity.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt;

====Cases of repatriation====

=====The Menil Collection and 13th-century frescoes=====
One case of repatriation for the Church of Cyprus is associated with the Menil Collection, based in Houston, Texas.&lt;ref name="artdaily1"&gt;Hadjicostis, Menalaos. “Cyprus to get back rare 13th-century Orthodox frescoes from United States Museum”.

Web. 7 February 2012. http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=2&amp;int_new=50679&amp;int_modo=2&lt;/ref&gt; De Menil bought the frescoes on behalf of the Church of Cyprus, with whom she made an agreement to exhibit the frescoes in a purpose-built chapel until 2012; the collection offered to keep the frescoes longer, but the Archbishop of Cyprus has instead agreed to have an iconographer recreate the frescoes on the Houston chapel’s dome and apse and give the Houston chapel a 19th- and a 20th-century icon in return for the safekeeping of the 13th-century icons.&lt;ref name="artdaily1"/&gt;

The original Cypriot chapel in the Ayios Themomianos Church in the northern part of Cyprus was a small limestone structure, with a central dome and pointed barrel vaults; the original was mostly used for prayer because of its small size.&lt;ref&gt;“Byzantine Frescoes: Origins”. Byzantinefrescochapel.org. The Menil Collection. 2011. Web. 7 February 2012. &lt; http://www.byzantinefrescochapel.org/origins/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; When the de Menil collection was granted temporary possession of the frescoes, they constructed a chapel to house the frescoes and keep them safe. This specially built chapel was designed by De Menil’s husband, François de Menil, who studied traditional Byzantine architecture and spatial arrangement from the original chapel at Lysi; the layout and the placement of the mosaics mirrors the arrangement from the original chapel.&lt;ref name="byzantinefrescochapel3"&gt;“The Byzantine Fresco Chapel: Architecture”. Byzantinefrescochapel.org. The Menil Collection. 2011. Web. 7 February 2012. &lt; http://www.byzantinefrescochapel.org/architecture/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The interior of the chapel has black walls which are illuminated to create a sense of vastness and infinity; the black walls help to focus the attention of the viewer on the frescoes and create a divine experience for the viewer.&lt;ref name="byzantinefrescochapel3"/&gt;

=====Boy George and the Gold Icon of Christ=====

However, it will not be going back to the original Church in the northern part of Cyprus; it is being held in Brussels, Belgium, and it will return to Cyprus at a later date when The Church of Cyprus has an appropriate space in which it can be stored.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theartnewspaper1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artdaily3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian2"/&gt; This case has contributed to the Church of Cyprus and their efforts to repatriate “stolen spiritual treasures” that have come from their homeland of Cyprus.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

=====Peg Goldberg and the Kankarian mosaics=====
This case study outlines the events that occurred in 1989 between Peg Goldberg, a local art dealer in Indianapolis, Indiana, and the Church of Cyprus when Goldberg gained “ownership” and then tried to sell Cypriot mosaics from the 6th century. These mosaics have been looted from the Church of the Virgin of Kankaria in the village of Lythrangomi in Northern Cyprus after surviving the 8th and 9th century.&lt;ref name="cyprusnet2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="europesworld2007"/&gt; These mosaics had survived the 8th- and 9th-century iconoclasm in the Byzantine world and were considered to be finer than other mosaics, even the mosaics found in Ravenna, Italy and the mosaics in St. Catherine’s monastery in Sinai.&lt;ref name="europesworld2007"/&gt; The Kankarian mosaics were cut into pieces when they were looted from the original church, and Peg Goldberg was able to purchase four segments of these early mosaics from Aydin Dikmen. These mosaics are important to the cultural, artistic, and religious heritage of Cyprus because they are some of the few remaining Byzantine mosaics from the island; when and how these mosaics were taken from Cyprus is unknown because there is documentation to show that they were still intact in 1976, two years after the initial invasion by the Turkish troops.&lt;ref name="europesworld2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bourloyannis, M. Christiane 1992"/&gt;

These mosaics first came into the view of the Church of Cyprus when Goldberg approached the Getty Museum to purchase the mosaic pieces. The Getty Museum recognized them as the lost Kankarian mosaics and informed Cyprus that they were in the United States. Shortly afterward, the Church of Cyprus filed a claim at the district court to try to reclaim the mosaics.&lt;ref name="Bourloyannis, M. Christiane 1992"/&gt; The federal court in Indiana made a verdict in favor of the Church of Cyprus, and the mosaics were returned in 1991 to the Byzantine Museum in Nicosia, Cyprus.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt; The verdict showed that Goldberg could not own the pieces because Dikmen had stolen the mosaics and had no right to pass on the ownership of the stolen mosaics. Goldberg stated that the pieces had been bought “in good faith” from a “Turkish antiquities dealer” who found the mosaics in an abandoned church, but the judge ruled that not looking into the background and workings of the dealer was unacceptable because it was her responsibility to look into the people she was working with.&lt;ref name="europesworld2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bourloyannis, M. Christiane 1992"/&gt; This case called in the multilateral treaty of the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, which calls for all available parties to help recover and return items that have been requested by the country of origin; using this international decree helped to show the importance of these artifacts which needed to be sent to their home land of Cyprus.&lt;ref name="Bourloyannis, M. Christiane 1992"/&gt; People have been happy with this verdict for the Kankarian case because they want others to realize that cultural heritage of the world is not for sale, and hopefully discourage further selling of looted art in the international market.&lt;ref name="nytimes1990"&gt;[[William H. Honan|Honan, William H]]. “Art Dealer Told Again to Return Mosaics”. Arts. The New York Times. 26 Oct 1990. Web. 1 March 2012. &lt; https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/26/arts/art-dealer-told-again-to-return-mosaics.html?emc=eta1&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mosaic pieces that were involved in the Kankarian case have four different religious images. They depict Jesus as a young boy, the archangel Michael, Matthew and James; the final two are images of apostles from the 1st century.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bourloyannis, M. Christiane 1992"/&gt; The mosaics were named after the Church in which they were placed originally around 530.&lt;ref name="nytimes1990"/&gt; These mosaics have fallen into destruction because of the damage that they experienced through the process of removal from the church, shipping around the world, and during the restoration work that Goldberg commissioned. It is unlikely that these mosaics will ever be reinstalled in their original home, even if there are changes in the political situation on Cyprus, because they would most likely not make it through the re-installation process in the state that they are currently in.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt;

===Looting of Germany===
After World War II, Germany was looted by Allied and Soviet forces; the systematic pillaging and looting by the Allies (particularly the [[Soviet Union]]) is still causing disputes and conflicts between Germany, Russia and the United States, as many of the objects have never been returned to Germany.

August 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin's State Museum alone lost around 400 artworks during World War II. The German state (Land) of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] still maintains a list entitled ''Beutekunst'' ("Looted Art") of more than 1000 missing paintings and books believed confiscated by the US or the Soviet Union.

[[Poland]] is also in possession of some collections that Germany evacuated to remote places in Eastern Germany (the [[Recovered Territories]] that are part of Poland since 1945) as well as in [[occupied Poland]]. Among those there is a large collection from Berlin, which in Polish referred to as ''[[Berlinka (art collection)|Berlinka]]''. Another notable collection in Polish possession is [[Hermann Göring]]'s collection of 25 historic airplanes (''Deutsche Luftfahrt Sammlung'') – ironically, it contains two Polish planes captured by Germans during their invasion of Poland (including a [[PZL P-11c]] of [[Army Kraków]]).&lt;ref name="GW2007"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://serwisy.gazeta.pl/swiat/1,34239,4554829.html Rosjanie oddają skradzione dzieła sztuki], Gazeta Wyborcza, 2007-10-14&lt;/ref&gt; Poland refuses to return those collections to Germany unless Germany returns some of the collections looted in Poland and still in its possession in exchange.&lt;ref name="GW2007"/&gt;

Entire libraries and archives with files from all over Europe were looted and their files taken to Russia by the Soviet Trophy Brigades. The [[Russian State Military Archive]] (Rossiiskii Gosudarstvenni Voennyi Arkhiv- RGVA) still contains a large number of files of foreign origin, including papers relating to Jewish organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Russian State Military Archive]] (Rossiiskii Gosudarstvenni Voennyi Arkhiv – RGVA).

The gallery had photographed the picture by [[Alessandro Allori]] (1535–1607) before closing down and, in 1939, putting its collection in secure storage areas, which Soviet troops broke into at the war's end. Wheeler covered the process in ''It's My Story: Looted Art'' for [[BBC Radio 4]], contacting the Commission for Looted Art, the identification of the painting's rightful owner in Germany and the hand-over in Berlin. On May 31, 2006, the commission, the [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]], representing the Berlin state museums, announced the return of the painting.&lt;ref name=guardianlooted/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commission for Looted Art in Europe.

The reasons for the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] looting of Germany and the subsequent Russian attempts are revealed in an interview that Irina Antonova gave to the German ''[[Die Welt]]'' newspaper; the interview specifically focuses on the Russian notion of looting, using the historical example of Napoleon as a direct reference for the Russian justification of the Plunder of Germany: "Three quarters of all the Italian art in the Louvre came to Paris with Napoleon. We all know this, yet the works remain in the Louvre. I know the place where Veronese's large painting used to hang in the monastery of Vicenza. Now it's in the Louvre where it will stay.

After the U.S. troops entered Baghdad on April 9, 2003, at least 13,000 artifacts were stolen during the looting by Iraqis,&lt;ref name=knickmeyer&gt;Ellen Knickmeyer.

August 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; including many moved from other sites into the National Museum for safekeeping. U.S. troops and tanks were stationed in that area but, concerned with defending themselves from attack and without orders to stop the looting, "watched for several days before moving against the thieves."&lt;ref name=knickmeyer/&gt; Sergeant Jackson of the 1st Marine Battalion explained that "...our orders were to avoid engaging religious Muslims who were unarmed. So when groups of Imams demanded to remove religious items to prevent them from being defiled by the infidels, how were we supposed to know that they were thieves? Our captain didn't want to create an international incident by arresting religious leaders."

''The Boston Globe'' writes: "Armies not of fighters but of looters, capitalizing on a security vacuum after war, have pillaged Babylon." Donny George, the curator of Iraq's National Museum says about the art looting: {{Centered pull quote|"It's the crime of the century because it affects the heritage of all mankind."&lt;ref name=thanassis&gt;Thanassis Cambanis and Charles M. Sennott. Looters Pillage Babylon Leaving Iraqis, Archeologists Devastated. The Boston Globe Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News. April 21, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; }}

George's comments followed widespread reporting that 100 percent of the museum's 170,000 inventoried lots (about 501,000 pieces) had been removed by Iraqi looters. In fact, about 95 percent of the museum's contents never left the museum. According to investigators of the thefts, about two percent of the museum pieces were stored elsewhere for safekeeping. Another two percent were stolen, in an apparent "inside job", just before U.S. troops arrived; about one percent, or about 5,000 items, were taken by outside looters. Most of the looted items were tiny beads and amulets.

The horror of art looting in general is made clear by Hashem Hama Abdoulah, director of the museum of antiquities in Sulaymaniyah, in the Kurdish-controlled zone of northern Iraq. {{Centered pull quote|"When your history is stolen from you, you lose your sense of that history. Not just the Iraqi people, but all of civilization that can trace its roots back to this area."&lt;ref name=thanassis/&gt;}}

Despite public announcements and temporary efforts by the Iraqi and American administrations, the situation in Iraqi Museums and archaeological sites did not improve. [[Donny George]], the curator of Iraq's National Museum, the first person who raised his voice and alarmed the world about the looting in Iraq after the American invasion and publicly stated his opinion about the "ongoing failure of Iraqi leaders and the American military to protect the sites",&lt;ref name=knickmeyer/&gt; left the country and resigned in August 2006. Before he left, he closed and sealed the museum and plugged the doors with concrete.&lt;ref name=knickmeyer/&gt; In an article in ''[[Newsweek]]'', he even said that the stolen items should not be returned to Iraq under the given circumstances: "We believe this is not the right time now to have them back. Since we know all about them and are promised them back whenever we want them, it is better to keep them in these countries."&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7169977/site/newsweek/ The Last Word: Donny George.

===Looting of Italy===
The looting of Italian art was not limited to Napoleon alone; Italian criminals have long been, and remain, extremely active in the field, and Italy's battle to recover the antiquities it says were looted from the country and sold to museums and art collectors worldwide is still ongoing. The Italian government and the [[Carabinieri Art Squad|Art Squad]] of the [[Carabinieri]], Italy's national police force, made special efforts to "[crack] the network of looters, smugglers, and dealers supplying American museums," collecting "mountains of evidence—thousands of antiquities, photographs, and documents—seized from looters and dealers in a series of dramatic raids." According to the BBC, Italian authorities have for several years insisted on the return of stolen or looted artworks from wealthy museums and collectors, particularly in America.&lt;ref name=bbcgetty&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/273618.stm Getty Museum returns stolen art]. BBC. February 6, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Italy has successfully fought numerous lawsuits that have resulted in the repatriation of many items of looted art and antiquities from many famous American institutions, including the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] in Los Angeles, the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]], the [[Princeton Museum of Art]], the [[Toledo Museum of Art]], and the private collection of [[Leon Levy]] and his wife, [[Shelby White]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/0607/abstracts/raiders.html Raiding the Tomb Raiders]. [[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]. Volume 59 Number 4, July/August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

As the result of lawsuits filed by the Italian and Turkish governments, as well as the work of investigative journalist [[Peter Watson (intellectual historian)|Peter Watson]] and archaeologist [[Vernon Silver]], both the Metropolitan Museum and the J. Paul Getty Museum have been repeatedly exposed as two of the world's biggest institutional recipients of looted and stolen Mediterranean artefacts, and the museums benefited from the illegal antiquities trade, both through direct acquisition, and via donations and bequests from major private collectors. A significant number of Met and Getty acquisitions over a period of at least 40 years were everntually shown to have been sourced from a major international illegal antiquities trading network that centred on Italian art dealer [[Giacomo Medici (art dealer)|Giacomo Medici]]. From the late 1960s, Medici rose to become the central figure in  a large criminal conspiracy, acting as the middleman between gangs of ''tombaroli'' (tomb robbers) - who systematically looted tens of thousands of important artefacts from Italian and other Mediterranean archaeological sites, as well as stealing objects from museums, churches and private collections - and an elite group of American and British dealers who helped Medici to "launder" his contraband and sell it to major buyers like the Met, the Getty and leading American private collectors.

Medici typically paid the ''tombaroli'' small sums for the looted and stolen goods, and then smuggled them out of Italy to Switzerland, where they were restored. Taking advantage of the lax attitudes and practices of 'cooperative' auction houses - notably Sotheby's in London - Medici built up an elaborate network of front companies and elite antiquities dealers and galleries, including the British dealer [[Robin Symes]], Rome-based American dealer [[Robert E. Hecht]], and Hollywood dealer and producer [[Bruce McNall]]. A major investigation by the TPC (the art crimes division of the [[Carabinieri]]) beginning in the 1990s, which eventually resulted in Medici's conviction, recovered tens of thousands of looted artefacts, and extensive documentary evidence, including thousands of sequential photographs that showed the journey of these looted objects from excavation, through restoration, to their final placement in museum collections, as well as a crucial handwritten 'organigram' (organisational chart) that named and linked all the members of Medici's operation. TPC investigations also revealed that Medici used front companies to anonymously sell and then buy back many items, often multiple times, in order to manipulate the market, as well as allowing him to acquire the all-important Sotheby's provenances. In February 2016, TPC officials announced that a raid on Robin Symes' warehouse in the Geneva Freeport had uncovered a huge collection of 17,000 looted antiquities, nearly all of which are thought to have been sourced from Medici, and which Symes secretly placed there ca. 2000 in order to conceal their existence from the executors of the estate of his former lover and business partner, Christo Michelaides, who died in 1999.

[[File:Euphronios krater side B MET L.2006.10.jpg|right|thumb|[[Euphronios krater]], a 2,500-year-old Greek vase, stolen from an Etruscan tomb and smuggled from Italy, returned to Italy by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2006]]

In 2006, the Metropolitan Museum of Art finally agreed to relinquish ownership of a 2,500-year-old Greek vase known as the [[Euphronios krater]], a [[krater]] painted by [[Euphronios]], after the TPC was able to establish that the object had been looted from an Etruscan tomb and smuggled out of Italy by the Medici gang. The Met also surrendered 15 pieces of Sicilian silver and four ancient vessels in exchange for long-term loans of other antiquities. According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', the case, "of its kind, perhaps second only to the dispute between Greece and Great Britain over the Elgin marbles," "became emblematic of the ethical questions surrounding the acquisition of ancient art by major museums."&lt;ref&gt;Randy Kennedy and Hugh Eakin.

The Metropolitan Museum has been involved in several other major controversies involving antiquities believed or proven to have been looted or stolen, including:

* the [[Cloisters Cross]], a large [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] cross carved from walrus ivory, said to have been carved in England, but possibly made in Germany. It was initially offered to the [[British Museum]] in 1961 by its then owner, a shady Yugoslav 'collector' called [[Ante Topić Mimara]], who is now widely believed to have acquired as part of a huge collection of art and antiquities that he stole at the end of WWII from the Central Collecting Point in Munich, the Allied clearinghouse for the repatriation of material looted by the Nazis. The British Museum eventually declined to buy the cross because Topić Mimara would not provide proof that he had full title to the object, but immediately after the British Museum's option expired in 1963, the cross was purchased for the Met by curator [[Thomas Hoving]] for GBP£200,000. The Cross is currently still in the collection of the Met, at its [[Cloisters Museum]] annexe.&lt;ref name="Peter Watson 2007 pp.133-146"&gt;Peter Watson; Cecilia Todeschini (2007), ''The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities from Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums'' (Public Affairs, NY), pp.133-146&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Karun Treasure]], also known as the Lydian Hoard, is a fabulous collection of 200 gold, silver, bronze and earthenware objects, dating from the 7th Century BCE. It formed part of a larger haul of some 450 objects that were looted by local tomb robbers from ancient four royal tombs near [[Sardis]], in Turkey in 1966-67. The contents of the tombs, including painted pieces of the walls, were stripped and sold (via Swiss and American middlemen) to the Metropolitan Museum between 1966 and 1970 for a total of US$1.5 million, but they were kept hidden in storage for more than 20 years. The Treasure was eventually put on display in 1984 in a major exhibition, where it was seen by Turkish journalist Özgen Acar, who had been investigating the looting of the tombs for many years. Although the Met intentionally mislabeled the objects as part of an “East Greek treasure,” Acar immediately recognised them as the Lydian artefacts, from the descriptions he had been given by the looters. He alerted the Turkish government, and in 1986, they officially requested the hoard be returned. The Met refused, so Turkey began legal action to recover it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21761 The History Blog: "Gold hippocampus from Lydian Hoard found" (posted 28 November 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; After a six-year legal battle which reportedly cost the Turkish government UK£25 million&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/25/king-croesus-treasure-returning-turkey Constanze Letch, "King Croesus's golden brooch to be returned to Turkey", ''The Guardian'', 26 November 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; the case ended dramatically after the minutes of the Met's own acquisition committee revealed that a curator had actually visited the looted burial mounds in Turkey to confirm the authenticity of the objects. The Met was forced to concede that staff had known the objects were stolen when it bought them, and the collection was repatriated to Turkey in 1993.&lt;ref name="Peter Watson 2007 pp.133-146"/&gt;
* the [[Morgantina treasure]], a 16-piece hoard of 3rd century BCE Roman silver, valued at US$100 million. Acquired in the early 1980s, it was later shown to have been looted from an important archaeological site in Morgantina, Sicily. After another protracted law suit, the Met was also forced to relinquish the treasure, and it was repatriated to Sicily in 2010.&lt;ref name="Peter Watson 2007 pp.133-146"/&gt;&lt;ref name=povoledo/&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]'', a publication of the [[Archaeological Institute of America]], investigative journalist [[Peter Watson (intellectual historian)|Peter Watson]] wrote in June 2006 that according to the Italian public prosecutor [[Paolo Ferri]], 100,000 tombs have been looted in Italy alone, representing a value of US$500 million. He estimates that the overall monetary value of looted art, including Greece, Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Cyprus, West Africa, Central America, Peru, and China, is at least four times the Italian figure.&lt;ref name=archaeologyexposing&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/online/interviews/watson.html Exposing the Culture Thieves].

The aforementioned institutions have agreed to hand over the artworks in exchange for loans of other treasures.

In 2005 [[Marion True]], former curator of the Getty Museum, and art dealer [[Robert E.

June 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence against both emerged in a 1995 raid of a [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], warehouse that contained many stolen artifacts.

The warehouses were registered to a Swiss company called Editions Services, which police traced to an Italian art dealer, [[Giacomo Medici (art dealer)|Giacomo Medici]].

===Looting of South East Asia===

During their occupation of Indochina, the French government removed various statues and other objects from the region. During its existence, the Khmer Empire was regularly raided by its neighbours, which resulted in its cultural heritage being distributed widely across the region.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Palmer. ''Ancient Khmer Empire''&lt;/ref&gt; The major historian of the Khmer Empire, Lawrence Palmer Briggs, regularly mentions these raids—for example, the sack of Angkor in 1430–31 by the Siamese who carried off their loot to [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]],&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Palmer. ''The Ancient Khmer Empire'', p258&lt;/ref&gt; after which "people fled from the 'great and glorious capital' of Khmer civilisation as if it were ridden with plague".&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Palmer. ''The Ancient Khmer Empire'', p261&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the cultural heritage of the region was already widely spread by the time the French founded their protectorate in IndoChina in 1864. Briggs describes [[Preah Khan Kompong Svay]] as "shamefully looted" in the late 19th century by [[Louis Delaporte]], "who carried the spoils away to French museums (thus beginning the systematic looting of Cambodian temples for the benefit of public and private collections of Europe and America)".&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Palmer. ''The Ancient Khmer Empire'', p 222&lt;/ref&gt; He also describes how French tourists well into the 20th century carried off many statues.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Palmer. ''The Ancient Khmer Empire'', p77&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, by the early 20th century it was rare to find Khmer objects in situ{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} and local and foreign collectors, particularly in France, had built up collections of Khmer objects. Many objects from the region were exported to Europe and elsewhere and ended up in museums such as the Guimet.&lt;ref&gt;http://asemus.museum/museum/musee-national-des-arts-asiatiques-guimet/&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second world war, whilst France was occupied by Nazi Germany, the Indochina region was controlled variously by the Japanese, locally, and after the war, the French regained control. There followed a period of 35 years of disruption and warfare, including Dien Ben Phu and the Vietnam war. Thereafter Cambodia fell under the control of the notorious Khmer Rouge regime. Some objects left the country during that period, either to save them from destruction or for looting purposes. Reports have suggested that where objects have been moved, local officials and armed forces (both before and after the periods of turmoil) were responsible.&lt;ref&gt;see movie Angkor for Sale directed Adrian Maben 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, a report in ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' described art experts' concerns about a "rampant degradation of archeological sites and an accelerating trade in stolen artifacts sweeping Southeast Asia" as a consequence of war in Cambodia and instability in the region.&lt;ref name="Tefft"&gt;Tefft, Sheila.

The British-born Thai-based collector [[Douglas Latchford]] says that when he and other collectors traversed Cambodia and Thailand in the 1960s, buying and trading Cambodian antiquities, they were not concerned about provenance, but regarded themselves as rescuers of artefacts that otherwise might have been neglected or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Mashberg, Tom, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/13/arts/design/us-links-collector-to-statue-in-khmer-looting-case.html?_r=0 "Claims of Looting Shadow Expert in Khmer Art"], ''The New York Times'', 12 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the objects they purchased were later donated or sold to museums. In the 2000s, evidence that the artefacts had been looted persuaded a number of major museums around the world to return the objects to Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;"In 2012, Latchford was identified in [US] federal court records as a middleman in the trafficking of looted antiquities from Sotheast Asia. Authorities allege Latchford knowingly purchased two looted Khmer sculptures from “an organized looting network” and conspired with the London auction house Spink to obtain false export permits for them. The case was a civil lawsuit, and Latchford was not charged with a crime. But after a lengthy legal battle, Sotheby’s agreed to return its sculpture to Cambodia. Soon after, the Norton Simon Museum, Christie’s auction house and the Metropolitan Museum of Art all returned sculptures tied to Latchford."

Among the objects sold or donated to major museums by Latchford are a number of rare ancient [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] statues, reportedly looted from the temple site of [[Koh Ker]] in Cambodia, and at least two Indian seated [[Kushan]] Buddhas, looted from the ancient Indian city of [[Mathura]]. One of the seated Buddhas was originally offered—via Manhattan dealer [[Nancy Wiener]]—to Canada's [[Royal Ontario Museum]], but they ultimately declined to buy it, owing to its dubious provenance. In 2000 it was bought by the [[National Gallery of Australia]], but subsequent investigations exposed the seated Buddha as a looted artwork, and it has since been repatriated to India. Other US museums reported to have received looted Asian artefacts from Latchford include the [[Denver Museum of Art]], the [[Kimbell Museum]] in Ft. Worth, Texas, and the [[Norton Simon Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://chasingaphrodite.com/2013/05/03/breaking-the-met-returns-two-khmer-statues-to-cambodia-citing-clear-evidence-of-looting/ Chasing Aphrodite: "The Met Returns Two Khmer Statues to Cambodia, Citing Clear Evidence Of Looting" (posted 3 May 2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] voluntarily returned to Cambodia a 10th-century sculpture of the Hindu monkey god [[Hanuman]], after a curator from the museum uncovered evidence that it had been looted—the statue's head having appeared on the market in Bangkok in 1968 during the [[Vietnam War]] and its body having appeared on the market in 1972 during the [[Cambodian Civil War]]. The museum's director said, "Our research revealed a very real likelihood that it was removed from a site enormously important to the kingdom of Cambodia during a terrible time and its return was completely consistent with the highest legal and fiduciary standards."&lt;ref&gt;Litt, Steven.

The [[Załuski Library]], the first public library in Poland, was founded by two brothers, [[Józef Andrzej Załuski]], crown referendary and bishop of Kiev, and [[Andrzej Stanisław Załuski]], crown chancellor and bishop of Cracow. The library was considered one of the most important libraries of the world, featuring a collection of about 400,000 printed items, manuscripts, artworks, scientific instruments, and plant and animal specimens. Located in Warsaw's [[Daniłowiczowski Palace]], it was looted in the aftermath of the [[second Partition of Poland]] and [[Kościuszko Uprising]] in 1794 by [[Russia]]n troops on orders from Russian Tsarina [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]]; the stolen artworks were transported to [[St. Petersburg]] and became part of the [[Russian Imperial Library]], which was founded one year later. Although some pieces were returned by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1921 and were burned during the [[Warsaw Uprising]] against German forces, other parts of the collection have still not been returned by Russia. Polish scientists have been allowed to access and study the objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warsawvoice.pl/archiwum.phtml/7723/ What's On. Library Anniversary]. [[The Warsaw Voice]].

Looting in Mesoamerica has a long tradition and history. Graves are often looted before the archaeologists can reach them, and the artifacts are then sold to wealthy collectors in the United States, Japan, or Europe. Guillermo Cock, a Lima-based archaeologist, says about a recent find of dozens of exquisitely preserved Inca mummies on the outskirts of Peru's capital city, [[Lima]]: "The true problem is the looters," he said. "If we leave the cemetery it is going to be destroyed in a few weeks."&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;John Roach.

==Looting by perpetrator==

===Looting by the British Empire===

The transformation of theft and plunder as an incentive for troops to institutionalized, indiscriminate looting following military conflict can be observed in the wake of British conquest in Asia, Africa and India. The looting of artifacts for "both personal and institutional reasons" became "increasingly important in the process of "othering" Oriental and African societies and was exemplified in the professionalism of exploration and the growth of ethnographic departments in museums, the new 'temples of Empire'." Looting, not necessarily of art, became a vital instrument for the projection of power and the British imperial desire to gather and provide information about the "exotic" cultures and primitive tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Carrington.

===Looting by Napoleon===
[[File:Descent from the Cross (Rembrant).jpg|thumb|[[Rembrandt]]'s ''Descent from the Cross'' was looted in 1806 by French soldiers from the [[Landgrave]] of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]], Germany; current location: [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], St. Petersburg.]]

Napoleon's conquests in Europe were followed by a systematic attempt, later more tentatively echoed by Hitler, to take the finest works of art of conquered nations back to the [[Louvre]] in Paris for a grand central museum of all Europe. Napoleon boasted: {{Centered pull quote|We will now have all that is beautiful in Italy except for a few objects in Turin and Naples.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;}}
Many works were returned after his fall, but many others were not, and remain in France. Many works confiscated from religious institutions under the French occupation now form the backbone of national museums: "Napoleon's art-loot depots became the foundation of [[Gallerie dell'Accademia|Venice's Accademia]], Milan's [[Pinacoteca di Brera|Brera galleries]]. His brother [[Napoleon III of France|Louis]] founded [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam|Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum]]; brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] started [[Museo del Prado|Madrid's Prado]]" (for the Spanish royal collection).&lt;ref name=time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,891933-1,00.html Masterpieces of the Louvre]. ''Time'' magazine. June 30, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleonic commander and Marechal [[Nicolas Jean-de-Dieu Soult]] stole in 1810 six large pictures painted by [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] in 1668 for the [[Hospital de la Caridad (Seville)|Hospital de la Caridad]] in [[Seville]]. One painting, ''[[The Return of the Prodigal Son]]'', is now in the [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington; a second looted painting, ''[[The Healing of the Paralytic]]'', is in the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] in London; only two of the original paintings have returned to Seville.&lt;ref name=bloombergplease/&gt;

Another French general looted several pictures, including four Claudes and [[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[Descent from the Cross]]'', from the [[Landgrave]] of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] in 1806. The stolen goods were later bought by the [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Empress Josephine]] and subsequently by the tsar. Since 1918, when the [[Bolshevik]] government signed a peace treaty with Germany and Austria, have German negotiators demanded the return of the paintings. Russia refused to return the stolen goods; the pictures still remain in the Hermitage.&lt;ref name=bloombergplease/&gt;

===Looting by the Union and Confederate Armies during the American Civil War===

On November 7, 1863, [[Edward D. Townsend]] of the Union army wrote General Order No. 360: “Satisfactory evidence having been produced to the War Department that a bronze equestrian statue, unlawfully taken from a private house in Fredericksburg, at the time of the capture of that place by the Union forces, was the private property of Mr. Douglas Gordon, of that city, it is— .Ordered: That it be restored to Mrs. Annie C. Thomas, the sister of Mr. Gordon, who has made application therefor.”&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Thomas M., and Oliver Diefendorf. ''General Orders of the War Department, Embracing the Years 1861, 1862 &amp; 1863''. Vol. 2. New York, NY: Derby &amp; Miller, 1864, p. 603.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Gordon's works of art were recovered through [[Lafayette C. Baker]], chief of the Union secret police.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Lafayette Curry. ''History of the United States Secret Service''. Philadelphia, PA: King &amp; Baird, Printers, 1867, p. 259-260.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Congress enacted legislation allowing for claims to be filed for property losses on July 4, 1864. Claims were restricted to loyal citizens.

The legal framework and the language of the instructions used by Germany resembles the [[Lieber Code]], but in the [[Nuremberg Trial]] proceedings, the victorious Allied armies applied different standards and sentenced the Nazis involved as [[war criminals]]. Article 6 of the [[Charter of the International Military Tribunal]] of Nuremberg, detailing the Jurisdiction and General Principles, declares the "plunder of public or private property" a war crime,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/proc/imtconst.htm#art6 Nuremberg Trial Proceedings Vol. 1, Charter of the International Military Tribunal, II. Jurisdiction and General Principles, Article 6]. Yale.edu. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; while the Lieber Code and the actions of the Allied armies in the aftermath of World War II allowed or tolerated the looting. The main objective of the looting is made clear by Dr. Muhlmann, responsible for the securing of all Polish art treasures: "I confirm that the art treasures ... would not have remained in Poland in case of a German victory, but they would have been used to complement German artistic property."&lt;ref name=nuremberg&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/proc/12-18-45.htm Nuremberg Trial Proceedings Vol. 4.

One inventory of 39 volumes featuring the looted art and antiques, prepared by the Nazis and discussed during the Nuremberg trials, lists "21,903 Works of Art: 5,281 paintings, pastels, water colors, drawings; 684 miniatures, glass and enamel paintings, illuminated books and manuscripts; 583 sculptures, terra cottas, medallions, and plaques; 2,477 articles of furniture of art historical value; 583 textiles (tapestries, rugs, embroideries, Coptic textiles); 5,825 objects of decorative art (porcelains, bronzes, [[faience]], [[Maiolica|majolica]], ceramics, jewelry, coins, art objects with precious stones); 1,286 East Asiatic art works (bronzes, sculpture, [[porcelain]]s, paintings, [[folding screen]]s, weapons); 259 art works of antiquity (sculptures, bronzes, vases, jewelry, bowls, [[engraved gem]]s, [[terracotta]]s)."&lt;ref name=nuremberg/&gt;

In 1998, and after considerable controversy, Russia passed the [[Federal Law on Cultural Valuables Displaced to the USSR as a Result of the Second World War and Located on the Territory of the Russian Federation]], which allowed Russians to keep the illegally stolen art works and museum pieces and to prevent any restitution to their rightful owners in Germany.

===Looting by the Spanish Empire and others===
The [[conquistador]]s looting Latin and South America became one of the most commonly recognized plunders in the world.

Roger Atwood writes in ''Stealing History: Tomb Raiders, Smugglers, and the Looting of the Ancient World'': "Mayan stonework became one of those things that good art museums in America just had to have, and looters in the jungles of southern Mexico and Guatemala worked overtime to meet the demand."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; (See: [[Maya stelae#Looting]])

Looting in Mesoamerica has a long tradition and history, many graves are looted before the archaeologists could reach them, and the artifacts are then sold to wealthy collectors in the United States, Japan or Europe. [[Guillermo Cock]], a Lima-based archaeologist, says about a recent find of dozens of exquisitely preserved Inca mummies on the outskirts of Peru's capital city, [[Lima]]: "The true problem is the looters," he said. "If we leave the cemetery it is going to be destroyed in a few weeks."&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

==Case studies==
A large number of institutions and museums have at various times been subject to both moral claims and legal claims concerning the provenance of their holdings subject to occasional review and challenge. One example of such a case study can be provided by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'s reputation which has experienced a series of allegations and lawsuits about its status as an occasional institutional buyer of looted and stolen antiquities. Since the 1990s the Met has been the subject of numerous investigative reports and books critical of the Met's ''laissez-faire'' attitude to acquisition.&lt;ref name=IllicitTombRaiders&gt;Peter Watson, Cecilia Todeschini (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=jlcPcCuicKQC&amp;q=Morgantina%20Met%20OR%20Metropolitan ''The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities from Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vernon Silver, ''The Lost Chalice: The Epic Hunt for a Priceless Masterpiece''. Harper Collins Books, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-06-188296-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Met has lost several major lawsuits, notably against the governments of Italy and Turkey, who successfully sought the repatriation of hundreds of ancient Mediterranean and Middle Eastern antiquities, with a total value in the hundreds of millions of dollars.&lt;ref name=IllicitTombRaiders /&gt;

In the late 1990s, long-running investigations by the [[Carabinieri Art Squad|Tutela del Patrimonio Culturale]] (TPC), the art crimes division of the Italian [[Carabinieri]], accused the Metropolitan Museum of acquiring "black market" antiquities. TPC investigations in Italy revealed that many ancient Mediterranean objects acquired from the 1960s to the 1990s had been purchased, via a complex network of front companies and unscrupulous dealers, from the criminal gang led by Italian art dealer [[Giacomo Medici (art dealer)|Giacomo Medici]]."&lt;ref name=IllicitTombRaiders /&gt; The Met is also one of many institutional buyers known to have acquired looted artifacts from a Thai-based British "collector", [[Douglas Latchford]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://chasingaphrodite.com/tag/metropolitan-museum-of-art/ Chasing Aphrodite]. "The Kushan Buddhas: Nancy Wiener, Douglas Latchford and New Questions about Ancient Buddhas" (originally posted 1 February 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Met announced that it would repatriate to [[Cambodia]] two ancient [[Khmer Republic|Khmer]] statues, known as "The Kneeling Attendants" , which it had acquired from Latchford (in fragments) in 1987 and 1992. A spokesperson for the Met stated that the museum had received "dispositive" evidence that the objects had been looted from Koh Ker and illegally exported to the USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-metropolitan-museum-returns-cambodian-statues-20130503-story.html Jason Felch, "Metropolitan Museum says it will return Cambodian statues"]. ''Los Angeles Times'', 3 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the ongoing investigations by the Italian police ([[Carabinieri Art Squad|TPC]]), lawsuits brought by the Governments of Italy, Turkey and Cambodia against the Metropolitan Museum of Art contend that the acquisition of the Euphronius krater may have demonstrated a pattern of less than rigorous investigation into the origin and legitimate provenance of highly desirable antiquities for the museum's collections. Examples include, the [[Cloisters Cross]], a large [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] cross carved from walrus ivory,&lt;ref name=IllicitTombRaiders /&gt; the [[Karun Treasure]], also known as the Lydian Hoard, a collection of 200 gold, silver, bronze and earthenware objects, dating from the 7th Century BCE, and  part of a larger haul of some 450 objects looted by local tomb robbers from four ancient royal tombs near [[Sardis]], in Turkey in 1966–67.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21761 "Gold hippocampus from Lydian Hoard found"]. The History Blog, 28 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; After a six-year legal battle that reportedly cost the Turkish government UK£25 million&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/25/king-croesus-treasure-returning-turkey "King Croesus's golden brooch to be returned to Turkey"].Constanze Letch, ''The Guardian'', 26 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; the case ended dramatically after it was revealed that the minutes of the Met's own acquisition committee described how a curator had actually visited the looted burial mounds in Turkey to confirm the authenticity of the objects. The Met was forced to concede that staff had known the objects were stolen when it bought them, and the collection was repatriated to Turkey in 1993.&lt;ref name=IllicitTombRaiders /&gt;

The [[Morgantina treasure]] is a hoard of ornate Hellenistic silverware dated 3rd century BC, valued at perhaps up to US$100 million, acquired by the Met in the early 1980s. It was later shown to have been looted from the [[Morgantina|Morgantina archaeological site]] in Sicily. After a protracted lawsuit, the Met conceded that it was looted, and agreed in 2006 to repatriate it to Sicily, with the Met stating in 2006 that the repatriation "redresses past improprieties in the acquisitions process".&lt;ref name=IllicitTombRaiders /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article, [http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/morgantina-silver/ "Morgantina Silver"], by Suzie Thomas, year 2012 at the website [http://traffickingculture.org/ TraffickingCulture.org], website devoted to illicit trafficking in ancient art objects. The article cites the following press release issued by the Metropolitian Museum on 21 Feb 2006: [http://www.metmuseum.org/press/news/2006/statement-by-the-metropolitan-museum-of-art-on-its-agreement-with-italian-ministry-of-culture "Statement by the Metropolitan Museum of Art on its agreement with the Italian Ministry of Culture"].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Simon David''' (19 December 1883 – 1 July 1939) better known as '''Louis Davids''' was a Dutch [[cabaretier]] and [[revue]]artist and is widely considered one of the Netherlands biggest names in [[performing arts]].

== Biography ==
Louis Davids was born in [[Rotterdam]] as son of the comedian and café owner Levie David and Francina Terveen (deceased in 1927) in a poor Jewish family of eight children. His parents were performing artists and Louis sang from the age of eight years at all the state fairs with his brother Hakkie who played the Piano. Until he was 13 years old he also performed with his sister Rika in Rotterdam outside of the fair. After an argument with his father he left for England to be an assistant to a Magician. Returning to Rotterdam a year later, returning home with a lot more experience in variety theater. Together with his sister Rika he managed to secure a job outside of the fair, working at the theater [[Pschorr]], on ''Een reisje langs den Rijn'' and ''We gaan naar Zandvoort aan de zee'' amongst others, him and his sister then moved to [[Amsterdam]] to work with theater director [[Frits van Haarlem]] in Carré with plenty success in creating revues after English fashion. He furthered his success in revue in 1909 working with [[Henri ter Hall]].

[[File:Rotterdam monument louis davids detail.jpg|thumb|300px|Detail]]
After Rika married English magician [[John Weil]] and moved to England she parted from the successful duo. Louis then formed another duo, after an unsuccessful attempt at a career as a magician, this time with his younger sister Henriëtte ([[Heintje Davids|Heintje]]). The second Davids duo was a success once more. The husband of Heiintje, [[Philip Pinkhof]], wrote the roles that Davids and his ster would play.

In 1906 Louis married Rebecca Kokernoot with whom he had a daughter, he was however unhappy in his marriage. While on tour Davids made the acquaintance of [[Margie Morris]] who had moved to the Netherlands in 1913. Up until 1922 Louis and Maggie formed the duo "He, She and the piano", where Maggie would take on the role as composer. The comedic repertoire soon becomes known across the land as what is now known as the genre [[Levenslied]]. A famous song from this period is ''[[De Jantjes (1922)|De Jantjes]]'' which was also released as a silent film in 1922, and as a full motion picture in 1934. Between 1922 and 1926 Davids was the director of the Casino Theater in Rotterdam, but the job of a director does not hold his attention for long.

In 1929 Louis Davids appeared in the revue ''Lach en vergeet'' with the song which would prpbably become his most popular title ''[[De kleine man]]''. It was written by [[Jacques van Tol]], with whom Davids would work closely until his death in 1939. Him and Van Tol agreed that Tol would remain anonymous as songwriter after 1929.

Despite Davids being from Rotterdam, he was a popular performer of the Amsterdam [[Jordan]] repertoire. David was the founder of the career of some big names like [[Wim Kan]] and [[Corry Vonk]], [[Wim Sonneveld]] and Cabaret Ping Pong.

In 1937 Louis Davids had to give up his work at the [[Kurhaus of Scheveningen]]-[[cabaret]] due to [[asthma]]. His early passing at the age of 55 was largely due to asthma. Davids was cremated in Driehuis. His ashes were interred in the columbarium of the crematorium. The remains of his brother Rido and his sister Heintje Davids were later placed next to him.

== Repertoire ==
A small group of his repertoire include: ''De Kleine Man, Mina, Kindervragen, Lintjesregen, Sally Met De Roomijskar, Wat een meisje weten moet, Weekend in Scheveningen, Moeder heeft haar rijbewijs, Naar de bollen, De begrafenis van ome Manus, De Scheveningse zee, Bridgeclub Kijk voor je, De Sweepstake, Waarom zou ik niet, De Olieman heeft een Fordje opgedaan, Ich küsse ihre Hand Madame, De Voetbalmatch, Weet je nog wel oudje, Moeder wil dansen, Als je voor een dubbeltje geboren bent, In de Jordaan''.

== Legacy ==
In 2010 the Netherlands Comedy Theater performed a play about Davids titled ''[[Liedjes van Louis Davids]]''.

The [[Macedonian language]] has two sets of names of the months of the [[Gregorian calendar]]. The most commonly used set of names is derived from the [[Latin]] month names and these are used by the vast majority of the [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian population]]. However, there is also a set of older names for the twelve months of [[Slavic languages|Slavic origin]] that differ from the Latin month names, although their usage is [[Archaism|archaized]] and largely restricted to folk literature and religious calendars issued by the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]].

The origin of the Macedonian month names is closely related to the [[Agriculture|agricultural]] activities that occur in the corresponding period, or to the [[weather]] condition common for that period. Some months have alternative names in different regions. The usage of modern Latin month names among Macedonians started towards the end of the [[19th century]], as a result of mass education.

'''''Mein Kampf''''' ({{IPA-de|maɪ̯n kampf|lang}}, ''My Struggle'') is a 1925 autobiographical book by [[Nazi Party]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]].  The work describes the process by which Hitler became [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] and outlines his [[Political views of Adolf Hitler|political ideology and future plans]] for Germany. Volume 1 of ''Mein Kampf'' was published in 1925 and Volume 2 in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;''Mein Kampf'' ''("My Fight"),'' Adolf Hitler (originally 1925–1926), Reissue edition (15 September 1998), Publisher: Mariner Books, Language: English, paperback, 720 pages, {{ISBN|978-1495333347}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was edited by Hitler's deputy [[Rudolf Hess]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=85}}&lt;ref&gt;Robert G.L. Waite, The Psychopathic God: Adolf Hitler, Basic Books, 1977, pp.237–243&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler began ''Mein Kampf'' while imprisoned for what he considered to be "political crimes" following [[Beer Hall Putsch|his failed Putsch in Munich]] in November 1923. Although Hitler received many visitors initially, he soon devoted himself entirely to the book. As he continued, Hitler realized that it would have to be a two-volume work, with the first volume scheduled for release in early 1925. The governor of [[Landsberg Prison|Landsberg]] noted at the time that "he [Hitler] hopes the book will run into many editions, thus enabling him to fulfill his financial obligations and to defray the expenses incurred at the time of his trial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heinz|first1=Heinz|title=Germany's Hitler|date=1934|publisher=Hurst &amp; Blackett|page=191|url=https://archive.org/details/GermanysHitler}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Payne|first1=Robert|title=The Life and Death of Adolf Hitler|date=1973|publisher=Popular Library|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; After slow initial sales, the book was a bestseller in Germany after [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power |Hitler's rise to power]] in 1933.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=80–81}}

After Hitler's death, copyright of ''Mein Kampf'' passed to the state government of [[Bavaria]], which refused to allow any copying or printing of the book in Germany. In 2016, following the expiration of the copyright held by the Bavarian state government, ''Mein Kampf'' was republished in Germany for the first time since 1945, which prompted public debate and divided reactions from Jewish groups.

== Analysis ==
In ''Mein Kampf'', Hitler used the main thesis of "the Jewish peril", which posits a Jewish conspiracy to gain world leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historytoday.com/MainArticle.aspx?m=32043&amp;amid=30237234 Mein Kampf – The Text, its Themes and Hitler's Vision], History Today&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative describes the process by which he became increasingly [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] and [[militarism|militaristic]], especially during his years in Vienna. He speaks of not having met a [[Jew]] until he arrived in Vienna, and that at first his attitude was liberal and tolerant. When he first encountered the antisemitic press, he says, he dismissed it as unworthy of serious consideration. Later he accepted the same antisemitic views, which became crucial to his program of national reconstruction of Germany.

''Mein Kampf'' has also been studied as a work on [[political theory]]. For example, Hitler announces his hatred of what he believed to be the world's two evils: [[Communism]] and [[Judaism]].

In the book Hitler blamed Germany's chief woes on the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|parliament]] of the [[Weimar Republic]], the Jews, and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]], as well as [[Marxism|Marxists]], though he believed that Marxists, Social Democrats, and the parliament were all working for Jewish interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/meinkampf035176mbp|title=Mein Kampf|work=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced that he wanted to completely destroy the [[parliamentary system]], believing it to be corrupt in principle, as those who reach power are inherent [[opportunism|opportunists]].

===Antisemitism===
While historians dispute the exact date Hitler decided to [[Madagascar Plan|force the Jewish people to emigrate to Madagascar]], few place the decision before the mid-1930s.&lt;ref name=Browning2003p12&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher R. |last=Browning |authorlink=Christopher Browning |year=2003 |title=Initiating the Final Solution: The Fateful Months of September–October 1941 |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies |location=Washington, D.C. |oclc=53343660 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First published in 1925, ''Mein Kampf'' shows Hitler's personal grievances and his ambitions for creating a [[New Order (Nazism)|New Order]].

The historian [[Ian Kershaw]] points out that several passages in ''Mein Kampf'' are undeniably of a [[Genocide|genocidal]] nature.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw, Hitler 1889-1936 Hubris (1999), p.258&lt;/ref&gt;  Hitler wrote "the nationalization of our masses will succeed only when, aside from all the positive struggle for the soul of our people, their international poisoners are exterminated",&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf, Volume One - A Reckoning, Chapter XII: The First Period of Development of the National Socialist German Workers' Party&lt;/ref&gt; and he suggested that, "If at the beginning of the war and during the war twelve or fifteen thousand of these Hebrew corrupters of the nation had been subjected to poison gas, such as had to be endured in the field by hundreds of thousands of our very best German workers of all classes and professions, then the sacrifice of millions at the front would not have been in vain."&lt;ref name="Yahil-1991"&gt;Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf, Volume Two - A Reckoning, Chapter XV: The Right of Emergency Defense, p. 984, quoted in {{cite book |last=Yahlil |first=Leni |title=The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jewry, 1932–1945 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e_aRvKpLUf0C&amp;pg=PA51 |accessdate=9 January 2016 |year=1991 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-504523-9 |page=51 |chapter=2. Hitler Implements Twentieth-Century Anti-Semitism |oclc=20169748}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The racial laws to which Hitler referred resonate directly with his ideas in ''Mein Kampf''.  In the first edition of ''Mein Kampf'', Hitler stated that the destruction of the weak and sick is far more humane than their protection.  Apart from this allusion to humane treatment, Hitler saw a purpose in destroying "the weak" in order to provide the proper space and purity for the "strong".&lt;ref&gt;A. Hitler. Mein Kampf (Munich: Franz Eher Nachfolger, 1930), pg 478&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Lebensraum'' ("Living space")===
In the chapter "Eastern Orientation or Eastern Policy", Hitler argued that the Germans needed [[Lebensraum]] in the East, a "historic destiny" that would properly nurture the German people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww2history.com/experts/Sir_Ian_Kershaw/Hitler_s_expansionist_aims|title=Hitler’s expansionist aims &gt; Professor Sir Ian Kershaw &gt; WW2History.com|website=ww2history.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler believed that "the organization of a Russian state formation was not the result of the political abilities of the Slavs in Russia, but only a wonderful example of the state-forming efficacity of the German element in an inferior race."&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf, Eastern Orientation or Eastern policy&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Mein Kampf'' Hitler openly stated the future German expansion in the East, foreshadowing [[Generalplan Ost]]:
{{quote|And so we National Socialists consciously draw a line beneath the foreign policy tendency of our pre-War period. We take up where we broke off six hundred years ago. We stop the endless German movement to the south and west, and turn our gaze toward the land in the east. At long last we break off the colonial and commercial policy of the pre-War period and shift to the soil policy of the future.

If we speak of soil in Europe today, we can primarily have in mind only Russia and her vassal border states.&lt;ref name="Fest2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joachim C. Fest|title=Hitler|date=1 February 2013|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0-544-19554-X|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although Hitler originally wrote ''Mein Kampf'' mostly for the followers of National Socialism, it grew in popularity after he rose to power. (Two other books written by party members, [[Gottfried Feder]]'s ''Breaking The Interest Slavery'' and [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]],'' have since lapsed into comparative literary obscurity, and no translation of Feder's book from the original German is known.)&lt;ref name="spiegel" /&gt; Hitler had made about 1.2 million Reichsmarks from the income of the book by 1933, when the average annual income of a teacher was about 4,800 Marks.&lt;ref name="spiegel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="taxes" /&gt; He accumulated a tax debt of 405,500 [[German reichsmark|Reichsmark]] (very roughly in 2015 1.1 million [[Pound Sterling|GBP]], 1.4 million [[Euro|EUR]], 1.5 million [[United States dollar|USD]]) from the sale of about 240,000 copies before he became chancellor in 1933 (at which time his debt was waived).&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/0,1518,druck-433526,00.html Mythos Ladenhüter] Spiegel Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taxes"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4105683.stm Hitler dodged taxes, expert finds] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler began to distance himself from the book after becoming chancellor of Germany in 1933. He dismissed it as "fantasies behind bars" that were little more than a series of articles for the ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'', and later told [[Hans Frank]] that "If I had had any idea in 1924 that I would have become Reich chancellor, I never would have written the book."&lt;ref name="Ryback2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Timothy W. Ryback|title=Hitler's Private Library: The Books that Shaped his Life|date=6 July 2010|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4090-7578-3|pages=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, ''Mein Kampf'' was a bestseller in Germany during the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Guardian2016" /&gt; During Hitler's years in power, the book was in high demand in libraries and often reviewed and quoted in other publications. It was given free to every newlywed couple and every soldier fighting at the front.&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt;  By 1939 it had sold 5.2 million copies in eleven languages.&lt;ref&gt;Mein Kampf work by Hitler. Encyclopædia Britannica. Last updated 19 February 2014. Retrieved 21 May 2015 from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/373362/Mein-Kampf&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the war, about 10 million copies of the book had been sold or distributed in Germany.

==Contemporary observations==
''Mein Kampf'', in essence, lays out the ideological program Hitler established for the German revolution, by identifying the Jews and "Bolsheviks" as racially and ideologically inferior and threatening, and "Aryans" and National Socialists as racially superior and politically progressive. Hitler's revolutionary goals included expulsion of the Jews from [[Greater Germany]] and the unification of German peoples into one Greater Germany. Hitler desired to restore German lands to their greatest historical extent, real or imagined.

Due to its [[racism|racist]] content and the historical effect of Nazism upon Europe during [[World War II]] and the [[Holocaust]], it is considered a highly controversial book. Criticism has not come solely from opponents of Nazism. [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist]] dictator and Nazi ally [[Benito Mussolini]] was also critical of the book, saying that it was "a boring [[wikt:tome|tome]] that I have never been able to read" and remarking that Hitler's beliefs, as expressed in the book, were "little more than commonplace clichés".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Denis Mack. 1983. ''Mussolini: A Biography''. New York: Vintage Books. p. 172 / London: Paladin, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

The German journalist [[Konrad Heiden]], an early critic of the Nazi Party, observed that the content of ''Mein Kampf'' is essentially a political argument with other members of the Nazi Party who had appeared to be Hitler's friends, but whom he was actually denouncing in the book's content – sometimes by not even including references to them.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

The American literary theorist and philosopher [[Kenneth Burke]] wrote a 1939 rhetorical analysis of the work, ''[[The Rhetoric of Hitler's "Battle"]]'', which revealed an underlying message of aggressive intent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uregina.ca/~rheaults/rhetor/2004/schmidt.pdf Uregina.ca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125085622/http://uregina.ca/~rheaults/rhetor/2004/schmidt.pdf |date=25 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American journalist [[John Gunther]] said in 1940 that compared to the autobiographies of [[My Life (Leon Trotsky autobiography)|Leon Trotsky]] or [[The Education of Henry Adams|Henry Adams]] ''Mein Kampf'' was "vapid, vain, rhetorical, diffuse, prolix. But it is a powerful and moving book, the product of great passionate feeling". He suggested that the book exhausted curious German readers, but its "ceaseless repetition of the argument, left impregnably in their minds, fecund and germinating".&lt;ref name="gunther1940"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n53/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers |location=New York| author=Gunther, John |authorlink=John Gunther| year=1940 | page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1940, British writer [[George Orwell]] reviewed a then-recently published uncensored translation of ''Mein Kampf'' for ''[[The New English Weekly]]''. Orwell suggested that the force of Hitler's personality shone through the often "clumsy" writing, capturing the magnetic allure of Hitler for many Germans. In essence, Orwell notes, Hitler offers only visions of endless struggle and conflict in the creation of "a horrible brainless empire" that "stretch[es] to [[Afghanistan]] or thereabouts". He wrote, "Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a more grudging way, have said to people 'I offer you a good time,' Hitler has said to them, 'I offer you struggle, danger, and death,' and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his feet." Orwell's review was written in the aftermath of the 1939 [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], when Hitler made peace with USSR after more than a decade of vitriolic rhetoric and threats between the two nations; with the pact in place, Orwell believed, England was now facing a risk of Nazi attack and the UK must not underestimate the appeal of Hitler's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George. "Mein Kampf" review, reprinted in ''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell'', Vol 2., Sonia Orwell and Ian Angus, eds., Harourt Brace Jovanovich 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1943 book ''The Menace of the Herd'', Austrian scholar [[Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn]]&lt;ref&gt;Francis Stuart Campbell, pen name of [[Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn]] (1943), ''Menace of the Herd, or, Procrustes at Large'', Milwaukee, WI: The Bruce Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt; described Hitler's ideas in ''Mein Kampf'' and elsewhere as "a veritable ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' of '[[Progressivism|progressive]]' thought"&lt;ref&gt;Kuehnelt-Leddihn, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; and betraying "a curious lack of original thought" that shows Hitler offered no innovative or original ideas but was merely "a ''virtuoso'' of commonplaces which he may or may not repeat in the guise of a 'new discovery.'"&lt;ref&gt;Kuehnelt-Leddihn, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler's stated aim, Kuehnelt-Leddihn writes, is to quash individualism in furtherance of political goals:

{{quote|When Hitler and Mussolini attack the "western democracies" they insinuate that their "democracy" is not genuine. National Socialism envisages abolishing the difference in wealth, education, intellect, taste, philosophy, and habits by a leveling process which necessitates in turn a total control over the child and the adolescent. Every personal attitude will be branded—after communist pattern—as "[[bourgeois]]," and this in spite of the fact that the bourgeois is the representative of the most herdist class in the world, and that National Socialism is a basically bourgeois movement.

Hitler in ''Mein Kampf'' repeatedly speaks of the "masses" and the "herd" referring to the people. The German people should probably, in his view, remain a mass of identical "individuals" in an enormous sand heap or ant heap, identical even to the color of their shirts, the garment nearest to the body.&lt;ref&gt;Kuehnelt-Leddihn, pp. 202–203&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his ''[[The Second World War (Churchill)|The Second World War]]'', published in several volumes in the late 1940s and early 1950s, [[Winston Churchill]] wrote that he felt that after Hitler's ascension to power, no other book than ''Mein Kampf'' deserved more intensive scrutiny.&lt;ref name="ChurchillTheSecondWorldWar"&gt;''Winston Churchill: The Second World War''. Volume 1, Houghton Mifflin Books 1986, S. 50. "Here was the new Koran of faith and war: turgid, verbose, shapeless, but pregnant with its message."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later analysis==
The critic [[George Steiner]] has suggested that ''Mein Kampf'' can be seen as one of several books that resulted from the crisis of German culture following Germany's defeat in [[World War I]], comparable in this respect to the philosopher [[Ernst Bloch]]'s ''The Spirit of Utopia'' (1918), the historian [[Oswald Spengler]]'s ''[[The Decline of the West]]'' (1918), the theologian [[Franz Rosenzweig]]'s ''The Star of Redemption'' (1921), and the theologian [[Karl Barth]]'s ''[[The Epistle to the Romans (Barth)|The Epistle to the Romans]]'' (1922).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Steiner, George |title=Martin Heidegger |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1991 |pages=vii-viii |isbn=0-226-77232-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==German publication history==
While Hitler was in power (1933–1945), ''Mein Kampf'' came to be available in three common editions. The first, the ''Volksausgabe'' or People's Edition, featured the original cover on the dust jacket and was navy blue underneath with a gold [[swastika]] eagle embossed on the cover. The ''Hochzeitsausgabe'', or Wedding Edition, in a slipcase with the seal of the province embossed in gold onto a parchment-like cover was given free to marrying couples. In 1940, the ''Tornister-Ausgabe'', or Knapsack Edition, was released. This edition was a compact, but unabridged, version in a red cover and was released by the post office, available to be sent to loved ones fighting at the front. These three editions combined both volumes into the same book.

A special edition was published in 1939 in honour of Hitler's 50th birthday. This edition was known as the ''Jubiläumsausgabe'', or Anniversary Issue. It came in both dark blue and bright red boards with a gold sword on the cover. This work contained both volumes one and two. It was considered a deluxe version, relative to the smaller and more common ''Volksausgabe''.

The book could also be purchased as a two-volume set during Hitler's rule, and was available in soft cover and hardcover. The soft cover edition contained the original cover (as pictured at the top of this article). The hardcover edition had a leather spine with cloth-covered boards. The cover and spine contained an image of three brown oak leaves.

==English translations==
===Dugdale abridgement===
The first English translation was an abridgement by [[Edgar Dugdale]] who started work on it in 1931, at the prompting of his wife, Blanche. When he learned that the London publishing firm of [[Hurst &amp; Blackett]] had secured the rights to publish an abridgement in the United Kingdom, he offered it for free in April 1933. However, a local Nazi Party representative insisted that the translation be further abridged before publication, so it was held back until 13 October 1933, although excerpts were allowed to run in ''[[The Times]]'' in late July. It was published by Hurst &amp; Blackett as part of "The Paternoster Library".

In America, [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]] secured the rights to the Dugdale abridgement on 29 July 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lankiewicz |first1=Donald |title=MEIN KAMPF in America: How Adolf Hitler Came to Be Published in the United States |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308733730_MEIN_KAMPF_in_America_How_Adolf_Hitler_Came_to_Be_Published_in_the_United_States |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only differences between the American and British versions are that the title was translated ''My Struggle'' in the UK and ''My Battle'' in America; and that Dugdale is credited as translator in the US edition, while the British version withheld his name. Both Dugdale and his wife were active in the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement; Blanche was the niece of [[Arthur Balfour|Lord Balfour]], and they wished to avoid publicity.

===Reynal and Hitchcock translation===
Houghton and Mifflin licensed [[Reynal &amp; Hitchcock]] the rights to publish a full unexpurgated translation in 1938. The book was translated from the two volumes of the first German edition (1925 and 1927), with notations appended noting any changes made in later editions, which were deemed "not as extensive as popularly supposed."&lt;ref name=RandHIntro8&gt;"Introduction," ''Mein Kampf''. New York: Reynal and Hitchcock, 1940; pg. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; The translation, made by a committee from the [[New School for Social Research]] headed by Alvin Johnson,&lt;ref&gt;Prefatory Note, ''Mein Kampf.'' New York: Reynal and Hitchcock, 1940; pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; was said to have been made with a view to readability rather than in an effort to rigidly reproduce Hitler's sometimes idiosyncratic German form.&lt;ref name=RandHIntro8 /&gt;

The text was heavily annotated for an American audience with biographical and historical details derived largely from German sources.&lt;ref name=RandHIntro8 /&gt; As the translators deemed the book "a propagandistic essay of a violent partisan", which "often warps historical truth and sometimes ignores it completely," the tone of many of these annotations reflected a conscious attempt to provide "factual information that constitutes an extensive critique of the original."&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction" to Reynal and Hitchcock edition, pg. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; The book appeared for sale on 28 February 1939.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Murphy translation===
One of the earlier complete English translations of ''Mein Kampf'' was by [[James Vincent Murphy|James Murphy]] in 1939. It was the only English translation approved by Nazi Germany. The version published by Hutchison &amp; Co. in association with Hurst &amp; Blackett, Ltd (London) in 1939 of the combined volumes I and II is profusely illustrated with many full page drawings and photographs. The opening line, "It has turned out fortunate for me to-day that [[destiny]] appointed [[Braunau am Inn|Braunau-on-the-Inn]] to be my birthplace," is characteristic of Hitler's sense of destiny that began to develop in the early 1920s. Hurst &amp; Blackett ceased publishing the Murphy translation in 1942 when the original plates were destroyed by German bombing, but it is still published and available in facsimile editions and also on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greatwar.nl/books/meinkampf/meinkampf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stackpole translation and controversy===
The small Pennsylvania firm of Stackpole and Sons released its own unexpurgated translation by [[William Soskin]] on the same day as [[Houghton Mifflin]], amid much legal wrangling. The [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled in Houghton Mifflin's favour that June and ordered Stackpole to stop selling their version,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, ''Houghton Mifflin Co. v. Stackpole Sons, Inc., et al.'', 104 Fed.2d 306 (1939); Note, 49 Yale L.J. 132 (1939).&lt;/ref&gt; but litigation followed for a few more years until the case was finally resolved in September 1941.

Among other things, Stackpole argued that Hitler could not have legally transferred his right to a copyright in the United States to Eher Verlag in 1925, because he was not a citizen of any country. ''Houghton Mifflin v. Stackpole'' was a minor landmark in American [[copyright law]], definitively establishing that [[stateless persons]] have the same copyright status in the United States that any other foreigner would.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/1939410104F2d306_1309/HOUGHTON%20MIFFLIN%20CO.%20v.%20STACKPOLE%20SONS,%20INC.|title=HOUGHTON MIFFLIN CO. v.

===Cranston translation and controversy===
Houghton Mifflin's abridged English translation left out some of Hitler's more antisemitic and militaristic statements. This motivated [[Alan Cranston]], an American reporter for [[United Press International]] in Germany (and later a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from California), to publish his own abridged and annotated translation. Cranston believed this version more accurately reflected the contents of the book and Hitler's intentions. In 1939, Cranston was sued by Hitler's publisher for [[copyright infringement]], and a Connecticut judge ruled in Hitler's favour. By the time the publication of Cranston's version was stopped, 500,000 copies had already been sold.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Today, the profits and proceeds are given to various charities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/10/mein_royalties.php/ Mein Royalties] Cabinet Magazine Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manheim translation===
[[Houghton Mifflin]] published a translation by [[Ralph Manheim]] in 1943. They did this to avoid having to share their profits with Reynal &amp; Hitchcock, and to increase sales by offering a more readable translation. The Manheim translation was first published in the United Kingdom by Hurst &amp; Blackett in 1969 amid some controversy.

===Official Nazi translation===
A previously unknown English translation was released in 2008, which had been prepared by the official Nazi printing office, the Franz Eher Verlag. In 1939, the [[Nazi propaganda]] ministry hired [[James Vincent Murphy|James Murphy]] to create an English version of ''Mein Kampf'', which they hoped to use to promote Nazi goals in English-speaking countries. While Murphy was in Germany, he became less enchanted with Nazi ideology and made some statements that the Propaganda Ministry disliked. As a result, they asked him to leave Germany immediately. He was not able to take any of his notes but later sent his wife back to obtain his partial translation.&lt;ref name="murphwife"&gt;Hitler's Mein Kampf in Britain and America: A Publishing History 1930–39; Barnes, James J.; Patience P.

There were three separate printings from August 1938 to March 1939, totaling 14,000; sales totals by 31 March 1939 were 10,345.

The Murphy and Houghton Mifflin translations were the only ones published by the authorised publishers while Hitler was still alive, and not at war with the U.K. and the U.S.

There was some resistance from Eher Verlag to Hurst and Blackett's Murphy translation, as they had not been granted the rights to a full translation. However, they allowed it ''de facto'' permission by not lodging a formal protest, and on 5 May 1939, even inquired about royalties. The British publishers responded on the 12th that the information they requested was "not yet available" and the point would be moot within a few months, on 3 September 1939, when all royalties were halted due to the state of war existing between Britain and Germany.

Royalties were likewise held up in the United States due to the litigation between Houghton Mifflin and Stackpole. Because the matter was only settled in September 1941, only a few months before a state of war existed between Germany and the U.S., all Eher Verlag ever got was a $2,500 advance from Reynal and Hitchcock. It got none from the unauthorised Stackpole edition or the 1943 Manheim edition.

==Current availability==
At the time of his suicide, Hitler's official place of residence was in [[Munich]], which led to his entire estate, including all rights to ''Mein Kampf'', changing to the ownership of the state of [[Bavaria]]. The government of Bavaria, in agreement with the federal government of Germany, refused to allow any copying or printing of the book in Germany. It also opposed copying and printing in other countries, but with less success. As per German [[copyright]] law, the entire text entered the [[public domain]] on 1 January 2016, 70 years after the author's death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/urhg/__64.html § 64 Allgemeines], German Copyright Law. The copyright has been relinquished for the Dutch and Swedish editions and some English ones (though not in the U.S., see below).&lt;/ref&gt;

Owning and buying the book in Germany is not an offence. Trading in old copies is lawful as well, unless it is done in such a fashion as to "promote hatred or war." In particular, the unmodified edition is not covered by §86 [[StGB]] that forbids dissemination of means of propaganda of unconstitutional organisations, since it is a "pre-constitutional work" and as such cannot be opposed to the free and democratic basic order, according to a 1979 decision of the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Judgement of 25 July 1979 – 3 StR 182/79 (S); BGHSt 29, 73 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Most German libraries carry heavily commented and excerpted versions of ''Mein Kampf.'' In 2008, Stephan Kramer, secretary-general of the [[Central Council of Jews in Germany]], not only recommended lifting the ban, but volunteered the help of his organization in editing and annotating the text, saying that it is time for the book to be made available to all online.&lt;ref&gt;"Jewish Leader Urges Book Ban End", ''Dateline World Jewry'', [[World Jewish Congress]], July/August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of restrictions or special circumstances apply in other countries.

===India===
Since its first publication in India in 1928, ''Mein Kampf'' has gone through hundreds of editions and sold over 100,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jungle-world.com/artikel/2013/33/48296.html|title=Archiv – 33/2013 – Dschungel – Über die Wahrnehmung von Faschismus und Nationalsozialismus in Indien|website=Jungle-world.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/mein-kampf-sales-india/|title=Hitler's "Mein Kampf" on India's best sellers list|website=RT.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===

In the Netherlands the sale of ''Mein Kampf'' had been forbidden since [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2017/02/shop-owner-cleared-of-spreading-hatred-for-selling-mein-kampf/|title=Shop owner cleared of spreading hatred for selling Mein Kampf - DutchNews.nl|date=14 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tmgonlinemedia.nl/consent/consent/?return=https://www.metronieuws.nl/nieuws/binnenland/2016/10/promotheus-wil-mein-kampf-in-nederland-uitgeven&amp;clienttime=1494413267840&amp;version=0&amp;detect=true|title=metronieuws.nl cookie consent|website=tmgonlinemedia.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018, however, Dutch publisher Prometheus  officially released an academic edition of the 2016 German translation with comprehensive introductions and annotations by Dutch historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://uitgeverijprometheus.nl/nieuws/wetenschappelijke-editie-mijnstrijd.html|title=De wetenschappelijke editie van Mein Kampf - Uitgeverij Prometheus|date=2018-08-23|work=Uitgeverij Prometheus|access-date=2018-09-05|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt; It marks the first time the book is widely available to the general public in the Netherlands since [[World War II]].

===Russia===
In the [[Russia|Russian Federation]], ''Mein Kampf'' has been published at least three times since 1992; the Russian text is also available on websites. In 2006 the [[Public Chamber of Russia]] proposed banning the book. In 2009 St. Petersburg's branch of the [[Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs]] requested to remove an annotated and hyper-linked Russian translation of the book from a historiography website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsru.com/russia/08jul2009/hrono.html A well-known historiography web site shut down over publishing Hitler's book], [[Newsru.com]], 8 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrono.info/libris/lib_g/meinkampf00.html|title=Моя борьба |accessdate=8 July 2009|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Hitler, annotated and hyper-linked ed. by Vyacheslav Rumyantsev, archived from the [http://www.hrono.info/libris/lib_g/meinkampf00.html original] 12 February 2008; an [http://www.hrono.ru/dokum/192_dok/mein_kampf.html abridged version] remained intact.&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 April 2010, it was announced that ''Mein Kampf'' is outlawed on grounds of extremism promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/mein-kampf-banned-russia |title=Radio Netherlands Worldwide |access-date=27 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607053633/http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/mein-kampf-banned-russia |archive-date=7 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
''Mein Kampf'' has been reprinted several times since 1945; in 1970, 1992, 2002 and 2010. In 1992 the Government of Bavaria tried to stop the publication of the book, and the case went to the [[Supreme Court of Sweden]] which ruled in favour of the publisher, stating that the book is protected by copyright, but that the copyright holder is unidentified (and not the [[State of Bavaria]]) and that the original Swedish publisher from 1934 had gone out of business. It therefore refused the Government of Bavaria's claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hagglundsforlag.se/forfattaredok/Hitler/Pressmed0324.htm|title=Hägglunds förlag|website=Hagglundsforlag.se|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331194349/http://www.hagglundsforlag.se/forfattaredok/Hitler/Pressmed0324.htm|archivedate=31 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The only translation changes came in the 1970 edition, but they were only linguistic, based on a new Swedish standard.

===Turkey===
''Mein Kampf'' was widely available and growing in popularity in [[Turkey]], even to the point where it became a bestseller, selling up to 100,000 copies in just two months in 2005. Analysts and commentators believe the popularity of the book to be related to a rise in nationalism and anti-U.S. sentiment. A columnist in Shalom stated this was a result of "what is happening in the Middle East, the Israeli-Palestinian problem and the [[war in Iraq]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/29/turkey.books | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Mein Kampf sales soar in Turkey | first=Helena | last=Smith | date=29 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doğu Ergil, a political scientist at Ankara University, said both far-right ultranationalists and extremist Islamists had found common ground - "not on a common agenda for the future, but on their anxieties, fears and hate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4361733.stm | work=BBC News | title=Hitler book bestseller in Turkey | date=18 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, ''Mein Kampf'' can be found at many community libraries and can be bought, sold and traded in bookshops.&lt;ref name=Pascal&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/node/153682 |title=Unbanning Hitler |first=Julia |last=Pascal |work=[[New Statesman]] |date=25 June 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government seized the copyright in September 1942&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ru4ZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6SIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3641%2C3614835|title=The Milwaukee Journal - Google News Archive Search|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[World War II|Second World War]] under the [[Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917|Trading with the Enemy Act]] and in 1979, Houghton Mifflin, the U.S. publisher of the book, bought the rights from the government pursuant to {{USCFR|28|0|47}}. More than 15,000 copies are sold a year.&lt;ref name="Pascal"/&gt; In 2016, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt reported that it was having difficulty finding a charity that would accept profits from the sales of its version of ''Mein Kampf'', which it had promised to donate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2016/04/30/boston-publisher-grapples-with-mein-kampf-profits/zgFxVGBpfPx98xKchc382L/story.html Boston publisher grapples with 'Mein Kampf' profits] Boston Globe Retrieved 3 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online availability===
In 1999, the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] documented that major Internet booksellers such as [[Amazon.com]] and [[Barnes &amp; Noble|Barnesandnoble.com]] sell ''Mein Kampf'' to Germany. After a public outcry, both companies agreed to stop those sales to addresses in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=BEYETTE|first=BEVERLY|title=Is hate for sale?|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jan/05/news/cl-50757|newspaper=LA Times|date=5 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is currently available through both companies online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Mein-Kampf-Adolf-Hitler/dp/0395925037/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404827908&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=0395925037|title=Mein Kampf: Adolf Hitler, Ralph Manheim: 9780395925034: Amazon.com: Books|work=amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/mein-kampf-adolf-hitler/1103285065?ean=9781480135581|title=Mein Kampf|date=21 October 2010|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also available in various languages, including German, at the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/search.php?query=MEIN%20KAMPF%20AND%20mediatype%3Atexts|title=Internet Archive Search: MEIN KAMPF|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Murphy translation of the book is freely available on [[Project Gutenberg Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.net.au/ebooks02/0200601.txt|title=Mein Kampf - Project Gutenberg Australia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the January 2016 republication of the book in Germany, the book can be ordered at Amazon's German website.&lt;ref name="nyt-eddy" /&gt;

===2016 republication in Germany===
On 3 February 2010, the [[Institut für Zeitgeschichte|Institute of Contemporary History]] (IfZ) in Munich announced plans to republish an annotated version of the text, for educational purposes in schools and universities, in 2015, when the copyright currently held by the [[Bavaria]]n state government expires (2016). The book had last been published in Germany in 1945. A group of German historians argued that a republication was necessary to get an authoritative annotated edition by the time the copyright runs out, which might open the way for [[neo-Nazi]] groups to publish their own versions. "Once Bavaria's copyright expires, there is the danger of charlatans and neo-Nazis appropriating this infamous book for themselves," Wolfgang Heubisch said. The Bavarian government opposed the plan, citing respect for victims of the [[Holocaust]]. Its Finance Ministry said that permits for reprints would not be issued, at home or abroad. This would also apply to a new annotated edition. The republished book might be banned as Nazi propaganda. Even after expiration of the copyright, the Bavarian government emphasised that "the dissemination of Nazi ideologies will remain prohibited in Germany and is punishable under the penal code".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/mein-kampf-to-see-its-first-postwwii-publication-in-germany-1891347.html |title='Mein Kampf' to see its first post-WWII publication in Germany |date=6 February 2010 |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212000803/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/mein-kampf-to-see-its-first-postwwii-publication-in-germany-1891347.html |archivedate=12 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Associated Press]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/02/05/world/AP-EU-Germany-Mein-Kampf.html |title=Historians Hope to Publish 'Mein Kampf' in Germany |date=5 February 2010 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nicholas |last=Kulish |date=4 February 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/05/world/europe/05germany.html |title=Rebuffing Scholars, Germany Vows to Keep Hitler Out of Print |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Nancy |last1=Isenson |author2=[[Reuters]] |date=4 February 2010 |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5216209,00.html |title=German institute seeks to reprint Hitler's 'Mein Kampf' |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,676019,00.html |title=The Kampf for 'Mein Kampf': Annotated Version of Hitler Polemic in the Works |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 December 2013 the Bavarian government cancelled its financial support for an annotated edition. The Institute of Contemporary History (IfZ) in Munich, which is preparing the translation, announced that it intended to proceed with publication after the copyright expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25346140 | work=BBC News | title=Bavaria abandons plans for new edition of Mein Kampf | date=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IfZ scheduled an edition of ''Mein Kampf'' for release in 2016.&lt;ref name=rt-Anti-Hitler&gt;{{cite web |last1=Logwin|first1=Pierre |title='Anti-Hitler' Mein Kampf?

Richard Verber, vice-president of the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]], stated in 2015 that the board trusted the academic and educational value of republishing. “We would, of course, be very wary of any attempt to glorify Hitler or to belittle the Holocaust in any way,” Verber declared to ''[[The Observer]]''. “But this is not that. I do understand how some Jewish groups could be upset and nervous, but it seems it is being done from a historical point of view and to put it in context.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/26/hitler-main-kampf-wary-welcome-british-jews|title=British Jews give wary approval to the return of Hitler’s Mein Kampf|author=Vanessa Thorpe|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An annotated edition of ''Mein Kampf'' was published in Germany in January 2016 and sold out within hours on Amazon's German site.&lt;ref name="nyt-eddy"&gt;{{cite web |title='Mein Kampf,' Hitler's Manifesto, Returns to German Shelves |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/09/world/europe/mein-kampf-hitler-germany.html |last=Eddy |first=Melissa |website=The New York Times |date=2016-01-08 |accessdate=2016-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's publication led to public debate in Germany, and divided reactions from Jewish groups, with some supporting, and others opposing, the decision to publish.&lt;ref name="Guardian2016"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/08/copies-of-hitlers-mein-kampf-go-on-sale-in-germany-for-first-time-in-70-years |title=High demand for reprint of Hitler's Mein Kampf takes publisher by surprise |author= |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; German officials had previously said they would limit public access to the text amid fears that its republication could stir neo-Nazi sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35209185|title=Copyright of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf expires|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bookstores stated that they would not stock the book.

==Sequel==
{{Main article|Zweites Buch}}
After the party's poor showing in the 1928 elections, Hitler believed that the reason for his loss was the public's misunderstanding of his ideas. He then retired to Munich to dictate a sequel to ''Mein Kampf'' to expand on its ideas, with more focus on foreign policy.

Only two copies of the 200-page manuscript were originally made, and only one of these was ever made public. The document was neither edited nor published during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]] and remains known as ''[[Zweites Buch]]'', or "Second Book". To keep the document strictly secret, in 1935 Hitler ordered that it be placed in a safe in an air raid shelter. It remained there until being discovered by an American officer in 1945.

The authenticity of the document found in 1945 has been verified by Josef Berg, a former employee of the Nazi publishing house Eher Verlag, and [[Telford Taylor]], a former brigadier general of the United States Army Reserve and Chief Counsel at the Nuremberg war-crimes trials.

In 1958, the ''Zweites Buch'' was found in the archives of the United States by American historian [[Gerhard Weinberg]]. Unable to find an American publisher, Weinberg turned to his mentor – [[Hans Rothfels]] at the Institute of Contemporary History in Munich, and his associate [[Martin Broszat]] – who published ''Zweites Buch'' in 1961. A pirated edition was published in English in New York in 1962. The first authoritative English edition was not published until 2003 (''[[Zweites Buch|Hitler's Second Book: The Unpublished Sequel to Mein Kampf]],'' {{ISBN|1-929631-16-2}}).

The '''Museo Regional del Sureste de Petén''' ("'''Southeastern Petén Regional Museum'''") is an [[archaeology|archaeological]] museum in the town of [[Dolores, El Petén|Dolores]] in the [[Petén Department]] of [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name="REDCAMUS"&gt;REDCAMUS.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is located {{Convert|82|km|mi}} from [[Flores, El Petén|Flores]], the [[Departments of Guatemala|departmental]] capital, among the [[Maya Mountains]] in an area rich in archaeological sites.&lt;ref name="Corzo07p80"&gt;Corzo 2007, p.80.&lt;/ref&gt; It is open daily from 8am to 5pm.&lt;ref name="REDCAMUS"/&gt;

==Development==
[[File:Dolores, Petén 1.jpg|thumb|left|View across the museum courtyard over the town of Dolores]]
Construction of the museum was first proposed by the Dirección General de Caminos ("Highways Department") in 1998 as part of its plans to build a highway from [[San Luis, El Petén|San Luis]] to Flores in order to offset any damage to Guatemala's [[cultural heritage]] caused by the construction project.&lt;ref name="Corzo07p79"&gt;Corzo 2007, p.79.&lt;/ref&gt; The land upon which the museum was built was donated in 1998,&lt;ref name="Corzo01p218"&gt;Corzo 2001, p.218.&lt;/ref&gt; and had originally been used for the first seat of the municipal council.&lt;ref name="Corzo07p80"&gt;Corzo 2007, p.80.&lt;/ref&gt; Construction began in December 1999,&lt;ref name="SierraGarcia08p55"&gt;Sierra García 2008, p.55.&lt;/ref&gt; with the fabric of the building being completed in November 2000.&lt;ref name="SierraGarcia08p55"/&gt; In 2001, the Dirección General de Caminos officially handed the building over to the Ministerio de Cultura y Deportes.&lt;ref name="Corzo07p80"/&gt;

In 2000, the Atlas Arqueológico de Guatemala petitioned the Agencia Española de Cooperación International ("Spanish Agency for International Cooperation") for funding to restore excavated artefacts ready for display in the museum.&lt;ref name="Corzo07p80"/&gt; The agency responded positively and the Atlas Arqueológica was able to contract archaeologists from the [[Tikal]] National Park to carry out the restoration work.&lt;ref name="Corzo07p80"/&gt; This restoration process lasted two years.&lt;ref name="Corzo07p80"/&gt; The museum was officially opened on 17 March 2005 and is administered by staff of the Atlas Arqueológico de Guatemala.&lt;ref name="Corzo05p724"&gt;Corzo 2005, p.724.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
The building consists of the exhibition halls, administrative facilities, a warehouse, guardroom, sanitary services and a community hall.&lt;ref name="Corzo07p82"/&gt;

==Collection==
The museum is dedicated to the display of objects excavated by the Atlas Arqueológico de Guatemala within the southeastern Petén region.&lt;ref name="SierraGarcia08p55"/&gt; It displays approximately 125 [[Maya ceramics|ceramic]] pieces and eight stone sculptures.&lt;ref name="Corzo05p724"/&gt; The display of artefacts is divided into periods, ranging from the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Preclassic]] through to the Postclassic,&lt;ref name="Corzo07p89"/&gt; covering a span from 900 BC through to 1524 AD.&lt;ref name="Corzo07p89"/&gt; The collection is not limited to the [[Municipalities of Guatemala|municipality]] of Dolores, it also includes pieces from the municipalities of [[La Libertad, El Petén|La Libertad]], [[Melchor de Mencos]], [[Poptún]], San Luis, [[Santa Ana, El Petén|Santa Ana]] and [[San Francisco, El Petén|San Francisco]].&lt;ref name="Corzo07p89"&gt;Corzo 2007, p.89.&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-two archaeological sites are represented at the museum, they include Calzada Mopan, Copoja, Curucuitz, [[El Chal]], El Ocote, El Reinado, Itzimte, Ix Ak, Ixcoxol, Ix Ek', [[Ixkun]], [[Ixtonton]], [[Ixtutz]], La Gloria-Sacul, Limones, [[Machaquila]], Maringa, Pueblito, [[Sacul, El Petén|Sacul]], Suk Che', [[Ucanal]] and Yaltutu.&lt;ref name="Corzo07p89"/&gt; There are also pieces recovered from the caves of Aktun Ak'ab, Balam Na and El Chapayal.&lt;ref name="Corzo07p89"/&gt;

This item (catalogue number PSPA-625) is a ceramic vase excavated from the ruins of Curucuitz.&lt;ref name="Corzo05p757"&gt;Corzo 2005, p.757.&lt;/ref&gt; It was found buried in the North Structure of Group 24, where it was associated with a burial.&lt;ref name="Corzo05p757"/&gt; the vase has been dated to the Late Classic and is of the Paixban variety of the Paixban Ante Polychrome ceramic type, belonging to the Zacatal-Joyac ceramic group.&lt;ref name="Corzo05p757"/&gt;
{{clear}}

===Vase from Sacul===
[[File:Sacul vase.jpg|thumb|left|upright]]
This ceramic vase (catalogue number PSPA-708) was excavated from the ruins of [[Sacul, El Petén|Sacul]].&lt;ref&gt;Corzo 2005, p.758. Laporte &amp; Mejía 2006, p.215.&lt;/ref&gt; The piece is of the Palmar variety of the Palmar-Naranja Polychrome type, belonging to the Palmar-Danta ceramic group.&lt;ref name="Corzo05p758"&gt;Corzo 2005, p.758.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been dated to the Late Classic Period.&lt;ref name="Corzo05p758"/&gt; It was a funerary offering accompanying Burial 193 at Sacul, it was interred in front of Structure 1 of Group 26 of that city.&lt;ref name="LaporteMejia06p192"&gt;Laporte &amp; Mejía 2006, p.192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The vase was a drinking vessel for chocolate and depicts a mythological scene featuring the young [[Maya moon goddess|Moon goddess]], who carries a rabbit in her arms.&lt;ref name="LaporteMejia06p215"&gt;Laporte &amp; Mejía 2006, p.215.&lt;/ref&gt; The goddess is seated upon a throne, which is decorated with a celestial band.&lt;ref name="LaporteMejia06p215"/&gt; Below her are three jars of [[pulque]].&lt;ref name="LaporteMejia06p215"/&gt; Only about half of the original scene has survived, and the text next to the goddess is illegible.&lt;ref name="LaporteMejia06p215"/&gt; Only slight traces remain of a second person seated upon the same throne, to the left of the Moon goddess.&lt;ref name="LaporteMejia06p215"/&gt; Two rows of supernatural beings are seated on the floor before the throne, indicating that they are visiting the enthroned principal figures.&lt;ref name="LaporteMejia06p216"/&gt; Three of these visitors can be identified, including two versions of God N, represented as separate individuals, and a being that is a man-bird hybrid.&lt;ref name="LaporteMejia06p216"/&gt; These figures are also accompanied by hieroglyphs, although they are also illegible.&lt;ref name="LaporteMejia06p216"/&gt; The vase includes a dedicatory [[Maya script|hieroglyphic text]] around the rim that identifies it as the drinking vessel of a lord of the city of [[Naranjo]].&lt;ref name="LaporteMejia06p216"&gt;Laporte &amp; Mejía 2006, p.216.&lt;/ref&gt;

The vase appears to represent a scene from [[Maya mythology]] in which the rabbit steals a magic hat, clothing and tribute from [[God L]] (Itsamaat). God L visits the palace of his grandson [[Kinich Ahau|K'inich Ahau]], the Sun god, who informs him that the rabbit is with the Moon goddess.&lt;ref name="LaporteMejia06p216"/&gt;

[[File:Riesenberg Nobbin.jpg|thumb|Riesenberg barrow from the east]]

'''Nobbin''' is a village in the municipality of [[Putgarten]] on the [[Wittow]] peninsula on the German [[Baltic Sea]] island of  [[Rügen]]. The village, comprising just a few houses, lies between the road from [[Altenkirchen (Rügen)|Altenkirchen]] to [[Cape Arkona|Arkona]] and the bay of [[Tromper Wiek]]. As a result of its attractive location between Cape Arkona and the broad, over 10&amp;nbsp;km long beach of the [[Schaabe]], the village is dominated by tourism (B&amp;Bs and holiday apartments).

== Riesenberg barrow ==
Nobbin is best known for the [[megalithic tomb]] known as the ''Riesenberg'' (also ''Großsteingrab Riesenberg''). The tomb was constructed of [[glacial erratic]] boulders and dates back to the [[New Stone Age]] in Rügen. It is one of the largest stone graves in  North Germany and lies just a few metres from the [[steep coast]] on the bay of [[Tromper Wiek]], immediately by the cliff top path ({{Coord|54|39|11|N|13|23|36|E|type:landmark_region:DE-MV}}). 

The trapezoidal enclosure, which originally had 53 large boundary stones, is 34 metres long and 8 to 11 metres wide (39 stones have survived). In the north-east were two transverse [[dolmens]], of which only one is well preserved. It is 1.4 metres high, 1.8 metres long and 1.1 metres wide. On the southwest side two [[guardian stone]]s (''Wächtersteine'') in front of the enclosure rise to a height of over 3 metres, otherwise they are typical, especially of [[Scandinavia]]n [[dolmens]], but also similar in dimensions to the [[Dolmens of Dwasieden]] and those in Dummertevitz on Rügen. The presence of guardian stones is rare in Germany, but is explained by the proximity of the site to the Danish islands.

During excavations in 1970 by [[Ewald Schuldt]], Neolithic finds were made: three crosscutting (''querschneidende'') [[arrowhead]]s, a sword, some broken vessels and a few bone fragments (including two skulls). In the northern grave chamber were the remains of an [[funerary urn|urn burial]] from the 5th century B.C. Between the guardian stones were shards of pottery from the Slavic era [[Rani (Slavic tribe)|Rani tribe]] and an [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabic]] [[silver]] coin from the 9th century, amongst other things. This showed that the ''Riesenberg'' was a significant site for the island inhabitants for  millennia.{{cn|date=December 2013}}

==Colonial era==
===Established and voluntary religion===
{{Main|History of religion in the United States}}
Taxes from local and colonial government supported the established churches in New England, which were Congregational, and in the South, which were Anglican.  A much faster rate of growth appeared in entirely voluntary religious denominations, especially the Methodists and Baptists, and among the Presbyterians especially on the frontier.  German and Dutch immigrants supported their Reformed churches in Pennsylvania and New York without tax money.&lt;ref&gt; Patricia U. Bonomi, ''Under the Cope of Heaven: Religion, Society, and Politics in Colonial America'' (1988)  [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=90445659 online edition] &lt;/ref&gt;

The first corporation founded in the [[13 Colonies]] was [[Harvard College]] (1636), designed primarily to them train young men for the clergy.  A leading theorist was the Puritan theologian [[Cotton Mather]] (1662-1728), who in 1710 published a widely read essay, ''Bonifacius, or an Essay to Do Good.'' Mather worried that the original idealism had eroded, so he advocated philanthropic benefaction as a way of life. Though his context was Christian, his idea was also characteristically American and explicitly Classical, on the threshold of the Enlightenment.
:Let no man pretend to the Name of A Christian, who does not Approve the proposal of A Perpetual Endeavour to Do Good in the World.… The Christians who have no Ambition to be [useful], Shall be condemned by the Pagans; among whom it was a Term of the Highest Honour, to be termed, A Benefactor; to have Done Good, was accounted Honourable. The Philosopher [i.e., Aristotle ], being asked why Every one desired so much to look upon a Fair Object! He answered That it was a Question of a Blind man. If any man ask, as wanting the Sense of it, What is it worth the while to Do Good in the world! I must Say, It Sounds not like the Question of a Good man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cotton Mather|title=Essays to do Good addressed to all Christians, whether in public or private capacities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oNllAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA51|year=1825|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mather’s many practical suggestions for doing good had strong civic emphases—founding schools, libraries, hospitals, useful publications, etc. They were not primarily about rich people helping poor people, but about private initiatives for public good, focusing on quality of life. Two young Americans whose prominent lives, they later said, were influenced by Mather’s book, were Benjamin Franklin and Paul Revere.

===Ethnic and religious groups===
Voluntary charitable organizations established by ethnic and religious groups, for their own people, originated in the colonial era and crew much stronger in the 19th century.  As assimilation took place  most of the European groups merged into a general "American" population; the ethnic charitable societies sharply declined by 1900.  Minority ethnic groups and races that did not amalgamate extensively continued their separate operations, as did religious charities into the 21st century.

The Puritans of New England and the Quakers  Of Pennsylvania were the pioneers before 1700 in establishing charitable institutions, philanthropic operations, and their own schools. Eventually most of the many religious denominations set up charitable institutions as well as their own seminaries or colleges.  The first ethnic group to mobilize served as a model for many others – it was the [[Scots Charitable Society of Boston]], started in 1657.  In 1754 the  Episcopal Charitable Society of Boston Was oriented toward recent English immigrants.  In 1768, the Charitable Irish Society of Boston opened for Irish Protestants.  Eventually German and French immigrants set up their own benevolent societies.&lt;ref&gt; Walter I. Trattner, ''From Poor Law to Welfare State'' (6th ed. 1999) pp 30-35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erna Risch, "Immigrant aid societies before 1820." ''Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography'' 60#1 (1936): 15-33. [https://journals.psu.edu/pmhb/article/viewFile/28387/28143 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benjamin Franklin===
[[Benjamin Franklin]] (1706 – 1790) was an activist and theorist of American philanthropy.  He was much influenced by [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''An essay upon projects'' (1697) and Mather's ''Bonifacius''.  Franklin specialized in motivating his fellow Philadelphians into projects for the betterment of the city.  As a young tradesman in 1727, he formed the "[[Junto (club)|Junto]]": a 12-member club that weekly to consider current issues and needs. One of the qualifications for membership was the "love [of] mankind in general". In 1729 he founded a weekly newspaper the ''Philadelphia Gazette'', and for the next thirty years he used the Junto as a sort of think-tank to generate and vet philanthropic ideas, and the ''Gazette'' to test and mobilize public support, recruit volunteers, and fund-raise. his system Led to the creation of  America'sAmerica’s first subscription library (1731), a volunteer fire association, a fire insurance association,  (1752—through fundraising with a challenge grant), the paving and patrolling of public streets, the finance and construction of a civic meeting house, and many others.  A world-class physicist himself, he promoted scientific organizations including the Philadelphia Academy (1751)--which became the [[University of Pennsylvania]] – as well as the [[American Philosophical Society]] (1743) to enable scientific researchers from all 13 colonies to communicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert T. Grimm, ed.|title=Notable American Philanthropists: Biographies of Giving and Volunteering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIdSBOiSazsC&amp;pg=PA101|year=2002|pages=100–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fellow diplomat [[John Adams]] reported that in France "there was scarcely a peasant or citizen" who "did not consider him as a friend to humankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David McCullough|title=John Adams|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-sTrTHz8oMC&amp;pg=PT250|year=2012|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==19th century==
The new nation had weak national, state and local governments.  A strong civil society was built by Volunteers in a culture of collaboration. French observer [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] called them, "voluntary associations." They permeated American life, as a distinguishing feature of the American character and culture, they were the key to American democracy.  Americans, he said, did not rely on others—government, an aristocracy, or the church—to solve their public problems; rather, they did it themselves, through voluntary associations, which is to say, philanthropy, which was characteristically democratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bob Edwards et al.|title=Beyond Tocqueville: Civil Society and the Social Capital Debate in Comparative Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_U196GHkto0C&amp;pg=PA23|year=2001|publisher=UP of New England|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1820s, newly rich American businessmen were establishing philanthropic work, especially with respect to private colleges and hospitals.   [[George Peabody]] (1795-1869) was the acknowledged father of modern philanthropy. A financier based in Baltimore and London, in the 1860s, he began to endowi libraries and museums in the United Statesl he also funded housing for poor people in London. He was the model for Andrew Carnegie and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Grimm, ed.|title=Notable American Philanthropists: Biographies of Giving and Volunteering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIdSBOiSazsC&amp;pg=PA244|year=2002|pages=243–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Schaaf, “George Peabody: His Life and Legacy, 1795–1869,” ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 90#3 (1995) pp 268-285. &lt;/ref&gt;  

In the Jewish community, ethnic and religious identities overlapped heavily, Although there was a sharp dichotomy. By the 1850s thye German-based Reform Jewish community was well established. It operated operated retail stores and banks in small towns and cities across the country and practically owned the garment industry. They were typically conservative Republicans.  In sharp contrast after 1880 came a much poorer, Yiddish-based Orthodox Jewish immigration that at first heavily concentrated in New York City. It included the garment workers employed by German Jews, and strongly supported socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Moses Rischin, ''The Promised City: New York's Jews, 1870-1914'' (1962) pp 95-111.&lt;/ref&gt;  The German element set up extensive charitable institutions; generously giving money and volunteer time of charity a high prestige activity.  By 1920 the German and Yiddish elements were far apart in religion, but were coming together in terms of philanthropy and charity.&lt;ref&gt;Hasia R. Diner, ''The Jews of the United States, 1654 to 2000'' (2004) pp 135-38.&lt;/ref&gt;  Representative of many charitable organizations in New York was the [[United Hebrew Charities]] (UHC).  It was founded in 1874 by the merger of numerous older German Jewish groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Adam, ed.|title=Germany and the Americas: G-N|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8uxfTF4Lm-kC&amp;pg=PA16|year=2005|pages=16-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1890 it was oriented toward  the poor Yiddish element, providing 15,000 house calls by doctors and nurses, giving out 5600 prescriptions and 440 bottles of cod liver oil.  After several more mergers it continues to still operate as the [[Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services]].&lt;ref&gt; Marvin Olasky, ''The Tragedy of American Compassion'' (1992) pp 84-85&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local millionaires===
By the late 19th century, about a third of the successful local businessman were making philanthropic donations.  [[Albert Shaw (journalist)|Albert Shaw]] editor of the magazine ''[[Review of Reviews|American Review of Reviews]]'' in 1893 examined philanthropic activities of millionaires in several major cities.  The highest rate was Baltimore where 49% of the millionaires were active givers; New York City ranked last.  Cincinnati millionaires favored musical and artistic ventures; Minneapolis millionaires gave to the state university in the public library; Philadelphians often gave to overseas relief, and the education of blacks and Indians.  Boston had a weak profile, apart from donations to Harvard and the Massachusetts General Hospital.   &lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Bremner, ''American philanthropy'' (U of Chicago Press, 1988) p 109; full text of Albert Shaw, "American Millionaires and Their Public Gifts," ''Review of Reviews''  (February 1893), pp 48-60 [https://sites.hks.harvard.edu/fs/phall/04.%20Bostonization.pdf is online here &lt;/ref&gt;  Railroad leaders seldom focused on local issues, since they had responsibility for much larger territories.  They approve the work of the [[YMCA|railroad YMCAs]] in uplifting the labor force, though they seldom gave them any corporate money. One exception came in 1882 when the president of the Illinois Central  Railroad provided a salary of $50 a month for six months for a YMCA Evangelist in Cairo, Illinois, hoping "he will be able to accomplish some good in that ungodly place."  Executives rarely used the railroad's financial resources for philanthropic goals. Occasionally they donated land for public schools or colleges, assuming it would have a positive impact on the selling price of their nearby lands.&lt;ref&gt; Thomas C. Cochran, ''Railroad leaders, 1845 - 1890; the business mind in action'' (1953) pp 210-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carnegie-1903.jpg|thumb|[[Andrew Carnegie]]'s philanthropy. ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' magazine cartoon by [[Louis Dalrymple]], 1903]]

=== Andrew Carnegie===
[[Andrew Carnegie]] (1835–1919) was the most influential leader of philanthropy on a national (rather than local) scale. After selling his giant steel company in the 1890s he devoted himself to establishing philanthropic organizations, and making direct contributions to many educational cultural and research institutions. His final and largest project was the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]], founded in 1911 with a $25 million endowment, later enlarged to $135 million. In all he gave away $350 million, or 90% of his fortune.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Frazier Wall, '' Andrew Carnegie'' (1970) pp 882-84.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The establishment of [[public library|public libraries]] in the United States, Britain, and in dominions and colonies of the British Empire started a legacy that still operates on a daily basis for millions of people. The first [[Carnegie library]]  opened in 1883 in Dunfermline, Scotland. His method was to build and stock a modern library,on condition that the local authority provided site and keep it in operation. In 1885, he gave $500,000 to Pittsburgh for a public library, and in 1886, he gave $250,000 to Allegheny City for a music hall and library, and $250,000 to [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, for a free library. In total Carnegie gave $55 million to some 3,000 libraries, in 47 American states and overseas.  As VanSlyck (1991) shows, the last years of the 19th century saw acceptance of the idea that libraries should be available to the American public free of charge. However the design of the idealized free library was at the center of a prolonged and heated debate. On one hand, the library profession called for designs that supported efficiency in administration and operation; on the other, wealthy philanthropists favored buildings that reinforced the paternalistic metaphor and enhanced civic pride. Between 1886 and 1917, Carnegie reformed both library philanthropy and library design, encouraging a closer correspondence between the two. Using the corporation as his model, Carnegie introduced many of the philanthropic practices of the modern foundation. At the same time, he rejected the rigid social and spatial hierarchy of the 19th-century library. In over 1,600 buildings that he funded and in hundreds of others influenced by its forms, Carnegie helped create an American public library type that embraced the planning principles espoused by librarians while extending a warmer welcome to the reading public.&lt;ref&gt;Abigail A. VanSlyck, "'The Utmost Amount of Effectiv Accommodation': Andrew Carnegie and the Reform of the American Library", ''Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians'' (1991) 50#4 pp. 359–383 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/990662 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Mickelson, . "American society and the public library in the thought of Andrew Carnegie." ''Journal of Library History'' 10.2 (1975): 117-138. &lt;/ref&gt;  There was some opposition, for example in Canada where anti-American and labour spokesman opposed his libraries, in fear of the influence of a powerful American, and in protest against his breaking a strike in 1892.&lt;ref&gt; Susan Goldenberg, "Dubious Donations," ''Beaver" (May 2008) 88#2 pp 34-40 &lt;/ref&gt;  

Carnegie was in fact transforming his wealth into cultural power independent of Governmental or political controls.  However he transcended national boundaries – he identified so much with Britain that at one point he thought of running for Parliament.  In Canada and Britain he worked with like-minded local intellectual and cultural leaders who shared his basic values to promote an urgently needed Canadian or British cultural, intellectual, and educational infrastructure. In those countries, the rich industrialists rarely supported national philanthropy.&lt;ref&gt; Jeffrey D. Brison, ''Rockefeller, Carnegie, and Canada: American Philanthropy and the Arts and Letters in Canada'' (McGill-Queen's UP, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  He also set up numerous permanent foundations, especially in pursuit of world peace, such as the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] formed in 1910 with a $10 million endowment.&lt;ref&gt; David S. Patterson,"Andrew Carnegie's quest for world peace." ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 114.5 (1970): 371-383. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/985802 online] &lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Gospel of Wealth]]'' (1889), Carnegie proselytized the rich about their responsibilities to society.&lt;ref&gt; Andrew Carnegie, "Wealth." ''The North American Review'' Vol. 148, No. 391 (June, 1889), pp. 653-664 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25101798 online]&lt;/ref&gt; His homily had an enormous influence in its day, and into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Moody|author2=Beth Breeze, eds. |title=The Philanthropy Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pzQlDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA171|year=2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; David Callahan, ''The Givers: Wealth, Power, and Philanthropy in a New Gilded Age'' (2017); p 218 tells how [[Warren Buffett]] gave a copy of Carnegie's essay to [[Bill Gates]].&lt;/ref&gt;  One early disciple was [[Phoebe Hearst]], wife of the founder of the Hearst dynasty in San Francisco.  She expanded the Carnegie approach to include women declaring that leisured women had a sacred duty to give to causes, especially progressive education and reform, that would benefit their communities, help those excluded or marginalized from America's mainstream, and advance women's careers as reformers and political leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra M. Nickliss, "Phoebe Apperson Hearst's" Gospel of Wealth," 1883––1901." ''Pacific Historical Review'' 71.4 (2002): 575-605. &lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent American philanthropists of the early 20th century were John D. Rockefeller and his son, [[Julius Rosenwald]] (1862-1932)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Grimm, ed.|title=Notable American Philanthropists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIdSBOiSazsC&amp;pg=PA279|year=2002|pages=277–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter M. Ascoli, ''Julius Rosenwald: The Man Who Built Sears, Roebuck and Advanced the Cause of Black Education in the American South'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage]] (1828-1918)&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Crocker, ''Mrs. Russell Sage Women's Activism and Philanthropy in Gilded Age and Progressive Era America'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;. 
===Rockefeller network===
The senior [[John D. Rockefeller]] (1839-1937)  retired from business in the 1890s; he and his son [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] (1874-1960) made large-scale national philanthropy systematic especially regarding the study and application of modern medicine, higher, education and scientific research.  Of the $530 million the elder Rockefeller gave away, $450 million went to medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Johnson and John Ensor Harr, ''The Rockefeller Century: Three Generations of America's Greatest Family'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;  Their  top advisor [[Frederick Taylor Gates]] designed several very large philanthropies that were staffed by experts who designed ways to attack problems systematically rather than let the recipients decide how to deal with the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dwight Burlingame|title=Philanthropy in America: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia, vol 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lSakKhqTy70C&amp;pg=PA419|year=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the largest of the Rockefeller philanthropies was the [[General Education Board]] which focused on higher education medical school, and Uplift of the poverty-stricken rural South, both black and white.  It funded rural schools, helped modernize farming practices, and work hard to eradicate hookworm [[hookworm]]. It promoted the county agent system run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture that brought research from state [[agricultural experiment station]]s into actual operation on millions of farms.  Rockefeller gave it $180 million starting in 1903. Its head Frederick Gates envisioned "The Country School of To-Morrow," wherein "young and old will be taught in practicable ways how to make rural life beautiful, intelligent, fruitful, recreative, healthful, and joyous."&lt;ref&gt;Frederick T. Gates. "The Country School Of To-Morrow," ''Occasional Papers,'' No. 1 (1913) [https://books.google.com/books?id=aaygAAAAMAAJ online]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1934 the Board was making grants of $5.5 million a year. It spent nearly all its money by 1950 and closed in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Blaine Fosdick, ''Adventures in Giving: The Story of the General Education Board'' (1962). &lt;/ref&gt;

===Hoover in Europe===

The [[Commission for Relief in Belgium]] (CRB) was an international (predominantly American) organization that arranged for the supply of food to German-occupied Belgium and northern France during the First World War.  It was led by [[Herbert Hoover]].&lt;ref&gt;George H. Nash, "An American Epic: Herbert Hoover and Belgian Relief in World War I," ''Prologue'' (1989) 21#1 pp 75-86&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1914 and 1919, the CRB operated entirely with voluntary efforts and was able to feed 11,000,000 Belgians by raising the necessary money, obtaining voluntary contributions of money and food, shipping the food to Belgium and controlling its there, For example, the CRB shipped 697,116,000 pounds of flour to Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;David Burner, ''Herbert Hoover: The Public Life'' (1979) pp 72-95.&lt;/ref&gt;   Biographer George Nash finds that by the end of 1916, Hoover "stood preeminent in the greatest humanitarian undertaking the world had ever seen."&lt;ref&gt;George H. Nash, ''The Life of Herbert Hoover: The Humanitarian, 1914-1917'' (1988) p 249. &lt;/ref&gt;  Biographer William Leuchtenburg adds, "He had raised and spent millions of dollars, with trifling overhead and not a penny lost to fraud. At its peak, his organization was feeding nine million Belgians and French a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William E. Leuchtenburg|title=Herbert Hoover'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7bXY94wxD2EC&amp;pg=PA30|year=2009|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the U.S. entered the war President Wilson gave  Hoover charge of the American food supply.

When the war ended in late 1918, Wilson gave Hoover control of the [[American Relief Administration]] (ARA), with the mission of finding food and coal for Central and Eastern Europe. The ARA fed millions.&lt;ref&gt; Burner, ''Hoover'' pp 114-37.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. government funding of $100 million for the ARA expired in the summer of 1919, and Hoover transformed the ARA into a private organization, raising millions of dollars from private donors. He had numerous efficient aides, such as [[Anson Goodyear]], who handled coal supplies in Austria, Hungary and Poland.  According to Kendrick Clements: 
:The gregarious, energetic, and ingenious Goodyear cheerfully accepted Hoover's orders to do anything necessary to get the coal moving.  Employing his native charm and his authority to provide or withhold food shipments, he calmed strikes and opened borders.  At one point, he got Hoover to send him $25,000 worth of tobacco to distribute among miners.  Within a month, his unorthodox methods contributed to doubling coal production in Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kendrick A.

Under the auspices of the ARA, the European Children's Fund fed millions of starving children.  When attacked for distributing food to Russia, which was under Bolshevik control, Hoover snapped,  "Twenty million people are starving. Whatever their politics, they shall be fed!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leuchtenburg|title=Herbert Hoover'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7bXY94wxD2EC&amp;pg=PA58|year=2009|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Frank M.

===Ford Foundation===
{{Main|Ford Foundation}}
The Ford Foundation was founded in 1936, and after the deaths of Edsel Ford and Henry Ford it was given by the family all of the non-voting shares of the Ford Motor Company.  The family kept all the voting shares, which although far fewer in number, assured its continuous control of the corporation. Ford's profits, dividends, and increases in stock value went overwhelmingly to the Foundation.  In 1950 the family gave up control of the Foundation, Keeping a few seats on the board until 1976.  In 1955 the Foundation sold most of its Ford shares.  By then it passed the Rockefeller Foundation to become the largest philanthropy, with very large scale projects in the United States and around the world.  Domestically, it focused on inner-city revitalization, the development of [[National Educational Television |public broadcasting]], and support for the arts.  It invested heavily in graduate training programs in American and European research universities, especially in promoting international studies.  Civil rights and aid to minority groups became a major priority after 1950. It started with an effort had building minority communities and promoting integration. However by the 1970s it had switched to a top-down strategy of training new minority leaders. One result was the support for [[Black Power]] elements hostile to integration, such as [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]], as well as black studies programs on campuses. Another was resentment especially as Jewish leaders were pushed out of the civil rights movement by the new black generation.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Ferguson,  "Organizing the Ghetto: The Ford Foundation, CORE, and White Power in the Black Power Era, 1967–1969." ''Journal of Urban History'' 34#1 (2007): 67-100; expanded in Karen Ferguson, ''Top Down: The Ford Foundation, Black Power, and the Reinvention of Racial Liberalism'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;   Outside the United States,  it established a network of human rights organizations, promoted democracy, gave large numbers of fellowships for young leaders to study in the United States.

During the past few years, computer entrepreneur [[Bill Gates]], who co-founded Microsoft, and billionaire investor and [[Berkshire Hathaway]] Chairman [[Warren Buffett]] have donated many billions of dollars to charity and have challenged their wealthy peers to donate half of their assets to philanthropic causes.  The [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] has led campaigns to eradicate [[malaria]] and [[river blindness]], and Buffett donation $31 billion in 2006 to the Gates Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-20|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13541144/|title=Gates: Buffett gift may help cure worst diseases|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=2006-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century efforts==
Trends in philanthropy have been affected in various ways by a technological and cultural change. Today, many [[donations]] are made through the [[Internet]] (see also [[Donation#Donating statistics|donation statistics]]).&lt;ref name=OnlineBlack&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.blackbaud.com/files/resources/downloads/WhitePaper_2011OnlineGivingReport.pdf|format=PDF|work=blackbaud.com|title=The 2011 Online Giving Report, presented by Steve MacLaughlin, Jim O'Shaughnessy, and Allison Van Diest|date=February 2012|accessdate= January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Indiana University]] Center on Philanthropy has reported that approximately 65% of household earning $100,000 or less donate to charity, and nearly every household exceeding that amount donated to charity.&lt;ref name=wsj20120915&gt;{{cite news|last=Pallotta|first=Dan|title=Why Can't We Sell Charity Like We sell Perfume?|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=September 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; More particularly, according to studies by the [[Chronicle of Philanthropy]], the rich (those making over $100,000 a year) give a smaller share, averaging 4.2%, to charity than those poorer (between $50,000 - $75,000 a year), who give an average of 7.6%.&lt;ref name="CNBC-20120820"&gt;{{cite news |last=Frank |first=Robert |title=The Rich Are Less Charitable Than the Middle Class: Study |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/48725147 |date=August 20, 2012 |work=[[CNBC]] |accessdate=February 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HP-20120821"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kavoussi |first=Bonnie |title=Rich People Give A Smaller Share Of Their Income To Charity Than Middle-Class Americans Do |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/21/rich-people-charitable-giving_n_1819142.html |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |accessdate=February 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Religious satire''' is a form of [[satire]] targeted at [[religious]] [[belief]]s.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009npn"/&gt; From the earliest times, at least since the plays of [[Aristophanes]], religion has been one of the three primary topics of literary satire, along with [[politics]] and [[sex]].&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"&gt;Clark (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=LOeLRDzui_wC&amp;pg=PA116 pp.116-8] quotation: {{quotation|...religion, politics, and sexuality are the primary stuff of literary satire. Among these sacret targets, matters costive and defecatory play an important part. ... from the earliest times, satirists have utilized scatological and bathroom humor. Aristophanes, always livid and nearly scandalous in his religious, political, and sexual references...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark73p20"&gt;Clark, John R. and Motto, Anna Lydia (1973) [https://books.google.com/books?id=A5NZAAAAMAAJ ''Satire--that blasted art''] p.20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark80p45"&gt;Clark, John R. and Motto, Anna Lydia (1980) [https://books.google.com/books?id=SnwhAQAAIAAJ ''Menippeans &amp; Their Satire: Concerning Monstrous Leamed Old Dogs and Hippocentaurs''], in Scholia satyrica, Volume 6, 3/4, 1980 p.45 quotation: {{quotation|[Chapple's book ''Soviet satire of the twenties'']...classifying the very ''topics'' his satirists satirized: housing, food, and fuel supplies, poverty, inflation, "hooliganism", public services, religion, stereotypes of nationals (the Englishman, German, &amp;c), &amp;c. Yet the truth of the matter is that no satirist worth his salt (Petronius, Chaucer, Rabelais, Swift, Leskov, Grass) ever avoids man's habits and living standards, or scants those delicate desiderata: religion, politics, and sex.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satire which targets the [[clergy]] is a type of [[political satire]], while religious satire is that which targets religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009npn"&gt;Hodgart (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=dGrCooK63TsC&amp;pg=PA39 p.39]&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious satire is also sometimes called philosophical satire. Religious satire can be the result of [[agnosticism]] or [[atheism]]. Religious satire surfaced during the [[Renaissance]], with works by Chaucer, Erasmus and Durer.

==Reactions, criticism and censorship==

Religious satire has been criticised by those who feel that sincerely held religious views should not 
be subject to ridicule.  In some cases religious satire has been censored - for example, Molière's play ''[[Tartuffe]]'' was banned in 1664.

The film ''[[Life of Brian]]'' was initially banned in Ireland, Norway, some states of the US, and some towns and councils of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/mid/7530542.stm Vicar supports Life of Brian ban]&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interesting case of life mirroring art, activist groups who protested the film during its release bore striking similarities to some bands of religious zealots within the film itself.&lt;ref&gt;Dyke, C: ''Screening Scripture'', pp. 238-240. Trinity Press International, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  Like much religious satire, the intent of the film has been misinterpreted and distorted by protesters.  According to the [[Monty Python|Pythons]], ''Life of Brian'' is not a critique of religion so much as an indictment of the hysteria and bureaucratic excess that often surrounds it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Secret Life of Brian |year= 2007 |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDCAJTrF1gg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of [[freedom of speech]] was hotly debated by the UK Parliament during the passing of the [[Religious Hatred Bill]] in January 2006. Critics of the original version of the Bill (such as comedian [[Rowan Atkinson]]) feared that satirists could be prosecuted, but an amendment by the [[House of Lords]] making it clear that this was not the case was passed - by just one vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Votes on the Racial and Religious Hatred Bill | year = 2006 | url = http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/search.php?query=racial+and+religious+hatred+bill }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Church of the SubGenius#Legal matters|Rachel Bevilacqua]], a member of the [[Church of the SubGenius]], known as Rev. Magdalen in the SubGenius hierarchy, lost custody and contact with her son after a district court judge took offense at her participation in the Church's [[X-Day (Church of the SubGenius)|X-Day]] festival.

[[Richard Dawkins]] frequently points out that there is no reason to exclude religion from objective studying like any other social phenomena.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

In the [[United States]], the '''school-to-prison pipeline (SPP)''', also known as the '''''school-to-prison link''''' or the '''''schoolhouse-to-jailhouse track''''', is the disproportionate tendency of minors and young adults from disadvantaged backgrounds to become incarcerated, because of increasingly harsh school and municipal policies. Many experts have credited factors such as [[School disturbance laws|school disturbance laws]], [[Zero tolerance (schools)|zero tolerance policies and practices]], and an increase in [[School resource officer|police in schools]] in creating the ''pipeline''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ870076.pdf|title = Education or Incarceration: Zero Tolerance Policies and the School to Prison Pipeline|last = Heitzeg|first = Nancy|date = 2009|journal = Forum on Public Policy Online|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has become a hot topic of debate in discussions surrounding educational disciplinary policies as media coverage of youth violence and mass incarceration has grown during the early 21st century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGrew|first=Ken|date=2016-06-01|title=The Dangers of Pipeline Thinking: How the School-To-Prison Pipeline Metaphor Squeezes Out Complexity|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/edth.12173/abstract|journal=Educational Theory|language=en|volume=66|issue=3|pages=341–367|doi=10.1111/edth.12173|issn=1741-5446}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=G.|first=Richardson, John|last2=Douglas|first2=Judge,|date=2013-01-01|title=The Intergroup Dynamics of a Metaphor: The School-to-Prison Pipeline|url=http://cedar.wwu.edu/jec/vol7/iss1/9|journal=Journal of Educational Controversy|volume=7|issue=1|issn=1935-7699}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Mora and Mary Christianakis.

The current sociopolitical climate, relating to [[mass incarceration]] in the United States, serves as a critical component in increasing the contact the incarceration system has with the United States education system, as patterns of [[criminalization]] translate into the school context.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Specific practices implemented in United States schools over the past ten years to reduce [[violence in schools]], including zero tolerance policies and an increase in [[School resource officer|School Resource Officers]] have created the environment for criminalization of youth in schools. This results from patterns of discipline in schools mirroring law enforcement models.

The disciplinary policies and practices that create an environment for the United States school-to-prison link to occur disproportionately affect disabled, Latino and Black students which is later reflected in the rates of incarceration. Between 1999 and 2007, the percentage of black students being suspended has increased by twelve percent, while the percentage of white students being suspended has declined since the implementation of zero tolerance policies.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Zero Benefit Estimating the Effect of Zero Tolerance Discipline Policies on Racial Disparities in School Discipline|url = http://epx.sagepub.com/content/28/1/69|journal = Educational Policy|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 0895-9048|pages = 69–95|volume = 28|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/0895904812453999|first = Stephen|last = Hoffman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the total incarcerated population in the United States, 61% are Black or Latino.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== History == 

[[File:U.S. incarceration rates 1925 onwards.png|thumb|350px|A graph of the incarceration rate under state and federal jurisdiction per 100,000 population 1925–2008 (omits local jail inmates). The '''male incarceration rate''' (''top line'') is roughly 15 times the '''female rate''' (''bottom line'').]]

For the half-century prior to 1975 the incarceration rate in the U.S. was fairly constant at roughly 0.1 percent of the population, as indicated in the accompanying figure.  

Enough of the changes listed here as possible drivers of the "school-to-prison pipeline" occurred during the last quarter of the twentieth century and may have been large enough to explain this increase.  Any changes since 2000 that might contribute to this phenomenon are either too minor to have such a macro effect or were too recent to be reflected in these numbers yet.

== Causes ==
{{See also|Zero tolerance (schools)}}

Exclusionary disciplinary policies, specifically zero tolerance policies, that remove students from the school environment increase the probability of a youth coming into contact with the incarceration system.  Approximately 3.3 million suspensions and over 100,000 expulsions occur each year. This number has nearly doubled since 1974, with rates escalating in the mid-1990s as zero tolerance policies began to be widely adopted. Rising rates of the use of expulsion and suspension are not connected to higher rates of misbehaviors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Zero tolerance policies are discussed in more detail later in the article, in the Current policies maintaining the link section.

Research is increasingly beginning to examine the connections between school failure and later contact with the criminal justice system for minorities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = UNDERSTANDING THE ANTECEDENTS OF THE "SCHOOL-TO-JAIL" LINK: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RACE AND SCHOOL DISCIPLINE|journal = The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology (1973-)|date = 2011-04-01|pages = 633–665|volume = 101|issue = 2|first = MICHAEL|last = ROCQUE|first2 = RAYMOND|last2 = PATERNOSTER|jstor=23074048}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once a child drops out, they are eight times more likely to be incarcerated than youth who graduate from high school.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-428998147/building-staffing-and-insulating-an-architecture|title = Building, Staffing, and Insulating: An Architecture of Criminological Complicity in the School-to-Prison Pipeline|last = Schept, Wall, Brisman|first = Judah, Tyler, Avi|date = 2015|journal = Social Justice|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found that 68% of all males in state and federal prison do not have a high school diploma.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fact Sheet: How Bad Is the School-to-Prison Pipeline? {{!}} Tavis Smiley Reports {{!}} PBS|url = https://www.pbs.org/wnet/tavissmiley/tsr/education-under-arrest/school-to-prison-pipeline-fact-sheet/|website = Tavis Smiley {{!}} PBS|accessdate = 2015-11-09|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Suspensions and expulsions have been shown to correlate with a young person's probability of dropping out and becoming involved with the criminal justice system. However, it is unclear if the factors determining the risk of dropping out are not wholly or partially the same as the factors determining the risk of incarceration as an individual likely to enter the criminal justice system is also likely to encounter difficulties within the education system.

From 1980 to 2008, the number of people incarcerated in the United States quadrupled from roughly 500,000 to 2.3 million people.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Criminal Justice Fact Sheet|url = http://www.naacp.org/pages/criminal-justice-fact-sheet|website = www.naacp.org|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graphic to the right shows the uniqueness of this practice in comparison to other countries across the globe, with the United States incarcerating a larger portion of its population than any other country in 2008. The United States holds 25% of the world's prisoners, but only has 5% of the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The School-to-Prison Pipeline: The Business Side of Incarcerating, Not Educating, Students in Public Schools|last = Porter|first = Tracie|date = 2015|journal = Arkansas Review|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; To put this rate in perspective, it should be noted that the United States homicide rate is 4.3x that of the UK (3.9 vs. 0.9 per 100,000&lt;ref&gt;[[List of countries by intentional homicide rate]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}), and that the United States also incarcerates at a rate 4.7x that of the UK (693 vs 146 per 100,000&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate, United Kingdom: England &amp; Wales&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Disparities ==
{{See also|Youth incarceration in the United States}}

School disciplinary policies disproportionately affect Black and Latino youth in the education system,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=THERIOT|first=MATTHEW T|date=10 October 2018|title=STUDENT RESOURCE OFFICERS AND CRIMINALISATION OF STUDENT BEHAVIOR|url=http://www.justicepolicy.org/news/8775|journal=JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE|volume=|pages=|via=CHART}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{what|date=January 2017}}{{fact|date=January 2017}} a practice known as the discipline gap. This discipline gap is also connected to the [[Achievement gap in the United States|achievement gap]]. The U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights issued a brief in 2014 outlining the current disparities. Black students are suspended and expelled at a rate three times greater than white students. The Advancement Project found that "In the 2006-2007 school year, there was no state in which African-American students were not suspended more often than white students".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  On average, 5% of white students are suspended, compared to 16% of black students. Black students represent 16% of student enrollment, and represent 27% of students referred to law enforcement and 31% of students subjected to a school-related arrest. Combined, 70% of students involved in "In-School arrests or referred to law enforcement are Black or Latino."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The majority of these arrests are under [[Zero tolerance (schools)|zero tolerance policies]].

Disparities were found in the implementation of [[Zero tolerance (schools)|zero tolerance policies]] (ZTPs) in relation to minor offenses. In 2010, in North Carolina black students were punished for the same minor offenses, specifically cell phone, dress code, disruptive behavior and display of affection by more than 15 percent for each category of offense than white students. "The Council of State Governments Report found that black students were more likely to be disciplined for less serious "discretionary" offenses, and that when other factors were controlled for, higher percentages of White students were disciplined on more serious non-discretionary grounds, such as possessing drugs or carrying a weapon".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Discipline Policies, Successful Schools, Racial Justice, and the Law|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fcre.12035/abstract|journal = Family Court Review|date = 2013-07-01|issn = 1744-1617|pages = 388–400|volume = 51|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/fcre.12035|first = Daniel J.|last = Losen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 study reported that the racial disparity in rates of school suspensions could not be explained solely by racial differences in rates of delinquent behavior, and that this disparity in turn was "strongly associated with similar levels of disproportion in juvenile court referrals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicholson-Crotty|first1=Sean|last2=Birchmeier|first2=Zachary|last3=Valentine|first3=David|title=Exploring the Impact of School Discipline on Racial Disproportion in the Juvenile Justice System|journal=Social Science Quarterly|date=December 2009|volume=90|issue=4|pages=1003–1018|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00674.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a 2010 study found that black students were more likely to be referred to the office than students of other races, and that this disparity could be partly, but not completely, explained by student behavior and school-level factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rocque|first1=Michael|title=Office Discipline and Student Behavior: Does Race Matter?|journal=American Journal of Education|date=August 2010|volume=116|issue=4|pages=557–581|doi=10.1086/653629}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a 2014 study found that although black students were more likely to be suspended, this disparity "was completely accounted for by a measure
of the prior problem behavior of the student", and concluded that "the use of suspensions by teachers and administrators may not have been as racially biased as some scholars have argued".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=John Paul|last2=Morgan|first2=Mark Alden|last3=Coyne|first3=Michelle A.|last4=Beaver|first4=Kevin M.|last5=Barnes|first5=J.C.|title=Prior problem behavior accounts for the racial gap in school suspensions|journal=Journal of Criminal Justice|date=May 2014|volume=42|issue=3|pages=257–266|doi=10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2014.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2015 study using a national high school dataset concluded that "misconduct and deviant attitudes were important factors in predicting the receipt of [out-of-school suspensions] though ''results indicated that Black students did not generally misbehave or endorse deviant attitudes more than White students did''" [emphasis added].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=Francis L.|title=Do Black students misbehave more?

Schools with a higher percentage of black students are more likely to implement [[Zero tolerance (schools)|zero tolerance policies]] and to use extremely punitive discipline, supporting the [[racial threat]] hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Welch|first1=Kelly|last2=Payne|first2=Allison Ann|title=Racial Threat and Punitive School Discipline|journal=Social Problems|date=February 2010|volume=57|issue=1|pages=25–48|doi=10.1525/sp.2010.57.1.25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current policies maintaining the link ==

=== Zero tolerance policies ===
Zero tolerance policies are school disciplinary policies that set predetermined consequences or punishments for specific offenses. By definition zero tolerance policies, as any policy that is "unreasonable rule or policy that is the same for everyone but has an unfair effect on people who share a particular attribute" are necessarily discriminatory.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.humanrights.gov.au/quick-guide/12049&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/discrimination/what-are-the-different-types-of-discrimination/indirect-discrimination/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/IndigLawB/1999/22.html&lt;/ref&gt;. The zero tolerance approach was first introduced in the 1980s to reduce drug use in schools. The use of zero tolerance policies spread more widely in the 1990s. To reduce gun violence, the [[Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994|Gun Free Schools Act of 1994]] (GFSA) required that schools receiving federal funding "must 1) have policies to expel for a calendar year any student who brings a firearm to school or to school zone, and 2) report that student to local law enforcement, thereby blurring any distinction between disciplinary infractions at school and the law" .&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the 1996-1997 school year, 94% of schools had zero tolerance policies for fire arms, 87% for alcohol, and 79% for violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Tracing the School-to-Prison Pipeline from Zero-Tolerance Policies to Juvenile Justice Dispositions|last = Curtis|first = Aaron|date = 2014|journal = Georgetown Law Journal|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past decade, zero tolerance policies have expanded to predetermined punishments for a wide degree of rule violations.

The most direct way these policies increase the probability of a youth coming into contact with the incarceration system is through their exclusionary methods. Suspension, expulsion, and an increased risk of dropping out all contribute to a youth's increased chances of becoming involved with the incarceration system. Suspension removes students from the structure and supervision provided through schooling, providing opportunities for youth to engage in criminal activities while not in the school environment. Other factors may include "increased exposure to peers involved in antisocial behavior, as well as effects on school performance and completion and student attitudes toward [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial behavior]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Pathways From School Suspension to Adolescent Nonviolent Antisocial Behavior in Students in Victoria, Australia and Washington State, United States |journal = Journal of community psychology|date = 2012-04-01|issn = 0090-4392|pmc = 3774047|pmid = 24049218|pages = 301–318|volume = 40|issue = 3|first = Sheryl A.|last = Hemphill|first2 = Todd I.|last2 = Herrenkohl|first3 = Stephanie M.|last3 = Plenty|first4 = John W.|last4 = Toumbourou|first5 = Richard F.|last5 = Catalano|first6 = Barbara J.|last6 = McMorris|doi=10.1002/jcop.20512}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Suspension can lead to feelings of alienation from the school setting that can lead to students to feel rejected, increasing chances of relationships with antisocial peers.

=== Policing in schools ===
Zero tolerance policies increase the number of [[School resource officer|School Resource Officers]] (SRO) in schools, which increases the contact a student has with the criminal justice system. Students may be referred by teachers or other administrators but most often zero tolerance policies are directly enforced by police or school resource officers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The practice of increasing the number of police in schools contributes to patterns of criminalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Stereotype and School Pushout:Race, Gender, and Discipline Disparities|last = George|first = J.A.|date = 2015|journal = Arkansas Law Review|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This increase in SROs has led to contemporary [[school discipline]] beginning to mirror approaches used in legal and law enforcement. Zero tolerance policies increase the use of [[Offender profiling|profiling]], a very common practice used in [[law enforcement]]. This practice is able to identify students who may engage in misbehavior, but the use of profiling is unreliable in ensuring school safety, as this practice over identifies students from minority populations. There were no students involved in the 1990s shootings who were Black or Latino and the 1990s school shootings were the main basis for the increase in presence of police in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Are Zero Tolerance Policies Effective in the Schools?|last = American Psychological Association Zero Tolerance Task Force|first = |date = December 2008|journal = American Psychologist|doi = 10.1037/0003-066x.63.9.852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Justice Policy Institute report (2011) found a 38% increase in the number of SROs between 1997 and 2007 as a result of the growing implementation of zero tolerance policies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1999, 54% of students surveyed reported seeing a security guard or police officer in their school, by 2005, this number increased to 68%.  The education system has seen a huge increase in the number of students referred to law enforcement. In one city in Georgia, when police officers were introduced into the schools, "school-based referrals to juvenile court in the county increased 600% over a three year period". There was no increase in the number of serious offenses or safety violations during this three-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = School—Police Partnership Effectiveness in Urban Schools: An Analysis of New York City's Impact Schools Initiative|url = http://eus.sagepub.com/content/39/4/455|journal = Education and Urban Society|date = 2007-08-01|issn = 0013-1245|pages = 455–478|volume = 39|issue = 4|doi = 10.1177/0013124507302396|first = Kevin P.|last = Brady|first2 = Sharon|last2 = Balmer|first3 = Deinya|last3 = Phenix}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, forty-one states required schools to report students to law enforcement for various misbehaviors on school grounds.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This practice increases the use of law enforcement professionals in handling student behavior and decreases the use of in-classroom (non-exclusionary) management of behaviors.

In 2014, the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] (HRC) expressed concern with increasing criminalization of students in response to school disciplinary problems, and recommended that the US government "promote the use of alternatives to the application of criminal law" to address such issues. The HRC also noted its concern with the use of [[corporal punishment in schools]] in the US.&lt;ref name=HRC110Session&gt;{{cite report |title=Concluding observations on the fourth periodic report of the United States of America |date=2014-04-23 |publisher=United Nations Human Rights Committee.

== Events Affecting School to Prison Pipeline ==

# A large factor of the school to prison pipeline is the disproportionate disciplinary actions taken against students of color. In recent years, the media has reported about some of these experiences.
# 
# Examples of zero tolerance policies and its role in school-to-prison pipeline statistics.

In Spring 2018, a 14-year-old black boy came to school with a new haircut. The haircut featured a design made with a razor. The student was pulled out of class one day at Tenaya Middle School in Fresno, California, because of his haircut, which the school claimed violated their dress code. The child's mother claimed, "The vice principal told my son that he needed to cut his hair because it was distracting and violated the dress code". The child's mother claims she agreed to get her 14-year-old son to get a new haircut, she also said she was unable to immediately get an appointment due to a lack of black barbers in her area. When her son arrived at school the next day, according to the child's mother, the school explained to her that he would face in-school suspension after returning with his haircut. The mother claims, “I requested that my son is issued a warning, to allow time to grow out his hair".

&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/education/article203981704.html&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In Spring 2018, a black male student at Apache Junction High School in Arizona wore a bluer bandana to school-which violated the dress code. His teacher called the police on him for not removing his bandana. He was then arrested and suspended for nine days. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/arrested-teen-says-his-teacher-called-the-police-on-him-for-wearing-a-bandana-to-school_us_5b75a4a0e4b0182d49b1bab4&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2018, an 11-year-old black girl, Faith Fennidy, was sent home from a private Roman Catholic school in Louisiana because she had hair extensions. The young girl had been wearing extensions to school for 2 years before a new policy was added. The policy prohibits extensions, clip-ins and/or weaves. The child would have to adhere to the policy to attend school. The family chose to withdraw the student from the school; the student was not suspended or expelled. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/louisiana-girl-sent-home-school-over-braided-hair-extensions-n902811&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, at Creekside Elementary School in Milledgeville, Georgia, a 6-year-old student, Salecia Johnson was crying and flailing on the floor of her principal’s office. The principal said she was inconsolable, had thrown various items, and had damaged school property during a tantrum. Salecia was handcuffed and transported to a police station. The 6-year-old was initially charged as a juvenile with simple battery of a schoolteacher and criminal damage to property, but it was later decided the girl would not be charged because of her age.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnn.com/2012/04/17/justice/georgia-student-handcuffed/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative approaches ==
===Restorative Justice===
The use of restorative justice in schools began in the early 1990s with initiatives in Australia. Restorative justice models are used globally and have recently been introduced to school disciplinary policies in the United States as an alternative approach to current punitive models, such as zero tolerance.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
Restorative justice programs are being used in very few classrooms throughout the United States. Programs, such as restorative circles, restorative meetings, restorative youth courts, and peer mediation, are being used as alternatives to zero-tolerance policies and harsh disciplinary practices &lt;ref&gt;(Schiff, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;.  The focus of these programs is on ensuring that students understand and learn from their behavior as well as take responsibility for their actions and participate in steps that aim to repair the harm done to relationships between the student and the school environment.  Students should be encouraged to participate in their punishments and school administration should refrain from using suspensions and expulsions for minor offenses.  The goal of restorative programs is to keep students in school and stopping the flow of students from schools to the criminal justice system.

===Editorial policies of major media===

{{See also|United States incarceration rate#Editorial policies of major media}}

A substantial body of research claims that incarceration rates are primarily a function of media editorial policies, largely unrelated to the actual crime rate:  Beginning especially in the 1970s, the mainstream commercial media in the U.S. increased coverage of the police blotter, while reducing coverage of investigative journalism.  This had at least two advantages for the commercial media organizations:  
# Poor people can be libeled and slandered with impunity, and stories based on interviewing police are easy and cheap to create. 
# This reduces the space that might otherwise be filled with investigative journalism, which too often threatens major advertisers.  

Advertising rates are set based on the audience.  Because [[Fascination with death|"if it bleeds, it leads,"]] the media were able to accomplish this change without losing audience.  

Beyond this, the growth of [[private prisons]] increased the pool of major advertisers who could be offended by honest reporting on incarcerations and the school-to-prison pipeline:  It makes financial sense to report on this only to the extent that such reporting is needed to maintain an audience.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |editor1-first= Gary W. |editor1-last= Potter

[[Image:Opening crawl.jpg|thumb|300px|The three [[Shot (filmmaking)|shots]] which constitute the opening sequence: the phrase "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....", the ''Star Wars'' logo and the opening text, from the beginning of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope]]''.]]
The '''opening crawl''' is the signature device of every numbered film of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' series, an American [[epic film|epic]] [[space opera]] franchise created by [[George Lucas]]. It opens with the static blue text, "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....", followed by the ''Star Wars'' logo and the crawl text, which describes the [[backstory]] and context of the film. The visuals are accompanied by the "[[Star Wars Theme|Main Title Theme]]", composed by [[John Williams]].

This sequence has featured at the beginning each of the main ''Star Wars'' saga theatrical films produced by [[Lucasfilm]]. Although it has retained the same basic elements, the opening crawl has significantly evolved throughout the series. It is one of the most immediately recognizable elements of the franchise and has been frequently parodied.

The opening crawl was not used in the ''Star Wars'' "Anthology" films, ''[[Rogue One]]'' and [[Solo: A Star Wars Story|''Solo'']], although both films begin with the opening text, "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....". Additionally, the opening  sequence of ''Solo'' continues with a short backstory presented in the same style as the opening text.

==Structure==
Each film opens with the static blue text, "'''A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away'''....", followed by the ''Star Wars'' [[logo]] shrinking in front of a field of stars. Initially the logo's extremities are beyond the edge of the frame. While the logo is retreating, the "crawl" text begins, starting with the film's episode number and [[Subtitle (titling)|subtitle]] (with the exception of the original release of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''&amp;nbsp;– [[Star_Wars_opening_crawl#Episode_IV_opening_crawl|see below]]), and followed by a three-paragraph prologue to the film. The text scrolls up and away from the bottom of the screen towards a [[vanishing point]] above the top of the frame in a [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] projection. Each version of the opening crawl ends with a four-dot [[ellipsis]], except for ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' which has a three-dot ellipsis. When the text has nearly reached the vanishing point, it fades out, the camera [[Tilt (camera)|tilts]] down (or, in the case of ''Episode II: Attack of the Clones'', up), and the film begins.&lt;ref name="EpI Commentary"&gt;''Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' DVD commentary&lt;/ref&gt;

Several words are in all-capital letters to stress their importance: "[[Death Star|DEATH STAR]]" in ''Star Wars'', "[[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|GALACTIC EMPIRE]]" in ''Return of the Jedi'', "[[Clone trooper|ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC]]" in ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'', and "[[First Order (Star Wars)|FIRST ORDER]]", "[[New Republic (Star Wars)|REPUBLIC]]" and "[[Rebel Alliance|RESISTANCE]]" in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]''. Each line of the text spans the width of the screen when it enters from the bottom. In the [[Pan and scan|"fullscreen"]] (4:3 [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] for standard-definition television) versions of the films, the full lines of text are cut off on the sides until they have scrolled further onto the screen.  As a result, by the time the full lines are visible, the text is much smaller and harder to read.  In addition, the viewer also has less time to read it.

==Origin==
[[File:Flash Gordon (1940) - Opening Crawl.jpg|thumb|The opening crawl as seen at the beginning of an episode of ''[[Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe]]''.]]
[[File:Union Pacific opening crawl.jpg|thumb|The opening crawl of Cecil B. DeMille's ''Union Pacific'' (1939)]]
[[File:Star wars 1977 us.svg|thumb|Dan Perri's rejected ''Star Wars'' logotype]]
Lucas has stated that the opening crawl was inspired by the opening crawls used at the beginning of each episode of the original ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' and ''[[Buck Rogers]]'' film serials, which were the inspiration for Lucas to write much of the ''Star Wars'' saga.&lt;ref name="EpIII Commentary"&gt;''Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'' DVD commentary&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the opening crawl came about as part of a collaboration between Lucas and the seasoned film title designer [[Dan Perri]]. In 1976, Lucas invited Perri to [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]], Lucasfilm's post-production operation at [[Van Nuys]], California. Perri, who had previously worked on ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' and ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', suggested that they take inspiration from the 1939 [[Cecil B. DeMille]] film, ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'', whose opening credits are shown distorted by a sharp perspective and rolling along a [[Track (rail transport)|railroad track]] towards a distant [[vanishing point]].{{fact|date=November 2018}} Lucas was keen on the idea and Perri developed sketches and prototype mechanical artwork. One of the earliest iterations of the opening crawl is evidenced in [[storyboard]]s drawn by the production artist [[Alex Tavoularis]], depicting the title “THE STAR WARS” as a three-dimensional logo.&lt;ref name="artofthetitle"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perkins|first1=Will|title=Star Wars|url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/star-wars/|website=Art of the Title|accessdate=8 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402074725/http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/star-wars/|archivedate=2 April 2016|date=16 December 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perri also designed a [[logotype]], consisting of block-capital letters filled with stars and skewed towards a vanishing point to follow the same perspective as the opening crawl. Lucas eventually rejected Perri's logo due to readability problems, turning instead to the graphic designer [[Suzy Rice]], an art director at the [[Los Angeles]] [[advertising agency]] [[Seiniger Advertising]]. Lucas had commissioned Rice to design a promotional brochure that was to be distributed to cinema theatre owners. He instructed Rice to produce a logo that would intimidate the viewer, and he reportedly asked for the logo to appear "very [[fascism|fascist]]" in style. Rice, inspired by historical German [[typography]], produced a bold logotype using an outlined, modified [[Helvetica|Helvetica Black]]. After some feedback from Lucas, Rice decided to join the ''S'' and ''T'' of ''STAR'' and the ''R'' and ''S'' of ''WARS''. Lucas's producer, [[Gary Kurtz]], found that Rice's logo worked well in the opening title; the logo was modified further to flatten the  pointed tips on the letter ''W'' before it was inserted into the final cut. While Perri's skewed logo did not appear on-screen, it was used widely on pre-release print advertising, and it featured prominently on [[film poster]]s promoting the release of ''Star Wars'' on cinema billboards in 1977 (notably [[Tom Jung]]'s ''[[:File:StarWarsMoviePoster1977.jpg|Style ‘A’ poster]]'', the [[:File:Bros Hildebrandt Star Wars quad poster.jpg|''Style ‘B’'' poster]] by the [[Brothers Hildebrandt]] and [[Tom Chantrell]]'s [[:File:Tom Chantrell Star Wars quad poster 1977.jpg|''Style ‘C’'' poster]]).&lt;ref name="taylor-logo"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Taylor|first1=Chris|title=How Star Wars Conquered the Universe: The Past, Present, and Future of a Multibillion Dollar Franchise|date=2014|publisher=Head of Zeus|isbn=9781784970451|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=z7GbBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT186&amp;dq=suzy%20rice%20star%20wars%20logo&amp;pg=PT185#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=1 June 2016|chapter=11.

In a 2005 interview, George Lucas described how the final phrasing of the text for ''Star Wars'' came about. "The crawl is such a hard thing because you have to be careful that you're not using too many words that people don't understand. It's like a poem. I showed the very first crawl to a bunch of friends of mine in the 1970s. It went on for six paragraphs with four sentences each. [[Brian De Palma]] was there...". De Palma helped to edit the text into the form used in the film.&lt;ref&gt;Pearlman, Cindy (May 15, 2005). [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20050515/ai_n14631916 The Force]. ''Chicago Sun-Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
According to [[Dennis Muren]], who worked on the six films, crawls on the [[Star Wars#Original trilogy|original trilogy]] films were accomplished by filming physical models laid out on the floor. The models were approximately 60&amp;nbsp;cm (2') wide and 1.80&amp;nbsp;m (6') long. The crawl effect was accomplished by the camera moving longitudinally along the model. It was difficult and time-consuming to achieve a smooth scrolling effect. Furthermore, different versions in other languages (such as German, French and Spanish) were produced by [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]].&lt;ref name="EpI Commentary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EpIV Commentary"&gt;''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'' DVD commentary&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated graphics]], the crawls for the [[Star Wars#Prequel trilogy|prequel trilogy]] were achieved much more quickly.&lt;ref name="EpI Commentary"/&gt;  The 2004 DVD special edition versions of the original trilogy were later updated with computer-generated crawls [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases|as part of their restoration and enhancement]].

Lucasfilm president [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] stated that the 2016 spin-off film ''[[Rogue One]]'' would "more than likely" eschew certain traditional elements of the franchise, including the crawl, in an effort to distinguish it from the main film series.&lt;ref name="polygon-rogueone"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Rogue One'' is bucking a ''Star Wars'' tradition|url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/11/22/13718828/rogue-one-star-wars-tradition|first=Julia|last=Alexander|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=Vox Media|date=November 22, 2016|accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, ''Rogue One'' retains "A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...", but then immediately cuts to the opening scene with no crawl. At the end of the opening scene, the title "ROGUE ONE" recedes against a star field, like the "STAR WARS" title of the main series, then there is a cut to the next scene.

The second spin-off film ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story|Solo]]'' does not feature a crawl, but does feature an introductory text shown sentence by sentence in the same font and color as and immediately after "A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...". This places it halfway between ''Rogue One'' and the main saga.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/star-wars/feature/a857379/solo-a-star-wars-story-opening-crawl/ Does Solo: A Star Wars Story have an opening crawl?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Episode IV'' opening crawl==
The opening crawl in the first ''Star Wars'' film is very different from Lucas' original intention. The original text, used in the rough cut he showed to friends and studio executives in February 1977, appears in the [[Star Wars (1977 comic book)|Marvel Comics adaptation of the film]].&lt;ref name="thomas20070601"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/episode-iv/bts/article/f20070601/index.html?page=1 |title=Star Wars: The Comic Book That Saved Marvel! |work=starwars.com |date=2007-06-01 |accessdate=December 5, 2012 |author=Thomas, Roy }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; When originally released in May 1977, the first film was simply titled ''Star Wars'', as [[20th Century Fox]] forbade Lucas to use a subtitle because it could be confusing, since there had been no other ''Star Wars'' movies prior to 1977.&lt;ref name="EpI Commentary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EpIV Commentary"/&gt; In addition, it was not certain if the film would be followed with a sequel. When ''The Empire Strikes Back'' was released in 1980, the episode number, "Episode V", and subtitle "THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK" appeared as the first two lines of the opening crawl. To match its sequel's crawl, the episode number "Episode IV" and subtitle "A NEW HOPE" were added for the film's theatrical re-release in April 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/films/star-wars-episode-iv-a-new-hope|title=Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|work=StarWars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original version, without the subtitle, was not released again until the [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases#2006 Star Wars Trilogy DVD Box Set|2006 limited edition DVDs]].

[[File:Troca de cromos da panini - 1.jpg|thumb|right|Sticker trade in Brazil for [[Panini Group|Panini]]’s [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]] sticker album]]
A '''sticker album''' is a book in which collectable [[sticker]]s are stuck into designated sections. Sticker album themes can be sporting events such as the [[FIFA World Cup]] or [[Television program|TV shows]] like ''[[Doctor Who]]''. [[Panini Group|Panini]] first produced a World Cup sticker album for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]] in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Brand collaborations |url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/marketing/licensing/brand-collaborations.html |accessdate=8 September 2018 |agency=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=“Iconic”&gt;{{cite news |title=Panini World Cup 2018 stickers: When is the iconic sticker album release date?

The stickers are usually sold in blind packs, so the purchaser does not know which stickers they are buying. Collectors then swap or sell their spares with other collectors.

===Sports===
A [[sports]]-related sticker album, such as [[Panini Group|Panini]]’s [[FIFA World Cup]] edition, have designated sections for each team along with numbered rectangles for each sticker.&lt;ref name=“Iconic”/&gt;&lt;ref name=“Guardian”/&gt; Each sticker will have the players picture and below it there is usually their name, birth date, position and birthplace. In addition to the players, there are stickers which bear the team's crest and a team photo. Under its ''Merlin'' brand, since 1994 [[Topps#Topps_Europe_Ltd_Products|Topps]] has held the licence to produce a sticker album for the [[Premier League]], which is the best selling annual collectable for boys in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Topps |url=https://www.premierleague.com/partners/topps |accessdate=5 October 2018 |agency=Premier League.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Panini Group]], the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] album sold 10 million packs in the U.S. alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.si.com/soccer/2018/06/06/panini-world-cup-sticker-album-history-tradition “The Magic, Global Craze and Tradition of Panini's World Cup Sticker Albums”]. ''Sports Illustrated''. Retrieved 2 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

====Digital sticker album====
In May 2006, Panini partnered with [[The Coca-Cola Company]] and Tokenzone to produce the first virtual sticker album for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref name=“Cola”&gt;{{cite news |title=12 Years Running: Panini’s FIFA World Cup™ Digital Sticker Album is More Popular Than Ever |url=https://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/paninis-fifa-world-cup-digital-sticker-album-is-more-popular#ath |accessdate=5 October 2018 |agency=Coca Cola Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], three million FIFA.com users took part in the Panini Digital Sticker Album contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Panini Digital Sticker Album launched for Russia 2018 |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/panini-digital-sticker-album-launched-for-russia-2018 |accessdate=8 September 2018 |agency=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panini developed an app for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] where fans could collect and swap virtual stickers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Panini World Cup sticker album: Inside story behind the craze |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2018/06/06/panini-world-cup-sticker-album-history-tradition |accessdate=5 October 2018 |work=Sports Illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five million people gathered digital stickers for the 2018 World Cup.&lt;ref name=“Cola”/&gt;

'''Tayasal''' is a [[Maya civilization|Maya]] [[archaeological site]] located in present-day [[Guatemala]]. It was a large [[Maya city]] with a long history of occupation. Tayasal is a corruption of ''Tah Itza'' ("Place of the Itza"), a term originally used to refer to the core of the Itza territory in Petén.&lt;ref&gt;Jones et al 1981, p. 531.&lt;/ref&gt; The name Tayasal was applied in error to the archaeological site, and originally applied to the [[Nojpetén|Itza capital]]. However, the name now refers to the peninsula supporting both the archaeological site and the village of San Miguel. The site was occupied from the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era or Formative Period|Middle Preclassic]] period (c. 1000–350 BC) through to the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Postclassic Era|Late Postclassic]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1200–1539&amp;nbsp;AD).&lt;ref name="Pugh&amp;SanchezPolo2011p6"&gt;Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2011, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is a protected national monument.

==Location==
The Tayasal archaeological site is situated on a peninsula on [[Lake Petén Itzá]] a short distance to the north of the modern town of [[Flores, El Petén|Flores]],&lt;ref&gt;Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2011, p. 6. Chan Nieto et al 2012, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; separated from it by a {{convert|270|m|ft|adj=on}} wide stretch of water,&lt;ref name="Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2010, p. 3"&gt;Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2010, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and falls within the municipality of Flores, in the department of [[Petén Department|Petén]] in northern Guatemala.&lt;ref name="ChanNieto&amp;c2012p284"/&gt; The site covers an area of approximately {{convert|2.75|km2|sqmi}}. The southern portion of the peninsula also hosts the modern village of San Miguel, which probably covers a portion of the Postclassic occupation of the site.&lt;ref name="Pugh&amp;SanchezPolo2011p6"/&gt; The peninsula fell within the core of the Postclassic Itza territory.&lt;ref name="Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2010, p. 3"/&gt;

The protected area of the archaeological site is defined by the lakeshore to the north and west, and by the modern village of San Miguel to the south and east.&lt;ref name="ChanNieto&amp;c2012p284"/&gt;

The Tayasal peninsula showed intense activity during the Late Preclassic (c. 400 BC - 250 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Chan Nieto et al 2012, pp. 283-4.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the city fully reflected ongoing developments in the Maya region, such as monumental architecture that included typical Preclassic Maya architectural forms such as the [[triadic pyramid]] and the [[E-Group]] ceremonial complex.&lt;ref&gt;Chan Nieto et al 2012, pp. 284-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Activity at the site continued right through to the Postclassic period.&lt;ref name="ChanNieto&amp;c2012p284"/&gt; Investigations have identified that most Posclassic and colonial activity was concentrated on the southern shore of the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2011, pp. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Very little is known about the use of the peninsula during the time of first contact with the Spanish, although early colonial accounts reported that the [[Itza people|Itza]] frequently conducted rituals there.&lt;ref name="Pugh&amp;SanchezPolo2011p6"/&gt; Evidence of Spanish contact includes a [[Musket#Ammunition|musketball]] excavated at the site.&lt;ref name="Pugh&amp;SanchezPolo2011p8"/&gt; In 1702 and 1703, shortly after the [[Spanish conquest of Petén]], Spanish missions were established on the Tayasal peninsula at San Miguel and San Bernabé,&lt;ref&gt;Pugh et al 2012, p. 625.&lt;/ref&gt; although the population of San Bernabé dropped off sharply through the course of the 18th century due to high [[infant mortality]].&lt;ref&gt;Pugh et al 2012, p. 626.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
The Tayasal archaeological site was declared a national monument in 1931. The [[University of Pennsylvania]] mapped the site in 1971, and its limits were defined by the [[Instituto de Antropología e Historia]] (Institute of Anthropology and History) in 1994.&lt;ref name="ChanNieto&amp;c2012p284"&gt;Chan Nieto et al 2012, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Tayasal has been excavated sporadically since the 1920s, beginning with Guthe's excavations in 1921-1922,&lt;ref name="Chase85p193"&gt;Chase 1985, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; continuing with Morley's dig in 1937 to 1938, by several others in the 1950s and 60s.&lt;ref&gt;Chase 1979, pp. 86-119.&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Pennsylvania undertook excavations in 1971, and again in 1977.&lt;ref name="Chase85p193"/&gt; The Proyecto Maya Colonial undertook a month-long investigation of the site in 1996.&lt;ref name="Pugh&amp;SanchezPolo2011p8"&gt;Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2011, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The Proyecto Arqueológico Tayasal was launched in 2009, with particular emphasis on the period of contact with the Spanish, and the early colonial years.&lt;ref&gt;Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2010, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The project also remapped the site with the objective of correcting any errors from the 1971 mapping project.&lt;ref&gt;Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2010, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site description==
[[File:Tayazal 03.JPG|thumb|right|upright|The ''Mirador del rey Can'Ek'' was a [[triadic pyramid]] dating to the Late Preclassic]]
The University of Pennsylvania project mapped 339 structures; the city possessed large open plazas, palaces, [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramid-temples]], an [[acropolis]], defensive walls, residential buildings, and a [[cenote]].&lt;ref name="ChanNieto&amp;c2012p284"/&gt; As many as fifty burials and twelve caches have been recovered from Tayasal.&lt;ref&gt;Chase 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; The site core includes a number of large structures dating to the Classic period.&lt;ref name="Pugh&amp;SanchezPolo2011p7"&gt;Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2011, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mirador del rey Can'Ek''' "[[Kan Ek'|King Kan Ek']]s Lookout" (Structures T65-T67) was a triadic pyramid, consisting of a massive pyramidal platform with a single access stairway, supporting two lesser structures flanking a principal structure. This architectural form dates it to the Late Preclassic. It was built on the higher portion of the peninsula.&lt;ref name="ChanNieto&amp;c2012p285"/&gt;

'''Cerro Moo''' (Structures T256-T258) was another triadic pyramid, dating to the Late Preclassic, also built on the higher ground of the peninsula.&lt;ref name="ChanNieto&amp;c2012p285"/&gt;

'''Group 23''' is located to the southwest of the acropolis. It appears to have been built in the Late Preclassic as an E-Group. The E-Group axis is oriented 9° to the south of the east-west line, leading investigators to conclude that it was never used as an astronomical observatory as at other sites, but rather served a purely ceremonial function. It consists of a radial structure to the west and a long basal platform to the east that supported three buildings.&lt;ref name="ChanNieto&amp;c2012p285"&gt;Chan Nieto et al 2012, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; At Tayasal, the radial structure appears to have been covered by later construction, including a group of structures dating to the Late Postclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Chan Nieto et al 2012, p. 285. Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2010, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===San Bernabé===
The San Bernabé portion of the site occupies the northwestern area of the Tayasal peninsula.&lt;ref name="ChanNieto&amp;c2012p286"/&gt; Various structures in this area have been dated to the Late Preclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Chan Nieto et all 2012, pp. 286-287.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Spanish conquest of Petén|Spanish conquest]], San Bernabé was one of two Spanish missions established on the peninsula.&lt;ref name="Pugh&amp;SanchezPolo2011p6"/&gt;

'''Structure T29''' was a platform measuring {{convert|23|by|23|m|ft}} and has a height of {{convert|0.5|m|ft}}. It was built in the Late Preclassic and was reused in the Postclassic. It continued in use into the colonial period,&lt;ref&gt;Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2011, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and excavators recovered a number of colonial artefacts around the structure, including a silver Spanish coin, probably a ''[[Spanish colonial real|real]]'', [[Maiolica]] pottery, a lead bullet.&lt;ref&gt;Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2011, pp. 15-17.&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that the platform supported a colonial-period residence.&lt;ref&gt;Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2011, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure T30''' was a circular structure in the northwestern portion of the site. It was elongated, measuring {{convert|23|m|ft}} east-west by {{convert|18.7|m|ft}} north-south, and stood {{convert|1|m|ft}} high. It dates to the Preclassic, and served as the basal platform for four structures (denominated T-30a to T30d).&lt;ref name="ChanNieto&amp;c2012p286"&gt;Chan Nieto et al 2012, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure T30a''' is a circular platform measuring {{convert|5.17|m|ft}} across, and standing {{convert|22|cm|in}} high. It's wall consists of three courses of soft [[limestone]] blocks, and its fill consists of a mix of soil and small stones. Recovered potsherds are dated to the Late Preclassic Chicanel Phase. A number of ritual deposits were excavated that date to the Late to Terminal Classic period, indicating continued use of the platform long after its construction.&lt;ref name="ChanNieto&amp;c2012p286"/&gt; Although the majority of the building's fill was Late Preclassic, the fill on the east side was dated to the Terminal Classic.&lt;ref&gt;Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2011, p. 19. Estrada-Belli 2007, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
Tayasal iconography is typical of Maya artefacts found in the surrounding Petén region that date approximately to the same time period. Examples of the imagery can be found on three excavated vases. The vases accompanied an individual who was interred at Tayasal during the [[Classic Maya collapse|Terminal Classic period]]; circa 8th century AD.&lt;ref name="Chase85p194"&gt;Chase 1985, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chase 1985, pp. 193-201.&lt;/ref&gt; The vases' images are thought to represent the elite status concerns, similar to those as depicted on carved [[Maya stelae|stelae]] at neighbouring sites.&lt;ref name="Chase85p194"/&gt;

'''Torrington Square''' is a square in [[Bloomsbury]], owned by the [[University of London]], located in central [[London]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londontown.com/LondonStreets/torrington_square_b5c.html|title=Torrington Square Guide|first=|last=LondonTown.com|website=LondonTown|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is a square in name only, most of the houses having been demolished by the university. The southern end of the square is dominated by the University of London's [[Senate House (University of London)|Senate House]]. [[Birkbeck College]] and the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] (SOAS) are located here. To the southwest is [[Malet Street]] and to the southeast is [[Russell Square]]. The square is the site of a weekly [[farmers' market]], held on Thursdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfm.org.uk/markets/bloomsbury/|title=Homepage|website=Lfm.org.uk|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
