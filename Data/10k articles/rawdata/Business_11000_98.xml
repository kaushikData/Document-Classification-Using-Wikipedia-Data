'''Abdullah Abdul Latif Al Othman''' ({{lang-ar|عبدالله عبد اللطيف العثمان}}) (1895 – 1965) was a Kuwaiti businessman who was amongst the first to live in [[Hawalli, Kuwait|Hawalli]].  He was known for his generosity and helping the poor both locally and regionally. He started a school with his brothers called [[Al Othman School]] in the 1930s.  Has a street named after him in Hawalli and a [[mosque]] which he built himself in 1958, as well as Mosques in [[Lebanon]].  He also started the largest and most well-known charity in the [[Islam]]ic World as [[Zakat]] called [[Zakat Al Othman]] ({{lang-ar|زكاة العثمان}}).

His half brother, [[Mulla Othman Al Othman]] was a great Islamic Scholar and [[Imam]] in [[Kuwait]].

'''Air transport network''' or air transportation network (ATN) is an example of [[transport network]]s and [[spatial network]]s. The nodes of the network are the airports and the links represent direct flight routes between two airports.&lt;ref name="Bart"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barthelemy | first1 = M. | year = 2011 | title = Spatial Networks | arxiv = 1010.0302| journal = Physics Reports | volume = 499 | issue = 1–3| pages = 1–101 | doi=10.1016/j.physrep.2010.11.002| bibcode = 2011PhR...499....1B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, cities can be considered as the nodes with links representing direct flight connection between them. Air transport networks can be defined worldwide as well as for one region or for one airline company; the scale of the network can be global or domestic.&lt;ref name="Bart" /&gt;

==Properties of air transport networks==
The graph of an air transport network is spatial but not a  [[planar graph]]. The air transportation network is a [[complex network]] which has the properties of [[small-world networks]] and [[scale-free networks]].&lt;ref name="Bart" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gui"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guimera | first1 = R. | last2 = Mossa | first2 = S. | last3 = Turtschi | first3 = A. | last4 = Amaral | first4 = L. A. N. | year = 2005 | title = The world-wide air transportation network: Anomalous centrality, community structure, and cities' global roles | arxiv = cond-mat/0312535| journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA | volume = 102 | issue = 22| pages = 7794–7799 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0407994102 | pmid=15911778 | pmc=1142352| bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.7794G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gui2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guimera | first1 = R. | last2 = Amaral | first2 = L. A. N. | year = 2004 | title = Modeling the world-wide airport network | url = http://seeslab.info/media/filer_public/33/53/3353accf-b7af-4828-8ea1-61222e1b2dcb/guimera-2004-eurphysjb-38-381.pdf | format = PDF | journal = European Physical Journal B | volume = 38 | issue = 2| pages = 381–385 | bibcode = 2004EPJB...38..381G | doi = 10.1140/epjb/e2004-00131-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[degree distribution]] of the nodes displays a [[heavy-tailed]] distribution. The [[Hub (network science)|hubs]] of the network have large connectivities and long-distance connectivities at the same time.&lt;ref name="Bart" /&gt;

An anomalous property of the air transport networks is that nodes with relatively low degrees may have very high [[betweenness centrality]]. It is an important observation related to the [[robustness of complex networks]]. According to this finding the critical points of the system are not necessarily the hubs, but some other cities which uniquely provides routes to certain regions.&lt;ref name="Bart" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gui"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lordan"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lordan | first1 = O. | last2 = Sallan | first2 = J. M. | last3 = Simo | first3 = P. | last4 = Gonzales-Prieto | first4 = D. | year = 2014 | title = Robustness of the air transport network | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1366554514000805 | journal = Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 155–163 | doi=10.1016/j.tre.2014.05.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Alaska can be easily isolated from the other parts of the worldwide air transport network.&lt;ref name="Lordan" /&gt;

The worldwide air transport network defines communities. These communities are mainly determined by geographical factors. However, in some cases the borders of the communities are different from the borders of geographic regions. Such an example is the community of Europe and Asian Russia.&lt;ref name="Bart" /&gt;

==Examples for air transport networks==
The worldwide air transportation network is represented by the database of [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA).&lt;ref name="Bart" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barrat"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barrat | first1 = A. | last2 = Barthelemy | first2 = M. | last3 = Pastor-Satorras | first3 = R. | last4 = Vespignani | first4 = A. | year = 2004 | title = The architecture of complex weighted networks | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/101/11/3747.full | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. | volume = 101 | issue = 11| pages = 3747–3752 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0400087101 | pmid=15007165 | pmc=374315| arxiv = cond-mat/0311416 | bibcode = 2004PNAS..101.3747B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The worldwide air transportation network is a [[critical infrastructure]] with high impact on mobility, trade and economy.&lt;ref name="Gui"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gui2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lordan" /&gt;

Another examples are the air transport systems of a country or a country's own air transport company. It is particularly important, because the quality of the airports and national airlines are also the measures of the state of development of the country.&lt;ref name="Gui"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lordan" /&gt;

==Application of air transport networks==
Modeling air transport networks aims airline companies to organize their routes in a cost-efficient way and therefore maximize their profits. Air transport network models are also the tool to investigate system robustness. They help to determine weaknesses of the system in case of various kinds of disruptions.&lt;ref name="Lordan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hu"&gt;X. Hu and E. Di Paolo "A Genetic Algorithm Based on Complex Networks Theory for the Management
of Airline Route Networks", Studies in Computational Intelligence (SCI) 129, 495–505 (2008) (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.434.8417&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf#page=495).&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative application is modeling [[human disease network]]s. Air transport network is used by millions of people every day, therefore it plays key role in the spread of some infections, such as influenza or [[SARS]]. In this sense air transport network is a transmitter similar to [[sexual network]]s, which is liable for the spread of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name="Gui"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gui2"/&gt;

In the [[United States]], the '''Auditing Standards Board''' (ASB) is the senior technical committee designated by the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA) to issue [[auditing]], [[attestation clause|attestation]], and [[quality control]] statements, standards and guidance to [[certified public accountants]] (CPAs) for non-public company audits.&lt;ref name="Intro_ASB"&gt;AICPA Operating Policies, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Created in October 1978, it is composed of 19 members representing various industries and sectors, including public accountants and private, educational, and governmental entities. It issues pronouncements in the form of statements, interpretations, and guidelines, which all CPAs must adhere to when performing audits and attestations.&lt;ref name="Creation_ASB"&gt;Creation of the Auditing Standards Board, AICPA Operating Policies Appendix A, pg. 17, par. 2-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Prior auditing standards and authorities===
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants has issued guidance to accountants and auditors since 1917, when, at the behest of the U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission]] and auspices of the [[Federal Reserve Board]], it issued a series of pamphlets to the accounting community in regard to  preparing financial statements and auditing (then referred to as "verification" and later "examination").&lt;ref name="Background_ASB"&gt;Historical Background, AICPA Operating Policies Appendix A, pg. 14, par. 2-7 and pg. 15, par. 1-3&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Verification of Financial Statements'', the first pamphlet dedicated exclusively to providing guidance for audits, was issued in 1929.&lt;ref name="Verification_ASB"&gt;Historical Background, AICPA Operating Policies Appendix A, pg. 14, par. 4-6&lt;/ref&gt; With its opening paragraph, the guidance provided one of the most fundamental principles in auditing, stating that "the responsibility for the extent of the (audit) work required must be assumed by the auditor."&lt;ref name="Verification_AIA"&gt;''Verification of Financial Statements'' (1929), American Institute of Accountants, Introduction, Opening Paragraph&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 the AICPA revised its prior pronouncements and issued ''Examination of Financial Statements by Independent Public Accountants'', which contained more detailed guidance on performing audit procedures for audits of small and mid-sized companies, while still emphasizing the need to perform the audit based on the nature of the client, its size, and its internal control structure, among other attributes.&lt;ref name="Verification_ASBp15"&gt;Historical Background, AICPA Operating Policies Appendix A, pg. 15, par. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 1939, the Committee on Auditing Procedure was formed by the AICPA to evaluate, discuss, and issue guidance exclusively on auditing-related matters.&lt;ref name="Verification_ASP"&gt;Historical Background: Statements on Auditing Procedures; AICPA Operating Policies Appendix A; pg. 15, par. 4-7 and pg. 16, par. 1-6&lt;/ref&gt; This Committee is considered the antecessor of the Auditing Standards Board, and was the first to issue Statements on auditing standards and principles to the public accounting community.&lt;ref name="Verification_ASP"/&gt; In 1941 it issued a pamphlet titled ''Statements on Auditing Procedure'', which discussed the auditor’s responsibility in applying judgment in audits. It was followed by a series of numbered pronouncements called ''Statements on Auditing Procedures'', or SAP (the antecessors of Statements on Auditing Standards), issued between 1939 up to the early 1970s for a total of 54 SAP pronouncements.&lt;ref name="Verification_ASP"/&gt; During that time, the Securities Exchange Commission required public accountants to include a representation in their independent audit reports that the audit was performed in compliance with generally accepted auditing standards, and the Committee issued a booklet titled ''Generally Accepted Auditing Standards—Their Significance and Scope'' to adopt the SEC’s requirement.&lt;ref name="Verification_ASP"/&gt; In 1963, the Committee issued ''Statement on Auditing Procedure No. 33'' to consolidate and replace various pronouncements issued between 1949 and 1963, including pamphlets and statements.&lt;ref name="Verification_ASP"/&gt;

In 1972, the AICPA implemented significant changes to its standard-setting practices by consolidating all auditing pronouncements up to that date under [[Statements on Auditing Standards (USA)|Statements on Auditing Standards]] (SAS), and gave the Committee the title of senior technical committee on auditing matters while changing its name to Auditing Standards Executive Committee. From 1972 through 1978 the Executive Committee issued SAS as the authoritative guidelines and rules for auditing, issuing a total of 23 SAS.&lt;ref name="Verification_ASEC"&gt;Historical Background: Statements on Auditing Procedures; AICPA Operating Policies Appendix A; pg. 16, par. 7 and pg. 17, par. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation of the ASB===
In October 1978, following extensive studies by the AICPA and its sub-committees, its governing council established the Auditing Standards Board as the maximum authoritative body in establishing GAAS, thereby consolidating and replacing all previous senior technical committees.&lt;ref name="Creation_ASB"/&gt; It required all AICPA members and public accountants to adhere to the ASB’s pronouncements in relation to audit, attestation, and quality control. The ASB would now define auditor responsibilities and provide guidance to allow them to accomplish work and emit a report, among others.&lt;ref name="Creation_ASB"/&gt;

===Sarbanes-Oxley and the PCAOB===
The [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002]] changed the hierarchy of generally accepted auditing principles and standards. The legislation established that the new [[Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]] (PCAOB) and the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) now had final authority over auditing regulation and public-auditor professional-practices standards for audits of [[Public company|public companies]], also referred to as "issuers".&lt;ref name="SOX_ASB"&gt;Changes created by Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002; AICPA Operating Policies pg. 17, par. 7 and pg. 18, par. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Public accountants and firms who audit public companies were required to register with the PCAOB and follow all standards, principles, rules, and interpretations issued by the PCAOB in regard to  public company audits and [[Auditor's report|audit reports]], as well as attestation and quality control. The PCAOB adopted the ASB's auditing and attest standards as its temporary auditing rules in 2003.&lt;ref name="SOX_ASB"/&gt;

The AICPA subsequently changed the designation of the leading GAAS-setting authority in February 2004. It designated the PCAOB as the authoritative body for GAAS related to public companies, while the ASB was designated for non-public companies.&lt;ref name="SOX_ASB"/&gt;

The Auditing Standards Board consists of 20 members (see table for current Board members),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aicpa.org/Professional+Resources/Accounting+and+Auditing/Audit+and+Attest+Standards/Auditing+Standards+Board/ASB+Members.htm Auditing Standards Board Members] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927040723/http://www.aicpa.org/Professional+Resources/Accounting+and+Auditing/Audit+and+Attest+Standards/Auditing+Standards+Board/ASB+Members.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}, AICPA.org&lt;/ref&gt; each nominated by the Director of the AICPA Audit and Attest Standards Staff and approved by the AICPA Board of Directors.&lt;ref name="Nominating_ASB"&gt;Nomination of ASB Members and the ASB Chair, AICPA Operating Policies, pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The Board has a Chairman to direct Board meetings and to establish procedures, sub-committees, and perform other similar tasks in conjunction with the Director. To assure that the different industries and sectors are represented, the AICPA has reserved nominations for different industry segments as part of its operating policies:&lt;ref name="Nominating_ASB"/&gt;
* 5 seats for [[public accounting]] firms at a local, regional or national level, but are not considered part of the [[Big Four auditors|"Big Four" accounting firms]].
* 4 seats for Big Four accounting firms
* 5 seats for representatives of the [[National Association of State Boards of Accountancy]] (NASBA), including current and former members of State boards of accountancy.
* 6 seats for other public accountants, members of the AICPA, and financial statement users (i.e. private industry). The AICPA typically reserves one of these for a person within the academic community and another for a government official, government auditor, or similar representative.&lt;ref name="Nominating_ASB"/&gt;

Board members serve a one-year term, after which they are evaluated by the AICPA for their performance, and can then be re-appointed for up to 3 one-year terms, or  dismissed by the AICPA. The AICPA may extend the term of service if, for example, the member is working on a long-term project and the AICPA believes that such participation is crucial for the completion of the project.&lt;ref name="Nominating_ASB"/&gt;

ASB proposed pronouncements are discussed within the ASB membership, the AICPA and with the general public. The ASB meets periodically to discuss auditing issues and prepare and draft pronouncement proposals, and occasionally holds public hearings. The meetings are considered informal (no set of formal rules) to encourage open deliberation between its members,.&lt;ref name="ASB_Meeting"&gt;Meetings of the Auditing Standards Board; AICPA Operating Policies; pg. 8, par. 1-5&lt;/ref&gt; Matters   which affect public interest, such as proposals of new SAS, are open to the public.&lt;ref name="ASB_Meeting"/&gt; The meetings and hearings are established by the ASB Chair, with public notices and meeting highlights and summaries printed in ''The CPA Letter'',  and on the AICPA website.&lt;ref name="ASB_Meeting"/&gt;   A quorum  comprises the majority of ASB members or their representatives, and other members of the AICPA are usually invited also.&lt;ref name="ASB_Meeting"/&gt;

Proposed pronouncements are discussed in the ASB meetings, and the board members must vote before to issuing a draft proposal (called an "exposure draft") or the final version to the public with two-thirds of ASB members in favor.&lt;ref name="ASB_Voting"&gt;Meetings of the Auditing Standards Board; AICPA Operating Policies; pg. 9, par. 1-4&lt;/ref&gt; The voting results are included in the meeting highlights published, and any ASB member who dissents from issuing a pronouncement may request that the reasons for dissenting be included in the exposure draft or final pronouncement.&lt;ref name="ASB_Voting"/&gt;

[[File:Camille Blanc - portrait.jpg|thumb|Camille Blanc.]]  
'''Camille Blanc''' (1847 in [[Paris]] – 1927), was a [[France|French]] municipal leader, with many interests in [[Monaco]]. From 1904 to 1925 he was founding mayor of [[Beausoleil, Alpes-Maritimes|Beausoleil]], a town adjacent to [[Monte Carlo]], which had previously formed part of [[La Turbie]] and had been known as Monte-Carlo-Supérieur.

==President of the Société-des-Bains-de-Mer==

Blanc was also for many years President of the [[Société des bains de mer de Monaco]], of [[Monte Carlo]], and took a leading part in the administration of the [[Monte Carlo Casino]].

===''Persona non grata'' in Monaco===

In the later years of his administration of [[Monte Carlo Casino]], his relations with [[Louis II, Prince of Monaco]] suffered a setback, and he withdrew to [[France]] as someone who had become ''persona non grata'' in [[Monaco]]'s official circles.

While married to Elizabeth Lanxade, his name was also linked to Madame Chinon, whose excessive gambling habits, indulged by Blanc, were widely believed by some observers to be substantially at the origins of the accusations of mismanagement which eventually led to Prince Louis' intervention and termination of his position at [[Monte Carlo Casino]].

In the closing years of Blanc's life, up to his death in 1927, he suffered severely from paralysis, said to have been derived mainly from the reported stresses of his experience of dealing with the [[Monaco]] authorities.

==Legacy==

However, the separate existence and prosperity of the neighbouring [[France|French]] town of [[Beausoleil, Alpes-Maritimes|Beausoleil]] may have proved to be Blanc's principal lasting legacy. The town hall of Beausoleil in the rue de la République has a sculpture and gardens dedicated to the memory of Camille Blanc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4587">The [[theory]] of '''collective capitalism''' was advanced by American [[economist]] G. Means in the 1960s. It was intended to overcome the failings of traditional [[capitalism]], using the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Problems and Prospects of Collective Capitalism|jstor=4223994}}&lt;/ref&gt; It rejects the principles advanced by [[Adam Smith]], who created the notion of the "[[invisible hand]]" of 'self-correcting' [[Market (economics)|market forces]]. The theory expresses the capitalist socialization of production, but only in a distorted manner. For example, Japan's collective capitalism relies on cooperation, but ignores the fact that the means of production  are private. It cannot be considered socialist because the means of production belongs to corporations.

==Collective capitalist theory==
The essence of the theory of collective capitalism is expressed by Means in the following proposition:

“We now have single corporate enterprises employing hundreds of thousands of workers, having hundreds of thousands of stockholders, using billions of dollars’ worth of the instruments of production, serving millions of customers, and controlled by a single management group. These are great collectives of enterprises, and a system composed of them or dominated by them might well be called ’collective capitalism’”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collective Capitalism, Theory of|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Collective+Capitalism,+Theory+of|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=IAIuAAAAMAAJ}}|title=The Corporate Revolution in America: Economic Reality Vs. Economic Theory|last=Means|first=Gardiner Coit|publisher=Crowell-Collier Press|year=1962|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collective capitalism places an emphasis on cooperative long-term relationships, resulting in an [[economy]] directed by "relational markets". An example of this is interlocking share ownership, in which [[Company|companies]] own shares in other companies; this results in a spirit of cooperation between the involved companies, since each has an interest in the other's performance. An important example of this is the [[Economy of Japan|Japanese economy]], in which 40% of the shares traded on the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] are owned by the collection of industrial groups known as the ''Kigyo Shudan'', and a further 30% is owned by the network of cross-shareholdings known as the ''[[keiretsu]]''. This results in stable ownership, lessening the potential for [[hostile takeover]]s and also "friendly" competition; companies are encouraged to excel but for the benefit of others as well as themselves.

==History==
Japan is the only example of collective capitalism in practical form. It stems from Japan's economic and social restructuring following [[World War II|World War Two]]. This program of industrial development was successful until the 1990s. Japan has the world's third-largest economy by [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP) and the second largest by [[Market (economics)|market]] [[exchange rates]].

Collective capitalism's influence can be seen elsewhere in modern Japan. Workers, particularly those who work for large businesses, become involved in their firms in ways unlike other capitalist systems. In return for loyalty and hard work, workers traditionally expect more from their employers than their western counterparts, including job security - often for life - [[pensions]] and social protection. This system of collective cooperation and the domination of the worker in corporate policy led to the Japanese system being dubbed "peoplism" by some critics.&lt;ref name="peoplism"&gt;[http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=011005C TCS Daily article "Japan's Economic Comeback?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310223450/http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=011005C |date=2007-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Many critics voiced concerns that while collective capitalism often provides benefits for workers, it also placed a high demand on them and their families. Long hours and high levels of discipline are commonplace, resulting in high levels of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] and the emergence of ''[[karōshi]],'' or "death by overwork," within the Japanese workforce.

[[File:IFAC Definition of MA.jpg|thumb|right|The structure of accounting as documented by the [[International Federation of Accountants]]]]
The '''differences between [[management accounting]] and [[financial accounting]]''' include:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Management and Cost Accounting |author=Colin Drury |chapter=Differences between management accounting and financial accounting |page=7 |isbn=9781844805662 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Management accounting provides information to people within an organization while financial accounting is mainly for those outside it, such as shareholders
#Financial accounting is required by law while management accounting is not.  Specific standards and formats may be required for statutory accounts such as in the I.A.S [[International Accounting Standard]] within Europe.
#Financial accounting covers the entire organization while management accounting may be concerned with particular products or cost centres.

Managerial accounting is used primarily by those within a company or organization.  Reports can be generated for any period of time such as daily, weekly or monthly.  Reports are considered to be "future looking" and have forecasting value to those within the company.

Financial accounting is used primarily by those outside of a company or organization. Financial reports are usually created for a set period of time, such as a financial year or period.  Financial reports are historically factual and have predictive value to those who wish to make financial decisions or investments in a company.
Management Accounting is the branch of Accounting that deals primarily with confidential financial reports for the exclusive use of top management within an organization. These reports are prepared utilizing scientific and statistical methods to arrive at certain monetary values which are then used for decision making. Such reports may include:

* Sales Forecasting reports
* Budget analysis and comparative analysis
* Feasibility studies
* Merger and consolidation reports

Financial Accounting, on the other hand, concentrates on the production of financial reports, including the basic reporting requirements of profitability, liquidity, solvency and stability. Reports of this nature can be accessed by internal and external users such as the shareholders, the banks and the creditors.

== Regulation and standardization ==

While financial accountants follow [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] set by professional bodies in each country or International Financial Reporting Standards, managerial accountants make use of procedures and processes that are not regulated by standard-setting bodies.

== Time period ==

Managerial Accounting provides top management with reports that are future-oriented, while Financial Accounting provides reports based on historical information.
There is no time span for producing managerial accounting statements but financial accounting statements are generally required to be produced for the period of 12 previous months.

==Legal differences in the United States==

* There is no legal requirement for an organization to use management accounting, but publicly traded firms (limited companies or whose shares are bought and sold on an open market) must, by law, prepare financial account statements.
* In management accounting systems there is no requirement for an independent external review but financial accounting annual statements must be audited by an independent CPA firm.
* In management accounting systems, management may be concerned about how reports will affect employees behavior whereas financial management concerns are about the adequacy of disclosure in financial statements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24867">In regulatory jurisdictions that provide for it (comprising most or all [[developed country|developed countries]] with [[free market]] economies), '''consumer protection''' is a group of laws and organizations designed to ensure the [[rights]] of [[consumers]] as well as [[fair trade]], competition and accurate information in the [[marketplace]]. The laws are designed to prevent the businesses that engage in [[fraud]] or specified [[Anti-competitive practices|unfair practices]] from gaining an advantage over competitors. They may also provide additional protection for those most vulnerable in society. Consumer protection laws are a form of government [[regulation]] that aim to protect the rights of consumers. For example, a government may require businesses to disclose detailed information about products—particularly in areas where safety or public health is an issue, such as food.

Consumer protection is linked to the idea of '''consumer rights''' and to the formation of [[consumer organizations]], which help consumers make better choices in the marketplace and get help with [[consumer complaints]]. Other organizations that promote consumer protection include government organizations and self-regulating business organizations such as consumer protection agencies and organizations, [[ombudsman|ombudsmen]], the [[Federal Trade Commission]] in America and [[Better Business Bureau]]s in America and Canada, etc.

A consumer is defined as someone who acquires goods or services for direct use or ownership rather than for resale or use in production and manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;"West Encyclopedia of American Law. Consumer. Answers.com. n.d.. Retrieved on January 31, 2010"&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumer interests can also be protected by promoting competition in the markets which directly and indirectly serve consumers, consistent with economic efficiency, but this topic is treated in [[competition law]]. Consumer protection can also be asserted via non-government organizations and individuals as [[consumer activism]].

==Consumer law==
Consumer protection law or consumer law is considered as an area of law that regulates [[private law]] relationships between individual consumers and the businesses that sell those goods and services. Consumer protection covers a wide range of topics, including but not necessarily limited to [[product liability]], [[privacy rights]], [[unfair business practices]], [[fraud]], [[misrepresentation]], and other consumer/business interactions. It's a way of preventing frauds and scams from service and sales contracts, eligible fraud, bill collector regulation, pricing, utility turnoffs, consolidation, [[personal loans]] that may lead to [[bankruptcy]].

The following lists consumer legislation at the nation-state level. In the EU member states Germany and the United Kingdom there is also the applicability of law at the EU level to be considered; this applies on the basis of [[subsidiarity]].

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the corresponding agency is the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] or the individual State Consumer Affairs agencies. The [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]] has responsibility for consumer protection regulation of financial services and products. However, in practice, it does so through privately run EDR schemes such as the [[Financial Ombudsman Service (Australia)]].

===Nigeria===
The Nigerian government has a duty to protect its people from any form of harm to human health through the use and purchase of items to meet daily needs. In light of this, the [[Nigerian Consumer Protection Council (CPC)]], whose aim is to protect and enhance consumers' interest through information, education, and enforcement of the rights of consumers was established by an Act of Parliament  to promote and protect the interest of consumers over all products and services. In a nutshell, it is empowered to Eliminate hazardous &amp; substandard goods from the market. Provide speedy redress to consumer complaints and petition arisen from fraud, unfair practice and exploitation of consumer.
 
===Germany===

[[Germany]], as a member state of the [[European Union]], is bound by the consumer protection [[European Directive|directives]] of the European Union; residents may be directly bound by EU regulations.
A minister of the federal cabinet is responsible for consumer rights and protection (''Verbraucherschutzminister''). In the current cabinet of [[Angela Merkel]], this is [[Daniel Lindigrin]].

When issuing public warnings about products and services, the issuing authority has to take into account that this affects the supplier's constitutionally protected economic liberty, see [[Bundesverwaltungsgericht]] (Federal Administrative Court) Case 3 C 34.84, 71 BVerwGE 183).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oefre.unibe.ch/law/dfr/vw071183.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
{{See also|Consumer Protection Act of 1986|National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission}}

In [[India]], consumer protection is specified in The Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Under this law, Separate Consumer Dispute Redress Forums  have been set up throughout India in each and every district in which a consumer can file his complaint on a simple paper with nominal court fees and his complaint will be decided by the Presiding Officer of the District Level.  The complaint can be filed by both the consumer of a goods as well as of the services. An appeal could be filed to the State Consumer Disputes Redress Commissions and after that to the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncdrc.nic.in/|title=NATIONAL CONSUMER DISPUTES REDRESSAL COMMISSION|website=ncdrc.nic.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The procedures in these [[tribunal]]s are relatively less formal and more people friendly and they also take less time to decide upon a consumer dispute&lt;ref name="CONSUMER PROTECTION AND NATIONAL CONSUMER DISPUTES REDRESS COMMISSION"&gt;V. Balakrishna Eradi, [http://ncdrc.nic.in/|publisher=NCDRC "Consumer Protection and National Consumer Disputes Redress Commission"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721172525/http://ncdrc.nic.in/ |date=July 21, 2011 }}. New Delhi: [[National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission]]. Accessed 25 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; when compared to the years long time taken by the traditional [[Indian judiciary]]. In recent years, many effective judgment have been passed by some state and National Consumer Forums.

[[Indian Contract Act, 1872]] lays down the conditions in which promises made by parties to a contract will be legally binding on each other. It also lays down the remedies available to aggregate party if the other party fails to honor his promise.

[[The Sale of Goods Act of 1930]] act provides some safeguards to buyers of goods if goods purchased do not fulfill the express or implied conditions and warranties.

[[The Agriculture Produce Act of 1937]] act provides grade standards for agricultural commodities and live stock products.It specifies the conditions which govern the use of standards and lays down the procedure for grading, marking and packaging of agricultural produce.The quality mark provided under the act is known as AGMARK-Agricultural Marketing.

===Taiwan===
Modern Taiwanese law has been heavily influenced by European civil law systems, particularly German and Swiss law. The Civil Code in Taiwan contains five books: General Principles, Obligations, Rights over Things, Family, and Succession. The second book of the Code, the Book of Obligations, provided the basis from which consumers could bring products liability actions prior to the enactment of the CPL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://luatcanhtranhvabaovenguoitieudung.wordpress.com/2011/06/01/taiwan-consumer-protection-law/|title=(TAIWAN) CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW|date=1 June 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/news/news_detail.aspx?id=189|title=Laws &amp; Regulations Database of The Republic of China|website=law.moj.gov.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Consumer Protection Law (CPL)]] in [[Taiwan]], as promulgated on January 11, 1994, and effective on January 13, 1993, specifically protects the interests and safety of customers using the products or services provided by business operators. The Consumer Protection Commission of Executive Yuan serves as an ombudsman supervising, coordinating, reporting any unsafe products/services and periodically reviewing the legislation.

According to the Pacific Rim Law &amp; Policy Association and the American Chamber of Commerce, in a 1997 critical study, the law has been criticized by stating that "although many agree that the intent of the CPL is fair, the CPL's various problems, such as ambiguous terminology, favoritism towards consumer protection groups, and the compensation liability defense, must be addressed before the CPL becomes a truly effective piece of legislation that will protect consumers"&lt;ref&gt;Carol T. Juang, [http://digital.law.washington.edu/dspace-law/bitstream/handle/1773.1/885/6PacRimLPolyJ219.pdf?sequence=1 "The Taiwan Consumer Protection Law: Attempt to Protect Consumers Proves Ineffective"] Pacific Rim Law &amp; Policy Association, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The [[United Kingdom]], as it is still a member state of the [[European Union]], is bound by the consumer protection [[European Directive|directives]] of the European Union; residents may be directly bound by EU regulations. Specifics of the division of labour between the EU and the UK are detailed here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU law and the balance of competences: A short guide and glossary, 2012|url=http://www.gov.uk/guidance/eu-law-and-the-balance-of-competences-a-short-guide-and-glossary|publisher=Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic (UK) laws originated within the ambit of [[contract]] and [[tort]] but, with the influence of [[EU law]], it is emerging as an independent area of law. In many circumstances, where domestic law is in question, the matter judicially treated as [[tort]], [[contract]], [[restitution]] or even [[criminal law]].

Consumer Protection issues are dealt with when complaints are made to the [[Director-General of Fair Trading|Director-General of Fair Trade]]. The [[Office of Fair Trading]]&lt;ref name="U.K. OFT"&gt;[http://www.oft.gov.uk/ U.K. Office of Fair Trading], 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; will then investigate, impose an injunction or take the matter to [[litigation]]. However, consumers cannot directly complain to the OFT. Complaints need to be made to the Citizens Advice Consumer Service (which has taken over from Consumer Direct) who will provide legal advice to complainants, or re-direct the individual complaint to Trading Standards for investigation. Due to restrictions within the Enterprise Act 2002, individual complainants are unable to be told whether their case is being investigated or not. In very rare cases, Consumer Direct may direct a very large number of complaints to the OFT to be considered as a systemic complaint. The OFT can also be engaged by consumer groups e.g. The Consumers Association or the statutory consumer protection body – Consumer Focus – via a super complaint. The OFT rarely prosecute companies, however, preferring a light touch regulation approach. Consumer complaints against companies are not published, but investigation work, undertakings, and enforcement are located at.&lt;ref&gt;U.K. Office of Fair Trading, [http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/consumer-enforcement/ "Consumer Enforcement"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313020125/http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/consumer-enforcement/ |date=2011-03-13 }}, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the consumer protection laws e.g. Distance Selling Regulations 2000 or Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 ({{Time ago|1999|magnitude=years}}) are actually UK implementations of EU directives. The OFT is one of the bodies responsible for enforcing these rules. It leads to a problem that these examples of legislation are clearly designed to deal with individual complaints but the OFT will only deal with systemic complaints and will ignore individual complainants redirecting them back to Consumer Direct.

The Office of Fair Trading also acts as the UK's official consumer and competition watchdog, with a remit to make markets work well for consumers, and at a local, municipal level by [[Trading Standards]] departments. General consumer advice can be obtained from the Citizens Advice Consumer Service or via a local branch of the [[Citizen's Advice Bureau]].

On the 3rd September, Conservative MEP Daniel Dalton proposed plans to the European Parliament's Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee to introduce an App that would provide a single source of advice and dispute resolution.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Conservative MEP unveils new consumer rights proposals |url= http://conservativeeurope.com/news/conservative-mep-unveils-new-consumer-rights-proposals|work=Conservatives in the European Parliament|date=3 September 2018|author=Daniel Dalton }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:CDCA auto repair notice.jpg|thumb|Consumer protection laws often mandate the posting of notices, such as this one which appears in all [[Auto mechanic|automotive repair]] shops in California]]
In the [[United States]] a variety of laws at both the federal and state levels regulate consumer affairs. Among them are the federal [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]], [[Fair Debt Collection Practices Act]], the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]], [[Truth in Lending Act]], [[Fair Credit Billing Act]], and the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]]. Federal consumer protection laws are mainly enforced by the [[Federal Trade Commission]], the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]], the [[Food and Drug Administration]], and the [[U.S. Department of Justice]].

At the state level, many states have adopted the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821232355/http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/fnact99/1920_69/rudtpa66.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=21 August 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including, but not limited to, Delaware,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://delcode.delaware.gov/title6/c025/sc03/index.shtml|title=TITLE  6 - CHAPTER 25. PROHIBITED TRADE PRACTICES - Subchapter III.

The Uniform Act contains a private remedy with attorneys fees for prevailing parties where the losing party "willfully engaged in the trade practice knowing it to be deceptive". Uniform Act §3(b).
Missouri has a similar statute called the Merchandising Practices Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/stathtml/40700000201.html|title=Missouri Revisor of Statutes - Revised Statutes of Missouri, RSMo, Missouri Law, MO Law|website=www.moga.mo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This statute allows local prosecutors or the Attorney General to press charges against people who knowingly use deceptive business practices in a consumer transaction and authorizes consumers to hire a private attorney to bring an action seeking their actual damages, punitive damages, and attorney's fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flesnerwentzel.com/#!merchandising-practices-act/c1k1e|title=St. Charles Family Law and St. Louis Divorce Attorneys Flesner Wentzel|author=|date=|website=St. Charles Family Law and St. Louis Divorce Attorneys Flesner Wentzel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.onlinedivorce.com/| title= Online Divorce }} Wednesday, 19 September 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the majority of states have a Department of Consumer Affairs devoted to regulating certain industries and protecting consumers who use goods and services from those industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medlawplus.com/classaction/attorneygeneralconsumeraffairs.tpl|title=MedlawPlus Divorce Process Resource - Welcome To The Top Free Online Divorce Resource|author=|date=|website=Welcome To The Top Free Online Divorce Resource}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in California, the [[California Department of Consumer Affairs]] regulates about 2.3 million professionals in over 230 different professions, through its forty regulatory entities. In addition, California encourages its consumers to act as [[private attorney general|private attorneys general]] through the liberal provisions of its [[Consumers Legal Remedies Act]].

[[California]] has the strongest consumer protection laws of any US state, partly because of rigorous advocacy and lobbying by groups such as Utility Consumers' Action Network, [[Consumer Federation of California]], and [[Privacy Rights Clearinghouse]]. For example, California provides for "cooling off" periods giving consumers the right to cancel contracts within a certain time period for several specified types of transactions, such as home secured transactions, and warranty and repair services contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://la.lawsoup.org/legal-guides/laws-by-role/consumer/contract-cancellation-cooling-off-periods/|title=Contract Cancellation periods or "Cooling off periods"|date=2014-07-09|work=Law Soup LA|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other states have been the leaders in specific aspects of consumer protection. For example, Florida, Delaware, and Minnesota have legislated requirements that contracts be written at reasonable readability levels as a large proportion of contracts cannot be understood by most consumers who sign them.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis D. Eigen, [http://scriptamus.wordpress.com/2009/11/12/a-solution-to-the-problem-of-consumer-contracts-that-cannot-be-understood-by-consumers/ "A Solution to the Problem of Consumer Contracts That Cannot be Understood by Consumers Who Sign Them"], Scriptamus, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional laws==
47 national constitutions currently in force include some sort of consumer right.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, Zachary, Tom Ginsburg, and James Melton. 2014.

The Kenyan rule also stipulates that citizens would have legal recourse in the case of injury or product defects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4094">[[File:CNAA.jpg|thumb|The Coat of Arms of the Council for National Academic Awards]]
The '''Council for National Academic Awards''' ('''CNAA''') was the national degree-awarding authority in the [[United Kingdom]] from 1965 until its dissolution on April 20, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;The Education (Dissolution of the Council for National Academic Awards) Order 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment followed the recommendation of the UK government Committee on Higher Education ([[Robbins Committee]]), one of whose recommendations being the replacement of the diploma-awarding National Council for Technological Awards with a degree-awarding council. That gave colleges more flexibility, as they could devise their own courses with the oversight of the council, rather than depend on existing universities to accredit courses. In 1974, the National Council for Diplomas in Art and Design was merged into the CNAA.&lt;ref name="DAvis1979"&gt;{{cite paper|title=The council for national academic awards 1964-74: a study of a validating agency|author=Davis, Martin C.|date=1979|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/7924/3/Thesis-1979-Davis.pdf|publisher=Loughborough University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qualifications included diplomas, bachelors, masters and doctorate research degrees; by the time of dissolution, it had awarded over 1.3 million degrees and other academic awards.&lt;ref&gt;World Education News And Reviews, Fall 1992, Vol. 5 / No. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The CNAA awarded [[academic degree]]s at [[polytechnic (United Kingdom)|polytechnics]], [[central institution]]s and other non-university institutions such as colleges of higher education until they were awarded university status. When the CNAA was wound up, the [[British government]] asked the [[Open University]] to continue the work of awarding degrees in non-university institutions. Additionally, the university has responsibility for CNAA records.

The CNAA, through its many subject panels, oversaw the degree-awarding powers of polytechnics. Above all, the CNAA saw itself as preserving a comparability at the national level with degree level awards in universities, a feature which can be seen as having both positive and negative aspects: positive in that it preserved a formal "parity of esteem" between the awards of the two parts of the [[Binary Divide|binary system]] (such as retaining the common currency of the undergraduate degree for entry to postgraduate study), but other scholars&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; viewed it as negative because it encouraged an "academicism" in the new sector and slowed an acceptance of the transformations required finally to break the boundaries of the old, "elite" system. In the event, the polytechnics were associated with many innovations, including [[women’s studies]], the academic study of [[communication studies|communications]] and [[media studies|media]], [[sandwich degree]]s, advanced [[engineering]] degrees in all functional specialities, and the rise of management and [[business studies]]; not least, they were much more responsive than older institutions in providing for the admission of non-standard students from technical colleges, advanced apprenticeships and other sources.

{{Marxism|expanded=Sociology}}
In  [[Marxist philosophy]], '''cultural hegemony''' is the [[Dominance hierarchy|domination]] of a culturally diverse society by the [[ruling class]] who manipulate the culture of that society—the [[belief]]s, [[explanation]]s, [[perception]]s, [[Value system|values]], and [[mores]]—so that their imposed, ruling-class [[worldview]] becomes the accepted cultural [[norm (sociology)|norm]]; the universally valid [[dominant ideology]], which justifies the social, political, and economic ''[[status quo]]'' as natural and inevitable, perpetual and beneficial for everyone, rather than as artificial [[Social constructionism|social constructs]] that benefit only the ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;Bullock, Alan; Trombley, Stephen, Editors (1999), ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' Third Edition, pp. 387–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "TheColumbia"&gt;''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Fifth Edition. (1994), p. 1215.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]] and in [[sociology]], the term ''cultural hegemony'' has denotations and connotations derived from the Ancient Greek word ''ἡγεμονία (hegemonia)'' indicating leadership and rule. In politics, [[hegemony]] is the geopolitical method of indirect [[Empire|imperial]] dominance, with which the ''hegemon'' (leader state) rules subordinate states, by the threat of intervention, an implied means of [[Power (philosophy)|power]], rather than by direct military force, that is, [[invasion]], [[Military occupation|occupation]], and [[annexation]].&lt;ref&gt;Ross Hassig, ''Mexico and the Spanish Conquest'' (1994), pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Etymology===
The etymologic and historical evolution of the Greek word ''ἡγεμονία'', and of its denotations, has proceeded thus:

* In [[Ancient Greece]] (8th c. BC – AD 6th c.), ''ἡγεμονία'' (leadership) denoted the politico–military dominance of a [[city-state]] upon other city-states, as in the [[League of Corinth|Hellenic League]] (338 BC), a [[federation]] of Greek city–states, established by King [[Philip II of Macedon]], to facilitate his access to and use of the Greek militaries against the [[Persian empire]].&lt;ref name="TheColumbia" /&gt;
* In the 19th century, ''hegemony'' (rule) denoted the [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] and cultural predominance of one country upon other countries, as in the [[European colonialism]] imposed upon the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australia.{{Sfn | Bullock | Trombley | 1999 | pp = 387–88}}
* In the 20th century, the political-science denotation of ''hegemony'' (dominance) expanded to include [[cultural imperialism]]; the cultural domination, by a [[ruling class]], of a socially [[Social stratification|stratified]] society. That by manipulating the [[dominant ideology]] (cultural values and mores) of the society, the ruling class can intellectually dominate the other social classes with an imposed [[worldview]] (''Weltanschauung'') that ideologically justifies the social, political, and economic ''status quo'' of the society as if it were a natural and normal, inevitable and perpetual state of affairs that always has been so.&lt;ref name="TheColumbia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clive Upton, William A. Kretzschmar, Rafal Konopka: ''Oxford Dictionary of Pronunciation for Current English''. Oxford University Press (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.flagrancy.net/timeline.html|title=US Hegemony|publisher=Flagrancy|contribution = Timeline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
In 1848, [[Karl Marx]] proposed that the [[economic recession]]s and practical contradictions of a capitalist economy would provoke the [[working class]] to [[proletarian revolution]], depose [[capitalism]], restructure social institutions (economic, political, social) per the rational models of [[socialism]], and thus begin the transition to a [[communist]] society.  Therefore, the [[dialectics|dialectical]] changes to the functioning of the [[economy]] of a society determine its social [[Base and superstructure|superstructures]] (culture and politics).

To that end, Antonio Gramsci proposed a ''strategic distinction'', between a War of Position and a War of Manœuvre. The war of position is an intellectual and cultural struggle wherein the [[anti-capitalist]] revolutionary creates a [[proletarian culture]] whose native value system counters the cultural hegemony of the [[bourgeoisie]]. The proletarian culture will increase [[class consciousness]], teach [[revolution]]ary theory and historical analysis, and thus propagate further revolutionary organisation among the social classes. On winning the war of position, socialist leaders would then have the necessary political power and popular support to begin the political [[maneuver warfare|manœuvre warfare]] of [[revolutionary socialism]].

The initial, theoretical application of cultural domination was as a Marxist analysis of "economic class" ([[base and superstructure]]), which Antonio Gramsci developed to comprehend "social class"; hence, cultural hegemony proposes that the prevailing cultural norms of a society, which are imposed by the ruling class ([[bourgeoisie|bourgeois cultural hegemony]]), must not be perceived as natural and inevitable, but must be recognized as artificial [[social construct]]s ([[institutions]], [[convention (norm)|practices]], [[beliefs]], et cetera) that must be investigated to discover their philosophic roots as instruments of social-class domination. That such praxis of knowledge is indispensable for the intellectual and political [[liberty|liberation]] of the [[proletariat]], so that workers and peasants, the people of town and country, can create their own [[working-class culture]], which specifically addresses their social and economic needs as social classes.

In a society, cultural hegemony is neither monolithic intellectual praxis, nor a unified system of values, but a complex of [[Social stratification|stratified]] [[social structure]]s, wherein each social and economic class has a social purpose and an internal class-logic that allows its members to behave in a way that is particular and different from the behaviours of the members of other social classes, whilst co-existing with them as constituents of the society.

As a result of their different social purposes, the classes will be able to coalesce into a [[society]] with a greater social mission. When a man, a woman, or a child perceives the social structures of bourgeois cultural hegemony, personal [[common sense]] performs a dual, structural role (private and public) whereby the individual person applies common sense to cope with daily life, which explains (to himself and to herself) the small segment of the [[social order]] stratum that each experiences as the ''status quo'' of life in society; "the way things are". Publicly, the emergence of the perceptual limitations of personal common sense inhibit the individual person’s perception of the greater nature of the systematic socio-economic [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]] made possible by cultural hegemony. Because of the discrepancy in perceiving the ''status quo''—the socio-economic hierarchy of bourgeois culture—most men and women concern themselves with their immediate (private) personal concerns, rather than with distant (public) concerns, and so do not think about and question the fundamental sources of their socio-economic [[oppression]], and its discontents, social, personal, and political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1177/019685998601000203 |format= [[PDF]] |title= The Problem of Ideology — Marxism without Guarantees |year= 1986 |first= Stuart |last= Hall |authorlink= Stuart Hall (cultural theorist) |journal= Journal of Communication Inquiry |volume= 10 |issue= 2 |pages= 28–44 |url= http://www.ram-wan.net/restrepo/hall/The%20problem%20of%20ideology.pdf }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of cultural hegemony are perceptible at the personal level; although each person in a society lives a meaningful life in his and her social class, to him and to her, the discrete social classes might appear to have little in common with the private life of the individual man and woman. Yet, when perceived as a whole society, the life of each person does contribute to the greater social hegemony. Although social diversity, economic variety, and political freedom appear to exist—because most people ''see'' different life-circumstances—they are incapable of perceiving the greater hegemonic pattern created when the lives they witness coalesce as a society. The cultural hegemony is manifested in and maintained by an existence of minor, different circumstances that are not always fully perceived by the men and the women living the culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Antonio |last=Gramsci |authorlink=Antonio Gramsci |editor-first =Joseph A | editor-last = Buttigieg |title=Prison Notebooks |publisher= Columbia University Press |location=New York City |year=1992 |pages=233–38 |isbn=0-231-10592-4 |oclc=24009547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectuals==
In perceiving and combating cultural hegemony, the working class and the peasantry depend upon the intellectuals produced by their society, to which ends Antonio Gramsci distinguished between bourgeois-class intellectuals and working-class intellectuals, the proponents and the opponents of the imposed, normative culture, and thus of the social ''[[status quo]]'':

{{Quotation| Since these various categories of traditional [[intellectual]]s [administrators, [[scholar]]s and [[scientist]]s, theorists, non-ecclesiastical philosophers, etc.] experience through an ''esprit de corps'' their uninterrupted historical continuity, and their special qualifications, they thus put themselves forward as autonomous and independent of the [[Ruling class|dominant social group]]. This self-assessment is not without consequences in the [[Ideology|ideological]] and [[Politics|political]] fields, consequences of wide-ranging import. The whole of [[Idealism|idealist philosophy]] can easily be connected with this position, assumed by the social complex of intellectuals, and can be defined as the expression of that social utopia by which the intellectuals think of themselves as "independent" [and] autonomous, [and] endowed with a character of their own, etc.|''Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci'' (1971), pp. 7–8.&lt;ref&gt;''Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci'' (1971), Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell Smith, eds., pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quotation| The traditional and vulgarized type of the intellectual is given by the Man of Letters, the [[philosopher]], and the [[artist]]. Therefore, journalists, who claim to be men of letters, philosophers, artists, also regard themselves as the "true" intellectuals. In the modern world, [[technical education]], closely bound to industrial labor, even at the most primitive and unqualified level, must form the basis of the new type of intellectual. ...

The mode of being of the new intellectual can no longer consist of eloquence, which is an exterior and momentary mover of feelings and passions, but in active participation in practical life, as constructor [and] organizer, as "permanent persuader", not just simple orator.|''Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci'' (1971), pp. 9–10.&lt;ref&gt;''Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci'' (1971), Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell Smith, eds., pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Gramsci’s influence==
[[File:Rudi.jpg|thumb|right|300px|In the 1960s, the German student leader [[Rudi Dutschke]], of the ''[[German student movement|68er-Bewegung]]'', said that changing the bourgeois West Germany required a long march through the society’s institutions, in order to identify and combat cultural hegemony. This quote is often mis-attributed to Antonio Gramsci.&lt;ref name=JaButt&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buttigieg|first1=J. A.|title=The Contemporary Discourse on Civil Society: A Gramscian Critique|journal=boundary 2|date=1 March 2005|volume=32|issue=1|pages=33–52|doi=10.1215/01903659-32-1-33}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Cultural hegemony has philosophically influenced [[Eurocommunism]], the [[social sciences]], and the [[activist]] politics of socially [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Progressivism|progressive]] politicians. The analytic [[discourse]] of cultural hegemony is important to research and synthesis in [[anthropology]], political science, sociology, and [[cultural studies]]; in [[education]], cultural hegemony developed [[critical pedagogy]], by which the root causes of political and social discontent can be identified, and so resolved.

In 1967, the [[German student movement]] leader [[Rudi Dutschke]] reformulated Antonio Gramsci's philosophy of cultural hegemony with the phrase ''[[The long march through the institutions]]'' (German: ''Marsch durch die Institutionen'') to identify the political war of position, an allusion to the [[Long March]] (1934–35) of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Chinese]] [[People's Liberation Army]], by means of which, the working class would produce their own organic intellectuals and culture ([[dominant ideology]]) to replace those imposed by the [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://english.nd.edu/faculty/profiles/joseph-a-buttigieg/ | editor1-first = Joseph A | editor1-last = Buttigieg | edition = English critical | last = Gramsci | title = Prison Notebooks | at = p 50 footnote 21 | quote = Long March Through the Institutions&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100616163619/http://english.nd.edu/faculty/profiles/joseph-a-buttigieg/ | archivedate = 2010-06-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1215/01903659-32-1-33| issn = 0190-3659| volume = 32| issue = 1| pages = 33–52| last = Buttigieg| first = Joseph A.| title = The Contemporary Discourse on Civil Society: A Gramscian Critique| journal = Boundary 2| accessdate = 2010-06-30| year = 2005| url = http://boundary2.dukejournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/32/1/33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "davidson"&gt;{{Citation | format = web log | url = http://carldavidson.blogspot.com/2006/04/strategy-hegemony-long-march.html | title = Strategy, Hegemony &amp; ‘The Long March’: Gramsci’s Lessons for the Antiwar Movement | first = Carl | last = Davidson | date = 6 April 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Marsch durch die Institutionen|Marsch durch die Institutionen]] at German Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[wikiquote:Antonio Gramsci#Misattributed|Antonio Gramsci: Misattributed]] at English Wikiquote for the origin of “The Long March Through the Institutions” quotation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique of Gramsci==

===The ideological apparatuses of the State===
As conceptual criticism of cultural hegemony, the [[structuralism|structuralist]] philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] presented the theory of the [[Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses|ideological state apparatus]] to describe the structure of complex relationships, among the different organs of the State, by which ideology is transmitted and disseminated to the populations of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On The Reproduction of Capitalism|last=Althusser|first=Louis|publisher=Verso|year=2014|isbn=9781781681640|location=London/ New York|pages=74–75; 103–47; 177, 180, 198–206; 218–31; 242–6.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Althusser draws from the concepts of hegemony present in ''cultural hegemony'', yet rejects the absolute [[historicism]] proposed by Gramsci. He argues that the ideological state apparatuses (ISA) are the sites of ideological conflict among the social classes of a society. That, in contrast to the repressive state apparatuses (RSA), such as the military and the police forces, the ISA exist as a plurality. While the ruling class in power can readily control the repressive state apparatuses, the ISA are both the sites and the stakes (the objects) of class struggle. Moreover, the ISA are not monolithic social entities, and are distributed throughout the society, as public and as private sites of continual [[class struggle]].

In ''On the Reproduction of Capitalism'' (1968), Louis Althusser said that the ideological apparatuses of the State are over-determined zones of society that comprise complex elements of the ideologies of previous [[modes of production]], thus, are sites of continual political activity in a society, which are&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Reproduction of Capitalism|last=Althusser|first=Louis|publisher=Verso|year=2014|isbn=9781781681640|location=London/ New York|page=243.}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

* the religious ISA (the system of Churches)
 
* the educational ISA (the systems of public and private schools),
 
* the family ISA,
 
* the legal ISA,
 
* the political ISA (the political system, e.g. political parties),
 
* the trade union ISA,
 
* the communications ISA (press, radio, television, etc.)
 
* the cultural ISA (literature, the arts, sport, etc.)

Althusser said that the [[parliament]]ary structures of the State, by which the “will of the people” is represented by elected delegates, are an ideological apparatus of the State. That the political system, itself, is an ideological apparatus, because it involves the “fiction, corresponding to a ‘certain’ reality, that the component parts of the [political] system, as well as the principle of its functioning, are based on the ideology of the ‘freedom’ and ‘equality’ of the individual voters and the ‘free choice’ of the people’s representatives, by the individuals that ‘make up’ the people.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Reproduction of Capitalism|last=Althusser|first=Louis|publisher=Verso|year=2014|location=London/New York|pages=222–223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''culture of capitalism''' or '''capitalist culture''' is the set of social practices, social norms, values and patterns of behavior that are attributed to the capitalist economic system in a capitalist society. Capitalist culture promotes the [[accumulation of capital]] and the sale of commodities, where individuals are primarily defined by their relationship to business and the market. The culture is composed of people who, behaving according to a set of learned rules, act as they must act in order to survive in capitalist societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Robbins|first= Richard |title= Global Problems and the Culture of Capitalism |publisher= Pearson|date=2005|isbn= 978-0205917655|page = 13 |quote= The culture of capitalism is devoted to encouraging the production and sale of commodities. For capitalists, the culture encourages the accumulation of profit; for laborers, it encourages the accumulation of wages; for consumers, it encourages the accumulation of goods. In other words, capitalism defines sets of people who, behaving according to a set of learned rules, act as they must act }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elements of capitalist culture include the mindset of [[business]] and corporate culture, [[consumerism]] and working class culture.

==Capitalist culture and ideology==
While certain political ideologies, such as [[neoliberalism]], assume and promote the view that the behavior that capitalism fosters in individuals is natural to humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/20/human-nature-politics-left-right |title=Who's correct about human nature, the left or the right? |author=Ed Rooksby |date=2010 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=20 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/261927/two-cheers-capitalism-bruce-thornton |title=Two sheers for capitalism |author=Bruce Thornton |date=2016 |publisher=Frontpage Magazine |accessdate=24 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; anthropologists like [[Richard Robbins (anthropologist)|Richard Robbins]] point out that there is nothing natural about this behavior - people are not naturally dispossessed to accumulate wealth and driven by wage-labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Robbins|first= Richard |title= Global Problems and the Culture of Capitalism |publisher= Pearson|date=2005|isbn= 978-0205917655|page = 13 |quote= There is nothing natural about this behavior. People are not naturally driven to accumulate wealth. There are societies in which such accumulation is discouraged...People are not driven to work; in fact, contrary to popular notions, members of capitalist culture work far more than, say, people who live by gathering and hunting.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political ideologies such as neoliberalism abstract the economic sphere from other aspects of society (politics, culture, family etc., with any political activity constituting an [[Economic interventionism|intervention]] into the natural process of the market, for example) and assume that people make rational exchanges in the sphere of market transactions. However, applying the concept of embeddedness to market societies, the sociologist Granovetter demonstrates that rational economic exchanges are actually heavily influenced by pre-existing social ties and other factors.&lt;ref name="granovetter"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Granovetter, M.|title=Economic action and social structure: the problem of embeddedness|journal=The American Journal of Sociology|volume=91|pages=487|year=1985|id=|doi=10.1086/228311|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a capitalist system, society and culture revolve around business activity (the accumulation of capital). As such, business activity and the market exchange are often viewed as being absolute or "natural" in that all other human social relations revolve around these processes (or should exist to facilitate one's ability to perform these processes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nyu.edu/projects/ollman/docs/market_mystification.php |title=Market Mystification in Capitalist and Market Socialist Societies |author=[[Bertell Ollman]] |date= |publisher=[[New York University]] |accessdate=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robbins|first1=Richard|title=Global Problems and the Culture of Capitalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9655">'''Decision-making software''' ('''DM software''') is a term for computer applications that help individuals and organisations make choices and take decisions, typically by ranking, prioritizing or choosing from a number of options.

An early example of DM software was described in 1973.&lt;ref name="Dyer"&gt;Dyer, JS (1973), "A time-sharing computer program for the solution of the multiple criteria problem", ''Management Science'', 19: 1379-83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walleniusetal"&gt;Wallenius, J, Dyer, JS, Fishburn, PC, Steuer, RE, Zionts, S and Deb, K (1992), "Multiple criteria decision making, multiattribute utility theory: The next ten years", ''Management Science'', 38: 645-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the advent of the [[World Wide Web]], most DM software was spreadsheet-based,&lt;ref name="Walleniusetal" /&gt; with the first web-based DM software appearing in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="Koksalanetal"&gt;Koksalan, M, Wallenius, J, and Zionts, S, ''Multiple Criteria Decision Making: From Early History to the 21st Century'', World Scientific Publishing: Singapore, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, many DM software products (mostly web-based) are available&lt;ref name="Weistrofferetal"&gt;Weistroffer, HR, and Li, Y, "Multiple criteria decision analysis software", Ch 29 in: Greco, S, Ehrgott, M and Figueira, J, eds, ''Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis: State of the Art Surveys Series'', Springer: New York, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orms"&gt;Oleson, S (2016), [http://www.orms-today.org/surveys/das/das.html "Decision analysis software survey"], ''OR/MS Today'' 43(5).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ishizaka"&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1002/9781118644898| title = Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis| year = 2013| last1 = Ishizaka | first1 = A. | last2 = Nemery | first2 = P. | isbn = 9781118644898}}&lt;/ref&gt; – e.g. see the comparison table below.

Most DM software focuses on ranking, prioritizing or choosing from among alternatives characterized on multiple criteria or attributes.&lt;ref name="Weistrofferetal" /&gt; Thus most DM software is based on [[decision analysis]], usually [[multi-criteria decision-making]], and so is often referred to as "decision analysis"&lt;ref name="orms" /&gt; or "multi-criteria decision-making"&lt;ref name="Weistrofferetal" /&gt; software – commonly shortened to "decision-making software". Some [[decision support systems]] include a DM software component.

==Purpose==
DM software can assist decision-makers “at various stages of the decision-making process, including problem exploration and formulation, identification of decision alternatives and solution constraints, structuring of preferences, and tradeoff judgements.”&lt;ref name="Weistrofferetal" /&gt;

The purpose of DM software is to support the analysis involved at these various stages of the decision-making process, not to replace it. DM software "should be used to support the process, not as the driving or dominating force."&lt;ref name="BeltonandStewart"&gt;Belton, V, and Stewart, TJ, ''Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis: An Integrated Approach'', Kluwer: Boston, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 

DM software frees users "from the technical implementation details [of the decision-making method employed], allowing them to focus on the fundamental value judgements".&lt;ref name="BeltonandStewart" /&gt; Nonetheless, DM software should not be employed blindly. "Before using a software, it is necessary to have a sound knowledge of the adopted methodology and of the decision problem at hand."&lt;ref name="Figueiraetal"&gt;Figueira, J, Greco, S and Ehrgott, M, "Introduction", Ch 1 in: Figueira, J, Greco, S and Ehrgott, M, eds, ''Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis: State of the Art Surveys Series'', Springer: New York, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods and features==

===Decision-making methods===
As mentioned earlier, most DM software is based on [[multi-criteria decision making]] (MCDM). MCDM involves evaluating and combining alternatives' characteristics on two or more criteria or attributes in order to rank, prioritize or choose from among the alternatives.&lt;ref name="Walleniusetal2008"&gt;Wallenius, J, Dyer, JS, Fishburn, PC, Steuer, RE, Zionts, S and Deb, K (2008), "Multiple criteria decision making, multiattribute utility theory: Recent accomplishments and what lies ahead", ''Management Science'' 54: 1336-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

DM software employs a variety of MCDM methods;&lt;ref name="BeltonandStewart" /&gt; popular examples include:
* [[Aggregated Indices Randomization Method]] (AIRM)
* [[Analytic Hierarchy Process]] (AHP)
* [[Analytic network process]] (ANP, an extension of AHP)
* [[ELECTRE|Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality]] (ELECTRE)
* [[Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique (MACBETH)]]
* [[Multi-attribute global inference of quality]] (MAGIQ)
* [[Potentially All Pairwise RanKings of all possible Alternatives]] (PAPRIKA)
* [[Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation]] (PROMETHEE)
* [[Evidential reasoning approach]] for MCDM under hybrid uncertainty

There are significant differences between these methods&lt;ref name="BeltonandStewart" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walleniusetal2008" /&gt; and, accordingly, the DM software implementing them. Such differences include:
:# The extent to which the decision problem is broken into a [[hierarchy]] of sub-problems;
:# Whether or not [[pairwise comparisons]] of alternatives and/or criteria are used to elicit decision-makers' preferences;
:# The use of [[interval scale]] or [[ratio scale]] measurements of decision-makers' preferences;
:# The number of criteria included;
:# The number of alternatives evaluated, ranging from a few (finite) to infinite;
:# The extent to which numerical scores are used to value and/or rank alternatives;
:# The extent to which incomplete rankings (relative to complete rankings) of alternatives are produced;
:# The extent to which uncertainty is modeled and analyzed.

===Software features===
In the process of helping decision-makers to rank, prioritize or choose from among alternatives, DM software products often include a variety of features and tools;&lt;ref name="Koksalanetal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weistrofferetal" /&gt; common examples include:
*[[Pairwise comparison]]
*[[Sensitivity analysis]]
*Group evaluation (teamwork)
*Web-based implementation

===Comparison of decision-making software===
DM software includes the following notable examples.

'''Employer Registration''' is the process by which a person or [[legal entity]] registers their intent to [[employ]] someone.

==Types of employers==
Employers can fall into one of two categories, people or groups who run a business and people who employ household workers.

People or legal entities who employ workers can include:
*Sole proprietors  
*Partnerships
*[[Corporation]]s, associations and [[Trust company|trust]]s 
*Nonprofit and charitable estates 
*Organizations and [[joint ventures]] 
*[[Limited liability companies]].

People who employ household workers can include:
*Private households  
*Local chapters of college  
*Local college clubs
*[[Fraternities]] or [[sororities]].

==Registration in various countries==

In the United Kingdom all employers, including self-employed persons, must register with [[HM Revenue and Customs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/payerti/getting-started/register.htm | title=How to register as an employer | publisher=HM Revenue and Customs | accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In New Zealand, registration is made to the [[Inland Revenue Department (New Zealand)|Inland Revenue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ird.govt.nz/online-services/service-name/services-r/online-register-employer.html?id=righttabs | title=Register as an employer | publisher=Inland Revenue Department | accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United States, employers apply to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] to receive an [[Employer Identification Number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Apply-for-an-Employer-Identification-Number-%28EIN%29-Online | title=Apply for an Employer Identification Number (EIN) Online | publisher=IRS | accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ethical Consumer''''' is a not-for-profit UK magazine and website which publishes information on the social, ethical and environmental behaviour of companies and issues around [[trade justice]] and  [[ethical consumerism]]. It was founded in 1989 by Rob Harrison and Jane Turner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/poll/2010/sep/14/unsung-green-hero|accessdate=15 December 2011|title =Vote for your unsung green hero |location=London|work=The Guardian|author=Shanta Barley|date=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redpepper.org.uk/Workers-of-the-world-co-operate/|accessdate=15 December 2011|title=Workers of the world, co-operate!|author=Tim Hunt|website=RedPepper.org|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The mission of the ''Ethical Consumer'' is to promote "a society where the environment is respected, where human rights are properly protected and where animals are no longer cruelly exploited."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/aboutus/ourmission/ourmanifesto.aspx|title=Our manifesto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethical Consumer publishes reports and calls for boycotts of companies deemed unethical by its findings.

==History==
''Ethical Consumer'' magazine and its associated websites are produced by the Ethical Consumer Research Association (ECRA). Between 1989 and 2009 ECRA was a [[worker cooperative|worker co-operative]], based in [[Manchester]], UK. In 2009 ECRA became a not-for-profit multi-stakeholder [[cooperative|co-operative]] consisting of worker members and investor/subscriber members.

[[Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics]], in its 25006 Economic Census, reported that there were approximately 246 medium-sized food processing industries employing 19 percent of the industrial manufacturing workforce in Bangladesh or 8 percent of the total manufacturing labor force. The [[food industry]] employs 2.45 percent of the country's total labor force and its share in the GDP was 2.01 percent in 2010. There are also numerous small scale factories and domestic units engaged in food processing throughout the country. According to some industry analysts, the food processing sector in Bangladesh is a 4.5 billion US Dollar industry. In 2010, Bangladesh exported over $700 million worth of processed food and beverages, over 60 percent of them were [[shrimp]] and [[Fishing in Bangladesh|fish]] products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=International Monetary Fund. Asia and Pacific Dept|title=Bangladesh: Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper|date=2013|publisher=International Monetary Fund|isbn=9781475543520|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Food processing in Bangladesh has traditionally been small scale, with domestic or family business using common processing knowledge for the conservation and handling of raw agricultural commodities to make them usable as food and feed. Although commercial scale food processing using modern technology especially for wheat and [[rice mill]]ing, [[mustard seed]] crushing and very limited bread and cookie manufacturing appeared during the 1960s, the growth of this sector did not gain momentum in terms of operational scale and quality until the 1980s. Recently the defining characteristics of the industry has been the processing of increasingly diverse products to meet the changing demands of the Bangladesh population. The major food processing sub-sectors in Bangladesh include [[dairy]], [[edible oil]], sugar, rice, wheat, fruit and vegetable, tea, poultry/beaf, pulses and spices and fish processing industries. Induced by the vigorous growth of the diverse middle class population of Bangladesh and the growing demands for additional consumption,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.daily-sun.com/details_yes_07-01-2013_Middle-class-boom:-The-image-of-new-Bangladesh_372_1_17_1_1.html&lt;/ref&gt; the food processing sector is set to witness further hefty expansion in the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/old/index.php?%20%20%20ref=MjBfMTJfMjFfMTJfMV84OV8xNTM3OTY=&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fuller Building''' is an office [[skyscraper]] in [[Manhattan]] located at 41 [[57th Street (Manhattan)|East 57th Street]] on the corner of [[Madison Avenue]]. It was built for the [[Fuller Construction Company]] in 1929 after they moved from the [[Flatiron Building]]. The building was designed by [[Walker &amp; Gillette]] in the [[Art Deco architecture|Art Deco style]], although in a very conservative fashion.&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt; The building's exterior features architectural sculpture by [[Elie Nadelman]], and the interior has richly decorated [[vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]]s and lobbies featuring marble walls, bronze detailing, and mosaic floors.&lt;ref name=nycland&gt;{{cite nycland}}, p.118&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Gray]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' about the building that "[i]t was built in 1929 as a jazz-age testament to the emerging commercial chic of 57th Street,"&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Gray, "Streetscapes/Fuller Building; Art Deco Delight Seeks to Recapture Its Past Glory," ''The New York Times'', June 11, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''[[AIA Guide to New York City]]'' calls it "[t]he [[Brooks Brothers]] of Art Deco: black, gray and white."&lt;ref name=aia&gt;{{cite aia5}}, p.336&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was designated a [[List of New York City Landmarks|New York City Landmark]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;

==Art galleries==
The Fuller Building is known for housing a number of New York's most important galleries including Nailya Alexander Gallery, DAG Modern, Tom Gitterman Gallery, Howard Greenberg Gallery, David Findlay Jr. Gallery, Katharina Rich Perlow Gallery, Jason McCoy Inc Gallery, [[Zabriskie Gallery]], Andrew Crispo Gallery (closed), [[André Emmerich]] Gallery (closed), [[Robert Miller (art dealer)|Robert Miller]] Gallery (moved), [[Charles Egan Gallery]] (closed), David McKee Gallery (moved), and the pioneering [[Pierre Matisse]] Gallery (closed), Lee Witkin Gallery (closed), amongst others. Although several galleries have either moved or closed, many newer ones, such as the Jason McCoy Gallery (11th floor), Hirschl &amp; Adler (9th floor) or [[Auctionata]], the online auction house, have taken their place.

'''General line of merchandise''' or '''general merchandise''' is a term used in [[retail]] and [[wholesale]] business in reference to [[merchandise]] not limited to some particular category. [[General merchandise store]]s (general stores) address this sector of retail.

According to the [[North American Industry Classification System]] 2002, the following types of general merchandise are excluded from the line carried by general stores:&lt;ref&gt;[http://stds.statcan.ca/english/naics/2002/naics02-class-search.asp?criteria=452 North American Industry Classification (NAICS) 2002, "452 General Merchandise Stores (US)"]&lt;/ref&gt;
*general line of [[building]] and [[home improvement]] materials (44411, Home Centres)
*general line of [[grocery]] items (44511, Supermarkets and Other Grocery (except Convenience) Stores)
*general line of [[used goods]] (45331, Used Merchandise Stores)

Regardless of this classification system, general stores indeed carry basic grocery items, often limited produce, basic hardware and gardening tools, and other necessaries of rural life.

==Marketing==
The currency is marketed through [[chain email]] [[multi-level marketing]],&lt;ref name="portfolio.hu"&gt;{{cite news |language=[[hungarian (language)|hungarian]] |title=Megőrül az internet az új fizetéses MLM-rendszerért - Kamu lenne? |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181031110948/https://www.portfolio.hu/vallalatok/it/megorul-az-internet-az-uj-fizeteses-mlm-rendszerert-kamu-lenne.302726.html |archivedate=31 October 2018 |url=https://www.portfolio.hu/vallalatok/it/megorul-az-internet-az-uj-fizeteses-mlm-rendszerert-kamu-lenne.302726.html |deadurl=no |trans-title=Will the Internet be crazy about a new MLM pay-per-view system - would it be Kamu? |first=Daniel |last=Huszák |date=31 October 2018 |website=[[Portfolio.hu]] |accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will not be released until a critical mass of adopters identify themselves.&lt;ref name="TiA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=26 October 2018 |first=Jemima |url=https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/10/26/1540526405000/Initiative-Q--an-elementary-pyramid-scheme-with-grandiose-ideas/ |last=Kelly |accessdate=31 October 2018 | website=[[FT Alphaville]] |title=Initiative Q: an elementary pyramid scheme with grandiose ideas [Update]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2018, [[Vox.com]] reported that more than 2 Million people had signed-up in 180 countries.&lt;ref name="not crypto"/&gt;

==Criticism==
In October 2018, Frank Chung of [[news.com.au]] wrote that the marketing style could be "perceived as a [[scam]] or [[pyramid scheme]]".&lt;ref name="news.com.au"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030052631/https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/investing/what-is-initiative-q-payment-network-insists-its-not-a-pyramid-scheme/news-story/193102b9fbb5c35d6365f7f34226908f |archivedate=30 October 2018 |url=https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/investing/what-is-initiative-q-payment-network-insists-its-not-a-pyramid-scheme/news-story/193102b9fbb5c35d6365f7f34226908f |website=[[news.com.au]] |deadurl=no |title=What is Initiative Q?

"Is Initiative Q real or fake?

Brendan Markey-Tower of [[Stuff.co.nz]] explained in November 2018 that the scheme wouldn't "make you fabulously wealthy. It is, nonetheless, an interesting idea".&lt;ref name="stuff"&gt;{{cite web |title=Initiative Q is not the new Bitcoin, but here's why the idea has value |deadurl=no |archivedate=6 November 2018 |website=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/opinion-analysis/108380918/Initiative-Q-is-not-the-new-Bitcoin-but-heres-why-the-idea-has-value |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106135456/https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/opinion-analysis/108380918/Initiative-Q-is-not-the-new-Bitcoin-but-heres-why-the-idea-has-value |first=Brendan |last=Markey-Towler |accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huszák enumerated potential problems with the scheme such as no clear crypto-currency security measures, unclear transaction/[[Foreign exchange market|exchange]] costs, and potential for [[market manipulation]] by the largest holders of currency.&lt;ref name="portfolio.hu"/&gt;

'''John Patrick''' "'''J. P.'''" '''McManus''' (born 10 March 1951) is an [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] businessman and racehorse owner.

== Early life ==
Born in [[Limerick]], [[Ireland]], McManus began his business career at his family's construction plant hire firm, and then became an on-course bookmaker at Limerick's [[Markets Field]] greyhound track. He later moved into horse ownership and punting and laying horses on the advice of his associate Jimmy Hayes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In 1982, he and his wife, Noreen, a former mental health nurse,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} bought Martinstown Stud on over {{convert|400|acre|km2}} in [[County Limerick]] from the McCalmont family.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} McManus's first horse was Cill Dara, which had been owned by the late Edenderry solicitor and gambler, Tim O'Toole.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} McManus is now [[National Hunt racing]]'s largest owner, with over 100 horses in training.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In 2006, he built a €20&amp;nbsp;million residence next to Martinstown Stud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Construction starts on JP McManus mansion, mother of all stately homes|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/construction-starts-on-jp-mcmanus-mansion-mother-of-all-stately-homes-26223793.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, he completed a €150&amp;nbsp;million home in Barbados.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Eugene |last=Phelan |title=JP McManus’ €150m Barbados mansion almost complete |url=http://www.limerickleader.ie/news/business/business-news/jp-mcmanus-150m-barbados-mansion-almost-complete-1-5571527 |work=Limerick Leader |publisher=Johnston Publishing |date=10 October 2013 |accessdate=3 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
McManus's first Cheltenham Festival winner was a horse called Mister Donovan in 1982.&lt;ref name="Legend"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Brough|title=The stuff of Legend - Independent.ie|url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/horse-racing/cheltenham/the-stuff-of-legend-30062555.html|accessdate=19 March 2018|work=Independent.ie|date=8 March 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mister Donovan was the second favourite and won the race after the favourite, Angelo Salvini, whipped around at the start.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The rider of Angelo Silvani - Alan Brown - rarely ever rode again. McManus's distinctive green-and-gold-hooped racing colours are those of the [[South Liberties GAA Club]], in Co Limerick. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The most famous{{By whom|date=May 2011}} of his horses is [[Istabraq]], a three-time winner of the [[Champion Hurdle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Connell|first1=Brian|title=Istabraq is floored again|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/istabraq-is-floored-again-1.305079|accessdate=20 March 2018|work=The Irish Times|date=28 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty time champion jockey [[Tony McCoy]] was retained as his stable jockey for a large part of his career, a role that [[Barry Geraghty]] has taken over since McCoy's retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Marcus |last=Townsend |title=Barry Geraghty to replace Tony McCoy as No 1 jockey to leading owner JP McManus.|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/racing/article-3133767/Barry-Geraghty-replace-Tony-McCoy-No-1-jockey-leading-owner-JP-McManus.html |work=Daily Mail |publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd |date=21 June 2015 |accessdate=3 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former champion jockey [[Jonjo O'Neill]] trains some of his horses at the Jackdaws Castle facility which McManus owns. He has often appeared at race meetings in recent years with the British actor Clive Owen. McManus was once close to jockeys Ted Walsh (Greasepaint at Fairyhouse one Easter Monday) and Niall Madden, T. Busteed, F. Codd and C. Roche, Micky Flynn and a slew of others. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

McManus's horse [[Don't Push It]], ridden by McCoy and trained by O'Neill, won the 2010 [[Grand National]] Steeplechase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/horseracing/7575964/Grand-National-2010-Dont-Push-It-is-lucky-15-for-Tony-McCoy-at-Aintree.html|title=Grand National 2010: Don't Push It is lucky 15 for Tony McCoy at Aintree|last=Armytage|first=Marcus|date=10 April 2010|website=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|access-date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, McManus's horse [[Synchronised (horse)|Synchronised]] won the [[Cheltenham Gold Cup]]. Synchronised went on to run in the 2012 [[John Smiths]] [[Grand National]] with champion jockey [[Tony McCoy]] on 14 April 2012. Synchronised threw McCoy on the way to the starting area; after being caught and veterinary checks were performed, Synchronised was re-entered. However, he fell at [[Becher's Brook]] and sadly broke two legs and had to be put down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Death of Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Synchronised at The Grand National 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/apr/14/synchronised-grand-national |accessdate=15 April 2012 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |location=London |first=Greg |last=Wood |date=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; McManus had his 50th Cheltenham festival winner when [[Buveur d'Air]] won the [[2017 Champion Hurdle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Grady|first1=Sean|title=JP all smiles as he notches 50th festival winner - Independent.ie|url=https://m.independent.ie/sport/horse-racing/cheltenham/jp-all-smiles-as-he-notches-50th-festival-winner-35532653.html|accessdate=19 March 2018|work=Independent.ie|date=15 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Currency exchange and business ==
A significant part of McManus' wealth, though not all, appears to have been derived as a private [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] [[Trader (finance)|trader]], though seasoned traders doubt this very much, which McManus operates from a small office over a jewellery shop in Geneva, Switzerland, his city of official residence.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} McManus also had a permanent suite at London's [[Dorchester Hotel]]{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} for over thirty years and he returns to Ireland regularly. Currencies  are apparently his speciality,{{clarify|date=November 2014}} always{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} working on the advice of his good friends [[Dermot Desmond]] and [[Joe Lewis (British businessman)|Joe Lewis]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} He now{{when|date=November 2014}} has a wide portfolio of investments from leisure centres and betting shops to pubs and nursing homes.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} He is a large shareholder in Ladbrokes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} McManus appears to have been a holder of Junior Irish bonds at the time of the downturn.

==Sporting interests==
Together with business associate [[John Magnier]], McManus built up a 28.89 per cent shareholding in [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], which they sold on to businessman [[Malcolm Glazer]] after falling out with manager [[Alex Ferguson]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In 2004, McManus began sponsoring the [[Limerick GAA]] teams, choosing to use the non-commercial Sporting Limerick promotional brand on the jerseys.

He is also a keen [[golf]]er and a close friend of [[Tiger Woods]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} who married at the [[Sandy Lane (resort)|Sandy Lane Hotel]] in Barbados, which McManus co-owns. The wedding at Sandy Lane was a gift from the owners of Sandy Lane to Woods.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

McManus routinely competes in [[Pro-Am]] golf events. He is a two-time winner of the [[Alfred Dunhill Links Championship]] pro-am pairs competition,{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} partnering with [[Pádraig Harrington]] on both occasions.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Glackin Report==
In 1991, an Irish company law inspector, solicitor John Glackin, was appointed by the Irish Government to investigate complicated dealings involving [[Dermot Desmond]] and the purchase and sale of the former Johnston Mooney and O’Brien site in [[Ballsbridge]], Dublin, to [[Telecom Éireann]]. While Desmond represented himself as an intermediary in the sale, Glackin’s report said Mr Desmond, businessman JP McManus and [[John Magnier]] were beneficiaries of the sale. Mr Desmond strenuously disputed Glackin’s findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0323/1224292846891.html | work=The Irish Times | first=Colm | last=Keena | title=Financier is no stranger to business and political rows | date=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Glackin Report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Author Gavin Sheridan |url=http://thestory.ie/2012/01/17/the-glackin-report-complete/ |title=The Glackin Report – complete – |publisher=Thestory.ie |date=17 January 2012 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoddle Investments (the vehicle through which the deal was handled) executed two contracts with Telecom Éireann for the sale of the Johnston Mooney &amp; O'Brien site for an aggregate price of £9.4&amp;nbsp;million, on 7 May 1990. Glackin concluded that McManus had loaned £1.5&amp;nbsp;million to Chestvale to purchase the site from the liquidator in August 1989. McManus made the investment through an AIB account in Jersey in the name of J&amp;N McMahon. Whether this account was to the benefit of John and Noreen McManus was not confirmed as AIB refused to break client confidentiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1993/0708/Pg001.html | work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report concluded that McManus was a beneficiary of the sale of the site to Telecom Éireann, and received £500,000 in cash from the transaction, which Dermot Desmond had stored in a tennis holdall in his safe. At paragraph 5.4.4 of the report, Glackin concludes that:

{{Quote|text="I am satisfied, on a basis that I believe is reasonable, that Mr. McManus was promised by Mr. Desmond as his consideration for the advance a share of the profits and that this was either agreed in advance or during the period between 29th June 1990 when the money was received from Telecom, and 19th July 1990 when the request was made to Ansbacher for the first cash withdrawal of £100,000. I can find no evidence that any other person received any of the cash of £500,000 and find accordingly that it was received by Mr. McManus."}}No criminal charges were made against McManus or the other principals involved resulting from the findings of the Glackin Report.

== Wealth ==
McManus's personal fortune is estimated at €4&amp;nbsp;billion.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} McManus is reputed to have been affected by the economic downturn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/specials/rich_list/article3800777.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=JP McManus | date=27 April 2008 | accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gilbert James Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, 3rd Earl of Ancaster''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|TD}} (8 December 1907 – 29 March 1983), styled '''Lord Willoughby de Eresby''' from 1910 to 1951, was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician.

Ancaster was the son of [[Gilbert Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, 2nd Earl of Ancaster]] and Eloise Lawrence Breese. He was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]].  At Cambridge, he was a member of the [[Pitt Club|University Pitt Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fletcher |first1=Walter Morley |authorlink1=Walter Morley Fletcher |others= |title=The University Pitt Club: 1835-1935 |format= |accessdate= |type= |edition=First Paperback |year=2011 |month= |origyear=1935 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-1-107-60006-5 |page=101 |pages= |chapter= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1933 he was elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] as [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Rutland and Stamford (UK Parliament constituency)|Rutland and Stamford]], a seat he held until 1950. From 1933 to 1935 Ancaster was "[[Baby of the House]]", the youngest member of the House of Commons. He served in the [[Second World War]] as a major in the [[Royal Artillery]], and was [[mentioned in despatches]]. 

In 1951 Ancaster was summoned to the [[House of Lords]] through a [[writ of acceleration]] in his father's junior title of Baron Willoughby de Eresby. He succeeded as third Earl of Ancaster later that year upon the death of his father. Apart from his political career he was also [[Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire]] from 1950 to 1975 and Joint [[Lord Great Chamberlain]] from 1951 to 1983.

Lord Ancaster married the Hon. Nancy Phyllis Louise Astor (1909-1975), daughter of [[Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor]] and [[Nancy Astor, Viscountess Astor|Nancy Witcher Langhorne]], in 1933. They had two children, one son and one daughter. His son and heir Timothy Gilbert (born 19 March 1936),&lt;ref&gt;http://thepeerage.com/p681.htm#i6807&lt;/ref&gt; went missing at sea off [[Corsica]] in 1963&lt;ref&gt;http://www.willoughbygallery.com/  The Willoughby Memorial Trust&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter W.

Lord Ancaster died in March 1983, aged 75. On his death the earldom and barony of Aveland became extinct, while he was succeeded in the ancient [[Baron Willoughby de Eresby|barony of Willoughby de Eresby]] by his daughter [[Jane Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, 28th Baroness Willoughby de Eresby|Nancy]], who also succeeded him as joint [[Lord Great Chamberlain]]. His [[Heathcote baronets|Heathcote baronetcy]] was inherited by his distant relative Gilbert Simon Heathcote.

'''Lion Gardiner''' (1599–1663) founded the first settlement in [[New York (state)|New York]] on Long Island. His legacy includes [[Gardiners Island]], which is held by his descendants.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Lion Gardiner was born in England in 1599.&lt;ref name=Gardiner84&gt;Gardiner, 84&lt;/ref&gt; He and his wife Mary left [[Woerden]] in the Netherlands and embarked for [[New England]] in the ship ''Batcheler'' on July 10, 1635. The ship arrived at [[Boston]] at the end of November in 1635. Governor [[John Winthrop]] noted Gardiner's arrival in his ''Journal'' under the date November 28: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here arrived a small Norsey bark of twenty-five tons sent by Lords Say, etc, with one Gardiner, an expert engineer or work base, and provisions of all sorts, to begin a fort at the mouth of the [[Connecticut River|Connecticut]]. She came through many great tempests; yet, through the Lord's great providence, her passengers, twelve men, two women, and all goods, all safe.&lt;ref name=Dunn207&gt;Dunn, 207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dunn161&gt;Dunn, 161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dunn783&gt;Dunn, 783&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Marriage and family===
[[Image:Lion Gardiner House, Easthampton MET DP836225.jpg|thumb|300px|Print of the Lion Gardiner House, Easthampton ([[Childe Hassam]] - 1920)]]
Shortly before departing from the Netherlands, he married Mary Willemsen Deurcant, the daughter of Dericke Willemsen Deurcant and Hachin Bastiens, who was born at Woerden about 1601.  She died in 1665 in East Hampton, New York.  She was buried next to her husband.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=gardiner&amp;GSiman=1&amp;GScid=1435258&amp;GRid=17201668&amp; Mary Willemsen Deurcant Gardiner] at [[Find A Grave]]&lt;/ref&gt;  They were the parents of three children: David, Mary and Elizabeth.

Their only son, David Gardiner, was born on April 29, 1636, at [[Saybrook, Connecticut|Saybrook]].&lt;ref name=Gardiner84&gt;Gardiner, 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gardiner86&gt;Gardiner, 86&lt;/ref&gt; He married on June 4, 1657, Mary Leringman, a widow, at St. Margaret's Parish in the City of [[Westminster, England]].

Mary Gardiner&lt;ref name=Gardiner93&gt;Gardiner, 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=gardiner&amp;GSiman=1&amp;GScid=1435258&amp;GRid=6898925&amp; Mary Gardiner Conkling] at [[Find A Grave]]&lt;/ref&gt; was born on August 30, 1638, at Saybrook, Connecticut.  She married in 1658, Jeremiah Conkling, the son of Ananias Conkling, who was from [[Nottinghamshire, England]].

Elizabeth Gardiner,&lt;ref name=Gardiner94&gt;Gardiner, 94&lt;/ref&gt; was born on September 14, 1641, at the [[Gardiners Island|Isle of Wight]], New York. She married in 1657, Arthur Howell, a son of [[Edward Howell (died 1655)|Edward Howell]] of [[Southampton, New York|Southampton, Long Island]]. Her death led to the [[Witch trials in the early modern period|witchcraft trial]] of [[Elizabeth Garlick]].&lt;ref name=Gaines80-84&gt;{{cite book|author1=Steven Gaines|authorlink1=Steven Gaines|title=Philistines at the Hedgerow: Passion and Property in the Hamptons|date=June 1, 1998|publisher=Little Brown &amp; Co|pages=80–84|isbn=9780316309417|format=hardcover|quote=Lion Gardiner would have none of this.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith102512&gt;{{cite news|author1=John Hanc|title=Before Salem, There Was the Not-So-Wicked Witch of the Hamptons|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/before-salem-there-was-the-not-so-wicked-witch-of-the-hamptons-95603019/?all|accessdate=August 15, 2015|work=Smithsonian Magazine|date=October 25, 2012|quote=Elizabeth Garlick, a local resident who often quarreled with neighbors.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
Gardiner was a military engineer in service of the Prince of Orange in the Netherlands along with [[John Mason (c. 1600–1672)|John Mason]], and he was hired by the [[Connecticut Company]] in 1635 to oversee construction of fortifications in [[Connecticut Colony]]. He finished and commanded the Saybrook Fort at the mouth of the [[Connecticut River]] during the [[Pequot War]] of 1636–37.&lt;ref name=Gardiner6&gt;Gardiner, 6&lt;/ref&gt; In 1639, he purchased an island from the [[Montaukett]] tribe which they called ''Manchonat'', located between the [[North Fork, Suffolk County, New York]] and [[South Fork, Suffolk County, New York]]. The original grant by which he acquired proprietary rights in the island made it an entirely separate and independent plantation, in no way connected either with Connecticut Colony or [[New Amsterdam]]. He was thus empowered to draft laws for church and state.  He called it the Isle of Wight, but it is now known as [[Gardiners Island]].

In 1660, Gardiner wrote the firsthand account ''Relation of the Pequot Warres''.  The manuscript was lost among various state archives until rediscovered in 1809; it was first published in 1833.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1038&amp;context=etas Lion Gardiner, ''Relation of the Pequot Warres''], 1660 Ed., W.

'''Louis Marie Lucien Henri Alphonse "Loek" Hermans ''' (born 23 April 1951) is a retired [[Netherlands|Dutch]] politician of the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD).&lt;ref name="Gingrich2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gingrich|first=Jane R.|title=Making Markets in the Welfare State: The Politics of Varying Market Reforms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t5l0YvX1ZpAC&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=27 September 2011|date=2011-07-31|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-00462-7|pages=171–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hermans studied [[public administration]] at the [[Catholic University of Nijmegen]]. From 1974 to 1978 he was a member of the [[municipal council (Netherlands)|municipal council]] of [[Nijmegen]]. From 1977 to 1990 and also in 2002, he was a member of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]]. He was [[burgemeester|mayor]] of [[Zwolle]] from 1990 to 1994. Subsequently he was [[Queen's Commissioner]] of [[Friesland]] from 1994 to 1998, and afterwards from 1998 to 2002 minister of Education, Culture, and Science in the [[Second Kok cabinet]]. 

Between 2007 and 2015 he was a member of the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]], and from 2011 to 2015 also [[Parliamentary group leader|Senate group leader]]. He resigned after a judicial verdict of mismanagement at Meavita, a health care organisation where Hermans was chair of the board of commissioners when the organisation went bankrupt in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1012/Nederland/article/detail/4175912/2015/11/02/Hermans-treedt-na-Meavita-debacle-af-als-senator-VVD.dhtml |title=Hermans treedt na Meavita-debacle af als senator VVD |language=Dutch |publisher=''[[Algemeen Dagblad]]'' |date=2 November 2015 |accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marc Ravalomanana''', [[Order of the Star and Key of the Indian Ocean|GCSK]] ({{IPA-mg|raˌvaluˈmananə̥|lang}}) (born 12 December 1949) is a [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] [[Politics of Madagascar|politician]] who was the [[President of Madagascar|President]] of [[Madagascar]] from 2002 to 2009. Born into a farming [[Merina people|Merina]] family in Imerinkasinina, near the capital city of [[Antananarivo]], Ravalomanana first rose to prominence as the founder and CEO of the vast dairy conglomerate TIKO, later launching successful wholesaler MAGRO and several additional companies.

He entered politics upon founding the Tiako Iarivo political party in 1999 and successfully ran for the position of mayor of Antananarivo, holding the position from 1999 to 2001. As mayor he improved sanitary and security conditions in the city. In August 2001 he announced his candidacy as an independent in the [[Malagasy presidential election, 2001|December 2001 presidential election]]. He then took office as President in 2002 amidst a dispute over election results in which he successfully pressed his claim to have won a majority in the first round. Under the leadership of [[Jacques Sylla]], Ravalomanana's Prime Minister from 2002 to 2007, the political party ''[[Tiako I Madagasikara|Tiako i Madagasikara]]'' (TIM) was founded in 2002 to support Ravalomanana's presidency and came to dominate legislative and local elections. He was re-elected in December 2006, again with a majority in the first round.

During Ravalomanana's presidency, Madagascar made significant advances toward development targets and experienced an average of seven per cent growth per year. His administration oversaw the construction of thousands of new schools and health clinics. Road rehabilitation aided in improving rural farmers' access to markets. The establishment of the independent anti-corruption agency BIANCO, and the adoption of diverse supporting policies resulted in a decline in government corruption. The acreage of natural areas under protection expanded in fulfillment of Ravalomanana's "Madagascar Naturally" development program. The 2007 release of Ravalomanana's comprehensive development strategy, the Madagascar Action Plan, set targets and goals for national development over his second term in the areas of governance, infrastructure, agriculture, health, economy, environment and [[fihavanana|national solidarity]].

Opposition members criticized Ravalomanana in the later period of his presidency, accusing him of increasing authoritarianism and the mixing of public and private interests. In addition, the benefits of the country's growth were not evenly spread, leading to increased wealth inequality, inflation and a decline in purchasing power for the lower and middle classes. In 2008 a controversial land lease agreement with Korean agricultural firm [[Daewoo]], the purchase of a costly presidential jet and the closure of media channels owned by opposition leader and mayor of Antananarivo, [[Andry Rajoelina]], strengthened popular disapproval of his policies. Rajoelina rallied popular support for the opposition, leading to a [[2009 Malagasy political crisis|popular uprising]] that began in January 2009 and ended two months later with Ravalomanana's resignation under pressure and Rajoelina taking control with military support in a power transfer viewed by the international community as a ''coup d'état''.

From 2009 to 2012 Ravalomanana lived in exile in South Africa, where he was engaged in active negotiations with Rajoelina and former heads of state [[Albert Zafy]] and [[Didier Ratsiraka]] to organize national elections. In December 2012 he declared he would not present himself as a candidate, then a precondition to the elections being viewed as legitimate by the international community. TGV candidate [[Hery Rajaonarimampianina]] was [[Malagasy general election, 2013|elected president]] in January 2014, defeating [[Jean-Louis Robinson]], the candidate of Marc Ravalomanana's camp. Upon attempting to return to Madagascar in October 2014 he was arrested, having been sentenced in absentia to lifelong hard labour for abuses of power by the Rajoelina administration. After his sentence was lifted and he was freed from house arrest in May 2015, Ravalomanana announced the re-opening of the Tiko business group and was re-elected the president of TIM.

== Early years ==
The youngest of eight siblings, Marc Ravalomanana was born on 12 December 1949 to a farming family of humble means in the village of Imerinkasinina, {{convert|40|km}} east of Antananarivo in [[Manjakandriana District]].&lt;ref name = PDGRepublique/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vivier 2007 13"&gt;Vivier (2007), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Ravalomanana's parents worked as peddlers before opening a small shop in a rural village in [[Toamasina Province|Tamatave Province]]. Anticipating the regional violence that erupted during the 1947 [[Malagasy Uprising]] against French colonial rule, the family relocated to a village near their ancestral lands outside Antananarivo. Once resettled in the highlands, Ravalomanana's mother worked as a seamstress in addition to assisting her husband with farming their land.&lt;ref name="Vivier 2007 13"/&gt;

Ravalomanana's family origins are [[Merina people|Merina]], the island's largest and [[Merina Kingdom|most politically prominent]] [[Ethnic groups of Madagascar|ethnic group]]. The Ravalomanana [[Architecture of Madagascar#Highlands traditions|family tomb]] is outside the historic walls of the village, a placement that would typically indicate the family's origins lie with the ''[[hova (Madagascar)|hova]]'' (commoners' caste), rather than the ''[[andriana]]'' — the traditional ruling caste among the Merina that continues to exert considerable influence over political affairs in modern Madagascar.&lt;ref name = GB451&gt;Galibert (2009), pp. 451–452&lt;/ref&gt; His later entry into the political sphere has made the question of his caste background one of popular interest and ongoing debate among the Malagasy public and press. Biographer Vivier (2007) maintains that the Ravalomanana family is andriana in origin.&lt;ref name = Vivier14&gt;Vivier (2007), pp.&amp;nbsp;14–15&lt;/ref&gt;

From a young age he regularly attended the [[Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar]] (FJKM), a [[Reformed Protestant]] church and, with 2.5 million adherents, the most important religious association in Madagascar.&lt;ref name="ISS"/&gt; As a youth he sang in the choir and later taught catechism.&lt;ref name = PDGRepublique/&gt;

From age five he began attending Anjeva public primary school, located {{convert|4|km}} from Imerinkasinina. He walked this distance daily, often departing early with baskets of watercress to sell to train passengers at the nearby station. He completed his upper primary schooling at the Protestant missionary-run Vinet private school in Ambohimalaza, where his mother arranged for him to live with a host family. After completing his primary studies he attended the Swedish missionary-run technical secondary school in [[Ambatomanga, Arivonimamo|Ambatomanga]]. He lived with one of his brothers and began producing and selling yogurt in individual serving pots to local villagers and students as a means to subsidize his studies. During this time he met his future wife, [[Lalao Ravalomanana|Lalao Rakotonirainy]], a classmate at the secondary school. In 1972, in a climate of increasing political instability and widespread school-based protests against the [[Philibert Tsiranana|Tsiranana]] administration, Ravalomanana dropped out of the school's eleventh grade program at the age of 23; he then pursued further technical training in [[Fianarantsoa]].&lt;ref name = Vivier14/&gt; He participated in [[NGO]]-sponsored entrepreneurship training in Sweden&lt;ref name = PDGRepublique/&gt; and Germany,&lt;ref&gt;Galibert (2009), p. 453&lt;/ref&gt; and business studies in Denmark underwritten by the Danish ambassador.&lt;ref name="ISS"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marcus |first=Richard R. |title=Political Change in Madagascar: populist democracy or neopatrimonialism by another name? |journal=Institute for Security Studies Paper |volume=89 |pages=1–19 |date=August 2004 |accessdate=7 July 2012 |url=http://www.iss.org.za/pubs/papers/89/Paper89.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68yJekKfl?url=http://www.iss.org.za/pubs/papers/89/Paper89.pdf |archivedate=7 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to Madagascar, he wed Lalao on 12 November 1974;&lt;ref name = Vivier14/&gt; their marriage produced one daughter and three sons.&lt;ref name = presidencechirac/&gt;

== Entrepreneur ==
Upon completing his studies, Ravalomanana returned to Manjakandriana District, where he and his family began making and selling homemade yogurts, a common artisanal product in the highlands region. On his bicycle, he collected milk from farmers in neighboring towns, gradually increasing his production and clientele.&lt;ref name = conflitdentrepreneurs&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Pellerin | first = Mathieu | title = Madagascar: un conflit d'entrepreneurs? | journal = Politique Africaine | volume = 113 | pages = 152–165 | date = March 2009 | accessdate = 20 September 2013 | url = http://www.politique-africaine.com/numeros/pdf/conjonctures/113152.pdf | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opened his first yogurt and cheese production center in 1977 in [[Sambaina]] on land he named ''[[Rova (Madagascar)|Rova]]-Tiko'' ("Tiko Palace"), where he would build the first Tiko factory several years later. His wife handled the administrative and accounting side of the business from Ankadivato, where the storage facility for finished products was located.&lt;ref name = Vivier18&gt;Vivier (2007), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1970s, Ravalomanana's dairy business employed five salaried staff members&lt;ref name = PDGRepublique/&gt; and was distributing its products in stores across Antananarivo.&lt;ref name = Vivier18/&gt;

Ravalomanana solicited a loan from the ''[[French Development Agency|Agence Française de Développement]]'' to further expand his business, but this request was denied, souring his view of France. His subsequent request to the [[World Bank]] for 1.5 million [[US dollars]] was approved, and in 1982 he founded the Tiko company.&lt;ref name = PDGRepublique/&gt; The representative of the World Bank to Madagascar at the time, José Broffman, secured the loan with exceptionally favorable reimbursement conditions that enabled Ravalomanana to sell his products at a lower cost than other small dairy producers, which gradually put his most significant competitors out of business. Broffman later left his post at the World Bank to become a principal investor in the company, joined by private investors from [[South Africa]], [[Germany]] and the [[United States]]. As Tiko continued to grow, the entrepreneur began incorporating imported ingredients such as powdered milk from South Africa (constituting 80 per cent of the composition of Tiko dairy products) and surplus butter from Europe, further improving the profitability of his business and enabling additional diversification.&lt;ref name = RJ3I&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Raison-Jourde  | first = Francoise  |author2=Raison, Jean-Pierre  | title = Ravalomanana et la troisieme independence? |issue = Madagascar, les urnes et la rue  | journal = Politique Africaine  | volume = 86  | pages = 5–17  | publisher = Karthala Editions  | location = Paris  | year = 2002  | language = French  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yMMhuCMDkBkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  | isbn=9782811100643  | accessdate = 8 July 2012  | doi = 10.3917/polaf.086.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiko Group first concentrated exclusively on the production of dairy products before expanding into fruit juices, ice cream, cooking oil and carbonated beverages.&lt;ref name = PDGRepublique/&gt; The Tiko slogan printed on many of the group's products, ''Vita Malagasy'' ("Made in Madagascar"), reflected Ravalomanana's national pride and his vision that Madagascar should develop a larger capacity to produce quality goods for distribution for national and international markets.&lt;ref name="ISS"/&gt;

Ravalomanana cultivated political relationships to facilitate the continued growth of Tiko in spite of an economic climate non-conducive to free enterprise under the Socialist administration of Ratsiraka. Early support in the 1980s came from the Supreme Counselor of the Revolution Manandafy Rakotonirina, then-Minister of Finance Rakotovao Razakaboana,&lt;ref name = PDGRepublique/&gt; and another minister, Justin Rarivoson. By the mid-1980s, the profitability of his Tiko enterprise enabled Ravalomanana to purchase a costly villa formerly owned by French colonial governor Leon Reallon in the central Faravohitra neighborhood of Antananarivo.&lt;ref name = Vivier18/&gt;

[[File:ATR 42-300 Tiko Air (5R-TIK).jpg|thumb|left|Distribution airplane owned by Tiko]]

In 1997, under the pretext of concern about [[mad cow disease]], Ratsiraka obstructed Ravalomanana's plans to build a farm stocked with imported high-yield milk cows. Ravalomanana overcame the objection by breeding high-yield cows locally, thereby further boosting Tiko production. Later that same year, Ratsiraka's daughters began competing with Tiko by importing and reselling vegetable oil under the brand name "Eden".&lt;ref name = Vivier26&gt;Vivier (2007), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Norbert Ratsirahonana]] declared himself a candidate in the 1997 presidential elections against Ratsiraka and [[Albert Zafy]], Ravalomanana provided significant financial contributions to the Ratsirahonana campaign in return for tax exemptions on his edible oil products&lt;ref name = PDGRepublique/&gt; for a period of five years.&lt;ref name = RJ3I/&gt; The profits he consequently earned were reinvested to create the Magro wholesale company in 1998.&lt;ref name = PDGRepublique/&gt; By 2001, over a dozen principal warehouses throughout the country enabled widespread distribution of Tiko products to urban and rural areas, with a flagship warehouse in the Akorandrano neighborhood of Antananarivo.&lt;ref name="ISS"/&gt;

The Ratsiraka administration launched an inquiry into Tiko business practices in September 2000 and issued an executive decision in June 2001 that the company should be shut down for failure to adhere to a 1996 agreement requiring Tiko to create jobs and produce low-cost vegetable oil; this ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court on 16 October 2002.&lt;ref name = Vivier27&gt;Vivier (2007), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; A number of lawsuits have been filed over Ravalomanana's business practices,&lt;ref name = RJ3I/&gt; including a court judgment on the eve of the 2001 presidential election requiring the payment of between 200 and 363 billion [[Malagasy franc]]s in Tiko back taxes,&lt;ref name = Vivier27/&gt;&lt;!--30.4-60.62 million Euros in 2007--&gt; but all were either dismissed or ended in an out-of-court settlement; none resulted in a criminal conviction.&lt;ref name="ISS"/&gt;

At its height during the period of Ravalomanana's presidency, Tiko provided direct salaried employment to between 1,000 and 3,000 staff and indirect employment to over 10,000. The group was the largest dairy producer in the country and a leader in the national agribusiness sector.&lt;ref name="ISS"/&gt; The success of his enterprises made Ravalomanana a wealthy man. In the mandatory self-disclosure of wealth submitted to the High Constitutional Court in 2000 by all presidential candidates, Ravalomanana declared ownership of 27 properties valued at over two billion Malagasy francs.&lt;!--334,000 Euros in 2007--&gt; He owned 90 per cent of Tiko Inc., 80 per cent of Tiko Agri and 50 per cent of Tiko Oil Products, a portfolio worth 13.1 billion Malagasy francs,&lt;!--2.2 million Euros in 2007--&gt; and declared 77 million Malagasy francs in annual revenues.&lt;!--18,000 Euros in 2007--&gt; Vivier (2007) demonstrates that the valuation of Ravalomanana's holdings and his annual revenue in particular were significantly underestimated.&lt;ref name = Vivier26/&gt;

== Mayor of Antananarivo ==
In 1999, Ravalomanana decided to register as an independent candidate in the Antananarivo mayoral election rather than finance a representative from another party.&lt;ref name = PDGRepublique/&gt; The president of the [[Judged by Your Work Party]] (AVI), [[Norbert Lala Ratsirahonana]], had met the entrepreneur several years prior in relation to Tiko business matters. The two discussed the possibility that Ravalomanana could run as an AVI candidate, but this idea was abandoned.&lt;ref name = Vivier21&gt;Vivier (2007), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; His principal opponent, former Prime Minister [[Guy Willy Razanamasy]] of the [[Association for the Rebirth of Madagascar]] (AREMA party), suffered from low popularity, leading Ratsiraka to tacitly support Ravalomanana's candidature against the representative of his own party.&lt;ref name = PDGRepublique/&gt; By contrast, Ravalomanana was an unknown, attracting attention primarily for his considerable success in employment and wealth creation through Tiko, and his esteemed role as Vice President of the Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar, which was vocal in its support for the candidate.&lt;ref name = GB451/&gt;

Supporters among Ravalomanana's high-level Tiko staff established a group to promote his campaign, which he named ''Tiako Iarivo'' ("I Love Antananarivo").&lt;ref name = PDGRepublique/&gt; The candidate spent over 700 million Malagasy francs on the campaign,&lt;!--105,000 Euros in 2007--&gt; drawn from the proceeds of his business and private donations.&lt;ref name = Vivier22&gt;Vivier (2007), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; His campaign staff widely distributed promotional posters featuring the candidate's face, name and slogan, and handed out free Tiko yogurts and boxes of milk to the public.&lt;ref name = SFGATE/&gt; Ravalomanana's campaign posters often featured the Tiko logo and images of the candidate riding a bicycle laden with milk canisters to play on his image as a simple and poor farmer who, through intelligence, determination and responsible management, succeeded in developing a thriving business and would apply these same skills to develop the capital city. The Ravalomanana campaign received support on the basis of his evident success as a manager, his leadership in the Christian community and his non-alignment with Ratsiraka's AREMA party, as well as his relative youthfulness and physical attractiveness to female voters. The campaign opened on 2 November 1999, and by 8 November Ravalomanana held a led in the polls.&lt;ref name = Vivier21/&gt; In the 14 November municipal elections, Ravalomanana was elected mayor of Antananarivo with 45 per cent of the votes.&lt;ref name=presidencechirac&gt;{{cite web|title=Madagascar : biographie de M.

Upon being elected mayor, Ravalomanana prioritized sanitation, security and public administration in the capital city.&lt;ref name = PDGRepublique/&gt; Provided a budget of approximately 11 million US dollars to manage Antananarivo, Ravalomanana took initiative to secure additional funds.

In an August 2000 interview with the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', Ravalomanana expressed the belief that development in Madagascar would require greater personal responsibility among the Malagasy populace, a better business environment, environmental protection and reduced corruption. In response to increasing media speculation that he could be a strong candidate for the presidency, he stated that he was ambivalent toward the prospect, declaring "I miss the freedom of business, the ease of getting things done."&lt;ref name = SFGATE/&gt;

Ravalomanana received counsel and support for his campaign from the former mayor of Baltimore and a director of former US President [[Bill Clinton]]'s campaign.&lt;ref name = RJ3I/&gt;

Ravalomanana's announcement sparked retaliatory actions by the Ratsiraka administration, resulting in frequent defamatory attacks in the press and a court judgment fining him 300 billion Malagasy francs (55.6 million [[Euro]]s) in unpaid back taxes,&lt;ref name = PDGRepublique/&gt; and two other lawsuits in relation to his management of Tiko, which were later settled out of court.&lt;ref name="ISS"/&gt; These attacks were denounced by spokesmen for Ravalomanana's campaign support network, ''[[Tiako I Madagasikara|Tiako iMadagasikara]]'' (TIM), and in speeches the candidate delivered in urban and rural areas across the island, with travel made possible by his considerable personal wealth&lt;ref name = PDGRepublique/&gt; and the airplane and seven distribution helicopters registered to Tiko. Tiko distribution channels were used to distribute posters, baseball caps, tee-shirts and other promotional materials.&lt;ref name = RJ3I/&gt;

October 2001 polls showed Ravalomanana ahead of Ratsiraka. Following the December election, official results put Ravalomanana in first place, with 46 per cent, against Ratsiraka's 40 per cent; without a majority, a run-off would be required between the two candidates. Ravalomanana, claiming to have won a majority in the first round, refused to participate in a run-off, instead demanding that the High Constitutional Court review the votes. Ratsiraka's supporters then blockaded the capital, which Ravalomanana's supporters controlled. Ravalomanana declared himself president on 22 February 2002. After a recount, on 29 April 2002 the High Constitutional Court declared that Ravalomanana had won 51.3 percent of the vote, enough for a narrow first-round victory. Je was sworn in on 6 May. Ravalomanana dispatched soldiers to bring pockets of resistance under control, with incidents of unrest continuing until Ratsiraka fled into exile on 5 July 2002 after losing control of most of the country's provinces.&lt;ref name="Cornwall 2003" /&gt;

=== First term ===

Upon election to the presidency, Ravalomanana sought to mitigate the negative economic impact of the eight-month political standoff with Ratsiraka, which had cost Madagascar millions of dollars in lost tourism and trade revenue as well as damage to infrastructure, including bombed bridges and buildings damaged by arson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=47721 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/604iepG98?url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=47721 |archivedate=10 July 2011 |title=Madagascar: Former president sentenced to five years in prison |publisher=Irinnews.org |date=17 December 2003 |accessdate=25 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He enacted a series of new laws, policies and reforms that sought to efface remaining traces of Ratsiraka's socialist ideology and replace it with a firmly capitalist, market-driven economic environment. &lt;!--AGOA--&gt; In a break with tradition, the new head of state moved away from reliance on its principal trading partner, France, and cultivated relationships with partners such as Germany, the United States and South Korea as part of his strategy for Madagascar's economic development.&lt;ref name="ISS"/&gt; He partnered with advisers at [[Harvard University]] to launch a rapid results initiative designed to spur rapid economic growth.&lt;ref name = Naturally/&gt; In 2004 the World Bank approved his administration's [[Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper]], entitled ''Madagascar Naturellement'' (Madagascar Naturally), in which he enshrined the principle of environmental conservation as inseparable from sustainable economic growth.&lt;ref name = Naturally&gt;{{cite web |last = Ravalomanana | first = Marc | title = Report from Africa: Madagascar Naturellement: Birth Control Is My Environmental Priority | work = WorldView Magazine | publisher = Peace Corps | date = Fall 2006 | url = http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/Ravalomanana12.pdf | accessdate = 13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative economic impact of the political crisis was gradually overcome by Ravalomanana's progressive economic and political policies, which encouraged investments in education and ecotourism, facilitated foreign direct investment and cultivated trading partnerships both regionally and internationally.&lt;ref name="ISS"/&gt;

At the 2003 [[Durban]] World Parks Congress he pledged to more than triple [[National parks of Madagascar|protected natural areas]] on the island from {{convert|1.6|e6ha|sqmi}} to {{convert|6|e6ha|sqmi}} – ten per cent of the country's land surface – over five years.&lt;ref name = Naturally/&gt; In 2004 he established BIANCO (''Bureau Indépendant Anti-Corruption''), an anti-corruption bureau, which resulted in reduced corruption among Antananarivo's lower-level bureaucrats in particular, although high-level officials have not been prosecuted by the bureau.&lt;ref name="CrossroadsMarcus"/&gt; That same year, the [[International Monetary Fund]] agreed to write off half Madagascar's debt.

After being elected president in 2002, Ravalomanana remained a prominent player in the private sector. The 2003 privatisation of SINPA (''Societe d'lnteret National Malgache des Produits Agricoles''), the state agricultural corporation, and SOMACODIS (''Société Malgache de Collecte et de Distribution''), the national trading corporation, provided Ravalomanana the opportunity to purchase both entities, which he incorporated under Tiko.&lt;ref name = TikoPressure/&gt; He also created a public roads construction company, ''Asa Lalana Malagasy''.&lt;ref name="CrossroadsMarcus"/&gt;

The benefits of economic growth during the Ravalomanana administration were not evenly distributed, leading to higher costs of living for all Malagasy and a deepening poverty among much of the population with fewer able to increase their wealth.

Furthermore, his own companies tended to be awarded most of the government contracts for which they bid, although this occurred transparently and legally, due to a weak legal framework around conflict of interest. Critics condemned his tendency to make unilateral decisions and disregard the views of his entourage, a number of whom resigned or were dismissed.

=== Second term ===
During his second term, Ravalomanana oversaw revisions to the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Renamed the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP), this new strategy was intended to build on the successes of his first term to accelerate and expand national development. The plan focused on "the eight commitments": accountable governance, more extensive and interconnected infrastructure, agriculture based rural development, family planning and health (particularly fighting [[HIV/AIDS]]), strong economic growth, environmental protection, and the traditional principle of ''[[fihavanana]]'' (solidarity). The plan's targets were aligned with the [[United Nations]]' [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Madagascar Action Plan 2007–2012: A Bold And Exciting Plan For Rapid Development | publisher = United Nations | year = 2006 | url = https://www.un.org/esa/coordination/Alliance/MADAGASCAR%20ACTION%20PLAN.htm | accessdate = 26 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As construction of schools and hiring of teachers continued in Ravalomanana's second term, additional measures were adopted to improve education quality, including a shift to [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] as the language of instruction in grades one to five, expansion of primary schools to house grades six and seven for greater access to lower secondary schooling and an overhaul of the national curriculum, which had been modified piecemeal since [[French Madagascar|independence from France]] in 1960.&lt;ref name=WBeducation/&gt; In the [[Madagascar constitutional referendum, 2007|Constitution of 2007]], English was added to Malagasy and French as an official language, in reflection of Ravalomanana's goal to increase Madagascar's participation in the global market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Madagascar: 2007 Constitutional referendum |publisher=Electoral Institute for the Sustainability of Democracy in Africa |date=June 2010 |url=http://www.eisa.org.za/WEP/mad2007results.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828215517/http://www.eisa.org.za/WEP/mad2007results.htm |archivedate=28 August 2008 |dead-url=yes |accessdate=22 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 December 2008, the government closed Viva TV, owned by mayor of Antananarivo [[Andry Rajoelina]], stating that a Viva interview with exiled former head of state Didier Ratsiraka was "likely to disturb peace and security".&lt;ref name="CrossroadsMarcus" /&gt; This move catalyzed the political opposition and a public already dissatisfied with other recent actions undertaken by Ravalomanana,&lt;ref name="Crisisgroup1"/&gt; including a July 2008 deal with [[Daewoo|Daewoo Logistics]] to lease half the island's arable land for South Korean cultivation of corn and palm oil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Walt | first = Vivienne | title = The Breadbasket of South Korea: Madagascar | newspaper = Time Magazine | date = 23 November 2008 | url = http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1861145,00.html | accessdate = 2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the November 2008 purchase of a second presidential jet at a cost of 60 million U.S. dollars.&lt;ref name="Crisisgroup1"/&gt; Within a week, Rajoelina met with twenty of Madagascar's most prominent opposition leaders (referred to in the press as the "Club of 20"), to develop a joint statement demanding that the Ravalomanana administration improve its adherence to democratic principles. The demand was broadcast at a press conference, where Rajoelina promised to dedicate a politically open public space in the capital, which he would call ''Place de la democratie'' ("Democracy Square").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=R.C. |title=Andry Rajoelina réunit le "Club des 20" |newspaper=Madagascar Tribune |date=17 December 2008 |url=http://www.madagascar-tribune.com/Andry-Rajoelina-reunit-le-Club-des,10387.html |accessdate=6 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BCh6k4FY?url=http://www.madagascar-tribune.com/Andry-Rajoelina-reunit-le-Club-des%2C10387.html |archivedate=6 October 2012 |language=French |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in January 2009, Rajoelina led a series of political rallies in downtown Antananarivo where he gave voice to the frustration that Ravalomanana's policies had triggered, particularly among the economically marginalized and members of the political opposition. On 3 February, Ravalomanana dismissed Rajoelina as mayor of Antananarivo and appointed a [[Special delegation (France)|special delegation]] headed by Guy Randrianarisoa to manage the affairs of the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Madagascar sacks capital city mayor |newspaper=AFP |date=3 February 2009 |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jSsw9Mt5_TWeAwuwVr5S24GMvwIg |accessdate=6 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219173004/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jSsw9Mt5_TWeAwuwVr5S24GMvwIg |archivedate=19 February 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rajoelina incited demonstrators on 7 February to occupy the president's office in [[Ambohitsorohitra Palace]] in central Antananarivo.

After coming to power, Rajoelina's HAT pursued legal action against Ravalomanana. On 2 June 2009, Ravalomanana was fined 70 million US dollars (42 million British pounds) and sentenced to four years in prison for alleged abuse of office which, according to HAT Justice Minister [[Christine Razanamahasoa]], included the December 2008 purchase of a presidential jet worth $60 million.

Both Ravalomanana and Rajoelina were requested by the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) to renounce participation in the [[Malagasy general election, 2013|2013 Malagasy presidential elections]] in order to hasten an end to the ongoing political crisis.

'''Mikael Storsjö''' (born December 22, 1957) is a Finnish [[Information Technology|IT entrepreneur]], journalist and [[non-governmental organization]] activist. He is a board member of [[FINROSFORUM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EFFI:n hallitus |url= http://www.effi.org/yhdistys/hallitus.html |publisher= EFFI |accessdate=25 February 2011|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his clashes with the Finnish and Swedish authorities concerning the [[Internet hosting service|hosting]] of the [[Kavkaz Center]]'s website on his [[Server (computing)|server]]s. In 2011–2012, he has also been involved in a court case, in which he was found guilty of arranging illegal entry into Finland of 25 [[Chechens]].&lt;ref name=HS&gt;{{cite news|title=Court of Appeals hands down suspended sentence for helping Chechens enter Finland illegally|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Court+of+Appeals+hands+down+suspended+sentence+for+helping+Chechens+enter+Finland+illegally/1329104310775|accessdate=June 20, 2012|newspaper=[[Helsingin Sanomat]]|date=June 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hosting of Kavkaz Center in Finland==
In [[Finland]] Storsjö became a public figure in October 2004, when the [[Lithuania|Lithuanian government]] banned the Kavkaz Center website, and Storsjö moved the website to his server in Finland. The [[Finnish Security Intelligence Service]] (FSIS) then confiscated his servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tsetseenisivut julkaistiin sananvapauden takia ‘Freedom of speech as motivation for publishing the Chechen website |url=http://www.mbnet.fi/uutiset/index.asp?Uutinen=1577 |publisher=Mikrobitti |accessdate=25 February 2011 |language=Finnish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929071203/http://www.mbnet.fi/uutiset/index.asp?Uutinen=1577 |archivedate=29 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the public discussion that then ensued, there was a general agreement that the authorities had violated the freedom of speech with their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Journalists complain of blow to Finnish freedom of expression |url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/1076154535007 |publisher= [[Helsingin Sanomat]] |accessdate=15 November 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After these events, Storsjö has continued to support Kavkaz Center by offering them the use of his servers both in Finland and in [[Sweden]].

Kavkaz Center is an internet news agency which publishes news on [[Chechnya]] and the [[Caucasus]] region from the point of view of the [[Mujahideen]] warriors. It is believed that the Kavkaz Center is in the control of the “minister of public relations” of the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]], [[Movladi Udugov]]. Udugov belongs to the Islamic warriors of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Chechnya Weekly Volume 7, Issue 38 (October 05, 2006), Andrei Smirnov: Dokku Umarov: Between Jihad and the Struggle for Freedom: “This rhetoric of Dokku Umarov could not be ignored by the Islamic wing of the insurgency. The Kavkaz-Center website, which is controlled by Movladi Udugov, started to censor Umarov’s statements.” {{cite web |title= Dokku Umarov: Between Jihad and the Struggle for Freedom |url= http://jamestown.org/chechnya_weekly/article.php?articleid=2372592 |publisher= The Jamestown Foundation |accessdate= not accessible on 25 February 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181057/http://www.jamestown.org/chechnya_weekly/article.php?articleid=2372592# |archive-date= 2007-09-30 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publishing activities of the Kavkaz Center are known to be a sore point for [[Russia]], which is involved in a war in the area. Russia has tried to resort to diplomatic means in order to prevent the website from being hosted in various countries, including Sweden and Finland. The Russian foreign minister [[Sergei Lavrov]] has said that the website is being used to incite people to conduct terrorist activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Separatist website finds a home in Sweden, Chechnya Weekly Volume 5, Issue 43 |url= http://www.jamestown.org/chechnya_weekly/article.php?articleid=2371326 |publisher= The Jamestown Foundation |accessdate= not accessible on 25 February 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181042/http://www.jamestown.org/chechnya_weekly/article.php?articleid=2371326# |archive-date= 2007-09-30 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who defend the website, however, argue that mediation of news based on pluralistic values is the only way that both parties of the conflict can make their views known to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Sananvapaus joutui pikaoikeuteen ‘Freedom of speech subjected to deliberation of an instant court’ |url= http://www.finrosforum.fi/Document/KC/HS_21_10_2004_pikaoikeus.htm |publisher= [[Helsingin Sanomat]] |accessdate= 17 July 2007 |language= Finnish |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928051006/http://www.finrosforum.fi/Document/KC/HS_21_10_2004_pikaoikeus.htm |archivedate= 28 September 2007 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kavkaz Center website was closed in [[Lithuania]] in the autumn of 2004, on request by [[Russia]], after the [[Beslan school hostage crisis]], when the website had published a message from [[Shamil Basayev]], in which he assumed responsibility for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kremlin pressures Lithuania to close pro-Chechen website |url=http://www.ifex.org/es/content/view/full/61405/ |publisher=IFEX 21 September 2004 |accessdate=17 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this Storsjö offered the website the services of his servers in his web hotel. Finnish Foreign Minister [[Erkki Tuomioja]] then wrote in his own website, after he found out about the existence of the website on a Finnish server, that “''[in Finland] measures were taken immediately to close down the website''” and that the website had now been closed down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Tuomioja verkkosivullaan Kaukaasia-nettisivujen sulkemisesta ‘Tuomioja on his website about Caucasian website having been closed down’ |url= http://formin.finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=62549&amp;nodeid=15642&amp;contentlan=1&amp;culture=fi-FI |publisher= Finnish Foreign Ministry, 2006 |accessdate=  |language= Finnish }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|One cannot accept in the name of freedom of speech any materials on the television, in the newspapers or in the internet in which people are incited to murder the president of a foreign nation or in which people who commit suicide bombings are praised.|Erkki Tuomioja}}

Later Tuomioja stated that the ''actions by the authorities may have been initiated at the same time or after the information about the opening of the website was passed on to the foreign minister, but these actions were not based on any instructions from the Foreign Ministry, to whose jurisdiction they do not by any means belong.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ulkoministeriö ei ohjeistanut sivuston tutkintaa ‘The Foreign Ministry did not give instructions about investigating the website’ |url=http://www.finrosforum.fi/Document/KC/HS_22_10_2004_Ulkoministerio_ei_ohjeistanut.htm |publisher=[[Helsingin Sanomat]] 22 October 2004 |accessdate=17 July 2007 |language=Finnish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928051025/http://www.finrosforum.fi/Document/KC/HS_22_10_2004_Ulkoministerio_ei_ohjeistanut.htm |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the acting head of the FSIS, Mr. Hannu Moilanen, the actions of the security intelligence service were approved from a high level: ''We were in good co-operation with the head of the state, who blessed our actions and considered them quite necessary.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tshetsheenisivusto suljettiin Suomen hallituksen tuella ‘The Chechen website was closed down with approval from the Finnish government’ |url=http://www.finrosforum.fi/Document/KC/HS_14_10_2004_hallituksen_tuella.htm |publisher=[[Helsingin Sanomat]] 14 October 2004 |accessdate=17 July 2007 |language=Finnish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928051012/http://www.finrosforum.fi/Document/KC/HS_14_10_2004_hallituksen_tuella.htm |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Finnish Security Intelligence Service first asked the internet operator [[TeliaSonera]] to disconnect Storsjö’s server from the web. TeliaSonera did not agree to this, since in their opinion the Chechen rebels website did not break any law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Operaattori: Tshetsheenien internetsivut eivät rikkoneet lakia ‘Operator: The website of the Chechens did not break law |url=http://www.finrosforum.fi/Document/KC/HS_20_10_2004_Operaattori.htm |publisher=[[Helsingin Sanomat]] 20 October 2004 |accessdate=17 July 2007 |language=Finnish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928051044/http://www.finrosforum.fi/Document/KC/HS_20_10_2004_Operaattori.htm |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this the Finnish Security Intelligence Service asked Storsjö to remove the Kavkaz Center website from his server, but Storsjö refused to do this, citing freedom of speech as his grounds. On the following day representatives of the Security Intelligence Service went to see an associate of Storsjö in order to discuss the matter, and the associate handed the server over to the Security Intelligence Service so that they could investigate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Heikki Saari |title=Supo vastaan Storsjö, Sananvapauden soturi ‘Security Intelligence Service vs Storsjö, champion of free speech’ |url=http://www.seura.fi/?id=4734 |publisher=Seura |accessdate=18 April 2007 |language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to these events, president of the Committee on Constitutional Matters of the [[Parliament of Finland|Finnish Parliament]], MP [[Kimmo Sasi]] submitted a written question to the government on the actions of the Security Intelligence Service, to which [[Minister of the Interior (Finland)|Minister of the Interior]], Mr. [[Kari Rajamäki]] replied, “that there was nothing in the actions of the Security Intelligence Service that would merit a reprimand.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.digitoday.fi/page.php?page_id=11&amp;news_id=200415940 | title = Tshetsheenien sivut julki ‘Chechen website cleared for publication’ | accessdate = 2007-04-18 | location= | date= | work= Digitoday | first= Markku | last= Pervilä }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.eduskunta.fi/faktatmp/utatmp/kk_808_2004.htm | title = KIRJALLINEN KYSYMYS 808/2004 Ns. tshetsheenisivujen sulkeminen ‘Written question 808/2004, so called closing down of the Chechen website’ | accessdate =17 July 2007 | location= | date= | work=Eduskunta ‘[[Parliament of Finland|Finnish Parliament]]’ | first= Kimmo | last= Sasi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his visit to Finland, Russian Prime Minister [[Mikhail Fradkov]] thanked Finnish Prime Minister [[Matti Vanhanen]] for having closed down the Kavkaz Centerin website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.ts.fi/arkisto/haku.aspx?ts=1,0,0,0:0:261279,0 | title =Pääministerit vauhdittivat neuvotteluja Saimaan kanavasta |trans-title=Prime Minister Speed up Negotiations about the Saimaa Canal | accessdate =18 April 2007 | location= | date= | work=[[Turun Sanomat]] | first= STT ([[Suomen Tietotoimisto]]) | last= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When it was no longer possible to operate in Finland, Storsjö transferred Kavkaz Center to his servers in [[Sweden]], but when it was found out that the website was legal in Finland, he opened it on his Finnish servers.

The Russian ambassador to Finland, Mr. [[Vladimir Grinin]] then asked Finnish members of Parliament why it was allowed in Finland to keep the Kavkaz Center website on Finnish servers and nothing had been done about it. On the basis of discussion carried out by members of the public, the MPs answered him that freedom of speech is in force in Finland and that politicians cannot interfere with websites so long as no law is broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.finrosforum.fi/Document/KC/HS_19_11_2004_Venajan_lahettilas.htm | title =Venäjän lähettiläs kyseli kansanedustajilta tshetsheenisivuista ‘Russian Ambassador Asked Members of Parliament About Chechen Website’ | accessdate =2007-11-11 | location = | date =18 July 2007 | work =[[Helsingin Sanomat]] 19 November 2004 | first =STT ([[Suomen Tietotoimisto]]) | last = | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070928051019/http://www.finrosforum.fi/Document/KC/HS_19_11_2004_Venajan_lahettilas.htm | archivedate =28 September 2007 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Storsjö has also been involved in arm wrestling with the authorities and the Russian ambassador in Sweden. However, both a court of law and the [[Chancellor of Justice]] have ruled that the contents of the website are legal and that there are no grounds on which it should be closed down.

The great amount of publicity that kavkazcenter.com got in Finland and the significance of these developments have to do with the principle of freedom of speech and questions relating to it, and thus the case was widely commented upon in the editorials of Finnish newspapers and elsewhere in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sananvapautta loukkaava lopetus ‘A Closing Down That Violates Free Speech’ |url=http://www.ts.fi/arkisto/haku.aspx?ts=1,0,0,0:0:260125,0 |publisher=[[Turun Sanomat]], 22 October 2004 |accessdate=19 July 2007 |language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discussion has helped to draw the line at which the authority of courts of law and the police ends in matters relating to freedom of speech.

==Alleged Financial Support for Chechen Terrorists==
Storsjö said in May 2005 an interview with [[Turun Sanomat]] that he is collecting money through donations that anyone can make to an association called “Support for information service on the Caucasus”, from which moneys are directed to the support of Kavkaz Center. He did, however, admit that the moneys end up with Chechen rebels, among whom there are “elements that have tendencies towards terrorism.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Lehtitieto: Tshetsheeneille aiotaan kerätä Suomesta rahaa (‘Newspaper: Intentions to collect money for Chechens in Finland’) |url= http://www.mtv3.fi/uutiset/txt/kotimaa.shtml/arkistot/kotimaa/2005/05/367231 | publisher= MTV3 | accessdate=2007-04-18 | language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.turunsanomat.fi/kotimaa/?ts=1,3:1002:0:0,4:2:0:1:2005-05-12,104:2:301838,1:0:0:0:0:0: | title = Tshetshenia-sivusto aukeaa perjantaina salaisella palvelimella (‘Chechen web pages to open on Friday on a secret server’) | accessdate = 2005-05-12 | location= | date=12 May 2005 | work=[[Turun Sanomat]] | first= Taneli | last= Heikka | language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://football.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,,1684473,00.html | title = Tshetseeneille aloitetaan rahankeruu netissä (‘Collection of money for Chechens to begin in the internet’) | accessdate = 2007-04-18 | location= | date=12 May 2005 | work= Tietokone | first= Satu | last= Summa }}&lt;/ref&gt; The matter was first made public by [[Aamulehti]], and Storsjö said that this was a false report, since no association called “Support for information service on the Caucasus” ever has existed. It is not possible to find out anything about this alleged association with the Google search engine, and no such association exists in the Finnish Register for Associations.

==Apprehension on Odessa==
[[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] authorities apprehended Storsjö in [[Odessa]] on May 26, 2008, because he was on the list of ''[[personae non gratae]]'' in the [[Russian Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Suomalainen Venajä-aktivisti viruu putkassa Odessassa (‘Finnish Activist on Russian Matters Lies in Jail in Odessa’) | url= http://www.uusisuomi.fi/kotimaa/33592-suomalainen-venaja-aktivisti-viruu-putkassa-odessassa | publisher= [[Uusi Suomi]] | accessdate=2008-08-28 | language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storsjö was released from jail on May 28, 2007, and the Ukrainian authorities had cause to review their practises concerning lists of ''personae non gratae''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Suomalainen Venäjä-aktivisti saa Ukrainan tarkistamaan kieltolistansa (‘Finnish Activist on Russian Matters causes Ukraine to revise its list of denied entries’) | url= http://www.uusisuomi.fi/kotimaa/33671-suomalainen-venaja-aktivisti-saa-ukrainan-tarkistamaan-kieltolistansa | publisher= [[Uusi Suomi]] | accessdate=2008-08-29 | language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court Case Concerning Alleged Organisation of Chechens’ Illegal Entry into Finland==
In early June 2009, Storsjö declared that he had arranged the entry into Finland of around 50 Chechens who had been living in exile in [[Turkey]]. He said the [[Finnish Border Guard]] suspected him of arranging a gross illegal entry to Finland in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Tšetšenia-aktivisti: Olen pääepäilty maahantulojutussa (‘Chechnya Activist: I am the main suspect in a case of illegal entry’) | url= http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/Tšetšenia-aktivisti+Olen+pääepäilty+maahantulojutussa/1135246501172 | publisher= [[Helsingin Sanomat]] | accessdate=2009-06-06 | language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a court case that began on March 24, 2011, in the [[Vantaa Local Court]], the prosecutor Mikko Sipila accused Storsjö altogether of three cases of arranging an illegal entry, of which one he considered to be a gross one. He demanded that Storsjö be given a jail sentence. The alleged crimes had taken place from 2007 to 2010. According to the prosecution, Storsjö had brought 22 Chechens from Turkey to Finland on three separate occasions, and 9 of these people had been minors. None of these people had carried travel documents that would have entitled them to enter Finland. The prosecution also deemed that even though Storsjö had not benefited from this activity financially, he had reaped benefits in other ways, such as gaining a reputation and the respect of certain circles.”

Storsjö denied having benefited from gains in reputation. He had publicly disclosed his activities only after the Border Guard had released statements to the effect that they suspected him of committing crimes. In fact he had only had losses from his activism, since he had paid the air fares of the Chechens from [[Istanbul]] via [[Helsinki]] to [[St. Petersburg]] from his own and his company’s funds. Storsjö denied having broken Finnish law. According to him the criminal law allows the arrangement of entry to foreigners when there are acceptable grounds for such action. “I have decided to help these people, and I have done so fully conscious of the risks on my part.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/Syytt%C3%A4j%C3%A4+vaatii+t%C5%A1et%C5%A1eenej%C3%A4+Suomeen+auttaneelle+vankeutta/1135264058800 | title = Tšetšeenien auttajaa uhkaa vankeusrangaistus (‘Helper of Chechens Threatened by a Jail Sentence’) | accessdate = 2011-02-25 | location= Helsinki | date=25 February 2011 | work='' [[Helsingin Sanomat]], p. A7| first= Irina| last= Vähäsarja }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court case concluded on May 9, 2011. Storsjö was acquitted of all charges. The court held that his activity had not been of criminal kind, but that there had been acceptable grounds for it. The judge referred to the same section of the law that Storsjö had cited in court. The judge considered that Storsjö’s grounds for his activity were credible: this was a case of humanitarian activity based on empathy. The judge considered that the Chechens really were in need of protection, since nearly all of them had already been awarded asylum in Finland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5595">[[Outsourcing]] has been a growing area for business. It is primarily associated with 'support functions' such as [[Information technology|IT]], [[Human resources|HR]] or [[accounting]]. [[Marketing]] outsourcing, whilst common in the [[United States|US]], has not yet been embraced by British industry, but the [[economic downturn]] means that many businesses may well look to this form of cost reduction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/4883.html Should You Outsource Your Marketing?]. ''Harvard Business School. 2005-007-04.''&lt;/ref&gt; Increased interest in an Outsourced Marketing Department subscription is also being driven by the rapid and continuous expansion of tactics requiring specialized expertise. This includes specialties such as video production, online marketing, online search optimization, custom programming and integration of online marketing platforms with company functions such as sales, recruitment and finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ilyapozin/2014/04/23/leave-it-to-the-experts-should-you-outsource-your-marketing/#56f9bc8d2393|title=Leave It To The Experts: Should You Outsource Your Marketing?|website=www.forbes.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
Outsource marketing is the art of handing over the entire marketing demands of a company to a third party. This offers several distinct benefits:

Firstly companies can access higher quality talent that they might ordinarily be able to attract into an in-house department.

Secondly, outsourcing negates the need for an in-house team, thus reducing [[Overhead (business)|overhead]] – clients can literally operate with a bare bones marketing team, or even none at all. Some firms are marketing savings of 20% versus in-house hiring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rsmconnect.com|title=RSM Marketing {{!}} Outsourced Marketing Department|website=RSM Connect|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirdly, outsourcing reduces or eliminates the need for multiple, biased specialist agencies – all the marketing requirements are catered for by one centralised agency offering media-neutral and discipline-neutral marketing.

Lastly, this enables companies to move fast, with access to the exact resources they need to complete the ever-changing requirements to stay ahead in dynamic markets. Outsourcing gives immediate access, eliminating the delays of locating, vetting, negotiating and engaging with new resources/vendors.

== Options ==

=== Employee augmentation ===
Not all business owners choose to outsource due to a hectic overload of work at the office. Staff augmentation is utilised when a company decides to outsource tasks to a more skilled candidate while enjoying the flexibility of paying on an as-needed basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://think-moa.com.au/employee-augmentation-marketing-outsourcing/|title=Employee Augmentation – Marketing Outsourcing - THiNK - Marketing Operations Advisory|website=think-moa.com.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Project-based outsourcing ===
Project-based outsourcing is applicable to companies that only have irregular tasks needing completion or a project needed as a one-time event. Companies elect to outsource projects in this manner so they are able to continue their focus on their own business operations with little or no interruption.

=== Contracting/out-tasking ===
Contracting is a similar process to that of staff augmentation. The labour involved is arranged on an hourly, daily, weekly or monthly schedule allowance. The contracting approach involves the transfer process of a service to the selected outsourcing partner. The out-tasking arrangement is most suitable for business owners that wish to keep control over the entire process.

=== Managed outsourcing services ===
The managed services option enables the management of company operations by a third party participant on behalf of the company itself. The managed service provider takes control of all operations and projects and assumes ongoing responsibility within the company. Some providers offer this as a subscription service, setting a flat monthly fee and shifting priorities to keep the workload within the agreed upon range of resource hours.

=== Offshore outsource ===
In this outsourcing method, as the name suggests, companies seek contractors from offshore locations to complete projects for them. An example of this method is Australian companies offshoring their call centre operators to workers in the Philippines. This option allows for reduced expenditure while maintaining efficiency and control over the entire procedure.

Businesses and [[brand]]s can achieve all of these benefits with the added bonus of flexibility (up-weighting or downscaling the requirements at any point), which suits the uncertainty of the [[economic environment]].

Marketing outsourcing should not be confused with [[sales outsourcing]] or working with a contract sales organization.

The challenging economic backdrop has meant that major corporations have begun outsourcing significant parts of their marketing. For instance, the [[Guardian newspaper]] outsourced most of their marketing design in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/may/17/guardian-news-and-media | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jason | last=Deans | title=Guardian News &amp; Media to outsource marketing design services | date=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roberto Romero''' (October 22, 1927 - February 15, 1992) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Justicialist Party]] [[politician]] and [[businessman]]. 

Romero was a founder of the provincial ''[[El Tribuno]]'' newspaper. He was elected as Governor of [[Salta Province]], serving from 1983-1987, and completing numerous public works aimed at the province's growing tourist industry - notably the DELMI Stadium and the San Bernardo Hill [[Aerial tramway]]. He then stepped down to become a national deputy in the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]] for Salta Province. He stood for governor once again in 1991, but lost and retired that year from public life. 

In February 1992, whilst on holiday with his family in [[Brazil]], Romero was killed in an automobile accident. His son, [[Juan Carlos Romero (politician)|Juan Carlos Romero]], later also served as Governor of Salta.

In 2006 it came to light that the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] of the [[United States]] had considered Romero the likely head of a major drug cartel. [http://www.salta21.com/spip.php?article168]

'''Roy Herbert Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet''', [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire|GBE]] (June 5, 1894 – August 4, 1976) was a [[Canadian]] [[newspaper]] proprietor who became one of the moguls of [[Fleet Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Roy-Herbert-Thomson-1st-Baron-Thomson|title=Roy Herbert Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson {{!}} British publisher|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He first came to prominence when he was selling radios in Ontario, and to give his customers more programmes to listen to, decided to launch his own radio station. He then moved into newspapers, buying ''[[The Scotsman]]'' as a salute to his Scottish ancestors, followed by the first Scottish independent television channel. By 1966, he owned both ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]''.

==Early life==
On June 5, 1894, Thomson was born as Roy Herbert Thomson in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. Thomson's father was Herbert Thomson, a telegraphist turned barber who worked at Toronto's Grosvenor Hotel (at Yonge and Alexander - now site of Courtyard Marriott), and [[England|English]]-born Alice Maud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Roy-Herbert-Thomson-1st-Baron-Thomson-of-Fleet-GBE/6000000014718209357|title=Roy Herbert Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet, GBE|website=[[geni.com]]|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson's family lived at 32 Monteith Street, off Church Street in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. 
Thomson's paternal grand-parents were Hugh Thomson and Mary Nichol Sylvester. Thomson's grand-father Hugh was one of ten children of George Thomson, son of Archibald Thomson, who emigrated from Westerkirk, Scotland to Canada in 1773. Archibald was brother of [[David and Mary Thomson|David Thomson]], first European settler of [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Ontario]].

Thomson’s ancestors were small tenant farmers on the estates of the Dukes of Buccleuch at [[Bo'ness]], in the parish of [[Westerkirk]], [[Dumfriesshire]], [[Scotland]]. Thomson's ancestor, Archibald Thomson (born May 1749), migrated to [[British North America]] in 1773, marrying Elizabeth McKay, of [[Quebec City|Quebec]]. The family eventually settled in [[Upper Canada]], but retained a sentimental attachment to their country of origin.

==Career==
During [[World War I]], Roy Thomson attended a [[business college]], and owing to bad eyesight he was rejected by the army. He went to [[Manitoba]] after the war to become a [[farmer]], but was unsuccessful. Thomson travelled to Toronto again, where he held several jobs at different times; one of which was selling radios. However, he found selling radios difficult because the only district left for him to work in was [[Northern Ontario]]. In order to give his potential customers something to listen to he undertook to establish a radio station. By quite a stroke of luck, he was able to procure a radio frequency and transmitter for $201. [[CKFX-FM|CFCH]] officially went on the air in [[North Bay, Ontario]] on March 3, 1931. He sold radios for quite some time after that, but his focus gradually shifted to his radio station, rather than the actual radios.

In 1934, Thomson acquired his first newspaper. With a down payment of $200 he purchased the ''[[Timmins Daily Press]]'', in [[Timmins, Ontario]]. He began an expansion of both radio stations and newspapers in various Ontario locations in partnership with fellow Canadian, [[Jack Kent Cooke]]. In addition to his media acquisitions, by 1949 Thomson was the owner of a diverse group of companies, including several ladies' [[hairstyling]] businesses, a fitted kitchen manufacturer, and an [[ice-cream cone]] manufacturing operation. By the early 1950s, he owned 19 newspapers and was president of the Canadian Daily Newspaper Publishers Association, and then began his first foray into the British newspaper business by starting up the ''Canadian Weekly Review'' to cater to expatriate Canadians living in Britain.

In 1952, Thomson move to [[Edinburgh]] and purchased ''[[The Scotsman]]'' newspaper. In 1957, Thomson launched a successful bid for the [[ITV Network|commercial television]] franchise for Central Scotland, named [[Scottish Television]], which he was to describe as a "permit to print money" (often misquoted as a "licence to print money"). In 1959, Thomson purchased the Kemsley group of newspapers, the largest in Britain, which included ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]''. Over the years, Thomson expanded his media empire to include more than 200 newspapers in Canada, the [[United States]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. His [[Thomson Organization]] became a [[multinational corporation]], with interests in [[publishing]], [[printing]], [[television]], and [[travel]]. In 1966, Thomson bought ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper from members of the [[Astor family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jun/13/guardianobituaries.media|title=Lord Thomson of Fleet|last=Goodman|first=Geoffrey|date=2006-06-12|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-07-10|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, Thomson joined with [[J. Paul Getty]] in a [[consortium]] that successfully explored for [[Petroleum|oil]] in the [[North Sea]].

A modest man, who had little time for pretentious displays of wealth, in Britain he got by virtually unnoticed, riding the [[London Underground]] to his office each day. Nonetheless, he made his son Kenneth promise to use the hereditary title that he had received in 1964, if only in the [[London]] offices of the firm.

[[File:Toronto - ON - Roy Thomson Hall.jpg|thumb|right|[[Roy Thomson Hall]] in the downtown [[Toronto Entertainment District|Entertainment District]] is named after Roy Thomson]]

== Personal life ==
On 29 Jul 1916, Thomson married Edna Annis Irvine (1895-1951) in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. Edna A. Irvine was the daughter of John Irvine and Rebecca Caldwell. &lt;ref&gt;{{cit web |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Edna-Thomson/6000000014718308066 |title=Edna Alice Irvine |publisher=[[Geni.com]] |accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;ref name="Edna"&gt;{{cit web |url=http://www.glendinning.name/ancestry/thomsfam/pafg80.htm#2511 |title=Descendants of Adam THOMSON and Margaret CRANSTOUN |publisher=glendinning.name |accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thomson had three children: [[Kenneth Thomson, 2nd Baron Thomson of Fleet|Kenneth Roy Thomson]] (b. 1 Sep 1923), Irma Jacqueline Thomson (b. 20 Oct 1918) and Phyllis Audrey Thomson (b. 6 Jul 1917). &lt;ref name="Edna"/&gt;

On 22 Feb 1951 Thomson's wife Edna died in Ft Lauderdale, Florida. &lt;ref name="Edna"/&gt;
In 1952, Thomson move to [[Edinburgh]].
In 1976, Thomson died in London, England. A plaque was placed in the crypt of [[St Paul's Cathedral]].

After Thomson's death in 1976, his son [[Kenneth Thomson, 2nd Baron Thomson of Fleet|Kenneth Thomson]] became chair of [[Thomson Corporation]] and inherited the [[baron]]ial title becoming the 2nd [[Baron Thomson of Fleet]]. With the Thomson operations now principally again in Canada, the younger Thomson did not use his title in Canada though he did so in Britain, and used two sets of stationery reflecting this dichotomy. In any case, as the peerage title he had was inherited, it did not debar him from retaining his Canadian citizenship, and he never took up his right to a seat in the pre-1999 [[House of Lords]].

=== Legacy ===
[[Roy Thomson Hall]], one of [[Toronto]]'s main concert halls, is named in his honour as the Thomson family donated $5.4 million to its construction.

==Honours and styles of address==
===Honours===
In the [[1964 New Year Honours]], it was announced that Thomson would be elevated to the [[peerage]] as a [[Baron]] "for public services".&lt;ref name="LG 31 December 1963"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=43200 |date=31 December 1963 |page=1 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 March 1964, he was made '''[[Baron Thomson of Fleet]]''', of Northbridge in the City of Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="LG 10 March 1964"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=43267 |date=10 March 1964 |page=2189 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to receive this title, it was necessary for Thomson to acquire [[British citizenship]], as the Canadian government had made it common practice since 1919 to disallow the conference of titular honours from the sovereign on Canadians. However, the Canadian ''Citizenship Act'' between 1947 and 1977 stated that any Canadian who became a citizen of another country through means other than marriage would cease to be a Canadian citizen. Thus, Thomson lost his [[Canadian citizenship]] in the process.

He was appointed [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire]] (GBE) in the [[1970 New Year Honours]].&lt;ref name="LG 30 December 1969"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=44999|date=1 January 1970|page=8|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index''' (SBLI) is an [[economic indicator]] from [[Thomson Reuters Indices]] and PayNet Inc. Because small businesses generally respond to changes in economic conditions more rapidly than larger businesses do, the Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index serves as a [[leading indicator]] of the economy.

The index, utilizing [[small business]] loan origination data from major lenders, measures the volume of loans to Small Businesses normalized to a base year - 2005. Seasonally adjusted, the index is presented as an absolute as well as by a percent change versus the prior year.  
It is published monthly as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! width="200pt"|PRELIMINARY data
for current value reflecting most recent small business lending activity released 
! width="200pt"|REVISED data
for month preceding Preliminary released
! width="200pt"|FINAL data
for month preceding Revised released
|-
|}

The index has its highest correlation with GDP change as a leading indicator, leading between 2 and 5 months in advance. The index undergoes periodic checks to examine the accuracy of the estimates over time.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

== Methodology ==
All data is collected by PayNet, Inc. PayNet collects real-time loan information from more than 350 leading U.S. lenders. Its proprietary database encompasses over 19 million current and historic contracts worth over $1.5 trillion. 

PayNet primarily collects data from small business lenders in the United States, conducts research and analysis, develops and implements estimation methodologies and disseminates statistics to customers. Because PayNet receives its source data over time, estimates are routinely revised to reflect more complete source data. Preliminary and Revised estimates are reported as calculated without any reference to previously reported estimates for the same month. In addition, PayNet undertakes periodic studies that examine the accuracy of the estimates over time and for the existence of any systemic overstatement or understatement.

'''''Steve Jobs''''' is a 2015 [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[drama (film and television)|drama]] film directed by [[Danny Boyle]] and written by [[Aaron Sorkin]]. Adapted from the [[Steve Jobs (book)|2011 book of the same name]] by [[Walter Isaacson]] as well as interviews conducted by Sorkin, the film is structured into three acts which cover 14 years (1984–1998) in the life of [[microcomputer revolution|personal computing]] [[innovator]] and [[Apple Inc.]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]], with each act taking place immediately prior to the launch of a key product – the [[Macintosh 128K|Apple Macintosh]], the [[NeXT Computer]] and the [[iMac G3|iMac]]. Jobs is portrayed by [[Michael Fassbender]], with [[Kate Winslet]], [[Seth Rogen]], [[Katherine Waterston]], [[Michael Stuhlbarg]], and [[Jeff Daniels]] in supporting roles.

Development on the project began in 2011 after the rights to Isaacson's book were acquired. Sorkin wrote the screenplay and filming began in January 2015. A variety of actors were considered and cast before Fassbender eventually took the role. Editing was extensive on the project, with editor [[Elliot Graham]] noting that he was working on existing footage while the film was still shooting. [[Daniel Pemberton]] served as the film's composer, with a focus dedicated to dividing the score into three distinguishable sections.

''Steve Jobs'' premiered at the [[Telluride Film Festival|2015 Telluride Film Festival]] on September 5, 2015, and began a [[limited release]] in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] on October 9, 2015. It opened nationwide in the U.S. on October 23, 2015, to critical acclaim. Individuals close to Jobs such as [[Steve Wozniak]] and [[John Sculley]] would praise the film's performances, but the film also received criticisms for its inaccuracy in some of its scenes. Winslet won a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] and a [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] for Best Supporting Actress and Sorkin won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay]] at the [[73rd Golden Globes]], while Fassbender and Winslet received nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], respectively, at the [[88th Academy Awards]].

== Plot ==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films are set between 400-700 words. --&gt;In 1984, the [[Macintosh 128K|Apple Macintosh 128K]]'s voice demo fails less than an hour before its unveiling at [[De Anza College|Flint Center]]. [[Apple, Inc.|Apple]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]] demands engineer [[Andy Hertzfeld]] fix it, threatening to publicly implicate him in the presentation's credits if he does not. Hertzfeld finally suggests faking the demo using the prototype [[Macintosh 512K]] computer.

Jobs rants to marketing executive [[Joanna Hoffman]] about a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article exposing his paternity dispute with ex-girlfriend [[Chrisann Brennan]] – he denies he is the father of Brennan's five-year-old daughter, [[Lisa Brennan-Jobs|Lisa]]. Brennan arrives with Lisa to confront him – she is bitter over his denials and his refusal to support her despite his wealth. Jobs bonds with Lisa over her [[MacPaint]] art and agrees to provide more money and a house. Apple co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]] asks Jobs to acknowledge the [[Apple II]] team in his presentation, but Jobs feels that mentioning the computer (which he considers obsolete) is unwise.

By 1988, following the apparent failure of the Macintosh, Jobs has founded a new company, [[NeXT]]. Before the [[NeXT Computer]] launch at the [[War Memorial Opera House]], he spends time with 9-year-old Lisa, but his relationship with Brennan is still strained – he accuses her of irresponsible behavior and of using Lisa to get money from him. Wozniak arrives and predicts the NeXT will be another failure. Jobs confronts him about his public criticism of him, and Wozniak questions Jobs' contributions to computing history. Jobs defends his role as that of a conductor, who directs "musicians" like Wozniak.

Apple CEO [[John Sculley]] demands to know why the world believes he fired Jobs – Jobs was actually forced out by the Apple board, who were resolute on updating the Apple II following the Macintosh's lackluster sales. Jobs lambasted the decision and dared them to cast a final vote on his tenure, despite Sculley's warnings. After Hoffman and Jobs discuss NeXT's unclear direction, she realizes that Jobs has designed the computer to entice Apple to buy the company and reinstate him.

By 1998, Apple has fired Sculley, purchased NeXT, and named Jobs CEO, and Jobs is about to unveil the [[iMac G3|iMac]] at [[Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall|Davies Symphony Hall]]. He is delighted by Hoffman's strong commercial forecasts, but furious that Lisa has allowed her mother to sell the house Jobs bought for them. Hoffman reminds Jobs that he threatened to withhold Lisa's college tuition – Hertzfeld admits that he paid Lisa's tuition and suggested she attend therapy. Wozniak again asks that Jobs credit the Apple II team during the presentation, and again he refuses.

Sculley arrives in secret and the two make amends. Jobs and Sculley discuss Jobs' life as an adopted child, and Jobs admits that his need for control stems from his feelings of powerlessness in being given up. At the behest of Hoffman, Jobs apologizes to Lisa for his mistakes and accepts that he is her father, admitting that he is "poorly made". Lisa watches her father take the stage to introduce the iMac.

== Cast ==
* [[Michael Fassbender]] as [[Steve Jobs]]:

In regards to how he aimed to depict Jobs, Fassbender stated he aimed to depict Jobs as a "somebody who was passionate about his vision" as opposed to a cruel person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/10/12/michael-fassbender-steve-jobs-interview/73601092/ |first=Bryan |last=Alexander |title=Michael Fassbender portrays 'poorly made' Steve Jobs |date=October 12, 2015 |work=USA TODAY |accessdate=August 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111020933/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/10/12/michael-fassbender-steve-jobs-interview/73601092/ |archive-date=January 11, 2016 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kate Winslet]] as [[Joanna Hoffman]]:
:Apple and [[NeXT]] marketing executive and Jobs' confidant in the film.&lt;ref name="cast" /&gt; When discussing her audition for the film, Winslet later commented that she "heard about it through a crew member who I happened to be working with [in Australia on ''[[The Dressmaker (2015 film)|The Dressmaker]]''], I didn't even care what role it was. I just wanted to be in it. Found out the nature of the role. Googled [Hoffman]. Found one picture of her. Got my husband to go to a wig shop. Buy a short-haired dark wig. Stuck it on my head. Sent a photograph of myself to [producer] Scott Rudin. Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me the part."&lt;ref name="Labrecque" /&gt; Winslet spent considerable time with [[Joanna Hoffman]] to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman "has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues."&lt;ref name="hoffman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/08/kate-winslet-on-her-role-in-steve-jobs.html |title=How Kate Winslet Won a Role in Steve Jobs and Managed All That Sorkin Dialogue |accessdate=August 26, 2016 |last=Kachka |first=Boris |date=August 26, 2015 |work=Vulture |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618180609/http://www.vulture.com/2015/08/kate-winslet-on-her-role-in-steve-jobs.html |archive-date=June 18, 2016 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs.&lt;ref name="dbprem" /&gt; {{paragraph break}} On the nature of the relationship between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender "were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass." In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she "just wanted to please [Hoffman] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake."&lt;ref name=hoffman/&gt; Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman "did genuinely love [Jobs]. And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly."&lt;ref name="dbprem"/&gt;
* [[Seth Rogen]] as [[Steve Wozniak]]:
:Co-founder of Apple and creator of the [[Apple II]].&lt;ref name="cast"/&gt; Rogen admitted to not being familiar with Wozniak, let alone knowing he was co-founder of Apple. He met with Wozniak to prepare for the film, specifically picking up his tendency to move his hands around while speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.gq.com/story/steve-jobs-seth-rogen-qa |first=Lauren |last=Larson |title=Seth Rogen on Steve Jobs and Why He Has Mixed Feelings About Biopics |date=October 16, 2015 |work=GQ |accessdate=March 29, 2017 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fsteve-jobs-seth-rogen-qa&amp;date=2017-03-29 |archive-date=March 29, 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCwozint"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-31463351 |title=Woz on watches, addiction and being played by Seth Rogen |accessdate=February 15, 2015 |last=Lobel |first=Mark |date=February 15, 2015 |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Ftechnology-31463351&amp;date=2016-09-04 |archive-date=2016-09-04 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to Wozniak's relationship with Jobs, Rogen stated that "his feelings towards Jobs were very complex and interesting. Part of it was taking it at face value and part was reading between the lines."&lt;ref name="dbprem" /&gt; Wozniak stated that he felt honored to be portrayed by Rogen in the film.&lt;ref name="anyway" /&gt;

To distinguish each of the three product launches depicted in the movie, Danny Boyle and cinematographer [[Alwin H. Küchler|Alwin Küchler]] implemented three different film formats: [[16mm film|16mm]] for 1984, [[35 mm film|35mm]] for 1988, and [[Digital cinematography|digital]] for 1998. They also wanted each of the film's three time periods to visually reflect Jobs' own development at the time. For instance, Küchler explains that the filming at [[De Anza College|Flint Center, De Anza college]] for the first act combined the graininess of 16&amp;nbsp;mm film and setting to accentuate a provisional, spontaneous look – much in the vein of how Jobs is portrayed at that time. The third act, shot with an [[Arri Alexa]] at the [[Davies Symphony Hall]], incorporated an aesthetic and color palette that were intended to be representative of Jobs' own design philosophies of the [[iMac]] and subsequent [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] hardware. Küchler describes his experience filming ''Steve Jobs'' as "brilliant and challenging at the same time", and that the goal was to "make sure that the visuals kept up with the words", in reference to the production's collaboration between Boyle and Sorkin.&lt;ref name="boylewired"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/10/steve-jobs-danny-boyle-interview/ |title=Why Danny Boyle Filmed Steve Jobs in Three Different Formats |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=October 16, 2015 |accessdate=November 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2F2015%2F10%2Fsteve-jobs-danny-boyle-interview%2F&amp;date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=September 3, 2016 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kuchlerthalo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thalo.com/articles/view/1143/steve_jobs_dp_alwin_h_kchler_shoots_in_three_acts |title=Steve Jobs DP Alwin H.

Costume designer [[Suttirat Anne Larlarb]] says the real Jobs never wore his trademark turtleneck jumper at any of the launches: "The turtleneck was the off book decision. In those 3 actual launches, in real life, he never wore that. In the 1998 portion of the film, in real life he was wearing a dark greyish/brownish suit. We made it for him as a back up idea in case we needed to adhere to it. As we got closer to the time of filming, I thought we'd set up rules for 1984, we'd set up rules for 1988 – there's so much of the film that's about design and he was about design."&lt;ref name="filmdoctor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmdoctor.co.uk/2015/12/01/steve-jobs-costume-designer-suttirat-larlarb-in-conversation|title=''Steve Jobs'' costume designer in conversation|website=filmdoctor.co.uk|date=December 1, 2015|accessdate=December 1, 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffilmdoctor.co.uk%2F2015%2F12%2F01%2Fsteve-jobs-costume-designer-suttirat-larlarb-in-conversation&amp;date=2016-09-03|archive-date=September 3, 2016|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fassbender also remarked that the historically inaccurate black turtleneck for the third act was intentional, believing that wearing the attire "felt like I had arrived at [Steve Jobs'] vision, that the person had arrived." Fassbender later added that he and [[Danny Boyle]] decided on this look during filming, and wanted to "give the audience kind of a payoff."&lt;ref name="fassbenderhuman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/01/05/how-michael-fassbender-made-steve-jobs-human.html |title=How Michael Fassbender Made Steve Jobs Human |first=Kevin |last=Fallon |work=[[Daily Beast]] |date=January 5, 2016 |accessdate=January 5, 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedailybeast.com%2Farticles%2F2016%2F01%2F05%2Fhow-michael-fassbender-made-steve-jobs-human.html&amp;date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=September 3, 2016 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fassbenderpayoff"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/film/awards/michael-fassbender-portraying-steve-jobs-1201701595/ |title=Michael Fassbender on Finding the Essence of ''Steve Jobs''|first=Jenelle |last=Riley |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=February 11, 2016 |accessdate=February 17, 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2016%2Ffilm%2Fawards%2Fmichael-fassbender-portraying-steve-jobs-1201701595%2F&amp;date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=September 3, 2016 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-production ===

During the one-week rehearsal that took place in between production for each of the three acts (shot in chronological order), Graham would work on the existing footage and receive ongoing feedback from Boyle in the editing room. In an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Graham said a particular challenge for him was balancing the [[Shot (filmmaking)#Film editing|shot frequency]] and providing enough "visual interventions" to control for Sorkin's dialogue-heavy screenplay. He described approaching each scene as "a series of fight sequences". Michael Fassbender provided multiple versions of his performance as Jobs, which Graham and Boyle would then choose from during [[post-production]].&lt;ref name="boylecrave"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.craveonline.com/culture/912765-interview-danny-boyle-politics-steve-jobs |title=Interview Danny Boyle on the Politics of ''Steve Jobs''|last=Bibbiani |first=William |work=[[CraveOnline]] |date=October 16, 2015 |accessdate=November 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.craveonline.com%2Fculture%2F912765-interview-danny-boyle-politics-steve-jobs&amp;date=2016-09-02 |archive-date=2016-09-02 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grahamguild"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.editorsguild.com/FromTheGuild.cfm?FromTheGuildid=535 |title=From the Guild: Getting to the Core of Apple |last=Feld |first=Rob |publisher=[[Motion Picture Editors Guild]] |date=November 4, 2015 |accessdate=November 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.editorsguild.com%2FFromTheGuild.cfm%3FFromTheGuildid%3D535&amp;date=2016-09-02 |archive-date=2016-09-02 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/video/steve-jobs-editing-aaron-sorkin/ |title=Steve Jobs Editor on the Rush of Working With Aaron Sorkin Dialogue |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=November 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2Fvideo%2Fsteve-jobs-editing-aaron-sorkin%2F&amp;date=2016-09-02 |archive-date=2016-09-02 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham also said: "Danny would be involved a lot but also take time away.

[[Daniel Pemberton]] composed the music for the film. Much like the film's visual approach, the score is divided into three distinguishable sections, each corresponding to the intended feel of the act in which the section is heard. "You have the first act which is analog," Pemberton explains, "you have the second act which is orchestral, and you have the third act which is digital." For the first act's composition, Pemberton primarily used analog synthesizers, in particular ones released no later than 1984 – the time the first act takes place – such as the [[Roland SH-1000]] and [[Yamaha CS-80]]. The second act's score is more operatic in nature, matching the setting of the [[War Memorial Opera House|San Francisco Opera House]]. Finally, the third act featured a more introspective score produced entirely digitally to complement its backdrop of the 1998 iMac product launch, and Pemberton correspondingly used his own iMac to compose this section.&lt;ref name="pembertonpop"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/a-symphony-in-three-parts-breaking-down-the-steve-jobs-score-with-composer-/ |title=Breaking Down the 'Steve Jobs' Score with Composer Daniel Pemberton |first=Cory |last=Woodroof |work=[[PopMatters]] |date=November 13, 2015 |accessdate=November 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.popmatters.com%2Ffeature%2Fa-symphony-in-three-parts-breaking-down-the-steve-jobs-score-with-composer-%2F+&amp;date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=2016-09-03 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pembertonvariety"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/movie-maestros-mix-organic-and-synthetic-sounds-1201632653/ |title=Movie Maestros Mix Organic and Synthetic Sounds |first=Joe |last=Burlingame |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=November 3, 2015 |accessdate=November 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2015%2Ffilm%2Fnews%2Fmovie-maestros-mix-organic-and-synthetic-sounds-1201632653%2F&amp;date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=2016-09-03 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pembertonclash"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clashmusic.com/features/daniel-pemberton-scoring-steve-jobs |title=Daniel Pemberton: Scoring Steve Jobs |first=Paul |last=Weedon |work=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]] |date=November 18, 2015 |accessdate=November 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clashmusic.com%2Ffeatures%2Fdaniel-pemberton-scoring-steve-jobs&amp;date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=2016-09-03 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deadlinepemberton"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2015/12/steve-jobs-composer-daniel-pemberton-oscars-2015-best-score-1201617583/ |title='Steve Jobs' Composer Daniel Pemberton Blended Nostalgia And Futurism |first=Anthony |last=D'Alessandro |work=[[Deadline (magazine)|Deadline]] |date=December 5, 2015 |accessdate=December 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdeadline.com%2F2015%2F12%2Fsteve-jobs-composer-daniel-pemberton-oscars-2015-best-score-1201617583%2F&amp;date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=2016-09-03 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The soundtrack also features songs by [[The Libertines]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[The Maccabees (band)|The Maccabees]]. The Maccabees' "Grew Up At Midnight", the song that played during the film's concluding scene, was reportedly chosen by [[Danny Boyle]] himself, who is a fan of the band. Other songs were considered for the final scene, even Pemberton's own score before the song was chosen.&lt;ref name="pembertonpop" /&gt; The soundtrack was released digitally on October 9, 2015 and in physical format on October 23, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2015/09/30/steve-jobs-soundtrack-details/ |title=''Steve Jobs'' Soundtrack Details |work=Film Music Reporter |date=October 5, 2015 |accessdate=October 5, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffilmmusicreporter.com%2F2015%2F09%2F30%2Fsteve-jobs-soundtrack-details%2F&amp;date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=2016-09-03 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said Boyle's "electric" direction "temperamentally complements Sorkin's highly theatrical three-act study" and praised Fassbender in the role, who "doesn't closely physically resemble the man, [yet] he fully delivers the essentials of how we have come to perceive the man."&lt;ref name=hrrev&gt;{{cite web |last=McCarthy |first=Todd |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/steve-jobs/review/820561 |title='Steve Jobs': Telluride Review |accessdate=September 6, 2015 |date=September 6, 2015 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fmovie%2Fsteve-jobs%2Freview%2F820561&amp;date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=2016-09-03 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' extolled the film as "a wildly creative fantasia...a brilliant, maddening, ingeniously designed and monstrously self-aggrandizing movie."&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite news |title=Telluride Film Review: ''Steve Jobs''|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/festivals/steve-jobs-review-michael-fassbender-telluride-film-festival-1201586996/ |last=Chang |first=Justin |date=September 6, 2015 |accessdate=September 6, 2015 |work=Variety |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2015%2Ffilm%2Ffestivals%2Fsteve-jobs-review-michael-fassbender-telluride-film-festival-1201586996%2F&amp;date=2016-09-04 |archive-date=2016-09-04 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sasha Stone]], writing for ''[[TheWrap]]'', stated that Fassbender gives "a stunning knockout" performance as Jobs in a film that is "a kind of talk opera", which to some might seem to be "Sorkin overkill but the same could be said for the best of them: [[David Mamet]], [[Edward Albee]], [[Paddy Chayefsky]] and even [[William Shakespeare]].

He also noted that Boyle "drops his usual whirlwind editing style and instead develops an engrossing chamber piece."&lt;ref name=iw&gt;{{cite web|last=Kohn|first=Eric|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/telluride-review-danny-boyles-steve-jobs-is-like-its-subject-flawed-but-fascinating-20150906|title=Telluride Review: Danny Boyle's ''Steve Jobs'' is Like Its Subject — Flawed But Fascinating|accessdate=September 6, 2015|date=September 6, 2015|work=[[IndieWire]]|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiewire.com%2Farticle%2Ftelluride-review-danny-boyles-steve-jobs-is-like-its-subject-flawed-but-fascinating-20150906&amp;date=2016-09-04|archive-date=2016-09-04|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benjamin Lee of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the film three out of five stars, writing that "despite the film constantly informing you of just how incredibly important everything all is, it's disappointingly difficult to truly care about what's taking place." He blames Sorkin's "dominating" script, arguing that "the dialogue stifles" and that "the actors are tasked with trying to wrangle enough breathing space to offer up something of their own." He also feels that while it is "Boyle's best film for years," his direction "plays second fiddle" to a script that verges on a kind of "Apple-sponsored hero iWorship."&lt;ref name=guarrev&gt;{{cite web |last=Lee |first=Benjamin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/06/steve-jobs-movie-review-michael-fassbender-telluride |title=Steve Jobs review: Fassbender excels but iWorship required if you're to care |accessdate=September 12, 2015 |date=September 6, 2015 |work=The Guardian |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffilm%2F2015%2Fsep%2F06%2Fsteve-jobs-movie-review-michael-fassbender-telluride&amp;date=2016-09-04 |archive-date=2016-09-04 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Nocera]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', who knew Jobs well, took issue with "how little the film has to do with the flesh and blood Steve Jobs." Characterizing the movie as pure "fiction", he went on to say, "In ways both large and small, Sorkin − as well as Michael Fassbender, the actor who plays Jobs − has failed to capture him in any meaningful sense."&lt;ref name=Nocera&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nocera|first1=Joe|authorlink=Joe Nocera|title=Aaron Sorkin's ''Steve Jobs'' Con|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/opinion/aaron-sorkins-steve-jobs-con.html|accessdate=October 14, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=October 13, 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2015%2F10%2F13%2Fopinion%2Faaron-sorkins-steve-jobs-con.html&amp;date=2016-09-04|archive-date=2016-09-04|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical accuracy ===
[[Danny Boyle]], the film's director, speaking on the creative liberties he took with portraying Steve Jobs said, "[it] was what [[Shakespeare]] used to do. He would take some of the facts about a man of power and he would guess at a lot of the rest and just gotten away at actually getting at the human in it. And that's what's wonderful about the writing I think, is that it acknowledges the people who disliked Steve Jobs, the people he hurt.

That wasn't his character, and the events didn't happen. You think of Jobs having a [[reality distortion field]]. I think of Aaron Sorkin as having ... a history distortion field".

[[Steve Wozniak]] (who consulted with Sorkin before he had written the screenplay) commented on a trailer released on July 1, 2015 that he does not "talk that way... I would never accuse the graphical interface of being stolen. I never made comments to the effect that I had credit (genius) taken from me...

Wozniak specifically mentioned that he never requested Jobs to acknowledge the [[Apple II]] team onstage, as was shown in the movie. However, he added that Jobs did purportedly show a lack of respect towards the group. When asked about the accuracy of the film's portrayal of Jobs, Wozniak replied: "In real life, to real people, that's the way he could be, very sharp, (although) never quite as much as in the movie."&lt;ref name="wozniaksfchron"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Woz-talks-Steve-Jobs-geek-culture-and-6824747.php |title='Woz' talks Steve Jobs, geek culture and Silicon Valley Comic Con |first=Benny |last=Evangelista |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=February 10, 2016 |accessdate=February 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sfchronicle.com%2Fbusiness%2Farticle%2FWoz-talks-Steve-Jobs-geek-culture-and-6824747.php&amp;date=2016-09-04 |archive-date=2016-09-04 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edwin Catmull]], president of [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]] and [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]], felt that Jobs would "be appalled" at his depiction in the film, arguing that he was a kinder person later in life than is portrayed in the picture. In an interview with ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', Catmull commented, "When [Jobs] left Apple, he then entered into what really is the classic [[hero's journey]]: He's wandering in the wilderness, he's working with NeXT, it's not working. He's working with Pixar, we're failing. In that process, Steve learned some major lessons, and he changed. He became an empathetic person, [...] that aspect of the change of Steve was missed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-pixars-ed-catmull-good-840292 |title=Disney-Pixar's Ed Catmull on 'Good Dinosaur,' Female Directors and Why Steve Jobs Would Be "Appalled" by 'Steve Jobs' |date=November 20, 2015 |last=Belloni |first=Matthew |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=November 21, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fnews%2Fdisney-pixars-ed-catmull-good-840292&amp;date=2016-09-04 |archive-date=2016-09-04 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''[[Bloomberg West]]'' interview with [[Emily Chang (journalist)|Emily Chang]] on August 26, 2015, [[Andrea Cunningham|Andy Cunningham]] called it "a wonderful film.... It's an incredible character study of a really complex man. Aaron [Sorkin] and Danny Boyle did a fabulous job with it." Her portrayal by [[Sarah Snook]] was a "small role but professionally done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chang |first1=Emily |title=Andy Cunningham: What It Was Like Working With Steve Jobs |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-08-27/andy-cunningham-what-it-was-like-working-with-steve-jobs |website=Bloomberg |accessdate=August 27, 2015 |date=August 26, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Fvideos%2F2015-08-27%2Fandy-cunningham-what-it-was-like-working-with-steve-jobs&amp;date=2016-09-04 |archive-date=2016-09-04 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also portrays Andy as participating in the iMac launch, even though she was not working with Apple at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Graham |first1=Jefferson |title=She was Steve Jobs' first publicist |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/09/06/she-steve-jobs-first-publicist/71787020/ |accessdate=September 12, 2015 |work=USA Today |date=September 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Ftech%2F2015%2F09%2F06%2Fshe-steve-jobs-first-publicist%2F71787020%2F&amp;date=2016-09-04 |archive-date=2016-09-04 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Walt Mossberg]] compared ''Steve Jobs'' to the [[Orson Welles]] film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', which was loosely based on the life of [[William Randolph Hearst]]. Mossberg has stated that while both films are aesthetically well-developed, Welles created a fictional set of characters in order to clarify that his film was a work of fiction. In contrast, according to Mossberg (who knew Jobs for 14 years), Sorkin's decision to use real instead of fictional names detracts from the quality of a film which appears to be a biopic and yet is a work of fiction. Mossberg states that "the Steve Jobs portrayed in Sorkin's film isn't the man I knew. Sorkin chose to cherry-pick and exaggerate some of the worst aspects of Jobs' character, and to focus on a period of his career when he was young and immature [...] It would be as if you made a movie called ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' almost entirely focused on Kennedy's womanizing and political rivalries, and said nothing about civil rights and the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. Sorkin opts to end his story just as Jobs is poised to both reel off an unprecedented string of world-changing products and to mature into a much broader, kinder manager and person."&lt;ref name=mossberg&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/21/9578921/steve-jobs-movie-review-walt-mossberg |title=Mossberg: The Steve Jobs I knew isn't in this movie |accessdate=October 22, 2015 |last=Mossberg |first=Walt |date=October 21, 2015 |work=[[The Verge]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2015%2F10%2F21%2F9578921%2Fsteve-jobs-movie-review-walt-mossberg&amp;date=2016-09-04 |archive-date=2016-09-04 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(PDF) . Retrieved on October 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Serving the Greater Boston area, it is made up of some 1,000 separate charitable funds established by thousands of donors over more than 100 years.&lt;ref name="2008 report" /&gt; Funds are established either for the general benefit of the community or for special purposes, such as supporting individual nonprofit organizations in perpetuity.  With some $1 billion in assets, today the Foundation is one of the largest funders in New England.  The Foundation and its donors make more than $100&amp;nbsp;million in grants every year.&lt;ref name="2008 report" /&gt; Since 2001, the Boston Foundation has also served as a major civic leader by commissioning and publishing research, providing a platform for discussion related to a wide range of challenges facing Greater Boston and the region and contributing to the development of public policy. 

== History ==
The Boston Foundation was founded in 1915 by Charles E. and Charles M. Rogerson, who were father and son.&lt;ref name="beginning"&gt;http://www.tbf.org/uploadedFiles/tbforg/There_at_the_Beginning/There%20from%20the%20Beginning.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Originally called the Permanent Charity Fund, it was one of the first community foundations in the United States, but, thanks to a bequest of $4 million shortly after it was launched, it was the first with the resources to begin grant making.&lt;ref name="beginning" /&gt; In 1959 another large bequest of $20 million catapulted the Foundation into an era during which it made early investments in some of the most important nonprofit institutions in Boston, from WGBH to the New England Aquarium to the clean up of Boston Harbor.  1985, the foundation was renamed the Boston Foundation, and Anna Faith Jones became the President—the first African-American woman to lead a major foundation in the United States.  Today, it is led by President and CEO, Paul S. Grogan, who is credited with transforming the Foundation into a major civic leader for the city and region.&lt;ref name="TBF-84"&gt;[http://www.tbf.org/AboutTBF/AboutTBFDetail.aspx?id=84 Meet Our President]. Tbf.org. Retrieved on October 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
As Greater Boston’s community foundation since 1915, the Boston Foundation devotes its resources to building and sustaining a vital, prosperous city and region, where justice and opportunity are extended to everyone.  It fulfills this mission in three principal ways: 

* Making grants to nonprofit organizations and designing special funding initiatives to address this community’s critical challenges;
* Working in partnership with donors to achieve [[High impact philanthropy|high-impact philanthropy]]; and
* Serving as a civic hub and center of information, where ideas are shared, levers for change are identified, and common agendas for the future are developed.

== Governance ==
The Foundation is overseen by a 20-member Board of Directors, selected to represent diverse community interests.&lt;ref name="TBF-82"&gt;[http://www.tbf.org/AboutTBF/AboutTBFDetail.aspx?id=82 Meet Our Board].

== Grant Making ==
Over more than 100 years of grantmaking, the Foundation has been there at the beginning for numerous fresh ideas and new institutions by providing crucial seed capital and other support.&lt;ref name="beginning" /&gt; Among its greatest accomplishments are grants that helped to launch [[WGBH-TV]], now considered the nation’s premier public television station.&lt;ref name="beginning" /&gt; It also made an early investment in the redevelopment of Faneuil Hall into a thriving marketplace, often credited with sparking the renewal of Boston in recent decades; and helped to shape Boston’s Longwood Medical Center area.&lt;ref name="beginning" /&gt; The Foundation invested in the most extensive network of community health centers in the nation and made grants to a group called Save the Harbor/Save the Bay to clean up Boston Harbor.&lt;ref name="beginning" /&gt; What was once one of the filthiest harbors in the world is now one of the cleanest.&lt;ref name="beginning" /&gt; It also made early grants to numerous organizations that started in Boston and spread throughout the country, like City Year, Citizen Schools and Year Up.&lt;ref name="beginning" /&gt;

Through its Understanding Boston series, the Boston Foundation commissions research from universities, think tanks and other organizations and shares this information through a series of forums that are attended by thousands of people every year.&lt;ref name="UB"&gt;[http://www.tbf.org/UnderstandingBoston/Default.aspx The Boston Foundation]. Tbf.org. Retrieved on October 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Issues addressed through Understanding Boston embrace a broad range of issues, including public education, housing, the workforce, health, philanthropy and the nonprofit sector, the arts and the urban environment.&lt;ref name="UB" /&gt;

In addition to providing fresh information and bringing people together to discuss findings, the Foundation also creates Task Forces and Action Agendas to produce positive change.  A number of issues have been influenced by this process.  The Commonwealth Housing Task Force created a Smart Growth housing effort to address the current shortage of housing in the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbf.org/chtf The Commonwealth Housing Task Force]. Tbf.org. Retrieved on October 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The program has led to dozens of towns and cities building thousands of new units of housing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbf.org/tbfgen1.asp?id=1991 The Boston Foundation]. Tbf.org. Retrieved on October 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation’s civic leadership also helped lead to the Massachusetts Cultural Facilities Fund, which has provided millions in state funding for cultural facilities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tbf.org/uploadedFiles/tbforg/There_at_the_Beginning/ThereForTheArts.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Its work examining the current Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) system has led to a complete re-evaluation of the system by state law makers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbf.org/UnderstandingBoston/CommunitySafety.aspx?id=6128 The Boston Foundation]. Tbf.org.

Tbf.org. Retrieved on October 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Other issues that have benefited from the Foundation’s civic leadership includea new collaborative for the life sciences, issues related to health and health care and the revenue-raising capacity of Massachusetts cities.&lt;ref name="2008 report" /&gt;

== Boston Indicators Project ==
[http://www.bostonindicators.org/?q&amp;sortBy=date&amp;sortOrder=desc&amp;page=1 Boston Indicators] is a research center at the Boston Foundation that seeks a thriving Greater Boston for all residents across all neighborhoods. They do this by analyzing key indicators of well-being and by researching promising ideas for making Boston more prosperous, equitable and just.

'''The Burke Group'''&lt;ref&gt;This should not be confused with the Canadian [[temporary worker]] and human resources recruitment agency by the same name, est. 1979. For the Canadian firm, see The Burke Group's [http://www.theburkegroup.com/ website].&lt;/ref&gt; is a U.S.-based international [[management consulting]] firm established in 1982 with headquarters in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="TBGweb"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Burke Group|url=http://www.theburkegroup.us.com/|accessdate=4 Jan 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Burke Group describes itself as an "international leader" in guiding management during union recognition campaigns.&lt;ref name=TBGweb /&gt; It provides commercial services to private and public employers. Services are also offered toward business development and leadership training. Critics of The Burke Group call the firm's practices professional [[union busting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5547ad92-d8d5-11dc-8b22-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1|title=TUC acts to thwart US ‘union busters’|last=Taylor|first=Andrew|date=2008-02-12|work=Financial Times|accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] and President is David J. Burke.

==Business==
The Burke Group Labor assists employers in responding to automatic recognition and ballot campaigns.  According to its U.S. website, employees considering a [[trade union]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Employees want and deserve to hear both pro employer and pro union arguments in order to make an informed choice before voting in a union election. A [[union organizer]] is experienced at running a union membership campaign whereas employers have little if any experience on how to respond to them when this activity presents itself. Once union activity becomes apparent, employers generally seek TBG and/or legal counsel in order to be better able to respond accurately and lawfully to employees."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tbglabor.com/faq.aspx |title=TBG Labor's FAQ on union avoidance |access-date=2009-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804081408/http://www.tbglabor.com/faq.aspx#faq3/ |archive-date=2009-08-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although their business has reportedly been international in scope since its inception, their services increased in the EU "after the [[Employee Relations Act 1999]] (ERA 1999)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/2000/07/feature/uk0007183f.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1999/26/contents&lt;/ref&gt; was established in June 2000 and triggered new procedures related to trade union recognition and ballot elections".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theburkegroup.eu.com/services.aspx?cid=11#19/TBG-EU Website-Trade Union Recognition Campaigns retrieved 4/27/2013]&lt;/ref&gt;  UK employers may seek the services of labor relations consultants such as The Burke Group and/or legal counsel to assist them thru the new law's complexities regarding automatic recognition or subsequent ballot elections.  "Human Rights Watch does not take the position that employer silence is required under international standards. Rather, non-interference is required by international standards."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org[Human Rights Watch:  Letter to member of the Board of Management, Human Rights Watch, July 29, 2010 (copy on file with Human Rights Watch)]&lt;/ref&gt; As stated by Dr. John Logan:  "Britain has a “hybrid” system of union recognition: employers can recognize the union without a demonstration of majority support, or, if the employers refuse voluntary recognition, the Central Arbitration Committee can recognize the union on the basis of documentary evidence of union membership or by holding a ballot election."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lera.uiuc.edu/pubs/perspectives/onlinecompanion/Spring2009Vol10/Logan.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805113538/http://www.lera.uiuc.edu/pubs/perspectives/onlinecompanion/Spring2009Vol10/Logan.html |archivedate=2012-08-05 |df= }} Union Recognition and Collective Bargaining: How Does the United States Compare With Other Democracies?

When direct communications known as third party persuading are requested, The Burke Group recommends&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tbglabor.com/services.aspx?cid=8&lt;/ref&gt; its U.S. clients work with ''Labor Information Services,'',&lt;ref name="LIS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Labor Information Services|url=http://www.laborinformationservices.com/|accessdate=4 Jan 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; where David J Burke is also CEO.  This service&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laborinformationservices.com/ LIS website]&lt;/ref&gt; provides workers a chance to talk "directly" with professional consultants during organizing campaigns which allows questions and answers from sources other than professional union organizers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuc.org.uk/union/index.cfm?mins=267&amp;minors=27&amp;majorsubjectid=14/TUC Organizing Academy in UK]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aflcio.org/aboutus/oi/indspecific.cfm/%20AFLCIO%20Training%20Institute{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlc.edu/educational-programs/union-skills-classes/National Labor Institute] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720013822/http://www.nlc.edu/educational-programs/union-skills-classes/National |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   "Direct communications with employees during union activity must be conducted in strict accordance with the definitions and guidelines provided within the Landrum-Griffin Act known as the [[Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act]] passed by the U.S. Congress in 1959. It requires detailed reporting of all monies paid for third party activities be provided via Form LM10 which is later posted for public record."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbglabor.com/services.aspx?cid=8#36/TBG website: Services: Direct Communications]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to their webpage, Labor Information Services is necessary because "the increase of non English speaking workers throughout U.S. industries has made communications (third party persuading) to a company's workforce a major challenge. The supervisors and managers at most companies are not bi-lingual, they do not know the law (National Labor Relations Act) nor can they be expected to answer employee questions in the short time frame of a union organizing campaign." Labor Information Services consultants are fluent in [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], and a number of [[varieties of Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laborinformationservices.com/#3&lt;/ref&gt;

==AFL-CIO and TUC Agreement on anti-union activities of U.S. firms==
A report released in 2008 called "US Union Avoidance Consultants: A Threat to the Rights of British Workers"  commissioned by the [[Trades Union Congress]] (UK) to coincide with their joint announcement with the [[AFL-CIO]] (USA) of their campaign to thwart employer efforts which they claimed to "demonise trade unions and scare employees from joining up."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuc.org.uk/union/tuc-14301-f0.cfm/Union Busters not welcome in the UK, see par. 3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.aflcio.org/2008/02/22/afl-cio-uk-unions-join-forces-against-union-busters/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201000417/http://blog.aflcio.org/2008/02/22/afl-cio-uk-unions-join-forces-against-union-busters/ |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was designed to demonise companies which employ consultancies during recognition campaigns and ballot elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tuc.org.uk/extras/protocolagreement.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229224010/http://www.tuc.org.uk/extras/protocolagreement.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report examined tactics allegedly used by U.S. consultants and law firms, including detailed descriptions of Burke Group and clients in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tuc.org.uk/extras/loganreport.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524160721/http://www.tuc.org.uk/extras/loganreport.pdf |archivedate=2010-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In response, a Burke Group press release noted, the "report was biased and misleading based on subjective partisan research for which no request has ever been made to TBG nor its clients to review the veracity of the statements/conclusions contained therein before going to print."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2794237/Union-recognition-dispute-ruling-altered-after-consultants-complain.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Union-recognition dispute ruling altered after consultants complain | first=Richard | last=Tyler | date=2008-08-04 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tbg724pr"&gt;.{{cite web|url=http://www.theburkegroup.eu.com/news.aspx?newsID=125|title=CAC Amends Its Judgement About The Burke Group|last=The Burke Group|date=24 July 2008|accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cable and Wireless Case Study==
In May 2007, the Communication Workers Union in the UK petitioned Cable and Wireless for "automatic recognition" of their Field Service team by filing form 1A which defines and describes the potential unit to the Central Arbitration Committee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cac.gov.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;  After review, the Central Arbitration Committee sanctioned the unit.  However Cable and Wireless Worldwide decided to challenge the decision due to the relatively small size of the unit and concerns about potential fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200910/jtselect/jtrights/5/5we75.htm/Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007, reps employed by the Communication Workers Union were assigned at Cable and Wireless to provide guidance to employees regarding joining their union,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cwu.org/52991/cable-amp-wireless.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414141229/http://www.cwu.org/52991/cable-amp-wireless.html |archivedate=2013-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cable and Wireless also employed reps to provide guidance to Cable and Wireless management.  But according to an article in The Guardian, the Communication Workers Union expressed "shock" saying that such hiring "can only lead to an atmosphere of bitterness and resentment."&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;"CWU attacks Cable &amp; Wireless for hiring US 'union-busters'", The Guardian, http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2007/aug/18/7 retrieved 6/15/2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 2008, after a review of the “appropriate bargaining unit”, the Central Arbitration Committee ordered a workforce ballot election process (as opposed to automatic recognition) as the best way to decide the most appropriate form of representation.  The subsequent ballot election resulted in a 92% turnout of the Cable and Wireless Field Services team where 77% voted against the Communication Worker’s Union as their representative for collective bargaining.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vxv4mOkheooC&amp;pg=PA328&amp;lpg=PA328&amp;dq=cable+and+wireless+and+CWU+evidence&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lv8GyAtuCh&amp;sig=l6-JrzCWNrDFDXTPPg4jqKZFlAU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cxMPUf27MIHViwKkwYCADw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=cable%20and%20wireless%20and%20CWU%20evidence&amp;f=false/Any of Our Business?:  Human Rights and the UK Private Sector, Volume 2, Joint Committee on Human Rights: Evidence, Ev P 328]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, to dispute the outcome of the ballot election, the Communication Workers Union filed a complaint to the Central Arbitration Committee and The Joint Committee on Human Rights.  Annotated from evidence presented at the hearing: &lt;blockquote&gt; “The Burke Group (TBG) was engaged by Cable and Wireless to advise them on the statutory recognition process because it was complex and unfamiliar to Cable and Wireless.  TBG helped Cable and Wireless to implement a 'fact-based' approach to the ballot process which enabled managers to inform their teams about the union recognition process and what it would mean for them.  The Burke Group did not engage directly with employees in the bargaining unit, and they supported the ballot process.  Both Cable and Wireless and the Communication Workers Union had equal access to employees and colleagues during the 20 day ballot process.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200910/jtselect/jtrights/5/5we75.htm/Publications Parliament UK],&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''The Go-Giver: A Little Story about a Powerful Business Idea''''' is a [[business fable|business book]] written by Bob Burg and John D. Mann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burg.com|title=Bob Burg - Influence &amp; Success InsightsHome - Bob Burg - Influence &amp; Success Insights|website=www.burg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johndavidmann.com/|title=John David Mann - New York Times Bestselling Author|website=John David Mann}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a story about the power of giving. The first edition was published on December 27, 2007 by [[Portfolio Hardcover]].

== Summary ==
The ''Go-Giver'' as the authors tell, revolves around the story of a young professional (Joe) who is striving for success. Joe is ambitious, however lately it seems like his hard work and efforts are not paying off in terms of results. Following a disappointing quarter—in terms of sales results—he inadvertently seeks the mentorship of ''The Chairman''.&lt;ref&gt;"http://timesheetchronicles.wordpress.com/2012/01/07/on-the-go-giver/". The Timesheet Chronicles - Omar Halabieh.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joe then embarks on a learning journey by meeting ''Go-Givers''—friends of ''The Chairman''. Through these interactions he learns of the "Five Laws of Stratospheric Success":

#Value: ''Your true worth is determined by how much more you give in value than you take in payment.''
#Compensation: ''Your income is determined by how many people you serve and how well you serve them.''
#Influence: ''Your influence is determined by how abundantly you place other people's interests first.''
#Authenticity: ''The most valuable gift you have to offer is yourself.''
#Receptivity: ''The key to effective giving is to stay open to receiving.''

== Early life &amp; education ==
Born in [[Germany]], he moved to [[London]] in 1948 to join his mother, who had remarried after his father’s death. Later he attended [[University of Southampton]].&lt;ref name="f"/&gt;

== Career==
Charlwood serves as the [[executive chairman]] of Charlwood Pacific Group, which owns Century 21 Asia-Pacific, Uniglobe Travel International,  Centum Financial Group and Real Property Management Canada. These companies have more than 1,700 franchise locations with more than 26,000 support staff in 561 cities in 67 countries, making it one of the largest international franchise systems in [[Canada]], reportedly by [[REM (magazine)]].&lt;ref name="REM"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCloskey|first1=Dennis|title=U.

He established UNIGLOBE Travel International in 1979, which is one of the largest travel agencies in number of outlets in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Berendien Lubbe|title=Tourism Distribution: Managing the Travel Intermediary|date=2000|publisher=Juta and Company Ltd|isbn=978-07-02154-1-88|pages=108, 109, 110|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=AVtWc5BoLAQC&amp;dq=Entrepreneur+of+the+Year+U.+Gary+Charlwood&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 U. Gary along with [[Peter H.

Currently, [[Century 21 (real estate)|Century 21]] remains one of the largest companies in Canada with more than 400 locations and 10,000 system members. The Charlwood Pacific Group also holds 50% ownership in Century 21 Asia Pacific. His Canadian and Asian Century 21 companies have a combined 939 franchisees, employing 19000 salespeople as of June 2016.&lt;ref name="Swanepoel"/&gt;

In 2002, he founded Centum, a [[mortgage brokerage]] franchise brand. His Canadian and Asian Century 21 companies have a combined 939 franchisees, employing 19,000 salespeople,  as of June 2016.,&lt;ref name="biv"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Korstrom|first1=Glen|title=Successful franchise entrepreneurs share expansion lessons|url=https://biv.com/article/2016/06/successful-franchise-entrepreneurs-share-expansion|publisher=[[Business in Vancouver]]|date=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, he acquired the Real Property Management (RPM) rights for Canada, a [[Utah]] based company which manages properties for real estate investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Charlwood Pacific Group brings property management franchise to Canada|url=http://www.remonline.com/charlwood-pacific-group-brings-property-management-franchise-to-canada/|publisher=[[REM (magazine)|REM]]|date=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="biv"/&gt;

Before starting his own company, Charlwood also worked for [[Western Airlines]] (now [[Delta Air Lines]]) and [[CP Air]] (now [[Air Canada]]).&lt;ref name="REM"/&gt;

He was elected as Chairman of the International Franchise Association of Washington, DC, the only non-American to ever hold the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Appointments|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-659359.html|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=April 6, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4793">A '''Unique Transaction Identifier''' ([[Acronym]]: '''UTI'''), alternatively called '''Unique Swap Identifier''' (Acronym: '''USI''') is a globally [[unique identifier]] for individual [[Financial transaction|transactions]] in financial markets. USIs were introduced in late 2012 in the U.S. in the context of [[Dodd-Frank]] regulation, where reporting of transactions to [[Trade Repository|Trade Repositories]] first became mandatory. European financial market regulations followed suit, with reporting to Trade Repositories under [[European Market Infrastructure Regulation|EMIR]] requiring UTIs from February 2014 on. The use of the UTI is also mandatory for regulatory reporting under [[Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency|REMIT]]. Strictly speaking, the term USI is specific to the U.S. regulation, while UTI is specific to EU regulations. In practice, both terms are used interchangeable, in particular within large trading firms reporting under both regimes.

== Structure ==
A UTI/USI is an [[alphanumeric]] code of fixed length, with the maximum length defined as either 42 (U.S.) or 52 (EU) characters. The UTI typically consists of a [[Substring#Prefix|prefix]] followed by the [[Concatenation|concatenated]] code value. Taken together, prefix and value form the UTI, and should be globally unique.

The prefix portion of the UTI code should be a unique code for the code issueing authority. Ideally, the prefix would have reused the [[Legal Entity Identifier]] (LEI) of the entity issueing the UTI. LEI codes are used across the financial reporting regimes in the U.S. (Dodd-Frank) and Europe (EMIR / MiFID). However, the LEI code length of 20 characters represented a problem for many systems, which in practice limited the usable prefix length to 10 characters. In June 2013, [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association|ISDA]] working groups suggested that the characters 7 through 16 of the 20 character global LEI number should be used as the UTI prefix. This would have led to clashes between UTIs generated for different organisations having the same characters 7 through 16 in their LEIs. Now the recommended best practice entails a 10 character UTI Prefix, algorithmically derived from an entity’s 20 character LEI using [[Hash function|hash algorithms]].

The second component of the UTI is the code value, sometimes called the Transaction Identifier part. The CFTC defines the transaction identifier part as an alphanumeric code of variable length, up to a maximum of 32 characters. In addition to alphanumeric characters, certain special characters are permissible as internal delimiters: [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]], [[hyphen]], [[Full stop|period]], and [[underscore]]. These special characters may not start or end the code, nor may they be used consecutively.

The [[European Securities and Markets Authority|ESMA]] recommend that the Trade ID should be formed by the concatenation (without separators) of the three elements; the characters 'E02', the  [[Legal Entity Identifier|LEI]] of the generating entity and a unique Trade ID generated by the generating entity. The prefixes 'E00' through 'E99' are reserved by the [[European Securities and Markets Authority|ESMA]].

[[Check digit]]s are not a prescribed part of the UTI, but some issueing systems have them as part of the code value.

'''William Byrd III''' (September 6, 1728{{spaced ndash}}January 1 or January 2, 1777) was the son of [[William Byrd II]] and the grandson of [[William Byrd I]].&lt;ref name=EV&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Emory G.|title=William Byrd (1728–1777)|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Byrd_William_1728-1777|publisher=Encyclopedia Virginia|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He inherited his family's estate of approximately 179,000 acres of land in Virginia and continued their planter prestige as a member of the [[Virginia House of Burgesses]].

He chose to fight in the [[French and Indian War]] rather than spend much time in Richmond. In 1756 he was colonel of the Second [[Virginia Regiment]].

William Byrd III had a reputation as a notorious gambler.  He initiated what was said to have been the first major horse race in the New World, involving other planters [[Samuel Ogle]], [[John Tayloe II]], Francis Thornton, and [[Benjamin Tasker Jr.]]

Byrd III eventually fathered five children by his first wife (Eliza Carter, m. 1748, d. 1760), and fathered ten more by his second wife, [[Mary Willing]], daughter of [[Charles Willing]] of [[Philadelphia]].  After he squandered the Byrd fortune on building a magnificent mansion at [[Westover Plantation]], gambling, and bad investments, Byrd III parceled up much of the land he had inherited from his father and sold it off to raise money to pay his debts.  He also sold the enslaved African laborers who had worked on his estate.

Although his sale of land and slaves generated a huge sum it still was not enough to pay off his creditors.  Later, Byrd resorted to a lottery, the prizes of which would come from his estate, Belvidere, at the falls of the [[James River]]. However the lottery failed to generate sufficient revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dabney|first=Virginius|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Auw-cdKZmnoC&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Richmond: The Story of a City: Revised and Expanded Edition|page=19|year=1990|location=[[Charlottesville, Virginia]]|publisher=University Press of Virginia|isbn=0813912741|oclc=20263021}} At [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Despondent and nearly broke, Byrd III committed [[suicide]] on January 1 or 2, 1777.  He was buried in the cemetery at the old [[Westover Church]].

The 10 children of his second marriage (to [[Mary Willing]]) were: Maria Horsmanden Byrd, Evelyn Taylor Byrd, Charles Willing Byrd (died as child), Abby Byrd, Anne Willing Byrd, William Boyd Byrd, [[Charles Willing Byrd]], Dorothy Byrd (died as child), Jane Byrd and Richard Willing Byrd.

'''William Henry Beatty''' (December 10, 1833 – November 20, 1912), was a [[Canada|Canadian]] lawyer and businessman.

William Henry Beatty was the eldest of three sons and five daughters of James Beatty, an Irish born  Toronto merchant.   James had operated the British Woollen and Cotton Warehouse on the south side of [[King Street (Toronto)|King Street]] and had served in the militia, rising to the rank of Colonel.   In 1832, he had married Ann, the daughter of James McKowen of Dublin.   He was educated at [[Upper Canada College]] from 1842 to 1845. Some years later Beatty decided to study law.  He articled with [[John Leys (politician)|John Leys]] and attended lectures at [[Osgoode Hall]]. He was admitted to the Bar February 5, 1863 and entered into partnership with Edward Marion Chadwick who was from an important Guelph family also of Irish origin and his future brother-in-law. On Tuesday 28 June 1864, Chadwick married Beatty's sister, Ellen at St. James Cathedral.  Regrettably Ellen, the woman who had brought the two partners together, died suddenly in February of the following year, after only a few hours of illness.  
Chadwick's short-lived marriage to Ellen may have helped cement the partnership, but the success of the firm was intimately connected with Beatty's marriage.  In April, 1865, Beatty remarried Charlotte Louisa Worts at [[Little Trinity Anglican Church]]. She was the eldest daughter of [[James Gooderham Worts]], was one of the two partners in the [[Gooderham &amp; Worts]] distillery and milling business and an important figure in a number of other businesses. 

Beatty and Chadwick remained partners for almost 50 years.   Of the two, it was Beatty who made the firm Canada's largest law firm, numbering 16 lawyers in 1901.  As a lawyer, Beatty helped his clients establish and manage their businesses.  He remained the managing partner of the firm until 1906, personally overseeing the many details of its operation.   

Beatty was also a businessman.  By 1890 he had become the principal legal and business adviser to the Gooderham and Worts business empire and was one of the most prominent members of the developing Canadian financial community.  At various times, he served as a director of Gooderham &amp; Worts, Limited. (the company he incorporated on Worts' death to continue the partnership business), Vice-President of London and Ontario Investment Company and Canada's first trust company, the Toronto General Trusts Corporation, and was President of the [[Bank of Toronto]], the Toronto Silver Plate Company, the Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation and the Confederation Life Association, an insurance company that he helped found in 1871 and manage for over forty years .  

He was active in the [[Toronto Board of Trade]], co-authoring with [[Wallace Nesbitt]]  a set of arbitration rules for the board.  He also represented the Board in 1896 at the Congress of the Chambers of Commerce of the British Empire in London, England. 

Although, in his words he did not take "any active interest in politics", he was a "true blue Conservative"  and when he thought it necessary, he used his political connections and his personal friendship with [[John A. Macdonald|Sir John A. Macdonald]] and [[Charles Tupper|Sir Charles Tupper]] to assist his clients.

The '''World Chamber of Commerce (WCC)''' is a 501(c)(3) [[non-profit]] global organization dedicated to fostering international trade, cultural and humanitarian cooperation.  The World Chamber organizes initiatives and events targeted at furthering these aims. The WCC develops partnerships and acts as a liaison between international and local businesses, supporting efforts from embassies, consulates, multilateral organizations, bi-national chambers of commerce, and businesses promoting global commerce, economic, cultural and social exchange. The WCC headquarters is in Atlanta, United States.

==History==
The World Chamber of Commerce was founded by International Trade Consultant Solange Warner in 2008.  The organization's first activities were a set of successful international trade seminars which served to bring together the international and local business community in Atlanta.  Warner also developed the " WCC International Hero Award" to recognize individuals who have demonstrated excellence in international trade, cultural and humanitarian work; along with the "WCC International Trade Process" to assist international business with initial complimentary advice, when entering the U.S. business market.

==Biography==

===Personal life===
The son of former Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Shamir]] and his wife Shulamit, Yair Shamir was born in [[Ramat Gan]] and raised in [[Tel Aviv]]. He was named after [[Avraham Stern|Avraham "Yair" Stern]], founder of [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]], a Jewish underground movement that functioned in the years before the founding of the modern State of Israel. When he was a year old, his father Yitzhak was captured by the British and exiled to [[Eritrea]]. When Yair was two years old, his mother was arrested as a Lehi activist. The family was not reunited until the end of 1948.

Shamir lives in [[Savyon]] and is married to Ella, with whom he has three children and seven grandchildren.

===Military career===
Shamir served in the [[Israeli Air Force]] from 1963 to 1988 as a pilot, engineer and commander. In 1974, during his military service, Shamir completed a degree in electrical engineering at the [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology]]. In 1988 Shamir was honorably discharged with the rank of colonel.&lt;ref name="shalem"&gt;{{cite web|title=Yair Shamir|url=http://www.shalem.org.il/Biography/Yair-Shamir.html|publisher=Shalem Center|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="calcalist-maatz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jpost-shamir" /&gt;

===Private sector career===
Shamir served as the General Manager of [[Scitex]] Israel and as Corporate Vice President of Scitex (1988–1994), CEO of Elite Food Industries (1994–1995), Vice President of the Challenge Fund, an Israeli venture capital fund (1995–1997), President and CEO of VCON Telecommunications (1997–2002) and as Chairman (2002–2006), Chairman and Managing Partner of Catalyst, a venture capital fund (since 1999), Chair of Shamir Optical Industry Ltd. (2005–2007) and as a member of the boards of high-tech companies such as Mercury Orckit, Mirabilis, Comfy, Longitudinal, DSP Group and Poalim Capital Markets. Between 2004 and 2005, Shamir served as chair of the board of directors of [[El Al]], the flag-carrier of Israel.&lt;ref name="jpost-shamir" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ibt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jpost-elite-highbeam" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Profile: Yair Shamir|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=656944&amp;privcapId=1415893&amp;previousCapId=13103451&amp;previousTitle=Rubner%20Technology%20Ventures%20Ltd|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bizportal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="israelhayom" /&gt;

====Israel Aerospace Industries====
Between 2005 and 2011, Shamir served as the chairman of [[Israel Aerospace Industries]] (IAI), where he worked without pay.&lt;ref name="israelhayom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="calcalist-appointment" /&gt; After the end of his first tenure, the Finance Minister [[Roni Bar-On]]  made its renewal conditional on Shamir's signing a document barring him from engaging in political activity. Despite Shamir's reluctance, his tenure was renewed.

Between 2005 and 2011, Chairman Shamir oversaw the company's phenomenal recovery. During his first year, Shamir replaced 13 of the company's 19 top managers. After he took office, the company’s net profit grew from $2 million in 2005 to $130 million in 2006. The revenues grew from $2.341 billion to $3.148 billion by 2010 with a net profit of $94 million. Under Shamir's leadership, Israel Aerospace Industries issued NIS 1.4 billion in tradable bonds. During this period the company entered the Russian market, established a leading position in the drone industry and launched four satellites into space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=IAI takes wing|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18281744|accessdate=7 September 2012|newspaper=The Economist|date=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversially, in 2011, Defense Minister [[Ehud Barak]] appointed Dov Bahrav of [[Amdocs]] as chairman. Shamir is thought to have been the key person behind IAI's [[initial public offering]].&lt;ref name="calcalist-appointment" /&gt; In 2011, after six years at the IAI, Shamir became the director of the [[National Roads Company of Israel]].&lt;ref name="walla" /&gt; According to Shamir, when he voluntarily left the army to go into business, his father would not talk to him for several months because he had held service to the country higher than material gain. However, Shamir states that he moved to the business world to promote Israel's industry and not out of material considerations.&lt;ref name="israelhayom" /&gt;

====Private board memberships====
Shamir currently serves on the Board of Directors of several private companies as well as on several [[NASDAQ]] traded companies including: [[Commtouch]] (CTCH), [[DSP Group]] (DSPG), Cyalume (CYLU) and Selway (OTCBB:SWCAU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyalume (CYLU) insider: Yair Shamir|url=http://www.macroaxis.com/invest/manager/CYLU--Yair_Shamir|publisher=Macroaxis|accessdate=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Directors Named to Commtouch Board|url=http://www.commtouch.com/press-releases/new-directors-named-commtouch-board|publisher=Commtouch|accessdate=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corporate Governance - Biography:  Yair Shamir- Director|url=http://ir.dspg.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=101665&amp;p=irol-govBio&amp;ID=109237|publisher=DSP Group|accessdate=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tsipori|first=Tali|title=Yair Shamir's Selway Capital raises $20m on Wall Street|newspaper=Globes: Israel's Business Arena|date=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public service===
Shamir also has several public roles and sits on the Board of Governors of the Technion and on the Board of Trustees of [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]]. He also serves as chairman of the board of directors of the [[Shalem Center]].&lt;ref name="shalem" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jpost-shamir" /&gt;&lt;ref name="israelhayom" /&gt;

Shamir is the chairman and co-founder of Gvahim, a non-profit organization that helps highly qualified [[Aliyah|new immigrants]] accomplish their professional goals in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gvahim: Members of the Board|url=https://gvahim.org.il/Default.aspx?KPages=33|publisher=Gvahim On-Line|accessdate=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shamir inspired and underwrote a series of [[Rohr Jewish Learning Institute]] classes commemorating the centennial of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=JLI Elevates Lunch Break in Israel’s Corporate Offices|url=http://lubavitch.com/news/article/2056293/JLI-Elevates-Lunch-Break-in-Israel-s-Corporate-Offices.html|agency=Chabad Lubavitch World HQ|date=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Political career====
In May 2012 Yisrael Beiteinu Chairman [[Avigdor Lieberman]] appointed Shamir deputy leader of the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brot|first=Tzvika|title=Lieberman names Yair Shamir Yisrael Beiteinu deputy|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4225975,00.html|accessdate=7 September 2012|newspaper=ynetnews|date=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to the Knesset in the [[Israeli legislative election, 2013|2013 elections]], and was appointed Minister of Agriculture.

In January 2015 Shamir announced that he was leaving the party and would not contest the [[Israeli legislative election, 2015|2015 elections]] due to disagreements with Lieberman over foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/yisrael-beytenu-minister-shamir-to-step-down/ Yisrael Beytenu minister Shamir to step down] Times of Israel, 15 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview given to ''[[The Jewish Press]]'' in 2004, Shamir said that he did not believe in surrendering Israeli-controlled land to the Arabs, but that he would compromise if this was necessary. He also said that then-US President [[George W. Bush]] was better for Israel than then-Israeli Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]]. He also criticized [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] for caving in to pressure too easily, and believed that Israel should do what it thinks is right without regard to global opinion. Shamir was also opposed to the [[Elhanan Tannenbaum|Tannenbaum prisoner exchange]] with [[Hezbollah]].&lt;ref name="jewishpress" /&gt;
