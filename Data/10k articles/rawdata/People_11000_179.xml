'''Alec David Edward Muffett''' (born April 22, 1968) is an Anglo-American internet-security evangelist, architect, and software engineer.  He is principally known for his work on [[Crack (password software)|Crack]], the original Unix password cracker, and for the CrackLib password-integrity testing library; he is also active in the [[Open Source]] software community. He worked&lt;ref name="pastjob"&gt;[https://twitter.com/AlecMuffett/status/756451264121167872 I've retired from FB now] Twitter&lt;/ref&gt; as a Software Engineer for [[Facebook]].

==Early life==
{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2017}}
Alec Muffett was born in [[Pennsylvania]], the third child, and only son, of David Joseph Mead Muffett and Kathleen Jubb;  his sisters are Louise and Amanda.  Alec was educated at Sacred Heart College, [[Droitwich]] and [[University College London]], where he studied Astronomy.

After graduation he commenced work as a lab assistant and Unix administrator at the university.  In 1988 he took a position as Systems Programmer at the [[University of Wales in Aberystwyth]], and it was there that he wrote the first version of the [[dictionary attack]] tool [[Crack (password software)|Crack]]. He was active on the [[Zardoz (computer security)|Zardoz list]] during this period.

== Tech career ==
Muffett joined [[Sun Microsystems]] in 1992, working initially as a systems administrator.  He rose “through the ranks” to become the Principal Engineer for Security, a position which he held until he was retrenched, with many others, in 2009&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;[http://uk.linkedin.com/in/alecmuffett], LinkedIn; accessed March 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; (shortly before [[Sun acquisition by Oracle|Oracle acquired Sun]]). While at Sun he was one of the researchers who worked on the factorization of the 512 bit RSA Challenge Number; [[RSA numbers|RSA-155]] was successfully factorized in August 1999.&lt;ref name="RSA"&gt;[http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2098 RSA-155 is factored!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722014245/http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2098 |date=2012-07-22 }}, rsa.com; accessed March 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Muffett also worked on the Sun MD5 hash algorithm, which was introduced in [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] 9 update 2. The new algorithm drew on Muffett's work in pluggable crypt, and it is now implemented in many different languages, for example [[Python (programming language)|Python]].&lt;ref name="MD5"&gt;[http://packages.python.org/passlib/lib/passlib.hash.sun_md5_crypt.html] passlib.hash.sun_md5_crypt - Sun MD5 Crypt], packages.python.org; accessed March 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The algorithm uses the complete text of the famous soliloquy from Shakespeare's ''Hamlet'': "[[To be, or not to be|To be or not to be, that is the question...]]" as the constant data.  Muffett justified the choice of this text because "it exposes more programmers to Shakespeare, which has got to be a good thing".&lt;ref name="Hamlet"&gt;[http://dropsafe.crypticide.com/article/date/2005/12/05#post20051205182853] OpenSolaris, Pluggable Crypt, and the SunMD5 Password Hash Algorithm&lt;/ref&gt; After a sabbatical year, Muffett began to work on [http://themineproject.org/ The Mine! Project], as lead developer.  He subsequently became a director and consultant at [http://www.greenlanesecurity.com/ Green Lane Security]; he also consults for [http://www.surevine.com/ Surevine]. He became a director of the [[Open Rights Group]] in October 2011.&lt;ref name="positions"&gt;[http://www.openrightsgroup.org/people/board] Board of Directors, Open Rights Group&lt;/ref&gt;
Muffett blogs professionally, for Computer World at [http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/unscrewing-security/ Unscrewing Security] and personally at [http://dropsafe.crypticide.com/  Dropsafe], and has numerous publications to his credit, besides being an frequent presenter at technical conferences.&lt;ref name="speaking"&gt;[http://lanyrd.com/profile/alecmuffett/sessions/ Alec Muffett's Speaking History], Lanyrd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Muffett is a co-inventor (with Darren Moffat and Casper Dik) of the patent "Method and apparatus for implementing a pluggable password obscuring mechanism", United States Patent 7,249,260, Issued June 12, 2003.&lt;ref name="patent"&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US7249260 "Patent: Method and apparatus for implementing a pluggable password obscuring mechanism"], Google Patents.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander Konstantinovich Nikitin''' ({{lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Константи́нович Ники́тин}}; born 16 May 1952) is a [[Russia]]n former [[submarine]] officer and [[nuclear safety]] inspector turned environmentalist. In 1996 he was accused of [[espionage]] for revealing the perils of decaying nuclear submarines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian Whistle Blower Acquitted |first=Angela |last=Charlton |agency=[[Associated Press]] |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/2000/Russian-Whistle-Blower-Acquitted/id-c32ded5d4a27a9e19193e041d19609b8 |date=13 September 2000 |accessdate=24 February 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128233331/http://www.apnewsarchive.com/2000/Russian-Whistle-Blower-Acquitted/id-c32ded5d4a27a9e19193e041d19609b8 |archivedate=28 November 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2000 he became the first Russian to be completely acquitted of a charge of [[treason]] in the Soviet or post-Soviet era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Old Habits Die Hard: Aleksandr Nikitin, the European Court of Human Rights, and Criminal Procedure in the Russian Federation|journal=[[Boston College International and Comparative Law Review|B.C.

==Whistleblower and espionage accusations==
Nikitin started to co-operate with [[Norway|Norwegian]] environmental [[Bellona Foundation]] in 1994. He was arrested in February 1996 by Russian [[FSB (Russia)|FSB]] and charged with [[treason]] through [[espionage]] for his contributions to a Bellona report on the nuclear safety within the Russian [[Northern Fleet]]. On 30 August, [[Amnesty International]] declared him a [[prisoner of conscience]] and began an international campaign for his release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1081462.html |title=Russia: Nikitin Is A Prisoner of Conscience, Says Amnesty |date=30 August 1996 |agency=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Free Europe]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128232708/http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1081462.html |archivedate=28 November 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After having spent ten months in pre-trial detention in [[Saint Petersburg]] he was released on the order of [[Mikhail Katushev]], the then deputy [[Prosecutor General of Russia|Russian Prosecutor General]], in December 1996.

The charges were however, not dropped. Nikitin first stood trial in October 1998, when the Saint Petersburg [[Judiciary of Russia#Regional courts|City Court]] rejected the evidence against him. But rather than acquitting him, the Court sent the case back to the FSB for additional investigation. The [[Supreme Court of Russia]] confirmed this decision in February 1999, and the FSB filed new charges in July 1999.

The second trial started at the Saint Petersburg City Court in November 1999, and ended on 29 December with a full acquittal. The prosecution appealed to the Supreme Court, but the acquittal was confirmed and reached legal force on 17 April 2000. Nikitin was defended by a group of attorneys in law, including [[Yuri Schmidt|Yury Schmidt]], [[Ivan Pavlov (lawyer)|Ivan Pavlov]], [[Victor Drozdov]], [[Henri Reznik]] and others.

The prosecution was, however, not willing to call it a day. On 30 May 2000 the Prosecutor General requested the governing body of the Russian Supreme Court, the Presidium, to re-open the case. The basis for the request was that “Nikitin's rights had been violated throughout the proceedings against him, and that these violations had to be repaired” (sic). The Presidium rejected the request on 13 September 2000.

Nikitin is still engaged in environmental and [[human rights]] issues in Russia. He is the head of [[Bellona Foundation]]’s Saint Petersburg branch, and is engaged in environmental and nuclear safety projects, as well as in human rights cases.

In 1997, Nikitin was awarded the [[Goldman Environmental Prize]] from the Goldman Environmental Foundation,&lt;ref name="goldman-prize"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.goldmanprize.org/recipient/alexander-nikitin/ | access-date = 12 November 2015 | publisher = Goldman Environmental Foundation | title = Alexander Nikitin}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as a result of treason charges against him, he was prevented from attending the Prize ceremony.

'''Andrias Christian Evensen''' (December 6, 1874 – October 21, 1917) was a [[Faroe Islanders|Faroese]] priest, editor, writer, and politician for the [[New Self-Government|Home Rule Party]] ({{lang-fo|Sjálvstýrisflokkurin}}). Together with [[Jákup Dahl]], he was one of the first to propagate the use of [[Faroese language|Faroese]], including as a church language in preference to [[Danish language|Danish]].

Evensen was born in [[Viðareiði]].&lt;ref&gt;Kamban, Hanus. 2001. ''J. H. O. Djurhuus'' (= ''Odense University Studies in Scandinavian Languages and Literatures'' 2(26), part 2).

Tórshavn: Fróðskapur / Faroe University Press, p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt; He received his ''[[examen artium]]'' certification in 1894 and the degree of ''[[cand.theol.]]'' in 1901. Evensen became the parish priest in [[Sandur, Faroe Islands|Sandur]] in 1902, and then served as the [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] for the Faroe Islands from April 1917 until his death in October that year. He became the editor of the newspaper ''[[Føringatíðindi]]'' in 1906. Evensen was active in the [[Løgting]] as a parliamentary representative from [[Sandoy]] from 1908 to 1917. He eventually broke away from the [[New Self-Government|Home Rule Party]] ({{lang-fo|Sjálvstýrisflokkurin}}) and was an independent representative during his last year in the Løgting.&lt;ref&gt;Wylie, Jonathan. 1987. ''The Faroe Islands: Interpretations of History''. Lexington: The University Press of Kentucky, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the writer [[Rasmus Rasmussen (writer)|Rasmus Rasmussen]] and the archivist and politician [[Anton Degn]], he established the publisher Hitt føroyska Bókamentafelagið (The Faroese Book Cultivation Association) in 1907. Evensen died in [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref name="Opielka"/&gt;

On her 11th birthday she stood {{convert|6|ft|2|in|cm}} tall and weighed 197 pounds (89 kg). &lt;ref name="biosketch"&gt;A biographical Sketch – Anna H Swan – 1871&lt;/ref&gt; By her 15th birthday Bates was {{convert|7|ft|cm}} tall. She reached her full height three years later. Her feet measured 14.2 inches (36 cm) long.

Anna excelled at [[literature]] and [[music]] and was considered to be very intelligent. She also excelled at her studies of acting, piano and voice. She played [[Lady Macbeth]] in one play. At one time, she nearly burned to death when Barnum's museum was destroyed by fire. The stairs were in flames and she was too large to escape through a window. She did get help and escaped safely. She normally weighed 330 pounds and her highest weight was 371 pounds. When visiting a circus in [[Halifax (former city), Nova Scotia|Halifax]] with which [[Martin Van Buren Bates]] — another enormously tall person — was travelling, Anna was spotted by the promoter and hired on the spot. The giant couple became a touring sensation and eventually fell in love and, on June 17, 1871 in [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] in [[London]], they married. 

In 1872, Anna Swan (now Anna Bates) and her husband purchased {{convert|130|acre|km2}} of land and had furniture made to their specifications. Martin supervised the construction of the house. The main part of the house had {{convert|14|ft|m|spell=in|sing=on}} ceilings, while the doors were extra wide and were {{convert|8|ft|m|spell=in}} tall. The back part of the house was built an average size for servants and guests. Anna conceived two children with Martin. The first was a girl born on May 19, 1872; she weighed 18 pounds and died at birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetslade.com/the-giants-wedding.html|title=The Giants' Wedding - Paul Slade - Journalist|website=www.planetslade.com|accessdate=August 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

While touring in the summer of 1878, Anna was pregnant for the second time. The baby was born on January 18, 1879, and survived only 11 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/swan_anna_haining_11E.html|title=Biography – SWAN, ANNA HAINING – Volume XI (1881-1890) – Dictionary of Canadian Biography|website=biographi.ca|accessdate=August 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the largest newborn ever recorded, at 23 pounds 9 ounces (10.7 kg) and nearly 30&amp;nbsp;inches tall (ca. 75 cm) and each of his feet were six inches (152&amp;nbsp;mm) long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4191765.stm |title=Woman gives birth to 'giant baby' |work=BBC news |date=January 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this she was posthumously awarded a [[Guinness World Record]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/heaviest-birth Heaviest birth]. Guinness World Records. "Anna Bates... gave birth to a boy weighing 9.98 kg (22 lb) and measuring 71.12 cm (28 in) at her home in Seville, Ohio, USA, on 19 January 1879."&lt;/ref&gt; The Bates' resumed touring with the [[Cole Bros. Circus|W.W. Cole Circus]] in the summer of 1879, and again in the spring of 1880. Bates spent her remaining years quietly on the farm that she and her husband owned. She had joined the local [[Baptist Church]] in 1877 and attended services with her husband. 

Anna Bates died suddenly and unexpectedly in her sleep at her home on August 5, 1888, one day before her 42nd birthday.

'''Archie Fire Lame Deer''' or '''Tȟáȟča Hušté''' (1935-2001) was a  US Army veteran, a Wicasa Wakan or Medicine man and a lecturer on [[Lakota people|Lakota people, traditions and]] religion. He grew up on the [[Rosebud Indian Reservation]] served in the US Army during the Korean war, was a Hollywood stuntman and translator. With Richard Erdoes he wrote ''Gift of Power: the life and teachings of a Lakota medicine man.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipl.org/div/natam/bin/browse.pl/A305 Native American Authors Project at IPL]&lt;/ref&gt; He is the son of [[John Fire Lame Deer|John Fire Lame Deer Lakota Medicine Man and the subject of the classic book, "Lame Deer Seeker of Visions]] with Richard Erdoes.

==Person==

'''Archie Fire Lame Deer''' (April 10, 1935 – January 16, 2001) was a [[Lakota Sioux]] spiritual leader, a medicine man and a lecturer and activist of Lakota spirituality.

He was born in Corn Creek, South Dakota, on the [[Rosebud Indian Reservation]]. His father was [[John Fire Lame Deer]], a well known Lakota holy man. Archie grew up with the guidance and teachings of his grandfather, Henry Quick Bear. He attended school at the St. Francis Indian School, but was able to run away at age 14 after many tries. He enlisted in the army twice and was a veteran of the Korean War, a member of the Special Forces and a P.O.W.

Among other temporary careers Archie was a ranch hand on numerous South Dakota ranches, a rattlesnake exterminator, a Hollywood stuntman, a rodeo rider and a foreman on a Hollywood ranch. Upon giving up alcohol addiction in 1971 he also became a drug and alcohol counsellor. Through the Los Angeles Indian Center he ran a program for Native American offenders imprisoned in both State and Federal institutions in California. Archie was instrumental in bringing Lakota purification ceremonies into prisons across the United States and also helped found and run the Santa Barbara Indian Center.

The last twenty years of his life Archie Fire Lame Deer has travelled throughout the world teaching Lakota spiritual beliefs and way of life. In his travels he met and talked with numerous spiritual leaders including the Dalai Lama and the Pope. In 1980 he also spoke in Rotterdam at the Fourth Russell Tribunal on Indigenous Peoples' Rights.

For many years Chief Lame Deer was the intercessor at the annual Crow Dog's Sundance on the Rosebud Indian Reservation, just like his father before him. When Archie died, his son John took his place as a Chief and medicine man and carries on the traditions of the Lame Deer family.
 
Archie Fire Lame Deer was subject of the book Gift of Power: The Life and Teachings of a Lakota Medicine Man, which he wrote together with Richard Erdoes in 1992.  https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-939680-87-0

==Controversy==
On July 12, 1980, Lame Deer was in the process of conducting a [[vision quest]] ceremony for two men, one of whom, Ronald Delgado, was a [[diabetes|diabetic]]. Delgado died during the four-day ceremony. Lame Deer was promptly denounced as a "known fraud" and a "twinkie" ([[New Age]] practitioner) by a few Native American activists and  by some white New Age groups.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=932&amp;dat=19800822&amp;id=5jULAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=s1IDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6924,5829335 Diabetic Dies During 'Vision Quest'], Kingman ''Daily Miner'' 1980-08-22, website found 2009-09-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newagefraud.org/smf/index.php?action=printpage;topic=1817.0 Will Someone Die in a Sweat Lodge This Weekend?]  From a discussion board of the [[Rainbow Family]], a predominantly white group which gathers yearly to pray for world peace.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chief Archie Fire Lame Deer was not one of those "fake" medicine men who took money or was "unqualified".   Archie Fire Lame Deer came from a family of known and respected Oglala Lakota Wicasa Wakan, "Medicine Men" in South Dakota.

Charges were never filed against Lame Deer.

Prior to the incident, Lame Deer had been interviewed by [[Peter Matthiesen]] in 1978 and again in 1979. Mathiesen gratefully acknowledged that Lame Deer had "been kind enough" to include him in a sweat lodge purification ceremony at that time, and described ceremonies of respect performed by Lame Deer at [[Point Conception]] and other places around [[Santa Barbara, California]]. He quoted Lame Deer as being extremely concerned about improperly performed sweat lodges and Sun Dance ceremonies, often conducted by younger Indians with no sense of the proper timing or "feelings" of the year, wind, or weather.&lt;ref&gt;Matthiesen, Peter, "At the Western Gate", in ''Indian Country'' (Viking, 1984), p. 223 ''et seq''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barry Martin Schuler''' (born September 7, 1953 in Jersey City, New Jersey) is an [[United States|American]] [[Internet]] entrepreneur and  former chairman and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[America Online Inc.]] He is best known for leading the AOL team that simplified the online service provider's user interface, making it possible for millions of consumers to gain easy access to the Internet.

==Early years==
Barry Schuler grew up in West '''New York,''' New Jersey. As a suburban youth, Schuler was encouraged early on by his parents to explore the arts (photography, painting and sculpture) as well as electronics. He turned his family's basement into a darkroom while helping his father, a warehouse owner and part-time repair man, tinker with television sets and other gadgetry.&lt;ref name="Borrus"&gt;Borrus, Amy. “AOL's Point Man in the Web War,” BusinessWeek , July 2, 2001.

In the mid-1970s, while completing a bachelor's degree in psychology at [[Rutgers University]], Schuler became captivated by [[filmmaking]]. In 1976, he left the university to produce and direct commercial and industrial films. An avid computer hobbyist and reader of ''[[Popular Electronics]]'', Schuler befriended a group of technical enthusiasts who were developing software applications for [[microcomputer]]s. After assembling a do-it-yourself [[IMSAI 8080|IMSAI computer]] and experiencing first hand the potential of at-home computing, Schuler saw the technology's ability to positively disrupt and enhance the way people lived and worked.&lt;ref name="Borrus" /&gt;   In 1978, he established CMP Communications, an advertising and marketing company devoted to helping high tech entrepreneurs spread the word about the impending revolution in microcomputing.

Schuler quit CMP in 1988 and took a position as president and CEO of [[Cricket Software]], overseeing the development and marketing of color desktop applications for [[Apple Computer]]’s [[Macintosh]], including a Postscript driven drawing program.&lt;ref&gt;Borrus, Amy. “AOL's Point Man in the Web War,” BusinessWeek, July 2, 2001. Retrieved November 2007. {{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_27/b3739174.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202215314/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_27/b3739174.htm |archivedate=2008-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cricket also developed the first color, graphical desktop presentation software, “Cricket Presents.” Cricket was ultimately sold to [[Computer Associates International]] in 1991.

Schuler was President of San Francisco-based [[Jasmine Technologies]] from 1989 to 1990.  Jasmine was a leading Macintosh peripherals developer that buckled under the weight of bitter lawsuits and mounting customer dissatisfaction. Jasmine declared bankruptcy in March 1990 and Schuler resigned shortly thereafter.

Looking to take advantage of the opportunities that a new ‘Interactive” medium would bring, Schuler teamed up with (present day) wife Tracy and David Goldman shortly after and established [[Medior Inc]]., a [[multimedia]] development company, Medior Inc. In 1994, the company entered into a joint venture with, Apple Computer Inc., and Redgate Communications and launched 2Market, considered to be the first [[rich media]] online shopping service.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Peter. “Late Season Greetings From PC Shopping Plans,” New York Times, November 24, 1994.  Retrieved November 2007. https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/24/business/late-season-s-greetings-from-pc-shopping-plans.html?pagewanted=print&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, AOL (America Online) also enlisted Medior's help designing its product to give consumers with little or no computing expertise easy access to its online information services. While at Medior, Schuler and company co-developed a music creation game with Nick Tenbrock and Gary Levenberg of San Francisco-based Interactive Audio. The software, called Rock, Rap and Roll, allowed Macintosh users to quickly build soundtracks in a variety of musical styles.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, Matt. “Tech News.” Variety, March 4, 1993. Retrieved December 3, 2007. 
http://www.variety.com/article/VR104566.html?categoryid=16&amp;cs=1&lt;/ref&gt;  Medior also collaborated with [[Time Warner]], one of its clients, on the building of the world's first digital, switched, interactive broadband communications network delivering a range of services. The service was launched in December 1994 in Orlando, Fla.&lt;ref&gt;“Time Warner introduces world's first full service network in Orlando; Network offers First Digital Interactive Services including Movies on Demand, Home Shopping and Interactive Games” Business Wire.

==AOL years==
In 1995, Medior was acquired by AOL. Schuler, brought over from Medior by AOL founder and CEO [[Steve Case]], was charged with helping him and then president [[Ted Leonsis]] to transform the online service provider into a broad based, consumer-driven medium. Schuler worked his way up the ranks at AOL becoming president of its Interactive Services group in 1998.  During this time, he led the design team that integrated an Internet browser directly in AOL's proprietary user interface (version 5.0) making it possible for millions of computer users to access the Internet through a Web-based portal. He also advocated the opening up of AOL's proprietary message service known as [[Instant messaging|IM]], a key development that allowed its subscriber base to “chat” electronically over the Internet with non-AOL computer users free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Charles. “Microsoft is ‘confusing and deceiving people.’” ZDNet U.K, July 29, 1999.]Retrieved  November  2007.  http://news.zdnet.co.uk/itmanagement/0,1000000308,2072870,00.htm?r=1&lt;/ref&gt;  By January 2001, the same month that AOL announced its merger with Time-Warner, the company's 26 million subscribers were sending an estimated 660 million [[instant messages]] daily.&lt;ref&gt;Gartner, John. “No Whiners at AOL.” Wired, January 9, 2001. Retrieved December 1, 2007. {{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2001/01/40973 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024104221/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2001/01/40973 |archivedate=2012-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was on the heels of the Time Warner merger that Schuler was appointed chairman and CEO of the AOL unit. He was charged with finding ways to turn AOL into an interactive outlet for Time-Warner's various media divisions, which included film, music, television and publishing. The goal was to transform AOL into a high-speed, Internet-based,” one-stop shop for movies, music, interactive video games, phone service, and more.”  &lt;ref&gt;Mehta, Stephanie N. “AOL's Formula: Does It Add Up?” Fortune Magazine [CNNMoney.com], February 4, 2002.  Retrieved November 2007. http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2002/02/04/317480/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In a July 2, 2001 article, ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' reporter Amy Borrus wrote that Schuler, “deserves just as much credit for AOL's explosive success” as then AOL [[Time Warner]] Inc. Chairman Steve Case or co-Chief Operating Officer Robert Pittman. The reporter pointed to the three years Schuler spent running AOL's Interactive Services group, “putting his stamp on much of the design that makes it so simple to use and features that make it so popular with families.” Schuler's objective of converging a souped-up version of AOL's online distribution platform with Time Warner's various media outlets hit several roadblocks one being reluctance on the part of cable companies to open up their network to Internet service providers such as AOL. Likewise, internal dissent over the best ways to merge AOL's distribution channels with Time Warner's more traditional media content plagued the online unit.&lt;ref&gt;Manly, Lorne, Rutenberg, Jim, and Schiesel, Seth. “How Does AOL Fit in the Grand Plan Now?

==After AOL==
Shortly after his departure from AOL, Schuler found himself invited to invest in a start up Ablation Industries, Inc. Ablation Industries, Inc was commercializing (Ultrashort pulse laser) USP laser technology funded by the U.S. government's [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]], also known as DARPA.  When Mr Schuler invested in the company, the name of the company was changed to Raydiance, where he raised a significant amount of venture capital funding to help commercialize new technologies of national interest, among them [[ultrashort pulse laser]]s. A form of [[optoelectronics]], the lasers emits short pulses of highly concentrated energy that can be used to break down [[atom]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows, Peter. “Is This Really the Next Big Thing,” BusinessWeek, June 4, 2007.

In addition to serving as CEO of Raydiance, Schuler is managing director of the [[Draper Fisher Jurvetson]] Growth Fund and serves on the boards of UBMatrix, [[Hands On Mobile]], UU See, [[Synthetic Genomics]], and Visto. Schuler is an investor in [[Adirondack Pictures]]. He also co-produced and helped finance the film ''[[Look (2007 film)|Look]]'', a drama shot entirely from the point of view of surveillance cameras. Written and directed by [[Adam Rifkin]] with [[Brad Wyman]] as his fellow producer. The film was digitally shot in high-definition with all the special effects, post production and music done on Apple's Macintosh computers in a “virtual studio” setting. ''[[Look (2007 film)|Look]]'', released in December 2007, is distributed by Liberated Artists, another Schuler venture.

Schuler is a member of the Rutgers Hall of Distinguished Alumni.

===Meteor Vineyard===
Meteor Vineyard is a {{convert|22|acre|m2|adj=on}} property located in the Coombsville agricultural area of the [[Napa Valley AVA]]. It was established in 1998 by former America Online Inc. Chairman and Chief Executive Barry M. Schuler and his wife, Tracy Strong Schuler. Meteor Vineyard is located at the southeast end of the Napa Valley, near the [[San Francisco Bay]].

Through 2004, Meteor Vineyard's [[grape]]s were sold in bulk to a handful of Napa Valley properties including Dyer, Arietta, Etude and Vineyard 29. In 2005, the Schulers entered into a partnership with winemakers Dawnine Dyer and Bill Dyer to produce a single-vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon bottled under the Meteor Vineyard. The team bottled their first [[vintage]] later that year, and the wine was released beginning 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=Napa Valley Register|url=http://www.napavalleyregister.com/articles/2008/05/16/wine/doc482d14e938122102158523.txt|title=A meteoric rise Meteor Vineyard debuts eastside cab|date=2008-05-16|author=Louisa Hufstader}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15525">'''Bodonchar Munkhag''' (c. 850 &amp;ndash; 900 AD) was a renowned Mongol warlord and a direct [[Family tree of Genghis Khan|ancestor of Genghis Khan]] as well as of the [[Barlas]] Mongols, the tribe of the Central Asian warlord [[Timur]]. 

[[File:Alân Qû'â et ses fils.jpeg|thumb|Butunchar (in blue) shown listening to his mother Alan Gua in a Persian painting from 1430.]]
According to the [[Secret History of the Mongols]], he was the 12th generation nominal (non-biological) descendant of Borte Chino. Genghis Khan was the 9th generation biological descendant of Bodonchar Munkhag (sometimes written Butanchar the Simple). Bodonchar Munkhag is the founder of the [[House of Borjigin]]. [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] tradition dates 'Buzanjar Munqaq' to the rebellion of [[Abu Muslim Khorasani|Abu Muslim]] or 747 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Munis, M.R.M.Agahi, Firdaws al-iqbal, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; The name Borjigin does not come from Bodonchar but from Bodonchar's nominal great-grandfather Borjigidai the Wise (''Borjigidai Mergen''). The date 747 CE corresponds better with Borjigidai Mergen. A confusion with [[Bayanchur Khan]] could also account for this date discrepancy. Bodonchar Munkhag means "little misbegotten simpleton". Bodonchar or more accurately Butunchar (Mongolian back vowel ʊ) is a diminutive form of "butuchi" (illegitimate child, misbegotten, bastard) using the diminutive suffix "-nchar" while Munkhag means fool or simpleton. The meaning of the name contrasts with his elevated stature among the Mongol tribes.

==Historicity of Butunchar Munkhag==
The Mongol tribes of Genghis Khan's time had a very good knowledge of their genealogy, second only to the Arabs according to [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid Al-Din Hamadani]]. In the Secret History of the Mongols (Paragraph 121) Old-man Khorchi Usun of the Baarin tribe leaves [[Jamukha]] and joins Genghis Khan. He tells Genghis Khan: "We (the Baarin) were born from the captured wife of Butunchar Bogd (''Butunchar the Divine Ancestor''). Therefore we are one womb, one blood with Jamukha. We would never leave the side of Jamukha. But Zaarin (a message bearing spirit) came and showed me a vision." He goes on to say that the vision predicted the future rise of Genghis Khan. Butunchar Munkhag was a commonly known figure even among distant tribes such as the Baarin who were descended from the first wife of Butunchar, a captured pregnant woman who described herself as "Jarchuud Adankhan Uriankhajin" ("-jin" is a feminine suffix) meaning "female of the Jarchuud Adankhan clan of the Uriankhai tribe". Although the Secret History of the Mongols includes some mythical elements such as visions and so forth, the individuals and tribes are seen as historical.

==Circumstances of birth==
At the time Butunchar Munkhag was born (around 900CE) the Mongol tribes were located around Mount [[Burkhan Khaldun]] at the source of the [[Onon River]]. The Mongols were the Menggu Shiwei (蒙兀室韋) of the larger [[Shiwei]] (室韋) confederation, a Mongolic-speaking group closely related to the [[Khitan people]]. The paternal (non-biological) great-grandmother of Butunchar was called Mongoljin Gua meaning "beautiful Mongoless" or "fair woman of the Mongol tribe".

The Mongol tribe had lived around Mount Burkhan Khaldun since at least the time of Borte Chino, 12 generations before Bodonchar Munkhag or around 600CE. They shared the area with the ancient Uriankhai tribe, a prominent Shiwei tribe named Wuluohu (烏羅護) in the Chinese histories. There they lived a pastoral life supplemented by hunting the abundant game of the surrounding forested mountains. To the north was located the [[Bargut]] tribe (around Lake Baikal) and the [[Tümed|Khori Tumed]] tribe (also around Lake Baikal). To the east was located the Tatar tribes (Airigud Tatar, Buirigud Tatar etc.) who also belonged to the Shiwei group. Slightly to the west of the Mongols were the ancient [[Bayid]] tribe. These are the pre-Butunchar early tribes mentioned in the Secret History that had marriage relations with the early Mongols.

Many of the other tribes in the Secret History were later descendants of Butunchar, such as the Jadaran, [[Baarin Mongolian|Baarin]], Jegureid, Noyokhon, Barlas, Budagad, Adarkin, Urugud, [[Manghit|Mangud]], [[Behsud (Hazara tribe)|Besud]], Oronar, Khonkhotan, Arulad, [[Sonid Left Banner|Sunid]], Khabturkhas, Geniges, [[Taichud]] and Jurkin. All these core Borjigin tribes were clustered around Mount Burkhan Khaldun and were still known as Mongols. In the Secret History (Paragraph 52) it says after listing all the tribes born from Butunchar Munkhag: "[[Khabul Khan]] was in charge of all Mongols (Khamag Mongol). After Khabul Khan, although Khabul Khan had seven sons, [[Ambaghai|Ambaghai Khan]] the son of Sengum Bilge took charge of all the Mongols."

The Secret History of Mongols gives the following account of the immediate ancestry of Butunchar Munkhag:
{{quote|Kharchu's son was Borjigidai Mergen. His (Borjigidai's) wife was Mongoljin Gua. Borjigidai Mergen's son was Torgoljin Bayan (Torgoljin the Rich). His wife was Borogchin Gua. He had a servant called Boroldai Suyalbi and two famous horses, one black, one brown. Torgoljin's sons were Duva Sokhor (Duva the Blind) and Dobun Mergen. Duva the Blind could see with only one eye, a very long distance. One day Duva the Blind ascended Burkhan Khaldun with his younger brother Dobun Mergen. Duva the Blind looked out and saw a group of people moving towards Tunkhelig Stream. He said "Among that moving camp of people there is a beautiful girl sitting in the exposed seat of a covered carriage. If she hasn't been given to anybody, let me beg her for you, my younger brother Dobun Mergen." And he sent Dobun Mergen to go take a look. Dobun Mergen reached those people and saw that she was indeed an exceptionally beautiful girl, named Alan Gua, of great renown and not given in marriage to anybody. 

As concerns that group of migrants, Bargujin Gua, the daughter of Bargudai Mergen the ''ezen'' (owner lord) of Khol Bargujin Tukhum (Khol Bargujin Forested Valley), had been given in marriage to Khorilardai Mergen the ''[[noyan|noyon]]'' (ruling lord) of the Khori Tumed tribe. That girl named Alan Gua was born in the territory of the Khori Tumed at a place called Arig Us (Pure Water). Khorilardai Mergen had had disputes over hunting ground at his native land of the Khori Tumed. He was fenced out. So he left saying "Burkhan Khaldun is a good hunting ground, rich in game" and became the Khorilar clan. That was why he came to Burkhan Khaldun, to the local ''ezen'' Shinchi Bayan (Shinchi the Rich) of the Uriankhai who had erected a ''burkhan'' (Buddha statue) on the mountain. This was how Dobun Mergen begged and received in marriage Alan Gua the daughter of Khorilardai Mergen of the Khori Tumed, born at Arig Us. 

[[Alan Gua]] came to Dobun Mergen and bore him two sons. Their names were Belgunudei and Bugunudei. Dobun's elder brother Duva the Blind had four sons. Suddenly one day his elder brother Duva the Blind was no more. After Duva the Blind died, his four sons looked down on their uncle Dobun, excluded him from the clan, left him and moved away, becoming the [[Dörbet (Choros clan)|Dorben]] clan. After that, one day Dobun Mergen went up on Mount Togotsog Ondor to hunt. In the woods he saw an Uriankhai man roasting the ribs of a recently killed three-year-old deer. Dobun Mergen said: "Friend, let me have a share of the roast." The man said "I will give" and gave him all of the meat except the skin and upper torso with the neck, lungs and heart which he kept for himself. While Dobun was carrying the deer meat back he encountered a poor man leading his son by the hand. Dobun Mergen asked "What manner of man are you?" The man replied "I am Maalig Bayagudai (of the Bayid tribe). I have hit hard times. I'm poor and tired. Give me some of your game meat and I will give you my son in return." At those words Dobun Mergen cut off one of the deer's thighs and gave it to him. He took the man's son, brought him home and made him do chores in the house ([[yurt|ger]]).

Suddenly one day Dobun Mergen was no more. After Dobun Mergen was gone Alan Gua gave birth to three more sons, although she didn't have a husband. Their names were Bukhu Khatagi, Bukhatu Salji and Butunchar Munkhag.}}

==Events of Bodonchar's Life==
The Secret History continues with the following account of Bodonchar's life:
{{quote|Belgunudei and Bugunudei, the two sons previously born from Dobun Mergen, spoke secretly from their mother Alan Gua: "This mother, although she is without a man, has given birth to these three sons. In the house there is only that Maalig Bayagudai person. These three sons must be his." Their mother Alan Gua figured out they were speaking these things in secret. So on one spring day she boiled mutton and had her five sons Belgunudei, Bugunudei, Bukhu Khatagi, Bukhatu Salji and Butunchar Munkhag sit next to each other facing her. She gave each of them a single arrow and said "Break it". They snapped the single arrows easily. Then she gave them five arrows in a bundle and said "Break it". Each of the five tried breaking that bundle of five arrows, taking turns and trying from different angles, but couldn't manage to break it at all. 

Then their mother [[Alan Gua]] said: "You, my two sons Belgunudei and Bugunudei, say I have given birth to these three sons and you are now suspicious and question whose sons they are and where on earth they came from. Your are right in being suspicious. Every night a radiant yellow person used to come in through the opening in the roof of the ger (yurt) or through the space above the ger entrance and caress my belly, his light getting absorbed into my belly. When he left, he left like a yellow dog rising and twisting away along the dividing line of the sun and the moon (at the meeting line of dawn and night). Why do you lightly speak such futile words? If we interpret this sign, it is clear they are sons of Heaven (''Tengri''). Why do you speak of them as if they were commoners? When they become Kings of All (''Khamag-un Khagad''), then will commoners see who they really are!" 

And then [[Alan Gua]] told them a word of wisdom: "You, my five sons, were born from my one womb. If you become separate like those single arrows, you will be easily broken in half by anybody who passes. If you become one union like that bundle of arrows, how will anybody be able to break you easily?" And then suddenly one day their mother Alan Gua was no more.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Haenisch, ''Die Geheime Geschichte der Mongolen'', Leipzig 1948, p. 1-3, 6-7 (= sections 1-22, 43-50). Eleven generations after the grey wolf and the white doe: sections 1-7. Nine generations before Genghis Khan: sections 43-50. Alan Goa's life: sections 5-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

After their mother [[Alan Gua]] died, the brothers divided their property. Four of them, Belgunudei, Bugunudei, Bukhu Khatagi and Bukhatu Salji took shares. They excluded Butunchar from the clan, saying he was stupid and didn't give him any share. Butunchar, seeing he was not counted as ''urag'' (blood relation, member of the clan) said "What's the point of me being here!" and galloped off down the Onon River on his black-speckled white horse with a stripe down its back and a scanty tail saying "If I die, so be it! If I live, so be it!" He rode downstream till he reached Baljun Aral (Baljun Island) where he made a grass tent for himself and settled there. While he was staying there he saw a female brown hawk catch and eat a black pheasant. He plucked some hairs from the tail of his horse, made a snare, caught the hawk and reared it. When he had nothing to eat he shot and killed wild game penned in against a cliff by a pack of wolves or went and collected the scraps left by the wolves, fed his stomach as well as his hawk's and survived the winter that year. 

Spring came. Wild geese and ducks began to arrive and Butunchar after starving his hawk for a while released it, and it caught for him so many geese and ducks that he could not eat them all and hung some of them on a withered tree, where they stayed till they stank. A group of people came to Tunkhelig Stream from the forests on the northern side of Mount Duiren. Butunchar would leave his hawk, go to those people, drink fermented mare's milk during the day and go back to spend the night in his grass tent. Those people asked for his hawk but Butunchar refused to give it to them. Those people never asked Butunchar "Whose son are you? Where are you from?" nor did Butunchar ask them "What people are you?" They simply continued living close to each other. 

Bukhu Khatagi came searching for his younger brother Butunchar Munkhag saying "this one has disappeared down the Onon River". When he asked the people camped at Tunkhelig Stream "Have you seen a person looking like this and this? With a horse like this and this?" they replied "The man and horse are both exactly as you say. He has a hawk. Every day he comes to us to drink fermented mare's milk and goes back. No one knows where he spends the night! Whenever the wind blows from the north-west the feathers of the wild geese and ducks caught by his hawk come whirling down like a snow-storm. He must be close by. Now is almost the time for him to come. Wait just a little bit!" After a short while, a man came up towards Tunkhelig Stream. When he came closer, it was indeed Butunchar. Bukhu Khatagi saw and recognized him and led him back, galloping up the Onon River. Butunchar was trotting behind his elder brother Bukhu Khatagi. He said as he was trotting: "Elder brother! Elder brother! It is good for a body to have a head, for a coat to have a collar." He repeated the same words but his elder brother didn't make anything of it and didn't reply. Butunchar rode on and said the same words again. At this his elder brother said "What are these words you have been muttering all this while?" Butunchar said "Those people camped at the Tunkhelig stream, they have no great and small, no good and bad, no head and feet. They are equal one to the other. An easy people. Let us conquer them."

His elder brother then said: "Alright, if that is the case, when we come home let us hold a meeting of brothers and having agreed, let us conquer those people." They came home, a discussion among brothers was held and they rode off to conquer. They sent Butunchar ahead to reconnoitre as forward scout. Butunchar went as forward scout and caught a woman midway through her pregnancy. He asked "What manner of person are you?" The woman replied "I am a woman of the Jarchuud Adankhan clan of the Uriankhai tribe". The brothers, all five of them, conquered those people and came to enjoy an easier life with a good number of beasts, bread and bondservants (fixed phrase meaning greater prosperity).}}

The account goes on to say that the captured pregnant woman gave birth to her son who became the ancestor of the Jadaran tribe. She also bore a child from Butunchar who was called Baaridai who became ancestor of the Baarin tribe. Butunchar got another wife who came with a proper dowry. The dowry included a female servant who became Butunchar's third wife. Genghis Khan was descended from Khabu Baatar the son of Butunchar's second wife. Jeguredei was the son of the third wife and was later excluded from the tribal sacrifices.

'''Carol Elizabeth Howe'''&lt;ref name=nyttimes1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=splc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2001/false-patriots|title=False Patriots|publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]|date=May 8, 2001|accessdate=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a former informant for the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF). Howe became a key figure in [[Oklahoma City bombing conspiracy theories]] following her claim that she informed authorities of a right-wing extremist plan to blow up a federal building in Oklahoma a few months before the [[Oklahoma City bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2cVdDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg|title=American Terrorist: Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City Bombing|publisher=BookBaby|date=October 31, 2015|first1=Lou|last1=Michel|first2=Dan|last2=Herbeck|authorlink2=Dan Herbeck|isbn=978-0060394073}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/conspiracy_files/6264927.stm|title=Q&amp;A: What really happened|work=[[The Conspiracy Files]]|date=March 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Howe was adopted at birth by a wealthy family in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name=tulsaspeaks/&gt; Upon graduating from Tulsa Metro Christian Academy as an honor student, she lived in several places in the early 1990s, either taking college classes or working a variety of "non-career" type jobs.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/carol-howe-speaks-debutante-to-defendant-and-back-to-mainstream/article_a24a62c0-12f1-5903-83f6-b54ceb0a439c.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fall-in with the radical right  ===
According to [[White Aryan Resistance]] member [[Dennis Mahon]], Howe wrote to him in 1993 with an alleged interest in joining his group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/former-opera-deb-indicted/article_a34fde80-a8b6-51fc-b036-a4e7c63e440e.html|title=Former Opera Deb Indicted|first=David|last= Harper|work=[[Tulsa World]]|date=March 13, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1997/07/23/mcveighs-lawyers-keeping-eye-on-bomb-threat-trial-in-tulsa/b426a9ae-2c51-43e9-8109-242f8495551b/|title=McVeigh's Lawyers Keeping Eye on Bomb Threat Trial in Tulsa|date=July 23, 1997|publisher=|work=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Howe herself claims she became involved with [[white supremacists]] in 1994 after allegedly being injured by a group of African-American men.&lt;ref name=tulsaspeaks&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/carol-howe-speaks-debutante-to-defendant-and-back-to-mainstream/article_a24a62c0-12f1-5903-83f6-b54ceb0a439c.html|title=Carol Howe Speaks // Debutante to Defendant, And Back to Mainstream // Ex-Informant to Testify Today Before Grand Jury|first=David|last=Harper|date=October 8, 1997|work=[[Tulsa World]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Howe's lawyer, Howe then called Dial-A-Racist,&lt;ref name=guardian2001&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/05/mcveigh.usa|title=Conspirators|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=May 5, 2001|first=Jon|last=Ronson|authorlink=Jon Ronson|accessdate=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a local hotline operated by Mahon.&lt;ref name=nyttimes1997&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/02/us/a-spy-on-radical-right-is-acquitted.html|title=A Spy on Radical Right Is Acquitted|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 2, 1997|last=Thomas|first=Jo|accessdate=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her time as a white-separatist, she obtained a swastika tattoo on her shoulder and an Iron Cross on her leg.&lt;ref name=tulsaspeaks/&gt;

==Time at Elohim City==
In 1994, Mahon began taking 24-year-old Carol Howe to the white-separatist enclave in [[Elohim City, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name=nyttimes1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=tulsaspeaks/&gt; While living on the compound for some months, she appeared on German television with Mahon to advocate violence as a means to reach the goal of a racially pure, white society.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.apnews.com/fbf223c198dfc08584b8dfbbc518f0c8&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1994, Carol Howe filed a restraining order against [[Dennis Mahon]]. This attracted her the attention of the ATF, who were already investigating Mahon's radical paramilitary group, [[White Aryan Resistance|W.A.R.]], for suspected violation of federal firearms and conspiracy laws. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=carole_howe_1 | title=Carole Howe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rev. Robert Millar, the founder and spiritual leader of [[Elohim City]], Howe stayed at Elohim City for about six weeks before the Oklahoma City bombing.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/elohim-city-leader-admits-he-provided-fbi-with-information/article_6f9360dd-e479-526d-8c1e-31f45c2eab04.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==ATF informant and Oklahoma City bombing==  
From from August 1994 through March 1995, Howe served as an ATF informant going by the code number CI-183. She was paid $120 a week to monitor the Elohim City compound and wrote monthly reports to her ATF handler, Agent Angela Finley-Graham. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.colorado.edu/gendersarchive1998-2013/1999/06/01/real-edye-icon-edye-smith-oklahoma-city-bombing-and-mobilization-ideologies&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyttimes1997/&gt; Agency officials claim that Howe was deactivated because of mental instability.&lt;ref&gt;https://newsok.com/article/2606055/ex-informant-lying-attorney-claims-grand-jury-hears-from-atf-agent&lt;/ref&gt; Agent Finely-Graham states that Carol Howe was reinstated in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing but did no informant work after June 1995.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/viefhaus-convicted-of-conspiracy/article_9e865e73-b373-5b76-9b1f-a8a9cac8e2d4.html&lt;/ref&gt;


Carol Howe was present at the [[Terry Nichols]] trial, where she testified that she saw [[Timothy McVeigh]] in Elohim City in July 1994 with Andreas Carl Strassmeir and Peter Ward. She also identified John Does #1 and #2 as brothers Pete and Tony Ward, both residents of the compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/mcveigh/howetestimony.html|title=Testimony of Carol Howe in the Terry Nichols Trial|date=December 10, 1997|website=law2.umkc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Richard P. Match refused to allow Howe's testimony in Timothy McVeigh's trial in the Oklahoma City bombing case.&lt;ref name=tulsaspeaks/&gt;

==National Socialist Alliance of Oklahoma==
Sometime after the bombing, Carol Howe (using the name "Freya"), along with her then-fiancee, '''James Dodson Viefhaus Jr.''', formed a white supremacy organization in Tulsa, known as the '''National Socialist Alliance of Oklahoma''', of which they were the only members.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/former-opera-deb-indicted/article_a34fde80-a8b6-51fc-b036-a4e7c63e440e.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

Howe claims that she had set up a white supremacist hot line in 1996 to enhance her cover after federal agents disclosed her identity.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/viefhaus-convicted-of-conspiracy/article_9e865e73-b373-5b76-9b1f-a8a9cac8e2d4.html&lt;/ref&gt; During her trial, she explained to the jury that her life as a white separatist was only done as a pose to gather information as an undercover Government informer.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/03/us/informer-on-radical-right-is-acquitted.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The indictment against Howe and Viefhaus alleges that they possessed ''[[Ragnar Benson|Ragnar's Big Book of Homemade Weapons: Building and Keeping Your Arsenal Secure]]'' and a Department of the Army Technical Manual, ''Improvised Munitions Handbook''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/elohim-city-leader-admits-he-provided-fbi-with-information/article_6f9360dd-e479-526d-8c1e-31f45c2eab04.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8570">'''Cavall''' (Middle {{lang-cy|cauall}} [[Red Book of Hergest|RBH]] &amp; [[White Book of Rhydderch|WBR]]; modernized: Cafall;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|Jones|1993}}, 107, 110, 199&lt;/ref&gt; pronunciation: {{ipa|/kaˈvaɬ/}}; ''{{lang-la|Cabal}}'', var. ''Caball'' (&lt;small&gt;ms.K&lt;/small&gt;))&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mommsen|1898}}, p.217, textual variants note to line 23. The codices used for this portion of the work are CDGHKLQ.&lt;/ref&gt; is the name of [[King Arthur]]'s dog, used in the hunt for the great boar, [[Twrch Trwyth]] ({{lang-la|Troynt, Troit}}).

Cavall was Arthur's "favourite dog", and during a stag hunt, he was customarily the last dog to be let loose to chase after the game (''[[Gereint and Enid|Gereint Son of Erbin]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schreiber|1849}},p.87&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Historia Brittonum''==
[[File:Cavall footprint stone Guest Mabinogion(1849) vol2 p360.png|thumb|Sketch of a footprint stone from Carn Cavall, Lady Guest's ''Mabinogion'' (1849)]]
Legend in antiquity has it that Cabal left his permanent footprint in the rock while pursuing the boar Troynt.  The lore is preserved in the ''[[wikisource:History of the Britons#Wonders of Britain|Wonders of Britain]]'' (''De Mirabilibus Britanniae'' or ''Mirabilia'' in shorthand) appended to ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' (9th century). The wondrous nature of this [[cairn]] of stones was that even if someone removed that footprinted stone to another spot, it would be back at its original heap the next day.

The Latin account has the mark of age, since it refers to Arthur merely as warrior and not king. The full quote in translation is given in the [[Twrch Trwyth#Historia Brittonum|Twrch Trwyth]] (or [[History of the Britons#Wonders of Britain|wikisource]]), but [[Lady Charlotte Guest|Lady Guest]]'s notes might best be consulted, since it provides both the Latin text and translation, as well as commentary on the Carn Cavall as well ({{Harvnb|Schreiber|1849|pp=358–360}}).&lt;ref&gt;Guest's notes also provides a sketch of the footprint (shown right) as well as facsimile of the Latin text from Harley 3859.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culhwch ac Olwen==
{{Further|Twrch Trwyth|Hunting of Twrch Trwyth}}
Unlike the simple primitive lore, the late Welsh romance ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'' weaves a much more intricate tale, naming many dogs besides Cavall in the hunting party, and the [[wiktionary:quarry|quarry]] is no longer just the boar [[Twrch Trwyth]] itself, its seven offspring (with names), and yet another boar named [[Ysgithyrwyn|Yskithyrwyn]] besides.

===Ysgithyrwyn Chief-Boar===
Yskithyrwyn Penbaedd (or [[Ysgithyrwyn|Ysgithyrwyn Chief Boar]]) was yet another boar to be hunted by Arthur's band; its tusk, which needed to be extracted while still alive, being another of the "impossible tasks" (''anoeth''; pl. ''anoethiau'') prescribed by [[Ysbaddaden|Ysbaddaden Chief-Giant]].  This tusk was the tool necessary for shaving the giant to groom him up, him being the father of the bride Olwen.

In ''Culhwch and Olwen'', Arthur's dog Cavall is specifically credited with the slaying of Yskithyrwin (or at least with cornering the beast to its doom). Caw of Prydain who rides Arthur's mare [[Llamrei]] cleaves Yskithyrwyn's head with a hatchet.

Afterwards, "Bedwyr leading Cavall, Arthur's own dog",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schreiber|1849}},p311  / a bedwyr a chauall ki arthur ynyl w ynteu. p.239&lt;/ref&gt; joins the other hunters and dogs to pursue the great boar [[Twrch Trwyth]] and its piglings. But the specific role played by Cavall is not told.

===List of dogs===
The other hounds, which either belonged to Arthur's retinue or were recruited elsewhere, include:
* The two (wolf?) cubs of Gast Rhymhi &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schreiber|1849}},p.266, p 301 / gast rymi p.210, gast rymhi 235&lt;/ref&gt; (two whelps of the bitch Rhymhi),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|Jones}}, p.88,105&lt;/ref&gt; named Gwyddrud and Gwyddneu Astrus&lt;ref&gt;It is somewhat unclear whether these are the proper names of the dogs, but {{Harvnb|Bromwich|Evans|1992}}, ''Culhwch'', p.100, 146n make this identification. The family of wolves reverts back into human form by grace of God, but it is rather a mystery how Culhwch's bridal quest was helped by this.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Aned and Aethelm&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schreiber|1849}},p 290, 316 / "anet ac aethlem", p.227, 246&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|Jones}}, p.100,112&lt;/ref&gt;
* Glas, Glessic, and Gleisad&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schreiber|1849}},p 267,p.291/ "Glas. Gleissic. Clerssac" p.211,p.227&lt;/ref&gt; ( ", Glesig, Gleisad),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|Jones}}, p.89,100&lt;/ref&gt; belonging to the three sons of Cleddyf Kyfwlch, named Bwlch,  Kyfwlch, and Sefwlch.
* Drudwyn,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schreiber|1849}}, p 286, 303,306 / drutywyn, p.225, 236, 237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|Jones}}, p.98,106,110&lt;/ref&gt; the cub of Greid the son of Eri.
* two dogs of Glythmyr Ledewic&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schreiber|1849}}, p.306, 311 / deu gi glythmyr lewic, glythuyr ledewic, letewic, p.238,242,&lt;/ref&gt; ( " of Glythfyr Ledewig).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|Jones}}, p.89,100&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cavall the horse====
It should be pointed out, in reference to the above list of dogs, that Glas, Glesig, and Gleisad are referred to as dogs, and Call, Cuall, and Cafall as horses, and so on down the line, in the list of belongings of sons of Cleddyf, or, at least they are nowadays in modern translations (such as Gwyn &amp; Thomas Jones', 1949 and Jeffrey Gantz's, 1976). However, in the first English translation by Lady Guest, Glas, etc. were construed as sword names and Call, Cuall, Cavall as dogs, respectively.

==Etymology==
[[Ifor Williams]] has made a study of occurrences of Cafall in old Welsh poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bromwhich|Evans|1992}}, p.153, notes that Ifor Williams has studied "..instances of cafall &lt; Lat. caballus..in the ''Hengerdd''(old poetry) CA 1203; CLlH vii, 22a; PT 38n. on ''caffon''.(Ifor Williams, CA=''Canu Aneirin'', 1938; CLlH=''Canu Llywarch Hen'', 1935; PT=''Poems of Taliesin'')&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars seem to hit upon the similarity of the dog's name to the Latin word for "horse". In an article from 1936, R. J. Thomas said "that the name Cabal is from Latin ''caballus'' 'horse', which he considers a quite natural metaphor since the dog was strong and swift, and he compares the horse of Conall Cernach which had a dog's head".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Ford|first=Patrick K. |title=On the Significance of some Arthurian Names in Welsh|journal=Bulletin of the Board of Celtic Studies|volume=30|year=1982|page=268|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GoNnAAAAMAAJ|format=snippet}}, summarizing from R. J. Thomas, "Cysylltiad Arthur a Gogledd Cymru", BBCS viii (1936), 124-5)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bromwich further remarks, "Since ''carn'' means both 'hoof' and 'cairn' it seems more probable that ''Cabal/Cafall'' originally designated Arthur horse.. rather than his hound." &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bromwich|Evans|1992}}, p.153&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Askins, Jr.''' (October 28, 1907 – March 2, 1999), also known as Col. Charles "Boots" Askins, was an American lawman, [[US Army]] officer, and writer.&lt;ref name=Ayoob/&gt;  He served in law enforcement ([[US Forest Service]] and [[United States Border Patrol|Border Patrol]]) in the [[American Southwest]] prior to the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taffin|first=John|authorlink=John Taffin|title=Old warriors - Campfire Tales|journal= Guns Magazine|year =2003|volume=33|issue=8|accessdate=2011-04-13|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_8_49/ai_103381607/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Askins was the son of Major [[Askins Charles Senior (writer)|Charles "Bobo" Askins]], a sports writer and Army officer who served in the [[Spanish–American War]] and [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Ken |last=Warner |title=Gun Digest 1995 |page=141|publisher= DBI Books |year= 1994 |location= Iola, WI|isbn=978-0-87349-157-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Askins served in the US Army during World War II as a battlefield recovery officer, making landings in North Africa, Italy, and on [[D-day]].&lt;ref name=ss/&gt; After World War II, he spent several years in Spain as an attache to the American embassy there, helping Franco rebuild Spain's munition plants.&lt;ref name=ss/&gt; After his assignment in Spain, he was reassigned to Vietnam, where he trained South Vietnamese soldiers in shooting and airborne operations.  Throughout his military career, he indulged in big game hunting at every opportunity, and continued to do so after his retirement.&lt;ref name=Ayoob&gt;{{cite book|first= Massad |last= Ayoob|authorlink=Massad Ayoob|title=The Gunfights of Col. Charles Askins |pages=60–65|journal=American Handgunner|year= 1999 |issue= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He held several big game hunting records in his lifetime, as well as two national pistol championships, an American Handgunner of the Year award, and innumerable smaller titles in competitive shooting.&lt;ref name=menke/&gt;  Askins retired to San Antonio, Texas after his final years in the military at Fort Sam Houston.&lt;ref name=ss&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skelton|first=Skeeter|authorlink=Skeeter Skelton|title=The Legend Of Charley Askins|journal=Shooting Times Magazine|issue=5|volume=26|year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Askins, like his father, was a prolific writer, writing books and over 1,000 magazine articles on subjects related to hunting and shooting.&lt;ref name=ss/&gt;  His writing career spanned 70 years, from 1929 until his death in 1999.&lt;ref name=Ayoob/&gt;

==Legacy==
Askins was controversial for the relish with which he described the numerous fatal shootings in his law enforcement and military careers, stating he had killed 27 men.&lt;ref name=Ayoob/&gt;&lt;ref name=migra&gt;{{cite book|first= Kelly Lytle |last= Hernandez |title=Migra!: a History of the U.S. Border Patrol |publisher=University of California Press|pages=62–65|volume=29|year= 2010 |isbn=978-0-520-26641-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because he was involved in numerous shootouts along the US/Mexico border, and due to his stated practice of not keeping track of African-Americans and Hispanics, the actual number of killings he committed was potentially much higher.&lt;ref name=Ayoob/&gt;  Askins once remarked that he thought he was a psychopathic killer, and that he hunted animals so avidly because he was not allowed to hunt men anymore.&lt;ref name=Ayoob/&gt;  Askins was a contemporary of [[Bill Jordan (Marine)|Bill Jordan]],  [[Elmer Keith]], [[Skeeter Skelton]], and [[Jack O'Connor (American writer)|Jack O'Connor]].&lt;ref name=Ayoob/&gt;  These people, except for Skelton, as well as Askins, [[Audie Murphy]], and [[Ed McGivern]], were used as inspiration for characters in the [[Stephen Hunter]] novel ''[[Pale Horse Coming]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Stephen  |last= Hunter |authorlink=Stephen Hunter|title=Pale Horse Coming |page=595|publisher= Simon and Schuster|year= 2008 |location= NY|ISBN=978-1-4165-9364-5  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Arichat, Nova Scotia]], of [[Acadian]] descent, and educated there. In 1845, he married Charlotte Forest. He was first elected to the provincial assembly in an 1874 by-election held after [[Edmund Power Flynn]] was elected to the House of Commons. In 1878, Boudroit was named to the province's [[Legislative Council of Nova Scotia|Legislative Council]]. He died in Liscomb, [[Guysborough County, Nova Scotia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21864">A '''civilian''' is "a person who is not a member of the [[military]] or of a [[police]] or [[Firefighter|firefighting force]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/civilian|title=Civilian|publisher=Merriam-Webster|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120113852/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/civilian|archivedate=2018-01-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "civilian" is slightly different from a [[non-combatant]] under the [[law of war]], as some non-combatants are not civilians (for example, [[military chaplain]]s attached to the [[belligerent]] [[armed forces]] or [[Country neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] [[military personnel]]). Under [[international law]], civilians in the territories of a party to an armed conflict are entitled to certain privileges under the [[customary international law|customary laws of war]] and [[Treaty|international treaties]] such as the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]]. The privileges that they enjoy under international law depends on whether the conflict is an internal one (a [[civil war]]) or an international one.

==Etymology==
The word "civilian" goes back to the late 14th century and is from [[Old French]] ''civilien'', "of the civil law". Civilian is believed to have been used to refer to non-combatants as early as 1829. The term "non-combatant" now refers to people in general who are not taking part of hostilities, rather than just civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/etymology/civilian|title=the definition of civilian|author=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203010848/http://dictionary.reference.com/etymology/civilian|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal usage==
The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] 1958 Commentary on [[GCIV|1949 Geneva Convention IV Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War]] states: "Every person in enemy hands must have some status under [[international law]]: he is either a [[prisoner of war]] and, as such, covered by the [[Third Geneva Convention|Third Convention]], a civilian covered by the Fourth Convention, or again, a member of the [[combat medic|medical personnel]] of the armed forces who is covered by the [[First Geneva Convention|First Convention]]. There is no intermediate status; nobody in enemy hands can be outside the law. We feel that this is a satisfactory solution – not only satisfying to the mind, but also, and above all, satisfactory from the humanitarian point of view."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Pictet]] (ed.) – [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600007?OpenDocument ''Commentary on Geneva Convention IV Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War'' (1958)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712154409/http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600007?OpenDocument |date=2007-07-12 }}, p. 51. 1994 reprint edition.&lt;/ref&gt; The ICRC has expressed the opinion that "If civilians directly engage in hostilities, they are considered '[[unlawful combatant|unlawful' or 'unprivileged' combatants or belligerents]] (the treaties of humanitarian law do not expressly contain these terms). They may be prosecuted under the domestic law of the detaining state for such action."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/terrorism-ihl-210705 The relevance of IHL in the context of terrorism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129070740/http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/terrorism-ihl-210705 |date=2006-11-29 }} official statement by the ICRC 21 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Article 50 of the [[Protocol I|1977 Protocol I Additional to the Geneva Conventions]],
"1. A civilian is any person who does not belong to one of the categories of persons referred to in Article 4A(1), (2), (3) and (6) of the Third Convention and in Article 43 of this Protocol. In case of doubt whether a person is a civilian, that person shall be considered to be a civilian.
2. The civilian population comprises all persons who are civilians.
3. The presence within the civilian population of individuals who do not come within the definition of civilians does not deprive the population of its civilian character."
The definition is negative and defines civilians as persons who do not belong to definite categories. The categories of persons mentioned in Article 4A(1), (2), (3) and (6) of the Third Convention and in Article 43 of the Protocol I are combatants. Therefore, the Commentary to the Protocol pointed that, any one who is not a member of the armed forces is a civilian. Civilians cannot take part in armed conflict. Civilians are given protection under the Geneva Conventions and Protocols thereto.
Article 51 describes the protection that must be given to the civilian population and individual civilians. Chapter III of Protocol I regulates the targeting of civilian objects. Article 8(2)(b)(i) of the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] also includes this in its list of war crimes: "Intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population as such or against individual civilians not taking part in hostilities". Not all states have ratified 1977 Protocol I or the 1998 Rome Statute, but it is an accepted principle of international humanitarian law that the direct targeting of civilians is a breach of the customary laws of war and is binding on all [[belligerents]].

==Civilians in modern conflicts==
The actual position of the civilian in modern war remains problematic.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Slim, ''Killing Civilians: Method, Madness and Morality in War'', Hurst, London, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It is complicated by a number of phenomena, including:
* the fact that many modern wars are essentially [[civil war]]s, in which the application of the laws of war is often difficult, and in which the distinction between combatants and civilians is particularly hard to maintain;
* [[guerrilla warfare]] and [[terrorism]], both of which tend to involve combatants assuming the appearance of civilians;
* the growth of doctrines of "effects-based war", under which there is less focus on attacking enemy combatants than on undermining the enemy regime's sources of power, which may include apparently civilian objects such as electrical power stations; and
* the use of "[[lawfare]]", a term that refers to attempts to discredit the enemy by making its forces appear to be in violation of the laws of war, for example by attacking civilians who had been deliberately used as [[human shield]]s.

Starting in the 1980s, it was often claimed that 90 percent of the victims of modern wars were civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Kahnert, M., D. Pitt, et al., Eds. (1983). ''Children and War: Proceedings of Symposium at Siuntio Baths, Finland, 1983.'' Geneva and Helsinki, [[Geneva International Peace Research Institute]], IPB and Peace Union of Finland, p. 5, which states: "Of the human victims in the First World War only 5% were civilians, in the Second World War already 50%, in Vietnam War between 50 - 90% and according to some information in Lebanon 97%. It has been appraised that in a conventional war in Europe up to 99% of the victims would be civilians."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Graça Machel]], [http://www.unicef.org/graca/a51-306_en.pdf "The Impact of Armed Conflict on Children'',  Report of the expert of the Secretary-General, 26 Aug 1996, p. 9.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723152322/http://www.unicef.org/graca/a51-306_en.pdf |date=2009-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Kaldor]], [https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;id=XVgVstFi0XUC&amp;dq=mary+kaldor&amp;q=90+per+cent#v=snippet&amp;q=90%20per%20cent&amp;f=false ''New and Old Wars: Organized Violence in a Global Era'', Polity Press, Cambridge, 1999, p. 107.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Zinn]], Moises Samam, Gino Strada. ''Just war'', Charta, 2005, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The claim was repeated on [[Wikipedia:Did you know|Wikipedia's Did You Know]] on 14 December 2010. These claims, though widely believed, are not supported by detailed examination of the evidence, particularly that relating to wars (such as those in [[Yugoslav Wars|former Yugoslavia]] and in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]]) that are central to the claims.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]], [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00396338.2010.494880 "Lives and Statistics: Are 90% of War Victims Civilians?", ''Survival'', London, vol. 52, no. 3, June–July 2010, pp. 115–35.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205010559/http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00396338.2010.494880 |date=2017-02-05 }} Print edition ISSN 0039-6338.

In the opening years of the twenty-first century, despite the many problems associated with it, the legal category of the civilian has been the subject of considerable attention in public discourse, in the media and at the United Nations, and in justification of certain uses of armed force to protect endangered populations. It has "lost none of its political, legal and moral salience."&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]], "The Civilian in Modern War", ''Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law'', vol. 12, T.M.C. Asser Press, The Hague, 2010, pp. 13–51. {{ISBN|978-90-6704-335-9}}; ISSN 1389-1359. One part of this article, relating to casualties, also appeared in ''Survival'', June–July 2010, as footnoted above.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is often assumed that civilians are essentially passive onlookers of war, sometimes they have active roles in conflicts. These may be quasi-military, as when in November 1975 the Moroccan government organized the "[[green march]]" of civilians to cross the border into the former Spanish colony of [[Western Sahara]] to claim the territory for Morocco - all at the same time as Moroccan forces entered the territory clandestinely.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Brownlie, ''African Boundaries: A Legal and Diplomatic Encyclopaedia'', C. Hurst, London, for Royal Institute of International Affairs, pp. 149-59 gives a useful account of the background and origin of the dispute over Western Sahara.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, and without necessarily calling into question their status as non-combatants, civilians sometimes take part in campaigns of [[civil resistance|nonviolent civil resistance]] as a means of opposing dictatorial rule or foreign occupation: sometimes such campaigns happen at the same time as armed conflicts or guerrilla insurrections, but they are usually distinct from them as regards both their organization and participation.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the chapters on the anti-Marcos movement in the Philippines (by Amado Mendoza) and on resistance against apartheid in South Africa (by Tom Lodge) in [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present'', Oxford University Press, 2009 [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s], pp. 179-96 and 213-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Officials directly involved in the maiming of civilians are conducting offensive military operations and do not qualify as civilians.

== Civilian Protection under International Humanitarian Law (IHL) ==
The [[International humanitarian law|International Humanitarian Law]] codifies treaties and conventions, signed and enforced by participating states, which serve to protect civilians during intra and interstate conflict. Even for non-treaty participants, it is customary for international law to still apply.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/8F686F64C1565B094925762E0019587D-Full_Report.pdf|title=IHL Primer #1 - What is IHL?|last=|first=|date=July 2009|website=|publisher=International Humanitarian Law Research Initiative|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171211160940/https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/8F686F64C1565B094925762E0019587D-Full_Report.pdf|archive-date=2017-12-11|dead-url=no|access-date=November 11, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the IHL adheres to the principles of [[Distinction (law)|distinction]], [[Proportionality (law)|proportionality]], and [[Necessity (criminal law)|necessity]]; which apply to the protection of civilians in armed conflict.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although, despite the UN deploying military and civilians to protect civilians it lacks formal policies or military manuals addressing exactly these efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Impossible Mandate?

Stimson Center|year=2006|isbn=9780977002306|location=|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN Security Council Report No 4: Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict provides further evidence of the need for protection of civilians. Recognizing that large-scale civilian insecurity threatens international peace and stability, the UN aims to establish the means of protecting civilians and thereby work to ensure regional stability.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bergholm|first=Linnea|date=May 2010|title=The African Union, the United Nations and Civilian Protection Challenges in Darfur|url=https://www.rsc.ox.ac.uk/files/files-1/wp63-au-un-civilian-protection-challenges-darfur-2010.pdf|journal=Refugee Studies Centre Working Paper Series|volume=Paper No. 63|pages=14|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502164228/https://www.rsc.ox.ac.uk/files/files-1/wp63-au-un-civilian-protection-challenges-darfur-2010.pdf|archivedate=2018-05-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the UN Security Council Report No 4, first published in 2008, the UN offers ways to support civilian protections in both intra and interstate conflict with a goal of encouraging regional states to police their own conflicts (such as the African Union policing African conflicts).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Similarly, the UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] reminded UN Member states that they have common interests in protecting African civilians through a shared “commitments to human security, and its rationale of indivisibility of peace and security.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bergholm|first=Linnea|date=May 2010|title=The African Union, the United Nations and Civilian Protection Challenges in Darfur|url=https://www.rsc.ox.ac.uk/files/files-1/wp63-au-un-civilian-protection-challenges-darfur-2010.pdf|journal=Refugee Studies Centre Working Paper Series|volume=Paper No. 63|pages=17|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502164228/https://www.rsc.ox.ac.uk/files/files-1/wp63-au-un-civilian-protection-challenges-darfur-2010.pdf|archivedate=2018-05-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through a series of resolutions (1265, 1296, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1502|1502]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1674|1674]], &amp; 1738) and  presidential statements the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] “addresses: 
* compliance with international humanitarian law and relevant human rights law, accountability for violations and humanitarian access;
* the role of UN peacekeeping operations or other UN mandated missions;
* protection of specific groups;
* the impact of small arms; and
* regional cooperation.
The Security Council is now involved in the protection of civilians in five main areas of action.
* It reinforces general norms—in particular the rules of international humanitarian law.
* It uses its Chapter VII powers to mandate either UN peacekeeping missions or regional organizations or groups of member states to take measures including the use of force to protect civilians.
* It can develop middle ground using its Chapter V, VI and VIII powers to influence parties to conflict in country-specific situations to observe protection norms.
* It uses its Chapter VI powers to try to prevent or limit the outbreak of armed conflict through mediation and other initiatives.
* Finally, the Council can hold parties accountable for violations of international humanitarian law by imposing targeted measures, establishing commissions of inquiry, authorizing ad hoc tribunals or referring situations to the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC).”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
In response to Presidential statements and previous subcommittee work, the UN Security Council held a meeting in January 2009, specifically to address the protection of civilians within the context of the IHL.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/research-reports/lookup-c-glKWLeMTIsG-b-5556213.php|title=UN Security Council Report No 4: Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While no specific outcome followed this meeting, it did lead to the production of a 10-year assessment of Council actions since the passing of resolution 1265 in 1999.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In addition to the UN treaties, regional treaties have also been established, such as the African Union Constitutive Act Article 4(h) which also outlines the protection of civilians and  “affords the Union a right to forcibly intervene in one of its member states in ‘grave circumstances’, namely war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bergholm|first=Linnea|date=May 2010|title=The African Union, the United Nations and Civilian Protection Challenges in Darfur|url=https://www.rsc.ox.ac.uk/files/files-1/wp63-au-un-civilian-protection-challenges-darfur-2010.pdf|journal=Refugee Studies Centre Working Paper Series|volume=Paper No. 63|pages=8|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502164228/https://www.rsc.ox.ac.uk/files/files-1/wp63-au-un-civilian-protection-challenges-darfur-2010.pdf|archivedate=2018-05-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is proposed to indicate the African Union will no longer stand by to watch atrocities happen within the Union. As described by [[Said Djinnit]] (AU’s Commissioner for Peace and Security) in 2004, “Africans cannot [...] watch the tragedies developing in the continent and say it is the UN’s responsibility or somebody else’s responsibility. We have moved from the concept of non-interference to non-indifference.

Regardless of the lead organization (UN, AU, other) “there is clearly a risk involved for international organizations that in assuming a complicated security role such as civilian protection, they may raise expectations among local populations that cannot be met, usually not even by large-scale peace operations with a comprehensive political component, supported by high force levels, overall professionalism, and the political stamina to stay present long-term. The disappointing outcomes, in Africa and elsewhere, have led some to criticize the way in which the decentralization policies have been implemented (MacFarlane and Weiss 1992; Berman 1998; Boulden 2003).”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bergholm|first=Linnea|date=May 2010|title=The African Union, the United Nations and Civilian Protection Challenges in Darfur|url=https://www.rsc.ox.ac.uk/files/files-1/wp63-au-un-civilian-protection-challenges-darfur-2010.pdf|journal=Refugee Studies Centre Working Paper Series|volume=Paper No. 63|pages=11|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502164228/https://www.rsc.ox.ac.uk/files/files-1/wp63-au-un-civilian-protection-challenges-darfur-2010.pdf|archivedate=2018-05-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Pendleton Oakerhater''' (b. ca. 1847, d. August 31, 1931), also known as '''O-kuh-ha-tuh''' and '''Making Medicine''', was a [[Cheyenne]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] warrior and spiritual leader, who became an artist and Episcopal deacon.  Imprisoned in 1875 after the Indian Wars at [[Fort Marion]] (now Castillo de San Marcos), Florida, Oakerhater became one of the founding figures of modern Native American art. Later he was [[ordination|ordained]] as a [[deacon]] in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] and worked as a missionary in [[Oklahoma]].  In 1985, Oakerhater was the first Native American Anglican to be included in the book of Lesser Feasts and Fasts of the Episcopal Church.

==Early life==
Born in the 1840s in the [[Indian Territory]] (later the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oklahoma]]) to Sleeping Wolf (father), and ''Wah Nach'' (mother), Oakerhater was the second of three boys.  His childhood name was ''Noksowist'' ("Bear Going Straight"), and he was raised as a traditional Cheyenne.  His older brother was Little Medicine, and his younger brother was Wolf Tongue.&lt;ref name=warst&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Oakerhater/bio.html|publisher=Oklahoma State University|title=From Warrior to Saint: The life of David Pendelton Oakerhater|author=K.B. Kueteman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oakerhater is believed by some to have been the youngest man to complete the [[sun dance]] ritual (his Cheyenne name, ''Okuh hatuh'', means "sun dancer").&lt;ref name=okstate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/O/OA001.html |publisher=Oklahoma State University |title=Oakerhater, David Pendleton |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107064914/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/O/OA001.html |archivedate=2007-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He participated in his first war party ([[Raid (military)|military raid]]) at age 14 against the [[Otoe tribe|Otoe]] and [[Missouri tribe]]s,&lt;ref name=warst/&gt; and became a member of his tribe's "Bowstring Society" (one of five military societies).&lt;ref name=warst/&gt;  He later participated in actions against United States federal and state [[militia]] forces.  His first engagement with white settlers was at the [[Second Battle of Adobe Walls]], in which 300 Native American warriors from various tribes, angered by settlers' poaching of buffalo, cattle grazing, and theft of horses, attacked a small trading village used by poachers.&lt;ref name=warst/&gt;   The battle, led by [[Comanche]] leader ''[[Isa-tai]]'' and Chief [[Quanah Parker]], triggered United States government response in the form of the [[Red River War]] of 1874-75.  Oakerhater may also have participated in the [[Battle of Washita River]] and the [[Sand Creek massacre]].&lt;ref name=okstate/&gt;

Oakerhater married ''Nomee'' (translated as "Thunder Woman") in 1872.  She died in 1880.  They had four children, all of whom died young.  Oakerhater also married, had at least one child, and divorced, a second woman, ''Nanessan'' ("Taking Off Dress").&lt;ref name=warst/&gt;

==Fort Marion prisoner==
[[File:Castillo de San Marcos Fort Panorama 5.jpg|thumb|left|500px|The courtyard at Fort Marion]]
In the [[Red River War]] of 1874 and 1875, the United States government attempted to pacify Native American warriors on the Southern Plains, fighting a series of skirmishes until the militants were exhausted by lack of food and supplies. The warriors, including Oakerhater, surrendered in 1875 at [[Fort Sill]] near what is now [[Lawton, Oklahoma]].  A group of 74 were selected from there and another location, all without trial, for imprisonment in Florida.  Oakerhater was in a group chosen for being the eighteen farthest right in a line-up by a [[United States Army|US Army]] colonel who had been drinking and was running out of time before nightfall.  Some among the eighteen had nothing to do with the insurrection.

The army assigned First Lieutenant (later Captain) [[Richard Henry Pratt]] to transport the prisoners to an old Spanish fort, the [[Castillo de San Marcos]] (then known as Fort Marion), near [[Saint Augustine, Florida|Saint Augustine]].  Shackled together, they were taken across country on foot, by wagon, train (most had never before seen a train), and steamboat.&lt;ref name=warst/&gt; Many initially thought they would be executed.  At least two attempted suicide; one was later shot and killed attempting to escape, and another died of pneumonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/regional_review/vol5-6c.htm|publisher=the Regional Review (United States National Park Service)|title=Indian Prisoner-Students at Fort Marion: The Founding of Carlisle Was Dreamed in St. Augustine|author=Hilton Crowe|date=December 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Pratt supported [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of American Indians into European-American mainstream society.  He thought they needed to abandon their cultures and religions and learn the various practices of America's [[dominant culture|dominant white culture]] to survive: English, wage work, Christianity, literacy, mainstream education, and so on.  The practice of forced assimilation, now criticized as [[cultural genocide]], was considered progressive by its practitioners of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalosoldier.net/CaptainRichardH.Pratt.htm|publisher=Buffalo Soldier|title=Captain Richard Henry Pratt, 10th Cavalry Buffalo Soldiers, Founder of the Carlisle School for Indian Students: His Motto, "Kill the Indian, save the man"|author=Stanford L. Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many European-Americans considered Native Americans to be enemies and murderers who should be killed, imprisoned, or defeated through force.  Pratt's superior, General [[Philip Sheridan]], dismissed Pratt's beliefs as "Indian twaddle".&lt;ref name=warst/&gt;

Conditions at the old fort were initially very poor: prisoners slept on the floor of their cells facing a central open-air courtyard. Several died in the first weeks.&lt;ref name=warst/&gt; Pratt quickly improved conditions, obtaining army uniforms, removing the prisoners' shackles, setting them to work building a new residential shed, and procuring bedding.  Later, as trust developed on both sides, Pratt convinced his superiors to allow the Indians to carry nonoperational rifles, perform guard duty, obtain outside employment collecting and selling [[Drift seed|sea beans]] and other tourist items, have passes to visit the town on Sundays to attend church, and camp unsupervised on nearby [[Anastasia Island]].&lt;ref name=warst/&gt;

Pratt, who offered to resign his military post if the experiment failed, appointed Oakerhater First Sergeant of the prisoners, with a duty to organize morning [[military drill]]s, ensure hygiene and dress code, choose assistants for Captain Pratt, and oversee the prisoners in Pratt's absence.  Pratt and his wife also arranged for volunteer teachers who were vacationing in Florida from across the United States to instruct the prisoners in English, carpentry, and other subjects.  They allowed the Indians to conduct a mock buffalo hunt.&lt;ref name=wdafm&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a7MnikuSHBEC&amp;dq=%22%22Indian+Prisoners+and+Ladies+Archery+Club%22&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0|title=War Dance at Fort Marion:Plains Indian War Prisoners|author=Brad D. Lookingbill|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2006|isbn=0-8061-3739-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In return the prisoners educated townspeople and tourists in archery, and made handicrafts and drawings to sell.  Aware for their part of the nature of Pratt's experiment, the prisoners took pride in their work and martial discipline, eager to demonstrate that they could master white Americans' cultural and military practices.  They took longer to overcome other cultural barriers, such as discomfort with being taught by women.  The first summer Pratt arranged for their families to visit them from the Indian Territory.  Within two years of arrival at Fort Marion, Oakerhater was proficient in English, and was regularly writing letters to townspeople he had befriended.  That year nineteen of the prisoners were released, in exchange for accepting scholarships for education on the East Coast.&lt;ref name=warst/&gt;

===Ledger art===
[[File:Making medicine.portrait.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Self-portrait with horse, ca. 1875]]
One of Pratt's experiments was to provide art supplies and instruction to the prisoners.  They drew most of their art in pen in [[Ledger|ledger books]]. Somewhat abstract in style and depicting nostalgic memories of scenes from daily life, their art drew inspiration from earlier [[Plains Indian hide painting]], which included personal narratives and [[winter counts]], calendar chronicles of tribal events. Typical subjects included community dances, hunts, courting, and events at the fort, as well as self-portraits depicting scenes before their imprisonment. The [[ledger art]] was a popular item for tourists to purchase. Through his art, Oakerhater gained the attention of Mrs. Alice Key Pendleton, to whose daughter he had given one of his drawing books.&lt;ref name=warst/&gt;

Oakerhater was the first and one of the most prolific, artists in the group. Oakerhater's drawings are considered by critics to be sophisticated in composition and subject content.  These artworks are highly collectible today. He often signed his works "Making Medicine," a non-literal English translation of his [[Cheyenne language|Cheyenne]] name, Sun Dancer, which the military had assigned him upon his arrest.&lt;ref name=warst/&gt; Other times he would sign with a [[glyph]] of a dancer in a sun dance lodge to represent himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter from David Pendleton Oakerhater to Mrs. Mary Burnham, September 2, 1881 |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Oakerhater/Letters/DPO06141878.html |publisher=Oklahoma State University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906212017/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Oakerhater/Letters/DPO06141878.html |archivedate=2008-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Smithsonian Institution has a collection of the Fort Marion artists online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmnh.si.edu/naa/kiowa/ft_marion.htm "Fort Marion Artists"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014144116/http://www.nmnh.si.edu/naa/kiowa/ft_marion.htm |date=2008-10-14 }}, Smithsonian Institution, accessed 4 Dec 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Episcopal affiliation==
In 1877 an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] [[deaconess]], Mary Douglass Burnham, began to make arrangements to sponsor the remaining prisoners, including Oakerhater, to serve as church sextons and continue education. In April 1878 all of the prisoners were released.  Burnham arranged funding from Alice Key Pendleton and her husband, [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[George H. Pendleton]], to bring Oakerhater, as well as his wife Nomee, to St. Paul's Church in [[Paris, New York|Paris Hill, New York]], along with three other ex-prisoners who each had separate sponsors.&lt;ref name=warst/&gt;  The church's priest, Reverend J.B. Wicks, took charge of Oakerhater's education on matters of agriculture, [[Scripture]], and current events, and welcomed him as part of his family. Oakerhater, along with his three companions from Fort Marion, became popular among townspeople. They made and sold various items, including handmade bows. Within six months Oakerhater agreed to be [[baptism|baptized]] and was [[confirmation|confirmed]] shortly after. He chose the biblical [[Christian name]] [[David]] and adopted the last name Pendleton in honor of his sponsors.&lt;ref name=warst/&gt;
In 1878, Oakerhater was baptized at Grace Episcopal Church in Syracuse and ordained a deacon at that same church in 1881.
Captain Pratt, encouraged by the success of his former prisoners at Paris Hill and some at Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute for Negroes (now [[Hampton University]]), lobbied the federal government for funds to open schools for Indian children. Senator Pendleton pushed a bill through [[United States Congress|Congress]] to found the first school in 1879 at the unused Carlisle Barracks in central [[Pennsylvania]]. It was named the [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]].
[[File:Oak.family.ParisHill.GraveSML.jpg|thumb|
Prior to the 2005 celebration at Grace Church in Syracuse, NY, O-kuh-ha-tah descendants (great-great grandson, Jack Southmeth; granddaughter Elizabeth Whiteshield; great-granddaughter Kim Whiteshield; and great-great granddaughter Star Whiteshield) travelled to St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Paris Hill (near Utica) to visit O-kuh-ha-tah’s home church and the graves of their ancestors.

In July, 1880 Nomee died in childbirth.  The next year Oakerhater's young son Pawwahnee died.  Both were buried in the cemetery in Paris Hill.  Oakerhater was ordained an Episcopal deacon in July, 1881.&lt;ref name=warst/&gt; According to sources, O-kuh-ha-tah’s son, Frederick; wife, Millie; and another child, who died at birth, are buried in the church cemetery in Paris Hill, New York.

===Missionary===
[[File:Oakerhater.deacon.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Oakerhater (right) as a missionary in Oklahoma]]

After Oakerhater was ordained a deacon, Pratt sent him on a trip to Indian Territory and [[Dakota Territory]] to recruit students for Carlisle, where Pratt had been appointed [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]].  Traveling with Reverend Wicks to the Darlington Agency near what is now [[El Reno, Oklahoma]], Oakerhater used his connections and influence to encourage local Cheyenne to attend Episcopal religious services.  Remaining in the area, he traveled to the Anadarko Agency (near present-day [[Anadarko, Oklahoma]]) for Sunday services, spending weekdays visiting and caring for ill members of various tribes.&lt;ref name=warst/&gt;

In 1882 Oakerhater married Nahepo (Smoking Woman), who adopted the English name Susie Pendleton.  They had two children, who both died young.  Nahepo died in 1890, at age 23.&lt;ref name=warst/&gt;

In 1887 Oakerhater began work at newly built missions in [[Bridgeport, Oklahoma|Bridgeport]], and in 1889 at the Whirlwind Mission near [[Fay, Oklahoma|Fay]], seventeen miles west of [[Watonga, Oklahoma]].  The mission, built in 1887, was on the [[Dawes Act]] allotment land of Chief Whirlwind, one of the negotiators of the [[Treaty of Medicine Lodge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traveltotourism.com/pages/city.php?Watonga&amp;Oklahoma&amp;City_ID=OK0603034&amp;VA=Y&amp;Attraction_ID=OK0603034a013|title=Whirlwind Cemetery and David Pendleton (O-kuh-ha-tah):God's Warrior|year=1985|author=Lois Clark|publisher=State of Oklahoma}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As at other Indian schools being established in the United States, many of Whirlwind's students suffered from poverty and related diseases.  Many suffered from [[trachoma]] and [[conjunctivitis]].

Their parents, whose lives had been disrupted by colonialism, warfare, forcible relocation, and the breaking up of tribal lands for allotment, were exploited by local non-Indians who wanted to profit from their newly assigned land grants.  Uprooted, the families would often camp out near the schools to be with their children and provide a safer environment.  Oakerhater's school and mission were under pressure both from locals, who saw the mission as a threat to their attempts to exploit the Native American population, and from others at the local and national level, who deplored the poor conditions there.&lt;ref name=warst/&gt;

Oakerhater retired from Whilrwind with a [[pension]] in 1918 but continued to preach, serving as a Native American chief and holy man.&lt;ref name=window&gt;{{cite web|author=Anne E. Rowland|url=http://www.stgeorgeohio.org/Stainedglass/oakerhater.htm|publisher=St. George's Church of Dayton, Ohio|title=David Oakerhater Window}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He moved briefly to [[Clinton, Oklahoma]] and then to [[Watonga, Oklahoma|Watonga]], where he lived until his death in 1931.&lt;ref name=warst/&gt;

===Saint===
[[File:Oakerhater.window.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Oakerhater Window, St. Paul's Cathedral, by Preston Singletary]]
After Oakerhater died, the Episcopal Church did not sponsor significant mission work in Watonga, Oklahoma for more than thirty years.  In the early 1960s, an Episcopalian family that had moved to the area placed an ad in a local paper to announce a meeting in their home.  Native Americans who had known Oakerhater met with the family and worked with them to revive his old mission.&lt;ref name=window/&gt;

In 1985 the Episcopal Church designated Oakerhater as a [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|saint]], thanks in part to the years of work and research by Lois Carter Clark, a [[Creek (people)|Muscogee Creek]] scholar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Oakerhater/about.html Anderson, Cokie G. "From Warrior to Saint: The Journey of St. David Pendleton Oakerhater", ''Oklahoma State Digital Library.'' 2006] (retrieved 26 Jan 09)&lt;/ref&gt; On September 1, 1986, the first feast was held in his honor at the [[Washington National Cathedral]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], with his descendants and delegations from Oklahoma invited to the celebration.  In 2000 the Saint George Church of [[Dayton, Ohio]] dedicated a large [[stained glass window]] in its chapel depicting Oakerhater, and a smaller window bearing his glyph signature.&lt;ref name=window/&gt;

[http://stpaulsokc.org/ St. Paul's Cathedral] in Oklahoma City dedicated a chapel to St. Oakerhater. The congregation of St. Paul's commissioned [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] glass artist, [[Preston Singletary]], to create a stained glass window featuring Oakerhater's glyph.  It replaced a church window destroyed in the 1995 [[Oklahoma City bombing]].  The Oakerhater Guild of St. Paul's was organized in partnership with Whirlwind Mission of the Holy Family and sponsors dances, tribal outreach, and a vacation Bible school for children in [[Watonga, Oklahoma|Watonga]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://stpaulsokc.org/content/view/62/62/ "St. Oakerhater Guild." ''St. Paul's Cathedral.'' 2009] (retrieved 26 Jan 09)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 the Whirlwind Church obtained at a new permanent site in Watonga, where it dedicated the Oakerhater Episcopal Center in September 2007.&lt;ref name=ded&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=Daily Oklahoman|url=http://newsok.com/article/3115092/1188605880|author=Carla Hinton|date=2007-09-01|title=Oakerhater Center dedication set for Sept. 8 in Watonga}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The site is used for [[powwow]]s, a [[sweat lodge]], classes, and an annual Cherokee Dance in Oakerhater's honor.&lt;ref name=warst/&gt;&lt;ref name=ded/&gt;

Grace Episcopal Church in Syracuse, NY is a national shrine to Saint O-kuh-ha-tah. On Saturday, April 16, 2005, a Native American Celebration was held there to honor Cheyenne Saint David Pendleton Oakerhater (O-kuh-ha-tah/Making Medicine), the first Native American saint of the Episcopal Church, and Oneida Marcia Pierce Steele, teacher of both Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) cultural traditions and Christian beliefs. Grace Church’s celebration included a day-long cultural festival, followed by holy eucharist and a blessing of new memorial stained-glass windows.  Roberta Whiteshield-Butler, great-granddaughter of O-kuh-ha-tah, created the drawings for the windows. Rose Viviano of Rose Colored Glass fabricated the windows which were installed in September 2004 and blessed by Bishop Adams at the April 2005 celebration. Saint O-kuh-ha-tah’s descendants travelled from Oklahoma and Texas to attend the celebration at Grace Episcopal Church in Syracuse, New York. Prior to the celebration, O-kuh-ha-tah descendants (great-great grandson, Jack Southmeth; granddaughter Elizabeth Whiteshield; great-granddaughter Kim Whiteshield; and great-great granddaughter Starr Whiteshield) travelled to St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Paris Hill (near Utica) to visit O-kuh-ha-tah’s home church and the graves of their ancestors.

'''Ebtisam al Saegh''' is a human rights defender from [[Bahrain]] with the organisation SALAM for Democracy and Human Rights (SALAM DHR).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/profile/ebtisam-al-saegh|title=EBTISAM AL-SAEGH|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is considered a "vital human rights advocate" at a time when freedom of expression is increasingly dangerous in Bahrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ifex.org/bahrain/2017/07/05/ebtesam-alsaegh-detained/|title=Rights advocate Ebtesam al-Saegh lawlessly detained for second time in as many months|last=|first=|date=6 July 2017|website=ifex.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arrests and torture ==
In November 2016  al Saegh was questioned by authorities under suspicion of “inciting hatred against the Bahraini regime” and “threatening public safety and security” for posts she had made on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/case/ebtisam-al-saegh-arrested-abused-prison|title=Ebtisam Al-Saegh Arrested, Abused in Prison|last=|first=|date=|website=Front Line Defenders|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, [[Amnesty International]] documented the arrest, torture, including sexual assault, of Ebtisam al-Saegh at the Bahrain's [[National Security Agency (Bahrain)|National Security Agency]] (NSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/07/bahrain-woman-human-rights-defender-at-high-risk-of-torture-including-sexual-assault/|title=Bahrain: Woman human rights defender at high risk of torture, including sexual assault|last=|first=|date=4 July 2017|website=https://www.amnesty.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When al-Saegh was detained in May 2017, she was physically and sexually abused, and received threats to murder her and her children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ifex.org/bahrain/2017/07/05/ebtesam-alsaegh-detained/|title=Rights advocate Ebtesam al-Saegh lawlessly detained for second time in as many months|last=|first=|date=6 July 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was told by the officers involved in her torture that she was being targeted because she was a human rights defender and that her perpetrators were from Bahrain's NSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ifex.org/bahrain/2017/07/05/ebtesam-alsaegh-detained/|title=Rights advocate Ebtesam al-Saegh lawlessly detained for second time in as many months|last=|first=|date=|website=ifex.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 July 2017, Ebtisam al-Saegh tweeted about the ill treatment of women at the hands of the NSA and held the King of Bahrain responsible for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/07/bahrain-woman-human-rights-defender-at-high-risk-of-torture-including-sexual-assault/|title=Bahrain: Woman human rights defender at high risk of torture, including sexual assault|last=|first=|date=|website=amnesty.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of 3–4 July 2017, al Seagh was detained at approximately 11:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time by state security forces. According to Amnesty International, around 25 officers claiming to belong to the Criminal Investigation Directorate arrived at her house in five civilian cars and a minibus without an arrest warrant.

Her whereabouts are unknown and the fear is she will face the same or worse treatment this time.

== International reaction ==
Amnesty International and Bahraini democracy advocates based in Britain and the US expressed concern for her safety.The Bahrain Centre for Human Rights called for her immediate release and of all nonviolent activists and detainees held arbitrarily due to their human rights work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ifex.org/bahrain/2017/07/27/rights-activist-charged/|title=Bahraini rights activist Ebtisam Al-Saegh charged under anti-terrorism law|last=|first=|date=27 July 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samah Hadid, director for Amnesty International campaigns in the Middle East, criticised the basis of the arrest. She said, "the Bahraini authorities must immediately and unconditionally release Ebtisam al-Saegh, whose only crime is speaking up against a government committed to crushing all forms of dissent.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/International/Fears-mount-for-detained-Bahraini-human-rights-activist-498914|title=FEARS MOUNT FOR DETAINED BAHRAINI HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST|last=|first=|date=6 July 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, the press office of Bahrain’s embassy in London wrote that Bahrain is “firmly committed to the protection and safeguarding of human rights” and has oversight bodies to safeguard them and independently investigate violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/International/Fears-mount-for-detained-Bahraini-human-rights-activist-498914|title=FEARS MOUNT FOR DETAINED BAHRAINI HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST|last=|first=|date=July 6, 2017|website=https://www.jpost.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Clark''' (August 15, 1822 – January 6, 1902) was an American architect who served as [[Architect of the Capitol]] from 1865 to 1902.

==Life and career==
Clark was born in August 1822 in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], to James and Mary ({{nee}} Cottman) Clark. His grandfather, Michael Clark, was of [[English people|English]] stock from [[Lancashire]], [[England]] but born in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]]. Michael Clark emigrated to the United States at the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]] to avoid anti-[[Catholic Church|Catholic]] persecution in England. Edward Clark's father, James, was one of Michael's three sons, and was not only an architect in Philadelphia but a well-known teacher of architectural drawing.  Edward Clark's mother, Mary, was the daughter of John Cottman, a captain in the Pennsylvania Regiment during the American Revolution.&lt;ref name=AIAobit&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chapter Notes|journal=The American Institute of Architects Quarterly Bulletin|date=April 1902|pages=17–18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NyEbAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=edward%20clark%20philadelphia%201822%20%22Architect%20of%20the%20Capitol%22&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q=edward%20clark%20philadelphia%201822%20%22Architect%20of%20the%20Capitol%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=September 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward Clark was educated in both public and private schools in Philadelphia.  He received his architectural training from his uncle, Thomas Clark, who was an [[engineer]] in the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]].  He received training in architectural and free-hand drawing from his father.&lt;ref name=AIAobit /&gt;

While still in his late teens, Clark was apprenticed to the nationally known Philadelphia architect [[Thomas U. Walter]]. While an apprentice, he helped Walter design and plan the buildings for [[Girard College]]. In 1851, Walter was appointed the Architect of the Capitol and charged with designing and building the [[United States Capitol dome]] and the north ([[United States Senate|Senate]]) and south ([[United States House of Representatives|House]]) wings of the [[United States Capitol]]. Clark accompanied Walter to Washington, D.C., and was Walter's chief assistant on the three projects. Although Walter was author of the general plan and layout of the dome wings, nearly all the detail work was done by Clark.&lt;ref name=obit /&gt; While architectural and planning work progressed on the dome in the 1850s, Clark also assisted Walter in completing the [[Old Patent Office Building|U.S. Patent Office Building]] and the [[General Post Office (Washington, D.C.)|D.C. General Post Office building]].&lt;ref name=AIAobit /&gt;

During the [[American Civil War]], Clark also designed and oversaw the construction of numerous arsenals, forts, and hospitals in the Washington, D.C., area.&lt;ref name=obit /&gt;

Clark was appointed Capitol architect by President [[Andrew Johnson]] upon his mentor's resignation on August 30, 1865, and completed the extension project in 1868.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Clark introduced many technological improvements to the Capitol, including electricity, steam heat, and elevators.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} During Clark's tenure, the Capitol Grounds were greatly enlarged and [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], the greatest [[landscape architect]] of the day, was commissioned to design the grounds and terraces.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Also during Clark's administration, the Library of Congress moved to its own building, and the west central interior of the Capitol was reconstructed.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In 1872, Clark was hired by the state of [[Iowa]] to revise plans for the [[Iowa State Capitol]], whose original design had proven too costly to build. Clark retained the general plan of the building, and (working closely with original co-designer [[Alfred H. Piquenard]]), revised the plans. It was Clark's building which was eventually constructed.&lt;ref name=AIAobit /&gt;

==Personal life and death==
Edward Clark loved literature, and owned one of the largest private libraries in the city at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=obit /&gt;  Although not a musician himself, he also loved music and had one of the largest private music libraries in the region. He spoke [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Latin]], and his library contained a large number of works in architecture written in those languages.&lt;ref name=obit /&gt; An ardent art admirer, he was a close friend of [[William Wilson Corcoran]], who founded the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]].&lt;ref name=obit /&gt; Clark sat on the Corcoran Gallery's board of trustees since its founding, and at the time of his death was the longest-serving trustee.&lt;ref name=AIAobit /&gt;

Clark was a member of the Clarendon Historical Society of [[Edinburgh]], the [[American Institute of Architects]],&lt;ref name=AIAobit /&gt; the Archeological Institute of America, the American Institute for the Advancement of Science, the [[Franklin Institute]], the [[American Forestry Association]], and the [[Washington Monument|Washington Monument Society]].&lt;ref name=obit /&gt;

Clark married Evelyn F. Freeman of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], in 1860.&lt;ref name=obit /&gt; She was a descendant of Sir Edward Freeman, one of the first settlers of [[Cape Cod]].&lt;ref name=evelyn&gt;{{cite news|title=Architect Clark's Wife Dead|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=December 9, 1896|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had two sons, Edward and Watson, and twin daughters, Eveline and Charlotte.&lt;ref name=obit /&gt; Evelyn Clark died in 1896.&lt;ref name=evelyn /&gt;

Clark was enfeebled by old age in the last two years of his life. He died on January 6, 1902, at his home in Washington, D.C., of an undisclosed illness from which he had suffered for several weeks.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|title=Edward Clark Dead|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 7, 1902|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]], he was buried at [[Rock Creek Cemetery]] in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Funeral of Mr. Clark|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 9, 1902|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emmanuel Rukundo''' (born 1 December 1959) is a [[Rwanda]]n [[Roman Catholic]] priest who in 2009 was convicted of [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR) for his participation in the [[1994 Rwandan Genocide]].

Rukundo was born in [[Kabgayi]], [[Gitarama Province]], Rwanda. He was ordained a priest in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in 1991. In 1993, he became a [[chaplain]] in the Rwandan military.

Rukundo was also head to the St. Leon Minor Seminary in the Gitarama at the time of the 1994 Genocide. According to findings by the ICTR, he ordered [[Hutu]] soldiers to abduct and murder [[Tutsi]] refugees who were seeking shelter at St. Leon's. Rukundo was also found guilty of personally sexually assaulting a young Tutsi woman.

Following the genocide, Rukundo fled to [[Switzerland]], where he was granted asylum as a refugee. He was arrested by Swiss officials in July 2001 after a warrant for his arrest was issued by the ICTR. Rukundo fought his extradition in the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]], but his case was dismissed and on 20 September 2001 he was sent to [[Arusha]], [[Tanzania]], to stand trial before the ICTR.

Rukundo's trial began on 15 November 2006 and was completed in February 2008. In February 2009, the Trial Chamber of the ICTR found him guilty of one count of [[genocide]] and multiple counts of [[murder]] as a [[crime against humanity]]. The Trial Chamber sentenced him to 25 years' imprisonment, but it was reduced to 23 years' imprisonment in October 2010.

In July 2016, Rukundo requested early release from prison to the ICTR due to rehabilitation, and in December 2016, was released from prison in Mali alongside [[Ferdinand Nahimana]], having served 16 of the 23 years of his sentence.

'''Eric Rofes''' (August 31, 1954 &amp;ndash; June 26, 2006) was a [[gay]] [[activism|activist]], educator, and author who wrote or edited 12 books.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Eric Rofes was born on August 31, 1954 and grew up in [[Commack, New York]]. He graduated from [[Harvard University]] and went on to receive a master's degree from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1995 as well as a doctorate in social and cultural studies in 1998.&lt;ref name="postobit"&gt;{{Cite news |date=July 8, 2006 |title=Eric RofesGay Activist, Author |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/07/AR2006070701326.html |periodical=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=2007-10-26 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
He was appointed to the White House Conference on the Family in 1980. He became director of the [[Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center]] in the 1980s. In 1989, he became executive director of the [[Shanti Project]], a nonprofit AIDS service organization in [[San Francisco]]. He resigned in 1993, following an audit that questioned how the group had spent federal funds.

In 1998, while doing his PhD at [[UC Berkeley]], Rofes wrote ''[[Dry Bones Breathe: Gay Men Creating Post-AIDS Identities and Cultures]]'', in which he argued that the AIDS crisis had passed and gay men needed to free themselves from the sense of emergency and victimhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/29/us/29rofes.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=Eric Rofes, Commentator on Gay Issues, Dies at 51 | first=Douglas | last=Martin | date=June 29, 2006 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in [[The Nation]] described ''Dry Bones Breathe'' as "perhaps the most important book about gay male culture and community of the past decade." However, the book has also been castigated for only limning the experiences of 'middle-class, urban, white, gay men' instead of being more societally inclusive.&lt;ref&gt;[[Journal of Homosexuality]], volume 53, issue 3, 'Gay Activism and Scholarship from the Front Lines: Contributions of Eric Rofes – A Memoriam' by Donald C. Barrett&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a professor of Education at [[Humboldt State University]] in [[Arcata, California]], and served on the board of the [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]] and [[White Crane Institute]]. One of the last projects he worked on was the creation, with [[Chris Bartlett (activist)|Chris Bartlett]], of a series of "Gay Men's Health Leadership Academies" to combat what he saw as a "pathology-focused understanding of gay men" in safe-sex education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitecranejournal.com/66/art6605.asp "Gay Bodies, Gay Selves: Understanding the Gay Men’s Health Movement"] [[White Crane (magazine)|White Crane]] #66&lt;/ref&gt;  These workshops have continued as a continuation of his legacy.

===Death===
He was living in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], working on his 13th book when he died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/06/28/BAGOEJLFC11.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Eric Rofes -- scholar, educator, gay men's health activist | first=Wyatt | last=Buchanan | date=June 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
Humboldt State established the Eric Rofes Center after his death as a new program in honor of his legacy and to continue his work in queer-feminist activism.  The Eric Rofes Multicultural Queer Resource center is a student-run, student-funded initiative that provides programming and resources for Humboldt State University's LGBTQIA community.  It is located in Warren House #53 on campus.

[[File:Harvey Pratt.JPG|thumb|Artist Harvey Pratt]]
'''Harvey Phillip Pratt''' (born 1941) is an [[Americans|American]] [[forensic artist]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[artist]], who has worked for over forty years in law enforcement, completing thousands of composite drawings and hundreds of [[soft tissue]] [[postmortem]] reconstructions.&lt;ref name=OSBI&gt;OSBI Forensic Art&lt;/ref&gt;  To this end, his work has assisted in thousands of arrests and hundreds of identification of unidentified human remains throughout America.&lt;ref name=OSBI/&gt; His expertise in witness description drawing, skull reconstruction, skull tracing, age progression, soft tissue postmortem drawing and restoration of photographs and videos have aided law enforcement agencies both nationally and internationally.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;Brown&lt;/ref&gt;  Pratt also assists investigations though training classes, besides lecturing before universities, colleges, schools and civic groups. In the early 2000's Pratt teamed up with [[David Paulides]] in researching [[Bigfoot]] on the Hoopa Reservation in California, as well as in his home state of Oklahoma.

==Life==
Pratt was born in [[El Reno, Oklahoma]] and is a member of the [[Cheyenne]] &amp; [[Arapaho]] tribes where he is recognized as one of the traditional Cheyenne Peace Chiefs,&lt;ref name=McDonnell&gt;McDonnell&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the [[Council of Forty-Four]]. He has been recognized by the Cheyenne People as an Outstanding Southern Cheyenne.&lt;ref name=Lester&gt;Lester, p. 446&lt;/ref&gt; He is the great grandson of scout, guide, interpreter and [[Sand Creek massacre]] survivor, [[Edmund Guerrier]].&lt;ref&gt;National Archives #368 Edward Guerrier&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the great great grandson of American frontiersman, [[William Bent]].&lt;ref&gt;National Archives #367 Julia Bent Guerrier&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt lives in [[Guthrie, Oklahoma]].

==Forensic Art==
[[File:Postmortem Drawing by Harvey Pratt.jpg|right|thumb|400pxl|Example of Postmortem Drawing by Harvey Pratt, of the [[Sumter County Does|Sumter County Jane Doe]], who has remained unidentified since 1976.]]

Pratt began his career with Oklahoma's Midwest City Police Department in 1965, where, as a police officer, he completed his first composite drawing that resulted in an arrest and conviction.&lt;ref name=McDonnell/&gt; He joined the [[Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation]] in 1972 as a narcotics investigator and retired in 1992 as an Assistant Director.&lt;ref name=McDonnell/&gt; He is now employed with the agency as a full-time forensic specialist.&lt;ref name=OSBI/&gt;

Pratt's forensic expertise has contributed to many high-profile cases: The [[Green River Killer]] (Gary Ridgeway),&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith &amp; Guillen, reconstruction credit in photo section&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oklahoma Girl Scout Murders]] (Gene Leroy Hart),&lt;ref name=Wilkerson&gt;Wilkerson &amp; Wilkerson&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Lee Lucas]] and [[Ottis Toole]],&lt;ref name=OSBI/&gt; [[Bobby Joe Long]],&lt;ref name=OSBI/&gt; [[The I-5 Killer]] (Randall Woodfield),&lt;ref name=OSBI/&gt; [[Ward and Fontenot|Tommy Ward and Karl Fontenot]],&lt;ref name=Mayer&gt;Mayer, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tommy Lynn Sells]],&lt;ref name=Fanning&gt;Fanning, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Trade Center 1993 bombings]],&lt;ref name=OSBI/&gt; [[Ted Bundy]],&lt;ref name=McDonnell/&gt; Sirloin Stockade Murders (Roger Dale Stafford, Verna Stafford and Harold Stafford),&lt;ref name=English&gt;English &amp; Calhoun, pp. 400-401&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Fischer,&lt;ref name=OSBI/&gt; [[Roger Wheeler (businessman)|Roger Wheeler]] murder,&lt;ref name=Fossett&gt;Fossett&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] of the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]],&lt;ref name=OSBI/&gt; [[Donald Eugene Webb]],&lt;ref name=OSBI/&gt; Oklahoma State Fair Abducted Girls (Roy Russell Long),&lt;ref name=OSBI/&gt; and [[Randolph Dial]].&lt;ref name=McDonnell/&gt;

In the mid 1980s, Pratt developed the [[soft tissue postmortem drawing]] method.&lt;ref name=Stott&gt;Stott&lt;/ref&gt; Using this method, the forensic artist draws or paints on the photograph of a victim to repair tissue damage or decomposition. The drawing repairs the trauma to the victim so that the final image will be more presentable when asking for law enforcement's or the public's assistance in identification.

==Native American Art==
Pratt encompasses painting, sculpting, wood carving, mural painting, bronze work, architectural design and graphic design.&lt;ref name=Pratt&gt;Pratt&lt;/ref&gt; He is a self-taught artist and creates in the media of oil, acrylic, watercolor, metal, clay and wood.&lt;ref name=Pratt/&gt; His artwork is a blend of his forensic art and law enforcement experience with traditional Native American environment.

Pratt has received awards for his artwork at Inter-Tribal Indian Ceremonials, [[Gallup, New Mexico]], and [[Red Earth Festival]], [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name=Lester/&gt;  In 2005, he was given the title "Master Artist" by Red Earth, as well as being selected as the ''Red Earth 2005 Honored One''.&lt;ref name=McDonnell/&gt;

His works are in many permanent collections, including the [[National Park Service]], the [[Smithsonian Institution]],&lt;ref name=Lester/&gt; the Sequoyah National Research Center, and the [[University of Oklahoma]].  He accepted state appointments to the Oklahoma Arts Council by Governor [[Frank Keating]] and Governor [[Brad Henry]].&lt;ref name=McDonnell/&gt;

==Bigfoot Forensics &amp; Artwork==
Pratt provided forensic artwork for [[David Paulides]] in the books Tribal Bigfoot and The Hoopa Project. Through extensive research, interviews and travels, Pratt produced dozens of forensic sketches from witnesses that David Paulides and himself met in California and his home state of Oklahoma. Pratt also has an online store on his own personal website where he sells [[bigfoot]] artwork.

'''Hayranidil Kadın''' ({{lang-ota|خیراندل قادین}}; 21 November 1846 – 26 November 1895), meaning 'The excellent heart',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=|last=|title=A Gyre Thro' the Orient|publisher=Republican Book and Job Printing Office|year=1869|pages=62|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the second wife of Sultan [[Abdülaziz]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

==Early life==
Of Circassian origin, Hayranıdil Kadın was born on 21 November 1846 in [[Kars]], [[Caucasus]].{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=88}}

==Marriage==
Hayranıdil married Abdülaziz in 1861 in the Dolmabahçe Palace, after his accession to the throne. She was given the title of "Ikinci Kadın".{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=232}} Five years after the marriage, on 25 February 1866, she gave birth to her first child, a daughter, Nazıma Sultan,{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=235}} and two years later on 29 May 1868, she gave birth to her second child, a son, Şehzade Abdulmejid (future Caliph [[Abdulmejid II]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Elsie|title=A Biographical Dictionary of Albanian History|publisher=A Biographical Dictionary of Albanian History|year=2013|pages=3|isbn=978-1-780-76431-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hayranıdil was celebrated as the most beautiful woman of the imperial household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Çelik|last=Gülersoy|title=Dolmabahçe Palace and it's environs|publisher=İstanbul Kitaplığı|year=1990|pages=131|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born as '''Jill Crowe''' in London, England in 1929, the only child of Olive Marjorie Crowe (born 1901), an American nurse, and Cyril F. Johnston (1884–1950),&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt; a British bellfounder and clockmaker whose family firm, [[Gillett &amp; Johnston]], created the carillon of [[Riverside Church]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of Gillett &amp; Johnston |publisher=Gillett &amp; Johnston |url=http://www.gillettjohnston.co.uk/History.aspx |accessdate=December 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carol Hurd Green 2000, page 235"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jill Johnston, ''Mother Bound: Autobiography in Search of a Father'', Alfred A. Knopf, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The birth name of '''Jill Crowe''' is given on the 16 October 1929 passenger manifest of the Homeric, accessed on ancestry.com. The manifest states that Jill Crowe was travelling with her mother, Olive Crowe, a nurse.&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents, who never married, separated when their daughter was an infant, and Johnston's mother took her to Little Neck, Long Island, New York, where she was raised.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;

After attending college in Massachusetts and Minnesota, Johnston received an [[Master of Fine Arts|M.F.A.]] from the [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]].

==Career==

For many years beginning in 1959 and during the 1960s, Johnston was the dance critic for ''[[The Village Voice]]'', the weekly downtown newspaper for [[New York City]]. She was friendly with many performers, performance artists, composers, poets and artists in [[New York City]] especially during the 1960s and 1970s. During the late 1960s [[Deborah Jowitt]] joined the paper and wrote a regular dance column for ''the Voice'', while Johnston's dance column became a kind of weekly diary, chronicling her adventures in the New York art world.&lt;ref name="Jowitt"/&gt;

Johnston was a member of a 1971 New York City panel produced by Shirley Broughton as part of the "Theater for Ideas" series. The event was a vigorous debate on feminism with [[Norman Mailer]], author; [[Germaine Greer]], author; [[Diana Trilling]], literary critic; and [[Jacqueline Ceballos]], [[National Organization for Women]] president. The event was also billed as an intellectual "Battle of the Sexes" – effectively promoting Mailer's then-just-published,  feminism-critical book ''Prisoner of Sex'' (1971).  In the middle of this jam-packed event, Johnston came onstage with two feminist friends. Johnston read a poem, after which the three women simulated (fully dressed) three-way lesbian sex &lt;ref name="Fastenburg"/&gt; (indulging in a bit of feminist [[Guerilla theatre]], which she admitted she had learned from the [[Yippies]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Karla Jay]], ''Tales of the Lavender Menace: A Memoir of Liberation'', p. 231, Basic Books, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;) and quickly exited. Despite this colorful interruption, Greer and Mailer continued to exchange verbal blows with each other (and the audience) for the remainder of the 3½ hour event. This event was widely written about (since so many writers were in attendance, including [[Susan Sontag]] and [[Cynthia Ozick]]) and filmed by the now-legendary documentary filmmaker [[D.A. Pennebaker]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://phfilms.com/films/town-bloody-hall/#credits "''Town Bloody Hall'' | Pennebaker Hegedus Films"]. phfilms.com. Retrieved 2017-04-01.&lt;/ref&gt; eventually becoming the cult-documentary titled ''[[Town Bloody Hall]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|id=0217853|title=Town Bloody Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ICkDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128-IA23&amp;lpg=PA128-IA23&amp;dq=marcia+cohen+%22the+sisterhood%22+jill+johnston+town+hall+debate&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WcJCuZ8g2P&amp;sig=z6tBFsNpUjhKyNL_tmO234xHN5g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-gaP2lfPXAhUl04MKHd0TCUAQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=marcia%20cohen%20%22the%20sisterhood%22%20jill%20johnston%20town%20hall%20debate&amp;f=false|title=The Sisterhood : The Inside Story of the Women's Movement and the Leaders who made it Happen|author=Marcia Cohen|publisher=Simon and Schuster|date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://therumpus.net/2012/01/town-bloody-hall-mailer-greer-forty-years-later/|title=TOWN BLOODY HALL: MAILER &amp; GREER FORTY YEARS LATER|website=The Rumpus.net|author=Reich, James|access-date=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As this incident illustrates, Johnston's self-described "east west flower child beat hip [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] paradise now love peace do your own thing approach to the revolution" (as she called it in [[Lesbian Nation]]) often confounded her feminist allies as much as it did the conservative foes of gay and lesbian liberation. In 1973, she predicted [[wikiquote:Jill Johnston|"an end to the catastrophic brotherhood and a return to the former glory and wise equanimity of the matriarchies."]]

As recorded in ''[[Lesbian Nation]]'', Johnston often was at the center of controversies within the feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s. She famously went on record stating that "all women are lesbians except those that don't know it yet."&lt;ref name="Fastenburg"/&gt;

Johnston was also one of the first countercultural and lesbian writers at ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' magazine, eventually coming to the conclusion that the magazine was too mainstream, ultimately presenting feminism as palatable, family-friendly and safe. According to author [[Vivian Gornick]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For radical feminists like me, [[Ellen Willis]], and Jill Johnston, we had a different kind of magazine in mind. We came out against marriage and motherhood. [[Gloria Steinem]] was uptown; we were downtown. She hung out with Establishment figures; we had only ourselves. It very quickly became obvious at that first meeting that they wanted a glossy that would appeal to the women who read the ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]''. We didn't want that, so they walked away with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/ms-magazine-2011-11/|title=How Do You Spell Ms.: An Oral History of Ms. Magazine|website=New York Magazine|author=Abigail Pogrebin|access-date=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On another occasion, Johnston grew bored at a poolside press conference given by feminist [[Betty Friedan]], and so decided to strip off her top and take a swim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bb1kkyv9e5wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=jill%20johnston&amp;f=false|title=Life So Far: A Memoir|author=[[Betty Friedan]]|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|page=236|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Johnson became an associate of the [[Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press]] (WIFP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wifp.org/who-we-are/associates/|title=Associates {{!}}  The Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press|website=www.wifp.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media.

Johnston's career as a dance critic was hampered by the controversy that attended the publication of ''[[Lesbian Nation]]'' and the publicity engendered by her dramatic style of lesbian feminist activism.&lt;ref name="Jowitt"/&gt; She remained with ''[[The Village Voice]]'' until 1981 and subsequently wrote freelance art and literary criticism. Along with the political memoirs, ''[[Lesbian Nation]]'' and ''Gullible's Travels'', Johnston published an anthology of dance criticism entitled ''Marmalade Me''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jill-johnston-2/marmalade-me/|title=Marmalade Me by Jill Johnston|website=Kirkus Reviews|date=January 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the autobiographies ''Mother Bound'' and ''Paper Daughter''.

Described by one critic as "part [[Gertrude Stein]], part [[E. E. Cummings]], with a dash of [[Jack Kerouac]] thrown for good measure," Johnston's freeform, fluid writing style of the 1970s matched the colorful nature of the tales recounted in her books ''[[Lesbian Nation]]'' and ''Gullibles Travels''. Her later work as a literary and [[art critic]] for ''[[Art in America]]'' and the ''[[New York Times Review of Books]]'' is more standard in tone and content. Early writing not collected in other volumes can be found in ''Admission Accomplished'' while the critical biography ''[[Jasper Johns]]'' represents an example of her later style.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;

Johnston is the subject of one of [[Andy Warhol]]'s portrait films, ''Jill'', a 4½-minute silent movie shot in black and white (1963).&lt;ref name="BAM2014"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bam150years.blogspot.com/2014/11/whos-who-of-warhols-unseen-films.html |title=Who's Who of Warhol's Unseen Films |author= |authorlink= |date=November 4, 2014 |publisher=[[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] |work=BAM150years.blogspot.com |accessdate=September 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1958 Johnston married Richard John Lanham, whom she divorced in 1964. They had two children, a son, Richard Renault Lanham, and a daughter, Winifred Brooke Lanham.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frances C. Locher and Ann Evory, ''Contemporary Authors'', Volumes 53-56, The Gale Group, 1975, page 320&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, in Denmark, she married Ingrid Nyeboe. The couple married again, in Connecticut, in 2009.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;

He guest-hosted a special episode of ''[[Double Dare (Nickelodeon game show)|Super Sloppy Double Dare]]'' in 1989 where host [[Marc Summers]] and announcer [[Harvey (announcer)|Harvey]] played against each other. The game ended with both Summers and Harvey playing the Obstacle Course and winning all eight prizes for their respective civilian teammates. Stage assistants Robin Marrella and Dave Shikiar guest-announced that episode.

After ''ALF'' went off the air in 1990, Bullock remained active with [[theatre]], [[television]], and [[film]] work. He briefly hosted a syndicated [[talk show]] with ex-[[televangelist]] [[Tammy Faye Messner]]. The ''Jim J. and Tammy Faye Show'' debuted in 1996, but Messner exited the program a few months later following a cancer diagnosis. Bullock continued with new co-host, Ann Abernathy, and the show became ''The Jim J. and Ann Show'' until it was canceled.

Bullock was the voice of ''[[Queer Duck]]'' in the animated series of cartoons of the same name which have appeared on both the [[internet]] and the cable TV network [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. In 2000, Bullock was a regular panelist on the revival of ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''. He also performed on the national tour of the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]'' as Wilbur Turnblad, a role he took to the Broadway stage starting September 18, 2007. Some of his other noteworthy roles include the pilled-up narcoleptic Prince [[Valium]] in the 1987 [[Mel Brooks]] movie ''[[Spaceballs]]'', and the "Not-Quite-Out-of-the-Closet" character in the date montage at the beginning of 2001's ''[[Kissing Jessica Stein]]''. From 2004 to 2007, he had a recurring role as Mr. Monroe, a teacher at the fictional James K. Polk Middle School on the [[Nickelodeon]] live action sitcom ''[[Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide]]''.

==Personal life==
In 1985, while ''Too Close For Comfort'' was being retooled as ''The Ted Knight Show'', Bullock learned that he was [[HIV]] positive. In a 1985 appearance on the game show ''[[Body Language (game show)|Body Language]]'', host [[Tom Kennedy (television presenter)|Tom Kennedy]] described him as looking "like you're in the pink of health and all of that," to which a flustered Bullock responded "I'm, I'm...no, I'm about to die, actually. But let's not talk about that now, OK? Fabulous." Kennedy then remarked that "If you've got about four days left in you, we'll make it till Thursday," and Bullock replied, "I've got four days, yeah."{{cn|date=January 2017}}

In 1996, Bullock's partner of six years, John Casey, died from [[AIDS]]-related complications.&lt;ref name=desert_sun_20110123/&gt;&lt;ref name=advocate_19990720/&gt;  Bullock is a longtime survivor of the virus and, as of 2011, was still healthy due in part to [[antiretroviral drug]]s.&lt;ref name=desert_sun_20110123/&gt;&lt;ref name=usatoday_20010606&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/spotlight/2001-06-06-bullock-aids.htm| newspaper=[[USA Today]]| first=Mike| last=Falcon| title=Jim J.

'''John Augustus Roebling''' (born '''Johann August Röbling'''; June 12, 1806 – July 22, 1869) was a German-born American [[Civil Engineering|civil engineer]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He designed and built [[wire rope]] [[suspension bridge]]s, in particular the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], which has been designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] and a [[National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark]].
{{TOC limit|2}}

==Education==
At first John attended the [[Gymnasium (school)#Germany|gymnasium]] in [[Mühlhausen]]. John was born to Friederike Dorothea Röbling (née Muelleren) and Christoph Polykarpus Röbling. Recognizing his intelligence at a young age, Roebling's mother arranged for him to be tutored in mathematics and science at [[Erfurt]] by Ephraim Salomon Unger.&lt;ref&gt;Caso, Frank. [http://www.immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=37 "John Augustus Roebling."] In ''Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present'', vol. 2, edited by William J. Hausman. German Historical Institute. Last modified May 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He went to Erfurt when he was 15. In 1824 he passed his Surveyor's examination and returned home for a year. In 1824 he enrolled for two semesters at the Bauakademie in Berlin, where he studied [[architecture]] and [[engineering]] under Martin Friedrich Rabe (1765–1856), bridge construction and foundation construction under Johann Friedrich Dietlein (1782–1837), [[hydraulics]] under Johann Albert Eytelwein (1764–1848), and languages. Roebling also attended lectures of the philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Roebling developed an interest in natural philosophy and many years later he worked on a 1000-page treatise about his own concepts of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Roebling, Washington A., ''Washington Roebling's Father'', 2008, ASCE Press, Reston VA&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1825 Roebling got a government job at [[Arnsberg]], Westphalia, working on military road building for four years. During this period he made sketches for suspension bridges. In 1829 he returned to his home to work out his final thesis and prepare for his second engineer examination. For unknown reasons, he never took the examination.&lt;ref&gt;Güntherroth, Nele, ''Roebling's Development to Being an Engineer'', 2006, Proceedings John A Roebling Symposium, ASCE, Reston VA&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
On May 22, 1831, Roebling left Prussia with his brother Carl and [[Johann Adolphus Etzler]], who believed in a technological [[utopia]], and a group of emigrants. Engineers had difficulty advancing and achieving economic mobility in Prussian society. The [[Napoleonic Wars]], which lasted until 1815, had suppressed investment in infrastructure. During this period, [[Prussia]] had political unrest, as authoritarian governments took the places of democratic ones. Etzler had ideas about creating a utopia in the United States, but disputes arose en route, and the group split up. John and Carl purchased 1582 acres (6.4&amp;nbsp;km²) of land on October 28, 1831, in [[Butler County, Pennsylvania]]&lt;ref&gt;''Historic Saxonburg and Its Neighbors'', Ralph Goldinger, {{ISBN|1-55856-043-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the intent to establish a German settlement, to be called [[Saxonburg, Pennsylvania|Saxonburg]]. Most of the other settlers had remained with Etzler.  The [[John Roebling House]] at Saxonburg was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brooklyn Bridge by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Brooklyn Bridge]]]]

When the Roeblings and others arrived, the United States was in the later stages of an economic boom, which ended in the [[Panic of 1837]]. Farmers were deeply affected by it. By the 1840s, many Americans believed in the nation's [[manifest destiny]] to extend its borders and achieve greatness. Transportation between eastern industrial hubs and frontier farming markets had become a matter of both national and popular interest. Many railway and transportation projects were underway near the site which Roebling chose for his colony, but instead of continuing in the engineering profession, he took up farming.  After five years he married Johanna Herting, a tailor's daughter.

He found agrarian work unsatisfying, and the colony attracted very few settlers. In 1837, after the death of his brother Carl and the birth of his first child, Roebling returned to engineering as a vocation. He first worked on projects to improve river navigation and build [[canal]]s. For three years, he conducted surveys for railway lines across the [[Allegheny Mountains]], from [[Harrisburg]] to [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], for the state of [[Pennsylvania]].

In 1840 he wrote to [[suspension bridge]] designer [[Charles Ellet, Jr.]], offering to help with the design of a bridge near Philadelphia:&lt;ref&gt;Steinman, David B. &amp; Watson, Sara Ruth, ''Bridges and their Builders'', 1941&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The study of suspension bridges formed for the last few years of my residence in Europe my favourite occupation ... Let but a single bridge of the kind be put up in Philadelphia, exhibiting all the beautiful forms of the system to full advantage, and it needs no prophecy to foretell the effect which the novel and useful features will produce upon the intelligent minds of the Americans.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Roebling Shop with bridge.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Roebling's Shop in [[Saxonburg, Pennsylvania]], adjacent to a replica of the Brooklyn Bridge]]

Roebling began producing [[wire rope]] at Saxonburg in 1841. At that time canal boats from [[Philadelphia]] were transported over the [[Allegheny Mountains]] on railroad cars in order to access waterways on the other side of the mountains, so that the boats could continue to Pittsburgh. The system of inclines and levels that moved the boats and  conventional railroad cars was a state-owned enterprise, the [[Allegheny Portage Railroad]]. The railroad cars were pulled up and down the inclines by a long loop of thick [[hemp]] rope, up to 7&amp;nbsp;centimeters thick. The hemp ropes were expensive and had to be replaced frequently. Roebling remembered an article he had read about wire ropes. Soon after, he started developing a 7-strand wire rope at a [[ropewalk]] that he built on his farm.

In 1844 Roebling won a bid to replace the wooden canal [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]] across the [[Allegheny River]] with the [[Allegheny Aqueduct (Pittsburgh)|Allegheny Aqueduct]]. His design encompassed seven spans of 163 feet (50 m), each consisting of a wooden trunk to hold the water, supported by a continuous cable made of many parallel wires, wrapped tightly together, on each side of the trunk. He followed this innovation in 1845 by building a suspension bridge over the [[Monongahela River]] at Pittsburgh.

In 1848 Roebling undertook the construction of four suspension aqueducts on the [[Delaware and Hudson Canal]]. During this period, he moved to [[Trenton, New Jersey]]. In Trenton, Roebling built a large industrial complex for wire production. This complex inspired the [[Trenton, New Jersey]] motto on Trenton's [[Lower Trenton Bridge]]: "Trenton Makes, the World Takes". 
[[File:Cincinnati-roebling-suspension-bridge.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Roebling Suspension Bridge]], spanning the [[Ohio River]] at [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], at night]]
Roebling's next project, starting in 1851, was a railroad bridge connecting the [[New York Central]] and [[Great Western Railway]] of Canada over the [[Niagara River]]. Construction took four years. The bridge, with a clear span of 825 feet (251 m), was supported by four, ten-inch (25&amp;nbsp;cm) wire cables, and had two levels, one for vehicles and one for rail traffic.

While the Niagara bridge was being built, Roebling undertook a railway suspension bridge across the [[Kentucky River]], which required a clear span of 1,224 feet (373 m). The anchorage and stone towers were completed, and the cable wire delivered along with the material for the superstructure, when the railway company became insolvent. The bridge construction was halted. It was later completed as the first [[cantilever bridge]] in the US, with a [[truss bridge|truss for carrying the railway track]].

In 1859 Roebling completed another suspension bridge at Pittsburgh. Its total length was 1,030 feet (314m), consisting of two main spans of 344 feet (105 m) each, and two side spans of 171 feet (52 m) each.

The [[American Civil War]] brought a temporary halt to Roebling's work. However, in 1863 building resumed on a bridge over the [[Ohio River]] at [[Cincinnati]], which he had started in 1856 and halted due to lack of financing; he finished this bridge in 1867. The Cincinnati-Covington Bridge, later named the [[John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge]] in his honor, was the world's longest suspension bridge at the time it was finished.

==Death==
In 1867 Roebling started design work on what is now called the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], spanning the [[East River]] in New York. On June 28, 1869 at [[Fulton Ferry (ferry)|Fulton Ferry]], while he was standing at the edge of a dock, working on fixing the location where the bridge would be built, his foot was crushed by an arriving ferry. His injured toes were amputated. He refused further medical treatment and wanted to cure his foot by "[[Water cure (therapy)|water therapy]]" (continuous pouring of water over the wound). His condition deteriorated. He died on July 22, 1869 of [[tetanus]] at the home of his son on [[Hicks Street]], in [[Brooklyn Heights]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |agency= |title=John A. Roebling, the Engineer |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E05E2DC133AEF34BC4B51DFB1668382679FDE |quote= |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=July 23, 1869 |accessdate=2015-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was just 24 days after the accident.&lt;ref&gt;McCullough, David, ''The Great Bridge'', 1982, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Roebling is buried in the [[Riverview Cemetery, Trenton|Riverview Cemetery]] in [[Trenton, New Jersey]].

==Legacy==
Roebling devised "an equilibrium strength approach, in which equilibrium is always satisfied but compatibility of deformations is not enforced."  This was essentially an approximation method similar to the force method: First, Roebling computed the dead and live loads, then divided the load between the cables and the stays. Roebling added a large safety factor to the divided loads and then solved for the forces. This approach gave a sufficiently accurate analysis of the structure given the assumption that the structure was [[Ductility|sufficiently ductile]] to handle the resulting deformation (Buonopane, 2006).

==Personal life==
Roebling was the youngest of four children. He was baptized in the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church [[Divi Blasii, Mühlhausen|Divi Blasii in Mühlhausen]]. As a young boy he played the [[bass clarinet]] and the [[french horn]]. He also exhibited great artistic talent for sketches and paintings. His father owned a small tobacco shop, but the business was insufficient to provide livelihood for all three sons. Roebling's sister Friederike Amalie married Carl August Meissner, a poor merchant in the town, and his oldest brother Herman Christian Roebling prepared to take over the tobacco shop.&lt;ref&gt;Schuyler, Hamilton, ''The Roeblings'', 1931, p. 9, Princeton NJ&lt;/ref&gt;

John Roebling and Johanna Herting had nine children:
*son: [[Washington Roebling|Washington Augustus Roebling]] (b. 1837, d. 1926)
*daughter: Laura R. Methfessel (b. 1840, d. 1873)
*son: Ferdinand William Roebling (b. 1842, d. 1917)
*daughter: Elvira R. Stewart (b. 1844, d. 1871)
*daughter: Josephine R. Jarvis (b. 1847,)
*son: Charles Gustavus Roebling (b. 9-Dec-1849, d. 1918)
*son: Edmund Roebling (b. 1854, d. 1930)
*son: William Elderhorst Roebling (b. 1856, d. 1860)
*daughter: Hannah Roebling (died in infancy)

Roebling's son [[Washington Roebling]] and his daughter-in-law [[Emily Warren Roebling]] continued his work on the Brooklyn Bridge. His son Ferdinand expanded his wire rope business. His son [[Charles Roebling]] designed and invented a huge 80 ton wire rope machine and founded the town of [[Florence-Roebling, NJ|Roebling, New Jersey]] where the John A. Roebling's Sons company [[Florence-Roebling, NJ#Roebling Steel Mill|steel mill]] was built. His grandson Washington A. Roebling II perished on the {{RMS|Titanic}}. His great-grandson [[Donald Roebling]] was a noted philanthropist and inventor who devised the [[amphtrack]].

'''John Aasen''' (March 5, 1890 – August 1, 1938) was an American [[silent film]] [[actor]] who was one of the [[List of tallest people|tallest actors in history]].

==Early life==
Aasen was born in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], Minnesota.&lt;ref name="as"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartzman|first1=Marc|title=American Sideshow: An Encyclopedia of History's Most Wondrous and Curiously Strange Performers|date=2006|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781585425303|pages=108-109|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ruXJxuyNfgC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=%22John+Aasen%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4seWSkqLbAhXtna0KHULuA70Q6AEIMTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22John%20Aasen%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Kristi (Danielsen) from [[Rollag]] in [[Numedal]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfk.no/html/saksdok/13154070.html Johan Aasen - culture and travel industry project in Rollag municipality], [[Buskerud]] [[County municipality (Norway)|county municipality]] {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an extremely tall [[Norway|Norwegian]] woman of around 2.20 m (almost 7&amp;nbsp;ft 3&amp;nbsp;inches) in height (latest information from September 2008, sets her height to 188&amp;nbsp;cm, almost 6&amp;nbsp;ft 2&amp;nbsp;inches).{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} It is not certain who his father was, but according to Aasen's sister Evelyn (who died in 1988), his father was Alfred Aasen. When Aasen was ten years old, he and his mother moved from [[Ridgeway, Iowa|Ridgeway]], Iowa (where his uncle Sam/Sevre lived with his wife Cornelia) to [[Sheyenne, North Dakota|Sheyenne]], North Dakota with his two younger siblings. Aasen was a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]]. He raised to the degree of Master Mason at Highland Park Lodge No. 382, Los Angeles on July 14, 1924.
&lt;ref&gt;Denslow, William R. 10,000 Famous Freemasons, Vol. I, A-D.&lt;/ref&gt;

When in Sheyenne, Aasen's mother operated a restaurant.  He attended school and helped out in the family business. In 1902, Aasen's mother died. He was taken into many homes and families. When a family he was staying with started to operate a hotel in [[Leeds, North Dakota|Leeds]], North Dakota, he moved with them there. Aasen's growth started slowly. When he was confirmed in the [[Lutheran]] faith in Grandfield Lutheran Church near Sheyenne, North Dakota, he was the shortest in his class. According to some sources, Aasen was around 2.74 m or 8 feet, 11½ inches (which, if true, would make him even taller than [[Robert Pershing Wadlow|Robert Wadlow]], the tallest verified person in history). The ''[[Top 10 of Everything]]'' 2010 edition states his height at 8 feet, 9.7&amp;nbsp;inches.

==True height==
According to the 1978 edition of ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' he was only 7 feet (213.4&amp;nbsp;cm). Just before his death, at age 46, he was medically measured at 7 feet 0.9&amp;nbsp;inches, however he had lost some height due to age and could not stand completely straight anymore. In June 2008, [[Loma Linda University]] confirmed that the {{convert|7|ft|2.4|in|cm|sigfig=3|adj=on}} skeleton they had in their collection was John Aasen.

==Career==
Aasen worked for Midway Chemical, a company based in St. Paul, in 1917-1918. After that, he worked in various shows, including Barnum &amp; Bailey and C.A. Wortham's World's Best Shows.&lt;ref name="as" /&gt;

The death of giant George Auger led to Aasen's working in the film ''[[Why Worry?]]'' (1923).&lt;ref name="as" /&gt; Later, he acted in several other films like ''[[Bengal Tiger (1936 film)|Bengal Tiger]]'', ''[[Charlie Chan at the Circus]]'', ''[[Growing Pains (1928 film)|Growing Pains]]'', ''[[Should Married Men Go Home?]]'', ''[[Legionnaires in Paris]]'', ''[[Two Flaming Youths]]'', ''[[The Sting of Stings]]'', ''[[Long Fliv the King]]'' and the [[Tod Browning]] film ''[[Freaks]]'', in a small uncredited cameo appearance.

==Death==
Aasen died from [[pneumonia]] on August 1, 1938 at Mendocino State Hospital in [[Mendocino, California]]. His body was later shipped to a doctor in Missouri for study and dissection. The skeleton was kept by the doctor, and eventually shipped to [[Loma Linda, California]]. Aasen's cremated soft parts were given a [[Masonic]] funeral at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Cemetery]] in [[Glendale, California]].

==Biography==

===Early life and ancestors===

John Franklin Gray&lt;ref name=Raymond19&gt;Raymond, 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Raymond20&gt;Raymond, 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brace34&amp;ndash;35&amp;ndash;36&amp;ndash;37&gt;Brace, 34&amp;ndash;35&amp;ndash;36&amp;ndash;37&lt;/ref&gt; was born on September 23, 1804, at [[Sherburne, New York]] and died on June 9, 1882, at the [[Fifth Avenue Hotel]], in New York City.  He was the fourth of five sons of John Gray,&lt;ref name=Raymond17&gt;Raymond, 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Raymond12&gt;Raymond, 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark 191&lt;/ref&gt;  (December 15, 1769 - April 24, 1859), and the grandson of John Gray, a founder of Sherburne, and Elizabeth Skeel. Two of Dr. Gray's brothers, Dr. Alfred W. Gray (1802–1873) and Dr. Patrick Wells Gray (1806–1882), were both prominent homeopathic physicians and surgeons.  Dr. Gray's father served as a captain in Col. Samuel Whiting's 4th [[regiment]] of the Connecticut Militia in the American Revolutionary War. He was appointed and served as first Judge of the [[New York Court of Common Pleas|Court of Common Pleas]] for Chenango County, New York until 1819 when the family removed to [[Sheridan, New York|Sheridan]], [[Chautauqua County, New York]].  His life was celebrated by the poet [[John Greenleaf Whittier]], at his funeral in 1859 thus recalls him:

{{cquote|When watched by eyes that love him, calm and sage, Slow fade his late declining years away.}}

His mother was Diantha Burritt,&lt;ref name="Raymond17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Raymond12" /&gt; (January 9, 1776 - October 14, 1846) the daughter of the Rev. [[Blackleach Burritt]],&lt;ref&gt;Dexter, 103&lt;/ref&gt; who graduated from [[Yale College]] in 1765,  and was a great-great grandson  of Governor [[William Leete]], who was the Governor of the Colony of New Haven from 1661 to 1665 and [[Governor of Connecticut]] from 1676 to 1683; and Martha Welles (1744 - April 1786) a daughter of Gideon Welles and Eunice Walker and a great-great granddaughter of Governor [[Thomas Welles]] the Fourth Colonial Governor of Connecticut. Diantha had been a school teacher in Vermont before her marriage, at Winhall, Vermont on May 26, 1793, and was a poet and woman of literary taste.

His mother was instrumental in encouraging his interest in medicine as his profession. Her favorite brother, Dr. Eli Burritt, born March 12, 1773, at Pound Ridge, Westchester County, New York and died September 1, 1823, in [[Troy, New York|Troy]], [[Rensselaer County, New York]] was a physician and encouraged Dr. Gray's interest in medicine as well.

He graduated from [[Williams College]] in 1800, and was licensed to practice medicine at Troy, New York, on March 29, 1802, and he quickly gained recognition for his medical skills.

Dr. [[Francis Wayland]] (1796–1865), fourth president of [[Brown University]], said the following about his former teacher: "Dr. Burritt was a man of remarkable logical powers of enthusiastic love of his profession, and of great and deserved confidence in his own judgment. He stood at the head of his profession in Troy, and in the neighboring region, and was a person of high moral character".

===Marriage and family===

He married on September 25, 1826, in New York City, Elizabeth Williams Hull, born in 1808 in [[New Hartford, New York]] and died on May 28, 1868 in New York City, and is buried in [[Green-Wood Cemetery]] in [[Brooklyn]] beside her husband.

Hosack was also a founder of the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.&lt;ref name=Cleave454&gt;Cleave 454&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a common practice in the early 19th century for students to receive a part of their education through a system of apprenticeships until medical schools were to assume a major role in education.  These apprenticeships usually covered a period of three years and were regulated by local medical societies.&lt;ref name="Cleave454" /&gt;

During the time of his studies he was appointed assistant surgeon in the navy; and as it was necessary that he should be a graduate or licentiate in order to hold this position, he was accorded a license by the county medical society. He graduated from [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]] in 1826.&lt;ref name="King79&amp;ndash;80&amp;ndash;81&amp;ndash;82&amp;ndash;94&amp;ndash;95&amp;ndash;200&amp;ndash;201"/&gt;

=== Career ===

Immediately after graduating and completing his residency, he opened an office on Charlton Street in New York City. In acquiring his practice he was assisted by his future father-in-law, Dr. A. G. Hull, of New York, by Dr. Hosack, and by Dr. Watts. Dr. Gray's success in obtaining patients and social patronage was very strong and rapid ; so much so, that in his first year he was enabled to get married and to support a moderate house comfortably, and in his second to sustain a doctor's horse and gig.

Soon after starting in private practice he began the study of the French language, and carried it far enough to read medical authors; two years later he began the German, and kept at it till he could read it fluently and even speak it with palpable scope and accuracy of diction.

Soon after, he learned of Hahnemann's medical theories through Hans B. Gram,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Danish doctor, who was born in Boston of Danish parents and was educated in Denmark. He heard Dr. Gram lecture, but was not convinced. He then reluctantly consented to let Dr. Gram treat one of his patients, whose case had resisted his own skill. Dr. Gram had remarkable success, not only with that patient but with others, and Dr. Gray was converted to homeopathy.&lt;ref name="Ohio History"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haller117&gt;Haller, 117&lt;/ref&gt; He did not, however, believe that homeopathy and allopathic medicine to be mutually exclusive, but rather believed them to be complementary.&lt;ref name="Cleave454" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rothstein163&gt;Rothstein, 163&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1828, Dr. Gray adopted homœopathy as the major rule in his practice and announced his intention to practice according to that system openly, and in consequence lost his profitable practice and all his professional friends. He endured many hardships and much ill-treatment for his devotion to homeopathy.&lt;ref name="Ohio History"/&gt;  Dr. Gray was the first to propose the formation of a national society of homeopathy, and in 1844 the American Institute of Homeopathy was organized.&lt;ref name="King79&amp;ndash;80&amp;ndash;81&amp;ndash;82&amp;ndash;94&amp;ndash;95&amp;ndash;200&amp;ndash;201"/&gt;

In 1833, he commenced the practice of medicine in partnership with his brother-in-law. Dr. Amos Gerald Hull.&lt;ref name="Cleave416" /&gt;&lt;ref name="King79&amp;ndash;80&amp;ndash;81&amp;ndash;82&amp;ndash;94&amp;ndash;95&amp;ndash;200&amp;ndash;201"/&gt;

In 1834, he founded the New York Homœopathic Society.  Its stated purpose was for ''the purpose of protecting, enriching and disseminating such of the propositions and testimonies of Homœopathia as upon mature trial they shall find to be sound and available''. The first officers of the society were: president, John F. Gray ; vice-presidents, Edward A. Strong, George Baxter ; corresponding secretary, [[Federal Vanderburgh]] ; recording secretary, Daniel Seymour ; treasurer, F. A. Lohse ; registrar, A. Gerald Hull ; librarian, F. L. Wilsey ; finance committee, J. H. Patterson, Oliver S. Strong, L. M. H. Butler, William Bock.&lt;ref name="King79&amp;ndash;80&amp;ndash;81&amp;ndash;82&amp;ndash;94&amp;ndash;95&amp;ndash;200&amp;ndash;201"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cleave454" /&gt;

This society was composed of physicians and laymen. William Cullen Bryant, the poet-editor, was a member. He was an early convert to homœopathy and all his life was a strong supporter of its principles.

==Personal life and spiritualism==

Every week, the Grays hosted a salon remarkable for attracting the leading artists and intellectuals of the day as well as other prominent  medical men of the city who attended, and they became well known as social leaders in the city, supporting causes such as the abolition of slavery and women's suffrage. Dr. Gray befriended the poets [[William Cullen Bryant]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Jurdan Martitegi Lizaso''' (born May 10, 1980, in [[Durango, Biscay|Durango]], [[Biscay|Vizcaya]]) is a member of the terrorist [[Basque nationalist]] and [[separatist]] group Euskadi Ta Askatasuna ([[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]]). He is best known as the head of the military/commando unit of the group since late 2008 until April 18, 2009, when he was arrested by French police. He is considered to be one of the most dangerous members of ETA, considered a terrorist organization by the European Union, with police describing him as "extremely violent".&lt;ref name="commandos"&gt;

He gained prominence in the military section of ETA by leading the 'commando Vizcaya' (Biscay Command) after the 2006 cesasfire along with [[Arkaitz Goikoetxea]] and rose to the highest level of ETA's military leadership following the December 2008 arrest of Aitzol Iriondo alias ''Gurbita'' who had replaced [[Miguel de Garikoitz Aspiazu Rubina]] alias ''Txeroki'', arrested less than a month before.&lt;ref&gt;

==ETA activity==
===Kale borroka===
Before joining ETA, Jurdan Martitegi had a wide record of [[kale borroka]] acts. On February 12, 1998, he presented himself in front of [[Baltasar Garzón]], after being accused of several street violence acts during 1997.&lt;ref name="kaleborroka"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; He was shortly released but later accused of taking part in a molotov attack against an [[Ertzaintza]] police station in [[Amorebieta]]. In 2000 he was arrested after attacking a concessionaire in [[Iurreta]] and a bank and [[Guardia Civil]] barracks in [[Galdakao]], in which a policeman was wounded.&lt;ref name="kaleborroka_dos"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested again on March 5, 2001, after placing an explosive at the [[Durango, Biscay|Durango]] courts and spent some time at the [[Alcalá Meco]] and [[Daroca]] prisons.&lt;ref name="kaleborroka"/&gt;

===Comando member===
Martitegi is believed to have joined ETA after he was released from prison. He left his Durango home in 2006 after he knew police were searching him.&lt;ref name="instructor"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the 'commando Vizcaya' after the [[ETA's 2006 ceasefire declaration|2006 ceasefire]] and carried several attacks along with Arkaitz Goikoetxea, including the bombing of Civil Guard's cuartel in Durango on August 24, 2007, a bomb attack in front of a courthouse in [[Sestao]] on December 16, 2007, a car bomb explosion outside a Guardia Civil barracks in [[Calahorra]], [[La Rioja (Spain)|Rioja]] on March 21, 2008&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; He is also believed to have carried a failed attack outside [[Getxo]] courthouse on November 11, 2007.&lt;ref name="kaleborroka_dos"/&gt; According to police he's the main suspect of killing [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] councilior [[Isaías Carrasco]] on March 7, 2008, as eyewitnesses described the killer as a 'tall man', a description which fits with Martitegi's two meters height.&lt;ref name="carrasco"/&gt;

Jurdan Martitegi carried all of the attacks along with his fellow partner Arkaitz Goikoetxea, who was arrested on July 22, 2008, after Spanish police dismantled the Vizcaya cell. Martitegi was able to escape before police arrested nine other suspects.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Police reported that Martitegi and Txeroki had trained several ETA members of the Nafarroa cell in [[Hendaia]] during 2008.&lt;ref name="instructor"/&gt; Four days after this cell was arrested, on October 30, ETA bombed the [[University of Navarra]], injuring up to twenty-one persons.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military chief===
In early 2009, Spanish press revealed that ETA's current top leaders Juan Cruz Maiztegui Bengoa, 63, alias ''Pastor'' and José Luis Eciolaza Galán alias ''Dienteputo'' had entrusted Martitegi to quickly reorganize the commandos and make them ready to commit 'deadly attacks'.&lt;ref name="commandos"/&gt; Some days later, Spanish police confirmed that ETA had restructured its commandos and that Martitegi would be leading them along with his lieutenant "Andoni Sarasola" and ETA member "Iurgi Mendinueta".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Martitegi has already asked his commandos to carry quick attacks, always with car bombs.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Since his work as a military chief ETA has already carried several attacks (see [[List of ETA attacks#2009|List of ETA attacks in 2009]]), including the bombing of the Basque television in [[Bilbao]] on December 31, 2008, and a van bomb in Madrid on February 8, 2009, which led police to think that ETA has established its first cell in Madrid for about six years.&lt;ref&gt;

| accessdate = 2009-02-13
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, ''El Confidencial'' revealed that police were afraid that Martitegi would try to carry a ''very big attack'' to vindicate himself to ETA leaders. Police also warned that ETA's goal was to kill [[ertzaina]]s during the [[Basque parliamentary election, 2009|Basque elections]] campaign.&lt;ref name="profile"/&gt;

Although he officially controlled all of ETA's cells, Martitegi had problems moving in public due to his high stature of more than 1.90 meters, which made him easily detectable.&lt;ref name="commandos"/&gt;

The '''Khanty''' (in older literature: '''Ostyaks''') are an [[indigenous people]] calling themselves ''Khanti, Khande, Kantek'' (Khanty), living in [[Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug]], a region historically known as "[[Yugra]]" in [[Russia]], together with the [[Mansi people|Mansi]]. In the [[autonomous okrug]], the [[Khanty language|Khanty]] and [[Mansi language]]s are given co-official status with Russian. In the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Census]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/perepis2010/croc/perepis_itogi1612.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 30,943 persons identified themselves as Khanty.  Of those, 26,694 were resident in [[Tyumen Oblast]], of which 17,128 were living in Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug and 8,760&amp;mdash;in [[Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug]]. 873 were residents of neighbouring [[Tomsk Oblast]], and 88 lived in the [[Komi Republic]].&lt;!-- [http://www.raipon.org/russian_site/people/people_perepis_2002_rus.htm] --&gt;

== History ==

In the centuries of the second millennium BC, the territories between [[Kama River|Kama]] and [[Irtysh River|Irtysh]] rivers were the home of a Proto-Uralic speaking population who had  contacts with Proto-Indo-European speakers from the South.&lt;ref name="Khanty"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 =Wiget| first1 =Andrew | last2= Balalaeva | first2= Olga | authorlink =  | title = Khanty, People of the Taiga: Surviving the 20th Century | publisher = University of Alaska Press | year = 2011 | location = | pages =3 | url = | isbn = 978-16022-3125-2 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The inhabitants of these areas were of Europid stock,&lt;ref name="Khanty"/&gt; although the Khanty are predominantly [[Uraloid]]. This woodland population is the ancestor of the modern-day Ugrian inhabitants of Trans-Uralia.&lt;ref name="Khanty"/&gt; Some consider the Khanty's ancestors to be the prehistoric [[metalworking]] [[Andronovo]] Culture. Other researchers say that the Khanty people originated in the south Ural steppe and moved northwards into their current location about 500 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|title=Britannica
|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/316322/Khanty-and-Mansi#ref272005
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Khanty probably appear in Russian records under the name [[Yugra]] (ca. 11th century), when they had contact with Russian hunters and merchants. The name comes from [[Komi-Zyrian language]] ''jögra'' ('Khanty'). It is also possible that they were first recorded by the English King [[Alfred the Great]] (ca. 9th century), who located Fenland ([[wetland]]) to the east of the White Sea in Western Siberia. The older Russian name Ostyak is from Khanty ''as-kho'' 'person from the Ob (''as'') River,' with -''yak'' after other ethnic terms like ''Permyak''.&lt;ref&gt;M. Vasmer, ''Etimologicheskii slovar russkogo yazyka'', Vol. III (Moscow, 1971), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Khanty princedoms were partially included in the [[Siberia Khanate]] from the 1440s–1570s.

In the 11th century, [[Yugra]] was actually a term for numerous tribes, each having its own centre and its own chief. Every tribe had two [[exogamy|exogamic]] [[phratry|phratries]], termed ''mon't''' and ''por'', and all members were considered to be blood relatives. This structure was later replaced with [[clan]]s, where each clan leader (''knyazets'') negotiated with the Russian realm. They also participated in Russian campaigns, and received the right to collect ''yasaq'' (tribute) from two Khanty ''volosts'' (districts) respectively. When this structure was no longer needed, Russia deprived them of their privileges.

Between the 17th and 19th centuries, there were attempts to introduce [[Christianity]], but the Khanty lifestyle did not undergo any real changes. In the second half of 19th century, they gradually accepted state law.

During the [[USSR|Soviet]] period the Khanty were one of the few indigenous minorities of Siberia to be granted an autonomy in the form of an [[okrug]] (autonomous district). The establishment of autonomy has played a considerable role in consolidation of the ethnos (the Western Khants called their eastern neighbours ''Kantõk'' [the Other People]). However, in the 1930s concerted efforts were made by the Soviet state to collectivise them. The initial stages of this meant the execution of tribal chiefs who were labelled "[[kulak]]s" followed by the execution of [[shaman]]s. The abduction by the state of the children who were sent to Russian speaking boarding schools provoked a national revolt in 1933 called the [[Kazym rebellion]].

After the end of the [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] period this process was relaxed and efforts were intensified in the 1980s and '90s to protect their common territory from industrial expansion of various ministries and agencies. The autonomy has also played a major role in preserving the traditional culture and language.

== Economy ==
The Khantys' traditional occupations were fishery, taiga hunting and reindeer herding. They lived as trappers, thus gathering was of major importance.

== Organisation ==
The Khanty are one of the indigenous minorities in Siberia with an autonomy in the form of an [[okrug]] (autonomous area).

== Religion ==
Khanty are today Orthodox Christians, mixed with traditional beliefs (shamans, reincarnation). Their historical shaman wore no special clothes except a cap. Traditional Khanty cults are closely related to nature. The Crow spring celebration is being celebrated in April, nowadays it is April 7, the same day as the Annunciation day. The Bear Celebration is being celebrated occasionally after a successful hunting of a bear. The Bear Celebration continues 5 or 6 days (the duration depends on the sex of the animal). Over 300 songs and performances occur during a Bear Celebration. The most important parts of the celebration are:
* Nukh Kiltatty Ar (The Awakening Song) 
* Ily Vukhalty Ar (The Coming Down From The Sky Song) - The story about the son of Torum (the sky god). The son was sent by Torum to rule the Earth. He has forgotten father's advice, lost his immortality, turned into a beast and has been killed by the hunters. 
*  Il Veltatty Ar (The Lullaby)

== Language ==
{{main|Khanty language}}
The Khanty language is a language belonging to the Ugric branch of the [[Uralic languages]], consisting of ten dialects, divided into southern, northern and eastern subgroups, and related to [[Mansi language|Mansi]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].

[[Lionel Barrymore]] (born Lionel Herbert Blythe; 1878–1954) was an American actor of stage, screen and radio. He also directed several films, wrote scripts, created etchings, sketches and composed music.&lt;ref name="ANBO: LB" /&gt; He was the eldest child of the actors [[Maurice Barrymore]] and [[Georgiana Drew|Georgie Drew Barrymore]], and his two siblings were [[John Barrymore|John]] and [[Ethel Barrymore|Ethel]]; these and other family members were part of an [[Barrymore family|acting dynasty]].&lt;ref name="ANBO: JB" /&gt;{{sfn|Byers|1998|pp=28–30}} Reluctant to follow his parents' career,{{sfn|Barrymore|1951|p=40}} Barrymore appeared together with his grandmother [[Louisa Lane Drew]] in a stage production of ''[[The Rivals]]'' at the age of 15.{{sfn|Byers|1998|p=29}} He soon found success on stage in character roles. Although he took a break from acting in 1906–09 to train in Paris as a painter, he was not successful as an artist and returned to the US and acting.&lt;ref name="ANBO: LB" /&gt; He also joined his family troupe, from 1910, in their [[vaudeville]] act.{{sfn|Cullen|2004|p=72}}

Barrymore began his film career in 1911, appearing in numerous [[silent film]]s, many of which have subsequently been [[lost film|lost]]. In 1912 he signed a contract with [[D. W. Griffith]]'s [[Biograph Company]] and appeared as a character actor in short films before moving into feature-length productions in 1914.&lt;ref name="ANBO: LB" /&gt; He began writing scripts and directing films shortly afterwards, and for the next five years he did not act on the legitimate stage.{{sfn|Peters|1990|p=533}} Although he had several successes on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] after the First World War, he encountered strongly negative criticism in a 1921 production of ''[[Macbeth]]'' and in three productions in a row in 1925. Afterwards, he never again appeared on the New York stage.&lt;ref name="ANBO: LB" /&gt; In 1925 he signed a contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], where he became a close friend of [[Louis B. Mayer]] and for whom he made numerous films.&lt;ref name="ANBO: LB" /&gt; He directed several films from 1929 to 1931 but concentrated on acting after that.&lt;ref name="AFI: Filmography" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BFI: Filmography" /&gt;

Barrymore became well known in curmudgeonly roles.&lt;ref name="EB: LB" /&gt; In 1938 he broke his hip and, aggravated by arthritis, he lived the remainder of his life in a wheelchair.{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|1981|pp=215–16}} Mayer made sure that roles were found or written to accommodate Barrymore, who continued to act in films until 1953.&lt;ref name="ANBO: LB" /&gt;{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|1981|p=217}} During that time he appeared as Dr. Gillespie in the popular Dr. Kildare film series with [[Lew Ayres]] in the titular role,{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|1981|pp=222–24}} and as [[Mr. Potter]] in ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''—a role that was highly placed on the [[American Film Institute]]'s list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains|100 Heroes and Villains]]&lt;ref name="AFI 100" /&gt; in a film that the critic [[Philip French]] described as "a complex inspirational work".&lt;ref name="French: IAWW" /&gt; Beginning in the 1930s, Barrymore increasingly worked in radio, initially as [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] in [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Adaptations of A Christmas Carol#Radio|A Christmas Carol]]'', which was broadcast annually from 1934 to 1953,{{sfn|Dunning|1998|p=153}} then in ''[[Mayor of the Town (radio program)|Mayor of the Town]]'' beginning in 1942,{{sfn|Terrace|1998|pp=221–222}} and also in a radio series spun off from the Dr. Kildare films (playing the same character that he had played in the films), among others.{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|1981|p=223}}

Two of the films in which Barrymore appeared—''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'' (1932) and ''[[You Can't Take It with You (film)|You Can't Take It with You]]'' (1938)—won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].&lt;ref name="AMPAS: Grand Hotel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AMPAS: Take it" /&gt; He was considered for the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] for his 1929 film, ''[[Madame X (1929 film)|Madame X]]'',{{efn|The "consideration" in the early ceremonies is not classed by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] as an official nomination. The Academy states that "Though not official nominations, the additional names in each category, according to in-house records, were under consideration by the various boards of judges."&lt;ref name="AMPAS: Madame X" /&gt;}} and won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] award for his performance in ''[[A Free Soul]]'' (1931). He was inducted to the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] on February 8, 1960&lt;ref name="WoF: Barrymore" /&gt; and is, along with his two siblings, included in the [[American Theater Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name="Hall o F" /&gt;

The list does not include the 1913 film ''The Vengeance of Galora'', which Barrymore wrote. Although some sources list him as also appearing in the film, his biographers, James Kotsilibas-Davis and Margot Peters, separately state he did not. Kotsilibas-Davis also lists ''[[Fighting Blood]]'' (1911), ''[[My Hero (1912 film)|My Hero]]'' (1912) and ''[[The Musketeers of Pig Alley]]'' (1912) as films in which Barrymore did not appear, despite claims of other biographers to the contrary; Peters does not list the films in her filmography of the actor.{{sfn|Peters|1990|p=533}}{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|1981|pp=340–41}}

{{Book of Mormon}}
This list is intended as a quick reference for individuals mentioned in the [[Book of Mormon]].

{{compact ToC|side=yes|top=yes|num=yes}}

==Notation==

Names with superscripts (e.g., Nephi¹) are numbered according to the index in the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS]] scripture, the Book of Mormon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/in/contents Index&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Missing indices indicate people in the index who are not in the Book of Mormon; for instance, Aaron¹ is the biblical [[Aaron]], brother of [[Moses]].

* '''Bold type''' indicates the person was an important religious figure, such as a [[prophet]] or a missionary.
* ''Italic type'' indicates the person was a king, chief judge or other ruler.
* &lt;u&gt;Underlined type&lt;/u&gt; indicates the person was a historian or record keeper; one whose writing (abridged or not) is included in ''The Book of Mormon''.
* Combined typefaces indicate combined roles. For example, '''''bold italic''''' indicates an individual was both a religious and secular leader.

'''Manute Bol''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|n|uː|t|_|ˈ|b|oʊ|l}}; October 16, 1962 – June 19, 2010) was a Sudanese-born American [[basketball]] player and political [[activist]]. Listed at {{height|ft=7|in=7}} tall, he was the tallest player in the history of the [[National Basketball Association]], along with [[Gheorghe Mureșan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Brown|first= Donald H.|title=A Basketball Handbook|year= 2007|publisher=AuthorHouse| isbn= 978-1-4259-6190-9| page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YJmsqtj-rh4C&amp;pg=PA20| location=Bloomington, Indiana}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was officially measured and listed at {{convert|7|ft|6+3/4|in}} tall in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]''. He is believed to have been born on October 16, 1962, in either [[Turalei]] or [[Gogrial]], [[History of Sudan (1956–69)|Sudan]]. He was the son of a [[Dinka people|Dinka]] tribal elder who gave him the name Manute, which means "special blessing".

Bol played for two colleges and four NBA teams over his career. A [[center (basketball)|center]], he was known as a specialist player and was considered among the best shot-blockers in the history of the sport despite other aspects of his game being considered fairly weak. Over the course of his career, Bol blocked more shots than he scored points, making him the only NBA player ever to do so. He is second all-time in NBA history in terms of average [[block (basketball)|blocked shots]] per game and ranks 15th on the [[List of National Basketball Association career blocks leaders|career blocks list]].

==Early life and family background==
Manute Bol was born to Madute and Okwok Bol in Turalei or Gogrial and raised near Gogrial. His date of birth was not recorded; college basketball coach [[Kevin Mackey]] listed Bol's birthday as October 16, 1962, but believed he was actually much older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Stefan|title=Manute Bol lied about his age, may have been 50 years old when he played in the NBA: report|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/manute-bol-lied-age-50-played-nba-article-1.3649488|website=NY Daily News|accessdate=November 22, 2017|date=November 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bol came from a family of extraordinarily tall men and women: "My mother was {{height|ft=6|in=10}}, my father {{height|ft=6|in=8}}, and my sister is {{height|ft=6|in=8}}", he said. "And my great-grandfather was even taller—{{height|ft=7|in=10}}." His ethnic group, the Dinka, and the [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic people]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Roberts |first = D. F. |author2=D. R. Bainbridge |title = Nilotic physique |journal = Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. |volume = 21 |issue = 3 |pages = 341–70 |date = Sep 1963 |doi = 10.1002/ajpa.1330210309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of which they are a part, are among the taller populations of the world. Bol's hometown, Turalei, is the origin of other exceptionally tall individuals, including {{height|ft=7|in=4}} basketball player Ring Ayuel. Ayuel is a refugee from the [[Second Sudanese Civil War|civil war]] which broke out soon after Bol emigrated to the U.S. and which eventually led to the destruction of most of Turalei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steward |first=Carl |title=His spirit, giant: Sudanese player embraced at Ohlone College |publisher=Inside Bay Area (via Ohlone College) |date=12 Jan 2011 |url=http://www.ohlone.edu/org/athletics/mensbasketball/teamnews20102011/20110112sudaneseplayer.html |accessdate=2013-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018030948/http://www.ohlone.edu/org/athletics/mensbasketball/teamnews20102011/20110112sudaneseplayer.html |archivedate=2013-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He tended his family's cattle in boyhood. According to a tale he was often asked to repeat in interviews, he once killed a lion with a spear after it attacked his cattle. The lion was asleep, though he was often encouraged to embellish the story. He started playing basketball only at about age 15.

Complementing his great [[human height|height]], Bol possessed exceptionally long limbs (inseam {{convert|49|in|cm}}) and large hands and feet ([[Shoe size|size]] 16 {{small|1/2}}). His [[arm span]], at {{convert|8|ft|6|in|m}}, is (as of 2013) the longest in NBA history, and his reach was {{convert|10|ft|5|in|m}}.&lt;ref name="WaPo obit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Former NBA player Manute Bol to speak at Union |publisher = Union College |date = Nov 3, 2008 |url = http://www.union.edu/N/DS/s.php?s=8105 |accessdate = 2012-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was extremely slender, limiting his offensive capability. When he arrived in the United States, he weighed {{convert|180|lb|kg}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Epting |first = Chris |title = The Manute We Knew: Curious, Shy, One of the Family . . . and a Lion Slayer |newspaper = AOL News |date = Jun 24, 2010 |url = http://www.aolnews.com/2010/06/24/the-manute-we-knew-curious-shy-one-of-the-family/ |archive-url = https://archive.is/20130117040047/http://www.aolnews.com/2010/06/24/the-manute-we-knew-curious-shy-one-of-the-family/ |dead-url = yes |archive-date = January 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and had gained just under {{convert|20|lb|kg}} by the time he entered the NBA. The Washington Bullets sent Bol to strength training with [[University of Maryland]] coach Frank Costello, where he could initially lift only {{convert|44|lb|kg}} on 10-repetition [[bench press]] and {{convert|55|lb|kg}} on 10-repetition [[squat (exercise)|squat]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = McCallum |first = Jack |title = Welcome To 'Air Bol': Stronger and heavier, the Bullets' 7'7" Manute Bol could be a force |journal = Sports Illustrated |volume = |issue = |pages = |date = Oct 21, 1985 |url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1120035/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; (his [[body mass index]] was 15.3 and he initially had a 31" (80&amp;nbsp;cm) waist).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = McManis |first = Sam |title = At 7 Foot 6, Manute Bol of Sudan Is Surely Rangy Enough for America's City Game and He Has Talent, but at 190 Pounds He May Not Be Strong Enough for Big Time: Basketball's Tallest Story |newspaper = Los Angeles Times |pages = |date = Feb 11, 1985 |url = http://articles.latimes.com/1985-02-11/sports/sp-4394_1_manute-bol }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basketball career==

===Amateur years===
Bol started playing [[Association football|soccer]] (association football) in 1972, but abandoned the game because he was too tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Sudan's NBA giant |newspaper = BBC News |date = 29 Oct 2001 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1626514.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his later teens, he started playing basketball, playing in Sudan for several years with teams in [[Wau, Sudan|Wau]] and [[Khartoum]], where he experienced prejudice from the northern Sudanese majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = |first = |title = Contemporary Black Biography |chapter = Manute Bol |publisher = Thomson Gale |edition = |location = Detroit |pages = |url = |isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While still living in Sudan, Bol apparently held an $80-a-month (1983 US$) job in the Sudanese military and played on the national team.&lt;ref name="USAToday"&gt;{{cite news|title=Scouts: Bol has slim chance at success|date=April 12, 1985|first=Kathy|last=Blumenstock|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coach [[Don Feeley]] from [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]] saw Bol play basketball in Khartoum and convinced him to go to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/manute-bol|title=Answers - The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|website=Answers.com|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bol was drafted by the [[San Diego Clippers]] in the fifth round of the [[1983 NBA draft]] (97th overall), but the league ruled that Bol had not been eligible for the draft and declared the pick invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = |first = |authorlink = |title = Manute Bol |work = |publisher = The Draft Review |url = http://www.thedraftreview.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2159 |accessdate = 2012-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then invited to [[Cleveland]] by [[Cleveland State University]] head basketball coach [[Kevin Mackey]], but he did not speak or write English very well at the time. He improved his English skills after months of classes at [[ELS Language Centers]] on the [[Case Western Reserve University]] campus, but not enough to qualify for enrollment at Cleveland State, and he never played a game there. Five years later, Cleveland State was placed on two years' probation for providing improper financial assistance to Bol and two other African players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Associated Press |title = Penalties Upheld for Cleveland State |newspaper = The New York Times |pages = |date = Apr 22, 1988 |url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6D9173AF931A15757C0A96E948260 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He enrolled at the [[University of Bridgeport]], a Division II basketball school, and played college basketball for the Purple Knights there in the 1984–1985 season.  He averaged 22.5 points, 13.5 rebounds, and 7.1 blocks per game.  The team, which previously drew 500–600 spectators, routinely sold out the 1,800-seat gym.&lt;ref name="USAToday"/&gt;  This was followed by a short stint with the [[Rhode Island Gulls]] of the [[United States Basketball League]].

===NBA===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}

Going into the [[1985 NBA draft]], scouts felt that Bol needed another year or two of college, but Bol opted for the draft because he felt that it was the only way to earn enough money to get his sister out of Sudan, which was in a state of political unrest at the time.&lt;ref name="USAToday"/&gt;  In 1985, Bol was drafted as the seventh pick in the second round by the [[Washington Bullets]] (31st overall). He played in the NBA for ten seasons, from 1985 to 1995, spending parts of four seasons with the Bullets, parts of three with the [[Golden State Warriors]], parts of four with the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], and part of one season with the [[Miami Heat]]. In 1987, the Bullets drafted the {{height|ft=5|in=3}} [[point guard]] [[Muggsy Bogues]], pairing the tallest and shortest players in the league on the court for one season.

====Washington Bullets====
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}

Bol's first tenure with the Bullets lasted three seasons, from 1985 to 1988. In his rookie season ([[1985–86 NBA season|1985–1986]]), he appeared in 80 games and recorded a career-high 5.0 blocks per game. His total of 397 blocks set the NBA [[rookie]] record, and remains the second-highest single-season total in league history behind [[Mark Eaton (basketball)|Mark Eaton]]'s 456 in 1984–85.

====Golden State Warriors====
Bol's first tenure with the Golden State Warriors lasted for two seasons, from 1988 to 1990. In his first season with Golden State, he first attempted three-point shots with regularity. In that season, he shot a career-high 91 three-pointers and made 20 of them. During this time, he may have helped to popularize the expression "[[wikt:my bad|my bad]]", although a 2005 suggestion that he coined the phrase has been discounted.&lt;ref name="Pullum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002693.html|title=Language Log: Pick-up basketballism reaches Ivy League faculty vocabulary|last=Pullum|first=Geoffrey K. |authorlink=Geoff Pullum |date=7 December 2005|accessdate=2010-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/2327/|title=The Manute Bol Theory of "My Bad"|last=Zimmer|first=Ben |authorlink=Ben Zimmer |date=22 June 2010|work=Word Routes|publisher=Thinkmap Visual Thesaurus|accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philadelphia 76ers====
Bol's first tenure with the Philadelphia 76ers lasted for three seasons, from 1990 to 1993. Although he played in a career-high 82 games in his first season as a 76er, his production began to decline afterward (in both games played and per-game statistics). After playing in all 82 games in [[1990–91 NBA season|1990–1991]], he played in 71 games the [[1991–92 NBA season|next season]], and in 58 (a career low at the time) games the [[1992–93 NBA season|following season]]. During his last season in Philadelphia, he had a memorable night playing against former teammate [[Charles Barkley]] and the Phoenix Suns, hitting 6 of 12 three-pointers, all in the second half in a losing effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Philadelphia 76ers at Phoenix Suns Box Score, March 3, 1993 |work = Basketball Reference.com |publisher = Sports Reference |url = https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/PHO19930303.html |accessdate = 2012-12-10 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071216132101/http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/PHO19930303.html |archivedate = December 16, 2007 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans were known to yell out "shoot" as soon as Bol received the ball far from the basket.&lt;ref&gt;Kerry Eggers, "Around the League", The Sunday Oregonian, March 7, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

====Miami Heat====
Bol played in eight games in the [[1993–94 NBA season|1993–1994 season]] with the [[Miami Heat]], the only team that did not use him as a starter.  He scored only one two-point field goal with the team and blocked six shots in 61 total minutes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bolma01.html|title=Manute Bol Stats {{!}} Basketball-Reference.com|website=Basketball-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Washington Bullets (2nd stint)====
Bol's second stint with the Bullets lasted only two games in 1993–1994. After this, he helped develop fellow 7&amp;nbsp;ft 7 teammate [[Gheorghe Mureșan]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Philadelphia 76ers (2nd stint)====
Bol's second stint with the 76ers lasted for four games, near the end of the 1993–1994 season, helping to mentor {{height|ft=7|in=6}} teammate [[Shawn Bradley]]. In only 49 minutes, he played more aggressively than he did earlier in the season with Miami and Washington. He scored six points, grabbed six rebounds and blocked nine shots.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Golden State Warriors (2nd stint)====
In the [[1994–95 NBA season]], Bol returned to the Warriors.  He made the season-opening roster and played in what would be his final five NBA games. On a memorable night in the middle of November, Bol finally made his home debut, coming off of the bench to play 29 minutes against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Bol attempted three three-pointers in the fourth quarter, scoring all of them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bolma01/gamelog/1995/|title=Manute Bol 1994-95 Game Log {{!}} Basketball-Reference.com|website=Basketball-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Seven nights later in Charlotte, in a game that was nationally televised by [[Turner Network Television|TNT]], he was in the starting lineup again. By this time, two weeks into the season, his career seemed rejuvenated under Warrior head coach [[Don Nelson]]; he was again a defensive force, making threes and contributing as a starter to create matchup problems. After playing only ten minutes against the Hornets on November 22, 1994, he suffered a season-ending knee injury. Before he left the game, he recorded one block and two points and attempted a three-pointer in ten minutes of play.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Bol was waived by Golden State on February 15, 1995.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Shot blocking====
With his great height and very long limbs, Bol was one of the league's most imposing defensive presences. Along with setting the rookie shot-blocking record in 1985–86, over the course of his career, Bol tied for the NBA record for the most blocked shots in one half (11) and in one quarter (eight, twice).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Regular Season Records: Blocked Shots |work = NBA Encyclopedia |publisher = National Basketball Association |url = http://www.nba.com/history/records/regular_blockedshots.html |accessdate = 2012-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On {{Dts|1992|January|31}}, in a game against the [[Orlando Magic]], he blocked four consecutive shots within a single possession.&lt;ref name="FSN"&gt;{{cite episode |title = Manute Bol: Beyond the Glory |episodelink = |url = |series = |serieslink = |credits = |network = FOX Sports Net |station = |city = |airdate = Apr 17, 2005 |began = |ended = |season = |seriesno = |number = |minutes = |transcript = |transcripturl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his career, he blocked a shot an average of every 5.6 minutes of playing time.&lt;ref name="SI 01"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Anderson |first = Kelli |title = Manute Bol: Once the NBA's premier shot blocker, the Sudanese Sultan of Swat has tried to bring peace to his homeland |journal = Sports Illustrated |volume = |issue = |pages = |date = Jul 2, 2001 |url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1022915/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Bol's other basketball skills were very limited, and his rail-thin physique made it difficult for him to establish position against the league's bulkier centers and power forwards. The sight of the tall, gangly Bol spotting up for a three-pointer during blow-outs became a fan favorite. Off the court, he established a reputation as a practical joker; Charles Barkley, a frequent victim of his pranks, attested to Bol's sense of humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Narducci | first = Marc | title = Tough Time for a Tall Guy His sense of humor could be a help to Manute Bol as he seeks to recover his health after a serious car crash. | publisher = Philly.com | date = Jul 8, 2005 | url = http://articles.philly.com/2004-07-18/sports/25371302_1_manute-bol-neville-h-robinson-sixers }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bol also developed a close friendship with Warriors teammate [[Chris Mullin (basketball)|Chris Mullin]] and named one of his sons after him.

====Career accomplishments====
Over the course of his career, Bol averaged 2.6 points, 4.2 rebounds, 0.3 assists, and 3.3 blocks per game, while only playing an average of 18.7 minutes per game. Bol finished his career with totals of 1,599 points, 2,647 rebounds, and 2,086 blocks, having appeared in 624 games over 10 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = basketball-reference.com |title = Manute Bol |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bolma01.html |accessdate = 2008-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, Manute Bol remains:
* First in career blocks per 48 minutes (8.6), almost 50% beyond second-place [[Mark Eaton (basketball)|Mark Eaton]] (5.8).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Career Leaders for Blocks Per 48 Minute |work = Basketball Reference.com |publisher = Sports Reference |url = https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;type=per_minute&amp;per_minute_base=48&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;year_min=1947&amp;year_max=2010&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;lg_id=&amp;franch_id=&amp;is_active=&amp;is_hof=&amp;pos=&amp;qual=&amp;c1stat=mp&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=1000&amp;c2stat=&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=&amp;c3stat=&amp;c3comp=gt&amp;c3val=&amp;c4stat=&amp;c4comp=gt&amp;c4val=&amp;order_by=blk_per_mp |accessdate = 2012-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Fifteenth in total blocked shots (2,086).&lt;ref name="blk_career"&gt;{{cite web |title = Career Leaders and Records for Blocks |work = Basketball Reference.com |publisher = Sports Reference |url = https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/BLK_career.html |accessdate = 2012-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The only player in NBA history to block more shots than points scored, blocking 2,086 shots and scoring 1,599 points.&lt;ref name="blk_career"/&gt;

===After the NBA===
After the end of his NBA career, Bol played 22 games for the Florida Beach Dogs of the [[Continental Basketball Association]] during the 1995–1996 season. The Beach Dogs' games against the [[Sioux Falls Skyforce]] in that season were broadcast by [[ESPN]], as the Skyforce also featured a former NBA player, [[Darryl Dawkins]]. In 1996, the Portland (Maine) Mountain Cats of the [[United States Basketball League]] announced that he would be playing with the team, and included him in the team program, but he never appeared in uniform. He then played professionally in Italy in 1997 and had a stint in [[Qatar]] in 1998 before [[rheumatism]] forced him to retire permanently.&lt;ref name="SI 01"/&gt;

==Activism==
Bol was very active in charitable causes throughout his career. In fact, he said he spent much of the money he made during a 10-year NBA career supporting various causes related to the war-ravaged nation of his birth, Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zumoff |first=Marc |title=Catching up with Manute Bol |journal=Drive |volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher=NBA Media Ventures |url=http://www.nba.com/sixers/features/drive_manute_bol_070807.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215162830/http://www.nba.com/sixers/features/drive_manute_bol_070807.html |archivedate=2007-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He frequently visited Sudanese refugee camps, where he was treated like royalty. In 2001, Bol was offered a post as minister of sport by the Sudanese government. Bol, who was a Christian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Shields |first = Jon A. |title = Manute Bol's radical Christianity |newspaper = The Wall Street Journal |pages = |date = Jun 25, 2010 |url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704853404575323043046894012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; refused because one of the conditions was converting to [[Islam]].&lt;ref name="focusdep.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Luo |first=Michael |title=NBA Star Now Refugee |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.focusdep.com/articles/Society/NBA_Star_Now_Refugee |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223041640/http://www.focusdep.com/articles/Society/NBA_Star_Now_Refugee |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-02-23 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Bol was hindered from leaving the country by the Sudanese government, who accused him of supporting the Dinka-led Christian rebels, the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]]. The Sudanese government refused to grant him an exit visa unless he came back with more money. Assistance by supporters in the United States, including [[Connecticut]] Senator [[Joseph Lieberman]], raised money to provide Bol with plane tickets to Cairo, Egypt. After 6 months of negotiations with U.S. consulate officials regarding refugee status, Bol and his family were finally able to leave Egypt and return to the United States.&lt;ref name="focusdep.com"/&gt;

Bol established the [[Ring True Foundation]] to continue fund-raising for [[Sudanese refugees]]. He gave most of his earnings (an estimated $3.5 million) to their cause. In 2002, [[Fox TV]] agreed to broadcast the telephone number of his Ring True Foundation in exchange for Bol's agreement to appear on their ''[[Celebrity Boxing]]'' show. After the referee goaded, "If you guys don't box, you won't get paid", he scored a third-round victory over former [[American football|football]] player [[William Perry (American football)|William "The Refrigerator" Perry]].

In the fall of 2002, Bol signed a one-day contract with the [[Indianapolis Ice]] of the [[Central Hockey League]]. Though he could not skate, the publicity generated by his single-game appearance helped raise money to assist children in Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jon C.|last=Scott|title=Hockey Night in Dixie: Minor Pro Hockey in the American South|year=2006|publisher=Heritage House Publishing Company Ltd.|page=184|isbn = 1-894974-21-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bol once suited up as a horse jockey for similar reasons.

Bol was involved in the April 2006 [[Sudan Freedom Walk]], a three-week march from the [[United Nations]] building in New York City to the [[United States Capitol]] in Washington, DC. The event was organized by [[Simon Deng]], a former Sudanese swimming champion (currently a lifeguard at [[Coney Island]]), who was a longtime friend of Bol's. Deng, who was a [[Slavery|slave]] for three years from the age of nine, is from another tribe in Southern Sudan. His Sudan Freedom Walk is especially aimed at finding a solution to the [[genocide]] in [[Darfur]] (western Sudan), but it also seeks to raise awareness of the modern-day slavery and human-rights abuses throughout Sudan. Bol spoke in New York City at the start of the walk, and in [[Philadelphia]] at a rally organized by former hunger striker [[Nathan Kleinman]].

Bol was also an advocate for reconciliation efforts, and worked to improve education in South Sudan. A Nicholas Kristoff article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/opinion/24kristof.html?_r=3&amp;ref=nicholasdkristof |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Nicholas D. |last=Kristof |title=Most Valuable Helper |date=Jun 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''The New York Times'' highlighted this belief and Bol's work for reconciliation and education with an organization called [[Sudan Sunrise]]. Bol first began working with Sudan Sunrise to raise awareness on issues of reconciliation in 2005. This included speaking at the United States Capitol in Washington, DC, and subsequently partnering with Sudan Sunrise to build schools across South Sudan that, in the spirit of reconciliation, would enroll students regardless of tribe or religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Manute Bol School |work = Current Projects in South Sudan |publisher = Sudan Sunrise |url = http://www.sudansunrise.org/project/manute-bol-school |accessdate = 2012-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in Egypt, Bol ran a basketball school in [[Cairo]]. One of his pupils was a fellow Sudanese refugee, [[Los Angeles Lakers]] player [[Luol Deng]], the son of a former Sudanese cabinet minister. Deng later moved to the United States to further his basketball career, continuing a close relationship with Bol.

==Life after basketball==
Despite initially knowing little English and an absence of awareness regarding Western culture, Bol adjusted and was widely regarded as a well-rounded personality who was inquisitive and well-read. He developed a strong friendship with Charles Barkley, who remarked, "If everyone in the world was a Manute Bol, it's a world I'd want to live in. He's smart. He reads ''The New York Times''. He knows what's going on in a lot of subjects. He's not one of these just-basketball guys".&lt;ref name="SI 90"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Montville |first = Leigh |title = A Tall Story: Manute Bol, the Sixers' 7'7" center, views life from a unique perspective |journal = Sports Illustrated |volume = |issue = |pages = |date = Dec 17, 1990 |url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1136052/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke [[Dinka language|Dinka]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] before mastering English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Lidz |first = Franz |title = Come See The Dinka Dunker Do: Manute Bol, an import from Sudan, is giving a 7'6" lift to Bridgeport |journal = Sports Illustrated |volume = |issue = |pages = |date = Dec 10, 1984 |url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1122922/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a political dispute in Sudan, Bol was admitted to the United States as a religious refugee in 2002 and settled in [[West Hartford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="WaPo obit"/&gt; In July 2004, he was seriously injured in a car accident in [[Colchester, Connecticut|Colchester]] when he was ejected from a taxi that hit a guardrail and overturned, resulting in a broken neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fox|first1=Tracy Gordon|last2=Farrell|first2=Jim|title=Bol critically injured in car accident|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1914&amp;dat=20040702&amp;id=GxAqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nmQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1174,283134|accessdate=8 July 2014|work=The Hartford Courant|date=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The driver was under the influence, with a suspended license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://compuserve.nba.com/sixers/features/manute_bol_060822.html|title=Where Are They Now: Manute Bol|publisher=|accessdate=27 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709140413/http://compuserve.nba.com/sixers/features/manute_bol_060822.html|archivedate=9 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because his fortunes were mostly donated to Sudan, he was financially ruined because he had no health insurance.&lt;ref name="FSN"/&gt; When he recovered from his injuries, he moved to [[Olathe, Kansas]].&lt;ref name="WaPo obit"/&gt;

Bol was also the "Brand Ambassador" for [[Ethiopian Airlines]] and Ethiopian Airlines Journeys.

One of Bol's sons, Madut (born December 19, 1989), played college basketball at [[Southern Jaguars basketball|Southern University]] and graduated from college in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/2010-06-29-manute-bol-funeral_N.htm|title=Manute Bol remembered as 'also a giant off the court' at funeral|date=June 29, 2010|work=USA Today|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another son, [[Bol Bol]], is a {{height|ft=7|in=3}}-tall 12th grader as of January 2018 and played basketball for [[Findlay Prep]] in [[Henderson, Nevada]], after first transferring from [[Bishop Miege High School]] in [[Roeland Park, Kansas]], to [[Mater Dei High School (Santa Ana, California)|Mater Dei]] in [[Santa Ana, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatodayhss.com/2014/manute-bols-son-bol-bol-is-dominating-jv-hoops-in-kansas |title=Manute Bol's son, Bol Bol, is dominating JV hoops in Kansas |last=Smith |first=Cam |date=12 December 2014 |website=usatodayhss.com |publisher=USA Today High School Sports |access-date=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bol Bol is considered a top recruit for the class of 2018 and committed to join the [[Oregon Ducks men's basketball|Oregon Ducks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theplayerstribune.com/bol-bol-oregon-ducks-basketball/|title=Shoes to Fill {{!}} By Bol Bol|website=The Players' Tribune|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bol's nephew [[Peter Jok]] previously played basketball at the [[University of Iowa]] and currently plays for the [[Northern Arizona Suns]] of the [[NBA G League]].

On June 19, 2010, Bol died from [[acute kidney failure]] and complications from [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]] at the [[University of Virginia Health System|University of Virginia Medical Center]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="WaPo obit"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schudel|first=Matt |title=Manute Bol, former Washington Bullet and one of NBA's tallest players, dies at 47|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/19/AR2010061902214.html|accessdate=19 June 2010|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.pitch.com/plog/2010/06/manute_bol_retired_basketball_player_has_died.php |title=Manute Bol, retired basketball player, has died |last=Kendall |first=Justin |date=June 19, 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-19 |publisher=The Pitch |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622032557/http://blogs.pitch.com/plog/2010/06/manute_bol_retired_basketball_player_has_died.php |archivedate=June 22, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his 10 children, six &lt;!--(Madut, Chris, Abuk, and Akak)--&gt; with his first wife, Along, and four with his second wife, Ajok.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = McGeehan  |first = Patrick |title = Manute Bol, N.B.A. Player and Activist, Dies at 47 |newspaper = The New York Times |pages = |date = Jun 19, 2010 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/sports/basketball/20bol.html?scp=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funeral service and tribute==
[[File:Manute Bol's funeral at National Cathedral 2010-06-29 1.jpg|thumb|Bol's memorial service at the National Cathedral]]

The memorial service for Manute Bol was held on Tuesday, June 29, 2010, at 10:00&amp;nbsp;am at the National Cathedral in Washington, DC. Bol's body lay in an eight-foot-long, specially built casket.&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5j4CZIgXsXmROD8dYFKNNhS3BpA2w] {{dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bol was given tributes by United States Senator [[Sam Brownback]] from Kansas, former National Security Advisor [[Robert McFarlane]], Sudan's Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Akec Khoc Acieu, Bol's uncle Bol Bol Chol, and vice president of the [[National Basketball Players Association]] [[Rory Sparrow]].&lt;ref name="google.com" /&gt;

Sparrow remembered Bol as "a giant off the court", who should be remembered for humanitarian work and his basketball career.&lt;ref name="google.com" /&gt; Senator Brownback recalled, "He literally gave his life for his people. He went over [to Sudan], he was sick. He stayed longer than he should have. He probably contracted this ailment that took his life while in Sudan, and he didn't have to do that. He was an NBA basketball player. He could have stayed here and had an easy life. I've never seen anybody use his celebrity status more nor give his life more completely to a group of people than Manute Bol did. It makes me look at efforts that I do as not enough."

Dr. Akec K.A. Khoc, Ambassador of Sudan to the U.S., said, "Manute had a very great heart for his country and people. He did everything to support anybody in need of shoes, blankets, health service, food, and people who were struggling. He went to see them and to encourage them to continue their struggle for their rights, for their freedoms. Manute embodied everything we can think of in Sudan. Reconciling warring groups between the north and south, in Darfur he was working for reconciliation between Darfur and the south and between Darfur and the rest of Sudan. So, Manute was a voice for hope."

[[Sudan Sunrise]] founder, Tom Prichard, says Bol's work to reconcile former enemies lives on. "Manute's legacy and vision of education and reconciliation, his determination to grow [[grassroots]] reconciliation—whether that reconciliation is expressed in a country that divides or holds together, wherever the boundary lines are drawn. Manute stood for grassroots reconciliation."&lt;ref name="www1.voanews.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=Dignitaries, Friends Say Farewell to NBA's Manute Bol |publisher=VOA News |date=Jun 28, 2010 |url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/africa/Dignitaries-Friends-say-Farewell-to-NBA-Manute-Bol-97432534.html |accessdate=2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prichard went on to say "There's no question Manute gave his life for his country."&lt;ref name="kansascity.com"&gt;http://www.kansascity.com/2010/06/22/2036636/nba-legend-spent-his-life-helping.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kansascity.com" /&gt;

Manute Bol's family [[patriarch]], Bol Bol Chol, said, "This man is not an ordinary man. I believe this man is a messenger like other messengers who were sent into this world—to do something in this world. He has accomplished most of his mission, and so God took him and left the rest of the work to be done by others."&lt;ref name="www1.voanews.com" /&gt;

Bol is buried in [[South Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kmbc.com/news/24214449/detail.html|title=Memorial To Honor Manute Bol|publisher=|accessdate=27 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307131045/http://www.kmbc.com/news/24214449/detail.html|archivedate=7 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary McCarthy Gomez Cueto''' (April 27, 1900 – April 3, 2009) was the widow of a wealthy Cuban businessman who died in poverty, unwilling to leave the island and unable to access her funds because of the [[US embargo on trade with Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/national/obituaries/the-widow-who-withstood-castro-with-determination-and-prayer-20090409-a29n.html "The widow who withstood Castro with determination and prayer" ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', April 10, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;  After her husband's death in 1951, and following the takeover of the Island under a [[Communist]] [[regime]], she had become an [[anachronism]], and ended her life in poverty, bereft of her wealth due to the U.S. embargo, and granted a tiny pension by the [[Castro government]]. A victim of political circumstance, she died there at the age of 108, and was buried next to her husband.

==Early years==
Born Mary Conception McCarthy in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], she was the daughter of a St. John's merchant of Irish descent. Her father's (Thomas McCarthy) store supplied the local fishing fleets with stores and supplies. As a young student she studied with the [[Sisters of Mercy]], where she was quickly identified as a musical talent. As a young woman, furthering her studies in Boston, she met Pedro Gomez Cueto, a Spanish businessman. A smitten Gomez Cueto accompanied Mary back to St. John's to ask her father for permission to marry his daughter. Thomas McCarthy questioned his daughter's desire to marry the considerably older wealthy Spaniard. As a compromise he required Mary to stay at home and Gomez Cueto to go away for one year. If after that time they still wished to marry, he would give his blessing.

They married and settled in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]] in 1923, becoming part of the wealthy enclave enjoying the life of the rich and famous.

==Life in Cuba==
Cueto was in the business of exporting leather goods to South America, but in Cuba he made his fortune making military boots for the United States in the Second World War. He built his wife a white mansion in 1936 called Villa Mary, which became their home. It was filled with [[Napoleon III furniture]] and chandeliers, and a Steinway grand piano, becoming a gathering place for visiting artists and singers, such as [[Frank Sinatra]] (who had a house behind hers) and [[Nat King Cole]]. In those days, under the rule of President [[Fulgencio Batista]], the island was known as "a millionaires' paradise".  They became part of local society, and helped to found the Havana Philharmonic Orchestra and an orphanage for boys. Then in 1951 her husband died, and her life changed drastically under [[Fidel Castro's revolution]] of 1959.

The US imposed a trade embargo against Cuba in 1962, causing her U.S. bank account of about 4 million dollars to be frozen. Unable to touch her money,  things became worse when Castro confiscated her island holdings, and granted her a monthly pension of 200 pesos (about $15). While free to return to her native Canada, or the United States, she vowed never to leave the Island, for that was her home. Despite trips back to St. John's where parties would be held for her, she felt that the weather was too cold.  And so this native Canadian continued to live in Cuba in poverty, a relic from days gone by.

Her neighbors had left the island long before, and their mansions were converted into embassy residences. Peacocks continued to strut under the palm trees in her large garden. The mansion now still retains the elegance and graceful atmosphere that Mary so carefully maintained for more than seven decades.

==Later years==
In 2002 she broke her hip and used a wheelchair, but continued to wear a satin dress, [[silk blouse]], chiffon scarf and lipstick to greet her visitors.

With the need for more money due to her medical problems, some measure of relief came in 2007 through a Canadian diplomat. Washington allowed her to draw from her inheritance $96 a month.  "I don't even want to buy candy," she declared in her distinctive [[Newfoundland Irish]] accent.  Mary's caregiver was godson Elio, who lived with Mary and looked after her night and day for several decades.  Sadly, each time Mary was hospitalized in the Havana medical facilities set aside for tourists, Elio had to seek the help of the Government of Canada to intervene and free up Mary's own money from a frozen U.S. account to pay the medical bills, on a case-by-case basis.

Reminders of her long life were on the walls where framed telegrams hung from [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Pope John Paul II]], congratulating her on her 100th birthday, and photographs on the table showed her with the conductor [[Sir Thomas Beecham]] and the guitarist [[Andrés Segovia]].

Asked whether she approved of [[Fidel Castro]] and his revolution, she did concede that poverty and illiteracy ended with his rule.

==Death==
She died on Friday, April 3, 2009, just 24 days short of her 109th birthday, and was buried next to her husband in a white marble crypt in the [[Necropolis Cristóbal Colón]], in Havana.

}}

'''Nicolae Bălcescu''' ({{IPA-ro|nikoˈla.e bəlˈt͡ʃesku}}) (29 June 1819 – 29 November 1852) was a [[Romanians|Romanian]] [[Wallachia]]n soldier, historian, journalist, and leader of the [[1848 Wallachian Revolution]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Bucharest]] to a family of low-ranking nobility, he used his mother's maiden name, in place of his father's name, ''Petrescu'' (his mother was originally from [[Bălcești]], [[Vâlcea County]] now, then [[Argeș County]]). His siblings were Costache, [[Barbu Bălcescu|Barbu]], Sevasta and Marghioala, and his father died in 1824.

As a boy, Bălcescu studied at the [[Saint Sava College]] (from 1832), and was a passionate student of history. At the age of 19, he joined the [[Wallachian Army]], and, in 1840, took part, alongside [[Eftimie Murgu]] and [[Cezar Bolliac]], in [[Mitică Filipescu]]'s [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] against Prince [[Alexandru II Ghica]]. The plot was uncovered, and Bălcescu was imprisoned in [[Mărgineni Monastery]], where he remained for the following two years. The rough imprisonment conditions left irreversible marks on Bălcescu's health.

Upon his release (after being granted a [[pardon]] by the new prince, [[Gheorghe Bibescu]]), he took part in forming a [[secret society]] drawn up from the [[Freemasonry]]{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} and named ''Frăția'' ("The Brotherhood"), which he led together with [[Ion Ghica]] and [[Christian Tell]] (joined soon after by [[Gheorghe Magheru]]) in resistance against Prince Bibescu.

==''Magazin istoric pentru Dacia'' and other early works==
[[Image:Magazin istoric pentru Dacia - 1845.png|thumb|230px|First page of ''Magazin istoric pentru Dacia'', Volume I, 1845]]
In order to further his history studies, Bălcescu went to France and Italy, and was, together with [[August Treboniu Laurian]], the editor of a magazine entitled ''Magazin istoric pentru Dacia'', which was first published in 1844; that year also marked the publishing (in a different magazine) of his historical essay ''Puterea armată și arta militară de la întemeierea Prințipatului Valahiei și până acum'' ("The Military Strength and Art of Warfare from the Creation of the Wallachian Principality to This Day", which argued for a strong military as a guarantee of [[self-determination]]).

While in Paris (1846), he became leader of the [[Romantic nationalism|Romantic nationalists]] and [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal-radical]] group ''Societatea studenților români'' (the Society of Romanian Students), which reunited Wallachians and [[Moldavia]]ns &amp;mdash; it also included [[Ion Brătianu]], [[Alexandru C. Golescu]], [[Ion Ionescu de la Brad]], [[C. A. Rosetti]], and [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]].

''Magazin istoric'' went on to publish the very first collection of internal sources on the history of Wallachia and Moldavia - medieval [[chronicle]]s which were afterwards published as a single volume. One of his contributions to the magazine singles him out as a radical liberal: ''Despre starea socială a muncitorilor plugari în Principatele Române în deosebite timpuri'' ("On the Social Status of the Ploughmen of the [[Danubian Principalities|Romanian Principalities]] at Various Times") argues for a [[land reform]], aimed at dispossessing the [[boyars]] of large plots of land (that would in turn be awarded to landless peasants); it was used as reference by [[Karl Marx]] in his succinct analysis of the events, a fact which was to earn Bălcescu credentials in [[Communist Romania]].

==Wallachian Revolution==
{{Main article|Wallachian Revolution of 1848}}
In 1848, after taking part in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|uprising in France]], Bălcescu returned to [[Bucharest]] in order to take part in the 11 June revolution. He was, for just two days, both [[political minister|Minister]] and [[Secretary of State]] of the [[provisional government]] put in place by the revolutionaries. His advocacy of [[universal suffrage]] and land reform was not shared by many revolutionaries, and his group came into conflict with the traditional figures of authority - the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Metropolitan of Hungro-Wallachia|Metropolitan]] {{Interlanguage link multi|Neofit II|ro|3=Neofit al II-lea}}, although head of the revolutionary government, opposed the reforms and ultimately conspired against the Revolution itself.

Bălcescu was arrested on 13 September that year by the authorities of the [[Ottoman Empire]] who had put an end to the Revolution; his relationship with the Ottomans was complicated by the fact that the radicals' strict opposition to [[Imperial Russia]] had made them reliable for the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] - the Ottomans later allowed all participants in the events to take refuge in [[Istanbul]], and thus avoid contact with the Russian troops sent over to assist the Ottoman presence. Bălcescu initially made his way to [[Transylvania]], but was expelled by [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] authorities, who considered him a threat and an agitator of Romanian sentiment in that region.

==In Istanbul and Transylvania==
In early 1849, Bălcescu was in Istanbul when the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas#Revolution in the Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian revolutionary armies]] under [[Józef Bem]] mounted a successful offensive against Habsburg forces and their Transylvanian Romanian allies. The Hungarian government of [[Lajos Kossuth]] then entered a debilitating war with [[Avram Iancu]]'s Romanian [[Guerilla warfare|guerilla force]], and the former members of the Wallachian government were approached by the [[Wielkopolska Uprising (1848)|Polish revolutionaries]] in exile, such as [[Henryk Dembiński]], to mediate a peace between the two sides (in the hope that this was to ensure a stronger resistance to Russia, and counting on the Wallachian resentment towards the [[Saint Petersburg]] government).

Bălcescu left for [[Debrecen]] in May, and met with Kossuth to register the latter's offer to Iancu. [[Marxism|Marxist]]-inspired historiography has celebrated this as an agreement; in fact, Bălcescu's papers reveal that he viewed the peace offering as unsatisfactory for Romanians, and that Avram Iancu rejected it altogether (while agreeing to a temporary [[armistice]]). The final offer from the [[Budapest]] leadership to Bălcescu and Iancu called for the Romanians to withdraw from Transylvania, as the region was turning into a battleground between Russia and the Hungarians. When this latter conflict drew to a close, the Romanians in Transylvania, although never particularly welcoming of the Russian presence, surrendered their weapons to the reinstated Habsburgs (Iancu's loyalty to the dynasty had been the subject of a parallel dispute between him and the Wallachians).

==Final years==
[[Image:Nobalcescu.jpg|thumb|Bălcescu's bust in Palermo]]
Bălcescu's most important work is ''Românii supt Mihai-Voievod Viteazul'' ("Romanians under the Rule of [[Michael the Brave]]"), which he wrote in exile in 1849 - first published posthumously by [[Alexandru Odobescu]] in 1860. The volume is history of Michael's campaigns, as the first moment when Wallachia, Transylvania, and Moldavia, came under a single, albeit brief rule. They show Bălcescu's commitment to both radicalism and [[nationalism]], his view oscillating between praise of Michael's gestures and criticism of his stance as a supporter of [[serfdom]] and [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]].

His final years saw an intense publishing activity, including his study, written in French, {{lang|fr|Question économique des Principautés Danubiennes}}, as well as a collaboration with [[Adam Mickiewicz]] on ''[[La Tribune des Peuples]]''. Stricken by [[tuberculosis]], impoverished, and constantly moving between various locations in France and the [[Italian Peninsula]], he died in [[Palermo]] (in the [[Two Sicilies]]) at 33 years of age. Bălcescu never married, though he and his lover Alexandra Florescu had a son, [[Bonifaciu Florescu]] (1848–1899), who became a professor of French language and literature.

==Nationalization of his properties==
{{Confusing section|date=January 2013}}
In the present his properties remain nationalized by the [[Romanian Government]] 2011, after 1945, as [[Bălcesti Giltofani Land]] in [[Bălcești]] which in the present is [[Nicolae Bălcescu Museum]], taken from Bălcescu's family member [[Radu Mandrea]] and [[Aristide Razu]], in 1948 by a "donation act" towards the Communist Government, in [[Romania]], in [[Vâlcea County]].

Also his earthly remains, remain in [[Palermo]], Italy, although the [[Communist Party of Romania]] tried to bring them back to Romania in 1970, to use them for communist propaganda.  The [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] Monks in Palermo at the [[Capuchin Monastery]], also known as [[Capuchin catacombs of Palermo]], denied to the [[Romanian Communist Delegation of Historians]] access to the grave.

'''Reftarıdil Kadın''' (5 June 1838&amp;nbsp;– 3 March 1936) was the second wife of Sultan [[Murad V]].

==Biography==
Reftarıdil Kadın was born in 1838 to an [[Abzakh people|Abadzekh]] notable, Hatkoyuko Hatko.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Günay Günaydın|title=Haremin son gülleri|url=https://books.google.com/books?BAAAAIAAJ|year=2006|publisher=Mevsimsiz Yayınları|isbn=978-9944-987-03-5}}{{pn|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her family used to live at the coast of [[Black Sea]]. She had two sisters Terandil Hanım and Ceylanmelek Hanım who were also given to the palace along with her and were later married to other high officials. She was a lovely lady with a pink skin, large blue eyes, straight nose, and a round face. She was also honest and goodhearted.

However, in the later years Reftarıdil was noticed by Şehzade Murad (future Sultan [[Murad V]]) and he married her as his second wife on 4 February 1859 in the [[Dolmabahçe Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bir Çerkes prensesinin harem hatıraları|url=https://books.google.com/books?qGAtAQAAIAAJ|year=2004|publisher=L &amp; M|isbn=978-975-6491-31-7}}{{pn|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She gave birth two sons, [[Mehmed Selaheddin|Şehzade Mehmed Selaheddin Efendi]] in 1861 and Şehzade Suleiman Efendi in 1866 who died in infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~royalty/turkey/persons.html |title=Genealogy of the Ottoman Royal Family}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became [[Kadınefendi|İkinci Kadın]] (The Second Imperial Lady Consort) on 30 May 1876 when her husband ascended the throne as Sultan [[Murad V]]. After the abdication of her husband in the [[Çırağan Palace]] and his death in 1904, she along with other members of Murad's family were still imprisoned in the palace. In 1910 her son, Şehzade Selaheddin Efendi bought a mansion at [[Ortaköy]].

In 1934 "Reftarıdil" took the surname "Hatgil". She had her niece, Cemile Dilberistan Hanımefendi, married to her son, Şehzade Selaheddin Efendi. She died in [[Ortaköy|Ortaköy Palace]], [[Istanbul]] on 3 March 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://4dw.net/royalark/|title=The Royal Ark – Royal and Ruling Houses of Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Americas|publisher=4dw.net|author=Christopher Buyers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''UC3 Nautilus''''' is a privately built Danish [[midget submarine]]. It was built over a three-year period as an art project by [[Peter Madsen (inventor)|Peter Madsen]] and a group of volunteers, and cost approximately [[United States dollar|US$]]200,000 to build (1.5 million [[Danish krone|DKK]]). The submarine was Madsen's third submarine design, and at the time of launch on 3 May 2008, was the largest privately built submarine in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://jp.dk/indland/kbh/article1331560.ece |title=Verdens største privatbyggede ubåd søsættes i København  |trans-title=The world's largest privately built submarine launched in Copenhagen |work=[[Jyllandsposten]] |accessdate=6 July 2010|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.berlingske.dk/danmark/klar-til-dykning |title=Klar til dykning |trans-title=Ready for diving |work=[[Berlingske Tidende]] |accessdate=6 July 2010|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 August 2017, ''Nautilus'' sank in the bay of [[Køge]], in what investigators determined was a deliberate act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.b.dk/nationalt/ubaaden-uc3-nautilus-er-sunket-passagererne-er-kommet-i-land-og-er-i-god-behold  |title=Ubåden »UC3 Nautilus« er sunket: Passagererne er kommet i land og er i god behold |work=[[Berlingske]] |accessdate=11 August 2017 |language=da }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/aug/13/submarine-maker-held-as-search-for-kim-wall-continues |title=Submarine in missing journalist case sunk on purpose, Danish police say |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=23 August 2017 |language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, [[Danish police]] had the submarine salvaged and brought onto land as part of the investigation of the death of Swedish journalist [[Murder of Kim Wall|Kim Wall]], who was last seen alive on board.&lt;ref name=dr_2017_08_12&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/kranskib-haever-sunket-ubaad-op-til-overfladen |website= [[dr.dk]] |title= Kranskib hæver sunket ubåd op til overfladen |first= Anders Holm |last= Nielsen |date= 12 August 2017 |accessdate= 12 August 2017 |language= da |trans-title= Crane ship brings sunken submarine back to the surface}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the conviction of Madsen for Wall's murder, the submarine was confiscated and is awaiting destruction.&lt;ref name="Nordjyske 25 April"/&gt;

==Launch==
On the day of its launch on 3 May 2008, ''UC3 Nautilus'' displaced only 32 tons and was still incomplete. It was named at a well-attended ceremony on the west side of [[Refshaleøen]] and towed to the floating [[installation art]] [[barge]] ''Illutron'' (formerly M/S ''Half Machine'') in the [[Kongens Enghave]], where further outfitting and installation of equipment took place over the next several months. By August 2008, ''Nautilus'' could sail on its own, as the main diesel engine [[drive train]] and steering was completed. On its [[maiden voyage]], the submarine was driven by former crewmen of the now-defunct&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective was to sail ''Nautilus'' and evaluate her maneuverability, and the appraisal was favourable. In October 2008, Nautilus was submerged for the first time.&lt;ref name=ing/&gt;

==Specifications==
{{refimprove|section|date=April 2018}}
''Nautilus'' can be crewed by up to eight people for surface operation and four when diving. The submarine moves at five to six [[Knot (unit)|knots]], depending on conditions and whether it was submerged. It has two {{convert|1500|l|usgal}} tanks for fresh water and fuel. [[Trim (attitude)|Trim]] is carried out normally with an electric pump, or with compressed air as fall-back if the trim-pump fails. The main ballast tanks of {{convert|8,000|l|usgal}} are filled and emptied with compressed air and can flush up to {{convert|400|l|usgal}} of water in/out per second. It can descend to [[periscope depth]] in approximately 20 seconds.&lt;ref name=ing/&gt; The boat has a design [[crush depth]] of {{convert|400|-|500|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and has dived to about {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

There are 16 portholes (8 on each side, 2 oversized) for direct observation. The periscope has five video cameras, providing 360-degree panoramic vision on video screens in the forward control room. The engine room has two diesel engines, one of which is for direct propulsion. The other drives a three-phase electric generator providing power for the onboard air compressor and battery charger. There are more than a tonne of large 12-volt batteries on board, supplying the DC electric motor which can be operated alone or in tandem with the main engine on a chain-coupled drive for turning the 80 kilogram, five-bladed brass propeller. Joystick-controlled electric servos operate the rudder (aft) and [[diving plane|hydroplanes]] (front).

''Nautilus'' is much smaller than the Danish [[Kobben-class submarine]]. It is about half as long and half as wide, and moves at about half the speed. In early 2009, an automatic [[Submarine snorkel|snorkel]] system was installed so that the submarine can sail submerged on diesel power, and in August it sailed out from [[Køge]] submerged.&lt;ref name=ing/&gt;

The submarine can be operated by a single person from the control room. All controls and indicators are accessible from the captain's seat for controlling buoyancy, pumps, engines, air pressure, communication, video, and other electric systems. However, as of July 2010, the engine crew still needed to perform manual changeover from surface to dive-ready configuration, setting valves correctly for snorkel and diesel engine exhaust. ''Nautilus'' can function on her diesel engine for up to eight minutes underwater without her snorkel. The engine requires a steady supply of air to operate, unlike the electric motor, and using it while submerged drops the air pressure to the equivalent of {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, as the engine ingests air from the crew compartment unless the snorkel is used.&lt;ref name=ing/&gt;

==Missions==
On a 2009 trip around Refshaleøen, ''Nautilus'' was visited by a group of submarine fans from [[Subsim]]. Video game developers from [[Ubisoft]] were also on board to find inspiration for their submarine game, ''[[Silent Hunter 5]].''&lt;ref name=ing/&gt;

''Nautilus'' was used by her builders and various others for recreation and expeditions.&lt;ref name="ing"/&gt; One such expedition was the attempted launch of the rocket and spacecraft [[HEAT 1X Tycho Brahe]], built by Madsen's [[non-profit]] organization [[Copenhagen Suborbitals]]. On Tuesday 31 August 2010, the submarine pushed the launch platform ''Sputnik'', carrying the craft from Copenhagen towards the launch site near [[Nexø]], [[Bornholm]].&lt;ref name="ingtow"&gt;{{cite news | first=Mette Buck | last=Jensen |url= http://ing.dk/artikel/111523-nyt-fra-raket-holdet-vi-naar-nexoe-kl-2030 |website= [[Ing.dk]] |title=Nyt fra raket-holdet: Vi når Nexø kl. 20.30 |trans-title=News from the rocket-team: We will reach Nexø at 20.30 |language= Danish |date= 1 September 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100903235244/http://ing.dk/artikel/111523-nyt-fra-raket-holdet-vi-naar-nexoe-kl-2030 |archivedate=3 September 2010 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, ''Nautilus'' returned to Refshaleøen to be taken on shore for upgrades, then expected to last several months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first1=K.V. | last1=Bengtson| first2=P. | last2=Madsen |url= http://ing.dk/artikel/115824-en-sten-fra-mit-hjerte-vi-er-hjemme-igen |website= [[Ing.dk]] |title= En sten fra mit hjerte – vi er hjemme igen |language= Danish |date= 20 January 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110122085957/http://ing.dk/artikel/115824-en-sten-fra-mit-hjerte-vi-er-hjemme-igen |archivedate= 22 January 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 April 2017, ''Nautilus'' was launched again following repairs and upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rml.space/projects/submarines/uc3-nautilus |title=UC3 Nautilus |accessdate=2017-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814191413/http://rml.space/projects/submarines/uc3-nautilus |archivedate=14 August 2017 |publisher=rml.space |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sinking in 2017==

On 11 August 2017, ''Nautilus'' was scheduled to sail from Copenhagen to appear in the afternoon at an exhibit on Bornholm, but Madsen sent a text notifying the crew that the trip had been cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/ECE9783173/peter-madsen-aflyste-torsdag-aften-planlagt-ubaadstur-over-sms/ |website= [[jyllands-posten.dk]] |title= Peter Madsen aflyste torsdag aften planlagt ubådstur over sms |first= Emilie Holt |last= Vissing |date= 12 August 2017 |accessdate= 12 August 2017 |language= da |trans-title= Peter Madsen texts cancellation of planned submarine trip Thursday evening}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b_2017_08_12&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.b.dk/nationalt/drabssigtet-ubaadskaptajn-sendte-mystisk-sms-til-sin-besaetning |website= [[b.dk]] |title= Drabssigtet ubådskaptajn sendte mystisk SMS til sin besætning |first= Marianne |last= Fajstrup |date= 12 August 2017 |accessdate= 12 August 2017 |language= da |trans-title= Submarine captain charged with homicide sent mysterious text to his crew}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.b.dk/nationalt/ven-til-drabssigtet-ubaadsejer-der-er-intet-suspekt-ved-smser |website= b.dk |title= Ven til drabssigtet ubådsejer: Der er intet suspekt ved SMS'er |date= 12 August 2017 |accessdate= 12 August 2017 |language= da |trans-title= Friend of homicide charged submarine owner: Nothing suspicious about texts}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nautilus'' was reported missing early the following morning. Danish police visited a crew member to establish who was on board, and a large search operation was launched using helicopters and ships in the port of [[Øresund]], just outside the harbour of Copenhagen.&lt;ref name=b_2017_08_12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/forsvaret-leder-efter-privat-ubaad-frygter-den-er-sunket-i-oeresund |website= [[dr.dk]] |title=Forsvaret leder efter privat ubåd: Frygter den er sunket i Øresund |first=M.Ø. |last=Christensen |date= 11 August 2017 |language= da |trans-title=The Defence is looking for private submarine: Fear that it has sunken in Øresund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Hogarth''' [[FRSA]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|oʊ|g|ɑr|θ}}; 10 November 1697 – 26 October 1764) was an English painter, [[Printmaking|printmaker]], pictorial [[satire|satirist]], [[Social criticism|social critic]], and editorial [[cartoonist]]. His work ranged from [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] portraiture to [[comic strip]]-like series of pictures called "modern moral subjects",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dummies.com/education/art-appreciation/the-rococo-influence-in-british-art/|title=The Rococo Influence in British Art – dummies|work=dummies|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps best known being his moral series ''[[A Harlot's Progress]]'', ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' and ''[[Marriage A-la-Mode (Hogarth)|Marriage A-la-Mode]]''.  Knowledge of his work is so pervasive that satirical political illustrations in this style are often referred to as "Hogarthian".&lt;ref&gt;According to Elizabeth Einberg, "by the time he died in October 1764 he had left so indelible a mark on the history of British painting that the term 'Hogarthian' remains instantly comprehensible even today as a valid description of a wry, satirical perception of the human condition." See the exhibition catalog, ''Hogarth the Painter'', London: Tate Gallery, 1997, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogarth was born in [[London]] to a lower middle-class family. In his youth he took up an apprenticeship where he specialised in engraving. His father underwent periods of mixed fortune, and was at one time imprisoned in lieu of outstanding debts; an event that is thought to have informed William's paintings and prints with a hard edge.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth, vol. 1: The 'Modern Moral Subject', 1697–1732'' (New Brunswick 1991), pp. 26–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by French and Italian painting and engraving,&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Antal]], ''Hogarth and His Place in European Art'' (London 1962); Robin Simon, ''Hogarth, France and British Art: The rise of the arts in eighteenth-century Britain'' (London 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Hogarth's works are mostly satirical caricatures, sometimes bawdily sexual,&lt;ref&gt;Bernd W. Krysmanski, ''Hogarth's Hidden Parts: Satiric Allusion, Erotic Wit, Blasphemous Bawdiness and Dark Humour in Eighteenth-Century English Art'' (Hildesheim, Zurich and New York: Georg Olms 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; mostly of the first rank of realistic portraiture. They became widely popular and mass-produced via prints in his lifetime, and he was by far the most significant English artist of his generation.

==Early life==
[[File:William Hogarth by Roubiliac, 1741, National Portrait Gallery, London.JPG|thumb|upright|''William Hogarth'' by [[Roubiliac]], 1741, National Portrait Gallery, London]]
William Hogarth was born at Bartholomew Close in London to Richard Hogarth, a poor [[Latin]] school teacher and textbook writer, and Anne Gibbons. In his youth he was apprenticed to the engraver Ellis Gamble in [[Leicester Fields]], where he learned to engrave [[trade card]]s and similar products.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=6193 Ellis Gamble Biographical Details]. The British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. H. K. Wright. [https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2ulEAQAAMAAJ&amp;rdid=book-2ulEAQAAMAAJ&amp;rdot=1 The Journal of the Ex Libris Society, Volume 3] (A &amp; C. Black, Plymouth, 1894)&lt;/ref&gt;

Young Hogarth also took a lively interest in the street life of the metropolis and the London fairs, and amused himself by sketching the characters he saw.  Around the same time, his father, who had opened an unsuccessful Latin-speaking [[coffee house]] at [[St John's Gate]], was [[debtor prison|imprisoned for debt]] in [[Fleet Prison]] for five years. Hogarth never spoke of his father's imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth'', vol. 1 (New Brunswick 1991), pp. 26–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogarth became a member of the [[Rose and Crown Club]], with [[Peter Tillemans]], [[George Vertue]], [[Michael Dahl]], and other artists and connoisseurs.&lt;ref&gt;Coombs, Katherine, 'Lens [Laus] family (per. c. 1650–1779), artists' in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (Oxford University Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

{{See also|List of works by William Hogarth}}

By April 1720, Hogarth was an [[engraver]] in his own right, at first engraving coats of arms, shop bills, and designing plates for booksellers.

In 1727, he was hired by Joshua Morris, a tapestry worker, to prepare a design for the ''Element of Earth''. Morris heard that he was "an engraver, and no painter", and consequently declined the work when completed. Hogarth accordingly sued him for the money in the [[Westminster Hall#Westminster Hall|Westminster Court]], where the case was decided in his favour on 28 May 1728. In 1757 he was appointed [[Serjeant Painter]] to the King.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth'', vol. 3 (New Brunswick 1993), pp. 213–216.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early works===
[[File:HogarthWanstead.jpg|thumb|280px|left|''[[The Assembly at Wanstead House]]''. [[Richard Child, 1st Earl Tylney|Earl Tylney]] and family in foreground]]
Early satirical works included an ''[[Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme]]'' (c.1721, published 1724), about the disastrous stock market crash of 1720 known as the [[South Sea Bubble]], in which many English people lost a great deal of money. In the bottom left corner, he shows [[Protestant]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], and [[Jewish]] figures gambling, while in the middle there is a huge machine, like a merry-go-round, which people are boarding. At the top is a goat, written below which is "Who'l Ride". The people are scattered around the picture with a sense of disorder, while the progress of the well dressed people towards the ride in the middle shows the foolishness of the crowd in buying stock in the [[South Sea Company]], which spent more time issuing stock than anything else.&lt;ref&gt;See Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'' (3rd edition, London 1989), no. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early works include ''The Lottery'' (1724); ''The Mystery of Masonry brought to Light by the Gormagons'' (1724);  ''[[A Just View of the British Stage]]'' (1724); some book illustrations; and the small print ''Masquerades and Operas'' (1724). The latter is a satire on contemporary follies, such as the [[masquerade ball|masquerades]] of the Swiss impresario [[John James Heidegger]], the popular Italian [[Opera|opera singers]], [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]]'s pantomimes at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], and the exaggerated popularity of [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]]'s protégé, the architect and painter [[William Kent]]. He continued that theme in 1727, with the ''Large Masquerade Ticket''. In 1726 Hogarth prepared twelve large engravings for [[Samuel Butler (1612–1680)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Hudibras]]''. 
[[File:William Hogarth - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Self-Portrait'' by Hogarth, ca. 1735, [[Yale Center for British Art]].]] These he himself valued highly, and they are among his best book illustrations.

In the following years he turned his attention to the production of small "[[Conversation piece (paintings)|conversation piece]]s" (i.e., groups in oil of full-length portraits from {{convert|12|to|15|in}} high). Among his efforts in oil between 1728 and 1732 were ''The Fountaine Family'' (c.1730), ''The Assembly at Wanstead House'', ''The House of Commons examining Bambridge'', and several pictures of the chief actors in [[John Gay]]'s popular ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth'', vol. 1, pp. 172–185, 206–215.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his real low-life and real-life subjects was [[Sarah Malcolm]] whom he sketched two days before her execution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/hogarth/hogarth-room-guide-room-8 Sarah Malcolm], The Hogarth Room, The Tate, retrieved 7 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Hogarth's masterpieces of this period is the depiction of an amateur performance by children of [[John Dryden]]'s ''The Indian Emperor, or The Conquest of Mexico'' (1732–1735) at the home of [[John Conduitt]], master of the mint, in [[Hanover Square, London|St George's Street, Hanover Square]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth'', vol. 2 (New Brunswick 1992), pp. 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogarth's other works in the 1730s include ''A Midnight Modern Conversation'' (1733), ''Southwark Fair'' (1733), ''The Sleeping Congregation'' (1736), [[Before and After (Hogarth)|''Before'' and ''After'']] (1736), ''Scholars at a Lecture'' (1736), ''The Company of Undertakers (Consultation of Quacks)'' (1736), ''[[The Distrest Poet]]'' (1736), ''[[The Four Times of the Day]]'' (1738), and ''[[Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn]]'' (1738). He might also have printed ''Burlington Gate'' (1731), evoked by [[Alexander Pope]]'s Epistle to [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]], and defending Lord Chandos, who is therein satirized. This print gave great offence, and was suppressed. However, modern authorities such as Ronald Paulson no longer attribute it to Hogarth.&lt;ref&gt;See Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moralizing art===

====Harlot's and Rake's Progresses====
[[File:The Rake's Progress 8.jpg|thumb|''[[A Rake's Progress]]'', Plate 8, 1735, and retouched by Hogarth in 1763 by adding the Britannia emblem&lt;ref&gt;[[#JBN1833|J. B. Nichols, 1833]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=2xIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA192&amp;hl=en p.192] "PLATE VIII. ... Britannia 1763"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#JBN1833|J. B. Nichols, 1833]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=2xIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA193&amp;hl=en p.193] "Retouched by the Author, 1763"&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1731 Hogarth completed the earliest of his series of moral works, a body of work that led to significant recognition. The collection of six scenes was entitled ''[[A Harlot's Progress]]'' and appeared first as paintings (now lost)&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press 2016), nos. 21–26.&lt;/ref&gt; before being published as engravings.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition (London: The Print Room 1989), nos. 121–126.&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Harlot's Progress'' depicts the fate of a country girl who begins prostituting&amp;nbsp;– the six scenes are chronological, starting with a meeting with a bawd and ending with a funeral ceremony that follows the character's death from venereal disease.&lt;ref&gt;Cruickshank, Dan (2010). ''London's Sinful Secret: The Bawdy History and Very Public Passions of London's Georgian Age''. Macmillan. pp. 19–20. {{ISBN|1429919566}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural series was an immediate success and was followed in 1733–1735 by the sequel ''[[A Rake's Progress]]''.&lt;ref&gt;For the paintings, see Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', nos. 74–81. For the engravings, see Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, nos. 132–139.&lt;/ref&gt; The second instalment consisted of eight pictures that depicted the reckless life of Tom Rakewell, the son of a rich merchant, who spends all of his money on luxurious living, services from prostitutes, and gambling&amp;nbsp;– the character's life ultimately ends in [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]]. The original paintings of ''A Harlot's Progress'' were destroyed in the fire at [[Fonthill Abbey|Fonthill House]] in 1755; the oil paintings of ''A Rake's Progress'' (1733–34) are displayed in the gallery room at [[Sir John Soane's Museum]], London, UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Rake's Progress|url=http://www.soane.org/collections_legacy/the_soane_hogarths/rakes_progress|work=Sir John Soane's Museum|publisher=Sir John Soane's Museum|accessdate=13 December 2013|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the success of ''A Harlot's Progress'' and ''A Rake's Progress'' resulted in numerous pirated reproductions by unscrupulous printsellers, Hogarth lobbied in parliament for greater legal control over the reproduction of his and other artists' work. The result was the [[Engraving Copyright Act 1734|Engravers’ Copyright Act]] (known as ‘Hogarth's Act’), which became law on 25 June 1735 and was the first copyright law to deal with visual works as well as the first to recognize the authorial rights of an individual artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verhoogt|first1=Robert|title=Art in Reproduction: Nineteenth-century Prints After Lawrence Alma-tadema, Jozef Israels and Ary Scheffer|date=2007|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9053569138|pages=15–16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSDnRo7YrWwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marriage à-la-mode====
[[Image:Marriage A-la-Mode 2, The Tête à Tête - William Hogarth.jpg|thumb|''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]'', ''[[Marriage à-la-mode: 2. The Tête à Tête|Shortly After the Marriage]]'' (scene two of six).]]
[[File:Marriage A-la-Mode 4, The Toilette - William Hogarth.jpg|thumbnail|''Marriage à-la-mode'', ''[[Marriage à-la-mode: 4. The Toilette|After the old Earl's funeral]]'' (scene four of six)]]

In 1743–1745, Hogarth painted the six pictures of ''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]'' ([[National Gallery, London]]),&lt;ref&gt;Judy Egerton, ''Hogarth's 'Marriage A-la-Mode' '', London: The National Gallery 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; a pointed skewering of upper-class 18th-century society. This moralistic warning shows the miserable tragedy of an ill-considered marriage for money. This is regarded by many as his finest project and may be among his best-planned story serials.

Marital ethics were the topic of much debate in 18th-century Britain. The many marriages of convenience and their attendant unhappiness came in for particular criticism, with a variety of authors taking the view that love was a much sounder basis for marriage. Hogarth here painted a satire – a genre that by definition has a moral point to convey – of a conventional marriage within the English upper class. All the paintings were engraved and the series achieved wide circulation in print form. The series, which is set in a Classical interior, shows the story of the fashionable marriage of Viscount Squanderfield, the son of bankrupt Earl Squander, to the daughter of a wealthy but miserly city merchant, starting with the signing of a marriage contract at the Earl's mansion and ending with the murder of the son by his wife's lover and the suicide of the daughter after her lover is hanged at [[Tyburn, London|Tyburn]] for murdering her husband.

[[William Makepeace Thackeray]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;This famous set of pictures contains the most important and highly wrought of the Hogarth comedies. The care and method with which the moral grounds of these pictures are laid is as remarkable as the wit and skill of the observing and dexterous artist. He has to describe the negotiations for a marriage pending between the daughter of a rich citizen Alderman and young Lord Viscount Squanderfield, the dissipated son of a gouty old Earl ... The dismal end is known. My lord draws upon the counselor, who kills him, and is apprehended while endeavouring to escape. My lady goes back perforce to the Alderman of the City, and faints upon reading Counsellor Silvertongue's dying speech at Tyburn (place of execution in old London), where the counselor has been 'executed for sending his lordship out of the world. Moral: don’t listen to evil silver-tongued counselors; don't marry a man for his rank, or a woman for her money; don't frequent foolish auctions and masquerade balls unknown to your husband; don't have wicked companions abroad and neglect your wife, otherwise you will be run through the body, and ruin will ensue, and disgrace, and Tyburn.&lt;ref&gt;Thackeray, William Makepeace, ''The English Humourists of the Eighteenth Century''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Industry and Idleness====
[[Image:William Hogarth - Industry and Idleness, Plate 1; The Fellow 'Prentices at their Looms.png|thumb|right|''Industry and Idleness'' Plate 1, The Fellow 'Prentices at their Looms]]
In the twelve prints of ''[[Industry and Idleness]]'' (1747)&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, nos. 168–179.&lt;/ref&gt; Hogarth shows the progression in the lives of two apprentices, one of whom is dedicated and hard working, while the other, who is idle, commits crime and is eventually executed. This shows the work ethic of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] England, where those who worked hard were rewarded, such as the industrious apprentice who becomes [[Sheriff of London|Sheriff]] (plate 8), [[Alderman]] (plate 10), and finally the [[Sheriffs of the City of London|Lord Mayor]] of London in the last plate in the series. The idle apprentice, who begins "at play in the church yard" (plate 3), holes up "in a Garrett with a Common Prostitute" after turning [[highwayman]] (plate 7) and "executed at Tyburn" (plate 11). The idle apprentice is sent to the [[gallows]] by the industrious apprentice himself. For each plate, there is at least one passage from the Bible at the bottom, most from the [[Book of Proverbs]], such as for the first plate of "Industry and Idleness, shown here, "Proverbs Ch:10 Ver:4  The hand of the diligent maketh rich."

====Beer Street and Gin Lane====
[[Image:GinLane.jpg|''[[Gin Lane]]''|thumb]]

Later prints of significance include his pictorial warning of the consequences of alcoholism in [[Beer Street and Gin Lane|''Beer Street'' and ''Gin Lane'']] (1751).&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, nos. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt; Hogarth engraved ''Beer Street'' to show a happy city drinking the 'good' beverage, English [[beer]], in contrast to ''Gin Lane'', in which the effects of drinking gin are shown – as a more potent liquor, gin caused more problems for society.&lt;ref&gt;See Mark Hallett, ''The Spectacle of Difference'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999), pp.198–222.&lt;/ref&gt; People are shown as healthy, happy and prosperous in ''Beer Street'', while in ''Gin Lane'' they are scrawny, lazy and careless. The woman at the front of ''Gin Lane'', who lets her baby fall to its death, echoes the tale of Judith Dufour, who strangled her baby so she could sell its clothes for gin money.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/11202643/Hogarth-the-father-of-the-modern-cartoon.html "Hogarth, the father of the modern cartoon", ''The Telegraph'', 13 May 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; The prints were published in support of the [[Gin Act 1751]].

Hogarth's friend, the magistrate [[Henry Fielding]], may have enlisted Hogarth to help with propaganda for the Gin Act: ''Beer Street'' and ''Gin Lane'' were issued shortly after his work ''An Enquiry into the Causes of the Late Increase of Robbers, and Related Writings'', and addressed the same issues.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/w/william_hogarth,_beer_street.aspx "William Hogarth, Beer Street and Gin Lane, two prints", British Museum.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031115252/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/w/william_hogarth,_beer_street.aspx |date=31 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Four Stages of Cruelty====
Other prints were his outcry against inhumanity in ''[[The Four Stages of Cruelty]]'' (published 21 February 1751),&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition (London: The Print Room 1989), nos. 168–179.&lt;/ref&gt; in which Hogarth depicts the cruel treatment of animals which he saw around him and suggests what will happen to people who carry on in this manner. In the first picture there are scenes of torture of dogs, cats and other animals. The second shows one of the characters from the first painting, Tom Nero, has now become a coach driver, and his cruelty to his horse has caused it to break its leg. In the third painting Tom is shown as a murderer, with the woman he killed lying on the ground, while in the fourth, titled ''Reward of Cruelty'', the murderer is shown being dissected by scientists after his execution.  The method of execution, and the dissection, reflect the 1752 [[Act of Parliament]] allowing for the dissection of executed criminals who had been convicted for murder.

===Portraits===
[[File:William Hogarth - David Garrick as Richard III - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[David Garrick]] as Richard III, 1745]]
[[File:Hogarth, William - Portrait of a Man - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Portrait of a Man, 1741]]

Hogarth was also a popular [[portrait painter]]. In 1745 he painted actor [[David Garrick]] as [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]],&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; for which he was paid £200, "which was more", he wrote, "than any English artist ever received for a single portrait." In 1746 a sketch of [[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat]], afterwards beheaded on Tower Hill, had an exceptional success.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, no. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1740&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, Ellis. (1994) ''Painting in Britain 1530–1790''. 5th edn. New Haven and London: [[Yale University Press]], p. 175. {{ISBN|0300058330}}&lt;/ref&gt; he created a truthful, vivid full-length portrait of his friend, the philanthropic [[Thomas Coram|Captain Coram]] for the [[Thomas Coram Foundation for Children]], now in the [[Foundling Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; and his unfinished oil sketch of a young fishwoman, entitled ''[[The Shrimp Girl]]'' ([[National Gallery, London]]),&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; may be called masterpieces of [[British painting]]. There are also portraits of his wife and his two sisters, and of many other people, among them Bishop [[Benjamin Hoadly|Hoadly]] and Bishop [[Thomas Herring|Herring]].

===Historical subjects===
For a long period of his life, Hogarth tried to achieve the status of [[history painter]], but had no great success in this field.

====Biblical scenes====
Examples of his history pictures are ''The Pool of Bethesda'' and ''The Good Samaritan'', executed in 1736–1737 for [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]];&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press 2016), nos. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Moses brought before Pharaoh's Daughter'', painted for the [[Foundling Hospital]] (1747, formerly at the [[Thomas Coram Foundation for Children]], now in the [[Foundling Museum]]);&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Paul before Felix'' (1748) at [[Lincoln's Inn]];&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; and his altarpiece for [[St. Mary Redcliffe]], [[Bristol]] (1755–56).&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Gate of Calais====
''[[The Gate of Calais]]'' (1748; now in [[Tate Britain]]) was produced soon after his return from a visit to France.&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horace Walpole]] wrote that Hogarth had run a great risk to go there since the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|peace of Aix-la-Chapelle]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;he went to France, and was so imprudent as to be taking a sketch of the drawbridge at [[Calais]]. He was seized and carried to the governor, where he was forced to prove his vocation by producing several [[caricatures]] of the French; particularly a scene of the shore, with an immense piece of beef landing for the ''Lion d'argent'', the English inn at Calais, and several hungry friars following it. They were much diverted with his drawings, and dismissed him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Back home, he immediately executed a painting of the subject in which he unkindly represented his enemies, the [[French people|Frenchmen]], as cringing, emaciated and superstitious people, while an enormous sirloin of beef arrives, destined for the English inn as a symbol of British prosperity and superiority. He claimed to have painted himself into the picture in the left corner sketching the gate, with a "soldier's hand upon my shoulder", running him in.&lt;ref&gt;[[#JBN1833|J. B. Nichols, 1833]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=nwgIAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22William+Hogarth%22&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1#PPA63,M1 p.63] "in one corner introduced my own portrait"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other later works===

Notable Hogarth engravings in the 1740s include ''[[The Enraged Musician]]'' (1741), the six prints of ''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]'' (1745; executed by French artists under Hogarth's inspection), and ''The Stage Coach or The Country Inn Yard'' (1747).&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, nos. 152, 158–163, 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1745 Hogarth painted a self-portrait with his pug dog [[Trump (dog)|Trump]] (now also in [[Tate Britain]]), which shows him as a learned artist supported by volumes of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[John Milton|Milton]] and [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]].&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1749, he represented the somewhat disorderly English troops on their ''[[March of the Guards to Finchley]]'' (formerly located in [[Thomas Coram Foundation for Children]], now [[Foundling Museum]]).&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others works included his ingenious ''[[Satire on False Perspective]]'' (1754);&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, no. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; his satire on canvassing in his ''[[Humours of an Election|Election]]'' series (1755–1758; now in [[Sir John Soane's Museum]]);&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', nos. 214–217.&lt;/ref&gt; his ridicule of the English passion for [[cockfighting]] in ''The Cockpit'' (1759); his attack on [[Methodism]] in ''[[Credulity, Superstition, and Fanaticism]]'' (1762); his political anti-war satire in ''The Times'', plate I (1762); and his pessimistic view of all things in ''Tailpiece, or The Bathos'' (1764).&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, nos. 206, 210a, 211, 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
[[File:Analysis of Beauty Plate 1 by William Hogarth.jpg|thumb|''[[The Analysis of Beauty]]'' plate 1 (1753)]]
Hogarth wrote and published his ideas of artistic design in his book ''[[The Analysis of Beauty]]'' (1753).&lt;ref&gt;William Hogarth, ''The Analysis of Beauty'' (1753), ed. Ronald Paulson, New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-300-07346-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he professes to define the principles of beauty and grace which he, a real child of [[Rococo]], saw realized in serpentine lines (the [[Line of Beauty]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/r/rococo|title=Rococo – Art Term {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|work=Tate|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; By some of Hogarth's adherents, the book was praised as a fine deliverance upon aesthetics; by his enemies and rivals, its obscurities and minor errors were made the subject of endless ridicule and caricature.&lt;ref&gt;Timbs, John (1881). [https://books.google.com/books?id=gF5JAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq= ''Anecdote Lives of William Hogarth, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Thomas Gainsborough, Henry Fuseli, Sir Thomas Lawrence, and J.M.W. Turner'']. R. Bentley. pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Painter and engraver of modern moral subjects===
Hogarth lived in an age when artwork became increasingly commercialized, being viewed in shop windows, [[tavern]]s, and public buildings, and sold in [[old master print|printshop]]s. Old hierarchies broke down, and new forms began to flourish: the [[ballad opera]], the [[bourgeois tragedy]], and especially, a new form of [[fiction]] called the [[novel]] with which authors such as [[Henry Fielding]] had great success. Therefore, by that time, Hogarth hit on a new idea: "painting and engraving modern moral subjects ... to treat my subjects as a dramatic writer; my picture was my stage", as he himself remarked in his manuscript notes.

He drew from the highly moralizing [[Protestant]] tradition of Dutch [[genre painting]], and the very vigorous satirical traditions of the English [[broadsheet]] and other types of popular print. In England the fine arts had little comedy in them before Hogarth. His prints were expensive, and remained so until early 19th-century reprints brought them to a wider audience.

===Parodic borrowings from Old Masters===
When analysing the work of the artist as a whole, [[Ronald Paulson]] says, "In ''[[A Harlot's Progress]]'', every single plate but one is based on [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]]'s images of the story of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin]] and the story of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]." In other works, he parodies [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|Last Supper]]. According to Paulson, Hogarth is subverting the religious establishment and the orthodox belief in an immanent [[God]] who intervenes in the lives of people and produces [[miracle]]s. Indeed, Hogarth was a [[Deist]], a believer in a God who created the universe but takes no direct hand in the lives of his creations. Thus, as a "comic history painter", he often poked fun at the old-fashioned, "beaten" subjects of religious art in his paintings and prints. Hogarth also rejected [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]]'s then-current ideal of the [[Art in ancient Greece#Classical|classical Greek]] male in favour of the living, breathing female. He said, "Who but a bigot, even to the [[antiques]], will say that he has not seen faces and necks, hands and arms in living women, that even the Grecian [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]] doth but coarsely imitate."

==Personal life==

On 23 March 1729 Hogarth married Jane Thornhill, daughter of artist Sir [[James Thornhill]].

Hogarth was initiated as a [[Freemason]] before 1728 in the Lodge at the Hand and Apple Tree Tavern, Little Queen Street, and later belonged to the Carrier Stone Lodge and the Grand Stewards' Lodge; the latter still possesses the 'Hogarth Jewel' which Hogarth designed for the Lodge's Master to wear.&lt;ref&gt;See references in [http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/beresiner11.html this biography].&lt;/ref&gt; Today the original is in storage and a replica is worn by the Master of the Lodge. Freemasonry was a theme in some of Hogarth's work, most notably 'Night', the fourth in the quartet of paintings (later released as engravings) collectively entitled the ''[[Four Times of the Day]]''.

His main home was in Leicester Square (then known as Leicester Fields), but he bought a country retreat in [[Chiswick]] in 1749, the house now known as [[Hogarth's House]] and preserved as a museum, and spent time there for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hounslow.info/arts-culture/historic-houses-museums/hogarth-house/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123103341/http://www.hounslow.info/arts-culture/historic-houses-museums/hogarth-house/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2018-01-23|title=Hogarth’s House {{!}} Hounslow.info|date=2018-01-23|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.camdennewjournal.co.uk/031005/n031005_24.htm |title=Camden New Journal |author=Joel Taylor |work=camdennewjournal.co.uk |date=11 March 2005 |accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Hogarths had no children, although they fostered foundling children. He was a founding Governor of the [[Foundling Hospital]].

Among his friends and acquaintances were many English artists and satirists of the period, such as [[Francis Hayman]], [[Henry Fielding]], and [[Laurence Sterne]].

==Death==
[[File:William Hogarth's tomb.jpg|thumb|upright|Tomb of William and Jane Hogarth]]

Hogarth died in London on 26 October 1764 and was buried at [[St. Nicholas Church, Chiswick]], London. His friend, actor [[David Garrick]], composed the following inscription for his tombstone:

{{poemquote|Farewell great Painter of Mankind
Who reach'd the noblest point of Art
Whose pictur'd Morals charm the Mind
And through the Eye correct the Heart.

If Genius fire thee, Reader, stay,
If Nature touch thee, drop a Tear:
If neither move thee, turn away,
For Hogarth's honour'd dust lies here.}}

==Influence and reputation==
Hogarth's works were a direct influence on [[John Collier (caricaturist)|John Collier]], who was known as the "Lancashire Hogarth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hignett|first=Tim|publisher=George Kelsall Publishing|year=1991|title=Milnrow &amp; Newhey: A Lancashire Legacy|isbn=0-946571-19-8|location=[[Littleborough, Greater Manchester|Littleborough]]|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of Hogarth's prints throughout Europe, together with the depiction of popular scenes from his prints in faked Hogarth prints, influenced Continental book illustration through the 18th and early 19th centuries, especially in Germany and France. He also influenced many caricaturists of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. Hogarth's influence lives on today as artists continue to draw inspiration from his work.

Hogarth's paintings and prints have provided the subject matter for several other works. For example, [[Gavin Gordon (composer)|Gavin Gordon]]'s 1935 ballet ''[[The Rake's Progress (ballet)|The Rake's Progress]]'', to choreography by [[Ninette de Valois]], was based directly on Hogarth's series of paintings of that title. [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s 1951 [[opera]] ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'', with libretto by [[W. H. Auden]], was less literally inspired by the same series. Hogarth's engravings also inspired the [[BBC radio]] play ''The Midnight House'' by Jonathan Hall, based on the [[M. R. James]] ghost story "[[The Mezzotint]]" and first broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] in 2006.

[[Russell Banks]]' short story "Indisposed" is a fictional account of Hogarth's infidelity as told from the viewpoint of his wife, Jane. Hogarth was the lead character in [[Nick Dear]]'s play ''[[The Art of Success]]'', whilst he is played by [[Toby Jones]] in the 2006 television film ''[[A Harlot's Progress (film)|A Harlot's Progress]]''.

[[Hogarth's House]] in [[Chiswick]], west London, is now a museum; it abuts one of London's best known [[road junction]]s – the [[Hogarth Roundabout]]. In 2014 both Hogarth's House and the Foundling Museum held special exhibitions to mark the 250th anniversary of his death.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3116">[[Image:Hamilton-Burr pistols.jpg|thumb|right|Wogdon &amp; Barton dueling pistols]]'''Wogdon &amp; Barton''' (founded by Robert Wogdon) was an 18th-century firm of [[gunsmith]]s based in [[London]], [[England]]. Robert Wogdon produced [[flintlock]] firearms from the 1760s, and was particularly well known for his high quality [[duelling pistol]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Robert Wogdon, Gunmaker, London (1737-1813) |url=https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/articles/2406 |website=Museums Victoria Collections |accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Wogdon became synonymous with dueling, to the extent that duels in England were sometimes referred to as "a Wogdon affair".  Wogdon had apprenticed to the Irish gunmaker Edward Norton in Lincolnshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Pistols of Robert Wogdon {{!}} Andrea Penrose Author |url=http://andreapenrose.com/the-pistols-of-robert-wogdon/ |website=andreapenrose.com |accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=British gunmakers |url=http://www.thefield.co.uk/features/british-gunmakers-21594 |website=The Field |accessdate=7 June 2018 |date=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wogdon formed a partnership in 1794 with John Barton, after which their pistols were signed Wogdon and Barton.  Wogdon retired in 1803 and died in 1813.

Wogdon made the pistols used in the infamous [[Burr-Hamilton duel]], which were later claimed to have concealed "hair triggers" (also known as [[Trigger (firearms)#Set trigger|set triggers]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Little-Known Story of the Gun That Killed Alexander Hamilton |url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a21083805/hamilton-dueling-pistols/ |website=Popular Mechanics |accessdate=7 June 2018 |date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These gave the person using them an advantage over their opponent by reducing the amount of finger pressure required to fire the pistol, which greatly increased accuracy of the shot.  However, for at least twenty years before the Burr-Hamilton duel, English duelling pistols by all the top makers had been customarily fitted with set triggers. Wogdon's duelling pistols were fitted with set triggers as a standard feature, so they cannot be regarded as "secret" devices that other duellists of the era would be completely unaware of.

Robert Wogdon (January 1734 - 28 March 1813) died aged 79 and was buried with his wife Jane (died 15 February 1805, aged 69) in the [[chancel]] of St Bartholomew's Church, located on the outskirts of [[Buntingford]], [[Hertfordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.layston-church.org.uk/wogdon.html&lt;/ref&gt;
