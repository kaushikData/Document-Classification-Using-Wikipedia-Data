The '''Addiction Research Center Inventory''', abbreviated '''ARCI''', is a standardized [[questionnaire]] for assessing subjective effects of [[psychoactive drug]]s that was developed in the early 1960s at the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] [[National Institute of Mental Health Addiction Research Center|Addiction Research Center]]. This [[self-report inventory]] was developed from the use of "sentence completion" and other association techniques on male subjects under drug and no-drug conditions. In addition to demonstrated "drug-sensitive" questions, the final form of the inventory (550 "true-false" items) also contains items which were thought to delineate to some extent [[schizoid]] and "[[psychopathy|psychopathic]]" characteristics. Initial use indicated that the inventory was effective in differentiating various subjective effects of drugs and in discriminating some similarities and differences of naturally occurring and experimentally induced behavioral abnormalities.&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haertzen | first1 = Charles A. | last2 = Hill | first2 = Harris E. | last3 = Belleville | first3 = Richard E. | title = Development of the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI): Selection of items that are sensitive to the effects of various drugs | journal = Psychopharmacologia | volume = 4 | pages = 155 | year = 1963 | doi = 10.1007/BF02584088 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2157">'''Air quality guideline''' is an annual mean concentration guideline for [[Particulates|particulate matter]] from the [[World Health Organization]]. The guideline stipulates that [[PM2.5]] not exceed 10 μg/m3 annual mean, or 25 μg/m3 24-hour mean; and that [[PM10]] not exceed 20 μg/m3 annual mean, or 50 μg/m3 24-hour mean.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=World Health Organization |title=Ambient (outdoor) air quality and health: fact sheet |date=September 2016 |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104165807/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/ |archivedate=2016-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of health effects, the guideline states that PM2.5 concentration of 10 is the lowest level at which total, cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality have been shown to increase with more than 95% confidence in response to long-term exposure to PM2.5.

Along with cardiopulmonary and lung cancer deaths, the chances of which an individual increases their risk of being diagnosed with these is highly coordinated to fine particulate matter and sulfur oxide- related pollution. "Each 10 μg/m³ m^3 elevation in fine particulate air pollution was associated with approximately a 4%, 6% and 8% increased risk of all-cause, cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mortality, respectively." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pope|first1=C.

'''Alexander Monro''' of [[Craiglockhart]] and Cockburn {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] [[FRCPE]]}} (22 May 1733 – 2 October 1817) was a Scottish anatomist, physician and medical educator. To distinguish him as the second of [[Alexander Monro (disambiguation)|three generations of physicians of the same name]], he is known as ''secundus''. His students included the naval physician and abolitionist [[Thomas Trotter (physician)|Thomas Trotter]]. Alexander was from the distinguished [[Munro of Auchinbowie|Monro of Auchenbowie]] family. His major achievements included, describing the lymphatic system, providing the most detailed elucidation of the musculo-skeletal system to date and introducing [[clinical medicine]] into the curriculum. He is known for the Monro-Kellie doctrine on intracranial pressure, a hypothesis developed by Monro and his former pupil [[George Kellie]], who worked as a surgeon in the port of Leith.

==Life==
Alexander Monro ''secundus'', the third and youngest son of [[Alexander Monro (primus)|Alexander Monro]] ''primus'' and Isabella Macdonald of [[Sleat]], was born at [[Edinburgh]] on 20 May 1733.{{sfn|Moore|1894}} He was sent with his brothers to [[Mr Mundell's school]], where he learned the rudiments of Latin and Greek, and showed early evidences of great ability. 
Among his school-fellows were [[Ilay Campbell]] who was afterwards Lord President of the Court of Session and William Ramsay of Barnton, the banker.

Alexander's father decided to make him his successor and sent him to [[Edinburgh University]] when he was twelve years old, to attend the ordinary course of philosophy before beginning his professional training. He studied mathematics under the great [[Colin Maclaurin]] and ethics under Sir [[John Pringle (physician)|John Pringle]]. Alexander was also a great favourite of Dr [[Matthew Stewart (mathematician)|Matthew Stewart]], Professor of Experimental Philosophy.

Alexander showed a taste for anatomy and after entering on his medical course in his eighteenth year became a useful assistant to his father in the dissecting room. He attended the lectures of Drs. Rutherford, [[Andrew Plummer]], Alston and Sinclair. He possessed an insatiable thirst for medical knowledge, an uncommon share of perseverance, and a very good memory.

In the session of 1753–54, his father (Alexander Monro ''primus'') found his class too large for the lecture room and had to divide the class, repeating his lecture in the evening. This he found difficult, and he experimented with his son (Alexander Monro ''secundus'' taking the evening class. The results were satisfactory and so he presented a petition to the Town Council at the close of the session asking them to appoint his son formally as his successor. This petition was granted on 10 June and Alexander Monro ''secondus'' was admitted as conjunct professor on 11 July.

Alexander Monro ''secundus'' took his degree as Doctor of Medicine on 20 October 1755. He then proceeded to his studies abroad. He spent a short time in London, where he attended the lectures of [[William Hunter (anatomist)|Dr William Hunter]]. He next visited Paris and on 17 September 1757 entered [[Leyden University]] where he formed a friendship with two famous anatomists, [[Bernhard Siegfried Albinus]] and [[Petrus Camper]]. However his foreign studies were prosecuted principally at Berlin, where he worked under the celebrated [[Johann Friedrich Meckel, the Elder|Professor Meckel]], in whose house he lived. Alexander spent some time in Edinburgh during early 1757 in order to fill the place of his father, who was confined to the house by illness. He finally was admitted a licentiate of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] on 2 May 1758 and as a Fellow on 1 May 1759.{{sfn|Moore|1894}} He was to be elected President of the College in 1779.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book|title=Neurological Eponyms|page=21}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Monro ''primus'' delivered the opening anatomy and surgery lectures of the 1758–59 course and then handed the work to his son Alexander Monro ''secundus''.

Monro ''secundus'', who in 1777 successfully resisted the appointment of a separate professor of surgery, gave a full course of lectures every year from 1759 to 1800. From 1800 to 1807, he delivered part of the course, his son Alexander ''tertius'' completing it, and in 1808 gave the introductory lecture only.{{sfn|Moore|1894}}

This was his last lecture, and after it his faculties gradually decayed. He became drowsy after dinner, and his nose used to bleed from time to time. In 1813, he had an apoplectic attack.

In later life he was living at 30 St Andrew Square in the [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1816-17&lt;/ref&gt;

He died 2 October 1817.{{sfn|Moore|1894}} He is buried with his parents and wife, Katherine Inglis (d.1803) in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]] in central Edinburgh. The grave lies west of the church and north of the Adam mausoleum.

==Publications==

In 1771, he wrote a paper on the effect of drugs on the nervous system. He published two controversial 'observations' on the lymphatics in 1758, maintaining that he, in a short essay printed at Berlin in 1758, and reprinted in 1761 and 1770, 'De Venis Lymphaticis Valvulosis,' and not [[William Hunter (anatomist)|William Hunter]], had first correctly described the general communications of the lymphatic system. Frederick Hoffman had, however, preceded both Monro and Hunter in the description.{{sfn|Moore|1894}}

In 1783, he published in Edinburgh 'Observations on the Structure and Functions of the Nervous System,' dedicated to the Right Hon. [[Henry Dundas]], and it is in consequence of the description in this book of the communication between the lateral ventricles of the brain that his name is known to every student of medicine at the present day. The opening now always spoken of as the 'foramen of Monro' is very small in the healthy brain, but when abnormal accumulation of CSF on the brain is present (known as hydrocephalus) may be as large as a sixpence. It was this morbid condition that drew Monro's attention to the foramen, and he first described it in a paper read before the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh in 1764, but gives a fuller account in this work on the nervous system.{{sfn|Moore|1894}}  A further important observation in this paper was that the healthy cranial cavity is rigid and of constant volume and, he argued, that since  the brain 'is nearly incompressible,  the quantity of blood within the head must remain the same.' This was taken up by his former student [[George Kellie]] who set out the hypothesis that the contents of the skull (blood, CSF, and brain tissue) are a state of volume equilibrium, so that any increase in volume of one of the cranial constituents must be compensated by a decrease in volume of another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kellie|first=George|date=1824|title=Appearances observed in the dissection of two individuals; death from cold and congestion of the brain|url=|journal=Trans Med Chir Sci Edinb.|volume=1|pages=84–169|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has since been validated and is known as the [[Intracranial pressure|Monro-Kellie doctrine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mokri|first=B.|date=2001-06-26|title=The Monro-Kellie hypothesis: applications in CSF volume depletion|journal=Neurology|volume=56|issue=12|pages=1746–1748|issn=0028-3878|pmid=11425944}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He had always paid much attention to comparative anatomy, and published in 1785 'The Structure and Physiology of Fishes explained and compared with those of Man and other Animals.' In 1788, he published an account of seventy pairs of bursae under the title, 'Description of all the Bursae Mucosse of the Human Body, their Structure, Accidents, and Diseases, and Operations for their Cure,' which is stated by several anatomical writers to be the first full description of the bursae.{{sfn|Moore|1894}}

In 1793, he published 'Experiments on the Nervous System with Opium and Metalline Substances, to determine the Nature and Effects of Animal Electricity.' These experiments led him to the conclusion that nerve force was not identical with electricity. His last book, 'Three Treatises on the Brain, the Eye, and the Ear,' was published at Edinburgh in 1797.{{sfn|Moore|1894}}

Manuscript copies of notes of his lectures on anatomy delivered in 1774 and 1775 are preserved in the library of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society of London,' and some 'Essays and Heads of Lectures on Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, Surgery,' very imperfectly arranged, were printed by his son Alexander in 1840.

The '''American Board of Periodontology''' is an organization which serves the public and the dental profession by administering the board certification process for experts in the dental specialty of [[periodontics]].  The board was formed in 1939 by the [[American Academy of Periodontology]] to maintain a high standard of care and advance the science and art of [[periodontology]].  It is one of the nine specialty boards recognized by the [[American Dental Association]].

Periodontists who have achieved board certification are awarded the title "Diplomate of the American Board of Periodontology", to demonstrate to the public that their knowledge and skills have passed this rigorous peer review process.

The American Board of Periodontology is responsible for creating and administering the board certification process for experts in the field of [[periodontics]].  The board also operates a re-certification process to ensure that board certified periodontists maintain their high skill level throughout their career.

'''Armand''' is a fictional character in ''[[The Vampire Chronicles]]'' novels written by [[Anne Rice]]. At the end of the series, he is approximately 500 years of age. His outward appearance is that of a beautiful adolescent boy, 5’6, with curly auburn hair, large brown eyes and slender fingers. His features are at times compared figuratively to those of [[Cupid]] or a [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] [[angel]].

==Fictional biography==

===As a human===
Armand is born in 1481 in the former [[Kiev Rus]] to the acclaimed hunter Ivan. Armand's original name is Andrei.&lt;ref name="vampire-armand"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rice|first=Anne|title=The Vampire Armand|publisher=Alfred A Knopf|location=United States of America|date=10 October 1998|series=The Vampire Chronicles|isbn=978-0-679-45447-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child he has the ability to paint vivid pictures of [[Jesus Christ]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Madonna]], and the [[Saint|Eastern Orthodox Saints]]. His astonished parents eventually reveal his gift to the monks in the Monastery of the Caves, who live an [[ascetic]] life buried beneath earth, sustained only by water and small amounts of food. Both the monks and Andrei believe he is destined to live such a life, while his father is appalled by the idea. When their ruler, Prince Michael, orders Andrei to paint an icon and bring it to the castle of his brother, the supposedly dead Prince Feodor, Andrei is captured by [[Tartars]] and brought as a slave to [[Constantinople]] and subsequently sold to a [[Venice|Venetian]] brothel. There, he is subjected to horrific [[sexual abuse]] and develops [[amnesia]].&lt;ref name="vampire-armand"/&gt;

[[Marius de Romanus|Marius]], a 1500-year-old vampire then living as a painter in Venice, rescues Andrei, giving him an education and a luxurious life. Marius renames him Amadeo. Marius is in love with a courtesan named Bianca Solderini, yet cannot bring himself to turn her into a vampire. Instead, he chooses Amadeo for his beauty, youth and painting skills (apparently lost, along with his memories) to educate 'in the way of the blood', so as to eventually make him a vampire. Amadeo loves Marius single-mindedly and is eager to become a vampire. He does not understand Marius' hesitation to turn him, and in an act of rebellion and anger he seduces an English Lord, whom he eventually abandons after a few nights. However, the English Lord becomes obsessed with Amadeo and enraged by his betrayal, wounds him with a poisoned blade. In doing this, he forces Marius to turn Amadeo into a vampire to save his life. Amadeo is 17 years old at the time of his transformation.&lt;ref name="vampire-armand"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blood-and-gold"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rice|first=Anne|title=Blood and Gold|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=United States of America|date=16 October 2001|series=The Vampire Chronicles|isbn=0-679-45449-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a vampire===
Shortly after Amadeo becomes a vampire, Marius' Palazzo is attacked by a [[Satanism|Satanic]] [[cult]] of vampires, led by the vampire [[Santino (The Vampire Chronicles)|Santino]]. They set Marius on fire and kidnap Amadeo and the other children at the Palazzo and take them to Rome. Santino tortures Amadeo by burning his friends to death right in front of him and starving him in a cellar until he is forced to feed on his best friend and innocent children. After five months of such psychological torture, Amadeo is ready to believe everything the cult said in exchange for their love and to forget all he has known before. Because of his strength, he is named the leader of the Parisian coven in 1580, and renamed Armand, since a name with the word 'God' (Deo) in it seemed unfit for the leader of a satanic coven.&lt;ref name="vampire-armand"/&gt;

Roughly two hundred years later the coven tries to capture Lestat (turned vampire by [[Magnus (The Vampire Chronicles)|Magnus]], another old target of the coven) and considers destroying him, but Lestat is stronger than Armand, and declares them ridiculous and unfit for the times in which they lived. He disproves their beliefs that they could not look upon crosses, walk into churches, or live in places of light. Realizing that Lestat is right about the coven's obsolescence, Armand falls into despair and destroys most of his own followers. He tries to persuade Lestat to take him along on his journeys, but Lestat refuses. Instead, Armand joins the [[Théâtre des Vampires]] and learns to move among mortals.

In the late 19th century, Lestat's fledglings [[Claudia (The Vampire Chronicles)|Claudia]] and [[Louis de Pointe du Lac|Louis]] happen upon the theater. Armand sees Louis as a new possibility of integrating into the modern world. When he cannot persuade Louis to leave Claudia, he manages to get rid of her by burning her to death in the sun, and then lets Louis burn the theater with the vampires in it so they can leave together. They stay together until around the 1920s, then part because Louis has never fully recovered from the loss of Claudia, and knows that Armand is at least partly responsible for her death.&lt;ref name="vampire-armand"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vampire-lestat"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rice|first=Anne|title=The Vampire Lestat|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=United States of America|year=1985|series=The Vampire Chronicles|isbn=0-345-31386-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the incidents in ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]'', [[Daniel Molloy]] tries to find Lestat, but is instead found by Armand. Daniel provides a link for Armand to the new time, and they form a relationship. However, Daniel grows more and more impatient, longing to be turned to a vampire, and he and Armand become estranged. By 1985, Daniel manages to destroy his health to such a degree that he is near death, so Armand finally turns him into a vampire. Daniel is Armand's only fledgling to date, and they can no longer stay together afterward.

When Lestat brings back Veronica's Veil from his journey in ''[[Memnoch the Devil]]'', Armand is struck by the sight of it; his religious fervor revived, he goes into the sun in an attempt to destroy and redeem himself. He not only survives, however, but manages miraculously to save a girl named Sybelle from her abusive brother. Sybelle and her protector, Benji, restore Armand with the blood of a drug dealer, and the three of them become very close. When Armand dictates the book ''[[The Vampire Armand]]'' to [[David Talbot (The Vampire Chronicles)|David Talbot]], former head of the Talamasca and by then Lestat's fledgling, he leaves Sybelle and Benji in Marius' care. The latter then turns them into vampires.&lt;ref name="vampire-armand"/&gt;

In the 1994 [[film]] ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'', Armand was portrayed by [[Antonio Banderas]].&lt;ref name="imdb-character"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0005256/|title=Armand (Character)|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to his book description, this version of Armand was a fully-grown adult (of Spanish origin instead of Russian) when he was turned into a vampire.

In the 2002 film ''[[Queen of the Damned (film)|Queen of the Damned]]'', Armand was portrayed by [[Matthew Newton]].&lt;ref name="imdb-character"/&gt;
 
In the 2006 [[Musical theatre|musical]], ''[[Lestat (musical)|Lestat]]'', Armand was first portrayed by [[Jack Noseworthy]], who left the role a week after the pre-Broadway performance began, and was then replaced by his understudy [[Drew Sarich]], who went with the production onto Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadway.com/Jack-Noseworthy-Departs-Bway-Bound-Lestat-Understudy-Sarich-to-Go-On/broadway_news/523039|title=Jack Noseworthy Departs B'way-Bound ''Lestat''; Understudy Sarich to Go On|date=22 December 2005|publisher=Broadway.com|accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadway.com/Former-Lestat-Understudy-Drew-Sarich-Assumes-Role-of-Armand-Full-Time/broadway_news/523347|title=Former ''Lestat'' Understudy Drew Sarich Assumes Role of Armand Full-Time|date=16 January 2006|publisher=Broadway.com|accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medicine]], '''atony''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|,|t|oʊ|.|n|i}}; also ''atonia'') is a condition in which a [[muscle]] has lost its strength. It is frequently associated with the conditions [[atonic seizure]], [[atonic colon]], [[uterine atony]], [[gastrointestinal atony]] (occurs postoperatively) and [[choreatic atonia]].

Atony can also refer to the paralyzed or extremely relaxed state of skeletal muscles in [[rapid eye movement sleep]] (REM sleep) in most warm-blooded animals.

The term ''atony'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] ἀτονία (''atonia''), "slackness, debility".

cIAP1 is a multi-functional protein which can be found in the [[cytoplasm]] of cells and in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] of tumor cells. Its function in this particular case is yet to be understood.

== Location==
The ubication of cIAP1 is diverse depending on the phase of the living cycle of the [[Cell (biology)|cell]].  In healthy cells the protein is usually found in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. This was experimentally determined by [[immunofluorescence]] microscopy and subcellular fractionations methods. However, when the cell is apoptotic nuclear export of cIAP1 is induced provoking an increase in the cytosolic concentration of the protein. When a cell is tumorous it does not cease to proliferate inhibiting the apoptosis, as a result, in cancerous cells cIAP1 is rarely located in the cytoplasm.

In case of [[Cell division|dividing]] cells, cIAP1 is released into the cytosol early in [[mitosis]], then reaccumulated in nucleus in late [[anaphase]] and in [[telophase]]. Nevertheless, there is a pool of cIAP1 associated to the midbody that acts as the exception to the regular rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Okada K, Hyer M, Welsh K, Zapata JM, Reed JC|first1=Samuel T|title=cIAP1 Localizes to the nuclear compartment and modulates the cell cycle.|pmid=15665297|volume=65|issue=1|journal=Cancer Res|pages=210–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CIAP1.jpg|308px.|thumb|cIAP1 structure|left]]The gene of cIAP1 resides on chromosome 11 and its protein has a quaternary structure. It has a unique protein chain, consequently, is an asymmetric monomer protein. Its tertiary structure is basically composed by alpha domain, formed almost exclusively from [[alpha helix]]. Its size is of 31,489 bases composed by 618 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 69900 Da. cIAP1 contains baculovirus IAP repeat domains that facilitate binding to caspases and other proteins. cIAP1 is recruited to [[TNF receptor]] complexes where they support cell survival through NF-κB activation while suppressing apoptosis by preventing [[caspase]] activation. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahoney|first1=D.J.|title=Both cIAP1 and cIAP2 regulate TNF-mediated NF-B activation|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/33/11778.full.pdf|website=pnas|accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
cIAP1 is an inhibitior of apoptosis protein. It directly ubiquitinates [[RIPK1|RIP1]] and induces constitutive RIP1 [[ubiquitination]] in [[cancer]] cells. Ubiquinated RIP1 associates with the prosurvival [[kinase]] TAK1. When this complex is desubiquinated apoptosis is induced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milutinovic S, Dickson KM, Ho WC, Boudreault A, Durkin J, Gillard JW, Jaquith JB, Morris SJ, Barker PA|first1=Bertrand MJ,|title=cIAP1 and cIAP2 facilitate cancer cell survival by functioning as E3 ligases that promote RIP1 ubiquitination.|pmid=18570872|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2008.05.014|volume=30|issue=6|date=June 2008|journal=Mol. Cell|pages=689–700}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UniProtKB - Q13490 (BIRC2_HUMAN)|url=https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13490|website=Uniprot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of cIAP1 means that RIP1 will remain nonubiquitinated. As a consequence RIP1 forms a cytosolic complex with the adaptor molecule [[FADD]] and [[caspase 8]], which leads to cell death. When cIAP1 ubiquitinates RIP1 this molecule acts as a signal activating the canonical [[NF-κB]] signaling pathway. The activation of this pathway stops the noncanonical one and simultaneously the apoptosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=M Holcik|first1=T E GraberM Holcik1|title=Distinct roles for the cellular inhibitors of apoptosis proteins 1 and 2|url=http://www.nature.com/cddis/journal/v2/n3/full/cddis201120a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

cIAP1 is important for the activation of MAPK signaling. [[Mitogen-activated protein kinase|MAPKs]] are involved in directing cellular responses to a diverse array os stimuli, such as mitogens, osmotic stress, heat shock and proinflammatory cytokines regulating cell functions including proliferation, gene expression, differentiation, mitosis, cell survival or apoptosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson F, Beers Gibson T, Xu BE, Karandikar M, Berman K, Cobb MH|first1=Pearson G|title=Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways: regulation and physiological functions.|pmid=11294822|volume=22|issue=2|date=April 2001|journal=Endocr. Rev.|pages=153–83|doi=10.1210/er.22.2.153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

cIAP1 is as well implicated in innate immunity. When [[NOD-like receptor]]s are activated by bacterial peptidoglycans, they oligomerize and recruit cIAP1, cIAP2, [[TRAF2]] and RIP2. This allows cIAP1 mediated ubiquitination of RIP2, which leads to an expression of proinflammatory genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vucic, D.|first1=Almagro, M.C.|title=The inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins are critical regulators of signaling pathways and targets for anti-cancer therapy|url=http://exp-oncology.com.ua/article/3690|website=Experimental Oncology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other activities of the cIAP1 have been reported by Yanfei Qi et al. It has got a critical role in controlling [[Beta cell|β-cell]] survival under [[endoplasmatic reticulum]] (ER) stress. Studies show that when the protein is exposed to [[palmitate]] the concentration of cIAP1 decreases and, as a result, the apoptosis is no longer inhibited resulting in the death of the cell. ER stress increases cIAP1 expression in cancer cells through the UPR pathway, that is why, the induction of cIAP1 is suggested to be important for cancerous cell survival under stress conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pu Xia|first1=Yanfei Qi|title=Cellular Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein-1 (cIAP1) Plays a Critical Role in β-Cell Survival under Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress|pmc=3442554|pmid=22815481|doi=10.1074/jbc.M112.362160|volume=287|issue=38|journal=J Biol Chem|pages=32236–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crohn's disease'''.
cIAP1 is responsible for NOD signalling. When this signalling is defective, [[Crohn's disease]] is triggered.

'''Christopher Green''' (1652–1741) was a [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] academic, [[Regius Professor of Physic (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of Physic]] from 1700 to 1741.

The son of another Christopher Green, cook of [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Caius College]], Green was [[infant baptism|christened]] at [[St Botolph's Church, Cambridge|St Botolph's church]], [[Cambridge]], on 23 February 1651/52. He was seven years at the school of a Mr Griffith before he was admitted to Caius at the age of sixteen on 13 December 1667 and was a [[scholar]] from [[Michaelmas]] 1668 until [[Lady Day]] 1674, when he was elected a junior [[Fellow]] of his college. He graduated [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1671-72 and [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] in 1675,&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id= GRN667C|name=Green, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1676 was ethical lecturer in the College. He was [[Dean (education)|dean]] in 1682 and [[Stewardship|steward]] from 1684 to 1686, during which time he graduated [[Doctor of Medicine]] in 1685. He was appointed college [[bursar]] in 1687, then the next year lecturer in [[Classical Greek|Greek]].&lt;ref name=biohist&gt;John Venn, Ernest Stewart Roberts, Edward John Gross, ''Biographical history of Gonville and Caius college, 1349-1897: containing a list of all known members of the college from the foundation to the present time, with biographical notes'' (1897), vol. 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3e48AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA433#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 433]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Clinton Valley Center''' (CVC), originally called the '''Eastern Michigan Asylum for the Insane''', was a [[psychiatric hospital]] located at 140 Elizabeth Lake Road in [[Pontiac, Michigan]].  The facility was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1974&lt;ref name = "state"/&gt; and listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1981, with a decrease in its boundaries in 1986.&lt;ref name = "nris"/&gt; The facility was closed in 1997 and demolished in 2000.&lt;ref name = "asylum"&gt;{{citation | title = Asylum: Pontiac's Grand Monument from the Gilded Age | author = Bruce J.

==History==
In 1873, to alleviate the overcrowding at the Kalamazoo [[psychiatric hospital]],  the Michigan state legislature appropriated $400,000 for the construction of a second hospital in eastern Michigan.&lt;ref name = "pontiac"&gt;{{citation | title = Pontiac | author = Ronald K. Gay | publisher = Arcadia Publishing | year = 2010 | ISBN = 9780738578149 | pages = 53–63 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bpG0SOKPEAkC&amp;pg=PA53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cities in the area were requested to bid for the project, and Pontiac won out over Detroit and other cities.  The architect for the original main hospital was [[Elijah E. Myers]], who also served as the architect for the current [[Michigan State Capitol]] in [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]].&lt;ref name = "asylum"/&gt;  The asylum opened its doors five years later, on August 1, 1878,&lt;ref name = "asylum"/&gt; and began treating 222 patients.&lt;ref name = "asylum"/&gt; The original superintendent, Henry Mills Hurd, introduced multiple innovations in psychiatric care, including discouraging restraints, occupational therapy, and recreational activities.&lt;ref name = "pontiac"/&gt;

Both the campus size and number of patients slowly grew, as the hospital was repeatedly enlarged between 1882 and 1895 (also designed by Myers), with more additions in 1906, 1914, and 1938.&lt;ref name = "state"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcgi.state.mi.us/hso/sites/10903.htm |title= Paul Eastern Michigan Asylum Historic District |publisher= Michigan State Housing Development Authority: Historic Sites Online|accessdate= September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, the hospital changed its name to '''Pontiac State Hospital'''.  During the 1950s, the hospital experienced its peak of approximately 3,100 residing patients.&lt;ref name = "asylum"/&gt; The facility was renamed the Clinton Valley Center in 1973,&lt;ref name = "asylum"/&gt; and by the later 1970s the number of patients had declined to around 800.&lt;ref name = "state"/&gt;

Due to a decreasing number of patients, the facility was closed in 1997 by the State of Michigan with only 200 patients.&lt;ref name = "pontiac"/&gt;  The facility was demolished in 2000; a subdivision now stands on the site of the old hospital.&lt;ref name = "asylum"/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:EasternMichiganAsylum.jpg|thumb|left|Eastern Michigan Asylum, c. 1876]]
The campus of the Clinton Valley Center contained 44 structures, many of which were extensions of the original 1878 hospital.&lt;ref name = "state"/&gt;

The 1878 structure was a 3-1/2 story red brick structure with a center building for offices and staff, and two wings for male and female patients.&lt;ref name = "state"/&gt;  The building had a steeply pitched slate roof with multiple towers, and wood and metal cornices. The building resembled a typical [[Kirkbride Plan|Kirkbride model]].&lt;ref name = "asylum"/&gt;  The 1882 additions were designed by Charles Anderson to match the original construction.&lt;ref name = "state"/&gt;  The 1906 and 1914 additions were brick hipped-roof structures, and the 1938 construction added a Tudor designed building onto the front of the structure.&lt;ref name = "state"/&gt;

Apart from the main hospital, other structures on the campus included the Vinton Building (1893), the Sawyer Building (1917), the [[Italian Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]] (1907) designed by the [[Detroit]] firm of [[SmithGroupJJR|Smith, Hinchman and Grylls]].&lt;ref name = "state"/&gt;

The '''conflict procedure''' is an experiment often used in [[scientific research]] to quantify [[anxiety]] levels by measuring changes in punished/unpunished responding. It is often used to screen [[drug]]s for their potential to inhibit anxiety ([[anxiolytic]] potential).

==Study==
{{Original research section|date=July 2016}}
Some researchers from France have conducted an experiment on "Effects of Chronic Antidepressants in an Operant Conflict Procedure of Anxiety in the rat (1998)", "the aim of their study was to reveal possible anxiolytic like effects of antidepressants on chronic treatment. Rats were subjected to a conflict procedure during which lever pressing for food was suppressed by a conditioned signal for punishment and contingent electric foot shocks."&lt;ref&gt;Beaufour, C. C., Ballon, N., Le Bihan, C., Hamon, M., &amp; Thiébot, M. (1999). Effects of chronic antidepressants in an operant conflict procedure of anxiety in the rat. Pharmacology, Biochemistry And Behavior, 62(4), 591-599. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091305798001804 doi:10.1016/S0091-3057(98)00180-4]&lt;/ref&gt; In order to operate the experiment, researchers build anxiety by electrical shocks on rats gradually through a training in serval week. This process was what researchers called Conflict Procedure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7460">'''Contingent contagionism''' was a concept in 19th-century medical writing and [[epidemiology]] before the [[germ theory]], used as a qualified way of rejecting the application of the term "[[contagious disease]]" for a particular infection. For example, it could be stated that [[cholera]], or [[typhus]], was not contagious in a "healthy atmosphere", but might be contagious in an "impure atmosphere".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Brodhead Coventry|title=Epidemic Cholera: Its History, Causes, Pathology, and Treatment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nxI1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA51|accessdate=21 June 2013|year=1849|publisher=Geo. H. Derby &amp; Company|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contingent contagionism covered a wide range of views between "contagionist", and "anti-contagionist" such as held by supporters of the [[miasma theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/5/920.full|authorlink=George Davey Smith| last=Davey Smith|first=George |title=Commentary: Behind the Broad Street pump: aetiology, epidemiology and prevention of cholera in mid-19th century Britain| journal= [[International Journal of Epidemiology]] |volume=31| issue=5| pages=920–932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
A form of contingent contagionism was standard in medieval European medicine. [[Infectious disease|Contagion]] was not conceptualised as restricted to physical contact. A corruption of air could be transmitted from person to person, at short range.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zi.zavantag.com/tw_files2/urls_10/972/d-971010/7z-docs/1.pdf Irina Metzler, ''Disability in Medieval Europe'' (2006) (PDF)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717102417/http://zi.zavantag.com/tw_files2/urls_10/972/d-971010/7z-docs/1.pdf |date=2013-07-17 }}, at p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contagionists versus anticontagionists==
By the 1840s [[public health policy]], at least in the [[United Kingdom]], had become a battleground between contagionist and anti-contagionist parties. The former, in particular, supported [[quarantine]] measures against [[epidemic]]s (such as the [[cholera pandemic]]). The latter opposed quarantines. Anticontagionists, for example, argued that infection could be at a distance, from a cause that could be sporadic and possible diffused through the air, and taking advantage of "predisposed" individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Worboys|title=Spreading Germs: Disease Theories and Medical Practice in Britain, 1865-1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9WzQPQRnR8sC&amp;pg=PA39|accessdate=21 June 2013|date=16 October 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77302-7|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public health measures quite typically combined contagionist and anti-contagionist aspects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/contagion/cholera.html ocp.hul.harvard.edu, ''Cholera Epidemics in the 19th Century''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-contagionists, such as [[Florence Nightingale]] who was a convinced miasmatist, could collaborate with contingent contagionists on sanitary measures.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Holton, ''Feminine Authority and Social Order: Florence Nightingale's Conception of Nursing and Health Care'', Social Analysis: The International Journal of Social and Cultural Practice 
No. 15, Gender and Social Life (August 1984), pp. 59-72, at p. 60. Published by: Berghahn Books. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/23169278&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "filth theory"==
Decomposing organic waste, as "[[wikt:filth|filth]]", was considered implicated in many diseases, because of the gases it generated. The application of contingent contagionism could be that there was a contagious agent that was spread by filthy conditions. [[Sanitation]] as cleaning was therefore directly associated with [[public health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jon A. Peterson|title=The Birth of City Planning in the United States, 1840–1917|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYuFoHmaLiYC&amp;pg=PA32|accessdate=21 June 2013|date=6 August 2003|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-7210-5|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been commented that those involved in public health at this time, successful in bringing down death rates, "often attributed disease causation to levels farther up the causal chain than direct biological mechanisms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Willem Jozef Meine Martens|author2=A. Anthony J. McMichael|title=Environmental Change, Climate, and Health: Issues and Research Methods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kO3qBxyjbgIC&amp;pg=PA55|accessdate=21 June 2013|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43546-8|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ventilation==
''The Medico-chirurgical Review'' in 1824 wrote that it had "always advocated" the doctrine of contingent contagion in the case of [[yellow fever]] "and indeed in most fevers". Having mentioned [[William Pym]] (contagionist) and [[Edward Nathaniel Bancroft]] (anti-contagionist) as extremists, it went on to say (italics in the original)

&lt;blockquote&gt;That the yellow fever of the West Indies [...] is rarely contagious, ''under common circumstances of cleanliness and ventilation'', is as well ascertained as any fact in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[James Johnson (physician)|James Johnson]]|title=The Medico-chirurgical Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkDOzQwyzu0C&amp;pg=PA916|accessdate=21 June 2013|year=1824|publisher=S. Highley|page=916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Which it qualified in terms of overcrowding, and an outbreak in 1823 on the sloop ''HMS Bann''.

The influence of atmosphere on contagion was subject to a distinction: a "pure" atmosphere might effectively block airborne contagion, while an "impure" atmosphere was ineffective for that; or on the other hand "impure" atmosphere, as well as crowding and filth, might mean a disease could "acquire" the property of contagion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=René La Roche|title=Yellow Fever, Considered in Its Historical, Pathological, Etiological, and Therapeutical Relations: Including a Sketch of the Disease as it Has Occurred in Philadelphia from 1699 to 1854, with an Examination of the Connections Between it and the Fevers Known Under the Same Name in Other Parts of Temperate, as Well as in Tropical, Regions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XQ0DAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA566|accessdate=21 June 2013|year=1855|publisher=Blanchard and Lea|page=566}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "malignant microenvironment" could be to blame, a hypothesis that had a consensus behind it in the [[aetiology]] of the middle of the 19th century. Inadequate ventilation was one factor to which the consensus pointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles E. Rosenberg|title=Explaining Epidemics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fPKwBbrNGUgC&amp;pg=PA298|accessdate=21 June 2013|date=28 August 1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39569-4|page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zymotic theory==
{{details|Zymotic disease}}
Zymotic theory was an explanation of disease developed by [[Justus von Liebig]] and [[William Farr]] in the 1840s. A form of contingent contagionism, it began with a hypothesis on decomposition of large complex molecules, depending on collision with other such molecules. It relied on [[fermentation]] as an underlying analogy for disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Hamlin|title=Cholera: The Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K9B-QKWYKTEC&amp;pg=PT198|accessdate=21 June 2013|date=8 October 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-158015-4|pages=198–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corneal topography''', also known as '''photokeratoscopy''' or '''videokeratography''', is a [[Non-invasive (medical)|non-invasive]] [[medical imaging]] technique for mapping the surface curvature of the [[cornea]], the outer structure of the [[human eye|eye]]. Since the cornea is normally responsible for some 70% of the eye's [[refractive power]],&lt;ref name="isbn0-7817-6512-9"&gt;{{ cite book | author = Pavan-Langston, Deborah | title = Manual of Ocular Diagnosis and Therapy | publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins | location = Hagerstown, MD | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-7817-6512-9 | oclc = | doi = | page = 405 }}&lt;/ref&gt; its topography is of critical importance in determining the quality of [[Visual perception|vision]] and corneal health.

The three-dimensional map is therefore a valuable aid to the examining [[ophthalmologist]] or [[optometrist]] and can assist in the diagnosis and treatment of a number of conditions; in planning [[cataract surgery]] and [[intraocular lens]] (IOL) implantation (plano or toric IOLs); in planning [[refractive surgery]] such as [[LASIK]], and evaluating its results; or in assessing the fit of [[contact lens]]es. A development of [[keratoscopy]], corneal topography extends the measurement range from the four points a few millimeters apart that is offered by [[keratometry]] to a grid of thousands of points covering the entire cornea. The procedure is carried out in seconds and is painless.

== Operation ==

The patient is seated facing the device, which is raised to eye level. One design consists of a bowl containing an illuminated pattern, such as a series of concentric rings. Another type uses a mechanically rotated arm bearing a light source. In either type, light is focused on the anterior surface of the patient's cornea and reflected back to a [[digital camera]] at the device. The topology of the cornea is revealed by the shape taken by the reflected pattern. A computer provides the necessary analysis, typically determining the position and height of several thousand points across the cornea. The [[topographical map]] can be represented in a number of graphical formats, such as a ''sagittal map'', which color-codes the steepness of curvature according to its [[dioptre|dioptric value]].

== Development ==
[[Image:Computerised Corneal Topography.jpg|thumb|left|A Medmont E300 topographer]]

The corneal topograph owes its heritage to the Portuguese ophthalmologist [[Antonio Placido]], who, in 1880, viewed a painted disk (''Placido's disk'') of alternating black and white rings reflected in the cornea.&lt;ref name=goss&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors= Goss D, Gerstman D| title= The Optical Science Underlying the Quantification of Corneal Contour: | journal= Indiana Journal of Optometry| year= 2000| volume= 3| issue= 1| pages= | url= http://www.opt.indiana.edu/IndJOpt/ijosum00.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rings showed as [[contour line]]s projected on the corneal tear film. Javal L., a pioneer in the field in the 1880s incorporated the rings in his ophthalmometer and mounted an eyepiece which magnified the image of the eye. He proposed that the image should be photographed or diagrammatically represented to allow analysis of the image.&lt;ref&gt;Corneal Topography measuring and modifying the cornea - Schanzlin 1992, page 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896, [[Allvar Gullstrand]] incorporated the disk in his [[ophthalmoscope]], examining photographs of the cornea via a microscope and was able to manually calculate the curvature by means of a numerical [[algorithm]]. Gullstrand recognized the potential of the technique and commented that despite its laboriousness it could "give a resultant accuracy that previously could not be obtained in any other way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Gullstrand A | title= Procedure of rays in the eye | journal= Helmholtz's Treatise on Physiological Optics| year= 1909| volume= | issue= | pages= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The flat field of Placido's disk reduced the accuracy close to the corneal periphery and in the 1950s the Wesley-Jessen company made use of a curved bowl to reduce the field defects.&lt;ref name=goss/&gt; The curvature of the cornea could be determined from comparison of photographs of the rings against standardized images.

In the 1980s, photographs of the projected images became hand-digitized and then analysed by computer. Automation of the process soon followed with the image captured by a digital camera and passed directly to a computer.&lt;ref&gt;Busin M, Wilmanns I, Spitznas M. ''Automated corneal topography: computerized analysis of photokeratoscope images.'' Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol. 1989;227(3):230-6. {{PMID|2737484}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, systems became commercially available from a number of suppliers. The first completely automatic system was the Corneal Modeling System (CMS-1) developed by Computed Anatomy, Inc. in New York City, under the direction of Martin Gersten and a group of surgeons at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary. The price of the early instruments was initially very high ($75,000), largely confining their use to research establishments. However, prices have fallen substantially over time, bringing corneal topographs into the budget of smaller [[clinic]]s and increasing the number of patients that can be examined.

== Use ==

[[File:Corneal topography, stage II keratoconus (Elise A. Slim et al.).svg|thumb|Corneal topography showing stage II [[keratoconus]].]]
Computerized corneal topography can be employed for diagnostics. It is, in fact, one of the exams the patients have to undergo prior to the [[Cross-linking (surgery)|Cross-linking]] and the Mini Asymmetric Radial Keratotomy (M.A.R.K.). For example, the ''KISA% index'' (keratometry, I-S, skew percentage, astigmatism) is used to arrive at a diagnosis of [[keratoconus]], to screen the suspect keratoconic patients and analyse the degree of corneal steepness changes in healthy relatives.&lt;ref name="pmid10511930"&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Rabinowitz YS, Rasheed K |title=KISA% index: a quantitative videokeratography algorithm embodying minimal topographic criteria for diagnosing keratoconus |journal=Journal of cataract and refractive surgery |volume=25 |issue=10 |pages=1327–35 |date=October 1999 |pmid=10511930 |doi= 10.1016/S0886-3350(99)00195-9|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0886-3350(99)00195-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, topography in itself is a measurement of the first reflective surface of the eye (tearfilm) and is not giving any additional information beside the shape of this layer expressed in curvature. [[Keratoconus]] in itself is a pattern of the entire cornea, therefore every measurement just focusing on one layer, might not be enough for a state of the art diagnosis. Especially early cases of keratoconus might be missed by a plain topographic measurement, which is critical if refractive surgery is being considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osnsupersite.com/view.aspx?rid=18013 |title=Placido-based corneal topography outdated, limited in scope &amp;#124; Ophthalmology |publisher=Osnsupersite.com |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measurement is also sensitive to unstable tearfilms. Also, the alignment of the measurement can be difficult, especially with eyes that have Keratoconus, a significant astigmatism, or sometimes after refractive surgery.

Corneal topography instruments generate a measurement called simulated keratometry (SimK), which approximates the classic measurement of the widely used [[keratometer]]. Another novel use of corneal topographic data is called CorT, which has been shown to quantify refractive [[astigmatism]] more accurately than SimK and other approaches.&lt;ref name="Alpins2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alpins|first=Noel|author2=JK Ong |author3=G Stamatelatos |title=New method of quantifying corneal topographic astigmatism that corresponds with manifest refractive cylinder|journal=Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery|year=2012|volume=38|issue=11|pages=1978–1988|doi=10.1016/j.jcrs.2012.07.026|pmid=23010252}}&lt;/ref&gt; CorT utilizes data from all Placido rings across the cornea compared with SimK, which is based on only one ring.&lt;ref name="Biro"&gt;{{cite news|last=Biro|first=A|title=New measurement method quantifies corneal astigmatism|url=http://www.healio.com/ophthalmology/refractive-surgery/news/print/ocular-surgery-news/%7B8437E8A7-A8C3-4020-AFA6-430EC5792B3F%7D/New-measurement-method-quantifies-corneal-astigmatism|accessdate=2017-05-06|newspaper=Ocular Surgery News.

While corneal topography relies on reflected light from the front (anterior) of the cornea, a technique called [[corneal tomography]] also provides a measure of the back (posterior) shape of the cornea.&lt;ref name="MedscapeFung"&gt;Fung, MW, et al (2015).

'''Department of Community Medicine, [[St Thomas's Hospital Medical School]], [[London]]''' was the foremost centre for public health research in the UK in the 1970s and 1980s.{{CN|date=April 2018}}Some of its records are held in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=St. Thomas' Department of Community Medicine|url= http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C582156|accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was established in 1968 by [[Walter W. Holland]] who subsequently obtained core funding from the UK Department of Health to establish the integral interdisciplinary '''Social Medicine and Health Services Research Unit'''.  Holland directed the department and unit until 1994. 

In the 1980s the medical school merged with [[Guy’s Hospital|Guy's Hospital Medical School]] and subsequently became part of [[King’s College London]].

{{More references|date=March 2012}}
In [[epidemiology]], an [[infection]] is said to be '''endemic''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἐν ''en'' "in, within" and δῆμος ''demos'' "people") in a [[population]] when that infection is constantly maintained at a baseline level in a geographic area without external inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles of Epidemiology in Public Health Practice, Third Edition An Introduction to Applied Epidemiology and Biostatistics|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ophss/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson1/section11.html|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[chickenpox]] is endemic (steady state) in the [[UK]], but [[malaria]] is not. Every year, there are a few cases of malaria reported in the UK, but these do not lead to sustained transmission in the population due to the lack of a suitable [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] (mosquitoes of the genus ''[[Anopheles]]''). While it might be common to say that [[AIDS]] is "endemic" in Africa, meaning found in an area, this is a use of the word in its etymological, rather than epidemiological, form. [[AIDS_in_Africa|AIDS cases in Africa]] are increasing, so the disease is not in an endemic steady state. It is correct to call the spread of AIDS in Africa an [[epidemic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV and AIDS in East and Southern Africa regional overview|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/sub-saharan-africa/overview|website=AVERT|language=en|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an infection that relies on person-to-person transmission to be endemic, each person who becomes infected with the disease must pass it on to one other person on average. Assuming a completely susceptible population, that means that the [[basic reproduction number]] (R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) of the infection must equal 1. In a population with some [[immune system|immune]] individuals, the basic reproduction number multiplied by the proportion of [[susceptible]] individuals in the population (''S'') must be 1. This takes account of the [[probability]] of each individual to whom the disease may be [[transmission (medicine)|transmitted]] being susceptible to it, effectively discounting the immune sector of the population. So, for a disease to be in an '''endemic steady state''' it is: &lt;math&gt;R_0 \times S = 1&lt;/math&gt;

In this way, the infection neither dies out nor does the number of infected people increase [[Exponential growth|exponentially]] but the infection is said to be in an endemic steady state. An infection that starts as an [[epidemic]] will eventually either die out (with the possibility of it resurging in a theoretically predictable cyclical manner) or reach the endemic steady state, depending on a number of factors, including the [[force of infection|virulence]] of the disease and its [[transmission (medicine)|mode of transmission]].

If a disease is in endemic steady state in a population, the relation above allows us to estimate the [[basic reproduction number|R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] (an important [[parameter]]) of a particular infection. This in turn can be fed into the [[Mathematical modelling in epidemiology|mathematical model]] of an epidemic.

'''Figure 1''' is a Toronto, Ontario-based online social networking service for healthcare professionals to post and comment on medical images.

Figure 1 was founded in Toronto by Dr. Joshua Landy, Richard Penner and [[Gregory Levey]]. The platform launched in North America in May 2013 and is now available in more than 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Like Instagram for doctors, Figure 1 app now has 500,000 users|url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-growth/like-instagram-for-doctors-figure-1-app-now-has-500000-users/article26374609/|website = The Globe and Mail|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The privately held company reports more than 1 million healthcare professionals use its app and website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=SILCOFF |first1=SEAN |title='Instagram for doctors' Figure 1 reaches a million users, adds messaging tool |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/startups/instagram-for-doctors-adds-messaging-tool-after-reaching-a-million-users/article29589235/ |accessdate=27 August 2018 |date=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
In 2013, Figure 1 launched with $2 million (CDN) in seed money, with Rho Canada Ventures and Version One Ventures led the investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Medicine’s Answer to Instagram, Figure 1, Raises C$2M|url = https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2013/12/09/medicines-answer-to-instagram-figure-1-raises-c2m/|date = 2013-12-09|accessdate = 2015-11-25|first = Lora|last = Kolodny}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the company added $5 million (USD) to its Series A financing round,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Daily Startup: Figure 1 Snaps Up $5 Million for Medical Image-Sharing App|url = https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2015/10/14/the-daily-startup-figure-1-snaps-up-5-million-for-medical-image-sharing-app/|date = 2015-10-14|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was led by [[Union Square Ventures]], an early investor in [[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]], [[Etsy]], and [[Kickstarter]].

This brings the total round to $9 million (USD).

== Reception ==
Critics have called Figure 1's content "gross&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Physicians use 'Instagram of doctors' to share medical oddities|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3029815/Instagram-doctors-physicians-use-app-share-anatomical-wonders-average-person-extremely-GROSS.html|website = Mail Online|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;" and "gruesome".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = I'm addicted to the gruesome and beautiful photos on this Instagram for doctors|url = https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/6/8341217/figure-1-medical-images-sharing-app|website = The Verge|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The app's founder said the "very colourful images" are what medics see every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Instagram for doctors' to be launched in Europe - BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-29521986|website = BBC News|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It's a transparent view into a world you rarely get to see," he told the BBC.

When the company launched in Europe in 2014, privacy concerns were raised over the sharing of personal medical information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Aux Etats-Unis, les médecins ont leur propre Instagram pour s’entraider|url = http://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2015/10/23/aux-etats-unis-les-medecins-ont-leur-propre-instagram-pour-s-entraider_4795879_4408996.html|newspaper = Le Monde.fr|access-date = 2015-11-25|issn = 1950-6244|language = fr|first = Florian|last = Reynaud}}&lt;/ref&gt; The app has a built-in consent form which every patient signs via a smartphone, as well as tools make it easy to anonymize an image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Canadian medical image app number one in the US|url = http://www.cmaj.ca/content/185/12/E569|journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal|date = 2013-09-03|issn = 0820-3946|pmc = 3761029|pmid = 23857853|pages = E569-E569|volume = 185|issue = 12|doi = 10.1503/cmaj.109-4527|first = Karen|last = Birchard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the company launched in 2013, it claimed that 13 percent of medical professionals were already using their smartphones to share images with one another via email or text message.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Instagram for doctors: How one app is solving medical mysteries|url = https://www.vox.com/2014/9/7/6111685/instagram-for-doctors-figure-1-app|website = Vox|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GA²LEN''', or '''Global Allergy and Asthma European Network''', is a consortium of leading European research centres specialized in allergic diseases, which include asthma. Funded by the European Union under the [[Sixth Framework Programme|6th Framework Programme]], GA²LEN addresses the growing public health concern of allergic diseases.

Research teams were chosen for their scientific excellence, their record on multidisciplinary working and international collaboration, and their educational activities. Since the launch of the Network, it has grown to include an additional 50 collaborating centres making GA²LEN one of the largest multidisciplinary networks of researchers in allergy and asthma worldwide.

== Integrating European research ==

Europe has produced some of the most important recent findings on allergy and asthma, but research tends to be fragmented in different institutes and even in different departments of the same organization. Findings are not always shared nor rapidly translated into changes in practice. The GA²LEN Network of Excellence (NoE) exists to help integrate research activities in Europe and to establish the structure for a European Research Area of excellence in allergy and asthma that will endure.

== Spreading knowledge and excellence ==

The network aims to accelerate the application of research results into clinical practice, to meet the needs of patients, and to help guide policy development. It also aims to promote training and greater integration between public and private sectors in this medical field.

By addressing allergy and asthma in their totality, GA²LEN’s ultimate objective is to benefit the well-being of patients by decreasing the burden of allergic diseases in Europe.

==Terms==
{{glossary}}

{{Anchor|Anterior}} {{term|term= Anterior }}{{defn|1= The direction towards the front of the head or the lips, as opposed to ''posterior'', which refers to the directions towards the back of an individual's head.

{{Anchor|Apical}} {{term|term= Apical }}{{defn|1= The direction towards the root tip(s) or apex(es) of a tooth (the apices), as opposed to ''coronal'', which refers to the direction towards the crown.  It may also refer to something relating to the roots, such as ''apical support''.  When referring to direction in relation to entities on or of the crown, this term can be synonymous with both ''cervical'' and ''gingival''.&lt;ref name="Wheelers" /&gt;}}

{{Anchor|Axial}} {{term|term= Axial }}{{defn|1= A [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] parallel to the surface of a tooth.  For example, if a drill bur would be inserted into a tooth from any side (''proximal'', ''vestibular'', ''oral''), the depth of the hole is defined from the axial wall of the hole (from the long axis walls (vertical surfaces bounding the tooth)).&lt;ref name="Wheelers" /&gt;}}

{{Anchor|Buccal}} {{term|term= Buccal }}{{defn|1= The side of a tooth that is adjacent to (or the direction towards) the inside of the [[cheek]], as opposed to ''lingual'' or ''palatal'' (both ''oral''), which refer to the side of a tooth adjacent to (or the direction towards) the [[tongue]] or [[palate]], respectively, the oral cavity.  Although technically referring only to posterior teeth (where the cheeks are present instead of lips, use of this term has incorrectly extended to all teeth, anterior and posterior), this term has inaccurately been employed to describe the ''vestibular'' surface of (or directions in relation to) anterior teeth as well.&lt;ref name="Wheelers" /&gt;}}

{{Anchor|Cervical}} {{term|term= Cervical }}{{defn|1= Means ''neck'' in [[Latin]] (as in [[cervical vertebrae]]), and refers to the narrowing of the contours of the tooth surface at or near the [[cementoenamel junction|CEJ]], where the crown meets the root.  When referring to direction in relation to entities on or of the crown, it is nearly synonymous with both ''apical'' and ''gingival''.&lt;ref name="Wheelers" /&gt;}}

{{Anchor|Coronal}} {{term|term= Coronal }}{{defn|1= The direction towards the crown of a tooth, as opposed to ''apical'', which refers to the direction towards the tip(s) of the root(s) or apex(es).  It may also refer to something relating to the crown, such as ''coronal forces''.&lt;ref name="Wheelers" /&gt;}}

[[Image:Directions.jpg|300px|thumb|right|This [[radiograph|X-ray film]] depicts some of the teeth in the lower right quadrant.

{{Anchor|Distal}} {{term|term= Distal }}{{defn|1= The direction towards the gingiva beyond the tooth furthest from the ''anterior'' midline (the 'most ''posterior'' tooth' or last tooth) in each [[#Quadrant|quadrant]] of a [[dental arch]], as opposed to ''mesial'', which refers to the direction towards the anterior [[dental midline|midline]].  Each tooth can be described as having a distal surface and, for ''posterior'' teeth, a ''distobuccal (DB)'' and a ''distolingual (DL)'' corner or [[cusp (dentistry)|cusp]].&lt;ref name="Wheelers" /&gt;}}

{{Anchor|Facial}} {{term|term= Facial }}{{defn|1= The side of a tooth that is adjacent to (or the direction towards) the inside of the [[lip]]s, as opposed to ''lingual'' or ''palatal'' (both ''oral''), which refer to the side of a tooth adjacent to (or the direction towards) the [[tongue]] or [[palate]], respectively, the oral cavity.  However, this term has been incorrectly used as an [[umbrella term]] for both the term ''buccal'' and ''labial'', being also applied to the side of a tooth that is adjacent to (or the direction towards) the inside of the [[cheek]] (instead of the more accurate term, vestibular).&lt;ref name="Wheelers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AVDC Nomenclature Committee (2012) 'Recommendations from the AVDC Nomenclature Committee adopted by the AVDC Board', American Veterinary Dental College.

{{Anchor|Gingival}} {{term|term= Gingival }}{{defn|1= The direction towards the [[gingiva]] (gums), synonymous with ''cervical'' and similar to apical.  However, locations on teeth already more ''apical'' to the interface of the crown and root, referred to as the [[cementoenamel junction|CEJ]], tend not to be described using this term, as it would lead to confusion, as the exact definition is ambiguous.  Additionally, this term would not be used when referring to a tooth ''[[ex vivo]]''.&lt;ref name="Wheelers" /&gt;}}

{{Anchor|Incisal}} {{term|term= Incisal }}{{defn|1= The direction towards the biting edge of ''anterior'' teeth or something relating to this edge, such as the terms ''incisal guidance'' or ''incisal edge''.  This is the sister term to ''occlusal'', which related to the analogous location on ''posterior'' teeth.&lt;ref name="Wheelers" /&gt;}}

{{Anchor|Inferior}} {{term|term= Inferior }}{{defn|1= The direction towards the feet of a human's body, as opposed to ''superior'', which refers to the direction towards the head.  However, use of these terms should enjoy only limited usage when discussing features of a tooth, as, for example, something more inferior on a [[human mandible|mandibular]] tooth will be situated more superior on a [[maxilla]]ry tooth, as they exhibit an inverted relationship.  It is for this reason that the terms ''coronal'' and ''apical'' are substituted.&lt;ref name="Wheelers" /&gt;}}

{{Anchor|Interproximal}} {{term|term= Interproximal }}{{defn|1= An adjective meaning between teeth.

{{Anchor|Labial}} {{term|term= Labial }}{{defn|1= The side of a tooth that is adjacent to (or the direction towards) the inside of the [[lip]] (labium), as opposed to ''lingual'' or ''palatal'' (both ''oral''), which refer to the side of a tooth adjacent to (or the direction towards) the [[tongue]] or [[palate]], respectively, the oral cavity.  Although technically referring only to anterior teeth (where the lips (labia) are present instead of cheeks), use of the term ''buccal'' has inaccurately extended to all teeth, anterior and posterior (instead of vestibular, the [[umbrella term]]).&lt;ref name="Wheelers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ADAterms" /&gt;}}

{{Anchor|Lingual}} {{term|term= Lingual }}{{defn|1= The side of a tooth adjacent to (or the direction towards) the tongue (lingua, compare linguistics and language), as opposed to ''buccal'', ''labial'', or ''vestibular'' which refer to the side of a tooth adjacent to (or the direction towards) the inside of the cheek or lips, respectively.  Although this term is technically specific to the [[human mandible|mandible]], it enjoys extensive use in reference to the [[maxilla]] as well (see '''Palatal''').&lt;ref name="Wheelers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ADAterms" /&gt;}}

{{Anchor|Mandibular}} {{term|term= Mandibular }}{{defn|1= Entities related to the [[human mandible|mandible]], or lower jaw.&lt;ref name="Wheelers" /&gt;}}

{{Anchor|Marginal}} {{term|term= Marginal }}{{defn|1= A number of different 'margins' that are involved in dentistry.  The edge of tooth structure that is prepared to meet the edge of a prosthetic [[crown (dentistry)|crown]] is called a margin, as is the aforementioned edge of the crown; an example of this usage would be "a poorly fitting crown might exhibit ''marginal'' leakage."  The [[gingiva]] and [[alveolar bone|bone]] that abut the teeth are referred to as 'marginal', as in ''marginal'' [[periodontitis]].  The bulk of tooth structure on the ''occlusal'' surface at the point of contact of posterior teeth is referred to as the ''marginal'' ridge.&lt;ref name="Wheelers" /&gt;}}

{{Anchor|Maxillary}} {{term|term= Maxillary }}{{defn|1= Entities related to the [[maxilla]], or upper jaw.&lt;ref name="Wheelers" /&gt;}}

{{Anchor|Mesial}} {{term|term= Mesial }}{{defn|1= The direction towards the anterior [[dental midline|midline]] in a dental arch, as opposed to ''distal'', which refers to the direction towards the gingiva beyond the tooth furthest from the ''anterior'' midline (the 'most ''posterior'' tooth' or last tooth) in each quadrant.  Each tooth can be described as having a mesial surface and, for ''posterior'' teeth, a ''mesiobuccal (MB)'' and a ''mesiolingual (ML)'' corner or [[cusp (dentistry)|cusp]].&lt;ref name="Wheelers" /&gt;}}

{{Anchor|Oral}} {{term|term= Oral }}{{defn|1= The side of a tooth adjacent to (or the direction towards) the oral cavity, as opposed to ''buccal'', ''labial'' or ''vestibular'', which refer to the side of a tooth adjacent to (or the direction towards) the inside of the cheek, lips or vestibule respectively.  This term is an [[umbrella term]] for both the term ''palatal'' and ''lingual''.  Alternatively, the term lingual has been used as a blanket term instead although this specifically refers only to the side of a tooth that is adjacent to (or the direction towards) the [[tongue]], technically specific to the [[human mandible|mandible]].&lt;ref name="Wheelers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ADAterms" /&gt;}}

{{Anchor|Palatal}} {{term|term= Palatal }}{{defn|1= The side of a tooth adjacent to (or the direction towards) the [[palate]], as opposed to ''buccal'', ''labial'' or ''vestibular'' which refer to the side of a tooth adjacent to (or the direction towards) the inside of the cheek, lips and vestibule of the mouth respectively. This term is strictly used in the [[maxilla]].&lt;ref name="Wheelers" /&gt;}}

{{Anchor|Posterior}} {{term|term= Posterior }}{{defn|1= The direction towards the back of an individual's head, as opposed to ''anterior'', which refers to the directions towards an individual's lips. The term [[posterior teeth]] refers to [[premolar]]s and [[Molar (tooth)|molars]], as opposed to [[incisor]]s and [[Canine tooth|canines]], which are ''anterior teeth''.&lt;ref name="Wheelers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ADAterms" /&gt;}}

==Combining of terms==
[[Image:MO inlay of 3.jpg|200px|thumb|right|This photo shows teeth #2-5 ([[Universal numbering system (dental)|Universal numbering system]]).  Tooth #3, the upper right first [[molar (tooth)|molar]], has an MO (mesial-occlusal) [[gold]] [[inlays and onlays|inlay]].  This molar is both posterior, as well as distal, to the [[premolar]]s in front of it.]]

Most of the principal terms can be combined using their corresponding [[classical compound|combining forms]] (such as ''mesio-'' for ''mesial'' and ''disto-'' for ''distal''). They provide names for directions (vectors) and axes; for example, the coronoapical axis is the long axis of a tooth. Such combining yields terms such as those in the following list. The abbreviations should be used only in restricted contexts, where they are explicitly defined and help avoid extensive repetition (for example, a journal article that uses the term "mesiodistal" dozens of times might use the abbreviation "MD"). The abbreviations are ambiguous: (1) they are not specific to these terms; (2) they are not even one-to-one specific within this list; and (3) some of the combined terms are little used, and the abbreviations of the latter are even less used. Therefore, spelling out is best.

The combined terms include apicocoronal (AC), buccoapical (BA), buccocervical (BC), buccogingival (BG), buccolabial (BL), buccolingual (BL), bucco-occlusal (BO), buccopalatal (BP), coronoapical (CA), distoapical (DA), distobuccal (DB), distocervical (DC), distocoronal (DC), distogingival (DG), distolingual (DL), disto-occlusal or distoclusal (DO), distopalatal (DP), linguobuccal (LB), linguo-occlusal (LO), mesioapical (MA), mesiobuccal (MB), mesiocervical (MC), mesiocoronal (MC), mesiodistal (MD), mesiogingival (MG), mesio-occlusal or mesioclusal (MO), mesiopalatal (MP).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21449">[[Image:BrazilAIDSlogo.jpg|right|thumb|275px|Brazilian AIDS program logo]]
The first '''[[AIDS]]''' case identified '''in [[Brazil]]''' was in 1982. Infection rates climbed exponentially throughout the 1980s, and in 1990 the [[World Bank]] famously predicted 1,200,000 cases by 2000, approximately double the actual number that was later reported by the [[Ministry of Health (Brazil)|Brazilian Ministry of Health]] and most international organizations. South and Southeast have 75% or more of this infection (Rio Grande do Sul, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro). The Northeast has 33% of the population but only 10% of AIDS.

The Brazilian experience is frequently cited as a model for other developing countries facing the [[AIDS epidemic]], including the internationally controversial policies of the Brazilian government such as the universal provision of [[antiretroviral drug]]s (ARVs), [[progressivism|progressive]] social policies toward risk groups, and collaboration with [[non-governmental organizations]].

==History==
Brazil's first AIDS case was reported in 1982. Brazil’s AIDS response was crafted in 1985, just after the country had returned [[1980s in Brazil|from military rule to democracy]], at a time when only four AIDS cases had been reported.&lt;ref name="TeixeiraS6"&gt;Teixeira et al., 2004, S6.&lt;/ref&gt; The Brazilian Ministry of Health laid the groundwork for a National AIDS Control Program (NACP) which was established in 1986, and placed under the aegis of the National AIDS Control Committee, a group composed of scientists and members of civil society organizations, in 1987. The program was reorganized again in 1992 with more emphasis on linkages between government and NGOs.&lt;ref name="LeviVitP2373"&gt;Levi and Vitória, 2002, p. 2373&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LeviVitP2374"&gt;Levi and Vitória, 2002, p. 2374.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[AIDS Project I]] garnered $90 million in domestic funds and a $160 million loan from the [[World Bank]] between 1992 and 1998. [[AIDS Project II]] also composed of both domestic funds and a World Bank loan totaled $370 million between 1998 and 2002.&lt;ref name="LeviVitP2374" /&gt;

In 1990&amp;mdash;a year when more than 10,000 new cases were reported&amp;mdash;the World Bank estimated that Brazil would have 1,200,000 in infections by 2000. However, by 2002, there were fewer than 600,000 estimated infections, less than half the prediction.&lt;ref name="Ministry of Health of Brazil, 2003"&gt;Ministry of Health of Brazil, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government policies==

===Universal ARV provision===
{{See also|Cost of HIV treatment}}
The single most controversial element of the Brazilian HIV/AIDS response remains the free, universal provision of [[anti-retroviral drugs]] (ARVs), including [[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitors]], starting in December 1996 with federal law 9313. The guidelines for antiretroviral therapy (ART) are formulated annually by a Support Committee which determines the diagnostic guidelines and the contents of the ARV cocktail.&lt;ref name="LeviVitP2378"&gt;Levi and Vitória, 2002, p. 2378.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2003, 125,000 Brazilians received free ART treatment, accounting for 100% of the total registered AIDS cases but only 20% of the estimated AIDS cases.&lt;ref name="Ministry of Health of Brazil, 2003"/&gt;

ART was traditionally viewed as too expensive in resource-poor settings in [[developing countries]], which are believed to have a poor capacity for adherence to complicated treatments.&lt;ref&gt;Colebunders et al., 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2004 study of 322 outpatient services in Brazil&amp;mdash;comprising 87,000 patients&amp;mdash;found the rate of adherence to be 75%.&lt;ref&gt;Nemes et al., 2004, S15.&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors also argue that if the decline in hospital admissions and ambulatory care are taken into account, the policy of universal provision of ART has accumulated a net savings of approximately $200 million.&lt;ref name="TeixeiraS6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TeixeiraS7"&gt;Teixeira et al.,2004, S7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of Brazil, some have challenged the degree to which improvements in public health can be attributed to ART as opposed to other factors. For example, a 2002 World Bank Policy Research Working Paper, states:&lt;ref&gt;Novaes et al., 2002, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;
:''The impact caused by the introduction of therapeutic measures, like the antiretrovirals in their different compositions and associations and/or health promotion and protection measured, though evident, has not been completely explored yet.''
	
A 2003 study, using data from diagnoses occurring in Brazil in 1995 and 1996, found that antiretroviral treatment was the single greatest predictor of survival.&lt;ref name="MarinsP1675"&gt;Marins et al., 2003, p. 1675.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors demonstrate that variables like year of diagnosis, higher education, sexual exposure category, gender, the presence of specific pathogens all appeared to predict survival in a univariate analysis; however, in a multivariate analysis only antiretroviral treatment, diagnostic criteria, and transmission category remained significant.&lt;ref name="MarinsP1678-80"&gt;Marins et al., 2003, p. 1678-1680.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors conclude that no factor other than ART "could reasonably explain the very large increase in survival observed" between the 1980s and 1996.&lt;ref name="MarinsP1681"&gt;Marins et al., 2000, p. 1681.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social policies===
Brazil's response has been characterized by reaching out to groups which account for a high percentage of AIDS transmission, including relationships with [[non-governmental organization]]s. For example, in contrast to many parts of the world, [[condoms]] were prioritized early and aggressively. Condom use in first sexual intercourse increased from 4% in 1986 to 48% in 1999 and to 55% in 2003, spurred by government programs to increase awareness, decrease the price, and increase the availability of condoms.&lt;ref name="Ministry of Health of Brazil, 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LeviVitP2375"&gt;Levi and Vitória, 2002, p. 2375.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prostitute]] groups were involved in the distribution of information materials and condoms.&lt;ref name=wp&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/01/AR2006030102316.html Where Prostitutes Also Fight AIDS], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 2 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Needle-exchange programme|needle exchange programs]] were implemented.  The prevalence of HIV among injecting drug users (IDUs) fell from 52% in 1999 to 41.5% in 2001.  12 needle exchange programs were implemented between 1994 and 1998; 40 had been implemented by 2000, distributing 1,500,000 syringes in just a year.&lt;ref name="LeviVitP2375" /&gt; HIV prevalence among IDU decreased even more dramatically in some cities.&lt;ref name="LeviVitP2375" /&gt; In 1988 comprehensive screening tests were implemented nationwide in [[blood bank]]s, following a similar program in [[São Paulo]] in 1986; however, the results of these programs were not realized fully until 2000 as a result of the [[incubation period]] of the virus, but new cases from blood transfusion became virtually non-existent at that time and new and more effective [[nucleic acid]] testing is being considered.&lt;ref name="LeviVitP2375" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LeviVitP2376"&gt;Levi and Vitória, 2002, p. 2376.&lt;/ref&gt; Mother-to-child transmission was similarly practically eradicated, falling to a transmission rate of 3%, a level comparable to most developed countries, with the implementation of [[zidovudine]] treatment regimes to mother and child and recommendations against [[breastfeeding]].&lt;ref name="LeviVitP2377"&gt;Levi and Vitória, 2002, p. 2377.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International conflict==

===Drug patents===
The average annual cost of ART per patient in 1997 was $4,469—compared to over $10,000 in most of the [[developed world]]—totaling only $242 million per annum.&lt;ref name="Szwarcwald, 2002"&gt;Szwarcwald, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2001, Brazil manufactured locally 8 of the 12 drugs in the national ARV cocktail; in 2003 and 2005, 8 of the 15.&lt;ref name="Gilman, 2001"&gt;Gilman, 2001; Brazilian National STD/AIDS Programme, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; If all of the drugs were patented imports, the cost of these ARV programs would increase by 32%.&lt;ref name="Szwarcwald, 2002"/&gt; In the period between 1996 and 2000, Brazil reduced treatment costs by 72.5% through import substitution; by contrast, the price of imports dropped by only 9.6%.&lt;ref name="Gilman, 2001" /&gt; Brazil has saved over US $1.1 billion in the cost of providing universal access to ART by producing anti-retroviral medications generically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berkman|first=Alan|author2=Jonathan Garcia |author3=Miguel Munox-Laboy |author4=Vera Paiva |author5=Richard Parker |title=A Critical Analysis of the Brazilian Response to HIV/AIDS: Lessons Learned for Controlling and Mitigating the Epidemic in Developing Countries|journal=American Journal of Public Health|year=2005|volume=95|pages=1162–1172 |doi=10.2105/ajph.2004.054593 |pmid=15933232 |pmc=1449335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 71 of the 1997 Brazilian patent law requires that foreign products be manufactured in Brazil within three years of receiving a [[patent]]. If a foreign company does not comply, Brazil may authorize a local company to produce the drug without the consent of the patent holder, a tactic known as "[[compulsory licensing]]" or the "bargaining chip and as a last resort."&lt;ref&gt;Oxfam GB, 2001, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Article 68 authorizes "parallel importing" from the lowest international generic bidder, effectively destroying the patent holder’s [[monopoly]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;Oxfam GB, 2001, p. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prodded by domestic pharmaceutical lobbies, the U.S. challenged Article 68 within the framework of the [[World Trade Organization]]'s [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPs) regime for allegedly discriminating against imported products; Article 71&amp;mdash;to the chagrin of many companies&amp;mdash;was not included in the complaint. In addition, the U.S. placed Brazil on the "[[Special 301]]" watch list, opening the possibility for "unilateral sanctions," and companies individually threatened to pull out of the Brazilian market altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Oxfam GB, 2001, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil argued that the law only applied to cases where the patent holder abuses their economic power, a loophole specifically allowed by the TRIPS agreement.&lt;ref name="Gilman, 2001" /&gt;  Advocates of [[intellectual property rights]] (IPR) worldwide condemned the actions of the Brazilian government. For example, Slavi Pachovski, a member of the [[Institute for Trade, Standards and Sustainable Development]], argues:&lt;ref&gt;Pachovski, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''If this trend proceeds, it will be a global pandemic of AIDS that will grow uncontrollable because the Brazilian move will destroy the whole legal order that is the basis for developing new drugs and continuing research.''

The pharmaceutical companies were not just afraid of the immediate loss of the Brazilian market, but with the larger implications of other developing countries following Brazil’s example. Large developing countries, like [[Argentina]] and [[India]], with large industrial capacities and evolving intellectual property regimes are the true [[elephant in the room]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxfam GB, 2001, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil invoked the Article 71 for the first time on August 22, 2001, when [[José Serra]], Brazil’s Minister of Health, authorized [[Far Manguinhos]]&amp;mdash;a Brazilian pharmaceutical company&amp;mdash;to produce [[Nelfinavir]], a drug patented by [[Pfizer]] but licensed to [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]] in the Brazilian market. This unilateral action prompted a flurry of negotiations where Roche and [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]] agreed to reduce the prices of five drugs by 40-65%.  An advertisement distributed by the Brazilian government proclaimed: "Local manufacturing of many of the drugs used in the anti-AIDS cocktail is not a declaration of war against the drugs industry. It is simply a fight for life."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Wadia, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil carried out such a compulsory licensing threat for the first time in May 2007, on [[efavirenz]], produced by Merck.&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;''[[The Economist]]''. May 12, 2007. "Brazil's AIDS programme: A conflict of goals." p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreements signed on November 14, 2001 at the WTO conference in [[Qatar]] reaffirmed that TRIPs "does not and should not prevent Members from taking measures to protect public health" including "medicines for all."&lt;ref name="Gilman, 2001" /&gt; That same year, the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] affirmed access to AIDS drugs as a [[human right]] unanimously, with the exception of the [[abstention]] of the [[United States]].

===Prostitution===
Two 2003 [[United States]] laws&amp;mdash;one related to AIDS, the other to [[sex trafficking]]&amp;mdash;required all recipients of U.S. assistance to sign a [[anti-prostitution pledge|pledge denouncing prostitution]], even if U.S. funds are not used for projects directly related to prostitution.&lt;ref name="Phillips and Moffett, 2005"&gt;Phillips and Moffett, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Brazil wrote to the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) declining to condemn prostitution, effectively rejecting the remainder of a grant for $48 million between 2003 and 2006.&lt;ref name="Phillips and Moffett, 2005"/&gt; In 2006, USAID officially declared Brazil ineligible to renew the AIDS prevention grant because Brazil would not condemn prostitution as "dehumanizing and degrading."&lt;ref name="Reel, 2006"&gt;Reel, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil considered its partnerships with prostitutes&amp;mdash;in distributing contraceptives, educating the public about the disease, and voluntary testing&amp;mdash;critical to its overall AIDS prevention strategy. One Ministry of Health pamphlet depicts a character, "[[Maria Sem Vergonha]]" ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for "Maria that knows No Shame", but also a pun on the Brazilian name of the flowering genera "''[[Impatiens]] spp.''", ''maria-sem-vergonha''), a scantily-clad sex worker who encourages prostitutes to take pride in their work and use condoms.&lt;ref name="Reel, 2006"/&gt; [[Pedro Chequer]], director of Brazil’s National AIDS Control Programme, was quoted as saying "we can’t control [the disease] with principles that are [[Manichaean]], [[theological]], [[fundamentalist]] and [[Shiite]]"&lt;ref name="Phillips and Moffett, 2005"/&gt; and "sex workers are part of implementing our AIDS policy and deciding how to promote it. They are our partners. How could we ask prostitutes to take a position against themselves?"&lt;ref name=nation&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050530/kaplan Just Say Não], ''[[The Nation]]'', 12 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that Brazil has the largest population of Roman Catholics in the world, the Brazilian [[Roman Catholic Church]] has not demanded the [[abstinence]]-only prevention strategies, voicing only intermittent "mild complaints" about government programs which refuse to acknowledge moral or religious issues.&lt;ref name="Reel, 2006"/&gt;

==A "Brazilian model"==
Brazil’s Health Minister, [[José Serra]], said in 2001, "Our example could serve as a model for other countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, even Africa. Everyone in the world has the right to access these therapies."&lt;ref&gt;Wadia, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars, such as Levi and Vitória, argue that the Brazilian model can only be applied to other countries with similar level of economic development and civil society sectors.&lt;ref&gt;Levi and Vitória, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Galvão argues that the unique local conditions in Brazil complicate the application of the Brazilian experience to other regions with their own local problems and structures.&lt;ref&gt;Galvão, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[Washington Post]]'' article stated that the Brazilian anti-AIDS program is considered by the United Nations to be the most successful in the developing world,&lt;ref name="wp"/&gt; and ''[[The Economist]]'' echoed this position:&lt;ref name=wp/&gt; "no developing country has had more success in tackling AIDS than Brazil.

[[New York City]] was more affected by the [[HIV/AIDS in the United States|AIDS epidemic of the 1980s]] than any other American city.&lt;ref name=EncylopediaOfNYC-2010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Musto|first1=David F.|last2=Epstein|first2=Anne|editor1-last=Jackson|editor1-first=Kenneth T.|editor2-last=New York Historical Society|title=The Encyclopedia of New York City|date=2010|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=978-0-300-18257-6|edition=2nd|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/encyclopedia-of-new-york-city/oclc/842264684/viewport|accessdate=30 June 2016|chapter=AIDS: acquired immune deficiency syndrome|oclc=842264684}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16–17}} The [[AIDS]] epidemic has been and continues to be highly localized due to a number of complex socio-cultural factors that affect the interaction of the populous communities that inhabit New York.

During the 1980s epidemic, the large presence of the [[Gay Community|gay community]] prompted local medical practitioners to take note of and respond to observed patterns of reported ailments early on. Widespread fear and panic about the [[Epidemic (disambiguation)|epidemic]] were combatted by efforts of community activists and local government policies that were at some times supportive, and at other times damaging or ineffectual.

Improvements of both drug therapies and prevention education have led to a decreased number of AIDS cases.&lt;ref name=EncylopediaOfNYC-2010 /&gt;{{rp|16}} In June, 2014, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a new strategy designed to "End the Epidemic"  in the state through a combination of increased HIV screening and testing, promotion of Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and improved linkage and retention in clinical care for HIV-positive persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://etedashboardny.org/about/|title=About|work=Ending the Epidemic|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene reported a decline in new infections of nearly 8 percent annually or approximately 15% since the campaign was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2017/pr093-17.page|title=pr093-17|website=www1.nyc.gov|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical research ==

=== First response ===

Dr. [[Michael Simberkoff]], chief of staff of the Department of Veterans Affairs New York Harbor Medical Center, was a member of the [[Infectious diseases|Infectious Diseases]] staff in 1980 and was one of the first medical researchers to treat AIDS patients.&lt;ref name=LGWA-KochOralHistory-Simberkoff-2015&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simberkoff|first1=Dr. Michael|last2=Lieberman|first2=Richard K.|title=Koch Scholars interview: Dr. Michael Simberkoff 04-07-2015|date=7 April 2015|publisher=[[LaGuardia Community College]]/[[City University of New York|CUNY]]: [[La Guardia and Wagner Archives]], Edward I.

Soon it became clear that gay men were not the only ones who had the disease; intravenous drug abusers also appeared to get infected.&lt;ref name=LGWA-KochOralHistory-Simberkoff-2015 /&gt;{{rp|3}}
 
In  1983, the virus that causes AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) was identified and labeled as [[Lymphadenopathy Associated Virus]] (LAV) by Dr. [[Luc Montagnier]] at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in Paris. In 1984, it was also identified by Dr. [[Robert Gallo]] of [[National Cancer Institute]] and named the Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus (HTLV III). There was a conflict as to who first identified the virus, but it was resolved in a joint agreement. The virus was later renamed [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]] (HIV).&lt;ref name=NIH-EarlyYearsOfAIDS-2001&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harden|first1=Victoria Angela|last2=National Institutes of Health (U.S.)|title=In Their Own Words&amp;nbsp;...

=== First drug ===
The first drug used to treat HIV was called [[AZT]] which was  later known as zidovudine. It was made by [[Burroughs Wellcome]]. The clinical trials of the drug  were conducted at several [[VA Hospitals|VA hospitals]], including those in  New York,  [[Miami]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C]]. At the time of its release, it was the most expensive drug ever made, at $10,000 for a year of treatment.&lt;ref name=LGWA-KochOralHistory-Simberkoff-2015 /&gt;{{rp|11}}

==Gay community response - politics, rights, activism==
[[File:A pink triangle against a black backdrop with the words 'Silence=Death' representing an advertisement for The Silence = Death Project used by permission by ACT-UP, The AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power.

Poster features a [[pink triangle]] against a black backdrop.]]
The early history of the AIDS epidemic in New York City began with early rumors in 1981 of a "gay plague." Because AIDS first emerged among populations considered marginal by many mainstream residents of New York City, including prostitutes, drug users, and men who had sex with men, early responses to the disease were uneven and underfunded. Federal government response caused a delay in the wider recognition of the extent of the problem. As late as 1986, the Reagan administration continued to discourage panic by saying that AIDS primarily affected  gay men and intravenous drug users.&lt;ref name=GMHC-HIV-AIDS-Timeline&gt;{{cite web|title=GMHC/ HIV/AIDS Timeline|url=http://www.gmhc.org/about-us/gmhc-hivaids-timeline|website=[[Gay Men's Health Crisis|GMHC]]|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this early period, New Yorkers were not sufficiently informed about the disease: how you could get it, who could get affected, and the consequences of it. It was first described as being a rare form of cancer, called [[Kaposi's Sarcoma]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes-RareCancerSeen-1981&gt;{{cite news|last1=Altman|first1=Lawrence K.|title=Rare Cancer Seen in 41 Homosexuals|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/03/us/rare-cancer-seen-in-41-homosexuals.html|accessdate=30 June 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=3 July 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gay community organized a response to the epidemic through four stages: the development of community-based help and advocacy organizations such as the [[Gay Men's Health Crisis|Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC)]]; the evolution of broader advocacy, lobbying and funding organizations such as the [[American Foundation for AIDS Research]]; the formation of effective Washington lobbying groups; and the rise of militant activism exemplified by the radical tactics of [[ACT UP|ACT UP (AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power)]], which have been documented in over 180 interviews by the ACTUP Oral History Project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.actuporalhistory.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Health and gay rights organizations, such as the [[Gay Men's Health Crisis|Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC)]], worked on raising awareness. One of GMHC's strategies was setting up counseling tables in bathhouses. Jerry Johnson, the program's former leader found that half of the people who approached him were ignorant about the spread of the disease. The government then started to create initiatives to educate the population about reducing risk.

=== Education and support for risk reduction ===
Around 1985, public and private institutions started to create programs to educate the population. They began to hold informational meetings and public forums, distribute literature, and started outreach efforts such as a hotline for counseling and referrals. The HTLV-III Hotline started operating in 1982, offering counseling services for persons with AIDS.&lt;ref name=GMHC-HIV-AIDS-Timeline /&gt; The hotline staff met with social service providers, the New York State AIDS institute, the [[New York Blood Center]] and the Hemophilia Foundation in order to coordinate resources for post-test counseling programs. Evidence of 623 calls received during the period of April 20, 1985 to May 24, 1985 demonstrated effective of this program.&lt;ref name=KochPapers-Vol1-AIDS-2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koch|first1=Ed|last2=Levine|first2=Steven A.|last3=Tejeda|first3=Marcos|title=Mayor Edward Koch Papers: Selected Documents: Volume 1: AIDS|date=12 December 2007|publisher=LaGuardia Community College/CUNY, LaGuardia and Wagner Archives|location=Long Island City, N.Y.|url=http://www.laguardiawagnerarchive.lagcc.cuny.edu/FILES_DOC/Koch_FILES/HIGHLIGHTS/Koch_and_Aids.pdf|accessdate=2 July 2016|oclc=639301947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By June 10, 1985, the GMHC developed a contract to deliver comprehensive education of high risk gay men and youth in order for them to offer counseling and open more offices in the Bronx and Brooklyn, so more people could receive their services. This plan cost approximately $83,000 in the fiscal year 1986.&lt;ref name=KochPapers-Vol1-AIDS-2007 /&gt;

== Government response ==

=== Funding ===

In 1981, the New York City government was not prepared to deal with this health emergency, as the city was just recovering from the [[History of New York City (1946–77)#Fiscal crisis|fiscal crisis of the 1970s]], when Mayor [[Ed Koch]] took office. The direct cause of the fiscal crisis was the city's use of expensive short-term financing to cover its deficits in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=Soffer-EdKochReuildingNYC-2010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Soffer|first1=Jonathan M.|title=Ed Koch and the Rebuilding of New York City|date=2010|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-231-52090-4|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/ed-koch-and-the-rebuilding-of-new-york-city/oclc/750192934/viewport|oclc=750192934}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5–6}} At the beginning of the epidemic there was no funding from neither federal or city government. As Jonathan M. Soffer argues, "the ultimate blame for devastation of the city in the 1970s lies in Washington and the anti-urban administrations of [[Gerald Ford]], [[Jimmy Carter]], and [[Ronald Reagan]]."&lt;ref name=Soffer-EdKochReuildingNYC-2010 /&gt; It was the community organization [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]] that began raising funds to deal with this new disease by holding the first benefit to collect funds for the epidemic in 1982.&lt;ref name=Shilts-AndtheBandPlayedOn&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shilts|first1=Randy|title=And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic|date=2007|publisher=St Martin's Griffin|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-37463-1|edition=20th anniversary|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/and-the-band-played-on-politics-people-and-the-aids-epidemic/oclc/933473563/viewport|oclc=153577946}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|120?}} Only in the late 1980s did the city government fully put forth an effort to address the issue. This was largely because Health Commissioner Dr. Stephen Joseph took office in 1985, replacing [[Dr. David Judson Sencer]], who was criticized for not taking action during his term.&lt;ref name=Shilts-AndtheBandPlayedOn /&gt;{{rp|550}}&lt;ref name=NYTimes-Sencer-Obit-2011&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weber|first1=Bruce|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/04/us/04sencer.html|title=David J.

Kramer even claimed that "the mayor of New York is helping to kill us." Judge Joseph Lisa who was on the City Council&lt;ref name=Bailey-GayPolitics-1998&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bailey|first1=Robert W.|title=Gay Politics, Urban Politics: Identity and Economics in the Urban Setting|date=1998|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-231-09662-1|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/gay-politics-urban-politics-identity-and-economics-in-the-urban-setting/oclc/52288993/viewport|accessdate=2 July 2016|oclc=39189872}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|237}} claimed there was no active effort to respond to the spread of the disease from the Health Commissioner until Sencer stepped down and Joseph took over: "he [Sencer] wasn't, in my opinion, the kind of health commissioner that we needed in the epidemic.

Thus the government's role during the AIDS crisis was seen as being more reactive than proactive, as described by members of the medical community such as Dr. Jo Ivey Boufford, who saw that very few programs were being funded for AIDS prevention. When Dr. Boufford became president of the NYC Health and Hospitals Commission in 1985, five years after the AIDS crisis had hit New York City, her first task was to develop a primary care strategy for AIDS patients. Dr. Boufford's team encountered several problems: since governmental involvement had been delayed, doctors had to deal with terminally ill patients; the disease was still being viewed as a homosexual disease, so prevention and advertising was very limited; perhaps most importantly, funds were being used reactively instead of proactively. In a sense, Dr. Boufford reported, the HIV crisis transformed the care system, including housing, support, primary care, and coordinated care management, more than any previous medical crisis. She also explained that the hospitals had to become more like a family doctor rather than an ambulatory care system. When it came to funding, the [[NYC Health + Hospitals|New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC)]] also had to make sure that the investments coming in were strengthening the system, especially because, as Dr. Boufford explained, "we tend to fund acute care hospitals in the United States, and we're very hospital-oriented, very specialty-oriented country in terms of our investments&amp;nbsp;... we're over invested in acute healthcare."&lt;ref name=LGWA-KochOralHistory-Boufford-2014&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boufford|first1=Dr. Jo Ivey|last2=Lieberman|first2=Richard K.|title=Koch Scholars interview: Dr. Jo Ivey Boufford 12-18-2014|date=18 December 2014|publisher=[[LaGuardia Community College]]/[[City University of New York|CUNY]]: [[La Guardia and Wagner Archives]], Edward I.

The HHC began employee training programs, and created videos, discussions guides and booklets. The HHC also established protective guidelines for employees.&lt;ref name=KochPapers-Vol1-AIDS-2007 /&gt;

The [[New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene|NYC Department of Health (DOH)]] began outreach efforts including production of 5,000 HTLV-III flyers that were printed and distributed to community organizations.In May 1985, the AIDS Education Unit hired a Health Educator and Graphic Design Consultant. HTLV-III AIDS wallet cards and fact sheets began to be produced and distributed.&lt;ref name=KochPapers-Vol1-AIDS-2007 /&gt; Also, in May 1985 the New York State Association of Substance Abuse Agencies held a meeting to discuss the implementation of seminars and conferences. A planning committee was formed on June 30, 1985 and Commissioner Sencer led a meeting with substance abuse experts at the DOH on how best to educate the substance abuse community about the risk of acquiring AIDS.&lt;ref name=KochPapers-Vol1-AIDS-2007 /&gt;

On June 13, 1985, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development provided two buildings appropriate for persons with AIDS in East Harlem and in Brooklyn. These locations were chosen due to the numbers of AIDS patients located  in the Bellevue and Kings Hospitals. This plan cost US$1 million.&lt;ref name=KochPapers-Vol1-AIDS-2007 /&gt;

===Public Schools and Children with AIDS===
In 1985, Judge Harold Hyman held a hearing on examining children for the virus. In a comment made to Dr. Louis Cooper, the chief pediatrician of St. Luke’s-Roosevelt Hospital at the time, the purpose of the hearing was to make sense of his judgement after two Queens school districts sued the City to hold children with HIV/AIDS from attending school regularly. His questions from the trial is whether children with AIDS are considered handicapped, and should their status become known to their teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Fried, Joseph P. (1985) “Judge ‘Trying To Learn’ In School AIDS Dispute.” New York Times. September 30, 1985 Issue. New York. https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/30/nyregion/judge-trying-to-learn-in-school-aids-dispute.html&lt;/ref&gt; When Judge Hyman made his decision, he approved the policy that CWA were not to be excluded from attending school, while scrutinizing the policy as a “secret.” He further criticized the medical field as professionally irresponsible for causing mass hysteria. Frederick A.O Schwarz, Jr., whom was the City Corporation Counsel, defended the City’s policymakers because they “acted in a way that reflected the pressure of time.” &lt;ref name=KochPapers-Vol1-AIDS-2007 /&gt;{{rp|58–59}} As for the determination of children having handicapped status, the Assistant Attorney General Charles J. Cooper issued a memorandum on June 20, 1986 on AIDS-patient discrimination. Section 504 of The Rehabilitation Act of 1974 was interpreted by the Department of Justice that discrimination was prohibited on those who were disabled by the disease, giving them handicapped status. The City’s Assistant Corporation Counsel issued a memorandum to Schwarz in July 1976 that the act did not protect asymptomatic AIDS patients and those who were AIDS-related complex. The memorandum also further asserted that the basis of discrimination made by those who feared contagious transmission was not protected under law.&lt;ref name=KochPapers-Vol1-AIDS-2007 /&gt;{{rp|80–81}}

=== Needle Exchange Program ===
In 1985, Dr. [[David Sencer]], New York City’s health commissioner first proposed the distribution of clean needles to drug users in order to prevent the spread of AIDS, but city officials and local law enforcement opposition hindered this plan. Evidence from effective needle exchange programs in European cities caused a shift in public opinion, and in 1988, New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Stephen C. Joseph, was permitted to initiate the needle exchange program as a clinical trial involving a limited group of drug users access to clean needles and syringes.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson, Warwick (November 1991). ”The New York Needle Trial: The Politics of Public Health in the Age of AIDS.” American Journal of Public Health. 81(11): 1506-1511. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1405677/pdf/amjph00211-0144.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

When the program started, New York City police commissioner Ben Ward sought to avert police harassment of drug users making Dr. Joseph’s intent of AIDS prevention known to police precincts.&lt;ref name="Joseph_bio"&gt;Joseph, Stephen C. (1992). Dragon within the Gates: The Once and Future AIDS Epidemic. New York: Carrol &amp; Graf. p.196.&lt;/ref&gt; Development of these programs were slowed by opposition from a range of government officials and communities and Commissioner Ward later suggested the possibility of unethical practices that recalled the Tuskegee syphilis experiment.&lt;ref name="Bayer"&gt;Bayer, Ronald (1991). "Prevention through Education." Private Acts, Social Consequences: AIDS and the Politics of Public Health. New Brunswick: Rutgers UP. p. 222-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Joseph credited activists such as [[Yolanda Serrano]], the head of the Association for Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) for calling attention to how the problem of addiction was far less dire than the overwhelming number of deaths from the rapidly spreading AIDS epidemic.&lt;ref name="LGWA-KochOralHistory-Joseph-2015" /&gt;{{rp|6}} However, at the start of Mayor [[David Dinkins]] administration in 1990, the only legal needle exchange program was shut down.&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; Following new studies that demonstrated reduction in HIV infection rates, new programs restarted in New York City in 1992.&lt;ref name="Navarro"&gt;Navarro, Mireya (18 February 1993). “New York needle exchanges called surprisingly effective.” New York Times.

== Comparison with San Francisco ==
No two cities were more prominent in the battle against AIDS in the 1980s than New York and San Francisco. The majority of people who had AIDS came from these two cities. Some gay activists like Richard Dunne from New York's Gay Men's Health Crisis believed comparisons between the two cities were of limited value because their governments handled the matter very differently, but argued nonetheless that San Francisco managed the matter more effectively.&lt;ref name=LGWA-GMHC-Koch-Letter-1987&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunne|first1=Richard D.|last2=[[Gay Men's Health Crisis|Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC)]]|title=Response to July 1 letter from Edward I.

Joseph, who succeeded Sencer as the commissioner, agreed that these two cities should not be compared because of the great difference the population of the two cities and that New York saw a great number of cases due to intravenous drug use.&lt;ref name=LGWA-NYSDH-Joseph-Memo-1987&gt;{{cite book|last1=Joseph|first1=Dr. Stephen C.|last2=City of New York Commissioner of Health, [[New York State Department of Health]]|title=Response to Richard Dunne's July 9 letter|date=4 August 1987|publisher=[[LaGuardia Community College]]/[[City University of New York|CUNY]]: [[La Guardia and Wagner Archives]], Edward I.

Early in the crisis, many critics in New York looked to San Francisco because San Francisco was the only other major city that confronted multiple deaths from AIDS. The Center of Disease Control (CDC) reported the first case of AIDS in the country in 1980, Ken Horne, a San Francisco resident.&lt;ref name=KQED-SF-LGBT-Timeline&gt;{{cite news|title=San Francisco LGBT Historical Timeline|url=http://www.kqed.org/topics/history/heritage/lgbt/timeline.jsp|accessdate=2 July 2016|work=[[KQED]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021126032538/http://www.kqed.org/topics/history/heritage/lgbt/timeline.jsp|archivedate=26 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 13, 1985, Victor Botnick reported 932 cases of AIDS in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=KochPapers-Vol1-AIDS-2007 /&gt;{{rp|15–23}} By September 1987, the number had increased to 3,785.&lt;ref name=Joseph-AIDSTaleof2Cities-1987&gt;{{cite book|last1=Joseph|first1=Dr. Stephen C.|last2=New York City Department of Health|title=AIDS: A Tale of Two Cities: A Report to the Mayor|date=19 October 1987|publisher=[[LaGuardia Community College]]/[[City University of New York|CUNY]]: [[La Guardia and Wagner Archives]], Edward I. Koch Collection, Koch Collection Subject Files|location=New York, NY|format=Memorandum|volume=AIDS, subject files series 80049-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Gay Disease" ===
AIDS was initially viewed as a "Gay Man's Disease" because of the high incidence of gay men getting the disease. As a result, many in New York looked at San Francisco as a point of comparison because since the late 1960s, San Francisco had been the premier gay community in the country. The gay connection, however, did not mean that the two cities were completely similar. The New York gay community believed that San Francisco was educating the gay community better and providing more resources to combat the disease. Many then became more vocal about wanting New York to adopt some of the same programs and resources as San Francisco.

=== New York City Government responds ===
As the public debate continued about what the two cities were doing, many government and community leaders in New York such as Councilwoman Carol Greitzer claimed that San Francisco had been spending more money on AIDS patients, particularly for counseling and housing.&lt;ref name=WNYC-SanFranciscoAIDS-1985&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosa, Jr.|first1=F.|last2=Koch|first2=Edward I.|url=|title=San Francisco model AIDS|website=WNYC|location=New York, NY|format=Video|date=8 March 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greitzer wanted Mayor Koch to create a committee that would work on trying to establish a hospice for people with AIDS. Primarily focusing on patient care after being in the hospital, Greitzer noted that the reason why things were being run differently in San Francisco were because "there's a lot more counseling in San Francisco on a one-to-one basis. There's a lot more education not only of the gay community, but I think of the general public [as well]."&lt;ref name=WNYC-SanFranciscoAIDS-1985 /&gt; There were others though who offered different opinions about how New York City operated. Richard Dunne believed that "the comparisons between the respective performances of the city government of New York and San Francisco are of limited value."&lt;ref name=LGWA-NYSDH-Dunne-Memo-1987&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunne|first1=Richard D.|title=Letter From Richard D. Dunne to Ed Koch|date=9 July 1987|publisher=[[LaGuardia Community College]]/[[City University of New York|CUNY]]: [[La Guardia and Wagner Archives]], Edward I. Koch Collection, Koch Collection Subject Files|location=New York, NY|format=Memorandum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Dunne noted that the reason why it was so limited was because "San Francisco is a much smaller city, with a tradition of a strong gay political presence, a less complex epidemiology of AIDS, an excess of hospital beds and a budget surplus at the beginning of the AIDS  epidemic."&lt;ref name=LGWA-NYSDH-Dunne-Memo-1987 /&gt; Factors like the ones Dunne states help build the argument that San Francisco was able to act quickly and efficiently because "San Francisco's experience is unique and cannot, perhaps should not, be attempted in other settings."&lt;ref name=LGWA-NYSDH-Dunne-Memo-1987 /&gt;

=== Demographic differences ===
Although San Francisco and New York were the two major cities combating AIDS, the people getting the virus were very different. A Department of Health Report given to Mayor Koch in October 1987 stated that New York had 11,513 AIDS cases and San Francisco had 3,775.&lt;ref name=Joseph-AIDSTaleof2Cities-1987 /&gt; Although San Francisco and New York both had large gay communities, the report noted that "San Francisco's AIDS crisis&amp;nbsp;... manifested primarily among the gay, white middle class population, while New York's&amp;nbsp;... increasingly [came] from intravenous drug users in minority communities."&lt;ref name=Joseph-AIDSTaleof2Cities-1987 /&gt; Specifically, 27% (2,727 of the 10,089 male cases) of the reported cases of AIDS in New York were from IV drug users, compared to the less than 1% that San Francisco had.&lt;ref name=Joseph-AIDSTaleof2Cities-1987 /&gt;&gt; While the numbers do show that the cases of AIDS from gay men who had sex with other men in San Francisco was higher than New York's (85% in SF compared to 65% in NYC), the numbers show that the AIDS cases that came from IV drug use were also a big problem amongst women in New York.&lt;ref name=Joseph-AIDSTaleof2Cities-1987 /&gt; Out of the 221 AIDS cases listed in the report, 60% (725) of the AIDS cases for women in New York came as a result of IV drug use, compared to the 41% (12 of the 29 female cases) reported in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=Joseph-AIDSTaleof2Cities-1987 /&gt; In addition, in a letter from Lee Jones, a mayoral aide, to Mayor Koch about the [[demographics]] of AIDS cases, Jones stated that "44.9% of our caseload is white; 30.7 is black; 23.8 is Hispanic."&lt;ref name=LGWA-NYSDH-Jones-Memo-1987&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Lee|title=AIDS In New York City|date=12 July 1987|publisher=[[LaGuardia Community College]]/[[City University of New York|CUNY]]: [[La Guardia and Wagner Archives]], Edward I. Koch Collection, Koch Collection Subject Files|location=New York, NY|format=Memorandum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones also claimed that "In 1982, the average number of new AIDS cases reported in New York was 31 cases. [However] in the first five months of 1987, the average number of new cases reported was 302 cases per month."&lt;ref name=LGWA-NYSDH-Jones-Memo-1987 /&gt;

=== New York government programs ===
Among all the debate about what the city should be doing, New York City Commissioner of Health  David Sencer talked about who was getting the disease at the time and how that affected the way New York had handled it. Sencer stated that because AIDS had been a disease that, up to that point, had affected young individuals, the city did not have the system necessary to take care of them. Instead its system had been geared towards taking care of the elderly, who had nursing homes and home health care ready for them.&lt;ref name=WNYC-SanFranciscoAIDS-1985 /&gt; However, as the problem grew larger, Sencer stated how "[s]uddenly we have a group of people with a chronic illness that comes and goes and it's difficult to develop the right kind of home care for these people. This has [be]come confounded by the fact that there's still unfortunately a fair amount of unsaid discrimination against people with AIDS, whether they be drug abusers or gay men. And it's difficult to get them into nursing homes. It's difficult to find housing for these individuals."&lt;ref name=WNYC-SanFranciscoAIDS-1985 /&gt;

'''Henry Matthew Patrick McStay''' (born 6 March 1985) is a retired footballer from [[Lurgan]] in [[Northern Ireland]], is currently the Head Physio at [[Leeds United]].

His preferred position was right back, though towards the latter end of his career played in a more central defensive role. He is a former [[Republic of Ireland national under-21 football team|Republic of Ireland U21]] international.

==Club career==
Henry began his club career with [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] without ever breaking through in to the first team.

Henry went on loan to [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]] for a short period in search of first team football.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/h/halifax_town/3685930.stm - Halifax move for McStay], BBC Sport. Retrieved 4 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His loan move ended in November 2004 after suffering a knee injury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/h/halifax_town/3979185.stm - Injured McStay returns to Leeds], BBC Sport. Retrieved 4 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

When his contract with Leeds ended, he joined Portadown in his native Northern Ireland, turning down offers from [[Aberdeen F.C.]], [[Bohemian F.C.]] or [[Finn Harps F.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/irish/4203866.stm - Marks and McStay join Portadown], BBC Sport. Retrieved 4 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

After impressing for Portadown, Henry got the chance to move to [[Royal Antwerp FC]]. However, due to homesickness, McStay ended his contract with the Belgian club at the end of January 2008 and went in search of a new start in Britain.

In January 2008, Henry moved to [[Morecambe F.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/morecambe/7217987.stm - Shrimps bring in defender McStay], BBC Sport. Retrieved 4 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In April, he signed a new two-year contract with Morecambe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/morecambe/7360687.stm - Two-year Shrimps deal for McStay], BBC Sport. Retrieved 4 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010 Henry moved to [[Portadown F.C.|Portadown]] whom he previously played for signing a one-year contract. Due to personal commitments a move to Bradford Park Avenue arose where Henry spent just over a season before retiring due to a recurring knee injury.

==International career==
Henry played international football for Northern Ireland's Under 17s before opting for the Republic of Ireland. A strong defender who played for the Republic's Under 19s and Under 21s, he is also an expert penalty taker.

He was one of the stars as Ireland won the [[European Youth Olympic Festival]] in [[Spain]] in 2001.

Henry made his [[Republic of Ireland national under-21 football team|Republic of Ireland Under 21]] debut v [[Portugal national under-21 football team|Portugal U21]]s on 24 February 2004.

On 25 March 2005, in a [[2006 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification#Group 4|2006 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]] qualifying match against [[Israel national under-21 football team|Israel U21]], Henry conceded an own goal while trying to clear the ball in the 6th minute, deflecting the ball into the net. However, he redeemed himself by scoring a goal with a header via [[Willo Flood]]'s free-kick in the 35th minute. However, Ireland U21 lost the match 3-1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/4382759.stm - Israel U21 3-1 Rep of Ireland U21 ], BBC Sport. Retrieved 4 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physio==
After retiring he came a physio at [[Leeds United]], where he worked several years as an Assistant Physio, before becoming Head Physio in the summer of 2018 after the departure of Steve Megson.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/leeds-united-physio-price-seems-right-man-for-new-boss-bielsa-1-9280447&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He studied at the [[University of Sheffield]] before completing his degree in Physiotherapy at the [[University of Salford]], following the part-time programme which has links with the [[Professional Footballers Association]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irishnews.com/sport/footballsoccer/2018/02/21/news/when-one-door-closes-another-opens-for-leeds-united-and-henry-mcstay-1259740/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Honduras Activate''' is a health initiative created by [[Juan Orlando Hernandez]] in order to promote physical activity and a healthy life style among the Honduran population. Honduras Activate aims to reduce significantly the amount of '''non-communicable chronic diseases (NCCD)''' such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes, among others. The program has gained both domestic and international recognition, with the PAHO and WHO praising the initiative and its goals.

==Intro==
With the amount of obesity, hypertension and diabetes cases on the rise in Latin America,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.obesity.org/obesity/resources/facts-about-obesity/obesity-latin-america)&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Juan Orlando Hernandez]] decided to promote physical activity in Honduras through new parks and recreational spaces nationwide. The parks are equipped with Soccer fields, Basketball courts, Running tracks and Exercise Machines.

==Honduras Activate Events==
In commemoration of [[World Health Day]], President Hernandez launched a new phase for the Honduras Activate program that week. On Sunday April the 12th Hernandez and thousands of Honduras participated in 21.5&amp;nbsp;km hike in [[El Tigre (Honduras)]] Island.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elheraldo.hn/pais/830305-214/gobierno-lanza-campa%C3%B1a-honduras-act%C3%ADvate&lt;/ref&gt;  Honduras Activate events are now celebrated every Sunday in different National parks of the country. The event is marked by different activities to choose from.  Activities include Hiking, Biking and different distance Marathons.

The Honduras, Activate events have not only become popular for its health component, but its positive effect on domestic tourism. Every Sunday thousands of participants from all over the country participate in these events, which gives them the opportunity to visit different cities and national parks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latribuna.hn/2015/08/16/honduras-activate-un-impulso-al-turismo-interno/&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Recognition==
The [[WHO]] and [[PAHO]] have been very supportive of the Honduras Activate Program. Both organizations have shown interest to implement this program in other countries which also suffer from non-communicable chronic diseases.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latribuna.hn/2015/08/13/honduras-activate-esta-calando-en-la-consciencia-de-los-hondurenos-ops/&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Hernandez was invited to be the Keynote speaker at a joint WHO/PAHO conference in Washington DC in September 2015, where he disclosed the goals and benefits of the program. Due to the success of the program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gobernabilidad.gob.hn/index.php/2014-03-03-12-51-37/item/1306-presidente-hernandez-expone-sobre-vida-mejor-y-honduras-activate-ante-la-oms-y-ops |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302050154/http://www.gobernabilidad.gob.hn/index.php/2014-03-03-12-51-37/item/1306-presidente-hernandez-expone-sobre-vida-mejor-y-honduras-activate-ante-la-oms-y-ops |archivedate=2016-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; both organizations named Hernandez “Health Champion 2015” since he was the first Latin American president to promote these types of activity.&lt;ref&gt;http://hondurasactivate.com/Quienes-Somos&lt;/ref&gt;

==Highlights==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2034">'''In situ''' or '''direct dosing water treatment''' involves mixing and dosing chemical reagents directly into the affected water body for the treatment of a number of issues, instead of pumping water for treatment through a water treatment plant. 

== Applications ==
Applications of ''[[in situ]]'' water treatment include [[acid mine drainage]] (AMD) treatment, [[turbidity]] control, algal control, nutrient pollution control, metal control, disinfection, chlorination, cyanide destruction, pH control, salinity control and lowering dissolved metals. 

''In situ'' water treatment is commonly used in the mining industry for a number of applications including the treatment of acid mine drainage and [[turbidity]]. ''In situ'' treatment of turbidity is often used for controlling turbidity in stormwater collection ponds at coal mine sites and coal loading facilities especially in Australia and Indonesia.

Some municipalities with numerous small water storage reservoirs spread out over a geographical location use ''in situ'' treatment for the control of turbidity. Although rare chlorine has been dosed directly into water bodies for the purpose of disinfection.

== Technologies ==
There are a number of technologies available for the ''in situ'' water treatment. Reagent can be mixed into a slurry in a vertical mixing tank, or similar, and dosed directly into the water body (e.g. a tailings storage facility (TSF) or pond) via a pipeline. Some systems mix the reagent in a tank and spray it into the water body using a spray cannon.  Other technologies mix and dose into the water body using a mobile water based floating system.  

The technology must be selected carefully based on the application and the reagent selected. For example for the treatment of turbidity the flocculant must be evenly dispensed over the surface of the water body to allow it to settle through creating flocs.

As per the treaty, the two nations established the commission to work for the common interests and sharing of water resources, irrigation, floods and cyclones control. The studies and reports of the commission contributed directly to the efforts of both nations to resolve the dispute over the [[Sharing of Ganges Waters]], facilitating bilateral agreements in 1975, 1978 and finally in 1996.&lt;ref name=ganges&gt;{{cite book |last=Haq |first=Enamul |year=2012 |chapter=Ganges Water Sharing |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Ganges_Water_Sharing |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Longitudinal Study of Young People in England''' (LSYPE), also known as "Next Steps", is a large-scale panel study collecting information about young people in [[England]] aged 13 to 14 in 2004.

==History==
The study combines data from a wide range of different sources such as the National Pupil Database (NPD) or the 2001 Census. So far, six waves of the study have been conducted, the sixth edition being released in August 2009. The first four waves of the study were undertaken for the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] (DCSF) by a consortium of contractors including [[BMRB Social Research]], [[GfK NOP]] and [[Ipsos MORI]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esds.ac.uk/findingData/snDescription.asp?sn=5545&amp;amp;key=/&amp;amp;flag=true Economic and Social Data Service (ESDS), LSYPE catalogue record entry], retrieved 22 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the study is to identify the key issues that influence the lives of young people in England in hindsight to their progress in the transition from compulsory education to the entry in the labour market or other outcomes. The findings are meant to evaluate the success of certain policies as well as providing help with further policy development.

Amongst the main topics covered by the study are household and [[demographic]] information, languages spoken in the home, attitudes towards school and involvement in education, year 10 subject choices, special educational needs, parental expectations and aspirations, family activities, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esds.ac.uk/longitudinal/access/lsype/L5545.asp ESDS Longitudinal, LSYPE webpages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127060720/http://www.esds.ac.uk/longitudinal/access/lsype/L5545.asp |date=27 January 2010 }}, retrieved 22 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology and scope==
The sample of the first wave consisted of about 21,000 young people aged 13 to 14 who were in Year 9 in February 2004. Fieldwork was carried out in the form of face-to-face interviews, supplemented by linkage to administrative records. Interviews were conducted with the young person as well as the main parent or carer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/doc/5545%5Cmrdoc%5Cpdf%5C5545userguide_all_waves.pdf NatCen LSYPE Userguide to the dataset, waves 1-4], retrieved 22 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Survey results==
Recently published research includes, amongst others,  the paper "Minority Ethnic Pupils in the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England" which can be downloaded [http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/research/programmeofresearch/projectinformation.cfm?projectId=14850&amp;type=5&amp;resultspage=1 here].

'''Lucinactant''' (trade name '''Surfaxin''') is a liquid medication used to treat [[infant respiratory distress syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discoverylabs.com/surfaxin.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420135625/http://www.discoverylabs.com/surfaxin.html |date=April 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[pulmonary surfactant]] for infants who lack enough natural surfactant in their lungs. Whereas earlier medicines of the class, such as [[beractant]], [[calfactant]], and poractant, are derived from animals, lucinactant is [[organic synthesis|synthetic]]. It was approved for use in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on March 6, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm294984.htm |title=FDA approves Surfaxin to prevent breathing disorder in premature infants |publisher=Fda.gov |date=2012-03-06 |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical uses==
Lucinactant is indicated to improve lung function and reduce duration and risk of [[mechanical ventilation]] in children. It can be used up to two years of age and is specified for children who are diagnosed with acute [[respiratory failure]] following exposure to a pathogen such as [[Human respiratory syncytial virus|RSV]] or [[influenza]], including [[H1N1]].&lt;ref name="POPG, a Key Component of Discovery Labs' KL4 Surfactant, Identified as a Novel Anti-Viral Therapeutic Approach"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/globenewswire/182115.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122205312/http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/globenewswire/182115.htm |archivedate=January 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bronchopulmonary segmental lavage with Surfaxin (KL(4)-surfactant) for acute respiratory distress syndrome."&gt;{{Cite journal

==Chemistry==
Lucinactant contains the peptide [[sinapultide]] (KL4 acetate), [[dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine]] (DPPC), [[1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol]] (POPG, as the sodium salt&lt;!-- pubchem 5283509 --&gt;), and [[palmitic acid]].

==History==
The scientific groundwork for lucinactant was laid in the laboratory of Charles Cochrane at The [[Scripps Research Institute]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scripps.edu/news/press/20120306cochrane.html |title=Scripps Research Discoveries Lead to Newly Approved Drug for Infant Respiratory Distress Syndrome |publisher=Scripps.edu |date=2012-03-06 |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drug was then developed by Discovery Laboratories of [[Warrington Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Warrington, PA]]. The path through the approval process was unusually long, reflecting in part challenges in the manufacturing process that needed to be addressed before approval was granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmacychoice.com/news/article.cfm?Article_ID=854519 |title=Pharmaceutical News - Discovery Labs Turns Focus To Surfaxin Market Strategy - October 20, 2012 |publisher=Pharmacy Choice |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
Lucinactant is listed as an [[orphan drug|Orphan Drug Product]] by the US Food and Drug Administration for several conditions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://google2.fda.gov/search?q=cache:LCsiKMwG2v0J:www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dailys/00/mar00/030100/lst0094.pdf+surfaxin&amp;client=FDAgov&amp;site=FDAgov&amp;lr=&amp;proxystylesheet=FDAgov&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;access=p&amp;oe=UTF-8 |title=List Of Orphan Products Designations And Approvals |publisher=Google2.fda.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nelm.nhs.uk/en/NeLM-Area/News/485098/485446/485460/ |title=Page expired |publisher=Nelm.nhs.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinical trials in Latin America were criticized for protocol based in potentially unethical principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Charatan|first=Fred|title=Surfactant trial in Latin American infants criticised|journal=BMJ|date=10 March 2001|volume=322|series=7286|page=575|pmc=1119782|pmid=11238147|doi=10.1136/bmj.322.7286.575/b}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A placebo was used and considered ethical by design since infants born in Latin America usually do not have access to life saving treatment. The intent of Discovery Labs was always to market Surfaxin in the United States, implying burdens on the Latin American children that outweighed the benefits.

'''Mandai Crematorium and Columbarium''' is a [[crematorium]] and [[columbarium]] complex located at [[Mandai]], [[Singapore]]. The complex is operated by the [[Government of Singapore]] under the [[National Environment Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.gov.sg/public-health/care-for-the-dead/government-managed-columbaria|title=Government-Managed Columbaria|work=[[National Environment Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of two government crematoria in Singapore, the other being the [[Choa Chu Kang Columbarium]].

Mandai Crematorium and Columbarium is located not far from [[Yishun|Yishun New Town]].

This complex is one of the final resting places for many Singaporeans because of the new technology and limited spaces to host cemeteries for the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.gov.sg/public-health/care-for-the-dead/other-death-related-matters/burial-cremation-ash-storage|title=Burial, Cremation &amp; Ash Storage|work=National Environment Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
With Mount Vernon Crematorium, the only government crematorium reaching its maximum capacity in the late 1970s, a need for a second crematorium arose. The Government chose a plot of land at Mandai to build Singapore's second crematorium. Completed in 1982, it consists of 4 big cremators and 4 small cremators, and 1200 niches. Shortly after its opening, it was designated to cremate exhumed remains from closed down cemeteries in Singapore.

In 2000, the government decided that all cremation services are to be consolidated at Mandai. So, a new extension was built just south of the original complex. Completed in mid 2004, this complex comprises four service halls, four viewing halls, 12 cremators and one waiting hall, replacing the Mount Vernon Crematorium, which closed down on the same day the new complex opened. The columbarium was also expanded to include remains displaced from the closure of Mount Vernon Crematorium as well.

To meet the growing demand of the island's population, the Government decided to expand the crematorium further. Slated to be completed in 3Q 2019, it will have six service halls, six viewing halls, three waiting halls and 18 cremators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/mandai-crematorium-to-expand-to-meet-demand|title=Mandai Crematorium to expand to meet demand|publisher=The Straits Times|date=March 23, 2015|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Evelyn Lentaigne''' (born 6 May 1920) was a medical artist and Red Cross [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]] nurse at the [[Queen Victoria Hospital]], England, during the Second World War. She is known for the drawings she made there of the surgical procedures of New Zealand plastic surgeon [[Archibald McIndoe]] who was working on injured servicemen. Around 300 of her drawings are held by the [[East Grinstead Museum]] where they form the Mollie Lentaigne Collection.

==Early life and family==
Lentaigne was born on 6 May 1920 to Lt. Col. [[Edward Charles Lentaigne]] [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] and Cecilia Mary Lentaigne in [[Simla]], [[British India]].&lt;ref name=":Broadhurst" /&gt; Her brother, second lieutenant John Wilfred O'Neill Lentaigne [[Military Cross|MC]] of the [[Rifle Brigade]], died in 1942 at [[Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]]. In 1955, she married Timothy Ingram Lock.&lt;ref name=":Burkes"&gt;"Lentaigne" in {{Citation|title=Burke's Irish Family Records|url=|publication-date=|page=717|publication-place=|publisher=Burke's Peerage|isbn=|oclc=|ol=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had four sons and two daughters.&lt;ref name=":Broadhurst"&gt;Beamish, David. (2004) [http://www.broadhurst-family.co.uk/FamilyTree/Source%20Data/Others/Lock%20family%203.04.pdf ''The Lock family of Dorchester, Dorset''.] Version 3.04. London: David Beamish. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lentaigne came from a family with several distinguished medical ancestors. These include her grandfather, Sir [[John Vincent Lentaigne]] (1855–1915), who was an Irish surgeon and president of the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] between 1908 and 1910.&lt;ref name=":RCSI"&gt;[http://www.rcsi.ie/files/NOCA/20150413095216_RCSI%20Presidents%20Feb%202015.pdf RCSI Presidents since its foundation in 1784.] Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, 2015. Retrieved 7 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Sir John was himself the grandson of the surgeon [[Benjamin Lentaigne]] who was born in France in 1773, but, as a Royalist and firm supporter of  [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]], was forced to escape to England at the age of nineteen.&lt;ref name=fitz&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofdublinc00fitz#page/180/|title=History of the Dublin Catholic Cemeteries|last=Fitzpatrick|first=William John|date=1900|publisher=Dublin|page=180|others=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to earn a medical qualification in England and join the British Army. He was posted to the Dublin barracks in 1775, and was involved in the treatment of [[Wolfe Tone]], the leader of the [[1798 Irish Rebellion]], during his imprisonment and the final days of his life.&lt;ref name=fitz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=O'Donnell|first=P.|date=January 1997|title=Wolfe Tone's death: suicide or assassination?|journal=Irish Journal of Medical Science|volume=166|issue=1|pages=57–59|issn=0021-1265|pmid=9057437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
During the Second World War, Lentaigne worked as a Red Cross [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]] nurse at the [[Queen Victoria Hospital]], [[East Grinstead]], West Sussex, where her duties included drawing the experimental operations of Archibald McIndoe and his fellow surgeons. She needed to work quickly in the operating theatre and so used pencil but subsequently added ink and colour to some of her work.&lt;ref name=":WestSussex"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.westsussex.gov.uk/news/grant-to-preserve-unique-hospital-archive/|title=Grant to preserve unique hospital archive|website=West Sussex County Council|language=en|access-date=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":EastGrinsteadMuseum"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eastgrinsteadmuseum.org.uk/our-collections/mollie-lentaigne-collections/|title=Discover the Mollie Lentaigne Collection|publisher=East Grinstead Museum|access-date=2 April 2018}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Her drawings have uncovered material on the [[Guinea Pig Club]], a club formed of Archibald McIndoe's surgical patients, many of whom were severely burned [[Royal Air Force]] pilots and aircrew.&lt;ref name=":ITVNews"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/meridian/update/2013-11-14/exclusive-the-woman-who-drew-the-guinea-pig-club/|title=Exclusive: The woman who drew the Guinea Pig Club|work=ITV News|date=14 November 2013|access-date=2 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Around 300 of Lentaigne's drawings have been preserved at the East Grinstead Museum, as the Mollie Lentaigne Collection.&lt;ref name=":EastGrinsteadMuseum"/&gt; After the surviving Guinea Pig Club members used social media to search for Lentaigne and found her living in [[Zimbabwe]], she returned to East Grinstead in 2013 to be reunited with her work.&lt;ref name=":ITVNews"/&gt;

In 2015, the Queen Victoria Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and the [[West Sussex Record Office]] were awarded a £72,952 [[Wellcome Trust]] grant for the digitisation of over 600 Guinea Pig patient files and the accompanying drawings by Mollie Lentaigne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healtharchives.co.uk/tag/archibald-mcindoe/ The Queen Victoria Hospital Archive Project.] Health Archives and Records Group, 21 March 2018. Retrieved 7 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Alexander Baldwin of the [[University of Birmingham]] won the [[Norah Schuster Prize]] of the [[Royal Society of Medicine]]'s [[History of Medicine Society]] for an essay on the medical drawings of Mollie Lentaigne.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rsm.ac.uk/events/events-listing/2017-2018/sections/history-of-medicine-society/hsk04-norah-schuster-prize-presentations-and-charles-dickens-and-medicine.aspx Norah Schuster prize presentations and Charles Dickens and medicine.] Royal Society of Medicine.

'''Pain management during childbirth''' is the [[medical case management|treatment]] or [[Preventive healthcare|prevention]] of [[pain]] that a woman may experience during labor and [[childbirth|delivery]]. The amount of pain a woman feels during labor depends partly on the size and position of her baby, the size of her [[pelvis]], her [[emotion]]s, the strength of the [[Uterine contraction|contractions]], and her outlook.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;  Tension increases pain during labor.&lt;ref name=Smit2012/&gt; Virtually all women worry about how they will [[cope]] with the pain of labor and delivery. Childbirth is different for each woman and predicting the amount of pain experienced during birth and delivery can not be certain.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

Some women do fine with "natural methods"&lt;!--term used in the source--&gt; of [[pain relief]] alone. Many women blend "natural methods"&lt;!--term used in the source--&gt; with [[medication]]s and medical interventions that relieve pain. Building a positive outlook on childbirth and managing [[fear]] may also help some women cope with the pain. Labor pain is not like pain due to illness or injury. Instead, it is caused by contractions of the uterus that are pushing the baby down and out of the birth canal. In other words, labor pain has a purpose.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

==Preparation==

Preparation for childbirth can effect the amount of pain experienced during childbirth. It is possible to take a childbirth [[Course (education)|class]], consult with those managing the pregnancy, and writing down questions can assist in getting the information that a woman needs to help manage pain. Simple interaction with friends and family can alleviate concerns.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

==Non-pharmacological==

Many methods help women to relax and make pain more manageable. These can be:

==Water and childbirth==
{{Main|Water birth}}

According to the American [[Office of Women's Health]], laboring in a tub of warm water, also called hydrotherapy, helps women feel physically supported, and keeps them warm and relaxed. It is also easier for laboring women to move and find comfortable positions in the water. In waterbirthing, a woman remains in the water for delivery. The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] has expressed concerns about delivering in water because of a lack of studies showing its safety and because of the rare but reported chance of complications.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

==Medical and pharmaceutical methods of pain control==

[[Physician]]s, [[Nurse Practitioner]]s, [[Physician Assistant]]s, [[Nurses]] and [[Midwives]] will typically ask the woman in labor if there is a  need of pain relief.  Many pain relief options work well when given by a trained and experienced clinician. Clinicians also can use different methods for pain relief at different [[stages of labor]]. Still, not all options are available at every [[hospital]] and [[birthing center]]. Depending on the health history of the mother, the presence of allergies or other concerns, some choices will work better than others.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

There are many methods of relieving pain used for labor. Rare and unpredictable, serious complications sometimes occur. Also, most medicines used to manage pain during labor pass freely into the placenta to the baby. Asking questions about the procedures and medications which may affect the baby are valid questions.&lt;ref name=NIH2017&gt;{{cite web|title=Pregnancy Labor and Birth|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/childbirth-and-beyond/labor-and-birth|publisher = Office on Women’s Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=15 July 2017|date=1 February 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opioids=== 
These are also called [[narcotics]] and are medicines given through an IV or by injection into a muscle. Sometimes, opioids also are given with an epidural or a spinal block. Opioids can make the pain bearable, and don't affect the ability to push. Opioids don't get rid of all the pain. They
* are short-acting.
* cause drowsiness.
* cause nausea and vomiting.
* can cause itchiness.
* cannot be given right before delivery because they may slow the baby's breathing and heart rate at birth.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

===Epidural and spinal blocks=== 
{{See|Epidural administration}}
{{See|Spinal anaesthesia}}
[[File:Spinal anaesthesia.jpg|alt=A man injects a clear liquid through a tube into the patient's spine|thumb|An anesthetic medication is injected into the spine.]]
An epidural is a procedure that involves placing a tube ([[catheter]]) into the lower back, into a small space below the [[spinal cord]]. Small doses of medicine can be given through the tube as needed throughout labor. With a spinal block, a small dose of medicine is given as a shot into the spinal fluid in the lower back. Spinal blocks usually are given only once during labor. Epidural and spinal blocks allow most women to be awake and alert with very little pain during labor and childbirth. With an epidural, pain relief starts 10 to 20 minutes after the medicine has been given. The degree of numbness felt can be adjusted. With spinal block, good pain relief starts right away, but it only lasts 1 to 2 hours.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

Although movement is possible, walking may not be if the medication affects motor function. An epidural can lower [[blood pressure]], which can [[bradycardia|slow your baby's heartbeat]]. Fluids given through IV are given to lower this risk. Fluids can cause shivering. But women in labor often shiver with or without an epidural. If the covering of the spinal cord is punctured by the catheter, a bad headache may develop. Treatment can help the headache. An epidural can cause a backache that can occur for a few days after labor. An epidural can prolong the first and second stages of labor. If given late in labor or if too much medicine is used, it might be hard to push when the time comes. An epidural increases risk of [[assisted vaginal delivery]].&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

===Pudendal block===
{{See|Pudendal anesthesia}}
In this procedure a doctor injects numbing medicine into the [[vagina]] and the nearby [[pudendal nerve]]. This nerve carries sensation to the lower part of the vagina and [[vulva]]. This method of pain control is only used late in labor, usually right before the baby's head comes out. With a pudendal block, there is some pain relief but the laboring woman remains awake, alert, and able to push the baby out. The baby is not affected by this medicine and it has very few disadvantages.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maclean2011&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Shaw|editor1-first=Robert| last1 = Maclean | first1= Allan|last2=Reid|first2=Wendy | title = Gynaecology | chapter=40|publisher = Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier | location = Edinburgh New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0-7020-3120-5 |pages= 599–612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inhaled analgesia===
{{See|Inhalational anaesthetic}}
[[Inhalational anaesthetic|Inhaled analgesia]] can help to manage pain. This type of pain management is effective but may have some [[side effect]]s. Some possible adverse side effects of inhaled analgesics include [[vomiting]], [[nausea]] and [[dizziness]]. [[Nitrous oxide]] is one gas used.&lt;ref name=Coch2012/&gt;

===Other treatments===

A review of the effectiveness of non-medical approaches to pain relief found that water immersion, relaxation methods, and [[acupuncture]] relieved pain.  Acupuncture was found to be associated with fewer assisted vaginal births and [[caesarean sections]].  Relaxation methods reduced the number of assisted vaginal births as well.&lt;ref name=Coch2012/&gt;

No studies demonstrate the effectiveness of [[hypnosis]], [[biofeedback]], sterile water injection, [[aromatherapy]], and [[TENS]] in reducing pain during labor and delivery.&lt;ref name=Coch2012/&gt;

==Pain management after childbirth==
Perineal pain after childbirth has immediate and long-term negative effects for women and their babies. These effects can interfere with breastfeeding and the care of the infant.&lt;ref name="MolakatallaShepherd2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Molakatalla|first1=Sujana|last2=Shepherd|first2=Emily|last3=Grivell|first3=Rosalie M|last4=Molakatalla|first4=Sujana|title=Aspirin (single dose) for perineal pain in the early postpartum period|year=2017|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD012129.pub2 | pmid= 28181214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pain from injection sites and possible [[episiotomy]] is managed by the frequent assessment of the report of pain from the mother. Pain can come from possible lacerations, incisions, uterine contractions and sore nipples. Appropriate medications are usually administered.{{sfn | Henry | page = 122}} Routine episiotomies have not been found to reduce the level of pain after the birth.&lt;ref name="JiangQian2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Hong|last2=Qian|first2=Xu|last3=Carroli|first3=Guillermo|last4=Garner|first4=Paul|last5=Jiang|first5=Hong|title=Selective versus routine use of episiotomy for vaginal birth|year=2017|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000081.pub3 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD000081.pub3/abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Geraet beim Optiker.jpg|thumb|right|A phoropter can measure refractive error to determine an individual's spectacle lens prescription during an eye examination.]]
[[File:Phoropter at Rodman &amp; Engelstein office 2.jpg|thumb|right|Side of a phoropter that faces the patient]]

'''Phoropter''' is a common name for an ophthalmic testing device, also called a refractor. It is commonly used by [[eye care professional]]s during an [[eye examination]], and contains different lenses used for refraction of the eye during sight testing, to measure an individual's [[refractive error]] and determine his or her [[eyeglass prescription]].&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;Dictionary.com, [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/phoropter Definition of "phoropter"], American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary. Retrieved 10-10-10.&lt;/ref&gt; It also is used to measure the patients' [[Heterophoria|phorias]] and [[duction]]s, which are characteristics of [[binocularity]].

Typically, the patient sits behind the phoropter, and looks through it at an [[eye chart]] placed at optical infinity (20 feet or 6 metres), then at near (16&amp;nbsp;inches or 40 centimetres) for individuals needing reading glasses.  The eye care professional then changes [[lens (optics)|lenses]] and other settings, while asking the patient for subjective feedback on which settings gave the best [[visual perception|vision]]. Sometimes the habitual glasses Rx or an [[automated refractor]] is used to provide initial settings for the phoropter, and sometimes a [[retinoscope]] is used through the phoropter to measure the vision without the patient having to speak, which is useful for babies and people who don't speak the language of the practitioner.

Phoropters can also measure [[Heterophoria]]s (natural resting position of the eyes), [[accommodative amplitude]]s, accommodative leads/lags, accommodative posture, horizontal and vertical [[vergence]]s, and more.

[[File:AO phoropter3.JPG|thumb|left|The American Optical Ultramatic RxMaster of 1967]]The major components of the phoropter are the battery of spherical and cylindrical lenses, auxiliary devices such as Maddox rods, filtered lenses, prisms, and the JCC (Jackson Cross-Cylinder) used for astigmatism measurement. The [[prism (optics)|prismatic]] lenses are used to analyze binocular vision and treat [[Orthoptics|orthoptic]] problems.

From the measurements taken, the specialist will write an [[eyeglass prescription]] that contains at least 3 numerical specifications for each eye: sphere, cylinder, and axis, as well as [[pupillary distance]] (distance between eyes, and, rarely, prism for one or both eyes.

The lenses within a phoropter refract light in order to focus images on the patient's [[retina]]. The [[optical power]] of these lenses is measured in 0.25 [[dioptre|diopter]] increments. By changing these lenses, the examiner is able to determine the spherical power, cylindrical power, and cylindrical axis necessary to correct a person's refractive error. The presence of cylindrical power indicates the presence of [[astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]], which has an axis measured from 0 to 180 degrees away from being aligned horizontally.

Phoropters are made with either plus or minus cylinders.  Traditionally, [[ophthalmologist]]s and [[orthoptist]]s use plus cylinder phoropters and [[optometrist]]s use minus cylinder phoropters. One can mathematically convert figures obtained from either type of phoropter to the other.

== Trademark and origin of the term ==
Phoroptor is a registered trademark currently owned by Reichert Technologies, filed Apr 25, 1921 by DeZeng Standard of New Jersey, with the USPTO, serial number 71146698. The word was coined at that time for the newest version of their [[Optometer (ophthalmic instrument)|phoro-optometer]]. DeZeng was purchased in 1925 by American Optical of Massachusetts, who continued to market the product, but the term, often spelled phoropter, has become a [[genericised trademark]] for all brands of modern vision testers, especially since AO's main competitor, [[Bausch and Lomb]], stopped making their Greens' Refractor in 1970s. Reichert bought AO's refracting equipment division in 1980s, and their current version is named "Ultramatic Rx Master Phoroptor".

== History ==
[[File:1917phoroptor.JPG|thumb|right|The first phoropters. Top, the 1917 Woolf Ski-Optometer of New York City, with cylinder.; bottom, the 1917 DeZeng Phoro-Optometer model 570, Camden, NJ. The mounting arms on both devices attached at the bottom.]]The history of the phoropter, as a binocular refracting device which can also measure [[Heterophoria|phorias]], [[duction]]s, and other traits of [[binocularity]], as distinct from the monocular [[Optometer (ophthalmic instrument)|optometer]], which cannot, starts in the mid-1910s, with the introduction of the Ski-optometer by Nathan Shigon, and the Phoro-optometer by Henry DeZeng. These two inventions, as they continued to improve, were accompanied by a third device, the Greens' Refractor, which entered the market in 1934. European manufacturers were working on similar devices as well.&lt;ref name="Phoroptors 2008"&gt;"Phoroptors, Early American Instruments of Refraction, and Those Who Used Them", Gary L. Campbell O.D., 2008, Wheaton, Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shigon/Woolf/Genothalmic/Shuron/BRU ===
In 1909, Nathan Shigon of New York City invented&lt;ref&gt;US Patent 979,578 Applied 1909 Patented 1910&lt;/ref&gt; a monocular optometer with a range of +0.25 to +6.00 diopters, consisting of a mechanism where a disc of low-powered lenses advanced a second disc of higher power lenses automatically with each rotation, as in a modern phoropter. 

There is no evidence this was ever manufactured, but in 1915 he filed for a patent for a binocular version of this same optometer,&lt;ref&gt;US Patent 1,270,336 Applied 1915 Patented 1918&lt;/ref&gt; and called it the Ski-Optometer, so named for its usefulness in doing skiascopy. This was manufactured by Wm. F. Reimold of Philadelphia. It included a Stevens Phorometer for measuring phorias, and a disc of auxiliary spherical lenses on the back, giving it a range of -12.00 to +12.00. To extend the range, there were clips on the front of each eye hole for the insertion of hand held sphere or cylinder trial lenses, with a mechanism to rotate the axis with the thumb. It weighed 2 lb. 3 oz. 

Around 1916 Michael Woolf, also of New York City, bought him out and added his own invention,&lt;ref&gt;US Patent 1,240,289 Applied 1916 Patented 1917&lt;/ref&gt; an innovative battery of cylinder lenses, ranging from -0.25 to -2.00, to the device, as well as Risley prisms for each eye. Maddox rods were optional. It weighed 3 lb. 13 oz. 

Around 1924 the patents and rights were transferred to General Optical Company of Mount Vernon, NY, which had been making a much larger, heavier and more solidly encased instrument, called the Genothalmic Refractor, since around 1920, using Woolf's 1917 patent number, and with a user's manual dated 1921. This instrument had a range of +17.75 to - 22.50, and up to -3.75 cylinder, Maddox rods, Risley prisms, and a Steven's phorometer. It weighed 7 pounds 5 ounces, and unlike all earlier devices of this kind, it hung from a horizontal mounting bar instead of being supported from the bottom. Like the Woolf, it had no Jackson cross-cylinders (JCC) at first, so a separate hand-held one was required. Late models of the Genothalmic were fitted with JCCs. 

General Optical sold out to Shuron Optical of Geneva, NY in 1927, which sold the refractor until the late 1930s.&lt;ref name="Phoroptors 2008"/&gt; A refined and improved version of the Genothalmic Refrator was manufactured in London starting around 1932, and sold in the UK by S. R. Stearman, S. Pulzer &amp; Son Ltd., and others, as the British Refracting Unit (B.R.U.).

=== DeZeng/American Optical/Reichert ===
[[File:DeZengAO.JPG|thumb|right|The early DeZeng/AO lineage. Top row: Model No. 570, 1917 or earlier, No. 584, 1922. Bottom row: No. 589, 1934, No. 590, 1948.]]Also in 1909, Henry DeZeng got a patent for what looks remarkably like a modern phoropter,&lt;ref&gt;Patent 941,766, applied 1908, patented 1909&lt;/ref&gt; but the patent illustrations look nothing like the manufactured product, which was introduced around 1915--the DeZeng Phoro-Optometer model 570. This was a device produced in Camden, New Jersey, which contained a battery of convex lenses for each eye, a battery of concave lenses for each eye, and auxiliary lenses which gave it a total power range of +15.75 to -19.75, as well as a Maddox rod and Risley prism for each eye, and a Steven's phorometer. 

There were no cylindrical lenses, so testing for [[Astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]] required the use of manual trial-lenses, for which there were rotating holders on the front of each eye hole, and there were stationary ones on the backs as well. Cross-cylinders were optional, but they did not flip like a Jackson cross cylinder, they rotated in the same plane, so they were probably meant for the near point cross-cylinder test for reading.&lt;ref&gt;Meyrowitz Catalogue of Ophthalmic Equipment, 6th edition, New York City, 1920&lt;/ref&gt; It weighed 3 lb. 2 oz. Around 1920 an improved model, No. 574, was introduced, reduced in size but with the same range (lenses reduced from 1 inch to ¾ inch). The forehead rest was removed, and the rear trial lens clips were replaced with rubber eye guards. It weighed 2 lbs. 12 oz. 

In 1922, DeZeng replaced No. 574 with No. 584, and shortened the name to Phoroptor. This device became so popular that its name became genericized, though often spelled phoropter. The Phoroptor was smaller (lenses reduced again, to 9/16 inch diameter) and more precisely made than the 574, but with a similar power range, and the front clips for hand-held trial lenses were removed and replaced with batteries of cylinder lenses ranging from -0.25 to -4.75. The Steven's phorometer was dropped, and there were no Jackson cross cylinders. It weighed 2 lb. 8 oz. 

In 1925, [[Maple Street Historic District (Southbridge, Massachusetts)|American Optical]] bought DeZeng, and in 1927 introduced No. 588, the AO Wellsworth DeZeng Phoroptor, which was slightly larger; the lenses were increased to 11/16 inch and it weighed 3 lb. 2 oz. This was the first in the DeZeng/AO line to hang from a horizontal mounting bar, the earlier ones were supported from a bar below it. This phoroptor was unique in that it was calibrated in 1/8 diopter steps throughout its whole range. 

In 1934, AO introduced No. 589, the Additive Effective Power Phoroptor, once again enlarged and improved. The lenses were increased to ¾ inch diameter, the permanent size, and the unit was much more massive, with a weight of 7 lb. 9 oz., and with a range of +16.87 to -19.12 and -6.00 cylinder, with auxiliary lenses to increase these to +18.87/-21.12/-8.00. All these models resembled the original DeZeng model in design, but No. 590 of 1948 was a completely re-designed device, much larger and heavier, and more modern. It weighed 10 lbs. 7 oz. This was followed by another complete re-design in 1956, the RxMaster,&lt;ref name="Phoroptors 2008"/&gt; which became the prototype of all modern phoropters, and was updated to the Ultramatic RxMaster in 1967, which is the current model. 

AO sold their phoroptor division to Reichert in 1982, who still makes the Ultramatic.

Top left, the Genothalmic Refractor; top right, the AO 589 Phoroptor; bottom, the B&amp;L Greens' Refractor, still much in use today.]]In the early 20th century, ophthalmologists A. S. Green, L. D. Green, and M. I. Green, of San Francisco, CA, designed an [[Optometer (ophthalmic instrument)|optometer]],&lt;ref&gt;Bauch and Lomb Greens' Refractor Reference Manual, date uncertain&lt;/ref&gt; which they developed slowly over many years. Drs. Green teamed up with inventor Clyde L. Hunsicker of San Francisco, who applied for a patent on October 25, 1926. The title of their invention was simply an "optometrist instrument", and the text described it as an optometer. Patent 1,804,690 was granted to the Greens and Hunsicker in 1931, and sold to [[Bausch &amp; Lomb]] (B&amp;L), who had them redesign it (patent 1,873,356, granted 1932). 

B&amp;L trademarked it as "Greens' Refractor" and introduced it in 1934. It was far more advanced than the competition in many ways. The power could be read right off the dial without having to do mental calculations, the range was far higher, from +19.75 to -28.00 and with cylinders up to -7.50, the battery of cylinders was much more intuitive and easy to use, and it was the first to have Jackson cross cylinders affixed, (the first AO Phoroptors with JCC's were late models of the Additive, and very late Genothalmic Refractors also had them). It weighed 13 lbs. 1 oz. The Greens' Refractor soon became the gold standard among eyecare professionals. It helped put the Woolf/Genothalmic/Shuron line out of the market and forced AO to completely redesign their phoroptor from scratch, not once, but twice, (the 590 failed to compete). 

The Greens' Refractor remained unchanged for over 4 decades, but sales slipped when AO introduced the Ultramatic RxMaster with its revolutionary yoked JCC in 1967, and production of the Greens' Refractor finally ended in the late 1970s. In 1978, B&amp;L introduced the Greens' II refractor with yoked JCC, but due to patent dispute lost it to AO, who discontinued it. As for the original Greens' Refractor, in spite of the fact that production stopped decades ago, many are still being used today, as they are virtually indestructible, and have a devoted rank of optometrists who swear by them.&lt;ref name="Phoroptors 2008"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="841">A '''primordial cyst''' is a developmental [[odontogenic]] [[cyst]]. It is found in an area where a [[tooth]] should have formed but is missing. Primordial cysts most commonly arise in the area of [[human mandible|mandibular]] [[third molar]]s. Under [[microscope]]s, the cyst looks like an [[odontogenic keratocyst]] (also called a Keratocyst odontogenic tumor) whereby the [[lesion]]s displays a [[parakeratinize]]d [[epithelium]] with [[palisading]] basal epithelial cells.

The term "Primordial cyst" is considered an outdated term and should be avoided.{{mcn|date=June 2015}} Most "primordial cysts" are actually [[Keratocyst odontogenic tumor]]s (KOT's).

The '''right to health''' is the [[economic, social and cultural right]] to a universal minimum standard of [[health]] to which all individuals are entitled. The concept of a right to health has been enumerated in international agreements which include the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] and the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]. There is debate on the interpretation and application of the right to health due to considerations such as how health is defined, what minimum entitlements are encompassed in a right to health, and which institutions are responsible for ensuring a right to health.

== Definition ==

=== Constitution of the World Health Organization ===

The [[preamble]] of the 1946 [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) Constitution defines [[health]] broadly as "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Constitution of the World Health Organization |year=1948 |url=http://apps.who.int/gb/bd/PDF/bd47/EN/constitution-en.pdf |publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution defines the right to health as "the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health," and enumerates some principles of this right as healthy child development; equitable dissemination of medical knowledge and its benefits; and government-provided social measures to ensure adequate health.

Frank P. Grad credits the WHO Constitution as "claiming ... the full area of contemporary international public health," establishing the right to health as a "fundamental, [[Natural and legal rights|inalienable human right]]" that governments cannot abridge, and are rather obligated to protect and uphold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grad|first=Frank P.|title=The Preamble of the Constitution of the World Health Organization|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|date=Jan 2002|volume=80|issue=12|page=981|url=http://www.scielosp.org/pdf/bwho/v80n12/8012a13.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO Constitution, notably, marks the first formal demarcation of a right to health in international law.

=== Universal Declaration of Human Rights ===
Article 25 of the United Nations' [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights|Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] 1948 states that "Everyone has the [[right to an adequate standard of living|right to a standard of living]] adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services." The Universal Declaration makes additional accommodations for security in case of physical debilitation or disability, and makes special mention of care given to those in motherhood or childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|year=1948|publisher=United Nations|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is noted as the first international declaration of fundamental human rights, both freedoms and entitlements alike. United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights [[Navi Pillay|Navanethem Pillay]] writes that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights "enshrines a vision that requires taking all human rights—civil, political, economic, social, or cultural—as an indivisible and organic whole, inseparable and interdependent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pillai|first=Navanethem|title=Right to Health and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights|journal=The Lancet|date=Dec 2008|volume=372|issue=9655|pages=2005–2006|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0140673608617833/1-s2.0-S0140673608617833-main.pdf?_tid=576e0a0a-3520-11e3-996f-00000aacb362&amp;acdnat=1381790057_3db2cd8cca6cb73ab41e1eb74b14e7bf|accessdate=14 Oct 2013|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61783-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Gruskin et al. contend that the interrelated nature of the rights expressed in the Universal Declaration establishes a "responsibility [that] extends beyond the provision of essential health services to tackling the determinants of health such as, provision of adequate education, housing, food, and favourable working conditions," further stating that these provisions "are human rights themselves and are necessary for health."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gruskin|first=Sofia|author2=Edward J. Mills |author3=Daniel Tarantola |title=History, Principles, and Practice of Health and Human Rights|journal=The Lancet|date=August 2007|volume=370|issue=9585|pages=449–455|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61200-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination ===

Health is briefly addressed in the United Nations' [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]], which was adopted in 1965 and entered into effect in 1969. The Convention calls upon States to "Prohibit and to eliminate racial discrimination in all its forms and to guarantee the right of everyone, without distinction as to race, colour, or national or ethnic origin, to equality before the law," and references under this provision "The right to public health, medical care, social security and social services."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|year=1965|publisher=United Nations|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CERD.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ===

The United Nations further defines the right to health in Article 12 of the 1966 [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], which states:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|year=1966|publisher=United Nations|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation | The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. The steps to be taken by the States Parties to the present Covenant to achieve the full realization of this right shall include those necessary for:
:The reduction of the stillbirth-rate and of infant mortality and for the healthy development of the child;
:The improvement of all aspects of environmental and industrial hygiene;
:The prevention, treatment and control of [[epidemic]], [[endemic]], [[occupational disease|occupational]] and other diseases;
:The creation of conditions which would assure to [[universal health care|all medical service]] and medical attention in the event of sickness. }}

==== General Comment No. 14 ====
In 2000, the United Nations' Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights issued General Comment No. 14, which addresses "substantive issues arising in the implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights" with respect to Article 12 and "the right to the highest attainable standard of health."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=General Comment No. 14|year=2000|publisher=UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/40d009901358b0e2c1256915005090be?Opendocument |location=Geneva}}&lt;/ref&gt; The General Comment provides more explicit, operational language on the freedoms and entitlements included under a right to health.

The General Comment makes the direct clarification that "the ''right to health'' is not to be understood as a ''right to be healthy.''" Instead, the right to health is articulated as a set of both freedoms and entitlements which accommodate the individual's biological and social conditions as well as the State's available resources, both of which may preclude a ''right to be healthy'' for reasons beyond the influence or control of the State. Article 12 tasks the State with recognizing that each individual holds an inherent right to the best feasible standard of health, and itemizes (at least in part) the 'freedoms from' and 'entitlements to' that accompany such a right; however, it does not charge the State with ensuring that all individuals, in fact, are fully healthy, nor that all individuals have made full recognition of the rights and opportunities enumerated in the right to health.

===== Relation to other rights =====
Like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the General Comment clarifies the interrelated nature of human rights, stating that, "the right to health is closely related to and dependent upon the realization of other human rights," and thereby underscoring the importance of advancements in other entitlements such as the rights to food, work, housing, life, non-discrimination, human dignity, and access to importance, among others, towards the recognition of the right to health. Similarly, the General Comment acknowledges that "the right to health embraces a wide range of socio-economic factors that promote conditions in which people can lead a healthy life, and extends to the underlying determinants of health." In this respect, the General Comment holds that the specific steps towards realizing the right to health enumerated in Article 12 are non-exhaustive and strictly illustrative in nature.

===== Health equity =====
The General Comment also makes additional reference to the question of [[health equity]], a concept not addressed in the initial International Covenant. The document notes, "The Covenant proscribes any [[discrimination]] in access to health care and underlying determinants of health, as well as to means and entitlements for their procurement." Moreover, responsibility for ameliorating discrimination and its effects with regards to health is delegated to the State: "States have a special obligation to provide those who do not have sufficient means with the necessary health insurance and health-care facilities, and to prevent any discrimination on internationally prohibited grounds in the provision of health care and health services." Additional emphasis is placed upon non-discrimination on the basis of gender, age, disability, or membership in indigenous communities.

===== Responsibilities of states and international organizations =====
Subsequent sections of the General Comment detail the obligations of nations and international organizations towards a right to health. The obligations of nations are placed into three categories: obligations to respect, obligations to protect, and obligations to fulfill the right to health. Examples of these (in non-exhaustive fashion) include preventing discrimination in access or delivery of care; refraining from limitations to contraceptive access or family planning; restricting denial of access to health information; reducing environmental pollution; restricting coercive and/or harmful culturally-based medical practices; ensuring equitable access to social determinants of health; and providing proper guidelines for the accreditation of medical facilities, personnel, and equipment. International obligations include allowing for the enjoyment of health in other countries; preventing violations of health in other countries; cooperating in the provision of humanitarian aid for disasters and emergencies; and refraining from use of embargoes on medical goods or personnel as an act of political or economic influence.

=== Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ===

Article 12 of the 1979 United Nations [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] outlines women's protection from gender discrimination when receiving health services and women's entitlement to specific gender-related healthcare provisions. The full text of Article 12 states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm|year=1979|publisher=United Nations|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation | '''Article 12''':
# States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in the field of health care in order to ensure, on a basis of equality of men and women, access to health care services, including those related to family planning.
# Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I of this article, States Parties shall ensure to women appropriate services in connection with pregnancy, confinement and the post-natal period, granting free services where necessary, as well as adequate nutrition during pregnancy and lactation.}}

=== Convention on the Rights of the Child ===

Health is mentioned on several instances in the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (1989). Article 3 calls upon parties to ensure that institutions and facilities for the care of children adhere to health standards. Article 17 recognizes the child's right to access information that is pertinent to his/her physical and mental health and well-being. Article 23 makes specific reference to the rights of disabled children, in which it includes health services, rehabilitation, preventive care. Article 24 outlines child health in detail, and states, "Parties recognize the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health. States shall strive to ensure that no child is deprived of his or her right of access to such health care services." Towards implementation of this provision, the Convention enumerates the following measures:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Convention on the Rights of the Child|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx|year=1989|publisher=United Nations|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation |

The World Health Organization website comments, "The CRC is the normative and legal framework for WHO’s work across the broad spectrum of child and adolescent health."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Rights|url=http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/topics/child/rights/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldhagen presents the CRC as a "template for child advocacy" and proposes its use as a framework for reducing disparities and improving outcomes in child health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldhagen|first=Jeffrey|title=Children's Rights and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child|journal=Pediatrics|date=Sep 2003|volume=112|issue=Supp. 3|pages=742–745|url=http://www.pediatricsdigest.mobi/content/112/Supplement_3/742.full|accessdate=5 November 2013|pmid=12949339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ===

Article 25 of the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] (2006) specifies that "persons with disabilities have the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health without discrimination on the basis of disability." The sub-clauses of Article 25 state that States shall give the disabled the same "range, quality, and standard" of health care as it provides to other persons, as well as those services specifically required for prevention, identification, and management of disability. Further provisions specify that health care for the disabled should be made available in local communities and that care should be geographically equitable, with additional statements against the denial or unequal provision of health services (including "food and fluids" and "life insurance") on the basis of disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article 25 - Health {{!}} United Nations Enable|url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/article-25-health.html|website=www.un.org|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hendriks{{who|date=January 2015}} criticizes the failure of the Convention to define specifically the term "disability"; he contends further that "the absence of a clear description [...] may prejudice the uniform interpretation, or at least place in jeopardy the consistent protection the Convention seeks to guarantee." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hendriks|first=Aart|title=UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities|journal=[[European Journal of Health Law]]|date=Nov 2007|volume=14|issue=3|pages=273–298|doi= 10.1163/092902707X240620 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He does, however, acknowledge that the lack of a clear definition for "disability" may benefit the disabled by limiting the State's ability to limit extension of the Convention's provisions to specific populations or those with certain conditions.

=== Definitions in academic literature ===
While most human rights are theoretically framed as ''negative rights,'' meaning that they are areas upon which society cannot interfere or restrict by political action, [[Mervyn Susser]] contends that the right to health is a particularly unique and challenging right because it is often expressed as a ''positive right,'' where society bears an obligation to provide certain resources and opportunities to the general population.

Susser further sets out four provisions that he sees as covered under a right to health: equitable access to health and medical services; a "good-faith" social effort to promote equal health among different social groups; means to measure and assess health equity; and equal sociopolitical systems to give all parties a unique voice in health advocacy and promotion. He is careful to note here that, while this likely entails some minimum standard of access to health resources, it does not guarantee or necessitate an equitable state of health for each person due to inherent biological differences in health status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Susser|first=Mervyn|title=Health as a Human Right: An Epidemiologist's Perspective on the Public Health|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=Mar 1993|volume=83|issue=3|pages=418–426|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1694643/pdf/amjph00527-0116.pdf|accessdate=14 November 2013|doi=10.2105/ajph.83.3.418|pmid=8438984|pmc=1694643}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction is an important one, as some common critiques of a "right to health" are that it establishes a right to an unreachable standard and that it aspires to a state of health that is too subjectively variable from person to person or from one society to the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toebes|first=Brigit|title=Towards an Improved Understanding of the International Human Right to Health|journal=Human Rights Quarterly|date=Aug 1999|volume=21|issue=3|pages=661–679|jstor=762669|doi=10.1353/hrq.1999.0044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Susser's discussion centers on healthcare as a positive right, Paul Hunt refutes this view and makes the argument that the right to health also encompasses certain negative rights such as a protection from discrimination and the right to not receive medical treatment without the recipient's voluntary consent. However, Hunt does concede that some positive rights, such as the responsibility of society to pay special attention to the health needs of the underserved and vulnerable, are included in the right to health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Paul|title=The Human Right to the Highest Attainable Standard of Health: New Opportunities and Challenges|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|date=Mar 2006|volume=100|pages=603–607|url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/hrc/research/projects/rth/docs/Paul_hunt_leading_article.pdf|accessdate=14 November 2013|doi=10.1016/j.trstmh.2006.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Farmer addresses the issue of unequal access to health care in his article, "The Major Infectious Diseases in the World - To Treat or Not to Treat." He discusses the growing "outcome gap" between the populations receiving health interventions and the ones that are not. Poor people are not receiving the same treatment, if any at all, as the more financially fortunate. The high costs of medicine and treatment make it problematic for poor countries to receive equal care. He states, "Excellence without equity looms as the chief human-rights dilemma of health care in the 21st century."&lt;ref&gt;Farmer, Paul. 2001. [http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200107193450310 The Major Infectious Diseases in the World -- To Treat or Not to Treat?] N Engl J Med 345 (3):208-210.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human right to health care ==

An alternative way to conceptualize one facet of the right to health is a “human right to health '''care'''.”  Notably, this encompasses both patient and provider rights in the delivery of healthcare services, the latter being similarly open to frequent abuse by the states.&lt;ref name="opensocietyfoundations1"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Beletsky L, Ezer T, Overall J, Byrne I, Cohen J |title= Advancing human rights in patient care: the law in seven transitional countries|journal=Open Society Foundations|year=2013|url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/publications/advancing-human-rights-patient-care-practitioner-guides}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patient rights in [[health care]] delivery include: the [[right to privacy]], information, life, and quality care, as well as freedom from discrimination, [[torture]], and [[cruel and unusual punishment|cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment]].&lt;ref name="opensocietyfoundations1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Open Society Institute.|title=Health and human rights: a resource guide|journal=Open Society Foundations|year=2013|url=http://www.equalpartners.info/Chapter1/ch1_1How.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marginalized groups, such as [[immigration|migrants]] and persons who have been displaced, racial and [[ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]], [[women]], [[sexual minority|sexual minorities]], and those living with HIV, are particularly [[social vulnerability|vulnerable]] to violations of human rights in healthcare settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ezer T.|title=making laws work for patients|journal=Open Society Foundations|date=May 2013|url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/making-laws-work-patients}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|author=J Amon.|title=Abusing patients: health providers' complicity in torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment |journal=World Report 2010, Human Rights Watch|year=2010|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report-2010/abusing-patients}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, racial and ethnic minorities may be segregated into poorer quality wards, disabled persons may be contained and forcibly medicated, drug users may be denied addiction treatment, women may be forced into vaginal examinations and may be denied life-saving abortions, suspected homosexual men may be forced into anal examinations, and women of marginalized groups and transgender persons may be [[compulsory sterilization|forcibly sterilized]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ezer T.|title=Making Laws Work for Patients|journal=Open Society Foundations|date=May 2013|url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/making-laws-work-patients}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provider rights include: the right to quality standards of working conditions, the right to associate freely, and the right to refuse to perform a procedure based on their morals.&lt;ref name="opensocietyfoundations1"/&gt;  Healthcare providers often experience violations of their rights. For instance, particularly in countries with weak rule of law, healthcare providers are often forced to perform procedures which negate their morals, deny marginalized groups the best possible standards of care, breach patient confidentiality, and conceal crimes against humanity and torture.&lt;ref name="amazonaws1993"&gt;{{cite journal|author= International Dual Loyalty Working Group.|title= Dual Loyalty &amp; Human Rights in Health Professional Practice: Proposed Guidelines &amp; Institutional Mechanisms|year=1993|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/PHR_Reports/dualloyalties-2002-report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= F Hashemian|title=Broken laws, broken lives: medical evidence of torture by US personnel and its impact|journal=Physicians for Human Rights|year=2008|url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/pdf/phrbrokenlaws.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, providers who do not oblige these pressures are often persecuted.&lt;ref name="amazonaws1993"/&gt; Currently, especially in the United States, much debate surrounds the issue of “provider consciousness”, which retains the right of providers to abstain from performing procedures that do not align with their moral code, such as abortions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=CNN.|title=Rule aims to protect health providers' right of conscience|journal=CNNHealth.com|year=2008|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/12/18/provider.conscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=T Stanton Collett.|title=Protecting the healthcare provider's right of conscience|journal=Trinity International University, the Center for Bioethics and Human Dignity|year=2004|url=http://cbhd.org/content/protecting-health-care-providers-right-conscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal reform as a mechanism to combat and prevent violations of patient and provider rights presents a promising approach. However, in transitional countries (newly formed countries undergoing reform), and other settings with weak rule of law, may be limited.&lt;ref name="opensocietyfoundations1"/&gt; Resources and tools for lawyers, providers, and patients interested in  improving human rights in patient care have been formulated.&lt;ref name="opensocietyfoundations1"/&gt;

== Criticism ==

Philip Barlow writes that health care should not be considered a human right because of the difficulty of defining what it entails and where the 'minimum standard' of entitlements under the right ought to be established. Additionally, Barlow contends that rights establish duties upon others to protect or guarantee them, and that it is unclear who holds the social responsibility for the right to health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barlow|first=Philip|title=Health Care Is Not a Human Right|journal=British Medical Journal|date=31 Jul 1999|volume=319|issue=7205|page=321|doi=10.1136/bmj.319.7205.321|pmid=10426762|pmc=1126951}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Berkeley, in agreement with Barlow, critiques further that the right to health does not consider adequately the responsibility that an individual has to uphold his or her own health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berkeley|first=John|title=Health Care Is Not a Human Right|journal=British Medical Journal|date=4 Aug 1999|volume=319|issue=7205|page=321|url=http://www.bmj.com/rapid-response/2011/10/28/health-care-not-human-right|accessdate=14 November 2013|doi=10.1136/bmj.319.7205.321|pmid=10426762|pmc=1126951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard D Lamm vehemently argues against making healthcare a right. He defines a right as one that is to be defended at all costs, and a concept that is defined and interpreted by the judicial system. Making healthcare a right would require governments to spend a large portion of its resources to provide its citizens with it. He asserts that the healthcare system is based on the erroneous assumption of unlimited resources. Limited resources inhibits governments from providing everyone with adequate healthcare, especially in the long term. Attempting to provide "beneficial" healthcare to all people utilizing limited resources could lead to economical collapse. Lamm asserts that access to healthcare but a small part in producing a healthy society, and to create a healthy society, resources should also be spent on social resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Lamm, R. |year=1998 |title=The case against making healthcare a "right." |work=American Bar Association: Defending Liberty Pursuing Justice |volume=25 | issue = 4  |pages=8–11 |jstor=27880117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism of the right to health is that it is not feasible. Imre J.P. Loefler {{who|date=March 2017}} argues that the financial and logistical burdens of ensuring health care for all are unattainable, and that resource constraints make it unrealistic to justify a right towards prolonging life indefinitely. Instead, Loefler suggests that the goal of improving population health is better served through socioeconomic policy than a formal right to health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loefler|first=Imre J.P.|title="Health Care Is a Human Right" Is a Meaningless and Devastating Manifesto|journal=British Medical Journal|date=26 Jun 1999|volume=318|issue=7200|pages=1766|doi=10.1136/bmj.318.7200.1766a|pmid=10381735|pmc=1116108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society''' ({{lang-si|ශ්‍රී ලංකා අක්ෂිදාන සංගමය}}, {{lang-ta|இலங்கை கண் தானச்சங்கம்}}) is a [[non-governmental organization]] involved in [[organ donation|donating]] human [[eye]]s and [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]s for [[Organ transplantation|transplantation]].&lt;ref name="lankabusinessonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lankabusinessonline.com/print.php?nid=238441942 | title=Eyeing Merit: Pakistan from Sri Lankan eyes | publisher=lankabusinessonline.com | date=November 2004 | accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves patients in need both in Sri Lanka and around the world. The society is a non-profit organization and provides the organs free of charge, except for a small fee on processing and delivery.&lt;ref name="japantimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20100122f2.html | title=Sri Lanka eye bank gives sight worldwide | work=[[The Japan Times]] | date=22 January 2010 | accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Deshabandu]] [[Doctor (title)|Dr.]] [[Hudson Silva]], the founder and inaugural president of the society, launched the first campaign to collect [[cornea]]s in Sri Lanka in 1958 as a medical student. The first set of corneas he received in 1959 were stored in his home refrigerator at Wijerama Mawatha in [[Colombo]].&lt;ref name="indiavideo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiavideo.org/text/srilanka-eye-donation-1571.php | title=Srilanka, A success story | publisher=indiavideo.org | accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with his wife, Irangani de Silva, he founded the Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society in 1961. In 1964 they sent their first overseas donation to Singapore; the corneas were packed in ice in a tea [[Vacuum flask|thermos]] and hand-carried during the flight.&lt;ref name="associatedpr"/&gt;

Since then, conditions have improved and the organization has provided 60,000 corneas for [[corneal transplantation]], for patients in 57 countries.&lt;ref name="associatedpr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2012/01/23/sri-lanka-donates-eyes-to-world/ | title=Sri Lanka donates eyes to the world | work=[[Associated Press]] | publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] | date=23 January 2012 | accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 900,000 people have signed up to donate their eyes through the society after their death. The society receives about 3,000 corneas a year and more than 2,000 are shipped abroad. The most prominent recipient country has been [[Pakistan]] (where the traditional [[Islam]]ic law requires bodies to be buried whole and intact), with over 20,000 corneas.&lt;ref name="pakistaneyebank"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistaneyebank.org/component/content/article/1-latest-news/1-welcome-to-pakistan-eye-bank-society.html | title=Welcome to Pakistan Eye Bank Society | work=Pakistan Eye Bank | accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egypt]] and [[Japan]] have received over 8,000 and 6,000 corneas, respectively. In Sri Lanka itself, citizens have first access to free corneas.&lt;ref name="associatedpr"/&gt; 

In 2003, the United Nations Association of Sri Lanka joined with the Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society to initiate the "Sight Project", with the aim of assisting patients in need of cornea transplants through United Nations Associations in their respective countries.&lt;ref name="una-sl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unasl.org/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=27 | format=PDF | title=UNASL inaugurates "Sight Project" in association with Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society | publisher=United Nations Association of Sri Lanka | accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
The society has over 450 branches in Sri Lanka, with a manpower of over 15,000 trained volunteers who are ready to remove donor eyes on demand.&lt;ref name="tc-iaea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-tc.iaea.org/tcweb/publications/factsheets/tissue.pdf | format=PDF | title=Tissue Bank: Srii Lanka | publisher=[[International Atomic Energy Agency]] | date=1998 | accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extraction is done within 8 hours of death, packed in ice and received at the laboratory within 4 hours.&lt;ref name="associatedpr"/&gt; The extraction process has to be handled with care, to avoid damaging ''[[Corneal endothelium]]'', a thin layer of cells on the inner surface of the cornea that pumps water away to keep it clear. Transplantation is carried out within 5 to 21 days from the removal of the body, depending on the type of preservation medium used.&lt;ref name="japantimes"/&gt; The donated corneas are tested for [[HIV]], [[hepatitis]], and [[sexually transmitted disease]]s before use.&lt;ref name="associatedpr"/&gt;

===Eye bank===
The Human Tissue Transplantation Act No. 48 of 1987 set out the legal framework for tissue procurement and transplantation in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="aealk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aea.ac.lk/success_story.html | title=Sri Lanka Human Tissue Bank | publisher=Atomic Energy Authority, Sri Lanka |accessdate=25 January 2012 | location=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society maintains the Sri Laknka International Eye Bank and Sri Lanka Model Human Tissue Bank, which is one of the largest in the world. The eye bank was established in late 1980s and the tissue bank in 1998.&lt;ref name="tc-iaea"/&gt; It is the first organization in the world that supplies or transplants corneas free of charge to the public.

==Cultural effects==
Sri Lanka is among the largest cornea providers in the world. The cultural background of the country has helped the organization to thrive in eye donation. The [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] concept of ''[[Dāna]]'' or giving, has been the root cause of its success, in a country which approximately 70% of the population is Buddhist.&lt;ref name="japantimes"/&gt; [[Hindus]] and [[Christians]] have also donated eyes via the society.&lt;ref name="associatedpr"/&gt; Many famous individuals, including the late [[President of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan President]] [[Junius Richard Jayewardene|J. R. Jayewardene]], have donated their eyes upon death. Jayewardene's corneas were successfully grafted to two Japanese recipients.&lt;ref name="japantimes"/&gt;

'''''The Weight Loss Cure "They" Don't Want You to Know About''''' is a [[weight loss]] book written by controversial author [[Kevin Trudeau]].  It was released in April 2007 by Alliance Publishing.

==About==

Trudeau was convicted of felonies&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin Trudeau#Criminal history and legal problems]]&lt;/ref&gt; and fined by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] for making fraudulent claims pertaining to the book, in part because it gives medical advice but he has no medical training.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin Trudeau#No medical training]]&lt;/ref&gt; The book repeats a  refuted claim to change activity in the [[hypothalamus]], linked to the [[pituitary]] gland, with the intention to control hunger and regulation of fat cells, by using [[herbal supplement]]s and repeated use of the [[Human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]] hormone; this claim was originally made by [[Albert T. W. Simeons]] in the 1950s. Simeons' results were not reproduced by other researchers and in 1976 in response to complaints the FDA required Simeons and others to include the following disclaimer on all advertisements:

{{quotation|These weight reduction treatments include the injection of HCG, a drug which has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as safe and effective in the treatment of obesity or weight control. There is no substantial evidence that HCG increases weight loss beyond that resulting from caloric restriction, that it causes a more attractive or "normal" distribution of fat, or that it decreases the hunger and discomfort associated with calorie-restrictive diets.|1976 FDA-mandated disclaimer for HCG diet advertisements}}

The book follows up his two other bestselling but critically panned books, ''[[Natural Cures "They" Don't Want You to Know About]]'' and ''More Natural Cures Revealed: Previously Censored Brand Name Products That Cure Disease''. ''Weight Loss Cure'' has appeared on the bestseller's lists of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'', ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', and ''[[The New York Times]]''.

==Legal issues==

The FTC has filed a contempt of court action against Trudeau and the companies that market his book alleging that Trudeau is in contempt of a 2004 court order by "deceptively claiming in his infomercials that the book being advertised establishes a weight-loss protocol that is "easy" to follow. The action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on September 17, 2007.&lt;ref name="brief"&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0323064.shtm Federal Trade Commission, Plaintiff v. Kevin Trudeau, Shop America (USA) LLC, Shop America Marketing Group, LLC, Trustar Global Media, Limited, Robert Barefoot, Deonna Enterprises, Inc., and Karbo Enterprises, Inc., Defendants, and K.T. Corporation, Limited, and Trucom, LLC,]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a FTC Press Release, Trudeau claims that the weight loss plan outlined in the book is easy, can be done at home, and readers can eat anything they want.  When consumers buy the book, they find it describes a complex plan that requires intense dieting, daily injections of a prescribed drug that is not easily obtainable, and lifelong dietary restrictions.&lt;ref name="weight"&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2007/09/trudeau.shtm FTC: Marketer Kevin Trudeau Violated Prior Court Order - Charges Him with Misrepresenting Contents of Book, September 14, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 16, 2007, Trudeau was found in contempt of the 2004 court order for making "patently false" claims in his weight loss book.  U.S. District Court Judge Robert W. Gettleman ruled that Trudeau “clearly misrepresents in his advertisements the difficulty of the diet described in his book, and by doing so, he has misled thousands of consumers.”  A penalty will be determined at a later hearing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/business/20071119-1334-ftc-trudeau.html Court finds ''Natural Cures' author Trudeau in contempt of 2004 settlement, may be fined again'' Christopher S. Rugaber, Associated Press, November 19, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0323064/071121order.pdf Order Finding Trudeau in Contempt]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2007/11/kt.shtm Federal Court Finds Kevin Trudeau in Civil Contempt, FTC website, November 21, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2008, Trudeau was fined more than $5 million and banned from infomercials for three years for continuing to make fraudulent claims pertaining to the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2008/10/trudeau.shtm Kevin Trudeau Banned from Infomercials For Three Years, Ordered to Pay More Than $5 Million for False Claims About Weight-Loss Book], [[Federal Trade Commission]], October 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Complaints about Trudeau's weight loss system and business practices can be found at the [http://consumeraffairs.com/health/trudeau.html Consumer Affairs] website.  In summary, the complaints tend to refer to a problem of unsubscribing from the website and its monthly fees as well as the inability to follow the protocol, detailed by Trudeau, in the United States due to product availability and legal reasons.

==Book diet plan==
{{Primary sources|date=July 2008}}
The book's diet has been compared to a diet plan by British [[endocrinologist]] [[Albert T. W. Simeons]] in the 1950s.

In Phase 3, use of hCG stops, but food continues to be 100% organic.&lt;ref name=ROR19/&gt;  Other recommended activities include walking an hour a day or more, eating organic [[grapefruit]], and doing breathing exercises.&lt;ref name=primev/&gt;  Scheduled doctor visits, buying organic foods and hCG can be very expensive for the average consumer,&lt;ref name=ROR19/&gt; but wealthy people have paid to follow the plan, and the plan might work for people who can afford it.&lt;ref name=ROR19/&gt; According to an analysis by Carrie Poppy of Skeptical Inquirer, the weight loss plan would cost the user up to $18,000 if followed to the letter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/kevin_trudeaus_18000_weight_loss_plan_a_book_review/&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1962, the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' warned against the Simeons Diet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthresources.caremark.com/topic/dietscams Ten Pounds in Ten Days:  A Sampler of Diet Scams and Abuse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011182007/http://healthresources.caremark.com/topic/dietscams |date=2007-10-11 }} by Laura Fraser.&lt;/ref&gt;  The FTC ordered clinics and promoters of the Simeons Diet and hCG to cease making false claims about the effectiveness of hCG and its approval status by the FDA for weight loss.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dietscam.org/reports/hcg.shtml HCG Worthless as Weight-Loss Aid] by Stephen Barrett, M.D.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clinical trial|Clinical research trials]] published by the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] and the [[American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/29/9/940.pdf Ineffectiveness of human chorionic gonadotropin in weight reduction: a double-blind study]  American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 29:940–948, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that hCG is ineffective as a weight-loss aid.

'''Vollevannet''' is a freshwater is a [[lake]] in the municipality of [[Kristiansand]] in [[Vest-Agder]] county, [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yr.no/place/Norway/Vest-Agder/Kristiansand/Vollevannet/|title=Vollevannet, Kristiansand (Vest-Agder)|publisher=[[yr.no]]|language=Norwegian |accessdate=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The {{convert|0.15|km2|acre|adj=on}} lies in the district of [[Gimlekollen]] in the borough of [[Lund (Kristiansand)|Lund]], and the surrounding residential area is also called Vollevannet.  The lake lies along the [[European route E18]] highway at the exit for the [[Vest-Agder Museum Kristiansand]] and Ålefjær (county road 452). Historically, the lake was used as a reservoir for the city's [[drinking water]].  The lake is held back by two [[dam]]s, and there is a small, sandy beach at the northeast end of the lake.  The lake has [[European perch|perch]] in it.  

== Historical events ==
In February 1943, during the [[German occupation of Norway]], two Russian [[prisoners of war]] accused of burglary as well as attempting to escape were executed at the end of the lake Vollevannet. The two Russians were buried in the same grave. Two months later another Russian who had refused to work and had encouraged others to refuse was taken to Vollevannet and shot about {{convert|50|m}} from the first grave.  At the end of the war, the bodies of all three were dug up and taken to the Kristiansand crematorium. A memorial cross marks their former graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sovjetiske-krigsfanger.no/filer/pfd_sovjetiske_krigsfanger/1.krigsfanger_sorlandet.pdf|format=PDF|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2017-02-10|title=Russiske krigsfanger i Agderfylkene 1942-45|first=Johnny|last=Haugen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Disability}}
A '''walker''' or '''walking frame''' is a [[tool]] for [[disabled]] or elderly people who need additional support to maintain balance or stability while [[walking]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], a common equivalent term for a walker is '''Zimmer frame''', a [[Generic trademark|genericised trademark]] from [[Zimmer Holdings]], a major manufacturer of such devices and [[joint replacement]] parts.

Walkers started appearing in the early 1950s. The first US patent was awarded in 1953 to William Cribbes Robb, of Stretford, UK, for a device called "walking aid", which had been filed with the British patent office in August 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US2656874?printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Walking Aid - US Patent 2656874] Retrieved 2012-03-03&lt;/ref&gt; Two variants with wheels were both awarded US patents in May 1957,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US2792052?printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Invalid Walker - US Patent 2792052] Retrieved 2012-03-03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US2792874?printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Orthopedic Walker - US Patent 2792874] Retrieved 2012-03-03&lt;/ref&gt; and the first non-wheeled design that was called a "walker" was patented in 1965 by Elmer F. Ries of Cincinnati, Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US3165112?printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Walker or Walker Aid - US Patent 3165112] Retrieved 2012-03-03&lt;/ref&gt; The first walker to resemble modern walkers was patented in 1970 by Alfred A. Smith of Van Nuys, California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US3517677?printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Smith Invalid Walker - US Patent 3517677] Retrieved 2012-03-03&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The basic design consists of a lightweight frame that is about waist high, approximately 12 inches (30&amp;nbsp;cm) deep and slightly wider than the user. Walkers are also available in other sizes such as [[baby walker|pediatric]] (for children) or [[bariatric]] (for obese persons). Modern walkers are height adjustable and should be set at a height that is comfortable for the user, but will allow the user to maintain a slight bend in their arms. This bend is needed to allow for proper blood circulation through the arms as the walker is used. The front two legs of the walker may or may not have wheels attached, depending on the strength and abilities of the person using it. It is also common to see [[caster]] wheels or glides on the back legs of a walker with wheels on the front; additionally [[felt]] products adapted to glide with the legs such as adhesive feet, along with [[tennis ball]]s with holes cut into them to place them onto the legs are also utilized on surfaces such as hardwood, epoxy and linoleum flooring common to institutions.

== Use ==
The person walks with the frame surrounding their front and sides and their hands provide additional support by holding on to the top of the sides of the frame. Traditionally, a walker is picked up and placed a short distance ahead of the user. The user then walks to it and repeats the process. With the use of wheels and glides, the user may push the walker ahead as opposed to picking it up. This makes for easier use of the walker, as it does not require the user to use their arms to lift the walker. This is beneficial for those with little arm strength.

A walker is often used by those who are recuperating from leg or back injuries. It is also commonly used by persons having problems with walking or with mild balance problems.

Also related is a hemi-walker, a walker about half the size of a traditional walker which is intended for use by persons whose dexterity is limited or non-existent in one hand or arm. These walkers are more stable than a quad cane (a cane with four points that touch the ground, as opposed to one), but are not recommended as highly as a traditional walker for those who can use it.

==Walker cane hybrid==
[[Image:Walker Cane Hybrid in 4 Configurations.jpg|thumb|A Walker Cane Hybrid adjusted to four configurations.]]
A walker cane hybrid&lt;ref name="Hybrid"&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US8291924?printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true Multi-configuration Walking Apparatus – US Patent 8291924] Retrieved 2012-11-09.&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced in 2012 designed to bridge the gap between an [[assistive cane]] and a walker. The hybrid has two legs which provide lateral (side-to-side) support which a cane does not. It can be used with two hands in front of the user, similar to a walker, and provides an increased level of support compared with a cane. It can be adjusted for use with either one or two hands, at the front and at the side, as well as a stair climbing assistant. The hybrid is not designed to replace a walker which normally has four legs and provides four-way support using both hands.

== Rollators ==
A different approach to the walker is the '''rollator''', also called wheeled walker, invented by the [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[Aina Wifalk]] in 1978, herself a [[polio]] sufferer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innovationsinspiration.se/web/page.aspx?refid=294 Innovationsinspiraton: Aina Wifalk - Rollatorn] (in Swedish) Linked 2012-03-03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reddot"&gt;[http://en.red-dot.org/2796.html?&amp;cHash=6967d3807974a481a28a72ae47a68a70&amp;detail=8202 Rollator awarded reddot design award 2011] Linked 2012-03-03&lt;/ref&gt; Although originally a brand name, "rollator" has become a [[genericized trademark]] for wheeled walkers in many countries, and is also the most common type of walker in several European countries.

The rollator consists of a frame with three or four large wheels, handlebars and a built-in seat, which allows the user to stop and rest when needed. Rollators are also often equipped with a shopping basket. Rollators are typically more sophisticated than conventional walkers with wheels. They are adjustable in height and are light-weight, yet sturdier than conventional walkers. The handlebars are equipped with hand brakes that can be lifted or pushed downward to instantly stop the rollator. The brakes can also be used in maneuvering the rollator; by braking one side while turning the rollator towards that side a much tighter turning radius can be achieved.

A recent study has found an increase in the use of rollators by young people "usually in their thirties who are setting a new standard for walking among young people". The researchers conclude that this might be helpful in alleviating the stigma that using a rollator currently carries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=Kylie|last2=Goldstein|first2=Roger|last3=Gartner|first3=Elizabeth J.|last4=Brooks|first4=Dina|date=2008-06-01|title=Daily utility and satisfaction with rollators among persons with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation|volume=89|issue=6|pages=1108–1113|doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2007.11.032|issn=1532-821X|pmid=18503807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent Norwegian-made version of Wifalk's rollator won the [[Red Dot Design Award]] 2011 in the "Life science and medicine" class.&lt;ref name="Reddot"/&gt;
The European norm for walking aids EN ISO 11199-2:2005 applies to rollators and walking frames.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Disabled dog walker ==
This type of walker provides support and stability to the dogs, while allowing them to rely partly on their hind legs and continue using them.
It is suitable for dogs with mobility problems with hind legs (or unstable). It also helps them to exercise their back legs and can help maintaining any partial mobility they may have left or, in some cases, help to improve it.

==The Zimmers==
{{main|The Zimmers}}
In May 2007, a group of elderly people in the [[United Kingdom]] formed a musical group to highlight the plight and difficulties associated with old age. They called themselves [[The Zimmers]] in reference to 'Zimmer frame', a [[Genericized trademark|generic]] term for a walker.

[[File:Eight Dimensions of Wellness.png|alt=The Eight Dimensions of Wellness|thumb|The Eight Dimensions of Wellness]]
'''Wellness''' is generally used to mean a state beyond absence of illness but rather aims to optimize [[Quality of life|well-being]].&lt;ref name=NYT2010/&gt;

The notions behind the term share the same roots as the [[alternative medicine]] movement, in 19th-century movements in the US and Europe that sought to optimize health and to consider the whole person, like [[New Thought]], [[Christian Science]], and [[Lebensreform]].&lt;ref name=Kirkland&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirkland|first1=Anna|title=What Is Wellness Now?|journal=Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law|date=1 October 2014|volume=39|issue=5|pages=957–970|doi=10.1215/03616878-2813647|url=http://jhppl.dukejournals.org/content/39/5/957|language=en|issn=0361-6878}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blei|first1=Daniela|title=The False Promises of Wellness Culture|url=https://daily.jstor.org/the-false-promises-of-wellness-culture/|work=JSTOR Daily|date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was partly inspired by the preamble to the [[World Health Organization]]’s 1948 constitution which said: “Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”&lt;ref name=NYT2010&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/magazine/18FOB-onlanguage-t.html | work=The New York Times | title=Wellness | first=Ben | last=Zimmer | date=2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was initially brought to use in the US by [[Halbert L. Dunn| Halbert L. Dunn, M.D.]] in the 1950s; Dunn was the chief of the [[National Center for Health Statistics|National Office of Vital Statistics]] and discussed “high-level wellness,” which he defined as “an integrated method of functioning, which is oriented toward maximizing the potential of which the individual is capable.”&lt;ref name=NYT2010/&gt;  The term "wellness" was then adopted by [[John Travis (physician)|John Travis]] who opened a "Wellness Resource Center" in [[Mill Valley, California]] in the mid-1970s, which was seen by mainstream culture as part of the hedonistic culture of Northern California at that time and typical of the [[Me generation]].&lt;ref name=NYT2010/&gt;  Travis marketed the center as alternative medicine, opposed to what he said was the disease-oriented approach of [[medicine]].&lt;ref name=NYT2010/&gt; The concept was further popularized by [[Robert Rodale]] through [[Prevention (magazine)|''Prevention'' magazine]], Bill Hetler, a doctor at [[University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point]], who set up an annual academic conference on wellness, and Tom Dickey, who established the Berkeley Wellness Letter in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=NYT2010/&gt;  The term had become accepted as standard usage in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=NYT2010/&gt;

By the late 2000s the concept had become widely used in [[employee assistance program]]s in workplaces, and funding for development of such programs in small business was included in the [[Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref name=Kirkland/&gt;  The use of corporate wellness programs has been criticised as being discriminatory to [[people with disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;Basas, Carrie Griffin, What's Bad About Wellness? (August 1, 2014). [[Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law]], Vol. 39, No. 5, 2014. Available at [[SSRN]]: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2478902 &lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, while there were magazines devoted to wellness, it was noted that mainstream news sources had begun to devote more page space to "health and wellness themes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kickbusch |first1=Ilona |authorlink1=Ilona Kickbusch |last2=Payne |first2=Lea |title=Twenty-first century health promotion: the public health revolution meets the wellness revolution |journal=[[Health Promotion International]] |date=1 December 2003 |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=275–278 |doi=10.1093/heapro/dag418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] uses the concept of wellness in its programs, defining it as having eight aspects: emotional, environmental, financial, intellectual, occupational, physical, social, and spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.samhsa.gov/wellness-initiative/eight-dimensions-wellness|title=The Eight Dimensions of Wellness|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wellness trend has been criticised as a form of [[conspicuous consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bearne |first1=Suzanne |title=Wellness: just expensive hype, or worth the cost? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/01/wellness-hype-superfoods-yoga-price |accessdate=7 September 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=1 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
