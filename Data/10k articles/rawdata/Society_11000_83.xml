      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4955">The '''Columbus Shopping Mall Bombing Plot''' was a plan to blow up an unnamed [[shopping mall]] in the city of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] in the [[United States|American]] state of [[Ohio]]. The plot was disclosed by federal authorities on June 14, 2004, when an indictment against Nuradin Abdi was unsealed by the local [[United States District Court]]. Abdi was part of a clandestine cell of [[al-Qaida|al-Qaeda]] which sought to bring "death and destruction to Columbus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last =Mayhood | first =Kevin |author2=Jonathan Riskind |author3=Robert Ruth | title =MALL WAS TARGET, U.S. SAYS: PART 2 OF 2 | pages =News 01A | publisher =The Columbus Dispatch

==Background==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Nuradin Abdi.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Abdi]] --&gt;
Nuradin Abdi entered the United States as an asylum seeker from [[Somalia]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/2007/July/07_nsd_568.html&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in a predominantly Muslim neighborhood on the north side of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. According to one report, Abdi flew to [[Ethiopia]] to train in a military-style training camp in January 2000. There he allegedly was trained in the use of guns, guerrilla warfare, and bombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Somali Native Charged in a Bomb Plot, Ashcroft Says | date =2004-06-14 | url =http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2004/June/20040614165038dmslahrellek0.7101862.html | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20081203171418/http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2004/June/20040614165038dmslahrellek0.7101862.html | archivedate =2008-12-03 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned two months later.

Paul responded saying "that's a stupid idea". Abdi subsequently suggested bombing the mall, but few other details have been released.

Abdi was arrested on November 28, 2003, and charged with Conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, Conspiracy to provide material support to al-Qaeda, and two counts of fraud and misuse of documents. His attorneys became concerned with his mental state, and he was sent to a federal medical center in [[Minnesota]] in June 2004 to undergo tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

New details released at the time of the plea agreement show that there were likely more than the aforementioned three people who were involved in the plot. Documents that were filed along with Abdi's agreement note a fourth person whom the trio met with both in Columbus and in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].

A 2011 [[NPR]] report claimed some of the people associated with this plot were imprisoned in a highly restrictive [[Communication Management Unit]].&lt;ref name=npr2/&gt;

'''''5 Broken Cameras''''' ({{lang-ar|خمس كاميرات محطمة}} ''Khamas Kamīrāt Muḥaṭṭamah''; {{lang-he|חמש מצלמות שבורות}} ''Hamesh Matslemot Shvurot'') is a 94-minute documentary film co-directed by Palestinian [[Emad Burnat]] and Israeli [[Guy Davidi]]. It was shown at film festivals in 2011 and placed in general release by [[Kino International (company)|Kino Lorber]] in 2012. ''5 Broken Cameras'' is a first-hand account of protests in [[Bil'in]], a [[West Bank]] village affected by the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]]. The documentary was shot almost entirely by Palestinian farmer Emad Burnat, who bought his first camera in 2005 to record the birth of his youngest son. In 2009 Israeli co-director Guy Davidi joined the project. Structured around the destruction of Burnat's cameras, the filmmakers' collaboration follows one family's evolution over five years of turmoil.&lt;ref name="Official Website"&gt;{{official website|http://www.kinolorber.com/5brokencameras}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film won a 2012 [[Sundance Film Festival]] award, it won the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130703112324/http://www.gaiff.am/en/home/ Golden Apricot]  at the 2012 [[Yerevan International Film Festival]], [[Armenia]], for Best Documentary Film, won the 2013 [[International Emmy Award]],&lt;ref name="International Emmy Award Official website"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Emmy Award Official website|url=http://www.iemmys.tv/awards_previous.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="'5 Broken Cameras' clinches International Emmy Award"&gt;{{cite web|title='5 Broken Cameras' clinches International Emmy Award, November 26, 2013, Haaretz|url=http://www.haaretz.com/life/arts-leisure/1.560211}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated for a 2013 [[85th Academy Awards|Academy Award]].

==Synopsis==
There are five cameras — each with its own story. When his fourth son, Gibreel, is born in 2005, self-taught cameraman Emad Burnat, a Palestinian villager, gets his first camera. At the same time in his village of Bil’in, the Israelis begin bulldozing village olive groves to build a barrier to separate Bil'in from the Jewish Settlement Modi'in Illit. The barrier's route cuts off 60% of Bil'in farmland and the villagers resist this seizure of more of their land by the settlers.

During the next year, Burnat films this struggle, which is led by two of his best friends including his brother [[Iyad Burnat|Iyad]], while at the same time recording the growth of his son. Very soon, these events begin to affect his family and his own life. Emad films the Army and Police beating and arresting villagers and activists who come to support them. Settlers destroy Palestinian olive trees  and attack Burnat when he tries to film them. The Army raids the village in the middle of the night to arrest children. He, his friends, and brothers are arrested or shot; some are killed. Each camera used to document these events is shot or smashed.

Eventually, in 2009, Burnat approaches Guy Davidi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=5 Broken Cameras: Guy Davidi Interview - TAKE ONE|url=http://www.takeonecff.com/2012/5-broken-cameras-guy-davidi-interview|accessdate=5 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; – an Israeli filmmaker and together, from these five broken cameras and the stories that they represent, these two filmmakers create the film.

==Production==

===Background and Emad Burnat===
Israel began construction of an [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] in the West Bank village of Bil’in, Palestine in 2005.&lt;ref name=barrier2&gt;{{cite web|last=Kershner|first=Isabel|title=Israeli Court Orders Barrier Rerouted|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/05/world/middleeast/05mideast.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discovering that the wall would cut through their agricultural land, confiscating half of it, the villagers initiated popular protests and were joined by Israeli and international activists.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} At that point Burnat received a camera to document the movement.

In 2007 the [[Israeli Supreme Court]] ordered the barrier rerouted,&lt;ref name=barrier2/&gt; and four years later, after village access to some of the land was restored, the demonstrations were called off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scott|first=A.O.|title=A Palestinian Whose Cameras Are Witnesses and Casualties of Conflict|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/movies/5-broken-cameras-shows-life-in-one-palestinian-village.html?_r=0|website=New York Times|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://globalinitiative-escr.org/palestinian-villages-complaint-against-canada-registered-with-the-un-human-rights-committee/ A case against Canada], for failing to prevent Canadian corporations from being complicit in the building of the settlements, is currently pending before the UN Human Rights Committee.

The first year, Burnat filmed mainly to serve the purposes of activists. His footage was introduced as evidence in Israeli court and posted on [[YouTube]] to spread awareness of the growing movement.

As media interest in Bil’in grew, Burnat's footage gained international recognition and was used by local and international news agencies. He started working as a freelance photographer for Reuters and provided footage documenting the villagers' fight to professional filmmakers. This footage was used in such notable films as Shai Carmeli Pollac’s Bil’in, My Love and Guy Davidi’s and Alesandre Goetschmann Interrupted Streams.&lt;ref name="Official Website"/&gt;

===Pre-Production and Guy Davidi===
Burnat was approached in 2009 by Greenhouse, a Mediterranean film development project, to develop a documentary. The project focused on the non-violent movement and especially on Bassem Abu-Rahme, who was killed earlier that year at a demonstration in Bil’in. After some difficulties, Burnat approached Israeli filmmaker, Guy Davidi who had just finished editing “Interrupted Streams”, Davidi’s first feature documentary which was released in 2010 at the Jerusalem International Film Festival.

Earlier, Davidi had been involved in the left-wing organizations Indymedia and Anarchists Against the Wall.&lt;ref name=mag&gt;{{cite web| last =Goldman| first =Lisa| title ='5 Broken Cameras' director: There is no room for guilt - only taking responsibility| work =972 Magazine| date =Feb 24, 2013| url =http://972mag.com/director-of-5-broken-cameras-there-is-no-room-for-guilt-only-taking-responsibility/66642/}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Until my twenties,” Davidi has said in an interview, “it was very hard for me to work in Israel. I felt it was a very destructive environment, a very violent environment.... There is a lot of aggression expressed towards the arts in Israel. I connect it completely with the political situation....So I left for Paris and I found time to reflect on my life.... I kind of found a freedom in Paris and I wanted to express it as well in Israel. And ever since my life was connected with the West Bank.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Robbins| first =Jonathan| title =Interview With Guy Davidi, "5 Broken Cameras"| work =Film Society Lincoln Center| date =May 30, 2012| url =http://www.filmlinc.com/blog/entry/interview-with-guy-davidi-5-broken-cameras}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davidi provided Burnat's film with a new concept: Burnat himself, the cameraman, would be the protagonist, and the story would be told from his point of view. Davidi also proposed that the film be structured around the history of the destruction of Burnat's cameras. Footage that Burnat shot of his family was also incorporated into the film, thus enhancing the personal element.

Beginning in 2009, Burnat, adhering to the new concept for the film, focused more extensively on his family's reactions to events. A few important scenes shot by other cameramen (including Guy Davidi) were used to supplement the narrative, and to introduce Burnat as a character.&lt;ref name="Official Website"/&gt;

===Editing===
Starting in 2009, Davidi worked on the voice-overs and structuring the film. In 2011 French editor Véronique Lagoarde–Ségot joined the project to edit the final cut of the 90-minute film and to create the 52-minute television version. The film takes the form of a diary, and is divided into 5 sections, each of which recounts the story of one of the five cameras that Burnat used over the years.

In a prologue, Burnat is shown with his 5 broken cameras laid out on a table. This scene is returned to at the end of the film. Title cards identifying the time periods during which each camera was used are shown at the start of each episode as well as the epilogue. The story shifts frequently between the dramatic public events in the village and the highly intimate scenes involving Burnat's family.

The most prominent narrative is of Burnat's fourth son Gibreel, whose growth throughout almost 6 years is documented in the film. The birth of Gibreel occurs at the same time as the birth of the non-violent movement in the village; later in the film, Gibreel’s first words are “wall” and “cartridge,” uttered when he crosses the barrier with his brothers and finally writes his name on the second concrete wall at the end of the film.

Beginning with the episode involving the third camera, the personal and village movement narratives grow more integrated. Burnat becomes more conspicuous as a protagonist. First he is placed under house arrest and films himself, then he is filmed at the moment a bullet directly hits his third camera.&lt;ref name="Official Website"/&gt;

===Funding===
The film was initially developed by the [[Greenhouse Development Project]], a Mediterranean development project initiated by an Israeli foundation and sponsored by the European Union. Later it received funding from international and Israeli sources such as the New Israeli Cinema Fund (Israel), the Jan Vrijman Fund (Netherland), ITVS (USA). Still later, funding was provided by Israel's Channel 8, Dutch Television IKON, and sources in Canada, South Korea, and the UK. Ultimately French television and the CNC French Cinema Fund provided help. It was pitched at the 2010 [[Sheffield Doc/Fest]] MeetMarket.

==Reception==
''5 Broken Cameras'' has received positive reviews from numerous critics. It has a fresh rating of 95%, based on 39 reviews at [[Rottentomatoes.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{rottentomatoes|5_broken_cameras_2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[A.O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' while stating that the film was “unlikely to persuade anyone with a hardened view of the issue to think again” and was a “hardly neutral...piece of advocacy journalism,” also said that it was  a "visual essay in autobiography and, as such, a modest, rigorous and moving work of art" that deserved "to be appreciated for the lyrical delicacy of [Burnat's] voice and the precision of his eye."&lt;ref name="NYT Critics' Pick"&gt;{{cite news |last=Scott |first=A.O. |authorlink=A.O. Scott |title=A Palestinian Whose Cameras Are Witnesses and Casualties of Conflict ‘5 Broken Cameras’ Shows Life in One Palestinian Village |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/movies/5-broken-cameras-shows-life-in-one-palestinian-village.html |accessdate=February 22, 2013 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Artinfo]]'' magazine's [[J. Hoberman]] noted that the documentary was "gripping from the get go" and that seeing it is to "wonder what it would have been like to have a black Alabaman’s 8mm documentation of the civil rights struggle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hoberman |first=J. |authorlink=J.

===Reception in Israel===
The film was released in Israel in July 2012 and immediately won the Best Documentary Award at the [[Jerusalem Film Festival]], where it competed against another Oscar-nominated film, "[[The Gatekeepers (film)|The Gatekeepers]]." The film also received an award named after the slain Palestinian-Israeli filmmaker [[Juliano Mer Khamis]], at the Cinema South Film Festival in Sderot. In Israel, 5 Broken Cameras received overwhelming positive reviews, with Timeout Israel calling it “a masterpiece” and Israeli film critic Shmulik Duvdevani naming it "the most important cinematic event of the year." Even Israel’s most popular right-wing newspaper, Israel Hayom, called the film "the best documentary of the year" (2012). Both directors, Guy Davidi and Emat Burnat, also appeared on the cover of the cultural weekend section of Israel’s leading newspaper, Yediot Achronot. In 2013 the film was nominated for the Israeli Film Academy's award ([[Ophir Award]]) for Best Documentary.

There was also considerable negative response to the film in Israel, however. Davidi said that when he first screened the film for Israeli high school students, “they got angry at me, accused me of lying and being a traitor. But the anger is really against the whole system that lied to them....So I tell the kids, ‘Go ahead and get mad at me. Take it all out on me. Soon you will realize that your anger is not against me, but against the whole system that lied to you.’”&lt;ref name=mag/&gt; According to the AP, the film “has infuriated people on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian divide,” with some Israelis “asking why the government helped fund a film so scathing in its criticism of its own policies, while Palestinians are shocked that the film is winning accolades for being 'Israeli.'”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title ='5 Broken Cameras' angers both sides| work =SF Gate| date =Feb 13, 2013| url =http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/5-Broken-Cameras-angers-both-sides-4276621.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli nonprofit Consensus petitioned the Israeli Attorney General claiming that Davidi and Burnat “should be charged with slander and prosecuted for 'incitement.'”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Shea| first =Danny| title =Guy Davidi, '5 Broken Cameras' Co-Director, Responds To Slander Claims: 'Disturbing' (VIDEO) | work =Huffington Post| date =Mar 14, 2013| url =http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/14/guy-davidi-5-broken-camer_n_2877779.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reaction to the Oscar Nomination in Israel===
When the film was nominated for an Oscar, the Israeli media referred to it as an Israeli film that would be representing Israel at the Academy Awards, even though the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences does not consider films nominated in the documentary category as representing their countries of origin. In addition, the fact that the film was also a Palestinian work often went unmentioned. Davidi sparked controversy and was criticized by Israeli officials when he stated in an interview that “he does not represent Israel, only himself.”

There was considerable controversy over whether the film should be identified as an Israeli or Palestinian production. Burnat described it as a “Palestinian film” while Davidi said it was “first and foremost...a Palestinian film,”although technically it was a “Palestinian-Israeli-French production since there is finance from these countries,” although he added: “I don’t think films should have citizenships.”&lt;ref name=elect&gt;{{cite web| last =Winstanley| first =Asa| title =Is Oscar-nominated 5 Broken Cameras an Israeli or a Palestinian film?| work =Electronic Intifada| date =Jan 11, 2013| url =http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/asa-winstanley/oscar-nominated-5-broken-cameras-israeli-or-palestinian-film}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Issue of collaboration===
Burnat was widely criticized in Ramallah for working with Israelis, and Davidi was made to feel that “I had not sufficiently proved myself. I thought to myself that maybe we needed an Israeli activist to die in order to win credibility. Perhaps not enough Israeli blood has been spilled.”&lt;ref name=mag/&gt;

[[Norman Finkelstein]] attacked the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement for “flagrant hypocrisy” for not calling for a boycott of 5 Broken Cameras.&lt;ref name=elect/&gt;

'''Age of candidacy''' is the minimum age at which a person can legally qualify to hold certain elected government offices. In many cases, it also determines the age at which a person may be [[nomination rules|eligible to stand]] for an election or be granted [[ballot access]].

The first known example of a law enforcing age of candidacy was the ''[[Lex Villia Annalis]]'', a Roman law enacted in 180 BCE which set the minimum ages for senatorial [[Roman Magistrates|magistrates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Magistrates of the Roman Republic|first=Thomas|last=Broughton|author2=Marcia Patterson|publisher=American Philological Association|year=1951|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jenness for President pin.jpg|thumb|right|In 1972, [[Linda Jenness]] ran for President of the United States, although she was only 31 at the time.]]
Many [[youth rights]] groups view current age of candidacy requirements as unjustified [[Ageism|age discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BYC Youth Manifesto |publisher=British Youth Council |year=2008 |url=http://www.byc.org.uk/asset_store/documents/amd5a_youth_manifesto_(annual_meeting_version).pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-07-28 |quote=Young people believe that the age to stand as candidates for local, regional, national and European elections should be 16, as should the age to become a trustee of a charity. Young people have significant responsibilities to society at the age of 16 and can have significant responsibilities in the private sector as company directors; this inconsistency should be rectified. Young people have lots to offer and the decision of their appointment to positions of political authority or governance of organisations should be in the hands of the electorate or membership respectfully. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306185939/http://www.byc.org.uk/asset_store/documents/amd5a_youth_manifesto_%28annual_meeting_version%29.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally people who are younger than the minimum age will run for an office in protest of the requirement or because they don't know that the requirement exists. On extremely rare occasions, young people have been elected to offices they do not qualify for and have been deemed ineligible to assume the office.

In 1934, [[Rush D. Holt, Sr.|Rush Holt]] of West Virginia was elected to the [[Senate of the United States]] at the age of 29. Since the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] requires senators to be at least 30, Holt was forced to wait until his 30th birthday, six months after the start of the session, before being sworn in.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,930751,00.html Unsworn Senators]". ''Time Magazine'' (January 14, 1935).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, [[Richard Fulton]] won election to the [[Tennessee Senate]]. Shortly after being sworn in, Fulton was ousted from office because he was only 27 years old at the time. The [[Tennessee State Constitution]] required that senators be at least 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dick|last=Battle|author2=Tom Flake|title=Senate Vote Ousts Fulton|work=Nashville Banner|date=January 5, 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than hold a new election, the previous incumbent, [[Clifford Allen]], was allowed to resume his office for another term. Fulton went on to win the next State Senate election in 1956 and was later elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|US House of Representatives]] where he served for 10 years.

In South Carolina, two Senators aged 24 were elected, but were too young according to the State Constitution: Mike Laughlin in 1969 and [[William Jennings Bryan Dorn|Bryan Dorn]] (later a US Congressman) in 1941. They were seated anyway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Brian |first=Jack |title=Senate To Have Ineligible Man |newspaper=Spartanburg Herald |location=Spartanburg, SC |date=11 January 1969 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19690111&amp;id=lHssAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zswEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5135,1580539 |accessdate=15 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On several occasions, the [[Socialist Workers Party (USA)]] has nominated candidates too young to qualify for the offices they were running for. In 1972, [[Linda Jenness]] ran as the SWP presidential candidate, although she was only 31 at the time. Since the U.S. Constitution requires that the President and Vice President be at least 35 years old, Jenness was not able to receive [[ballot access]] in several states in which she otherwise qualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jo|last=Freeman|title=We Will Be Heard: Women's Struggles for Political Power in the United States|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2008|quote=Only 31, Linda Jenness did not meet the Constitutional age requirement to hold the office of President, but the SWP was on the ballot in 25 states — six more than in 1968.|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this handicap, Jenness still received 83,380 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1972 Presidential General Election Results|work=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1972&amp;minper=0|accessdate=2008-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the SWP nominated [[Arrin Hawkins]] as the party's vice-presidential candidate, although she was only 28 at the time. Hawkins was also unable to receive ballot access in several states due to her age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presidency 2004 |url=http://www.politics1.com/swp04.htm |work=Politics1.com |accessdate=2007-10-16 |quote=Since they weren't going to be elected anyways, the Socialist Workers Party didn't care that they nominated a ticket entirely ineligible to be elected. Why? Because Róger Calero is both foreign born and also not a US citizen; and Arrin Hawkins is too young. To avoid [[ballot access]] problems for the SWP, as the constitutional ineligibility may also render them unable to be listed on the ballot in some states, the 2000 SWP ticket of James Harris for President and Margaret Trowe for Vice President are being used in states that will not permit the Calero-Hawkins slate to be listed. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730141140/http://www.politics1.com/swp04.htm |archivedate=2007-07-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reform efforts==

In the United States, many groups have attempted to lower age of candidacy requirements in various states. In 1994, [[South Dakota]] voters rejected a ballot measure that would have lowered the age requirements to serve as a State Senator or State Representative from 30 to 18. In 1998, however, they approved a similar ballot measure that reduced the age requirements for those offices from 25 to 21. In 2002, [[Oregon]] voters rejected a ballot measure that would have reduced the age requirement to serve as a State Representative from 21 to 18.

During the early 2000s, the [[British Youth Council]] and other groups successfully campaigned to lower age of candidacy requirements in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="byc"&gt;{{cite press release|title=How old is old enough? |publisher=British Youth Council |date=October 2003 |url=http://www.byc.org.uk/downloads/Campaigns/HowOldIsOldEnough.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-07-16 |quote=BYC believes that at the age of 18 a person may hold elected office.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5102">'''Arnaut Osman''' is a hero of [[Serbian epic poetry|Serbian]] and [[Albanian epic poetry]]. He is also a hero of the epic poetry of [[Bosniaks]]. The Serbo-Croatian language songs about Arnaut Osman include ''Young Marjan and Arnaut Osman'', ''Sekula and Arnaut Osman'' and ''Mujo Hrnjica kills Simun Brehulja''. Albanian language songs about Arnaut Osman include ''Sirotan Alia and Arnaut Osman''. The name of this here consists of personal name [[Osman (name)|Osman]] and ethnonym [[Arnaut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zbornik Matice srpske za filologiju i lingvistiku|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6S9ZAAAAMAAJ|year=1994|publisher=Matica|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epic poetry on Serbo-Croatian language ==
The song ''Young Marjan and Arnaut Osman'' ({{lang-sr|Млади Марјан и Арнаут-Осман}}) was recorded by [[Vuk Karadžić]] (Narodne srpske pjesme III, Lajpcig, 1823), based on the singing of Anđelko Vuković from [[Kosovo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Folklor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=enksAAAAMAAJ|year=1973|publisher=Nauchno delo|page=63|quote=Од Ангелка ВуковиКа са Косова, из села Ораовца у околини Вучитрна, Вук КарациК je забележио песме: Млади MapjaH и Арнаут Осман...}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from whose singing Vuk recorded totally four songs).&lt;ref name="GesemannBekić2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerhard Gesemann|author2=Tomislav Bekić|title=Studije o južnoslovenskoj narodnoj epici|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EMJiAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 February 2013|year=2002|publisher=Zavod za udžbenike i nastavna sredstva|isbn=978-86-17-09804-7|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main motif of this song is brotherhood and conciliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Folklor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=enksAAAAMAAJ|year=1973|publisher=Nauchno delo|page=63|quote=... (у KOJOJ доминира мотив помирен&gt;а и братишьен&gt;а). }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another song recorded by Vuk Karadžić (also in 1823) is titled ''Sekula and Arnaut Osman''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nastavni vjesnik|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ca0pAQAAMAAJ|year=1924|publisher=Društvo hrvatskih srednjoškolskih profesora.|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song ''Mujo Hrnjica kills Simun Brehulja'' ({{lang-bs|Mujo Hrnjica pogubi Simuna Brehulju}}) is evidence that Arnaut Osman was one of famous bayraktars in the epic poetry of [[Bosniaks]].&lt;ref name="Kongres1967"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kongres|first=Savez udruženja folklorista Jugoslavije.|title=Rad ... Kongresa Saveza folklorista Jugoslavije|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uiTaAAAAMAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Savez folklorista Jugoslavie}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this song, Christian hero Siun Brehulja inflicted deadly wounds to Arnaut Osman and killed cheteniks under his command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rad kongresa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vAqBAAAAMAAJ|year=1982|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some singers of this song referred to Osman as Captain Osman instead of Arnaut Osman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bulletin du Museé de la République Socialiste de Bosnie-Hercegovine à Sarajevo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ldQzAQAAIAAJ|year=1973|publisher=Zemaljski muzej Bosne i Hercegovine u Sarajevu|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some variants of this song are titled ''Mujo Hrnjica Liberates His Blood-Brother Arnaut Osman''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wissenschaftliche Mitteilungen des Bosnisch-Herzegowinischen Landesmuseums: Volkskunde|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZhokAQAAIAAJ|year=1980|publisher=Bosnisch-Herzegowinisches Landesmuseum.|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnaut Osman is one of the heroes of the novel written by [[Đura Jakšić]].&lt;ref name="Popović1961"&gt;{{cite book|last=Popović|first=Miodrag|title=Dura Jakšić|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_BAB_1IZwIIC|year=1961|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epic poetry on Albanian language ==
Arnaut Osman is also a hero of the Albanian epic poetry. He is one of main characters in the song ''Sirotan Alia and Arnaut Osman'' ({{lang-sq|Siran Tin Alia dhe Arnaut Osmani}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gjurmime albanologjike: Seria e shkencave filologjike|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqtiAAAAMAAJ|year=1986|publisher=Instituti|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albanian epic poetry had almost identic song to song about Mali Radojica, although the name of the hero is not Mali Radojica but Arnaut Osman.&lt;ref&gt;Radosav Medenica, Belgrade, [http://www.rastko.rs/rastko-al/umetnost/rmedenica-kresnicke.php Арбанашке крешничке песме и наша народна епика [Albanian borderland songs and our epic poetry&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;], Извор: зборник "Рад XIV конгреса Савеза фолклориста Југославије (у Призрену 1967)", Београд 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Azerbaijanis in Georgia''' or '''Georgian Azerbaijanis''' ({{lang-az|Gürcüstan azərbaycanlıları}}, {{lang-ka|აზერბაიჯანელები საქართველოში}}) are [[Azerbaijani people]] in [[Georgia (Country)|Georgia]], and are [[Georgia (Country)|Georgian]] citizens and permanent residents of ethnic Azerbaijani background. According to the 2002 census, there are 284,761 ethnic Azerbaijanis living in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistics.ge/main.php?pform=14&amp;plang=1 ''State Statistics Department of Georgia: 2002 census] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831230321/http://www.statistics.ge/main.php?pform=14&amp;plang=1 |date=August 31, 2006 }}'' (retrieved 16 July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijanis comprise 6.5% of Georgia's population and are the country's largest ethnic minority, inhabiting mostly rural areas like [[Kvemo Kartli]], [[Kakheti]], [[Shida Kartli]] and [[Mtskheta-Mtianeti]], a region broadly referred to as [[Borchali]]. There is also a historical Azerbaijani community in the capital city of [[Tbilisi]] (previously known as Tiflis) and smaller communities in other regions.&lt;ref name="2002 census"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethnic Groups by Major Administrative-territorial Units|url=http://www.geostat.ge/cms/site_images/_files/english/census/2002/03%20Ethnic%20Composition.pdf|publisher=National Statistics Office of Georgia|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were some tensions in the late 1980s in the Azerbaijani-populated regions of Georgia; however, they never escalated to armed clashes.&lt;ref name=cornell&gt;Cornell, Svante E., [http://www.silkroadstudies.org/new/inside/publications/0419dissertation.pdf ''Autonomy and Conflict: Ethnoterritoriality and Separatism in the South Caucasus – Case in Georgia''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630141309/http://www.silkroadstudies.org/new/inside/publications/0419dissertation.pdf |date=2007-06-30 }}.

==History==
{{Azerbaijanis}}
[[Image:Tiflis, Tatar square and bazaar (A).jpg|thumb|200px|left|Azerbaijani quarter of Tbilisi, 1870]]
Historically, Azeris in Georgia have succeeded in preserving their ethnic identity and have not been touched by ethnic and/or linguistic assimilation processes observed among many other ethnic communities in the country. Natalia Volkova explained this by the large size of the community and its tendency to being restricted to a specific geographical area. The other reason was that unlike most of their neighbours, Azeris historically adhered to [[Islam]], which weakened possibilities of [[interfaith marriage|intermarriage]] or any other type of close contact with people of other faiths. Finally, the fact that the [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri language]] for a long time enjoyed the status of the language of interethnic communication (see ''Language'') reduced the need of knowing languages of the neighbours, preventing eventual language shift. Volkova noted that as of 1976, cases of assimilation of Azeris even in the smallest communities were unheard of.&lt;ref name="volkova"&gt;Natalia Volkova. "Ethnic Processes in the Georgian SSR"; p. 17. In: Gardanov, Valentin (ed.). ''Ethnic and Cultural-Domestic Processes in the Caucasus''. Moscow: Nauka, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
Georgia's Azerbaijani population traces its roots to the events following the [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] invasion in the second half of the eleventh century, when [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]] tribes settled in southern Georgia. To oppose being subjected to the Seljuk Empire, Georgians allied with the [[Cumans]] (a group of [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] tribes to the north of the [[Caucasus]]) thus allowing for more Turkic migration into the region. In the 1480s, groups of Azeris originally from [[Qazakh]], [[Pambak, Lori|Pambak]] and Shuragel further settled along the banks of the rivers [[Aghstafa River|Aghstafa]] and [[Debed]].&lt;ref name="institute"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.az/pdf.php?item_id=20100816020426434&amp;ext=pdf|title=Кавказский этнографический сборник |publisher=www.history.az|author=Институт этнологии и антропологии им.

By the beginning of the seventeenth century, they spread eastward into fertile lands of Karaiazi (modern-day [[Gardabani Municipality]]) and in the west, they reached [[Shaumiani|Shulaveri]] and the Dmanisi Gorge.&lt;ref name="bregadze"&gt;Bregadze, N.

The Don and the North Caucasus in the 4th–12th centuries&lt;/ref&gt; The area in turn gave its name to the Sultanate of Borchali that existed there from 1604 to 1755 with its capital in [[Aghjakala|Aghjagala]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KcxSAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151 "Aghjagala"].

Тбилиси, 1965]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, up to 15,000 Turkic-speaking families had been resettled in [[Kakheti]] at the beginning of the seventeenth century by [[Abbas I of Persia]] following a series of punitive campaigns he had launched against his Georgian subject, [[Teimuraz I of Kakheti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gatchina3000.ru/big/049/49932_brockhaus-efron.htm|title=Кахетия

===Imperial Russian rule===
[[Image:1900TBSBazaarRugealer.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Muslim merchants selling rugs in Tiflis, ca. 1900]]
After Russia conquered the [[South Caucasus]] and [[Dagestan]] from [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Iran]] following the [[Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)]], the [[Russo-Persian War (1826-1828)]] and the out-coming treaties of [[Treaty of Gulistan|Gulistan]] and [[Treaty of Turkmenchay|Turkmenchay]],&lt;ref&gt;Allen F. Chew. "An Atlas of Russian History: Eleven Centuries of Changing Borders". Yale University Press, 1967. pp 74.&lt;/ref&gt; the government reorganised the Kingdom of Georgia into a [[Georgia Governorate|governorate]], with subdivisions of its own, five of which were referred to as the Tatar ranges (the Czarist nomenclature used the word "Tatar" for Azeri), namely Borchali, Pambak, Shuragel, Kazakh, and Shamshadin.&lt;ref&gt;G. Galoyan. ''Russia and the People of Transcaucasia''. Mysl, 1976; p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868, the latter two became part of the [[Elisabethpol Governorate]], while the former three were incorporated into the [[Tiflis Governorate]] as the Borchali uyezd. The plains of the uyezd were mainly Azeri-populated: out of 63 villages in the Borchali Plain covering 390 square versts (equal to 444 square kilometres) of land, 61 were populated with Azeris.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hGQdAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA45 Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopaedia]: "Borchali Plain". V. 7, p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tiflis, Azeris have historically populated the neighbourhood of Ortachala (from [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]] ''orta'', meaning "central, middle", and [[Georgian language|Georgian]] ჭალა (''ch'ala''), meaning "green coastal area"), also known as Maidan ({{lang-az|Meydan}}, meaning "square") or Sheitanbazar ({{lang-az|Şeytanbazar}}, meaning "Devil's market"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://diversity.ge/rus/resources.php?coi=0%7C13%7C14%7C12 Azeris]. Diversity.ge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="divhc"&gt;[http://www.diversity.ge/rus/resources.php?coi=0|13|14|12 Diversity.ge - History and Culture - Azeris].&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Seidabad ({{lang-az|Seyidabad}}; "city of [[sayyid]]s"), the old baths district.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Ostrovsky. ''Who Stood Behind Stalin?'' Olma Media Group, 2002; p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1905, Tiflis almost became an arena of [[Armenian–Tatar massacres of 1905–1907|Armenian–Azeri ethnic clashes]], which had already affected and caused violent conflicts and massacres in the rest of the South Caucasus. The Armenian population of the city at the time was 50,000, putting the 1,000 Azeris in a dangerous situation. Militia units of the Armenian nationalist [[Dashnaktsutiun]] party seized control of key positions. The Azeris were assisted by 2,000 mounted volunteers from Borchali. By three o'clock in the afternoon on 27 November there were already 22 killed and wounded.&lt;ref&gt;''The Tiflis Leaflet''. 27 November 1905.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, social democrat labourer activists organised a peaceful rally, calling on both parties not to engage in a conflict, and managed to acquire arms from the [[Caucasus Viceroyalty (1844-1881)|Viceroyalty of the Caucasus]] in order to patrol the streets. Following mediation, both sides came to a peaceful agreement on 1 December 1905, and the Borchalians left the city.&lt;ref&gt;''Novoe Obozrenie'', 28 November 1905.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, during Georgia's [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|brief independence]], 34-year-old Parikhanim Sofiyeva, an Azeri woman from the village of Karajalari near [[Gardabani|Karaiazi]], won the parliament election in her constituency, becoming the first democratically elected Muslim woman in the history of the Caucasus and one of only five Georgian female MPs at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{ka icon}} [http://archive.ge/ka/blog/9 Matriarch of Karaiazi - Parikhanim Sofiyeva].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet rule===
Under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule, Azeris constituted the third largest ethnic minority in the country (after Armenians and Russians), but their numbers grew constantly due to a high [[birth rate]], almost twice as high as for ethnic Georgians as of 1989,&lt;ref name="diversity"&gt;Mamuka Komakhia. [http://diversity.ge/rus/resources.php?coi=0%7C13%7C13 Ethnic Minorities in Georgia]. ''Diversity.ge''.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a low rate of immigration. Due to this, the numbers of Azeris rose to make them Georgia's largest minority ethnic group by 2002.

In March 1944, 3,240 ethnic Azeris and [[Kurds in Georgia|Kurds]] living in the capital city of Tbilisi were forcibly relocated to rural parts of Kvemo Kartli, as persons "deliberately avoiding working in the agricultural sector".&lt;ref name="polyan"&gt;Pavel Polyan. [http://www.memo.ru/history/deport/polyan2.htm Not Voluntarily: History and Geography of Forced Relocations in the USSR]. Memorial.&lt;/ref&gt; Only 31 Azeri families were permitted to stay in Tbilisi, mostly military personnel, handicapped war veterans and university students.&lt;ref name="Скепсис"&gt;{{cite news | title=Депортация народов|publisher=Научно-просветительский журнал «Скепсис»| url=http://scepsis.ru/library/id_1237.html|author=Nikolai Bugai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, in the midst of the [[population transfer in the Soviet Union]], a decree was issued by the [[Moscow]]-seated government, according to which tens of thousands of residents of the southern border regions of Georgia were to be forcibly relocated to [[Central Asia]] for national security reasons. The decree made provision for the relocation of [[Meskhetian Turks]], Kurds, [[Hamshenis|Hamsheni Armenians]] and "others", though the latter category underlyingly referred to Azeris living in [[Samtskhe-Javakheti]] and [[Adjara|Ajara]]. Georgian [[NKVD]] officers made no distinction between the Azeris and the key deportation target groups, as together with Kurds and Hamsheni Armenians, they were seen as "Turkish-oriented".&lt;ref name="zemskov"&gt;Viktor Zemskov. ''Special Settlers in the USSR in 1930–1960''. Moscow: Nauka, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, it was revealed that out of almost 100,000 deportees, 24,304 were Azeris.&lt;ref name="polyan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zemskov"/&gt;

Azeris living in rural parts of the country were mainly engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry in [[kolkhoz]]es and [[sovkhoz]]es, as well as small-scale trade and industry. Farmer unions were assigned relatively small units of land, which, however, gave more output than most state-owned lands elsewhere in Georgia.&lt;ref name="trier"&gt;Tom Trier &amp; Medea Turashvili.

ECMI Monograph #6. August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Factors such as fertile land, proximity of the capital city and easy access to major Soviet markets allowed Azeri farmers to enjoy relatively prosperous lives, according to Soviet standards.&lt;ref name="cipdd"&gt;[http://pdc.ceu.hu/archive/00003218/01/potential_for_conflict.pdf Potential for Conflict Related to Land Problems in Georgia's Marneuli and Gardabani Districts].

===Gamsakhurdia's presidency===
During Georgia's movement toward independence from the Soviet Union, the Azeri population expressed fear for its fate in independent Georgia. In the late 1980s, most ethnic Azeris occupying local government positions in the Azeri-populated areas were removed from their positions.&lt;ref name="borch"&gt;{{cite news | script-title=ru:Интеграция национальных меньшинств в регионах Грузии Самцхе-Джавахети и Квемо Картли| author=Jonathan Wheatley|publisher=European Centre for Minorities| url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:BBG74kd64TgJ:www.ecmi.de/download/working_paper_44_rus.pdf+%D0%98%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F+%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D1%85+%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8C%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2+%D0%B2+%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%85+%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%BC%D1%86%D1%85%D0%B5-%D0%94%D0%B6%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%85%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B8+%D0%B8+%D0%9A%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%BE+%D0%9A%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%BB%D0%B8+2009&amp;hl=az&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESh1hPuEOMWy5X-oNkYMYIhDbWbp-ul1v5DVkq8nBGH8ovDhqwf-3bMQkemqZgcKN11J_TcCJJUrB68RuI9PCTclFpvZ5kCCQZwfMYbxraS84fIueqRPe09MvCkGpp-UGXqJZB2L&amp;sig=AHIEtbTvCxOo6X9bFRu2KwSdGhMjpacalQ| date=September 2009| language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, there were changes in the ethnic composition of the local authorities and the resettlement of thousands of eco-migrants who had suffered from landslides in the mountainous region of [[Svaneti]]. The local Azeri population, accepting of the migrants at first, demanded only to resolve the problem of Azeri representation on the municipal level. The demands were ignored; later the eco-migrants, culturally different from the local population and facing social hardships, were accused of attacks and robbery against the Azeris,&lt;ref name="trier"/&gt; which in turn led to demonstrations, ethnic clashes between [[Svans]] and Azeris, demands for an Azeri autonomy in Borchali and for the expulsion of Svan immigrants from Kvemo-Kartli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Ethnic Minorities in Eastern and Southern Georgia | author=Alexander Kukhinadze |publisher=Memorial| url=http://www.memo.ru/hr/referats/selfdet/Chapter16.htm| language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="minorities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/europe/178_georgia_s_armenian_and_azeri_minorities_rus.ashx |title=Georgia's Armenian and Azeri minorities |publisher=Report 178 Europe |date=22 November 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61CUZJpLe?url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/europe/178_georgia_s_armenian_and_azeri_minorities_rus.ashx |archivedate=2011-08-25 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The antagonism reached its peak during the presidency of Zviad Gamsakhurdia (1991–1992), when hundreds of Azeri families were forcibly evicted from their homes in Dmanisi and Bolnisi by [[Mkhedrioni|nationalist paramilitaries]] and fled to Azerbaijan. Thousands of Azeris emigrated in fear of nationalist policies.&lt;ref name="minorities"/&gt; In his speech in [[Kvareli]], Gamsakhurdia accused the Azeri population of Kakheti of "holding up their heads and measuring swords with Kakheti".&lt;ref name="mark"&gt;{{ru icon}} [[Sergey Markedonov]] [http://www.ipma.ru/publikazii/etnosotn/1008.php The Land and Will of Zviad Gamsakhurdia] // Institute of Political and Military Analysis. 4 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Georgian nationalist press expressed concern with regard to the fast natural growth of the Azeri population.&lt;ref name="diversity"/&gt;

Although ethnic oppression in the 1990s did not take place on a wide scale, minorities in Georgia, especially Azeris and [[Ossetians]], encountered the problem of dealing with nationalist organisations established in some parts of the country. Previously not prone to migrating, Azeris became the second largest emigrating ethnic community in Georgia in the early 1990s, with three-quarters of these mainly rural emigrants leaving for Azerbaijan and the rest for Russia. Unlike other minority groups, many remaining Azeris cited attachment to their home communities and unwillingness to leave behind well-developed farms as their reason to stay.&lt;ref name="diversity"/&gt; Furthermore, Georgian-born Azeris who immigrated to Azerbaijan at various times, including 50,000 Georgian-born spouses of Azerbaijani citizens, reported bureaucratic problems faced in Azerbaijan, with some unable to acquire Azerbaijani citizenship for nearly 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Ulviyya Akhundova.

===Shevardnadze's presidency===
After the overthrow of Gamsakhurdia, the new president [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] refused to pursue nationalist policies, and his good relationship with his former fellow [[Politburo]] member [[Heydar Aliyev]], then president of Azerbaijan, ensured safety for Georgia's Azeri community.&lt;ref name="diversity"/&gt; However, Jonathan Wheatley characterises Shevardnadze's policy towards Kvemo-Kartli as "benign neglect", pursued through "patron-client linkages" and weak efforts to integrate ethnic minorities with the rest of the country.&lt;ref name="obstacles"/&gt;

In 1995, Shevardnadze appointed Levan Mamaladze governor of the province of Kvemo-Kartli, even though the governor's duties were never clearly outlined in the legislature at the time. Mamaladze reportedly used his power to secure ethnic Azeri votes for Shevardnadze and his political party and tolerated corruption in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Defusing Conflict in Tsalka District of Georgia| author=Jonathan Wheatley|publisher=European Centre for Minorities| url=http://www.ecmicaucasus.org/upload/publications/working_paper_36_rus.pdf | date=December 2006| language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jonathan Wheatley, it was on Mamalalze's recommendation that six Azeris became Members of Parliament in the [[Georgian parliamentary election, 1999|1999 election]] and later joined the Alliance for a New Georgia that he had helped form. At the same time, members of the local government were dominated by ethnic Georgians appointed by him, including heads of all majority-Azeri municipalities.&lt;ref name="obstacles"&gt;Jonathan Wheatley. ''Obstacles Impeding the Regional Integration of the Kvemo Kartli Region of Georgia''. European Centre for Minority Issues Working Paper #23. February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2003 interview, then Prime Minister and future President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] criticised Mamaladze for carrying out a smearing campaign against opposition parties and soliciting Azeri votes by spreading rumours that the new government would organise mass deportations of Georgia's Azeri population.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elmar Huseynov]]. [http://www.monitorjournal.com/arxiv/heftelik-39-saak.htm Fox Hunter] (interview with Mikheil Saakashvili. ''Monitor''. 22 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Mamaladze left the country soon after Shevardnadze's resignation in November 2003.&lt;ref name="obstacles"/&gt;

===After the Rose Revolution===
Mikheil Saakashvili's government, which came in power after the 2003 [[Rose Revolution]], took steps towards integrating the country's minorities by attempting to enhance the educational system (see ''Education'').&lt;ref name="sjones"&gt;Stephen Jones. [https://books.google.com/books?id=xfXbAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53 War and Revolution in the Caucasus: Georgia Ablaze]. Routledge, 2013; {{ISBN|1317987632}}; pp. 53–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new government's efforts to build a professional army changed the military conscription practices and instead allowed many young Azeris and Armenians from impoverished regions (at least before the [[Russo-Georgian War]] of 2008) to be offered real employment opportunities by the Georgian army instead of being dragooned into mandatory military service.&lt;ref name="sjones"/&gt;

As part of his anti-corruption reforms, in 2004, Saakashvili cracked down on [[contraband]] markets. This targeted the economic situation of many Azeris from the border regions who made a living through unencumbered trade with Azerbaijan and even led to protests against what was seen as "unfair punishment".&lt;ref name="sjones"/&gt;

In general, the majority-Azeri regions for the most part demonstrated satisfaction with the United National Movement (UNM), showing varying support for this party in the 2004, 2008 and 2012 elections. Stephen Jones explains this by the fact that minority-populated electoral districts in general showed more irregularities which may indicate that the support for the UNM may have actually been lower than reported. Another explanation, may be that, owing to the highly Soviet-like voting culture in this region, the voters did not want to be seen as disloyal or that they had come under the influence of local ethnic elites who have enough power to sway voting practices.&lt;ref name="sjones"/&gt;

==Present-day==

=== Social integration ===
[[File:Tbilisi Azeri Quarter.JPG|thumb|View on the Azerbaijani quarter, Tbilisi]]
Since Georgia regained its independence in 1991, in addition to nationwide problems such as [[unemployment]], many Azerbaijanis along with other minorities have faced [[social disintegration]] and underrepresentation in the country's legislative, executive and judicial powers, mainly due to the language barrier.&lt;ref name="minorities"/&gt; Emigration and the feeling of alienation decreased in comparison with the early 1990s: according to the 2008 UN Association of Georgia report, 98% of Azeris surveyed in Kvemo Kartli considered Georgia their homeland, 96% acknowledged that the problems they face are common to citizens countrywide and around 90% linked their futures with Georgia.&lt;ref name="una"/&gt; The percentage of mixed marriages remains one of the lowest in the country. Christian-Muslim intermarriage is much lower than Christian-Christian intermarriage between different ethnic groups: According to 2011 state statistics, there were only 2,229 families in Georgia where one spouse was Georgian and the other one Azeri (compared with 19,325 Georgian–Russian, 15,013 Georgian–Armenian, and 11,501 Georgian–Ossetian marriages).&lt;ref name="hwlg"&gt;Elene Medzmariashvili, Manana Shekiladze, et al.

===1992 land reform===
After the fall of the Communist regime, large areas of state-owned lands could not be maintained by the Georgian government any longer, and a need for their privatisation arose. Champions of the privatisation law believed that private farming would keep the agriculture developing further. However nationalists argued that privatisation of lands populated by ethnic minorities who lived in border regions may lead to [[irredentism|irredentist sentiment]]. In 1992, privatisation law was passed on certain conditions with regard to the border regions, such as the ban on owning land within 21 kilometres from the state border. Large areas of arable land in Gardabani and Marneuli were thus transferred to the control of the [[Ministry of Defense (Georgia)|Ministry of Defence]], and many families ended up owning only 1 to 1.5 hectares of land or less. Although after Mikheil Saakashvili's rise to power in 2004 the ban was lifted, local Azeris complained of unawareness of the changing laws as the main reason for dissatisfaction and expressed scepticism with regard to the situation improving.&lt;ref&gt;Potential for Conflict Related to Land Problems in Georgia’s Marneuli and Gardabani Districts, German Organization for Technical Cooperation, Caucasus Institute for Peace, Democracy and Development, Tbilisi-Marneuli-Gardabani, 2006, pp. 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, landowners from other parts of the country came to own and rent much of the land (70% according to Azeri non-governmental organisations)&lt;ref&gt;T.

===Renaming of placenames===
[[File:Bolnisi scenery.jpg|thumb|right|250px|View on the Azeri-populated village of Dzveli-Kveshi (Zol-Goyach) near Bolnisi]]
The Georgianisation of Georgia's toponymy has been a steady process since the 1930s. It affected placenames of Azeri origin, such as the renaming of Barmaksiz ({{lang-az|Barmaqsız}}) to [[Tsalka]] in 1932,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terra.su/full/056.html The Great Encyclopædia].

V. 6, p. 488, Tbilisi, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; all in 1947.

According to the Human Rights Monitoring Group of Ethnic Minorities, on the updated list of placenames of the [[Ministry of Justice (Georgia)|Ministry of Justice]] Public Registry, Azeri-sounding names of 30 more villages (18 in Marneuli and 12 in Tsalka) were changed to Georgian-sounding ones in 2010–2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ia-centr.ru/expert/10222/ How Georgian Government "Thanked" Azeris for Support].

===Georgia–Armenia border incidents===
The Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities received reports that ethnic Azeris living close to the [[Armenia]]n border often become victims of acts of violence, land and other property seizures and thefts of cattle. Local law enforcement agencies fail to respond adequately to these cases.&lt;ref name="acfcpnm"/&gt; In 2013, members of Azeri NGOs representing seven villages along the Georgia–Armenia border blamed these incidents on Armenian border guards who, according to them, have advanced 100–150 metres into the Georgian territory and are now in control of a local water reservoir that has been used by farmers for irrigation since 1948. They reportedly harass Azeris who try to use the reservoir or herd sheep in the nearby area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ru.apa.az/news/252261 Принято заявление в знак протеста против захвата армянскими пограничниками земель азербайджанцев в Грузии].

Azeri-populated areas of Georgia, mainly the districts of Marneuli, Bolnisi, Gardabani and Sagarejo, are famous for the production of [[Azerbaijani rug]]s of the Gazakh school of carpet-weaving, which also encompasses western Azerbaijan and northern Armenia. The rugs of this school are all wool, coarsely knotted in the symmetrical knot with a long, lustrous pile, and use strong red, blue, and ivory in bold combinations with relatively simple but dramatic designs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/313772/Kazakh-rug Britannica Encyclopedia. Kazakh-rugs.] &lt;blockquote&gt;Kazakh rug — floor covering woven by villagers living in western Azerbaijan and in a number of towns and villages in northern Armenia and the adjacent southern part of Georgia. The weavers are probably mostly Azerbaijanian Turks, although it is clear that both Armenians and Georgians have taken part in the production of these rugs. Kazakh rugs are all wool, coarsely knotted in the symmetrical knot with a long, lustrous pile, and use strong red, blue, and ivory in bold combinations with relatively simple but dramatic designs. The rugs seldom exceed about 1,7 × 2 metres (5.5 × 7 feet), and many of the smaller pieces are in prayer rug designs. Many show three medallions of approximately equal size, while another common format involves a central square enclosing geometric figures with two smaller squares at each end.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Tbilisi, or Tiflis, is known as one of the important centres for Azerbaijanis' cultural development.

On the other hand, Azeris living in almost [[Monoethnicity|monoethnic]] villages in Kvemo Kartli, who constitute the core of Georgia's Azeri population, largely speak little to no Georgian.&lt;ref name="una"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gogitidze"&gt;[http://bona-mente.az/rus/index.php?newsid=171 Nikoloz Gogitidze: We Are All from the Caucasus].&lt;/ref&gt; To Azeris in Georgia, secondary education is available in their native language, which is a remnant Soviet policy.&lt;ref name="una"/&gt; As of 2015, Azeri serves as the language of instruction in 120 schools&lt;ref&gt;[http://new.smr.gov.ge/Uploads/1_e7beda71.pdf Second Opinion on Georgia].

Retrieved 21 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; which is nevertheless more than the 1970 (6%)&lt;ref&gt;Volkova, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2002 (15%)&lt;ref name="geostat"&gt;[http://geostat.ge/cms/site_images/_files/georgian/census/2002/I%20tomi%20-%20saqarTvelos%20mosaxleobis%202002%20wlis%20pirveli%20erovnuli%20sayovelTao%20aRweris%20Sedegebi.pdf 2002 Census in Georgia: Population by Native Language].&lt;/ref&gt; figure. As of 2002, Russian was the most popular second language for Azeris, with 75,207 speakers (26%; up from 17% in 1970).&lt;ref&gt;Volkova, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, 934 Azeris indicated Georgian and 385 indicated Russian as their first language.&lt;ref name="geostat"/&gt;

Up until the early twentieth century, Azeri was the [[lingua franca|language of interethnic communication]] across most of the South Caucasus and the surrounding regions, including much of Georgia, with the exception of the Black Sea coastal regions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gxXtKAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Nasledie+Chingiskhana Nasledie Chingiskhana] by [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]]. Agraf, 1999; p. 478&lt;/ref&gt; This mainly had to do with the economic practices of the neighbouring (mainly male) population, such as seasonal work, distant pastoralism and trade. Up until the 1930s, large groups of ethnic [[Georgians|Georgian]], [[Armenians|Armenian]], [[Ossetians|Ossetian]] and [[Greeks|Greek]] male population of Tetritsqaro would regularly visit the mainly-Azeri populated region of Marneuli for seasonal work as railway workers, miners, guards and shepherds and used Azeri to communicate with the local population. In the nineteenth century, Georgians of [[Kakheti]] and [[Tusheti]], as well as [[Kist people|Kists]] from the [[Pankisi Gorge]] would herd their sheep down to the pastures in the Azeri-populated lowlands, where they would spend the winter, which also contributed to their knowledge of Azeri. Some Tush Georgians would give their children up for [[fosterage]] (a common practice among peoples of the Caucasus aimed at strengthening intercommunal relations) to Azeri families for the duration of their stay on the winter pastures.&lt;ref&gt;Volkova, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, tinsmiths and, less often, shepherds from [[Daghestan]] who visited Georgia around the same time would also use Azeri to communicate with the local population.&lt;ref&gt;Volkova, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, due to changing linguistic policies, universal schooling and abandonment of older practices, Azeri significantly lost positions to Georgian and Russian. Volkova noted that as of 1976, Azeri was still used as the language of trade between representatives of different ethnic groups in Tetritsqaro, Dmanisi and Marneuli.&lt;ref&gt;Volkova, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, 218 non-Azeris in Georgia indicated Azeri as their first language and 6,704 more claimed speaking it as a second language.&lt;ref name="geostat"/&gt; The Soviet census recorded [[Turkish language|Turkish-speaking]] [[Urums|Urum Greeks]] of central Georgia as speaking Azeri as a first language, in part due to the fact that their original dialect underwent influence from Azeri over the centuries and shifted towards the latter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geogen.ge/indexen.php?lang=en&amp;id_menu=22&amp;id_menu_up=4&amp;abc=0&amp;fr=&amp;srch= Azerbaijanis in Georgia]. Retrieved 2 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
The first European-style school in Georgia with Azeri as the language of instruction opened in Tiflis in 1847, followed by the [[Kizilajlo]] school in 1877. Before the establishment of Soviet power in 1921 and the introduction of compulsory universal education, there had already been 24 such schools across the country.&lt;ref&gt;Gulnara Gocaeva-Memmedova. [http://www.dergikaradeniz.com/web/upload/icerik/28/2.pdf Azerbaijani Schools in Today's Georgia]. ''Karadeniz'', 2015 (28): 29–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was not much incentive for Azeris to learn Georgian in the Soviet times. Those who chose to pursue post-secondary education in Georgia did so in universities with Russian as the language of instruction, where Georgian was not even offered as a second-language course.&lt;ref name="georgiatimes"/&gt; Since the fall of the Soviet Union, lack of knowledge of the [[official language]] makes it harder for Azeris and other ethnic minorities to be active in many social areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memo.ru/hr/referats/selfdet/Chapter16.htm ''Ethnic Minorities of Eastern and Southern Georgia''] by Alexander Kukhianidze (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;  Such isolation is furthered by the fact that many rural Azerbaijanis prefer to read newspapers published in Azerbaijani and set up satellite dishes in order to be able to watch channels of neighbouring Azerbaijan, or establish their own community television channels (such as Ellada TV, which functioned in [[Gardabani]] in 1995–1999).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media.ge/researches/otsenka_vozmojnostei_kvemo_kartli.pdf Estimating Potential of Kvemo Kartli] (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saakishvili government's educational policy attempted to provide students in majority-Armenian and Azeri areas with improved learning materials and teachers willing to instruct non-native speakers of Georgian. As of 2013, however, the program did not prove very efficient. The standards of the general ability exams considered mandatory and non-mandatory were altered in order to accommodate non-Georgians (for example, the exam on [[Literature of Georgia (country)|Georgian literature]] became optional) and a program funding minority group students wanting to study in the [[United States]] was introduced. On the other hand, the Law on Civil Service (adopted in 1998, but previously applied selectively) which stipulates that all work be carried out in Georgian, was enforced and, in effect, barred many Armenians and Azeris who had been schooled in their native languages not only from working in the civil service, but even accessing it due to insufficient knowledge of Georgian.&lt;ref name="sjones"/&gt;

==Religion==
[[File:Tiflis Premazzi.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Shah Ismayil Mosque (left) in [[Luigi Premazzi]]'s painting of old Tbilisi]]
Azeris in Georgia are mainly Muslim, with 80% being [[Shiite]] and 20% [[Sunni]],&lt;ref name="divhc"/&gt; a distinction that is not felt much due to religion not occupying an important part of their everyday lives.&lt;ref name="obstacles"/&gt; Georgia's constitution provides for [[religious freedom]], and Azeris have the opportunity to attend mosques in the country. The largest Shiite mosque in Tbilisi was built in 1524 by [[Ismail I]] of Persia.&lt;ref&gt;{{ka icon}} ''Ancient Towns of Georgia: Tbilisi'' (2nd ed.). Tbilisi, 2006. {{ISBN|99940-0-923-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, during the construction of the [[Metekhi]] bridge the communist government ordered the mosque to be demolished.&lt;ref name="zp"&gt;Zaza Piralishvili. [http://www.ca-c.org/annual/2007/19.shtml Conflicts in the Caucasus - International Conference]. 'Religion'. October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sunni mosque was built between 1723 and 1735 by the Ottomans, but it was destroyed in 1740 by reinvanding Persians. In 1864, it was restored and headed by the Teregulovs, a family of [[Volga Tatar]] origin who had settled in Tbilisi two decades prior to that.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uzeyirbook.musigi-dunya.az/RU/data.pl?id=610&amp;lang=RU Teregulovs]. Uzeyir Hajibeyov Encyclopædia.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the demolition of the Shiite mosque in 1951, the Shiite Azeris of Tbilisi have attended the Sunni mosque (the only Muslim temple in modern Tbilisi), where the Sunni and Shiite sections were separated by a black curtain. In 1996, the new imam ordered to remove the curtain and both denominations have prayed together ever since.&lt;ref name="zp"/&gt;

Although able to preserve their linguistic and religious identity, the Azeris in Georgia have undergone some influences from Georgian culture, such as mourning over the body of the deceased for three days, while Azeris elsewhere, as most Muslims, generally bury their dead on the day of death before sunset.&lt;ref name="divhc"/&gt;

==Demographics==
In 2014, Azeris constituted a majority or a significant (over 10%) minority in the towns and villages across the following municipalities: 58 in Marneuli, 43 in Dmanisi, 37 in Bolnisi, 17 in Gardabani, 11 in Sagarejo, 9 in Lagodekhi, 8 in Kaspi, 8 in Tsalka, 7 in Tetritsqaro, 4 in Mtskheta, 3 in Gori, 2 in Dedoplistsqaro, 1 in Akhmeta, 1 in Kareli, and 1 in Telavi.&lt;ref name="2014 census"/&gt; Ethnic Azeri villages are also among the largest in the country in terms of population.&lt;ref name="obstacles"/&gt;

The '''Bahnaric languages''' are a group of about thirty [[Austroasiatic languages]] spoken by about 700,000 people in [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Laos]]. [[Paul Sidwell]] notes that Austroasiatic/[[Mon–Khmer languages]] are lexically more similar to Bahnaric and [[Katuic languages]] the closer they are geographically, independently of which branch of the family they belong to, but that Bahnaric and Katuic do not have any [[shared innovation]]s that would suggest that together they form a branch of the Austroasiatic family, rather forming separate branches.

==Languages==
Internal diversity suggests that the family broke up about 3,000 years ago.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}} North Bahnaric is characterized by a [[register (phonology)|register]] contrast between breathy and modal voice, which in Sedang has tensed to become modal–creaky voice.

[[Lamam language|Lamam]] is a clan name of the neighboring Tampuon and Kaco’.

Sidwell (2009) tentatively classifies the Bahnaric languages into four branches, with [[Cua language (Mon–Khmer)|Cua]] (Kor) classified independently as East Bahnaric.&lt;ref&gt;Sidwell, Paul. 2009.

===North Bahnaric===
North Bahnaric consists of a [[dialect chain]] spoken to the north of the [[Chamic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Sidwell, Edmondson, &amp; Gregerson. 2011.

''[http://icaal.org/ICAAL-4.2.pdf Austroasiatic Studies: papers from the ICAAL4: Mon-Khmer Studies Journal Special Issue No. 3]'', pp.23-37&lt;/ref&gt; Sedang and Hre have the most speakers, each with about 100,000.

Other Northern Bahnaric languages, too poorly known to classify further, are [[Duan language|Duan]] and [[Katua language|Katua]].&lt;!--katua is not close to Cua. that's only from contact.--&gt;

===West Bahnaric===
West Bahnaric is a dialect chain to the west of North Bahnaric,&lt;ref name=draft&gt;{{cite web|url=http://email.eva.mpg.de/~wichmann/Sidwell_ASJP_draft.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611042638/http://email.eva.mpg.de/~wichmann/Sidwell_ASJP_draft.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the other Bahnaric languages to the east, the West Bahnaric languages were under Khmer rather than Chamic influence, and also by the Katuic languages as part of a Katuic-West Bahnaric sprachbund (Sidwell 2003).

**Oi–The: [[Jeng language|Jeng]]; [[Oy language|Oy]], [[Sok language|Sok]], [[Sapuan language|Sapuan]], [[The language|The]]

Sidwell (2003) proposes the following West Bahnaric groupings, with Lavi branching off first, Jru'/Laven, Su', and Juk as forming a branch that had branched off secondarily, and the rest within a core group. [[Jru' language|Jru']] and [[Brao language|Brao]] each have tens of thousands of speakers, while the other languages have no more than 1,000 speakers each.

===Central Bahnaric===
Central Bahnaric is a language family divided by the Chamic languages,&lt;ref name=draft/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.anu.edu.au/~u9907217/languages/Bahnaric-Central.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Bahnar, Mnong, and Sre (Koho) each have over 100,000 speakers.

****Sre–Mnong: [[Koho language|Koho]], [[Mnong language|Mnong]]

Kassang is a Bahnaric language (Sidwell 2003), though ''Ethnologue'' lists it as [[Katuic]].

Sidwell (2002, quoted in Sidwell 2003) gives the following classification for the Central Bahnaric languages.&lt;ref&gt;Sidwell, Paul (2002). "[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/sidwell2002genetic.pdf Genetic classification of the Bahnaric languages: a comprehensive review]." Mon-Khmer Studies: A Journal of Southeast Asian Linguistics and Languages 32: 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Note that Sidwell (2009) later classifies [[Cua language (Mon–Khmer)|Cua]] as an independent branch, namely East Bahnaric.

The '''Bedick''', or '''Bedik''', are a minority [[ethnic group]] of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sit.edu/studyabroad/program_content/contents.cfm?include=sgr_excursions.html&amp;progCode=ssa.sgr Senegal: Arts and Culture:Kedougou: Ethnic Minorities Discovery] at [[School for International Training]]&lt;/ref&gt; They live in villages in the most isolated area of eastern [[Senegal]], in the [[Arrondissement of Bandafassi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-43036-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html BANDAFASSI DSS, SENEGAL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208032059/http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-43036-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html |date=2007-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iwol]] is one of their settlements.  

The Bedick speak the [[Bedik language]] [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=tnr] and their religion is a [[syncretism|blend]] between their [[animist]] roots and a more recent [[Christian]] influence. More connected with [[Guinea Conakry]] or [[Mali]] than with Senegal, Bedick people have contact with other ethnic groups like [[Bassari]] and [[Serer people|Serer]]. Their ancestors are the families Keita and Camera that came from Mali because of the War led by [[Alpha Yaye]] coming from [[Fouta Djalon]].

'''[[Bulgarians]]''' ({{lang-es|búlgaros}}) in '''[[Spain]]''' ({{lang-bg|Испания}}, ''Ispania'') are one of the largest communities of the [[Bulgarian diaspora]]. According to official 2011 data, they numbered 150,878, making them the tenth-largest emigrant community in Spain and the second-largest among [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an emigrant communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/np756_en.pdf|title=National Institute of Statistics of Spain - 2011 Census|publisher=ine.es|accessdate=2011-05-23|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The bulk of [[Bulgarians]] in [[Spain]] consists of recent economic immigrants. Until recent years, Bulgarian emigration to Spain was scarce and unorganized. According to historian Ivan Dimitrov, an unknown number of Bulgarians fled to Spain after the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] in the late 14th or early 15th century. Dimitrov claims that around 300 families in Spain retain memories of their Bulgarian origin from that period.&lt;ref name="kolev"&gt;{{harvnb|Колев|2005|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Bulgarians are [[Banat Bulgarians]] from Romania, [[Aromanians]] and [[Megleno-Romanians]] who became adjusted to Spanish society because of the linguistic similarities between [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], as well as [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin identity]] of Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians, and Banat Bulgarians are predominantly Roman Catholic.

With the upsurge of Bulgarian economy in the 18th and 19th centuries, individual Bulgarian merchants reached the markets of Spain, though a colony was never formed even after the [[Liberation of Bulgaria]] in 1878. Only after [[World War I]] did Bulgarian [[gardener]]s reach Spain and [[Catalonia]] specifically. According to a 1930 statistic, 88 Bulgarian gardeners worked in Spain.&lt;ref name="gardeners"&gt;{{harvnb|Бъчваров|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936–39 and [[World War II]] that followed hindered the formation of a gardening colony.&lt;ref name="kolev"/&gt;

After World War II, a small number of Bulgarian political emigrants fleeing the [[communism|communist]] regime settled in Spain.&lt;ref name="kolev"/&gt; Among those emigrants was a large part of the Bulgarian royal family, including the deposed child monarch [[List of Bulgarian monarchs|Tsar]] [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Simeon II of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]], who was granted asylum by [[Francisco Franco]] in 1951. Simeon II lived in Spain for 50 years, until his return to Bulgaria in 2001.

Around 1998, the number of Bulgarians in Spain was only around 3,000. By 2002, around 10,000 people had been officially registered as legal Bulgarian emigrants, though the number of [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]] was thought to be much larger. In the early 21st century, substantial Bulgarian communities were formed in [[Madrid]], [[Barcelona]], [[Málaga]], [[San Sebastián]], [[Valladolid]], [[Palma (Majorca)|Palma de Mallorca]] and other cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Колев|2005|p=426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A charwoman who cleans buses sweeping the floor of a bus 8d32921v.jpg|thumb|A 1943 photograph of a charwoman in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania, United States]]

A '''charwoman''', '''charlady''', '''chargirl''' or just '''char''' is a cleaning girl or woman who can be employed in houses, shops and/or office buildings. The term charwoman was also used as an official job title in the [[United States]] before 1960, which included use by municipal and state governments  and by federal agencies such as the [[Department of Commerce and Labor|U.S. Department of Commerce and Labor]] (such as in the [[Bureau of the Census]] and the [[U.S. Immigration Service|Bureau of Immigration]]). Charwomen were often commonly referred to as scrubwomen. The word has the same root as "chore woman", one hired to do odd chores around the house.

==Description==
A ''char'' or ''chare'' was a turn (of work) in the sixteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;'Char' in [[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; which gave rise to the word being used as a prefix to denote people working in domestic service. The usage of "charwoman" was common in the mid-19th century, often appearing as an occupation in the UK census of 1841, but it fell out of common use in the later decades of the 20th century, often replaced by the term "daily (woman)". Unlike a [[maid]] or [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]], typically live-in positions, the charwoman usually worked for hourly wages, usually on a part-time basis, often having several different employers.

==Fiction==
{{example farm|section|date=April 2017}}
The position often features in fiction.

One notable character is Ebeneezer Scrooge's charwoman Mrs. Dilber who appears in [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''.

In 1926, [[Lord Dunsany]]'s fantasy novel, ''[[The Charwoman's Shadow]]'' was published to good reviews.

Another well-known fictional charwoman is Ada Harris, the central character in [[Paul Gallico]]'s novel ''[[Mrs 'Arris goes to Paris]]'' and its three sequels.

In the British radio comedy series ''[[It's That Man Again]],'' Dorothy Summers played the part of Mrs Mopp, an office char whose catch phrase was "Can I do you now, Sir?" (i.e., "May I clean your office now, Sir?" but with an obvious [[double entendre]]). 

A charwoman appears in [[Franz Kafka]]'s ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'' (1915).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka|url=http://summarycentral.tripod.com/themetamorphosis.htm|accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the short story "The Diary of Anne Rodway", by Wilkie Collins, Anne investigates the murder of her friend Mary and learns that the suspect's wife is a woman "ready to turn her hand to anything: charing, [[laundry|washing]], [[embalming|laying-out]], [[house sitting|keeping empty houses]]...."

A charwoman - Sarah Cobbin - is a critical character in the detective novel, ''Part for a Poisoner'' (1948) by [[ECR Lorac|E.C.R. Lorac]]

Mabel was the lowly charwoman and a main character in the British sitcom [[You Rang, M'Lord?]]

Motion pictures also had their share of charwoman characters. The best example of this is probably the series of films that featured the funny and feisty Irish charwoman Mrs. Riley, a creation of the music hall comedian [[Arthur Lucan]]. The public's enthusiasm for his impromptu stage character prompted him to make her a part of his repertoire and this led to his starring in sixteen [[Old Mother Riley]] films, from 1937 to 1952.

In 1963, [[Peggy Mount]] starred as charwoman Mrs. Cragg in ''[[Ladies Who Do]]'', a film in which a group of charwomen unite and go into high finance under the guidance of the eccentric Colonel Whitforth [[Robert Morley]], in order to save their old neighbourhood from a team of ruthless developers led by [[Harry H. Corbett]].

In 1966-67, actress [[Kathleen Harrison]] starred as Alice Thursday, a charwoman, who inherits ₤10 million from her employer, on the British television series, ''[[Mrs Thursday|Mrs. Thursday]]''.

U.S. comedian [[Carol Burnett]] made a charwoman character into a signature routine during her television career with [[Garry Moore]] and later on her own popular [[The Carol Burnett Show|long-running variety show]].

In the comic strip ''[[Andy Capp]]'', Andy's wife Flo is a charwoman.

==Purpose and Goals==
The Correctional Education Association is the professional organization for educators who work in adult correctional and juvenile justice facilities internationally. Although based in the United States of America, where most of its members work, it has made great advances in encouraging members from outside the US to become active members from outside the US to become active members of the organization. The CEA provides a host of services to its members.   These include the following: a peer-reviewed international journal, a quarterly newsletter, annual membership and resource directory, an accreditation system for prison, jail, and juvenile school programs, a website and listserves for its special interest groups, under-graduate and graduate online courses for educators, and many more services.&lt;ref name="CEANAT"&gt;[http://www.ceanational.org www.ceanational.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Austin MacCormick]] wrote a book based on the results of his 1928 nationwide survey of prison education (later published in 1931 as a book entitled ''The Education of Adult Prisoners: A Survey and a Program''). MacCormick was influenced by [[Thomas Mott Osborne]] as evidenced by the dedication of his book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Review: American Journal of Sociology, vol. 37, No. 5 |author=Review by A. Warren Steams |year=1932 |page=818-820}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacCormick was Assistant Director of the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|U.S. Bureau of Prisons]], organized in 1930 a standing committee on education within the American Prison Association (now the American Correctional Association).  The Standing Committee on Education published its first journal from 1937 to 1940 entitled Correctional Education.  In 1945, the Standing Committee on Education organized the Correctional Education Association (CEA) at the 76th Congress of the American Prison Association.  In 1946, CEA was formally recognized with Price Chenault elected as the first President.  In 1949, The Journal of Correctional Education was reestablished with Chester D. Owens as editor. In 1981, the CEA hired its first Executive Director, Osa Coffey, and established a national office.&lt;ref name="CEANAT" /&gt;

In 1986 CEA moved its national office to Maryland from Washington, DC where it remains today. The current address (October 2015) is 12625 Laurel Bowie Road #3430, Laurel, MD 20709.  Telephone is 443-459-3080 and the fax number is 443-459-3088.  Website:  www.ceanational.org.  The Acting Executive Director is Morris Dews and the Administrative Assistant is Kiara Wilson.

==Organization==
CEA is divided into 8 regions encompassing both the United States and Canada.  There are two international representative seats open on the Executive Board of the CEA. There is one representative for Canada and one for the Rest of the World. The International Representatives relay the issues and subjects of concern from international members to the Executive Board at regular meetings.

There are numerous state and provincial chapters. These regions and state/provincial chapters host annual conferences and training seminars.  The International CEA has an annual traveling summer conference and hosts an annual Spring Forum.  The annual International conferences offer members an opportunity to exchange ideas with correctional and prison educators from around the world and dialogue about the experience of teaching in a unique pedagogical setting. Each year the ''Journal of Correctional Education'' devotes a special issue to a different subject. The June 2007 issue of the ''Journal'' was devoted to international issues in correctional education with contributions from other countries including Ireland and Israel.

The CEA is the largest professional organization dedicated to the mission of education for those students in the Adult and Juvenile Criminal Justice Systems.  There are over 1300 members of CEA.&lt;ref name="CEANAT" /&gt;

Corruption in '''[[Armenia]]''' is a widespread and growing problem in Armenian society. [[Council of Europe]]'s [[Group of States Against Corruption]] in its fourth evaluation round noted that corruption remains an important problem for Armenian society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016806c2bd8|title=FOURTH EVALUATION ROUND on Armenia|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases of bribery in the extremely corrupt court are just one of the major forms that corruption takes in this country. 

== Extent ==

In 2017 there were 634 corruption related criminal cases registered (up from 428 in 2016), which led to criminal persecution of 376 persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.armstat.am/file/article/sv_12_17r_550.pdf|title=Criminal statistics of 2017 summary by Armstat|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Armenia scored 35 on [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] and was positioned 107th out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/country/ARM|title=Transparency International - Armenia|last=e.V.|first=Transparency International|website=www.transparency.org|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perception Index 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following chart represents score of Armenia in Transparency International's [[Corruption Perceptions Index]], higher is better.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2017|last=e.V.|first=Transparency International|work=www.transparency.org|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Transparency International]] 2014 report, entrenched corruption, strong patronage networks, a lack of clear separation between private enterprise and public office, as well as the overlap between political and business elites in Armenia render the implementation of anti-corruption efforts relatively inefficient and feed a pervasive political apathy and cynicism on the part of citizens, who do not see an impactful role for themselves in the fight against corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/nisarticle/vanuatu_2014|title=TI’s 2014 National Integrity System Assessment Armenia|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the [[United Nations Development Programme]] in [[Armenia]] views corruption in Armenia as "a serious challenge to its development."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undp.am/?page=Speeches&amp;id=9 "Strengthening Cooperation between the National Assembly, Civil Society and the Media in the Fight Against Corruption"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502142609/http://www.undp.am/?page=Speeches&amp;id=9 |date=2006-05-02 }}, Speech by Ms. Consuelo Vidal, (UN RC / UNDP RR), April 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The selective and non-transparent application of tax, customs and regulatory rules, as well as weak enforcement of court decisions fuels opportunities for corruption. The Armenian procurement system is characterised by instances of unfair tender processes and preferential treatment. Relationship between high-ranking government officials and the emerging private business sector encourage influence peddling. The government has reportedly failed to fund implementation of the anti-corruption strategy and devoted no money and little commitment for anti-corruption efforts.

== Anti-corruption institutions ==
The main anti-corruption institutions of the Armenian government are an Anti-Corruption Council – headed by the prime minister – and the Anti-Corruption Strategy Monitoring Commission, established in June 2004 to strengthen the implementation of anticorruption policy.  However, these institutions scarcely functioned in 2006-2007, even though they were supposed to meet twice-quarterly and monthly, respectively.&lt;ref name="TI-GCP-2008-p225"&gt;''[http://www.transparency.org/content/download/32778/502137 Global Corruption Report 2008]'', [[Transparency International]], Chapter 7.4, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Armenian Anti-Corruption Council was accused of lavish spending and has largely failed to investigate or prosecute senior officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/12/armenia-corruption-lavish-spending|title=Armenia's anti-corruption council accused of lavish spending|last=Grigoryan|first=Marianna|date=2015-08-12|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://transparency.am/en/news/view/1049|title=The Guardian: Armenia's anti-corruption council accused of lavish spending|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The late [[Prime Minister of Armenia|Prime Minister]] [[Andranik Margarian]] launched Armenia’s first post-Soviet campaign against corruption in 2003. The initiative, however, has been widely disparaged for being short on results.&lt;ref name="EurasiaNet-Jul11-08"&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav071108.shtml "ARMENIA: GETTING SERIOUS ABOUT CORRUPTION?"], EurasiaNet, July 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Former Prime Minister [[Tigran Sargsyan]] has acknowledged that corruption is Armenia’s "number one problem that obstructs all our reforms."&lt;ref name="EurasiaNet-Jul11-08"/&gt;

The government has recently launched an anti-graft campaign which has been accompanied by changes in customs regulations, reported tax police inspections of companies owned by pro-government businesspeople and numerous high-profile firings of people in the tax department, customs service and police. The recent crackdown on corruption has received mixed reactions.&lt;ref name="EurasiaNet-Jul11-08"/&gt;

== Areas ==

=== Courts ===
Corruption takes the form of bribery in Armenian courts. If you have relative judges or can give bribes ranging from a few hundred to thousands of US dollars, you can easily get the judge to let you win the case. This has resulted in a large portion of repatriated Armenians from the USA an many other countries to lose everything they bring to the country and worked very hard for. 

=== Mining ===
Regulation of [[Mineral industry of Armenia|mineral industry in Armenia]] carries multiple corruption risks, as it was highlighted by international research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/combatting_corruption_in_mining_approvals|title=TI Publication - Combatting corruption in mining approvals|last=e.V.|first=Transparency International|website=www.transparency.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
Despite the success  of the authorities in  reducing  petty  corruption/bribery  in  some  citizen-government  interactions,  anti-corruption  watchdogs report that  entrenched corruption, strong  patronage  networks, a lack  of clear separation between private enterprise and public office, as well as the overlap between political and business elites limit the effective implementation of anti-corruption efforts. These problems affect the education system too. It is perceived as one of the sectors that is hit hardest by corruption.  Attempts to fight the problem have brought mixed results and often opened new opportunities for malpractice instead of closing the existing ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osf.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Integrity-Report_ENG_PUBLISHED_16.01.2017.pdf Strengthening integrity and fighting corruption in education: Armenia, Open Society Foundations - Armenia and Center for Applied Policy, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/corruption/acn/Armenia-Round-3-Monitoring-Report-ENG.pdf Armenia,3 Round of Monitoring of the Istanbul Action Plan, OECD Publishing, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tax and customs agencies ===
[[Image:Armenian State Revenue Committee building.JPG|thumb|The notoriously corrupt Armenian State Revenue Committee (housing both the Armenian Customs Service and the Armenian Tax Service) helps maintain import monopolies as well as aid tax evasion.]]

In 2007, World Bank economists pointed to serious problems with rule of law and widespread corruption in the Armenian tax and customs agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2007/03/60b25634-7974-4d9d-a2a4-7d7ad3515f06.asp ''World Bank Urges ‘Second Generation Reforms’ In Armenia''], Armenia Liberty (RFE/RL), March 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Misappropriation of international loans ===
In March 2004, an ad hoc commission of the Armenian parliament investigating the use of a $30 million [[World Bank]] loan concluded that mismanagement and corruption among government officials and private firms was the reason of the failure of the program to upgrade [[Yerevan]]'s battered water infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Eurasianet-Corruption-Chronicles-5"&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/armenia08/corruption/case5.shtml ''Corruption Chronicles: International Loans''], Eurasianet.org, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The World Bank issued the loan in 1999 in order to improve Yerevan residents' access to drinking water.  The government promised to ensure around-the-clock water supplies to the vast majority of households by 2004, but as of 2008, most city residents continue to have running water for only a few hours a day.&lt;ref name="Eurasianet-Corruption-Chronicles-5"/&gt;

[[Veolia Environnement]], the French utility giant that took over Yerevan's loss-making water and sewerage network in 2006, has said that it will need a decade to end water rationing.&lt;ref name="Eurasianet-Corruption-Chronicles-5"/&gt;  In August 2007, Bruce Tasker, a Yerevan-based British engineer who had participated in the parliamentary inquiry as an expert, publicly implicated not only Armenian officials and businessmen but also World Bank representatives in Yerevan in the alleged misuse of the loan. In an October 4, 2007 news conference, the World Bank Yerevan office head Aristomene Varoudakis denied the allegations, claiming that the World Bank disclosed fully all information available on the project to the parliamentary commission and that based on this information there was no evidence of fraud or mismanagement in the project.&lt;ref name="Eurasianet-Corruption-Chronicles-5"/&gt;

[[Image:Eminent domain, Northern Avenue, Yerevan.JPG|thumb|Northern Avenue residents protest the proposed demolition of their building through signs and posters, 2011.]]

=== Illegitimate use of eminent domain ===

[[Eminent domain]] laws&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.president.am/library/constitution/eng/?chapter=2&amp;pn=3 The Constitution of the Republic of Armenia (27 November 2005), Chapter 2: Fundamental Human and Civil Rights and Freedoms, Article 31] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127101108/http://president.am/library/constitution/eng/?chapter=2&amp;pn=3 |date=27 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have been used to forcefully remove residents, business owners, and land owners from their property.  The projects that finally are built on the site are not of state interest, but rather are privately owned by the same authorities who have executed the eminent domain clause.  A prominent example is the development of Yerevan's central Northern Avenue area.  Another involves an ongoing project (as of November 2008) to construct a trade center near Yerevan's botanical garden.  The new land owners are non other than Yerevan's mayor [[Yervand Zakharyan]] and Deputy Mayor [[Karen Davtyan]], who was at one time Director of the Armenian Development Agency and successfully executed the eviction of residents on Northern Avenue.&lt;ref name="Hetq-Nov-10-2008"&gt;[http://www.hetq.am/eng/society/8529/ ''The Yerevan Municipality Allocates a Parcel of Land to one of its Employees under the Guise of “Eminent Domain”''], Hetq Online, November 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traffic police and extortion ===

Traffic police residing along major highways, such as those connecting traffic between Tbilisi and Yerevan frequently extort passing traffic for bribes in exchange for forgiving "traffic violations". Tourists are especially targeted, with the police openly requesting ~5,000 Armenian Dram per bribe. Violations are often fabricated, and police target local and foreign drivers alike.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7790">'''Cue validity''' is the [[conditional probability]] that an object falls in a particular category given a particular feature or ''cue''. The term was popularized by {{Harvtxt|Beach|1964}}, {{Harvtxt|Reed|1972}} and especially by [[Eleanor Rosch]] in her investigations of the acquisition of so-called [[Prototype_theory#Basic_level_categories | ''basic categories'']] ({{Harvnb|Rosch|Mervis|1975}};{{Harvnb|Rosch|1978}}). 

==Definition of cue validity==
Formally, the cue validity of a feature &lt;math&gt;f_i\ &lt;/math&gt; with respect to category &lt;math&gt;c_j\ &lt;/math&gt; has been defined in the following ways:
* As the conditional probability &lt;math&gt;p(c_j|f_i)\ &lt;/math&gt;; see {{Harvtxt|Reed|1972}}, {{Harvtxt|Rosch|Mervis|1975}}, {{Harvtxt|Rosch|1978}}.
* As the deviation of the conditional probability from the category base rate, &lt;math&gt;p(c_j|f_i)-p(c_j)\ &lt;/math&gt;; see {{Harvtxt|Edgell|1993}}, {{Harvtxt|Kruschke|Johansen|1999}}.
* As a function of the linear correlation; see {{Harvtxt|Smedslund|1955}}, {{Harvtxt|Castellan|1973}}, {{Harvtxt|Sawyer|1991}}, {{Harvtxt|Busemeyer|Myung|McDaniel|1993}}.
* Other definitions; see {{Harvtxt|Restle|1957}}, {{Harvtxt|Martignon|Vitouch|Takezawa|Forster|2003}}.

For the definitions based on probability, a high cue validity for a given feature means that the feature or attribute is more diagnostic of the class membership than a feature with low cue validity. Thus, a high-cue validity feature is one which conveys more information about the category or class variable, and may thus be considered as more useful for identifying objects as belonging to that category. Thus, high cue validity expresses high feature ''informativeness''. For the definitions based on linear correlation, the expression of "informativeness" captured by the cue validity measure is not the full expression of the feature's informativeness (as in [[mutual information]], for example), but only that portion of its informativeness that is expressed in a linear relationship. For some purposes, a bilateral measure such as the [[mutual information]] or [[category utility]] is more appropriate than the cue validity.

==Examples==
As an example, let us consider the domain of "numbers" and allow that every number has an attribute (i.e., a ''cue'') named "&lt;code&gt;is_positive_integer&lt;/code&gt;", which we call &lt;math&gt;f_{p\mbox{-}int}\ &lt;/math&gt;, and which adopts the value 1 if the number is actually a positive [[integer]]. Then we can inquire what the validity of this cue is with regard to the following classes: {&lt;code&gt;rational number&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;irrational number&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;even integer&lt;/code&gt;}:
* If we know that a number is a positive integer we know that it is a [[rational number]]. Thus, &lt;math&gt;p(c_{rational}|f_{p\mbox{-}int}) = 1\ &lt;/math&gt;, the cue validity for &lt;code&gt;is_positive_integer&lt;/code&gt; as a cue for the category &lt;code&gt;rational number&lt;/code&gt; is 1.
* If we know that a number is a positive integer then we know that it is ''not'' an [[irrational number]]. Thus, &lt;math&gt;p(c_{irrational}|f_{p\mbox{-}int}) = 0\ &lt;/math&gt;, the cue validity for &lt;code&gt;is_positive_integer&lt;/code&gt; as a cue for the category &lt;code&gt;irrational number&lt;/code&gt; is 0.
* If we know only that a number is a positive integer, then its chances of being even or odd are 50-50 (there being the same number of even and odd integers). Thus, &lt;math&gt;p(c_{even}|f_{p\mbox{-}int}) = 0.5\ &lt;/math&gt;, the cue validity for &lt;code&gt;is_positive_integer&lt;/code&gt; as a cue for the category &lt;code&gt;even integer&lt;/code&gt; is 0.5, meaning that the attribute &lt;code&gt;is_positive_integer&lt;/code&gt; is entirely uninformative about the number's membership in the class &lt;code&gt;even integer&lt;/code&gt;.

In [[perception]], "cue validity" is often short for ''[[ecological validity (perception)|ecological validity]]'' of a perceptual cue, and is defined as a correlation rather than a probability (see above). In this definition, an uninformative perceptual cue has an ecological validity of 0 rather than 0.5.

==Use of the cue validity==
In much of the work on modeling human category learning, there has been the assumption made (and sometimes validated) that attentional weighting tracks the cue validity, or tracks some related measure of feature informativeness. This would imply that attributes are differently weighted by the perceptual system; informative or high-cue validity attributes being weighted more heavily, while uninformative or low-cue validity attributes are weighted more lightly or ignored altogether (see, e.g., Navarro 1998).

The '''Dimbula Athletic and Cricket Club''' (also known as the '''Radella Club''') is a sporting club formed by British tea planters and founded in 1856. It is the oldest sporting club in [[Sri Lanka]] outside of Colombo, with activities including rugby, cricket, squash, billiards, snooker, tennis and badminton.

The club is most synonymous with [[rugby union|rugby]], as Dimbula A&amp;CC was the only up country club to win the coveted [[Clifford Cup]], in 1953 and again in 1959. This achievement wasn't matched until 1992 when the [[Kandy Sports Club (rugby)|Kandy Sports Club]] were successful in winning the cup.

The first up country cricket match was played in 1868 at the club's grounds in [[Radella Cricket Grounds|Radella]] against [[Dickoya]], becoming an annual fixture in the region.

In 1878 one of its members, [[Frank Hadow]], a planter who was on Carlabeck Estate, won [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] [[List of Wimbledon gentlemen's singles champions#Champions|men's]] singles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nation.lk/2009/03/01/sports6.htm|title=Hill country loses a colourful sports personality|first=M.|last=Minhas|newspaper=[[Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka)|Sunday Observer]]|date=1 March 2009|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The club's first official rugby match was played on 7 March 1880 against fellow Up Country club, [[Dickoya Maskeliya Cricket Club]], in [[Darawella]], with Dickoya winning 9&amp;ndash;3. Both clubs played a return fixture the next week this time at [[Radella Cricket Grounds|Radella]], where Dickoya were again victorious 3&amp;ndash;nil. The annual rugby match between Dimbulla and Dickoya, is one of the oldest rugby competitions in Sri Lanka.
 
In 1908 the club was one of six founding rugby clubs which formed the [[Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union|Ceylon Rugby Football Union]].
 
In the following year the club introduced [[Badminton]] to the country, with its own indoor court, becoming the first badminton club in Ceylon.

On the 17 April 1954 Her Majesty [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and His Royal Highness [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] visited the club as part of their tour of [[Dominion of Ceylon|Ceylon]], as the country was previously known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/2510710/hm-the-queen-and-hrh-the-duke-of-edinburgh-visit-to-radella-rugby-club-Ceylon|title=HM The Queen and HRH The Duke of Edinburgh visit to Radella Rugby Club, Ceylon|publisher=Royal Collection Trust|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The original Victorian-style club house, with an antique clock on top of the pavilion was destroyed by fire in 1962 and a replacement building was constructed thereafter.

In 1970 the rugby team, led by Ken Murray won the [[Sri Lanka Rugby Championship]], losing only one match during the entire season and that to the [[Ceylonese Rugby &amp; Football Club]] at the team's home ground at [[Radella Cricket Grounds|Radella]]. The club bowing out of the Clifford Cup losing to [[Sri Lanka Police Sports Club (Rugby)|Police Sports Club]] in the competition semi-finals. 

With the nationalisation of the tea estates in 1975, the club ceased playing ‘A’ Division Rugby but continued playing in the Up Country League.

== Cultural backdrop ==
{{See|Women in Ghana|Religion in Ghana}}
One of the main reasons for the high incidence is [[Women in Ghana]] live in a highly [[patriarchal]] society where the man/father is the head of the household and takes all major household decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the-generation.net/domestic-violence-in-ghana-socially-accepted-and-judicially-trivialized/|title=Domestics Violence in Ghana: Socially Accepted and Judicially Trivialized - The Generation|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also many spouses are reluctant to report to police and would rather consult their local spiritual leader.

== Efforts to counter domestic violence ==
In 2007 the Ghanaian government created the Domestic Violence Act in an attempt to reduce violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2014/09/25/GHA103468.E.pdf |format=PDF |title=GHA103468.E |website=Justice.gov |accessdate=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act encountered significant resistance from cultural [[Conservatism|conservatives]] and religious leaders who believed that such a law would undermine traditional [[Africa]]n values, and that [[Western philosophy|Western values]] were being implemented into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernghana.com/news/124409/1/domestic-violence-bill-passed-at-last.html|title=Domestic Violence Bill Passed At Last|work=Modernghana.com|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/ndpc-static/CACHES/PUBLICATIONS/2016/04/16/domestic+violence+act.pdf|title=Microsoft Word - Domestic Violence Act 732|date=|website=S3.amazonaws.com|format=PDF|accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/domviol/priorwinners/Boas2.authcheckdam.pdf|title=Lessons from Ghana:The Challenges of a Legal Response to Domestic Violence in Africa|date=|accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the Ghanaian government set up a domestic violence board to combat the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghanaiantimes.com.gh/domestic-violence-board-set-up/|title=Domestic Violence Board Set Up|publisher=The Ghanaian Times|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Name * |url=http://www.ghanaguardian.com/research-report-domestic-violence-launched/ |title=Research Report on Domestic Violence Launched |website=Ghanaguardian.com |date=2016-08-18 |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghana.gov.gh/index.php/news/3038-ghana-domestic-violence-research-report-launched-in-accra|title=Ghana Domestic Violence Research Report Launched in Accra|publisher=Government of Ghana|first=Sule|last=Jotie|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghanaiantimes.com.gh/domestic-violence-board-set-up/|title=Domestic Violence Board Set Up|work= The Ghanaian Times|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental''', '''ecological''' or '''green gentrification''' is a process in which cleaning up pollution or providing green amenities increases local property values and attracts wealthier residents to a previously polluted or disenfranchised neighbourhood.&lt;ref name="Banzhaf&amp;McCormick"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banzhaf |first1=H. Spencer |last2=McCormick |first2=Eleanor |title=Moving beyond cleanup: Identifying the crucibles of environmental gentrification |journal=NCEE Working Paper Series |date=2006 |url=https://www.epa.gov/environmental-economics/working-paper-moving-beyond-cleanup-identifying-crucibles-environmental}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dooling|first=Sarah|date=2009|title=Ecological gentrification: A research agenda exploring justice in the city|url=|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|volume=|pages=621–639|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green amenities include green spaces, [[park]]s [[green roof]]s, [[garden]]s and [[Green building|green and energy efficient building materials]].  These initiatives can heal many environmental ills from industrialization and beautify urban landscapes.  Additionally, greening is imperative for reaching a sustainable future.  However, if accompanied by gentrification, such initiatives can have an ambiguous social impact if the poor (especially renters) are displaced or forced to pay higher housing costs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; First coined by Sieg et al. (2004)&lt;ref name="Sieg_etal"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sieg |first1=Holger |last2=Smith |first2=V. Kerry |last3=Banzhaf |first3=H. Spencer |last4=Walsh |first4=Randall |title=Estimating the general equilibrium benefits of large changes in spatially delineated public goods |journal=International Economic Review |date=2004 |volume=45 |issue=4 |page=1047–77 |doi=10.1111/j.0020-6598.2004.00297.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.462.768 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, environmental gentrification is a relatively new concept, although it can be considered as a new hybrid of the older and wider topics of gentrification and environmental justice.  Various studies have analyzed the social implications of greening projects specifically with regards to housing affordability and displacement of vulnerable citizens.

== Gentrification ==

[[Gentrification]] is a process whereby a neighbourhoods is transformed in order to cater to a wealthier home buyer or investor.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gentrification|last=Lees|first=Loretta|last2=Slater|first2=Tom|last3=Wyly|first3=Evlin K.|publisher=Routledge/Taylor &amp; Francis Group|year=2008|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The process often takes place in [[Working class|working-class]] neighbourhoods that are inhabited by low-income residents.  [[Real estate development|Real-estate development]] such as luxury condominiums or the transformation of old factories into trendy lofts, attract wealthier investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=London: aspects of change|author=Ruth Glass|year=1964|publisher=London: MacGibbon &amp; Kee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Loft Living|last=Zukin|first=Sharon|publisher=Rutgers UP|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the process progresses, low-income residents are pushed out or to the outskirts of the neighbourhood as real-estate and rent prices are increased due to demand.  Also, as middle-class residents enter the neighbourhood surrounding businesses transform to accommodate desires.  [[Gentrification]] has often been promoted by local governments through policies that promote ‘[[urban renewal|'urban renewal.']]&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Generally, the process is considered to benefit the local economy and improve neighbourhoods.  Three phases of [[gentrification]] are generally recognized:
# 1960's-1970s - an irregular process led by the government which hoped to reinvest capital to the inner-city.  
# 1970s - widespread in big cities and spreading to smaller towns across North America.  Promotion of art communities such as Soho Manhattan to attract residents and investors.
# 1990s - extensive large-scale development increased in scale and complexity through public-private partnerships.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hackworth|first=Jason|last2=Smith|first2=Neil|date=2001|title=The changing state of gentrification|url=|journal=Tijdschrift voor Economische en Sociale|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As wealthier citizens have started to demand green amenities, cities have shifted their focus to marrying urban redevelopment with green initiatives all of which follow a similar process.

== Urban planning and sustainability ==

Cities and individuals are responding the [[ecological crisis]] through [[Environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]] planning and actions.  Currently, the [[United Nations]] estimates that approximately 54% of the world's inhabitants are living in cities.  This number is expected to increase to 66% by the year 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nations|first=United|date=2014|title=World urbanization prospects:  the 2014 revision, highlights|url=|journal=Population Division United Nations|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many ways, the city functions like a metabolic organism, extracting, using and disposing of resources across space and time.  Therefore, studying the urban environment can often reveal spatial positions of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heynen|first=Nik|last2=Kaika|first2=Maria|last3=Swyngedouw|first3=Eric|date=|title=Urban political ecology|url=|journal=Urban Political Ecology and the Politics of Urban Metabolism|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in the United States there is a negative correlation between the provision of urban green space and [[African Americans|African-American]] and [[Hispanic]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wen|first=Ming|date=2013|title=Spatial disparities in the distribution of parks and green spaces in the USA|url=|journal=Annals of Behavioral Medicine|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spaces that are provided tend to have a lack in municipal upkeep and policing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownlow|first=Alec|date=2006|title=Inherited fragmentations and narratives of environmental control and entrepreneurial Philadelphia|url=|journal=In the Nature of Cities:  Urban Political Ecology and the Politics of Urban Metabolism|volume=|pages=208–225|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, green space in affluent neighbourhoods tend to promote activities for [[wealth]]y citizens which help to maintain a certain social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dooling|first=Sarah|date=2008|title=Ecological gentrification:  re-negotiating justice in the city|url=|journal=Critical Planing|volume=15|pages=40–57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sustainability]] is a tool that has been used by governments and developers to promote green initiatives in cities.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quastel|first=Noah|date=2009|title=Political ecologies of gentrifiction|url=|journal=Urban Geography|volume=7|pages=694–725|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Growing out of the promotion of [[sustainable development]] for [[Developing country|developing countries]], [[sustainability]] emerged as a global proposal at the [[Earth Summit|1992 United Nations Earth Summit]].  In theory, [[sustainability]] is achievable through a balance of three pillars - [[economy]], [[Natural environment|environment]] and [[social equity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=W. M.|date=2009|title=The future of sustainability: re-thinking environment and development in the twenty-first century|url=|journal=Report for the IUCN Renowned Thinkings Meeting|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in practice it still remains a challenge.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Green gentrification:  urban sustainability and the struggle for environmental justice|last=Gould|first=Kenneth A.|last2=Lewis|first2=Tammy L.|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The social equity portion of sustainability is concerned with providing local communities ability to participate in [[decision-making]] as well as benefit from development projects.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; [[Public participation]] aims to ensure that local concerns and needs are met.

In many examples, the redevelopment of brownsites (post-industrial areas) have become foundations for large-scale urban greening redevelopment.  These sites are typical of past industrial landscapes - near the downtown core and waterfront and in need of environmental remediation. Environmental redevelopments often promote sustainability through urban planning mechanisms such as [[New Urbanism|new urbanism]] which promotes that planning that focus on building cities that are [[livable]] and [[Walkability|walkable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Home from nowhere: remaking our everyday world for the twenty-first century|last=Kuntsler|first=James Howard|publisher=A touchstone book|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

A 15-year study (1990-2005) examined the social impacts or enhancing urban green spaces across the city of [[Barcelona]].  During the 1990s and 2000s, 18 new urban green parks were added to the city planning agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parcs I|first=Jardins Barcelona|date=2007|title=In Memoria|url=|journal=Barcelona: Ajuntament de Barcelona, Parcs I Jardins|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First and foremost, as Barcelona was awarded the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympic Games]], the city prepared for the event through numerous urban developments which influenced a transformation of [[public space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anguelovski|first=Isabelle|date=2014|title=Neighborhood as a refuge: community reconstruction, place remaking, and environmental justice in the city|url=|journal=MIT Press|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the city had been concerned with providing [[urban park]]s for the purpose of socializing and exercising.  However, as the Olympics were  swiftly approaching, urban planners and city governments took the opportunity to develop green spaces for mega-events.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anguelovski|first=Isabelle|date=2017|title=Assessing green gentrification in historically disenfranchised neighborhoods:  a longitudinal and spatial analysis of Barcelona|url=|journal=Urban Geography|volume=|pages=1–34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These new types of spaces prioritize the aesthetic features of urban green space in an effort to attract tourists and offer memorable landscapes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The legacy of mega-event [[urban park]]s can be observed in three notable parks around the city - Parc del Port Olimpic, Parc del Poblenou and Parc de Diagnol Mar.  All three of these parks have shifted neighborhood demographics towards greater affluence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The city of Barcelona released its plan for [[sustainability]] titled ''Barcelona Green Infrastructure and Biodiversity Plan 2020.''  This document does not contain plans for housing affordability or social impacts that are a result from large-scale development.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Diagonal Mar project provides an example of the green initiatives being coupled with large-scale [[Urban planning|urban redevelopment]] on a previous brownfield site.  Historically, the area was an industry hub as it is located near the [[Mediterranean Sea]].  The [[Diagonal Mar i el Front Marítim del Poblenou|Diagonal Mar]] project includes luxury condominiums, three hotels, three office buildings, a shopping mall nested within an urban green space.  The project has been criticized for not considering local input into planning as lacking spaces for social interactions for citizens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sauri|first=David|date=2009|title=Changing conceptions of sustainability in Barcelona's public parks|url=|journal=Geographical Review|volume=99.1|pages=23–36|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies suggest that green [[gentrification]] has occurred in correspondence with park development in the [[Sant Martí (district)|Sant Marti]] district.  Using neighbourhood measurements of wealth, the authors suggest that demographic shifts of the neighbourhood have taken place at an alarming rate 1990-2005.  Moreover, areas surrounding parks have experienced clear indicators of these changes as there has been an increase in:  residents with a bachelor's degree,  residents from the global North, household income or home sale and an overall decrease in the population of residents 65 and older living alone.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===== The High Line =====
[[File:Highline after.jpg|thumb|An image of the High Line after its redevelopment.]]
The [[High Line]], is a 1.45-mile-long (2.33&amp;nbsp;km) an elevated public park that was constructed on a historic freight line along the west side of [[Manhattan]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921033407/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/new-high-line-section-opens-extending-park-34th-st-article-1.1946927|title=New High Line section opens, extending the park to 34th St|last=Green|first=F|date=September 21, 2014|work=Daily News|access-date=February 23, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Previous to its [[redevelopment]], the [[High Line]] represented the deterioration of New York’s industry, the neighbourhood of alongside the High Line, Chelsea, had frequent delinquency.  Since the 1980s the city government has attempted to tear down this eyesore.  In response, activists ventured to save this icon of history and instead promoted the idea that the [[High Line]] could be returned to the community as a provision of public good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=High Line:  The inside story of New York city's park in the sky|last=David|first=Joshua|last2=Hammond|first2=Robert|publisher=FSG Originals|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the High Line was acquired by the [[CSX Transportation]] Inc. in 1999, community board meetings provided an avenue for alternative uses to be proposed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loughran|first=Kevin|date=2014|title=Parks for profit:  The high line, growth machines, and uneven development of urban public spaces|url=|journal=City &amp; Community|volume=13.1|pages=49–68|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around the same time, Joshua David and Robert Hammond formed a non-profit they called [[Friends of the High Line]] of which their main goal was to acquire public and private funds to save the bridge from demolition.  Notable celebrities - [[Edward Norton]], [[Martha Stewart]] and [[Kevin Bacon]] provided financial support for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/08/arts/design/how-everyone-jumped-aboard-a-railroad-to-nowhere.html|title=How everyone jumped aboard a railroad to nowhere|last=Demonchaux|first=Thomas|date=May 8, 2005|work=|access-date=February 23, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Friends of the High Line presented a redevelopment strategy to the [[Mayoralty of Michael Bloomberg|Bloomberg administration]], promoting that the bridge could be converted into a public park.  [[High Line|Friends Of the High Line]] suggested that this would provide economic benefits to the surrounding neighborhood and generate substantial tax revenues.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/06/nyregion/with-next-phase-ready-area-around-high-line-is-flourishing.html|title=The High Line isn't just a sight to see; it's also an economic dynamo|last=McGeehan|first=Patrick|date=June 5, 2011|work=New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Mayoralty of Michael Bloomberg|Bloomberg administration]] accepted the initiative.  Mayor Bloomberg provided a statement of support by stating, “The Board’s ruling is a great win for all New Yorkers.  It allows us to implement our plans to preserve this valuable historic resource, create a much needed public open space and strengthen our city’s economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehighline.org/|title=Mayor authorization for High Line project [press release]|last=Friends of the High Line|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence that this project has ignited [[gentrification]] can be observed through the soaring real estate prices as well as types of activities that are being attracted to the [[High Line]] and its surrounding areas.  In just two years, there has been a production of $2 Billion real-estate construction which has contributed an additional $900 million in tax revenues.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Additionally, the relocation of [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] nearby sheds light on the popularity of the park.

The [[High Line]], although presented as a public park, privileges certain users and activities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  [[Friends of the High Line]] allow for only certain types of vendors as well as provides private security guards.  Visitors of the High Line can enjoy artisanal foods, micro-brewed beer and browse up-scaled art merchant booths.  The promotion of economic growth and certain types of consumption coupled with surveillance results in the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberalization]] of this public spaces.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Which is to say, The High Line, although a famous icon for the city, may fall short of providing open spaces and benefits for ''all'' citizens to use and enjoy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Instead it more closely resembles a place of spatial 'privileged'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=PrivilegeL  A Reader|last=Kimmel|first=Michael|publisher=Westview Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=Boulder, CO|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where claims to public space are dominated by upper-class citizens.

Concurrently in 2007, the Bloomberg administration released the ''[[PlaNYC|PlaNYC 2030: A Greater, Greener New York]]'' which aimed to combat climate change through expanding sustainability measured with 132 initiatives.  One goal highlights the social pillar of sustainability by having a goal that every citizen in the city will have a green space within a 10-minute walking distance from their home.

==== Vancouver ====

===== False Creek =====
The traditional urban layout of [[Vancouver]] was reminiscent of a small-town.  Grid-iron patterned streets were lined with single-family dwellings, businesses could be found along main streets and industry was concentrated along shorelines and inlets.  The 1960s ushered in a shift towards higher densities through high rise residential buildings in the downtown core.  In the 1980s, redevelopment of [[Brownfield land|brownsites]] (former industrial areas) for condominium development in the [[False Creek]] region was a result of it being the site for [[Expo 67|Expo 1986]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mills|first=Caroline A.|date=1988|title="Life on the upslope":  the postmodern landscape of gentrification|url=|journal=Society and Space|volume=6 |issue=2|pages=169–190|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously, this area was the heartland of industry and had begun to deteriorate as industry shifted.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  After the [[Expo 67|Expo]] the site was acquired by Hong Kong billionaire [[Li Ka-shing|Li Ka-Shing]] for $320 million and a numerous residential luxury developments followed suite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olda|first=K.|date=1998|title=Globalization and urban change: tales from Vancouver via Hong Kong|url=|journal=Urban Geography|volume=19 |issue=4|pages=360–385|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These developments promoted a tone of [[sustainability]] that were supported through planning documents such as Livable Region Strategic Planning (1996).  Urban planning strategies such as [[Smart growth|Smart Growth]] stressed environmental goals could be achieved through the provision of [[Walkability|walkable]] and [[Mixed-use development|mixed-use]] urban areas which would reduce [[urban sprawl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krueger|first=Rob|date=2005|title=Sustainability schizophrenia or "actually existing sustainabilities? toward a broader understanding of politics and promises of local sustainability in the US|url=|journal=Geoforum|volume=|pages=410–417|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critiques of [[Smart growth|Smart Growth]] highlight the often ignored equity aspects of the strategy as they often ignore low-income residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pozdena|first=Randal J.|date=2002|title=Smart growth and its effects on housing markets:  the new segregation|url=|journal=National Center for Public Policy Research|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Affordable housing in Canada|Housing affordability]] became an issue during 2001-2007 as the price for a typical two-bedroom in the west end of Vancouver shifted from $260,000 to $650,000.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Marc|date=2008|title=Affordable EcoDensity - Making affordable housing a core principle of Vancouver's EcoDensity charter|url=|journal=The Canadian Center for Policy Research|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, the city council accepted [[EcoDensity]] as a solution to housing affordability which promoted further [[Urban density|densification]] of downtown and surrounding neighbourhoods.  [[EcoDensity]] is the solution to housing affordability rather than provision of social housing.  A number of towers were constructed in the downtown Eastside displaced approximately 4,000 low-income residents from June 2007-January 2008.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  Critiques of [[EcoDensity]], suggest that the strategy does not account for enough citizen input in planning measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New growth-management experiments in Canada|last=Robinson|first=Pamela|publisher=Planning for climate change: strategies for mitigation and adaptation for spatial planners|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vancouver]] has become one of the most popular cities in the world to live as it offers breathtaking mountain views and access to numerous beaches.  As Vancouver was awarded the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], which led to the development of “Millenium Water” along the South Eastern portion of [[False Creek]] which became the site for the [[Olympic village 2010|Olympic Athlete Village]].  This project boasted European-styled walkways, [[green roof]]s and [[sustainability]] characteristics.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.millenniumwater.com|title=Vancouver's last waterfront community|last=Millenium Water|first=|date=2008|website=|access-date=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No low-income housing was provided with this project and one-bedroom condos starting price was $500,000.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  In an effort to reduce [[Environmental issue|ecological impacts]], the project promoted a [[habitat restoration]] project whereby leftover dirt was used to create an island for bird nesting.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  In 2006, water squatters, people living in boats in [[False Creek]] waters, were evicted in an effort to clean up the area.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  The [[False Creek]] redevelopment was advertised as a park-like nature for new residents and tourists and promoted as a space for leisure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The intemperate rainforest: nature, culture and power on Canada's west coast|last=Braun|first=Bruce|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars suggest that there is a disconnect between the promotion of environmental discourses and issues of equity which results in a [[class conflict]] over space in the city.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  Although Vancouver is a highly desirable place to live, the promotion of sustainability through policies ignores provision of much needed affordable housing allocations.

'''Favorlang''' is an extinct [[Formosan language]] closely related to [[Babuza language|Babuza]].

Although Favorlang is considered by Taiwanese linguist [[Paul Jen-kuei Li]] to be a separate language, it is nevertheless very closely related to Babuza. In fact, the name ''Favorlang'' is derived from ''Babuza''.{{sfnp|Li|2003|p=3}} Alternatively, Favorlang may also have represented a dialect of Babuza at an earlier stage, since Favorlang was documented in the mid-17th century, while Babuza was documented only around the turn of the 20th century by Japanese linguists.{{sfnp|Li|2003|p=5}}

==Phonology==
Favorlang has gone through the following sound changes. Except for the *t, *s, *Z &gt; {{IPA|/t/}} merger, all of these sound changes are shared by the five Western Plains languages Taokas, Babuza, Papora, Hoanya, and Thao.{{sfnp|Li|2003|p=6}}

#Partial loss of *R, *j, including the loss of final *-y and *-w

==Syntax==
Case markers include:{{sfnp|Li|2003}}
*ja 'nominative marker'
*ta 'personal name marker'
*o, no 'oblique (genitive and accusative, common noun)'
*i 'oblique (personal noun)'
*de 'locative'
*i 'directional'

Agent-focus verbal affixes include:{{sfnp|Li|2003|p=11}}
;Agent-focus
*-um- ~ -umm- (after consonant-initial verb stems) or um- ~ umm- (before vowel-initial verb stem except i-)
*-im-, -em- (lexically conditioned)
*m-
*p-

;Past tense (AF)
*-in-umm-, in-umm
*m-in-
*-in-

;Future tense (AF)
*Reduplication of the first stem syllable

;Imperative (AF)
*-a

Non-agent-focus verbal affixes are:{{sfnp|Li|2003|p=11}}
*-an 'locative focus'
*-en, -in, -n 'patient focus'
*ipa- ... -a 'imperative (non-agent-focus)'
*-in-, in- 'past tense (non-agent-focus)'
*ino- 'future tense (non-agent-focus)'

When -in- and -umm- appear together in a word, -in- usually precedes -um- ~ -umm-, as in Ilokano, Bontok, and some Dusunic languages in Sabah (Rungus Dusun and Kimaragang Dusun). Occasionally, -umm- precedes -in- in several Favorlang lexical forms, but this is not very common.

==Pronouns==
All of the following personal pronouns are free forms. All genitive pronouns end with -a.

==History==

[[Mauritania]]'s [[health care]] infrastructure in the early 1980s consisted of a central hospital in [[Nouakchott]], twelve regional hospitals, a number of health clinics, maternal and child care centers, dispensaries, and mobile medical units to serve the countryside. All facilities suffered from a lack of equipment, supplies, and trained personnel. The ratio of people to hospital beds was 2,610 to one. The ratio of people to [[physician]]s was 13,350 to one. This ratio represented an improvement over the 1965 figure of 36,580 to one and was better than that of some of Mauritania's neighbors.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;Berry, LaVerne. "Medical Care". In [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/mrtoc.html ''Mauritania: A Country Study''] (Robert E. Handloff, editor). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (June 1988). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 Mauritania's largest medical facility was the 500-bed government-run hospital in Nouakchott. Staffed by Mauritanian and expatriate [[physician|doctor]]s, it lacked supplies and properly maintained equipment. Other facilities included the National Health Center, built in 1977 for the study of disease prevention and methods of public health care education, and the National School of Nurses and Midwives, founded in 1966 to train [[nurse]]s, [[midwive]]s, and [[Paramedic|paramedical personnel]].&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

In general, health standards were quite low, and many [[infectious disease]]s were endemic. Contagious diseases (such as [[measles]] and [[tuberculosis]]) and respiratory disorders were more prevalent in northern arid regions, whereas [[malaria]], [[guinea worm infection]], and [[schistosomiasis]] were more common in the [[Senegal River Valley]]. The desert tended to be a healthier environment than the more tropical south, but several major diseases were common to all areas of the country. [[Typhoid]], [[poliomyelitis]], [[hepatitis]], and a variety of parasitic illnesses also affected the population. In late 1987, the [[World Health Organization]] issued warnings about [[cholera]], and outbreaks of both [[yellow fever]] and [[Rift Valley fever]] were reported in the extreme southern part of Trarza Region around Rosso. Contagious and infectious diseases were rampant in the kébés surrounding major towns, cities, and villages.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

In the mid-1980s, a mass [[vaccination]] campaign for children under five years of age was under way. The program, aimed at reducing infection from poliomyelitis, diphtheria, pertussis, and several other diseases, was reportedly meeting with some success. [[Malnutrition]] remained widespread, especially in children. The long-term [[drought]] and the consequent drop in food production exacerbated this problem during the early 1980s. According to a 1987 report by the [[United States Agency for International Development]], between 40 percent and 70 percent of children under the age of five had experienced moderate to severe malnutrition. The degree of malnutrition varied according to the success or failure of local crops, and some slight improvement was noted in early 1987.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

==Maternal and child healthcare==
The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Mauritania is 550. This is compared with 712.2 in 2008 and 1295.4 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 118 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 35. In Mauritania the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is 3 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women 1 in 41.&lt;ref name="SOWMY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/report/home.html|title=The State Of The World's Midwifery|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hot Blood''''' is a 1956 [[CinemaScope]] film starring [[Jane Russell]] and [[Cornel Wilde]].

==Plot==
Marco Torino ([[Luther Adler]]), king of the gypsies in southern California, is terminally ill. He wants his younger brother to succeed him, but Stephano ([[Cornel Wilde]]) is determined to become a dancer instead.

After turning a potential employer against him, Marco arranges a marriage for his brother to Annie Caldash ([[Jane Russell]]), a sexy gypsy. Stephano angers her father Theodore ([[Joseph Calleia]]) and brother Xano (James H. Russell) by resisting Annie's charms and refusing to marry her. Stephano loved the blonde Velma ([[Helen Westcott]]).

Annie comes up with a scheme. Her father wants her to be paid a rich dowry from Stephano's, then run off before the marriage. Stephano's brother is trying to raise money for a trip to "the promised land." She persuades Stephano to stage a phony wedding at which she will faint during the ceremony, whereupon they will split the dowry and teach their greedy relatives a lesson. But it is Stephano whom she ends up fooling, by going through with the marriage.

An angry Stephano leaves with Velma, finding work in cheap dance clubs. He begins to miss Annie. He returns to the gypsy camp to find Marco and her together, surprisingly happy. Mistakenly believing they are now together and pulling a swindle, Stephano objects, but Marco explains that he is merely enjoying the last precious days of his life. Stephano agrees to become the new gypsy king, with Annie his queen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7307">Since the establishment of the [[United Nations Mission in Kosovo]] (UNMIK) in 1999, it has been known to the international community that [[Kosovo]] is a major destination territory for '''human trafficking''', women and young girls trafficked into forced [[prostitution]]. According to [[Amnesty International]], most of women are trafficked from [[Moldova]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.amnesty.ca/amnestynews/view.php?load=arcview&amp;article=1506&amp;c=Children+News Amnesty International - Kosovo: Facts and figures on trafficking of women and girls for forced prostitution in Kosovo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927114238/http://www.amnesty.ca/amnestynews/view.php?load=arcview&amp;article=1506&amp;c=Children+News |date=2011-09-27 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010 Trafficking in Persons Report, Kosovo was identified&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2010|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as  transit and destination country for woman and children, victims of the human trafficking, especially the forced [[prostitution]].

==Origins of Demand==

Human trafficking in Kosovo has seen "a steep rise" since [[NATO]] troops and UN administrators took over Kosovo. According to Amnesty International, NATO servicemen and UN staff "generate 80% of the income" for pimps and human traffickers. UN Department of peacekeeping claimed that "peacekeepers have come to be seen as part of the problem in trafficking rather than the solution". Amnesty found no evidence of criminal proceedings against NATO military personnel in their home countries.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/96000/eur700102004en.pdf Kosovo (Serbia and Montenegro): "So does it mean that we have the rights?" Protecting the human rights of women and girls trafficked for forced prostitution in Kosovo (Amnesty International, 2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Source countries==

Amnesty International reports that, "Some 406 foreign women were assisted by the [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]] in Kosovo between December 2000 and December 2003. According to the IOM, 48 per cent of women who have entered its repatriation program - enabling them to return to their home country - originated from Moldova. Of the remainder, 21 per cent came from Romania, 14 per cent from Ukraine, six per cent from Bulgaria, three per cent from Albania and the remainder from Russia and Serbia proper."&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt;

==Reluctance of Kosovo administration==

2010 Trafficking in Persons Report said "the Kosovo government did not follow the minimal measures to eliminate for the trafficking elimination". This regards to both forced prostitution, and forced begging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/6096713-prostitution-and-human-trafficking-in-kosovo|title=Current Events|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606204200/http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/6096713-prostitution-and-human-trafficking-in-kosovo|archivedate=6 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organ trafficking===
{{Main|Organ theft in Kosovo}}

[[Carla Del Ponte]], the former chief U.N. war crimes prosecutor, claimed in her memoirs, that at least 300 ethnic [[Serbs]] were murdered and their organs stolen by [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] during and after the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="HP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julia-gorin/coverup-on-serbian-organ_b_96272.html|title=Coverup on Serbian-Organ Harvesting: 'Pro-American' Kosovo Prime Minister Thaci Oversaw the Scheme|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims were met with criticism in Albania and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800EFDB1130F937A3575BC0A96F9C8B63&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Serbs%27%20Claim%20of%20Kosovo%20Organ%20Ring%20Is%20Investigated&amp;st=cse Serbs' Claim of Kosovo Organ Ring Is Investigated]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor Vladimir Vukčević claimed there was significant progress in investigation of the case of the [[Kosovo organ theft|yellow house]], located in Northern Albania, where organs were harvested from kidnapped Serbs, non-Albanians from Kosovo, Czech and Russian citizens. Organs were later sold in the black market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2009&amp;mm=12&amp;dd=27&amp;nav_id=64057|title=B92 - News - Prosecutor: Names uncovered in 'yellow house' case|last=|first=|date=|work=B92|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402154741/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2009&amp;mm=12&amp;dd=27&amp;nav_id=64057|archivedate=2 April 2015|deadurl=yes|accessdate=15 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albanian administration of Kosovo denied to cooperate with Serbian and international investigators on the case, but several arrests of medics practicing illegal surgery were made in Kosovo, allegedly in connection to the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.javno.com/en-world/doctors-who-harvested-serbs-organs-arrested_200692|title=Doctors who Harvested Serbs' Organs Arrested?|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926065215/http://www.javno.com/en-world/doctors-who-harvested-serbs-organs-arrested_200692|archivedate=26 September 2009|deadurl=yes|accessdate=15 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10166800|title=BBC News - End of the road for Kosovo organ claims?|work=BBC News|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UN knowledge about human trafficking ===

In February 2011, news site "French24" obtained classified documents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110216-un-confidential-document-kosovo-organ-trafficking-investigation-unmik-eulex|title=Europe - UN knew about Kosovo organ trafficking, report says|work=France 24|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing UN knew within year 2003 about human trafficking of human organs, with some named victims and testiomionials of involved Albanians.

== History ==

The IAC began at a seminar in [[Dakar]] in 1984 with a focus on fighting harmful practices relating to [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM), [[childbirth]], [[nutrition]] and food, [[child marriage|early marriage]]; and promoting traditional practices considered beneficial, such as [[breastfeeding]] and [[infant massage|baby massage]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Comfort Momoh|Momoh, Comfort]].

Estimates indicate that the government has to increase existing prices by an average of 2.5 times to achieve the lower target and by 4 times for the maximum target.&lt;ref name='Turquoise'/&gt; According to the IMF, Iranians can expect the first price hike to lift energy product prices between four and 20 times previous levels, with prices surging even higher eventually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iran-daily.com/1389/7/8/MainPaper/3789/Page/1/index.htm# |title=Cutting Subsidies To Boost Efficiency: Report From IMF Economists |publisher=Iran-daily.com |date=2010-09-30 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Agriculture in Iran}}
According to the plan, the type of consumption (i.e. whether agricultural, industrial and civil) will also be considered when setting energy prices.&lt;ref name='subsidy'/&gt; The subsidy plan will be implemented in proportion with [[Geography of Iran|geographical regions]] because warm regions consume more electricity during summer while cold regions consume more gas during winter. Finally, the time of consumption (i.e. during peak and off-peak hours) and the [[Energy in Iran|consumption demand]] (i.e. whether it is low or high) will be taken into consideration.&lt;ref name="globalpost"/&gt;

===Economic and structural adjustments===

The reforms target one of the major sources of inefficiency and [[distortion (economics)|price distortions]] in the [[Economy of Iran|Iranian economy]], and will likely lead to major restructuring in almost [[economy of Iran#Sectors of the economy|all economic sectors]].&lt;ref name="Turq5"&gt;[http://www.turquoisepartners.com/iraninvestment/IIM-Jan11.pdf Turquoise Partners: Investment Monthly (January 2011)] Retrieved March 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Banking in Iran|banking sector in Iran]] is viewed as a potential [[hedge (finance)|hedge]] against the removal of subsidies, as the plan is not expected to have any direct impact on banks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turquoisepartners.com/iraninvestment/IIM-Oct10.pdf Turquoise Partners: "Iran Investment Monthly" - October 2010].

On the other side, the [[Mining in Iran#Cement|cement industry in Iran]] is one of the [[economy of Iran#Sectors of the economy|economic sectors]] that will be hit the hardest in Iran following of the subsidy reform plan, because many Iranian cement factories are energy inefficient (Notwithstanding possible [[Ministry of Commerce (Iran)|Ministry of Commerce]] adjustment and/or liberalization of commodities prices by the government during implementation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turquoisepartners.com/iraninvestment/IIM-Oct10.pdf|format=pdf|access-date=2018-02-19|publisher=Turquoise Partners|title=Iran Investmnet Monthly|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taxi, delivery and [[truck driver]]s have also been adversely affected by the recent gas price increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/middle-east/101220/iran-subsidy-cuts-economic-sanctions |title=Iran &amp;#124; Economy &amp;#124; Sanctions |publisher=Globalpost.com |accessdate=2011-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts believe that the removal of subsidies is likely to have an adverse impact on the profitability of the [[Iranian automobile industry|automotive sector]] for at least the next 2–3 years.&lt;ref name="Turq5"/&gt;
One major element of pressure on producers is the [[Iranian rial#Value|unchanged exchange regime]] of the [[Central Bank of Iran]], which puts imported products at an advantage by failing to compensate for the relative increase in production costs of domestic producers.&lt;ref name="Turq5"/&gt;

===Second phase===
{{See also|Social class in Iran}}
During the second phase, starting in June 2012, half of the funds from energy and food subsidies will be re-allocated to the people and the remaining 50% will go to the industrial sector. If approved by the Parliament, the government will pay an ''extra'' cash handout of 280,000 [[Iranian rial|rials]]/month to 80% of the general population (i.e. people earning less than $2000/month, which is a comfortable income level in Iran).&lt;ref name=PTV2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://presstv.com/Program/236153.html Second Phase of Subsidy Reform: Concerted efforts of Government and People]. PressTV. Retrieved April 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, it was announced that implementation of the second phase was suspended awaiting further adjustments by the government and because of raising inflation (around 22% as of April 2012). Finally, in fall 2013, the parliament approved a plan to drop 22 million Iranians—the top 30 percent of earners—from the subsidy system instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/content/irans-budget-2014-taking-shape/1840387.html Iran's 2014 Budget Taking Shape].

==Effects and criticism==

===2010===
According to earlier critics, even if half of $20 billion is passed as part of the compensation to the poorer 50% of the [[Demography of Iran|Iranian society]], it will amount to $25 per eligible person per month; "no way near enough to make up for such inflation rates".

Critics say that if the government goes for the top of this range [[Central Bank of Iran#Inflation and monetary policy|inflation]] could rise up to 40% through the economy.&lt;ref name='presstv2'&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lI9zc0QQrc |title=Presstv |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2010-01-09 |accessdate=2010-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Monetary Fund]], however, has predicted a more moderate rise in inflation of just 32 percent.&lt;ref name="RFE/RL"&gt;[http://www.payvand.com/news/10/jun/1083.html RFE/RL/Payvand.com: Sanctions And Iran's Achilles Heel].

[[Ahmad Tavakkoli]], a parliamentarian, accused the government of “violating the law” and “mis-implementing” the plan because it earned 290,000bn rials ($23.6bn) from the cut in subsidies in the first 14 months of its implementation but paid people $36.7bn of compensation in return (he says).&lt;ref name=FT4/&gt;

===2012===
In 2012, Iran's head of the [[Expediency Council]], Ayatollah [[Hashemi Rafsanjani]], criticized the government for failing to reinvest the money it saved by restructuring government subsidies. To compensate, the government says it has allowed producers to [[liberalization|adjust their prices more liberally]] and it has given free loans and energy subsidies in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turquoisepartners.com/iraninvestment/IIM-Jan12.pdf Iran Investment Monthly.] Turquoise Partners, January 2012.

Retrieved February 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, income inequality in Iran has declined by different measures, which may be an effect of the subsidy reforms. For example, the income [[Gini coefficient]] fell from 0.4023 in 2005 to 0.3813 in 2010.&lt;ref name=TT6/&gt; Between February 2011 and February 2012, the government earned 510 trillion rials (some $41.6 billion) by implementing the Subsidy Reform Plan.&lt;ref name=TT6/&gt;

In October 2012, 179 of 240 members of parliament voted in favor of pausing the subsidy reform, because of high inflation (exacerbated by the [[sanctions against Iran]]).&lt;ref&gt;Torbati, Yeganeh.

===2014===
In 2014, Iran started the second phase of its targeted subsidy plan under President [[Hassan Rohani]]. Petrol prices were raised by 75% from 4,000 to 7,000 rials ($0.16 to $0.28) per litre,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/pomegranate/2014/04/iran Iran: Cut those subsidies.

As a consequence, fuel smuggling and [[National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company#Fuel imports|gasoline imports]] increased again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://presstv.com/Detail/2015/09/06/427959/Iran-gasoline-imports-double-in-6-months Iran gasoline imports double in 6 months].

===2015===
Iran's government reported that the second phase of the subsidy reform plan will continue as originally planned.

===2016===
According to the [[Economy of Iran#National economic planning|sixth five-year development plan]] (2016-2021), the subsidy reform plan is to be extended until 2021, eventhough this delay in the implementation runs contrary to the Parliament's ratification of the law on subsidies reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Rouhani presents $262b budget bill to Majlis| work = Tehran Times Social Desk | url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/news/252294/Rouhani-presents-262b-budget-bill-to-Majlis| date= January 18, 2016| accessdate=January 24, 2016| publisher=[[Tehran Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[Iranian Parliament]] approved subsidy cuts to 24 Million Iranians. Under the changes, the government must end monthly cash payments of around $12 a person for many government employees with income above $900 per month and citizens who already receive social welfare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.payvand.com/news/16/apr/1059.html Iranian Parliament Approves Subsidy Cuts To 24 Million Iranians.] RFE/RL. 14 April 2016. Retrieved May 26, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the government is said to be reluctant to comply because this would be "unfair" despite the risk of running large [[Government of Iran#Budget|budget deficits]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tehrantimes.com/news/300761/Gov-says-cannot-cut-cash-subsidies-to-24-million-citizens Government says cannot cut cash subsidies to 24 million citizens]. Tehran Times, 19 April 2016. Retrieved May 26, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently the government has announced that it will scrap the subsidy reform plan because of "inflationary pressures" and replace it with a new plan named "energy management". The new plan aims to set new higher fuel prices (as in the original plan - consequently economize on energy consumption and increase production efficiency).&lt;ref name=IRR&gt;[http://iran-daily.com/News/170018.html Subsidy reform plan problematic]. Iran Daily, October 8, 2016. Retrieved October 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though cash subsidies were intended for 10% of the general population originally, they were given to 90% of the population, mostly because of lack of political will and lack of accurate data on people's income. Those cash handouts "discouraged people to work in rural areas" the government has also argued &lt;ref name=IRR/&gt;, although this claim is not supported by an Economic Research Forum study that found no evidence of labor supply reductions, but did find increases in hours worked among service sector workers, possibly due to business expansions made possible by the increased cash.&lt;ref&gt;[http://erf.org.eg/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1090.pdf] Salehi-Isfahani, Djavad, and Mohammad Mostafavi-Dehzooei (2017) ‘Cash Transfers and Labor Supply: Evidence From a Large-Scale Program in Iran’, ERF Working Paper No. 1090.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joro the Paver''', also known as the '''Bulgarian Jack the Ripper''', is a [[serial rapist]] and murderer from the Konyovitsa neighborhood, who operated in [[Sofia]] in 1968.

In the span of a few months, between 6 and 7 rapes occurred, as a result of which a 69-year-old woman died in hospital. The nickname "Joro the Paver" comes from the [[Pavement (architecture)|paver]] found on the scene, wrapped up in [[handkerchief]] next to one of the victims.&lt;ref&gt;Karolina Tserovska, "[http://archive.is/uIzZ Creepy! The Bulgarian Jack the Ripper is still alive and still stalks women!"], razkritia.com, April 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The deaf and mute Milcho Milanov, from [[Rakita, Sofia Province|Rakita]], was accused of being the perpetrator and arrested by police. Although he was sentenced and spent a significant amount of time in prison, he was later released due to lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Krum Blagov, "[http://paper.standartnews.com/bg/article.php?d=2007-09-29&amp;article=205333 Joro the Paver became a shepherd]", in "Standard", September 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of the 1970s, a new rapist occurred, known as '''"Joro the Paver, the Second"''', who raped 10 victims and committed a double murder. In 1975, the perpetrator Georgi Yordanov was captured, [[sentenced to death]] and subsequently [[executed by firing squad]].

Joro the Paver's true identity remains unknown, and it is also theorised that some rapes in later years have been his doing.

'''Judy Clare Clarke''' (born 1952) is an American [[Criminal defense lawyer|criminal defense attorney]] who has represented several high-profile defendants. She has negotiated [[plea bargain|plea agreements]] that spare her clients the death penalty, as was the case for [[Eric Rudolph]], [[Ted Kaczynski]], and [[Jared Lee Loughner]]. In the case of [[Susan Smith]],  Clarke argued to the jury that ultimately voted against imposing the death penalty.

Raised in [[Asheville, North Carolina]], Clarke is a graduate of [[T.C. Roberson High School]], [[Furman University]] and [[University of South Carolina School of Law]]. Clarke served as executive director of the Federal Defenders of San Diego, Inc. (FDSDI) and the Federal Defenders of the Eastern District of Washington and Idaho. From 1996 to 1997, she served as President of the [[National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers]]. Clarke received the John Frank Award from the [[9th Circuit Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref name=frank&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Kristina|title=Judy Clarke honored for death penalty work|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2015/jul/02/judy-clarke-9th-circuit-award-death-penalty/|publisher=SD Union Tribune|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, she took a leave of absence to serve as co-counsel for [[Susan Smith]], the [[South Carolina]] woman who faced the death penalty in [[South Carolina Circuit Court]] for killing her two sons. Her co-counsel was [[David Bruck]], a friend of hers from law school.&lt;ref name="Smith Trial"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bragg|first1=Rick|title=Arguments Begin in Susan Smith Trial|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/19/us/arguments-begin-in-susan-smith-trial.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her opening statement, Clarke argued Smith was deeply troubled and suffering from severe depression.&lt;ref name="Smith Trial"/&gt; She told the jury: "This is not a case about evil.This is a case about despair and sadness."&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; Clarke, however, conceded that Smith knew what she did was wrong, and it tortured her.&lt;ref name="Smith Trial"/&gt; Clarke pointed out the tragedies in [[Susan Smith]]'s life that included being molested by her stepfather, the suicide of her father and her own suicide attempts—twice when Smith was in her teens.&lt;ref name="Smith Trial"/&gt; The defense's theory of the case was that Smith drove to the edge of the lake to kill herself and her two sons, but her body willed itself out of the car.&lt;ref name="Smith Trial"/&gt; The prosecution, on the other hand, believed Smith murdered her children in order to start a new life with a former lover.&lt;ref name="Smith Trial"/&gt; It only took the jury two and a half hours to convict her of murdering her two sons.

Tommy Pope, the lead prosecutor in the Smith case, argued passionately in favor of sentencing Smith to death.&lt;ref name=ABA/&gt; But the jury ultimately voted against imposing the death penalty.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Neill|first1=Ann|title=Lawyer keeps even the most loathed criminals off death row|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/01/12/arizona.judy.clarke.profile/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope believes that Clarke was able to humanize Susan Smith and help them see that Smith was herself a victim.&lt;ref name=ABA/&gt; Smith was sentenced to life imprisonment with a possibility of parole after 30 years.

After the trial, the judge was impressed by Clarke's work and increased her fee to US$83,000. After paying the taxes, she donated the money to a criminal defense fund.&lt;ref name=ABA/&gt;

===Theodore Kaczynski===
In 1996, Federal Defender Quin Denvir filed papers asking U.S. District Judge [[Garland Burrell]] to appoint Clarke as his co-counsel for [[Ted Kaczynski]] who was accused of seven explosions connected to the [[Unabomber]] and faced the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Associated Press|title=Susan Smith's Lawyer to Join Unabomber Defense|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-07-17/news/mn-25012_1_susan-smith-s-life|website=LA Times|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke and the defense made unsuccessful challenges to the search of Kaczynski's cabin and the statements he made after his capture.&lt;ref name=Crimes&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bailey|first1=Frankie|title=Crimes and Trials of the Century [2 volumes]|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the defense began preparation for an insanity defense, which Kaczynski did not support.&lt;ref name=Crimes/&gt; Kaczynski's brother [[David Kaczynski]] said of Clarke: "She had the ability to develop a relationship with Ted, and that was not one of his gifts. He does not connect easily or well with people."&lt;ref name=ABA/&gt; Moreover, he said, "I thought [that] she understands my brother as a human being who has significant issues and challenges and mental problems, who's done something terrible but is still on the level of a human being."&lt;ref name=ABA/&gt; About the time of jury selection, Kaczynski moved to dismiss his lawyers, but that motion was denied.&lt;ref name=Crimes/&gt; The day before the trial was to begin, Kaczynski pleaded guilty to avoid the death penalty,&lt;ref name=Crimes/&gt; and was sentenced to life in prison without parole, serving his sentence at [[ADX Florence]]. Later Kaczynski was quoted describing Judy Clarke as "a bitch on wheels and a sicko."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/03/judith-clarke-dzokhar-tsarnaev-lawyer|title = Dzhokhar Tsarnaev Has the Most Ferocious Lawyer in America Defending Him|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buford Furrow===
In 2000, she was appointed to represent Buford O. Furrow, the Aryan Nations member, accused of the [[Los Angeles Jewish Community Center shooting]], and the fatal shooting of a Filipino-American postal worker in 1999. Prosecutors dropped the death penalty when the defense documented and charted Furrow's long history of psychiatric treatment for bipolar disorder. In 2001, Furrow pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five life terms.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

===Zacarias Moussaoui===
In 2002, she was appointed co-counsel for 9/11 suspect [[Zacarias Moussaoui]] in [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Text of Moussaoui Hearing|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/transcripts/moussaoui061302.htm|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 13, 2002, Judge [[Leonie Brinkema]] granted Moussaoui's motion to represent himself and allowed the case to move forward. Clarke then served as standby counsel for Moussaoui.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsuonline.weber.edu/forensics/m2.pdf |format=PDF |title=Stanby Counsel's Reply to the Government's Response toCourt's Order on Computer and Email Evidence |publisher=Wsuonline.weber.edu |accessdate=2015-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Judge Brinkema revoked Moussaoui's self-representation, it appears that Clarke acted as a consultant to the defense.&lt;ref name=prof&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hammack|first1=Laurence|title=Low-key W&amp;L law professor Judy Clarke takes on Tucson shooting suspect Jared Loughner's case|url=http://ww2.roanoke.com/275512|publisher=Roanoke Times|accessdate=25 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141225195117/http://ww2.roanoke.com/275512|archivedate=25 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moussaoui ultimately plead guilty, but was spared the death penalty by a jury. He is serving a life sentence without parole at the Federal [[ADX Supermax]] prison in Florence, Colorado, USA.

===Eric Rudolph===
In 2004, after Defense Attorney Robert Jaffe withdrew from the case, she was appointed lead counsel for [[Eric Rudolph]] who was charged in the [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing]] in 1996 and other bombings a year later.&lt;ref name=Spokane&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff Reports|title=Judy Clarke to defend accused serial bomber|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=20040811&amp;id=e2hWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3PIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3393,67547|website=Google News|publisher=The Spokesman-Review - Aug 11, 2004|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke and the defense tried to suppress evidence, but that motion was denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bomb Suspect Evidence Admissible at Trial|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/dec/19/nation/na-briefs19.5|website=LA Times|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the prosecution announced that they would seek the death penalty,  a federal judge also rejected a claim by the defense that prosecutors waited too long to announce they would seek the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Charles Montaldo Crime Expert |url=http://crime.about.com/od/current/a/rudolph.htm |title=Eric Rudolph - The Eric Rudolph Case |publisher=Crime.about.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2005, Rudolph pleaded guilty avoiding the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=US Courts|title=Rudolph's Plea Agreement|url=http://www.alnd.uscourts.gov/rudolph/PleaAgreement.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306085630/http://www.alnd.uscourts.gov/rudolph/PleaAgreement.pdf|archivedate=2007-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently serving life in prison without the possibility of parole at [[ADX Florence]].

===Jared Lee Loughner===
On January 10, 2011, the [[United States district court]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]] assigned Clarke as defense counsel to [[Jared Lee Loughner]], the perpetrator of the [[2011 Tucson shooting|January 8, 2011 Tucson, Arizona shooting]]. The Phoenix Public Defenders' Office had requested that Clarke be retained in order to allow Loughner to receive competent counsel without the possibility of a community-wide [[conflict of interest]] arising from proceedings against him for his alleged role in the shooting.&lt;ref name="NYDN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2011/01/10/2011-01-10_tucson_wants_famed_unabomber_lawyer_judy_clarke_to_defend_shooting_suspect_jared.html?r=news/ |title=Famed 'Unabomber' lawyer Judy Clarke may defend Tucson shooting suspect|publisher=[[New York Daily News]] |date=2011-01-10 |accessdate=2011-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 7, 2012, Clarke brokered a deal sparing Loughner's life in exchange for a guilty plea to 19 counts, including the wounding of then congresswoman [[Gabrielle Giffords]]. Loughner is serving life in prison without parole at the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, MO.

===Dzhokhar Tsarnaev===
On April 29, 2013, Clarke was appointed to the defense team representing [[Boston Marathon bombing]] suspect [[Dzhokhar Tsarnaev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2013/04/court-appoints-jared-loughner-defender-for-accused-162890.html |title=Court appoints Jared Loughner's defense attorney for accused Boston bomber |publisher=Politico |date=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clarke admitted her client's guilt and told the jury that he was responsible for the "senseless, horrific, misguided acts" referring to Tsarnaev's bombing of the Boston marathon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://abcnews.go.com/US/boston-marathon-bombing-inside-dzhokhar-tsarnaevs-defense-strategy/story?id=29405323|title = Boston Marathon Bombing: Inside Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's 'It Was Him' Defense Strategy|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A federal jury convicted Tsarnaev of all 30 charges against him and found him responsible for the deaths of the three people killed in the 2013 attack and the killing of an MIT police officer three days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lavoie|first1=Denise|title=Tsarnaev's lawyer faces perhaps her biggest challenge yet|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/tsarnaevs-lawyer-faces-perhaps-her-biggest-challenge-yet/|website=seattletimes.com|publisher=Seattle Times|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 15, 2015, a federal jury sentenced him to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seelye|first1=Katharine|title=Dzhokhar Tsarnaev Gets Death Penalty in Boston Marathon Bombing|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/16/us/dzhokhar-tsarnaev-death-sentence.html|website=nytimes.com|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Representation style and views===
In a speech at [[Loyola Law School]], Clarke in essence said that her clients—no matter how horrible the crimes they are accused of committing—are real people, not monsters, and that she tries to understand what caused them to do it.&lt;ref name=ABA/&gt; She opposes capital punishment.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/us/11defender.html |title=Loughner's Lawyer Is Called a Master Strategist |publisher=The New York Times |author=William Glaberson |date=2011-01-10 |accessdate=2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Justin Lee sex scandal''' involves a Taiwanese man, Justin Lee ({{zh|c=李宗瑞|=Li Zongrui}}; born 1985), who was convicted of nine rapes, during which he had drugged women and then recorded the sexual assaults.

Lee is the son of former Yuanta Financial Holding Co board member Lee Yueh-tsang, and known for his presence at attending fashion parties and nightclubs. In 2011 two sisters filed police report against Lee. During the investigation, the police discovered recorded files on Lee's computer and arrested him in November 2012. Prosecutors said that since August 2009, Lee had been drugging women or getting them drunk in luxury nightclubs around Taiwan, before taking them to his home to rape them while unconscious. Lee fled Taipei and was on the run for 23 days before turning himself in.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.asiaone.com/news/crime/jail-term-justin-lee-over-unauthorised-filming-can-be-commuted-fine-instead?nopaging=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2013/09/04/388061/Justin-Lee.htm |title=Justin Lee gets 18 years' prison for sex assault |newspaper=[[The China Post]] |date= |accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/entertainment/22-years-jail-for-sexual/800446.html |title=22 years' jail for sexual assault involving Taiwanese starlets and models|accessdate=September 11, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905225721/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/entertainment/22-years-jail-for-sexual/800446.html |archivedate=September 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[File:Kiwi holding kiwi.jpg|upright|thumb|A Kiwi holding a [[kiwi]]]]
'''Kiwi''' ({{IPAc-en|k|iː|w|iː}}) is the nickname used internationally for [[New Zealanders|people from New Zealand]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=the definition of kiwis|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/kiwis|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DOC1"/&gt; as well as being a relatively common self-reference.&lt;ref name="glossary"/&gt; Unlike many demographic labels, its usage is not considered offensive; rather, it is generally viewed as a symbol of pride and [[Term of endearment|endearment]] for the people of New Zealand.&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt; The name derives from the [[kiwi]], a native [[flightless bird]], which is a [[National symbols of New Zealand|national symbol]] of New Zealand. Until the [[First World War]], the kiwi represented the country and not the people; however, by 1917, New Zealanders were also being called "Kiwis", supplanting other nicknames.

==History==
===Representing the nation===
The kiwi has long had a special significance for the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Māori people]], who used its skin to make [[Māori traditional textiles|feather cloaks]]  (''kahu kiwi'') for chiefs.&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jock|last= Phillips|title=Kiwi - Kiwi and people: early history|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|date=July 2012|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/kiwi/page-4|access-date=4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bird first came to European attention in 1811 when a skin ended up in the hands of a British Museum zoologist, [[George Shaw]], who classified it as a type of [[penguin]] and portrayed it as standing upright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early impacts|url=https://www.kiwisforkiwi.org/about-kiwi/threats/people/early-impacts/|publisher=The Kiwi Trust|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phillips|first1=Jock|title=Early European engraving|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/artwork/10186/early-european-engraving|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After early sightings by Europeans the kiwi was regarded as a curiosity; in 1835 the missionary [[William Yate]] described it as "the most remarkable and curious bird in New Zealand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yate|first1=William|title=An account of New Zealand and of the formation and progress of the Church Missionary Society’s mission in the northern island|date=1835|publisher=Seeley and Burnside|location=London|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1900s cartoonists began to use the kiwi as a representation of New Zealand. For example, in a 1904 ''New Zealand Free Lance'' cartoon a plucky kiwi is shown growing to a [[moa]] after a rugby victory of 9–3 over a British team.&lt;ref name="kiwi cartoons"&gt;{{cite web|title=First use of kiwi as unofficial national symbol?|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/page/first-use-kiwi-unofficial-national-symbol|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=17 August 2017|date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, ''[[The Westminster Gazette]]'' printed a cartoon of a kiwi and a [[kangaroo]] (representing Australia) going off to a colonial conference.&lt;ref name="kiwi cartoons"/&gt; [[Trevor Lloyd (artist)|Trevor Lloyd]], who worked for ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', also used a kiwi to represent the [[All Blacks]] rugby team, but he more often drew a moa.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt; Other symbols for New Zealand at this time included the [[silver fern]], a small boy and a young lion cub.&lt;ref name="kiwi cartoons"/&gt; But until the [[First World War]] the kiwi was used as a symbol of the nation rather than the people of New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;

===Representing the people===
[[File:Roundel of New Zealand.svg|thumb|200px|[[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] (RNZAF) roundel, featuring a red kiwi in silhouette]]
In the early-20th century New Zealanders—including soldiers and All Blacks players—were referred to internationally as "En Zed(der)s",&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt; or "Maorilanders" (referring to the Māori people and their historical contribution to the country).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Jock|last= Phillips|title= The New Zealanders - Maorilanders|publisher= Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|date= March 2009|url= http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/the-new-zealanders/5 |accessdate= 27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These terms were still being used near the end of the First World War of 1914-1918. However, although New Zealand soldiers were often described as [[Digger (soldier) | "Diggers"]] or as "Pig Islanders",&lt;ref&gt;
The ''Oxford Dictionary of New Zealand English'' (1997) records the use of "pig-islander" from 1909.
&lt;/ref&gt;
by 1917 they were also being called "Kiwis".&lt;ref name="Phillips" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/TheBush/NativeBirdsAndBats/Kiwi/5/en |title= Kiwi - A kiwi country: 1930s–2000s |publisher= Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |date= 2011-05-24 |accessdate= 2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The image of the kiwi had appeared on military badges since the South Canterbury Battalion used it in 1886,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Phillips|first1= Jock|title= South Canterbury Battalion badge|url =http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/object/10189/south-canterbury-battalion-badge|website= www.teara.govt.nz|publisher= Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate= 4 June 2017|language= en|date= 24 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several [[regiment]]s took it up in the First World War. "Kiwis" came to mean the men of New Zealand regiments.&lt;ref name="Phillips" /&gt; The nickname is not thought to have originated as a reference to the physical attributes of the New Zealand servicemen (i.e. implying they were short and stocky or nocturnal like the bird). It was simply that the kiwi was distinct and unique to the country.&lt;ref name="Phillips" /&gt; Its prominent use on the New Zealand regiments' insignia also made for easy association.&lt;ref name="origins"&gt;{{cite web|last1= Norah|first1= Laurence|title= Kiwis, Poms and other naming mysteries|url= http://www.findingtheuniverse.com/2010/12/kiwis-poms-and-other-naming-mysteries.html|publisher= Finding the Universe|accessdate= 4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Jock|first1= Phillips|title= RNZAF Harvard|url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/10191/rnzaf-harvard|publisher= Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|date= 24 September 2007|accessdate= 4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nickname eventually became common usage in all war [[Theater (warfare)|theatres]].&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt; 
[[File:Bulford, England. Chalk Kiwi from Postcard, c.1919.jpg|thumb|left|200px| Chalk kiwi above the town of [[Bulford]], executed in 1919]]
After the end of the First World War in November 1918, many New Zealand troops stayed in Europe for months or years awaiting transport home. At [[Sling Camp]], near Bulford on [[Salisbury Plain]] in [[Wiltshire]], New Zealand soldiers carved a [[Bulford Kiwi| chalk kiwi]] into the nearby hill in early 1919.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1443438 Kiwi Chalk Figure above Bulford Camp] "Members of the Canterbury, Otago and Wellington Battalions under Captain Harry Clark created a chalk figure of a kiwi bird in the nearby hillside in April-June 1919 by removing 12in of top soil and replacing it with chalk pebbles. The kiwi was designed by Sergeant Major Percy Blenkarne, a drawing instructor in the New Zealand Army Education Corps."

[[File:Kiwi polish black.jpg|thumb|200px|A can of [[Kiwi (shoe polish) |Kiwi shoe polish]]]]
An Australian [[boot polish]] called ''[[Kiwi (shoe polish) |Kiwi]]'' was widely used in the imperial forces. [[William Ramsay]], a developer of the product, named the polish in honour of his wife's birthplace, New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt; Beginning in 1906, Kiwi Shoe Polish eventually became widely sold in the UK and the US, and the symbol became more widely known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Brooks|first1= Miki|title= Lessons From a Land Down Under: Devotions from New Zealand|publisher= Lulu|isbn= 9780557098842|pages= 3–4|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JI-NBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3|language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Australian National Dictionary]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |editor-first= Bill|editor-last= Ramson|title= Australian National Dictionary|publisher= Oxford University Press Australia &amp; New Zealand|year= 2008|url= http://australiannationaldictionary.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; also gives the first use of the term "Kiwi Kids" and "Kiwis" in 1917, to mean Australian army recruits who had ''kiwied up''; in other words, they had highly-polished boots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1= Christine |last1= Franzen|first2= Laurie|last2= Bauer|title= Of Pavlova, Poetry, and Paradigms|publisher= Victoria University Press|year= 1993|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hm-hXVgYBaEC&amp;pg=PA16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Second World War]] of 1939-1945 the term gradually became attributed to all New Zealanders, and today throughout the world they are referred to as Kiwis, as well as often referring to themselves that way.&lt;ref name="DOC1"&gt;{{cite web|title= Kiwi|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/native-animals/birds/birds-a-z/kiwi/|website= www.doc.govt.nz|publisher= New Zealand Department of Conservation|accessdate= 4 June 2017|language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glossary"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current usage==
Spelling of the word ''Kiwi'', when used to describe the people, is often capitalised, and takes the [[plural]] form ''Kiwis''. The bird's name is spelled with a lower-case ''k'' and, being a word of [[Māori language|Māori]] origin, normally stays as ''kiwi'' when pluralised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plurals in te reo Māori|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/about_us/what-we-do/our-publications/style-guides/style-manual/maori-language.aspx|publisher=Statistics New Zealand|accessdate=17 August 2017|language=en-nz|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045202/http://www.stats.govt.nz/about_us/what-we-do/our-publications/style-guides/style-manual/maori-language.aspx|archivedate=18 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, "two Kiwis" refers to two people, whereas "two kiwi" refers to two birds. This linguistic nicety is well exemplified by the [[Bank of New Zealand|BNZ]] Save the Kiwi Conservation Trust, which uses the slogan "Kiwis for kiwi".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kiwis for kiwi|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/kiwis-for-kiwi|website=www.doc.govt.nz|publisher=New Zealand Department of Conservation|accessdate=4 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not usually considered to be a [[derogatory term]].&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt; In an official context, "Kiwi" has been used in the name of government services and state-owned enterprises, such as [[KiwiBuild]], [[KiwiSaver]], [[KiwiRail]] and [[Kiwibank]].

{{Lebanese people}}

'''Lebanese Ecuadorians''' are [[Ecuadorian]]s who are descended from migrants from [[Lebanon]]. There are approximately 98,000&lt;ref name=iloub&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theidentitychef.com/2009/09/06/lebanese-diaspora-worldwide-geographical-distribution/ |title=Geographical Distribution of the Lebanese Diaspora |work=The Identity Chef}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lebanese people and their descendants living in [[Ecuador]]. 

==Migration history==
Migration from [[Lebanon]] to [[Ecuador]] started as early as 1875.&lt;ref name="ElUniverso"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.eluniverso.com/2006/07/30/0001/14/A8D3581669B84C3188E1877EE5560D5E.html|title=La libanesa, una colonia con historia desde 1875|last=Torres Chang|first=Carlos|date=2006-07-30|accessdate=2010-01-10|periodical=El Universo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early impoverished migrants tended to work as independent sidewalk vendors, rather than as wage workers in agriculture or others' businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|2000|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though they emigrated to escape Ottoman Turkish oppression, they were called "Turks" by Ecuadorians because they carried Ottoman passports.&lt;ref name="ElUniverso"/&gt; There were further waves of immigration in the first half of the 20th century; by 1930, there were 577 Lebanese immigrants and 489 of their descendants residing in the country, primarily at [[Quito]] and [[Guayaquil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Almeida|1997|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demography==
The number of Lebanese descendants in Ecuador is not too clear. A 1982 estimate from Lebanon's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated 20,000, while another private estimate from 1986 put it as high as 97,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Almeida|1997|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; They reside mostly in [[Quito]] and [[Guayaquil]]. They are predominantly of the [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christian]] [[Catholic]] faith.

==Notable people==
{{Main|List of Lebanese people (Ecuador)}}
People of Lebanese background are very well represented in business and politics of the country. Some of them have reached the presidency and vice-presidency of Ecuador. Their prominence in politics provoked some backlash, with one politician warning of the "Bedouinization" of Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|2000|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Julio Teodoro Salem]] was President for a short interim period in May 1944 before election of [[José María Velasco Ibarra]]. 
*[[Abdalá Bucaram]] was elected President from August 10, 1996 to February 6, 1997. However he was highly unpopular and Parliament dismissed him because of "mental disability". He was accused also of embezzlement of public funds and replaced by [[Rosalía Arteaga]]. 
*Yet a third President of the Republic was [[Jamil Mahuad]]. He served from August 10, 1998 to January 21, 2000 when he was forced to resign after a week of demonstrations by indigenous Ecuadorians and a military revolt led by Lucio Gutiérrez.
*[[Alberto Dahik]], a Finance Minister and member of the Ecuadoran. He was a running mate of [[Sixto Durán Ballén]] and upon victory in the elections, served Vice Presidency to Sixto Durán Ballén for period 1992 to 1995

The following is a partial list of [[United States]] cities and towns in which a majority (over 50%) of the population is [[Asian American]] or [[Asia]]n, according to data from the [[United States 2010 Census|2010 Census]] for California and New Jersey and [[United States 2000 Census|2000 Census]] for other states. This list does not include cities in which, according to the 2000 Census and 2010 Census, merely a plurality (as opposed to a majority) of the residents are Asian American. The list below is organized by state and, within each state, by population size. The percentage of each city's population that is Asian American is listed in parentheses next to the city's name.

[[Image:Manchot 01.jpg|thumb|Two [[New York City|New York]] [[Central Park Zoo]]'s male [[chinstrap penguin]]s, similar to those pictured, became internationally known when they coupled and later were given an egg that needed hatching and care, which they successfully did.&lt;ref name="Central Park Zoo's gay penguins"&gt;Smith (February 7, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
For these birds, there is documented evidence of '''[[homosexual behavior in animals|homosexual]] or [[transgender]] behavior''' of one or more of the following kinds: [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], [[courtship]], [[affection]], [[pair bond]]ing, or [[parenting]], as noted in researcher and author [[Bruce Bagemihl]]'s 1999 book ''Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity''.

According to Bagemihl, [[Animal sexual behavior]] takes many different forms, even within the same [[species]] and the motivations for and implications of their behaviors have yet to be fully understood. Bagemihl's research shows that homosexual behavior, not necessarily [[sex]], has been documented in about 500 species as of 1999, ranging from [[primates]] to [[Acanthocephala|gut worms]].&lt;ref name="Two Hundred Years "&gt;Bagemihl (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Biological Exuberance: Animal"&gt;Harrold (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homosexuality in animals]] is seen as controversial by [[Social conservatism|social conservatives]] because it asserts the naturalness of [[Human sexuality|homosexuality in humans]], while others counter that it has no implications and is nonsensical to equate animal behavior to [[morality]].&lt;ref name="The Animal Homosexuality Myth"&gt;Solimeo (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Defending A Higher Law"&gt;Solimeo (2004b)&lt;/ref&gt; Animal preference and motivation is always inferred from behavior. Thus homosexual behavior has been given a number of terms over the years. The correct usage of the term ''homosexual'' is that an animal ''exhibits homosexual behavior'', however this article conforms to the usage by modern research&lt;ref&gt;Bagemihl (1999) pages 122-166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roughgarden (2004) pp.13-183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vasey (1995) pages 173-204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sommer &amp; Vasey (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; applying the term ''homosexuality'' to all sexual behavior ([[copulation]], [[genitals|genital]] stimulation, [[mating|mating games]] and sexual [[Display (zoology)|display behavior]]) between animals of the same sex.

==Culture==
Modern Macanese culture can be best described as a Sino-Latin culture. Historically, many ethnic Macanese spoke [[Macanese language|Patuá]], which is a [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]-based [[creole language|creole]] and now virtually extinct.  Many are fluent in both [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Cantonese]].  The Macanese have preserved a distinctive [[Macanese cuisine]].

== History ==
===The Portuguese Period===
[[File:The Macanese, Miguel António de Cortela.jpg|thumb|''The Macanese, Miguel António de Cortela''. Attributed to [[Lam Qua]], early to mid-19th century.]]
Macau was founded circa 1557 by Portuguese merchants with permission of the Chinese Canton governor and later the emperor. Since its beginning, Macau has not been conquered and until the attacks of the Dutch in 1604, it didn´t have a military garrison. Portuguese culture dominates the Macanese, but Chinese cultural patterns are also significant. The community acted as the interface between Portuguese merchant settlers or ruling [[Colonialism|colonial]] government - Portuguese from Portugal who knew little about Chinese - and the Chinese majority (90% of population) who knew equally little about the Portuguese. Some Macanese had paternal Portuguese heritage.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Some were Portuguese men stationed in Macau as part of their military service. Many stayed in Macau after the expiration of their military service, marrying Macanese women.

Rarely did Chinese women marry Portuguese; initially, mostly [[Goans]], [[Sinhalese people|Ceylonese/Sinhalese]] (from today's Sri Lanka), Indochina, Malay (from [[Malacca]]), and Japanese women were the wives of the Portuguese men in Macau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|year=2003|location=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kwZwFh1aqFUC&amp;pg=PR10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote= |volume=|page=x|title=Taste of Macau: Portuguese Cuisine on the China Coast|isbn=962-209-638-7|author=Annabel Jackson|edition=illustrated|accessdate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=João de Pina-Cabral|title=Between China and Europe: person, culture and emotion in Macao|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GglrUksvCUcC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=portuguese+slave+tanka&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r-NOT8r_JoaQ0QGBhYzdDQ&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=portuguese%20slave%20tanka&amp;f=false|accessdate=2012-03-01 |type= |edition=illustrated|series= |volume=Volume 74 of London School of Economics monographs on social anthropology|date= |year=2002|month= |origyear= |publisher=Berg|location= |language= |isbn=0-8264-5749-5|page=39 |at= |chapter= |quote=To be a Macanese is fundamentally to be from Macao with Portuguese ancestors, but not necessarily to be of Sino-Portuguese descent.

[[File:Macanese senhora.jpg|thumb|Macanese ''senhora'' in her traditional attire, the dó, early 20th century]]
During the late-nineteenth century, and increasingly during [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]]'s fascist [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime, the upbringing of most Macanese fell along the lines of the continental Portuguese - attending Portuguese schools, participating in mandatory military service (some fought in Africa) and practising the [[Catholic]] faith. As recently as the 1980s, most Macanese had not received formal Chinese schooling and, hence, could speak but not read or write Chinese.  Spoken [[Cantonese]] was largely familiar, and some spoke the language with a regional accent (鄉下話) - acquired largely from their mothers or amahs.&lt;ref&gt;Of interest is the role that the amah plays in Macanese society. It is well known that local Cantonese women were often hired by the Catholic Church in Macau to act as wet-nurses for orphans in the Church's charge. These women were also hired by Macanese families to clean their houses, cook meals and care for their children. It is in these early encounters that Macanese children are first introduced to the Cantonese language and culture. Families are known to keep long-standing friendships with their amahs and in the past, young brides would sometimes bring them along with them to their new home. Nowadays Filipinas fill the role. c.f. Soares, José Caetano (1950), ''Macau e a Assistência (Panorama médico-social)'', Lisbon, Agência Geral das Colónias Divisão de Publicações e Biblioteca, and Jorge, Edith de (1993), ''The Wind Amongst the Ruins: A childhood in Macao'', New York: Vantage Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Portuguese settlement in Macau - dating from 1557 - included a strong Catholic presence, a number of Chinese converted to Catholicism. A large number of Macanese can trace their roots to these New Christians. Many of these Chinese were assimilated into the Macanese community, dropping their Chinese surnames and adopting Portuguese surnames.  In the collective Macanese folk memory, there is a little ditty about the parish of St. Lazarus Parish, called 進教圍, where these Chinese converts lived: 進教圍, 割辮仔, 唔係姓念珠 (Rosário)　就係姓玫瑰 (Rosa). Hence, it is surmised that many Macanese with surnames of [[Rosario (surname)|Rosario]] or [[Rosa (surname)|Rosa]] probably were of Chinese ancestry.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}  Because of this, there are many Eurasians carrying Portuguese surnames Rosario, Rosa, and others that are not Portuguese-blooded may be mistaken by others as Portuguese-blooded, and Eurasians of Portuguese blood carrying Portuguese surnames trace their Portuguese blood on maternal side.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} A visit to the St Michael the Archangel Cemetery (Cemitério São Miguel Arcanjo), the main Catholic cemetery near the St. Lazarus Parish, would reveal gravestones with a whole spectrum of Chinese and Portuguese heritage: Chinese with Portuguese baptised names with or without Portuguese surnames, Portuguese married with Chinese Catholics, and so on.

The mid-twentieth century, with the outbreak of the Second World War in the Pacific and the retreat of the Republic of China to Taiwan, saw the Macanese population surge through the re-integration of two disparate Macanese communities: the Hong Kong Macanese and the Shanghai Macanese.  With the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong in 1941, the Macanese population, escaping the occupation, made its way to Macau as refugees. These Macanese, including many skilled workers and civil servants, were fluent in English and Portuguese and brought valuable commercial and technical skills to the colony. Another distinct group within the Macanese community is the 上海葡僑; the descendants of Portuguese settlers from Shanghai that acted as middlemen between other foreigners and the Chinese in the "Paris of the Orient". They emigrated from Shanghai to Macau in 1949 with the coming of the Red Guard. Many spoke little Portuguese and were several generations removed from Portugal, speaking primarily English and Shanghainese, and/or Mandarin. The Shanghai Macanese carved a niche by teaching English in Macau. Only the children and grandchildren of Shanghainese settlers who were born and raised in Macau have the ability to speak Portuguese.

A number of Macanese also emigrated during the [[Carnation Revolution]] and Macau's return to the People's Republic of China, respectively. Most potential emigrants looked to Brazil, Portugal's African territories, and Australia.

===The Chinese Period===
Beginning with the post-1974 independence of other Portuguese colonies and hastened by Macau's return to China, the Macanese community began to lose its Portuguese heritage. Many Portuguese, Eurasians and Chinese who were loyal to the Portuguese left after its return to China. Of those that remained, many children - including those of pure Chinese descent - switched from Portuguese- to English-medium high school education, particularly as many of parents recognised the diminishing value of Portuguese schooling. Many Macanese people of mixed ancestry since Portuguese time never speak Portuguese and speak only Cantonese as first language; if other Macanese people of mixed ancestry speak Portuguese, they speak it as second language, thus affected by Cantonese accent. At the same time, Macanese of pure Portuguese descent are also learning Cantonese and Mandarin to be able to communicate to non-Portuguese-speaking Chinese. Today, most Macanese - if they are still young enough - would go back to study to read and write Chinese.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Many see a niche role for fluent speakers of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Cantonese]] and [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} [[Code-switching]] between Portuguese, Cantonese, and Mandarin among native speakers is common. In the 1980s Macanese or Portuguese women began to marry men who identified themselves as Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SDvOJRO7qu8C&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=portuguese+women+marry+chinese#v=snippet&amp;q=portuguese%20women%20marry%20men%20ethnically%20chinese&amp;f=false|title=InteBetween China and Europe: person, culture and emotion in Macao|author=Gary João de Pina-Cabral|year=2002|publisher=Berg Publishers|location=|page=165|isbn=0-8264-5749-5|accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Macanese identity dispute ==
There is some dispute around the exact meaning of "Macanese". An essay by Marreiros offers a broad spectrum of "Macanese types", ranging from Chinese Christian converts who live among the Portuguese to the descendants of old-established families of Portuguese lineage; all groups are integrated into this historically legitimated group.&lt;ref name=marr94/&gt; As a general rule, it is not a point of reference, however for ethnic Chinese living and raised in Macau; they often identify themselves as Chinese or Chinese from Macau; "Macanese" is applied to those people who have been acculturated through Western education and religion and are recognized by the Macanese community as being Macanese.&lt;ref&gt;There are many pretenders who have claimed to be Macanese. Although one's ethnic identity is a personal project, ultimately, any claim to a Macanese identity is either accepted or refuted by the already existing Macanese community on criteria dependent upon shared cultural heritage and collective notions (these criteria shift with each emerging generation). As Turner and later Bhabka suggest, identity is a layering of experiences unraveled through contact with others and is only decipherable within the social sphere. There are limits to a Macanese identity, and Pina-Cabral and Lourenço (op. cit.), offer a broad-based definition delineated by family and community acceptance as two basic denominators for a tentative definition of the Macanese.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the basis for Macanese ethnic affiliation has been the use of the Portuguese language at home or some alliances with Portuguese cultural patterns and not solely determined along hereditary lines. Pina-Cabral and Lourenço suggest that this goal is reached "namely through the Portuguese-language school-system".&lt;ref&gt;Pina-Cabral and Lourenço (1993). Tentatively, language is not so much a key determinant to Macanese identity, but rather the alliance with the Portuguese cultural system that knowing Portuguese entails. A great number of Macanese families of Hong Kong only speak English but are still considered Macanese. Along these lines, knowledge of Portuguese is preferably - but not absolutely necessary - for a Macanese identity. It should be mentioned, however, that Portuguese language use is only one of several criteria that are used by other Macaense to determine other Macanese, not the sole determinant.&lt;/ref&gt; Often, due to the close proximity to the Portuguese, the Macanese closely identify themselves with Portuguese nationals as opposed to Chinese in the bi-cultural and bi-racial equation. In practice, however, being Macanese is left up to how individuals categorize themselves.  

In the mid-1990s, there had been attempts by the Macau government to redefine the Macanese to be everyone born in Macau regardless of ethnicity, language or nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Sovereignty at the Edge: Macau &amp; the Question of Chineseness]]|first= Cathryn H. |last=Clayton |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2alTUjb6SX8C&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 110]&amp;ndash;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2alTUjb6SX8C&amp;pg=PA113 113] |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |date=2010|isbn=978-0674035454 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the re-integration of Macau with the People's Republic of China in late 1999, the traditional definitions are in a state of re-formulation.&lt;ref&gt;Shifting, not in the sense of deconstruction of the identity definition, but a re-formulation of the definition as each rising generation dictates. The current generation is looking toward the transition and finding themselves deciding upon their cultural/identity alignments. However, as Pina-Cabral and Lourenço explain, this is the nature of the Macanese community.&lt;/ref&gt; Given the shifting political climate of Macau, some Macanese are coming to recognize and identify closer with a Chinese heritage.

This ambiguity might be reduced by the further adjective [[Creole peoples|crioulo]].

The '''Mafa''', also called Mahayana, are an ethnic group localized in northern [[Cameroon]] and eastern [[Nigeria]].

== History ==
It is understood that the Mahayana, a Mafa tribe, migrated from [[Roua, Cameroon|Roua]] and [[Suède, Yaounde, Central (Cameroon)|Sulede]] (which is west of Durum ([[Mofu]] proper)), towards the northwest. &lt;ref name = "Bulahay Groups"/&gt; The Bulahay tribe, meanwhile, migrated to the west, alongside the southern borders of the present Mafa territory.  Eventually they also migrated northwards where they mixed with the Mafahay,  becoming the present Mafa.&lt;ref name = "Mandara Mountains Homepage"&gt;[http://www.mandaras.info/MafaMatakam.html Mafa - The Mandara Mountains Homepage]. Retrieved June 03, 2013, to 16: 31 pm.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demography ==
Total population estimates vary between  82,100&lt;ref name = "Les groupes humains"&gt;[Boulet, J., ‘Les groupes humains’, Le nord du Cameroun, des hommes, une region, Collection Memoires 102, (ed) Jean Boutrais, ORSTOM, Paris 1984:119&lt;/ref&gt; and 150,000.&lt;ref name = "mandaras"&gt;Muller-Kosack, G., [http://www.mandaras.info/MandarasPublishing/NoCryForDeath.rtf|No Cry for Death]. Mandaras Publishing (www.mandaras.info). London, 1999 (4p)&lt;/ref&gt; Hallaire&lt;ref&gt;Hallaire, A., Paysans montagnards du Nord-Cameroun, Les monts Mandara, ORSTOM Editions, Collection, Paris 1991 26 Fig 5&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that population density in the area is between 99 and 140 inhabitants per square kilometer.&lt;ref name = "Bulahay Groups"&gt;[http://www.mandaras.info/BulahayGroups.html Bulahay Groups]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lavergne,&lt;ref&gt;Lavergne, G., ‘Le pays et la population Matakam’, Bulletin de la Société d’Edudes Camerounaises 7, September 1944:7-73.&lt;/ref&gt;  the Mafa are split into two tribal sections, being the ‘Mafa proper’ (referred to as Maf-Mafa or ‘Mafahai’), and the ‘Bulahai’. The Mafas live in the central part of the [[Northern Mandaras]],  which is a region formed by the North area of the [[Far North Region (Cameroon)|Mokolo Plateau]] and the mountains of northern [[Mokolo]]. The Mafa society is divided into several cantons: Moskota; Koza; Gaboua (Koza district);  ([[Communes of Cameroon|Mokolo arrondissement]]). There are also about 1,000 Mafa in Kughum ([[North]], [[Nigeria]]).&lt;ref name = "Les groupes humains"/&gt; 
 
The Mafa belong to the [[Chadic languages|Chadic]] language grouping. They speak the [[Mafa language]],&lt;ref name = joshuapromaf&gt;[http://unreachedresources.info/people-profile.php?peo3=13201&amp;rog3=CM  The Joshua project]. Retrieved June 03, 2013, to 16: 56 pm.&lt;/ref&gt;
with three different dialects: Mafa-west, Mafa-centre and Mafa-east. Together with many other languages of other African peoples (such as [[Wuzlam language|Wuzlam]] ([[Uldeme language|Uldeme]]), [[Muyang language|Muyang]] and [[Ɗugwor language|Ɗugwor]] ([[Duguri language|Dugur]])), they form part of the Mafa-south sub-group.&lt;ref name =  "Mandara Mountains Homepage"/&gt;

The population is 15.00% [[Muslim]], 50% [[Christian]] and 35% [[tradition followers]]. The Christian population is composed of [[Catholics]] (60%) and [[Protestants]] (40%).&lt;ref name = joshuapromaf/&gt;

==Agriculture==

Traditional Mafa agriculture depends on a wide assortment of soil management techniques. The hillsides are secured with constructed terraces, that according to an author, "have reached a state of exceptional perfection"&lt;ref name="Zaal2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred Zaal|title=Sustainable Land Management in the Tropics: Explaining the Miracle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bIbeCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT145|date=1 April 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-04776-6|pages=145–}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Other ethno-engineering procedures include :

* small-scale irrigation
* canalization 
* drainage system 

Likewise, agriculturists in the mountains practice an extensive variety of soil fertility management procedures, including :

* crop rotation and mixed cropping
* agro-forestry
* biomass
* nutrient management

They also use an intensive livestock-raising system in the management of the fertility of their soil. Livestock includes smallstock and a limited amount of cattle. In the dry season between December and May, livestock is allowed to roam free, so he can consume crop residues and leaves of wild bushes.

During the farming season, livestock is put in a pen and fed. The manure that accumulates in the stables is collected, preserved and finally spread out in the fields at the end of the dry season. The intensity and ingenuity of Mafa nutrient management is illustrated by the fact that termites are used to digest harvest residues and then fed to the Chickens.&lt;ref name="Zaal2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred Zaal|title=Sustainable Land Management in the Tropics: Explaining the Miracle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bIbeCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT145|date=1 April 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-04776-6|pages=145–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Fiji}}

The '''monarchy of Fiji''' arose in the mid-nineteenth century when native ruler [[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]] consolidated control of the Fijian Islands and declared himself King or paramount chief of [[Fiji]] ({{lang-fj|Tui Viti}}). In 1874, he voluntarily ceded sovereignty of the islands to Britain, which made Fiji a [[Crown colony]] within the [[British Empire]]. After nearly a century of British rule, Fiji became a [[Dominion]], an independent sovereign state within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] with [[Elizabeth II]] as [[head of state]]. After a second military [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|coup in 1987]], Fiji became a republic, and the monarchy was ended. Nevertheless, the [[Great Council of Chiefs]] recognised Elizabeth II as ''Tui Viti'' or the traditional Queen of Fiji, but the position is not one of a constitutional, or otherwise legal nature. The Great Council of Chiefs was disestablished in 2012 by decree. Elizabeth II does not use the title, and the Fijian government does not recognise it.

==Origins==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
In the late 1840s, the [[Vunivalu of Bau|''Vunivalu'' or ruler of]] [[Bau Island|Bau]], [[Tanoa Visawaqa]] (died 1852) declared himself ''Tui Viti'', which translates as "King of Fiji" or "paramount chief of Fiji". It is recorded that he used the title in recognition of his political influence over other chiefly states, for instance in [[Rewa Province|Rewa]], where he was "Vasu-Levu" (high ranking matrilineal descendant), [[Naitasiri Province|Naitasiri]], [[Cakaudrove Province|Cakaudrove]] and [[Lau Islands|Lau]], where he had forged strong alliances, and in [[Macuata Province|Macuata]], where he was able to effectively intervene in the feuds of the ruling family to establish an ally as ''Tui Macuata'' or "paramount chief of Macuata". As the title was never a traditional one, and as Bauan influence did not extend to the whole of Fiji, Tanoa Visawaqa's claim to it is often viewed by historians as self-proclaimed, driven by astute ambition which would to a certain degree work to the advantage of his successor, his son [[Seru Epenisa Cakobau|Seru Epenisa]], known as "Cakobau", or "destroyer of Bau".

Seru Cakobau ruled the short lived [[Kingdom of Fiji]] (1871–1874) as ''Tui Viti'', and the title became synonymous with him. Even before the formation of the Kingdom of Fiji, Seru Cakobau is recorded to have used the title. In 1854, as ''Tui Viti'', he attended a court conducted by Captain Denham of HMS ''Herald'' into Cakobau's alleged misdeeds against the Europeans. The usage of the title brought both advantages and disadvantages to the holder. Advantages in that it allowed Cakobau to deal with the Europeans and control the new wealth and technology they brought with them and disadvantages in being held responsible for the actions of Fijians beyond his realm of control. It was the latter in tandem with his claims to the title and European claims for monetary compensation that would contribute to his reasons for ceding Fiji to Britain in 1874. Even though Seru Cakobau was not recognised by all Fijians as King of Fiji, his use of the title, and its recognition by many of the leading chiefs, led European settlers and foreign powers to treat him as a native king.

==Absorption into the British Crown==

Though Seru Cakobau was considered equal but not necessarily superior by his fellow chiefs, he was recognised as king by the [[Western world|Western powers]]. In 1874, he was the lead signatory on the deed of cession which granted Britain sovereignty over the islands, and it was his efforts that brought Fiji under the guidance of the [[British Empire]]. After cession in 1874, all historical records refer to Seru Cakobau as only ''Vunivalu'' of Bau, or ''Ratu'' Seru Cakobau, indicating the title ''Tui Viti'' was lost when the sovereignty of Fiji was ceded to the [[British Crown]]. When ''Ratu'' Seru Cakobau signed the deed of cession he also presented his prized war club to [[Queen Victoria]], the British monarch, as a symbol of his submission and loyalty. The presentation of the war club, named ''Na Tutuvi Kuta nei Radi ni Bau'' (The sleeping cover of the Queen of Bau) refers to the traditional duty of the ''Vunivalu'' to protect the principal wife of the Rokotui Bau and can again be taken to mean Cakobau accepted protection from Queen Victoria and her successors. Neither Queen Victoria nor her successors ever used the title of ''Tui Viti'', but the Fijians considered them Kings and Queens of Fiji in the traditional sense of ''Tui Viti'', not just in the Western sense of Sovereign.&lt;ref&gt;Mataitoga, Isikeli (1991). "Constitution-Making in Fiji: The Search for a Practical Solution", ''Victoria University of Wellington Law Review'', vol. 21, pp. 221–238&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dominion==
In 1970, 96 years of British rule came to an end, and Fiji became an independent [[sovereign state]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

The queen's realms were all independent from one another, and the Queen acted independently in each realm, but they shared the same person as monarch. As a [[constitutional monarchy]], executive power was held by a prime minister, usually the leader of the majority party in an elected legislature. The prime minister was appointed by the [[Governor-General]].

==Republic==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
In 1987, [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|a series of coups]] resulted in the overthrow of the elected government of Fijian Prime Minister [[Timoci Bavadra]], and the declaration of a republic. The first coup, in which Bavadra was deposed, took place on 14 May 1987. The Fijian [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] ruled the coup unconstitutional, and the Queen's representative, [[Governor-General of Fiji|Governor-General]] ''Ratu'' Sir [[Penaia Ganilau]], unsuccessfully attempted to assert executive power. He opened negotiations, known as the Deuba Talks, with both the deposed government, and the [[Alliance Party (Fiji)|Alliance Party]], which most [[Fijians|indigenous Fijians]] supported. These negotiations culminated in the Deuba Accord of 23 September 1987, which provided for a government of national unity, in which both parties would be represented under the leadership of the Governor-General. Fearing that the gains of the first coup were about to be lost, [[Sitiveni Rabuka]] staged a second coup on 25 September, abolished the monarchy on 6 October, and declared Fiji a republic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiji.gov.fj/publish/historical_timeline.shtml Historical timeline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913082754/http://www.fiji.gov.fj/publish/historical_timeline.shtml |date=13 September 2009 }}, Fiji Government, retrieved 20 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Penaia Ganilau resigned as Governor-General on 15 October 1987, and Fiji was expelled from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] for a decade.

Ten years later, after constitutional talks and an election, Sitiveni Rabuka, who instigated the two military coups, presented a [[tabua]], a tooth of a [[sperm whale]], to Queen Elizabeth during the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government]] conference in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland. This gesture from Rabuka, by now the [[Prime Minister of Fiji]], is a traditional sign of profound respect and was given as an apology for having broken his oath of allegiance to her as an officer of the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|Military of Fiji]]. The agreed [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|Constitution of 1997]] provided for a [[President of Fiji|President]] as [[Head of State]] of a Fijian republic, with the President chosen by the [[Great Council of Chiefs]], a formal body of mostly hereditary chiefs.

==Current position==

Though Fiji has been a republic since 1987 and was [[Commonwealth of Nations#Suspension|suspended from the Commonwealth]] for a second time in 2009, until 2012 the Queen's effigy was still displayed on [[Fijian dollar|Fiji's currency]] and the [[Queen's Official Birthday]] remained a public holiday. In 2012, [[Frank Bainimarama]]'s government abolished the official birthday holiday,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/auckland/news/nbint/932411065-fiji-scraps-queen-s-birthday-holiday|publisher=[[NewstalkZB]]|date=31 July 2012|title=Fiji Scraps Queen's birthday holiday}}&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced the Queen's image on banknotes and coins with indigenous flora and fauna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2012-12-03/anger-over-plan-to-remove-queen-from-fiji-money/1055346|title=Anger over plan to remove Queen from Fiji money|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reservebank.gov.fj/default.aspx?page=currencyCollectibles |title=Fiji's new flora and fauna design banknotes and coins |publisher=[[Reserve Bank of Fiji]] |date=25 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727125521/http://reservebank.gov.fj/default.aspx?page=currencyCollectibles |archivedate=27 July 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[St Edward's Crown]] still forms part of the badges of the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|military]] and the [[Law enforcement in Fiji|police]]. The Queen and the royal family retain widespread affection among the Fijian people, and there have also been sporadic public debates on whether to return to a constitutional monarchy. The motto of the republic remains "Fear God and honour the King" (or "Queen"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiji.gov.fj/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=645&amp;Itemid=196#t4 "Our country: National symbols"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323104147/http://www.fiji.gov.fj/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=645&amp;Itemid=196 |date=23 March 2010 }}, government of Fiji&lt;/ref&gt;) ({{lang-fj|Rere vaka na kalou ka doka na Tui}}), which was adopted by Cakobau in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Whitney (1980). ''Flags and Arms across the World'', London: Cassell, p. 250, {{ISBN|0-304-30659-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Coat of arms of Fiji|country's coat of arms]] remain unchanged.

In 1998, the Great Council of Chiefs debated Elizabeth II's role as "supreme tribal chief".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4914307.html "Fiji votes to make Queen 'supreme tribal chief'"], Robert Keith Reid, ''The Independent'', 20 July 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, on behalf of the Council, the Council's chairman, ''Ratu'' [[Epeli Ganilau]], the son of ''Ratu'' Sir [[Penaia Ganilau]], declared that Elizabeth II was still the traditional Queen or paramount chief of Fiji or ''Tui Viti'', even though this position no longer conferred any constitutional prerogatives and it was "not widely known that she is the paramount chief of Fiji in the traditional sense; only some of the council members remembered her status".&lt;ref name="RNZI_2883"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=2883 |title=Fiji chiefs say Britain's Elizabeth still Queen of Fiji |date=19 November 2002 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/11/20/1037697676385.html "Queen still chief of Fiji"], Sydney Morning Herald, 20 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=3&amp;art_id=qw103777506083B212 "Britain's queen is still the 'king of Fiji'"], IOL, 20 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the members of the Council were descendants and blood relatives of the chiefs who ceded Fiji to [[Queen Victoria]], Elizabeth's great-great-grandmother, in 1874. Consequently, while Fiji is a republic, a monarch or paramount chief was recognised by traditional tribal structures.

As Queen Elizabeth II has made no official claim to the ''Tui Viti'' title, and it is not officially recognised by the current ''de facto'' Fijian government, it remains dormant in usage. When broached on the subject of restoration by [[Sitiveni Rabuka]] during a meeting with the Queen in 1997, her response was simple: "Let the people decide".&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.aol.ca/video-detail/still-the-queen-of-fiji/216172822999532682/?icid=VIDURVNWS02 "Still the Queen of Fiji?"], AOL Canada, retrieved 23 November 2009 {{dead link|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After another [[2000 Fijian coup d'état|coup in 2000]], further [[2005–06 Fijian political crisis|political tension]] led to a [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|fourth coup in 2006]].

In the last two decades since Fiji became a republic, the question on restoring the monarchy has not abated. The current Prime Minister [[Frank Bainimarama]] displays portraits of the Queen and her consort, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], above his office desk. He has also described himself as a monarchist: "I'm still loyal to the Queen. Many people are in Fiji. One of the things I'd like to do is see her restored as our monarch, to be Queen of Fiji again."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.today/20121215204228/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/despot-for-diversity/story-e6frg6n6-1225705471653 Despot for diversity], ''[[The Australian]]'', May 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; To date, no referendum has ever been called to decide on the question of restoration.

'''Ngurimi''' (Ngoreme) is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]] of [[Tanzania]]. Ngoreme is spoken in the Serengeti District of the [[Mara Region]] of north-west Tanzania by some 55, 000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Dustin, Anna-Lena Lindfors, Louise Nagler, Mark Woodward, and Richard Yalonde. 2007. A Sociolinguistic survey of the Bantu languages in Mara Region, Tanzania . Dar es Salaam: SIL International.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main dialects of Ngoreme - a northern dialect and a southern dialect - which maintain mutual intelligibility.

== Phonology ==
Ngoreme shares a vowel inventory with the majority of the Mara languages: ''/i e ɛ a ɔ o u/''. However, Ngoreme has an asymmetrical vowel inventory, with 7 phonemic vowels in nouns but only 5 vowels (/i ɛ a ɔ u/) in verbs.

== Nominal system ==
In common with many [[Bantu languages]], Ngoreme nouns typically consist of a noun stem, a noun class prefix and an augment (or pre-prefix) vowel. Augment vowels are invariable but the vowels that occurs in the noun class prefixes commonly exhibit variant forms as determined by vowel harmony. Ngoreme has 19 noun classes, with the classes 1-10 exhibiting regular singular/plural pairings, class 11 is attested, as is class 12 which contains [[diminutive]]s, class 14 is also found. Class 15 contains verb nouns (or infinitives), class 16, 17 and 18 are also attested and are the locative classes. Class 19 is the plural diminutive class whilst class 20 is a (singular) [[augmentative]] class.

'''''Ni Hao, Kai-Lan''''' ({{zh|s=你好, 凯兰|t=你好，凱蘭|p=Nǐ hǎo, Kǎi Lán!}}; ''Hello, Kai-Lan'') is an American animated ([[Anime-influenced animation|anime-influenced]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/arts/television/15davi.html|title=Ni Hao, Kai-lan! - China - Animation - TV|first=Michael|last=Davis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) [[interactive]] [[children's television series]] that premiered on [[Nickelodeon]] in the United States on November 5, 2007. It also premiered on the Canadian television channel [[Treehouse TV]].

''Ni Hao, Kai-lan'' is based on the childhood memories of the show's creator [[Karen Chau]] growing up in a bicultural (Chinese-American) household.  "'''Ni hao'''" means "Hello" in Mandarin, and '''Kai-Lan''' is the Chinese name Chau was given at birth, which was later anglicized to Karen. It was also based on the classic short series ''Downward Doghouse.''

==Premise==
In the Season 1 finale, it is stated that they all live in California. ''Ni Hao, Kai-lan'' introduces its viewers to the [[Mandarin Chinese]] language, along with elements of [[Culture of China|Chinese culture and values]], and intergenerational families (e.g., Kai-lan and her relationship with Ye Ye).

Episodes generally feature breaking the [[fourth wall]], 11 minutes of interactivity,&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&amp;article_no=3588|title=Ni Hao, Kai-lan: Tigers and Dragons and Mandarin Lessons|author=Strike, Joe|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|date=2007-12-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627225527/http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&amp;article_no=3588|archivedate=2009-06-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a target word that is repeated multiple times,&lt;ref name="weiss interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=21597|title=Toon Zone Interviews Nick SVP Teri Weiss About "Ni Hao, Kai-lan"|author=Liu, Ed|publisher=Toon Zone|date=2008-01-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420113112/http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=21597|archivedate=2008-04-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  a few words of Mandarin Chinese vocabulary, one or more of Kai-lan's friends having a negative emotional response to some action or activity (problem), Kai-lan thinking out loud (observation), cause-and-effect problem solving, and before saying goodbye (at the end of each episode), Kai-lan says, "You make my heart feel super happy!" Later installments added Kai-lan saying this phrase in Mandarin after she said it in English: "Ni rang wo hao kai xin!"

He provides Kai-lan with gentle guidance, leading her to find her own answers, at her own pace. (Kai-lan's parents and other grandparents are not known.) He can play the tuba. He also enjoys picking apples and making dumplings for Kai-lan and all her animal friends. 

Ye-Ye is voiced by Clem Cheung and Ben Wang.

===Rintoo===
Rintoo is a rambunctious yellow-and-black young tiger with a lisp who often acts before he thinks. He likes to play rough but when it comes to his friends, he is always willing to compromise. He is an avid fan of dragons and racing racecars. Even though he is with Hoho most of the time, his actual best friend is Tolee besides Kai-Lan. He plays the xylophone in Kai-Lan's music group.

Rintoo is voiced by Jack Samson.

===Tolee===
Tolee is a gray koala who loves pandas and fruit (especially apples, bananas, and pineapples). He is intelligent and always thinks before he acts and sometimes worries too much, but he never lets that stop him from having a great time with his friends. Kai-Lan and her friends can always rely on him for good ideas. Tolee also has a stuffed panda he affectionately named Pandy, and Tolee loves Pandy so much he cannot imagine being without him. He is the vocalist in Kai-Lan's music group.

Tolee is voiced by [[Khamani Griffin]].

===Hoho===
Hoho the white monkey is the youngest of Kai-lan's friends, so when he participates in activities, he often goes first. He is full of energy and enjoys being the center of attention. Whenever he jumps a spring sound can be heard. He can often be found jumping on his friends' heads or playing his turntables as the DJ in Kai-Lan's music group. Aside from his turntables and his friends, Hoho likes bananas.

Hoho is voiced by Angie Wu.

===Lulu===
Lulu is a pink rhinoceros. She has a red balloon tied around her horn that helps her fly in the sky. Lulu is very energetic and sweet. Lulu's home is a castle in the sky. She is best friends with Kai-Lan. Her instrument is the piano. Her favorite fruit is the lychee. Some of Lulu's favorite games include dancing, playing house, having tea parties, and wearing a fairy outfit.

Lulu is voiced by Beverly Duan.

===Mr. Sun===
At the start of almost every episode, Kai-Lan wakes up Mr. Sun so she can start her day. With the help of the viewer, Mr. Sun rises and showers down smiling sun fuzzies to Kai-Lan and she gets tickled by them. He also knows how to play the French horn, so Kai-Lan and the ladybugs (playing the [[pi-pa]]) join him as a little music group at the beginning of '''Tolee's Rhyme Time''' and later joins Kai-Lan and her friends in the music show.

===The Ants===
In one corner of Kai-Lan's backyard is a teeming mini-metropolis of ants called Ant City. The ants serve very important roles in the community: they deliver mail, they build things, and they love to play with Kai-Lan and her friends. San San is their leader along with his two right-hand ants, Bubu and Fufu.

San San is voiced by [[Zachary Gordon]], Bubu is voiced by Luke Manriquez, and Fufu is voiced by Kyla Rae Kowalewski.

'''Noon''' (''Non, None, Serer-Noon, Serer-Non'') is a [[Cangin language]] of [[Senegal]] spoken in the [[Thiès Region|Thiès]] region (14°47'0"N / 16°55'0"W). There is an estimated population of 10,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/en/atlasmap/language-id-1296.html|title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;''-'' 50,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msu.edu/~dwyer/16-Childs.doc|title=A survey of language death in Africa|website=www.msu.edu|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; speakers worldwide, rendering this language to be vulnerable&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/1754|title=Did you know Noon is vulnerable?|website=Endangered Languages|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.Ethnologue'' reports that it is 84% cognate (and 52%&lt;!--elsewhere says 68%, but this appears to be a cognate figure--&gt; intelligible) with [[Lehar language|Lehar]], essentially a divergent dialect, and 68% cognate with the other Cangin languages.

The [[Serer-Noon|Noon people]] identify themselves ethnically as [[Serer people|Serer]]. However, their language, often called Serer-Noon on the assumption that it is a Serer dialect, is not closely related to the principal language of the Serer population, [[Serer language|Serer-Sine]].

==Status==
Like many of the local languages in Senegal, the Noon language is officially recognized as one of the national languages of country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=snf Ethnologue, Languages of the World. Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orthography==
The Noon language is written using the [[Latin alphabet]]. In 2005, a decree was passed by the Senegalese Government in order to regulate the spelling to ''Noon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Gouvernement du Sénégal, Décret n° 2005-986 du 21 octobre 2005 relatif à l'orthographe et à la séparation des mots en noon.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that there are 47 letters that are used when writing in Noon, listed below (in two sets, for convenience).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/resources/archives/48316|title=Guide d'orthographe de la langue Noon|date=2013-01-29|website=SIL International|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consonants===
The Noon language contains 27 [[consonant]]s. Note that the [[glottal stop]] is not written at the beginning of the word, and it has no separate form for upper-case letters. The pre-nasalized occlusive marking is shown explicitly like in the following symbols, ''mb, nd, ñj, ŋg''.  In addition, the used nasal quality is justified by the enunciation point of the occlusive it precedes.

Noon, like other Senegalese languages, gives the possibility of extensive and varied combinations within its large graphic representation (''ñ, ŋ''). Twin consonants are possible within words between vowels and are noted by two identical letters, such as ''ɓɓ, cc, ff, hh, kk, ll, mm, nn, pp, ss, tt, ww, yy''. However, this excludes the consonants ''b, d, g, j, ɗ, ƴ, ñ'', and those that are pre-nasalized occlusives. Additionally, the "ɗ" letter does not exist in a word as well as in final voiced stops using the letters ''b, d, g'' and ''j''. Also, in Noon, a long vowel is represented by a digraph that is considered a letter, while a geminate consonant is interpreted as a series of two identical letters.
=== Vowels ===
The Noon language contains 20 [[vowel]]s. Dropped vowels (''- ATR'') are symbolized by the letters: ''a, e, i, o, u''; and tense matches (''+ ATR'') are marked with letters possessing diacritics: ''ë, é, í, ó, ú''. Long vowels are represented by two-lettered symbols: aa, ee, ii, oo uu. In the case of tense vowels, only the first letter is marked by a diacritical mark, ''ëe, ée, íi, óo, úu''. Please note, that a long vowel is considered a single letter, represented by a digraph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/resources/archives/48316|title=Guide d'orthographe de la langue Noon|date=2013-01-29|website=SIL International|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capitalization Rules ===
In general, there are three rules regarding capitalization in Noon. Much like other languages, they capitalize letters at the beginning of sentences and names.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/resources/archives/48316|title=Guide d'orthographe de la langue Noon|date=2013-01-29|website=SIL International|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rule 1. An uppercase is used at the beginning of each [[Enunciation|enunciation point]], and after each [[interrogation point]] (question mark), [[exclamation point]], or the beginning of a quotation after a colon.'''

Example: ''Ɓa haydoh këyitcaa hen, ɓa ee'tarica, kúmaandagaa an: «Yugat! Ɗú ɗekoh!» which translates to, 'As soon as they had searched the papers, they gave them to him, and the commander said: "Sit down! Be quiet!"''

'''Rule 2. The first letter of any personal name, family, country, city, etc. are indicated by an uppercase letter.'''

Example: ''Senegaal is indicative of 'Senegal' or Caañaak is indicative of 'Thiès'''

'''Rule 3. For franchise or business names beginning with ''ki-'', the letter that precedes the [[prefix]] ''ki-'' is often uppercased while the prefix itself is lowercased. Although, there is an exception if the prefix ''ki-'' appears in the beginning of a phrase or [[enunciation]] point.'''

Example: ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'kiToŋgol' translates to, 'this year'; Whereas, if the phrase was in the beginning of an enunciation point, it would be rendered 'KiToŋgol' to mean 'This year...'''
== Phonology ==
=== Vowels ===

== Grammar ==
In Noon, the division of words is based on [[Grammar|grammatical rules]] that are inherent in the language. The language undergoes many [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] changes, thus the language treats certain [[morpheme]]s as being part of a single or key word, making them dependent. These morphemes are treated as prefixes that do not carry any independent meaning in itself, but are used for grammatical context.

'''''Ki-'''''

The [[infinitive]] ''ki-'' is [[prefix]]ed to the subject of the [[verb]].

Examples:

''kiñam 'to eat'''

''ki'on 'to give'''

''kilímu 'to be born'''

''kiɗúukool 'to be sick'''

'''''Di-'''''

The [[adverb]] ''di-'' is prefixed. However, when ''bi-'' is used as a [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]], it is written separately.

Example:

''Adverb: tani'in dijëfí' translates to, 'he is much better'''

''Conjunction: tani'in bi jof also translates to, 'he is much better'''

==== Class Markers ====
Class Markers such as wi-,fi-,mi-, etc. are [[prefix]]ed to the subject of the [[adjective]].

Examples:

''kaan fi'as 'a new house'''

''ha'mun yi'as 'a new owner;''

''túuƴ wimórí' 'a beautiful room'''

==== Object Pronouns ====
[[Object pronoun]]s are [[suffix]]ed to a [[verb]] due to [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] changes that appear with most personal object pronouns (with the exception of the 3rd person plural), where the initial [[consonant]] of [[morpheme]] is adapted to the final consonant of the verb. Similarly, other object pronouns are also linked as suffixes when they appear with a [[Preposition and postposition|preposition]]. However, there is an exception with the preposition ''ga-'' which is never suffixed to the verb.

''Examples:''

''hottoo 'he sees me'''

''hottaa 'he sees you' (informal)''

''hotti 'he sees him (a man)'''

''hottíi 'he sees us (but not you)'''

''hottuu 'he sees us (you included)'''

''hottúu 'he sees you' (formal or plural)''

''hotɓa 'he sees them (the men)'''

''hotfa 'he sees it (the house)'''

''hotca 'he sees them (the houses)'''

''Ga- preposition exception:''

''Ñamaa ga! 'Eat it!'''

''yaa tík gaɗa 'the following'''

Furthermore, the same object pronouns are suffixed to prepositions.

Example:

''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Mi hay naraa kitaam.'  translates to, 'I will go with you'''

==== Possessive Pronouns ====
The [[possessive pronouns]] in Noon are [[suffix]]ed to a name that appears after the [[Article (grammar)|definite article]]. The decision to treat these pronouns as suffixes, and not as an independent words that are formed by the preposition ga- followed by the object pronoun, has been made so that the possessive pronouns possess a  complementary distribution. This means, that the names are determined by relational possessive pronouns, or by possessive pronouns, depending on the character's name. Another reason for this suffix is the first person singular form of ''-goo (used in contraction with garoo)'' which appears only in cases of possessive pronouns, and never with the preposition ''ga-.''

Examples:

''kowkiigoo 'my child'''

''kowkiigaraa 'your child' (informal)''

''kowkiigari 'his/her child'''

''kowkiigaríi 'our child'''

''kowkiigaruu 'our child'''

''kowkiigarúu 'your child' (formal or plural)''

''kowkiigaɓa 'their child'''

''towtiigaca 'their fruits'''

Note that the [[Preposition and postposition|preposition]] ''ga-'' is not suffixed to a word. Also note, that when ''ga-'' or ''garoo'' is used in the 1st person singular, it changes the form.

Example:

''Feetaa newin gaɓa. 'They liked the party.'''

''Feetaa newin garoo. 'I liked the party.'''

Possessive pronouns that are relational are suffixed to the noted topic because of [[Morphophonological|morphophonological changes]] that concern the assimilation of the initial [[consonant]] of the pronoun to the final consonant of the name (in the 1st person singular tense or the 1st and 2nd person plural tense).

Examples:

''yaakkoo 'my big brother'''

''yaakfu 'your big brother' (informal)''

''yaakci 'his big brother'''

''yaakkíi 'our big brother'''

''yaakkuu 'our big brother'''

''yaakkúu 'your big brother' (formal or plural)''

''yaakɓa 'their big brother'''

The [[definite articles]] ''-ii, -um'' and ''-aa'' are [[suffix]]ed, in [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]] with a class marker, to an indicative name or place.

Examples:

''hal halii 'the door (here)'''

''oomaa oomaanaa 'the child (there)'''

''kow kowkaa 'the child (there)'''

''pe' pe'faa 'the goat (there)'''

''misoo' misoorum 'the headscarf (near to you)'''

''tuhaan tuhaantii 'the bongos (here)'''

Additionally, definite articles are suffixed to [[adjective]]s in the same manner that names are suffixed in Noon.

Examples:

''túuyaa wi'aswaa 'the new room (there)'''

''kaanfii fimo'tafii 'the beautiful home (here)'''

''kubaaykii jisúusúusjii 'the black puppy (here)'''

''tediktaa tihoo'tataa 'the large trees (there)'''

==== Subordinate Clauses ====
In Noon, the suffix -(n)aa is indicative of a [[subordinate clause]] and -ɗa is indicative of a relative subordinate clause. The reasons for treating these [[morpheme]]s as [[suffix]]es are due to morphophonological changes to ''- (n)aa,'' and their grammatical functions in words for both ''- (n)aa'' and ''-ɗa'' . The insertion of a nasal [[vowel]] in a word placed at the ending of a proposal indicates that the morpheme is a [[Phonology|phonological]] word with the word that it precedes. We also see [[Glottalic consonant|glottalized]] consonants and certain [[nasal consonant]]s change in subordinate clauses. Both morphemes ''- (n)aa'' and ''-ɗa'' carry grammatical meaning rather than lexical meaning as they indicate the entire proposition, describing its function in the sentence.

Examples:

''Fu hayaa, ɗuu ñam. 'We will eat, when you come' (worded in the form: 'When you come, we will eat.')''

''Fu hot kowkaanaa, wo'aari ya hay. 'If you see his son, tell him to come.'''

However, unlike ''-ɗa'', which is a [[morpheme]] indicative of a proposal, there is an [[adverb]] ''ɗa'' which can translate to ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'alone'&lt;nowiki/&gt;''  or '''like this/that''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'. You can note the difference between the two forms, as the adverb is always separated, since it carries an independent [[Lexical semantics|lexical meaning]].

Example:

''Maŋgoocaa ñamsi ɗa. 'The mangoes are eaten alone'''

==== Interrogative Clauses ====
In Noon, the [[suffix]] ''-(n)e'' is used to indicate general [[interrogative clause]]s.

Examples:

''Fu hay kihay kuwise? 'Are you coming tomorrow?'''

''Fu hotin kowkiigoone? 'Have you seen my child?'''

For an alternative interrogative clause, the suffix ''-(n)oo'' is used.

Examples:

''Fu waa' ki'an músúnoo miis? 'Would you like water or milk to drink?' (written in the form: 'Would you like to drink water or milk?'''

''Fu en ga foohoo ga ɗuuƴ? 'Are you outside or inside?'''

In [[vocative case]]s, the suffix ''-(n)óo'' is suffixed to a name.

Example:

''Bañóo! translates to, 'Hell!'''

'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''

== Numeral System ==
Noon has a [[Quinary decimal|quinary-decimal system]]. The alternative form for 'one', wɪtnɔː, is only used in the counting process. Actually, it is very common for the Noon to use pure [[Wolof language|Wolof]] or [[French language|French]] when counting above the number from 100 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mpi-lingweb.shh.mpg.de/numeral/Noon.htm|title=Noon|website=mpi-lingweb.shh.mpg.de|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuverz is a Miami-based company focused on developing content and solutions to help older adults live longer and independent lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diariolasamericas.com/florida/plataforma-internet-busca-asesorar-la-tercera-edad-miami-n3958195 "Plataforma en internet busca asesorar a la tercera edad en Miami"], at Diario Las Américas, 27 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The company’s stated mission is to fight the "infantilization of older adults" and the "medicalization of their homes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.menafn.com/1094882116/Nuverz-Announces-Launch-of-Answers-and-Advice-Platforms&amp;src=RSS "Nuverz Announces Launch of Answers and Advice Platforms"], at MENAFN Press, 02 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Diario de Las Americas, the company is part of the growing [[Aging in Place]] movement. The trend promotes the idea that people should “live in one's own home and community safely, independently, and comfortably, regardless of age, income, or ability level.” According to the expert Michael Saunders, Nuverz is considered a reference for designers in this area. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.di-conexiones.com/adulto-mayor-tercera-edad/ "Adulto mayor"], at di-conexiones&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saundersaccess.ca/resources "Resources"], at Michael Saunders&lt;/ref&gt;

== Platforms ==

The company publishes a Q&amp;A site called Nuverz Answers, where users ask questions and offer answers on issues related to Aging-in-Place and aging in general. Their other platform, Nuverz Advice, contains articles by Ageist founder, David Harry Stewart . &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agei.st/the-founders/ "David Harry Stewart"], at Ageist&lt;/ref&gt;

== Founders == 

Among the founders is entrepreneur [[Sonia Gil]]. The founding Editor-in-Chief for all the company’s content is Lucero Uribe. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/lucero-nuverz-510 "Lucero Uribe"], at The Huffington Post&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patagonia, Inc.''', originally Chouinard Equipment, is an American clothing company that markets and sells [[outdoor]] clothing.  The company was founded by [[Yvon Chouinard]] in 1973, and is based in [[Ventura, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vcstar.com/business/local/patagonias-child-care-center-serves-employees-and-their-families-35cc0010-cf7e-2c94-e053-0100007f47d-384988121.html|title=Patagonia’s child care center serves employees and their families|last=Nelson|first=Mike|date=July 2, 2017|access-date=3 July 2016|newspaper=[[Ventura County Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After going bankrupt in 1989, the company split into [[Black Diamond Equipment]], selling climbing gear, and the current Patagonia company that sells soft goods. Its logo is the outline of [[Monte Fitz Roy|Mount Fitz Roy]] in [[Patagonia]], South America, which happens to border the two countries of the region: Chile and Argentina.

== History ==
[[File:OutDoor 2018, Friedrichshafen (1X7A9941).jpg|thumb|upright|Mannequin dressed in Patagonia clothing and gear|alt=]]
[[Yvon Chouinard]], an accomplished rock climber,&lt;ref name="Wang"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/206536|title=Patagonia, From the Ground Up|last=Wang|first=Jennifer|website=Entrepreneur|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; began selling hand forged mountain climbing gear in 1957 through his company Chouinard Equipment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.outsideonline.com/2197346/patagonia-archives&lt;/ref&gt; He worked alone selling his gear until 1965 when he partnered with [[Tom Frost]] in order to improve his products and address the growing supply and demand issue he faced.&lt;ref name="patagonia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patagonia.com/us/patagonia.go?assetid=3351|title=Patagonia's History - A Company Created by Climber Yvon Chouinard and his commitment to the Environment (catalog paper, organic and recycled fabrics )|website=www.patagonia.com|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Chouinard obtained [[rugby shirt]]s from [[Scotland]] that he wore while climbing because the collar kept the [[Sling (climbing equipment)|climbing sling]] from hurting his neck.&lt;ref name="patagonia.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303513404577352221465986612|title=Patagonia's Founder Is America's Most Unlikely Business Guru|last=Stevenson|first=Seth|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collared shirts were then designed and implemented into his merchandise line and quickly became the primary product sold.

Chouinard Equipment was forced to file for bankruptcy in 1989 when it lost a series of lawsuits claiming "failure to inform" of safety issues related to usage of climbing hardware including one filed by the survivors of a climber who died in a fall after slipping out of a Chouinard climbing harness. The resultant increases in their product liability insurance were cited by Chouinard as the reason they stopped making climbing gear. The liquidated assets of the climbing gear side were purchased for $900,000 by Chouinard's longtime partner, Peter Metcalf, and reorganized as [[Black Diamond Equipment]]. Yvon Chouinard retained the profitable soft goods (clothing) division of the company which had already been rebranded as Patagonia.

Starting in April 2017, certain Patagonia merchandise that is in good condition can be returned for new merchandise credits. The used merchandise gets cleaned and repaired and sold on their "Worn Wear" website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/patagonia-return-old-clothes_us_588f8066e4b02772c4e81e8d|title=Patagonia Just Made Another Major Move To Save The Earth And Your Wallet|last=Feldman|first=Jamie|date=2017-01-30|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-03-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==

Patagonia considers itself an "activist company."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patagonia.com/the-activist-company.html Patagonia, "The Activist Company"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental===
Patagonia commits 1% of its total sales or 10% of its [[profit (accounting)|profit]], whichever is more, to environmental groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmentalism: Environmental &amp; Social Responsibility|url=http://www.patagonia.com/environmentalism.html|website=Patagonia|publisher=Patagonia|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Yvon Chouinard was a founding member of [[One Percent for the Planet]], an organization that encourages other businesses to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=March 29, 2017 |url=http://newfsurfboardnet.com/1-for-the-planet/ |title=1% for the Planet |publisher=Newf Surfboard Net |date= |accessdate=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2013-05-27/business/fl-one-percent-planet-20130527_1_1-percent-one-percent-planet|title=One Percent for The Planet: Businesses commit to donate 1 percent of sales to environmental nonprofits - tribunedigital-sunsentinel|last=Hemlock|first=Doreen|date=27 May 2013|work=Sun Sentinel|access-date=15 September 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics and land preservation===
In February 2017, Patagonia led a boycott of the Outdoor Retailer trade show, which traditionally took place in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], because of the Utah state legislature's introduction of legislation that would transfer federal lands to the state. Patagonia also opposed Utah Governor [[Gary Herbert]] request that the Trump administration revoke the recently designated [[Bears Ears National Monument]] in southern Utah. After several companies joined the Patagonia-led boycott, event organizer Emerald Expositions said it would not accept a proposal from Utah to continue hosting the Outdoor Retailer trade show and would instead move the event to another state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.outsideonline.com/2155931/outdoor-industry-pushes-back-against-utah | title = Moving Outdoor Retailer Isn't About Politics. It's About Money. | date = 8 February 2017 | accessdate = 20 April 2018 | publisher = ''Outside Magazine'' | author = Frederick Reimers }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 6, 2017, Patagonia sued the [[Federal Government of the United States|United States Government]] and [[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]] for his proclamations of reducing the [[Bears Ears National Monument]] by 85% and the [[Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument]] by almost 50%. Patagonia is suing over the interpretation of the [[Article Four of the United States Constitution#Section 3: New states and federal property|Property Clause of the U.S. Constitution]] in which the country vests [[United States Congress|Congress]] with the power to manage federal lands. The company's CEO, Rose Marcario, contends that when Congress passed the [[Antiquities Act|Antiquities Act of 1906]], it did not give any president the power to reverse a prior president's monument designations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://time.com/5052617/patagonia-ceo-suing-donald-trump/|title=Patagonia CEO: This Is Why We're Suing President Trump|first=Rose|last=Marcario|authorlink=Rose Marcario|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=December 6, 2017|accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Gelles.

===Down===
In 2012, UK animal activist group [[Four Paws]] said that Patagonia used live-plucked [[down feather]]s and downs of [[Force-feeding|force-fed]] geese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.four-paws.org.uk/website/output.php?id=1175&amp;idcontent=2795&amp;language=1 |title=Outdoor Company Patagonia: Down from brutal force-feeding |publisher=Four Paws |accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement on their website, Patagonia denied use of live-plucking but said it had used down procured from the foie-gras industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecleanestline.com/2011/12/the-lowdown-on-down-an-update.html |title=The Lowdown on Down: An Update |publisher=The Cleanest Line |accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of fall 2014, Patagonia said it was using 100% traceable down to ensure that birds were not force-fed or live-plucked and that down is not blended with down from unknown sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patagonia.com/us/patagonia.go?assetid=37607]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.patagonia.com/us/traceable-down&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wool ===
In February 2005, Patagonia's sourcing of wool from Australia was criticized by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] over the practice of [[mulesing]]. Patagonia has since moved its sourcing of wool from Australia to South America and the cooperative [[Ovis 21]]. However, in August 2015 PETA released new video footage showing how sheep were treated cruelly in Ovis 21 farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investigations.peta.org/ovis-lamb-slaughter-sheep-cruelty/|title=Patagonia's 'Sustainable Wool' Supplier EXPOSED: Lambs Skinned Alive, Throats Slit, Tails Cut Off|website=PETA Investigations|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led Patagonia to stop sourcing wool from Ovis 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecleanestline.com/2015/08/patagonia-to-cease-purchasing-wool-from-ovis-21.html|title=The Cleanest Line: Patagonia to Cease Purchasing Wool from Ovis 21|website=www.thecleanestline.com|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, Patagonia released a set of new wool principles that guide the treatment of animals as well as land-use practices, and sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.outsideonline.com/2101871/want-ethically-sourced-wool-buy-patagonia|title=Want Ethically Sourced Wool?

{{evidence law}}
{{Rape}}
A '''rape shield law''' is a law that limits the ability to introduce evidence or [[cross-examination|cross-examine]] [[rape]] complainants about their past sexual behavior. The term also refers to a law that prohibits the publication of the identity of an alleged rape victim.

==Australia==
In [[Australia]], all states and mainland territories have rape shield laws that limit the admission of evidence in criminal proceedings where someone is charged with a sexual offence. The principal aims of these laws are to:
*prohibit the admission of evidence of a complainant’s sexual reputation;
*prevent the use of sexual history evidence to establish the complainant as a ‘type’ of person who is more likely to consent to sexual activity; and
*exclude the use of a complainant’s sexual history as an indicator of the complainant’s truthfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government: ALRC: [http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/20.%20Matters%20Outside%20the%20Uniform%20Evidence%20Acts/rape-shield-laws 20. Matters Outside the Uniform Evidence Acts - Rape shield laws]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
In Canadian criminal proceedings in respect of a sexual assault, section 276(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada restricts the [[Admissible evidence|admissibility]] of evidence that the complainant has engaged in sexual activity, whether with the accused or with any other person. Such evidence "is not admissible to support an inference that, by reason of the sexual nature of that activity, the complainant (a) is more likely to have consented to the sexual activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge; or (b) is less worthy of belief."&lt;ref name=CCOC&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Code of Canada|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-65.html#docCont|website=Government of Canada justice Laws Website|publisher=Government of Canada Ministry of Justice|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law sets down (in sections 276(2) and 276(3)) strict rules and procedures for determining admissibility of such evidence.&lt;ref name=CCOC/&gt;  

In 1992 legislation amended the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] to re-establish this rape shield provision with strict guidelines for when and how previous sexual conduct could be used by a defendant at trial. The reform was enacted by [[Canadian Parliament|Parliament]] after the 1991 ruling, ''[[R. v. Seaboyer]]'' had struck down the previously existing rape shield law (enacted in 1982) as unconstitutional. Bill C-49 amended the Criminal Code provisions that govern the admissibility of evidence of sexual activity; refined the definition of consent to a sexual act; and restricted the [[defense (legal)|defense]] that an accused had an honest but mistaken belief that the accuser had consented. The 1995 [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] judgment in the case of [[British Columbia]] Bishop [[Hubert O'Connor]] (''[[R. v. O'Connor]]'') led to Bill C-46, which limited the production of a complainant's personal counselling records to the defense in sexual offence cases. Bill C-46 was tested in [[R v Mills|''R. v. Mills'']], and upheld by the Supreme Court in 1999.&lt;ref name=StrikingBalance&gt;{{cite journal|url=&lt;!--http://canada.justice.gc.ca/en/dept/pub/jc/vol1/no1/strike.htm--&gt;|title=Striking the Balance in Sexual Assault Trials|journal=Justice Canada|volume=1|issue=1|author=Nicole Baer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000 decision of ''[[R. v. Darrach]]'', the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] upheld the law in a [[legal case|case]] involving former [[Ottawa]] resident Andrew Scott Darrach, who was convicted of sexually assaulting his ex-girlfriend. Darrach was sentenced in 1994 to nine months in [[jail]] for the assault. By a 9–0 decision, the court found that all the rape shield provisions in the Criminal Code are [[constitutional]]. The ruling said forcing the accuser to give evidence would invade her privacy and would "discourage the reporting of crimes of sexual violence." In his appeal, Darrach had argued that he had been denied a fair [[trial]] because he was unable to raise the fact that he mistakenly thought the incident was [[consensual]]. Additionally, Darrach had argued that the law unfairly required him to [[testify]] at his own trial because the trial judge had held an [[evidentiary hearing]] with the jury absent to determine whether an affidavit from Darrach describing his former relationship with the complainant was [[Admissible evidence|admissible]].  Darrach had refused to testify or be cross-examined on the affidavit and the trial judge had therefore ruled this evidence inadmissible.&lt;ref name=darrach&gt;[http://www.rapereliefshelter.bc.ca/learn/resources/supreme-court-upholds-rape-shield-law Supreme Court upholds rape-shield law] Erin Anderssen ''The Globe and Mail'', Ottawa October 13, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;)  The appeal upheld the trial judge's decision.

==New Zealand==
Sections 44 and 44A of the [[Evidence Act 2006]] sets out rules for [[wikt:propensity|propensity]] evidence about a complainant's sexual experience and reputation in sexual cases.&lt;ref name="EvidenceAct2006"&gt;{{cite web |title= Section 44 -- Evidence Act 2006 |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2006/0069/latest/whole.html#DLM393635 |publisher= New Zealand Legislation Online |accessdate= 27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 2006 Act, section 23A of the Evidence Act 1908, as amended by the Evidence Amendment Act 1977, set out these rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Section 23A -- Evidence Act 1908 |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1908/0056/latest/whole.html#DLM142782 |publisher= New Zealand Legislation Online |accessdate= 26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 44 protects complainants in prosecutions for sexual offences from certain questions and evidence about their sexual experience and reputation. The starting point is to exclude evidence or questions that relate to the complainant's reputation in sexual matters or to the complainant's sexual experience with a person other than the defendant. However, the Judge may permit any evidence or a question about that experience if satisfied that it would be contrary to the interests of justice to exclude it because of its direct relevance to the facts in issue or to the question of the appropriate sentence (the ''heightened relevance'' test).&lt;ref name="EvidenceAct2006" /&gt;

Section 44A provides no evidence of a complainant's sexual experience may be offered in a criminal proceeding unless the other parties have been given notice of the proposed statement, or if every other party has waived the notice requirements, or if the Judge dispenses with those requirements. The section also sets out the notice requirements for evidence proposed to be offered in criminal proceedings.&lt;ref name="EvidenceAct2006" /&gt;

Complainants are equally bound by the law, preventing them introducing evidence about their own sexual experience contrary to sections 44 and 44A.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite court |litigants=K (CA640/2016) v R |vol= 2017 |reporter= NZCA |opinion= 336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of a complainant's sexual experience with the defendant is not subject to the heightened relevance test, although it is still subject to the general relevance test in sections 7 and 8 of the Evidence Act. This has proved to be a contentious issue, with the debate mainly centres on the perceived direct relevance of such evidence. Those in support of extending the rule to cover sexual experience with the defendant argue that evidence of previous sexual experience between the complainant and defendant should not lead to an implication that the complainant is more likely to agree to the sexual activity on another occasion. Those opposed argue that the existence of a prior sexual relationship between the complainant and the defendant will often be, or inevitably is, directly relevant.&lt;ref name="LawCom"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/sites/default/files/projectAvailableFormats/EA2.pdf |title= Issues Paper 42 - Second Review of the Evidence Act 2006 |date= March 2018 |publisher= New Zealand Law Commission |accessdate= 29 August 2018}}{{CC-notice|cc=by4|author=the New Zealand Law Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[New Zealand Law Commission|Law Commission]] began its second statutory review of the Evidence Act. In its March 2018 issues paper, it asked several questions about the operation of section 44, especially in light of two court cases:&lt;ref name="LawCom" /&gt;
* ''B (SC12/2013) v R'' [2013] NZSC 151, [2014] 1 NZLR 261 – What admissibility rule should apply to sexual disposition evidence? 
* ''Best v R'' [2016] NZSC 122, [2017] 1 NZLR 186 – Should [[False accusation of rape|false and/or allegedly false complaints]] be treated as evidence of veracity, sexual experience, or as both?

==United States==
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, almost all jurisdictions in the United States adopted some form of rape shield statute. The laws in each state differ in the scope of sexual behavior shielded and time limits of the shield. Many states do not permit any evidence relating to the past sexual behavior of the victim. This encompasses evidence of specific instances of the victim's prior or subsequent sexual conduct including [[expert witness|opinion evidence]] or [[Character evidence|reputation evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;Rape Shield Statutes March 2011—accessed at National District Attorneys Association [http://www.ndaa.org/pdf/NCPCA%20Rape%20Shield%202011.pdf] Retrieved June 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Violence Against Women Act]] of 1994 created a federal rape shield law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/vawa_factsheet.pdf Factsheet: The Violence Against Women Act] from The [[White House]].&lt;/ref&gt; The military has incorporated the rape shield law into Military Rules of Evidence, Rule 412.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defense.gov/pubs/pdfs/Part%20III%20-%20MCREs%20(FINAL).pdf Military Rules of Evidence, Rule 412]&lt;/ref&gt; The military's rape shield law also applies to Article 32, pre-trial proceedings. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/MCM-2012.pdf Manual for Courts-Martial United States (2012), 405(i).]&lt;/ref&gt; A recent news article, however, has accused defense attorneys of violating rape shield protections during a pre-trial proceeding.&lt;ref name=NYT92013&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=Jennifer Steinhauer|first=Jennifer |last=Steinhauer|title=Navy Hearing in Rape Case Raises Alarm|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/21/us/intrusive-grilling-in-rape-case-raises-alarm-on-military-hearings.html|accessdate=September 21, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, in the case of ''[[People v. Jovanovic]]'', the [[New York Court of Appeals]] ruled that a lower court had improperly ruled as inadmissible e-mails in which the plaintiff/witness in a rape case expressed her consent to, and later approval of, the encounter. The lower court ruled these e-mails inadmissible on the basis of rape shield laws; however, the Court of Appeals ruled that the previous court had misapplied those laws.

===Identification of alleged rape victims by media outlets===
As a matter of courtesy, most newspapers and broadcast media in the United States do not disclose the name of an alleged rape victim during the trial, and if the alleged rapist is convicted, most will continue to not identify the victim.  If the case is dropped or the alleged rapist is acquitted, most media will no longer shield the name of the alleged victim.{{Dubious|date=November 2009}}  This practice was probably related to laws in some states which made it a crime to publicly reveal the name of the victim in a rape case.  When such laws were challenged in court, they were routinely struck down as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncjrs.gov/ovc_archives/directions/chap13.htm New Directions from the Field: Victims Rights and Services for the 21st Century] (Chapter 13), accessed October 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn]]''  {{ussc|420|469|1975}}, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional a Georgia statute that imposed civil liability on media for publishing a rape victim's name. [[Cox Media Group|Cox]]'s television station in Atlanta, [[WSB-TV]], had obtained the victim's name from public court records—a factor the Supreme Court held to be important, noting that "the First and Fourteenth Amendments command nothing less than that the States may not impose sanctions on the publication of truthful information contained in official court records open to public inspection."
* In ''[[Florida Star v. B. J. F.]]'', {{ussc|491|524|1989}}, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] found a Florida statute which provided penalties for media outlets that publicized the name of an alleged rape victim unconstitutional.
* In ''State of Florida v. Globe Communications Corp.'', [[Court citation|648 So.2d 110]] (Fla. 1994), the [[Florida Supreme Court]] held that a Florida criminal statute that prohibited the media from identifying the names of sexual assault victims violated the First Amendment. In that case, Globe Communications Corp. twice published the name and identifying information of a sexual assault victim, violating the Florida statute. The paper had lawfully learned the victim's name through investigation. The Florida Supreme Court relied on the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in ''Florida Star v. B.J.F.'', finding that the Florida statute barring any media publication of a rape victim's name was unconstitutional because it was "overbroad"; that is, it punished the media even if, for example, the name of the victim was already known in the community.  It also found that the statute was "underinclusive" in that it punished only media publication and not acts by a private person.

'''Russian playing cards''' are [[playing cards|cards]] that used predominantly in Russia and in the former Soviet Union. Unlike the internationally known [[Standard 52-card deck|standard French 52-card deck]], most Russian card games employ either the 36 card (games such as [[Durak]]) or the 32 card (particularly [[Preferans]]) decks.

== History ==

Playing cards were first introduced into Russia at the beginning of the 17th century from Western and Central Europe (supposedly from Germany and Poland). But they were soon banned, [[Sobornoye Ulozheniye]] of 1649 mentioned card games as one of the "thief's crimes" punished by lashing, however, since [[Peter the Great]] the ban was usually ignored. In spite of many attempts by the Russian government to restrict card games, many Russians, especially the Russian nobility, played cards in a significant scale during the 18th century.

Before the 19th century practically all playing cards were imported from Western and Central Europe, and since 1765 all imported cards had to be stamped and the high import duty had to be paid (that was supposed to limit card gaming). However, in 1819 the restrictions were lifted, but at the same time the import of playing cards was also forbidden and the state monopoly was created. The production of own Russian playing cards started in the Imperial Card Factory of the Imperial Paper Mill in Aleksandrovo (now a part of [[Saint-Petersburg]]).

== Design ==

[[File:Russian playing card deck (face cards) designed by Adolf Charlemagne.svg|thumb|200px|Russian playing card deck (face cards) designed by Adolf Charlemagne]]
The design of the Russian card decks were derived and influenced by the [[German playing cards|German card deck]]s as well as the [[French playing cards|French card deck]]s. Russian cards in the market were divided into three or four categories, depending on the quality of paper and printing: from cheapest decks for laymen through medium quality decks for the Russian middle class to high class decks for the imperial court and the higher nobility. The middle category was covered by [[talcum powder]], its cards were smooth and easy to shuffle, hence the term '''[[satin]] cards''' ({{lang-ru|атласные карты}}). In 1862 the renown Russian painter [[Adolf Charlemagne]] ({{lang-ru|Адольф Шарлемань}}) created a new unified design. Very soon his design became the most widespread and recognizable and it is still widely produced and used in Russia. Apart from that nearly fifty card designs were devised by various Russian artists during the 18th–20th centuries.

=== "Russian style" ===

[[File:Russian playing card deck Russian style 1911 original.png|thumb|left|300px|"Russian style" card deck]]
The end of the 19th and the beginning of 20th knew the rising interest to the old pre-Petrine Russian traditions (see also [[Russian Revival architecture]]), this fashion was even more intensified due to the 300th anniversary of the house of Romanovs in 1913. As a result, in 1911 the particular card design in the "Russian style" ({{lang-ru|[[:ru:Колода «Русский стиль»|колода «Русский стиль»]]}}) was created. The costumes of the face cards imitated the historical 17th century Russian costumes of the famous [[1903 Ball in the Winter Palace]].

== Deck ==
Due to the German influence the Russian standard deck contains only 36 cards from 6 to the ace. For some games, particularly [[Preferans]], the 6s are not used, resulting in the 32 card deck. Nevertheless, the 52 card decks may also occur.
[[File:Атласная колода 1 сорт. Туз бубён.jpg|thumb|150px|Ace of Diamond with the Imperial coat of arms]]
The design of the pip (numerical) cards as well as the [[Suit (cards)|suits]] ({{Clubs}}, {{Diams}}, {{Hearts}}, {{Spades}}) resemble those of [[French playing cards]]. The design of the face cards is either that of Adolf Charlemagne or in the "Russian style". The design of the aces are variable, historically the ace of diamonds showed the coat of arms of the Russian Empire. The face cards and the aces are marked by the Russian letters that correspond to the Russian rank names:
* {{lang|ru|T}} ({{lang|ru|туз}}, ''tuz'' from {{lang-de|Daus}} "deuce" via {{lang-pl|tuz}}) for Ace
* {{lang|ru|К}} ({{lang|ru|король}}, ''korol''', "king") for King
* {{lang|ru|Д}} ({{lang|ru|дама}}, ''dama'' from {{lang-de|Dame}}) for Queen
* {{lang|ru|В}} ({{lang|ru|валет}}, ''valet'' from {{lang-fr|valet}}) for Jack

The names for the pip cards are derived from Russian numerals: {{lang|ru|шестёрка, семёрка, восьмёрка, девятка, десятка}} (''shestyorka, semyorka, vos'myorka, devyatka, desyatka'') for 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 respectively.

== In Russian culture ==

The popularity of card games in Russia was portrayed by some famous Russian writers, particularly [[Alexandre Pushkin]] who wrote ''[[The Queen of Spades (story)|The Queen of Spades]]''.

Because the 6 is the lowest card of the Russian deck, Russian slang uses the derogatory word ''shestyorka'' meaning "underling, lackey".

{{Sex and the Law}}
'''Sexual abuse''', also referred to as '''molestation''', is usually undesired [[sexual behavior]] by one person upon another. It is often perpetrated using force or by taking advantage of another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual abuse|url=http://www.apa.org/topics/sexual-abuse/index.aspx|website=American Psychological Association|publisher=2018 American Psychological Association|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When force is immediate, of short duration, or infrequent, it is called [[sexual assault]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}. The offender is referred to as a sexual abuser or (often [[pejorative]]ly) molester.&lt;ref name='asb'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Peer commentaries on Green (2002) and Schmidt (2002)|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|year=2002|volume=31|issue=6|pages=479|id= |url=|format=|quote=Child molester is a pejorative term applied to both the pedophile and incest offender.|doi=10.1023/A:1020603214218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term also covers any behavior by an adult or older adolescent towards a child to stimulate any of the involved sexually. The use of a child, or other individuals younger than the [[age of consent]], for sexual stimulation is referred to as [[child sexual abuse]] or [[statutory rape]].

==Victims==

===Spouses===
{{See also|Domestic violence|Marital rape}}
Spousal sexual abuse is a form of [[domestic violence]]. When the abuse involves threats of unwanted sexual contact or forced sex by a woman's husband or ex-husband, it may constitute [[rape]], depending on the jurisdiction, and may also constitute an assault&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patricia|first1=Mahoney|title=The Wife Rape Fact Sheet|url=https://mainweb-v.musc.edu/vawprevention/research/wiferape.shtml|website=National Violence Against Women Prevention Research Center|publisher=National Violence Against Women Prevention Research Center|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Child sexual abuse is a form of [[child abuse]] in which a child is abused for the sexual gratification of an adult or older adolescent.&lt;ref name=medline2008&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/childsexualabuse.html |title=Child Sexual Abuse |work=Medline Plus|date = 2008-04-02 |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine,}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APA Guidelines"&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Committee on Professional Practice and Standards (COPPS) | author2 = Board of Professional Affairs (BPA) | author3 = American Psychological Association (APA) | authorlink1 = American Psychological Association | author4 = Catherine Acuff | author5 = Steven Bisbing | author6 = Michael Gottlieb | author7 = Lisa Grossman| author8 = Jody Porter| author9 = Richard Reichbart | author10 = Steven Sparta| author11 = C.

Annals of Behavioral Medicine. 2017;51(2):170-178&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the harm caused to victims becomes apparent years after the abuse happens. With specific regard to addiction, a study by Reiger et al supports previous findings that adverse life events increase sensitivity to drug rewards and bolster drug reward signaling by exposing an association between heightened limbic response to cocaine cues.&lt;ref&gt;Regier PS, Monge ZA, Franklin TR, Wetherill RR, Teitelman AM, Jagannathan K, et al.

Sexual abuse by a family member is a form of [[incest]], and results in more serious and long-term [[psychological trauma]], especially in the case of parental incest.&lt;ref name=Courtois&gt;{{cite book|title=Healing the Incest Wound: Adult Survivors in Therapy|last= Courtois|first=Christine A.|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|page=208|year=1988|isbn= 0-393-31356-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, approximately 18–19% of women and 8% of men [[self-report study|disclose]] being sexually abused when they were children.&lt;ref name="stolt"&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Stoltenborgh, M. | author2 = van IJzendoorn, M.

Most child sexual abuse is committed by men; women commit approximately 14% of offenses reported against boys and 6% of offenses reported against girls.&lt;ref name=Whealin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/pages/child-sexual-abuse.asp |title=Child Sexual Abuse |author=Whealin, Julia Whealin |publisher=National Center for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, US Department of Veterans Affairs |date=2007-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090730101002/http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/pages/child-sexual-abuse.asp |archivedate=2009-07-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Child sexual abuse offenders are not [[pedophile]]s unless they have a primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Seto, Michael | year = 2008 | title = Pedophilia and Sexual Offending Against Children | location = Washington, DC | publisher = American Psychological Association | page = vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===People with developmental disabilities===
{{Main|Sexual abuse of people with developmental disabilities}}
People with developmental disabilities are often victims of sexual abuse. According to research, people with disabilities are at a greater risk for [[victimization]] of sexual assault or sexual abuse because of lack of understanding (Sobsey &amp; Varnhagen, 1989).

===People with dementia===
Elderly people, especially those with dementia, can be at risk of abuse.  There were over 6,000 "safeguarding concerns and alerts" at UK care homes from 2013 to 2015. These included alleged inappropriate touching and worse allegations. Offenders were most often other residents but staff also offended. It is suspected some care homes may deliberately overlook these offenses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37416483 Sex crimes against the elderly - are they being ignored?] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes abuse victims are not believed because they are not seen as credible witnesses due to their dementia. Perpetrators frequently target victims who they know are unlikely to be believed. Spouses and partners sometimes continue to pursue sexual relations, without realising they no longer have this right, because the person with dementia can no longer consent.&lt;ref name=ncall&gt;[http://www.ncall.us/sites/ncall.us/files/H_07%20Sexual%20Assault.pdf CHALLENGES WHEN INVESTIGATING ELDER SEXUAL ABUSE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008054822/http://www.ncall.us/sites/ncall.us/files/H_07%20Sexual%20Assault.pdf |date=2016-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Elders===
Sex abuse is one of the most common forms of abuse in nursing homes{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}. If a nursing home fails to do proper background checks on an employee who subsequently abuses residents, the home can be liable for negligence. If nursing homes fail to supervise staff or train staff to recognise signs of abuse, the home can also be liable for negligence.&lt;ref Name=Snyder&gt;[https://www.edgarsnyder.com/nursing-home-abuse/abuse-type/sexual-abuse.html Sexual Abuse in Nursing Homes]&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual activity by care givers may be a crime. Victims may not report abuse or cooperate with investigations due to associated stigma and/or reluctance to mention body parts.&lt;ref name=ncall/&gt;

==Treatment==
In the [[emergency department]], [[contraceptive]] medications are offered to women raped by men because about 5% of such rapes result in pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis&gt;{{cite book | author = Varcarolis, Elizabeth | year = 2013 | title = Essentials of psychiatric mental health nursing | location = St. Louis | publisher = Elsevier | pages = 439–442}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Preventative healthcare|Preventative]] medication against [[sexually transmitted infection]]s are given to victims of all types of sexual abuse (especially for the most common diseases like [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[gonorhea]], [[trichomoniasis]] and [[bacterial vaginosis]]) and a blood serum is collected to test for STIs (such as [[HIV]], [[hepatitis B]] and [[syphilis]]).&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt; Any survivor with abrasions are immunized for tetanus if 5 years have elapsed since the last immunization.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt; Short-term treatment with a [[benzodiazepine]] may help with acute anxiety and antidepressants may be helpful for symptoms of [[PTSD]], depression and panic attacks.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt;

Sexual abuse has been linked to the development of psychotic symptoms in abused children. Treatment for psychotic symptoms may also be involved in sexual abuse treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Crush E, Arseneault L, Jaffee SR, Danese A, Fisher HL. Protective factors for psychotic symptoms among poly-victimized children. Schizophrenia Bulletin. 2017 Aug 31. doi: 10.1093/schbul/sbx111. [Epub ahead of print]&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to long term psychological treatment, [[prolonged exposure therapy]] has been tested as a method of long-term PTSD treatment for victims of sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Schiff M, Nacasch N, Levit S, Katz N, Foa EB. Prolonged exposure for treating PTSD among female methadone patients who were survivors of sexual abuse in Israel. Social Work &amp; Health Care. 2015; 54(8): 687-707. DOI: 10.1080/00981389.2015.1058311&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Child sexual abuse prevention programmes were developed in the United States of America during the 1970s and originally delivered to children. Programmes delivered to parents were developed in the 1980s and took the form of one-off meetings, two to three hours long &lt;ref name="Babatsikos"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Babatsikos | first=Georgia | title=Parents' knowledge, attitudes and practices about preventing child sexual abuse: a literature review | journal=Child Abuse Review | publisher=Wiley | volume=19 | issue=2 | year=2010 | issn=0952-9136 | doi=10.1002/car.1102 | pages=107–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hébert"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hébert | first=Martine | last2=Lavoie | first2=Francine | last3=Parent | first3=Nathalie | title=An Assessment of Outcomes Following Parents' Participation in a Child Abuse Prevention Program | journal=Violence and Victims | publisher=Springer Publishing Company | volume=17 | issue=3 | date=2002-06-01 | issn=0886-6708 | doi=10.1891/vivi.17.3.355.33664 | pages=355–372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wurtele Moreno Kenny"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wurtele | first=Sandy K. | last2=Moreno | first2=Tasha | last3=Kenny | first3=Maureen C. | title=Evaluation of a Sexual Abuse Prevention Workshop for Parents of Young Children | journal=Journal of Child &amp; Adolescent Trauma | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=1 | issue=4 | year=2008 | issn=1936-1521 | doi=10.1080/19361520802505768 | pages=331–340}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wurtele Kenny 2010 pp. 130–152"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wurtele | first=Sandy K. | last2=Kenny | first2=Maureen C. | title=Partnering with parents to prevent childhood sexual abuse | journal=Child Abuse Review | publisher=Wiley | volume=19 | issue=2 | year=2010 | issn=0952-9136 | doi=10.1002/car.1112 | pages=130–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.nspcc.org.uk/HeritageScripts/Hapi.dll/filetransfer/2018FourStepsToThePreventionOfCSAInTheHome.pdf?CookieCheck=43313.725224213&amp;filename=AA58F75CEDE68892A73FB681FE246B8371684F102152F0AA780A14959D3BCE5767137B3B2A935011CBAEC3068664FF681AA6D2524E357BAB96C006752CCD756759AD77BD1E389823A55CFAAE74B2EE64F46C611AD1724BE1AC500B025490CCB1CD8D9D26B00674E723A731951BB13FBE2976BA14838E6BBB09A4FA52BE735F27D92CBFED7FA6CFFA88BC073F0228EAA69F4D1FE158D846D5D4DD33F8F3466703AC49AD67CE927D87622D067280EF2A231A479B85D0572EF2AABC4480&amp;DataSetName=LIVEDATA|title=Four Steps to the Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse in the Home|last=Williams|first=Mike|date=2018|website=NSPCC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.nspcc.org.uk/HeritageScripts/Hapi.dll/filetransfer/2018WorkingWithACommunityToPreventCSAInTheHome.pdf?filename=AA58F75CEDE68892A73FB681FE246B8371684F102152F0AA780A14959D3BCE5767137B3B2A935011CBAEC3068664FF681AA6D2524E357BAB96C006752CCD756759AD77BD1E389823A55CFAAE74B2EE64F46C611AD1724BE1AC500B025490CCB1CD8D9D26B00674E723A731951BB13FBE2976BA14838E6BBB09A4EB52B96A653DDB0BA5CD78B3E4F0B5A317270E32E79B9F7322E26DEE69E8F9DA1AD4D57D6203CA56A4641A004820ECE9E3EB4F712C3FED9F46CEBCE377C14C55CB2FBCFD7942&amp;DataSetName=LIVEDATA|title=Working with a community to prevent child sexual abuse in the home|last=Williams|first=Mike|date=2018|website=NSPCC|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the last 15 years, web-based programmes have been developed.


== Survivor ==
The term ''survivor'' is sometimes used for a living victim, including victims of usually non-fatal harm, to honor and empower the strength of an individual to heal, in particular a living victim of sexual abuse or assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clarku.edu/offices/dos/survivorguide/definition.cfm |title=Dean of Students Office &amp;#124; Clark University |publisher=Clarku.edu |accessdate=2012-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519155442/http://www.clarku.edu/offices/dos/survivorguide/definition.cfm |archivedate=2012-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there are the [[Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests]] and [[The Survivors Trust]].

==Positions of power==
{{See also|Abusive power and control|Power harassment|Rankism}}
[[Sexual misconduct]] can occur where one person uses a position of authority to compel another person to engage in an otherwise unwanted sexual activity.  For example, [[sexual harassment]] in the workplace might involve an employee being coerced into a sexual situation out of fear of being dismissed.  [[Sexual harassment in education]] might involve a student submitting to the sexual advances of a person in authority in fear of being punished, for example by being given a failing grade.

Several sexual abuse scandals have involved [[Religious abuse|abuse of religious authority]] and often cover-up among non-abusers, including cases in the [[Southern Baptist Convention]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://stopbaptistpredators.org/index.htm Stop Baptist Predators]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catholic sex abuse cases|Catholic Church]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] religion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reformation.com/CSA/episcopalianabuse.html Episcopalian Ministers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214134233/http://www.reformation.com/CSA/episcopalianabuse.html |date=2010-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joe Murphy |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/politics/baroness-warsi-some-pakistani-men-think-young-white-girls-are-fair-game-for-sex-abuse-7766319.html |title=Baroness Warsi: Some Pakistani men think young white girls are "fair game" for sex abuse - Politics - News - Evening Standard |publisher=Thisislondon.co.uk |date=2012-05-18 |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jehovah's Witnesses and child sex abuse|Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Lutheran]] church,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelutheran.org/article/article.cfm?article_id=8572 The Lutheran]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121143245/http://www.thelutheran.org/article/article.cfm?article_id=8572 |date=2010-01-21 }}[http://www.reformation.com/CSA/lutheranabuse.html Lutheran abuse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110040936/http://www.reformation.com/CSA/lutheranabuse.html |date=2010-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Methodist]] Church,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reformation.com/CSA/methodistabuse.html Methodist abuse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625045228/http://www.reformation.com/CSA/methodistabuse.html |date=2009-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Lavina|title=Case Reports of the Mormon Alliance Volume 1|year=1995|isbn=0-10-878835-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]], [[Orthodox Judaism]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99913807 Abuse Scandal Plagues Hasidic Jews In Brooklyn] by Barbara Bradley Hagerty.

== Minorities ==

The non-profit group was founded in 2008 by [[Sylvia Coleman]], an African-American sexual abuse survivor and national sexual abuse prevention expert.

==Other animals==
{{main|Sexual coercion}}
Sexual abuse has been identified among animals as well; for example, among the [[Adélie Penguin|Adélie penguins]].&lt;ref name="GD2012"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/09/sex-depravity-penguins-scott-antarctic |title='Sexual depravity' of penguins that Antarctic scientist dared not reveal |newspaper=Guardian.co.uk |date=9 June 2012 |first=Robin |last=McKie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''shooting of Tony Terrell Robinson Jr.''' occurred on March 6, 2015, in [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. Robinson, an unarmed 19-year-old man, was fatally shot by 45-year-old Matthew Kenny, a Wisconsin police officer, during an altercation that occurred while Kenny was responding to reports that Robinson was jumping in front of cars and had attempted to strangle someone.&lt;ref name="madison01"&gt;Savidge, Nico.

Retrieved on March 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 12, 2015, the shooting was determined to be justified self-defense by the [[Dane County]] [[District Attorney]] Ismael Ozanne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Berman |first=Mark |title=Madison police officer won’t be charged for shooting Tony Robinson |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/05/12/prosecutor-to-announce-whether-madison-police-officer-will-face-charges-for-shooting-tony-robinson/ |accessdate=May 12, 2015 |work=The Washington Post |date=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death was protested by the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement; Robinson was [[African American]].

==Event==
On March 6, 2015, the police received reports that 19-year-old Tony Robinson was yelling and jumping in front of cars. Robinson had reportedly been running in and out of the street while shouting at bystanders. Some of the reports were from friends of the suspect, who were concerned by his erratic behavior and called for help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2015/5/13/wisconsin_activists_to_continue_protests_after|title=Wisconsin Activists to Continue Protests After Cop Avoids Charges in Killing of Tony Robinson|work=Democracy Now!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officer Matt Kenny responded to the calls at 6:30 pm. Upon arrival, Officer Kenny said he heard a loud yelling and banging from an upstairs apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson |first=M.

Kenny claimed that Robinson continued to swing at him. Kenny then fired his weapon seven times, mortally wounding Robinson. Kenny claimed that he performed CPR on Robinson, and Robinson was taken to a hospital but later died. Robinson was unarmed. Kenny suffered a concussion and a sprained knee from the assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fieldstadt |first1=Elisha |last2=Emmanuelle |first2=Saliba |last3=Chuck |first3=Elizabeth |title=Black Teen Tony Robinson Shot Dead by Cop in Madsion, Wisconsin, Was Unarmed |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/madison-wisconsin-cop-shoots-suspect-during-confrontation-police-n319136 |accessdate=March 10, 2015 |work=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/12/us/tony-robinson-madison-killing-investigation/|title=Tony Robinson case: No charges for officer|author=Catherine Shoichet and Jethro Mullen, CNN|date=May 12, 2015|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson was determined post-mortem to have ingested [[Xanax]], [[psilocybin mushroom]]s, and [[THC]] hours before the shooting. The drugs may have contributed to his erratic behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Laughland |first1=Oliver |last2=Sullivan |first2=Zoe |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/13/tony-terrell-robinson-madison-wisconsin-police-shooting-how-it-happened |title=Tony Terrell Robinson was shot dead by Madison police.

==Background==

Court documents show that Robinson was on probation after pleading guilty to armed robbery in 2014.  This stemmed from a home-invasion robbery in which Robinson was caught by police fleeing the scene, armed with a fake, but realistic-looking gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/buster/armed-robbery/tony-robinson-shooting-890562|title=Wisconsin Shooting Victim, 19, Was Convicted Last Year For Role In Armed Home Invasion|date=2015-03-07|website=The Smoking Gun|access-date=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Officer Matt Kenny had shot and killed Ronald Brandon, who was standing on the porch of his own home, holding an unloaded pellet gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libertynews.com/2015/03/non-violent-gentle-giant-tony-robinson-was-arrested-for-armed-robbery-in-2014/|title=Officer's past fatal shooting still disturbs victim's family|date=2015-03-13|website=WKOW|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

The [[Wisconsin Department of Justice]] investigated the Robinson shooting, as required by Wisconsin law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fieldstadt|first1=Elisha|title=Tony Robinson Shooting: Protests Continue in Madison, Wisconsin|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/madison-n319616|accessdate=March 10, 2015|work=NBC News|date=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson's uncle said that the family had faith that the Division of Criminal Investigation will "handle [the investigation] with integrity".&lt;ref name="familyfaith"&gt;Savidge, Nico.

''Wisconsin State Journal''. March 10, 2015. Accessed on March 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 12, 2015, Dane County District Attorney, Ismael Ozanne, announced that Officer Matt Kenny would not face charges for the shooting of Tony Robinson. The shooting was labeled a "lawful use of deadly police force."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tony-robinson-shooting-no-charges-lawful-use-force-n357876 |title=Tony Robinson Shooting: No Charges for Wisconsin Police Officer |author=M.

In February, 2017, Robinson's family accepted a $3.35 million settlement from the city, to settle a civil rights lawsuit. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/midwest/ct-tony-robinson-madison-wisconsin-shooting-settlement-20170223-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Social network service|Social networking]]''' is one of the most active [[World Wide Web|web]]-based activities in the '''[[Philippines]]''', with Filipinos being declared as the most active [[User (computing)|users]] on a number of web-based social network sites such as [[Facebook]], [[Instagram]], [[Snapchat]] and [[Twitter]]. The use of social networking website has become so extensive in the Philippines that the country has been tagged as "The Social Networking Capital of the World," and has also become part of Filipino [[cyberculture]]. Social networking is also used in the Philippines as a form of election campaign material, as well as tools to aid criminal investigation.

==History==
Friendster is one of the first social networking websites in the World Wide Web when it was introduced in 2002. However, its popularity in the [[United States of America|United States]] plummeted quickly in 2004 due to massive technical problems and server delays.&lt;ref name=Wall&gt;{{cite news| first=Gary| last=Rivlin| title=Wallflower at the Web Party| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/business/yourmoney/15friend.html?ei=5090&amp;en=3e9438ed349f7ce7&amp;ex=1318564800&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all| publisher=New York Times| date=October 15, 2006| accessdate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as it was losing its American audience, Friendster slowly gained users from [[Southeast Asia]] starting in the Philippines. Friendster director of engineering Chris Lunt wondered why its web traffic was spiking in the middle of the night, and noticed that the traffic was coming from the Philippines. He then traced the trail to a [[Filipino-American]] marketing consultant and hypnotist named Carmen Leilani de Jesus as the first user to have introduced Friendster to the Philippines, where a number of her friends live.&lt;ref name=Second /&gt;

==Statistics==
A study released by Universal McCann entitled "Power To The People - Wave3" declared the Philippines as "the social networking capital of the world," with 83 percent of Filipinos surveyed are members of a social network. They are also regarded as the top [[photograph|photo]] [[uploader]]s and [[web video]] viewers, while they are second when it comes to the number of [[blog]] readers and video uploaders.&lt;ref name=Power&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universalmccann.com/Assets/wave_3_20080403093750.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921002044/http://www.universalmccann.com/Assets/wave_3_20080403093750.pdf| title=Power To The People: Social Media Tracker, Wave3| accessdate=2013-05-11|archivedate=2008-09-21| date=March 2008| publisher=Universal McCann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Capital&gt;{{cite news| first=Jerry| last=Liao| title=The Philippines - Social Networking Capital of the World| url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2008/05/20/TECH20080520124703.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011094639/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2008/05/20/TECH20080520124703.html|archivedate=2008-10-11| publisher=Manila Bulletin| date=May 20, 2008| accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With over 7.9 million Filipinos using the [[Internet]], 6.9 million of them visit a social networking site at least once a month.&lt;ref name=Higher&gt;{{cite news| first=Giovanni Paolo| last=Yazon | title=Social networking to the higher level| url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=goodLife6_mar31_2007| publisher=Manila Standard Today| date=March 31, 2007| accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times, Friendster has been the most visited [[website]] in the Philippines, as well as in [[Indonesia]], according to web tracking site [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]].&lt;ref name=Asia&gt;{{cite news| first=Woo Liu| last=Ling| title=Friendster Moves to Asia| url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1707760,00.html| publisher=Time.com| date=January 29, 2008| accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Jones, vice president for global marketing of Friendster, said that "the biggest percentage of (their site's) users is from the Philippines, clocking in with 39 percent of the site's traffic." He further added that in March 2008 alone, Friendster recorded 39 million unique visitors, with 13.2 million of whom were from the Philippines.&lt;ref name=Prolific&gt;{{cite news| first=Tessa| last=Salazar| title=Filipinos are prolific, go and Multiply| url=http://archive.inquirer.net/view.php?db=1&amp;story_id=144061| publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer| pages=A1, A10| date=June 22, 2008| accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Multiply president and founder Peter Pezaris said that the Filipino users of their site comprised the largest and most active group in terms of number of subscribers and of photographs being uploaded daily. About 2.2 million out of more than nine million registered users of Multiply are Filipinos, outnumbering even nationalities with a bigger population base like the United States, Indonesia, and [[Brazil]]. Also, one million photographs are uploaded by Filipinos to Multiply every day, which is half of their total number worldwide.&lt;ref name=Prolific /&gt;

Sixty percent of Filipino users of Multiply are female, while 70 percent are under the age of 25. In comparison, Filipino Friendster users are between the ages 16 to 30, with 55 percent of them female.&lt;ref name=Prolific /&gt;

==Application in Filipino culture and society==
The popularity of social networking in the Philippines can be traced in the Filipinos' culture of "friends helping friends." For Filipinos, their friends and who they know can become more valuable than money, especially when what they need can be achieved through [[nepotism]], favoritism, and friendship among others.&lt;ref name=Second&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2007/06/try_try_againorkut_friendster.html| title=Orkut, Friendster Get Second Chance Overseas| accessdate=2008-06-22| date=June 15, 2007| publisher=PBS.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social networking has extensive uses in the Philippines. It was used to promote television programs like [[Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition Plus]] with its two profiles on Multiply. A [[call center]] company posted job openings on its Multiply community site and was able to attract recruits.&lt;ref name=Top&gt;{{cite news| first=David| last=Dizon| title=Filipinos are top Multiply users| url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/06/19/08/filipinos-are-top-multiply-users| publisher=ABS-CBNNews.com| date=June 19, 2005| accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power of social networking was tested in the country's [[Philippine general election, 2007|2007 general elections]] when senatorial candidate [[Francis Escudero]] created his own Friendster profile to bolster support from Filipino users.&lt;ref name=Chiz&gt;{{cite news| title=Chiz Escudero campaigns in cyberspace| url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/02/26/INFO2007022688089.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924005703/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/02/26/INFO2007022688089.html| publisher=Manila Bulletin| date=February 26, 2007|archive-date=2008-09-24| accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually won a seat in the Senate.&lt;ref name=Second /&gt; Local celebrities and politicians have since created their own profiles on Friendster as their medium to communicate with their fans and constituents.&lt;ref name=Stars&gt;{{cite news| first=Manny B.| last=Marinay| title=Stars use Friendster's Fan Profiles to reach out to fans| url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2008/01/31/ENTR20080131115775.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924012738/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2008/01/31/ENTR20080131115775.html| publisher=Manila Bulletin| date=January 31, 2009 |archive-date=2008-09-24| accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friendster was also used as a tool for police investigations. Local police in [[Cebu City]] were able to track down the suspects for the [[robbery]] and [[murder]] of a female [[nursing]] student on March 2008. After receiving information and tips from the public and other police operatives, the local police searched through the suspects' profiles in order to get a closer look at their faces. The police printed the pictures of the suspects and launched a series of police operations, which led to their arrest.&lt;ref name=Arrest&gt;{{cite news| first=Mars Jr. W| last=Mosqueda| title=Internet used to identify killers of nursing student| url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2008/03/11/PROV20080311119134.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212001504/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2008/03/11/PROV20080311119134.html| publisher=Manila Bulletin| date=March 11, 2008| archive-date=2009-02-12| |accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[Manila]] Police District arrested a suspect for the murder of two guest relations officers in [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]] on January 2007 after they were able to find the suspect's whereabouts through his Friendster profile.&lt;ref name=Gro&gt;{{cite news| first=Natalie Jane M| last=Malayo| title=Suspect in killing of two GROs arrested| url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/01/16/MTNN2007011684762.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929075156/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/01/16/MTNN2007011684762.html| publisher=Manila Bulletin| date=January 16, 2007 |archive-date=2008-09-29| |accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social networks also became a source of high-profile [[cyberwar]]s, notably between actors Ynez Veneracion and Mon Confiado against Juliana Palermo. The two accused Palermo of creating a fake Friendster profile of her ex-boyfriend Confiado, which is uploaded with photos of Confiado and his girlfriend Veneracion but laden with profanities in each caption.&lt;ref name=Hatester&gt;{{cite news| first=Walden| last=Sadiri| title=Ynez-Juliana feud turns Friendster to "Hatester?"| url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/06/03/SPRT2007060395116.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212002039/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/06/03/SPRT2007060395116.html| publisher=Manila Bulletin| date=June 3, 2007 |archive-date=2009-02-12| |accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his bid for the Philippine Presidency in May 2010, then Secretary of National Defense, [[Gilberto Teodoro]] launched an aggressive campaign via the social media. He capitalized on networks such as [[YouTube]] and [[Facebook]]. He reportedly spent nearly a quarter of his campaign budget on the social media in the Philippines; in comparison to the current president’s [[Benigno Simeon Aquino III]] – 9%.&lt;ref name=Elections&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.pulyetos.com/social-media-marketing-and-philippine-politics/ |title = Using Social Media Marketing to Win Elections in the Philippines |last = Manglaus |first = Roni |date = December 10, 2010 |website = Pulyetos |accessdate = 2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Filipino-American Internet personality [[Christine Gambito]], also known as HappySlip, criticized Friendster for displaying what she described as "inappropriate advertisements" that appear on her profile. She posted a message on the site's bulletin board addressing her fans that she contemplated deleting her account. Gambito had earlier deleted her [[MySpace]] account because she objected to the [[Google]]-powered online advertisements that she said "were in direct conflict with the HappySlip brand and especially misrepresentative of Filipino women." She particularly criticized the posting of advertisements of international [[Online dating service|dating websites]] that supposedly target Filipinas.&lt;ref name=Happy&gt;{{cite news| first=Erwin| last=Oliva| title=Happy Slip unhappy with "inappropriate" ads on Friendster| url=http://technology.inquirer.net/infotech/infotech/view/20080613-142434/Happy-Slip-unhappy-with-inappropriate-ads-on-Friendster| publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer| date=June 13, 2008| accessdate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Philippine National Police]] Director General Avelino Razon ordered the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group to find out who created a fake account on Friendster using his identity. The profile was laden with false information about him, saying that he "wants to meet traitors, corrupts, criminals so he could crush them."&lt;ref name=Razon&gt;{{cite news| first=Thea| last=Alberto| title=Razon not amused by "Friendster account"| url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/infotech/view/20080117-113057/Razon-not-amused-by-Friendster-account| publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer| date=January 17, 2008| accessdate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2008, there have been cases of [[spam (electronic)|spam]] comments in Friendster profiles, most of which are in the form of a [[JPEG]] image masquerading as an embedded [[YouTube]] video, with a thumbnail of a sexually explicit video clip, such as a girl undressing herself or something similar. Clicking on the image usually results in a redirect to a dubious or disreputable website, or worse, a [[drive-by download]] of [[malware]], such as the [[Koobface]] worm. Because some of the users, especially teenagers, who usually log on to the site in an [[Internet cafe]], have only limited knowledge about malware and/or computers in general, such social engineering attacks can be a significant risk. The site had received considerable criticism due to this issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://friendstertips.wordpress.com/2008/12/31/how-to-stop-friendster-spam/ How to stop Friendster spam]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bukaspalad.com/board/showthread.php?t=4844 YouTube Virus?

==New Campaign==
On July 2011, [[GMA Network]] creates the new campaign ''Think Before You Click'' - a campaign by GMA News to promote responsible use of social media.
On August 2016, Rappler initiates the campaign "[http://www.rappler.com/views/143975-no-place-for-hate-change-comes-to-rappler-comments-thread #NoPlaceForHate]" - a campaign that encourages civility when engaging online.

'''''The Arab Mind''''' is a non-fiction [[cultural psychology]] book by [[cultural anthropologist]] [[Raphael Patai]], who also wrote ''[[The Jewish Mind]]''. The book advocates a tribal-group-survival explanation for the driving factors behind [[Arab culture]]. It was first published in 1973, and later revised in 1983. A 2007 reprint was further "updated with new demographic information about the Arab world".&lt;ref&gt;# Recovery Resources Press, {{ISBN|978-0-9672015-5-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book came to public attention in 2004, after investigative journalist [[Seymour Hersh]], writing for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' revealed that the book was "the bible of the [[Neoconservatism|neocons]] on Arab behavior" to the effect that it was the source of the idea held by the US military officials responsible for the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|torture and abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib]] scandal that "Arabs are particularly vulnerable to sexual humiliation".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,1223525,00.html "Its best use is as a doorstop"] by [[Brian Whitaker]], ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
Along with prefaces, a conclusion, and a postscript, the book contains 16 chapters, including Arab [[parenting|child-rearing]] practices, three chapters on [[Bedouin]] influences and values, [[Arabic|Arab language]], Arab art, [[Islamic sexual jurisprudence|sexual honor/repression]], freedom/hospitality/outlets, [[Islam]]'s impact, unity and conflict and [[conflict resolution]], and [[Westernization]].  A four-page comparison to [[Ibero-America|Spanish America]] is made in Appendix II.

The Foreword is by Norvell B. DeAtkine, Director of Middle East Studies at the [[John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School]] at [[Fort Bragg]].

==Criticism==
Patai is criticized in passing at several points in [[Edward Said]]'s book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]''. Other scholars{{Who|date=October 2012}} describe the book as simplistic, [[Reductionism|reductionist]], [[Stereotype|stereotyping]], generic, [[ethnic essentialism|essentialist]], outdated, superseded, flawed, unscientific, and even intellectually dishonest.&lt;ref&gt;S. M. Stern (ed.), [[Ignác Goldziher]], ''Muslim Studies'', Transaction 2006, {{ISBN|0-202-30778-6}} p. LXXXVI;&lt;br&gt;Abdeslam M.

Moughrabi, ''The Arab Basic Personality: A Critical Survey of the Literature''. In: ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'', 9.1 (January 1978), Cambridge University Press, pp. 99–112;&lt;br&gt;Ibrahim Abhukattala, ''The New Bogeyman Under the Bed: Image Formation of  Islam in the Western School Curriculum and Media''.

Steinberg (eds.), ''The Miseducation of the West: How Schools and the Media Distort Our Understanding of the Islamic World'', Praeger 2004, {{ISBN|0-275-98160-6}}, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Racism Watch]] organisation reported in June 2004 that [[Manning Marable]], Columbia University director of [[African American Studies]], had called for immediate action to be taken to end the U.S. military's use of the book. This was followed by a surge of media interest in the book during the summer of 2004. In an article in ''The New Yorker'', Seymour Hersh said that he was told by an academic that the book was "the bible of the neocons on Arab behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;PCDC Edu - [http://www.pcdc.edu.ps/US_anti_arab_books.htm 2004 Racism Watch Calls for Action to End Use of Anti-Arab Books by the U.S. Government] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830052616/http://www.pcdc.edu.ps/US_anti_arab_books.htm |date=2010-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' correspondent [[Brian Whitaker]] as one that presents "an overwhelmingly negative picture of the Arabs." According to a 2004 ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' article by Emram Qureshi, the book's methodology is "emblematic of a bygone era of scholarship focused on the notion of a 'national character,' or personality archetype".&lt;ref name="EQ"&gt;{{cite news|title=Misreading 'The Arab Mind' |author=Emram Qureshi |date=May 30, 2004 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2004/05/30/misreading_the_arab_mind?mode=PF |publisher=[[Boston Globe]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060223075626/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2004/05/30/misreading_the_arab_mind?mode=PF |archivedate=February 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Packer]] on October 2, 1976, at the [[Priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]] session of the 146th Semiannual [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conference]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). The sermon is addressed to young men of the [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic priesthood]] (ages 12 to 18) and discusses issues of [[human sexuality]], [[puberty]], and morality. From 1980 to 2016, the sermon was published as a pamphlet by the LDS Church. It has been criticized on various grounds, such as that it encourages [[Violence against LGBT people|violence against homosexuals]]. In 2016, the church discontinued the pamphlet.&lt;ref name = 2016retired&gt;[[Peggy Fletcher Stack]], [http://www.sltrib.com/home/4584556-155/lds-church-retires-mormon-apostles-little "LDS Church 'retires' Mormon apostle's 'little factory' pamphlet"], ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', November 14, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
Packer described his remarks as matters that "fathers should discuss with their sons."&lt;ref name = TYMO/&gt; Packer stated that "because some young men do not have fathers and because some fathers (and some bishops) do not know how to proceed", he would be addressing sensitive subjects.&lt;ref name=TYMO&gt;{{cite web |last1=Packer |first1=Boyd |title=To Young Men Only |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021234056/https://www.lds.org/manual/to-young-men-only/to-young-men-only |url=https://www.lds.org/manual/to-young-men-only/to-young-men-only |dead-url=yes |website=lds.org |publisher=LDS Church |archive-date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sermon compares the [[male reproductive system]] to a "little factory" and teaches that [[masturbation]], use of [[pornography]], and [[homosexuality|homosexual activities]] are immoral and forbidden by God.&lt;ref name = TYMO/&gt; It encourages young male Latter-day Saints to "vigorously resist" homosexual advances, even with violence, if necessary.&lt;ref name=Quote /&gt; Packer teaches that [[nocturnal emission]] is natural and designed by God and that young men "should not feel guilty" when it happens.&lt;ref name = TYMO/&gt; The sermon also offers suggestions on how to control one's thoughts and resist temptation.&lt;ref name = TYMO/&gt;

==Publication==
Unlike most general conference sermons, "Message to Young Men" was not published in the church's official magazine, ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|The Ensign]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=Report of the 146th Semiannual Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|date=November 1976|url=https://www.lds.org/ensign/1976/11?lang=eng|magazine=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]|volume=6|issue=11|type=Magazine|access-date=2018-10-24}}. Note that the table of contents for this issue lacks any reference to this address.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the sermon was published in 1980 as a 14-page pamphlet, entitled "To Young Men Only", that was available for church leaders to distribute to members.&lt;ref name="TYMO" /&gt;

In 2016, the pamphlet was discontinued and it was removed from the LDS Church's website.&lt;ref name="2016retired" /&gt; The video of the sermon remains available on the LDS Church's website.&lt;ref name="2016retired" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TYMO" /&gt;

One controversial part of the sermon states that some men entice others to join them in sexual behaviors and gives an example of a missionary who punched his companion to the floor for making sexual advances to which Packer responded, "Somebody had to do it".&lt;ref name=Quote&gt;{{cite web |last1=Packer |first1=Boyd |title=To Young Men Only |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021234056/https://www.lds.org/manual/to-young-men-only/to-young-men-only |url=https://www.lds.org/manual/to-young-men-only/to-young-men-only |dead-url=yes |website=lds.org |publisher=LDS Church |archive-date=21 October 2015 |quote=There are some men who entice young men to join them in these immoral acts. If you are ever approached to participate in anything like that, it is time to vigorously resist. While I was in a mission on one occasion, a missionary said he had something to confess. I was very worried because he just could not get himself to tell me what he had done. After patient encouragement he finally blurted out, 'I hit my companion.' 'Oh, is that all,' I said in great relief. 'But I floored him,' he said. After learning a little more, my response was 'Well, thanks. Somebody had to do it, and it wouldn't be well for a General Authority to solve the problem that way.' I am not recommending that course to you, but I am not omitting it. You must protect yourself.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The audience is heard laughing after this statement in the original broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Packer, Boyd |date=October 1976 |title=Message to Young Men |time=11:21 |url=https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1976/10/media/session_5_talk_1/2680671857001?lang=eng |location=Salt Lake Tabernacle |publisher=LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2001, gay Mormon historian [[D. Michael Quinn]] described the sermon as "[t]he low point in the Mormon hierarchy's homophobia since the 1950s";&lt;ref name="Dynamics"&gt;[[D. Michael Quinn]], ''Same-sex Dynamics Among Nineteenth-century Americans: A Mormon Example'' (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2001) p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt; Quinn argued that Packer's words constituted an endorsement of [[gay bashing]] and that the church itself endorsed such behavior by continuing to publish Packer's speech.&lt;ref name=dialogue&gt;[[D. Michael Quinn]], [https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V33N03_13.pdf "Prelude to the National 'Defense of Marriage' Campaign: Civil Discrimination Against Feared or Despised Minorities"], ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'' vol. 33 no. 3 (Fall 2000) pp. 1–52.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2000 and 2001, David E. Hardy, a [[Salt Lake City]] lawyer who is the father of a gay son, criticized the sermon for "demoniz[ing]" gays and implying that "[[homosexuality]] is a matter of choice".&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Groutage Smith, "Mormon Pamphlets on Gays Criticized", ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', 2000-08-06, p. B2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David E. Hardy, "BYU's Dismissal of Gay Students Continues Confusion for Gays, Parents" [opinion], ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', p. AA3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Packer |first1=Boyd |title=To Young Men Only |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021234056/https://www.lds.org/manual/to-young-men-only/to-young-men-only |url=https://www.lds.org/manual/to-young-men-only/to-young-men-only |dead-url=yes |website=lds.org |publisher=LDS Church |archive-date=21 October 2015 |quote=There is a falsehood that some are born with an attraction to their own kind, with nothing they can do about it. They are just 'that way' and can only yield to those desires. That is a malicious and destructive lie. While it is a convincing idea to some, it is of the devil. No one is locked into that kind of life. From our premortal life we were directed into a physical body. There is no mismatching of bodies and spirits. Boys are to become men—masculine, manly men—ultimately to become husbands and fathers. No one is predestined to a perverted use of these powers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2014, Samantha Allen, a columnist for ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', wrote that the sermon "typifies organized religion’s approach to curtailing male masturbation", calling it "deeply paternalistic" and criticizing it for employing "a noxious mixture of condescension and euphemism".&lt;ref&gt;Samantha Allen, [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/01/tim-ferriss-is-bro-culture-s-anti-masturbation-crusader.html "Tim Ferriss Is Bro Culture's Anti-Masturbation Crusader"], ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', August 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
