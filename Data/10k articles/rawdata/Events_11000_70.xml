The '''Witney by-election''' was a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK parliamentary]] by-election held on 20 October 2016 in the [[constituency]] of [[Witney (UK Parliament constituency)|Witney]] in Oxfordshire. It took place on the same day as the [[Batley and Spen by-election, 2016|Batley and Spen by-election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37371430|title=Batley by-election to be on 20 October|date=15 September 2016|publisher=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were the fifth and sixth by-elections of the [[56th Parliament of the United Kingdom|56th UK Parliament]].

The by-election was triggered by the resignation of the sitting Member of Parliament (MP) [[David Cameron]] on 12 September 2016.&lt;ref name="itv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2016-09-12/david-cameron-resigns-his-seat-as-an-mp/|publisher=itv.com|title=David Cameron resigns as an MP – ITV News|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmvote/160912v01.htm |title=House of Commons Votes and Proceedings Monday 12th September 2016 |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The election was won by Conservative [[Robert Courts]] with a reduced majority, and the Liberal Democrats came in second with an increase in vote share of 23.4 percentage points.

[[David Cameron]] had been the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] MP for the seat since the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]], becoming leader of the Conservative Party in 2005 and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 2010. Following the Leave result in the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union]] that Cameron had campaigned against, he resigned as Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party, being replaced by [[Theresa May]]. In September 2016 he announced his resignation as an MP saying he did not want to be a distraction to May's premiership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37342152 |title=David Cameron quits as Conservative MP for Witney |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=12 September 2016 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=14 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Alfie Evans case''' was a [[legal case]] in 2018 involving Alfie Evans (9 May 2016 – 28 April 2018), an infant boy from [[Liverpool]] with an undiagnosed [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/04/25/alfie-evanss-father-threatened-private-murder-prosecution-against|title=Alfie Evans's father threatened private murder prosecution against doctors treating the toddler|first=Patrick|last=Sawer|date=25 April 2018|publisher=telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medical team and the child's parents disagreed about whether to maintain Evans' [[life support]] or to withdraw it, resulting in a legal battle. [[Alder Hey Children's Hospital|Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust]] sought a declaration that continued [[Mechanical ventilation|ventilatory support]] was "unkind and inhumane", and not in Evans' best interests. Alfie's parents, Kate James and Thomas Evans, contested the application.

The ventilatory support was removed on 23 April 2018 following a series of unsuccessful appeals from Alfie's family. Alfie continued to breathe naturally for five days after the removal of his breathing tube. He died at 2:30 a.m. on 28 April 2018.

== Treatment ==
[[File:Alder Hey Children's Health Park 2.jpg|thumb|Alder Hey Children's Hospital, where Alfie Evans was treated from December 2016 until his death.]]
In November 2016, at six months of age, Alfie Evans was reviewed at the general pediatric outpatient clinic at [[Alder Hey Children's Hospital]]. He was found to be functioning in a range appropriate for a 6-week to 2-month-old infant. On 14 December 2016, Alfie was admitted to Alder Hey Accident and Emergency Department with a history of coughing, high temperature, and a reported episode of rhythmic jerking of his jaw and all four limbs.&lt;ref name="Beeb"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43933056|title=Legal battle toddler Alfie Evans dies|date=28 April 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 December, he showed sudden unprovoked movements compatible with [[Epileptic spasms|infantile/epileptic spasms]]. An [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] performed on 16 December 2016 confirmed [[hypsarrhythmia]].&lt;ref name="LivEcho"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/alfie-evans-timeline-legal-battle-14312017|title=Alfie Evans timeline: How one young boy captured the hearts of millions|first=Steve|last=Graves|date=28 April 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further EEG was taken in January 2017 and "was markedly different, showing attenuation with little in the way of reactive response for protracted periods of time. Changes only really occurred when Alfie had an epileptic seizure."&lt;ref name="judgment-2018-02-20"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/alder-hey-v-evans.pdf|title=Alder Hey Hospital v Evans|publisher=Royal Court of Justice|author=Justice Anthony Hayden|date=20 February 2018|access-date=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfie's parents wished to remove him from Alder Hey and seek further care at the [[Bambino Gesù Hospital]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/01/alfie-evans-continuing-life-support-inhumane-liverpool-court-hears|title=Alfie Evans: continuing life support 'inhumane', Liverpool court hears|first=Josh|last=Halliday|date=1 February 2018|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, Italian doctors from Bambino Gesù Hospital produced an assessment report on the possibility of transferring Alfie to Italy. According to their report on the case, they could offer prolonged ventilator support, with a surgical [[Tracheotomy|tracheostomy]] and would remove a [[Nasogastric intubation|nasogastric tube]], replacing it with a [[gastrostomy]]. During assessment, Alfie suffered "epileptic seizures induced by [[Proprioception|proprioceptive stimuli]]", the report warned "due to stimulations related to the transportation and flight, those seizures might induce further damage to the brain, [putting] the whole procedure of transportation at risk."&lt;ref name="judgment-2018-02-20" /&gt; Alfie remained in Alder Hey Hospital for the duration of 2017, with no improvement in his condition.&lt;ref name="sky.com" /&gt; At the end of the year, the hospital applied to have [[life support]] switched off.&lt;ref name="LivEcho" /&gt;

== Publicity and public reaction ==
Alfie Evans' case drew significant public attention in the United Kingdom and overseas, with his parents establishing "Alfie's Army", an online campaign group dedicated to seeking further treatment and opposing the withdrawal of life support.&lt;ref name="echotimeline"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/alfie-evans-timeline-legal-battle-14312017|title=Alfie Evans timeline: How one young boy captured the hearts of millions|last=|first=|date=|website=Liverpool Echo|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters established a petition on [[change.org]], calling on [[Alder Hey Children's Hospital|Alder Hey Hospital]] to allow Alfie Evans to be transferred to a hospital of his parents' choice. His parents also approached Dr Michio Hirano, a US-based neurologist who had offered treatment in the [[Charlie Gard case|case of Charlie Gard]].&lt;ref name="echotimeline" /&gt; Alfie's parents claimed a parental right to make decisions about their son's care, arguing that the hospital itself should not be able to make care-decisions for their son without their consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43893709|title=Alfie Evans: When are parents denied the final say?|last=|first=|date=|website=BBC News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large protests emerged outside Alder Hey Hospital on 12 April after his family insisted on their right to take him home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/alfie-evans-police-called-to-alder-hey-childrens-hospital-as-hundreds-join-protest-11328278|title=Alfie Evans: Police called to Alder Hey Children's Hospital as hundreds join protest|date=13 April 2018|website=Sky News|access-date=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 April, [[Merseyside Police]] launched an investigation into "instances of verbal abuse and acts of intimidation" with judges raising concerns about threatening conduct by protests towards hospital staff. Alfie's parents apologised, saying they did not intend to "harm or cause conflict or upset".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merseyside.police.uk/news/latest-news/2018/04/merseyside-police-comment-on-ongoing-issues-at-alder-hey-hospital/|title=Merseyside Police comment on ongoing issues at Alder Hey hospital|date=16 April 2018|website=www.merseyside.police.uk|language=en|access-date=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merseyside Police Chief Inspector Chris Gibson released a statement regarding social media posts regarding the Alder Hey Hospital and Alfie Evans situation: "[[Malicious Communications Act 1988|malicious communications]] and threatening behaviour will be investigated and, where necessary, will be acted upon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/merseypolice/posts/1774908912565745|title=Merseyside Police|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overseas support ===
On 18 April 2018 Alfie's father flew to Rome for a 20-minute meeting with [[Pope Francis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2018-04/pope-francis-meeting-with-father-alfie-evans.html|title=The Pope's meeting with the father of Alfie Evans&amp;nbsp;— Vatican News|date=18 April 2018|publisher=|access-date=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was commented on by the Pope via [[Twitter]], who stated his "sincere hope that everything necessary may be done in order to continue compassionately accompanying little Alfie Evans, and that the deep suffering of his parents may be heard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|number=981606519702786048|user=Pontifex|title=It is my sincere hope that everything necessary may be done in order to continue compassionately accompanying little Alfie Evans, and that the deep suffering of his parents may be heard.

The President of Poland [[Andrzej Duda]] also expressed his support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|number=989054152155258880|user=AndrzejDuda|title=Alfie Evans must be saved!

The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] said it hoped Alfie would be allowed "immediate transfer to Italy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-43872678|title=Alfie Evans granted Italian citizenship|date=23 April 2018|website=BBC News|access-date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December 2017, Alder Hey applied to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] to withdraw parental rights from Alfie's parents and to withdraw ventilation.&lt;ref name="sky.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/timeline-the-fight-to-keep-alfie-evans-alive-11344694|title=Timeline: The fight to keep Alfie Evans alive |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was heard at a public hearing in the [[High Court of Justice#Family Division|Family Division of the High Court]] in London. Alder Hey claimed that continuing life-support treatment would not be in the best interests of Alfie and sought declaration that "is not lawful that such treatment continue". Lawyers acting on the hospital's behalf further claimed that further treatment for Alfie would be "unkind and inhumane". A doctor treating Alfie further stated that there was "no hope" for the child, and that he was in a [[Persistent vegetative state|semi-vegetative state]] from a degenerative neurological condition that medics have not been able to definitively identify. The parents denied this, with Alfie's father claiming that his son "looks him in the eye" and "wants help".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/judgments/alder-hey-nhs-trust-v-evans|title=Alder Hey NHS Trust -v- Evans [2018] EWHC 308 (Fam)|date=20 February 2018|access-date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The High Court ruled in favour of the hospital on 20 February 2018. In their judgement, the High Court stated that an MRI scan taken in February 2018 revealed that "[Alfie's] brain [was] entirely beyond recovery" and that "the brain was now only able to generate seizure" with "progressive destruction of the [[white matter]] of the brain which Dr R interpreted as now appearing almost identical to water and [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF)." The Court noted that the medical consensus, including of doctors asked to testify by the parents, was that Alfie had a fatal and untreatable condition, but they differed over the best course of action concerning his end-of-life care. High Court judge [[High Court judge (England and Wales)|Mr Justice]] [[Anthony Hayden]] concluded that "I am satisfied that continued ventilatory support is no longer in Alfie's best interest".&lt;ref name="judgment-2018-02-20"/&gt;

===Appeals===
Alfie's parents appealed against the decision in late February. On 6 March, the [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]] upheld the earlier ruling of the High Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/550.html|title=E (A Child), Re [2018] EWCA Civ 550|last=|first=|date=6 March 2018|website=[[British and Irish Legal Information Institute]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They stated that the High Court judge was "meticulous and thorough", and that medical evidence showed Alfie was "deeply comatose" and "to all intents and purposes unaware of his surroundings". The parents applied to the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] on 20 March, which refused the right for another appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Permission to appeal determination in the matter of Alfie Evans&amp;nbsp;— The Supreme Court|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/news/permission-to-appeal-determination-in-the-matter-of-alfie-evans.html|website=[[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]|access-date=26 April 2018|language=en|date=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 March the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled the case inadmissible, finding no violation of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/app/conversion/pdf/?library=ECHR&amp;id=003-6046074-7771568&amp;filename=Decision%20Evans%20v.%20United%20Kingdom%20-%20complaint%20declared%20inadmissible.pdf|title=ECHR declares application by parents of Alfie Evans inadmissible|date=28 March 2018|access-date=23 April 2018|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a High Court judgement of 11 April 2018, the judge remarked that "by the end of February the connective pathways within the white matter of the brain which facilitate rudimentary sensation&amp;nbsp;— hearing, touch, taste and sight, had been obliterated. They were no longer even identifiable on the MRI scan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust v Evans &amp; Ors [2018] EWHC 818 (Fam)|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2018/818.html|website=[[British and Irish Legal Information Institute]]|access-date=26 April 2018|date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court backed an end-of-life care plan drawn up by medical specialists attached to Alfie Evans' case.

Alfie's father said that Alfie was wrongly "detained" at Alder Hey. High Court judge Hayden dismissed that complaint, and appeal judges upheld his decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pidd|first1=Helen|title=Alfie Evans' parents lose latest legal battle at UK's highest court|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/apr/20/alfie-evans-parents-lose-latest-legal-battle-uk-highest-supreme-court|website=the Guardian|access-date=23 April 2018|language=en|date=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/805.html|title=Evans &amp; Anor v Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust &amp; Ors [2018] EWCA Civ 805|last=|first=|date=16 April 2018|website=[[British and Irish Legal Information Institute]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 April Mr Evans and Ms James asked the Supreme Court to consider their case again.&lt;ref name="sky.com" /&gt; Their application to appeal was refused on 20 April. The justices wrote, "Alfie looks like a normal baby, but the unanimous opinion of the doctors who have examined him and the scans of his brain is that almost all of his brain has been destroyed. No-one knows why. But that it has happened and is continuing to happen cannot be denied. [...] there is no hope of his ever getting better."&lt;ref name="supremecourt-2018-04-20"&gt;{{cite web|title=Permission to appeal application in the matter of Alfie Evans&amp;nbsp;— The Supreme Court|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/news/permission-to-appeal-application-in-the-matter-of-alfie-evans.html|website=[[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]|access-date=26 April 2018|language=en|date=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Court of Human Rights again determined their appeal on these grounds to be inadmissable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European court rejects plea from parents of Alfie Evans|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2018-04-23/european-court-rejects-plea-from-parents-of-alfie-evans|website=ITV News|access-date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case concerned the family's argument that the prevention of Alfie's transfer from Alder Hey Hospital constituted deprivation of liberty and a violation of Article 5 (right to liberty and security) of the European Convention on Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ECHR finds fresh application from family of Alfie Evans inadmissible|url=https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Decision_Evans_v_UK.pdf|publisher=European Court of Human Rights|access-date=26 April 2018|format=pdf|date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision resulted in a [[protest]] of at least 200 people taking place outside of Alder Hey hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alfie protesters try to storm hospital|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-43867132|website=BBC News|access-date=23 April 2018|date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Withdrawal of life support===
On 23 April, it was reported that Alfie's life support had been withdrawn.&lt;ref name="lifesupport-guardian"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pidd|first1=Helen|last2=Rawlinson|first2=Kevin|last3=Perraudin|first3=Frances|title=Life support has been withdrawn from Alfie Evans, says father|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/23/alfie-evans-european-court-human-rights-life-support|website=the Guardian|access-date=24 April 2018|date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alfie continued to breathe after the removal of his breathing tube, although his parents gave conflicting reports, at one time claiming they needed to perform [[Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation|mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/alfie-evans-latest-parents-giving-severely-ill-toddler-mouth-tomouth-resuscitation-to-keep-him-alive-a3822741.html|title=Alfie Evans' parents 'giving toddler mouth-to-mouth' to keep him alive|publisher=[[London Evening Standard]]|date=25 April 2018|access-date=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than a post on social media no evidence of mouth-to-mouth ever being performed has ever been made public. Alfie's father stated to the media the next morning that Alfie had been breathing unassisted since shortly after life-support had been withdrawn, and that life-support should be reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/04/24/alfie-evans-father-reveals-son-has-breathing-unassisted-life/ Alfie Evans' father reveals son has been breathing unassisted after life support stops], The Telegraph, 24 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The evening of the same day, High Court judge Justice Hayden rejected the parents' appeal for permission to fly their son to a hospital in Italy. The judge concluded how previously he had come, "the consensus of every doctor from every country who had ever evaluated Alfie's condition, to the inevitable conclusion (following 7 days of evidence) that Alfie's brain had been so corroded by his Neurodegenerative Brain Disorder that there was simply no prospect of recovery. By the time I requested the updated MRI scan in February, the signal intensity was so bright that it revealed a brain that had been almost entirely wiped out. In simple terms the brain consisted only of water and CSF. [...] All that could be offered by the Bambino Gesu Hospital in Rome was an alternative palliative care plan."&lt;ref name="bailii-2018-040-24"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust v Evans &amp; Anor [2018] EWHC 953 (Fam)|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2018/953.html|website=[[British and Irish Legal Information Institute]]|access-date=26 April 2018|date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'', Alfie's father told reporters later that evening that the court had said it could set aside three judges that evening to hear his case again.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/alfie-evans-latest-parents-say-14572790 Alfie Evans latest: Parents say they had to keep him alive using mouth to mouth resuscitation], Liverpool Echo, 24 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 April, the appeal was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alfie Evans: Appeal court hearing 'extraordinary and tragic'|url=https://news.sky.com/story/alfie-evans-appeal-court-hearing-extraordinary-and-tragic-11346723|website=Sky News|access-date=26 April 2018|date=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Alfie Evans' father sought to issue a private prosecution alleging murder against several staff members at Alder Hey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sawer|first1=Patrick|title=Alfie Evans's father threatened private murder prosecution against doctors treating the toddler |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/04/25/alfie-evanss-father-threatened-private-murder-prosecution-against/|website=The Telegraph|access-date=26 April 2018|date=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{bettersource|date=May 2018}} A statement had been prepared by Pavel Stroilov of the [[Christian Legal Centre]], but was rejected by a district judge. On 26 April, Mr Evans issued a statement, thanking supporters, and staff at Alder Hey Hospital. He stated the family wished to "form a relationship, build a bridge and walk across it" with the hospital where their son has been treated and work with the treating team on a "plan that provides our boy with the dignity and comfort that he needs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alfie Evans' family pledge to 'build bridge' with doctors|url=https://news.sky.com/story/alfie-evans-family-to-build-bridge-with-doctors-11347612|website=Sky News|access-date=26 April 2018|date=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Black August''' is a 2007 drama film produced by [[Tcinque Sampson]] and directed by [[Samm Styles]]. The film centers on the story of [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]]'s life.

==Plot==

The movie covers the last 14 months of [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]]'s life as well as the conditions in California's prison industrial complex.  George Jackson would spend 11 years incarcerated (7 of which were in solitary confinement) for a $70 gas station robbery crime in 1960.  He was 18 years of age when the sentence of one year-to-life was handed down to him.

''Black August'' encompasses the infamous [[Soledad Brothers]] case in which George Jackson, Fleeta Drumgo, and John Clucheette are accused of murdering a Soledad prison guard, in retaliation for the killing of three Black inmates involved in a fight with White inmates on an exercise yard in Soledad State Prison, [[Soledad, California]].  The film reflects on the general prison movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the role the [[Black Panther Party]] would play in organizing both the outside communities as well as the Party's influence on prisoners across the country.

As a prison organizer, George was recruited by Black Panther Party founder [[Huey P. Newton]] to head the Peoples Army, a euphemism which would become synonymous with the name [[Black Guerrilla Family]]. The film points out the conspiratorial nature of occurrences, which surrounded the events of August 7, 1970, where Jackson's 17-year-old younger brother, Jonathan Jackson, played by Ezra J. Stanley, would be killed at the [[Marin County]] Courthouse, at [[San Rafael, California]], during a hostage takeover attempt to leverage against the release of the elder Jackson, and the other [[Soledad Brothers]].

The younger Jackson and three others would be killed, including Superior Judge [[Harold Haley]] and August 21, 1971, where George Jackson himself, and five others would be killed at [[San Quentin State Prison]], California, during what is described as a prison break attempt. After a nationwide manhunt, [[Angela Davis]] would be captured and stand trial in connection with the [[Marin County]] Court House liberation attempt by Jonathan Jackson, accused of conspiracy in supplying 17-year-old Jonathan Jackson with the weapons used. George Jackson is accused of smuggling a 9mm pistol and extra clips concealed under an Afro-wig, into the prison cellblock following a visit by Attorney [[Stephen Bingham]]. Stephen Bingham would leave the country, not returning to face charges until 14 years later. Both, Davis and Bingham would be acquitted. Others possibly involved in connection with the events of August 21, 1971 would never be questioned.

[[File:Uncommon law - negatiable cow.jpg|thumb|upright|The case of the ''negotiable cow,'' collected in ''[[Uncommon Law]]'']]
'''''Board of Inland Revenue v Haddock''''' (also known as '''the negotiable cow''') is a fictitious legal case written by the humorist [[A. P. Herbert]] for [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'' magazine]] as part of his series of ''Misleading Cases in the Common Law''. It was first published in book form in ''More Misleading Cases in the Common Law'' (Methuen, 1930).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ansible.co.uk/misc/apherbert.html A.P. Herbert's Misleading Cases]&lt;/ref&gt;  The case evolved into an [[urban legend]].

==Summary of the case==

The case&lt;ref name="uncommonlaw"&gt;{{cite
|title=Uncommon Law
|authorlink=A. P. Herbert
|publisher=[[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]]
|place=Great Britain
|date=1935
|last=Herbert|first=Alan P.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; involved a Mr Albert Haddock, often an ingenious litigant in Herbert's writing. In this case, Haddock had been in disagreement with the Collector of Taxes over the size of his tax bill. Haddock complained that the sum was excessive, particularly in view of the inadequate [[Consideration under English law|consideration]] he believed that he received from that Government in service. Eventually the Collector demanded £57 and 10 shillings.

Haddock appeared at the offices of the Collector of Taxes and delivered a white cow "of malevolent aspect". On the cow was stencilled in red ink:

:''To the London and Literary Bank, Limited''
:''Pay the Collector of Taxes, who is no gentleman, or Order, the sum of fifty seven pounds £57/0/0 (and may he rot!) ''
:''ALBERT HADDOCK''

Haddock tendered the cow in payment of his bill and demanded a receipt.

During the hearing, the fictitious judge, Sir Basil String, enquired whether [[stamp duty]] had been paid. The prosecutor, Sir Joshua Hoot [[Queen's Counsel|KC]] confirmed that a two-penny stamp was affixed to the dexter horn of the cow. The collector declined the cow, objecting that it would be impossible to pay it into a bank account. Haddock suggested that he [[Negotiable instrument|endorse]] the cow to a third party to whom he might owe money, adding that "there must be many persons in that position".

Sir Joshua informed the court that the collector did try to endorse the cheque on its back, in this case on the abdomen. However, Sir Joshua explained: "[t]he cow ... appeared to resent endorsement and adopted a menacing posture."

The collector abandoned the attempt and declined to take the cheque. Haddock led the cow away and was arrested in [[Trafalgar Square]] for causing an obstruction, leading to the co-joined criminal case, '''''R. v Haddock'''''.

He testified that he had tendered a cheque in payment of income tax. A cheque was only an order to a bank to pay money to the person in possession of the cheque or a person named on the cheque, and there was nothing in law to say it must be on paper of specified dimensions. A cheque, he argued, could be written on notepaper. He said he had "drawn cheques on the backs of menus, on napkins, on handkerchiefs, on the labels of wine bottles; all these cheques had been duly honoured by his bank and passed through the Bankers’ Clearing House". He thought that there was no distinction in law between a cheque on a napkin and a cheque on a cow.

When asked as to motive, he said he had not a piece of paper to hand. Horses and other animals used to be seen frequently in the streets of London. He admitted on [[cross-examination]] that he may have had in his mind an idea to ridicule the taxman. "But why not? There is no law against ridiculing the income tax."&lt;ref name="uncommonlaw"/&gt;

In relation to the criminal prosecution, Haddock said it was a nice thing if in the heart of the commercial capital of the world a man could not convey a negotiable instrument down the street without being arrested. If a disturbance was caused by a crowd, the policeman should arrest the crowd, not him.

The judge, sympathetic to Haddock, found in his favour on the tax claim and prosecution for causing a disturbance. By tendering and being refused the cow, the other parties were [[estoppel|estopped]] from then demanding it later.

==Television adaptation==
''Board of Inland Revenue v. Haddock'' was dramatised for BBC television as "The Negotiable Cow" as the opening of the first series of ''A. P. Herbert's Misleading Cases'' in 1967, with [[Roy Dotrice]] as Albert Haddock and [[Alastair Sim]] as Mr Justice Swallow.

==Citations==
Although the case is fictitious, it has been referred to in judicial decisions. 

In ''Messing v Bank of America'' (2002) at paragraph 1&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.state.md.us/opinions/coa/2003/27a02.pdf 373 Md. 672; 821 A.2d. 22]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Maryland Court of Appeals]] observed: "The circumstances which gave rise to the case before us are, in terms of its genesis, reminiscent of those described in the case of ''Board of Inland Revenue v. Haddock''."

In the English case of {{cite bailii|litigants=Victor Chandeler International Ltd v The Commissioners of Custom and Excise and Teletext Limited|year=1999|court=EWHC|division=Ch |num=214}} [[Gavin Lightman (judge)|Mr Justice Lightman]] stated that a document, in the context of the [[Betting and Gaming Duties Act 1981]], "must be inanimate: neither a person nor A.P. Herbert's 'negotiable cow' can constitute a document."&lt;ref&gt;At paragraph 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbert reported that the now defunct ''Memphis Press-Scimitar'' (formerly published by the [[E. W. Scripps Company]]) published an article on the case in 1967, assuming it to have been factual.&lt;ref&gt;See report in Snopes Urban legends [http://www.snopes.com/business/bank/cowcheck.asp] and the definition of "chose in action" in this [http://sixthformlaw.info/03_dictionary/dict_c.htm legal dictionary].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparable real life cases==
Negotiable instruments and other legal documents have been written on unusual surfaces. Documented cases provide illustrations of [[will (law)|wills]] on the side of empty egg-shells,&lt;ref&gt;See ''Hodson v Barnes'' (1926) 43 TLR 71.  The will was rejected from probate.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cheque]]s being written on a variety of strange surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;A commonly cited example is tax protests in the United Kingdom in the 1970s when taxpayers would print their cheques on rigid boards measuring approximately 3 feet by 1½ feet.[https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-20434,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

An often-cited example is a Canadian farmer who, while trapped under his own tractor, carved a [[holographic will]] into the tractor's fender. The fender was probated and stood as his will, and is currently on display at the [[law library]] of the [[University of Saskatchewan College of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;On Campus News, January 23, 2009:  [http://news.usask.ca/archived_ocn/09-jan-23/see_what_we_found.php The Last Will and Testament of Cecil George Harris]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Halakha|Jewish law]] a [[get (divorce document)|get]] can be written on any durable material, including the horn of a cow.  If the horn is still attached to the cow, the husband must give the wife the whole cow.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishnah]] [[Nashim#Gittin ("Bills of Divorce")|Gittin 2.3]]),[http://kodesh.snunit.k12.il/b/h/h36.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar fictional cases==

Another A. P. Herbert "misleading case" concerns "The egg of exchange". The question there was whether a cheque written on an egg could be paid into a bank, given the risk of the egg breaking or going bad. It was suggested that the cheque could be boiled.

Yet another "misleading case", also ''Inland Revenue v Haddock'', was cited in a debate in the [[House of Lords]] on 14 July 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, Mr. Haddock successfully argued that, during a period when judges had their salaries reduced by 30% because of financial emergency, they could not hear cases relating to the Inland Revenue because they had a [[conflict of interest|personal interest]] in the outcome.

==Early life==
Bruce Richard Reynolds was born at [[Charing Cross Hospital]], in the [[Strand, London|Strand]], central London, the only child of Thomas Richard and Dorothy Margaret (née Keen). He was initially brought up in [[Putney]], and his mother, a [[nurse]], died in 1935 when he was aged four. His father, a trade-union activist at the [[Ford Dagenham assembly plant]], married again, and the family moved to [[Gants Hill]].&lt;ref name="G o"/&gt; Reynolds found it difficult to live with his father and stepmother, choosing often to stay with one or other of his grandmothers.&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; During the [[London Blitz]] of the [[World War II|Second World War]] he was evacuated to [[Suffolk]] and then to [[Warwickshire]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

On leaving school at 14½, Reynolds failed the eyesight test to join the [[Royal Navy]],&lt;ref name=ESLive/&gt; and decided he wanted to become a [[foreign correspondent]], so he applied in person for a job at [[Northcliffe House]].&lt;ref name=ESLive/&gt; Employed first as a messenger boy, he then worked in the accounts department of the ''[[Daily Mail]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=The Guardian |date=1 April 1995 |title=Interview: One of your very uncommon criminals}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of 17 he had become bored with the routine and was working in the Bland/Sutton Institute of Pathology at [[Middlesex Hospital]],&lt;ref name=ESLive/&gt; before joining [[Claud Butler]] as a [[bicycle messenger]] and a member of their semi-professional racing team,&lt;ref name="G o"/&gt; where he first met criminals and began a life of crime.&lt;ref name=Idler&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idler.co.uk/conversations-bruce-reynolds/ |title=In conversation with...

==Career==
After undertaking some petty crime and spending time in [[HMP Wormwood Scrubs]] and [[Borstal Prison|Borstal]]&lt;ref name="G o"/&gt; for theft&lt;ref name="BBC dies"/&gt; (from which he escaped and was eventually caught and sent to Reading Prison), he spent six weeks of the required two years doing [[National Service]] in the [[British Army]], before running away to return to petty crime. Sentenced to three years in 1952 for breaking and entering, he was sent to the juvenile wing of [[HMP Wandsworth|Wandsworth Prison]] in London.&lt;ref name=Idler/&gt; He then graduated to jewellery theft from large country houses.&lt;ref name=Idler/&gt;

In 1957 Reynolds was arrested, together with [[Terence Hogan|Terry Hogan]], for assault and robbery of a bookmaker returning from [[White City Greyhounds]] with £500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alleged Assault On Bookmaker Two Men For Trial|journal= The Times|date=28 December 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police stated their belief that the intent of the cosh attack was grievous bodily harm and not robbery. Hogan was sentenced to 2½ years and Reynolds received a year longer.&lt;ref&gt;''Assault On Bookmaker'', The Times 17 January 1958&lt;/ref&gt; After spending time in [[HMP Wandsworth]] and [[HMP Durham]], on release in 1960 he then became an [[antiques]] dealer and thief.&lt;ref name="GTR"&gt;[http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/crime-files/great-train-robbery/crime.html The Great Train Robbery]&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined a gang with future best friend Harry Booth and future brother-in-law John Daly. Later on, he did some work with Jimmy White and met Buster Edwards at [[Charlie Richardson]]'s club. Richardson in turn introduced him to [[Gordon Goody]].&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; Having gained the moniker ''[[Napoleon]]'',&lt;ref name=TelgDeath/&gt; in 1962 his gang stole £62,000 in a security van robbery at [[London Heathrow Airport]]. They then attempted to rob a [[Royal Mail]] train at [[Swindon]], which netted only £700.&lt;ref name="G o"/&gt; But Reynolds, now looking for his career-criminal defining moment,&lt;ref name=Idler/&gt; started planning his next train robbery over a period of three months.&lt;ref name="G o"/&gt;

Reynolds organised a gang of 15 men to undertake the 1963 Great Train Robbery (which he later referred to as his "[[Sistine Chapel]] ceiling").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal=Newsday|title=Bruce Reynolds, 'Robbery' architect|author=Adam Bernstin, ''The Washington Post''|date=2 March 2013|page=A26}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the theft, Reynolds spent six months in a mews house in [[South Kensington]] waiting for a false passport.&lt;ref name=Idler/&gt; He then travelled via [[Elstree Airfield]] to [[Ostend]], was then driven to [[Brussels Airport]], before flying with [[Sabena]] airlines to [[Mexico City]] via [[Toronto]].&lt;ref name=ESLive&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/live-chat-bruce-reynolds-7229082.html|title=Live chat with Bruce Reynolds|publisher=[[Evening Standard]]|date=8 August 2003|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming the name ''Keith Clement Miller'',&lt;ref name=Idler/&gt; he was joined by his wife Frances, who changed her name to Angela, and son Nick.&lt;ref name=TelgDeath/&gt;

For Christmas 1964, the family were joined in [[Acapulco]] by fellow train robbers [[Buster Edwards]], who had not yet been caught, and treasurer [[Charlie Wilson (criminal)|Charlie Wilson]], who had escaped from [[HM Prison Birmingham|HMP Winson Green]].&lt;ref name="G o"/&gt; Reynolds and his family later moved to [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], [[Canada]], where Wilson had settled with his family, but a proposed theft of [[Canadian dollar]]s was stopped due to [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] observation. Reynolds then moved to [[Vancouver]], before returning that summer to the [[South of France]].&lt;ref name="G o"/&gt; By now running low on cash, he heard a similarly sized large robbery was being planned.&lt;ref name="G o" /&gt; The family returned to London, before then moving to [[Torquay]], [[Devon]].&lt;ref name="house" /&gt; Assuming the name ''Keith Hiller'', the family began a life of settling into Reynolds' former childhood holiday town, before he had the urge to make contact with his old friends back in London. The [[Metropolitan Police]] whilst watching the London criminal scene realised that Hiller was in fact Reynolds, and arrested him in Torquay on 9 November 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisissouthdevon.co.uk/Great-Train-Robber-Bruce-Reynolds-run-ground/story-18278883-detail/story.html#axzz2MCsugqKA|title=How Great Train Robber Bruce Reynolds was run to ground in Torquay|author=Guy Henderson|publisher=Thisissouthdevon.co.uk|date=28 February 2013|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offered a deal by the [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)]] to plead guilty and avoid their pursuing his son, wife and family on further criminal charges, Reynolds agreed to plead guilty and was sentenced to 25 years.&lt;ref name="Idler" /&gt; All of the Great Train robbers were held in maximum security in a specially built unit at [[HMP Durham]].&lt;ref name="G o" /&gt; After making friends with both [[Charlie Richardson|Charlie]] and [[Eddie Richardson]] whilst in prison, Reynolds was released from [[HMP Maidstone]] in 1978.&lt;ref name="Idler" /&gt;{{clarify|reason=if he was held at Durham how was he released from Maidstone?|date=December 2013}}

After a failed attempt in the [[textile]] trade, he began trafficking and [[money laundering]] for many South London drugs gangs.&lt;ref name="Idler" /&gt; Arrested for dealing [[amphetamine]]s, he was jailed in the 1980s for three years.&lt;ref name="BBC dies" /&gt;

==Later life==

On release he gained a profile as a media "former criminal" figure, and acted as a consultant on the film ''[[Buster (film)|Buster]]'', with [[Larry Lamb (actor)|Larry Lamb]] portraying Reynolds. Reynolds then published his autobiography ''The Autobiography of a Thief'' (1995).&lt;ref name="autobio"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Autobiography of a Thief: The Man Behind The Great Train Robbery |author=Bruce Reynolds|year=1995|ISBN=0753510502}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Reynolds commented that the Great Train Robbery had proved a curse that followed him around, as after it no-one wanted to employ him either legally or illegally:&lt;ref name=TelgDeath&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9900060/Bruce-Reynolds-the-Great-Train-Robbery-mastermind-dies.html|title=Bruce Reynolds, the Great Train Robbery mastermind, dies|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=28 February 2013|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|I became an old crook living on handouts from other old crooks.}}

Having either spent or had removed by courts the monies that he gained through crime, by the 1990s Reynolds was living on [[income support]] in a flat in [[Croydon]], [[Greater London]], supplied by a charitable trust.&lt;ref name="BBC dies"/&gt; Reynolds' wife predeceased him.&lt;ref name="G o"/&gt; He died on the afternoon of 28 February 2013 at the age of 81.&lt;ref name="BBC dies"&gt;{{cite news|title=Great Train Robber Bruce Reynolds dies aged 81|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21617926|accessdate=28 February 2013|publisher=BBC News|date=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="G o"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/28/bruce-reynolds|title=Obituary: Bruce Reynolds|publisher=The Guardian|date=28 February 2013|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="house"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/3360013/The-Train-Robber-House-On-the-spree-in-Torquay.html The "Train Robber House"]&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, Reynolds was working on'' The Great Train Robbery 50th Anniversary:1963&amp;ndash;2013'', published by Mpress in July 2013.

==In popular culture==
Multiple media properties and parodies have been produced about the Great Train Robbery [see [[Great Train Robbery (1963)#Details of the Great Train Robbery and the robbers|Details of the Great Train Robbery and the robbers]]]. Examples featuring Bruce Reynolds include: [[Horst Tappert#Filmography|''Die Gentlemen bitten zur Kasse'' (''The Gentleman Prefers Payment'', also known as ''Great British Train Robbery'')]] which aired on TV-Dreiteiler in 1966 and featured [[Horst Tappert]] as Reynolds, ''[[Robbery (1967 film)|Robbery]]'' (1967) with [[Stanley Baker]] as a character based upon Reynolds, and ''[[Buster (film)|Buster]]'' (1988) with [[Larry Lamb (actor)|Larry Lamb]] as Reynolds.

In 2008, [[Shaun Micallef]] parodied Reynolds in Series 2, Episode 9 of an Australian Satirical Comedy News Series [[Newstopia]]. In 2012, Reynolds was portrayed in the television series ''[[Mrs Biggs]]'' by [[Jay Simpson (actor)|Jay Simpson]].

He was also the subject of the song "Have You Seen Bruce Richard Reynolds", originally by Nigel Denver and later covered by the UK band [[Alabama 3]].  Reynolds himself appears on the Alabama 3 version.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Track List for Outlaw 2005 by Alabama 3|publication-place=Alabama 3 official site |url= http://www.alabama3.co.uk/en/general_articles/outlaw |accessdate=13 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day that [[Ronnie Biggs|Biggs]] died,  18 December 2013, the [[BBC]] broadcast the first of a two part series, ''[[The Great Train Robbery (2013 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'', which provides a dramatisation of the events first from the criminals' perspective and then from that of the police. The program had already been scheduled for broadcast on that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/18/ronnie-biggs-picks-moment-great-train-robbery |title=Ronnie Biggs picks his moment one last time |publisher=The Guardian |date=18 December 2013 |accessdate=23 December 2013 |last=Campbell |first=Duncan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Reynolds was played by Welsh actor [[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/5glBpR157xrv3BztXK3NNDf/bruce-reynolds |title=Bruce Reynolds |publisher=[[BBC One]] |date=|accessdate=22 June 2017 |last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21609">The '''Cincinnati May Festival''' is a two-week annual [[choral music|choral]] festival, held in May in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], US.
[[File:The Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and May Festival Chorus.jpg|thumb|The May Festival Chorus and Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra join forces in Cincinnati's Music Hall]]

==History==
The festival's roots go back to the 1840s, when ''[[Saengerfest]]s'' were held in that city, bringing singers from all over the United States and abroad to perform large scale [[european classical music|classical]] works of the day.

In ''A City That Sings,'' we find a description of Cincinnati in the late 1800s: "In the final decades of the nineteenth century Cincinnati cemented its position as one of America's cultural leaders with the founding of the still flourishing May Festival (1873), the [[Cincinnati Art Museum]] (1886) and its neighbor in [[Eden Park|Cincinnati]], the [[Cincinnati Art Academy]] (1887), and the [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]] (1895).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roma|Rivers|Pendle|Pendle|2012|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singing societies were very popular in the nineteenth century and the tradition was no different in Cincinnati. Both the English and German societies were evident.
As a rule, the differences between the two national choral traditions were in language, origin, composition, and social scope. English societies, the earliest of Cincinnati's choral ensembles, existed primarily to make music. The first German society was founded in 1825, but the majority of these organizations arose after an immigration boom in the late 1840s. They provided social opportunities for eating and drinking, as well as making music. Most of the German societies were men's choruses, but women were sometimes admitted, often as non-singing supporting members, in the last half of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roma|Rivers|Pendle|Pendle|2012|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1863, a circular was sent to the 'Musical Public of Cincinnati' to extend a 'cordial invitation to singers, both ladies and gentlemen, who will take an interest in building up a large Choral Society, such as the old societies of Boston and New York, to join.' This mixed chorus approach to presenting oratorio with members drawn from a broad spectrum of Cincinnati's singers regardless of the nationality or society to which they pledged allegiance, must be regarded as an important precedent of the May Festival.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvp|Roma|Rivers|Pendle|Pendle|2012|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maria Longworth Nichols Storer.jpg|thumb|Maria Longworth Nichols Storer]]
[[Maria Longworth Nichols Storer]] the granddaughter of [[Nicholas Longworth]], a banker and winemaker, and wife of Colonel [[George Ward Nichols]] took a trip to England in 1871. There she witnessed one of the large English festivals. At home, Mr. Nichols was a member of the Harmonic Society, so the couple was involved in choral music of the English variety. Mrs. Nichols knew Cincinnati's choral tradition was the perfect place to start a musical festival of their own. She wrote to [[Theodore Thomas (conductor)|Theodore Thomas]], a renowned American, conductor and asked for a meeting with him on his next visit to Cincinnati.&lt;ref name="Roma_133"&gt;{{harvp|Roma|Rivers|Pendle|Pendle|2012|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Theodore thomas.jpg|210px|thumb]]
He recounts: 'On my…visit in 1871 [sic—it was 1872] a young married lady, member of one of the leading families, laid before me a plan for a large Musical Festival. She proposed that I should be the conductor of it, saying that I would be responsible for the artistic side, she would find the men who would take charge of the business details. I soon found out that this lady was not only very talented in may ways, but that her taste was not amateurish in anything, and I readily consented to undertake the work she wished me to do.'&lt;ref name="Roma_133"/&gt; He agreed to be conductor of the Festival if fifty thousand dollars could be raised for a guarantee fund and a committee could be formed to take care of the business aspects of the event.&lt;ref name="Roma_133"/&gt; Mrs. Nichols's biographer, Sr. Rose Angela Boehle, mentions that Maria and Col. Nichols started the guarantee fund of the 1873 Festival with a five-thousand-dollar contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roma|Rivers|Pendle|Pendle|2012|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the first actions of the Executive Committee was the hiring of Theordore Thomas as musical director and Carl Barus as director of the chorus. Thomas's touring orchestra would play, as they would continue to do at every festival until 1904. Arthur Mees, a Cincinnati music teacher, was named rehearsal accompanist and later, festival organist.&lt;ref name="Roma_135"&gt;{{harvp|Roma|Rivers|Pendle|Pendle|2012|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the artistic forces were almost entirely German, the administrative team that planned the event was mostly of English descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roma|Rivers|Pendle|Pendle|2012|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; A circular describing the expectations of chorus members was printed in English and German and distributed to 121 music dealers, 60 post offices, and 144 singing societies. It was also distributed to 1,120 newspapers throughout Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and 'the leading papers of the West.'&lt;ref name="Roma_135"/&gt; According to the superintendent of the chorus, Samuel D. Carey, by the time the first performance took place, the chorus had 706 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roma|Rivers|Pendle|Pendle|2012|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 1873 Festival==
"The orchestra is German; the music three-fourths German, and the other fourth exotic; scarcely half the singers were native-born; but, despite all this, it is thoroughly American, for nothing but that attenuated and intensified form of Anglo-Saxon called the Yankee could ever have supplied the nerve-force needed to carry on such a mammoth affair."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Van Cleve|1875}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Performances included repertoire that was overwhelmingly German. Handel, Bach, Beethoven, Haydn, and Mozart comprised the first two concerts. Of the sixty works on the seven concerts, only five were by composers not born in a German-speaking country. The matinee concerts consisted largely of arias, art songs, and light orchestral works, including isolated movements of symphonies, Strauss waltzes, and overtures. Thomas's evening concerts were more formal and consisted of major vocal and choral works, including Handel's ''Dettingen Te Deum'', scenes from Gluck's ''Orfeo ed Euridice'', and Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, along with purely symphonic works and concert arias.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roma|Rivers|Pendle|Pendle|2012|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 1875 Festival==
A second May Festival took place at Saengerfest Hall in 1875, and presented the American premieres of Bach's Magnificat and Brahms's Triumphlied. During this festival, Cincinnati's usual springtime thunderstorms pelted the leaky tin roof of the hall with rain and hail, as they had done to a lesser degree in 1873. The cavernous hall acted as a resonating chamber and Thomas had to stop the concerts on more than one occasion to let the storms pass. Two other problems with the hall were mentioned in the press reports of the first festival, which no doubt persisted in 1875. The reporter from the Gazette mentioned that the temperature in the hall was too warm. The situation was 'promptly remedied by a member of the Executive Committee who crashed out the glass from every window whose frame was wedged too tight in its place to be readily removed.' Another problem arose as the audience, estimated at four thousand with two thousand more in the streets, seems to have grown somewhat frustrated by the crowded conditions in the hall and complained that allowing one thousand people to stand in the aisles 'sorely disappoints ticket-holders who selected their seats on the aisles with especial purpose.'&lt;ref name="Roma_141"&gt;{{harvp|Roma|Rivers|Pendle|Pendle|2012|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music Hall and the 1878 Festival==
Kentucky-born railroad entrepreneur Reuben Springer was so annoyed by the hall problems that he made the initial $125,000 donation to create a matching fund to enable the construction of a new music hall.&lt;ref name="Roma_141"/&gt;

The area chosen for the new [[Music Hall (Cincinnati)|Music Hall]] was close to the Community Hospital, Insane Asylum, and the Pest House . When inmates or patients expired, they were interred in Potter's Field, the present site of Music Hall. Over two hundred wagon loads of bones were moved to Spring Grove Cemetery and reburied in a mass grave. Stories of hauntings in the hall survive to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roma|Rivers|Pendle|Pendle|2012|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction for the hall began on May 1, 1877, just a year before the third May Festival was to begin. It was dedicated on May 14 at the first concert of the 1878 May Festival. (125) Tickets for the first festival held in Music Hall were, "$2 for a single reserved seat, $1 for standing room, and $10 dollars for the entire set of seven concert."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Vitz|1986|p=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cincinnati's May Festival has taken place in Springer Auditorium since 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roma|Rivers|Pendle|Pendle|2012|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Edward Elgar in Cincinnati==
After the death of Theodore Thomas in 1905, the 1906 May Festival featured British composer Sir [[Edward Elgar]] conducting his oratorio The Dream of Gerontius at the final concert. … Elgar was the most prominent British composer and much of his music was popular in the U.S. He conducted the second, fifth, and sixth concerts of the festival, and spent the preceding two weeks rehearsing his music with the performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roma|Rivers|Pendle|Pendle|2012|pp=141–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theodore Thomas had previously conducted Gerotius at the 1904 May Festival, and its success and the fame of the composer may have drawn the Board of Directors to consider the composer for a guest conductor and celebrity at the upcoming festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Padgett|2006|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enraging the chorus, Lawrence Maxwell, Jr., vice-president of the May Festival Association stated that he was "against the giving of the memorial concert, saying that ist had not the sanction of the board, that the program was a log of 'has,' and that it would make Thomas turn in his grave to listen to it."  …The Festival Board, in an act of either reconciliation or humiliation towards the chorus, planned its own memorial concert to open the 1906 May Festival. The chorus responded in a letter by demanding Maxwell's resignation, adding that "if the Board of Directors do not find this request acceptable, we find no other course open to us than to insist that this communication shall constitute the resignation of the chorus, to take effect at once." The May Festival Chorus was soon disbanded, and the Board of Directors chose Maxwell as the next president of the May Festival Association.&lt;ref name="harvp|Padgett|2006|p=8"&gt;{{harvp|Padgett|2006|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the midst of the upheaval, the festival reorganized its board and established a marketing plan for the 1906 concerts to choose "[Frank] Van der Stucken as festival conductor, and to depend upon Sir Edward Elgar as a foreign attraction." Frank van der Stucken was the conductor of the recently formed Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, and the board decided that the Cincinnati orchestra would play in the 1906 May Festival for the first time.&lt;ref name="harvp|Padgett|2006|p=8"/&gt;

The previous festivals had had open rehearsals and many other public opportunities for Cincinnatians to meet and mingle with the stars, but this would not be the case in 1906. With a completely restructured program, Frank Van der Stucken anticipated rehearsals would be full of personnel problems and musical challenges and considered options that would allow the performers to focus on the music.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Padgett|2006|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final concert was held on the same evening, and the program consisted of The Dream of Gerontius followed by Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Padgett|2006|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The May Festival and Cincinnati School Music==
However, perhaps the appearances of massed school choirs most valued by Cincinnatians were those in the then-biennial May Festivals. At the first May Festivals (1873 and 1875) a large chorus of pupils and teachers from the city's intermediate, secondary, and normal schools presented music learned in their public school classes. Beginning in 1882, planners of the festivals began working student choral ensembles into the regular festival repertoire, such as Bach's St. Matthew Passion, Berlioz's Damnation of Faust, and Te Deum, Handel's Judas Maccabeus, or Rubinstein's Tower of Babel. In 1897 a Children's May Festival, utilizing some 2,000 students from the city schools, presented Franz Abt's Cinderella.

Choruses of school children continue to be welcome participants in such major works as Orff's Carmina Burana, Walton's Belshazzar's Feast, Mahler's Symphony No. 3, and Britten's War Requiem. All these accomplishments would have been impossible had not Cincinnati schools, both public and parochial, introduced music into their curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roma|Rivers|Pendle|Pendle|2012|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable performances and recent history==

Perhaps the largest work in the repertoire, Mahler's Symphony No. 8, often called The Symphony of a Thousand, received a then-rare performance at the 1931 festival with a chorus of nine hundred, a massive orchestra, and eight soloists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roma|Rivers|Pendle|Pendle|2012|pp=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African-American composer Robert Nathaniel Dett's oratorio The Ordering of Moses appeared on the 1937 May Festival.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{harvp|Roma|Rivers|Pendle|Pendle|2012|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the May Festival Chorus and Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra gave a full performance of the oratorio in [[Carnegie Hall]].

During times of war and tragedy, the May Festival has traditionally stepped forward to honor heroes and soothe the pain. During World War II, patriotic music held price of place in 1942 and performers donated their services. All proceeds were given to the Cincinnati War Chest. In 1944 a chorus of Women's Army Corps members from Ft. Campbell, Kentucky, performed Frank Loesser's The WAC Hymn and many soldiers attended the festival. Just one month after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania, the May Festival Chorus traveled to New York's Carnegie Hall to perform Britten's powerful War Requiem with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and James Conlon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roma|Rivers|Pendle|Pendle|2012|pp=145, 151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the United States entered World War II, the problems necessitated a three-year span until the next Festival. And then it was reduced to three concerts with a very much abridged program due to the shortage of paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sheblessy|1973|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Victory Festival in 1946 opened with the Hallelujah Chorus and the whole program was dedicated to the blessings of peace. The Folk Song Symphony by Roy Harris had 500 high school students singing as their costumes divided the chorus stand into three broad stripes of red, white and blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sheblessy|1973|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1967 the May Festival was held every two years with only a few exceptions, but since then it has been given every year.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Adolphus Hailstork also composed 'Earthrise,' a work for double chorus and orchestra commissioned by the May Festival in 2006 to promote healing following the 2000 riots. The piece featured a white chorus on one side of the risers and an African American chorus on the other side, who by the end form a visual metaphor by interweaving to create a racially harmonic gesture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roma|Rivers|Pendle|Pendle|2012|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

May Festival opened its doors to African American singers in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roma|Rivers|Pendle|Pendle|2012|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The all-volunteer May Festival Chorus has been under the direction of [[Robert Porco]] since 1989. The chorus rehearses on Tuesday evenings during the academic year from 7-10pm.  The chorus performs regularly with the Cincinnati Symphony and Pops Orchestras, singing at [[Music Hall (Cincinnati)]] as well as [[Riverbend Music Center]].  The May Festival Chorus has garnered critical acclaim for its high level of performance. The May Festival Chamber Chorus performs at the Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption in northern Kentucky during the annual May Festival and at various community concerts throughout the year. [[File:Music Hall Springer Auditorium.jpg|thumb|Music Hall Springer Auditorium]]

In addition, in 1986 the May Festival Youth Chorus was formed.  Made up of youth from area high-schools, the MFYC is conducted by James Bagwell and gives its members (who must audition competitively) the opportunity to perform challenging music well above the average high school level.  The MFYC also has the opportunity to perform with the adult May Festival throughout the year, most notably during May Festival.

On December 5, 2017, the Cincinnati May Festival canceled conductor [[James Levine]]’s appearance in May 2018, after he was accused by four males of [[sexual abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2017/12/05/levine-s-cincinnati-appearance-canceled-amid-sex.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

''°For some Festivals, no chorus master was designated. An "assistant music director" was designated instead.''

Between 1905 and 1946, music directors of the [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]] (founded in 1895) also were engaged as music director of the biannual choral festival ([[Frank Van der Stucken]], [[Ernst Kunwald]], [[Eugène Ysaÿe]], [[Fritz Reiner]], and [[Eugene Aynsley Goossens|Eugene Goosens]] held the reins during those years). [[Fritz Busch]] and [[Josef Krips]] led festivals between 1948 and 1960.

With the appointment of [[Max Rudolf (conductor)|Max Rudolf]] as director of the festival in 1963, the festival became an annual event in 1967, as it is today. In the 1970s, the centennial of both the festival (1973) and Music Hall (1978) was celebrated with the tenures of [[Julius Rudel]] (director from 1971 to 1973) and [[James Levine]] (1974 to 1978). [[James Conlon]] became director in 1979.

When Leonard Bernstein conducted the festival in its centennial year, he ascribed the true strength of the endeavor with his typical aplomb:
	'One of the most valuable features of Cincinnati's festival as I see it is that it preserves the involvement of the community chorus…. I don't know how the May Festival does it! … I'm filled with admiration at what they accomplish.'&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

'''DaDaFest''' is a disability arts organisation based in Liverpool, UK. It delivers an international, biennial festival and organises other events to promote disability and deaf arts from a variety of cultural perspectives.&lt;ref name="DAonline_Review"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/dadafest2012-reviews |title= Review of DaDaFest 2012 |date= 1 September 2012 | website = disabilityartsonline.org.uk | publisher = Disability Arts Online |accessdate= 12 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the festival and events, DaDaFest organises opportunities for disabled and deaf people to gain access to the arts.&lt;ref name="Arts_award"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsaward.org.uk/site/?id=2430&amp;action=preview&amp;backTo=index |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070725/http://www.artsaward.org.uk/site/?id=2430&amp;action=preview&amp;backTo=index |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 March 2016 |title= Arts Award Involvement |publisher=Arts Award |date= |accessdate= 12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes training and a youth focused programme.&lt;ref name="Young_DaDa"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dadafest.co.uk/initiatives-projects/research-projects/young-dada-steering-group/ |title= Young DaDa Steering Group | website = dadafest.co.uk | publisher = DaDaFest |accessdate= 12 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DaDaFest is funded by [[Arts Council England]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/browse-regularly-funded-organisations/npo/dada-disability-deaf-arts/ |title= Arts Council Funding DaDaFest | website = artscouncil.org.uk |publisher=Arts Council England |date= |accessdate=12 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Liverpool City Council]] as well as other private and public sector partners.

==History==
DaDaFest was founded as ''Arts Integrated Merseyside'' (or AIM) as a part of the [[Shape Arts]] network in 1984. AIM was integral to the early campaign for greater equality and access for disabled people, but was not disability led.&lt;ref name="Case"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disabilityarts.creativecase.org.uk/creativecase-DaDa-Disability-and-Deaf-Arts |title= DaDaFest Case Study |date= | website = disabilityarts.creativecase.org.uk | publisher = Disability Arts: Creative Case |accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[John McGrath (artistic director)|John McGrath]] as its Development Officer,&lt;ref name="DA_online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/chronology_disability_arts_1976_1989 |title= Disability Arts Chronology &amp;nbsp; 1976 - 1989: (1986) |date= 16 January 2009 | website = disabilityartsonline.org.uk | publisher = Disability Arts Online |accessdate= 2 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="J_McGrath"&gt;{{cite web| title = Interview: Under the Skin with John McGrath | url = http://www.dadafest.co.uk/2017/01/interview-under-the-skin-with-john-mcgrath/ | website = dadafest.co.uk | publisher = DaDaFest | date = 23 January 2017 |accessdate= 2 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the organisation became one of the UK's first disability control-led arts forums after it broke away from the [[Shape Arts|Shape Network]] and set itself up as ''North West Disability Arts Forum'' (NWDAF) in 1986. It was formally constituted in 1990,&lt;ref name="Case" /&gt; with [[Mandy Colleran]] becoming its director.&lt;ref name="DA_online2"&gt;{{cite web | last = Bidder | first = Joe |title= Ruth Gould: Creative Force in Disability Arts |url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/profile_of_ruth_gould | website = disabilityartsonline.org.uk | publisher = Disability Arts Online |date= 8 May 2008 | accessdate= 6 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation eventually re-branded itself to 'DaDa - Disability and Deaf Arts' in 2008 and again to 'DaDaFest' in 2012.

==Festival==
DaDaFest delivered its first international festival in 2001 and continued to put on yearly festivals until 2010 when it became a biennial. The festival has since taken place in 2012 and 2014 (8 November 2014 – 11 January 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DaDaFest International 2014 Announced|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/dadafest-international-2014-announced | website = disabilityartsonline.org.uk | publisher = Disability Arts Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next DaDaFest International festival will take place from 18 November to 3 December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Festival|url=http://www.dadafest.co.uk/the-festival/ | website = dadafest.co.uk | publisher = DaDaFest }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation works with a number of partners to deliver the festival. These include: [[National Museums Liverpool]], [[Liverpool Biennial]], [[Bluecoat Chambers|The Bluecoat]], [[Liverpool Everyman]], [[Liverpool Playhouse]], [[FACT (the Foundation for Art and Creative Technology)|FACT]], [[Unity Theatre, Liverpool|Unity Theatre]] and [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic]] amongst others.

=== 2016 Festival ===
DaDaFest International 2014 presented  high quality and exciting work produced by artists close to their home in Liverpool as well as internationally that will challenge ideals and celebrate disability culture. An exciting programme of music, dance, live arts, comedy and much more was presented." Highlights included:

Beheler|last=|first=|date=March 14, 2017|website=Find Law|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in regards to what constitutes custody in the requirement to read [[Miranda rights]]) but also in other federal court cases related to Miranda law and definition of custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://leb.fbi.gov/2016/february/legal-digest-when-does-handcuffing-constitute-custody-for-purposes-of-miranda|title=When does handcuffing constitute custody for purposes of Miranda|last=Holcomb|first=Jayme|date=February 20, 2016|website=FBI|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Miranda warning|Miranda law]] has roughly defined custody as the "formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement,"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; colloquial language may be less restrictive in the use of custody and is thus sometimes difficult to distinguish from the process of [[arrest]]. In addition to collecting data on those who have died in custody, the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] also tracks all deaths related to arrest. This aids in collecting data from the fringes of custody or attempts to arrest an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&amp;tid=82|title=Arrest related deaths|last=|first=|date=March 14, 2017|website=Bureau of Justice Statistics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Causes of death ====
The causes for death in police custody may range from suspected [[homicide]] by members of the police, killings by other inmates, death due to [[Psychological abuse|psychological]] or [[physical abuse]], [[capital punishment]], to [[suicide]], accidental death, or [[Death by natural causes|natural causes]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&amp;tid=82|title=Data Collection: Deaths In Custody Reporting Program (DCRP)|last=|first=|date=March 14, 2017|website=Bureau of Justice Statistics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sudden Deaths in Custody|last=Ross|first=Darrell|publisher=Humana Press|year=2006|isbn=978-1-58829-475-3|location=Totowa, N.J.|pages=15–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bureau of Justice Statistics|United States Bureau of Justice Statistics]] collects data regarding both the cause of death, as well as medical and criminal records of those that die in police custody (restricted to those in federal prison and local jails).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Estimates ====
The [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] estimates that 17,358 individuals in custody died during the period from 2007-2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zheng|first=Zhen|year=2016|title=Assessing Inmate Cause of Death|url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/aicddcrpndi.pdf|journal=Bureau of Justice Statistics|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other publications focus on the rate per 100,000. US jails report deaths that total a [[mortality rate]] of 128, and prisons at 264 per 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heide|first=Steffen|year=2016|title=Deaths in Police Custody|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1752928X16000366|journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine|volume=|pages=|via=Elsevier Science Direct|doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2016.01.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are differences in methodology used to obtain these statistics, as some jurisdictions include deaths during attempted arrests, while others do not. 

Other research has focused on specific states, such as [[Maryland]] and the rate of death by identity (gender, race, age).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Southall|first=Pamela|year=2008|title=Police custody deaths in Maryland, USA: An examination of 45 cases|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1752928X07001606|journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine|volume=15|pages=227–230|via=Elsevier Science Direct|doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2007.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on some findings, African-American males appear to be over-represented as victims of sudden custody deaths. Firther research with larger sample sizes is necessary.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Watchdog organizations ====
[[The Marshall Project]] collects and produces reports on police killings as well as maintaining a curated list of links to articles and publications related to death in police custody in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.themarshallproject.org/records/543-death-in-police-custody#.ty0lmTcfm|title=Death in Police Custody|last=|first=|date=February 12, 2017|website=The Marshall Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Foreign custody by American agents (police, military, etc.) ====

===== International custody law =====
There are numerous laws and international treaties regarding treatment of foreigners, especially during wartime, of which the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Convention]] is the most widely recognized and internationally ratified. It contains provisions that classify and define both prisoners of war (as well as civilians and the wounded or infirm) and the manner in which they are to be treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/geneva_conventions|title=Geneva Conventions|last=Kim|first=Jonathan|date=July 2016|website=Cornell University Law School|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include but are not limited to: murder, mutilation, hostage taking, and outrages upon personal dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/1595a804df7efd6bc125641400640d89/6fef854a3517b75ac125641e004a9e68?OpenDocument|title=Convention (III) relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21642">'''Dolphin drive hunting''', also called '''dolphin drive fishing''', is a method of [[hunting]] [[dolphin]]s and occasionally other small [[cetacean]]s by driving them together with boats and then usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the open sea or ocean with boats and nets. Dolphins are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the [[Solomon Islands]], the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Peru]], and [[Japan]], the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, dolphins are mostly hunted for their [[whale meat|meat]]; some end up in [[dolphinarium]]s.

Despite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism, and the possible health risk that the often polluted meat causes, thousands of dolphins are caught in drive hunts each year.

[[File:Killed pilot wales in hvalba, faroe islands.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Killed [[pilot whale]]s on the beach in the village [[Hvalba]] on the southernmost Faroese island [[Suðuroy]], August 2002]]

Whaling in the [[Faroe Islands]] takes the form of beaching and slaughtering [[long-finned pilot whale]]s. It has been practiced since about the time of the first [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlements on these [[North Atlantic]] islands, and thus can be considered [[aboriginal whaling]]. It is mentioned in the [[Sheep Letter]], a Faroese law from 1298, a supplement to the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Gulating]] law.&lt;ref name="Disappearing Foods"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XR9YIaG0kIcC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=sheep+letter+1298+grind&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMI0OvI-omKxwIVxWvbCh2yjg9W#v=onepage&amp;q=sheep%20letter%201298%20grind&amp;f=false|title=Disappearing Foods: Studies in Foods and Dishes at Risk|last=Walker|first=Harlan|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is regulated by the Faroese authorities.&lt;ref name="logir.fo"&gt;[http://www.logir.fo/Logtingslog/56-fra-19-05-2015-um-grind-og-annan-smahval logir.fo]&lt;/ref&gt; Around 800 long-finned pilot whales&lt;ref name="hagstova.fo"&gt;[http://www.hagstova.fo/fo/hagtalsgrunnur/vinna-og-veida/grind Grind | Hagstova Føroya&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2012}} and some [[Atlantic white-sided dolphin]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grinds de 2000 à 2013 |url=http://www.whaling.fo/Default.aspx?ID=7125 |website=www.whaling.fo/ Catch figures |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106012321/http://whaling.fo/Default.aspx?ID=7125 |archivedate=6 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are slaughtered annually, mainly during the summer. The hunts, called ''grindadráp'' in [[Faroese language|Faroese]], are non-commercial and are organized on a community level. Anyone who has a special training certificate on slaughtering a pilot whale with the spinal-cord lance can participate.&lt;ref name="Certificate2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in.fo/news-detail/news/nu-eru-1380-foeroyingar-klarir-at-fara-i-grind/|title=Nú eru 1380 føroyingar klárir at fara í grind|last=Bertholdsen|first=Áki|date=5 March 2015|publisher=Sosialurin - in.fo|language=Faroese|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not necessary earlier, but because of constant criticism from animal welfare organizations, the Faroese people try to improve the slaughtering methods in order to make them more humane. The Grind law was updated in 2015, where one of the regulations demanded that the whalers followed a course on how to slaughter a pilot whale with the spinal-cord lance.&lt;ref name="The Grind Law"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logir.fo/Logtingslog/56-fra-19-05-2015-um-grind-og-annan-smahval|title=Løgtingslóg um grind og annan smáhval, sum seinast broytt við løgtingslóg nr. 93 frá 22. juni 2015|date=19 May 2015|publisher=Logir.fo|language=Faroese|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police and Grindaformenn are allowed to remove people from the grind area.&lt;ref name="logir.fo"/&gt; The hunters first surround the pilot whales with a wide semicircle of boats. The boats then drive the pilot whales into a [[bay]] or to the bottom of a [[fjord]]. Not all bays are certified, and the slaughter will only take place on a certified beach.

Many Faroese consider the whale meat an important part of their food culture and history. Animal rights groups criticize the slaughter as being cruel and unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/1618799/faroe_whale_killing_a_cruel_and_unnecessary_ritual_or_a_sustainable_food_practice.html theecologist.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Knowledge 2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theknowledgeplymouth.co.uk/whaling-in-the-faroe-islands-a-cruel-and-unnecessary-ritual-or-sustainable-food-practice/|title=Whaling in the Faroe Islands: a cruel and unnecessary ritual or sustainable food practice?|last=Barrat|first=Harry|date=3 February 2014|publisher=The Knowledge|accessdate=2 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222112614/http://theknowledgeplymouth.co.uk/whaling-in-the-faroe-islands-a-cruel-and-unnecessary-ritual-or-sustainable-food-practice/|archive-date=22 December 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Advocacy for Animals 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://advocacy.britannica.com/blog/advocacy/2010/04/the-faroe-islands-whale-hunt/|title=The Faroe Islands Whale Hunt|last=Duignan|first=Brian|date=26 April 2010|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica - Advocacy for Animals|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008, Høgni Debes Joensen, chief medical officer of the Faroe Islands and Pál Weihe, scientist, have recommended in a letter to the Faroese government that pilot whales should no longer be considered fit for human consumption because of the high level of [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]] and [[DDT]] derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landslaeknin.fo/upload/tilmaeli_um_grind.pdf landslaeknin.fo]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="toxic-whale"&gt;{{cite news |first=Debora |last=MacKenzie |date=28 November 2008 |title=Faroe islanders told to stop eating 'toxic' whales. |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16159-faroe-islanders-told-to-stop-eating-toxic-whales.html |work=[[New Scientist]] |accessdate=21 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Faroese government did not forbid whaling. On 1 July 2011 the Faroese Food and Veterinary Authority announced their recommendation regarding the safety of eating meat and blubber from the pilot whale, which was not as strict as the one of the chief medical officer. The new recommendation says only one dinner with whale meat and blubber per month, with a special recommendation for younger women, girls, pregnant women and breastfeeding women.&lt;ref name="hfs.fo"&gt;[http://www.hfs.fo/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/HFS/WWW_HFS_FO/UMSITING/KUNNANDITILFAR/KUNNANDITILFARFRABODANIR/KUNNTILFFRAMATVORUR/GRIND_0.PDF hsf.fo – the Faroese Food- and veterinary authority] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810183632/http://www.hfs.fo/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/HFS/WWW_HFS_FO/UMSITING/KUNNANDITILFAR/KUNNANDITILFARFRABODANIR/KUNNTILFFRAMATVORUR/GRIND_0.PDF |date=10 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2002 to 2009 the PCB concentration in whale meat has fallen by 75%, DDT values in the same time period have fallen by 70% and mercury levels have also fallen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://us.fo/Default.aspx?ID=10642|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206224651/http://us.fo/Default.aspx?ID=10642|archive-date=February 6, 2015|title=Kyksilvur í grind}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iceland===
{{Main|Whaling in Iceland}}
In mid-1950s, fishermen in Iceland requested assistance from the government to remove [[killer whale]]s from Icelandic waters as they damaged fishing equipment. With fisheries accounting for 20% of Iceland's employment at the time, the perceived economic impact was significant. The Icelandic government asked the United States for assistance. As a [[NATO]] ally with an air base in Iceland, the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] deployed Patrol Squadrons VP-18 and VP-7 to achieve this task. According to the US Navy, hundreds of animals were killed with [[machinegun]]s, [[rocket]]s and [[depth charge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;United States Navy Archive / Naval Aviation News (1956) [http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1950s/1956/dec56.pdf Killer Whales Destroyed - VP-7 accomplishes special task] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309231158/http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1950s/1956/dec56.pdf |date=March 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s, after the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972]] and the ban on hunting killer whales in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] in 1976 as discussed later in this article, the hunting of killer whales in Iceland resumed, this time aiming to capture live animals for the entertainment industry. The first two Killer Whales captured went to [[Dolfinarium Harderwijk]] in the [[Netherlands]]. One of these animals was soon after transferred to [[SeaWorld]]. These captures continued until 1989, with the additional animals going to SeaWorld, [[Marineland (Antibes)|Marineland Antibes]], [[MarineLand|Marineland Canada]], [[Kamogawa Sea World]], [[Ocean Park, Hong Kong|Ocean Park Hong Kong]] and [[Conny-Land]].&lt;ref&gt;PBS - Frontline - [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/whales/etc/cron.html A whale of a business - historical chronology], article retrieved 9 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although commercial whaling does still take place in Icelandic waters today, dolphins are no longer hunted and [[whale watching]] is popular amongst tourists.

=== Japan ===
{{Main|Taiji dolphin drive hunt}}
{{See also|Fishing industry in Japan|Whaling in Japan}}
[[File:Taiji.JPG|thumb|The fishing village of [[Taiji, Wakayama|Taiji]]]]

The '''Taiji dolphin drive hunt''' captures small cetaceans for [[whale meat|their meat]] and, latterly, for sale to [[dolphinarium]]s.[[Taiji, Wakayama|Taiji]] has a long connection to [[whaling in Japan|Japanese whaling]]. The 2009 documentary film ''[[The Cove (film)|The Cove]]'' drew international attention to the hunt. Taiji is the only town in Japan where drive hunting still takes place on a large scale. Concern is majority through the methodology of the hunt, as actions are viewed as inhumane. An article by ''[[National Geographic]]'' refers to The [[Japanese Association of Zoos and Aquariums]]' decision to no longer support the Taiji hunt. In 2015, it was announced that there would be a ban in the buying and selling of dolphins through the means of this hunt.

=== Kiribati ===
Similar drive hunting existed in [[Kiribati]] at least until the mid 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;British diplomat Arthur Grimble's memoir, ''A Pattern of Islands'' (1952)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dusky Dolphin being skinned.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Dusky dolphin]] being skinned on a boat in Peru.]]

According to estimates from local animal welfare organisation Mundo Azul released in October 2013, between 1,000 and 2,000 dolphins are killed annually for consumption, with a further 5,000 to 15,000 being killed for use as shark bait.

Dolphin are hunted in Malaita, in the [[Solomon Islands]] in the [[South Sea Islands|South Pacific]], mainly for [[whale meat|their meat]] and teeth, and also sometimes for live capture for [[dolphinarium]]s.

On the [[Penghu Islands]] in [[Taiwan]], drive fishing of Bottlenose Dolphins was practiced until 1990, when the practice was outlawed by the government. Mainly [[Indian Ocean Bottlenose Dolphin]]s but also common Bottlenose Dolphins were captured in these hunts.&lt;ref&gt;R. R. Reeves, W. F. Perrin, B. L. Taylor, C. S. Baker and S. L. Mesnick (2004), ''Report of the Workshop on Shortcomings of Cetacean Taxonomy in Relation to Needs of Conservation and Management'', page 27, section ''Management of cetacean exploitation''.

====New England====
From 1644 at [[Southampton, New York]], on [[Long Island]], the colonists established an organised whale fishery, chasing [[pilot whale]]s ("blackfish") onto the shelving beaches for slaughter. They also processed [[drift whale]]s they found on shore. They observed the Native Americans hunting techniques, improved on their weapons and boats, and then went out to ocean hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Federal Writers' Project|title=Whaling Masters|publisher=Works Progress Administration|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hawaii ====
In ancient [[Hawaii]], fishermen occasionally hunted dolphins for their meat by driving them onto the beach and killing them. In their ancient legal system, dolphin meat was considered to be ''[[kapu]]'' (forbidden) for women together with several other kinds of food. Today, dolphin drive hunting no longer takes place in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;Earthtrust (year unknown), [https://web.archive.org/web/20130816121045/http://earthtrust.org/wlcurric/dolphins.html - Hunting/Subsistence Use], article retrieved on June 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Texas ====
Hunting dolphins (at the time still often incorrectly referred to as fish or porpoises), primarily using harpoons and firearms, was considered a form of recreational hunting along the shores of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in [[Texas]] in the late 19th and early 20th century. Pleasure dolphin hunting cruises could be booked in [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]] in the 1920s, with a promise to tourists that if no successful dolphin kill was made, the excursion would be free of charge.&lt;ref name="Caller"&gt;Allison Ehrlich, David Sikes for the Corpus Christi Caller (2011), [http://www.caller.com/news/2011/apr/10/the-evolution-of-our-attitudes-on-dolphin/ Bottlenose dolphins make journey from harpoon target to darling of the sea], article retrieved 9 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The brutality of the practice started to spark animal welfare concerns and there is no reference of this practice still occurring in Texas after the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name="Caller"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Galveston Daily News (1936) / Newspaper Archive [https://newspaperarchive.com/us/texas/galveston/galveston-daily-news/1936/12-04/page-9?tag=porpoise+harpoon&amp;rtserp=tags/porpoise-harpoon?pci=7 Man who had porpoise on line tells of companion's loyalty and pitiful moans.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Washington====
Drive hunting methods were used to capture Orcas in the [[Puget Sound]] in the 1960s and 1970s. These hunts were led by aquarium owner and entrepreneur [[Edward "Ted" Griffin]] and his partner Don Goldsberry. After Edward purchased an Orca that was caught by accident by fishermen in [[Namu, British Columbia|Namu]], [[British Columbia]], in 1965, Edward and Don used drive hunting techniques in the Puget Sound area to capture Orcas for the entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;[[PBS]] - [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/whales/etc/summary.html Edward "Ted" Griffin - The Life and Adventures of a man who caught Killer Whales], article retrieved 19 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Others followed and despite the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972]] the practice continued until 1976 when the state of Washington ordered the release of a number of Orcas that were being held in [[Budd Inlet]] and subsequently banned the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Egan, The Good Rain: Across Time &amp; Terrain in the Pacific Northwest, page 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eddystone Lighthouse''' is on the dangerous [[Eddystone Rocks]], {{convert|9|smi|km}} south of [[Rame Head]], England, United Kingdom. While Rame Head is in [[Cornwall]], the rocks are in [[Devon]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Ordnance Survey]] mapping; the rocks form part of the unitary district of the City of Plymouth, in the [[ceremonial county]] of Devon&lt;/ref&gt; and composed of [[Precambrian]] [[gneiss]].&lt;ref name=osinfo&gt;{{cite web | title = Get A Map | url = http://getamap.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/getamap/frames.htm?mapAction=gaz&amp;gazName=g&amp;gazString=SX3830333632 | publisher = [[Ordnance Survey]] | accessdate =6 September 2006 }} View at 1:50000 scale&lt;/ref&gt;

The current structure is the fourth to be built on the site. The first and second were destroyed by storm and fire. The third, also known as [[Smeaton's Tower]], is the best known because of its influence on [[Lighthouse|lighthouse design]] and its importance in the development of [[concrete]] for building. Its upper portions have been re-erected in Plymouth as a monument.&lt;ref name=thinfo&gt;{{cite web |title=Eddystone history |url=http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/lighthouses/lighthouse_list/eddystone.html |publisher=[[Trinity House]] |accessdate=27 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108082624/http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/lighthouses/lighthouse_list/eddystone.html |archivedate=8 November 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first lighthouse, completed in 1699, was the world's first open ocean lighthouse although the [[Cordouan lighthouse]] preceded it as the first offshore lighthouse.&lt;ref name="Winstanley"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/340721/lighthouse/72148/The-beginning-of-the-modern-era|title=Lighthouse| publisher =Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The need for a light ==
The Eddystone Rocks are an extensive reef approximately 12 miles (19&amp;nbsp;km) SSW of [[Plymouth Sound]], one of the most important naval harbours of England, and midway between [[Lizard Point, Cornwall]] and [[Start Point, Devon|Start Point]]. They are submerged at high spring tides and were so feared by mariners entering the English Channel that they often hugged the coast of France to avoid the danger, which thus resulted not only in shipwrecks locally, but on the rocks of the north coast of France and the Channel Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Samuel|last=Smiles|title=The Lives of the Engineers|year=1861|volume=Vol 2|page=16|url=https://archive.org/stream/livesofengineers02smil#page/16/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the difficulty of gaining a foothold on the rocks particularly in the predominant swell it was a long time before anyone attempted to place any warning on them.

== Winstanley's lighthouse ==
[[File:Eddystone lighthouse00.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Winstanley's lighthouse, as modified in 1699]]
The first lighthouse on Eddystone Rocks was an octagonal wooden structure built by [[Henry Winstanley]]. The lighthouse was also the first recorded instance of an offshore lighthouse.&lt;ref name="Winstanley" /&gt; Construction started in 1696 and the light was lit on 14 November 1698. During construction, a French [[privateer]] took Winstanley prisoner and destroyed the work done so far on the foundations, causing [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] to order Winstanley's release with the words "France is at war with England, not with humanity".&lt;ref name="thinfo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mountedgcumbe.gov.uk/visit/exhibitions/a-story-in-100-objects/01-winstanleys-light/&lt;/ref&gt;

The lighthouse survived its first winter but was in need of repair, and was subsequently changed to a dodecagonal (12 sided) stone clad exterior on a timber framed construction with an octagonal top section as can be seen in the later drawings or paintings. This gives rise to the claims that there have been five lighthouses on Eddystone Rock. Winstanley's tower lasted until the [[Great Storm of 1703]] erased almost all trace on 27 November. Winstanley was on the lighthouse, completing additions to the structure. No trace was found of him, or of the other five men in the lighthouse.&lt;ref name=edthis&gt;{{cite web|title=Eddystone Lighthouse History |url=http://www.eddystoneeel.com/LIGHTHOUSE%20HISTORY.htm |publisher=Eddystone Tatler Ltd |accessdate=7 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502095435/http://www.eddystoneeel.com/LIGHTHOUSE%20HISTORY.htm |archivedate=2 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcgrs&gt;{{cite web|title=The Great Storm of 1703 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/1703_storm.shtml |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=7 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830015836/http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/1703_storm.shtml |archivedate=30 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of construction and five years' maintenance totalled £7,814 7s.6d, during which time dues totalling £4,721 19s.3d had been collected at one penny per ton from passing vessels.

He commissioned [[John Rudyard]] (or Rudyerd) to design the new lighthouse, built as a conical wooden structure around a core of brick and concrete. A temporary light was first shone from it in 1708&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Fred|last=Majdalany|title=The Red Rocks of Eddystone|location=London|publisher=Longmans|year=1959|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the work was completed in 1709. This proved more durable, surviving nearly fifty years.&lt;ref name="thinfo" /&gt;

On the night of 2 December 1755, the top of the lantern caught fire, probably through a spark from one of the candles used to illuminate the light. The three keepers threw water upwards from a bucket but were driven onto the rock and were rescued by boat as the tower burnt down. Keeper [[Henry Hall (lighthouse keeper)|Henry Hall]], who was 94 at the time, died from ingesting molten lead from the lantern roof.&lt;ref name="thinfo" /&gt; A report on this case was submitted to the [[Royal Society]] by physician Edward Spry,&lt;ref name=spry&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spry|first=Edward|author2=John Huxham|title=An Account of the Case of a Man Who Died of the Effects of the Fire at Eddy-Stone Light-House.

[[File:Smeaton's Lighthouse00.jpg|thumb|left|upright|&lt;center&gt;[[Smeaton's Lighthouse]]&lt;/center&gt;]] The third lighthouse marked a major step forward in the design of such structures.

Recommended by the [[Royal Society]], [[civil engineer]] [[John Smeaton]] modelled the shape on an [[oak tree]], built of [[granite]] blocks. He pioneered '[[hydraulic lime]]', a concrete that cured under water, and developed a technique of securing the granite blocks using [[dovetail joint]]s and [[marble]] [[dowel]]s. Construction started in 1756 at [[Millbay]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the light was first lit on 16 October 1759.&lt;ref name="thinfo" /&gt;

Smeaton's lighthouse was 59&amp;nbsp;feet (18&amp;nbsp;m) high and had a diameter at the base of 26&amp;nbsp;feet (8&amp;nbsp;m) and at the top of 17&amp;nbsp;feet (5&amp;nbsp;m).

In 1841 major renovations were made,&lt;ref&gt;Woolmer's Exeter and Plymouth Gazette, 15 May 1841&lt;/ref&gt; under the direction of engineer [[Henry Norris (engineer)|Henry Norris]] of Messrs. [[James Walker (engineer)|Walker]] &amp; [[Alfred Burges|Burges]], including complete repointing, replacement water tanks and filling of a large cavity in the rock close to the foundations. It remained in use until 1877 when erosion to the rocks under the lighthouse caused it to shake from side to side whenever large waves hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Minutes of proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers|chapter=Note on the Eddystone Lighthouse|author=Douglass, James Nicholas|location=London|publisher=Institution of Civil Engineers|year=1878|volume=vol. 53, part 3|pages=247–248|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cx4AAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smeaton's lighthouse was rebuilt on [[Plymouth Hoe]], in [[Plymouth]], as a memorial. [[William Douglass (engineer)|William Tregarthen Douglass]] supervised the dismantling and removal of Smeaton's Tower.  The re-erected tower on the Hoe is now a tourist attraction.

The foundations and stub of the tower remain, close to the new and more solid foundations of the current lighthouse&lt;ref name="thinfo" /&gt; – the foundations proved too strong to be dismantled so the Victorians left them where they stood.

An 1850 replica of Smeaton's lighthouse, [[Hoad Monument]], stands above the town of [[Ulverston]], [[Cumbria]] as a memorial to naval administrator [[Sir John Barrow]].

The current, fourth, [[lighthouse]] was designed by [[James Nicholas Douglass|James Douglass]], using [[Robert Stevenson (civil engineer)|Robert Stevenson's]] developments of Smeaton's techniques. By April 1879 the new site, on the South Rock  was being prepared during the 3½ hours between [[ebb tide|ebb]] and [[flood tide]]. The supply ship ''Hercules'' was based at [[Oreston]], now a suburb of [[Plymouth]], and the stone was prepared at the Oreston yard and supplied from the works of Messrs Shearer, Smith and Co of [[Wadebridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Commencement and Progress of the Eddystone|work=The Cornishman|issue=40|date=17 April 1879|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The New Eddystone Lighthouse|work=The Cornishman|issue=49|date=19 June 1879|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The light was lit in 1882 and is still in use. It was automated in 1982, the first [[Trinity House]] 'Rock' (or offshore) lighthouse to be converted. The tower has been changed by construction of a [[helipad]] above the lantern, to allow maintenance crews access.&lt;ref name=thinfo2&gt;{{cite web | title = Eddystone Lighthouse | url = http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/interactive/gallery/eddystone.html | publisher = Trinity House | accessdate =30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The helipad has a weight limit of 3600kg.

The tower is {{convert|49|m|ft}} high, and [[Light characteristic|its white light flashes twice every 10&amp;nbsp;seconds]]. The light is visible to {{convert|22|nmi|km}}, and is supplemented by a [[foghorn]] of 3 blasts every 62&amp;nbsp;seconds.&lt;ref name="thinfo" /&gt;

'''Fairfax Field''' was a wartime (WWII) facility of the United States Army Air Forces and later, the [[United States Air Force]]. 
The installation was north of [[Kansas City, Kansas]].  Used as a pre-war [[Naval Air Station]],{{r|MilOrder}} the [[United States Army Air Forces]] leased the municipal airfield and built an [[Air Force Plant]] and [[USAAF Modification Centers|modification center]] for [[North American B-25 Mitchell]] medium bomber production.  Military use of the site continued as late as 1957 by the Strategic Air Command's [[3903rd Radar Bomb Scoring Group]] for bombing practice.

The Fairfax [[USAAF Modification Centers|Modification Center]] was a dual hangar built May–October 1942 along the south taxiway for altering the new B-25s (a west extension and several outbuildings were added.){{r|Freeman}}  The [[76th AAF Technical Training Detachment]] activated on 4 February 1943 (designated 5 October) and administered a 6 week hydraulics course for AAF mechanics under the direction of the Aircraft Accessories Corporation. About 300 students were admitted before the school was closed in October as a duplicate of a [[Chanute Field]] course.  The [[81st AAF Technical Training Detachment]] activated 22 February 1943 and designated, effective 30 August, to supervise apprentice crew chiefs at the Modification Center. January AAF policy was for each mechanic selected as a crew chief to be assigned an aircraft as it left the factory, review its modifications at the center, and deploy with it to the field unit. B-25 modifications only took a week until the B-25G gunship modifications for [[Pacific War]] anti-shipping missions, which took 2–3 months.{{Citation needed|reason=What did the B-25G model have to do with Fairfax?

==WWII ferrying==
[[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)#Background|Air Transport Command]] moved the [[2d Ferrying Squadron]] of the 5th Ferrying Group from [[Dallas Love Field]] to Fairfax on April 15, 1943, and the squadron ferried out 157 B-25s during May&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/182/132.xml |title=Air Force History Index |publisher=Airforcehistory.org |accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of 1,881 deliveries in 1943 by the Ground Ferrying Squadron all but 129 were B-25s, but at the end of that year Fairfax pilots began ferrying [[Martin B-26 Marauder]]s from the [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]] modification center and [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]]s from a [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] facility.  From May-Sep 1944 a detachment of [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]] was at Fairfax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sP3aAnaM38YC&amp;pg=PA116 |title=Kansas Forts and Bases: Sentinels on the Prairie - Debra Goodrich Bisel, Michelle M.

On 22 September 1944 the 33d Ferrying Group began daily scheduled Military Air Transport (MAT) flights with military cargo/passengers to [[Minneapolis]] and [[Omaha]] (2 more daily flights were later added.)  In October 1944, the modification center became an adjunct{{Clarify|reason=What did the modification center do after it stopped modifications and was an adjunct?|date=July 2013}} to the final assembly line.  On 9 November 1944 the 33d Group furnished plane and crew to fly Senator [[Harry S.

During the Fairfax transition to P-80 production, the 33d Ferrying Group was discontinued.{{When|date=July 2013}}

==WWII air freight==
On 2 March 1945, Military Air Transport moved an air freight terminal to Fairfax from [[Kansas City, Missouri]], and had 362 personnel in June, the largest operating location in the division. For ferrying, Fairfax became an operating location of [[Rosecrans Army Airfield]] on 15 April 1945 with its pilots traveling to Fairfax for sorties.  In 1945, 1,044 military transports used the field in July (e.g., President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] for visits to [[Independence, Missouri]]).  Plans for B-29 and F-80 aircraft production at Fairfax were never implemented, and B-25J production was terminated on August 15, 1945, after a total of 2,290 B-25Ds (152 Navy PBJ-1D variants) and 4,318 B-25Js had been built by the plant.  The federal [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] set up a depot in the Fairfax district to liquidate war surplus not sent to depots or elsewhere for government use (reusable materials like aluminum and steel were reclaimed.) Seventy-two incomplete but flyable B-25Js were sold to the public.  A USAAF [[C-47]] crashed on September 15, 1945 on take off into the north bank of the Missouri River's curve, killing all 24 aboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19450915-1 |title=ASN Aircraft accident Douglas C-47B-45-DK (DC-3) 45-1011 Kansas City-Fairfax Field, KS (KCK) |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |date=1945-09-15 |accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/airport/airport.php?id=KCK |title=Kansas City-Fairfax Field, KS profile - Aviation Safety Network |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |date=2013-11-05 |accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Air Transport Command operating location at Fairfax was discontinued by 6 December 1945 (9 C-47s and 80 pilots/co-pilots transferred west to [[Topeka Army Airfield]] which had been chosen for a central MAT flight facility by November 1945.)

The '''Grand Theatre''' was a theatre in the [[Yiddish Theatre District]] in Manhattan in [[New York City]] built for Yiddish productions, the first of its kind.&lt;ref name="source10"&gt;Rosenfeld, Lulla Adler. [https://books.google.com/books?ei=2_izTpTOH-Ha0QHm19mqBA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=W1llAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Grand+Theatre%22+yiddish&amp;q=%22Grand+Theatre%22#search_anchor The Yiddish theatre and Jacob P. Adler], p. 299 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; The theater was built in 1904 by Jacob Pavlovitch Adler, a famous Russian-born Jewish actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nycago.org/Organs/NYC/html/GrandTheatre.html|title=Grand Theatre - New York City|website=www.nycago.org|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

On March 12, 1902, [[Sophia Karp]], with [[Jacob Fischel]] and playwright [[Joseph Lateiner]], founded the Grand Theatre in New York City. The city's first theatre built specifically for [[Yiddish]] productions,&lt;ref name=moses&gt;Moses Rischin, ''The promised city: New York's Jews, 1870–1914''&lt;/ref&gt; the Grand was typical of Yiddish theatres of the time by being largely artist-managed. Besides Karp and Lateiner, the directors included leading man [[Moishe Finkel|Morris Finkel]], comedian [[Bernard Bernstein]], L. S. Gottlieb, and composer [[Louis Friedsell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/02/08/117985234.pdf | date=February 8, 1903 | title=Actors Own New Theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened on February 5, 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/02/01/101970462.pdf | date=February 1, 1903 | title=A New Jewish Theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/02/06/101971732.pdf | date=February 6, 1903 | title=Grand Theatre Opened}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Two events in 1904 symbolized the decline of the serious stage. Jacob Gordin failed as the director of his own theater and Jacob Adler, the leading exponent of Gordin's dramas, opened the Grand Theater – the first structure built specifically for the Yiddish stage. In 1912 [[Boris Thomashefsky|T[h]omashefsky]]'s new [[National Theater (Manhattan)|National Theater]] on [[Houston Street]] even surpassed the Grand in the magnificence of its appointments. The National compared favorably with [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] palaces and offered similar enjoyments subject to the same commercial will-o'-the-wisp.&lt;ref name=moses /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Italian performances also were done at the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Aleandri, Emelise. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3qx0PH1jwG4C&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Italian-American Immigrant Theatre of New York City''], p. 45 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

== The history of the project ==
Formation of the scientific objectives of the project "Ionosat - Micro" was for a long time, and conceptual provisions were first formulated in the 1990s, during the development of unrealized mission "Warning." Then, after tragic Spitakskii [[earthquake]] (1988), the political leadership of the USSR initiated the development of new, more effective methods of earthquake prediction, based, in particular, on the use of non-traditional for Seismology approaches such as observation of ionospheric harbingers of earthquakes etc. Thus arose the idea of mission "Warning", which, if not collapse of the USSR (1991), could be the most ambitious satellite project in the history of world studies of the ionosphere. The "Ionosat-Micro" Mission on the satellite "Mikrosat-M" embodies the ideas of the mission "Warning" on modern scientific and technological basis.&lt;ref name="test1"&gt;(ukr) Лізунов Г.В.

'''''Krishna Gopeshvara''''' is the first book in a proposed Krishna Trilogy by [[Sanjay Dixit]]. The book was soft launched by unveiling the cover of the book by [[Sanjay Dixit]] with the publishers [[Bloomsbury Publishing]] on 18 November 2017 in the second edition of [[The Jaipur Dialogues]] event.&lt;ref&gt;Krishna Gopeshvara to be launched http://localmla.com/trendingnews/jaipur-dialogues-start-in-jaipur-today/&lt;/ref&gt; The book has now been published on 29th May 2018. The sub-title of the book was initially publicised as "Rationalist of Vrishnis", but has now been changed to "The Truth of Vrishnis". According to Dixit, the book aims to explore Krishna's life events from a rational perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Krishna Gopeshvara launch to be part of [[The Jaipur Dialogues]] 2017 https://swarajyamag.com/ideas/jaipur-dialogues-2017-setting-the-tone-for-a-new-indian-discourse&lt;/ref&gt;

''Krishna Gopeshvara'' follows the trend of historical fictions made popular by [[Amish Tripathi]] with his [[Shiva Trilogy]] and [[Ram Chandra Series]]. It is an action packed thriller set in the [[Mahabharata]] era.

According to Dixit, the book is an attempt to create a logical explanation around the engaging persona of arguably the most complex of characters in the Hindu pantheon. During the launch of the book, he stated that there is much truth in the saying that 'Listen to Krishna, but follow Rama'. He said in the soft launch that Rama was a linear personality who set examples of his own conduct for others to follow, whereas Krishna was in a higher state of evolution as Yogeshvara whose actions cannot be easily understood or followed by lay people, but his teachings are in an exalted state which can be followed by everyone from Yogi to Gopi.

According to [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], "'Krishna Gopeshvara' is first part of a trilogy on Lord Krishna. It covers the life events of Lord Krishna from roughly Kansa's capture of the Mathura throne, to Kansa's killing by Krishna. It is written in the genre of historical fiction. Krishna and Kansa are not presented as some extra-terrestrial beings, but as human beings pursuing their narratives according to their understanding of the world around them. The script is presented
as a clash of two narratives - one the dharmic narrative symbolized by Krishna, and the other being a totalitarian narrative symbolized by Kansa. Radha comes in as an inspiration to the young Krishna.

The story is presented as a rational explanation of events around Krishna's early life. Things that look impossible to an ordinary person have been reconfigured as plausible events. The only assumption that has been made is that Krishna was a highly gifted young man.

Fictional characters have been added to enhance the totalitarian narrative espoused by Kansa. However, the script never leaves the template of history and geography of Aryavarta in the Mahabharata times. Care has been taken that the philosophy associated with Sanatana Dharma comes out in small conversations."

In an interview given to [[Swarajya (magazine)]], Dixit refuted the charge that by attacking violent monotheism of Kutila Dharma, he was indirectly hinting at something&lt;ref&gt;https://swarajyamag.com/culture/new-book-revisits-the-life-of-krishna-not-as-god-but-as-a-gifted-human-being&lt;/ref&gt;. He stated in the interview that tendency for using violence to deify is as old as [[Hiranyakashipu]] in the Indian tradition, so it is wrong to say that violent monotheism did not exist in the ancient era. He made a distinction between monism and monotheism and between monotheism and violent monotheism.

==Controversy==

There is a minor controversy over the way the Swastika is depicted on the cover, being anti-clockwise instead of the usual auspicious clockwise depiction. When asked, Dixit refused to reveal the reason before the book hits the market. Rather enigmatically, he said that one would have to read the book to know the reason. He said that at this point, he would not like to unravel the mystery behind the reverse Swastika. 

However, in a pre-order launch carnival held in Jaipur on 13 April 2018, Dixit rebutted the criticism by saying that Vilom Swastika or Reverse Swastika was very much part of the Indian tradition. A video of the discussion during the event was released by Dixit for clarifying some of the mysteries surrounding the book.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PXBEJnTLuM&amp;t=144s&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch and availability==

The book was launched on 3rd June 2018 by the [[Indian Premier League]] superstar [[Rishabh Pant]] and the author [[Sanjay Dixit]][[File:Krishna Gopeshvara New 7D.jpg|thumb|Krishna Gopeshvara Launch]]
The book is now readily available in stock at all major bookstores and online marketplaces like [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.in/Krishna-Gopeshvara-Truth-Vrishnis-Trilogy/dp/9387457710/ref=sr_1_69?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1528265511&amp;sr=1-69&amp;refinements=p_n_publication_date%3A2684819031&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Flipkart]] and [[Snapdeal]]. The book is priced at INR 399.

The book is also available at all major e-commerce platforms like [[Flipkart]] and [[Snapdeal]].

Dixit had revealed that the Book contains 6 Parts and 51 Chapters. The foreword has been written by [[David Frawley]].

==Motto==

The Book has an interesting Sanskrit shloka below the sub-title which is a straight take on the last shloka of the [[Bhagwadgita]]: 

'यत्र गोपेश्वर: कृष्णो यत्र राधा योगिनी।
 
तत्र मुक्तिरानंदम् ध्रुवाप्रीतिर्मतिर्मम।।'

'yatra gopeshvarah krishṇo yatra rādhā yogini/

tatra muktirānaṅdam dhruvāpritirmatirmama'

Translation: Where there is Krishna, the lord of the cowherds, and where there is Radha the practitioner of yoga; there in my opinion you will get liberation, bliss, and a firm feeling of love.



A video has been released by [[The Jaipur Dialogues]] that showcases an in-depth discussion on the book featuring [[David Frawley]], Sandeep Balakrishna and [[Sanjay Dixit]]; with questions asked by [[Sonal Mansingh]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_GCCIsfq-c&amp;t=904s&lt;/ref&gt;

The next two books in the Krishna Trilogy are going to be ''Krishna Yogeshvara'' and ''Krishna Gyaneshvara''.

==Story Scheme==

The 51 Chapters of the book begin with a Chapter titled 'Asti and Prapti' in which the two queens of Kaṃsa are shown fleeing Mathura to the safety of the kingdom of their father, Jarasandha. Once they reach their father's place, the story of Krishna is narrated by the patron sage of Magadha. The book uses two streams of narration in third person. Kaṃsa is tutored by an evil saint called Kuṭil Muni into a totalitarian doctrine called Kuṭil Dharma that was alien to Bharatavarsha. 

The Chapters are divided into six parts. The book ends with the young Krishna preparing to leave for his higher education to the Ashram of his future Guru, Sandipani. The next part of the Trilogy, ''Krishna Yogeshvara'' would presumably have this ending dovetailed at some point.

==Themes of various Parts==

The first Part deals with the flight of Mathura queens, wives of Kaṃsa to their paternal home in Magadha and start of the story of Kaṃsa's accession to the throne.

The second Part deals with the formal introduction of Kuṭil Muni into the story, and his travel to Āryāvarta for conquest and establishment of his narrative.

The third part deals with Krishna's early childhood.

The fourth Part deals with Kaṃsa coming increasingly under the influence of the evil narrative of his newfound mentor, Kuṭil Muni.

The fifth Part deals with Krishna's early adolescence and Kaṃsa's anxiety, leading to Kaṃsa's slaying by Krishna.

The sixth Part deals with the aftermath of Kaṃsa's death. The book ends with Uddhava preparing to go to Vrindavana to console the Gopis before Krishna leaves Mathura for his higher education to Sandipani Ashrama

==Reviews==

[[Swarajya magazine]] carried the first review of the book&lt;ref&gt;https://swarajyamag.com/ideas/krishna-gopeshvara-the-avatar-versus-the-prophet&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[Aravindan Neelakandan]]. Aravindan sees the book as an important literary attempt to look at the life of Sri Krishna as told in Bhagavata, and which reflects the present problems faced by the Hindus. Writing as 'The Avatar Versus the Prophet', Aravindan says that "The book is an important literary attempt to look at the life of Sri Krishna as told in Bhagavata from the perspective of the clash of religions as is happening in India right now. So Kamsa, the maternal uncle of Krishna, is transformed into a veritable Constantine running an inquisition for Kutil Muni who in turn is an expansionist predatory cultist. His religion is based on intolerant premises – no image worship, destruction of temples, apocalypse, last day, final judgment, eternal hell - not for bad behaviour but for disbelief in the cult and so on. He spreads his cult through the monarch Kamsa. ‘One God, One Book, One King’ is surely a great way to control people, and every dictator of pre-monotheist society would love to have such a weapon handed over to him. Kamsa is no exception and there is one danger to this great plan to make entire ‘Aryavarta’ fall into submission unto the one god (and hence one emperor and his dynasty). A lovable dark hued cowherd among a pastoral community poses a threat. The novel in the form of a narration goes through the different deeds of Krishna – removing the supernatural elements and substituting them with natural explanations".

He goes to on to say that "This first literary attempt by the author is in a way looking at the present existential problems faced by Hindus through the ancient history of Krishna. One example: the way Kutil Muni tries to use the Arya-Naga divide to convert the Nagas shows how the author sees through the Bhagavata – the present day challenge the dharmic society faces – particularly when evangelising religions use the social fault lines to further their agenda. The Nagas when at last faced with the rapine predatory Kutil dharma, realise that they have more in common with the so-called Arya dharma than with the expansionist monocultural Kutil dharma. The more than 300 pages novel is filled with such parallels".

Aravindan concludes by saying that "what makes this interpretation important is the fact that the dharmic society is facing relentless attacks from the Kutil-dharma like cult-like religions. So this interpretation of Krishna, which has been implicit or involuted in the Bhagavata itself, has been expanded and presented in a modern literary form by Sanjay Dixit in an interesting way. Krishna in Bhagavata is all these and much more. He is of infinite possibilities and he can manifest through infinite ways to provide solutions to the crises that the dharmic society faces".

{{nihongo|'''Labor Thanksgiving Day'''|勤労感謝の日|Kinrō Kansha no Hi}} is a national [[Holidays of Japan|holiday]] in [[Japan]] celebrated on November 23 of each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Shinto|author=Stuart D. B. Picken|p=217|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-810-87372-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law establishing the holiday cites it as an occasion to commemorate [[Manual labor|labor]] and production and give one another thanks.

Events are held throughout Japan, one such being the [[Nagano (city)|Nagano]] Labor Festival. The event encourages thinking about the [[Natural environment|environment]], [[peace]] and [[human rights]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Early-grade elementary students often create drawings for the holiday and give them as gifts to local [[kōban]]s (neighborhood [[police station]]s).

==History==
Labor Thanksgiving Day is the modern name for an ancient [[harvest festival]] known as {{nihongo|''[[Niiname-sai]]''|新嘗祭|extra=also read as ''Shinjō-sai''}}, celebrating the harvest of the [[Five Cereals (China)|Five Cereals]] ([[rice]], [[barley]]/[[wheat]], [[foxtail millet]], [[Echinochloa esculenta|barnyard millet]], [[proso millet]], and [[bean]]s).{{clarify|reason=Need an explanation for why are there more than five listed|date=November 2018}} The classical chronicle the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' mentions a harvest ritual having taken place during the reign of the legendary [[Emperor Jimmu]] (660–585 BC), as well as more formalized harvest celebrations during the reign of [[Emperor Seinei]] (480–484 AD). Modern scholars can date the basic forms of ''niiname-sai'' to the time of [[Emperor Tenmu]] (667–686 AD).&lt;ref name="Ohnuki-Tierney1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ohnuki-Tierney|first=Emiko|title=Rice as self: Japanese identities through time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OeKGjjhNC8EC&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=November 22, 2011|date=November 14, 1994|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-02110-2|pages=46–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, it celebrated the year's hard work; during the ''Niiname-sai'' ceremony, the [[Emperors of Japan|Emperor]] would dedicate the year's harvest to [[kami]] ([[spirit]]s), and taste the rice for the first time.

The modern holiday was established after [[World War II]] in 1948 as a day to mark some of the changes of the postwar [[Constitution of Japan]], including fundamental human rights and the expansion of workers rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.axiommagazine.jp/2011/11/22/labor-thanksgiving-day-%E5%8B%A4%E5%8A%B4%E6%84%9F%E8%AC%9D%E3%81%AE%E6%97%A5/|title=Labor Thanksgiving Day – 勤労感謝の日|last=Miller|first=Adam|date=November 22, 2011|work=Axiom Magazine|accessdate=November 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, ''Niiname-sai'' is still held privately by the [[Imperial House of Japan]] on the same day as Labor Thanksgiving Day, which has become a public national holiday.&lt;ref name="Morrill2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morrill|first=Ann|title=Thanksgiving and Other Harvest Festivals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Xde_E7-r50C&amp;pg=PA51|accessdate=November 22, 2011|date=August 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-60413-096-6|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[International Workers' Day|May 1]] is also celebrated as Labor Day by many [[trade union]]s in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hijirida|first1=Kyoko|last2=Yoshikawa|first2=Muneo|title=Japanese language and culture for business and travel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ORNzbaPIdVUC&amp;pg=PA253|accessdate=November 22, 2011|year=1987|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1017-7|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; which hold large rallies and marches in [[Tokyo]], [[Osaka]] and [[Nagoya]].

This '''[[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]]''' (Worldcon) list includes prior and scheduled Worldcons.  The data is maintained by the ''Long List Committee'', a [[World Science Fiction Society]] sub-committee.

Notes:
* '''Name''' – a convention is normally listed by the least confusing version of its name. This is usually the name preferred by the convention, but [[fannish]] tradition is followed in retroactively numbering the first Worldcon in a series 1 (or I or One).
* '''Guests of honor''' – custom in designating guests of honor has varied greatly, with some conventions giving specific titles (Fan, Pro, Australia, U.S., Artist, etc.) and some simply call them all guests of honor. Specific labels have been used where they existed, as have regional variants in spelling.
* '''Size''' – where available, this column records two numbers: how many paying members attended the Worldcon and how many total members there were (in parentheses). The available data is very incomplete and imprecise and many of these numbers are probably substantially in error.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54772">A [[natural disaster]] is a sudden event that causes widespread destruction, lots of collateral damage or loss of life, brought about by forces other than the acts of human beings. A natural disaster might be caused by earthquakes, flooding, volcanic eruption, landslide, hurricanes etc. In order to be classified as a disaster, it will have profound environmental effect and/or human loss and frequently incurs financial loss.

==Ten deadliest natural disasters==

''Notes: The list does not include several volcanic eruptions with uncertain death tolls resulting from collateral effects (crop failures, etc.), though these may have numbered in the millions; see [[List of volcanic eruptions by death toll]].&lt;br&gt;The list does not include the man-made [[1938 Yellow River flood]], caused entirely by a deliberate man-made act (an act of war, destroying dikes).&lt;br&gt;An alternative listing is given by Peter Hough in his 2008 book ''Global Security''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Hough|title=Understanding Global Security|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lMRneJvYvjUC&amp;pg=PA192|series=table 8.1|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-42141-6|page=192|chapter=Chapter 8|quote=The ten worst natural disasters in history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, the '''Lord of Misrule'''&amp;nbsp;– known in Scotland as the '''Abbot of Unreason''' and in France as the ''Prince des Sots''&amp;nbsp;– was an officer [[sortition|appointed by lot]] during [[Christmastide]] to preside over the [[Feast of Fools]]. The Lord of Misrule was generally a peasant or [[sub-deacon]] appointed to be in charge of Christmas revelries, which often included drunkenness and wild partying.

The Church held a similar festival involving a [[boy bishop]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mv7qBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT13&amp;dq=lord+of+misrule+history&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIqaH_n5jRAhUDwYMKHQihBLEQ6AEISjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=lord%20of%20misrule%20history&amp;f=false|title=History of Christmases Past: History Events|last=Love|first=Suzi|date=20 December 2013|publisher=Suzi Love|isbn=9780992345686|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This custom was abolished by [[Henry VIII]] in 1541, restored by the Catholic [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]] and again abolished by Protestant [[Elizabeth I]], though here and there it lingered on for some time longer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanneboleynfiles.com/resources/tudor-life/tudor-christmas Tudor Christmas, The Anne Boleyn Files]&lt;/ref&gt; On the Continent it was suppressed by the [[Council of Florence|Council of Basle]] in 1431, but was revived in some places from time to time, even as late as the eighteenth century. In the [[Tudor period]], the Lord of Misrule (sometimes called the Abbot of Misrule or the King of Misrule)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; is mentioned a number of times by contemporary documents referring to revels both at court and among the ordinary people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=John|first=Stow|title=A Survey of London (1603)|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=60025|work=British History Online|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hadfield|first=Miles &amp; John|title=The Twelve Days of Christmas|year=1961|publisher=Cassell|location=London|pages=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Higginbotham|first=Susan|title=The Lord of Misrule Comes to Court: 1551/52|url=http://www.susanhigginbotham.com/blog/posts/the-lord-of-misrule-comes-to-court-155152/|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tile derby.jpg|thumb|In the spirit of misrule, identified by the grinning masks in the corners, medieval floor tiles from the [[Derby Black Friary]] show a triumphant hunting hare mounted on a dog.]]  
While mostly known as a British holiday custom, some folklorists, such as [[James Frazer]] and [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] (who is said to have plagiarized the novel idea from Frazer) have claimed that the appointment of a Lord of Misrule comes from a similar custom practiced during the Roman celebration of [[Saturnalia]].&lt;ref name="Miles2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bagshaw2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bagshaw|first=Hilary B.P.|title=Religion in the Thought of Mikhail Bakhtin|date=8 April 2016|publisher=Routledge|language=English|isbn=9781317067450|page=95|quote=This appears to be an unacknowledged borrowing from Frazer, which would be hard to explain in any other way than direct or indirect transmission of Frazer's ideas. Material on Saturnalia alone might well come from a different source, but the association of Saturnalia and the medieval carnival is strongly suggestive of affiliation to Frazer. Bakhtin picks up, and reinforces, the idea taken from Saturnalia, that the festive period is a time when political order is overturned, slavery was temporarily abolished and hierarchies may have been inverted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient [[Rome]], from 17 to 23 December (in the [[Julian Calendar]]), a man chosen to be a mock king was appointed for the feast of Saturnalia, in the guise of the Roman deity [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]];&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; at the end of the festival, the man was sacrificed.&lt;ref name="Miles2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miles|first=Clement A.|title=Christmas in Ritual and Tradition|date=25 November 2016|publisher=Xist Publishing|language=English |isbn=9781681955988|page=108|quote=A striking feature of the ''Saturnalia'' was the choosing by lot of a mock king, to preside over the revels. ... This king may have been originally the representative of the god Saturn himself. In the days of the classical writers he is a mere "Lord of Misrule", but Dr. Frazer has propounded the very interesting theory that this time of privilege and gaiety was once the prelude to a grim sacrifice in which he had to die in the character of the god, giving his life for the world. Dr. Frazer's theory, dependent for its evidence upon the narrative of the martyrdom of a fourth-century saint, Dasius by name, has been keenly criticized by Dr. Warde Fowler. ... Still, in whatever way the king of the ''Saturnalia'' may be explained, it is interesting to note his existence and compare him with the merry monarchs whom we shall meet at Christmas and Twelfth Night.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis has been heavily criticized by [[William Warde Fowler]] and as such, the Christmas custom of the Lord of Misrule during the Christian era and the Saturnalian custom of antiquity may have completely separate origins;&lt;ref name="Miles2016"/&gt; the two separate customs, however, can be compared and contrasted.&lt;ref name="Miles2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeffrey2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeffrey|first=Yvonne|title=The Everything Family Christmas Book|date=27 September 2008|publisher=Everything Books|language=English|isbn=9781605507835|page=46|quote=The Lord of Misrule was ... appointed by the king and nobility to reign over the twelve days of Christmas. ... Much of the custom surrounding the Lord of Misrule had parallels with the Roman Saturnalia, during which masters and slaves changed places, with general rowdiness abounding.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January, AD 400, the bishop [[Asterius of Amasea]]&lt;ref name=AA/&gt; in Pontus ([[Amasya Province|Amasya, Turkey]]) preached a sermon against the Feast of [[Calends]] ("this foolish and harmful delight")&lt;ref name=AS/&gt; that describes the role of the mock king in [[Late Antiquity]]. The New Year's feast included children arriving at each doorstep, exchanging their gifts for reward:&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AS"&gt;
  "On the Festival of the Calends", Asterius, AD 400.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This festival teaches even the little children, artless and simple, to be greedy, and accustoms them to go from house to house and to offer novel gifts, fruits covered with silver tinsel. For these they receive, in return, gifts double their value, and thus the tender minds of the young begin to be impressed with that which is commercial and sordid.
:::::: —Asterius, in ''"Oratio 4: Adversus Kalendarum Festum"'' &lt;ref name=AS/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It contrasted with the Christian celebration held, not by chance, on the adjoining day:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We celebrate the birth of Christ, since at this time God manifested himself in the flesh. We celebrate the Feast of Lights (Epiphany), since by the forgiveness of our sins we are led forth from the dark prison of our former life into a life of light and {{nowrap|uprightness. --Asterius, ''"Oratio 4"''}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Significantly, for Asterius the Christian feast was explicitly an entry from darkness into light, and although no conscious solar nature could have been expressed, it is certainly the renewed light at midwinter that was celebrated among Roman pagans, officially from the time of [[Aurelian]], as the [[Sol Invictus|"festival of the birth of the Unconquered Sun"]]. Meanwhile, throughout the city of Amasea, although entry into the temples and holy places had been forbidden by the decree of [[Theodosius I]] (391), the festival of gift-giving when "all is noise and tumult" in "a rejoicing over the new year" with a kiss and the gift of a coin, went on all around, to the intense disgust and scorn of the bishop:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is misnamed a feast, being full of annoyance; since going out-of-doors is burdensome, and staying within doors is not undisturbed. For the common vagrants and the jugglers of the stage, dividing themselves into squads and hordes, hang about every house. The gates of public officials they besiege with especial persistence, actually shouting and clapping their hands until he that is beleaguered within, exhausted, throws out to them whatever money he has and even what is not his own. And these mendicants going from door to door follow one after another, and, until late in the evening, there is no relief from this nuisance. For crowd succeeds crowd, and shout, shout, and loss, {{nowrap|loss. —Asterius, ''"Oratio 4"'' &lt;ref name=AS/&gt;}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Honest farmers coming into the city were likely to be jeered at, spanked&lt;ref&gt;"Flogged" is the bishop's unlikely remark.&lt;/ref&gt; and robbed. Worse, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Even our most excellent and guileless prophets, the unmistakable  representatives of God, who when unhindered in their work are our faithful ministers, are treated with insolence." For the soldiers, they spend all their wages in riot and loose women, see plays perhaps, "for they learn vulgarity and the practices of actors". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Their military discipline is relaxed and slackened. They make sport of the laws and the government of which they have been appointed guardians. For they ridicule and insult the august government. They mount a chariot as though upon a stage; they appoint pretended lictors and publicly act like buffoons. This is the nobler part of their ribaldry. But their other doings, how can one mention them? Does not the champion, the lion-hearted man, the man who when armed is the admiration of his friends and the terror of his foes, loose his tunic to his ankles, twine a girdle about his breast, use a woman's sandal, put a roll of hair on his head in feminine fashion, and ply the distaff full of wool, and with that right hand which once bore the trophy, draw out the thread, and changing the tone of his voice utter his words in the sharper feminine treble? &lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, according to the anthropologist [[James Frazer]], there was a darker side to the Saturnalia festival. In [[Durostorum]] on the [[Danube]] (modern [[Silistra]]), Roman soldiers would choose a man from among them to be the Lord of Misrule for thirty days. At the end of that thirty days, his throat was cut on the altar of Saturn. Similar origins of the British Lord of Misrule, as a sacrificial king (a ''temporary king'', as Frazer puts it) who was later put to death for the benefit of all, have also been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, The New Golden Bough, Ed. Theodor H. Gaster, part 7 "Between Old and New:  Periods of License," New York: Criterion Books, 1959; rpt. New York:  New American Library, 1964. pp.&amp;nbsp;643–44; 645-50&lt;/ref&gt;

References to Frazer's view of this ancient sacrifice were made in the 1973 film ''[[The Wicker Man (1973 film)|The Wicker Man]]''.

While the later Roman custom of a Lord of Misrule as a master of revels, a figure of fun and no more than that, is most familiar, there does seem to be some indication of an earlier and more unpleasant aspect to this figure. Frazer recounts:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are justified in assuming that in an earlier and more barbarous age it was the universal practice in ancient Italy, wherever the worship of Saturn prevailed, to choose a man who played the part and enjoyed all the traditionary privileges of Saturn for a season, and then died, whether by his own or another's hand, whether by the knife or the fire or on the gallows-tree, in the character of the good god who gave his life for the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/196/pages/page586.html Sir James George Frazer, ''The Golden Bough'', 1922, p.586]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Tudor England ===
In the Tudor period, John Stow in his ''Survey of London'', published in 1603, gives a description of the Lord of Misrule:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]n the feaste of Christmas, there was in the kinges house, wheresoeuer hee was lodged, a Lord of Misrule, or Maister of merry disports, and the like had yee in the house of euery noble man, of honor, or good worshippe, were he spirituall or temporall. Amongst the which the Mayor of London, and eyther of the shiriffes had their seuerall Lordes of Misrule, euer contending without quarrell or offence, who should make the rarest pastimes to delight the Beholders. These Lordes beginning their rule on Alhollon Eue [Halloween], continued the same till the morrow after the Feast of the Purification, commonlie called Candlemas day: In all which space there were fine and subtle disguisinges, Maskes and Mummeries, with playing at Cardes for Counters, Nayles and pointes in euery house, more for pastimes then for gaine.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Lord of Misrule is also referred to by Philip Stubbes in his ''Anatomie of Abuses'' (1585) where he states that "the wilde heades of the parishe conventynge together, chuse them a grand Capitaine (of mischeefe) whom they ennobel with the title Lorde of Misrule".  He then gives a description of the way they dress colourfully, tie bells onto their legs and "go to the churche (though the minister be at praier or preachyng) dauncying and swingyng their handercheefes".

== Decline of the custom in Britain ==
[[File:Inside St Johns East Dulwich.jpg|thumb|The [[Oxford Movement]] and writings by authors such as [[Charles Dickens]] brought the religious and family oriented aspects of [[Christmastide]] to the forefront of the celebration, cementing popular traditions that are maintained to this day&lt;ref name="Rowel1993"/&gt;]]
With the rise of the [[Puritan]] party in the 17th century [[Church of England]], the custom of the Lord of Misrule was outlawed as it was deemed "disruptive"; even after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], the custom remained banned and soon became forgotten.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeffrey|first=Yvonne|title=The Everything Family Christmas Book|date=17 September 2008|publisher=Everything Books|language=English|isbn=9781605507835|pages=46–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 19th century, the [[Oxford Movement]] in the [[Anglican Church]] ushered in "the development of richer and more symbolic forms of worship, the building of neo-Gothic churches, and the revival and increasing centrality of the keeping of Christmas itself as a Christian festival" as well as "special charities for the poor" in addition to "special services and musical events".&lt;ref name="Rowel1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowell|first=Geoffrey|date=December 1993|journal=[[History Today]]|volume=43|issue=12|quote=There is no doubt that A Christmas Carol is first and foremost a story concerned with the Christian gospel of liberation by the grace of God, and with incarnational religion which refuses to drive a wedge between the world of spirit and the world of matter. Both the Christmas dinners and the Christmas dinner-carriers are blessed; the cornucopia of Christmas food and feasting reflects both the goodness of creation and the joy of heaven. It is a significant sign of a shift in theological emphasis in the nineteenth century from a stress on the Atonement to a stress on the Incarnation, a stress which found outward and visible form in the sacramentalism of the Oxford Movement, the development of richer and more symbolic forms of worship, the building of neo-Gothic churches, and the revival and increasing centrality of the keeping of Christmas itself as a Christian festival. ... In the course of the century, under the influence of the Oxford Movement’s concern for the better observance of Christian festivals, Christmas became more and more prominent. By the later part of the century cathedrals provided special services and musical events, and might have revived ancient special charities for the poor – though we must not forget the problems for large: parish-church cathedrals like Manchester, which on one Christmas Day had no less than eighty couples coming to be married (the signing of the registers lasted until four in the afternoon). The popularity of Dickens' A Christmas Carol played a significant part in the changing consciousness of Christmas and the way in which it was celebrated. The popularity of his public readings of the story is an indication of how much it resonated with the contemporary mood, and contributed to the increasing place of the Christmas celebration in both secular and religious ways that was firmly established by the end of the nineteenth century.|accessdate=28 December 2016|language=English|url=http://www.historytoday.com/geoffrey-rowell/dickens-and-construction-christmas|title=Dickens and the Construction of Christmas}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Dickens]] and other writers helped in this revival of the holiday by "changing consciousness of Christmas and the way in which it was celebrated" as they emphasized family, religion, gift-giving, and social reconciliation as opposed to the historic revelry common in some places.&lt;ref name="Rowel1993"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8991">'''Machiavellianism in the workplace''' is the employment of cunning and duplicitous behavior in a business setting. The term ''[[Machiavellianism]]'' is from the book ''[[The Prince]]'' by [[Machiavelli]] which lays out advice to rulers how to govern his or her subjects. Machiavellianism has been studied extensively over the past 40 years as a personality characteristic that shares features with [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] [[leadership]] tactics. It has in recent times been adapted and applied to the context of the workplace and organizations by many writers and academics. The Machiavellian typically manipulates on occasions where it is advantageous to achieve the required objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2001-09-01|title=American presidential Machiavellianism: Implications for charismatic leadership and rated performance|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984301000820|journal=The Leadership Quarterly|language=en|volume=12|issue=3|pages=339–363|doi=10.1016/S1048-9843(01)00082-0|issn=1048-9843|last1=Deluga|first1=Ronald J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oliver James (psychologist)|Oliver James]] identifies Machiavellianism as one of the [[dark triad]]ic personality traits in the workplace, the others being [[narcissism]] and [[psychopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;James O Office Politics: How to Thrive in a World of Lying, Backstabbing and Dirty Tricks (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

A new model of Machiavellianism based in organizational settings consists of three factors:&lt;ref name="Kessler"&gt;Kessler, SR; Bandeiii, AC; Spector, PE; Borman, WC; Nelson, CE; and Penney, LM 2010.

The presence of Machiavellianism in an organisation has been positively correlated with [[counterproductive workplace behaviour]] and [[workplace deviance]].&lt;ref name=Kessler/&gt;

==Job interviews==
{{Main|Job interviews}}
Individuals who are high in Machiavellianism may be more willing and more skilled at lying and less likely to give honest answers during interviews.&lt;ref&gt;Fletch, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Levashina &amp; Campion, 2006"&gt;Levashina, J., &amp; Campion, M.

In one study, which examined the how much applicants allowed the interviewers to direct the topics covered during the interview, women high in  Machiavellianism tended to allow interviewers more freedom to direct the content of the interview. Men high in Machiavellianism gave interviewers the least amount of freedom in directing the content of the interview.&lt;ref name = "Weinstein, 1968"&gt;Weinstein, E. A., Beckhouse, L.

==Workplace bullying overlap==
{{Main|Workplace bullying}}
According to [[Gary Namie|Namie]], Machiavellians manipulate and exploit others to advance their perceived personal agendas and to maintain dominance over others.&lt;ref&gt;Namie, G. (2006). Why Bullies Bully? A Complete Explanation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are the guiding principles of Machiavellianism:&lt;ref name=Greenberg&gt;Greenberg J, Baron RA Behavior in Organizations: Understanding and Managing the Human Side of Work (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Never show humility
* Arrogance is far more effective when dealing with others.
* Morality and ethics are for the weak: Powerful people feel free to [[lie]], cheat and deceive others when it suits them.
* It is much better to be feared than loved.

High Machiavellians may be expected to do the following:&lt;ref name=Greenberg/&gt;
* Neglect to share important information.
* Find subtle ways of making another person look bad to management.
* Fail to meet their obligations.
* Spread false rumors about another person.

In studies there was a positive correlation between Machiavellianism and workplace bullying. Machiavellianism predicted involvement in bullying others. The groups of bullies and bully-victims had a higher Machiavellianism level compared to the groups of victims and persons non-involved in bullying. The results showed that being bullied was negatively related to the perceptions of clan and [[adhocracy]] cultures and positively related to the perceptions of [[hierarchical organisation|hierarchy culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Irena Pilch, Elżbieta Turska Journal of Business Ethics February 2014 Relationships Between Machiavellianism, Organizational Culture, and Workplace Bullying: Emotional Abuse from the Target’s and the Perpetrator’s Perspective&lt;/ref&gt;

In research, Machiavellianism was positively associated with subordinate perceptions of [[abusive supervision]] (an overlapping concept with workplace bullying).&lt;ref&gt;Kohyar Kiazada, Simon Lloyd D. Restubog, Thomas J. Zagenczyk, Christian Kiewitz, Robert L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8411">The '''Mainz Diocesan Feud''' ({{lang-de|Mainzer Erzstiftsfehde}}), also known as the '''Baden-Palatine War''' (''Badisch-Pfälzischer Krieg''), took place in 1461/1462 and was a warlike conflict for the throne of the [[Electorate of Mainz]].

== Background ==
[[File:Schedelsche Weltchronik - Mainz.jpg|thumb|Mainz at the end of the 15th century]]
In 1459 the ''[[Domkustos]]'', [[Diether of Isenburg]], was elected, with a small majority, beating [[Adolph II of Nassau|Adolph of Nassau]] to become the new [[Archbishop]] of [[Electorate of Mainz|Mainz]]. Diether immediately had to join the so-called anti-Palatinate alliance which had fallen into a dispute in 1458 with the Count Palatine, [[Frederick I of the Palatinate|Frederick I]]. Diether forged an alliance and marched to war against the Count Palatine, but lost the decisive battle of [[Pfeddersheim]] in July 1460.

Because Diether was able to achieve his papal confirmation only with some difficulty and by paying a large amount of money  (''Servitiengeld'', 20,000 [[guilder]]s), he opposed the political, legal, and financial demands of both Emperor and Pope. Pope [[Pius II]] thus sought his replacement by Adolph of Nassau who had been defeated in the 1459 election. He [[Anathema|banished]] Diether on 21 August 1461 and declared him deposed, citing Diether's oppositional attitude towards the Church and Emperor [[Frederick III (HRR)|Frederick III]], Diether's reform efforts, and his demands for abolition of papal [[annates]]. Adolph of Nassau was appointed by the Pope as the new Archbishop of Mainz and enthroned on 1 October 1461. The city of [[Mainz]], however, continued to support Diether, who refused to vacate the archbishop's throne.

== Course ==
Adolph allied himself with the Archbishop of [[Trier]], [[John II of Baden]]; the Bishop of Metz, [[George of Baden]]; the Bishop of Speyer, [[John II Nix of Hoheneck]]; and Count [[Ulrich V of Württemberg]]. Margrave [[Charles I of Baden]] at first tried to mediate between the warring factions, then took the side of his brother, Bishop George of [[Bishopric of Metz|Metz]], who was in Adolph's camp, thus precipitating the Baden-Palatinate war, an attempt to seize the disputed bishopric by force.

On Diether's side were the city council of Mainz, his brother Louis, and Prince-Elector [[Frederick I of the Palatinate]], originally an enemy of Diether's. For his assistance, Frederick was given the towns of [[Lorsch]], [[Heppenheim (Bergstraße)|Heppenheim]] and [[Bensheim]].

Initially the Baden troops devastated the Palatine estates left of the Rhine, then advanced alongside those from Speyer and Württemberg up the eastern side of the Rhine and rampaged through the Palatine lands there too.

In summer 1462, those on the side of the alliance under Adolph of Nassau believed rumours that Count Palatine Frederick and his troops were holding on in Bavaria in order to stand by the Duke in a [[feud]] against the [[Principality of Ansbach|Margrave of Ansbach]]. Under the assumption that the Palatinate was therefore undefended, Baden and Württemberg troops marched from [[Bretten]] with 8,000 men and invaded the state. They advanced, burning and plundering, from Speyer over the [[Rhine]] to [[Seckenheim]]. Because Frederick I had, however, not stayed in Bavaria, Adolph's forces were surprised and heavily defeated in the forest near Seckenheim by Frederick I and the counts of [[House of Leiningen|Leiningen]] and [[County of Katzenelnbogen|Katzenelnbogen]], because the mounted vanguard of the alliance had felt so unthreatened that they had strayed too far ahead of their foot soldiers. Margrave Charles I and his brother, Bishop George of Metz, were wounded and taken prisoner. With the capture of Count Ulrich V of Württemberg soon afterwards by [[Keckhans von Gemmingen|Hans von Gemmingen]] this phase of the war came to an end. His victory in the [[Battle of Seckenheim]] earned Frederick the nickname "the Victorious" (''der Siegreiche''). The name of the settlement of [[Mannheim-Friedrichsfeld|Friedrichsfeld]] ("Frederick's field"), built on the site and now a district of [[Mannheim]], commemorates that event.

Frederick I had the prisoners taken to his castle at  [[Heidelberg Castle|Heidelberg]] and put in chains until the ransoms demanded by him were paid. Margrave Charles had to pay 25,000 [[guilder]]s, hand over [[Sponheim]] as a pledge and agree [[Pforzheim]] as a [[fief]] of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]]. The Bishop of Metz had to pay 45,000 guilders for his release. Most importantly for Frederick, though, the victory had sealed the long-term security of his position as [[prince-elector]].

But the diocesan feud did not end there. Further battles cost many lives and resulted in the devastation of all the settlements, and the town of Mainz itself suffered severe damage. In the night of 28 October 1462, as a result of the betrayal of some of Mainz's citizens, Adolph of Nassau broke into the town through the gate called the ''Gautor'' with 500 men and, after 12 hours of street fighting took possession of the town. 400 men lost their lives and Adolph's people plundered and sacked parts of the town including the former Dominican monastery. As a punishment for its support of Diether, Adolph removed the town's privileges of freedom and thus its status as a [[Free City of Mainz|free town]]; the town came under the rule of a [[vicedominus]] appointed by the Archbishop. The following day the citizens were summoned to the ''Dietmarkt'' market place. All 800 citizens who appeared were driven out of the town; about 400 of them were released again some time later and allowed to remain in Mainz.

== Conclusion ==
The diocesan feud itself ended only after several attempts at mediation in October 1463. Diether of Isenburg stood down and recognised Adolph as his successor in the [[Treaty of Zeilsheim]]. He himself was paid off with a considerable sum of money and a small principality, created from the Mainz estate, consisting of the towns of [[Frankfurt-Höchst|Höchst]], [[Hanau-Steinheim|Steinheim]] and [[Dieburg]].

The alliances of both contenders for the archbishop's throne had been bought at considerable cost to both their personal and the archiepiscopal estate. A number of castles and towns were transferred to the Palatinate, Hesse and, briefly, even Saxony. The settlement of that debt remained a dominant issue in the Archbishopric in the coming years.

After the death of Adolph in 1475, Diether of Isenburg was once more elected as archbishop by the Mainz cathedral chapter and confirmed by Pope [[Sixtus IV]]. Diether reigned without further conflict until his death in 1482.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2427">The '''Mercer Oak''' was a large [[white oak]] tree that stood in [[Princeton Battlefield State Park]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. The tree was about 300 years old when it was torn by strong winds in March 2000. It was the emblem of Princeton Township and appeared on the seal of the township. The tree is also the key element of the seal of [[Mercer County, New Jersey]].

The Mercer Oak was named after [[Hugh Mercer]], a brigadier general in the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolution]]. During the [[Battle of Princeton]], Mercer was stabbed by an English soldier's bayonet. According to legend, he was unwilling to abandon his troops, and rested on the tree's trunk while they stood their ground. After the battle, Mercer was taken to the Clarke House where he died from his injuries nine days later.

After a lightning storm in 1973 dropped a large branch of the original "Mercer Oak"  Ned Brown, a local artisan cabinet fabricator, from the Skillman, NJ, had the insight to preserve some of the lumber.  Pieces of the preserved lumber were later integrated into the woodwork of a local restaurant. The inlay includes the craftsman's representation of a silhouette of the oak tree, as well as a sections of oak throughout the bar.  The balance of the fallen branches were left in the hands of Princeton's Historical Society.

On March 3, 2000, a wind storm felled the oak's last four branches. For public safety reasons, arborists cut off the remnants of the trunk the day after the tree fell. Following the tree's death, several [[grafting|scions]] from the tree were planted around the battlefield. In May 2000, an 8-foot sapling grown from a Mercer Oak [[acorn]] was planted inside the stump of the former tree.

'''Mibefradil''' ('''Posicor''') is a drug for the treatment of [[hypertension]] and chronic [[angina pectoris]]. It belongs to a group known as [[calcium channel blockers]].

The mechanism of action of mibefradil is characterized by the selective blockade of transient, low-voltage-activated (T-type) calcium channels over long-lasting, high-voltage-activated (L-type) calcium channels, which is probably responsible for many of its unique properties.

It is nonselective.&lt;ref name="pmid7565636"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bezprozvanny I, Tsien RW |title=Voltage-dependent blockade of diverse types of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes by the Ca2+ channel antagonist mibefradil (Ro 40-5967) |journal=Mol.

On June 8, 1998, [[Hoffmann–La Roche|Roche]] announced the voluntary withdrawal of the drug from the market, one year after approval by the FDA, due to the potential for drug interactions, some of them deadly, which may occur when it is taken together with some other medications.&lt;ref&gt;Heart Drug Withdrawn as Evidence Shows It Could Be Lethal: https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/09/us/heart-drug-withdrawn-as-evidence-shows-it-could-be-lethal.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Moldova''' ({{lang-ro|Declarația de independență a Republicii Moldova}}) was a document adopted on 27 August 1991 by the [[Parliament of the Republic of Moldova]] following the failure of the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|August coup attempt]]. 

== Background ==
The document claims "millennial history" and "uninterrupted statehood" within historic and ethnic borders and refers to the official language as "[[Romanian language|Romanian]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presedinte.md/eng/declaration Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Moldova.]&lt;/ref&gt; This founding act of the [[Moldova|Republic of Moldova]] is celebrated as the National Day or [[Independence Day (Republic of Moldova)|Independence Day]]. 

The original document that was approved and signed by 278 parliamentary deputies in 1991 was burned during the [[April 2009 Moldovan parliamentary election protests]], but an identical document was restored in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://metroeireann.com/article/moldova-restores-declaration-of,2554 Moldova restores Declaration of Independence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808042320/http://metroeireann.com/article/moldova-restores-declaration-of,2554 |date=2014-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azi.md/en/story/8658 Text of Moldova's Declaration of Independence recovered]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
The Moldovan Declaration of Independence clearly and directly claims Moldovan [[sovereignty]] over the territory of [[Transnistria]] as "a component part of the historical and ethnic territory of our people".

[[File:Monoposto.jpg|thumb|500px|right|A typical Mono2000 grid in Monoposto, 2008]]

The [http://www.monoposto.co.uk/ Monoposto Racing Club] is a single seater, [[Open wheel|open-wheeled]] motor racing club in the [[United Kingdom]]. Its members race a variety of single seater race cars ranging from 600cc [http://www.formulajedi.com/ Jedi's] to 2000cc [[Formula Three]] and [[Formula Renault]] cars. ''[[Monoposto]]'' is Italian for 'Single Seater'. As of 2010, it is the largest single seater championship in the UK, with over 60 regular race entrants.

Production chassis must be 3 or more years old (unless home designed and built) and use standard road specification iron block engines.

It has several classes of cars: 1000, 1400, 1600, 1800, FR, Classic2000, 2000 and F3; these are based primarily on the maximum permitted [[Engine capacity|engine size]], but also engine tuning freedom, chassis age and chassis materials. Most race meetings have the classes spread over two grids, with the 1000 and 1400 cars on one, and the 2000  classes on another. The 1600 and 1800 classes are alternated between the two, either together or independently, depending on the circuit and expected entry numbers.

Termed 'The Friendly Club', the Monoposto Racing Club encourages both novice and experienced drivers to take part - indeed, novice drivers are made especially welcome, and competitors are usually more than willing to lend a hand (or tools) in the paddock to make a repair or adjustment, or to simply give advice. This is summed up nicely in the [http://www.monoposto.co.uk/about-mrc/club-profile/ club profile].

The Championship visits most major UK race tracks, including [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone GP]], [[Brands Hatch|Brands Hatch GP]], [[Snetterton Motor Racing Circuit|Snetterton]], [[Donington Park|Donington ParkGP]], [[Oulton Park]], [[Castle Combe Circuit|Castle Combe]], [[Pembrey Circuit|Pembrey]] and [[Rockingham Motor Speedway|Rockingham]].

It used to have an annual non-championship event at [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa-Francorchamps]] but rising costs lead to this being cancelled. The club also runs the autumn Tiedeman Championship, named after the clubs founder Frank Tiedeman. Occasional non-championship rounds are also run.

Points are scored for all finishers in their class order, with 15 for 1st place down to 1 for 12th are below. There is also a point for fastest lap in each class.  The championship is decided from the best 10-12 scores from  12-14 or so rounds. Events are generally run over 2 days with 4 track sessions per grid. This may be a separate qualification and race each day or a single qualification session and 3 race sessions.

Recent Monoposto Champions include Jim Blockley (5 times), [http://www.comtecracing.com/ Jonathan Lewis] (2 times), Mark Harrison (3 times, and also 2003 British Sprint Champion), Steve Cave, David Tilson, John Carding, Peter Bragg, Tristan Cliffe (3 times), Robin Dawe (3 times), Geoff Fern, Chris Woodhouse, David Parkinson, Robbie Watts, Ben Cater and Jeremy Timms.

==Class Structure==

===MotoMono===

The Monoposto Racing Club has played a large role in the introduction of modern motorbike engined [[Open wheel car|single seaters]] to UK race circuits. Approximately ten years ago the club regulations permitted motorcycle engined cars to race as part of the 1800cc class. At that time the 1000cc &amp; 1400cc grid contained [http://www.formulajedi.com/ Jedi], re-engined chassis and even one of the Gordon Murray designed, road going, Rockets.

The 1000cc &amp; 1400cc cars rapidly outpaced the other types in the 1800cc class. This was recognised by setting up a Mono1000 &amp; 1400 class. At the time there were few purpose designed 1000 &amp; 1400 cars. Mono1000 &amp; 1400 regulations recognised this by being the only Monoposto class to allow new cars to race.
This is primarily for bike engined cars up to 1000cc with a minimum weight limit with driver of 400&amp;nbsp;kg, or with 1400cc and a 460&amp;nbsp;kg minimum weight limit. Mostly made up of Jedis and JKS/Speads chassis.

The 1000 and 1400 classes were introduced in 2009 as replacement for the 1200S and 1200F classes.

For 2012 the 1400 class was merged with the 1000 class to create MotoMono.

For 2016, the MotoMono class was split into Moto1000 and Moto1400.  Moto1400 was for any car wanting to run a carbon tub, or any spaceframed car wanting to run a bike engine in excess of 1000cc.  The dominating Dallara F3 derived cars moved into this class.  Moto1000 was for the traditional spaceframed Jedi/Speads type of car.

===1600cc===

Introduced in the late 1960s the [[Formula Ford]] 1600 class has been one of the most successful classes in the history of the sport. These cars are still racing today, with thousands of chassis produced and literally years of development to produce safe, reliable racing cars with superb drivability. For several decades Formula Ford chassis have been raced in the MRC. The current Mono 1600 class has its origins in the old "Mono Kent" class, long the core of the club. This class used either Formula Ford engines or Formula Ford engines with a special cam. Today, Formula Fords are still the backbone of the class but while engines remain strictly controlled and therefore cheap and readily available, modifications to the chassis are permitted, such as wings, tyres from other formulae and different size wheels. Minimum weights are around 505&amp;nbsp;kg-525&amp;nbsp;kg, depending on the engine used, to equalise performance. The 1600s are the lowest powered cars in the club, but as thoroughbred single seaters they are by no means slow. There are few road cars below £60,000 that can keep up with a Mono 1600, and indeed most racing saloons struggle to equal our lap times.

===1800cc===

A good case can be made for the Mono 1800 class being the best value class in the Monoposto Championship, this equates to some of the best value racing in the U.K. With 1800cc engines and a minimum weight of 535&amp;nbsp;kg a power:weight ratio of 250&amp;nbsp;hp/tonne is common, and makes the cars surprisingly quick. Given drivers of equal ability, a Mono 1800 is several seconds a lap faster than a Mono1600. Maintenance is limited to oil, brake &amp; tyre changes &amp; keeping the battery charged up, the fuel injection, with its pumps consumes a significant amount of electrical energy.

===ZTEC===
Cars conforming to full Formula Ford Zetec 1800cc specification, with exception of tyres can run in this class or in Mono1800 against modified examples. Introduced for 2013 season.   Merged with Mono1800 for 2014.

===2000cc===

For the majority of the last ten years the Mono2000 class has been the '[[blue riband (disambiguation)|blue riband]]' class in the MRC. The class can claim one of the premier positions in the UK club single seater scene. These cars provide slicks and wings racing with the economy and reliability of a production 2000cc, 16v engine, in a state of tune that would be familiar to those driving the majority of road going [[Lotus Seven|Caterhams and Westfields]] that use similar engines. Frequently the fastest cars in the club, this caters for cars mostly built between 1994 and 2004 with a 2000cc engine and a 560&amp;nbsp;kg weight limit. Power outputs are around 185-195&amp;nbsp;hp, giving a power:weight ratio of around 330&amp;nbsp;hp/tonne.  Typically this class is dominated by [[Dallara]] [[Formula 3|F3]] cars, usually with [[C20XE|Vauxhall]] or [[Toyota 3S-GE|Toyota]] engines running on [[carburettors]] as per the regulations rather than the original F3 injection and restrictor.

For 2010 the Monoposto Racing Club revised the regulations regarding fuelling, and have allowed the use of fuel injection via throttle bodies, with a maximum throttle diameter of 40mm per cylinder, through which all air must pass.  This limit is intended to maintain parity with carburetted engines, so that those not able or not wanting to use injection can remain fully competitive.

There are also a number of other changes to increase the number of cars on the grid - the age limit is now 2004, and sequential gearboxes and aluminium blocks are also allowed. The Mono Formula 2000 class will also merge into Mono2000 (with cars now required to use a 25mm restrictor, rather tham 24mm in 2009), effectively allowing F3 spec cars to race in Monoposto with only minor changes to the cars. Variable valve control engines are banned, even if the mechanism is deactivated.

[[Formula Renault|Formula Renault 2000]] cars are allowed to race, but must be in [[BARC Formula Renault|BARC]] specification, using the 'Blue' 37mm restrictor. This ensures the cars have balanced engine outputs.

===Classic 2000cc===

A new class for 2008 (although it was trialled in 2007), this class uses the same regulations as Mono2000 (although the 2010 changes allowing fuel injection have not passed down to the Classic class), but has an age limit to restrict it to the older cars - typically pre-1993 (although exceptions apply up to 1999 for some makes).  In 2008 this was probably the largest class at any race meeting. Formula 3 cars or [[Formula Vauxhall Lotus]] chassis are the most popular and most competitive.

===Formula Mono===

A trial class for 2009. This class allowed [[Formula Renault#Formula Renault 2.0L|Formula Renault 2000]] and Formula 3 spec cars (with smaller restrictors) to race on the same grid as the other two litre cars, but without upsetting the class balance until the competitiveness of the cars is determined with the 'Mono Spec' cars (those with standard road engines). The class was integrated with Mono2000 in 2010.

'''Vicki Lynne Hoskinson''' (February 2, 1976 - September 17, 1984) was an 8-year-old [[Americans|American]] girl who disappeared while riding her bike to mail a [[birthday card]] to her aunt on what were believed to be safe streets in [[Flowing Wells, Arizona]].&lt;ref name=chris/&gt; Her abductor, Frank Jarvis Atwood, was traced through witness testimony and physical evidence allegedly planted on his car. Seven months later, Vicki's remains were found in a desert area {{convert|20|mi}} away and Atwood was found guilty of [[murder|first degree murder]]. He has been on [[death row]] in Arizona since 1987.

==Background==
On Monday, September 17, 1984, Vicki asked and received permission from her mother, Debbie Carlson, to ride her bike to a mailbox to post a birthday card to her aunt.&lt;ref name=tucson/&gt; This was the first time Carlson had allowed any of her children to go out on their own, previously using the [[buddy system]]. After 20 minutes, Carlson sent Vicki's 11-year-old sister Stephanie to look for her; Stephanie found Vicki's bike lying on the side of the road a few blocks away, and one block from the elementary school.&lt;ref name=tucson&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tucson.com/news/local/crime/after-years-vicki-s-mother-is-fed-up-with-murder/article_32895405-e566-506e-a6b8-b55482da6e52.html|title=After 25 years, Vicki's mother is fed up with murder appeals|first=Kim|last=Smith|work=[[Arizona Daily Star]]|date=10 June 2012|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson placed Vicki's bike in her car trunk and called the Pima County Sheriff's Department. Detective Gary Dhaemers responded, and a few hours later a command center was set up.

==Apprehension of suspect==

[[File:HoskinsonPOI.jpg|thumb|left|Initial FBI composite of a woman seen with a child matching Hoskinson's description prior to Frank Atwood being identified as the perpetrator.]]

After interviews with possible witnesses, Sam Hall, a coach at an elementary school, stated he saw a suspicious-looking driver parked in a vehicle in an alley beside the school on September 17.&lt;ref name=jus/&gt; Hall had been supervising a group of students at play when he noticed a suspicious vehicle. According to Hall, the driver was making strange gestures and was struggling with his stick shift. He memorized the license plate, ran to his car to get a notepad and wrote it down. He later gave it to police after hearing Vicki went missing.&lt;ref name=colin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=shmekil|title=Kidnapping Murder of Leiby Kletzky 8y/o Similar to Vicky Lynn Hoskinson 8y/o|date=2011-07-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C-dDLXqjTQ|accessdate=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A little girl said the driver made an obscene gesture to her as he cruised by her house. Another saw the driver back into a telephone pole.&lt;ref name=tucson/&gt;

The trace on the license plate led to a 28-year-old [[Los Angeles]] man named Frank Jarvis Atwood. Agents ran a [[background check]] and found [[kidnapping]] and [[Child sexual abuse|child molestation charges]].&lt;ref name=tucson/&gt; Atwood was out on parole in California. They went to the address where Atwood's vehicle was registered. It was the home of Atwood's parents, Frank Jarvis Atwood Sr., a [[retired]] army brigadier general and his wife. A few hours later, Atwood called his parents stating his car had broke down in Texas and he needed money wired to get it fixed. His mother wrote down the address in [[Kerrville, Texas]], where Atwood awaited a new transmission. His father then drove to a nearby payphone and reported the address to the FBI. Agents from the FBI's Texas Bureau detained Atwood and his traveling companion, James McDonald, at the mechanic shop on September 20 and impounded the car.&lt;ref name=jus/&gt;

During questioning, Atwood told investigators he was in Vicki's neighborhood on September 17, the day she disappeared, staying in a nearby park. About 3:00 PM, he left to buy drugs and returned to the park about 5:00PM, but did not say where he was during the two-hour period. McDonald corroborated Atwood's story, and told investigators that he and Atwood had an argument in the park about 3:00. After that, Atwood left for two hours and returned with bloodstains on his hands and clothing. Atwood told McDonald he got into a fight with a drug dealer and stabbed him. Investigators found two men who claimed Atwood spent two nights in their trailer. One of them, known as Mad Dog, claimed Atwood's clothes and hands were bloodstained, and that they had suggested Atwood get rid of his clothes. Atwood told them that he stabbed a double-crossing drug dealer.&lt;ref name=chris&gt;{{cite news |title=Justice Delayed |last=Limberis|first=Chris |url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/justice-delayed/Content?oid=1075419 |work=[[Tucson Weekly]] |date=4 March 2004|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
While no physical evidence in the car could be linked to Vicki's person,&lt;ref name=colin&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=IWYaC2nO398C&amp;pg=PA14|title=Murder Two: The Second Casebook of Forensic Detection|first=Colin|last=Evans|year=2004|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0471666998|pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vehicular accident reconstruction|accident reconstruction]] experts matched pink paint on the front bumper of Atwood's vehicle to the color of the paint on Vicki's bike, and traced damage to the car's gravel pan to one of the bike's pedals.&lt;ref name=jus&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/arizona/azdce/4:1998cv00116/252785/509/|title=Frank Jarvis Atwood, Petitioner, vs. Charles L. Ryan, et al, Respondents|publisher=Justia Dockets &amp; Filings|date=27 January 2014|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=colin/&gt; Traces of nickel plating from the bumper were also found on the bike.&lt;ref name=colin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://prezi.com/trilhygfyi5n/the-case-of-vicki-lynn-hoskinson/|title=The Case Of Vicki Lynn Hoskinson|first=Ethan|last=Williams|date=5 February 2014|accessdate=2 April 2015|work=[[Prezi]].com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to the site where the bike was found, investigators discovered damage to the mailbox post about 12 inches above ground, consistent with the height of Atwood's sports car, and believed this to be the spot where the car allegedly struck Vicki's bike at a slow speed.&lt;ref name=colin/&gt; Atwood's alleged bloodstained clothing from the day of Vicki's disappearance was never recovered.

==Arrest and trial==
Ten days after Vicki's disappearance, Atwood was arrested and charged with one count of kidnapping.&lt;ref name=chris/&gt; A month after Vicki's disappearance, Atwood returned to Arizona to stand trial. Because of the publicity of the case in Tucson, the trial was moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. Jury selection took almost 6 weeks, and bail was denied. On December 3, 1984, Atwood pleaded not guilty to kidnapping charges.

==Discovery of remains==
On April 12, 1985, a hiker found a small [[human skull]] in the Tucson desert, about {{convert|20|mi}} from where the bike had been found.&lt;ref name=colin/&gt; The skeleton had been scattered by animals. Due to the state of the remains, the cause of death could not be determined, nor whether the child had been sexually abused.&lt;ref name=tucson/&gt; [[Forensic dentistry|Dental records]] confirmed they were Vicki's remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arizonaalumni.com/article/forensic-legend-our-own-backyard|title=Forensic Legend in Our Own Backyard|first=Jeff|last=Harrison|year=2015|work=Arizona Alumni Magazine|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traces of [[adipocere]] found on the skull fixed the time that the body had been placed in the desert to within 48 hours of Vicki's disappearance.&lt;ref name=colin/&gt; Atwood was [[Indictment|indicted]] and found guilty of first degree murder, and was [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] on May 8, 1987.&lt;ref name=colin/&gt;

During his years on [[death row]], Atwood has "gotten married, been baptized in the Greek Orthodox Christian church, obtained two associate degrees, a bachelor's degree in English/pre-law and a master's degree in literature. He has written six books, five of which have been published. He's also working with people on the outside to create a website".&lt;ref name=tucson/&gt; {{as of|2012}}, he was one of the longest-seated prisoners on death row.&lt;ref name=tucson/&gt; He claims that police tampered with the evidence found on his car, and that no physical evidence has been found placing Vicki in his car.&lt;ref name=tucson/&gt; His ongoing appeals for judicial re-review of his case have been denied.&lt;ref name="tucson.com 13 September 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fischer|first1=Howard|title=Killer loses another appeal in 1984 Tucson murder of Vicki Lynne Hoskinson, 7|url=http://tucson.com/news/local/killer-loses-another-appeal-in-tucson-murder-of-vicki-lynne/article_6f242b50-30a6-576c-b896-edc44f52bd88.html|accessdate=15 January 2018|work=Capitol Media Services|publisher=Arizona Daily Star|date=13 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914070920/http://tucson.com/news/local/killer-loses-another-appeal-in-tucson-murder-of-vicki-lynne/article_6f242b50-30a6-576c-b896-edc44f52bd88.html|archivedate=14 September 2017|language=en|quote=Wednesday's ruling could finally bring Atwood, who has been on death row for 30 years, close to the end of exhausting all of his appeals.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Death row inmate denied appeal|url=https://www.kgun9.com/news/local-news/death-row-inmate-denied-appeal|accessdate=15 January 2018|work=KGUN 9 Digital Staff|agency=KGUN9-TV|publisher=Scripps Media, Inc.|date=13 September 2017|location=Tucson, AZ|quote=Today, the U.S. ninth circuit court of appeals denied Atwood's appeal.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
After her daughter's murder, Debbie Carlson became a [[victims' rights]] activist. She helped establish a victims' advocacy group called "We the People"; worked for the passage of Arizona's Victims' Bill of Rights, which was passed in 1990; and helped institute Southern Arizona's [[Amber Alert]] system in 2000.&lt;ref name=tucson/&gt;

==History==
The first Irish [[Counties of Ireland|inter-county]] [[ploughing contest]] was held between County Wexford and County Kildare on 16 February 1931 in a 26-acre field at Coursetown in [[Athy]] in [[County Kildare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Ploughing People: Farming Life Celebrated, Stories, Traditions, The Championships|last=Cox|first=Valerie|publisher=Hachette Books Ireland|year=2017|isbn=978-1-473-65945-2|location=Ireland|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the National Ploughing Championships has expanded to over 800 acres with 1,700 exhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=2 October 2017 |title=National Ploughing Championships 2017: Tractor highlights on-site |url=http://www.agriland.ie/farming-news/tractor-highlights-on-site-at-this-years-national-ploughing-championships/|publisher=Agriland|date=18 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="overview2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npa.ie/media-2/overviewbackground-of-event/ |title=Background of Event/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915050821/http://www.npa.ie/media-2/overviewbackground-of-event/ |deadurl=no |accessdate=1 October 2015 |archivedate=15 September 2012 |date=2012 |publisher=National Ploughing Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been extended beyond ploughing, farming or machinery enthusiasts, to now featuring attractions such as a tented trade village, live entertainment, music &amp; dancing, fashion shows, craft village, live cooking demonstrations, celebrity appearances, sheep dog trials, pony games &amp; welly throwing.&lt;ref name="qualFreight"&gt;{{cite web|date=August 2015 |title=NPC 2015 |url=http://qualityfreight.com/news/40-npc-2015 |archivedate=24 November 2015 |publisher=Quality Freight |accessdate=24 November 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124161715/http://qualityfreight.com/news/40-npc-2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Founding Fathers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Ploughing People|last=Valerie|first=Cox|publisher=Hachette Books Ireland|year=2017|isbn=978-1-473-65945-2|location=Ireland|pages=13–32. https://books.google.ie/books?id=tmmHDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=Charles+de+Gaulle%2BSean+O%27Farrell&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Nzfrs0uXxt&amp;sig=WxxnIYw92TYWa-lbs7qlDNJ60cM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd35mj2_PbAhUDLMAKHTxCB_wQ6AEIPjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Charles%20de%20Gaulle%2BSean%20O'Farrell&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;===
The original mission statement for the National Ploughing Association, the body organising the championships, was set out as: "To bring the message of good ploughing to all parts of the country and to provide a pleasant and friendly place to meet and do business".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|work=npa.ie |url = http://www.npa.ie/media-2/history-of-the-npa-championships/ |title = History of the NPA &amp; Championships: Formation &amp; Origins of the National Ploughing Association 1931 – 2012|date = |accessdate =24 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the co-founders of the Association, JJ Bergin, became its first managing director. In 1952 he represented Ireland at the first meeting of the World Ploughing Organisation (WPO) and was appointed their vice president.&lt;ref name="Independent Newspapers"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.independent.ie/business/farming/ploughing-championships/milestones-in-the-history-of-the-national-ploughing-championships-26773612.html|title = Milestones in the history of the National ploughing championships|access-date = |website = Business: Ploughing Championships|publisher = Independent Newspapers|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first World Contest was hosted by [[Canada]] in 1953, and the second was in [[Killarney]], [[County Kerry]], Ireland in 1954. That was also the first European venue for the ‘Worlds’, when 10 countries competed. Also in 1954, the first ploughing competition for women was introduced, called the 'Farmerette' class, and which was open to girls and single, married or widowed women and without reference to age. The winner was known as 'Queen of the Plough'.&lt;ref name="Independent Newspapers"/&gt; In 1955 the National Ploughing Championships expanded into a 2-day event. The Association became a limited liability company and was incorporated on 2 March 1956, with number of directors limited to forty, with period of office of one year; its liability limited by guarantee and without shares.

JJ Bergin continued to manage NPA until his passing in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.independent.ie/business/farming/ploughing-championships/milestones-in-the-history-of-the-national-ploughing-championships-26773612.html|title = Milestones in the history of the National ploughing championships|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the founding Managing Director of NPA, JJ Bergin, died in 1958, NPA appointed [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] [[All-Ireland Hurling Final|All-Ireland hurling winner]] [[Sean O' (John) Farrell|Seán O'Farrell]] as Managing Director, a role he held until his death in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Ploughing People|last=Cox|first=Valerie|publisher=Hachette Books Ireland|year=2017|isbn=978-1-473-65945-2|location=Ireland|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A national bread baking competition was introduced by NPA in co-operation with ESB in 1958 that continues to this day. In 1959 he represented the NPA at the 7th World Ploughing Contest to [[Armoy, County Antrim]], [[Northern Ireland]] and that was the first time they held there.&lt;ref name="Past World Events"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://worldploughing.org/?page_id=149|title = Past World Events|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = World Ploughing Organisation|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He attended the 8th World Ploughing Contest in Tor Mancina, [[Rome]], Italy 1960&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.npa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/history9.gif|title = History of the NPA &amp; Championships|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he proudly presented a distinctive block of his native [[Kilkenny Marble]] as Ireland’s contribution to Rome’s ‘Cairn of Peace’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://peace.maripo.com/p_stones.htm|title = Cairns of Peace erected during annual World Ploughing Matches|date = |accessdate = |website = 67 Peace Stones, Rocks, Slabs &amp; Cairns Around the World|publisher = Peace Monuments|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1960&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.npa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/history5.gif|title = History of the NPA &amp; Championships|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the highlights of his tenure of office was in 1961 when representing Ireland at 9th World Ploughing Contest, [[Thiverval-Grignon]], France. He was officially introduced to President of the French Republic, [[Charles De Gaulle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Ploughing People|last=Cox|first=Valerie|publisher=Hachette Books Ireland|year=2017|isbn=978-1-473-65945-2|location=Ireland|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; John was a big man over 6&amp;nbsp;ft. but he proudly displayed that photo on his wall, dwarfed as he was by the 6’ 5" tall President De Gaulle. Another big event was when the first ever Ploughing Championships were filmed by RTÉ at Killarney in 1961, believed to be the first outside coverage by the new television station. It was filmed on 8 and 9 November 1961 and broadcast in the first ever episode of the farming programme ‘On the Land’, on 1 January 1962. The film, featuring both local organiser, Mrs Grosvenor, and Seán, was remarkable in that it was broadcast the day after [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|Teilifís Éireann]] first went on air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=“It’s a little bit bumpy for top class ploughing” 1961|url=http://www.rte.ie/archives/exhibitions/2257-on-the-farm/639454-first-ploughing-championships-on-rt-tv/|website=RTÉ Archives|publisher=RTÉ National TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|Teilifís Éireann]] Archives, itself founded on 1 June 1960, released in 2016 this video from 1961 of then NPA MD, Seán, and current NPA MD, Anna May, at the presentation of the NPC Farmerette trophy to Eiline Brennan from Laois being crowned Queen of the Plough, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/archives/category/environment/2013/0925/476327-queen-of-the-plough-1961/|title=Farmerettes At The Ploughing 1961|last=|first=|date=1961|website=RTE Archives|publisher=RTE|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seán continued to build on NPA’s international profile and in 1964 the NPA sent two competitors to Fuchsenbigl, near [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], where Ireland won their first World Title when the late Charlie Keegan, from [[County Wicklow]] was the winner. It marked a huge Irish International achievement for NPA at that time and was an inspiration to future competitors, demonstrating that the Irish had the standard and the potential to compete with the best in the world.  Arriving home from the world contest in Vienna,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://worldploughing.org/?page_id=369|title = Champions of the World Ploughing Contests since 1953|date = |accessdate = |website = World Ploughing Organisation|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Wicklow man was proudly brought home to [[Enniskerry]], [[County Wicklow]] on an open top bus to be met by bonfires along the roadside as they greeted NPA’s first World Ploughing Champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.1936932.1411332663!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_620_330/image.jpg|title = Charlie Keegan, World Champion, winning the 12th World Ploughing Contest, Fuchsenbigl, Near Vienna, Austria 1964|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; That was a special day for Sean,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ajulFr21X28/VClqzr3uJxI/AAAAAAAACeA/cwo9xeeWQXc/s1600/1962-17-07%2BPloughing%2BChampionship,%2BWicklow%2BC138-8713.jpg|title = NPA Managing Direction Seán O'Farrell on location with Charlie Keegan and co at the Ploughing Championships, Kilmacanogue, County Wicklow, 17 July 1962|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[County Wicklow]] was his adopted county. The [[Irish Times]] reported how the tractor on which Charlie Keegan won World Ploughing Championships in 1964 had now been restored. It was a green Deutz D40L tractor that was magnificently restored to its original condition by his grandson, Michael, devoting 1,000 hours to restoration work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/tractor-on-which-charlie-keegan-won-world-ploughing-championships-in-1964-restored-1.1936935|title = Tractor on which Charlie Keegan won World Ploughing Championships in 1964 restored|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the National Championships 1964, a new Youth class was introduced for Youths 21-28.  In 1965 [[Esso]] became an NPA sponsor and introduced the Esso Supreme Trophy which is still presented to the Senior Conventional Champion annually. In 1966 a new competition was introduced to cater for Students from the Agricultural Colleges. In 1969 the [[Irish Countrywomen's Association]] (ICA) were invited to give demonstrations in cookery and crafts. This also combined with introduction of the Country Markets as the ploughing was an ideal venue to sell produce. Seán held the position of MD until his sudden death in 1972. The [[Kilkenny People]] in their September 1972 obituary recorded that he was NPA Managing Director and a member of World Ploughing Organisation and that the graveside oration was delivered by [[Seán Ó Síocháin]], General Secretary of [[Gaelic Athlethic Association|GAA]].

===A Dream Fulfilled===
The second half of the NPA's 84-year story was led by NPA's long serving Secretary of that time from 1954, Anna May McHugh. In 1973 she was appointed NPA's managing director.  Anna May, has served for 61 years as Secretary of the NPA organisation. She brought to fruition what was once a big idea of NPA founders back in 1931, what became a dream by 1958, and what had been just aspiration by 1972 - turning their collective dream into reality by 2018. And in September 2015, National Ploughing Association Managing Director Anna May McHugh was awarded the [[Order of Agricultural Merit|Officier de l’Ordre du Mérite Agricole]] by the French Ambassador to Ireland Mr Jean-Pierre Thébault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.npa.ie/2015/09/ordre-du-merite-agricole-conferral-to-mrs-anna-may-mchugh/|title = Ordre du Mérite Agricole Conferral to Mrs Anna May McHugh|date = 2015|accessdate = |website = Irish National Ploughing Association|publisher = NPA|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anna May is the Irish Board Member to the Board of the World Ploughing Organisation, where her daughter, Anna Marie McHugh, is now General Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://worldploughing.org/?page_id=43|title = Structure|date = |accessdate = |website = WPO|publisher = World Ploughing Organisation|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1973 was also the year when 20th World Ploughing Contest was held in [[County Wexford]] in a four-day contest that was attended by 100,000 people, and when 25 countries took part. Further World Ploughing events have since been held in Ireland with 29th World Ploughing Contest in Wexford in 1981; the 43rd World Ploughing Contest at [[Teagasc#Teagasc Colleges and Research Centres|Oak Park]], [[County Carlow]] in 1996 and the 53rd World Ploughing Contest at [[Tullow]] [[County Carlow]] in 2006.&lt;ref name="Past World Events"/&gt; In 1994 Wexford man Martin Kehoe brought home the first of his three World Champion titles - in 1994 from [[Outram, New Zealand|Outram]], near Dunedin, New Zealand; in 1995 from [[Egerton University|Egerton]], [[Njoro]], Kenya and in 1999 from [[Pomacle]], France. It is noteworthy that the only other Irish World Champion (apart from first winner, Charlie Keegan) was Eamonn Tracey, winning in [[Saint Jean D'Illac]], France in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://worldploughing.org/?page_id=369|title = Champions of the World Ploughing Contests since 1953.|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = World Ploughing Organisation|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Milestones in their illustrious history were recorded in Independent Newspapers in 2011.&lt;ref name="independent.ie"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.independent.ie/business/farming/ploughing-championships/milestones-in-the-history-of-the-national-ploughing-championships-26773612.html|title = Milestones in the history of the National ploughing championships|date = |access-date = |website = Business: Ploughing Championships|publisher = Independent Newspapers|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with her 32-member board of directors team, she has steered NPA into becoming one of the largest outdoor annual events in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://insideireland.ie/2014/09/24/europes-largest-outdoor-exhibition-and-agricultural-trade-show-the-national-ploughing-championships-takes-place-from-23-25th-september-107058/|title = Irish Business, News and Lifestyle|date = |access-date = |website = Europe’s largest Outdoor Exhibition and Agricultural Trade Show, the National Ploughing Championships finishes on Thursday|publisher = InsideIreland.ie|last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150216153128/http://insideireland.ie/2014/09/24/europes-largest-outdoor-exhibition-and-agricultural-trade-show-the-national-ploughing-championships-takes-place-from-23-25th-september-107058/|archivedate = 16 February 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among their achievements, NPA records that in 1975 the number of national exhibitors was 100, the number of counties competing was 21 and the number of demonstrators was 18. In 1978 the Championships returned to [[County Kilkenny]] this time to the village where Anna May McHugh's predecessor, Seán O'Farrell, was born, [[Knocktopher]]. Attendance figures grew very steadily throughout the 1970s and 1980s until 1988, when the event was expanded to 3 days in order to cater for heavy traffic due to escalating attendances. According to NPA records, the [[Irish Countrywomen's Association|ICA]] and Country Markets then started giving cookery and craft demonstrations at the shows. Other new events were added with the Fashion Show in 1981; their introduction of Shopping and Business Arcades in 1985 and Kverneland World Class Challenge; the Livestock Section in 1987 and the Nissan Classic in 1989. They record that the "Tented Village" era was developed substantially at the ploughing contests throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. They credit [[Enterprise Ireland]] with bringing delegations from a number of countries to review the event, with exhibitors travelling from Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Poland and the USA.

Between 2000 and 2011 the Ploughing Championships had grown to 180,000 spectators, 320 competitors, 1,100 exhibitors, 14 shopping arcades and was by then generating €10m for the local Irish economy.&lt;ref name="independent.ie"/&gt;

Now in its 84th year NPA records that Event costs are in the region of €3.5 million, and have Ploughing Associations in every county in the country of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.npa.ie/county-ploughing-dates/|title = County Ploughing Dates 2014/2015|date = |accessdate = |website = Irish National Ploughing Association|publisher = NPA|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; NPA claims to now hold the biggest National Ploughing Championships in the world, where over 320 competitors participate in the National Finals; to cater for 19 All-Ireland Ploughing Title Classes; are Ireland’s primary Agricultural Exhibition, and hold one of the largest agricultural events in Europe; that many international visitors, exhibitors and delegations from right around Europe and from as far afield as New Zealand now participate; that events have up to 1,100 trade stands which exhibit billions of euro worth of the most modern agri-equipment in the world on exhibition at the Championships.

It is extraordinary that NPA are still a voluntary association that depends on voluntary efforts of their members from all around the country to achieve such goals. With an average of 180,000 spectators, the NPA attendance has grown from the 3,000 that attended in 1932 to over 280,000 in the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.npa.ie/2015/09/another-record-breaking-year/|title = Another Record Breaking Year|date = |accessdate = |website = Irish National Ploughing Association|publisher = NPA|last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151005153529/http://www.npa.ie/2015/09/another-record-breaking-year/|archivedate = 5 October 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; NPA's National Ploughing Championships (NPC) are a shop window to what Irish people can achieve when working together, and a great credit to spirit of rural Ireland ever since the country gained its independence one century ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/video-take-a-tour-of-the-massive-national-ploughing-championships-site-697059.html|title = Take a tour of the massive National Ploughing Championships site|date =22 September 2015 |accessdate =1 October 2015 |website = BreakingNews.ie|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Night and Day Concert''' is a [[concert]] performed by [[Elton John]] on June 30, 1984 in the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. It was broadcast live in full on [[BBC Radio 1]], borrowing [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]]'s FM stereo frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/e0729881620d4f70b3be44372b557486 BBC Genome Project - Radio Times listings]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Qalandiya International''' is a contemporary art event and [[biennale]] that takes place every two years across Palestinian cities and villages. Founded in 2012, it brings together Palestinian and international art and culture organizations in collaboration to produce exhibitions, performances, talks, film screenings, workshops, and tours.

QI coincides with and incorporates The Jerusalem Show, a cultural event organized by the Al-Ma’mal Foundation and centered in the Old City, and the Young Artist of the Year Award (YAYA), organized by the [[A. M. Qattan Foundation]] and given every two years to a Palestinian artist under the age of 30.

== History ==

=== QI 2012 ===
The inaugural Qalandiya International was conceived as a way to create an infrastructure that supported cultural practice across Palestine and the diaspora.  It took place from 1–15 November 2012 under the title ''Art and Life in Palestine'', and was co- produced by the Al-Ma’mal Foundation for Contemporary Art in Jerusalem (which had been producing The Jerusalem Show since 2007), Al Hoash- Palestinian Art Court, the International Academy of Art- Palestine, A. M. Qattan Foundation, Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center, and [[Riwaq (organization)|RIWAQ]] – Center for Architectural Conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/11/201211410554507478.html|title=Biennale seeks to boost Palestinian art|last=Hatuqa|first=Dalia|date=4 November 2012|website=Al Jazeera|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== QI 2014 ===
The second edition of Qalandiya International ran from 22 October- 15 November 2014, under the title ''Archives Lived and Shared.''  [[The Palestinian Museum]] was added as a partner and hosted a documentary survey exhibition, called ‘Introduction to Palestinian Museums.’ Other partners included A. M. Qattan Foundation, Arab Cultural Association, Al Hoash-  Palestinian Art Court, Al- Mashghal, The International Academy of Art- Palestine, Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center, RIWAQ – Center for Architectural Conservation, Ramallah Municipality, MinRASY Projects, Eltiqa Group, and Windows for Contemporary Art.

One of the main exhibitions, ‘Manam,’ which was organized by the Arab Cultural Association in Haifa, was unable to host many of its Palestinian participants, who were prevented from attending by the Israeli- imposed system of permits, roadblocks, and checkpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Nicola|date=2015|title=Qalandiya International I and II: Cultural Resistance in a Palestinian Biennale|url=|journal=Third Text|volume= 29| issue = 3|pages=165–183|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== QI 2016 ===
The third and latest edition of Qalandiya International took place from 5–30 October 2016 under the title ''This Sea is Mine.'' Addressing themes of exile and return, the program launched with 15 exhibition openings and 80 events, taking place in Haifa, Gaza, Jerusalem, Ramallah and Al-Bireh, Bethlehem, Beirut, Amman, and London.  Participating organizations included A. M. Qattan Foundation, Al Hoash – Palestinian Art Court, Al Ma'mal Foundation for Contemporary Art, Arab Culture Association, Dar Al Kalima, Dar El Nimer, Darat Al Funun, Eltiqa Group, International Academy of Art – Palestine, Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center, MinRASY Projects, Palestine Regeneration Group (PART), Ramallah Municipality, RIWAQ – Center for Architectural Conservation, Shababek for Contemporary Art, and The Palestinian Museum.  Programs extended across a patchwork of venues, including, in addition to QI’s main partners, the Palestinian Child Centre &amp; Youth Activities Centre in Shu’fat Refugee Camp (Jerusalem), Dheisheh Refugee Camp (Bethlehem), Ramallah Recreational Complex, Birzeit University, the Palestinian National Garden, and others.  Programs included ‘O Whale, Don’t Swallow Our Moon,’ a solo exhibition for artist [[Jumana Emil Abboud]] at the Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center in Ramallah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/qalandiya-international-biennial-palestine-686522|title=Qalandiya International: A Multi- City Palestinian Biennial for a Fragmented Territory|last=Buffenstein|first=Alyssa|date=7 October 2016|website=Artnet|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2016/12/artseen/reflections-on-the-sea-is-mine-2016-qalandiya-international-in-palestine|title=Reflections on The Sea is Mine: 2016 Qalandiya International in Palestine|last=Reichert|first=Elliot J.|date=6 December 2016|website=The Brooklyn Rail|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online full exhibition catalogue for QI2016: ''This Sea is Mine'' was published by [[Ibraaz]] in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibraaz.org/publications/79|title=Qalandiya International 2016: This Sea is Mine|website=Ibraaz|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early and personal life==
Sandeep Unnikrishnan came from a [[Malayali]] family residing in [[Bangalore]], where they had moved from  [[Cheruvannur]], [[Kozhikode district|Kozhikode District]] in the state of [[Kerala]].&lt;ref name=webd&gt;{{cite news|publisher = WebIndia 123|title = Army Major from Kerala dies in Mumbai encounter|url = http://news.webindia123.com/news/articles/India/20081128/1115900.html|date = 28 November 2008|accessdate =28 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the only son of retired [[ISRO]] officer K. Unnikrishnan and Dhanalakshmi Unnikrishnan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1081129/jsp/nation/story_10182139.jsp | location=Calcutta, India | work=The Telegraph | title=Boy who had a crew cut in school | date=2008-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unnikrishnan spent 14 years at the Frank Anthony Public School in Bangalore before graduating in 1995 in the [[Indian School Certificate|ISC]] Science stream.{{clarify|date=November 2014}} He wanted to join the Army, even attending school in a [[crew cut]]. His peers and teachers recalled him as being a good athlete who was active in school activities and sports events.&lt;ref name="TOI-SchoolRemembers"&gt;{{cite news |agency=Times of India |url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-11-29/bangalore/27943762_1_major-unnikrishnan-major-sandeep-c-browne |title=A school remembers |publisher=TOI |date=2008-11-29 |accessdate=2008-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a member of the school choir and enjoyed watching movies.&lt;ref name="TOI-SchoolRemembers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IT-moviemaniac"&gt;{{cite news |agency=India Today|url = http://indiatoday.digitaltoday.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=21369&amp;sectionid=4&amp;issueid=82&amp;Itemid=1 |title=Sandeep Unnikrishnan: A movie maniac |publisher=India Today |date=2008-11-30 |accessdate=2008-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Army career==
Unnikrishnan joined the [[National Defence Academy (India)]] (NDA), [[Pune]], [[Maharashtra]] in 1995. He was a  part of the Oscar Squadron (No. 4 Battalion) and a graduate of the 94th Course of NDA. He graduated as a [[Bachelor of Arts]].
His NDA friends remember him as "selfless", "generous" and "calm and composed".&lt;ref name="TOI-NDABuddiesRemember"&gt;{{cite news |agency=The Times Of India |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-11-30/india/27910740_1_nsg-buddies-sandeep-unnikrishnan |title=NDA Buddies Remember Unni=The Times Of India |date=2008-11-30 |accessdate=2008-11-30 |first1=Prasenjit |last1=Mund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was commissioned as a [[lieutenant]] to the 7th Battalion of the [[Bihar Regiment]]&lt;ref name=pti1/&gt; (Infantry) on 12 July 1999. After serving the Indian Army in different locations in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] and [[Rajasthan]] during counter insurgencies for two terms, he was selected to join the [[National Security Guards]]. On completion of training, he was assigned to the Special Action Group (SAG) of NSG on January 2007 and participated in various operations of the NSG.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mangalorean.com/news.php?newstype=broadcast&amp;broadcastid=102951 Mangalorean.Com- Serving Mangaloreans Around The World!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; During the 'Ghatak course' (at the Commando Wing (Infantry School), Belgaum), the most difficult course of the Army, Unnikrishnan topped the course, earning an "Instructor Grading" and commendation. He opted for the NSG commando service which he joined on deputation in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-11-29/patna/27911835_1_major-unnikrishnan-nsg-commando-maj-unnikrishnan | work=The Times Of India | first1=Kumod | last1=Verma | title=Bihar Regiment fondly remembers Major Unnikrishnan | date=2008-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Operation Vijay (1999)|Operation Vijay]] in July  1999, he was regarded positively at the forward posts in the face of heavy artillery firing and small arms fire by Pakistan troops. On the evening of 31 December 1999,{{Clarify|date=November 2014}} Unnikrishnan led a team of six soldiers and managed to establish a post 200 metres from the opposing side and under direct observation and fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/001200812101678.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Major Unnikrishnan's colleagues recall his qualities | date=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Black Tornado===
On the night of 26 November 2008, several iconic [[2008 Mumbai attacks|buildings in South Mumbai were attacked]]. One of the buildings where hostage were held was the 100-year-old [[Taj Mahal Palace &amp; Tower|Taj Mahal Palace Hotel]]. Unnikrishnan was the team commander of [[51 Special Action Group]] (51 SAG) deployed in the operation at the hotel to rescue the hostages. He entered the hotel in a group of 10 commandos and reached the sixth floor through the staircase. As the team descended the stairs, they suspected perpetrators on the third floor. A few women were held as hostages in a room which was locked from the inside. After breaking open the door, the round of fire by the perpetrators hit Commando Sunil Yadav, who was Unnikrishnan's colleague.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sify.com/news/fullstory.php?id=14809318 A buddy called Major Unnikrishnan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unnikrishan engaged the perpetrators in a firefight. He arranged for Yadav's evacuation and gave chase to those he had engaged in the firefight who, meanwhile, escaped to another floor of the hotel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sify.com/news/fullstory.php?id=14809318 sify.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In the encounter that followed, he was shot from the back before later succumbing to his injuries.&lt;ref name=hindu1&gt;{{cite news|publisher = The Hindu|title = Sandeep Unnikrishnan waged a valiant battle against terrorists|url = http://www.hindu.com/2008/11/29/stories/2008112959030900.htm|date = 29 November 2008|accessdate =29 November 2008|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibnlive.in.com/news/nation-bids-adieu-to-ats-chief-nsg-commando/79337-3.html Nation bids adieu to ATS chief, NSG commando – India News – IBNLive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Bangalore/Maj_Sandeep_UnniKrishnan_-_A_school_remembers/articleshow/3770767.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=Maj Sandeep UnniKrishnan – A school remembers | date=2008-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2731">'''Sarah Wilson''' (1754? – 1865?) was an [[England|English]] [[impostor]] who took a role of nonexistent sister of [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]]. How much of the tale is true is unclear.

Sarah Wilson was born in [[Staffordshire]] and at the age of 16 moved to [[London]]. According to the usual tale, within a week she became a maidservant to Caroline Vernon, [[lady-in-waiting]] for Queen Charlotte, and was acquainted with the relations and rumours of the court.

Around 1771 Wilson was working in the "Queen's House" (in the place where [[Buckingham Palace]] is now). She began to steal the jewellery and clothing of the queen. She was apprehended and first condemned to death but eventually the sentence was commuted to [[penal transportation]] to the American colonies. In July 1771, Wilson arrived to [[Baltimore, Maryland]] and was sold to W. Devall as an [[indenture]]d servant. A few days later she escaped.

According to the tale, Wilson still had some of the queen's belongings with her. With the queen's dress, she took the role of "Princess Susanna Caroline Matilda of [[House of Mecklenburg|Mecklenburg-Strelitz]]", fictitious sister of Queen Charlotte. She claimed that she had had a disagreement with her family and due to the scandal had moved to America. She fooled a number of [[Virginia]]n landowners with her courtly habits and knowledge of royal affairs. When some local colonials accepted her as genuine, others began to question why no one had ever heard of the queen's sister. The Queen was originally from Germany and this princess spoke only English.

Eventually Devall heard about a woman who looked very much like the girl who had escaped. In 1771 he spread a notice that 'Princess Susanna' was his slave and sent her hireling Michael Dalton to get her back. Dalton found her near [[Charlestown, Virginia]] and dragged her back to Bush Creek.

For two years Wilson worked for Devall, until he joined the rebels at the beginning of the [[American War of Independence]]. Wilson fled and later married [[dragoon]] officer William Talbot. After the war they stayed in the newly formed [[United States of America]].

There is no record of when Sarah Wilson died. Author [[Egon Larsen]] suggested that she died in Bristol in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Egon. (1966) ''The Deceivers: Lives of the Great Impostors''. John Baker Publishers Ltd. p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Selena ¡VIVE!''' ({{lang-en|Selena Lives!}}) was a [[benefit concert]] which was held on the tenth anniversary of the death of [[Tejano music|Tejano]] superstar [[Selena|Selena Quintanilla-Pérez]]. The concert was held on April 7, 2005 at the [[Reliant Stadium]] in [[Houston]], Texas with over 70,000 attendees. The special was produced and filmed by the Spanish language network, [[Univision]], and is the most watched Spanish-language special in U.S. history.

==Concert synopsis==
The special opened with an introduction by  [[Jennifer Lopez]], followed by Selena's original greeting to the fans of her last concert at the [[Houston Astrodome]] on February 26, 1995. The musical tribute also included a performance by Mexican singer [[Thalía]]'s interpretation of one of Selena's songs, "[[Amor Prohibido (song)|Amor Prohibido]]." Thalía's performance was followed by many Latin singers, all performing a collection of Selena's songs.

The group [[Banda el Recodo]] performed a rendition of "[[Techno Cumbia]]." [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[Salsa music|salsa]] group [[La India|India]] performed "[[No Debes Jugar]]." After a short video recounting Selena's discovery, Mexican recording artist [[Ana Bárbara]] performed "[[La Carcacha]]" along with a full complement of dancers. The duet "[[Buenos Amigos]]" was then performed by newcomer [[Mariana Seoane]] and [[Pablo Montero]]. Singer [[Alicia Villarreal]] ended the segment with "[[Si Una Vez]]".

Following another video recalling Selena's international success, Mexican singer [[Ana Gabriel]] dedicated her performance of Selena's "[[Tú, Sólo Tú]]" to her memory. She then introduced [[Pepe Aguilar]], who dedicated his rendition of "[[No Me Queda Más]]." After a video depicting Selena's origins in Texas, the song "[[Fotos Y Recuerdos]]" by [[Paulina Rubio]] was performed.

The next video segment showed Selena's back-up band, Los Dinos, and was narrated by one of its former members, [[Pete Astudillo]]. Astudillo then performed the song he wrote after her death, "Cómo Te Extraño." After a video montage covering Selena's life, [[Puerto Rico]]'s [[Olga Tañón]] performed the song "[[La Llamada]]." Singer [[Gloria Estefan]] performed Selena's English language hit "[[I Could Fall in Love]]."

Selena's brother [[A.B. Quintanilla]] and his group, [[Kumbia Kings]], performed a duet with his sister in a specially remixed version of her hit "[[Baila Esta Cumbia]]". Later, Mexican singer [[Alejandra Guzmán]] performed Selena's song "[[Bidi Bidi Bom Bom]]". This was followed by a [[Tex-Mex]] medley by [[Bobby Pulido]] and Jay Pérez.

The late [[Colombia]]n singer/songwriter [[Soraya (musician)|Soraya]] performed  "[[Dreaming of You (Selena song)|Dreaming of You]]" and was joined on stage by the vocal group Barrio Boyzz. Mexican singer [[Graciela Beltrán]] performed the song "[[El Chico Del Apartamento 512]]."

A video of Selena's legacy was then followed by [[Aleks Syntek]] and [[Fey (singer)|Fey]] performing "[[Donde Quiera Que Estés]]." The band, Montéz de Durango performed an arrangement of "[[Ven Conmigo (album)|Ven Conmigo]]."

At the end of the concert, a video of Selena, performing "[[Como La Flor (song)|Como La Flor]]" played on giant video screens accompanied by Los Dinos, while all the performers returned to the stage to sing the chorus along with a 55-member children's choir from Stevenson Elementary.

==Achievements==
''Selena ¡VIVE!'' also went on to achieve a record breaking 35.9 household rating to become the highest rated and most viewed Spanish-language TV special in the history of [[American television]]. The special was also the number one program regardless of language among adults 18-34 in Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Francisco while tying for first place in New York, beating that night's episode of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s ''[[American Idol]]'', which has historically received high viewer ship due to its popularity.

==Animal welfare controversy==
On February 14, 2018, news spread online that Shangri-la had contacted Pestbusters, a pest control company, to disperse a well established [[cat colony]] at a nearby park because they allegedly ruined the aesthetics of the establishment. The actual numbers vary but it's been reported that at least 20, possibly up to 38 cats, that had been neutered and vaccinated by community volunteers were reported missing. Outraged netizens and animal-lovers immediately started leaving angry comments and emails to the management, and posting negative reviews. The establishment released a statement on their social media account saying that the half of the cats were adopted by its employees while the rest were claimed to have been relocated to two unspecified locations in Taguig.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wheninmanila.com/what-happened-to-the-cats-of-bgc/|title=What happened to the Cats of BGC? {{!}} When In Manila|website=www.wheninmanila.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dailysnout.com/2018/02/18/heres-what-we-know-about-the-cats-relocated-from-shangri-la-at-the-fort/|title=Here's what we know about the cats 'relocated' from Shangri-La at the Fort|date=2018-02-18|work=Daily Snout|access-date=2018-02-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lossoftaguigcats&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/969674/loss-of-taguig-park-cats-sparks-outcry|title=Loss of Taguig park cats sparks outcry|last=Reysio-Cruz|first=Matthew|access-date=2018-02-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Compassion and Responsibility for Animals Welfare Philippines condemned the act saying that the hotel management was ignorant of the Philippine Animal Welfare Act and that Pestbusters violated Republic Act No. 8485 and accused the pest control firm of being motivated by "greed of money".&lt;ref name=lossoftaguigcats/&gt;

'''Smukfest''' (aka '''Skanderborg Festival''') is an annual [[music festival]], held during the first weekend of August in [[Denmark]]. Its location, in a [[beech]] forest in the vicinity of [[Skanderborg]], has given rise to the [[slogan]] "Denmarks' Most Beautiful Festival" (Danish: ''Danmarks Smukkeste Festival'').

The festival covers many styles of music, such as [[rock music|rock]], [[pop music|pop]], [[folk music|folk]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[electronic music|electronic]].
The festival focuses mainly on Danish music, but with some big names from other countries e.g. [[Britney Spears]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Pet Shop Boys]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], [[Fat Boy Slim]], [[Blood Hound Gang]] and many more.

The first festival was held in 1980, and was a one-day event with 7 bands and about 600 spectators.

The festival has a mascot called "Waltidur Festismuk Kærligkys Ølimund Rockilund Trold" (Waltidur Party-beauty Loving-kiss Beer-in-mouth Rock-in-grove Troll), born in 1579, thus the festival was born on Waltidurs 400th birthday.

In 2009, Skanderborg Festival was held for the 30th time and is today the second largest (sleep-over) festival in Denmark, after the [[Roskilde Festival]]. The festival gathered more than 50,000 people for the concerts, including 8,500 workers, most of them volunteers and has reached the current site's maximum capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/musik/skanderborg/ECE2044308/fra-600-til-50000-gaester-smukfest-anklages-for-at-skade-historisk-skov/|title=Fra 600 til 50.000 gæster: Smukfest anklages for at skade historisk skov [from 600 to 50,000 guests: Smukfest accused of damaging historical forest]|author=Maja Lærke Maach|newspaper=Politiken|date=10 August 2013|language=Danish|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival is getting increasingly popular and all 40.000+ tickets for the 2017 festival was sold in less than 5 hours.

==Stages==
The festival has 4 stages (2016):
# Bøgescenerne / The Main Stages
# P3-teltet ([[DR (broadcaster)|Danish National Radio]]  has a station called P3)
# Stjerne-scenen (Star Stage)

'''SpaceX CRS-20''', also known as '''SpX-20''', is a [[Commercial Resupply Services|Commercial Resupply Service mission]] to the [[International Space Station]] planned to be launched in January 2020.&lt;ref name=ISSC /&gt; The mission was contracted by [[NASA]] and is flown by [[SpaceX]] using a [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon]] capsule. This will be the last flight for SpaceX under the first phase of NASA's Commercial Resupply Services. A second phase was awarded in January 2016 and expected to begin in 2019.

==Launch schedule history==
On February 2016, it was announced that NASA had awarded a contract extension to SpaceX for five CRS additional missions ([[SpaceX CRS-16|CRS-16]] to CRS-20).&lt;ref name=sn-20160224spxwinsaddlcrs1 /&gt; A June 2016 NASA Inspector General report had this mission manifested for 2019,&lt;ref name=nasaaig-2016025 /&gt; but by February 2018 the launch had been pushed back to January 2020.&lt;ref name=ISSC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceflight101.com/iss/iss-calendar/ |title=International Space Station Calendar |date=February 24, 2018 |accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary payload==
NASA contracted for the CRS-20 mission from SpaceX and therefore determines the primary payload, date of launch, and [[orbital elements|orbital parameters]] for the [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon space capsule]]. According to a 2016 presentation, the external payload manifested for this flights is '''GEROS'''.&lt;ref name=workshop-matsew20160517 /&gt;

The '''Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens''' ({{IPA-fr|te.atʁ de buf paʁizjɛ̃}}) is a [[Paris]]ian theatre which was founded in 1855 by the [[composer]] [[Jacques Offenbach]] for the performance of [[opéra bouffe]] and [[operetta]]. The current theatre is located in the [[2nd arrondissement of Paris|2nd arrondissement]] at 4 rue Monsigny with an entrance at the back at 65 Passage Choiseul. In the 19th century the theatre was often referred to as the '''Salle Choiseul'''. With the decline in popularity of operetta after 1870, the theatre expanded its repertory to include comedies.&lt;ref name=BPwebsite&gt;[http://www.bouffesparisiens.com/ Bouffes-Parisien website].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lamb&gt;Lamb, Andrew. "Offenbach, Jacques" in Sadie 1992, vol. 3, pp. 653&amp;ndash;658.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Levin&gt;Levin 2009, pp. 401&amp;ndash;402.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galignani 1862, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LFsQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA470 p. 470].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1882, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Salle Lacaze ===
[[File:Bouffes parisiens.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The public at the Bouffes-Parisiens (ca.&amp;nbsp;1860)]]

In February 1855 Offenbach successfully requested a license from the Parisian authorities for the performance of what he described as a "new and original" genre of musical theatre. He justified his proposed endeavour by saying that these works would have mass appeal and would provide opportunities for young French composers.&lt;ref name=Levin/&gt;

The company gave its first performances during the summer of 1855 at the [[Salle Lacaze]]. This theatre was unusually small with a capacity of only 300 spectators,&lt;ref&gt;Lamb ( "Offenbach, Jacques" in Sadie 1992, vol. 3, p. 653) gives the capacity of the Salle Lacaze as 300. Gammond (1980, p. 37) says it held an audience of only 50.&lt;/ref&gt; but was located on the [[Carré Marigny]], near the crowds attending the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle]]. The inaugural performance was on 5 July with Offenbach conducting four of his own works: a prologue called ''Entrez, messieurs, mesdames'', a one-act ''pièce d'occasion'' written by [[Joseph Méry]] and "Jules Servières" (a [[nom de plume]] of [[Ludovic Halévy]], who worked as a government official and needed to protect his reputation); ''Une nuit blanche'', a one-act ''opéra-comique'' on a pastoral theme; ''Arlequin barbier'', a pantomime utilizing themes from Rossini's ''[[Il barbiere di Siviglia]]'' arranged by "Alfred Lange" (Offenbach); and ''[[Les deux aveugles]]'', a one-act ''bouffonerie musicale'' about two swindling "blind" Parisian beggars. The latter was almost cut, since the invited audience who attended the dress rehearsal failed to laugh, but Offenbach decided to retain it, and it was the hit of the opening night. This little piece soon acquired an international reputation (due to visitors from the Exposition), and Offenbach's admirers soon included [[Tolstoy]] and [[Thackeray]]. Further performances in the summer of 1855 were primarily of satirical sketches which only included a few musical numbers. The season, however, was so successful that Offenbach was able to resign his position as conductor of the [[Théâtre Français]].&lt;ref name=BPwebsite/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lamb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faris 1980, pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Salle Choiseul ===

In October Offenbach submitted another petition to the authorities, this time to merge his company with the Théâtre des Jeunes Élèves de Monsieur Comte ([[Théâtre Comte]]). This company's theatre, which was not much larger than the Salle Lacaze, was demolished, and the larger Salle Choiseul with a capacity of about 900 was constructed. The new theatre was not only larger, but warmer, more luxurious and more comfortable than the Salle Lacaze. The orchestra was enlarged from sixteen players to thirty.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb ( "Offenbach, Jacques" in Sadie 1992, vol. 3, p. 653) gives the capacity of 900; Faris (1980, pp. 52–53) provides an extensive quote from the periodical ''Le Ménestrel'' describing the demolition and reconstruction of the theatre and the size of the orchestra.&lt;/ref&gt; Offenbach's new license permitted performances of one-act comedies, with or without music, but with fewer than five characters. It also specifically excluded sketches and required the performance of at least two works by composers other than Offenbach. The first performance of the merged company was on 29 December 1855 at the Salle Choiseul and included the premiere of Offenbach's ''[[Ba-ta-clan]]'', a one-act ''chinoiserie musicale'' with a libretto by [[Halévy]]. From this time performances were primarily given at the Salle Choiseul during the winter theatre season. The company performed at the Salle Lacaze during the 1856, 1857 and 1859 summer seasons,&lt;ref&gt;Yon 2000, pp. 760–762.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;During the summer of 1858 the company went on tour, and Offenbach sublet the Salle Lacaze to [[Jean-Charles Deburau]] (Yon 2000, p. 201). During the summer of 1860 the company performed in Brussels and Lyon. Offenbach himself went to Berlin to supervise the rehearsals and conduct the Berlin premiere of ''Orphée aux enfers'' at the Friedrich-Wilhelmstädtisches Theater on 23 June 1860 (Yon 2000, pp. 232–233).&lt;/ref&gt; however, in March 1861 legislation was enacted which prevented the company from using both theatres, and appearances at the Salle Lacaze were discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;Levin 2009, p. 401.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the restrictions of the license, Offenbach began including longer, more substantial works which violated its terms. For instance, his two-act ''[[Orphée aux enfers]]'' with a cast of 16 received its first performance at the Salle Choiseul on 21 October 1858. Even after Offenbach resigned as the director in January 1862, the company continued at the Salle Choiseul, performing light operas by other composers as well as Offenbach.&lt;ref name=BPwebsite/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lamb/&gt;&lt;ref name=Levin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Andrew. ''"Orphée aux enfers"'' in Sadie 1992, vol. 3, pp. 774&amp;ndash;776.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the departure of Offenbach, the new director tore down the existing hall to erect a larger one with a capacity of 1100 spectators.&lt;ref name=BPwebsite/&gt;

== Legacy ==
While the Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens is indelibly linked to Offenbach, it has also been the venue for a number of other important works. In addition to Offenbach's own operettas, the theatre has seen the premieres of musical works by [[Florimond Ronger|Hervé]], [[Emmanuel Chabrier]] and [[Claude Terrasse]] and playwrights such as [[Robert de Flers]], [[Albert Willemetz]], [[Sacha Guitry]] and [[Henri Bernstein]].

From 1986 to 2007, the Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens was under the directorship of [[Jean-Claude Brialy]], who died of cancer in May 2007.

==List of directors==
The Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens was founded as a private entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;Levin indicates that the company was a private entrepreneurship from its founding in 1855 up until 1885, which is the extent of her coverage of the topic. See Table 16.8. "Chronology and administration of the Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens company" in Levin 2009, p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Anthony Bethell''', known as '''Anthony (or "Tony") Bethell''', (9 April 1922 - 17 February 2004) was born in Dar-es-Salaam in the British territory of [[Tanganyika (territory)|Tanganyika]].  He joined the [[Royal Air Force]] during the [[Second World War]]. After his [[North American P-51 Mustang|Mustang]] was shot down he was taken prisoner and held in the German [[prisoner of war]] camp [[Stalag Luft III]] at Sagan where he actively participated in the [[Stalag Luft III#The .22Great Escape.22|Great Escape]], being one of the 76 officers to break out and make some distance across enemy occupied territory before being recaptured. His name was not one of the 50 who were picked to be executed and he, with 25 others, went back into captivity. He retired from the RAF in 1955 and worked in financial services in Canada. He died in Canada in 2004.

==Early life==
Bethell’s parents lived abroad serving with the British Colonial Services in East Africa and Gibraltar. Bethell was born on 9 April 1922 in [[Dar-es-Salaam]], then part of the British territory of [[Tanganyika (territory)|Tanganyika]]. He and his brother were boarders at Junior Kings School, Sturry, Kent and regularly sailed to Gibraltar to see their parents during school holidays. The Bethell family lived for some years in Gibraltar where his father was state treasurer, and only returned to England after his death.  Bethell’s education was completed at [[Sherborne School]], where he attained the position of head boy.

==Service career==
Joining the [[Royal Air Force]] as an [[Aircraftman|aircraftman 2nd class]] (service number 1314695) in February 1941, he completed pilot training in the USA in Georgia, Alabama and Florida. From there he was posted to a training unit at Hawarden before joining [[No. 268 Squadron RAF|No. 268 (Fighter) Squadron]] as a sergeant-pilot. He was commissioned as a [[pilot officer]] on 7 February 1942 with the RAF officer’s service number 120413&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35547 |date=5 May 1942 |pages=1975–1976  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was promoted to [[flying officer]] on 1 October 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35791 |date=17 November 1942 |page=5041 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equipped with the [[North American P-51 Mustang]], 268 Squadron flew "rhubarbs" (low level sweeps) to attack enemy shipping off the Dutch coast and ground targets such as troop transports and military railway freight. On 26 November 1942, during a mission over the Netherlands he shot down a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] near [[Elburg]] and minutes later a [[Junkers Ju 52]] transport aircraft near [[Oldebroek]].&lt;ref&gt;Foreman (2005), p.208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|London National Archives]] document TNA, Air50/106/7 combat report (Pilot Officer R A Bethell, 268 Squadron, 26 November 1942)&lt;/ref&gt; These were stated in his obituary&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; to be the squadron's first successes and the first of hundreds to fall to Mustangs during the war.

==Capture==
On 7 December 1942 Bethell was a member of a flight flying a low-level ground attack mission in the [[Alkmaar]] area of the Netherlands when his Mustang  “V for Victor” (serial number ''AP212'') was hit by light anti-aircraft fire while only 20 feet off the ground. He crash landed and tried to evade German infantrymen searching for him by hiding in a dyke but was captured.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2000), p.31&lt;/ref&gt; Following interrogation at [[Dulag Luft]] he was sent to prison camp [[Stalag Luft III]] at Sagan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostaircraft.com/database.php?mode=viewentry&amp;e=29480 Loss details of Mustang ''AP212'' at www.lostaircraft.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  During his time in captivity he was promoted flight lieutenant on 7 February 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=36396 |date=7 February 1944 |page=946 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Great Escape==
Bethell participated in "the [[Stalag Luft III escape|Great Escape]]" from [[Stalag Luft III]], he was actively involved in tunneling and hauling away the soil,&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.200&lt;/ref&gt; to build the tunnel in which two hundred men were to slip through a tunnel code named "Harry", which ran {{convert|28|ft}} below the ground and {{convert|365|ft}} outwards.  Due to a calculation error, it surfaced just short of the tree-line which was supposed to give cover to the escapers. The 77th escaper was spotted by a guard around 5am and the alarm sounded.  Bethell’s position during the escape was initially at "Leicester Square", the second staging point along the tunnel's length. His role was to pull 20 men through until relieved by escaper number 65 and then escape himself and take cover in the woods to await the next nine men before making good his escape.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004), p.13&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Model Stalag Luft III.jpg|thumb|right|305px|Model of Stalag Luft III prison camp.]]
After pulling out 12 men, Bethell had to sit in his cramped underground space for 45 minutes until the next man arrived and explained that someone had got stuck and had to be pulled back and the tunnel repaired. Shortly after Bethell's group had cleared the tunnel into the woods there was a shot signalling that the escape had been discovered. They broke into twos and Bethell joined [[Les Long]] known to all as "Cookie",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2194329/LONG,%20JAMES%20LESLIE%20ROBERT Commonwealth War Graves Commission casualty details for Flight Lieutenant James Leslie Robert Long RAFVR]&lt;/ref&gt; hoping to cross the Czech border about 40 miles distant. Snow and flooding forced them to alter their route toward [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankfurt an der Oder]] where they hoped to hop on a freight train and escape to Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004), p.160&lt;/ref&gt; They walked along a railway line, slept in a barn at night then started to travel in daylight but were captured at [[Bernau bei Berlin|Bernau]]. Long and Bethell were held in the ''[[Gestapo]]'' prison at [[Görlitz]] until Long was taken away and shot. Bethell was returned to the prison camp.&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.195&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Russian [[Red Army]] approached Sagan in January 1945, Bethell was amongst the column of prisoners of war marched towards [[Lübeck]], arriving shortly before the end of the war.

==Later career==
On release from wartime service he joined the trading company Gellatly Hankey in Africa working in the [[Khartoum]] and [[Addis Ababa]] area until boredom led him to rejoin the general duties branch of the [[Royal Air Force]] as a flight lieutenant on 7 December 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=38814 |date=17 January 1950 |page=283 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a navigator instructor and also served as personal assistant to [[George Pirie (RAF officer)|Air Chief Marshal Sir George Pirie]]. In 1953 he was posted to [[No. 145 Squadron RAF|No. 145 Squadron]] at [[Celle]] in Germany flying the [[de Havilland Vampire]], before becoming a flight commander on [[No. 16 Squadron RAF|No. 16 Squadron]], also operating Vampires from Celle close to the East German border. Bethell finally retired from the RAF in June 1955, after which he emigrated to Canada.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1456126/Flight-Lieutenant-Tony-Bethell.html ''The Daily Telegraph'' obituary, 6 March 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was initially employed in the [[Brokerage firm|brokerage business]] in Montreal, he worked for Elican, a Belgian company and later joined the financial services industry. On retiring in the early 1990s he and his wife Lorna moved to a farm at [[Caledon, Ontario]], north of Toronto, where he spent much time on a [[John Deere]] tractor cutting fallow hayfields.

==Death==
Tony Bethell died in Canada on 17 February 2004.

'''USS ''Harwood'' (DD/DDE-861)''' was a {{sclass-|Gearing|destroyer}} of the [[United States Navy]], in service from 1945 to 1973. She was transferred to Turkey in 1973 and sunk in error by Turkish aircraft on 22 July 1974.

==History==
She was named for [[Commander]] [[Bruce L. Harwood]] USN (1910–1944) who was twice awarded the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]], and killed in action during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]].

''Harwood'' was laid down by the [[Bethlehem Steel Corporation]] at [[San Pedro, California|San Pedro]] in [[California]] on 29 October 1944, launched on 22 May 1945, by Mrs. Bruce Lawrence Harwood, widow of Commander Harwood and commissioned on 28 September 1945, Comdr. Reid P. Fiala in command..

===Operational history===
====1945–1973====
After shakedown along the California coast, ''Harwood'' joined the [[United States Seventh Fleet]] in Chinese waters. In addition to aiding in the [[Occupation of Japan|occupation of Japan]], the destroyer also participated in fleet and [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine (ASW) exercises]] before returning to [[San Diego]] 21 February 1947. Harwood entered the [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]] after a second Western Pacific cruise in January 1949 to be equipped with the latest antisubmarine equipment. Redesignated '''DDE-861''' on 4 March 1950, the escort destroyer reported to her new home port, [[Naval Station Newport]], [[Rhode Island]], on 11 September 1949 to participate in research on cold weather ASW operations as well as fleet and training exercises. Departing Norfolk in late August, ''Harwood'' made her first [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] cruise with the [[United States Sixth Fleet]] and returned to the United States 10 November 1950.

[[File:USS Harwood (DD-861) off San Pedro CA in 1945.jpg|thumb|left|''Harwood'' in October 1945.]]

Subsequent years fell into a pattern for ''Harwood'' as she engaged in varied training maneuvers and made yearly cruises to the Mediterranean. ''Harwood'' sailed 4 January 1957 for a 3-month ASW demonstration which took her along the South American coast to [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], [[Chile]], [[Panama]] and [[Cuba]]. Entering the [[New York Naval Shipyard]] on 2 May 1961, ''Harwood'' underwent a [[Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization]] (FRAM II) overhaul. Her bridge was totally reconstructed, new types of torpedo tubes were installed, and the 76 mm antiaircraft guns were removed to accommodate a hangar and launching deck for [[Gyrodyne QH-50 DASH]] anti-submarine drones. Departing the yard 2 February 1962, ''Harwood'' sailed to her home port, [[Naval Station Mayport]], [[Florida]], and from there to the [[Caribbean Sea]]. When the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] erupted in October 1962, ''Harwood'' and sailed with 4 hours notice to join the blockading fleet "quarantining" Cuba.  She returned to Mayport on 2 November 1962 and was redesignated '''DD-861''' on 1 July 1963.

''Harwood'' sailed for the Mediterranean on 6 August 1963 and provided ASW service during exercise "Riptide IV" en route. She transited the [[Straits of Gibraltar]] on the 22d for intense periods of [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]], anti-submarine, and [[Binary chemical weapon|binary chemical weapon]] exercises in the Mediterranean Sea. Returning home 23 December, the destroyer operated along the [[East Coast of the United States]] until getting under way 31 March 1964 for a brief visit to [[Brazil]]. She arrived at [[Annapolis, Maryland]] on 1 June, embarked [[Midshipman|midshipmen]], and sailed for [[Europe]]. She visited [[Norway]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], and the [[United Kingdom]] before debarking the "Middies" at [[Naval Station Norfolk]].

In April 1965, she began overhaul and alterations at the [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]]. On 22 August she returned to Mayport en route to [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]], Cuba, for refresher training. She operated along the coast of the United States' southern states until departing Mayport on 22 July 1966 for the Mediterranean deployment. On this tour she transited the [[Suez Canal]] and visited [[Aden]] and [[Kenya]] before rejoining the 6th Fleet in the Medediterranean Sea on 2 November 1965.

''Harwood'' returned home 17 December. She operated out of Newport, off the [[New England]] coast until sailing for her 10th Mediterranean deployment 29 June 1967. Reaching [[Naval Station Rota, Spain]] on 10 July, ''Harwood'' soon joined the 6th Fleet, an element of stability in the ancient and volatile sea which had so recently been churned by the [[Six-Day War]].

''Harwood'' continued alternated operations along the East Coast of the United States and in the Caribbean Sea with the [[United States Second Fleet|2nd Fleet]] with deployments to the Mediterranean Sea until being decommissioned and stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 1 February 1973.

====1973–1974====
''Harwood'' was transferred to the [[Turkish Navy]] on 17 December 1973, and renamed '''TCG ''Kocatepe'' (D 354)'''. The ship was sunk in [[Friendly fire|error]] by Turkish [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] aircraft on 22 July 1974 &lt;ref name=bilalis&gt;Bilalis, Aris. ''Turecka inwazja Cypru w 1974'', in: "Okręty Wojenne" Nr. 3/2001 (48), p. 68-69 (in Polish)&lt;/ref&gt;, mistaking it for a Greek vessel during [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish landings]] on [[Cyprus]] (some publications claim 21 July 1974&lt;ref name=bilalis/&gt;). Sixty-seven Turkish marines and members of her crew were killed in the incident.

{{Campaignbox Wars of the Roses}}
The '''Wars of the Roses''' were a series of [[English civil wars]] for control of the [[throne of England]] fought between supporters of two rival [[Cadet branch|branches]] of the royal [[House of Plantagenet]]: the [[House of Lancaster]], associated with [[Red Rose of Lancaster|a red rose]], and the [[House of York]], whose symbol was [[White Rose of York|a white rose]]. Eventually, the wars eliminated the [[patrilineality|male lines]] of both families. The conflict lasted through many sporadic episodes between 1455 and 1487, but there was related fighting before and after this period between the parties. The power struggle ignited around social and financial troubles following the [[Hundred Years' War]], unfolding the structural problems of [[Bastard feudalism|feudalism]], combined with the mental infirmity and weak rule of King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] which revived interest in [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard of York]]'s [[House of York#Descent from Edward III|claim to the throne]]. Historians disagree on which of these factors to identify as the main reason for the wars.{{sfn|Grummitt|2012|pp=[{{google books|ESdz_nc_A2QC|pg=PR18|plainurl=yes}} xviii]–xxi}}

With the Duke of York's death, the claim transferred to his heir, Edward, who later became the first Yorkist [[List of English monarchs|king of England]], as [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]]. He reigned from 1461, interrupted by a Lancastrian uprising and [[Readeption of Henry VI|reinstallment of Henry VI]] in 1470 to 1471, until his sudden death in 1483. His son reigned for 78 days as [[Edward V of England|Edward V]], but was then deposed by his uncle, who became [[Richard III of England|Richard III]].

The final victory went to a relative and claimant of the Lancastrian party, Henry Tudor, son of Henry VI's half-brother Edmund [[Earl of Richmond]], who defeated Richard III at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]]. After assuming the throne as [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], he married [[Elizabeth of York]], the eldest daughter and heir of Edward IV, thereby uniting the two claims. The [[House of Tudor]] ruled the [[Kingdom of England]] until 1603, with the death of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], granddaughter of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York.

The name "Wars of the Roses" refers to the [[Royal badges of England|heraldic badges]] associated with two rival [[cadet branch|branches]] of the [[House of Plantagenet|same royal house]], the [[White Rose of York]] and the [[Red Rose of Lancaster]]. ''Wars of the Roses'' came into common use in the 19th century after the publication in 1829 of ''[[Anne of Geierstein]]'' by [[Sir Walter Scott]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2012|p=xix}}&lt;ref&gt;During Shakespeare's time people used the term ''Civil Wars'': cf. e.g., the title of [[Samuel Daniel]]'s work, the ''First Four Books of the Civil Wars''&lt;/ref&gt; Scott based the name on a scene in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'' (Act 2, Scene 4), set in the gardens of the [[Temple Church]], where a number of noblemen and a lawyer pick red or white roses to show their loyalty to the Lancastrian or Yorkist faction respectively. It is often suggested by literary critics  {{citation needed|date=September 2018}} that [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' has strong [[allegory|allegorical]] references to the conflict with York represented by the [[White_Queen_(Through_the_Looking-Glass)|White Queen]] and Lancaster represented by the [[Red Queen_(Through_the_Looking-Glass)|Red Queen]].

The Yorkist faction used the symbol of the white rose from early in the conflict, but the Lancastrian red rose was apparently introduced only after the victory of [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]] at the [[Battle of Bosworth]], when it was combined with the Yorkist white rose to form the [[Tudor rose]], which symbolised the union of the two houses;{{sfn|Goodwin|2012|p=xxi}} the origins of the Rose as a cognizance itself stem from [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]'s use of "a golden rose stalked proper." {{sfn|Boutell|1914|p=228}} Often, owing to nobles holding multiple titles, more than one badge was used: [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], for example, used both his [[sun in splendour]] as [[Earl of March]], but also his father's falcon and [[fetterlock]] as [[Duke of York]]. Badges were not always distinct; at the [[Battle of Barnet]], Edward's 'sun' was very similar to the [[John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford|Earl of Oxford]]'s [[De Vere family|Vere]] star, which caused fateful confusion.{{sfn|Cokayne|1910|pp=240–241}}

Most, but not all, of the participants in the wars wore [[livery badge]]s associated with their immediate lords or patrons under the prevailing system of [[bastard feudalism]]; the wearing of livery was by now confined to those in "continuous employ of a lord", thus excluding, for example, mercenaries.{{sfn|Bellamy|1989|p=19}} Another example: Henry Tudor's forces at Bosworth fought under the banner of a [[Welsh Dragon|red dragon]]{{sfn|Boutell|1914|p=229}} while the Yorkist army used Richard III's [[personal device]] of a [[white boar]].{{sfn|Boutell|1914|p=26}}

Although the names of the rival houses derive from the cities of [[York]] and [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], the corresponding [[duchy]] and [[duke]]dom had little to do with these cities. The lands and offices attached to the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] were mainly in [[Gloucestershire]], [[North Wales]], [[Cheshire]], and (ironically) in [[Yorkshire]], while the estates and castles of the [[Duke of York]] were spread throughout England and Wales, many in the [[Welsh Marches]].{{sfn|Rowse|1966|p=109}}

==Summary of events==
[[File:Map- Wars of the Roses.jpg|thumb|Important locations in the Wars of the Roses]]

Tensions within England during the 1450s centered on the mental state of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] and on his inability to produce an heir with his wife, [[Margaret of Anjou]].  In the absence of a direct heir, there were two rival branches with claims to the throne should Henry die without issue, being the [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort family]], led by [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset]], and the [[House of York]], headed by [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York]].  By 1453, issues had come to a head: though Margaret of Anjou was pregnant, Henry VI was descending into increasing mental instability, by August becoming completely non-responsive and unable to govern.  A [[Magnum Concilium|Great Council]] of nobles was called, and through shrewd political machinations, Richard had himself declared [[Lord Protector]] and chief regent during the mental incapacity of Henry.  In the interlude, Margaret gave birth to a healthy son and heir, [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales|Edward]].

By 1455, Henry had regained his faculties, and open warfare came at the [[First Battle of St Albans]]. Several prominent Lancastrians died at the hands of the Yorkists.  Henry was again imprisoned, and Richard of York resumed his role as Lord Protector. Although peace was temporarily restored, the Lancastrians were inspired by [[Margaret of Anjou]] to contest York's influence, and a deadly [[feud]] between the two branches of the royal family ensued.

Fighting resumed more violently in 1459. York and his supporters were [[Battle of Ludford Bridge|forced to flee the country]], and Henry once again restored to direct rule, but one of York's most prominent supporters, [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|the Earl of Warwick]], invaded England from [[Calais]] in October 1460 and captured Henry VI yet again at the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]]. York returned to the country and for the third time became [[Lord Protector|Protector of England]], but was dissuaded from claiming the throne, though [[Act of Accord|it was agreed that he would become heir to the throne]] (thus displacing Henry and Margaret's son, [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales|Edward of Westminster]], from [[History of the English line of succession|the line of succession]]). Margaret and the remaining Lancastrian nobles gathered their army in the [[Northern England|north of England]].

When York moved north to engage them, he and his second son [[Edmund, Earl of Rutland|Edmund]] were killed at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] in December 1460. The Lancastrian army advanced south and released Henry at the [[Second Battle of St Albans]], but failed to occupy [[London]], and subsequently retreated to the north. York's eldest son, Edward, [[Earl of March]], was proclaimed [[Edward IV of England|King Edward IV]]. He gathered the Yorkist armies and won a crushing victory at the [[Battle of Towton]] in March 1461.

After Lancastrian revolts in the north were suppressed in 1464, Henry was captured once again and placed in the [[Tower of London]]. Edward fell out with his chief supporter and adviser, [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|the Earl of Warwick]] (known as the "Kingmaker") after Edward's unpopular and secretly conducted marriage with the widow of [[John Grey of Groby|a Lancastrian supporter]], [[Elizabeth Woodville]].  Within a few years, it became clear that Edward was favouring his wife's family and alienating a number of friends closely aligned with Warwick as well.

[[File:Battle of Barnet retouched.jpg|thumb|left|A near-contemporary Flemish picture of the [[Battle of Barnet]] in 1471]]

Furious, Warwick tried first to supplant Edward with his younger brother [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|George, Duke of Clarence]], establishing the alliance by marriage to his daughter, [[Isabel Neville, Duchess of Clarence|Isabel Neville]].  When that plan failed, due to lack of support from [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], Warwick sailed to France with his family and made an alliance with the former Lancastrian Queen, [[Margaret of Anjou]], to restore [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] to the throne.

This resulted in two years of rapid changes of fortune, before Edward IV once again won complete victories at [[Battle of Barnet|Barnet]] (14 April 1471), where Warwick was killed, and [[Battle of Tewkesbury|Tewkesbury]] (4 May 1471) where the Lancastrian heir, [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales]] was killed, or perhaps executed after the battle.  Queen Margaret was escorted to [[London]] as a prisoner and Henry was murdered in the [[Tower of London]] several days later, ending the direct Lancastrian line of succession.

A period of comparative peace followed, ending with the unexpected death of King Edward in 1483. His surviving brother, [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]], first moved to prevent the unpopular Woodville family of Edward's widow from participating in the government during the minority of Edward's son, [[Edward V of England|Edward V]], and then seized the throne for himself, using the suspect legitimacy of Edward IV's marriage as pretext.

[[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]], a distant relative of the Lancastrian kings who had inherited their claim, defeated [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] at [[Battle of Bosworth Field|Bosworth]] in 1485. He was crowned Henry VII, and married [[Elizabeth of York]], daughter of Edward IV, to unite and reconcile the two houses.  Yorkist revolts, directed by [[John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln]] and others, flared up in 1487 under the banner of the pretender [[Lambert Simnel]]—who claimed he was [[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick|Edward, Earl of Warwick]] (son of George of Clarence), resulting in the last pitched battles.

Though most surviving descendants of Richard of York were imprisoned, sporadic rebellions continued until 1497, when [[Perkin Warbeck]], who claimed he was [[Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York|the younger brother of Edward V]], one of the two disappeared [[Princes in the Tower]], was imprisoned and later executed.

==Origins of the conflict==
===Disputed succession===
[[William the Conqueror]]'s son [[Henry I of England|King Henry I of England]] died in 1135, after [[William Adelin|his only male heir]] was killed aboard the [[White Ship]]. Following the White Ship disaster, England entered a period of prolonged instability known as [[The Anarchy]]. However, following the ascension of Henry of [[Anjou]] to the throne in 1154 as [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], the crown passed from father to son or brother to brother with little difficulty until 1399.{{sfn|Wagner|2001|p=206}}

[[File:Henry4.JPG|thumb|[[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]]]

The question of succession after [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]'s death in 1377 is said to be the cause of the Wars of Roses.{{sfn|Mortimer|2006|p=320}} He had five surviving legitimate sons: [[Edward, the Black Prince]] (1330–1376); [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel, Duke of Clarence]] (called 'Lionel of Antwerp' 1338–1368); [[John of Gaunt|John, Duke of Lancaster]] (called 'John of Gaunt'; 1340–1399); [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|Edmund, Duke of York]] (called 'Edmund of Langley' 1341–1402); and [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Thomas, Earl of Buckingham]] (1355–1397). Although Edward III's succession seemed secure, there was a "sudden narrowing in the direct line of descent" near the end of his reign.{{sfn|Saul|2005|pp=153–154}} His eldest son, Edward, the Black Prince, had died the year before. Edward III was succeeded on the throne by the Black Prince's only surviving son [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], who was only 10 years old.{{sfn|Bennett|1998|p=584}} Richard's claim to the throne was based on the principle that the son of an elder brother had priority in the succession over his uncles. Since Richard was a minor, had no siblings, and had three living uncles at the time of Edward III's death, there was considerable uncertainty about who was next in line for the succession after Richard.{{sfn|Bennett|1998|pp=584–585}}

If Richard II died without legitimate offspring, his successors by [[primogeniture]] would be the descendants of Lionel of Antwerp, Edward III's second son. Clarence's only daughter, [[Philippa, 5th Countess of Ulster]], married into the [[Mortimer#Medieval magnates|Mortimer]] family and had a son, [[Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March]] (1374–1398), who technically had the best claim to succeed. However, a legal decree issued by Edward III in 1376 introduced some complexity into the question of who would ultimately take the throne. The [[letters patent]] he issued limited the right of succession to male heirs, which placed his third son John of Gaunt ahead of Clarence's descendants, because the Mortimer line of descent passed through a daughter.{{sfn|Saul|2005|pp=153–154}}

Richard II's reign was marked by increasing dissension between the King and several of the most powerful nobles.{{sfn|Rowse|1966|pp=14–24}} In 1399, he exiled Gaunt's son [[Henry IV of England|Henry of Bolingbroke]]. Richard's government had become highly unpopular beyond his strongholds in [[Cheshire]] and [[Wales]]. Throughout his reign, Richard had repeatedly switched his choice of heir in order to keep his political enemies at bay{{sfn|Mortimer|2007|loc=appendix 2}} and perhaps to reduce the chances of [[Deposition (politics)|deposition]]. Nevertheless, when Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, initially to reclaim his rights as [[Duke of Lancaster]], he took advantage of the support of most of the nobles to depose Richard and was crowned King Henry IV, establishing the [[House of Lancaster]] on the throne.

====House of Lancaster====
[[File:Henry5.JPG|thumb|[[Henry V of England|Henry V]]]]

The House of Lancaster descended from John of Gaunt, third surviving son of Edward III of England. Their name derives from John of Gaunt's primary title of Duke of Lancaster, which he held [[Jure uxoris|by right of his spouse]], [[Blanche of Lancaster]]. They had received explicit preference from Edward III in the line of succession because they formed the most senior unbroken [[Patrilineality|male line of descent]] from him.

Henry IV's claim to the throne was through his father, John of Gaunt. At the onset of Richard II's reign, Gaunt was the official [[heir presumptive]], but due to the intrigues of his turbulent rule, the succession was unclear by the time of his deposition. Therefore, an argument could be made that the legitimate king of England was not Henry IV, but instead was [[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March]], the son of Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March. However, there was little support at the time for his counter-claim. Certainly many people believed it to be the case. As Henry's initial popularity waned, the Mortimer family's claim to the throne was a pretext for the major [[Glyndŵr Rising|rebellion]] of [[Owain Glyndŵr]] in [[Wales]], and other, less successful, revolts in [[Cheshire]] and [[Northumberland]]. There were uprisings in support of the Mortimers' claim throughout Henry IV's reign, which lasted until 1413.

A peculiarity of Henry IV's seizure of the throne is demonstrated in the way he announced his claim. He was vague, and he resigned himself to mentioning that he was the rightful heir of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], who had died more than a century before, perhaps subtly implying that all English kings ever since ([[Edward I of England|Edward I]], [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], Edward III and Richard II) had not been rightful monarchs. Henry IV seems to have been exploiting a legend that Henry III's second son [[Edmund Crouchback|Edmund "Crouchback", 1st Earl of Lancaster]], was in fact his eldest son but had been removed from succession because he had a physical deformity, which gave origin to his nickname. Since Henry IV was Edmund's descendant and heir through his mother Blanche of Lancaster, he was in fact the rightful king. There is no evidence for this legend, and Edmund's nickname did not stem from a deformity.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

An important branch of the House of Lancaster was the [[House of Beaufort]], whose members were descended from Gaunt by his mistress, [[Katherine Swynford]]. Originally illegitimate, they were made legitimate by an Act of Parliament when Gaunt and Katherine later married. However, Henry IV excluded them from the line of succession to the throne.{{sfn|Seward|1995|p=39}}

Henry IV's son and successor, [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], inherited a temporarily pacified nation, and his military success against France in the [[Hundred Years' War]] bolstered his popularity, enabling him to strengthen the Lancastrian hold on the throne. Nevertheless, one notable conspiracy against Henry, the [[Southampton Plot]], took place during his nine-year reign. This was led by [[Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge|Richard, Earl of Cambridge]], who attempted to place Edmund Mortimer, his brother-in-law, in the throne. Cambridge was executed for [[treason]] in 1415, at the start of the campaign that led to the [[Battle of Agincourt]].

====House of York====
The founder of the [[House of York]] was Edmund of Langley, the fourth son of Edward III and the younger brother of John of Gaunt. Their family name comes from Edmund's title [[Duke of York]], which he acquired in 1385. However, the superiority of their claim is not based on the male line, but on the female line, as descendants of Edward III's second son Lionel of Antwerp. Edmund's second son, Richard, Earl of Cambridge, who was executed by Henry V, had married [[Anne de Mortimer]], daughter of Roger Mortimer and sister of Edmund Mortimer. Anne's grandmother, [[Philippa, 5th Countess of Ulster|Philippa of Clarence]], was the daughter of Lionel of Antwerp. The Mortimers were the most powerful [[Welsh Marches|marcher]] family of the fourteenth century.{{sfn|Wagner|2001|p=141}} G.M. Trevelyan has written that "the Wars of the Roses were to a large extent a quarrel between Welsh [[Marcher Lord|Marcher Lords]], who were also great English nobles, closely related to the English throne."{{sfn|Griffiths|1968|p=589}}

[[File:Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge.jpg|thumb|Anne Mortimer's husband [[Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge|Richard, Earl of Cambridge]]]]
Anne de Mortimer had died in 1411. When her brother Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, who had loyally supported Henry, died childless in 1425, the title and extensive estates of the [[Earl of March|Earldom of March]] and the Mortimer claim to the throne thus passed to Anne's descendants.

[[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York|Richard of York]], the son of Cambridge and Anne Mortimer, was four years old at the time of his father's execution. Although Cambridge was [[Attainder|attainted]], Henry V later allowed Richard to inherit the title and lands of Cambridge's elder brother [[Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York|Edward, Duke of York]], who had died fighting alongside Henry at Agincourt and had no issue. Henry, who had three younger brothers and was himself in his prime and recently married to the French princess, [[Catherine of Valois]],{{sfn|Wagner|2001|p=141}} had no doubt that the Lancastrian right to the crown was secure.

Henry's premature death in 1422, at the age of 36, led to his only son [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] coming to the throne as an infant and the country being ruled by a divided Council of regency. Henry V's younger brothers produced no surviving legitimate issue, leaving only distant cousins (the Beauforts) as alternative Lancaster heirs. As Richard of York grew into maturity and questions were raised over Henry VI's fitness to rule, Richard's claim to the throne thus became more significant. The revenue from the York and March estates also made him the wealthiest magnate in the land.{{sfn|Rowse|1966|p=109}}

===Henry VI===
From early childhood, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] was surrounded by quarrelsome councillors and advisors. His younger surviving paternal uncle, [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]], sought to be named [[Lord Protector]] and deliberately courted the popularity of the common people for his own ends{{sfn|Royle|2009|pp=160–161}} but was opposed by his half-uncle [[Henry Beaufort|Cardinal Henry Beaufort]]. On several occasions, Beaufort called on [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford|John, Duke of Bedford]], Humphrey's older brother, to return from his post as Henry VI's [[regent]] in [[Kingdom of France|France]], either to mediate or to defend him against Humphrey's accusations of treason.{{sfn|Goodwin|2012|p=20}} Henry VI's coming of age in 1437 brought no end to the noblemen's scheming, as his weak personality made him prone to being swayed and influenced by select [[courtier]]s, especially those whom he deemed his [[favourite]]s. Some time after, Cardinal Beaufort withdrew from public affairs, partly due to old age and partly because [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk]], rose to become the dominant personality at court.{{sfn|Goodwin|2012|p=34}} Suffolk and the Beauforts were widely held to be enriching themselves through their influence on Henry, and were blamed for mismanaging the government and poorly executing the continuing [[Hundred Years' War]] with France. Under Henry VI, all the land in France won by [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] and even the provinces of [[Guyenne|Guienne]] and [[Gascony]], which had been held since the reign of Henry II three centuries previously, were lost.

Opposition to Suffolk and Beaufort was led by Humphrey of Gloucester, and Richard of York]]. Humphrey felt that the lifetime efforts of his brothers, of himself, and of many Englishmen in the war against France were being wasted as the French territories slipped from English hands, especially since Suffolk and his supporters were trying to make large diplomatic and territorial concessions to the French in a desperate attempt for peace. In this, Gloucester enjoyed little influence, as Henry VI tended to favour Suffolk and Beaufort's faction at court due to its less [[War hawk|hawkish]] and more conciliatory inclinations. The Duke of York, Bedford's successor in France, and at times also described as a skeptic of the peace policy, became entangled in this dispute as Suffolk and the Beauforts were frequently granted large money and land grants from the king, as well as important government and military positions, redirecting much needed resources away from York's campaigns in France.

[[File:King Henry VI.jpg|thumb|[[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]]]
Suffolk eventually succeeded in having Humphrey of Gloucester arrested for treason. Humphrey died while awaiting trial in prison at [[Bury St Edmunds]] in 1447. Some authorities date the start of the War of the Roses from the death of Humphrey. At the same time, Richard of York was stripped of the prestigious military command in France and sent to govern the relatively distant [[Lordship of Ireland|Ireland]], whereby he could not interfere in the proceedings of the court. However, with severe reverses in France, Suffolk was stripped of office and was murdered on his way to exile. [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset]] (Cardinal Beaufort's nephew), succeeded him as leader of the party seeking peace with France. The Duke of York meanwhile represented those who wished to prosecute the war more vigorously, and criticised the court, and Somerset in particular, for starving him of funds and men during his campaigns in France.

In all these quarrels, Henry VI had taken little part. He was seen as a weak, ineffectual king. In addition, he displayed several symptoms of mental illness{{sfn|Goodwin|2012|pp=60–70}} that he may have inherited from his maternal grandfather, [[Charles VI of France]]. By 1450 many considered Henry incapable of carrying out the duties and responsibilities of a king.

In 1450, there was a violent popular revolt in Kent, [[Jack Cade's Rebellion]], which is often seen as the prelude to the Wars of the Roses.{{sfn|Wagner|2001|p=133}} The rebel manifesto, ''[[The Complaint of the Poor Commons of Kent]]'' written under Cade's leadership, accused the crown of extortion, perversion of justice, and election fraud. The rebels occupied parts of London, and executed [[James Fiennes, 1st Baron Saye and Sele]], the unpopular [[Lord High Treasurer]], after a hasty trial. After some of them fell to looting, they were driven out of [[London]] by the citizens. They dispersed after they were supposedly pardoned but several, including Cade, were later executed.{{sfn|Rowse|1966|pp=123–124}} After the rebellion the rebels' grievances formed the basis of Richard of York's opposition to a royal government from which he felt excluded.{{sfn|Wagner|2001|p=133}}

Two years later, in 1452, Richard of York returned to England from his new post as Lieutenant of Ireland and marched on London, demanding Somerset's removal and reform of the government. At this stage, few of the nobles supported such drastic action, and York was forced to submit to superior force at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]]. He was imprisoned for much of 1452 and 1453{{sfn|Rowse|1966|p=125}} but was released after swearing not to take arms against the court.

The increasing discord at court was mirrored in the country as a whole, where noble families engaged in private feuds and showed increasing disrespect for the royal authority and for the courts of law. In many cases feuds were fought between old-established families, and formerly minor nobility raised in power and influence by Henry IV in the aftermath of the rebellions against him. The [[Percy-Neville feud|quarrel]] between the Percys—long the Earls of Northumberland—and the comparatively upstart Nevilles was the best-known of these private wars and followed this pattern, as did the [[Bonville–Courtenay feud]] in [[Cornwall]] and [[Devon]].{{sfn|Royle|2009|pp=207–208}} A factor in these feuds was the presence of large numbers of soldiers discharged from the English armies that had been defeated in France. Nobles engaged many of these to mount raids, or to pack courts of justice with their supporters, intimidating suitors, witnesses and judges.

This growing civil discontent, the abundance of feuding nobles with private armies, and corruption in Henry VI's court formed a political climate ripe for civil war. With the king so easily manipulated, power rested with those closest to him at court, in other words, Somerset and the Lancastrian faction. Richard and the Yorkist faction, who tended to be physically placed further away from the seat of power, found their power slowly being stripped away. Royal power and finances also started to slip, as Henry was persuaded to grant many royal lands and estates to the Lancastrians, thereby losing their revenue.

In 1453, Henry suffered the first of several bouts of complete mental collapse, during which he failed even to recognise his new-born son, [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales|Edward of Westminster]]. On 22 March 1454, Cardinal [[John Kemp]], the [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor]], died. Henry was incapable of nominating a successor.{{sfn|Goodwin|2012|pp=63–64}} To ensure that the country could be governed, a Council of Regency was set up, headed by the Duke of York, who still remained popular with the people, as [[Lord Protector]]. York soon asserted his power with ever-greater boldness (although there is no proof that he had aspirations to the throne at this early stage). He imprisoned Somerset and backed his Neville allies (his brother-in-law, [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|the Earl of Salisbury]], and Salisbury's son, [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|the Earl of Warwick]]), in their continuing feud with the [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]], a powerful supporter of Henry.

Henry recovered in 1455 and once again fell under the influence of those closest to him at court. Directed by Henry's queen, the powerful and aggressive [[Margaret of Anjou]], who emerged as the ''de facto'' leader of the Lancastrians, Richard was forced out of court. Margaret built up an alliance against Richard and conspired with other nobles to reduce his influence. An increasingly thwarted Richard (who feared arrest for treason) finally resorted to armed hostilities in 1455.

==Start of the war==
[[File:Siege of London (MS 1168).jpg|thumb|The Lancastrian siege of London in 1471 is attacked by a Yorkist sally.]]
Richard, Duke of York, led a small force toward London and was met by Henry's forces at [[St Albans]], north of London, on 22 May 1455. The relatively small [[First Battle of St Albans]] was the first open conflict of the civil war. Richard's aim was ostensibly to remove "poor advisors" from King Henry's side. The result was a Lancastrian defeat. Several prominent Lancastrian leaders, including Somerset and Northumberland, were killed. After the battle, the Yorkists found Henry hiding in a local tanner's shop, abandoned by his advisers and servants, apparently having suffered another bout of mental illness. (He had also been slightly wounded in the neck by an arrow.){{sfn|Farquhar|2001|p=131}} York and his allies regained their position of influence. With the king indisposed, York was again appointed Protector, and Margaret was shunted aside, charged with the king's care.

For a while, both sides seemed shocked that an actual battle had been fought and did their best to reconcile their differences, but the problems that caused conflict soon re-emerged, particularly the issue of whether the Duke of York, or Henry and Margaret's infant son, Edward, would succeed to the throne. Margaret refused to accept any solution that would disinherit her son, and it became clear that she would only tolerate the situation for as long as the Duke of York and his allies retained the military ascendancy.

Henry recovered and in February 1456 he relieved York of his office of Protector.{{sfn|Rowse|1966|p=136}} In the autumn of that year, Henry went on [[royal progress]] in [[the Midlands]], where the king and queen were popular. Margaret did not allow him to return to London where the merchants were angry at the decline in trade and the widespread disorder. The king's court was set up at [[Coventry]]. By then, the new [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]] was emerging as a favourite of the royal court. Margaret persuaded Henry to revoke the appointments York had made as Protector, while York was made to return to his post as lieutenant in Ireland.

Disorder in the capital and the [[Northern England|north of England]] (where fighting between the Nevilles and Percys had resumed {{sfn|Rowse|1966|p=138}}) and piracy by French fleets on the south coast were growing, but the king and queen remained intent on protecting their own positions, with the queen introducing [[conscription]] for the first time in England. Meanwhile, York's ally, Warwick (later dubbed "The Kingmaker"), was growing in popularity in London as the champion of the merchants; as [[List of Captains, Lieutenants and Lords Deputies of English Calais|Captain of Calais]] he had fought piracy in [[English Channel|the Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, A.J. (2007). ''Warwick the Kingmaker'', London, pp. 177–178&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1458, [[Thomas Bourchier (bishop)|Thomas Bourchier]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], attempted to arrange a reconciliation. The lords had gathered in London for a Grand Council and the city was full of armed retainers. The Archbishop negotiated complex settlements to resolve the blood-feuds that had persisted since the Battle of St. Albans. Then, on [[Lady Day]] (25 March), the King led a "[[The Love Day|love day]]" procession to [[Old St Paul's Cathedral|St. Paul's Cathedral]], with Lancastrian and Yorkist nobles following him, hand in hand.{{sfn|Rowse|1966|p=138}} No sooner had the procession and the Council dispersed than plotting resumed.

==Act of Accord==
[[File:Ludlow Castle gatehouse.jpg|thumb|[[Ludlow Castle]], South Shropshire]]

The next outbreak of fighting was prompted by Warwick's high-handed actions as [[List of Captains, Lieutenants and Lords Deputies of English Calais|Captain of Calais]]. He led his ships in attacks on neutral [[Hanseatic League]] and Spanish ships in the Channel on flimsy grounds of sovereignty. He was summoned to London to face enquiries, but he claimed that attempts had been made on his life, and returned to Calais. York, Salisbury and Warwick were summoned to a royal council at Coventry, but they refused, fearing arrest when they were isolated from their own supporters.{{sfn|Rowse|1966|p=139}}{{sfn|Royle|2009|pp=239–240}}

York summoned the Nevilles to join him at his stronghold at [[Ludlow Castle]] in the Welsh Marches. On 23 September 1459, at the [[Battle of Blore Heath]] in Staffordshire, a Lancastrian army failed to prevent Salisbury from marching from [[Middleham Castle]] in Yorkshire to Ludlow. Shortly afterwards the combined Yorkist armies confronted the much larger Lancastrian force at the [[Battle of Ludford Bridge]]. Warwick's contingent from the garrison of [[Calais]] under [[Andrew Trollope]] defected to the Lancastrians, and the Yorkist leaders fled. York returned to Ireland, and his eldest son, [[Edward IV of England|Edward, Earl of March]], Salisbury and Warwick fled to Calais.

The Lancastrians were back in total control. York and his supporters were [[attainder|attainted]] at the [[Parliament of Devils]] as traitors. Somerset was appointed Governor of Calais and was dispatched to take over the vital fortress on the French coast, but his attempts to evict Warwick were easily repulsed. Warwick and his supporters even began to launch raids on the English coast from Calais, adding to the sense of chaos and disorder. Being attainted, only by a successful invasion could the Yorkists recover their lands and titles. Warwick travelled to Ireland to concert plans with York, evading the royal ships commanded by the [[Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter|Duke of Exeter]].{{sfn|Rowse|1966|p=140}}
In late June 1460, Warwick, Salisbury and Edward of March crossed the Channel and rapidly established themselves in [[Kent]] and London, where they enjoyed wide support. Backed by a papal emissary who had taken their side, they marched north. King Henry led an army south to meet them while Margaret remained in the north with Prince Edward. At the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]] on 10 July, the Yorkist army under Warwick defeated the Lancastrians, aided by treachery in the king's ranks. For the second time in the war, King Henry was found by the Yorkists in a tent, abandoned by his retinue, having apparently suffered another breakdown. With the king in their possession, the Yorkists returned to London.

In the light of this military success, Richard of York moved to press his claim to the throne based on the illegitimacy of the Lancastrian line. Landing in north [[Wales]], he and his wife [[Cecily Neville|Cecily]] entered London with all the ceremony usually reserved for a monarch. [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] was assembled, and when York entered he made straight for the throne, which he may have been expecting the Lords to encourage him to take for himself as they had acclaimed Henry IV in 1399. Instead, there was stunned silence. York announced his claim to the throne, but the Lords, even Warwick and Salisbury, were shocked by his presumption; they had no desire at this stage to overthrow King Henry. Their ambition was still limited to the removal of his councillors.

The next day, York produced detailed [[genealogy|genealogies]] to support his claim based on his descent from [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence]]. York's claim was through a daughter of a second son, Henry's through the son of a third son. The judges felt that [[Common law]] principles could not determine who had priority in the royal succession, and declared the matter "above the law and passed ther lernyng."{{sfn|Bennett|1998|pp=580}} Parliament agreed to consider the matter and accepted that York's claim was better, but by a majority of five, they voted that Henry VI should remain as king. A compromise was struck in October 1460 with the [[Act of Accord]], which recognised York as Henry's successor, disinheriting Henry's six-year-old son, Edward. York accepted this compromise as the best offer. It gave him much of what he wanted, particularly since he was also made Protector of the Realm and was able to govern in Henry's name.

==Death of Richard, Duke of York==
[[File:SandalCastle pugneys emley.JPG|thumb|Ruins of [[Sandal Castle]], near Wakefield, West Yorkshire]]
Queen Margaret and her son had fled to north [[Wales]], parts of which were still in Lancastrian hands. They later travelled by sea to [[Scotland]] to negotiate for Scottish assistance. [[Mary of Gueldres]], Queen Consort to [[James II of Scotland]], agreed to give Margaret an army on condition that she cede the town of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]] to Scotland and Mary's daughter be betrothed to Prince Edward. Margaret agreed, although she had no funds to pay her army and could only promise booty from the riches of southern England, as long as no looting took place north of the [[River Trent]].

The Duke of York left London later that year with the Earl of Salisbury to consolidate his position in the north against the Lancastrians who were reported to be massing near the city of [[York]]. He took up a defensive position at [[Sandal Castle]] near [[Wakefield]] over Christmas 1460. Then on 30 December, his forces left the castle and attacked the Lancastrians in the open, although outnumbered. The ensuing [[Battle of Wakefield]] was a complete Lancastrian victory. Richard of York was slain in the battle, and both Salisbury and York's 17-year-old second son, [[Edmund, Earl of Rutland]], were captured and executed. Margaret ordered the heads of all three placed on the gates of York.

==Edward's claim to the throne==
[[File:Sundogs - New Ulm-Edit1.JPG|left|thumb|[[Parhelion]] at sunset]]

The Act of Accord and the events of Wakefield left the 18-year-old Edward, Earl of March, York's eldest son, as Duke of York and heir to his claim to the throne. With an army from the pro-Yorkist Marches (the border area between England and Wales), he met [[Jasper Tudor]]'s Lancastrian army arriving from Wales, and he defeated them soundly at the [[Battle of Mortimer's Cross]] in Herefordshire. He inspired his men with a "vision" of three suns at dawn (a phenomenon known as "[[parhelion]]"), telling them that it was a portent of victory and represented the three surviving York sons; himself, [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|George]] and [[Richard III of England|Richard]]. This led to Edward's later adoption of the sign of the [[sun in splendour|sunne in splendour]] as his [[personal device]].

Margaret's army was moving south, supporting itself by looting as it passed through the prosperous south of England. In London, Warwick used this as propaganda to reinforce Yorkist support throughout the south – the town of [[Coventry]] switched allegiance to the Yorkists. Warwick's army established fortified positions north of the town of St Albans to block the main road from the north but was outmanoeuvred by Margaret's army, which swerved to the west and then attacked Warwick's positions from behind. At the [[Second Battle of St Albans]], the Lancastrians won another big victory. As the Yorkist forces fled they left behind King Henry, who was found unharmed, sitting quietly beneath a tree.

Henry knighted thirty Lancastrian soldiers immediately after the battle. In an illustration of the increasing bitterness of the war, Queen Margaret instructed her seven-year-old son Edward of Westminster to determine the manner of execution of the Yorkist knights who had been charged with keeping Henry safe and had stayed at his side throughout the battle.

As the Lancastrian army advanced southwards, a wave of dread swept London, where rumours were rife about savage northerners intent on plundering the city. The people of London shut the city gates and refused to supply food to the queen's army, which was looting the surrounding counties of [[Hertfordshire]] and [[Middlesex]].

==Yorkist triumph==
[[File:EdwardIVofEngland-Yorkist.jpg|thumb|left|[[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]]]]
Edward of March, having joined with Warwick's surviving forces, advanced towards London from the west at the same time that the queen retreated northwards to [[Dunstable]]; as a result, Edward and Warwick were able to enter London with their army. They found considerable support there, as the city was largely Yorkist-supporting. It was clear that Edward was no longer simply trying to free the king from bad councillors, but that his goal was to take the crown. [[Thomas Kempe]], the [[Bishop of London]], asked the people of London their opinion and they replied with shouts of "King Edward". The request was quickly approved by Parliament, and Edward was unofficially appointed king in an impromptu ceremony at [[Westminster Abbey]]; Edward vowed that he would not have a formal [[coronation]] until Henry VI and his wife were removed from the scene. Edward claimed Henry had forfeited his right to the crown by allowing his queen to take up arms against his rightful heirs under the Act of Accord. Parliament had already accepted that Edward's victory was simply a restoration of the rightful heir to the throne.

Edward and Warwick marched north, gathering a large army as they went, and met an equally impressive Lancastrian army at Towton. The [[Battle of Towton]], near York, was the biggest battle of the Wars of the Roses. Both sides agreed beforehand that the issue would be settled that day, with no quarter asked or given. An estimated 40,000–80,000 men took part, with over 20,000 men being killed during (and after) the battle, an enormous number for the time and the greatest recorded single day's loss of life on English soil. Edward and his army won a decisive victory, and the Lancastrians were routed, with most of their leaders slain. Henry and Margaret, who were waiting in York with their son Edward, fled north when they heard the outcome. Many of the surviving Lancastrian nobles switched allegiance to King Edward, and those who did not were driven back to the northern border areas and a few castles in Wales. Edward advanced to take York, where he replaced the rotting heads of his father, his brother, and Salisbury with those of defeated Lancastrian lords such as the notorious [[John Clifford, 9th Baron de Clifford]] of Skipton-Craven, who was blamed for the execution of Edward's brother Edmund, Earl of Rutland, after the [[Battle of Wakefield]].

==Edward IV==
[[File:SDJ Harlech Castle Gatehouse.jpg|right|thumb|[[Harlech Castle]], Gwynedd, Wales]]

The official coronation of Edward IV took place in June 1461 in London, where he received a rapturous welcome from his supporters.

After the Battle of Towton, Henry VI and Margaret had fled to Scotland, where they stayed with the court of [[James III of Scotland|James III]] and followed through on their promise to cede Berwick to Scotland. Later in the year, they mounted an attack on [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], but, lacking money, they were easily repulsed by Edward's men, who were rooting out the remaining Lancastrian forces in the northern counties. Several castles under Lancastrian commanders held out for years: [[Dunstanburgh]], [[Alnwick]] (the Percy family seat), and [[Bamburgh]] were some of the last to fall.

There was also some fighting in Ireland. At the [[Battle of Piltown]] in 1462, the Yorkish supporter Thomas FitzGerald, 7th Earl of Desmond, defeated the Lancastrian Butlers of Kilkenny. The Butlers suffered more than 400 casualties. Local folklore claims that the battle was so violent that the local river ran red with blood, hence the names Pill River and Piltown (''Baile an Phuill'', meaning "Town of the blood").

There were Lancastrian revolts in the north of England in 1464. Several Lancastrian nobles, including the third [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]], who had apparently been reconciled to Edward, readily led the rebellion. The revolt was put down by Warwick's brother, [[John Neville, 1st Marquess of Montagu|John Neville]]. A small Lancastrian army was destroyed at the [[Battle of Hedgeley Moor]] on 25 April, but because Neville was escorting Scottish commissioners for a treaty to York, he could not immediately follow up this victory. Then on 15 May, he routed Somerset's army at the [[Battle of Hexham]]. Somerset was captured and executed.

The deposed King Henry was later captured for the third time at [[Clitheroe]] in Lancashire in 1465. He was taken to London and held prisoner at the [[Tower of London]], where, for the time being, he was reasonably well treated. About the same time, once England under Edward IV and Scotland had come to terms, Margaret and her son were forced to leave Scotland and sail to France, where they maintained an impoverished court in exile for several years.{{sfn|Rowse|1966|pp=155–156}} The last remaining Lancastrian stronghold was [[Harlech Castle]] in Wales, which surrendered in 1468 after a seven-year-long siege.

==Warwick's rebellion and the death of Henry VI==
[[File:Middleham Castle.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Middleham Castle]]]]
The powerful Earl of Warwick ("the Kingmaker") had meanwhile become the greatest landowner in England. Already a great magnate through his wife's property, he had also inherited his father's estates and had been granted much forfeited Lancastrian property. He also held many of the offices of state. He was convinced of the need for an alliance with France and had been negotiating a match between Edward and a French bride. However, Edward had married [[Elizabeth Woodville]], the widow of a Lancastrian knight, in secret in 1464. He later announced the news of his marriage as ''fait accompli'', to Warwick's considerable embarrassment.

This embarrassment turned to bitterness when the Woodvilles came to be favoured over the Nevilles at court. Many of Queen Elizabeth's relatives were married into noble families and others were granted peerages or royal offices. Other factors compounded Warwick's disillusionment: Edward's preference for an alliance with [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] rather than France and reluctance to allow his brothers [[George, Duke of Clarence]] and [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]], to marry Warwick's daughters [[Isabel Neville|Isabel]] and [[Anne Neville|Anne]]. Furthermore, Edward's general popularity was on the wane in this period with higher taxes and persistent disruptions of law and order.
[[File:Louis-XI.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Louis XI of France]]]]

By 1469, Warwick had formed an alliance with Edward's jealous and treacherous brother George, who married Isabel Neville in defiance of Edward's wishes in Calais. They raised an army that defeated the king's forces at the [[Battle of Edgecote Moor]]. Edward was captured at [[Olney, Buckinghamshire]], and imprisoned at [[Middleham Castle]] in Yorkshire. (Warwick briefly had ''two'' Kings of England in his custody.) Warwick had the queen's father, [[Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers]], and her brother [[John Woodville|John]] executed. However, he made no immediate move to have Edward declared illegitimate and place George on the throne.{{sfn|Rowse|1966|p=162}} The country was in turmoil, with nobles once again settling scores with private armies (in episodes such as the [[Battle of Nibley Green]]), and Lancastrians being encouraged to rebel.{{sfn|Baldwin|2002| p= 43}} Few of the nobles were prepared to support Warwick's seizure of power. Edward was escorted to London by Warwick's brother [[George Neville (archbishop)|George Neville]], the [[Archbishop of York]], where he and Warwick were reconciled, to outward appearances.

When further rebellions broke out in [[Lincolnshire]], Edward easily suppressed them at the [[Battle of Losecoat Field]]. From the testimony of the captured leaders, he declared that Warwick and George, Duke of Clarence, had instigated them. They were declared traitors and forced to flee to France, where Margaret of Anjou was already in exile. [[Louis XI of France]], who wished to forestall a hostile alliance between Edward and Edward's brother-in-law [[Charles the Bold]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], suggested the idea of an alliance between Warwick and Margaret. Neither of those two formerly mortal enemies entertained the notion at first, but eventually they were brought round to realise the potential benefits. However, both were undoubtedly hoping for different outcomes: Warwick for a puppet king in the form of Henry VI or his young son; Margaret to be able to reclaim her family's realm. In any case, a marriage was arranged between Warwick's daughter Anne and Margaret's son Edward of Westminster, and Warwick invaded England in the autumn of 1470.

[[File:MS Ghent - Battle of Tewkesbury.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Tewkesbury]]]]

Edward IV had already marched north to suppress another uprising in Yorkshire. Warwick, with help from a fleet under his nephew, the [[Bastard of Fauconberg]], landed at Dartmouth and rapidly secured support from the southern counties and ports. He occupied London in October and paraded Henry VI through the streets as the restored king. Warwick's brother John Neville, who had recently received the empty title Marquess of Montagu and who led large armies in the Scottish marches, suddenly defected to Warwick. Edward was unprepared for this event and had to order his army to scatter. He and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, fled from Doncaster to the coast and thence to [[Holland]] and exile in Burgundy. They were proclaimed traitors, and many exiled Lancastrians returned to reclaim their estates.

Warwick's success was short-lived, however. He over-reached himself with his plan to invade Burgundy in alliance with the King of France, tempted by King Louis' promise of territory in the Netherlands as a reward. This led Edward's brother-in-law, Charles of Burgundy, to provide funds and troops to Edward to enable him to launch an invasion of England in 1471. Edward landed with a small force at [[Ravenspur]] on the Yorkshire coast. Initially claiming to support Henry and to be seeking only to have his title of Duke of York restored, he soon gained the city of York and rallied several supporters. His brother George turned traitor again, abandoning Warwick. Having outmaneuvered Warwick and Montagu, Edward captured London. His army then met Warwick's at the [[Battle of Barnet]]. The battle was fought in thick fog, and some of Warwick's men attacked each other by mistake. It was believed by all that they had been betrayed, and Warwick's army fled. Warwick was cut down trying to reach his horse. Montagu was also killed in the battle.

Margaret and her son Edward had landed in the [[West Country]] only a few days before the Battle of Barnet. Rather than return to France, Margaret sought to join the Lancastrian supporters in Wales and marched to cross the [[River Severn|Severn]] but was thwarted when the city of [[Gloucester]] refused her passage across the river. Her army, commanded by the fourth successive [[Edmund Beaufort, 4th Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]], was brought to battle and destroyed at the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]]. Her son Prince Edward, the Lancastrian heir to the throne, was killed. With no heirs to succeed him, Henry VI was murdered shortly afterwards, on 21 May 1471, to strengthen the Yorkist hold on the throne.

==Richard III==
[[File:King Richard III from NPG.jpg|left|thumb|[[Richard III of England|Richard III]]]]

The restoration of Edward IV in 1471 is sometimes seen as marking the end of the Wars of the Roses proper. Peace was restored for the remainder of Edward's reign. His youngest brother, [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]], and Edward's lifelong companion and supporter, [[William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings|William Hastings]], were generously rewarded for their loyalty, becoming effectively governors of the north and midlands respectively.{{sfn|Baldwin|2002| p= 56}} George of Clarence became increasingly estranged from Edward, and was executed in 1478 for association with convicted traitors.

When Edward died suddenly in 1483, political and dynastic turmoil erupted again. Many of the nobles still resented the influence of the queen's Woodville relatives (her brother, [[Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers]] and her son by her first marriage, [[Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset]]), and regarded them as power-hungry upstarts ('[[wikt:parvenu|''parvenus'']]'). At the time of Edward's premature death, his heir, [[Edward V of England|Edward V]], was only 12 years old and had been brought up under the stewardship of Earl Rivers at [[Ludlow Castle]].

On his deathbed, Edward had named his surviving brother Richard of Gloucester as Protector of England. Richard had been in the north when Edward died. Hastings, who also held the office of [[Lord Chamberlain]], sent word to him to bring a strong force to London to counter any force the Woodvilles might muster.{{sfn|Rowse|1966|p=186}} The [[Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] also declared his support for Richard.

Richard and Buckingham overtook Earl Rivers, who was escorting the young Edward V to London, at [[Stony Stratford]] in Buckinghamshire on 28 April. Although they dined with Rivers amicably, they took him prisoner the next day, and declared to Edward that they had done so to forestall a conspiracy by the Woodvilles against his life. Rivers and his nephew [[Richard Grey]] were sent to [[Pontefract Castle]] in Yorkshire and executed there at the end of June.

[[File:Princes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Princes in the Tower]], painted by [[John Everett Millais]]]]

Edward entered London in the custody of Richard on 4 May, and was lodged in the Tower of London. Elizabeth Woodville had already gone hastily into sanctuary at Westminster with her remaining children, although preparations were being made for Edward V to be crowned on 22 June, at which point Richard's authority as Protector would end. On 13 June, Richard held a full meeting of the Council, at which he accused Hastings and others of conspiracy against him. Hastings was executed without trial later in the day.

[[Thomas Bourchier (bishop)|Thomas Bourchier]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], then persuaded Elizabeth Woodville to allow her younger son, the 9-year-old [[Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], to join Edward in the Tower. Having secured the boys, [[Robert Stillington]], [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]] then alleged that Edward IV's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville had been illegal and that the two boys were therefore illegitimate. Richard then claimed the crown as [[Richard III of England|King Richard III]]. The two imprisoned boys, known as the "[[Princes in the Tower]]", disappeared and are assumed to have been murdered. There was never a trial or judicial inquest on the matter. [[Perkin Warbeck]] claimed he was the younger of the Princes from 1490 and was recognised as such by Richard's sister, the [[Margaret of York|Duchess of Burgundy.]]

Having been crowned in a lavish ceremony on 6 July, Richard then proceeded on a tour of the Midlands and the north of England, dispensing generous bounties and charters and naming his own son as the Prince of Wales.

==Buckingham's revolt==
{{details|Buckingham's rebellion}}
Opposition to Richard's rule had already begun in the south when, on 18 October, the Duke of Buckingham (who had been instrumental in placing Richard on the throne and who himself had a distant claim to the crown) led a revolt aimed at installing the Lancastrian [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]]. It has been argued that his supporting Tudor rather than either Edward V or his younger brother, showed Buckingham was aware that both were already dead.{{sfn|Rowse|1966|p=199}}

The Lancastrian claim to the throne had descended to Henry Tudor on the death of Henry VI and his son in 1471. Henry's father, [[Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond]], had been a half-brother of Henry VI, but Henry's claim to royalty was through his mother, [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby|Margaret Beaufort]]. She was descended from [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset|John Beaufort]], who was a son of [[John of Gaunt]] and thus a grandson of Edward III. John Beaufort had been illegitimate at birth, though later legitimised by the marriage of his parents. It had supposedly been a condition of the legitimation that the Beaufort descendants forfeited their rights to the crown. Henry had spent much of his childhood under siege in Harlech Castle or in exile in [[Brittany]]. After 1471, Edward IV had preferred to belittle Henry's pretensions to the crown, and made only sporadic attempts to secure him. However his mother, Margaret Beaufort, had been twice remarried, first to Buckingham's uncle, and then to [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby|Thomas, Lord Stanley]], one of Edward's principal officers, and continually promoted her son's rights.

Buckingham's rebellion failed. Some of his supporters in the south rose up prematurely, thus allowing Richard's Lieutenant in the South, the [[John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]], to prevent many rebels from joining forces. Buckingham himself raised a force at [[Brecon]] in [[Mid Wales|mid-Wales]]. He was prevented from crossing the [[River Severn]] to join other rebels in the south of England by storms and floods, which also prevented Henry Tudor landing in the West Country. Buckingham's starving forces deserted and he was betrayed and executed.

The failure of Buckingham's revolt was clearly not the end of the plots against Richard, who could never again feel secure, and who also suffered the loss of his [[Anne Neville|wife]] and eleven-year-old [[Edward of Middleham, Prince of Wales|son]], putting the future of the Yorkist dynasty in doubt.

==Henry VII==
[[File:Henry7England.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]]]
Many of Buckingham's defeated supporters and other disaffected nobles fled to join Henry Tudor in exile. Richard made an attempt to bribe the Duke of Brittany's chief Minister [[Pierre Landais]] to betray Henry, but Henry was warned and escaped to France, where he was again given sanctuary and aid.{{sfn|Rowse|1966|p=212}}

Confident that many magnates and even many of Richard's officers would join him, Henry set sail from [[Harfleur]] on 1 August 1485, with a force of exiles and French mercenaries. With fair winds, he landed in [[Pembrokeshire]] six days later and the officers Richard had appointed in Wales either joined Henry or stood aside. Henry gathered supporters on his march through Wales and the Welsh Marches and defeated Richard at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]]. Richard was slain during the battle, supposedly by the major Welsh landowner [[Rhys ap Thomas]] with a blow to the head from his [[Pollaxe (polearm)|poleaxe]]. Rhys was knighted three days later by Henry VII.

Henry, having been acclaimed King Henry VII, strengthened his position by marrying [[Elizabeth of York]], daughter of Edward IV and the best surviving Yorkist claimant, reuniting the two royal houses. Henry merged the rival symbols of the red rose of Lancaster and the white rose of York into the new emblem of the red and white [[Tudor Rose]]. Henry later shored up his position by executing a number of other claimants, a policy his son [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] continued.

Many historians consider the accession of Henry VII to mark the end of the Wars of the Roses. Others argue that they continued to the end of the fifteenth century, as there were several plots to overthrow Henry and restore Yorkist claimants. Only two years after the Battle of Bosworth, Yorkists rebelled, led by [[John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln]], who had been named by Richard III as his heir but had been reconciled with Henry after Bosworth. The conspirators produced a pretender, a boy named [[Lambert Simnel]], who resembled the young [[Edward, Earl of Warwick]] (son of George of Clarence), the best surviving male claimant of the House of York. The imposture was shaky, because the young earl was still alive and in King Henry's custody and was paraded through London to expose the impersonation. At the [[Battle of Stoke Field]], Henry defeated Lincoln's army. Lincoln died in the battle. Simnel was pardoned for his part in the rebellion and was sent to work in the royal kitchens.

Henry's throne was challenged again in 1491, with the appearance of the pretender [[Perkin Warbeck]], who claimed he was Richard, Duke of York (the younger of the two Princes in the Tower). Warbeck made several attempts to incite revolts, with support at various times from the court of Burgundy and [[James IV of Scotland]]. He was captured after the failed [[Second Cornish Uprising of 1497]] and killed in 1499, after attempting to escape from prison. Warwick was also executed, rendering the male-line of the House of York (and by extension the whole Plantagenet dynasty) extinct.

During the reign of Henry VII's son Henry VIII, the possibility of a Yorkist challenge to the throne remained until as late as 1525, in the persons of [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham]], [[Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk]] and his brother [[Richard de la Pole]], all of whom had blood ties to the Yorkist dynasty but were excluded by the pro-Woodville Tudor settlement. To an extent, England's [[English Reformation|break with Rome]] was prompted by Henry's fears of a disputed succession, should he leave only a female heir to the throne or an infant who would be as vulnerable as Henry VI had been to antagonistic or rapacious regents.

==Aftermath==
Historians debate the extent of impact the wars had on medieval English life. The classical view is that the many casualties among the [[nobility]] continued the changes in feudal English society caused by the effects of the [[Black Death]]. These included a weakening of the [[feudalism|feudal power]] of the nobles and an increase in the power of the merchant classes, and the growth of a centralised monarchy under the Tudors. The wars heralded the end of the medieval period in England and the movement towards the [[Renaissance]]. After the wars the large standing baronial armies that had helped fuel the conflict were suppressed. Henry VII, wary of any further fighting, kept the barons on a very tight leash, removing their right to raise, arm and supply armies of retainers so that they could not make war on each other or the king. The military power of individual barons declined, and the Tudor court became a place where baronial squabbles were decided with the influence of the monarch.

Revisionists, such as the Oxford historian [[K. B. McFarlane]], suggest that the effects of the conflicts have been greatly exaggerated and that there were no wars of the roses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00546sp| title=BBC War of the Roses discussion| work=In our Time Radio 4| date=18 May 2000| accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many places were unaffected by the wars, particularly in the eastern part of England, such as [[East Anglia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Redstone| first=Vincent B.| title=Social Conditions of England during the Wars of the Roses| journal=Royal Historical Society| year=1902| volume=16| issue=1| pages=159–200| doi=10.2307/3678121}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that the traumatic impact of the wars was exaggerated by Henry VII, to magnify his achievement in quelling them and bringing peace. The effect of the wars on the merchant and labouring classes was far less than in the long drawn-out wars of siege and pillage in Europe, which were carried out by mercenaries who profited from long wars. Although there were some lengthy sieges, such as those of [[Harlech Castle]] and [[Bamburgh Castle]], these were in comparatively remote and less populous regions. In the populated areas, both factions had much to lose by the ruin of the country and sought quick resolution of the conflict by [[pitched battle]].{{sfn|Sadler|2011|p=14}} Philippe de Commines observed in 1470:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The realm of England enjoys one favour above all other realms, that neither the countryside nor the people are destroyed, nor are buildings burnt or demolished. Misfortune falls on soldiers and nobles in particular...&lt;ref name=Wise&amp;Embleton4/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Exceptions to this claimed general rule were the Lancastrian looting of [[Ludlow]] after the largely bloodless Yorkist defeat at Ludford Bridge in 1459, and the widespread pillaging carried out by Queen Margaret's unpaid army as it advanced south in early 1461. Both events inspired widespread opposition to the Queen, and support for the Yorkists.

Many areas did little or nothing to change their city defences, perhaps an indication that they were left untouched by the wars. City walls were either left in their ruinous state or only partially rebuilt. In the case of London, the city was able to avoid being devastated by convincing the York and Lancaster armies to stay out after the inability to recreate the defensive city walls.{{sfn|Lander|1980|pp=363–365}}

Few noble houses were extinguished during the wars; in the period from 1425 to 1449, before the outbreak of the wars, there were as many extinctions of noble lines from natural causes (25) as occurred during the fighting (24) from 1450 to 1474.&lt;ref&gt;Terence Wise and G.A. Embleton, ''The Wars of the Roses'', Osprey Men-at-Arms series, p. 4, from K.B. MacFarlane, ''The Nobility of Later Medieval England'', Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The most ambitious nobles died and by the later period of the wars, fewer nobles were prepared to risk their lives and titles in an uncertain struggle.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The kings of France and Scotland and the dukes of Burgundy played the two factions off against each other, pledging military and financial aid and offering asylum to defeated nobles and pretenders, to prevent a strong and unified England from making war on them.

The hinge point in the succession dispute is the forced abdication of Richard II and whether it was lawful or not. Following that event, Richard's legitimate successor would be Henry Bolingbroke if strict Salic inheritance were adhered to, or Anne Mortimer if [[primogeniture|male-preference primogeniture]], which eventually became the standard form of succession (until the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]]), were adhered to.

==Armies and warfare==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
Following defeat in the [[Hundred Years' War]], English landowners complained vociferously about the financial losses resulting from the loss of their continental holdings; this is often considered a contributory cause of the Wars of the Roses.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Bruce. Wars of the Roses. p. 40. [http://www.luminarium.org/encyclopedia/roseswarcauses.htm Luminarium: Encyclopedia Project]: "Every version of the complaints put forward by the rebels in 1450 harps on the losses in France."&lt;/ref&gt; The wars were fought largely by the [[landed property|landed aristocracy]] and armies of feudal retainers, with some mercenaries.

At the end of the Hundred Years' War large numbers of unemployed soldiery returned to England seeking employment in the growing armies of local nobility. England drifted toward misrule and violence under the weak governance as local noble families like the [[House of Neville|Nevilles]] and [[House of Percy|Percies]] increasingly relied on their feudal retainers to settle disputes. It became common practice for landowners to bind their ''mesnie'' knights to their service with annual payments.{{sfn|Sadler|2000| p= 3}}

[[File:Indenture 1723.jpg|thumb|Half of an indenture contract, the randomly cut (or indented) edge proves a match to the counterpart document]]

Edward III had developed the contract system where the monarch entered into formal written contracts called [[indenture]] with experienced captains who were contractually obliged to provide an agreed upon number of men, at established rates for a given period. Frequently the landed nobility acted the principal or main contractor. Knights, men at arms and archers were often sub-contracted.{{sfn|Sadler|2000| p= 3}} A lord could find men amongst his tenantry who included landless men and others who would crave the security of [[Bastard feudalism|maintenance and livery]]. Skilled archers could command as high a wage as knights.{{sfn|Sadler|2000| p= 4}} As baronial armies grew in size, the rule of law was weakened.

Support for each house largely depended upon dynastic factors, such as blood relationships, marriages within the nobility and the grants or confiscations of feudal titles and lands. Given the conflicting loyalties of blood, marriage and ambition, it was not uncommon for nobles to switch sides; several battles (such as [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Northampton]] and [[Battle of Bosworth|Bosworth]]) were decided by treachery.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}. The armies consisted of nobles' contingents of men-at-arms, with companies of archers and foot-soldiers (such as [[Bill (weapon)|billmen]]). There were sometimes contingents of foreign mercenaries, armed with cannon or handguns. The horsemen were generally restricted to "prickers" and "scourers"; i.e. scouting and foraging parties.

Much like their campaigns in France, it was customary for the English gentry to fight entirely on foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ingram|first= Mike |year=2012|title=Bosworth 1485: Battle Story|publisher= The History Press |page= 44|isbn= 978-0-7524-6988-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several cases, noblemen dismounted and fought amongst the common foot-soldiers to both inspire them and due to the fact that, as proven by the experiences of battles on the continent, heavy cavalry is of limited tactical value when both sides possess large numbers of skilled Longbowmen.

It was often claimed that the nobles faced greater risks than the ordinary soldiers as there was little incentive for anyone to take prisoner any high-ranking noble during or immediately after a battle. During the Hundred Years' War against France, a captured noble would be able to ransom himself for a large sum but in the Wars of the Roses, a captured noble who belonged to a defeated faction had a high chance of being executed as a traitor. Forty-two captured knights were executed after the [[Battle of Towton]].{{sfn|Sadler|2011| p=124}} The Burgundian observer [[Philippe de Commines]], who met Edward IV in 1470, reported,

&lt;blockquote&gt;King Edward told me in all the battles which he had won, as soon as he had gained victory, he mounted his horse and shouted to his men that they must spare the common soldiers and kill the lords, of whom none or few escaped.&lt;ref name=Wise&amp;Embleton4&gt;Wise &amp; Embleton, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Even those who escaped execution might be declared ''[[attainder|attainted]]'' therefore possess no property and be of no value to a captor.{{sfn|Sadler|2011| pp= 9, 14–15}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2596">The '''Welsh Sports and Saloon Car Championship''' is organised by the [[British Automobile Racing Club|BARC]] and the Welsh Racing Drivers’ Association, the main venue of the championship being [[Pembrey Circuit|Pembrey]]. 2009 sees the championship travelling to [[Brands Hatch]]. The championship has also raced at Ty Croes in Anglesey, [[Donington Park]], [[Mallory Park]], [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]], [[Mondello Park]], [[Lydden Race Circuit|Lydden Hill]], [[Thruxton Circuit|Thruxton]] and [[Oulton Park]].

==Class structure==

The championship was first awarded in 1991 and has been contested every season since then. The class structure is modified for 2008 as follows: Class A, for road based saloon and sports cars up to 1600cc. Class B is contested by modified, road based saloon and sports cars with engines of up to 2000cc. Class C follows the same rules as Class B, except that it requires engine sizes to be above 2000cc. Finally Class D is for cars conforming to [[Touring car racing]] regulations and re-engined sports cars, such as [[Caterham Cars|Caterhams]]. Points are awarded depending on where the driver finishes in their class (in essence, there are four race winners), with the overall championship being awarded to the driver who has managed to accumulate the most class points, regardless of their overall results in the races.

'''William Leonard Laurence''' (March 7, 1888 – March 19, 1977) was a Jewish [[Lithuania]]n-born American journalist known for his science journalism writing of the 1940s and 1950s while working for ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He won two [[Pulitzer Prize]]s and, as the official historian of the [[Manhattan Project]], was the only journalist to witness the [[Trinity test]] and the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Nagasaki]]. He is credited with coining the iconic term "[[Atomic Age]]" which became popular in the 1950s.

==Biography==
Laurence was born '''Leib Wolf Siew''' in [[Salantai]], a small city in the [[Russian Empire]] that is now in [[Lithuania]]. He emigrated to the United States in 1905, after participating in the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], and he soon changed his name, taking "William" after [[William Shakespeare]], "Leonard" after [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and "Lawrence" after a street he lived on in [[Roxbury, Massachusetts]] (but spelled with a "u" in reference to [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s Laura). He attended [[Harvard University]] (1908&amp;ndash;1911; 1914&amp;ndash;1915), the [[University of Besançon]] (1919) and [[Harvard Law School]] (1921) before receiving his [[LL.B.]] from the [[Boston University School of Law]] in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.marquiswhoswho.com/profile/200010892384&lt;/ref&gt; He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1913. During World War I, he served with the U.S. Army Signal Corps.

In 1926 he began his career as a journalist, working for [[New York World|''The World'' of New York City]]. In 1930 he began working at ''The New York Times'', specializing where possible in reporting on scientific issues. He married Florence Davidow in 1931.

In 1934, Laurence co-founded the [[National Association of Science Writers]], and in 1936 he covered the Harvard Tercenary Conference of Arts and Sciences, work for which he and four other science reporters received the 1937 [[Pulitzer Prize for Reporting]].&lt;ref name=pulitzer&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Reporting "Reporting"].

=="Atomic Bill"==
[[File:New York Times 8-07-1945 Rare City Edition.jpg|thumb|left|275px|A front page copy of ''The New York Times'' city edition dated August 7, 1945 featuring the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima]], [[Japan]].]]
On May 5, 1940, Laurence published a front-page exclusive in the ''New York Times'' on successful attempts in isolating [[uranium-235]] which were reported in ''[[Physical Review]]'', and outlined many (somewhat hyperbolic) claims about the possible future of [[nuclear power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |coauthors= |title=Vast Power Source In Atomic Energy Opened by Science; Report on New Source of Power |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0D16FC3B54117A93C7A9178ED85F448485F9 |quote=A natural substance found abundantly in many parts of the earth, now separated for the first time in pure form, has been found in pioneer experiments at the Physics Department of Columbia University to be capable of yielding such energy that one pound of it is equal ... |work=New York Times |date=May 5, 1940 |accessdate=February 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had assembled it in part out of his own fear that [[Nazi Germany]] was attempting to develop atomic energy, and had hoped the article would galvanize a U.S. effort. Though his article had no effect on the U.S. bomb program, it was passed to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] mineralogist [[Vladimir Vernadsky]] by his son, a professor of history at [[Yale University]], and motivated Vernadsky to urge Soviet authorities to embark on their own atomic program, and established one of the first commissions to formulate "a plan of measures which it would be necessary to realize in connection with the possibility of using intraatomic energy". A [[Soviet atomic bomb project]] got started c. 1942; a full-scale Soviet atomic energy program began after the war.&lt;ref&gt;On this incident, see David Holloway, ''Stalin and the Bomb: The Soviet Union and Atomic Energy, 1939–1956'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994): 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 7, 1940, ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' ran an article by Laurence on atomic fission, "The Atom Gives Up". In 1943, government officials asked librarians nationwide to withdraw the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sweeney |first=Michael S. |title=Secrets of Victory: The Office of Censorship and the American Press and Radio in World War II |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |year=2001 |location=Chapel Hill |isbn=0-8078-2598-0 |pp=196–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1945, Laurence was summoned to the secret [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos laboratory]] in [[New Mexico]] by General [[Leslie Groves]] to serve as the official historian&lt;ref name="evans"/&gt; of the [[Manhattan Project]]. In this capacity he was also the author of many of the first official [[press release]]s about [[nuclear weapon]]s, including some delivered by the Department of War and President [[Harry S. Truman]]. He was the only journalist present at the [[Trinity test]] in July 1945, and beforehand prepared statements to be delivered in case the test ended in a disaster which killed those involved. As part of his work related to the Project, he also interviewed the airmen who flew on the mission to drop the atomic bomb on the city of [[Hiroshima]], Japan. Laurence himself flew aboard the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29]] ''[[The Great Artiste]]'', which served as a blast instrumentation aircraft, for the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Nagasaki]]. He visited the test [[Operation Crossroads#Test Able|Able]] site at [[Bikini Atoll]] aboard the press ship ''Appalachian'', for the bomb test on July 1, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;According to this source, "[Laurence] had the unique distinction of riding in the bomber that carried out the Nagasaki mission." See ''Operation Crossroads: The Official Pictorial Record'', the Office of the Historian Joint Task Force One (New York: Wm. H. Wise &amp; Co., 1946): 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

For his 1945 coverage of the atomic bomb, beginning with the eyewitness account from Nagasaki, he won a second [[Pulitzer Prize for Reporting]] in 1946.&lt;ref name=pulitzer/&gt; At the office of the ''Times'' he was thereafter referred to as "Atomic Bill", to differentiate him from William H. Lawrence, a political reporter at the newspaper.

In his autobiography, [[Richard Feynman]] mentioned William Laurence standing next to him during the Trinity test. Feynman stated, "I had been the one who was supposed to have taken him around. Then it was found that it was too technical for him, and so later [[Henry DeWolf Smyth|H.D. Smyth]] came and I showed him around."&lt;ref&gt;''Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman'' (W.W. Norton and company, New York, 1997. p. 135)&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear historian Alex Wellerstein has called Laurence "part huckster, part journalist, all wild card ... improbable in every way, a real-life character with more strangeness than would seem tolerable in pure fiction." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wolverton |first=Mark |title='Atomic Bill' and the Birth of the Bomb |date=August 9, 2017 |newspaper=Undark Magazine |url=https://undark.org/article/atomic-bill-laurence-manhattan-project/ |archive-url=https://undark.org/article/atomic-bill-laurence-manhattan-project/ |archive-date=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, he published an account of the Trinity test as ''Dawn Over Zero'', which went through at least two revisions. He continued to work at the ''Times'' through the 1940s and into the 1950s, and published a book on defense against nuclear war in 1950. In 1951, his book ''The Hell Bomb'' warned about the use of a [[cobalt bomb]] – a form of hydrogen bomb (still an untested device at the time he wrote it) engineered to produce a maximum amount of [[nuclear fallout]].

In 1956, he was present at the testing of a [[hydrogen bomb]] at the [[Pacific Proving Grounds]]. That same year, he also became appointed Science Editor of the ''New York Times'', succeeding [[Waldemar Kaempffert]]. He served in this capacity until he retired in 1964.

During his later career, he received honorary doctorates from [[Boston University]] ([[Doctor of Science|Sc.D.]], 1946), the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] (Sc.D., 1951), [[Grinnell College]] ([[Doctor of humane letters|D.H.L.]], 1951) and [[Yeshiva University]] (D.H.L., 1957).&lt;ref&gt;http://search.marquiswhoswho.com/profile/200010892384&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Laurence died in 1977 in [[Majorca]], Spain, of complications from a [[blood clot]] in his brain.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |coauthors= |title=William Laurence, Ex-Science Writer For The Times, Dies |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0F17FB3C5F137B93CBA81788D85F438785F9 |quote=William L. Laurence, a science reporter who was the only journalist to witness the historic nuclear blast at Alamogordo, N.M., in 1945 and later the only newspaperman permitted to fly on the atomic bomb mission over Nagasaki, Japan, died here today of complications from a blood clot in the brain. He was 89 years old. |work=New York Times |date=March 19, 1977 |accessdate=May 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Call for revocation of 1946 Pulitzer Prize==
In 2004, journalists [[Amy Goodman]] and David Goodman called for the Pulitzer Board to strip Laurence and his paper, ''The New York Times'', of his 1946 Pulitzer Prize.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amy Goodman]] and David Goodman. [http://www.hyperionbooks.com/titlepage.asp?ISBN=140130799X&amp;SUBJECT=Current%20Events "The Exception to the Rulers: Exposing Oily Politicians, War Profiteers, and the Media that Love Them".] [http://www.hyperionbooks.com Hyperion], 2004, pp. 296–298.&lt;/ref&gt; The journalists argued that at the time Laurence "was also on the payroll of War Department"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Groves|first=Leslie R.|title=Now it can be told: the story of the Manhattan Project|year=1983|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-306-80189-1|edition=[New ed.]|quote= It seemed desirable for security reasons, as well as easier for the employer, to have Laurence continue on the payroll of the ''New York Times'', but with his expenses covered by the MED}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that, after the atomic bombings, he "had a front-page story in the ''Times''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Laurence|first=William L.|title=U.S. Atom Bomb Site Belies Tokyo Tales: Tests on New Mexico Range Confirm That Blast, and Not Radiation, Took Toll|url=http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/science/20071030_MANHATTAN_GRAPHIC/sept12_1945.pdf|accessdate=March 18, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 12, 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; disputing the notion that [[radiation sickness]] was [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki#Post-attack casualties|killing people]]."&lt;ref name="evans"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Harold|title=War stories: reporting in the time of conflict|year=2003|publisher=Bunker Hill|location=Hawkhurst|isbn=978-1-59373-005-5|quote=During the development of the atomic bomb, project director Gen. Leslie Groves secretly hired William L. Laurence, a highly respected science reporter with The New York Times, to act as the project's official historian. Laurence eagerly accepted the job – his scientific curiosity and patriotic zeal perhaps blinding him to the notion that he was at the same time compromising his journalistic independence. After the bombing, the brilliant but bullying Groves continually suppressed or distorted the effects of radiation. He dismissed reports of Japanese deaths as 'hoax or propaganda.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that "his faithful parroting of the government line was crucial in launching a half-century of silence about the deadly lingering [[Effects of nuclear explosions on human health|effects of the bomb]]".&lt;ref&gt;William L. Laurence. ''Dawn Over Zero: The story of the atomic bomb''. New York: [[Alfred A. Knopf]], 1946, p. 224. Quote: "mine has been the honor, unique in the history of journalism, of preparing the War Department's official press release for worldwide distribution".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amy Goodman and David Goodman, [http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0810-01.htm "The Hiroshima Cover-Up: How the War Department's Times man Won a Pulitzer"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 1995 book ''Hiroshima in America: Fifty Years of Denial'', Robert Jay Lifton and Greg Mitchell assert, "Here was the nation's leading science reporter, severely compromised, not only unable but disinclined to reveal all he knew about the potential hazards of the most important scientific discovery of his time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Robert Jay Lifton &amp; Greg|title=Hiroshima in America: fifty years of denial |year=1995|publisher=Putnam|location=New York|isbn=978-0-399-14072-3}}, quoted by Goodman, Amy and Goodman, David, "Hiroshima Cover-up: How the War Department's Times man Won a Pulitzer", [http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0810-01.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11164">The '''World Congress of Philosophy''' (originally known as the '''International Congress of Philosophy''') is a global meeting of philosophers held every five years under the auspices of the [[International Federation of Philosophical Societies]] (FISP). First organized in 1900, these events became firmly established after the Second World War. Each World Congress is sponsored by one of the member societies in a different country, which assumes responsibility for the organization of that Congress. The purpose of these events is to contribute to the development of professional relations between philosophers of all countries, promote [[philosophy education|philosophical education]], and contribute to the impact of philosophical knowledge on global problems. The 24th World Congress of Philosophy was held in [[Beijing]] in August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fisp.org FISP web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first International Congress of Philosophy was held in [[Paris]] in 1900 on the occasion of the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Universal Exhibition]]. Among the participants were [[Henri Bergson]], [[Maurice Blondel]], [[Moritz Cantor]], [[Louis Couturat]], [[Henri Poincaré]], and [[Bertrand Russell]]. The second International Congress took place in [[Geneva]] in 1904; the third was held in Heidelberg in 1908 (with [[Josiah Royce]], [[Wilhelm Windelband]] and [[Benedetto Croce]]). The First World War interrupted the sequence of these events after the 4th International Congress in [[Bologna]] in 1911.

Thereafter these congresses were held in [[Naples]] (1924), Cambridge, USA (1926), Oxford, UK (1930), [[Prague]] (1934), and [[Paris]] (1937). The next International Congress of Philosophy was held in 1948, and these events have been held every five years under FISP sponsorship ever since. Recent congresses have taken place in [[Brighton]] (1988), [[Moscow]] (1993), [[Boston]] (1988), [[Istanbul]] (2003), [[Seoul]] (2008), and [[Athens]] (2013). The event became known as the World Congress of Philosophy in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pdcnet.org/wcp World Congress of Philosophy Collection], accessed 16 January 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zacarias Moussaoui''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: زكريا موسوي, ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Zakariyyā Mūsawī}}''; born May 30, 1968) is a [[France|French]] citizen who pleaded guilty in [[U.S. federal court]] to conspiring to kill citizens of the [[United States]] as part of the [[September 11 attacks]]. As a result of his conviction, he is serving six life sentences without parole at the [[ADX Florence|Federal ADX]] [[Supermax prison]] in [[Florence, Colorado]].

==Overview==
On August 16, 2001, Moussaoui was arrested in Minnesota by the FBI and charged with an immigration violation. He aroused suspicion while taking flight training courses in [[Eagan, Minnesota]].

On December 11, 2001, Moussaoui was indicted by a federal grand jury in [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]] on six felony charges: conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries, conspiracy to commit aircraft piracy, conspiracy to destroy aircraft, conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction, conspiracy to murder United States employees, and conspiracy to destroy property.

Moussaoui was alleged by federal prosecutors to have been a replacement for the "first" [[20th hijacker]], possibly [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]]. Bin al-Shibh and [[Zakariyah Essabar]] were denied [[visa (document)|visas]]. However, prosecutors in Moussaoui's drawn-out trial in the US had difficulty directly connecting him to the 19 participants.

Moussaoui's trial was seen in some circles as a barometer of the ability and willingness of the United States to give a fair hearing to terrorism suspects. Others objected to the degree to which the court and especially Judge [[Leonie Brinkema]] tolerated the bizarre and threatening courtroom behavior of Moussaoui.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2006-02-14/&gt;  Moussaoui expressed contempt for the trial and court by introducing [[legal motion]]s deriding Judge Brinkema, surprised onlookers by electing to represent himself in court, and rankled [[United States federal government|federal]] prosecutors by requesting the presence of captured [[al-Qaeda]] members as witnesses in his case.

During the trial, Moussaoui initially stated that he was not involved in the September 11 attacks, but that he was planning an attack of his own. Some al-Qaeda members reportedly corroborated Moussaoui's statement to an extent, saying that he was involved in a plot other than September 11, but prosecutors believed that his story had no merit. On April 3, 2006, Moussaoui was found to be eligible for the [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]]. Before leaving the courtroom, he was reported to have shouted, "You will never get my blood. God curse you all!"&lt;ref&gt;Hirschkorn, Phil. [http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/04/03/moussaoui.verdict Moussaoui eligible for death penalty.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032847/http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/04/03/moussaoui.verdict |date=March 4, 2016 }} ''[[CNN]]'' (2006-04-05)&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month he withdrew his qualifications and again admitted guilt on all charges levied by the prosecution.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

On May 3, 2006, a jury decided against the death penalty for Moussaoui. The next day, he was sentenced to life in prison without parole. As he was led out of the courtroom, Moussaoui clapped his hands and said, "America, you lost ... I won."&lt;ref name="Sniffen"&gt;Sniffen, Michael J.

Following sentencing, Moussaoui recanted his trial testimony stating he was not a member of the September 11, 2001, conspiracy, but "part of another al-Qaeda plot which was to occur after September 11."&lt;ref name="Withdraw"&gt;[http://files.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/moussaoui/mouss50806mot.pdf The United States of America v.

==Personal history==

===Childhood===
Aicha el-Wafi, Moussaoui's mother, was 14 when she was married to a man that she did not previously know,&lt;ref&gt;The Independent, 8 September 2011, '' 'I Love My Son More Than Ever..' The 9/11 Terrorist's Mother Who Won't Give Up'' p, 26-27 {{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/i-love-my-son-more-than-ever-911-terrorists-mother-who-wont-give-up-2350965.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304095336/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/i-love-my-son-more-than-ever-911-terrorists-mother-who-wont-give-up-2350965.html |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Helen. [http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/399576p-338493c.html Terrorist's mom gets hug.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523055930/http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/399576p-338493c.html |date=May 23, 2006 }} ''New York Daily News'' (2006-03-14).&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, Moussaoui's parents moved to France, where he was born. After enduring [[domestic violence]], his mother left his father Omar while her four children were still young.&lt;ref name=DOMESTIC/&gt; She raised her children on a cleaner's wages. There was no religious education within the family. Witnesses testified at Moussaui's trial that, as first-generation immigrants from [[Morocco]], the family frequently faced [[racism]] in their new country.&lt;ref name="Sniffen"/&gt; From 1982, Moussaoui, his brother and sisters, were brought up in a bungalow on the  edge of the town of [[Narbonne]]. His mother has said that she believes two 'wounding' incidents in his French adolescence contributed to the formation of an extremist sensibility: the first the day that his school careers adviser pushed him towards minor, technical studies, with "the clear implication that he was only an Arab and would need nothing more," and the second the day that the father of his teenage sweetheart warned him off because he was an Arab. "Don't think that you will ever get your feet under my table," the man said. "&lt;ref&gt;The Independent,  8 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his brother, Abd Samad Moussaoui, Zacarias loved to play [[team handball|handball]]:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/september11/story/0,11209,939701,00.html My Brother Zac.]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''The Guardian Unlimited'' (2003-04-19).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For Zacarias [his brother wrote in ''the Guardian''], handball quickly became more than a sport—it was his passion. He was brilliant. Everyone recognized it—his trainers, his team-mates, even his opponents. For Zacarias, the future was all mapped out. He would study and play sports.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Militant training===
Moussaoui has been known by other names, reportedly including '''Abu Khaled al Sahrawi''' and '''Shaquil''' while he was in Oklahoma.&lt;ref name="Oklahoma"&gt;Hirschkorn, Phil and Deborah Feyerick.

French authorities began monitoring Moussaoui in 1996 when they observed him with Islamic extremists in London. In 1998, he attended the [[Khalden training camp]] in Afghanistan, allegedly returning the next year as well. In September 2000, he visited [[Malaysia]] and stayed in a condominium owned by [[Yazid Sufaat]] who, in October 2000, signed letters identifying Moussaoui as a representative of his company. Two of the September 11 hijackers lived in the same condominium in January 2000. [[Jemaah Islamiah]] leader [[Riduan Ismauddin]] sent cohort [[Yazid Sufaat]] to provide Moussaoui with $35,000 USD and travel documents in Malaysia in October.

===Flight training===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MN00624A.jpg|thumb|Moussaoui's [[International Student Identity Card]].]]  --&gt;From February 26 to May 29, 2001, Moussaoui attended flight training courses at [[Airman Flight School]] in [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]], Oklahoma. Despite 57 hours of flying lessons, he failed and left without ever having flown solo. This school was visited by [[Mohamed Atta]] and [[Marwan al-Shehhi]], who piloted planes into the north and south towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]].

During his time in Norman, Moussaoui had a roommate named Hussein al-Attas. On August 11, 2001, Hussein al-Attas drove Moussaoui to Minnesota from Oklahoma.&lt;ref name="paradise"&gt;Hirschkorn, Phil. [http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/03/21/moussaoui.trial/index.html Roommate: Moussaoui saw jihad as way to paradise.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180409/http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/03/21/moussaoui.trial/index.html |date=March 3, 2016 }} ''CNN'' (2006-03-21).&lt;/ref&gt; Hussein al-Attas said that he and Moussaoui planned to take a trip to New York City in late August/early September 2001. In 2002, al-Attas admitted that he lied to the FBI to conceal Moussaoui's name, lied to the inquisitive FBI to conceal Moussaoui's extremist jihadi and anti-American beliefs, lied to conceal his own tendencies, lied to conceal that Moussaoui had been trying to convince him to become more active in the jihad or struggle, and lied to conceal the names of other Middle Easterners who were taking flight lessons in Oklahoma.&lt;ref name="Oklahoma"/&gt;

Moussaoui allegedly received US$14,000 in wire transfers from bin al-Shibh, originating from [[Düsseldorf]] and [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]], in early August. This money could have helped him pay for flight training about two weeks later at Pan-Am International Flight Academy in [[Eagan, Minnesota|Eagan]], Minnesota. On August 13, Moussaoui paid US$6,800 with US$100 bills to receive training in a [[747-400]] [[flight simulator|simulator]]. The simulator that [[Pan-Am]] uses is operated by Northwest Aerospace Training Corporation (NATCO), a training facility affiliated with [[Northwest Airlines]]. Moussaoui was reportedly considered as a replacement for [[Ziad Jarrah]], who at one point threatened to withdraw from the scheme because of tensions amongst the plotters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Eggen |title=Questions Linger on Moussaoui's Role in 9/11 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A10300-2005Apr22.html |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2005-04-23 |accessdate=2008-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans to include Moussaoui were never completed because the al-Qaeda hierarchy allegedly had doubts about his reliability.

[[Clarence Prevost]], the flight instructor assigned to Moussaoui, began to have suspicions about his student. His behavior largely resembled that of other seemingly wealthy men who had come to the center in the past to receive jumbo jet training despite the fact that they'd probably never use it, but some characteristics were unusual. Prevost said later that in pre-simulator instruction, Moussaoui would ask questions that had the right [[jargon]] but were otherwise nonsensical. Moussaoui read through the 747 training manuals, but had a lack of understanding of the plane's systems. Prevost was confused as to why Moussaoui would seek simulator time if he lacked basic plane knowledge. After some convincing, his supervisors contacted the [[FBI]], who came to meet with him. (Despite later reports, Moussaoui did not skip the training for takeoff and landing).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/01/24/moussaoui.reward/index.html?eref=rss_topstories Flight instructor gets $5 million for catching terror suspect] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304043117/http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/01/24/moussaoui.reward/index.html?eref=rss_topstories |date=March 4, 2016 }} ''CNN'' (2008-01-25)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capture===
{{Wikisource|FBI eMails concerning Moussaoui}}
On August 16, 2001, Moussaoui was arrested by [[Harry Samit]] of the [[FBI]] and [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]] agents in [[Minnesota]] and charged with an immigration violation.&lt;ref name="StatementOfFacts"&gt;{{cite web |year=2007|url = http://i.a.cnn.net/cnn/2005/images/04/22/moussaoui.statement.pdf|title = UNITED STATES OF AMERICA vs ZACARIAS MOUSSAOUI&amp;nbsp;— Criminal No. 01-455-A|format = PDF|publisher = [[CNN News]]| accessdate = 2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Materials itemized when he was arrested included a laptop computer, two knives, flight manuals pertaining to Boeing's 747 aircraft, a flight simulator computer program, fighting gloves and shin guards, and a computer disk with information about [[crop dusting]].&lt;ref name="StatementOfFacts"/&gt;

Some agents worried that his flight training had violent intentions, so the Minnesota bureau tried to get permission (sending over 70 emails in a week) to search his laptop, but they were turned down.&lt;ref name="damning"/&gt; FBI agent [[Coleen Rowley]] made an explicit request for permission to search Moussaoui's personal rooms. This request was first denied by her superior, Deputy General Counsel Marion "Spike" Bowman, and later rejected based upon [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|FISA]] regulations (amended after 9/11 by the [[USA Patriot Act]]). Several further search attempts similarly failed.

[[Ahmed Ressam]], the captured [[al-Qaeda]] Millennium Bomber, was at the time sharing information with the US authorities, in an effort to gain leniency in his sentencing.  One person whom he was not asked about until after 9/11, but whom he was able to identify when asked as having trained with him at al-Qaeda's [[Khalden Camp]] in Afghanistan, was Moussaoui.&lt;ref name="a911"&gt;{{cite book|last= National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States |title=The 9/11 Commission report: final report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States|publisher=W.

==Court proceedings==
On December 11, 2001, Moussaoui was [[indictment|indicted]] by a federal [[grand jury]] in [[United States District Court]] for the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia|Eastern District of Virginia]] on six felony charges: conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries, conspiracy to commit aircraft piracy, conspiracy to destroy aircraft, conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction, conspiracy to murder United States employees, and conspiracy to destroy property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/moussaouiindictment.htm UNITED STATES OF AMERICA v. ZACARIAS MOUSSAOUI - Indictment.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715180259/http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/moussaouiindictment.htm |date=July 15, 2009 }} United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia Alexandria Division, United States Department of Justice, December 2001. Retrieved on 2007-01-03.&lt;/ref&gt; The indictment of Zacarias Moussaoui named as unindicted co-conspirators Ramzi Bin al-Shibh and Mustafa al-Hawsawi, among others, for their role in the attack "to murder thousands of innocent people in [[New York City|New York]], [[Virginia]] and [[Pennsylvania]]."

On January 2, 2002, Moussaoui refused to enter any plea to the charges and so Judge Leonie Brinkema entered pleas of not guilty. A hearing was held on April 22, 2002, to determine his right to self-representation, for by then Moussaoui had declined the assistance of his court-appointed attorneys, and asked to defend himself. At another hearing on June 13, 2002, Brinkema deemed him competent to defend himself and allowed the case to move forward. However, Moussaoui later requested the occasional assistance of attorneys to help him with technical issues.

Moussaoui admitted his involvement with al-Qaeda, but claimed he was not involved in the 9/11 attacks. Rather, he claimed that he was preparing for a separate attack. [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] had earlier told investigators that Moussaoui met with him prior to September 11, but that he, Mohammed, chose not to use him. No evidence directly linking Moussaoui to the 9/11 attacks has yet been released.

The trial highlighted a tension in the United States between the [[judicial branch|judiciary]] and [[national security]]. Moussaoui made requests for access to confidential documents and the right to call captive al-Qaeda members as witnesses, notably bin al-Shibh, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and [[Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi]]. Both requests were claimed by prosecutors to be potential threats to national security. Brinkema denied the motion to access confidential documents, although Moussaoui was permitted to use several al-Qaeda prisoners as witnesses.

Brinkema put the death penalty "off limits" on October 2, 2003, in reply to government defiance of her order to provide access to Moussaoui's witnesses. The [[Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals]] reversed the Brinkema ruling, holding that the U.S. government could use summaries of interviews/interrogations of these witnesses. On March 21, 2005, the [[United States Supreme Court]], without comment, declined to hear Moussaoui's pre-trial [[appeal]] of the Fourth Circuit's decision, returning the case to Brinkema.

On April 22, 2005, in one of the court sessions near the end of that phase of the proceedings, Moussaoui surprised the whole court{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} by pleading guilty to all charges, while at the same time denying having any intention to produce a massacre like 9/11. He said that it was not his conspiracy, and that he intended to free Sheikh [[Omar Abdel-Rahman]]. According to Moussaoui, his master plan was to hijack a [[Boeing]] [[747-400]], since the plane is one of a few that could reach [[Afghanistan]] from the U.S. without any intermediate stops.

On February 6, 2006, Moussaoui shouted "I am al-Qaeda. They do not represent me; they are Americans," referring to his attorneys while being escorted from the courtroom in front of 120 potential [[jury|jurors]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/02/06/moussaoui.trial/index.html Moussaoui: 'I am al Qaeda'.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227001616/http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/02/06/moussaoui.trial/index.html |date=December 27, 2016 }} ''CNN'' (2006-02-06).&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 2006, Moussaoui testified that he and "shoe bomber" Richard Reid had planned to crash a hijacked airplane into the [[White House]] in the September 11 attacks. No direct connection between Moussaoui and Reid had ever before been alleged, and this testimony contradicted earlier testimony by Moussaoui that he had been intended for an operation after September 11. When asked why he had previously lied, he stated that "You're allowed to lie for jihad. You're allowed any technique to defeat your enemy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4850988.stm Moussaoui lies 'let 9/11 happen'.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314041855/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4850988.stm |date=March 14, 2007 }} ''[[BBC News]]'' (2006-03-27.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hirschkorn, Phil.

===Court statements===
Moussaoui refused legal representation for years; he entered confusing, insulting, and parallel court pleadings. His pleadings, statements, and behavior included the following:

He then prayed to Allah for the return of [[Al-Andalus]] ([[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]) and the deliverance of [[Ceuta]], [[Melilla]], [[India]] and [[Kashmir]] to the Muslims. He also prayed for the destruction of several nations—including [[Israel]] (and the [[Jew|Jewish people]] as a whole), [[Russia]], [[Canada]], [[UK]], [[Australia]], and the [[United States|U.S.]]—and for the liberation of [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Chechnya]], and [[Afghanistan]]. The Court ordered a psychiatric evaluation in response.

{{quote|
10. During the plea colloquy I made it clear to the Court that I did not have knowledge of and was not a member of the plot to hijack and crash planes into buildings in September 11, 2001 but that I was part of another Al-Qaeda plot which was to occur after September 11, 2001.

11. My court appointed attorneys kept telling me that I should not testify and I thought that they would prevent me from testifying, so I decided to ask the government to let me testify as their witness.

12. It is my recollection that when the judge addressed the jury before my trial began, she informed the jury that I was part of the September 11 plot which further confirmed my distrust of the American justice system and further convinced me to testify since I was going to be given death for the September 11 plot anyway.

13. I decided to testify that I had knowledge of and was a member of the plot to hijack planes and crash them into buildings on September 11, 2001, even though I knew that was a complete fabrication.

14. I have never met Mohammed Atta and, while I may have seen a few of the other hijackers at the guesthouse, I never knew them or anything about their operation.

15. As I stated during my plea colloquy, I was in the United States as a member of Al-Qaeda but was involved in a separate operation ...

18. Because I now see that it is possible that I can receive a fair trial even with Americans as jurors and that I can have the opportunity to prove that I did not have any knowledge of and was not a member of the plot to hijack planes and crash them into buildings on September 11, 2001, I wish to withdraw my guilty plea and ask the Court for a new trial to prove my innocence of the September 11 plot.}}

===Trial and sentencing===
Moussaoui, charged with conspiring to hijack planes and crash them into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, was in jail in Minnesota when the Sept. 11 attacks unfolded. In seeking a death sentence, prosecutors were required to prove that he "intentionally participated in an act ... and the victim died as a direct result of the act." Moussaoui admitted he knew about the attacks and did nothing to stop them.

Having entered a guilty plea, Moussaoui was eligible for the [[death penalty]]. Germany said it would not release evidence against Moussaoui unless the U.S. promised not to seek death as punishment. On April 27, 2005, French Justice Minister [[Dominique Perben]] said, "When France gave elements of information about Mr Moussaoui to the American justice, I obtained a written engagement of the United States not to use these elements to require or execute the death penalty."&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Kacem, Abdel. [http://fides.ifrance.com/fides/html/mousaou1.html Le deal de la France avec Washington.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713222914/http://fides.ifrance.com/fides/html/mousaou1.html |date=July 13, 2006 }} ''Fidès Journal'' (Nov 29, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 14, 2006, Brinkema ruled that the prosecution could continue to seek the death penalty against Moussaoui, but could not use key witnesses coached by government lawyer [[Carla Martin]]. On April 3, 2006, the jury in his case decided that Moussaoui was eligible for the death penalty.

At Moussaoui's sentencing trial, FBI agent Greg Jones testified that prior to the attacks, he urged his supervisor, Michael Maltbie, "to prevent Zacarias Moussaoui from flying a plane into the World Trade Center." Maltbie had refused to act on 70 requests from another agent, Harry Samit, to obtain a warrant to search Moussaoui's computer.&lt;ref name="damning"&gt;Markon, Jerry and Timothy Dwyer.

On May 3, 2006, the jury reached a verdict: that Moussaoui be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Moussaoui was sentenced to six consecutive life terms on May 4,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12615601 Moussaoui formally sentenced, still defiant.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020150510/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12615601 |date=October 20, 2012 }} MSNBC (May 4, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; as Judge Brinkema expressed her belief that the sentence was an appropriate one, inasmuch as it would deprive Moussaoui of "[[martyr]]dom in a great big bang of glory" and of the "chance to speak again", after Moussaoui entered the courtroom proclaiming his victory and asserting that the United States would "never get Osama bin Laden". As he was leaving the courtroom he said, "America, you lost and I won." And he clapped his hands twice. A single juror saved Moussaoui from death. The foreman of the 12-person federal jury told ''The Washington Post'' that the panel voted 11–1, 10–2 and 10–2 in favor of the death penalty on the three charges for which Moussaoui was eligible for execution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080516064603/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/11/AR2006051101884.html One Juror Between Terrorist And Death]. ''Washington Post'' (May 12, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; A unanimous vote on any one of the three terrorism charges was required to return a death sentence.

On May 8, 2006, Moussaoui filed papers with the federal court in Alexandria, Virginia requesting to withdraw his guilty plea, stating that his earlier claim of participation in the September 11 plot was a "complete fabrication." He said that he was "extremely surprised" that he was not sentenced to death. "I now see that it is possible that I can receive a fair trial even with Americans as jurors," he said.&lt;ref name="surprised"&gt;Asseo, Laurie.

Brinkema said that she could no longer trust the CIA and other government agencies on how they represent classified evidence in cases regarding terrorism after Moussaoui case prosecutors admitted that the CIA had assured her that no videotapes or audiotapes existed of interrogations of certain high-profile terrorism detainees, but later, in a letter made public November 13, two such videotapes and one audio tape were made known.{{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071120/ap_on_re_us/terror_paintball Moussaoui judge questions government].

===Osama bin Laden's alleged response===
On May 23, 2006, an audio recording attributed to [[Osama bin Laden]] said in translation that Moussaoui "had no connection at all with September 11 ... I am the one in charge of the 19 brothers and I never assigned brother Zacarias to be with them in that mission ... Since Zacarias Moussaoui was still learning to fly, he wasn't number 20 in the group, as your government claimed". The voice alleged to be bin Laden also suggested that Moussaoui's confession was "void" as it was a result of pressures applied during his incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/12938808/ Bin Laden tape: Bin Laden: Moussaoui Not Linked to 9/11.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304033800/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/12938808/ |date=March 4, 2016 }} ''Associated Press'' (2006-05-24)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,196682,00.html Bin Laden: Moussaoui Wasn't Sept. 11 Conspirator.]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218011634/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C196682%2C00.html |date=February 18, 2013 }} ''Fox News'' (2006-05-24).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil action 2015===
Civil action is being taken by relatives of [[September 11 attacks]] victims, insurers and others against the [[Saudi Arabia]]n government. In the course of this Zacarias Moussaoui has stated on oath and wrote to Judge [[George B. Daniels]] that Saudi royal family members helped finance the September 11 attacks and [[al-Qaeda]]. Prince [[Turki bin Faisal Al Saud]], Prince [[Bandar Bin Sultan]] and Prince [[Al-Waleed bin Talal]], of the Saudi royal family were specifically mentioned as Al-Qaeda donors—but the project's major patrons was Prince [[Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]], who in January 2015 became Saudi Arabia's king.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2015-02-04 /&gt; Moussaoui's testimony provides new details of the extent and nature of that support in the pre-9/11 period. Judge Leonie M. Brinkema declared "Moussaoui is completely competent", called him "an extremely intelligent man" and added: "He has actually a better understanding of the legal system than some lawyers I've seen in court".&lt;ref name=NYTimes2015-02-03 /&gt;

The former Senators [[Bob Graham]] of Florida and [[Bob Kerrey]] of Nebraska and the former Navy secretary [[John Lehman]] believe the Saudi role in the 9/11 plot has never been adequately examined and they demand the release of 28 pages of the [[Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities before and after the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001|congressional report]] that explored Saudi connections and remain classified.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2015-02-04b /&gt; Both the administrations of [[George W. Bush]] and [[Barack Obama]] have refused to declassify the 28 pages on grounds of "national security", but as Graham argues the opposite is true the real "threat to national security is non-disclosure": The Saudis know what they did and the U.S. knows what they did, and when the U.S. government takes a position of passivity, or actively shuts down inquiry, that sends a message to the Saudis. "They have continued, maybe accelerated their support for the most extreme form of Islam known as [[Wahhabism]]" he stated, arguing that both [[al Qaeda]] and [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] are "a creation of Saudi Arabia." On January 7, 2015, Graham, [[United States House of Representatives|Congressmen]] [[Walter B. Jones, Jr.|Walter Jones]] and [[Stephen F. Lynch]], and members of the 9/11 families including Terry Strada, national co-chair of the ″9/11 Families and Survivors United for Justice Against Terrorism″ held a press conference on Capitol Hill announcing the reintroduction of the resolution calling for the declassification of the 28 pages. Graham said that those pages "point a very strong finger at Saudi Arabia as the principal financier" of the 9/11 hijackers: "This may seem stale to some but it's as current as the headlines we see today," referring to the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|terrorist attack]] on a satirical newspaper [[Charlie Hebdo]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Jason Burke: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/04/zacarias-moussaoui-al-qaida-backed-by-saudi-arabia "Zacarias Moussaoui says al-Qaida was backed by Saudi Arabia.

==Reward==
On January 24, 2008, Clarence Prevost, the flight instructor who led authorities to Moussaoui, received a $5 million reward from the U.S. government. The payment was questioned by agent [[Coleen Rowley]] and Senators [[Amy Klobuchar]] and [[Norm Coleman]], among others, on the basis that two other flight instructors had made the initial calls to the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/106275 Dialing For Dollars] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625221004/http://www.newsweek.com/id/106275 |date=June 25, 2009 }}, ''[[Newsweek]]'', Jan 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Those suspicions burst out in the open again this week with the disclosure of a prison deposition of a former Qaeda operative, Zacarias Moussaoui, who claimed that more than a dozen prominent Saudi figures were donors to the terror group and that a Saudi diplomat in Washington discussed with him a plot to shoot down Air Force One.
