      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26248">[[Julia Kristeva|Julia Kristeva’s]] theory of [[abjection]] produces many implications that cause us to think about how we position ourselves between the land of the living and the land of the dead. Kristeva posits that women are abjected as they represent a “suffocating return to the archaic maternal body”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy and the Maternal Body|last=Boulous Walker|first=Michelle|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=1998|isbn=|location=London|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or more specifically, the return to immanence (death). In [[modernity]], the use of the abjected maternal or feminine body is utilised in popular culture to elicit horror from audiences. This, sometimes inadvertently, subverts the [[patriarchy]]’s grip on society and brings to light the oppression of women.{{REMOVE THIS TEMPLATE WHEN CLOSING THIS AfD}}
== Music ==

=== Lady Gaga ===
During the course of her ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]'' album cycle, [[Lady Gaga]] harnessed the abject in order to bring the repressed maternal to the forefront of her performances. In her ''[[Born This Way Ball]]'' world tour, Gaga commenced the concert by being birthed out of a large inflatable vagina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/lady-gaga-enters-through-giant-1547850|title=Lady Gaga shocks fans by climbing out of a giant inflatable vagina for her Born This Way Ball|last=Robertson|first=James|date=January 21, 2013|website=Mirror|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was met by considerable audience disgust, as it threatened the breakdown of our reality, and our distinction between subject and object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critical Theory: The Key Concepts|last=Felluga|first=Dino|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=|location=New York|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her infamous [[Born This Way (song)|''Born This Way'' video]], Gaga created a new religious scripture in which the mother is the almighty god. In this video, Gaga discusses the birth of a new race under ‘Mother Monster’, as the “wombs numbered and the mitosis of the future began”, she exclaims that this moment of birth is not temporal, but eternal. Upon its release, this video was scalded for relying on shock tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/31300/1/a-look-back-at-lady-gaga-s-misunderstood-masterpiece|title=A look back at Lady Gaga's misunderstood masterpiece|last=Hall|first=Jake|date=May 30, 2016|website=Dazed|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reaction is perhaps unsurprising due to the way Gaga used the abjected site of the maternal in order to challenge our evolutionary instinct to reject death. Gaga consistently uses the abject to shock audiences and bring attention to the oppression of women in modernity. In 2014, Gaga performed at [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] (South by Southwest) and included in this performance her song titled [[Swine (song)|Swine]], a song about sexual assault against women. For this performance Gaga brought performance artist [[Millie Brown (performance artist)|Millie Brown]] to the stage, whom of which began to vomit green paint over Gaga’s body while she played the drums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/lady-gaga-stages-dramatic-performance-art-spectacle-at-sxsw-197152/.|title=Lady Gaga Stages Dramatic Performance-Art Spectacle at SXSW|last=Edwards|first=Gavin|date=March 14, 2014|website=Rolling Stone|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;Using the abject materials of oral disgust and waste&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Female Body in Western Culture: Contemporary Perspectives|last=Kristeva|first=Julia|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; , Gaga attempted to emphasise the way in which women are objectified and abused by men. It is a cunning juxtaposition as Gaga sings about her experience with sexual assault and vomit is hurled onto her body. A similar sentiment lies in her infamous ‘meat dress’. Using the abject material of blood and flesh that draped over her body, Gaga left people speechless and in a state of utter disgust. It was only later that Gaga revealed she had worn the dress as a statement against the “[[Don't ask, don't tell|Don’t Ask Don’t Tell]]” policy which silenced gay soldiers in the United States military. On the Ellen Show, Gaga exclaimed “if we don't stand up for what we believe in, if we don't fight for our rights, pretty soon we're going to have as much rights as the meat on our bones.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/956399/lady-gaga-explains-her-meat-dress-its-no-disrespect|title=Lady Gaga Explains Her Meat Dress: It's No Disrespect|last=Mapes|first=Jillian|date=September 13, 2010|website=Billboard|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;This makes clear the potential of Julia Kristeva’s theory of abjection to create social change.

=== Björk ===
Icelandic artist [[Björk]] is well known for her outlandish style and eccentric performances. Her latest album, ''[[Utopia (Björk album)|Utopia]]'' is accompanied by a plethora of abject imagery that run parallel with the feminist lyricism of the album. The album cover depicts a creature-like Björk with a bird fetus nestled in her neck, and a vagina growing from her forehead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rocknyc.live/bjork-announces-utopia-with-a-vagina-inspired-album-cover.html|title=Björk Announces 'Utopia' With A Vagina-Inspired Album Cover|last=Camus|first=Alyson|date=November 3, 2017|website=Rock NYC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effectively uses the abject in order to bring the maternal to the public sphere, forcing us to come to terms with our origin, and consequently, our imminent death. In her music video for ''[[The Gate (song)|The Gate]],'' Björk constructs a utopia of her own, rife with the symbolism of female genitalia which is played alongside birdsongs and a flute arrangement. This is another instance in which Björk has celebrated the maternal, and thus emphasised the silencing of such through our reaction to the “matriarchal tapestry” she weaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2017/11/23/bjork-utopia-review-sex-feminism|title=The pro-women vision of Björk's Utopia|last=Myers|first=Owen|date=November 23, 2017|website=Fader|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ariana Grande ===
It is only in recent times that American pop artist [[Ariana Grande]] has reinforced the notion of abjection within her own works. While she hinted towards a more female oriented approach on songs and videos such as ''[[Dangerous Woman (song)|Dangerous Woman]]'', it is one of her latest releases, off her 2018 album ''[[Sweetener (album)|Sweetener]]'', that has proven to manifest as Kristeva proposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection|last=Kristeva|first=Julia|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1982|isbn=|location=Manhattan, NY|pages=i.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[God Is a Woman|God is a woman]]'' has quickly become a cornerstone of powerful female sexuality both in and outside of the [[private sphere]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/13/ariana-grande-god-is-a-woman-new-music-video-watch-female-lord-history|title=God is a Woman: Ariana Grande taps into a long herstory of a female lord|last=Mahdawi|first=Arwa|date=July 18, 2018|website=[[The Guardian]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://themuse.jezebel.com/ariana-grande-makes-us-pray-to-a-feminist-woman-god-1827475713|title=Ariana Grande Makes Us Pray to a Feminist Woman God|last=Hope|first=Clover|last2=Finger|first2=Bobby|date=July 13, 2018|website=The Muse|publisher=Jezebel|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 2, 2018|last3=Sherman|first3=Maria|last4=Garza|first4=Frida|last5=Shaffer|first5=Claire}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with rewritings of both history and mythology from a female (and symbiotically [[Feminism|feminist]]) perspective. The overarching message is one of women’s sexual empowerment, and while that is heavily reflected in the lyricism, the accompanying music video leaves audiences with additional images and symbols of the [[Goddess|divine feminine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHLHSlExFis|title=God is a woman|last=Grande|first=Ariana|date=July 13, 2018|website=YouTube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolism and commentary in the form of a variety of depictions of the [[vagina]] are evident&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/ariana-grandes-god-is-a-woman-vagina-references|title=Ariana Grande’s ‘God Is a Woman’ Music Video Is Full of Vagina References|last=Rearick|first=Lauren|date=July 13, 2018|website=Teen Vogue|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; through various poses and hand gestures especially. The rewriting of spirituality with the phrase “God is a woman” repeated throughout, and the final image of Grande as God in a reimagining of ''[[The Creation of Adam]]'' reaffirms this call for female uprising, and challenges our society’s preconceived notions of what is and is not kept private; is a direct confrontation of the patriarchy and what women should “keep” of themselves solely for the pleasure or wants of the men that own them. However, the retaliation from religious sects especially reinstates the notion of abjection, as people of dogmatic faith claim Grande committed blasphemy in her lyrics and images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://readbloomjoy.com/2018/07/21/ariana-grandes-new-song-god-is-a-woman-has-christians-triggered/|title=Ariana Grande's New Song 'God is a woman' Has Christians Triggered|last=Gabrielle|first=Lex|date=July 2018|website=BloomJoyCollective|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grande’s use of this supremely maternal narrative, the notion that God is a woman because of their (or his or her, depending on perspective) divinity, sexual liberation and power of creation drives the message of abjection in modernity home.

== Film ==

=== Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 ===
Defined as a film in the ‘splatter’ subgenre of horror films, ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2|Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2]]'' harnesses the abject in a peculiar way. Horror is often defined as a misogynistic or heteronormative genre, but as [[Jack Halberstam]] makes clear, these ‘splatter’ films often use the abject to present queerness, or the unrecognisable human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Skin Shows: Gothic Horror and the Technology of Monsters|last=Halberstam|first=Judith|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=North Carolina|pages=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2,'' bodies are brutalised by the chainsaw, and what we are left with is the excess flesh that survives the chainsaw, forming a queer and gender indifferent identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Skin Shows: Gothic Horror and The Technology of Monsters|last=Halberstam|first=Judith|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=North Carolina|pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;According to Jack Halberstam, in this film we are subjected to the abject in the form of blood, flesh, etc., which change the bodily terrain of ‘man’ and ‘woman’. A ‘splattered’ or bloody body is queer, as it subverts the connotations of masculinity and femininity through an unrecognisable sea of tarnished flesh. 

=== Teeth ===
In the film [[Teeth (film)|Teeth]] (2007), the theories of Julia Kristeva’s on abjection and Barbara Creed’s monstrous-feminine can be explored.

Teeth is a [[Comedy horror|horror comedy]] film and [[Coming-of-age story]] written and directed by [[Mitchell Lichtenstein]] and stars [[Jess Weixler]] as Dawn, an outspoken activist of an abstinence-only group at her high school, while trying to suppress her own budding sexual desires.

The story follows Dawns’ journey of sexual discovery, however, takes a dark turn after Dawn and her new boyfriend Toby take a swim together at a local swimming hole. Toby forces himself onto Dawn, and when she tries to resist he assaults her and knocks her unconscious and proceeds to rape her. Toby is swiftly punished for sexually debasing Dawn with the masculine weapon of rape, as Dawn’s body savagely fights back, and severs Toby’s penis with her vagina. 

Through the violent act of rape and subsequent removal of Toby’s penis, Dawn discovers she is the living embodiment of the myth of the [[Vagina dentata|Vagina Dentata]] or “the toothed vagina” – the vagina that castrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Masks of God: Primitive Mythology|last=Campbell|first=Joseph|publisher=Penguin|year=1969|isbn=|location=New York|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this act, Dawn is immediately rendered unnatural to the viewer and abject. &amp;nbsp;

Freud wrote that “Probably no male human being is spared the terrifying shock of threatened castration at the sight of the female genitals,”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fetishism', On Sexuality|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|publisher=Penguin|year=1981|isbn=|series=Pelican Freud Library|volume=7|location=Harmondsworth|pages=354}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creed expands on this thought and states that “[[Castration anxiety]] is a central concern of the horror film - particularly the slasher sub-genre. Woman's body is slashed and mutilated, not only to signify her own castrated state, but also the possibility of castration for the male.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Creed|first=Barbara|date=1986|title=Horror and the Monstrous-Feminine - an Imaginary Abjection|url=|journal=Screen|volume=27 (1)|pages=52|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creed describes how the sight of the female genitals is monstrous-feminine as the role of ‘the archaic mother’, as the absence of a penis is proof that castration can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Creed|first=Barbara|date=1986|title=Horror and the Monstrous-Feminine - an Imaginary Abjection|url=|journal=Screen|volume=27 (1)|pages=63|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Dawn is the physical manifestation of [[Castration anxiety]] for males with her vagina dentata, she is made monstrous-feminine. 

Through the film Dawn learns she has evolved to have this power and learns to control it through other sexual encounters. During her initial research of her vagina dentata, she discovers that to be ‘cured’ a male hero is to conquer vagina dentata through sexual intercourse, and thus restoring the woman to her ‘proper place’ in the ‘natural’ (patriarchal) order of the world. 

What makes this film different from the usual misogynistic and patriarchal themes and tropes found in a majority of the horror genre, is that it transforms the view of monstrous-feminine to that of a heroine. The director, Mitchell Lichtenstein, explicitly wanted to change the narrative of the myth of vagina dentata to be not about women, but men, and the fear men have of women and desire for control over them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2008/sundance-interview-with-teeth-director-mitchell-lichtenstein/|title=Sundance Interview with Teeth Director Mitchell Lichtenstein|last=Billington|first=Alex|date=January 15, 2008|website=Firstshowing.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://demonista.wordpress.com/2010/07/16/never-conquered-teeth/|title=“She would never be conquered:” Feminist Resistance in Teeth|last=|first=|date=July 16, 2010|website=Demonista|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchel Lichtenstein is quoted in interviews that he didn’t want to perpetuate gynophobia and wanted to turn the myth ‘on its head’. &amp;nbsp;The vagina dentata myth always has the masculine hero conquering the woman, the monstrous-feminine, and destroying the teeth to free her. In his film, Lichtenstein wanted Dawn to be the heroine, with a power so she could never be conquered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ifc.com/2008/01/mitchell-lichtenstein-on-teeth|title=Mitchell Lichtenstein on “Teeth“|last=Hillis|first=Aaron|date=January 14, 2008|website=IFC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein made a concerted effort to both not show Dawn’s toothed vulva or to have the action of the teeth snapping shut to be very audible. This was to ensure that Dawn and her ‘teeth’ were not the monster, the monstrous-feminine, but were an evolved adaption to protect her from violent sexual predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://demonista.wordpress.com/2010/07/16/never-conquered-teeth/|title=“She would never be conquered:” Feminist Resistance in Teeth|last=|first=|date=July 16, 2010|website=Demonista|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially, Dawn evolved her vaginal dentata into a biological [[Anti-rape device]], developed to deter and prevent rape by causing pain and disfigurement to sexual violence perpetrators.

Reviews of the film have been mixed with praise from feminists for empowerment and from psychoanalysts for its exploration of the subject matter, while the anti-women [[Men's rights movement]] predictably claim the film is grossly misandrist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/teeth|title=Teeth|last=|first=|date=|website=Metacritic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the history of the horror genre and its misogynistic and patriarchal themes, it is refreshing to see a film challenge these outdated ideas.

== Television ==

=== American Horror Story ===
Throughout its eight seasons, ''[[American Horror Story]]'' has continuously shocked viewers with its intense themes. The anthology series is no stranger to depicting its female characters as antagonists, with some of these including brutal criminals, murderers, a nun subjected to demonic possession, cult members and witches. Having such grim and vicious depictions of women has often been one of the focal points for the show, drawing viewers in with the complexities of the powerful, [[violent feminine]]. The construction and use of these characters is disconcerting: horror has quite a narrow scope in relation to the presence of predatory women, and this is evident in the impact female heavy seasons of ''[[American Horror Story]]'' (such as ''[[American Horror Story: Asylum|Asylum]]'', ''[[American Horror Story: Coven|Coven]]'', ''[[American Horror Story: Cult|Cult]]'' and more recently ''[[American Horror Story: Apocalypse|Apocalypse]]'') have on ratings, viewers and themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/why-female-violence-against-men-is-societys-last-great-taboo/|title=Why female violence against men is society's last greatest taboo|last=Daubney|first=Martin|date=March 15, 2016|website=The Telegraph|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While female antagonists are commonplace, female victims are (unsurprisingly) also a factor. It is interesting then to explore the almost exclusively female horrors of the first three seasons (''[[American Horror Story: Murder House|Murder House]]'', ''[[American Horror Story: Asylum|Asylum]]'' and ''[[American Horror Story: Coven|Coven]]'') , with tropes such as closeted queerness, fetishisation, rape, birth and abortions (failed, forced and traumatic), suicide, mental illness, institutionalisation, race and the ''[[Salem witch trials|Salem Witch Trials]]'' all confirming and playing out many women’s worst nightmares. Such explicit depictions of this, then, bring [[Julia Kristeva|Kristeva]]’s theory into full effect; the notion of abjection being carried out with the blood, gore, violence, nudity, bodies, maternity and spaces ''[[American Horror Story]]'' creates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kitschmag.com/2014/09/03/american-horror-story-as-the-female-horror-story/|title=American Horror Story as the Female Horror Story|last=Berdie, Alyssa. &amp; Tiffany, Kaitlyn.|first=|date=September 2014|website=kitsch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mostly in later seasons where female empowerment and justice is served, however, there is always a prevalent and sinister underlying tension when a woman is violated at any point throughout the various ideas explored in the show’s entirety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crimejusticejournal.com/article/view/101|title=Girls, Crime and Violence: Toward a Feminist Theory of Female Violence|last=Carrington|first=Kerry|date=September 11, 2013|website=International Journal for Crime, Justice and Social Democracy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a final draw to [[Julia Kristeva|Kristeva’s]] theories, the relevance of distorted, disabled, or otherwise abnormal bodies in the show’s fourth season, ''[[American Horror Story: Freak Show|Freakshow]]'', is another theme to bring abjection to the forefront. Having differing bodies or abilities outside of the [[realm of possibility]] (including a [[Ethel Darling|bearded woman]], a [[List of American Horror Story: Freak Show characters|strong man]], several dwarves, a [[List of American Horror Story: Freak Show characters|three breasted woman]] and [[Bette and Dot Tattler|conjoined twins]] to name a few) for the season’s 1950s time setting is projected as unsettling and grotesque to not only regular society within the show but also the intended audience. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

=== Orange is the New Black ===
Another depiction of abjection in modernity is within television series ''[[Orange Is the New Black|Orange is the New Black]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01490400.2016.1203848?journalCode=ulsc20|title=Women's Leisure as Political Practice: A Feminist Analysis of Orange Is the New Black|last=McKeown, Janet K. L. &amp; Parry, Diana C.|first=|date=August 5, 2016|website=Taylor and Francis Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fictional television show, which centralises around the women within a low security prison, uses its scope of women as criminals to fight alongside movements within society (such as [[LGBT|LGBT+]] and [[Black Lives Matter]]). Using the idea of incarcerated females directly correlates with the abject, as it challenges the ideas of the [[violent and/or deviant feminine]], and the links to maternity are pellucid (both literally and symbolically when considering the pregnant female inmates in the show). By highlighting racial divides between the cell blocks and mainstreaming and normalising lesbian identity and sex, the show also calls for women to celebrate and enjoy themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jun/17/orange-is-the-new-black-this-show-will-change-the-fabric-of-our-culture|title=Orange is the New Black: This show will change the fabric of our culture|last=Ellis-Petersen|first=Hannah|date=June 2016|website=The Guardian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidenced from the initial audience shock at the themes, vulgarity and sexual prowess of the program, this notion of [[abjection]] is extremely relevant when assessing the disruption of what a woman should be in our society, using the distasteful material as fuel to reroute criminality and women in that situation.

=== The Boulet Brothers' Dragula ===
Following in the footsteps of the immensely popular [[RuPaul's Drag Race|Rupaul’s Drag Race]], [[The Boulet Brothers' Dragula|The Boulet Brothers’ Dragula]] adapt their own drag reality show that is filled to the brim with abject imagery and references to the monstrous feminine. Horror, and consequently forms of abjection, are often considered to unveil the deepest fears within the culture it is situated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thegeekanthropologist.com/2015/10/16/damsels-demons-women-in-horror-part-i/|title=Damsels &amp; Demons: Women in Horror Part I|last=Backe|first=Emma Louise|date=October 16, 2015|website=The Geek Anthropologist|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;The fears that the [[Boulet Brothers]] attempt to challenge in Dragula are fears of gender indifference, fears of the homosexual body and the fear of the breakdown of heteronormativity in which our culture operates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vbyjm3/dragula-is-loud-weird-and-pisses-on-heteronormativity|title=Dragula Is Loud, Weird, And Pisses on Heteronormativity|last=Leavell|first=Jeff|date=January 18, 2018|website=Vice|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;The premise of the reality show is to find the ‘Next Drag Supermonster’ that upholds three main traits; filth, horror, and glamour. There is indeed no holding back when it comes to filth and horror. In the season finale, [[Vander Von Odd]] stuck her fingers down her throat in order to vomit on a pile of excrement, and then proceeded to ingest it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hornet.com/stories/vander-von-odd-profile/|title=The Evolution of Vander Von Odd, The World's First Drag Supermonster|last=Zane|first=Zachary|date=November 27, 2017|website=Hornet|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;It is with this shocking display of the abject elements of excrement and vomit that Vander succeeded in subverting the heteronormative ideas of femininity. It is almost a one-two punch effect with the “fertile territory of horror” being implemented to “serve as a testimony to how much we fear female power”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thegeekanthropologist.com/2015/10/16/damsels-demons-women-in-horror-part-i/.|title=Damsels &amp; Demons: Women in Horror Part I|last=Backe|first=Emma Louise|date=October 16, 2015|website=The Geek Anthropologist|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; , fusing with the abject elements such as oral disgust that break apart out reality and force us to face our biological immanence.

'''Air rights''' are the property interest in the "space" above the earth's surface. Generally speaking, owning, or renting, land or a [[building]] includes the right to use and develop the space above the land without interference by others.

This legal concept is encoded in the Latin phrase ''[[Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos]]'' ("''Whoever owns the soil, it is theirs up to Heaven and down to Hell''."), which appears in [[medieval Roman law]] and is credited to 13th-century [[glossator]] [[Accursius]]; it was notably popularized in [[common law]] in ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' (1766) by [[William Blackstone]]; see [[Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos#Origins|origins of phrase]] for details.&lt;!-- See refs there --&gt;

== Air travel ==
&lt;!---knowledgeable people can add other countries here, but the first part is germane to all countries---&gt;
{{Further information|Flyover rights}}
Property rights defined by points on the ground were once believed to extend indefinitely upward. This notion remained unchallenged before [[air travel]] became popular in the early 20th century. To promote air transport, legislators established a legal right for the public to transit at high altitudes, regardless of real estate ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Paris Convention of 1919 (Convention for the Regulation of Aerial Navigation, Oct. 13, 1919, 11 L.N.T.S. 173) and the Pan American Convention on Commercial Aviation, U.S.-Cuba, Feb. 20, 1928, see 47 Stat. 1901)&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the public easement in the space at these higher altitudes and landowner rights to the exclusive use of the airspace at lower altitudes have been well documented by the U.S. judiciary.

New technologies have again raised questions about ownership of "space" and the upward bounds of national sovereignty.  With the advent of space travel above earth's atmosphere, the height at which national sovereignty extends and therefore nations can regulate transit is often debated.

===United States===
[[File:Building cantilever New York.JPG|thumb|right|A building is cantilevered over two other buildings in [[New York City]]]]
In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) has the sole authority to control all "publicly owned" [[airspace]], exclusively determining the rules and requirements for its use.&lt;ref&gt;49 U.S.C. 180, 49 U.S.C.A. 18 , §&amp;nbsp;40103 "use of airspace"&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the Federal Aviation Act provides that: "The [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]] has exclusive sovereignty of airspace of the United States",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/40103- |title=49 U.S.C. 40103(a)(1) |accessdate=2009-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but not all the airspace is "possessed" by the United States.  For non-public airspace, Congress has provided authority for the FAA to purchase this non-public airspace near airports to accommodate planes taking off and landing.&lt;ref&gt;49 U.S.C §&amp;nbsp;40110&lt;/ref&gt;  The "navigable airspace" in which the public has a right of transit without affecting a landowner's property rights has been set at the height of 500&amp;nbsp;ft in urban or suburban areas,&lt;ref&gt;"Argent v. U.S. 124 F.3rd 1277,1281 (1997) citing Lacey v. United States, 219 Ct.Cl. 551, 595 F.2d 614, 616 (1979) (treating 500 feet as line of demarcation between compensatable property taking and non-compensatable overflights); Matson v. United States, 145 Ct.Cl. 225, 171 F.Supp. 283, 286 (1959) (providing compensation for flights under 500 feet).Aaron v. United States, 160 Ct.Cl. 295, 311 F.2d 798, 801 (1963) (allowing claims based on flights below 500ft, while denying those based on flights over 500ft).”&lt;/ref&gt; and 360 feet above the surface or tallest structure in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. v Causby 328 U.S. 256,264-266 (1946) and Causby v U.S. 75 F.262 Ct.Cl (1948)&lt;/ref&gt;   The exact altitude(s) at which the  airspace over private land becomes "public" airspace, or where the upward bounds of national sovereignty extends is often debated, but the Supreme Court rulings and space treaties are clear.  A landowner's domain extends up to at least 365 feet above the ground. see [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17209011020287234065 Causby v US (1946)],&lt;ref&gt;U.S. v Causby 328 U.S. 256,264-266 (1946) and Causby v U.S. 75 F.262 Ct.Cl (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; and no nation can prevent orbits above the Earth's atmosphere.

The FAA is required to pay financial compensation to property owners when their property interests are taken for overflights.   Compensated landowners may then be required to waive any putative damages for interference with "air rights" in order to avoid [[lawsuit]]s from future owners' nuisance claims against low flying aircraft.  This is called a navigation or navigational [[easement]].

The low cost of [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (also called drones) in the 2000s re-raised legal questions regarding whose permission is required to fly at low altitudes; the landowner, the FAA or both.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=317074394&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the FAA reestablished that navigable airspace is the space above 500 feet,&lt;ref&gt;Doc. No. 18334, 54 FR 34294, Aug. 18, 1989, as amended by Amdt. 91-311, 75 FR 5223, Feb. 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; the FAA also set regulations which allow drones to fly below 400 feet in order to prevent interference with planes above that height.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-28/pdf/2016-15079.pdf F.R. 2016 6-28-2016 Pgs 42063- 42214 DOC #: 2016-15079]&lt;/ref&gt;  The FAA's actions are expected to see challenges in the judiciary.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

== Railroads and air rights ==
[[Rail transport|Railroads]] were the first companies to realize the potential of making money from their air rights. A good example of this is [[Grand Central Terminal]] in [[New York City]], where [[William J. Wilgus]], chief engineer of the [[New York Central Railroad|New York Central and Hudson River Railroad]], devised a plan to earn profit from air rights. At first, the railroad simply constructed a platform above the rail yards to allow for the development of buildings overhead. By 1954, the railroad began to realize it could sell more air rights and Grand Central Terminal was proposed to be replaced by a 50-story tower. This is how the [[MetLife Building|Pan Am Building]] came to be built next to the station, after public protest regarding the demolition of Grand Central Terminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gray |first=Christopher |title=Grand Central Terminal; The 23-Story, Beaux-Arts 1913 Tower That Wasn't |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 11, 1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/11/realestate/streetscapes-grand-central-terminal-23-story-beaux-arts-1913-tower-that-wasn-t.html |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has been used in Chicago since the construction of the [[One Prudential Plaza|Prudential Building]] in 1955 above active railroad tracks of the Illinois Central Railroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Dedicate New Prudential 41 Story Building |last=Fuller|first=Ernest |date=December 9, 1955 |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1955/12/09/page/13/article/dedicate-new-prudential-41-story-building |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, to the west of the Chicago River, [[River Point]] and [[150 North Riverside]] were built above tracks leading to the Amtrak station.

Building on platforms over railroad tracks is still potentially very profitable. In the mid-2000s, New York's [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA) attempted to sell air rights to the [[New York Jets]] so that they could build the [[West Side Stadium]] over Manhattan's [[West Side Yard]], near [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]], as part of the [[Hudson Yards Redevelopment]]. The [[Hudson Yards (development)|Hudson Yards mega-development]] was eventually built over the rail yard. In Brooklyn, the [[Barclays Center]] and [[Pacific Park, Brooklyn|Pacific Park]] have been constructed over Atlantic Yards.

== Roads and air rights ==
Similar to railroads, builders of [[highway]]s have proposed selling their air rights; [[Boston]] did this in connection with the [[Big Dig (Boston, Massachusetts)|Big Dig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCown |first=James |date=September 4, 2002 |title=Boston Air Rights |journal=Architecture Week |volume=113 |issue=4 |url=http://www.architectureweek.com/2002/0904/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Los Angeles|city of Los Angeles]] funded a $100,000 feasibility study [[RFP]] in January 2007 to explore building a freeway cap park in [[Hollywood]].  The park would be built above [[U.S. Route 101 in California|US highway 101]] and contain {{convert|24|acre|m2}} of new parkland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodfreewaycentralpark.org/ » Community-Wide Hollywood Central Park Meeting&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Air rights in development ==
The owner of the land has the exclusive development rights in the 'space' above his lands. Under common law, building a 'hangover' that breaks the vertical plane of a neighbor's property is a trespass and the property owner has the right to remove the offending structure. The airspace is property and retains developmental rights which can be sold or transferred. Thus in a dense downtown area, each building in the area may have the right to thirty-five stories of airspace above his own property. The owners of an older building of only three stories high could make a great deal of money by selling their building and allowing a thirty-five-story skyscraper to be built in its place. For example, a skyscraper developer may purchase the unused airspace from an adjacent landowner in order to develop a broader building. In November 2005, Christ Church in New York sold its vertical development rights for a record $430 per square foot, making more than $30 million on the sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bagli |first=Charles V. |title=$430 a Square Foot, for Air?

The '''First Saudi–Hashemite War''', also known as the '''First Nejd–Hejaz War''' or the '''al-Khurma dispute''', took place in 1918–19 between [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdulaziz Ibn Saud]] of the [[Emirate of Nejd]] and the [[Hashemites]] of the [[Kingdom of Hejaz]].

The war came within the scope of the historic conflict between the Hashemites of Hejaz and the Saudis of Riyadh (Nejd) over supremacy in Arabia.&lt;ref name=mikaberidze&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WjQfo3a1eVMC&amp;pg=PA800&amp;lpg=PA800&amp;dq=khurma+dispute&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YsK6c2NlSz&amp;sig=UaI72fs7GGqHb6dMkk_H8fMg-2o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Hs2uT9XQNsrR8gPzy5y5CQ&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Mikaberidze. P.799]&lt;/ref&gt; It resulted in the defeat of the Hashemite forces and capture of al-Khurma by the Saudis and his allied [[Ikhwan]], but [[United Kingdom|British]] intervention prevented immediate collapse of the Hashemite kingdom, establishing a sensitive cease-fire that would last until 1924.

==Background==
When [[World War I]] began, Ibn Saud, the powerful Emir of Nejd, offered the Hashemite ruler [[Sharif]] [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Husayn ibn Ali]] and the leaders of [[Ha'il]] and [[Kuwait]] to adopt a neutral stance in the conflict, avoiding intervention in European-related matters, and seeking self-determination for the Arab people.&lt;ref name=mikaberidze/&gt; However, with no interests coinciding, no agreement had been reached. Ibn Saud ignored involvement on any side for the first two years of war, while Sharif Husayn of Hejaz began promoting the [[Arab Revolt]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]], proclaiming himself "King of the Arabs."&lt;ref name=mikaberidze/&gt; Ibn Saud was infuriated over the Sharifians' claim to the entire Arab peninsula and demanded negotiations to consider the borders of Nejd and Hejaz. Husayn rejected Saudi demands and insulted the Saudi ruler, which eventually brought Ibn Saud to become involved in the political crisis over al-Khurma [[oasis]].&lt;ref name=mikaberidze/&gt;

==Warfare==

===First clashes (1918)===
Ibn Saud himself however did not maintain neutrality through World War I, being generously supported by the British against the pro-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] emirate of Ha'il. In December 1917, a British deputation, led by Colonel Hemilton tried to convince the Saudi leader to take action against the Ha'il emirate of [[Jabal Shammar]]. In return, Ibn Saud demanded firearms. Yet, the British advancement in the Ottoman province of [[History of Palestine#Ottoman era|Palestine]] made the Saudis less relevant, while the Hashemite leader in turn concluded a peace agreement with Jabal Shammar. Thus, in fall of 1918, when Ibn Saud organized some 5,000 men against Jabal Shammar, a British demand to cease military activities came in.

Al-Khurma, a crucial strategic oasis on the way between Nejd and Hejaz, had been under Hashemite rule, but following the dispute between the Saudis and the Hashemites, Khurma's emir Khalid ibn Mansur ibn Luwai defected to the Saudi side.&lt;ref name=mikaberidze/&gt; In July 1918, after the defection of al-Khurma's emir, a detachment was dispatched by Hashemite King to seize al-Khurma. In response, Ibn Saud sent his Ikhwan forces to protect the oasis, defeating the Hashemites from Mecca.

===Negotiations===
Following the end of World War I, Sharif Husayn sought to strike a deal with Ibn Saud over the al-Khurma oasis. The conflict at that point expanded from a political dispute into a religious sectarian dimension, with the [[Wahhabi]]s of Nejd standing against the Orthodox [[Sunni]] Hashemites.  Sharif Husayn decided on another expedition to Khurma. Though aware of the coming dispute, the British turned a blind eye to the Hashemite advances, largely underestimating the strength of the Saudis, who the British thought would be quickly overran.

===Battle of Turaba===
In May 1919, a Hashemite army, led by Abdallah ibn Husayn, was dispatched towards Turaba, an oasis some 80 miles away from Khurma. Turaba was seized and plundered on May 21. Ibn Saud dispatched a warning to the Hashemites, that their presence in Turaba or advance on Khurma would provoke a war, but neither side was willing to compromise at that time.

An Ikhwan force, under the command of Sultan bin Bajad, Hamud ibn Umar and Khalid meanwhile advanced on Turaba, and attacked the Hashemites by surprise on May 25–26 in their camp. In a few hours an entire Hashemite army was annihilated, with hundreds killed and thousands escaping in disarray. Abdallah ibn Husayn himself had barely fled the battlefield.

===Saudi preparations to conquer Hejaz===
The battle of Turaba was a turning point in the conflict, placing Sharif Husayn in a very weak position against Ibn Saud. In early July 1919, Ibn Saud himself arrived to Turaba with an army of 10,000 men, ready to advance on Hejaz. On July 4, however, a British ultimatum arrived to the Saudis, demanding to stop the campaign and return the Nejd. Unwilling to face the British, Ibn Saud submitted to the British demand and capitulated. It however could not change the notion of the Saudi ruler that the victory over Hejaz is possible.

==Aftermath==
{{main article|Saudi conquest of Hejaz}}
In the next 4 years, the Saudi ruler was preoccupied with consolidation of his domain, undertaking several campaigns in new regions of Arabia, while keeping the Hejazi frontier quiet. Jabal Shammar was annexed in 1920–21, while Kuwait was defeated in 1922, defining the border with Iraq and Transjordan through the Uqair protocol of 1922, while simultaneously conquering Asir in south Arabia. By early 1923, Ibn Saud decided to take over Hejaz, but was unsure over British position. The worsening relations between England and Hashemite rulers and the proclamation of Sharif Husayn as Caliph, finally made Ibn Saud to undertake the campaign, entusiasthically supported by the religiously insigted Ikhwan, who had hoped to take over the holy sites of Islam. The preliminary attack on Taif came in September 1924, beginning the Saudi conquest, which would be complete on December 1925.

==Casualties==
The number of fatalities in the 1918–19 war was hundreds of killed and thousands of injured. The actual total number of fatalities is estimated at least 1,392.&lt;ref name=arkansas&gt;Political Science. ''Middle East/North Africa/Persian Gulf Region''. University of Central Arkansas.

The '''Assyrian Socialist Party''', the first [[Assyria]]n [[political party]], was founded in 1917 after the [[February Revolution|Russian revolution]], by Dr. [[Freydun Atturaya]], Rabbi Benjamin Bet Arsanis and Dr. Baba Bet Parhad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edessa.com/profiles/freydun.htm Esha Emmanuel Tamras , ''Dr. Freydun (Atturaya) Bit Abram'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.betnahrain.net/Biographies/fraidoon.htm Dr. Fraidoon Atturaya Melta("The Word") 1995 Volume 1, No 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, an Assyrian Socialist Party (''Gaba Shawtapaya Atouraya'') was reestablished "by a group of Assyrian workers in northern [[Iraq]]", so is it stated on its website where its goals are defined as such: "The ASP(GSA) is a [[Socialism|socialist]] and [[democracy|democratic party]], which aims to resuscitate an Assyrian Nation for Assyrian people in an Independent and Popular Republic''".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030802204234/http://asp2.no.sapo.pt/index2.htm Website of the Assyrian Socialist Party]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Audiovisual art''' is the exploration of kinetic [[abstract art]] and music or sound set in relation to each other. It includes 
[[visual music]], [[abstract film]], audiovisual [[performances]] and [[Installation art|installations]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Overview==
The book ''Art and the Senses'' cites the [[Italian Futurists|Italian Futurist]] artists, [[Fortunato Depero]] and [[Luigi Russolo]] as designing art machines in 1915 to create a multisensory experience of sound, movement and colour.&lt;ref name=artandsens&gt;{{Citation|last1=Bacci |first1=Francesca|last2=Melcher|first2=David |url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=61Hj9o3mPBUC&amp;pg=PA287#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Art and the Senses |pages=286–7 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-19-923060-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s [[Harry Bertoia]] created sound sculptures of objects to have a multisensory effect, exploring the relationships between the sound, the initiating event and the material properties of the objects.&lt;ref name=artandsens /&gt; In an example with overt musical connections, ''The Oxford Handbook of New Audiovisual Aesthetics'' cites musician Brian Williams (aka [[Lustmord]]) as someone whose practise crosses audiovisual art and mainstream media, where his work is "not traditionally 'musical'" and has "clearly visual aspects".&lt;ref name=oxhand&gt;{{Citation|last1=Richardson |first1=John |last2=Gorbman |first2=Claudia |last3=Vernallis |first3=Carol |url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=Y8JpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA367#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Oxford Handbook of New Audiovisual Aesthetics |pages=367–8 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-973386-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernard Coulie''' (born 1959) is a [[Belgian]] academic specializing in Greek [[patristic]] literature primarily of [[Late Antiquity]] and its derivatives (hence an expertise in translation techniques) and counterparts in eastern Christian oriental languages of that period (notably [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and [[Georgian language|Georgian]]). A dominant interest has been the work of [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] (Gregory the Theologian) and he has been closely associated since the 1980s with the NAZIANZOS project of the [[University of Louvain-la-Neuve]] which he has directed for approximately a quarter of a century. Many of his contributions are detailed in the Publications section of the NAZIANZOS site. He has notably undertaken the editorship of volumes of the Corpus Nazianzenum series in [[Corpus Christianorum]], Series Graeca (published by Brepols). This has involved Coulie in co-operation with the computerized CETEDOC editions. He has published  work jointly with Georgian and Armenian scholars.

Coulie's initial university studies were at Louvain, Harvard and Vienna.

Coulie is a member of the councils of several academic and comparable institutions, e.g. he is president of the Conseil d'administration of the Fondation Nubar Pasha - Oeuvre des Boursiers armeniens. (A fuller list can be seen in his French language Wikipedia entry).

Coulie is currently editor of the academic journal, ''[[Le Mouséon]]''.

Coulie was president of the academic corps of Louvain-la-Neuve University in 1998. He was the third lay person to serve as Rector of Louvain University (2004–2009).

[[Image:Jade Bi Ornament, Dragon designs, China - Warring States period, Western Han dynasty, 4th-2nd century BC.tiff|thumb|A Western Han dynasty Bi, with dragon designs.]]
The '''bi''' is a type of circular ancient [[Chinese jade]] artifact. The earliest ''bi'' were produced in the [[Neolithic]] period, particularly by the [[Liangzhu culture]] ([[3400 BC|3400]]–[[2250 BCE]]).&lt;ref name="nga.gov"&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/education/chinatp_sl03.shtm Teaching Chinese Archaeology, object 3 - NGA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508040340/http://www.nga.gov/education/chinatp_sl03.shtm |date=May 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later examples date mainly from the [[Shang Dynasty|Shang]], [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] and [[Han Dynasty|Han]] dynasties. They were also made in [[Ancient Chinese glass|glass]].

==Description==
A ''bi'' is a flat jade disc with a circular hole in the centre. Neolithic ''bi'' are undecorated, while those of later periods of China, like the Zhou dynasty, bear increasingly ornate surface carving (particularly in a hexagonal pattern) whose motifs represented deities associated with the sky (four directions) as well as standing for qualities and powers the wearer wanted to invoke or embody.

As laboriously crafted objects, they testify to the concentration of power and resources in the hands of a small elite.&lt;ref name="nga.gov"/&gt;

==Meaning==
Later traditions associate the ''bi'' with heaven, and the ''[[Cong (jade)|cong]]'' with the earth. Bi disks are consistently found with heaven and earth-like imagery, suggesting that the disk's circular shape also bears symbolic significance as this description explains:

{{quote|It is found that these objects testify to early stages of development of cosmological concepts that remained important in Chinese culture during the Warring States and Han periods: the notion of a covering sky (''gaitian'') that revolves around a central axis, the cycle of the Ten Suns, and the use of an early form of the carpenter's square. These objects were handled by shamans who were the religious leaders of Liangzhu society and the transmitters of cosmological knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shu-P'Ing |first1=Teng |title=The Original Significance of ''Bi'' Disks: Insights Based on Liangzhu Jade ''Bi'' with Incised Symbolic Motifs |journal=Journal of East Asian Archaeology |date=2000 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=165–194 |doi=10.1163/156852300509835}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Function==
[[File:Bi with two dragons and grain pattern.jpg|thumb|Bi disc with a dual dragon motif, [[Warring States period]]]]
The original function and significance of the ''bi'' are unknown, as the Neolithic cultures have left no written history. From these earliest times they were buried with the dead, as a sky symbol, accompanying the dead into the after world or "sky", with the cong which connected the body with the earth.&lt;ref name="nga.gov"/&gt; They were placed ceremonially on the body in the grave of persons of high social status. ''Bi'' are sometimes found near the stomach and chest in neolithic burials.&lt;ref name="nga.gov"/&gt;

Jade, like bi disks, has been used throughout Chinese history to indicate an individual of moral quality, and has also served as an important symbol of rank. They were used in worship and ceremony – as ceremonial items they symbolised the ranks of emperor, king, duke, marquis, viscount, and baron with four different ''[[Gui_(vessel)|Gui]]s'' and two different bi disks.

In war during the Zhou dynasty period (c. 1046–256 BCE), bi disks belonging to the leaders of the defeated forces were handed over to the victor as a sign of submission.

==Influences==
The design of the reverse side of the medals given in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] are based on bi disks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.beijing2008.cn/spirit/beijing2008/graphic/n214070893.shtml Design of the Medal for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080812163040/http://en.beijing2008.cn/spirit/beijing2008/graphic/n214070893.shtml |date=August 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Taze Russell''' (February 16, 1852&amp;nbsp;– October 31, 1916), or '''Pastor Russell''', was an American Christian [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restorationist]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] from [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], and founder of what is now known as the [[Bible Student movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9064467/Charles-Taze-Russell |title=Russell, Charles Taze |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=2006-09-22 |access-date=2013-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parkinson, James ''The Bible Student Movement in the Days of CT Russell'', 1975&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and numerous independent Bible Student groups developed from this base.

In July 1879, Russell began publishing a monthly religious journal, ''[[The Watchtower|Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence]]''. In 1881 he co-founded [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society]] with [[William Henry Conley]] as president; in 1884 the corporation was officially registered, with Russell as president. Russell wrote many articles, books, tracts, pamphlets and sermons, totaling approximately 50,000 printed pages. From 1886 to 1904, he published a six-volume Bible study series originally titled ''Millennial Dawn'', later renamed ''[[Studies in the Scriptures]]'', nearly 20 million copies of which were printed and distributed around the world in several languages during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Penton| first = M. James | authorlink = James Penton| title = Apocalypse Delayed: The Story of Jehovah's Witnesses| publisher = University of Toronto Press| year = 1997|edition=2nd| pages = 13–46| isbn = 0-8020-7973-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A seventh volume was commissioned by his successor as society president, [[Joseph Franklin Rutherford|Joseph Rutherford]], and published in 1917.) The Watch Tower Society ceased publication of Russell's writings in 1927,&lt;ref&gt;WTB&amp;TS, "God's Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached" (1973) page 347&lt;/ref&gt; though his books are still published by several independent groups.

After Russell's death, a [[Watch Tower Society presidency dispute (1917)|crisis]] arose surrounding Rutherford's leadership of the society, culminating in a movement-wide schism. As many as three-quarters of the approximately 50,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2REMAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA374 |title=The New Schaff–Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge |volume=Volume 7 |publisher=Funk and Wagnalls Company |date=1910 |page=374 |access-date=2013-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bible Students who had been associating in 1917 had left by 1931. This shift resulted in the formation of several groups that retained variations on the name ''[[Bible Student movement|Bible Students]]''. Those who maintained fellowship with the Watch Tower Society adopted the name ''Jehovah's witnesses'' in 1931, while those who severed ties with the Society formed their own groups including the [[Pastoral Bible Institute]] in 1918, the [[Laymen's Home Missionary Movement]] in 1919, and the [[Dawn Bible Students Association]] in 1929.

==Early life==
{{Bible Students}}
Charles Taze Russell was born to [[Scotch-Irish American|Scottish-Irish]] parents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=The Watchtower|date=1 January 1955|page=7|title=Part 1—Early Voices (1870–1878)|quote=Both parents were Presbyterians of Scottish-Irish lineage.}}&lt;/ref&gt; immigrant Joseph Lytel Russell {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|t|əl}} (d. December 17, 1897) and Ann Eliza Birney (d. January 25, 1861), on February 16, 1852 in [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania]]. Russell was the second of five children, of whom two survived into adulthood. His mother died when he was 9 years old.&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses in the Divine Purpose,'' 1959, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russells lived for a time in [[Philadelphia]] before moving to Pittsburgh, where they became members of the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]]. When Charles was in his early teens, his father made him partner of his Pittsburgh [[haberdasher]]y store. By age twelve, Russell was writing business contracts for customers and given charge of some of his father's other clothing stores.&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses Proclaimers of God's Kingdom,'' 1993, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; At age thirteen, Russell left the Presbyterian Church to join the [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational Church]]. In his youth he was known to chalk Bible verses on fence boards and city sidewalks in an attempt to convert unbelievers; he particularly noted the punishment of hell awaiting the unfaithful.&lt;ref&gt;''Overland Monthly'' February 1917 pg 129: "Up to the age of fifteen ... his favorite teacher was Spurgeon, because, as he said, "he peppered it hot," his claim being that if one believed a thing he should tell it with all his might. So at the age of fifteen he used to go about the city of Pittsburg on Saturday evenings with a piece of chalk writing on the fence boards and telling the people not to fail to attend church on Sunday, so that they might escape the terrible hell in which he so firmly believed."&lt;/ref&gt;

At age sixteen, a discussion with a childhood friend on faults perceived in [[Christianity]] (such as contradictions in [[creed]]s, along with medieval traditions) led Russell to question his faith. He investigated various other religions, but concluded that they did not provide the answers he was seeking.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Student Movement in the Days of CT Russell,'' 1975, p. A–1&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870, at age eighteen, he attended a presentation by [[Adventism|Adventist]] minister [[Jonas Wendell]]. Russell later said that, although he had not entirely agreed with Wendell's arguments, the presentation had inspired him with a renewed zeal and belief that the Bible is the word of God.&lt;ref&gt;''Zion's Watch Tower,'' June 1, 1916 p. 170: "Though his Scripture exposition was not entirely clear, and though it was very far from what we now rejoice in, it was sufficient, under God, to reestablish my wavering faith in the Divine inspiration of the Bible, and to show that the records of the Apostles and the Prophets are indissolubly linked. What I heard sent me to my Bible to study with more zeal and care than ever before, and I shall ever thank the Lord for the leading; for although Adventism helped me to no single truth, it did help me greatly in the unlearning of errors, and thus prepared me for the Truth."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
On March 13, 1879, Russell married Maria Frances Ackley ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|r|aɪ|.|ə}}; 1850–1938) after a few months' acquaintance.&lt;ref&gt;''Pittsburgh Gazette,'' March 14, 1879&lt;/ref&gt; The couple separated in 1897. Russell blamed the marriage breakup on disagreements over Maria Russell's insistence on a greater editorial role in ''Zion's Watch Tower'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Penton | first = M.J. | title = Apocalypse Delayed | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 1997 | pages = 35–40 |isbn=978-0-8020-7973-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A later court judgment noted that he had labelled the marriage "a mistake" three years before the dispute over her editorial ambitions had arisen.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Grizzuti Harrison]], ''Visions of Glory – A History and Memory of Jehovah's Witnesses'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1978, chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Maria Russell filed a suit for legal separation in the Court of Common Pleas at Pittsburgh in June 1903 and three years later filed for [[divorce]] under the claim of mental cruelty.&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses in Canada: Champions of Freedom of Speech and Worship'' by M. James Penton, Macmillan of Canada, 1976, page 313, "Mrs. Russell obtained her "divorce", or separation, on grounds of mental cruelty"&lt;/ref&gt; She was granted a [[Legal separation#A mensa et thoro|divorce]], with alimony, in 1908.&lt;ref name="Jehovah's Witnesses p. 645"&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses: Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', p. 642&lt;/ref&gt; Maria Russell died at the age of 88 in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], [[Florida]] on March 12, 1938 from complications related to [[Hodgkin's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;St. Petersburg Times, March 14, 1938. {{cite news|newspaper=The Evening Independent|title=Woman Religious Writer, Resident 16 Years, Passes|date=March 14, 1938|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=P50LAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OlUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5060,5746821&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ministry==
Russell was a charismatic figure, but claimed no special revelation or vision for his teachings and no special authority on his own behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cesnur.org/2001/london2001/chryssides.htm |author=George Cispedes |title=Unrecognized charisma? A study of four charismatic leaders |publisher= Center of Studies on New Religions |access-date= 23 July 2008 |date= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that he did not seek to found a new denomination, but intended to gather together those who were seeking the truth of God's Word "during this harvest time".&lt;ref&gt;''Zion's Watch Tower'', Sept. 15, 1895, pg 216: Quote: "Beware of "organization." It is wholly unnecessary. The Bible rules will be the only rules you will need. Do not seek to bind others' consciences, and do not permit others to bind yours."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Studies in the Scriptures, Volume 4 ''The Battle of Armageddon'', 1897, pp 157–159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daschke, Dereck and W. Michael Ashcraft, eds. ''New Religious Movements.'' New York: New York UP, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that the "clear unfolding of truth" within his teachings was due to "the simple fact that God's due time has come; and if I did not speak, and no other agent could be found, the very stones would cry out."&lt;ref name=WT06&gt;[http://www.pastor-russell.com/legacy/zwt15july06.html ''Zion's Watch Tower,'' July 15, 1906, p. 229].&lt;/ref&gt; He viewed himself—and all other Christians anointed with the Holy Spirit—as "God's mouthpiece" and an ambassador of Christ.&lt;ref name=WT06 /&gt; Later in his career he accepted without protest that many Bible Students viewed him as the "[[Faithful and discreet slave|faithful and wise servant]]" of Matthew 24:45.&lt;ref name=WT23&gt;''Watch Tower'', March 1, 1923, pages 68 and 71.&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, the ''Watch Tower'' said that he had been made "ruler of all the Lord's goods".&lt;ref name=WT23 /&gt;

===Beginnings===
{{Jehovah's Witnesses}}
About 1870, Russell and his father established a group with a number of acquaintances to undertake an analytical study of the Bible and the origins of Christian doctrine, creed, and tradition. The group, strongly influenced by the writings of [[Millerites|Millerite]] [[Adventism|Adventist]] ministers [[George Storrs]] and [[George Stetson]], who were also frequent attendees, concluded that many of the primary doctrines of the established churches, including the Trinity, hellfire, and inherent immortality of the soul, were not substantiated by the scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Penton| first = M. James | authorlink = James Penton| title = Apocalypse Delayed: The Story of Jehovah's Witnesses| publisher = University of Toronto Press| year = 1997|edition=2nd| pages = 14–17| isbn = 0-8020-7973-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Rogerson|title=Millions Now Living Will Never Die|publisher=Constable|year=1969|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Wills |first = Tony |title = A People For His Name | publisher = Lulu Enterprises |year = 2006 |page = 4|isbn = 978-1-4303-0100-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Zion's Watch Tower,'' June 1, 1916, pp. 170–175&lt;/ref&gt;

Around January 1876 Russell received a copy of Nelson Barbour's ''Herald of the Morning'' in the mail. Barbour was an influential Adventist writer and publisher. Russell telegraphed Barbour to set up a meeting. Barbour and John Henry Paton visited in Allegheny in March 1876 at Russell's expense so that he could hear their arguments, and compare the conclusions that each side had made in their studies. Russell sponsored a speech by Barbour in St. George's Hall, Philadelphia in August 1876 and attended other lectures by Barbour.

Among the teachings Barbour introduced was the view that Christians who had died would be raised in April 1878.&lt;ref&gt;''Herald of the Morning,'' July 1878 p.5&lt;/ref&gt; Russell, who had previously rejected prophetic chronology, was moved to devote his life to what he was convinced were now the last two years before the invisible, spiritual return of Christ. He sold his five clothing stores for approximately $300,000 (current value ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|300000|1876|r=-3}}}}). With Russell's encouragement and financial backing, Barbour wrote an outline of their views in ''[[Three Worlds (book)|Three Worlds and the Harvest of This World]]'', published in 1877. A text Russell had previously written, titled ''The Object and Manner of our Lord's Return'', was published concurrently through the offices of the ''Herald of the Morning''.&lt;ref&gt;Zion's Watch Tower, July 15, 1906, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; Russell was eager to lead a Christian revival and called two separate meetings of Christian leaders in Pittsburgh. Russell's ideas, particularly stressing the imminence of the [[rapture]] and the second advent of Christ, were rejected both times.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Student Movement in the Days of CT Russell,'' 1975, pp A–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses in the Divine Purpose,'' 1959, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

When 1878 arrived, failure of the expected rapture brought great disappointment for Barbour and Russell, and their associates and readers. But one of Russell's associates, [[Alexander Hugh Macmillan|A.H. Macmillan]], claimed that Russell was not upset.

{{quote|While talking with Russell about the events of 1878, I told him that Pittsburgh papers had reported he was on the Sixth Street bridge dressed in a white robe on the night of the Memorial of Christ's death, expecting to be taken to heaven together with many others. I asked him, "Is that correct?" Russell laughed heartily and said: "I was in bed that night between 10:30 and 11:00 P.M. However, some of the more radical ones might have been there, but I was not. Neither did I expect to be taken to heaven at that time, for I felt there was much work to be done preaching the Kingdom message to the peoples of the earth before the church would be taken away.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204745/http://www.quotedstatements.com/fotm.htm ''Faith on the March'', 1957, page 27] Archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confused by what was perceived to be an error in calculation, Russell re-examined the doctrine to see if he could determine whether it had biblical origins or was simply Christian tradition.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} He concluded that the doctrine was Christian tradition. Through the pages of the ''Herald'', he wrote about what he had concluded on the subject. Barbour, embarrassed by the failure of their expectations, rejected Russell's explanation. They conducted a debate in successive issues of the journal from early 1878 to mid-1879. In a matter of months, Barbour changed some of the views which he and Russell had previously shared, and no longer relied on prophetic chronology. They began to debate over the issue of 'Christ's ransom,' and the two eventually separated because of their disagreements.

Russell withdrew his financial support and started his own journal, ''Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence'', publishing his first issue in July 1879. Barbour formed The Church of the Strangers that same year, continuing to publish ''Herald of the Morning''.&lt;ref&gt;Message to Herald of the Morning subscribers, ''Zion's Watch Tower,'' July 1, 1879, Supplement&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Rochester Union and Advertiser,'' October 5, 1895, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Zion's Watch Tower,'' June 1, 1916 p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

===Watch Tower Society===
In 1881, Russell founded [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society]], with [[William Henry Conley]] as president and Russell as secretary-treasurer; they intended to disseminate tracts, papers, doctrinal treatises and Bibles. All materials were printed and bound by Russell's privately owned Tower Publishing Company for an agreed price,&lt;ref&gt;''1975 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', page 42&lt;/ref&gt; then distributed by [[Colportage|colporteurs]]. The Society was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in 1884, with Russell as president, and in 1886 its name was changed to Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society.

In 1908, Russell transferred the headquarters of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society to [[Brooklyn, New York]] where it remained until 2016.

===Publications===
With the formation of the Watch Tower Society, Russell intensified his ministry. His Bible study group had grown to hundreds of local members, with followers throughout [[New England]], the [[The Virginias|Virginias]], [[Ohio]], and elsewhere. They annually re-elected him "Pastor", and commonly referred to him as "Pastor Russell". Congregations that eventually formed in other nations also followed this tradition.&lt;ref name="Pastor Russell 1918, p. 6"&gt;''Biography of Pastor Russell, Divine Plan of the Ages,'' 1918, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Great Battle in the Ecclesiastical Heavens,'' 1915&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881, Russell published his first work to gain wide distribution: ''Food for Thinking Christians.'' The 162-page "pamphlet" was published using donated funds amounting to approximately $40,000 (current value ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|40000|1878}}}}).&lt;ref&gt;''Overland Monthly,'' January 1917 p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; It had a circulation of nearly 1.5 million copies over a period of four months distributed throughout the United States, Canada and Great Britain by various channels.&lt;ref&gt;''Watch Tower,'' December 1, 1916 p. 357&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Zion's Watch Tower,'' September 1881 p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year he published ''Tabernacle and its Teachings'' which was quickly expanded and reissued as ''Tabernacle Shadows of the "Better Sacrifices",'' outlining his interpretation of the various animal sacrifices and tabernacle ceremonies instituted by [[Moses]]. Russell claimed that the distribution of these works and other tracts by the Watch Tower Society during 1881 exceeded by eight times that of the [[American Tract Society]] for the year 1880.&lt;ref&gt;''Zion's Watch Tower'', September 1881 p. 5: "As we were reaching Christians in the cities with the pamphlets, we sent the papers only with weekly and monthly journals, and hope thus to have reached many Christians in country districts. We sent out in this way over 400,000 copies. Thus you see that from an apparently small beginning, the tract work has spread to the immense proportions of 1,200,000 copies, or about 200,000,000 pages in four months, or about eight times as much (in number) as were distributed by the American Tract Society in the last year."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, newspapers began publishing his written sermons. These newspaper sermons were syndicated worldwide in as many as 4,000 newspapers, eventually reaching an estimated readership of some 15 million in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name="Pastor Russell 1918, p. 6" /&gt;

In 1910 the secular journal ''[[Overland Monthly]]'' calculated that by 1909, Russell's writings had become the most widely distributed, privately produced English-language works in the United States. It said that the entire corpus of his works were the third most circulated on earth, after the Bible and the Chinese Almanac.&lt;ref&gt;''Overland Monthly,'' January 1910 p. 130: "As a writer, Mr. Russell's books have enjoyed a larger circulation than any English work ... Of his work entitled "Studies in the Scriptures," the average output is two thousand three hundred copies for each working day. We regret the records of 1909 are not yet complete, but in 1908 seven hundred and twenty-eight thousand, four hundred and seventy-four volumes were sold. Since publication, three million five hundred and thirty-four thousand volumes have been circulated. Last year, in addition to these there were three hundred and eight million pages of his tracts circulated. In all literature the Bible is about the only book that has had a larger circulation ... In the literature of the world, the order would probably be as follows: The Bible, the Chinese Almanac, the "Studies in the Scriptures," "Don Quixote," "Uncle Tom's Cabin" and Hubbard's "Message to Garcia.""&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912 ''The Continent'', a Presbyterian journal, stated that in North America Russell's writings had achieved a greater circulation "than the combined circulation of the writings of all the priests and preachers in North America."&lt;ref&gt;''The Continent'', McCormick Publishing Company, vol. 43, no. 40, October 3, 1912 p. 1354&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell also had many critics, and he was frequently described as a [[heresy|heretic]] in this period.&lt;ref&gt;''Millennial Dawnism: The Annihilation of Jesus Christ'' by I.M. Haldeman, 1913; ''"Pastor" Russell's Position and Credentials'' by J.H. Burridge; ''Some Facts about the self-styled "Pastor" Charles T. Russell'' by J.J. Ross, 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Studies in the Scriptures''====
Russell devoted nearly a tenth of his fortune, along with contributed funds, in publishing and distributing ''Food for Thinking Christians'' in 1881. That year he also published ''The Tabernacle and its Teachings'' and ''Tabernacle Shadows of the Better Sacrifices''. In 1886, after reportedly not making back most of the money spent publishing these three titles, he began publication of what was intended to be a seven-volume series. The volumes were collectively called ''Millennial Dawn'', later renamed ''[[Studies in the Scriptures]]'' to clarify that they were not novels. Russell published six volumes in the series:{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}
* ''The Plan of the Ages''&amp;nbsp;– later renamed ''The Divine Plan of the Ages'' (1886)
* ''The Time is at Hand'' (1889)
* ''Thy Kingdom Come'' (1891)
* ''The Day of Vengeance''&amp;nbsp;– later renamed ''The Battle of Armageddon'' (1897)
* ''The At-one-ment Between God and Men'' (1899)
* ''The New Creation'' (1904)

The delayed publication of the seventh volume became a source of great anticipation and mystery among Bible Students. Following Russell's death in 1916, a seventh volume titled ''The Finished Mystery'' was published in 1917; this was advertised as his "posthumous work". This seventh volume was a detailed interpretation of the [[Book of Revelation]], but also included interpretations of [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] and the [[Song of Songs|Song of Solomon]]. Controversy quickly surrounded both its publication and content. It soon became known that much of the contents were written and compiled by two of Russell's associates, [[Clayton J. Woodworth]] and [[George H. Fisher]], and edited by [[Joseph Franklin Rutherford|Joseph Rutherford]], by then the new president of the Watch Tower Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Franz | first = Raymond | authorlink = Raymond Franz| title = Crisis of Conscience | publisher = Commentary Press | year = 2004 | location = Atlanta, Georgia | pages = 61–62, 206–211 | isbn = 0-914675-23-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Photo Drama of Creation''====
{{Main|The Photo-Drama of Creation}}
Russell directed the production of a worldwide roadshow presentation titled ''[[The Photo-Drama of Creation]]'', an innovative eight-hour religious film in four parts. It was the first major screenplay to incorporate synchronized sound, moving film, and color slides.&lt;ref name=filmsite&gt;American Movie Classics, [http://www.filmsite.org/1914-filmhistory.html "Timeline of Greatest Film History Milestones'..."1914"], Retrieved 2009-04-15&lt;/ref&gt; Production began as early as 1912, and the ''Drama'' was introduced in 1914 by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162536/trivia IMDB article "Photo-Drama of Creation (1914), Retrieved 2009-04-15]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmsite.org/milestones1910s_2.html "Timeline of Influential Milestones...1910s", American Movie Classics, retrieved 2009-04-15] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110133622/http://www.filmsite.org/milestones1910s_2.html |date=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A book by the same name was also published. The project's expenses put the organization under some financial pressures; the full cost was estimated at about US$300,000 (current value ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|300000|1914|r=-4}}}}).&lt;ref&gt;"Society Uses Many Means to Expand Preaching", ''Centennial of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania 1884–1984'', page 24, "The Photo-Drama presented the explanation of Bible truth from the time of creation, the fall into sin, the promises of God to redeem man and His dealings through history until the millennial restitution. It is believed to have been viewed by more than 9,000,000 people throughout North America and Europe, as well as many others in places around the world. It took two years and $300,000 to complete the project, many of the scenes being hand colored. Yet admission was free and no collections were taken."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"United States of America", ''1975 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', page 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Warning Work (1909–1914)", ''The Watchtower'', March 1, 1955, page 143&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology and teachings==
Following his analytical examination of the Bible, Russell and other Bible Students came to believe that Christian creeds and traditions were harmful errors. They thought their own work was restoring Christianity to the purity of its first century. Many Church leaders and scholars in his day considered this to be heresy. Russell agreed with other Protestants on the primacy of the Bible, and justification by faith alone, but thought that errors had been introduced in interpretation. Russell agreed with many 19th-century Protestants, including [[Millerism|Millerite]]s, in the concept of a [[Great Apostasy]] that began in the first century AD. He also agreed with many other contemporary Protestants in belief in the imminent [[Second Coming]] of Christ, and [[Armageddon]].

His Scriptural interpretations differed from those of Catholics, and many Protestants, in the following areas: 
[[File:Chart from Divine Plan of the ages.GIF|300px|thumb|The Chart of the Ages]]
* [[Hell]]. He said there was a heavenly resurrection of [[144,000]] righteous, as well as a "great multitude", but believed that the remainder of mankind slept in death, awaiting an earthly resurrection, rather than suffering in a literal Hell.
* The [[Trinity]]. Russell believed in the divinity of Christ, but differed from orthodoxy by teaching Jesus had received that divinity as a gift from the Father after dying on the cross. He also taught that the Holy Spirit is not a person, but the manifestation of God's power.
* Christ's [[Second Coming]]. Russell believed that Christ had returned invisibly in October 1874, and that he had been [[parousia|ruling from heaven]] since that date. He believed that a 'time of trouble' began then that would mark a gradual deterioration of civilized society leading up to the end of the "[[Eschatology of Jehovah's Witnesses#2,520 year "Gentile Times"|Gentile Times]]" with a climactic multi-national attack on a restored Israel, worldwide anarchy, and the sudden destruction of all world governments in October 1914. After the outbreak of [[World War I]], Russell reinterpreted 1914 as the beginning of [[Armageddon]].
* [[Pyramidology]]. Following views first taught by Christian writers such as [[John Taylor (1781–1864)|John Taylor]], [[Charles Piazzi Smyth]] and [[Joseph Seiss]], Russell believed that [[the Great Pyramid of Giza]] was built by the [[Hebrews]] (associated to the [[Hyksos]]) under God's direction, but to be understood only in our day. He adopted and used Seiss's phrase, referring to it as "the Bible in stone". He believed that certain biblical texts, including Isaiah 19:19–20 and others, prophesied a future understanding of the Great Pyramid. He believed that the various ascending and descending passages represented the fall of man, the provision of the [[Torah|Mosaic Law]], the death of Christ, the exultation of the saints in heaven, etc. Calculations were made using the pattern of an inch per year. Dates such as 1874, 1914, and 1948 were purported to have been found through the study of this monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastor-russell.com/volumes/V3/Study_10.html |title=The Corroborative Testimony of God's stone witness and prophet, the Great Pyramid in Egypt |publisher=Pastor-russell.com |date= |access-date=2013-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Christian Zionism]]. Expanding upon an idea suggested by Nelson Barbour, Russell taught as early as 1879 that God's favor had been restored to [[Jews]] as the result of a prophetic "double" which had ended in 1878 (favor from [[Jacob]] to Jesus, then disfavor from Jesus until 1878). In 1910, he conducted a meeting at the [[New York Hippodrome]] Theatre, with thousands of Jews attending. Jews and Christians alike were shocked by his teaching that Jews should not convert to Christianity. Russell believed that the land of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] belonged exclusively to the Jewish race, that God was now calling them back to their land, and that they would be the center of earthly leadership under God's Kingdom. Early in Russell's ministry, he speculated that the Jews would possibly flock to Palestine and form their own nation by the year 1910. Shortly before his death, he used the Jewish press to stress that 1914 prophetically marked the time when Gentile nations no longer had earthly authority; he said that all Jews were, from that time onward, permitted and guided by God to gather to Palestine and boldly reclaim the land for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium.MAGAZINE-before-herzl-there-was-pastor-russell-a-neglected-chapter-of-zionism-1.6409303|title=Before Herzl, There Was Pastor Russell: A Neglected Chapter of Zionism|last=Bohstrom|first=Philippe|date=2018-08-22|work=Haaretz|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Climate change]]. In writings as early as 1883 (and through to the end of his life), Russell repeatedly expressed the view that the world's climate would gradually change as a prelude to the re-establishment of Eden-like conditions.

{{See also|Watch Tower Society presidency dispute (1917)}}
{{Details|Joseph Franklin Rutherford#Reorganization}}
In January 1917, [[Joseph Franklin Rutherford]] was elected president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, despite disputes over the election process. Further disputes arose over interpretation of sections of Russell's will dealing with the future contents of ''Zion's Watch Tower'' magazine, as well as who, if anyone, had authority to print new literature. By the end of the 1920s, nearly three quarters of the Bible Student congregations had rejected&lt;ref&gt;''Thirty Years a Watchtower Slave'', William J. Schnell, Baker, Grand Rapids, 1956, as cited by Alan Rogerson, ''Millions Now Living Will Never Die'', 1969, page 52. Rogerson notes that it is not clear exactly how many Bible Students left. Joseph Rutherford wrote in 1934 that "of the great multitude that left the world to follow Jesus Christ only a few are now in God's organization".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Daily Tribune'' October 30, 1949 pg 18: "Pastor Russell died In 1916. In the 33 years since, the methods of this sect have deviated completely from those of Pastor Russell and his manner of teaching."&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford's on-going changes in organizational structure, doctrinal interpretations, and congregational practices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Your Will Be Done on Earth|publisher=Watchtower|year=1958|page=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jehovah's Witnesses in the Divine Purpose|publisher=Watchtower|year=1959|page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Apocalypse Delayed—The Story of Jehovah's Witnesses|author=M. James Penton|page=61}} Attendance at the annual Memorial (statistics were published each year in the ''Watch Tower'') shows the growth in the period before 1925. 1919: 17,961, 1922: 32,661, 1923: 42,000, 1924: 62,696, 1925: 90,434. 1926 marked the first decrease: 89,278. There are no published statistics from 1929–1934. In 1935, Memorial attendance was 63,146. {{cite magazine|title=Watchtower|date=August 15, 1996|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which began to appear in material printed by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society as early as 1917. Many Bible Students were disaffected by Rutherford's rejection of Russell's views regarding his role in the restoration of the "truth"&lt;ref&gt;''Watch Tower'', February 1927&lt;/ref&gt; and support of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] as having been built under God's direction.&lt;ref&gt;''Watch Tower'', November 1928&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Great Pyramid Passages'', by John and Morton Edgar, Forward, 1928 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Those remaining supportive of Rutherford adopted the new name "[[Jehovah's witnesses]]&lt;!--not capitalized until 1970s--&gt;" in 1931. They renamed their magazine as ''The Watchtower''. Many of the most prominent Bible Students who had left the society held their own meeting in October 1929 to gather other dissenters; the First Annual Bible Students Reunion Convention was held in the old Pittsburgh "Bible House" long used by Russell.&lt;ref&gt;''Bible Student's Radio Echo,'' February 1929 p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; These conventions were held yearly, but the process of 'regathering' took nearly twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;''When Pastor Russell Died,'' pp. 26–30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Leadership style===
As early as 1892, Russell's views and management style were strongly criticized by certain individuals associated with his ministry. In 1893 a paper was written and circulated to [[Bible Student movement|Bible Students]] in Pittsburgh by associates Otto van Zech, Elmer Bryan, J. B. Adamson, S. G. Rogers, Paul Koetitz, and others. It accused Russell of being a dictatorial leader, a shrewd businessman who appeared eager to collect funds from the selling of the ''[[Millennial Dawn]]'' books, of cheating one of them financially, and of issuing thousands of ''Millennial Dawn'' books under a female pseudonym. Russell wrote a booklet ''A Conspiracy Exposed and Harvest Siftings'' in response, issuing it as an extra to the April 1894 ''Zion's Watch Tower'' magazine. He intended to pre-empt efforts by his critics to circulate their views to a wider audience of Bible Students. Russell printed copies of letters he had received from these former associates in order to show that their claims were false, and that those involved 'were guided by Satan in an attempt to subvert his work' as a "minister of the gospel".&lt;ref&gt;''A Conspiracy Exposed and Harvest Siftings,'' April 25, 1894&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Student Movement in the Days of CT Russell,'' 1975, pp P–1 to P–4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegation of immoral conduct===
In 1897 Russell's wife, Maria, left him after a disagreement over the management of ''Zion's Watch Tower'' magazine. According to Russell's successor [[Joseph Franklin Rutherford]], she believed that, as his wife, she should have equal control over its administration and equal privilege in writing articles, preaching, and traveling abroad as his representative.&lt;ref&gt;J.F. Rutherford, ''A Great Battle in the Ecclesiastical Heavens'', 1915, pg 17&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903 she filed for legal separation on the grounds of mental cruelty, referring to forced celibacy and frequent cold, indifferent treatment by him. The separation was granted in 1906, with Russell charged to pay alimony.

During the trial Mrs. Russell's attorney alleged that in 1894 Mr. Russell had engaged in "improper intimacy" with Rose Ball, by then a 25-year-old woman. The Russells had cared for her as a foster daughter said to be an orphan. Mrs. Russell alleged that Ball had told her Mr. Russell claimed to be an amorous "jellyfish floating around" to different women until someone responded to his advances. Mr. Russell denied the accusations and said he had never used such language to describe himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Zion's Watch Tower'' July 15, 1906 pg 221: "The next day the husband [Mr. Russell] took the witness stand and swore that he had never used the language (and never had heard of it before) ... and that only an idiotic person would make such an uncomplimentary remark about himself."&lt;/ref&gt; When the judge asked Mrs. Russell if she was accusing her husband of adultery, she replied, "No".&lt;ref&gt;J.F. Rutherford, ''A Great Battle in the Ecclesiastical Heavens'', 1915, pp 18–20&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Washington Post''&lt;ref&gt;''The Washington Post'' May 4, 1906 pg 6, "The Rev. Jellyfish Russell"&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Mission Friend'' of Chicago reprinted the "jellyfish" story while also accusing Russell of immoral conduct. Russell sued the papers for libel; the jury decided in his favor, awarding him one dollar. Following an appeal, Russell received a cash settlement of $15,000 (current value ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|15000|1906|r=-3}}}}) plus court costs, and an agreement that the two papers publish his weekly syndicated sermons as well as a retraction defending his character.&lt;ref&gt;J. Parkinson ''The Bible Student Movement in the Days of CT Russell'', 1975, pg 45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.F. Rutherford, ''A Great Battle in the Ecclesiastical Heavens'', 1915, pg 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Russell v Washington Post Company'' Opinion of the Court, May 5, 1908: "We think the defense of privilege is not applicable to the article published by the defendant. The article is unquestionably libelous ... It is not confined to comment and criticism on his acts as a public man or his public life, but, so far as this record discloses, falsely asserts that he has committed certain acts of an immoral nature in his private life."&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose Ball later married and lived in Australia. As Rose Ball Henninges, she died November 22, 1950 at the age of 81 in [[Melbourne, Australia]]. For several years she had written articles for ''The People's Paper'' and was associated with the Bible Students in Australia until her death.&lt;ref&gt;''Deaths in the District of Melbourne, in Victoria.''

==='Miracle Wheat'===
[[Image:Blemiracle.jpg|thumbnail|right|Miracle wheat (''Triticum turgidum'' var. ''mirabile'')]]
On March 22, 1911, ''The Brooklyn Daily Eagle'' reported that Russell was accused of gaining profit from a strain of wheat named "Miracle Wheat" by K.B. Stoner of [[Fincastle, Virginia]], who claimed to have discovered this strain. Russell sold the wheat for $60 per bushel, far above the average cost of wheat at the time. Throughout 1912 and 1913, the ''Eagle'' continued to report on Russell's alleged fraud. Russell sued the ''Eagle'' for libel, but lost. A government expert investigated the "Miracle Wheat" and said it "was low in the Government tests". Prior to entering the court, the ''Eagle'' declared that "at the trial it will show that "Pastor" Russell's religious cult is nothing more than a money-making scheme."&lt;ref&gt;''The Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', "Miracle Wheat Scandal," January 22, 1913, 2; "Testimony on Wheat," January 23, 1913, 3; "Financial Statements Proving Russell's Absolute Control," by Secretary-Treasurer Van Amberg, January 25, 1913, 16; "Government Experts Testify on 'Miracle Wheat' and Ascertain Its Ordinariness," January 27, 1913, 3; "Prosecution and Defense Closing Arguments," January 28, 1913, 2; "Russell Loses Libel Suit," January 29, 1913, 16 (available on microfilm)&lt;/ref&gt; Russell defended himself publicly, and in writing, claiming that the wheat was donated to the Watch Tower Society. He said that although sold for $1 per pound, Mr. Stoner allegedly routinely sold it for a $1.25 per pound. Russell claimed to have no financial connection to the wheat, and said that no one claimed a refund although he had offered one for up to a year later for any who were dissatisfied with their purchase.&lt;ref&gt;''A Great Battle in the Ecclesiastical Heavens,'' 1915, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the Watch Tower Society stated that gross receipts from the "Miracle Wheat" fundraiser totaled "about $1800" (current value ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1800|1911|r=-3}}}}), of which "Russell himself did not get a penny". It also said that "the Society itself made no claim for the wheat on its own knowledge and the money received went as a donation into Christian missionary work."&lt;ref&gt;"United States of America", ''1975 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', page 71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qualifications===
In June 1912 Rev. J. J. Ross (1871–1935), Pastor of the James Street Baptist Church in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], published and widely distributed a four-page leaflet titled, ''Some Facts about the Self-Styled "Pastor" Charles T. Russell (of Millennial Dawn Fame).'' He alleged that Russell was involved in questionable business practices, had defrauded his estranged wife, and denounced his qualifications, legitimacy and moral example as a Pastor.&lt;ref&gt;''Some Facts about the Self-Styled "Pastor" Charles T. Russell (of Millennial Dawn Fame)'', 1912, pp. 1–3: "By thousands he is believed to be a religious fakir of the worst type&amp;nbsp; ... Years ago he gave himself the title of "Pastor"&amp;nbsp; ... By "The Brooklyn Daily Eagle" he stands charged with&amp;nbsp; ... having his name sensationally connected with those of numerous other women &amp;nbsp; ... with publishing himself as giving addresses to great crowds in important places where he has not spoken at all&amp;nbsp; ... with being illegally connected with lead, asphalt and turpentine companies, with selling or causing to be sold "Miracle Wheat" at $60 a bushel, with influencing the sick and dying to make their wills in his favor&amp;nbsp; ... He is an eccentric individual and judging from his advertisements of himself, many do not think him normal, and some are persuaded that he is self-deceived."&lt;/ref&gt; Russell, in turn, sued Ross for defamatory libel on December 2, 1912.&lt;ref&gt;RG 22-329-0-6742 Record of Indictment: The King v. John Jacob Ross – Defamatory Libel, In the Supreme Court of Ontario, High Court Division and in the Court of Oyer and Terminer and General Gaol Delivery in and for the County of Wentworth, pp. 1,5&lt;/ref&gt; After several delays the case came before Police Court Magistrate G. F. Jelfs on March 17, 1913. During cross-examination Russell said that he had attended public school for seven years, having left when he was about fourteen years of age, after which he received instruction through private tutors.&lt;ref&gt;''The King v. John Jacob Ross,'' cross-examination by King's Counselor George Lynch-Staunton, March 17, 1913, section II, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; He said that he was versed in Latin terms "to an extent" but did not know Hebrew or Greek, that he had never been ordained by any bishop or minister, and had never attended a theological seminary or any schools of higher learning.&lt;ref&gt;''The King v. John Jacob Ross,'' cross-examination by King's Counselor George Lynch-Staunton, March 17, 1913, section II, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/apl/jw/jehwit34.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; The Hamilton and Toronto Ontario newspapers reported the claims made by Ross and provided a brief outline of the court proceedings. They did not refer to any alleged misconduct on the part of Russell. They criticized Ross for having fled Ontario when summoned and not being present during any of the court proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hamilton Spectator,'' Dec. 9, 1912; also Feb. 7, and March 17,18,22 1913&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Toronto Globe,'' March 18, 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 1913 the High Court of Ontario returned a verdict of "No Bill" ruling that Russell was not entitled to damages because, the libel was not likely to result in any violence within Canada.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watch Tower,'' October 15, 1914, p. 286: "The lower Court found him [Ross] guilty of libel. But when the case went to the second Judge he called up an English precedent, in which it was held that criminal libel would only operate in a case where the jury felt sure that there was danger of rioting or violence. As there was no danger that myself or friends would resort to rioting, the case was thrown out."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Great Battle in the Ecclesiastical Heavens, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Following the libel case, Ross published an expanded edition of 48-pages titled, ''Some Facts and More Facts about the Self-Styled "Pastor" Charles T. Russell (of Millennial Dawn Fame)''. In this work, Ross claimed that during the proceedings on March 17, 1913, Russell had repeatedly lied under oath by affirming that he was ordained, but denying the same when cross-examined, by affirming that he knew the Greek language, but when shown by Counselor Staunton an extract from the New Testament in Greek by [[Brooke Foss Westcott|Westcott]] &amp; [[Fenton John Anthony Hort|Hort]], he was unable to recognize it, and that he had not been divorced from his wife, but retracted the statement under cross-examination.&lt;ref&gt;Some Facts and More Facts about the Self-Styled 'Pastor' Charles T. Russell, pp. 18–23&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Russell stated through various printed and public sources that he had never claimed knowledge of the Greek language, merely the alphabet&lt;ref&gt;The Watch Tower, October 15, 1914, p. 286: "As respects my education in Greek and Hebrew: Not only do I not claim very special knowledge of either language, but I claim that not one minister in a thousand is either a Hebrew or a Greek scholar."&lt;/ref&gt; and that early Christians were also criticized by the religious authorities for being unlearned and ignorant.&lt;ref&gt;The Watch Tower, October 15, 1914, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that his ordination was "of God" according to the biblical pattern, not requiring any denominational approval or theological training. He suggested that his annual election as "Pastor" by over 500 congregations worldwide constituted him as properly ordained.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watch Tower,'' December 1, 1915 p. 358–360&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Preaching Publicly and From House to House", ''Jehovah's Witnesses&amp;nbsp;– Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', 1993, WTB&amp;TS, page 560&lt;/ref&gt; Russell contended that Ross and others were attacking him, because they were unable to answer his theological arguments, preferring instead to resort to slander and character assassination.&lt;ref&gt;The Watch Tower, October 15, 1914, p. 287: "What is the secret of the opposition and slander that is being raised up against me and against all who, like me, are Bible students? It is malice, hatred, envy, strife, on the part of those who are still hugging the nonsense of the Dark Ages and neglecting true Bible study. They see that their influence is waning. But they have not yet awakened to the true situation. They think that I am responsible for their smaller congregations and small collections. But not so. The real difficulty for them is that the people are becoming more intelligent and can no longer be driven with the crack of a merely man-made whip of fear."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of Masonic symbolism===
Some have claimed that various symbols Russell employed in his published literature are Masonic in nature, and that such associations implied he engaged in occult activity. In later editions of the ''[[Studies in the Scriptures]]'' series a winged solar disk was stamped on the front cover, a symbol that is also associated with Freemasonry.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} However, Russell's use of the [[Winged sun|winged solar-disk]] originated from his understanding of Malachi 4:2, which denotes a sun with wings, as a symbol that Christ's millennial Kingdom had begun to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Zion's Watch Tower, Dec 1, 1911 pp. 443–444&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics also claim that the pyramid near Russell's gravesite is Masonic,&lt;ref name=pyramid/&gt;&lt;ref name=masonic&gt;[http://www.quotes-watchtower.co.uk/masonic.html ''Masonic''].

In June 1913, during a transcontinental speaking tour, Russell lectured in a Masonic hall in [[San Francisco]], saying: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although I have never been a Mason ... Something I do seems to be the same as Masons do, I don't know what it is; but they often give me all kinds of [[Secret handshake|grips]] and I give them back, then I tell them I don't know anything about it except just a few grips that have come to me naturally.&lt;ref&gt;Sermon title: "The Temple of God", ''Convention Report Sermons'' pages 359–365, "But now I am talking about this great order of masonry of which Jesus is the Grand Master. This Order is to be entered in a peculiar way. There are certain conditions, the low gate, the narrow way, the difficult path. Although I have never been a Mason, I have heard that in Masonry they have something which very closely illustrates all of this."

Throughout his ministry he said that he believed Christian identity is incompatible with Freemasonry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastor-russell.com/life/mason1.html |title=Was Pastor Russell a Freemason? |publisher=Pastor-russell.com |date= |access-date=2013-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described Freemasonry, [[Knights of Pythias]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], and other such groups as "grievous evils" and "unclean".&lt;ref&gt;''Zion's Watch Tower,'' June 1895, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New Creation,'' pages 580–581&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Neolithic sites in Iran.jpg|thumb|Neolithic sites in Iran]]
'''Chia Jani''' is an [[archaeology|archaeological]] site  in Iran, located along the [[Qouchemi]] stream, which flows to the [[Ravand River]] about {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} south, in south central part of the [[Islamabad Plain]] in the Central-West [[Zagros Mountains]].

==Excavation==
The site was discovered by [[Kamyar Abdi]] during his archaeological surveys in the plain in 1999. This site dates to the Early ([[Aceramic Neolithic|Aceramic]]) and Middle [[Neolithic period]]. Parts of the site are washed off by the Qouchemi stream and damaged due to expansion of agricultural land. Its lithic industry is characterized by [[Bladelet (archaeology)|bladelet]] production which some are made from [[obsidian]]. Other notable material include the so-called "tad pole ware" of the Middle Neolithic period and Plano-convex bricks reported from Early to Middle Neolithic sites in the region, including Sarab and Ganj Darreh to the east and Jarmo to the west.

Plans for excavations at Chia Jani, funded by a grant from the [[National Geographic Society]], came to a halt with the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] that rendered Islamabad Plain, only {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Iraqi border, unsafe for an international archaeological expedition.

==Career==
Barratt studied [[civil engineering]] at the [[University of Portsmouth]],&lt;ref name="Telg1"/&gt; and whilst doing so, became more interested in [[mechanical engineering]].

On graduation she worked at the [[Chiltern Open Air Museum]], the [[Royal Armouries]] and the [[British Engineerium]], where she remains a consultant engineer. It was from here that her television career was launched when she appeared on [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Salvage Squad]]'' – a programme about restoring historical machinery – first as a participant, later as co-presenter. Whilst filming, she completed a [[master's degree]] in [[Architectural conservation|Conservation]] of [[Industrial Heritage]] and won the [[Association for Industrial Archaeology]] Student Fieldwork Award.

Presently a freelance consultant industrial archaeologist, Barratt has restored and run many different vehicles, and is currently restoring a [[watermill]] in [[Cornwall]]. She is a member of Subterranea Britannica, a society which studies and records man-made underground sites.

==Personal life==
Barratt is married to Ben, and the pair have two daughters and a pet dog.&lt;ref name="Telg1"&gt;{{cite news

'''Din Dryfol''' is a [[Neolithic]] [[burial chamber]] on [[Anglesey]], in [[Wales]]. It is a scheduled monument and is maintained by [[Cadw]].&lt;ref name=BE/&gt; The monument is near [[Bethel, Anglesey|Bethel]]. Three phases of use have been identified, all dating from the [[Neolithic British Isles|Neolithic]] period.&lt;ref name=gat&gt;{{watprn|GAT|2528|title=Din Dryfol Burial Chamber, Cerrigceinwen}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is 

==Burial chamber==
Din Dryfol is the remains of a burial chamber, part of a [[passage grave]], a neolithic structure erected in several stages, and a type of burial structure more frequently found in Ireland than in Wales. The first part may have been constructed about 5,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=BE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britainexpress.com/attractions.htm?attraction=4673 |title=Din Dryfol Chambered Tomb |publisher=Britain Express |accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[dolmen]] is located on a level platform on the flank of a small hill and is oriented northeast to southwest. Excavations in the 1960s and 1970s have identified the different phases of the development. The first chamber was constructed with side slabs and a capstone, making a rectangular box some {{convert|3|by|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and about {{convert|2|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall. This is the main structure that can be seen today, the capstone having slipped to one side to rest upon the ground. The second chamber was constructed to the northeast of this, and nothing remains of it now. However two post holes show where a wooden portal or some other structure stood. The third chamber was built to the northeast of the second one. It was about {{convert|5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long and parts are still visible in the form of a small upright, a large portal stone standing {{convert|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high and some way away from the other stones, and a stone stump, perhaps the remains of another portal. The whole structure would have been covered with a mound of earth or rubble, probably small and circular over the original chamber, but much longer and rather wider when all three chambers had been constructed. Although this mound has disappeared, excavations suggest that it stretched for about {{convert|65|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} and was about {{convert|15|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} wide.&lt;ref name=Stonecircles&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stone-circles.org.uk/stone/dindryfol.htm |title=Din Dryfol |publisher=Stone-circles.org.uk |accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations have revealed pieces of pottery and cremation sites.&lt;ref name=BE/&gt;

==Disturbance and Excavation==
The site showed evidence of disturbance during the Roman period, with [[Roman Britain|Romano-British]] pottery unearthed during the 1970s excavations. It was also affected by road-building in the 18th and 19th century, when here was quarrying in the area. There is now no sign of a cairn or mound.&lt;ref name=cadw&gt;{{watprn|Cadw|2506|title=SAM AN008: Din Dryfol Burial Chamber}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monument was recorded in 1871 by H Pritchard, and excavated by F Lynch, firstly in 1969 to 1970 and again in 1980, which identified the phases of construction.&lt;ref name=cadw/&gt; Wooden entrance posts to the second of three chambers, to the east of the earlier structure, were also identified.&lt;ref name=gat/&gt;

[[File:Cameo prince Louvre MR54.jpg|thumb|[[Cameo (carving)|Cameo]] of a Roman prince]]
An '''engraved gem''', frequently referred to as an '''intaglio''', is a small and usually [[semi-precious]] [[gemstone]] that has been carved, in the Western tradition normally with images or inscriptions only on one face.&lt;ref&gt;Fully half of the antique engraved gems in the [[Berlin museums]] and the [[British Museum]] are either [[sard]] or [[carnelian]], Etta M. Saunders, noted. Saunders, "Goddess Riding a Goat-Bull Monster: A Ceres Zodiac Gem from the Walters Art Gallery" ''The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery'' '''49/50''' (1991/1992;7-11) note 19&lt;/ref&gt; The [[engraving]] of gemstones was a major luxury art form in the [[Ancient history|Ancient world,]] and an important one in some later periods.&lt;ref&gt;The three preeminent European collections of post-Classical engraved gems are the [[Cabinet des Médailles]] at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque nationale]], Paris, the Habsburg collection, Vienna, and the [[British Museum]], London, [[Ormonde Maddock Dalton|O. M. Dalton]] observed in "Mediæval and Later Engraved Gems in the British Museum — I" ''The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs'' '''23''' No. 123 (June 1913:128-136) and "II" ''The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs'' '''24''' No. 127 (October 1913:28-32).&lt;/ref&gt;

Strictly speaking, ''engraving'' means carving ''in intaglio'' (with the design cut ''into'' the flat background of the stone), but [[relief]] carvings (with the design projecting ''out of'' the background as in nearly all [[cameo (carving)|cameos]]) are also covered by the term. This article uses ''cameo'' in its strict sense, to denote a carving exploiting layers of differently coloured stone. The activity is also called ''gem carving'' and the artists ''gem-cutters''. References to antique gems and intaglios in a [[jewellery]] context will almost always mean carved gems; when referring to [[monumental sculpture]], [[counter-relief]], meaning the same as ''intaglio'', is more likely to be used. Vessels like the [[Cup of the Ptolemies]] and heads or figures carved in the round are also known as ''[[hardstone carving]]s''.

'''Glyptics''' or ''glyptic art'' covers the field of small carved stones, including [[cylinder seal]]s and inscriptions, especially in an archaeological context. Though they were keenly collected in antiquity, most carved gems originally functioned as [[seal (insignia)|seals]], often mounted in a ring; intaglio designs register most clearly when viewed by the recipient of a letter as an impression in hardened wax. A finely carved seal was practical, as it made forgery more difficult – the distinctive personal [[signature]] did not really exist in antiquity.

==Technique==
Gems were mostly cut by using abrasive powder from harder stones in conjunction with a hand-drill, probably often set in a [[lathe]]. [[Emery (mineral)|Emery]] has been mined for abrasive powder on [[Naxos island|Naxos]] since antiquity. Some early types of seal were cut by hand, rather than a drill, which does not allow fine detail. There is no evidence that magnifying lenses were used by gem cutters in antiquity. A medieval guide to gem-carving techniques survives from [[Theophilus Presbyter]]. Byzantine cutters used a flat-edged wheel on a drill for intaglio work, while Carolingian ones used round-tipped drills; it is unclear where they learnt this technique from. In intaglio gems at least, the recessed cut surface is usually very well preserved, and microscopic examination is revealing of the technique used.&lt;ref&gt;Kornbluth, 8-16 [https://books.google.com/books?id=8bWo5T2JdVUC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=Engraved+gem&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Engraved%20gem&amp;f=false quotes passages] from Theophilius and others, and discusses various techniques. See Theophilius's article for full on-line texts.&lt;/ref&gt; The colour of several gemstones can be enhanced by a number of artificial methods, using heat, sugar and dyes. Many of these can be shown to have been used since antiquity – since the 7th millennium BC in the case of heating.&lt;ref&gt;Thoresen, "Gemstone enhancement"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Cylinder seal antelope Louvre AM1639.jpg|thumb|Antelopes attacked by birds: [[cylinder seal]] in [[hematite]] and its impression. Late Bronze Age II (maybe 14th century BC), from [[Cyprus]] in the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] period, following Near Eastern precedents.]]
The technique has an ancient tradition in the [[Near East]], and is represented in all or most early cultures from the area, and the [[Indus Valley civilization]]. The [[cylinder seal]], whose design only appears when rolled over damp clay, from which the flat ring type developed, was the usual form in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Assyria]] and other cultures, and spread to the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan world]], including parts of [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]]. These were made in various types of stone, not all hardstone. The Greek tradition emerged in [[Ancient Greek art]] under Minoan influence on mainland [[Helladic]] culture, and reached an apogee of subtlety and refinement in the [[Hellenistic period]]. Pre-[[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Hellenic]] [[Ancient Egypt]]ian seals tend to have inscriptions in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] rather than images. The Biblical [[Book of Exodus]] describes the form of the [[hoshen]], a ceremonial breastplate worn by the High Priest, bearing twelve gems engraved with the names of the [[Twelve tribes of Israel]].

Round or oval Greek gems (along with similar objects in bone and ivory) are found from the 8th and 7th centuries BC, usually with animals in energetic geometric poses, often with a border marked by dots or a rim.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 39 See Beazley for more detail.&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples are mostly in softer stones. Gems of the 6th century are more often oval,&lt;ref&gt;"Lenticular" or "lentoid" gems have the form of a [[lens (geometry)|lens]].&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[Scarab (artifact)|scarab]] back (in the past this type was called a "scarabaeus"), and human or divine figures as well as animals; the scarab form was apparently adopted from [[Phoenicia]].&lt;ref&gt;Beazley, Later Archaic Greek gems: introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; The forms are sophisticated for the period, despite the usually small size of the gems.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 68-69&lt;/ref&gt; In the 5th century gems became somewhat larger, but still only 2-3 centimetres tall. Despite this, very fine detail is shown, including the eyelashes on one male head, perhaps a portrait. Four gems signed by [[Dexamenos]] of [[Chios]] are the finest of the period, two showing [[heron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 129-130&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Scarab satyr BM Gem 465.jpg|thumb|Reclining [[satyr]], [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] c. 550 BC, 2.2 cm wide. Note the vase shown "sideways"; it is characteristic of early gems that not all elements in the design are read from the same direction of view.]]

Relief carving became common in 5th century BC Greece, and gradually most of the spectacular carved gems in the Western tradition were in relief, although the [[Sassanian]] and other traditions remained faithful to the intaglio form. Generally a relief image is more impressive than an intaglio one; in the earlier form the recipient of a document saw this in the impressed sealing wax, while in the later reliefs it was the owner of the seal who kept it for himself, probably marking the emergence of gems meant to be collected or worn as [[jewellery]] [[pendant]]s in necklaces and the like, rather than used as seals – later ones are sometimes rather large to use to seal letters. However inscriptions are usually still in reverse ("mirror-writing") so they only read correctly on impressions (or by viewing from behind with transparent stones). This aspect also partly explains the collecting of impressions in plaster or wax from gems, which may be easier to appreciate than the original.

The cameo, which is rare in intaglio form, seems to have reached Greece around the 3rd century; the [[Farnese Tazza]] is the only major surviving Hellenistic example (depending on the date assigned to the [[Gonzaga Cameo]] – see below), but other [[Glass casting|glass-paste]] imitations with portraits suggest that gem-type cameos were made in this period.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 187-188&lt;/ref&gt; The conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] had opened up new trade routes to the Greek world and increased the range of gemstones available.&lt;ref&gt;Beazley,
"Hellenistic gems: introduction"&lt;/ref&gt; Roman gems generally continued [[Hellenistic]] styles, and can be hard to date, until their quality sharply declines at the end of the 2nd century AD. Philosophers are sometimes shown; [[Cicero]] refers to people having portraits of their favourite on their cups and rings.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 275-6&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans invented [[cameo glass]], best known from the [[Portland Vase]], as a cheaper material for cameos, and one that allowed consistent and predictable layers on even round objects.
[[File:Aachen Germany Domschatz Cross-of-Lothair-01.jpg|thumb|There are several antique and medieval engraved gems on the [[Ottonian]] [[Cross of Lothair]] (base later). Many antique engraved gems survived in such contexts]]

During the European [[Middle Ages]] antique engraved gems were one classical art form which was always highly valued, and a large but unknown number of ancient gems have (unlike most surviving classical works of art) never been buried and then excavated. Gems were used to decorate elaborate pieces of goldsmith work such as [[votive crown]]s, book-covers and crosses, sometimes very inappropriately given their subject matter. [[Matthew Paris]] illustrated a number of gems owned by [[St Albans Abbey]], including one large Late Roman imperial [[Cameo (carving)|cameo]] (now lost) called ''Kaadmau'' which was used to induce overdue childbirths – it was slowly lowered, with a prayer to St Alban, on its chain down the woman's cleavage, as it was believed that the infant would flee downwards to escape it,&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 112-113&lt;/ref&gt; a belief in accordance with the views of the "father of mineralogy", [[Georgius Agricola]] (1494–1555) on [[jasper]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qNOB-vcob88C&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=poison+gemstone&amp;ei=Xqm6SvHiA4XgywSgscnvDg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false De Natura fossilium Bk 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Some gems were engraved, mostly with religious scenes in intaglio, during the period both in [[Byzantium]] and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Examples: [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/came/ho_40.20.59.htm 14th century French Crucifixion], [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bnpr/ho_1975.1.1522.htm Rosary pendant, 15th century], both onyx and in the MMA New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West production revived from the [[Carolingian art|Carolingian period]], when [[rock crystal]] was the commonest material. The [[Lothair Crystal]] (or ''Suzanna Crystal'', [[British Museum]], 11.5&amp;nbsp;cm diameter), clearly not designed for use as a seal, is the best known of 20 surviving Carolingian large intaglio gems with complex figural scenes, although most were used for seals.&lt;ref&gt;Kornbluth, 1, 4. [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/t/the_lothar,_or_susanna_crystal.aspx Susanna Crystal], British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Several crystals were designed, like the ''Susanna Crystal'', to be viewed through the gem from the unengraved side, so their inscriptions were reversed like the seals. In wills and inventories, engraved gems were often given pride of place at the head of a list of treasures.&lt;ref&gt;Kornbluth, 1, 4-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Some gems in a remarkably effective evocation of classical style were made in [[Southern Italy]] for the court of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] in the first half of the 13th century, several in the [[Cabinet des Médailles]] in Paris. Meanwhile, the church led the development of large, often double-sided, metal seal matrices for wax seals that were left permanently attached to [[charter]]s and similar legal documents, dangling by a cord, though smaller ring seals that were broken when a letter was opened remained in use. It is not clear to what extent this also continued practices in the ancient world.

==Renaissance revival==
[[File:Nicolo intaglio warriors CdM Paris.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Warrior]] supporting dying comrade. 1st century BC or AD.]]
The late medieval French and Burgundian courts collected and commissioned gems, and began to use them for portraits. The British Museum has what is probably a seated portrait of [[John, Duke of Berry]] in intaglio on a [[sapphire]], and the Hermitage has a cameo head of [[Charles VII of France]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 411&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest had also revived in [[Early Renaissance]] Italy, where [[Venice]] soon became a particular centre of production. Along with the Roman statues and [[sarcophagi]] being newly excavated, antique gems were prime sources for artists eager to regain a classical figurative vocabulary. Cast bronze copies of gems were made, which circulated around Italy, and later Europe.&lt;ref name=draper&gt;Draper, James David. "Cameo Appearances". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/came/hd_came.htm (August 2008)]
&lt;/ref&gt; Among very many examples of borrowings that can be traced confidently, the ''Felix'' or ''Diomedes'' gem owned by [[Lorenzo il Magnifico]] (see below), with an unusual pose, was copied by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and may well have provided the "starting point" for one of [[Michelangelo]]'s ''ignudi'' on the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]].&lt;ref&gt;Claire [[Kenneth Clark|Clark, Kenneth]] in J.

By the 16th century carved and engraved gems were keenly collected across Europe for dedicated sections of a [[cabinet of curiosities]], and their production revived, in classical styles; 16th-century gem-cutters working with the same types of [[sardonyx]] and other hardstones and using virtually the same techniques, produced classicizing works of glyptic art, often intended as forgeries, in such quantity that they compromised the market for them, as [[Gisela Richter]] observed in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;"Nowadays, however, they have been somewhat neglected—probably because a genuine gem is difficult to distinguish from forged one, and collectors have grown timid in consequence" (Richter, "Engraved Gems" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', '''17'''.9 (September 1922:193-196) p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--(Can any editor retrieve the article that discusses this?) Forgeries of Minoan engraved hardstone seals designed to draw the generation of [[Sir Arthur Evans]] complicate the study of the genuine ones.--&gt; Even today, Sir [[John Boardman (art historian)|John Boardman]] admits that "We are sometimes at a loss to know whether what we are looking at belongs to the 1st or the 15th century AD, a sad confession for any art-historian."&lt;ref name="Boardman lecture"&gt;Beazley, [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/archive/lectures/boardman.htm Boardman lecture]&lt;/ref&gt; Other Renaissance gems reveal their date by showing mythological scenes derived from literature that were not part of the visual repertoire in classical times, or borrowing compositions from Renaissance paintings, and using "compositions with rather more figures than any ancient engraver would have tolerated or attempted".&lt;ref name="Boardman lecture"/&gt; Among artists, the wealthy [[Rubens]] was a notable collector.&lt;ref&gt;Getty, [http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/gems/collectors.html Collectors]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallel traditions==
Engraved gems occur in the [[Bible]], especially when the [[hoshen]] and [[ephod]] worn by the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] are described; though these were inscribed with the names of the [[tribes of Israel]] in letters, rather than any images. A few identifiably Jewish gems survive from the classical world, including Persia, mostly with the owner's name in Hebrew, but some with symbols such as the [[menorah (Temple)|menorah]].&lt;ref&gt;Beazley Archive, "Late Antique, Early Christian and Jewish gems: Sasanian gems – Christian and Jewish"&lt;/ref&gt; Many gems are inscribed in the Islamic world, typically with verses from the [[Koran]], and sometimes gems in the Western tradition just contain inscriptions.

Many Asian and Middle Eastern cultures have their own traditions, although for example the important Chinese tradition of carved gemstones and hardstones, especially [[Chinese jade|jade carving]], is broader than the European one of concentration on a flattish faced stone that might fit into a ring. [[Seal engraving (art)|Seal engraving]] covers the inscription that is printed by stamping, which nearly always only contains script rather than images. [[Seal sculpture (art)|Other decoration]] of the seal itself was not intended to be reproduced.

==Iconography==
[[File:Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna June 2006 031.jpg|thumb|the [[Gemma Augustea]] cameo, in two layered [[onyx]]; 19 × 23 cm.]]
The iconography of gems is similar to that of coins, though more varied. Early gems mostly show animals. Gods, [[satyr]]s, and mythological scenes were common, and famous statues often represented – much modern knowledge of the poses of lost Greek cult statues such as [[Athena Promachos]] comes from the study of gems, which often have clearer images than coins.&lt;ref&gt;[[Numismatic]] evidence is the other most indicative evidence of the general pose of locally important [[cult image]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; A 6th(?) century BC Greek gem already shows [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] committing suicide, with his name inscribed.&lt;ref&gt;Beazley, [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/gems/styles/geometric/island.htm Geometric and Early Archaic gems: Island gems] 6th down.&lt;/ref&gt; The story of [[Heracles]] was, as in other arts, the most common source of narrative subjects. A scene may be intended as the subject of an [[Archaic Greece|early Archaic]] gem, and certainly appears on 6th century examples from the later Archaic period.&lt;ref&gt;Beazley, Archaic period pages&lt;/ref&gt;

Portraits of monarchs are found from the Hellenistic period onwards, although as they do not usually have identifying inscriptions, many fine ones cannot be identified with a subject. In the Roman Imperial period, portraits of the imperial family were often produced for the court circle, and many of these have survived, especially a number of spectacular cameos from the time of [[Augustus]]. As private objects, produced no doubt by artists trained in the tradition of Hellenistic monarchies, their iconography is less inhibited than the public state art of the period about showing divine attributes as well as sexual matters.&lt;ref&gt;Hennig, 154-5. [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/c/cameo_portrait_of_augustus.aspx British Museum] on the [[Blacas Cameo]] of Augustus.&lt;/ref&gt; The identity and interpretation of figures in the [[Gemma Augustea]] remains unclear. A number of gems from the same period contain scenes apparently from the lost epic on the [[Iliou persis|Sack of Troy]], of which the finest is by Dioskurides ([[Chatsworth House]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hennig, 153, Boardman, 275-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Renaissance and later gems remain dominated by the Hellenistic repertoire of subjects, though portraits in contemporary styles were also produced.

==Collectors==
[[File:Coupe des Ptolémées 01.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Coupe des Ptolémées]] ([[Cabinet des Médailles]], Paris)]]

Famous collectors begin with King [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] (d. 63 BC), whose collection was part of the booty of [[Pompey the Great]], who donated it to the Temple of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, see below. Whether he was right to claim Mithridates as the first collector is dubious.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Caesar]] was determined to excel Pompey in this as in other areas, and later gave six collections to his own [[Temple of Venus Genetrix]]; according to [[Suetonius]] gems were among his varied collecting passions.&lt;ref&gt;''De Vita Caesarum, Divus Iulius'', (The Lives of the Caesars, The Deified Julius), [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/suetonius-julius.html Fordham online text]&lt;/ref&gt; Many later emperors also collected gems. Chapters 4-6 of Book 37 of the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]] give a summary art history of the Greek and Roman tradition, and of Roman collecting. According to Pliny [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (praetor 56 BC)]] was the first Roman collector.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'', xxxvii.5&lt;/ref&gt;

As in later periods objects carved in the round from semi-precious stone were regarded as a similar category of object; these are also known as [[hardstone carving]]s.  One of the largest, the ''[[Coupe des Ptolémées]]'' was probably donated to the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], near Paris, by [[Charles the Bald]], as the inscription on its former gem-studded gold Carolingian mounting stated; it may have belonged to [[Charlemagne]]. One of the best collections of such vessels, though mostly plain without carved decoration, was looted from [[Constantinople]] in the [[Fourth Crusade]], and is in the Treasury of the [[Basilica of San Marco]] in [[Venice]]. Many of these retain the medieval mounts which adapted them for liturgical use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanities-interactive.org/medieval/sanmarco/ Treasury of San Marco]&lt;/ref&gt; Like the ''Coupe des Ptolémées'', most objects in European museums lost these when they became objects of classicist interest from the Renaissance onwards, or when the mounts were removed for the value of the materials, as happened to many in the [[French Revolution]].
[[File:Cameo gonzaga.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Gonzaga Cameo]], carved of Indian [[sardonyx]] ([[Hermitage Museum]], [[St. Petersburg]]) The gem measures 15.7 × 11.8 cm.]]

The collection of 827 engraved gems of [[Pope Paul II]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/gems/collectors.html Getty Collectors, under Pietro Barbó]&lt;/ref&gt; which included the "Felix gem" of [[Diomedes]] with the [[Palladium (classical antiquity)|Palladium]],&lt;ref&gt;It passed into the [[Arundel marbles|Arundel collection]] and came to Oxford: see [http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/objectofmonth/2004-10/history.htm Ashmolean image and description] and Graham Pollard, "The Felix Gem at Oxford and its provenance" ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''119''' No. 893 (August 1977:574).&lt;/ref&gt; was acquired by [[Lorenzo il Magnifico]]; the [[Medici]] collection included many other gems and was legendary, valued in inventories much higher than his [[Botticelli]]s. Somewhat like Chinese collectors, Lorenzo had all his gems inscribed with his name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521452458&amp;ss=exc Online: The ''Introduction'' from ''Lorenzo de'Medici, Collector of Antiquities{{'}}'', by Laurie Fusco &amp; Gino Corti, Cambridge UP 2006, which gives a survey of early Renaissance collecting in general. On his signing his gems see Draper]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gonzaga Cameo]] passed through a series of famous collections before coming to rest in the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]]. First known in the collection of [[Isabella d'Este]], it passed to the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] [[Dukes of Mantua]], [[Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Rudolf II]], Queen [[Christina of Sweden]], Cardinal [[Decio Azzolini]], [[Livio Odescalchi]], Duke of [[Bracciano]], and Pope [[Pius VI]] before [[Napoleon]] carried it off to Paris, where his [[Empress Joséphine]] gave it to [[Alexander I of Russia]] after Napoleon's downfall, as a token of goodwill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cammeogonzaga.it/eng/art-exhibitions-Italy.asp Gonzaga Cameo] Exhibition in Mantua [http://ancientrome.ru/art/artworken/img.htm?id=882 further details]&lt;/ref&gt; It remains disputed whether the cameo is [[Alexandria]]n work of the 3rd century BC, or a [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|Julio-Claudian]] imitation of the style from the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cammeogonzaga.it/eng/Gonzaga-cameo-hermitage.asp Mantua exhibition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the largest cameo gems from antiquity were created for members of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] and seem to have survived above ground since antiquity. The large [[Gemma Augustea]] appeared in 1246 in the treasury of the [[Basilique St-Sernin, Toulouse]]. In 1533, [[Francis I of France|King François I]] appropriated it and moved it to Paris, where it soon disappeared around 1590. Not long thereafter it was fenced for 12,000 gold pieces to Emperor Rudolph II; it remains in [[Vienna]], alongside the [[Gemma Claudia]]. The largest flat engraved gem known from antiquity is the [[Great Cameo of France]], which entered (or re-entered) the French royal collection in 1791 from the treasury of [[Sainte-Chapelle]], where it had been since at least 1291.

In England, a false dawn of gem collecting was represented by [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]]' purchase of the cabinet of the Flemish antiquary [[Abraham Gorlaeus]] in 1609,&lt;ref&gt;Roy Strong, ''Henry Prince of Wales and England's Lost Renaissance'' (1986:199).&lt;/ref&gt; and engraved gems featured among the antiquities assembled by [[Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel]]. Later in the century [[William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire]], formed a collection of gems that is still conserved at [[Chatsworth, Derbyshire|Chatsworth]].&lt;ref&gt;Diana Scarisbrick, "The Devonshire Parure", ''Archaeologia'' '''108''' (1986:241).&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighteenth century a more discerning cabinet of gems was assembled by [[Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle]], acting upon the advice of Francesco Maria Zanetti and [[Francesco Ficoroni]]; 170 of the Carlisle gems, both Classical and post-Classical, were purchased in 1890 for the [[British Museum]].

By the mid-eighteenth century prices had reached such a level that major collections could only be formed by the very wealthy; lesser collectors had to make do with collecting [[plaster cast]]s,&lt;ref&gt;"Sulphurs" provided even finer detail; [[James Tassie]] made a career of casting gems in plaster and in coloured opaque glass.&lt;/ref&gt; which was also very popular, or buying one of many sumptuously illustrated catalogues of collections that were published.&lt;ref&gt;Apart from those mentioned below, there is information on other notable collections [http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/gems/collectors.html from the Getty Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catherine the Great]]'s collection is in the [[Hermitage Museum]]; one large collection she had bought was the gems from the [[Orléans Collection]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/04/b2003/hm4_1_i.html Hermitage Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis XV of France]] hired [[Dominique Vivant]] to assemble a collection for [[Madame de Pompadour]].

[[File:Brit Mus 13sept10 brooches etc 068.jpg|thumb|Casts ("pastes") of gems in collector's cabinets]]
In the eighteenth century British aristocrats were able to outcompete even the agents for royal and princely collectors on the Continent, aided by connoisseur-dealers like Count [[Antonio Maria Zanetti]] and [[Philipp von Stosch]]. Zanetti travelled Europe in pursuit of gems hidden in private collections for the British aristocrats he tutored in connoisseurship;&lt;ref&gt;His correspondence with [[Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle]] is published by Diana Scarisbrick, "Gem Connoisseurship – The 4th Earl of Carlisle's Correspondence with Francesco de Ficoroni and Antonion Maria Zanetti", ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''129'''No. 1007 (February 1987:90-104).&lt;/ref&gt; his own collection was described in [[Antonio Francesco Gori|A.F. Gori]], ''Le gemme antiche di Anton Maria Zanetti'' (Venice, 1750), illustrated with eighty plates of engravings from his own drawings. Baron [[Philipp von Stosch]] (1691–1757), a Prussian who lived in Rome and then Florence, was a major collector, as well as a dealer in engraved gems: "busy, unscrupulous, and in his spare time a spy for England in Italy".&lt;ref&gt;Beazley, Boardman Lecture&lt;/ref&gt; Among his contemporaries, Stosch made his lasting impression with ''Gemmæ Antiquæ Cælatæ'' (''Pierres antiques graveés'') (1724), in which [[Bernard Picart]]'s engravings reproduced seventy antique carved hardstones like onyx, jasper and carnelian from European collections. He also encouraged [[Johann Lorenz Natter]] (1705–1763) whom Stosch set to copying ancient carved gems in Florence. [[Frederick the Great]] of [[Prussia]] bought Stosch's collection in 1765 and built the [[Antique Temple]] in the park of the [[Sanssouci Palace]] to house his collections of ancient sculpture, coins and over 4,000 gems – the two were naturally often grouped together. The gems are now in the [[Antikensammlung Berlin]].
[[File:VishnuGandhara.JPG|thumb|left|[[Vishnu Nicolo Seal]] is a cast of sardonyx seal representing Vishnu blessing a worshipper, Afghanistan or Pakistan, 4th-6th century CE. The inscription in cursive Bactrian reads: "Mikira, Vishnu and Shiva"]]

The collection of [[Joseph Smith (1682–1770)|Joseph Smith]], British [[consul]] in [[Venice]] was bought by [[George III of England]] and remains in the [[Royal Collection]]. The collections of [[Charles Towneley]], [[Richard Payne Knight]] and [[Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode]] were bought by or bequeathed to the [[British Museum]], founding their very important collection.&lt;ref&gt;Towneley's were bought from his heirs, the others bequeathed. See King, 218-225 for a selection of highlights&lt;/ref&gt; But the most famous English collection was that formed by the [[George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough|4th Duke of Marlborough]] (1739–1817), "which the Duke kept in his bedroom and resorted to as a relief from his ambitious wife, his busy sister and his many children".&lt;ref&gt;Beazley, [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/gems/marlborough/default.htm Marlborough Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; This included collections formerly owned by the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]]s of [[Mantua]] (later owned by Lord Arundel), [[William Ponsonby, 2nd Earl of Bessborough|the 2nd Earl of Bessborough]], and the brother of [[Lord Chesterfield]], who himself warned his son in one of his ''Letters'' against "days lost in poring upon imperceptible intaglios and cameos".&lt;ref name="beazley.ox.ac.uk"&gt;Beazley, ''The Marlborough Gems'', [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/archive/lectures/boardman.htm Boardman Lecture].&lt;/ref&gt; The collection, including its single most famous cameo, ''the'' "[[Marlborough gem]]" depicting an initiation of Cupid and Psyche, was dispersed after a sale in 1899, fortunately timed for the new American museums and provided the core of the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan]] in New York and elsewhere,&lt;ref name=draper/&gt; with the largest group still together being about 100 in the [[Walters Art Museum]], Baltimore.&lt;ref name="beazley.ox.ac.uk"/&gt;

Prince [[Stanisław Poniatowski (1754-1833)|Stanisław Poniatowski]] (1754–1833) "commissioned about 2500 gems and encouraged the belief that they were, in fact, ancient." He presented a set of 419 plaster impressions of his collection to the King of [[Prussia]] which now form the Daktyliothek Poniatowski in [[Berlin]], where they were recognised as modern in 1832, mainly because the signatures of ancient artists from very different times were found on gems in too consistent a style.&lt;ref&gt;Beazley, [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/gems/poniatowski/default.htm The Poniatowski Collection of gems].

==Artists==
[[File:The Punishment of Tityus, a rock crystal intaglio by Giovanni Bernardi, the British Museum.jpg|thumb|''The Punishment of [[Tityos|Tityus]]'', a rock crystal intaglio by [[Giovanni Bernardi]].]]
As in other fields, not many ancient artists' names are known from literary sources, although some gems are signed. According to Pliny, [[Pyrgoteles]] was the only artist allowed to carve gems for the seal rings of [[Alexander the Great]]. Most of the most famous Roman artists were Greeks, like Dioskurides, who is thought to have produced the Gemma Augustea, and is recorded as the artist of the matching [[signet ring]]s of [[Augustus]] – very carefully controlled, they allowed orders to be issued in his name by his most trusted associates. Other works survive signed by him (rather more than are all likely to be genuine), and his son Hyllos was also a gem engraver.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 275-6. Hennig 153-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anichini family]] were leading artists in Venice and elsewhere in the 15th and 16th centuries. Many Renaissance artists no doubt kept their activities quiet, as they were passing their products off as antique. Other specialist carvers included [[Giovanni Bernardi]] (1494–1553), [[Giovanni Jacopo Caraglio]] (c. 1500–1565), [[Giuseppe Antonio Torricelli]] (1662–1719), the German-Italian [[Anton Pichler]] (1697–1779) and his sons [[Giovanni Pichler|Giovanni]] and [[Luigi Pichler|Luigi]], [[Charles Christian Reisen]] (Anglo-Norwegian, 1680–1725). Other sculptors also carved gems, or had someone in their workshop who did. [[Leone Leoni]] said he personally spent two months on a double-sided cameo gem with portraits of [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]] and his wife and son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/came/ho_38.150.9.htm Metropolitan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scot [[James Tassie]] (1735–1799), and his nephew [[William Tassie|William]] (1777–1860) developed methods for taking hard impressions from old gems, and also for casting new designs from carved wax in [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], enabling a huge production of what are really imitation engraved gems. The fullest catalogue of his impressions ("Tassie gems") was published in 1791, with 15,800 items.&lt;ref&gt;An earlier version is on [https://books.google.com/books?id=f-kHAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=A+Catalogue,+Of+Impressions+In+Sulphur:+Of+Antique+And+Modern+Gems+From+Which+Pastes+Are+Made+And+Sold&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ltoEkw81eM&amp;sig=iuByBRDFZjRcKrKd8bFMUezGgiE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=l7SvSoO6N4af4gahtcTzBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Google books] ''A Catalogue, Of Impressions In Sulphur: Of Antique And Modern Gems From Which Pastes Are Made And Sold'' (1775) ({{ISBN|110459093X}} / 1-104-59093-X)&lt;/ref&gt; There are complete sets of the impressions in the Hermitage, the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] in London, and in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Beazley, [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/gems/tassie/default.htm Tassie]&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of imitation became fashionable for ladies' [[brooch]]es, such as [[ceramic art|ceramic]] cameos by [[Josiah Wedgwood]] in [[jasperware]]. The engraved gem fell permanently out of fashion from about the 1860s,&lt;ref name=draper/&gt; perhaps partly as a growing realization of the number of gems that were not what they seemed to be scared collectors. Among the last practitioners was [[James Robertson (photographer)|James Robertson]], who sensibly moved into the new art of [[photography]]. Perhaps the best known gem engraver of the 20th century, working in a contemporary idiom, is the British artist [[Ronald Pennell]],&lt;ref&gt;Significant Figures in Art &amp; Craft Today, Derek Reay, MoTi publishing, UK 2011&lt;/ref&gt; whose work is held in the British [[Crafts Council]] Collection among many others.

==Imitations==
[[File:Portland Vase BM Gem4036 n4.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Portland Vase]] in Roman [[cameo glass]] in imitation of [[onyx]].]]
[[Cameo glass]] was invented by the Romans in about 30BC to imitate engraved hardstone cameos, with the advantage that consistent layering could be achieved even on round vessels – impossible with natural gemstones. It was however very difficult to manufacture and surviving pieces, mostly famously the [[Portland Vase]], are actually much rarer than Roman gemstone cameos.&lt;ref&gt;Trentinella, Rosemarie. "Roman Cameo Glass". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–9. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rcam/hd_rcam.htm link] (October 2003, retr. 16 September, 2009); Whitehouse, David. ''Roman glass in the Corning Museum of Glass'', Volume 1 [[Corning Museum of Glass]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tyg6KxKwLWYC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=Roman+cameo+glass&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=riDU7l91we&amp;sig=o4JaZrguiH5NGKRFPYFA8Ss3rVg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fxOxSqWeMIeL4Abe7bzzBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#v=onepage&amp;q=Roman%20cameo%20glass&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; The technique was revived in the 18th and especially 19th centuries in England and elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;[http://forsyth.tamu.edu/cameobackground Texas A&amp;M University Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408023951/http://forsyth.tamu.edu/cameobackground |date=2009-04-08 }} Exhibition feature ''George Woodall and the Art of English Cameo Glass''&lt;/ref&gt; and was most effectively used in French [[Art Nouveau]] glass that made no attempt to follow classical styles.

The Middle Ages, which lived by [[charter]]s and other sealed documents, were at least as keen on using seals as the ancient world, now creating them for towns and church institutions, but they normally used metal matrices and [[signet ring]]s. However some objects, like a 13th-century Venetian ''[[Seven Sleepers of Ephesus]]'', mimicked the engraved gem.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Britishmuseumsevensleeperscameo.jpg|picture and link]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another offshoot of the mania for engraved gems is the fine-grained slightly translucent [[stoneware]] called [[jasperware]] that was developed by [[Josiah Wedgwood]] and perfected in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Reilly, ''Wedgwood Jasper'' London, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Though white-on-blue matte jasperware is the most familiar Wedgwood ceramic line, still in production today and widely imitated since the mid-19th century, white-on-black was also produced. Wedgwood made notable jasperware copies of the Portland Vase and the ''Marlborough gem'', a famous head of [[Antinous]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antinoos.info/antin9a.htm Antinoos.info] See "Gems" section for gem and casts etc&lt;/ref&gt; and interpreted in jasperware casts from antique gems by James Tassie. [[John Flaxman]]'s [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] designs for jasperware were carried out in the extremely low relief typical of cameo production. Some other [[porcelain]] imitated three-layer cameos purely by paint, even in implausible objects like a flat [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres|Sèvres]] tea-tray of 1840.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/special/royal_porcelain/view_1.asp?item=0 Sèvres tea-tray from the Metropolitan museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholars==
Gems were a favourite topic for [[antiquaries]] from the Renaissance onwards, culminating in the work of Philipp von Stosch, described above. Major progress in understanding Greek gems was made in the work of [[Adolf Furtwängler]] (1853–1907, father of [[Wilhelm Furtwängler|the conductor, Wilhelm]]). Among recent scholars [[John Boardman (art historian)|Sir John Boardman]] (b. 1927) has made a special contribution, again concentrating on Greek gems. [[Gertrud Seidmann]] (1919–2013) moved into the subject, having previously been a German teacher.

[[File:Erato monte calvo.jpg|upright|thumb|Roman statue of Erato (2nd century AD), playing the kithara or lyre]]

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Erato''' ({{IPAc-en|'|Er|@|t|oU}}; [[Ancient Greek]]: Ἐρατώ) is one of the Greek [[Muses]]. The name would mean "desired" or "lovely", if derived from the same root as [[Eros]], as [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] playfully suggested in the invocation to Erato that begins Book III of his ''[[Argonautica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Apollonius Rhodius, ''Argonautica'', III.1–5, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/830/830-h/830-h.htm#2H_4_0005 on-line text]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:erato.jpg|thumb|left|''Erato'' by [[Simon Vouet]]]]
Erato is the Muse of love poetry. In the [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic hymn]] to the Muses, it is Erato who charms the sight. Since the [[Renaissance]] she has mostly been shown with a wreath of [[Myrtus communis|myrtle]] and [[rose]]s, holding a [[lyre]], or a small [[kithara]], a musical instrument often associated with [[Apollo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cartwright|first1=Mark|title=Kithara|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Kithara/|accessdate=15 April 2016|date=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Simon Vouet]]'s representations, two turtle-doves are eating seeds at her feet. Other representations may show her holding a golden arrow, reminding one of the "eros", the feeling that she inspires in everybody, and at times she is accompanied by the god Eros, holding a torch.

== Development ==
Erato was named with the other muses in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]''. She was also invoked at the beginning of a lost poem, ''Rhadine'' ({{lang|grc|Ῥαδινή}}), that was referred to and briefly quoted by [[Strabo]].&lt;ref&gt;In ''Geography'' 8.3.20; Strabo's attribution of the poem to [[Stesichorus]] was refuted by H. J. Rose, "Stesichoros and the Rhadine-Fragment", ''The Classical Quarterly'' '''26'''.2 (April 1932), pp. 88–92.&lt;/ref&gt; The love story of [[Rhadine]] made her supposed tomb on the island of [[Samos]] a pilgrimage site for star-crossed lovers in the time of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]&lt;ref&gt;''Description of Greece'' 7.5.13.&lt;/ref&gt; and Erato was linked again with love in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'';&lt;ref&gt;''Phaedrus'', 259.&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless, even in the third century BC, when Apollonius wrote, the Muses were not yet as inextricably linked to specific types of poetry as they became.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hunter, editor. ''Jason and the Golden Fleece'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993), p. 66 note.&lt;/ref&gt;

Erato is also invoked at the start of book 7 of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', which marks the beginning of the second half or 'Iliadic' section of the poem: [[Calliope]] (epic), even [[Melpomene]] (tragedy) or [[Clio]] (history) might seem more appropriate. This choice may express Virgil's love for his native land, but in any case shows the need for a new creative force at this change in the direction of the poem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1643">The '''''Futurist Painting: Technical Manifesto''''' (1910) by [[Umberto Boccioni]] (1882-1916) was the first exposition of the theoretical underpinnings of [[Italian Futurists|Italian Futurist]] painting.&lt;ref&gt;Tisdall, Caroline, and Angelo Bozzolla. (1977) ''Futurism''. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], p. 32. {{ISBN|0500201595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
The manifesto was first published as a leaflet in ''[[Poesia (magazine)|Poesia]]'', in Milan, 11 April 1910.&lt;ref&gt;[[Umbro Apollonio|Apollonio, Umbro]], (Ed.) (1973) ''Futurist Manifestos''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, p. 27. {{ISBN|0500201323}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Boccioni, it was signed by [[Carlo Carrà]], [[Luigi Russolo]], [[Giacomo Balla]] and [[Gino Severini]], although they did not necessarily all contribute to the text. The translation most often used in English is from the ''[[Exhibition of Works by the Italian Futurist Painters]]'' at the [[Sackville Gallery]] in London, March 1912.

==Antecedents==
The manifesto built on the publication of the ''[[Manifesto of Futurism]]''  by [[Filippo Marinetti]] in ''[[Le Figaro]]'' in Paris in 1909 and Boccioni's ''[[Manifesto of the Futurist Painters]]'' published as a leaflet in ''Poesia'', 11 February 1910, neither of which had described in detail how Futurist ideas would be represented on the canvas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7071">The [[Equality Act 2006]] was complemented with specific duties later on. The general Equality Duty states that people should not be discriminated according to their age, [[race (classification of human beings)|race]], gender, [[religion]], [[disability]] and [[sexual orientation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equality Act 2006 (Section 10)|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/3/section/10|website=Legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and required public bodies to take seriously threats of harassment or discrimination on the grounds of [[gender reassignment]] (''[[i.e.]]'', anti-[[Transgender|trans]] prejudice).&lt;ref name=equalityhumanrights.com1&gt;{{cite web |title=Transgender: what the law says |url=http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/your-rights/equal-rights/transgender/transgender-what-the-law-says |website=equalityhumanrights.com |publisher=Equality and Human Rights Commission |accessdate=5 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318072658/http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/your-rights/equal-rights/transgender/transgender-what-the-law-says |archivedate=18 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the Gender Equality Duty was released demanding that [[Scottish public bodies|public bodies]] promote [[equality of opportunity]] with a special focus on [[gender equality]]. Following this Duty requires acting by the rules posed by the [[Scottish Government]]. It is each public body’s duty to publish a gender equality scheme which is to be revised every three years. There also has to be an annual report on what actions were taken to achieve objectives outlined in the equality scheme. Objectives might be about how the authorities plan to abolish discrimination and harassment as well as the pay gap between men and women. But also many other factors play into the Gender Equality Duty. According to [[Equal Opportunities Commission (United Kingdom)|Equal Opportunities Commission]] women and men should also use their right on equality in relation to parental leave after child birth or adoption. Another important factor is that the Gender Equality Duty does not just apply to bigger companies. It also applies to public bodies as schools and to education in general.

It was replaced by a general equality duty under the [[Equality Act 2010]].

== Sex discrimination==

According to Equality Commission there are four different kinds of sexual discrimination:

'''Direct discrimination:'''

When one is directly discriminated it means that it is obvious to everybody that one is treated less favourably because of one’s sex.

Example:

*Dismissing a woman because she is pregnant.
*Dismissing a man because he wants to take paternity leave.

'''Harassment:'''

Harassment is a form of direct discrimination which aims at violating one’s dignity by talking to people in an overly suggestive manner or by touching. This causes an intimidating, degrading, humiliating and even hostile environment at work.

Example:

*Unwelcome jokes, gestures or comments of a sexual nature
*Unwelcome displaying of sexually suggestive objects or pictures
*Unwelcome flirting
*Repeated and unwanted sexual advances
*Touching and other unwanted bodily contact, or impeding or blocking movements&lt;ref&gt;[http://jobsearchtech.about.com/cs/labor_laws/a/sexual_harass.htm Sexual Harassment in the Workplace&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indirect discrimination:'''

Indirect discrimination occurs when the employer applies the same rules or criteria to men and women, but at the same time one sex is put at disadvantage as they cannot fulfill the requirements.

Example:

*Setting length of service as a criterion for a post where this is not relevant (women on average have less service than men in [[Lothian]] and Borders Police).
*Setting an unnecessary height restriction, as on average women are shorter than the average male.

'''Victimisation:'''

Victimisation is defined as treating a person less favourably because they have filed or want to file a complaint about having been harassed or discriminated against.

=== Equal pay ===

The [[Equal Pay Act 1970]] demanded that men and women doing the same work get paid equally. With the Gender Equality Duty in 2007, it was stated that companies and public authorities have to publicly show ''how'' they want to improve the pay issue as a difference in payment shows gender discrimination. They are controlled regularly whether they achieved their objectives or not. Although the Equal Pay Act came into force almost several decades ago, there is still a pay gap of 15% between men and women doing the same work.&lt;ref&gt;Close the Gap http://www.closethegap.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Close the Gap Project]], there are several reasons for differences in pay; the first one being that jobs are segregated regarding to gender. So it is normal to press men and women into stereotypical male or female occupations. The majority of women (72%) are employed in public administration, education and health. Typical male jobs are handy work, mechanical work with the 89% of male employees working in the field of construction [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/Equality/18500/StatisticsWomenMenScot#a6]. It can also be seen that in high management position the percentage of men working there is higher than that of women working in similar positions. Another reason for the Pay Gap is the caring responsibility of women. As many workplaces lack flexible schedules women with caring responsibilities towards old or sick relatives, children or disabled people are more likely to look for part-time work which allows them to be more flexible. This can also be seen when having a closer look at the statistics. According to Esther Breitenbach and Fran Wasoff (A Gender Audit of Statistics: Comparing the Position of Women and Men in Scotland) about 55% of women work  part-time as it is one of the work arrangements with flexible working hours, compared to only 22% of men who do use this work arrangement.

In Scotland women earn 12 per cent less per hour than men when full-time salaries are compared. Women working part-time earn 32 per cent less per hour than men working full-time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.closethegap.org.uk/content/resources/FE-Guidance-FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Yazidis]] are [[monotheists]] who believe in [[Melek Taus|a benevolent peacock angel]] and practice an ancient [[gnostic]] faith. The self-proclaimed [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] and other followers of Islam in the region tend to view the peacock angel as the malevolent creature [[Lucifer]] or [[Shaitan]] and they consider the Yazidis '[[devil]] worshippers'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Does ISIS Consider the Yazidi 'Devil Worshippers'?|url=http://ultraculture.org/blog/2014/08/08/isis-consider-yazidi-devil-worshippers/|website=Ultra Culture|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Devil Worshipers of the Middle East: Their Beliefs &amp; Sacred Books'' Holmes Pub Group LLC (December 1993); {{ISBN|1-55818-231-4}}/{{ISBN|978-1-55818-231-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, more than 300 Yazidi families were threatened and forced to choose between conversion to [[Sunni Islam]] or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|url=https://news.yahoo.com/islamic-state-militants-tell-300-yazidi-families-convert-161322618--finance.html|title=Islamic State militants tell 300 Yazidi families: convert or die|publisher=News.yahoo.com|date=9 August 2014|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early October, Matthew Barber, a scholar of Yazidi history at the University of Chicago, estimated between 3,000–5,000 Yazidi men had been killed by ISIS.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hopkins|first1=Steve|title=Full horror of the Yazidis who didn't escape Mount Sinjar: UN confirms 5,000 men were executed and 7,000 women are now kept as sex slaves|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2792552/full-horror-yazidis-didn-t-escape-mount-sinjar-confirms-5-000-men-executed-7-000-women-kept-sex-slaves.html|publisher=''The [[Daily Mail]]''|date=14 October 2014|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sunni collaboration ===
In several villages, local Sunnis were reported to have sided with ISIL, betraying Yazidis for slaughter once ISIL arrived, and even possibly colluding in advance with ISIL to lie to Yazidis, to lure them into staying put until the terrorists invaded; although there was also one report of Sunnis helping Yazidis to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ahmed|first1=Azam|title=For Yazidis Betrayed by Arab Neighbors, 'It Will Never Be the Same'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/world/middleeast/iraq-isis-yazidis-kurds-sunni-arabs.html|date=27 August 2014|work=New York Times|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Abductions====
On 3 August, ISIL abducted women and children from the [[Qahtaniyah, Iraq|al-Qahtaniya]] area, and 450–500 abducted Yazidi women and girls were taken to [[Tal Afar]]; hundreds more to Si Basha Khidri and then  Ba'aj.&lt;ref name="OHCHR"/&gt; When ISIL fighters attacked Jabal Sinjar on 4 August, they abducted a number of women in the Yazidi village of Hardan, wives and daughters were abducted; other Yazidi women were abducted in other villages in the area.&lt;ref name="OHCHR"/&gt; On 6 August, ISIL kidnapped 400 Yazidi women in Sinjar to sell them as [[sex slaves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://almasalah.com/ar/News/35934/%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%B4-%D9%8A%D8%AE%D8%AA%D8%B7%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%83%D8%AB%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%86-400-%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A3%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%AF%D9%8A|title="داعش" يختطف اكثر من 400 امرأة ايزيدية في سنجار ويوزعهن على معسكرين لممارسة "جهاد النكاح"|publisher=Almasalah.com|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to reports from surviving Yazidi, between 3 and 6 August 500 Yazidi women and children were abducted from Ba'aj and more than 200 from Tal Banat.&lt;ref name="OHCHR"/&gt; According to a statement by the Iraqi government on 10 August 2014, hundreds of women were taken as slaves in northern Iraq.&lt;ref name=HPaug10/&gt;&lt;ref name=novinky/&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters10A/&gt;  On 15 August, in the Yazidi village of Kojo, south of Sinjar, over 100 women were abducted,&lt;ref name="edition.cnn.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Magazine"/&gt; though according to some reports from survivors, up to 1,000 women and children of the Yazidi village of Khocho were abducted.&lt;ref name="OHCHR"/&gt; According to an [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|OHRCR]]/[[United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq|UNAMI]] report on 26 September, by the end of August up to 2,500 Yazidis, mostly women and children, had been abducted.&lt;ref name="OHCHR"/&gt;
In early October, Matthew Barber, a scholar of Yazidi history at the University of Chicago, compiled a list of names of 4,800 Yazidi women and children who had been captured (estimating the total number of abducted people to be possibly up to 7,000).&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;

The abducted Yazidi women were sold into slave markets with ISIL "using [[Wartime sexual violence|rape as a weapon]] of war" according to CNN, with the group having [[gynaecologist]]s ready to examine the captives. Yazidi women were physically observed, including examinations to see if they were "[[virgin]]s" or if they were pregnant. Women who were found to be pregnant were taken by the ISIL gynaecologists and [[forced abortion]]s were performed on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shubert|first1=Atika|last2=Naik|first2=Bharati|title=ISIS 'forced pregnant Yazidi women to have abortions'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/06/middleeast/pregnant-yazidis-forced-abortions-isis/|accessdate=8 October 2015|agency=[[CNN]]|date=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treatment====
Haleh Esfandiari from the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] highlighted the abuse of local women by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] militants after they have captured an area. "They usually take the older women to a makeshift slave market and try to sell them. The younger girls ... are raped or married off to fighters", she said, adding, "It's based on temporary marriages, and once these fighters have had sex with these young girls, they just pass them on to other fighters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brekke|first1=Kira|title=ISIS Is Attacking Women, And Nobody Is Talking About It|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/08/isis-attacks-on-women_n_5775106.html?cps=gravity|accessdate=11 September 2014|work=The Huffington Post|date=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking of Yazidi women captured by ISIS, [[Nazand Begikhani]] said in October 2014, "These women have been treated like cattle...

A United Nations report issued on 2 October 2014, based on 500 interviews with witnesses, said that ISIL took 450–500 women and girls to Iraq's [[Nineveh Governorate|Nineveh]] region in August where "150 unmarried girls and women, predominantly from the Yazidi and Christian communities, were reportedly transported to Syria, either to be enslaved to ISIL fighters as a 'reward' or to be sold as sex slaves".&lt;ref name=Nebehay-10-2&gt;{{cite news|last=Nebehay|first=Stephanie|title=Islamic State committing 'staggering' crimes in Iraq: U.N. report|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/02/us-mideast-crisis-un-idUSKCN0HR0R120141002|date=2 October 2014|accessdate=2 October 2014|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 November 2014, Dr. [[Widad Akrawi]] of [[Defend International]] said that "the international community should define what's happening to the Yezidis as a crime against humanity, crime against cultural heritage of the region and ethnic cleansing," adding that Yazidi females are being "subjected to as systematic gender-based violence and the use of slavery and rape as a weapon of war."&lt;ref name="widad.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://widad.org/widadwp/rojnews-interview-2014|title=Dr Widad Akrawi Interviewed at RojNews: How should the international community classify the systematic massacre of the Yezidi civilians in Sinjar by IS jihadists that included taking Yezidi girls as sex slaves|date=|accessdate=30 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151028214040/http://widad.org/widadwp/rojnews-interview-2014|archivedate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, reports from Vian Dakhil of the Iraqi parliament told of a captured sex slave being fed her own one-year-old child.

Writing in mid 2016, Lori Hinnant, Maya Alleruzzo and Balint Szlanko of the [[Associated Press]] report that ISIL has tightened "its grip on the estimated 3,000 women and girls held as sex slaves" even while it loses territory to Iraqi forces.&lt;ref name="washpost-5-7-16"/&gt;  ISIL sells the women on encrypted smart phone apps, "primarily on [[Telegram (software)|Telegram]] and on [[Facebook]]" and to a lesser degree on [[WhatsApp]]. In advertisements for the girls obtained by AP

&lt;blockquote&gt;many of the women and girls are dressed in finery, some in heavy makeup. All look directly at the camera, standing in front of overstuffed chairs or brocade curtains in what resembles a shabby hotel ballroom. Some are barely out of elementary school. Not one looks older than 30.&lt;ref name="washpost-5-7-16"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Western-backed forces closed in on Raqqa in July 2017, reports from the wives of ISIL members shared on an Arabic program were released. One wife stated that on encrypted apps, "They were sharing photos of the sex slaves with the best make-up and clothes, and asking $2,000 for this one, $3,000 for that one. A virgin cost $10,000". They contested statements by former Yazidi captives, saying that "the sex slaves were lavished with gifts including expensive lipstick and clothes". Many wives were jealous of the Yazidi sex slaves, leaving their husbands and when they were provided aid by refugee services in the area, "the wives of the jihadis showed little emotion over the atrocities committed in Syria".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Brien|first1=Zoie|title=Horror of ISIS sex slave app: Virgins put on sale by twisted jihadis|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/824163/ISIS-sex-slave-app-Virgins-sale-twisted-jihadis-Raqqa-Syria-latest-Yazidi-women-ISIS-wives|accessdate=3 July 2017|work=[[Daily Express]]|date=3 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Escape===
In November 2014 ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported on the accounts given by five who escaped ISIL of their captivity and abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Semple, [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/15/world/middleeast/yazidi-girls-seized-by-isis-speak-out-after-escape.html "Yazidi Girls Seized by ISIS Speak Out After Escape,"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', 14 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mirza Dinnayi, founder of the German-Iraqi aid organization [[Luftbrücke Irak]], ISIL registers "every slave, every person under their owner, and therefore if she escapes, every Daesh [ISIL] control or checkpoint, or security force - they know that this girl ... has escaped from this owner".&lt;ref name="washpost-5-7-16"/&gt;
For over a year after the girls were first enslaved,  "Arab and Kurdish smugglers managed to free an average of 134" slaves a month. But by May 2016, an ISIL "crackdown reduced those numbers to just 39 in the last six weeks, according to figures provided by the Kurdistan regional government". ISIL  fighters have been targeting and "assassinating smugglers who rescue the captives".

=== Flight into Sinjar Mountains and PKK's support ===
{{see also|Sinjar massacre#Refugee crisis in the Sinjar Mountains}}
The ISIL offensive in the Sinjar area of northern Iraq, 3–4 August, caused 30,000–50,000 Yazidis to flee into the [[Sinjar Mountains]] (Jabal Sinjar) fearing they would be killed by ISIL. They had been  threatened with death if they refused conversion to Islam. A UN representative said that "a humanitarian tragedy is unfolding in Sinjar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Salih|first1=Mohammed|last2=van Wilgenburg|first2=Wladimir|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/08/iraqi-yazidis-if-move-they-will-kill-us-20148513656188206.html|title=Iraqi Yazidis: 'If we move they will kill us'|date=5 August 2014|publisher=Aljazeera|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 and 4 August 14 or more Yazidi children and some elderly or people with disabilities died of hunger, dehydratation, and heat on [[Sinjar Mountains]].&lt;ref name="OHCHR"&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/IQ/UNAMI_OHCHR_POC_Report_FINAL_6July_10September2014.pdf Report on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict in Iraq: 6 July – 10 September 2014].

By 20 October, 2,000 Yazidis, mainly volunteer fighters, who had remained behind to protect the villages, but also civilians (700 families who had not yet escaped), were reported as still in the Sinjar area, and were forced by ISIL to abandon the last villages in their control, Dhoula and Bork, and retreat to the Sinjar Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/islamic-state-seizes-two-yazidi-villages-as-it-advances-on-mount-sinjar/2014/10/20/63cd2a22-9292-4c42-9ff5-41d430ec2819_story.html|title=Islamic State seizes two Yazidi villages as it advances on Mount Sinjar|work=Washington Post|date=20 October 2014|accessdate=15 March 2015|first=Loveday|last=Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return of Yazidi population===
[[File:Yazidi Town Gripped With Challenges Long After IS Removal.webm|thumb|The Yazidi residents of Snune in northern Iraq who returned home faced many challenges]]
Following ISIL's retreat from Iraqi and Kurdish forces in the region during late-2017 campaigns, both governments laid claim to the area. The Yazidi population, with only about 15% returning to Sinjar during the period, was caught in the political crossfire. Yazidi's returned to an abandoned town of crumbling buildings, leftover IEDs and the remains of those killed during the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jalabi|first1=Raya|title=Yazidis caught in 'political football' between Baghdad, Iraqi Kurds|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-yazidis/yazidis-caught-in-political-football-between-baghdad-iraqi-kurds-idUSKBN1E40FZ|accessdate=22 December 2017|work=[[Reuters]]|date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, a mass grave of about 70 people was uncovered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yazidi mass grave found in Iraq's Sinjar|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-5107265/Yazidi-mass-grave-Iraqs-Sinjar.html|accessdate=22 December 2017|work=Mail Online|date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a month later in December, another mass grave was discovered holding about 90 victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two Yazidi Mass Graves Reportedly Uncovered in Iraq|url=https://www.albawaba.com/news/two-yazidi-mass-graves-reportedly-uncovered-iraq-1061884|accessdate=22 December 2017|work=[[Al Bawaba]]|date=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification as genocide==
The persecution of the Yazidi people has been viewed as qualifying as [[genocide]] by groups such as the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] in a March 2015 report. The organization cited the numerous atrocities such as [[forced religious conversion]] and [[sexual slavery]] as being parts of an overall malicious campaign.&lt;ref name=BBCRussian/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/19/isis-genocide-yazidis_n_6900224.html | work=Huffington Post | title=UN: ISIS May Have Committed Genocide Against Yazidis | date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 March 2016, the [[United States House of Representatives]] voted unanimously 393-0 that violent actions performed against Yazidis, Christians, [[Shia]] and other groups by ISIL were acts of genocide. Days later on 17 March 2016, [[United States Secretary of State]] [[John Kerry]] declared that the violence initiated by ISIL against the Yazidis and others amounted to genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Labott|first1=Elise|title=U.S. to declare genocide in Iraq and Syria|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/17/politics/us-iraq-syria-genocide/index.html|accessdate=17 March 2016|agency=[[CNN]]|date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple individual human rights activists such as [[Nazand Begikhani]] and Dr. [[Widad Akrawi]] have also advocated for this view.&lt;ref name="widad.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/30/opinion/isis-yazidi-women-genocide/ | work=CNN | title=Quick Links}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term itself first arose in 1944 as the creation of a [[Polish-Jewish]] lawyer named [[Raphael Lemkin]], who himself defined the term as reflecting "a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/confront-genocide/defining-genocide|accessdate=11 August 2015|title=What Is Genocide?|publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Releases of Yazidi captives==
In January 2015, about 200 Yazidis were released by ISIL. Kurdish military officials believed they were released because they were a burden. On 8 April 2015, 216 Yazidis, with the majority being children and elderly, were released by ISIL after being held captive for about 8 months. Their release occurred following an offensive by U.S.-led air assaults and pressure from Iraqi ground forces who were [[Second Battle of Tikrit (March–April 2015)|pushing northward and in the process of retaking Tikrit]]. According to General Hiwa Abdullah, a peshmerga commander in Kirkuk, those released were in poor health with signs of abuse and neglect visible.&lt;ref name=GMrelease&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yacoub|first1=Sameer N.|title=Islamic State releases over 200 Iraqi Yazidis after 8 months as captives|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/islamic-state-releases-over-200-iraqi-yazidis-after-8-months-as-captives/article23844498/|accessdate=9 April 2015|agency=''[[The Globe and Mail]]''|date=8 April 2015|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Western military intervention===
{{see also|American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)}}
On 7 August 2014, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] ordered targeted airstrikes on IS militants and emergency air relief for the Yazidis. Airstrikes began on 8 August. (See [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)#Obama authorizes airstrikes]].)

On 8 August 2014, the US asserted that the systematic destruction of the Yazidi people by the Islamic State was genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Noack|first=Rick|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/08/08/when-obama-talks-about-iraq-his-use-of-the-word-genocide-is-vital|title=When Obama talks about Iraq, his use of the word 'genocide' is vital|work=The Washington Post|date=8 August 2014|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Barack Obama had authorized the attacks to protect Yazidis but also Americans and Iraqi minorities. President Obama gave an assurance that no troops would be deployed for combat. Along with the airstrikes of 9 August, the US [[airdrop]]ped 3,800 gallons of water and 16,128 [[MRE]]s. Following these actions, the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] stated that they also would begin airdrops.&lt;ref name=CNNaug9&gt;{{cite news|last1=J.

On 10 August 2014, at approximately 2:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. ET, the US carried out five additional airstrikes on armed vehicles and a mortar position, enabling 20,000–30,000 Yazidi Iraqis to flee into Syria and later be rescued by Kurdish forces. The Kurdish forces then provided shelter for the Yazidis in [[Dohuk]].&lt;ref name=CNNaug10&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands of Yazidis rescued, Iraqi official says|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/10/world/meast/iraq-crisis/|accessdate=6 June 2015|agency=CNN|date=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GUARDIANaug10&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siddique|first1=Haroon|title=20,000 Iraqis besieged by Isis escape from mountain after US air strikes|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/10/iraq-yazidi-isis-jihadists-islamic-state-kurds|accessdate=6 June 2015|work=The Guardian|date=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 August 2014, fewer than 20 [[United States Special Forces]] troops stationed in Irbil along with British [[Special Air Service]] troops visited the area near Mount Sinjar to gather intelligence and plan the evacuation of approximately 30,000 Yazidis still trapped on Mount Sinjar. One hundred and twenty-nine additional US military personnel were deployed to Irbil to assess and provide a report to President Obama.&lt;ref name=GUARDaug13&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chulov|first1=Martin|last2=Borger|first2=Julian|last3=Norton-Taylor|first3=Richard|last4=Roberts|first4=Dan|title=US troops land on Iraq's Mt Sinjar to plan for Yazidi evacuation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/13/us-ground-troops-direct-role-evacuate-yazidis-iraq|accessdate=6 June 2015|agency=The Guardian|date=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Central Command also reported that a seventh airdrop was conducted and that to date, 114,000 meals and more than 35,000 gallons of water had been airdropped to the displaced Yazidis in the area.&lt;ref name=CENTCOMaug13&gt;{{cite web|title=Aug. 13: Update on Humanitarian Assistance Operations Near Sinjar, Iraq|url=http://www.centcom.mil/news/articles/aug-13-update-on-humanitarian-assistance-operations-near-sinjar|website=United States Central Command|publisher=United States Central Command|accessdate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement on 14 August 2014, [[The Pentagon]] said that the 20 US personnel who had visited the previous day had concluded that a rescue operation was probably unnecessary since there was less danger from exposure or dehydration and the Yazidis were no longer believed to be at risk of attack from ISIL.

Kurdish officials and Yazidi refugees stated that thousands of young, elderly, and disabled individuals on the mountain were still vulnerable, with the governor of Kurdistan's [[Dahuk|Dahuk province]], [[Farhad Atruchi]], saying that the assessment was "not correct" and that although people were suffering, "the international community is not moving".&lt;ref name=WP14aug2/&gt;

P.8.&lt;/ref&gt;. However, Turkish forces have been backing the Jihadist of ISIL and displacing the Yazidi from their original villages to the city of Afrin. Furthermore, the controversy lingers after the 2014 attack on Mount Sinjar, the Turkish forces attacked the Yazidi tribe from above. Additionally, their aid was only given after many nations called out their actions that their slow movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Yazidis-who-once-fled-ISIS-now-flee-Turkish-offensive-545262|title=YAZIDIS WHO ONCE FLED ISIS NOW FLEE TURKISH OFFENSIVE|last=FRANTZMAN|first=SETH|date=16 March 2018|website=Jerusalem Post|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkish newspaper ''[[Today's Zaman]]'' claimed Turkey has also airdropped humanitarian aid to Yazidi refugees within Iraq, but Kurdish authorities didn't confirm humanitarian aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/diplomacy_davutoglu-turkish-aid-air-dropped-to-yazidis-in-sinjar-mountains_354865.html |title=Davutoğlu: Turkish aid air-dropped to Yazidis in Sinjar mountains |work=Today's Zaman |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=18 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816223430/http://www.todayszaman.com/diplomacy_davutoglu-turkish-aid-air-dropped-to-yazidis-in-sinjar-mountains_354865.html |archivedate=16 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization, also known as the P.K.K., established a security corridor that allowed civilians to flee the area of the massacre.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  However, the presence of the P.K.K has created a complicated dynamic, because they have continued to carry out airstrikes and take refugee in that area. Therefore, the Turkish aid is a complicated and is not always perceived as aid to the Yazidi people. 

===International recognition===

In [[archaeology]], '''ground stone''' is a category of [[stone tool]] formed by the grinding of a coarse-grained [[tool stone]], either purposely or incidentally.  Ground stone tools are usually made of [[basalt]], [[rhyolite]], [[granite]], or other [[cryptocrystalline]] and [[igneous]] stones whose coarse structure makes them ideal for grinding other materials, including plants and other stones.

== Origin ==
The adoption of ground [[stone technology]] is associated closely with the [[Neolithic]], also called the [[New Stone Age]]. The [[Stone Age]] comes from the three-age system developed by [[Christian Jürgensen Thomsen]]. In the Levant ground stones appear in [[Mesolithic]] 2 ([[Natufian]]).  In prehistoric [[Japan]], ground stone tools appear during the [[Japanese Paleolithic]], possibly predating adoption elsewhere in the Neolithic by 25,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;"Prehistoric Japan, New perspectives on insular East Asia", Keiji Imamura, University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu, {{ISBN|0-8248-1853-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
Ground stones were created and used for a wide variety of reasons. Each use resulted in a different development and process by which a person created their ground stone. For example, the process for creating the head of a hammer is different from the process used to create a detailed decoration piece for one’s home. That being said, there are some processes that are basic to most ground stone making.
	
When choosing what type of stone to use for a ground stone tool, toughness is the most important factor. If the stone is not tough enough to withstand hard hits and instead just flakes and cracks easily, the work done to create the tool has gone to waste. A stone that will not shear, flake, or crack when tested against large impacts is the most important aspect when choosing what kind of stone to use. Examples of this kind of stone include [[limestone]], [[sandstone]], [[granite]], [[basalt]], [[rhyolite]] and other [[igneous]] and [[cryptocrystalline]] rocks.

[[Cryptocrystalline]] rocks are good to use for ground stones because they have a very fine grain structure. This is helpful because the smaller the grains are in a rock, the harder the rock is.

Holes could be ground out of stones with the use of sharp pointed stones or hardened sticks. By spinning the ground stone with one's hands and applying substantial pressure to the sharp point into the ground stone, a hole could be drilled into the stone with a large amount of time and effort. Sand would be used to help quicken the process by putting it in the partially formed hole as the sharp point was being pressed. The sand would help grind more of the stone away. To put a hole all the way through a piece of stone, it would be first drilled half way in one direction and be finished on the opposite side.

Some ground stone tools are incidental, caused by use with other tools: [[Mano (stone)|manos]], for example, are hand stones used in conjunction with [[metate]]s and other [[grinding slab]]s (querns), and develop their ground surfaces through wear. Other ground stone tools include [[adze]]s, [[celt (tool)|celts]], and [[axe]]s, which are manufactured using a labor-intensive, time-consuming method of repeated grinding against a harder stone or with sand, often using water as a [[lubricant]].  These tools are often made using durable finer-grained materials rather than coarse materials.  In the North American arctic, tools made of ground slate were used by the [[Norton tradition|Norton]], [[Dorset culture|Dorset]], and [[Thule people|Thule]] tool cultures, among others.  Common forms of these tools were projectile points and [[ulu]]s. These tools were often purpose-made by creating a blank, either by chipping or using a technique where the slate was sawed partway through on one or both sides and then snapped into a blank, then finished by grinding with abraders or whetstones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=Donald W.|title=An Example of Technological Change in Prehistory: The Origin of a Regional Ground Slate Industry in South-Central Coastal Alaska|journal=Arctic Anthropology|date=1982|volume=19|issue=1|pages=103–125|jstor=40316018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MortarandPestle.jpg|thumb|right|An ancient Mexican mortar and pestle ground stone set.]] --&gt;

When making the head of an axe out of stone, the piece would be made so it could be hafted. In order to have the stone hafted onto a larger piece, like wood or bone, the ground stone may have at least two notches ground out of one side of the stone, making grooves for the hafting material to lie inside. These grooves would ensure that the stone would not move when struck with a large force. Tough hide would then be wound around the handle and inside the grooves, binding the ground stone and the handle together.

Ground stones were often used as dinner-ware. Using large stones, [[lithic reduction]] would be done for long periods of time to create bowls and pots for food. Jewelry, beads, ear spools and other decorative ground stones were a sign of high status due to the time and effort needed to make pieces of such small size and detail.

When mashing up seeds and leaves into powders, rounded and smooth ground stones would be used inside a stone bowl. This pair of tools is called a [[mortar and pestle]]. The material would be placed into the mortar and the pestle would be moved and pressed into the mortar to grind the material into a fine powder. This process could be used for medicine and cooking. Mortar and pestle is still used today for many cooking recipes.

'''Hanna Holborn Gray''' (born October 25, 1930) is an American historian of [[Renaissance]] and [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] political thought and Professor of History ''Emerita'' at the [[University of Chicago]]. She served as [[List of Presidents of the University of Chicago|president]] of the University of Chicago, from 1978 to 1993, having earlier served as [[List of Presidents of Yale University|acting president]] of [[Yale University]] in 1977-78.  At both schools, she was the first woman to hold their highest executive office.  When named to the post in Chicago, she became the first woman in the United States to hold the full presidency of a major university.

==Biography==
Hanna Holborn was born in [[Heidelberg, Germany]], the daughter of [[Hajo Holborn]], a professor of European history at Yale who fled to America from [[Nazi Germany]], and Annemarie Bettmann, a philologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Second Generation.

Holborn traveled to [[Oxford University|Oxford]] as a [[Fulbright Scholar]]. She met and married Charles Montgomery Gray in 1954 while both were graduate students at [[Harvard University]], earned a [[Ph.D.]] from Harvard in 1957, and taught there, becoming an assistant professor in 1959.

She moved to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] when her husband was appointed to a position at the University of Chicago. She began teaching history there and earned [[tenure]] in 1964. From 1966 to 1970, she was co-editor of the ''[[Journal of Modern History]]'' with her husband.&lt;ref&gt;[http://president.uchicago.edu/directory/hanna-holborn-gray "Hanna Holborn Gray", Office of the President, University of Chicago]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gray rose to prominence as an administrator after she was appointed to a committee to investigate whether a sociology professor had been denied tenure because of her gender and political sympathies.

Gray was named dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at [[Northwestern University]] in 1972 and became professor of history and provost at [[Yale University]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, Brooks Mather. (1999).

(1985). ''American women managers and administrators,'' pp. 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gray then returned to the University of Chicago, serving as president from 1978 to 1993, the first female (full) president of a major university in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of Dr. Gray's presidency see "Hanna Holborn Gray, 1978-93," ''News from the Department of History'', University of Chicago [http://www-news.uchicago.edu/president/history/gray.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;

She retired in June 1993 but remains [[Harry Pratt Judson]] Distinguished Service Professor ''Emerita'', continuing to offer advanced undergraduate and graduate courses in history. Her husband died in April 2011.

Gray has also served as a director, board member or trustee of many institutions, including the [[Harvard Corporation]], the [[Yale Corporation]], the [[Smithsonian Institution]], [[JP Morgan Chase]], the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], the Marlboro School of Music, the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], the [[Concord Coalition]], the [[Mayo Clinic]], the [[Brookings Institution]], and [[Bryn Mawr College]].

== Discovery ==
HSL was recognized by linguists on March 1, 2013 by a research group from the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa|University of Hawai'i at Manoa]].  The research team found a letter from [[Hiram Bingham I|Reverend Hiram Bingham]] to [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet|Reverend Thomas H. Gallaudet]] from Feb. 23, 1821. The letter described several instances of Deaf natives communicating to Bingham in their own sign language.&lt;ref name="LambrechtEarthWoodward" /&gt; At the time of discovery, the language was used by around 40 people, mostly over 80-years-old.&lt;ref&gt;Mcavoy, A. (2013, March 01). [http://www.staradvertiser.com/2013/03/01/breaking-news/hawaii-sign-language-found-to-be-distinct-language/ Hawaii Sign Language found to be distinct language]. ''Associated Press''. Retrieved April 30, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:DiscoveryHSL.jpg|none|thumb|Bingham letter]]

== History ==
HSL is not itself a [[pidgin]],&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;{{citation|title=Ethnologue|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/hps}}
&lt;/ref&gt; but alternate names for the language are documented as Hawai'i Pidgin Sign Language or Pidgin Sign Language.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is due to to an inaccurate historical association with the spoken language [[Hawaii Pidgin|Hawaiʻi Pidgin]]. Linguists who have begun to document the language and community members prefer the name ''Hawaiʻi Sign Language'',&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LambrechtEarthWoodward" /&gt; and that is the name used for it in [[ISO 639-3]] as of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=hps|title=Documentation for ISO 639 identifier: hps|accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Village sign use, by both d/Deaf and hearing, is attested from 1820.  There's the possibility of influence from immigrant sign later that century, though HSL has little in common today with ASL or other signed and spoken languages it has come in contact with.  The establishment of a school for the deaf in 1914 strengthened the use of sign, primarily HSL, among the students. A Deaf community hero, a Chinese-Hawai'ian Deaf man named Edwin Inn, taught HSL to other d/Deaf adults and also stood as president of a Deaf club.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the introduction of ASL in 1941 in place of purely oral instruction resulted in a shift from HSL.

== HSL and ASL Comparisons ==
HSL shares few lexical and grammatical components with ASL.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LambrechtEarthWoodward" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hsl" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Tanigawa, N. (2016, NOV 22). [http://hawaiipublicradio.org/post/hawai-i-sign-language-still-whispers Hawai'i Sign Language Still Whispers]. Retrieved May 1, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; While HSL follows subject, object, verb (SOV) typology, ASL follows subject, verb, object (SVO) typology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/hps|title=Hawaii Sign Language|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-02-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ase|title=American Sign Language|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-02-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; HSL does not have verbal classifiers- these were previously thought to be universal in sign languages, and ASL makes extensive use of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rarrick|first=Samantha|date=2015|title=A Sketch of Handshape Morphology in Hawai'i Sign Language|url=http://ling.hawaii.edu/wp-content/uploads/wp-rarrick.pdf|journal=University of Hawai'i at Manoa Working Papers in Linguistics|volume=46 |issue=6|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; HSL also has several entirely non-manual lexical items, including verbs and nouns, which are not typical in ASL.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Ongoing investigation of these languages suggest that they are not related.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== HSL Today ==
An estimated 15,857 of the total 833,610 residents of Hawai'i (about 1.9%) are audiologically [[deaf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libguides.gallaudet.edu/content.php?pid=119476&amp;sid=1029190|title=LibGuides.

Deaf population of the U.S..|last=Smith|first=Sarah Hamrick, Laura Jacobi, Patrick Oberholtzer, Elizabeth Henry, Jamie|website=libguides.gallaudet.edu|language=en|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among this population, ASL is now significantly more common than HSL.  There are a handful of services available to help d/Deaf Hawai'ian residents learn ASL and also for those who wish to learn ASL to become interpreters, such as the Aloha State Association of the Deaf and the American Sign Language Interpreter Education Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.signsofself.org/html/hawaii_links.html|title=Signs of Self|website=www.signsofself.org|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equivalent services for HSL are nearly non-existent, partially because some members of the Deaf community in Hawai'i have felt that it is not worth preservation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Linda Lambrecht, Dr. James Woodward and Barbara Clark are continually working with a team to document and preserve the language.&lt;ref name="race" /&gt; Another research member, Dr. Samantha Rarrick, is part of the Sign Language Documentation Training Center at the University of Hawai'i. This group has two goals. Their first goal to teach graduate students and other linguists how to document HSL and other small sign languages used in Hawai'i.&lt;ref&gt;Rarrick, S., &amp; Wilson, B.

Sid, a talkative sloth, is left behind by his family and the herds of mammals journeying to the south. He meets Manny, a mammoth who travels to the north, and decides to follow him. When a humans' camp is attacked by tigers, a woman takes her baby and jumps into a river and falls over a waterfall. Before she disappears, the baby is rescued by Manny and Sid. The two animals decide to search for the father and return the baby to him. Diego, one of the tigers that attacked the humans, comes also claiming the baby, and the trio form an uneasy alliance during their journey to the humans.

===''Ice Age: The Meltdown'' (2006)===
{{Main|Ice Age: The Meltdown}}
Manny, Sid, and Diego are currently living in a large valley surrounded by an enormously high ice wall on all sides. However, the trio discovers that the ice wall is actually a wall that is barely holding a massive body of water that could flood the valley to nearly a mile underwater. A vulture tells them that there is a boat at the other end of the valley that may save them all, but they only have three days to reach it or die. Manny is also having trouble fearing the fact that he may be the last mammoth left. Along the way, they meet Ellie, a mammoth who thinks she is a possum, and her possum brothers Crash and Eddie. As they begin to travel together, Manny learns, with help from Diego and Sid, that he must move on from his past. During their journey, [[Scrat]] the sabre-toothed squirrel has his own adventure.

===''Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs'' (2009)===

Manny and Ellie are expecting their first child, meanwhile Scrat falls in love with fellow squirrel Scratte. Meanwhile, Diego is anxious about settling down for a domestic life with Manny's new family. Sid begins to wish for a family of his own, and steals some dinosaur eggs which leads to Sid ending up in a strange underground world where his herd must rescue him. The herd also meets an insane one-eyed weasel known as Buck who aids them on their quest.

===''Ice Age: Continental Drift'' (2012)===
{{Main|Ice Age: Continental Drift}}

As they try to return home, they come into conflict with a pirate gang led by Captain Gutt.

=== {{anchor|Ice_Age_5_.282016.29}}''Ice Age: Collision Course'' (2016) ===
{{Main|Ice Age: Collision Course}}
Set after the events of ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift|Continental Drift]]'', Scrat's pursuit of his elusive acorn catapults him outside of Earth aboard a UFO, where he accidentally sets off a series of cosmic events that transform and threaten the planet. To save themselves from peril, Manny, Sid, Diego, and the rest of the herd leave their home and reunite with Buck, who leads them on a journey to find a way to save the planet.

===Future===
On the possibility of a potential sequel to ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]'', in June 2016, Galen T. Chu, co-director of the film, stated that there were some ideas for the next installment.&lt;ref name="FR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickreel.com/ice-age-collision-course-interview-with-co-director-galen-t-chu/|title=ICE AGE: COLLISION COURSE INTERVIEW WITH CO-DIRECTOR GALEN T. CHU|author=Cassam Looch|work=Flickreel|date=June 27, 2016|accessdate=July 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, Bustle noted that the potential of ''Ice Age 6'' actually being produced was relatively high even though it could largely depend on the box office performance of the fifth film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/172484-will-there-be-another-ice-age-movie-this-franchise-is-staying-strong|title=Will There Be Another Ice Age Movie?

The '''Indian Institute''' in central [[Oxford]], [[England]], is at the north end of [[Catte Street]] on the corner with [[Holywell Street]] and facing down [[Broad Street, Oxford|Broad Street]] from the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Oxford,_England|title=1911 Encyclopedia reference on Indian Institute|accessdate=2007-03-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207062738/http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Oxford%2C_England|archivedate=2007-02-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Monier Monier-Williams]] started the Institute in the [[University of Oxford]] in 1883 to provide training for the [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|Indian Civil Service]] of the [[British Raj]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordhistory.org.uk/broad/buildings/east/history_faculty/index.html |title=From the extract of ''Kelly's directory'' for 1900. |accessdate=2012-08-03 |df= }}{{dead link|date=May 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/makingbritain/content/indian-institute&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and building==
[[Image:Indian Institute cupola.jpg|thumb|right|Corner cupola with elephant weathervane]]
In June 1881, plans were submitted to the University of Oxford's [[Hebdomadal Council]] to build an Indian Institute. The original site was occupied by four old buildings. The building was designed by [[Basil Champneys]] and the first section opened in 1884. Originally there was a low shop to the south, but neighbouring [[Hertford College]] has now encroached on the Institute with a much taller building. The Institute was built of [[Taynton, Oxfordshire#Taynton stone|Taynton stone]] in the style of the [[English Renaissance]], with different oriental details to the designs of Champneys. In 1974 [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] observed that the rounded corner cupola made an excellent ''point de vue'' at the east end of Broad Street.

Along with the [[library]] ''(see below)'', the institute contained [[Classroom|lecture room]]s and a [[museum]]. Some contents of the museum are now present in the [[Ashmolean Museum|Ashmolean]] and [[Pitt Rivers Museum]]s. The original Indian Institute building is now the [[Oxford Martin School]] of the University of Oxford, the History Faculty having moved to the old [[City of Oxford High School for Boys|City of Oxford School]] building on [[George Street, Oxford|George Street]] and its library to the Bodleian site.

==Indian Institute Library==
{{main|Indian Institute Library}}
The [[Indian Institute Library]] opened in 1886. It became a dependent library of the [[Bodleian Library]], the main library of the University, in 1927. It specialises in the history and culture of [[South Asia]], especially the [[Himalayas]] and [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;Bodleian Library: Department of Oriental Collections: 'Indian Institute Library', http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/oriental/iil.htm, accessed 2007-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The library was formerly located in the Indian Institute building, but was moved to the top floor of the New Bodleian Library.

==Indian Institute Museum==
The Museum was an integral part of Monier-Williams’ design, modelled to some extent on the India Museum in South Kensington.  Monier-Williams acquired some pieces during his fund-raising and collecting tour of India in 1883-1884, including from the International Exhibition, at Calcutta, and arranged for regional representatives to send objects to Oxford. Babu T.N. Mukharji was commissioned to catalogue the collections in 1886 (never finished). The installation of the museum was done by Dr [[Heinrich Lüders]], assisted by Mr. Long of the Pitt Rivers Museum, and completed in 1898. When Monier-Williams died in 1899, no financial provision had been made for running the museum. Gradually, the collections were dispersed: entomological and zoological collections to the University Museum; and many pieces to the Pitt Rivers Museum and the Ashmolean Museum. A summary catalogue of the museum was prepared by Mr A. Rost (for a short handbook to the Institute, by Prof [[Arthur Anthony Macdonell|Arthur Macdonell]], 1922, but never published).&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Topsfield, History of the Indian Collections, in Indian Art in the Ashmolean Museum, A catalogue of the Ashmolean’s collection of Indian art by J. C. Harle and Andrew Topsfield (published Oxford, 1987).http://jameelcentre.ashmolean.org/collection/7/10230/10260&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations of racism==
The building was financed entirely by private donors in India and Britain, for the sole purpose of constructing an edifice to house study for and on the Indian sub-continent. There was consequently great controversy in 1968, when the University's governing council evicted the Indian Institute from the premises without compensation, and then made a gift of the premises to the History Faculty, which specialises in European history to the exclusion of Indian history. The government of India filed a formal protest on behalf of the families of the original donors, who felt defrauded by the University's actions. The [[Oxford University Student Union]] went further still, accusing the University administration of racism in the decision.

==The Institute's aim==
The aim of the Indian Institute was:
:''The work of fostering and facilitating Indian studies in the University; the work of making Englishmen, and even Indians themselves, appreciate better than they have done before the languages, literature and industries of India.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordhistory.org.uk/broad/buildings/east/history_faculty/ |title=Aim of the Indian Institute |accessdate=2007-03-02 |df= }}{{dead link|date=May 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ivory Pomegranate''' is a thumb-sized [[Semitic people|semitic]] ornamental artifact acquired by the [[Israel Museum]]. It is not actually made of ivory, but of [[hippopotamus]] bone and bears an inscription; ''Holy (Sacred) to the Priest of the House of God (YHWH)''.

At the time of its discovery, it was thought to have adorned the [[High Priest]]'s sceptre within the [[Holy of Holies]], thus potentially proving the existence of [[Solomon's Temple]].

==Description==
The [[Ivory]] [[Pomegranate]] is a small ornamental bone object engraved with a short inscription in paleo-Hebrew. The inscription is inscribed in circular fashion along the shoulders of the pomegranate which is the shape of the fruit in blossom stage. A significant part of the body of the pomegranate is broken including two breaks to the long petals of the fruit.

There is a vertical break on the body that cuts through the inscription, so that three letters are fragmentary and nine complete. Two areas of this fracture are lighter shades and considered to be new breaks on top of the ancient break. While it is still priceless as a [[Semitic people|Semitic]] artifact from 13th Century BCE, its connection to the [[Holy of Holies]] has been greatly disputed by [[Israel]]i and [[Italian people|Italian]] archeologists specializing in Roman and Semitic artifacts as forgery. {{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The pomegranate was popular as a cultic object and was not unique to the worship of Yahweh. Archaeologist Aharon Kempinski has argued that, even if the inscription is authentic, the chance of it belonging to Solomon's Temple is extremely small as its origin is unknown and there were many "houses of Yahweh" outside Jerusalem, many of which "have not yet been excavated but are constantly ransacked by [illegal] treasure seekers". [[Baruch Halpern]] has suggested another interpretation of the inscription.

The word "''house''" can also mean, literally, a house where a family lived. The missing letters could read ''(Ahijah)'' "[hyja]H". At least three of the Biblical ''Ahijahs'' were priests and the inscription may be a reference to a priestly family rather than a deity. Halpern also notes that the unusual syntax of the inscription makes this interpretation [[Philology|philologically]] possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cojs.org/cojswiki/The_Pomegranate_Scepter_Head%E2%80%94From_the_Temple_of_the_Lord_or_from_a_Temple_of_Asherah%3F_BAR_18:03,_May/Jun_1992. The Pomegranate Scepter Head—From the Temple of the Lord or from a Temple of Asherah?] Center for online judaic studies, May and June 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authenticity==
The thumb-sized ivory pomegranate measuring {{convert|44|mm|in}} in height, bears an ancient Hebrew inscription that reads, depending on the point chosen as the beginning in the circular inscription, "Belonging to the Temple [literally 'house'] of ---h, holy to the priests" or "Sacred donation for the priests of [or 'in'] the Temple [literally 'house'] of ---h". It was once believed by some scholars to have adorned a sceptre used by the [[Kohen Gadol|high priest]] in Solomon's Temple. Its origin is unknown as it appeared on the antiquities market anonymously in 1979 and was smuggled out of Israel and sold to an anonymous collector in France. Based on authentication by Israel’s then leading [[Epigraphy|epigrapher]], Professor [[Nahman Avigad]]  of [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|Hebrew University]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080928121526/http://www.bib-arch.org/online-exclusives/ivory-pomegranate-03.asp ]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem purchased it from the collector for the sum of $550,000 in 1988. It was considered the most important item of biblical antiquities in the Israel Museum’s collection.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

In 2004, the Investigative Committee of Israel alleged it was a part of an antiquities fraud and was involved with other suspected archaeological forgeries such as the [[Jehoash Inscription]]. This resulted in a major investigation by the committee which determined that the artifact dated back to the 14th or 13th century B.C. and that the inscription was a modern forgery. Professor [[Aaron Demsky]] claims that there is an 80 percent certainty that the inscription is a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bib-arch.org/news/news-ivory-pomegranate.asp Leading Israeli Scientist Declares Pomegranate Inscription Authentic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115025132/http://www.bib-arch.org/news/news-ivory-pomegranate.asp |date=2010-01-15 }}", ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'', (December 16, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bib-arch.org/online-exclusives/ivory-pomegranate-02.asp Is the Ivory Pomegranate a Forgery or Authentic?], ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4123595.stm Ivory pomegranate 'not Solomon's'], BBC, (December 24, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bib-arch.org/online-exclusives/ivory-pomegranate-02.asp Analysis of Photographs]", ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'', (August 18, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Israeli police filed criminal [[indictment]]s against [[Oded Golan]], accusing him of forging biblical artifacts. This was the first time a criminal court had been asked to rule in a case of antiquities forgery.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/30/international/middleeast/30mideast.html?_r=1|title=Israel Indicts 4 in 'Brother of Jesus' Hoax and Other Forgeries|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|author=Myre, Greg|date=2004-12-30|accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On March 14, 2012 Golan was acquitted of all charges of forgery after the judge found that police had failed to prove forgery beyond all reasonable doubt. Although the indictment alleged that the pomegranate inscription was a forgery, as it was not included in the individual counts the judge did not consider its authenticity in his findings. Judge Aharon Farkash stated that the acquittal did not mean that the objects were "true and authentic".&lt;ref name="biblicalarchaeology1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/news/verdict-not-guilty/ |title=Verdict: Not Guilty - Biblical Archaeology Society |website=Biblicalarchaeology.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Matthew Kalman |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/antiquities-collector-acquitted-of-forgery-charges-in-james-ossuary-case/article2368752/ |title=Antiquities collector acquitted of forgery charges in 'James ossuary' case |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date= |accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="biblicalarchaeology1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail1"/&gt;

In May 2007, three members of the original investigative committee re-examined the inscription to evaluate the counter-arguments of [[André Lemaire]]), who was invited to join them. Shmuel Ahituv, Aaron Demsky and Yuval Goren, while changing their minds on a few points, maintained that the inscription was a forgery, while Lemaire maintained that it was authentic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shmuel Ahituv |author2=Aaron Demsky |author3=Yuval Goren |author4=[[André Lemaire]] | title = The Inscribed Pomegranate from the Israel Museum Examined Again | journal = Israel Exploration Journal | volume = 57 | number = 1 | year = 2007 | pages = 87–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2008, Prof. Yitzhak Roman wrote that the inscription shows no signs of being a forgery. The two main points were that, first, the existing letters are in fact truncated by an ancient crack (contradicting the 2004 analysis), and second, that the patina inside the letters was not glued in place but natural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bib-arch.org/news/news-ivory-pomegranate.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115025132/http://www.bib-arch.org/news/news-ivory-pomegranate.asp |archivedate=January 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kathmandu Valley''' ({{lang-ne|काठमाडौं उपत्यका}}, [[Newar language|Nepal Bhasa]]: स्वनिगः, नेपाः गाः), historically known as '''Nepal Valley''' or '''Nepa Valley''', lies at the crossroads of ancient civilizations of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the broader [[Asia]]n continent, and has at least 130 important monuments, including several pilgrimage sites for [[Hindu]]s and [[Buddhism|Buddhists]]. There are seven [[World Heritage Site]]s within the valley.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/121|title=Kathmandu Valley|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org|accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the valley and adjoining areas made up a confederation known as the [[Nepal Mandala]]. Until the 15th century, [[Bhaktapur]] was its capital, when two other capitals, [[Kathmandu]] and [[Patan, Nepal|Lalitpur (Patan)]], were established.&lt;ref&gt;Slusser, Mary (1982). ''Nepal Mandala: A Cultural Study of the Kathmandu Valley.'' Princeton University. {{ISBN|978-0-691-03128-6}}. Page vii.&lt;/ref&gt; After the annexation of the valley by the [[Gorkha Kingdom]], and subsequent conversion of the Valley as the capital of their empire, the designation of "Nepal" was extended to all the lands they had conquered.

The Kathmandu Valley is the most developed and populated place in Nepal. The majority of offices and headquarters are located in the valley, making it the economic hub of Nepal. It is popular with tourists for its unique architecture, and rich culture that includes the highest number of [[jatra (Nepal)|jatras]] (street festivals) in Nepal. The valley itself was referred to as "Nepal Proper" by British historians.

In 2015, Kathmandu Valley was hit by the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://drrportal.gov.np/|publisher=Government of Nepal|title=Nepal Disaster Risk Reduction Portal|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earthquake caused thousands of deaths and destruction of many infrastructures across the Kathmandu Valley, which includes the towns of [[Lalitpur, Nepal|Lalitpur]], [[Kirtipur]], [[Madhyapur Thimi]], [[Bhaktapur]] making the total population to roughly five million people and the municipalities across Kathmandu valley. Kathmandu is also the largest metropolis in the [[Himalayas|Himalayan hill region]].

== Etymology ==
''Kathmandu'' is not the native name used by the indigenous [[Newars|Nepa people]] of the valley. The term "Nepa-al" means "land of the Nepa people" and was traditionally used to refer this valley.&lt;ref&gt;Rajendra S. Khadka ''Travelers' Tales Nepal''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pahari name ''Kathmandu'' comes from a structure in [[Durbar Square]] called by the [[Sanskrit]] name ''Kāsṣtha mandapa'' "Wooden shelter". It was destroyed in the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|2015 earthquake]]. This unique temple, also known as the ''Maru Sattal'', was built in 1596 by King Lakshminarasimha [[Malla (Nepal)|Malla]]. The entire structure contained no iron nails or supports and was made entirely from wood. Legend has it that the timber used for this two-story [[pagoda]] was obtained from a single tree.

== Area of Kavre ==
City of [[Banepa]], [[Panauti]] and [[Dhulikhel]] is also considered part of Kathmandu valley as it has a similar culture.

== History ==
The Kathmandu Valley may have been inhabited as early as 300 BCE, since the oldest known objects in the valley date to a few hundred years BCE. The earliest known inscription is dated 185 CE. The oldest firmly dated building in the earthquake-prone valley is over 2,000 years old. Four [[stupa]]s around the city of Patan that are said to have been erected by a [[Charumati]], a purported daughter of the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] emperor [[Ashoka]], in the third century BCE, attest to the ancient history present within the valley. As with the tales of the Buddha's visit, there is no evidence supporting Ashok's visit, but the stupas probably date to that century. The [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Licchavis]], whose earliest inscriptions date to 464, were the next rulers of the valley and had close ties with the [[Gupta Empire]] of India. The [[Malla (Nepal)|Mallas]] ruled the Kathmandu Valley and the surrounding area from the 12th until the 18th century CE, when the [[Shah dynasty]] of the [[Gorkha Kingdom]] under [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] conquered the valley as he created present-day Nepal. His victory in the [[Battle of Kirtipur]] was the beginning of his conquest of the valley.

=== Newars ===
The [[Newars]] are the indigenous inhabitants and the creators of the historic civilization of the valley. Their language is today known as [[Newar language|Nepal Bhasa]].&lt;ref name="von Furer-Haimendorf 1956"&gt;{{cite journal | last =von Furer-Haimendorf| first =Christoph| authorlink = | coauthors = | jstor = 2843991| title =Elements of Newar Social Structure| work = Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute| publisher =Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland| year=1956|page=15 | volume=86 | doi=10.2307/2843991}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are understood to be the descendants of the various ethnic and racial groups that have inhabited and ruled the valley in the two-millennium history of the place. Scholars have also described the Newars as a [[nation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft6k4007rd&amp;chunk.id=d0e550&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d0e550&amp;brand=ucpress|title=Mesocosm|website=publishing.cdlib.org|accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have developed a division of labour and a sophisticated urban civilization not seen elsewhere in the Himalayan foothills. They are known for their contributions to art, sculpture, architecture, culture, literature, music, industry, trade, agriculture and cuisine, and left their mark on the art of Central Asia.

Newa architecture consists of the [[pagoda]], [[stupa]], [[shikhara]], [[chaitya]] and other styles. The valley's trademark is the multiple-roofed pagoda which may have originated in this area and spread to India, China, Indochina and Japan.&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/areahandbookforn00amer|title=Area handbook for Nepal (with Sikkim and Bhutan)|first1=D.

At present, people from other parts of Nepal tend to migrate to the valley for a better life due to its high level of cultural and economic development. Even with urbanization taking pace, the Newars have sustained their culture in Kathmandu Valley.

[[File:Syambhunath Stupa.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Swayambhunath|Swayamhbu Stupa]]]]
According to Swayambhu Puran, the Kathmandu Valley was once a lake, deemed by scientists as [[Paleo Kathmandu Lake]]. The hill where the [[Swayambhunath|Swayambu Stupa]] rests had lotus plants with flowers in bloom. One story says that the God [[Manjusri]] cut a gorge at a valley called Kashapaal (later called Chobhar) with a sword called Chandrahrasha and drained away the waters in order to establish a habitable land.

According to Gopal Banshawali, [[Krishna]] cut the gorge with his [[Sudarshana Chakra]] to let the water out. He then handed the drained valley to the Gopal Vansi people, who were nomadic cow herders.

== Geography ==
[[File:Airport and himalaya.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Mountain view from Kathmandu Valley]]
Kathmandu [[valley]] is bowl-shaped. Its central lower part stands at {{convert|1425|m}} above [[sea level]]. [[Kathmandu]] valley is surrounded by four mountain ranges: [[Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park|Shivapuri]] (at an elevation of {{convert|2800|m|disp=or}}), [[Phulchoki|Phulchowki]] ({{convert|2795|m|disp=or}}), [[Nagarjun (mountain range)|Nagarjun]] ({{convert|2825|m|disp=or}}) and [[Chandragiri Hill, Nepal|Chandragiri]] ({{convert|2551|m|disp=or}}). The major river flowing through the Kathmandu Valley is the [[Bagmati River|Bagmati]].

The valley is made up of the [[Kathmandu District]], [[Lalitpur District, Nepal|Lalitpur District]] and [[Bhaktapur District]] covering an area of {{convert|220|sqmi}}. The valley consists of the municipal areas of [[Kathmandu]], [[Patan, Nepal|Patan]], [[Bhaktapur]], [[Kirtipur]] and [[Madhyapur Thimi]]; the remaining area is made up of a number of [[Municipalities of Nepal|municipalities]] and [[Gaunpalika|rural municipalities]] (in Lalitpur district). The valley is a cultural and political hub of Nepal. The Kathmandu valley was accorded the status of a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in the year 1979.

In the past, Tibetan Buddhist Masters including Marpa, Milarepa, Rwa Lotsava, Ras Chungpa, Dharma Swami, XIII Karmapa, XVI Karmapa and several others visited and travelled in the Kathmandu Valley. However, the largest group of Tibetans came in the 1960s. Many settled around the Swayambhunath and Boudhanath Stupas. Many other famous Lamas known throughout the world have their Buddhist monasteries and centers in the Kathmandu Valley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lumbini.org.uk/Tibetan_Buddhism_kathmandu.htm Observation on the influence of Tibetan Buddhism in the Kathmandu Valley:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120040814/http://www.lumbini.org.uk/Tibetan_Buddhism_kathmandu.htm |date=2008-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1500-year history of funerary architecture in the valley provides some of the finest examples of stone architecture found in the subcontinent. A ''[[caitya]]'' is placed in almost all courtyards in cities like [[Patan, Nepal|Patan]].&lt;ref&gt;Gutschow, Niels (1997).

Pages 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stone inscriptions in the Kathmandu Valley]] are important sources for the history of Nepal.

Notes:
# Some [[linguistics|linguists]] argue that [[Galician language|Galician]], spoken in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], is merely a dialect of Portuguese rather than an independent language; this would make northwestern [[Spain]] a part of the Portuguese-speaking world.
# [[Macau]] is not a sovereign nation. It is one of the two [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Regions of the People's Republic of China]] (the other being [[English language|Anglophone]] [[Hong Kong]], a former [[United Kingdom|British]] colony).
# [[Equatorial Guinea]] adopted Portuguese as one of its official languages in 2007, being admitted to CPLP in 2014. The use of the Portuguese language in this country is limited. However, a Portuguese-based creole language, [[Annobonese Creole]], is used, mainly on islands of [[Annobon]] and [[Bioko]].
#[[Uruguayan Portuguese|15% of Uruguay's population speaks Portuguese]] (in the northern areas closer to Brazil) as a native language but it is not an official language in any capacity. A similar blending of Portuguese, Spanish, and [[Guarani language|Guarani]] ([[Jopara language|Jopara]]) occurs along the border with [[Paraguay]].

==Spread of Portuguese==
During a [[Age of Discovery|period of Portuguese discoveries]] and through a [[Portuguese Empire|large colonial empire]], the language was spread to areas in Africa, Asia and the Americas. [[Portuguese-based creole languages]] also developed during this era.

Today, Portuguese continues to thrive outside the [[Lusophone|Lusophone world]] through the presence of large expat communities of [[Brazilian diaspora|Brazilians]], [[Portuguese diaspora|Portuguese]], [[Cape Verdean diaspora|Cape Verdeans]], and [[:Template:Angolan diaspora|Angolans]] found throughout the world.

===Europe===

====Portugal====
Portuguese is spoken as a first language in Portugal by nearly all of the nation's 10.6 million people.&lt;ref name="Special Eurobarometer 243"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf |title=Special Eurobarometer 243 "Europeans and their Languages"|year=2006|page=6|publisher= European Commission|accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancestor of modern Portuguese, [[Galician-Portuguese]],{{clarify|date=January 2013}} began developing in the northwest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], in an area encompassing present-day northern-Portugal and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], at around the 9th century. Modern Portuguese started developing in the early 16th century{{clarify|date=January 2013}}. 

====Rest of Europe====
The [[Galician language]], spoken natively in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia, Spain]], is a dialect of Portuguese, according to many linguists, which makes northwestern Spain a lusophone region.
Portuguese-speaking immigrants from Portugal, Brazil, Portuguese-speaking Africa and Macau have also settled in [[Andorra]] (around 15 000 speakers), [[Belgium]], [[France]] (around 500 000 speakers), Germany, [[Luxembourg]], Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In Luxembourg, 19% of the population speaks Portuguese as mother tongue, making it the largest minority language by percentage in a Western European country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf Special Eurobarometer 386 Europeans and their Languages]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americas===

====Brazil====

With a population of over 205 million, Brazil is by far the world's largest Portuguese-speaking nation and the only one in the Americas.&lt;ref name="CIA Geo"&gt;{{cite web |title=Geography of Brazil |booktitle=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |year=2008 |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/br.html |accessdate=2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portuguese was introduced during the [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese colonial period]]. Portuguese has also served as a [[lingua franca]] between the various ethnic groups in Brazil and the native Amerindian population&lt;ref&gt;Darcy Ribeiro. O Povo Brasileiro, Vol. 07, 1997 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; after the Jesuits were expelled from every Portuguese territory and the languages associated with them prohibited.

Portuguese is the first language of the overwhelming majority of Brazilians, at 99.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/brazil/39.htm |title=Portuguese language in Brazil |publisher=Countrystudies.us |date= |accessdate=2012-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is followed by [[German language|various German dialects]], such as [[Riograndenser Hunsrückisch]], at a distant 1.94% ([[Geographical distribution of German speakers|co-official status]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/hrx|title=Hunsrückish|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/country/BR|title=Standard German|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The [[Brazilian Portuguese|form of Portuguese spoken in Brazil]] is a little different from that [[European Portuguese|spoken in Europe]], with differences in vocabulary and grammar that can be compared to the [[Comparison of American and British English|differences between American and British English]],&lt;ref name = "dummies"&gt;{{cite book| author = Logan Gaspar| title = Portuguese For Dummies| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EBK3o4GWqrgC&amp;pg=PA9| date = 2006-08-07| publisher = Wiley| isbn = 978-0-470-04973-0| page = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but with the [[phonology]] and [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] more distinct to{{clarify|date=January 2013}} each other (on a slightly larger scale than that of the Metropolitan and [[Quebec French|Québécois]] varieties of [[French language|French]]);{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} nevertheless, European and Brazilian Portuguese are completely mutually intelligible{{clarify|date=January 2013}}. The vast majority of Brazilian characteristics are also found in some rural, remote Portuguese registers{{clarify|date=January 2013}} (or the African and Asian ones, indicating an Old Portuguese feature lost in Europe), &lt;ref name="Origens do Português Brasileiro"&gt;{{cite book| author = Anthony Julius Naro and Maria Marta Pereira Scherre| title = Origens do Português Brasileiro| url = http://www.parabolaeditorial.com.br/loja/parábola/origens-do-português-brasileiro-detail.htm}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; while nearly all distinctive European characteristics can be found in any major dialect of Brazil (such as ''fluminense'', specially its ''[[carioca]]'' sociolect, and ''[[Florianopolitan dialect|florianopolitano]]''), due to a stronger or more recent Portuguese and other European [[Immigration to Brazil|immigration]].

[[Brazilian diaspora|Migration from Brazil]] also led to a great number of Portuguese speakers in the [[Southern Cone]] (especially [[Uruguay]] with ''[[Riverense Portuñol|portunhol da pampa]]''), [[Paraguay]] (see ''[[brasiguayos]]''), other regions of [[South America]] (especially Bolivia) except Venezuela, [[Japan]] (see [[Brazilians in Japan]] 400,000 and ''[[dekasegi]]'', official numbers do not include second generation Portuguese speakers and naturalized citizens), South Korea, the Philippines (see [[Brazilians in the Philippines]]), and Israel (see [[Aliyah from Latin America in the 2000s]]).

====Rest of South America====
Although Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in [[South America]], it has the largest population, area and economy on the continent. Thus, the South American trade bloc [[Mercosul]] uses Portuguese alongside Spanish as its working languages. A [[Uruguayan Portuguese|Spanish influenced Portuguese dialect]] is spoken in the northern [[Uruguay]]an border area with Brazil. Given the proximity and trading relations between Portuguese speaking Brazil, and its respective Spanish speaking nations, Portuguese is offered as a foreign (or obligatory) second language course at most schools in [[Uruguay]], [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Bolivia]].

In [[Venezuela]] and [[Guyana]], there are communities of Portuguese immigrants (mostly [[Madeira Island|Madeirans]]) and their descendants who speak Portuguese as their native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guyana.org/special/portuguese.html |title=Portuguese emigration from Madeira to British Guiana |publisher=Guyana.org |date=2000-05-07 |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
{{See also|Portuguese-speaking African countries|Portuguese in Africa}}

====Angola====
Portuguese is the sole official language of Angola, and 85% of the population professes fluency in the language.&lt;ref name="Portuguese in Africa – Angola"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linguaportuguesa.ufrn.br/pt_3.4.a.php |title=A língua portuguesa |publisher=Linguaportuguesa.ufrn.br |date= |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, 75% of Angolan households speak Portuguese as their primary language, and native [[Bantu languages]] have been influenced by Portuguese through loanwords.&lt;ref name="Portuguese in Africa – Angola"/&gt;

====Mozambique====
Portuguese is the sole official language of Mozambique and serves as a [[lingua franca]] between the various ethnic groups in the country. Slightly over 30% of the population are native speakers of Portuguese, while 65% professes fluency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linguaportuguesa.ufrn.br/pt_3.4.d.php |title=A língua portuguesa |publisher=Linguaportuguesa.ufrn.br |date= |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Mozambican media is available solely in Portuguese, and the country receives several Portuguese and Brazilian television stations.

====Guinea-Bissau====
Despite being the sole official language, only 50% of the population professes fluency in Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linguaportuguesa.ufrn.br/pt_3.4.c.php |title=A língua portuguesa |publisher=Linguaportuguesa.ufrn.br |date= |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a Portuguese-based creole called [[Guinea-Bissau Creole]] (Kriol) is spoken by nearly the whole population.

====Cape Verde====
Similar to Guinea-Bissau, although Portuguese is the only official language, a Portuguese-based [[Creole language|creole]] known as [[Cape Verdean Creole]] is spoken by the majority of the population. Most Cape Verdeans are fluent in Portuguese as well. Education and media are available largely in standard European Portuguese only.

====São Tomé and Príncipe====
In São Tomé and Príncipe, Portuguese is by far the most spoken language, with around 95% of the population speaking it at home or professing fluency.{{efn|99.8% declared speaking Portuguese in the 1991 census}} A Portuguese-based creole called [[Forro language|Forro]] is also spoken.

====Equatorial Guinea====
Equatorial Guinea was a Spanish colony between 1778 and 1968 and was originally a group of Portuguese colonies between 1474 and 1778. A [[Portuguese creole]] is spoken by locals on the island of [[Annobón]].

In 2007, President Teodoro Obiang Nguema announced a decision to make Portuguese the third official language of the country after Spanish and French. This was in an effort by the government to improve its communications, trade, and bilateral relations with Portuguese-speaking countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/equatorial-guinea-adds-portuguese-as-the-countrys-third-official-language-131882808.html |title=Equatorial Guinea Adds Portuguese as the Country's Third Official Language |publisher=PRNewsWire |date=2011-10-14 |accessdate=2010-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite government promotions, Portuguese remains rarely spoken in Equatorial Guinea, but increased political and trade relations with Portuguese-speaking nations i.e., Brazil, Angola, Portugal, will soon increase the numbers of Portuguese speakers in this country. News, sports, and entertainment media in Portuguese will undoubtedly also facilitate increased comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;''Público'' (Lisbon), 2012-07-20&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the population (~90%){{citation needed|date=January 2013}} still speaks Spanish as its primary language, and Spanish is still the administrative language and that of education, while French is the second official language.&lt;ref name="GEpress_noticia134en"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guineaecuatorialpress.com/noticia.php?id=134&amp;lang=en |title=VILLAGES AND CULTURES - Official Web Page of the Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea |publisher=Guineaecuatorialpress.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rest of Africa====
Large Portuguese-speaking communities are found in [[Namibia]], [[South Africa]] and [[Zambia]] due to immigration from the Lusophone African countries. Portuguese is also being taught in the schools of these countries.

===Asia &amp; Oceania===
{{See also|Portuguese language in Asia}}

====East Timor====
{{See also|East Timorese Portuguese}}
Portuguese is co-official with [[Tetum language|Tetum]] in East Timor and was introduced during the [[Portuguese Timor|colonial period]]. A little under 39% of the population professes fluency in Portuguese. and number is steadily growing. It is believed that Portuguese will be the primary language of East Timor in as few as 5 to 10 years. The local Tetum language has been heavily influenced by Portuguese through loanwords, and [[code-switching]] between the two languages is common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/04/20/timor-leste-tetum-portuguese-bahasa-indonesia-or-english.html |title=Timor Leste, Tetum, Portuguese, Bahasa Indonesia or English?|publisher=Thejakartapost.com |date=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Macau====
{{See also|Macanese Portuguese}}
[[Image:Macau-Chinese&amp;Portuguese.jpg|thumb|250px|A sign in Macau translated in both official languages, Portuguese and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]]]
[[File:CalcadaSaoPaulomacau.jpg|thumb|Portuguese and Chinese, seen on this street sign, are official languages in Macau]]
Due to the [[one country, two systems]] policy of [[China]] regarding its [[special administrative region]]s, Macau is able to retain Portuguese as an official language alongside [[Cantonese]]. Portuguese was first introduced to Macau when Portuguese traders established a permanent settlement there in 1537. Despite being a Portuguese colony for over four centuries, the Portuguese language was never widely spoken in Macau and remained limited to administration and higher education and was spoken primarily by the Portuguese colonists, [[Macanese people]] of mixed ancestry, and elites and middle-class people of pure Chinese blood. As a consequence, when Macau was handed back to China in 1999, Portuguese did not have a strong presence like English had in [[Hong Kong]] and continued its decline which began when Portuguese rule was still occurring. It was only after Portuguese rule ended when the Portuguese language in Macau began to see an increase in speakers due to China's increased trading relations with Lusophone countries. There has been an increase in the teaching of Portuguese owing to the growing trade links between China and [[lusophone]] nations such as Portugal, [[Brazil]], [[Angola]], [[Mozambique]], and [[East Timor]], with 5,000 students learning the language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E1D8103AF932A15753C1A9629C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all China Sees Advantages in Macao's Portuguese Past], ''[[New York Times]]'', October 21, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Today, about 3% of Macau's population speaks Portuguese as a first language and 7% of the population professes fluency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Leach |first=Michael |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6469/is_92/ai_n29406744/ |title=talking Portuguese; China and East Timor |accessdate=2011-05-18 |work=Arena Magazine |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105033001/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6469/is_92/ai_n29406744/ |archivedate=2011-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Portuguese creole called [[Macanese language|Macanese]] (Patuá) was spoken by Macanese of mixed ancestry but is near extinction today.

====Goa (India)====
Portuguese is present in the enclave of [[Goa]], which was a Portuguese colony until 1961. Although it was the sole official language during [[Portuguese India|Portuguese colonial rule]], it is mostly spoken by the elderly and educated populations today and is not an official language. Rather, Goa's official state language is [[Konkani language|Konkani]], which has however picked up some Portuguese vocabulary as a legacy of Portuguese influence. Attempts to make Konkani be written in the [[Portuguese alphabet]] and possibilities of reintroducing Portuguese as a co-official language of Goa have been made in recent years; presently Portuguese is officially teaching there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.navhindtimes.com/story.php?story=2008091733| title=Konkani:The Tussule over the script|publisher=[[Navhind Times]] |accessdate=18 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portuguese rule in [[Daman and Diu]] has also left a smaller Portuguese influence on the territory. A Portuguese-based creole called [[Língua da Casa]] is spoken in the territory. As a result of the renewed interest in the Portuguese language and culture, the Portuguese language is making an impressive comeback. Portuguese is still taught in some schools in Goa.

Portuguese were also in the area of Vasai (present), previously Bassein or Bacaim since 1560 until 1739. Though the Portuguese were defeated by Marathas, there are some words which are used by the locals which are words in the Portuguese language. Today there is a large Catholic population, and many churches built during those days are still being used for worship.

====Rest of Asia====
Portuguese is spoken in [[Japan]] among [[Japanese Brazilian|returned immigrants (500,000) or migrant workers from Brazil]] known as ''[[dekasegi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.instituto-camoes.pt/encarte-jl/portugues-a-3-lingua-materna-do-japao.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124195000/http://www.instituto-camoes.pt/encarte-jl/portugues-a-3-lingua-materna-do-japao.html |date=January 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japanese words of Portuguese origin|Portuguese loanwords]] are also present in the [[Japanese language]] due to trading relations between Japan and the [[Portuguese Empire]] in the 16th century. Portuguese is now part of the curriculum in many Japanese schools, and many radio and television stations are broadcast exclusively in the Portuguese language.

In [[Malacca]], [[Malaysia]], a Portuguese creole known as ''[[Kristang language|Papiá Kristang]]'' or ''Cristão'' is still spoken by some of the Eurasian population.

'''''The Lives of Flemish, German, and Dutch painters''''' refers to a compilation of artist biographies by [[Jean-Baptiste Descamps]] published in the mid 18th-century that were accompanied by illustrations by [[Charles Eisen]]. The list of illustrations follows and is in page order by volume. Most of the biographies were translated into French from earlier work by [[Karel van Mander]] and [[Arnold Houbraken]]. The illustrated portraits were mostly based on engravings by [[Jan Meyssens]] for [[Het Gulden Cabinet]] and by Arnold and [[Jacobus Houbraken]] for their ''[[Schouburgh]]'', while the work examples engraved in the margins of the portraits were mostly based on engravings by [[Jacob Campo Weyerman]].

'''Luigi Pirandello''' ({{IPA-it|luˈiːdʒi piranˈdɛllo|lang}}) (28 June 1867 – 10 December 1936) was an [[Italians|Italian]] dramatist, novelist, poet, and short story writer whose greatest contributions were his plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1934/pirandello-bio.html|title=Luigi Pirandello - Biographical|author=|date=|website=www.nobelprize.org|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the 1934 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] for "his almost magical power to turn psychological analysis into good theatre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1934/press.html|title=Nobelprize.org|author=|date=|website=www.nobelprize.org|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pirandello's works include novels, hundreds of short stories, and about 40 plays, some of which are written in [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]. Pirandello's tragic farces are often seen as forerunners of the [[Theatre of the Absurd]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[File:Luigi Pirandello 1884.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Pirandello in 1884.]]
Pirandello was born into an upper-class family in the village of u Càvusu (Chaos), a poor suburb of Girgenti ([[Agrigento]], a town in southern [[Sicily]]). His father, Stefano, belonged to a wealthy family involved in the sulphur industry, and his mother, Caterina Ricci Gramitto, was also of a well-to-do background, descending from a family of the bourgeois professional class of Agrigento. Both families, the Pirandellos and the Ricci Gramittos, were ferociously anti-[[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] and actively participated in the struggle for unification and democracy ("[[Italian unification|Il Risorgimento]]"). Stefano participated in the famous [[Expedition of the Thousand]], later following [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] all the way to the [[battle of Aspromonte]], and Caterina, who had hardly reached the age of thirteen, was forced to accompany her father to [[Malta]], where he had been sent into exile by the Bourbon [[monarchy]]. But the open participation in the Garibaldian cause and the strong sense of idealism of those early years were quickly transformed, above all in Caterina, into an angry and bitter disappointment with the new reality created by the unification. Pirandello would eventually assimilate this sense of betrayal and resentment and express it in several of his poems and in his novel ''The Old and the Young''. It is also probable that this climate of disillusion inculcated in the young Luigi the sense of disproportion between ideals and reality which is recognizable in his essay on humorism (''L'Umorismo''). [[File:Pirandello - L'Umorismo, 1908.djvu|thumb|page=7|''L'Umorismo'', 1908]]

Pirandello received his elementary education at home but was much more fascinated by the fables and legends, somewhere between popular and magic, that his elderly servant Maria Stella used to recount to him than by anything scholastic or academic. By the age of twelve he had already written his first tragedy. At the insistence of his father, he was registered at a technical school but eventually switched to the study of the humanities at the ''[[gymnasium (school)|ginnasio]]'', something which had always attracted him.

In 1880, the Pirandello family moved to [[Palermo]]. It was here, in the capital of Sicily, that Luigi completed his high school education. He also began reading omnivorously, focusing, above all, on 19th-century Italian poets such as [[Giosuè Carducci]] and [[Arturo Graf]]. He then started writing his first poems and fell in love with his cousin Lina.

During this period the first signs of serious contrast between Luigi and his father began to develop; Luigi had discovered some notes revealing the existence of Stefano's extramarital relations. As a reaction to the ever-increasing distrust and disharmony that Luigi was developing toward his father, a man of a robust physique and crude manners, his attachment to his mother would continue growing to the point of profound veneration. This later expressed itself, after her death, in the moving pages of the novella ''Colloqui con i personaggi'' in 1915.

His romantic feelings for his cousin, [[Cousin marriage|initially looked upon with disfavour]], were suddenly taken very seriously by Lina's family. They demanded that Luigi abandon his studies and dedicate himself to the sulphur business so that he could immediately marry her. In 1886, during a vacation from school, Luigi went to visit the sulphur mines of [[Porto Empedocle]] and started working with his father. This experience was essential to him and would provide the basis for such stories as ''Il Fumo'', ''Ciàula scopre la Luna'' as well as some of the descriptions and background in the novel ''The Old and the Young''. The marriage, which seemed imminent, was postponed.

Pirandello then registered at the [[University of Palermo]] in the departments of Law and of Letters. The campus at Palermo, and above all the Department of Law, was the centre in those years of the vast movement which would eventually evolve into the [[Fasci Siciliani]]. Although Pirandello was not an active member of this movement, he had close ties of friendship with its leading ideologists: [[Rosario Garibaldi Bosco]], [[Enrico La Loggia]], [[Giuseppe De Felice Giuffrida]] and [[Francesco De Luca]].&lt;ref name=bonghi&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.classicitaliani.it/bonghiG/bonghi_bio_Pirandello.htm Biografia di Luigi Pirandello] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620131313/http://www.classicitaliani.it/bonghiG/bonghi_bio_Pirandello.htm |date=20 June 2010 }}, Biblioteca dei Classici italiani di Giuseppe Bonghi (Accessed 2 November 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Higher education===
In 1887, having definitively chosen the Department of Letters, he moved to [[Rome]] in order to continue his studies. But the encounter with the city, centre of the struggle for unification to which the families of his parents had participated with generous enthusiasm, was disappointing and nothing close to what he had expected. "When I arrived in Rome it was raining hard, it was night time and I felt like my heart was being crushed, but then I laughed like a man in the throes of desperation."{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Pirandello, who was an extremely sensitive moralist, finally had a chance to see for himself the irreducible decadence of the so-called heroes of the [[Risorgimento]] in the person of his uncle Rocco, now a greying and exhausted functionary of the prefecture who provided him with temporary lodgings in Rome. The "desperate laugh", the only manifestation of revenge for the disappointment undergone, inspired the bitter verses of his first collection of poems, ''Mal Giocondo'' (1889). But not all was negative; this first visit to Rome provided him with the opportunity to assiduously visit the many theatres of the capital: Il Nazionale, Il Valle, il Manzoni. "Oh the dramatic theatre! I will conquer it. I cannot enter into one without experiencing a strange sensation, an excitement of the blood through all my veins..."

Because of a conflict with a Latin professor, he was forced to leave the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] and went to [[University of Bonn|Bonn]] with a letter of presentation from one of his other professors. The stay in Bonn, which lasted two years, was fervid with cultural life. He read the German romantics, [[Jean Paul]], [[Ludwig Tieck|Tieck]], [[Chamisso]], [[Heinrich Heine]] and [[Goethe]]. He began translating the ''[[Roman Elegies]]'' of Goethe, composed the ''Elegie Boreali'' in imitation of the style of the ''Roman Elegies'', and he began to meditate on the topic of humorism by way of the works of [[Cecco Angiolieri]].

In March 1891 he received his doctorate in Romance Philology&lt;ref name="collier"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Bergin |first=Thomas G |editor=William D. Halsey |encyclopedia=Collier's Encyclopedia |title=Pirandello, Luigi |year=1976 |publisher=Macmillan Educational Corporation |volume=19 |location=New York |pages=76–78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a dissertation on the dialect of Agrigento: ''Sounds and Developments of Sounds in the Speech of Craperallis''.

===Marriage===
After a brief sojourn in Sicily, during which the planned marriage with his cousin was finally called off, he returned to Rome, where he became friends with a group of writer-journalists including Ugo Fleres, Tomaso Gnoli, Giustino Ferri and [[Luigi Capuana]]. Capuana encouraged Pirandello to dedicate himself to [[narrative|narrative writing]]. In 1893 he wrote his first important work, ''Marta Ajala'', which was published in 1901 as ''l'Esclusa''. In 1894 he published his first collection of short stories, ''Amori senza Amore''. He married in 1894 as well. Following his father's suggestion he married a shy, withdrawn girl of a good family of Agrigentine origin educated by the nuns of San Vincenzo: Antonietta Portulano.

The first years of matrimony brought on in him a new fervour for his studies and writings: his encounters with his friends and the discussions on art continued, more vivacious and stimulating than ever, while his family life, despite the complete incomprehension of his wife with respect to the artistic vocation of her husband,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} proceeded relatively tranquilly with the birth of two sons (Stefano and Fausto) and a daughter (Lietta). In the meantime, Pirandello intensified his collaborations with newspaper editors and other journalists in magazines such as ''La Critica'' and ''La Tavola Rotonda'' in which he published, in 1895, the first part of the ''Dialoghi tra Il Gran Me e Il Piccolo Me''.

In 1897 he accepted an offer to teach Italian at the Istituto Superiore di Magistero di Roma, and in the magazine ''Marzocco'' he published several more pages of the ''Dialoghi''. In 1898, with Italo Falbo and Ugo Fleres, he founded the weekly ''Ariel'', in which he published the one-act play ''L'Epilogo'' (later changed to ''La Morsa'') and some novellas (La Scelta, Se...). The end of the 19th century and the beginnings of the 20th were a period of extreme productivity for Pirandello. In 1900, he published in ''Marzocco'' some of the most celebrated of his novellas (''Lumie di Sicilia'', ''La Paura del Sonno''...) and, in 1901, the collection of poems ''Zampogna''. In 1902 he published the first series of ''Beffe della Morte e della Vita'' and his second novel, ''Il Turno''.

===Family disaster===
The year 1903 was fundamental to the life of Pirandello. The flooding of the sulphur mines of [[Aragona]], in which his father Stefano had invested not only an enormous amount of his own capital but also Antonietta's [[dowry]], precipitated the collapse of the family. Antonietta, after opening and reading the letter announcing the catastrophe, entered into a state of semi-[[catatonia]] and underwent such a psychological shock that her mental balance remained profoundly and irremediably shaken.

Pirandello, who had initially harboured thoughts of suicide, attempted to remedy the situation as best he could by increasing the number of his lessons in both Italian and German and asking for compensation from the magazines to which he had freely given away his writings and collaborations. In the magazine ''New Anthology'', directed by G. Cena, meanwhile, the novel which Pirandello had been writing while in this horrible situation (watching over his mentally ill wife at night after an entire day spent at work) began appearing in episodes. The title was ''Il Fu Mattia Pascal'' (''The Late Mattia Pascal''). This novel contains many autobiographical elements that have been fantastically re-elaborated. It was an immediate and resounding success. Translated into German in 1905, this novel paved the way to the notoriety and fame which allowed Pirandello to publish for the more important editors such as ''Treves'', with whom he published, in 1906, another collection of novellas ''Erma Bifronte''. In 1908 he published a volume of essays entitled ''Arte e Scienza'' and the important essay ''L'Umorismo'', in which he initiated the legendary debate with [[Benedetto Croce]] that would continue with increasing bitterness and venom on both sides for many years.

In 1909 the first part of ''I Vecchi e I Giovani'' was published in episodes. This novel retraces the history of the failure and repression of the [[Fasci Siciliani]] in the period from 1893 to 1894. When the novel came out in 1913 Pirandello sent a copy of it to his parents for their fiftieth wedding anniversary along with a dedication which said that "their names, Stefano and Caterina, live heroically." However, while the mother is transfigured in the novel into the otherworldly figure of Caterina Laurentano, the father, represented by the husband of Caterina, Stefano Auriti, appears only in memories and flashbacks, since, as was acutely observed by [[Leonardo Sciascia]], "he died censured in a Freudian sense by his son who, in the bottom of his soul, is his enemy." Also in 1909, Pirandello began his collaboration with the prestigious journal ''Corriere della Sera'' in which he published the novellas ''Mondo di Carta'' (''World of Paper''), ''La Giara'', and, in 1910, ''Non è una cosa seria'' and ''Pensaci, Giacomino!'' (''Think it over, Giacomino!'') At this point Pirandello's fame as a writer was continually increasing. His private life, however, was poisoned by the suspicion and obsessive jealousy of Antonietta who began turning physically violent.

In 1911, while the publication of novellas and short stories continued, Pirandello finished his fourth novel, ''Suo Marito'', republished posthumously (1941), and completely revised in the first four chapters, with the title ''Giustino Roncella nato Boggiòlo''. During his life the author never republished this novel for reasons of discretion; within are implicit references to the writer [[Grazia Deledda]]. But the work which absorbed most of his energies at this time was the collection of stories ''La Vendetta del Cane'', ''Quando s'è capito il giuoco'', ''Il treno ha fischiato'', ''Filo d'aria'' and ''Berecche e la guerra''. They were all published from 1913 to 1914 and are all now considered classics of Italian literature.

===First World War===
As Italy entered the [[World War I|First World War]], Pirandello's son Stefano volunteered for service and was taken prisoner by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarians]]. In 1916 the actor Angelo Musco successfully recited the three-act comedy that the writer had extracted from the novella ''Pensaci, Giacomino!'' and the ''pastoral'' comedy ''[[Liolà]]''.

In 1917 the collection of novellas ''E domani Lunedì'' (''And Tomorrow, Monday...'') was published, but the year was mostly marked by important theatrical representations: ''Così è (se vi pare)'' (''Right you are (if you think so)''), ''A birrita cu' i ciancianeddi'' and ''Il Piacere dell'onestà'' (''The Pleasure Of Honesty''). A year later, ''Ma non è una cosa seria'' (''But It's Nothing Serious'') and ''[[Il Gioco delle parti]]'' (''The Game of Roles'') were all produced on stage. Pirandello's son Stefano returned home when the war ended.
[[File:Pirandello.jpg|thumb|Bust of Pirandello in a public park in Palermo]]

In 1919 Pirandello had his wife placed in an asylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rcpl2lEU9gYC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=In+1919+Pirandello+had+his+wife+placed+in+an+asylum.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OY0qXsxxIk&amp;sig=zTyYsnyfklDfIW0Cq4c2rkDORUc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiN9uXpq8jRAhXLQCYKHdgcBwYQ6AEILjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=In%201919%20Pirandello%20had%20his%20wife%20placed%20in%20an%20asylum.&amp;f=false|title=Pirandello and Film|last=Nichols|first=Nina daVinci|date=1995-01-01|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803233361|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The separation from his wife, despite her morbid jealousies and hallucinations, caused great suffering for Pirandello who, even as late as 1924, believed he could still properly care for her at home. She never left the asylum.

1920 was the year of comedies such as ''Tutto per bene'', ''Come prima meglio di prima'', and ''La Signora Morli''. In 1921, the ''Compagnia di Dario Niccomedi'' staged, at the Valle di Roma, the play, ''Sei personaggi in cerca d'autore'', ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]''. It was a clamorous failure. The public divided into supporters and adversaries, the latter of whom shouted, "Asylum, Asylum!" The author, who was present at the performance with his daughter Lietta, left through a side exit to avoid the crowd of enemies. The same drama, however, was a great success when presented in [[Milan]]. In 1922 in Milan, ''Enrico IV'' was performed for the first time and was acclaimed universally as a success. Pirandello's international reputation was developing as well. The ''Sei personaggi'' was performed in London and New York.

=== Italy under the Fascists ===
In 1925, Pirandello, with the help of [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]], assumed the artistic direction and ownership of the [[Teatro d'Arte di Roma]], founded by the Gruppo degli Undici. He described himself as "a Fascist because I am Italian." For his devotion to Mussolini, the satirical magazine ''[[Il Becco Giallo]]'' used to call him ''P. Randello'' (''randello'' in Italian means [[Club (weapon)|club]]).&lt;ref name="Chiesa1990p38"&gt;Chiesa, Adolfo (1990) [https://books.google.com/books?id=lnjqAAAAMAAJ ''La satira politica in Italia: con un'intervista a Tullio Pericoli''], p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

He expressed publicly apolitical belief, saying "I'm apolitical, I'm only a man in the world..."&lt;ref&gt;Giudice, p. 422.&lt;/ref&gt; He had continuous conflicts with famous fascist leaders. In 1927 he tore his fascist membership card to pieces in front of the startled secretary-general of the Fascist Party.&lt;ref&gt;Giudice, p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt; For the remainder of his life, Pirandello was always under close surveillance by the secret fascist police [[OVRA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.storiain.net/arret/num108/artic1.asp ''L'Ovra a Cinecittà'' di Natalia ed Emanuele V. Marino, Bollati Boringhieri, 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210010507/http://www.storiain.net/arret/num108/artic1.asp |date=10 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His play, ''The Giants of the Mountain'', has been interpreted as evidence of his realization that the fascists were hostile to culture; yet, during a later appearance in New York, Pirandello distributed a statement announcing his support of Italy's annexation of [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]]. He gave his Nobel Prize medal to the Fascist government to be melted down for the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Abyssinia Campaign]]. Mussolini's support brought him international fame and a worldwide tour, introducing his work to London, Paris, Vienna, Prague, Budapest, Germany, Argentina, and Brazil.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Pirandello's conception of the theatre underwent a significant change at this point. The idea of the actor as an inevitable betrayer of the text, as in the ''Sei personaggi,'' gave way to the identification of the actor with the character that they play. The company took their act throughout the major cities of Europe, and the Pirandellian repertoire became increasingly well known. Between 1925 and 1926 Pirandello's last and perhaps greatest novel, ''Uno, Nessuno e Centomila'' (''One, No one and One Hundred Thousand''), was published serially in the magazine ''Fiera Letteraria''.

Pirandello was nominated Academic of Italy in 1929, and in 1934 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for literature]] after he had been nominated by [[Guglielmo Marconi]], member of the [[Royal Academy of Italy]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show.php?id=5828|title=Nomination Database|author=|date=|website=www.nobelprize.org|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the last Italian playwright to be chosen for the award until 9 October 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first=Tony| last=Mitchell| title=Dario Fo: People's Court Jester (Updated and Expanded)| location=London| publisher=[[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]]| year=1999| page=204| isbn=0-413-73320-3| postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Andrew| last=Gumbel| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/nobel-prize-dario-fo-the-showman-wins-nobel-literature-prize-1234928.html| title=Nobel Prize: Dario Fo, the showman, wins Nobel literature prize| newspaper=[[The Independent]]| date=10 October 1997| accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pirandello died alone in his home at Via Bosio, Rome, on 10 December 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Giudice, pp. 117, 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Mork Goes Erk"''' is the seventeenth episode of the first season of ''[[Mork &amp; Mindy]]''.  The episode first premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on February 8, 1979.&lt;ref name="amg" /&gt;  "Mork Goes Erk" was later released on [[VHS]] on January 1, 1998 as part of a two-episode special which also included "Mork's First Christmas,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Staff | first = | coauthors = | title = Laugh Again With TV's Top Comedies | work = [[The Washington Post]] | pages = | language = | publisher =[[The Washington Post Company]] | date = September 10, 1995 | url = | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Mork &amp; Mindy Volume 2: Mork's First Christmas/Mork Goes Erk (1978)", [[Paramount Studios]], January 1, 1998, 50 minutes.&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[DVD]] on September 7, 2004 as part of the "Mork &amp; Mindy - The Complete First Season" DVD boxed set.&lt;ref&gt;"Mork &amp; Mindy - The Complete First Season", [[Paramount Studios]], September 4, 2004, UPC: 097360537949&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode, [[David Letterman]] portrayed a self-help group leader by the name of "Ellsworth" offering ERK or Ellsworth Revitalization Konditioning. [[Mork &amp; Mindy#Cast|Mork]] ([[Robin Williams]]) and Mindy ([[Pam Dawber]]) attend one of Ellsworth's trainings at the suggestion of their friend Susan ([[Morgan Fairchild]]), where they endure Ellsworth's [[authoritarian]] brand of [[group therapy]].  Mork points out hypocrisy in Ellsworth's teachings, and exposes him as a fraud.  The episode has been called a parody of the [[Erhard Seminars Training]] or "est" course.  The episode received mostly positive reviews, and was highlighted as one of the season's best episodes, along with "Mork's First Christmas" and "Mork's Mixed Emotions".  David Letterman's performance as "Ellsworth" also received good reviews.

== Plot ==
At the beginning of the episode, Mork, Mindy and Bickley ([[Tom Poston]]) are all sitting around feeling depressed.  Mindy has just learned that Mork's supervisor Orson has arranged for Mork to be transferred to another planet, and Bickley is suffering from [[writer's block]].  Their friend Susan comes by to visit, and suggests that they all go and attend a seminar on Ellsworth's Revitalization Konditioning.  As the guests arrive at the seminar, Ellsworth nervously asks Susan if all of the attendees' checks are in order.  He then lays out the rules for the duration of the training, which includes no leaving and no consumption of alcohol.  When Bickley hears this, he promptly gets up to leave the seminar.

The attendants of the seminar are then given Ellsworth's harsh version of reality, which has been compared to the tenets of [[Erhard Seminars Training]].  Ellsworth preaches a belief in self-adoration, which he says will get rid of emotional highs and lows.  Ellsworth centers this goal around the notion of "finding our own space."  He utilizes an [[authoritarian]] style of control within the group, as a [[therapy|therapeutic]] method to solve problems.  The other attendees at the seminar are shown to be passive [[consumer]]s looking for any way to fix their personal issues.  However, Mork, with his trademark causing of difficulty, begins to question the foundation of the rules of the course, as well as the nature of the philosophical material that Ellsworth has put forth, by pointing out [[hypocrisy]] among Ellsworth's own contradictory statements.  In the end, Mork wins out over the Ellsworth philosophy by instead calling to mind universal [[Humanism|humanistic]] moral values.  Ellsworth dismisses Mork's victory over his methodology, exclaiming: "I've got my Rolls-Royce!" Mork wins a moral victory-and Ellworth, it turns out, has had his Rolls-Royce stolen.&lt;ref name="amg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="goldman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldman |first=Robert |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Hegemony and Managed Critique in Prime-Time Television: A Critical Reading of "Mork and Mindy" |journal=Theory &amp; Society |volume=11 |issue= |pages=363–388, Part 4. |publisher=Hosted, [[Lewis &amp; Clark College]] |date=May 1982 |url=http://www.lclark.edu/~goldman/mandm4.htm |doi= |id= |accessdate=2007-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102002323/http://www.lclark.edu/~goldman/mandm4.htm |archivedate=2007-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Staff | first = | coauthors = | title ="Mork &amp; Mindy" Mork Goes Erk (1979) | work =[[Internet Movie Database]] | pages = | language = | publisher =[[Amazon.com]] | date =Original Air Date: 8 February 1979 | url =https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0651213/  | accessdate =  2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tvguide" /&gt;

[[File:David Letterman 2012.jpg|thumb|David Letterman portrays Ellsworth, a parody of [[Werner Erhard]].]]
In a 1982 article in the [[academic journal|journal]] ''Theory &amp; Society'', [[Lewis &amp; Clark College]] [[sociology]] professor Robert Goldman compared and contrasted Letterman's "Ellsworth" character and his training program to that of Werner Erhard's course [[Erhard Seminars Training]].  Goldman noted that the episode spent time: "lampooning Werner Erhard and est-like commercial pop psychologies."  However, Goldman went on to note that the inherent problem with "Ellsworth Revitalization Konditioning" was not the training - but Ellsworth himself.&lt;ref name="goldman" /&gt;

Ellsworth is seen as a parody of [[consumerism]]: "As the self-help entrepreneur, Ellsworth is portrayed as a walking collection of lifestyle-status points and sign-values...Conspicuous consumption and commodity fetishism define his personality."  Goldman explained that the ''Mork and Mindy'' episode succeeded in distinguishing between criticism of the Ellsworth training, and criticism of Ellsworth, citing Ellsworth's character traits of: "tyranny, selfishness, open greed, and flaunting of the accoutrements of his vulgar money-making."&lt;ref name="goldman" /&gt;

== Reception ==
[[TV Guide]]'s 2005 book ''TV Guide: The Ultimate Resource to Television Programs on DVD'' highlighted "Mork Goes Erk" as one of three "Classic Episodes" of the first season, including "Mork's First Christmas", and "Mork's Mixed Emotions".&lt;ref name="tvguide"&gt;{{cite book  | last = [[TV Guide]]  | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = TV Guide: The Ultimate Resource to Television Programs on DVD | publisher = St. Martin's Griffin | year = 2005 | location = | pages =Page 166 | url = | doi = | id =   | isbn = 0-312-35150-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Matthew Tobey of ''[[Allmovie]]'' wrote that the episode was most notable because of [[David Letterman]]'s appearance before he became more well known.&lt;ref name="amg"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tobey |first=Matthew |coauthors= |title=Mork &amp; Mindy: Mork Goes Erk |work=[[Allmovie]] |pages= |language= |publisher=All Media Guide, LLC. |date= |url=http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=1:314015 |accessdate=2007-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426195934/http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg |archivedate=2006-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Donald Liebenson of ''[[Amazon.com]]'' also cited David Letterman's performance as: "an abusive EST-like guru" as one of the more memorable parts of the Season One DVD boxed set, but thought that the highlight of the season was the episode "Mork's Mixed Emotions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Liebenson  | first =Donald | coauthors = | title = Mork &amp; Mindy - The Complete First Season (1978): Amazon.com essential video | work = [[Amazon.com]] | pages =Editorial Reviews | language = | publisher = Amazon.com, Inc. | year = 2004 | url = https://www.amazon.com/Mork-Mindy-Complete-First-Season/dp/B0002I837M| accessdate = 2007-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'' also praised Letterman's performance as a "shady motivational speaker," commenting that the episode was a way for Letterman to hone his "smarminess" before his later work on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Staff

'''Nielsen BookScan''' has been a [[data]] provider for the [[book]] [[publishing]] industry, owned by the [[Nielsen Company]] up to 2016, though it is still in use via the [[NPD Group]]. BookScan compiles [[point of sale]] data for book sales.&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;[[Daniel Gross]]. "[http://www.slate.com/id/2142810/ Why writers never reveal how many books their buddies have sold]." ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', June 2, 2006. Retrieved on January 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PW&gt;Jim Milliot and Steven Zeitchik.

Retrieved on January 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Following the success of [[Nielsen SoundScan]] which tracked [[point of sale]] figures for music, the [[Nielsen Company]] decided to launch a similar service for book sales. Nielsen BookScan was launched in January 2001.&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt; Previously, tracking of book sales, such as by the [[New York Times Best Seller list]], was done without raw numbers. ''The New York Times'' would survey hundreds of outlets to estimate which books were selling the most copies, and would publish rankings but not figures. Only the publisher of a book tracked how many copies had been sold, but rarely shared this data.

==Methodology==
Nielsen BookScan relies on point of sale data from a number of major book sellers. In 2009 Nielsen BookScan's US Consumer Market Panel covered 75% of retail sales.

==Use of BookScan==
BookScan was initially greeted with skepticism, but is now widely used by both the publishing industry and the media.&lt;ref name=PW/&gt; Publishers use the numbers to track the success of their rivals. The media uses the figures as a reference to gauge a title's success. [[Daniel Gross]] of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' has noted the increase of pundits using the figures to disparage each other.&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt;

BookScan also provided previously unavailable metrics on books published by multiple publishers, such as classic novels in the [[public domain]] which may be published by many different houses. Previously, no single entity had figures for the sales of these books; publishers and bookstores only knew their own sales. ''Slate'' noted that [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' was available from Amazon in 130 different editions; prior to BookScan there was no way to tabulate total sales. By summing BookScan data, however, ''Pride and Prejudice'' was reported to command sales of 110,000 a year, nearly 200 years after being published.&lt;ref name=Slate2/&gt;

BookScan records cash register sales of books by tracking ISBNs when a clerk scans the barcode. BookScan only tracks print book sales, thus excluding ebook sales from major e-tailers such as [[Amazon Kindle]], [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] [[Nook]], [[Kobo eReader|Kobo]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and [[Google Play]]. BookScan likewise does not include non-retail sales through channels such as libraries, nor specialty retailers who do not report to the service.&lt;ref&gt;https://electricliterature.com/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-book-sales-but-were-afraid-to-ask-1fe6bc00aa2d#.jssavzqjs&lt;/ref&gt;

BookScan and other services, as Pubtrack Digital, PubTrack Higher Education, PubTrack Christian, Books &amp; Consumers, PubEasy und PubNet belong to [[The NPD Group]] since January, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bookweb.org/news/nielsen-sells-bookscan-other-us-book-industry-services-npd-group-35494|title=Nielsen Sells BookScan, Other U.S. Book Industry Services to NPD Group|date=2017-01-20|work=American Booksellers Association|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; NPD has acquired these services from Nielsen’s '''U.S.''' market information and research services for the book industry. These services will be part of NPD Book, a new U.S. practice area.

Nielsen will offer these services furthermore in 9 countries outside U.S., named "Nielsen Book".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boersenblatt.net/artikel-marktdaten_in_den_usa.1279371.html Börsenblatt für den deutschen Buchhandel], january 20, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pitirim Alexandrovich Sorokin''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|r|oʊ|k|ɪ|n|,_|s|ɔː|-}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sorokin "Sorokin"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ru|Питири́м Алекса́ндрович Соро́кин}}, {{OldStyleDate|2 February|1889|21 January}} – 10 February 1968) was a [[Russian Empire|Russian]]-born American [[sociology|sociologist]] and [[political activist]], best known for his contributions to the [[social cycle theory]]. 

==Background==
Pitirim Alexandrovich Sorokin was born on {{OldStyleDate|2 February|1889|21 January}}, in Turya, a small village in [[Yarensk]] [[uyezd]], [[Vologda Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Knyazhpogostsky District]], [[Komi Republic]], [[Russia]]), the second son to a [[Russians|Russian]] father and [[Komi peoples|Komi]] mother. Sorokin's father, Alexander Prokopievich Sorokin, was from [[Veliky Ustyug]] and a travelling [[craft]]sman specializing in [[gold]] and [[silver]], while his mother, Pelageya Vasilievna, was a native of [[Zheshart]] and belonged to a [[peasant]] family. His elder brother, Vasily, was born in 1885, and his younger brother, Prokopy, was born in 1893. Sorokin's mother died on March 7, 1894, in the village of Kokvitsa, and after her death Sorokin and his elder brother Vasily stayed with their father, travelling with him through the villages in search of work, while Prokopy was taken in by his aunt, Anisya Vasilievna Rimsky, who lived with her husband, Vasily Ivanovich, in the village of Rimia. Sorokin's father began to develop [[alcoholism]], and following instances of physical abuse, he and Vasily left their father to be independent.

In the early [[1900s (decade)|1900s]], supporting himself as an artisan and clerk, Sorokin attended the [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint Petersburg Imperial University]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] where he earned his graduate degree in [[criminology]] and became a professor.&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;Allen Phillip, J. (1963). Pitirim A. Sorokin in Review.  Durham N.C.  Duke University Press&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sorokin was an [[anti-communist]], and during the [[Russian Revolution]] was a member of the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]], supporter of the [[White Movement]], and a secretary to Prime Minister [[Alexander Kerensky]] who was a leader in the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]]. After the [[October Revolution]], Sorokin continued to fight [[communist]] leaders, and was arrested by the new regime several times before he was eventually [[Death sentence|condemned to death]]. After six weeks in prison, Sorokin was released and went back to teaching at the University of St. Petersburg, becoming the founder of the sociology department at the university. In 1922, Sorokin was again arrested and this time exiled by the [[Soviet]] government, emigrating in 1923 to the United States, and became a [[naturalized]] citizen in 1930.&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt;  

Sorokin was a leader among the Democrats leading up to the Russian revolution, and was sought by Lenin's forces after Lenin consolidated his power. After months in hiding, he escaped from the [[Soviet Union]] in 1922 and emigrated to the [[United States]], becoming a [[naturalized]] citizen in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sorokin, Pitirim|title=Дальняя дорога: автобиография|trans-title=Long journey: autobiography|date=1992|publisher=Terra|location=Moscow|page=9|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sorokin was personally requested to accept a position at [[Harvard University]], founding the Department of Sociology and becoming a vocal critic of his colleague, [[Talcott Parsons]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, Vincent. "Sorokin, Pitirim," Encyclopedia of Social Theory. California: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In "Fads and Foibles," Sorokin accuses Parsons of borrowing his work without acknowledgement.&lt;/ref&gt; Sorokin was an ardent opponent of [[communism]], which he regarded as a "pest of man," and was a deputy of the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]].

Sorokin was professor of sociology at the [[University of Minnesota]] from 1924 to 1940, when he accepted an offer of a position by the president of [[Harvard University]], where he continued to work until 1959.  One of his students was writer [[Myra Page]].&lt;ref name=Looper&gt;

==Works==
Before his achievements as a professor in the United States, he published his 1924 ''Leaves of a Russian Diary'', by (E.P. Dutton &amp; Co.), giving a daily, and sometimes hourly account of the Russian Revolution which actually first started in February 1917 where he was in the forefront of creating a provisionary government, only to see it unravel and lose power to the [[Bolsheviks]] in October 1917. In 1950, Sorokin published an addendum to the book called ''The Thirty Years After.'' It is a personal and brutally honest account of the revolution and of his exile.

Sorokin's academic writings are extensive; he wrote 37 books and more than 400 articles.&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt; His controversial theories of social process and the historical typology of cultures are expounded in ''Social and Cultural Dynamics'' (4 vol., 1937–41; rev. and abridged ed. 1957) and many other works. Sorokin was also interested in social stratification, the history of sociological theory, and altruistic behavior.

Sorokin's work addressed three major theories: social differentiation, social stratification and social conflict. The theory of social differentiation describes three types of societal relationships. The first is familistic, which is the type that we would generally strive for. It is the relationship that has the most solidarity, the values of everyone involved are considered, and there is a great deal of interaction.

Social stratification refers to the fact that all societies are hierarchically divided, with upper and lower strata and unequal distribution of wealth, power, and influence across strata. There is always some mobility between these strata. People or groups may move up or down the hierarchy, acquiring or losing their power and influence.

Social conflict refers to Sorokin's theory of war. Whether internal to a nation or international, peace is based on similarity of values among the people of a nation or between different nations. War has a destructive phase, when values are destroyed, and a declining phase, when some of values are restored. Sorokin thought that the number of wars would decrease with increased solidarity and decreased antagonism. If a society's values stressed altruism instead of egoism, the incidence of war would diminish.

In his ''Social and Cultural Dynamics'', his magnum opus, Sorokin classified societies according to their 'cultural mentality', which can be "ideational" (reality is spiritual), "sensate" (reality is material), or "idealistic" (a synthesis of the two). He suggested that major civilizations evolve from an ideational to an idealistic, and eventually to a sensate mentality. Each of these phases of cultural development not only seeks to describe the nature of reality, but also stipulates the nature of human needs and goals to be satisfied, the extent to which they should be satisfied, and the methods of satisfaction. Sorokin has interpreted the contemporary Western civilization as a sensate civilization, dedicated to technological progress and prophesied its fall into [[decadence]] and the emergence of a new ideational or idealistic era. In ''Fads and Foibles'', he criticizes [[Lewis Terman]]'s ''Genetic Studies of Genius'' research, showing that his selected group of children with high [[IQ]]s did about as well as a random group of children selected from similar family backgrounds would have done.&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gladwell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gladwell|first=Malcolm|title=Outliers|year=2008|location=New York|isbn=978-0-316-03669-6|pages=90|url=http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/104760101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal and death==

Sorokin married Dr. [[Helen Baratynskaya]], with whom he had two sons. 

Sorokin died on 10 February 1968, in [[Winchester, Massachusetts]]. A [[Russian Orthodox]] service was held at home for the family, followed by an eclectic service at the [[Memorial Church of Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;Sergei P. Sorokin, "[http://cliffstreet.org/index.php/sergei-sorokin-about-pitirim Life With Pitirim Sorokin: A Younger Son's Perspective]".&lt;/ref&gt;

Sorokin's papers are currently held by the [[University of Saskatchewan]] in [[Saskatoon]], [[Canada]], where they are available to the public. In March 2009 the Sorokin Research Center was established at the facilities of [[Syktyvkar State University]] in [[Syktyvkar]], Republic of Komi, for the purpose of research and publication of archive materials, mainly from the collection at the University of Saskatchewan. The first research project "Selected Correspondence of Pitirim Sorokin: Scientist from Komi on The Service of Humanity" (in Russian) has been drafted and will be in print in the Fall of 2009 in Russia.&lt;ref name="gladwell"/&gt;

The '''political economy of communications''', news, or media, is a particular branch in [[Communication studies]] or [[media studies]] which studies the power relations ([[political economy]]) that constitute the communication of information from the [[mass media]] to its publics.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Media|last=Flew|first=Terry|last2=Smith|first2=Richard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-900550-5|location=Don Mills, ON|pages=1–26, 57–75, 275}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been developed by media and political economy scholars, such as [[Dallas Walker Smythe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Melody, B.|year=1994|title=Dallas Smythe: Pioneer in the political economy of communications|editor=T.

== Influences ==

One of the most early modern works in the political economy of communications are [[Harold Innis]]' works which were compiled in the book ''[[Empire and Communications]]''. This directly inspired [[Marshall McLuhan]], a colleague of Innis at the University of Toronto, who would later be made famous for the dictum "the medium is the message". Subsequent PEC approaches have been heavily influenced by Marxist thought and democratic politics, as it questions powers of and within communications against the realization of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardy|first=Jonathan|date=2014-06-01|title=Critical political economy of communications: A mid-term review|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/mcp/2014/00000010/00000002/art00008|journal=International Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Politics|volume=10|issue=2|pages=189–202|doi=10.1386/macp.10.2.189_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marxian economics|Marxist]] Thought- The [[Ethics|moral philosophy]] of PEC dictates it to often criticize [[capitalism]] for its effect on media and democracy, which originates from the [[Critical theory (Frankfurt School|critical theory]] works of [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuchs|first=Christan|date=2014|title=WikiLeaks and the Critique of the Political Economy|url=|journal=International Journal of Communication|volume=8|issue=1932–8036/2014FEA0002|pages=2718–2732}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common critique of critical political economy (often from the [[cultural studies]] approach) is that, like [[Marxism|Marx]], it [[Fetishism|fetishizes]] [[capitalism]] and is deterministic [[Technological determinism|technologically]] and/or [[Economic determinism|economically]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* [[Democracy|Democratic Politics]]- PEC views media and information as the ultimate democratizer of power, and thus includes social [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] as a criterion. Ultimately, this means that PEC encourages [[media reform]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;and government intervention in the [[Market (economics)|marketplace.]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Main Topics of Study ==

[[File:News Corp logo 2013.svg|thumb|Logo of [[News Corp]], a mass media conglomerate and a subject of concentrated ownership. ]]
* [[Concentration of media ownership|Media ownership]]- Concentration of ownership in media industries as a result of [[Technological convergence|convergence]] and [[Conglomeration|media conglomeration]] under [[neoliberal economics]] have become a concern for media [[Diversity (business)|diversity]] and [[Democracy|democratic discourse]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Support mechanisms- [[Advertising]], [[marketing]], [[Subscription business model|subscription]], [[social media]], and [[crowdfunding]] [[revenue]]s are examples of economic support for media organizations. Such mechanisms influence what types of [[Content (media)|content]] are published or not published, the nature of the [[commodity]] (content vs. [[the audience]] vs. [[advertisers]]) and are thus relevant to PEC studies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
* [[Government policy]]- Policy [[Media regulation|regulates]] media and its economics in terms of ownership, affecting how [[Creative industries|media industries]] operate as well as the role of media in society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Journalism/News Media ==

As [[Journalism|journalism/news media]] is the core to the functioning of democratic society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=10.5406/j.ctt1xcjws|title=Normative Theories of the Media: Journalism in Democratic Societies|last=Christians|first=Clifford G.|last2=Glasser|first2=Theodore L.|last3=McQuail|first3=Denis|last4=Nordenstreng|first4=Kaarle|last5=White|first5=Robert A.|date=2009-01-01|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252034237|doi=10.5406/j.ctt1xcjws|doi-broken-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; PEC works towards the goal of "healthy journalism."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McChesney|first=Robert W.|date=2012-10-01|title=Farewell to Journalism?|journal=Journalism Practice|volume=6|issue=5–6|pages=614–626|doi=10.1080/17512786.2012.683273|issn=1751-2786}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for democracy, the current state of news media around the world and especially that of [[Media of the United States|the United States]], falls short of the general consensus (among media scholars and democratic theory) on what is considered to be healthy [[journalism]]. This is due in part to the overwhelming amount of [[public relations]] material being posed as [[News media|news]].&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

It is in the interest of PEC that journalism instead provide a "rigorous account" of those in power, meet the information needs of all classes and people, be truthful, and act as an early warning system by providing a "wide range of informed opinions on the most important issues of our time."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== New Media ==

[[Mass media|The mass media]] are undoubtedly experiencing considerable changes in platform, technology, and economic structure (e.g., [[crowdfunding]], [[social media]]) as the [[digital era]] continues to shift people toward "[[New media|new" media]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Traditional financial configurations and business models have been destabilized by this transformation. However, new mechanisms of power have emerged from this more open system of information and news creation. The availability of information can now be skewed or influenced through "search, aggregation, and digital distribution infrastructures" (p.&amp;nbsp;493).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Picard|first=Robert G.|date=2014-09-03|title=Twilight or New Dawn of Journalism?|journal=Journalism Studies|volume=15|issue=5|pages=500–510|doi=10.1080/1461670X.2014.895530|issn=1461-670X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent Mosco's definition of political economic studies, where the "production, distribution, and consumption of resources, including communication resources” are essential, thus remains relevant even in times of [[new media]], since a new [[Network economy|(network) economy/society]] forms its ''own'' power relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The rise of the network society|last=Manuel.|first=Castells|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=9780631221401|oclc=254487176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International encyclopedia of communication online|last=1949-|first=Donsbach, Wolfgang|last2=Association.|first2=International Communication|last3=(Firm)|first3=Wiley-Blackwell|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Wiley/Blackwell|isbn=9781405131995|oclc=271856987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=http://users.ipfw.edu/tankel/Syllabi/Spring%202010/COM%20330/BBarrettPoliticaleconomy.pdf|title=Approaches to Media|last=Boyd-Barrett|first=Oliver|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=186–192|chapter=The political economy approach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ankara Muzeum B19-36.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük|Seated goddess of Çatalhöyük]] flanked by two [[Felidae|felines]]]]

'''Potnia Theron''' (Ἡ Πότνια Θηρῶν, "The Mistress of the Animals") is a term first used (once) by [[Homer]] (Iliad 21. 470) and often used to describe female divinities associated with animals.&lt;ref name=fatd&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischer-Hansen|first=Tobias|title=From Artemis to Diana: the goddess of man and beast|year=2009|publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press|isbn=978-8763507882 |author2=Birte Poulsen|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''[[Potnia]]'', meaning mistress or lady, was a [[Mycenaean Greek]] word inherited by [[Ancient Greek|Classical Greek]], with the same meaning, cognate to [[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|patnī}}.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chadwick|first=John|title=The Mycenaean world|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-29037-1|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homer's mention of ''potnia theron'' is thought to refer to [[Artemis]] and [[Walter Burkert]] describes this mention as "a well established formula".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burkert|first=Walter|title=Greek Religion|year=1987|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-36281-9|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Artemis type deity, a 'Mistress of the Animals', is often assumed to have existed in prehistorical religion and often referred to as Potnia Theron, with some scholars positing a relationship between Artemis and goddesses depicted in Minoan art and "''Potnia Theron'' has become a generic term for any female associated with animals."&lt;ref name=fatd /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roller|first=Lynn E.|title=In search of god the mother: the cult of Anatolian Cybele|year=1999|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-21024-0|page=139|quote=indefinite figures such as the Potnia Theron}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many depictions use a female version of the widespread ancient [[motif (visual arts)|motif]] of the male [[Master of Animals]], showing a central figure with a human form grasping two animals, one to each side.  The oldest depiction has been discovered in [[Çatalhöyük]]. 
Another example of ''Potnia theròn'' is situated in Museo civico archeologico di Monte Rinaldo &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retemusealedeisibillini.it/monterinaldo/|title=Monte Rinaldo - Rete Museale dei Sibillini|website=Retemusealedeisibillini.it|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Italy: plate illustrates goddess that wears a [[Peplos|long dress]] and holds hands with two [[Panthera|panthers]].

'''Quelepa''' is an important archaeological site located in eastern [[El Salvador]]. Generally considered to have been settled by the [[Lenca people]], the site was founded around 400 BC, in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Preclassic]] period (500 BC - AD 250).&lt;ref&gt;Sheets 2000, pp.420, 422.&lt;/ref&gt; The inhabitants constructed a platform from plaster and [[pumice]] and rebuilt it a number of times. Artefacts recovered during the excavations of the site indicate that the local population depended upon [[subsistence agriculture]], these artefacts included ''[[metate]]s'' (a kind of [[mortar and pestle|mortar]]) and ''[[comal (cookware)|comales]]'' (a type of [[griddle]]). The site belonged to the [[Mesoamerica]]n cultural region.&lt;ref&gt;Sheets 2000, p.420.&lt;/ref&gt;  Quelepa means "stone jaguar" in the [[Lenca language]], probably in reference to the large Jaguar Altar found at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its occupational history, the inhabitants crafted stone tools from [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]].&lt;ref&gt;Sheets 2000, p.420.&lt;/ref&gt; The site appears to have been linked to trade routes extending to western El Salvador and the [[Guatemalan Highlands]] and also to the north in [[Honduras]].&lt;ref&gt;Sheets 2000, pp.421-422.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although sites in western El Salvador were severely affected by the eruption of the [[Lake Ilopango|Ilopango Volcano]] during the Early Classic, its only effect on Quelepa was the severance of trade routes into Mesoamerica. This cutting off did not result in stagnation at the site, but rather resulted in the florescence of a local culture.&lt;ref&gt;Cobos 1994, 1998, p.62. Sheets 2000, p.442.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
[[File:Volcan de san miguel.jpg|thumb|right|The San Miguel volcano dominates the local topography]]
The Quelepa archaeological site is located {{convert|1|km|mi}} outside the [[Quelepa, San Salvador|small village of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; The ruins are situated along the north bank of the San Esteban River, a tributary of the [[Río Grande de San Miguel]] which flows into the Pacific Ocean. The site is located {{convert|8|km|mi}} west-northwest of the town of [[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, pp.20, 23. Kelly 1996, p.310.&lt;/ref&gt; Quelepa is {{convert|13|mi|km}} north of the neighbouring site of [[Los Llanitos]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.310.&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeological site divided into East and West groups by a small stream called the Quebrada Agua Zarca, which has high, steep banks.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, pp.23, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The ruins have an altitude of between {{convert|160|and|180|m|ft}} [[above mean sea level]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeological remains of Quelepa are on privately owned land under cultivation, the entire East Group together with a part of the west group are on the land of the Hacienda El Obrajuelo farm.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.27.&lt;/ref&gt; The area to the west of the Quebrada Agua Zarca is planted with [[maize]] and [[cotton]], as is the area south of the river.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general area around Quelapa is part of the [[flood plain]] of the Río Grande de San Miguel, lying between the hills to the north and the [[San Miguel (volcano)|San Miguel volcano]] some {{convert|30|km|mi}} from the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt; The volcano is the most prominent local landmark, with its peak at {{convert|2132|m|ft}} above mean sea level. Although the volcano has erupted 6 times since 1699, most recently in 1924, and continues in a low state of activity it has never dropped sufficient [[volcanic ash]] on Quelepa to be detectable archaeologically.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate of Quelepa is classified under the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen system]] as [[Tropical savanna climate|tropical wet and dry]]. The majority of rainfall falls between in months of September and October with a long [[dry season]] from November to May. Monthly rainfall averages between {{Convert|300|and|400|mm|in}} in September and less than {{convert|25|mm|in}} in March. Native [[fauna]] has been practically extinguished by the heavy use of [[pesticide]]s on the local cotton crops.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, pp.28-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrews reported many [[iguana]]s near the watercourses and the occasional snake.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Quelepa was founded around 400 BC, in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Preclassic]] period (500 BC - AD 250).&lt;ref&gt;Sheets 2000, p.420.&lt;/ref&gt; The first inhabitants of the site constructed a platform from plaster and [[pumice]] and rebuilt it a number of times&lt;ref&gt;Sheets 2000, p.420.&lt;/ref&gt; Quelepa is generally considered to have been settled by the [[Lenca people]].&lt;ref&gt;Sheets 2000, p.422.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around AD 200 the [[Ilopango (volcano)|Ilopango volcano]] erupted and devastated western El Salvador, breaking Quelepa's link with Mesoamerica. Between AD 150 and AD 625 Quelepa turned instead to the [[Intermediate Area]] beyond the frontiers of Mesoamerica, with artefacts arriving from the north and the east.&lt;ref&gt;Sheets 2000, p.442.&lt;/ref&gt; The major ceremonial architecture of the East Group was built in the Early Classic.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic]] to [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Postclassic]] periods (from approximately AD 625&amp;ndash;1000), the ceremonial centre of the settlement was abandoned and smaller structures were built around a small plaza. This has been interpreted as a Mesoamerican influence with its origins on the Gulf coast of Mexico, or perhaps from [[Seibal]], a [[Maya civilization|Maya]] city in the [[Petén Basin]] of northern [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;Sheets 2000, p.434.&lt;/ref&gt; The stone facing from this period is cruder than that of earlier times and stairways replaced the earlier use of access ramps.&lt;ref&gt;Sheets 2000, p.434.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]] also dates to this time.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quelepa as a whole was abandoned around AD 1000, at the beginning of the Early Postclassic period.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt; The abandonment of the site has been linked to the arrival of the [[Pipil people]] in the El Salvador region, although there is no evidence that they ever occupied the site.&lt;ref&gt;Cobos 1994, 1998, p.81.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
The first mention of Quelepa in print was a brief description written by Atilio Peccorini and published in 1913. Herbert Spinden mentioned Quelepa in 1915 and Peccorini published another, even less detailed account in 1926. Peccorini reported that the site had many structures faced with stone, a paved "road", artificial terraces and various sculptured monuments, one of which was probably the Jaguar Altar.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1926, Samuel K. Lothrop mentioned that he made a brief visit to the ruins to buy ceramics for the [[Museum of the American Indian]] in [[New York City]], he listed Quelepa in his list of archaeological sites in El Salvador under the alternative name of ''Mayacaquin''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; The site was visited by Antonio Sol, the Director of the Departamento Nacional de Historia, in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first excavation of the site took place in 1949, directed by Pedro Armillas. The investigations focused on Structure 3 in the East Group and were never completed and the results were unpublished, although the fieldnotes he made were forwarded to E. Wyllys Andrews V.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal excavations of the site were carried out under the direction of E. Wyllys Andrews from 1967&amp;ndash;1969, funded by the [[Middle American Research Institute]] of [[Tulane University]] and by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the site is officially listed as a National Archaeological Monument, as recently as 2005 it was effectively unprotected.&lt;ref&gt;''El Diario de Hoy'' 29 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site description==
Quelepa has approximately 40 structures occupying an area of approximately {{convert|0.5|km2|sqmi}}.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.310.&lt;/ref&gt; They are spread out over a distance of {{convert|1|km|mi}} along the bank of the San Esteban River, never at a distance greater the {{convert|500|m|ft}} from the river itself.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; Ceramic remains and isolated mounds extend as far as {{convert|3|km|mi}} from the site core.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; The site is divided into East and West Groups by a small stream.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.310.&lt;/ref&gt; Structure size at the site varies greatly from {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=on}} high [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramids]] to small, badly eroded mounds. These smaller mounds probably served as platform bases for perishable structures.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; The site also possesses a [[Mesoamerican ballcourt]].&lt;ref&gt;Parsons 1991, p.202.&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural land use of the site continues to constantly erode the archaeological remains.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site, unusually for Mesoamerica, features ramps in place of stairways for some structures. Ramps have also been reported from [[Los Naranjos, Honduras|Los Naranjos]] in [[Honduras]] and from [[Bilbao (Mesoamerican site)|Bilbao]] on the Pacific coast of [[Guatemala]], although the latter differed in form and function from those at Quelepa. In all cases, the ramps have been dated to the Classic period.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two groups are fairly distinct in their architectural styles, probably due to being built in different periods. The West Group is probably the later of the two groups and is similar to a miniature [[Maya architecture|Maya-style acropolis]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The area south of the San Esteban River lacks structures but contains a great number of tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

A cache was uncovered at the site that contained a collection of artefacts associated with the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]], including finely sculpted yokes, ''palmas'' and a ''hacha''. They were all placed under a stone slab. These, together with other artefacts such as flutes and wheeled toys indicate a link with the Gulf coast of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Sheets 2000, p.434.&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Group===
The structures of the West Group are located upon artificial terraces that are generally aligned north-south.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; To the south of the group the terrain descends steeply to the river.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; The group consists of a number of mounds, 15 of which are arranged around a rectangular plaza in the southeastern area of the group, most of them upon an artificial terrace.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.310. Andrews 1976, 1986, p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; The northeast of this terrace supports a narrow platform upon which was built a long, low structure.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar structure is on the east side of the plaza.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; The mounds in the West Group date to the Late Classic.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.310.&lt;/ref&gt;

The I-shaped '''Ballcourt''' (denominated '''Structure 19''') is situated {{convert|110|m|ft}} north of the plaza, it has not been excavated. It consists of a mound measuring {{convert|31|m|ft}} long and {{convert|2.25|m|ft}} high that forms one side of the playing area, with the west side formed by the face of a terrace. The ballcourt is oriented north-south. The north and sound end zones are close by low, narrow walls running east-west. In the rain season, runoff water flows through the ballcourt and has buried it under more than {{convert|2|m|ft}} of soil. The original height of the sides of the ballcourt was probably around {{convert|4.5|m|ft}}. Two large stone slabs were laid in the centre of the playing area, upon them was a broken [[sandstone]] disc that measured {{convert|28|by|4.5|cm|in}} and was probably a ballcourt marker.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, pp.26, 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure 23''' is a small platform dating to the Late Classic. It is located near the edge of a high terrace and closes the west side of a small plaza. It is a single-level platform with vertical sides and measures {{convert|8.8|by|6.8|m|ft}} by {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} high. It was accessed by a {{convert|1.9|m|ft|adj=on}} wide stairway that extends {{convert|3|m|ft}} westwards from the platform. The use of a stairway indicates a major change in architectural style, moving away from the earlier use of ramps and involving the use of poorly reworked stone blocks for the facing of the building.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, pp.48-50.&lt;/ref&gt; The platform and the stairway both contained a mix of earth, mud and rock infill. Burnt remains of [[wattle and daub]] were found scattered around the base, together with fragments of mortar and red-painted [[stucco]]. The wattle and daub suggests a perishable superstructure once stood upon the platform but it is not certain if the stucco came from this or from the platform itself.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.50.&lt;/ref&gt; Offering&amp;nbsp;23 was excavated from the structure and contained three ceramic vessels, including a red effigy vessel. This offering was buried at the time the structure was built and was likely to have been a dedicatory offering.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, pp.50-51.&lt;/ref&gt; A rough altar had been built in the angle formed by the southern wall of the stairway and the western wall of the platform itself.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure 28''' is a platform located {{convert|6|m|ft}} to the south of Structure&amp;nbsp;23. It measured {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} high and has been badly eroded. Its architectural style is identical to that of Structure&amp;nbsp;23, suggesting that it also dates from the Late Classic. The platform base was buried under a {{convert|25|cm|in|adj=on}} thick layer of burnt wattle and daub mixed with ceramic fragments, probably the remains of a perishable superstructure that once stood on top of the platform.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.52.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure 29''' is a small mound that was a three-tiered pyramid platform measuring {{convert|17.2|by|14.1|m|ft}} at the base. It is out of alignment with the other structures in the west group. The mound was {{convert|3.5|m|ft}} high when excavated but the structure's original height has been calculated as approximately {{convert|4.1|m|ft}} based on the angle of its stairway. The stone facing was poor quality, consisting of rough, unequal stones placed haphazardly and cemented with mud mortar. This was then roughly covered with a thick, uneven coating of mortar. The lowest tier of the platform was {{convert|0.7|m|ft}} high, the middle tier measured {{convert|1.8|m|ft}} in height and the third tier was approximately {{convert|1.6|m|ft}} high. The stairway climbed the west side of the platform and projected {{convert|1|m|ft}} from the base of the pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, pp.53-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Structure&amp;nbsp;29 was built over an earlier structure that was similar in form.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.58.&lt;/ref&gt; The poor workmanship associated with Structure 29 indicates that it was probably one of the last major structures to be erected at Quelepa. Ceramic evidence indicates that the building was abandoned at the end of the occupational history of the site, around AD 1000 at the beginning of the Early Postclassic period.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Offering 22 was found in front of Structure 29-sub and consisted of 3 ceramic discs piled on top of each other, a large [[obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] knife, a piece of [[hematite|haematite]], a piece of dusty orange clay, and 43 flakes of obsidian.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Offering 24 was found near the southeast corner of Structure 29 and was the most unusual offering found at Quelepa.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.58.&lt;/ref&gt; A stone slab measuring {{convert|39|by|69|cm|in}} was placed on top of three U-shaped [[Mesoamerican ballgame#Clothing and gear|stone yokes]] laid out in an interlaced pattern, together two carved ''palmas'' and a sculpted ''hacha''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt; The larger ''palma'' measured {{convert|49|by|16.5|cm|in}} and was sculpted to represent a seated deity, probably [[Ehecatl]], the god of wind. The smaller ''palma'' measured {{convert|23.5|by|13.5|cm|in}} and represents a [[Feathered Serpent (deity)|feathered serpent]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.225.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''palmas'' have been dated stylistically to the Late Classic and show affinities with ''palmas'' from [[Veracruz]] on the Gulf coast of [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, pp.225-228.&lt;/ref&gt; All these items are associated with the Mesoamerican ballgame.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.228.&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Group===
The East Group consists of structures clustered close to the edges of enormous artificial terraces. These terraces rise successively to the north as they get further from the river until the highest rests against the base of a range of hills.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; The massive terraces in the group provided a level base for the construction of further architecture. The terraces were faced with cut stone slabs laid horizontally.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the structures in the group are aligned north-south, although a few are clustered in arranged groups.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; The two main structures at Quelepa are found in the East Group.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; They were step pyramids, distinguished from those normally built in Mesoamerica by having access ramps instead of stairways.&lt;ref&gt;Sheets 2000, p.420.&lt;/ref&gt; Structure&amp;nbsp;3 is the larger of the two main buildings and Structure&amp;nbsp;4 is the smaller.&lt;ref&gt;Sheets 2000, p.420.&lt;/ref&gt; Both buildings appear to have been abandoned in the mid-7th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.46.&lt;/ref&gt; The two pyramids faced south towards the edge of their supporting terrace, one of the largest terraces at the site, and were accessed via Ramps&amp;nbsp;1 and 2 that climbed the terrace edge and were directly aligned with the access ramps of Structures&amp;nbsp;3 and 4 respectively. Both ramps were paved with massive slabs and rose at an angle of 13°.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, pp.46-47.&lt;/ref&gt; The terrace and the ramps were faced with large volcanic [[tuff]] blocks similar to, but larger than, those used to build the base of Structure&amp;nbsp;3. The terrace facade measured approximately {{convert|4|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, pp.46-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ramp 1''' extended {{convert|9.1|m|ft}} from the edge of the terrace, at the lower (southern) end it measured {{convert|12.1|m|ft}} wide, it narrowed as it rose and measured {{convert|10.9|m|ft}} wide where it met the terrace in front of the access ramp of Structure&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ramp 2''' was {{convert|17.6|m|ft}} long and got wider as it rose. At the lower southern end it measured {{convert|8.1|m|ft}} wide, widening to {{convert|8.9|m|ft}} at the top. Ramp&amp;nbsp;2 is directly aligned with the access ramp of Structure&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt; Three offerings were excavated from the base of Ramp 2. Offerings&amp;nbsp;20 and 21 were close to each other and each consisted of an inverted ceramic vessel placed over another vessel. Offering 18 was {{convert|3|m|ft}} northwest of the base of the ramp and contained two small ceramic bowls, one inverted over the other. All the ceramics from these offering belong to the Shila ceramic complex dated to the Early Classic.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Structure 3====
Structure 3 is the largest structure at Quelepa. It is situated {{convert|11|m|ft}} to the east of the smaller pyramid Structure&amp;nbsp;4, on the third terrace rising northwards from the river. Both the terrace upon which it stands and the structure itself were faced with large, finely cut stone blocks. Structure&amp;nbsp;3 was built somewhat after Structure&amp;nbsp;4, which was already in use during its construction. Considerable effort was made to artificially level the volcanic [[tuff]] surface of the terrace before construction began. The pyramid probably had eight stepped levels, with the lowest measuring {{convert|48|by|32.3|m|ft}} and the highest measuring approximately {{convert|22.3|by|9.1|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, pp.39-41.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not aligned precisely with Structure&amp;nbsp;3, being oriented 5° east of north, a 10° variance from the earlier structure. The lower levels of the pyramid measured between {{convert|1.1|and|1.3|m|ft}} high, the fourth level was higher, measuring {{convert|1.7|m|ft}}. The lower levels had a horizontal depth of between {{convert|1.6|and|1.8|m|ft}}, the upper levels of approximately {{convert|2.5|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, pp.39-41.&lt;/ref&gt; The front (south) face of the pyramid was not straight, the angles of the southern corners were slightly greater than 90° with the facade of the pyramid extending out slightly to meet the access ramp.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, pp.39-41.&lt;/ref&gt; The excavator concluded that this was to create the illusion that the building was larger than its actual size. The pyramidal base originally stood between {{convert|9.7|and|9.8|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, pp.39-41.&lt;/ref&gt; The access ramp was {{convert|6.4|m|ft}} wide and originally faced in stone, as uncovered during the 1949 excavations by Pedro Armillas. However, after the excavations, the owners of the Hacienda La Obrajuelo stripped the stone facing to be reused as construction material in San Miguel. The surviving remains of the ramp project {{convert|8.8|m|ft}} from the front of the pyramid, ending {{convert|8|m|ft}} from the edge of the supporting terrace. The ramp had a total length of approximately {{convert|24|to|25|m|ft}} from base to summit and an initial incline of 18.5° that increased to 28° at the upper levels.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, pp.39-41.&lt;/ref&gt;  The south face of Structure 3, including the access ramp, is badly eroded with the damage having been accelerated by the original excavations at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, pp.39-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Structure&amp;nbsp;3 was built on top of an earlier structure that had been deliberately destroyed to make way for the new building. Structure&amp;nbsp;3-sub is estimated to have been {{convert|5|m|ft}} high. Construction of the final structure is estimated to have begun around AD 500.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, pp.45-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tuff blocks used to dress the lower levels of the structure measure up to {{convert|150|by|70|cm|in}} by {{convert|30|cm|in}} and weigh over a ton, during excavations they were unable to be moved by ten men without mechanical aid. The upper levels of the pyramid used smaller blocks that were able to be carried by a single person. The walls of the pyramid were probably coated in plaster and the upper surfaces were paved.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt; Pieces of burnt [[wattle and daub]] were found scattered all over the surface, sides and base of Structure&amp;nbsp;3, the remains of a perishable structure that once stood on top of the pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt;

At least 3 offerings were buried under the floor of the summit of the pyramid. Offering&amp;nbsp;2 included a large stone disc placed upon a large cylindrical jade bead. Offering&amp;nbsp;3 included ceramics with a large grey-green river pebble placed on top. Offering&amp;nbsp;4 contained only an inverted polychrome bowl. A large offering was buried under the upper part of the ramp and was excavated by Pedro Armillas, the excavated artefacts passed into private ownership and their location are now unknown. The Offering included two large stone discs similar to that uncovered in Offering&amp;nbsp;2. Upon each disc was placed a four-legged ceramic vessel and underneath each disc were three stone balls measuring between {{convert|18|and|20|cm|in}} and placed in a triangle. Also underneath each stone disc was a large tubular jade bead. This offering also contained a ceramic vessel inverted upon another with [[charcoal]] between the two, and a large vessel inverted over a bowl that contained five [[jadeite]] beads and a [[nephrite]] ''hacha'', together with traces of a red pigment, probably [[cinnabar]]. A further bowl contained a small piece of charcoal.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, pp.42-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Structure 4====
Structure 4 is the smaller of the two pyramids, it is also the earlier of the two buildings. It dates to the Early Classic period. The pyramid base is on the edge of the third terrace rising from the river and is near the centre of the East Group. The structure measures {{convert|34.5|by|18.8|m|ft}} and was aligned just under 5° west of north. The pyramid probably only had two levels, the upper level being set back a little rather than centred and measuring {{convert|27.2|by|15.3|m|ft}}. The lower level measured {{convert|2.6|m|ft}} high and the upper is estimated to have measured {{convert|3.2|m|ft}} high originally but was somewhat reduced. The total height of the pyramidal platform was about {{convert|5.8|m|ft}}. Access to the top of the pyramid was via a south-facing ramp that measured {{convert|11.9|m|ft}} long with the lower end extending {{convert|6.3|m|ft}} south of the pyramid base. The ramp was {{convert|5.4|m|ft}} wide and rose at an estimated angle of 27°. Excavations revealed that the ramp was built of compacted clay and that the pyramid was packed with unworked stones. Both were built simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, pp.33-36, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Structure&amp;nbsp;4 was faced with rough volcanic tuff blocks that varied considerably in size, cemented with mud. The blocks were covered in a coating of mortar that varied between {{convert|5|and|7|cm|in}} thick and that may originally have been painted although no evidence was found to prove this.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the base of the pyramid were found large amounts of burnt wattle and daub that can only have originated with the burning of a perishable superstructure on top of the pyramidal platform. The structure contained seven caches, among the offerings were Early Classic ceramic vessels, [[jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]] beads and an [[onyx]] bowl.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other structures and monuments====
At the western edge of the East Group is a large rectangular platform supporting architectural remains. The platform was once almost entirely enclosed by walls, leading to its description as a fortress, although the walls are now badly eroded.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, pp.23, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Structure 9''' is located at the southern edge of the platform.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jaguar Altar''' is a huge [[monolith]]ic monument that measures {{convert|314|by|297|cm|in}} by {{convert|85|cm|in}} high and dates to the Late Preclassic, it has a face sculpted on one side in the style of [[Cara Sucia (Mesoamerican site)|Cara Sucia]] and that has affinities with the sculptural styles of [[Kaminaljuyu]] in [[Guatemala]] and [[Izapa]] in southern [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Sheets 2000, p.421. Andrews 1976, 1986, p.233.&lt;/ref&gt; The upper face of the altar has a {{convert|39|cm|in|adj=on}} deep square hollow that measures {{convert|140|by|160|cm|in}}.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.233.&lt;/ref&gt; All four sides of the altar bear [[relief]] sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.234.&lt;/ref&gt; The altar was removed from the site after Quelepa was excavated by E.&amp;nbsp;Wyllys Andrews and is now in the [[Museo Nacional de Antropología Dr. David J. Guzmán]] in [[San Salvador]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.311. Andrews 1976, 1986, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt; It was found {{convert|235|m|ft}} north-northwest of Structure&amp;nbsp;29 and {{convert|102|m|ft}} northeast of the ballcourt. It had been placed near the edge of a {{convert|4|to|5|m|ft|adj=on}} high terrace.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt; When excavated the area around and under it had already been explored by looters. It is not known if the altar was found in its original location or if it had been moved there, one corner of the altar had been broken off and archaeologists were unable to locate the missing fragment, suggesting that it had been broken while being moved.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.48.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Altar 2''' was found upon Structure&amp;nbsp;9 in this group.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; It measures {{convert|84|by|70|cm|in}} by {{convert|46|cm|in}} high and was removed to the Museo Nacional de Antropología. The altar is roughly circular with a square hollow carved out of the upper face.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.235.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Altar 3'''  is a fragment that was found in 1970 a few metres east of Structure 36 in the West Group.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1976, 1986, p.235.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''September''' is the ninth month of the year in the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar]]s, the third of four months to have a length of 30 days, and the fourth of five months to have a length of less than 31 days. In the [[Northern Hemisphere]] September is the seasonal equivalent of [[March]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].

In the Northern hemisphere, the beginning of the meteorological [[autumn]] is on 1 September. In the Southern hemisphere, the beginning of the meteorological [[Spring (season)|spring]] is on 1 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090225040732/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climatechange/guide/effects/seasons.html|title=Met Office: Changing seasons|first=Met|last=Office|website=webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;　

September marks the beginning of the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|ecclesiastical year]] in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. It is the start of the [[academic term|academic year]] in many countries, in which children go back to school after the [[Summer vacation|summer break]], sometimes on [[September 1|the first day of the month]].

[[September (Roman month)|September]] (from Latin ''septem'', "seven") was originally the seventh of ten months on the oldest known [[Roman calendar]], with March (Latin ''[[Martius (month)|Martius]]'') the first month of the year until perhaps as late as 153 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[H.H. Scullard]], ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'' (Cornell University Press, 1981), p.&amp;nbsp;84; Gary Forsythe, ''Time in Roman Religion: One Thousand Years of Religious History'' (Routledge, 2012), p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt; After the calendar reform that added [[Ianuarius|January]] and [[Februarius|February]] to the beginning of the year, September became the ninth month, but retained its name. It had 29 days until the Julian reform, which added a day.

[[Ancient Roman]] observances for September include [[Ludi Romani]], originally celebrated from September 12 to September 14, later extended to September 5 to September 19. In the 1st century BC, an extra day was added in honor of the deified Julius Caesar on 4 September. [[Epulum Jovis]] was held on September 13. [[Ludi Triumphales]] was held from September 18–22. The [[Septimontium]] was celebrated in September, and on December 11 on later calendars. These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar. In 1752, the [[British Empire]] adopted the [[Gregorian calendar]]. In the British Empire that year, [[September 2]] was immediately followed by [[September 14]].

September was called "harvest month" in [[Charlemagne]]'s calendar.&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=September}}&lt;/ref&gt; September corresponds partly to the [[Fructidor]] and partly to the [[Vendémiaire]] of the [[First French Republic|first French republic]].&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;
On [[Usenet]], it is said that September 1993 ([[Eternal September]]) never ended. September is called ''Herbstmonat'', harvest month, in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; The [[Anglo-Saxon]]s called the month ''Gerstmonath'', barley month, that crop being then usually harvested.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

==September in Astronomy and Astrology==
[[Meteor showers]] that occur in September include the [[Aurigids]], the [[Delta Aurigids]] which occur from mid-September to early October, the [[Taurids#Appearance|Southern Taurids]], which occur from September 10 to November 20, and the [[Andromedids]] which occur from September 25 – December 25.

The [[September equinox]] takes place in this month, and certain observances are organized around it. It is the [[Autumn]] equinox in the Northern Hemisphere, and the [[Vernal Equinox]] in the Southern Hemisphere. The dates can vary from 21 September to 24 September (in [[UTC]]).

September is mostly in the sixth month of the astrological calendar (and the first part of the seventh), which begins at the end of March/Mars/Aries.

==September symbols==
* September's [[birthstone]] is the [[sapphire]].
* The birth flowers for September are the [[forget-me-not]], [[morning glory]] and [[aster (genus)|aster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= SHG Resources |url= http://www.shgresources.com/gems/birthflowers |title= SHGresources.com |publisher=SHGresources.com |accessdate= 2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flowerstower.com/singleflower.php?name=Forget-me-not |title=Flowerstower.com |accessdate=2013-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224103640/http://www.flowerstower.com/singleflower.php?name=Forget-me-not |archivedate=February 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[zodiac]] signs for the month of September are [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]] and [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]] whose end and start are related to equinox date (usually 22 or 23 September).

{{Campaignbox Terrorism in Egypt}}
Targets of '''terrorism in Egypt''' have included government officials, police, [[Tourism in Egypt|tourists]] and the [[Copts|Christian minority]]. Many attacks have been linked to  [[Islamic extremism]], and terrorism increased in the 1990s when the [[Islamist]] movement [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]] targeted high-level political leaders and killed hundreds in its pursuit of implementing traditional [[Sharia|Sharia law]] in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Murphy.p.4"&gt;Murphy, Caryle ''Passion for Islam : Shaping the Modern Middle East: the Egyptian Experience'', Scribner, 2002, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ayman Al-Zawahiri]], an Egyptian doctor and leader of [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] group, is believed to be behind the operations of [[al Qaeda]]. Four out of 30 people on the United States [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] "most wanted" terrorist list are Egyptian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wanted_terrorists/@@wanted-group-listing |title=FBI — Most Wanted Terrorists |publisher=Fbi.gov |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Muslim Brotherhood==
In 1943 the Islamist group [[History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt|Muslim Brotherhood]] is thought to have established "a `secret apparatus`" i.e. "a separate organization for paramilitary activity under the direct authority" the Brethren's head, Sheikh [[Hassan al-Banna]]."&lt;ref name="Chamiehpg140"/&gt;  The Brotherhood were a very large and active organization at that time. In 1948 the group is thought to have assassinated appellate judge Ahmad Khazendar in retaliation for his passing a "severe sentence" against another member of the Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ghada Hashem Talhami|title=Palestine in the Egyptian Press: From Al-Ahram to Al-Ahali|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DlS_To9AspwC&amp;pg=PA87|year=2007|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-1784-2|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1948 victory of the Jewish state of Israel over Muslim Arab armies the group is believed to have set fire to homes of Jews in Cairo in June 1948 in retaliation. In July two large department stores in Cairo owned by Jews were also burned.&lt;ref name="Chamiehpg140"&gt;Chamieh, Jebran, ''Traditionalists, Militants and Liberal in Present Islam'', Research and Publishing House, [1994?], p.140&lt;/ref&gt;  A couple of months later police captured  documents and plans of the `secret apparatus. 32 of its leaders were arrested and its offices were raided.&lt;ref name="Chamiehpg140"/&gt; and shortly thereafter Prime Minister Mahmud Fami Naqrashi ordered the dissolution of the Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;Ruthven, Malise, ''Islam in the World'', Penguin Books, 1984, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 December 1948, Prime Minister [[Mahmoud an-Nukrashi Pasha]] was shot and assassinated by Abdel Meguid Ahmed Hassan, a veterinary student and member of the Brotherhood. The country was shocked and traditionalist clergy condemned the act. [[Dar al-Ifta al-Misriyyah|The Grand Mufti]], Imam of [[Al-Azhar University|Azhar mosque]] and the Council of [[Ulema]] all condemned the perpetrators as [[kuffar]].&lt;ref name="Chamiehpg140"/&gt;

Less than two months later the head of the Brethren ([[Hasan al-Banna]]) was himself victim of an assassination, the perpetrators thought to be supporters of the murdered premier.&lt;ref name="Chamiehpg140"/&gt;

After a nationalist military coup led by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] overthrew the Egyptian monarchy, the Brotherhood were very disappointed to find the officers were secular in orientation and the Brotherhood did not gain influence. On 26 October 1954 a member of the brotherhood attempted to assassinate President Nasser&lt;ref&gt;Chamieh, Jebran, ''Traditionalists, Militants and Liberal in Present Islam'', Research and Publishing House, [1994?], p.141&lt;/ref&gt; and a general suppression of the Brotherhood followed, including imprisonment of thousands of members and the execution of six of its most prominent leaders.&lt;ref name="Ruthven, Malise 1984, p.314"&gt;Ruthven, Malise, ''Islam in the World'', Penguin Books, 1984, p.314&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lavon affair==
A [[covert operation]] under the direction of [[Military Intelligence Directorate (Israel)|Israeli military intelligence]] with the intent to destabilize the Nasser government in the summer of 1954 through terrorist bombings of Egyptian, [[United States|American]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] government facilities was unsuccessful and the Israeli trained Egyptian Jewish operatives who planted the bombs were all captured, although all of their Israeli handlers escaped. The [[Lavon Affair]], so named because [[Israel]]i Defense Minister [[Pinhas Lavon]] was later implicated and forced to resign, was a [[false flag]] operation with evidence planted at the bomb sites implicating the [[Muslim Brotherhood]].&lt;ref name=Teveth&gt;[[Shabtai Teveth|S. Teveth]], ''Ben-Gurion's spy: the story of the political scandal that shaped modern Israel''. Columbia University Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-231-10464-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of Sayyid Qutb==
In the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, terrorist attacks in Egypt became more numerous and severe, and began to target Christian [[Copt]]s and foreign tourists as well as government officials.&lt;ref name="Murphy.p.4"/&gt; This trend surprised some foreigners who thought of Egypt as a country that "embraced" foreigners "with suffocating affection" and preferred a "tolerant brand of Islam".&lt;ref name="Murphy.p.4"/&gt; Some scholars and authors have credited Islamist writer [[Sayyid Qutb]]&lt;ref name="Murphy.p.57"&gt;Murphy, Caryle ''Passion for Islam : Shaping the Modern Middle East: the Egyptian Experience'', Scribner, 2002, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kepel, Gilles, ''Muslim Extremism in Egypt'' by Gilles Kepel, English translation published by University of California Press, 1986, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; as the inspiration for the new wave of attacks.

Qutb, who had been executed in 1967 after another purported plot to assassinate of Abdel Nasser, was author of ''[[Ma'alim fi al-Tariq]]'' (Milestones), a manifesto for armed [[jihad]] in the advance of [[Islam]] to bring about "the kingdom of God on earth" and to eliminate "the kingdom of man",&lt;ref name="Murphy.p.57"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/07spring/eikmeier.htm Qutbism: An Ideology of Islamic-Fascism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609120804/http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/parameters/07spring/eikmeier.htm |date=9 June 2007 }} by Dale C. Eikmeier. From ''[[Parameters (journal)|Parameters]]'', Spring 2007, pp. 85-98.&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes referred to as [[Qutbism]].  His book has been called "one of the most influential works in Arabic of the last half century".&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Sacred Terror'' by Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon, New York: Random House, c2002, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; It became a best seller, went through many editions and strongly influenced Islamists in prison in Egypt.

==Military Technical College attack==
On 18 April 1974, 100 members of the Islamic Liberation Organization (or Shabab Muhammad Group) stormed the armory of the [[Military Technical College]] in Cairo, seizing weapons and vehicles. Led by Salih Sirriya&lt;ref&gt;Kepel, Gilles, ''Muslim Extremism in Egypt'' by Gilles Kepel, English translation published by University of California Press, 1986, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; they hoped to kill President [[Anwar El Sadat]] and other top Egyptian officials — who were attending an official event nearby in the Arab Socialist Building — seize radio and television buildings (also nearby) and announce the birth of an Islamic State under the leadership of [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]].&lt;ref name="Musallam-2005-183"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Musallam|first1=Adnan|title=From Secularism to Jihad: Sayyid Qutb and the Foundations of Radical Islamism|date=2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|pages=183–4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2RnvxghpHRwC&amp;pg=PA183|isbn=978-0-275-98591-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 11 were killed and 27 wounded in the attempt as security forces were able to intercept conspirators before they left the academy. 95 ILO members are arrested and tried. 32 were convicted. Two were executed.&lt;ref&gt;Sageman, Marc, ''Understanding Terror Networks'' by Marc Sageman, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Takfir wal-Hijra==
On 3 July 1977, a group known to the public as ''[[Takfir wal-Hijra]]'' (excommunication and exile), kidnapped former Egyptian government minister Muhammad al-Dhahabi. The group was led by a self-taught Islamic preacher [[Shukri Mustafa]], and called themselves ''[[Jama'at al-Muslimin]]''. Among their demands in exchange for al-Dhahabi's release were the release of 60 of Takfir wal-Hijra members from jail, public apologies from the press for negative stories about the group, the publication of a book by Mustafa, and 200,000 Egyptian pounds in cash.&lt;ref name="Sageman.p.29"&gt;Sageman, Marc, ''Understanding Terror Networks'' by Marc Sageman, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of complying, the press publicized "a long list of offenses and crimes attributed to the group."&lt;ref&gt;Kepel, Gilles, ''Muslim Extremism in Egypt'' by Gilles Kepel, English translation published by University of California Press, 1986, p. 70, 96&lt;/ref&gt; Four days after the kidnapping, al-Dhahabi's body was found.&lt;ref name="Sageman.p.29"/&gt; The murder provoked indignation among the Egyptian public&lt;ref&gt;Kepel, Gilles, ''Muslim Extremism in Egypt'' by Gilles Kepel, English translation published by University of California Press, 1986, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; and extensive police raids led to the arrests of 410 of the group's members.&lt;ref name="Ruthven, Malise 1984, p.314"/&gt;

==Salvation from Hell==
[[Salvation from Hell]] sought to establish an [[Islamic state]] using force.&lt;ref name=nyt3sept&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/03/world/muslim-fundamentalists-sentenced-in-egypt.html|title=Muslim Fundamentalists Sentenced in Egypt|agency=Associated Press|date=3 September 1989|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian government broke off ties with [[Iran]] following allegations that Iran funded the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kifner|title=Egypt Breaks All Diplomatic Ties With Iran|work=The New York Times|page=7|date=15 May 1987|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/15/world/egypt-breaks-all-diplomatic-ties-with-iran.html|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yasser Al Borhamy]] was detained for a month in 1987 due to his alleged connection with the assassination attempt against interior minister [[Hassan Abu Basha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yasser Borhami|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/33/102/26714/Elections-/Whos-who/Yasser-Borhami.aspx|accessdate=30 April 2014|work=Ahram Online|date=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was also responsible for an assassination attempt on former interior minister [[Nabawi Ismail]].&lt;ref name=nyt3sept/&gt;

==Tanzim al-Jihad movement==

===Targeting Christians===
In spring of 1981, Sheikh [[Omar Abdel-Rahman]] agreed to become the mufti of the shura (council) of underground Egyptian group Tanzim al-Jihad, the forerunner of [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] and [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]]. He issued a fatwa sanctioning "the robbery and killing of [[Copt]]s in furtherance of the jihad".&lt;ref&gt;Sageman, Marc, ''Understanding Terror Networks'', Marc Sageman, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sadat assassination and uprising===
By 1981 President [[Anwar Sadat]] had become unpopular among Egyptians and enraged Islamists by signing a [[Egyptian–Israeli Peace Treaty|peace treaty with Israel]]. On 6 October 1981, [[Assassination of Anwar El Sadat|Sadat and six diplomats were assassinated]] while observing a military parade commemorating the eighth anniversary of the October 1973 War. Lieutenant Colonel [[Khalid Islambouli]] and two other members of the Tanzim al-Jihad movement fired machine guns and threw grenades into the reviewing stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/echo/egypt1981.htm |title=Armed Conflict Year Index |publisher=Onwar.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction with the assassination of Sadat, Tanzim al-Jihad began an insurrection in [[Asyut]] in [[Upper Egypt]]. Rebels took control of the city for a few days on 8 October 1981 before paratroopers from Cairo restored government control. 68 policemen and soldiers were killed in the fighting, but sentences of arrested militants were relatively light, with most of them serving only three years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Sageman, Marc, ''Understanding Terror Networks'' by Marc Sageman, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004, pp. 33,4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attacks on Israelis==
The [[Ras Burqa massacre]] was a shooting attack in October 1985 on Israeli vacationers in [[Ras Burqa]], a beach resort area in the Sinai peninsula, in which seven Israelis were killed, including four children. Egypt refused to allow the victims to be treated by Israeli doctors or transferred to hospitals in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William B. Quandt|title=The Middle East: Ten Years After Camp David|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pYzO8zmNEmcC&amp;pg=PA99|year=2010|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=978-0-8157-2052-2|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 February 1990, a bus carrying Israeli tourists in Egypt was attacked. Nine Israelis were killed and 16 wounded. This was the fourth attack on Israeli tourists in Egypt since the signing of the peace treaty.  The attack, claimed by members of the [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]], left 11 people, including nine Israelis, dead and 17 others injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/threat/terror_90/mideast.html |title=1990 Global Terrorism: Middle East Overview |publisher=Fas.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1990 an Egyptian border guard crossed the border into Israel and opened fire with his AK-47 on vehicles on the Eilat-Kadesh Barnea road killing four people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-11-26/news/9004070964_1_israeli-tour-bus-islamic-jihad-gunman |title=Egyptian Sniper Kills 4 In Israel - tribunedigital-chicagotribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=1990-11-26 |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twelve of the people killed in the [[2004 Sinai bombings]] were Israeli.

The [[Sinai bus crash]] in August 2006, in which 11 [[Arab Israeli]]s were killed, may have been  premeditated. Families of the victims  allege that evidence collected, including the driver's derogatory and threatening remarks attacking them for being Arabs and Israeli, indicate they were targeted by a cell.

==Attacks during the 1990s==
[[File:Terrorism deaths in Egypt.svg|thumb|Terrorism deaths in Egypt]]
The violent Islamic insurgency during the 1990s targeted police and government officials but also civilians including tourists.  [[Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]] was the primary perpetrator of the attacks, but [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] also was involved.

===Rifaat el-Mahgoub assassination===
In October 1990, [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] attempted to assassinate Egyptian Interior Minister [[Abdul Halim Moussa|Abdel Halim Moussa]], but ended up killing parliamentary Speaker [[Rifaat el-Mahgoub]].&lt;ref&gt;Sageman, Marc, ''Understanding Terror Networks'' by Marc Sageman, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Daylight ambushes===
1993 was a particularly severe year for terrorist attacks in Egypt. 1106 persons were killed or wounded. More police (120) than terrorists (111) were killed that year and "several senior police officials and their bodyguards were shot dead in daylight ambushes."&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Caryle ''Passion for Islam : Shaping the Modern Middle East: the Egyptian Experience'', Scribner, 2002, pp. 82-3&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cairo attacks ===
On 18 April 1996, gunmen opened fire on Greek and Australian tourists who were about to board a bus outside Cairo's Europa Hotel, near the pyramids. Eighteen Greeks died, and 15 Greeks and an Egyptian were wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = 1996: Greek tourists killed by Egyptian gunmen|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/18/newsid_2525000/2525335.stm|newspaper = BBC|date = 1996-04-18|access-date = 2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 September 1997, gunmen attacked tourist buses parked outside the Egyptian Museum in Tahrir Square, killing nine tourists, including seven Germans, and wounding 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CNN - Terrorists kill 9 tourists in Cairo attack - Sept. 18, 1997|url = http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9709/18/egypt.attack.730/|website = www.cnn.com|access-date = 2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Luxor massacre===
{{main article|Luxor massacre}}
[[File:Hatschepsuttempel.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Djeser-Djeseru]]The Luxor Massacre took place on 17 November 1997, at [[Deir el-Bahri]], an archaeological site and tourist destination located across the [[River Nile]] from [[Luxor]], Egypt. In the mid-morning attack, [[Islamic terrorists]] from [[Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]] ("The Islamic Group") and Talaa'al al-Fateh ([[Vanguards of Conquest]]), both of which are suspected of having ties to [[al-Qaeda]] massacred 62 tourists at the attraction. The six assailants, armed with automatic firearms and knives, were disguised as members of the security forces. They descended on the [[Temple of Hatshepsut]] at around 08:45 and massacred 62 people, their [[modus operandi]] including [[beheadings]] and [[disembowelment|disembowellings]]. The attackers then hijacked a bus, but armed Egyptian tourist police and military forces arrived soon afterwards and engaged in a gun battle with the six terrorists, who were later killed or committed suicide.

==Attacks during the  2000s==

===2004 Sinai bombing===
{{main|2004 Sinai bombings}}
The [[2004 Sinai bombings]] were three bomb attacks targeting [[tourist]] [[hotel]]s in the [[Sinai Peninsula]], [[Egypt]], on 7 October 2004. The attacks killed 34 people and injured 171. The explosions occurred in the [[Hilton Taba]] in [[Taba (Egypt)|Taba]] and campsites used by [[Israel]]is in [[Ras al-Shitan]]. In the Taba attack, a truck drove into the lobby of the Taba Hilton and exploded, killing 31 people and wounding some 159 others. Ten floors of the hotel collapsed following the blast. Some {{convert|50|km|mi|sp=us}} south, at campsites at Ras al-Shitan, near [[Nuweiba]], two more bombings happened. A car parked in front of a restaurant at the Moon Island resort exploded, killing three Israelis and a [[Bedouin]]. Twelve were wounded. Another blast happened moments later, targeting the Baddiyah camp, but did not harm anyone because the bomber had apparently been scared off from entering the campground by a guard.

Of the dead, many were foreigners: 12 were from [[Israel]], two from [[Italy]], one from [[Russia]], and one was an Israeli-[[United States|American]]. The rest of the dead were believed to be Egyptian. According to the Egyptian government, the bombers were [[Palestinians]] who had tried to enter Israel to carry out attacks there but were unsuccessful. The mastermind, Iyad Saleh, recruited Egyptians and Bedouins to gain explosives to be used in the attacks.

===April 2005 attacks===
{{main|April 2005 Cairo terrorist attacks}}
The [[April 2005 Cairo terrorist attacks|April 2005 attacks in Cairo]] were three related incidents that took place in Cairo on 7 April and 30 April 2005. Two incidents caused no loss of life other than those of the perpetrators and appear not to have been planned in advance; in the first attack, however, three bystanders were killed. Two groups claimed responsibility - the [[Mujahedeen of Egypt]] and  the [[Abdullah Azzam Brigades]]. In its statement, the latter group said the attacks were in retaliation for the government's clampdown on dissidents in the wake of the [[2004 Sinai bombings|Sinai Peninsula bombings]]. In the early hours of 1 May, security forces arrested some 225 individuals for questioning, mostly from the dead three's home villages and from the area where they lived in [[Shubra]]. Particularly keenly sought was Muhammad Yassin, the teenage brother of Ehab Yousri Yassin, whom the police described as the only remaining suspect in the bazaar bomb attack and a material witness to the shooting. Over the course of the weekend, it also emerged that all the attackers were relatives of  Ashraf Said, a suspect in the 7 April bombing who was taken in for questioning and died in police custody on 29 April.

===2005 Sharm el-Sheikh attacks===
{{main article|2005 Sharm el-Sheikh attacks}}
[[File:Sharm el Sheikh map.png|right|300px|thumb|Sharm el-Sheikh is located on the coast of the [[Red Sea]], at the southern tip of the [[Sinai Peninsula]].]]The 2005 Sharm el-Sheikh attacks were a series of bomb attacks on 23 July 2005, targeting the [[Egypt]]ian resort city of [[Sharm el-Sheikh]], located on the southern tip of the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. 88 people were killed and over 150 were wounded by the blasts. The bombing coincided with Egypt's [[Egypt#History|Revolution Day]], which commemorates [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]]'s 1952 overthrow of [[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouk]].

The attacks took place in the early morning hours, at a time when many tourists and locals were still out at restaurants, cafés and bars. The first bomb blast, at 01:15 local time (22:15 [[UTC]]), was reported in a market in downtown Sharm; shortly after, another was reported to have hit the [[Ghazala Gardens hotel]] in the Naama Bay area, a strip of beachfront hotels some 6&amp;nbsp;km from the town centre.

While the official government toll a few days after the blast was 64, hospitals reported that 88 people had been killed in the bombings. The majority of dead and wounded casualties were [[Egypt]]ians. Among those killed were 11 [[United Kingdom|Britons]], two [[Germany|Germans]], one [[Czech Republic|Czech]], six [[Italy|Italians]], one [[Israel]]i, and one [[United States|American]]. Other casualties, dead and wounded, included foreign visitors from [[France]], [[Kuwait]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Qatar]], [[Russia]], and [[Spain]].

A group calling itself the ''Abdullah Azzam Brigades'' (a reference to  militant Islamist ideologue [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam]]) was the first to claim responsibility for the attacks. On a website the group stated that "holy warriors targeted the Ghazala Gardens hotel and the Old Market in Sharm el-Sheikh" and claimed it has ties to [[Al-Qaeda]]. Additional claims were later made by two other groups calling themselves the "[[Tawhid and Jihad in West Africa|Tawhid and Jihad]] Group in Egypt" and "Holy Warriors of Egypt".

===2006 Dahab bombings===
{{main article|2006 Dahab bombings}}
[[File:Dahab-location.png|thumb|The seaside town of Dahab is located on the Gulf of Aqaba]]The Dahab bombings of 24 April 2006 were three bomb attacks on the [[Egypt]]ian resort city of [[Dahab]]. The resorts are popular with Western tourists and Egyptians alike during the holiday season.

At about 19:15 [[Egypt Standard Time|local time]] on 24 April 2006 &amp;mdash; a public holiday in celebration of [[Sham Al-Nasseim]] (Spring festival or [[Easter]]) &amp;mdash; a series of bombs exploded in tourist areas of Dahab, a resort located on the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] coast of the [[Sinai Peninsula]].  One blast occurred in or near the Nelson restaurant, one near the Aladdin café (both being on both sides of the bridge), and one near the Ghazala market. At least 23 people were killed, mostly Egyptians, but including a German, Lebanese, Russian, Swiss, and a Hungarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/04/26/egypt.blasts/index.html |accessdate=23 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214001541/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/04/26/egypt.blasts/index.html | title=Egypt ties Dahab blasts to other attacks | publisher=CNN | date=26 April 2006 |archivedate=14 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 80 people were wounded, including tourists from [[Australia]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Israel]], [[South Korea]], [[Lebanon]], the [[Palestinian Territories]], [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=270005&amp;area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__africa/|title=Dahab blasts pinned on suicide bombers : Mail &amp; Guardian Online|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=23 January 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213235215/http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=270005&amp;area=%2Fbreaking_news%2Fbreaking_news__africa%2F|archivedate=13 December 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The governor of [[Janub Sina'|South Sinai]] reported that the blasts might have been suicide attacks, but later [[Habib Adly]], the interior minister of Egypt said that the devices were [[nail bomb]]s set off by timers, and Egyptian TV also reported that the bombs were detonated remotely. Later investigations revealed the blasts were suicide attacks, set off by [[Bedouin]]s, as in earlier attacks in the Sinai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3244022,00.html |title=Dahab bombers were Sinai Bedouins - Israel News, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=1995-06-20 |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These explosions followed other bombings elsewhere in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] in previous  years: in [[Sharm el-Sheikh]] on 23 July 2005 and in [[Taba (Egypt)|Taba]] on 6 October 2004.

Egyptian security officials have stated that the attacks were the work of an [[Islamic extremist terrorism|Islamic terror organisation]] called '''Jama'at al-[[Tawhid|Tawhīd]] wal-Jihad''' (Monotheism and Jihad).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Al |first=Asharq |url=http://aawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=1&amp;id=4749 |title=Re-directed Link - ASHARQ AL-AWSAT |publisher=Aawsat.com |date=2015-02-25 |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 Sudan kidnapping===
In September 2008, a group of eleven European tourists and eight Egyptians were kidnapped during an adventure safari to one of the remotest sites in Egypt deep in the Sahara desert and taken to Sudan. They were subsequently released unharmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=19 kidnapped Western and Egyptian nationals released unharmed|url=http://www.direct-travel.co.uk/egypt/travel-alert/19-kidnapped-western-and-egyptian-nationals-released-unharmed.aspx|publisher=Direct Tracel|accessdate=20 January 2013|date=29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, the [[2009 Khan el-Khalili bombing|Khan el-Khalili bombing]] killed a French schoolgirl on a class trip in Cairo.  It is often discussed as the first of the [[February 2009 Cairo terrorist attacks]].

===2009 Hezbollah plot===

==Attacks since 2010==

===al-Qidiseen church bombing===
{{main article|2011 Alexandria bombing}}
A car bomb explosion outside a church in the north Egyptian city of Alexandria killed at least 23 people and injured 43 following the evening service held at the church causing clashes between Coptic church members at the scene and the surrounding policemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Yolande Knell|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12101748|title=Egypt bomb kills 21 at Alexandria Coptic church |publisher=BBC|date=1 January 2011|accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack saw governments around the world warn international travellers of the dangers of visiting the country, highlighting a likelihood of further terrorist attacks and possibility of kidnappings in Sinai.

On 23 January 2011, the Egyptian minister of interior Habib El Adli stated that Ahmed Lotfi Ibrahim Mohammed confessed to monitoring Christian and Jewish places of worship and sending pictures of the Qideseen church in Alexandria to the Army of Islam. He had confessed visited Gaza several times and was involved in planning the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Awad|first=Marwa |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE70M0IW20110123|title=Egypt blames Gaza militants for church bomb|publisher=Reuters|date=23 January 2011|accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; British intelligence revealed that Muhammad Abd al-Hadi, leader of [[Jundallah (Iran)|Jundullah]], recruited Abdul Rahman Ahmed Ali who was told to park the car, which would be exploded by remote control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philipbrennan.net/2011/02/07/the-british-intelligence-the-egyptian-interior-exploded-the-church/|title=The British Intelligence: The Egyptian Interior exploded the church {{!}} Philip Brennan|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=8 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512232814/http://www.philipbrennan.net/2011/02/07/the-british-intelligence-the-egyptian-interior-exploded-the-church/|archivedate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sinai insurgency===
{{main article|Sinai insurgency}}
The Sinai insurgency comprises a series of actions by Islamist militants in the [[Sinai peninsula]], initiated in early 2011 as a fallout of the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution]]. The actions of those Islamist elements, largely composed of tribesmen among the local [[Bedouin]]s, drew a harsh response from interim Egyptian government since mid-2011 known as [[Operation Eagle]]. However, attacks against government and foreign facilities in the area continued into 2012, resulting in a massive crackdown by the new Egyptian government nicknamed [[Operation Sinai (2012)|Operation Sinai]]. In May 2013, following an abduction of Egyptian officers, violence in the Sinai surged once again. Following the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état]], which resulted in the ousting of [[Mohamed Morsi]], "unprecedented clashes" have occurred.&lt;ref name=ahram5july&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/75792/Egypt/Politics-/Clashes-in-Sinai-over-Morsi-removal.aspx|title=Clashes in Sinai over Morsi removal|publisher=Ahram Online|date=5 July 2013|accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 downing of Metrojet Flight 9268===
{{main|Kogalymavia Flight 9268}}
On 31 October 2015 [[Kogalymavia Flight 9268|Metrojet Flight 9268]] mysteriously dropped out of the sky over the Sinai Peninsula killing all 224 passengers on board. It was an international chartered passenger flight, operated by Russian airline Kogalymavia (branded as Metrojet), following departure from [[Sharm el-Sheikh]] International Airport, [[Egypt]], en route to Pulkovo Airport, [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia. The aircraft, an [[Airbus A321-231]], was carrying mostly tourists, there were 219 Russian, four Ukrainian, and one Belarusian. With its death toll of 224 people, the crash of Flight 9268 is the deadliest both in the history of Russian aviation and within Egyptian territory. It is also the deadliest air crash involving an aircraft from the Airbus A320 family, and the deadliest plane crash of 2015.  [[ISIL]] has now several times claimed responsibility for the incident, and authorities from several countries now agree that the most plausible scenarios is bomb smuggled on board at the airport.  Pictures are circulating on the internet showing internally caused ruptures.  Many countries race to upgrade airport security measures over fears that ISIL plans more such attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/putin-suspend-russian-flights-egypt-deadly-jet-crash/story?id=35019367 |title=Egypt admits bomb most likely scenarios for downing Metrojet |publisher=ABCNews.com |accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''The Chinese State in Ming Society '' is set in the Ming dynasty, an era in which there was much "[[Commerce|commercial]] expansion and [[Culture|cultural]] [[innovation]]".&lt;ref name="RoutledgeBlurb"/&gt; The book is an "account of events and issues that engaged the members of local [[elite]]s in [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] society and of the interface between these elites and the state,"&lt;ref name="NewZealandJournalOfAsianStudies"/&gt; and the impact of the state on ordinary people in areas such as [[education]], [[Judiciary|justice]], the [[military]] and [[taxation]].&lt;ref name="NewZealandJournalOfAsianStudies"/&gt;

The book consists of a reworking of eight "heavily illustrated" essays which Brook has written and published separately over the years, and is divided into four main sections (parts I to IV) with two of these essays to each part of the book.&lt;ref name="NewZealandJournalOfAsianStudies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RoutledgeBlurb"/&gt; The parts are named "Space", "Fields", "Books" and "[[Monastery|Monasteries]]", each of which "represent important areas of intersection between the Ming state and society."&lt;ref name="NewZealandJournalOfAsianStudies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RoutledgeBlurb"/&gt;

Brook argues that the model of [[despotism|despotic government]] fails to account for the complex interactions between individuals, groups, communities, society and state in this period.&lt;ref name="NewZealandJournalOfAsianStudies"/&gt; Instead he proposes that by 1500 the Chinese had a remarkably developed system of [[Government|governance]], surpassing that of the European [[Monarchy|monarchs]] of the time, and that the developments were not the result of the isolated actions of the state, but rather of a complex interface and interaction, including local representatives of the state such as [[magistrate]]s and local networks of the elite [[Social class|class]] of [[gentry]].&lt;ref name="NewZealandJournalOfAsianStudies"/&gt; According to Ellen Soulliere in her review, Brook argues that "society had the [enduring] ability to constrain, limit and sometimes redirect the [[authority]] of the state, without challenging its most basic claim to be the source of all legitimate authority."&lt;ref name="NewZealandJournalOfAsianStudies"/&gt;

==Reception==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
Writing in the ''[[New Zealand Journal of Asian Studies]]'', Ellen Soulliere describes the book as a "detailed", "succinct" and "compelling" account.&lt;ref name="NewZealandJournalOfAsianStudies"/&gt; In conclusion, she states that "All in all, this is a fascinating and very valuable book that addresses major themes in [[History of China|Chinese history]] while greatly expanding our detailed knowledge of the issues that engaged people at the level of their local communities. It illuminates the [[Group conflict|conflicts]] and [[Controversy|controversies]] that kept the state and society in a state of dynamic tension throughout the Ming period and beyond."&lt;ref name="NewZealandJournalOfAsianStudies"/&gt;

[[File:MiddlePassage.jpg|thumb|First edition (publisher [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]) ]]

'''''The Middle Passage: Impressions of Five Societies - British, French and Dutch in the West Indies and South America''''' is a 1962 book-length essay / [[Travel journal|travelogue]] by [[V. S. Naipaul]]. It is his first book-length work of non-fiction.&lt;ref name="Dooley2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gillian Dooley|title=V.S. Naipaul, Man and Writer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWMnQmhCwaYC&amp;pg=PA37|year=2006|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|isbn=978-1-57003-587-6|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has the sub-title "The Caribbean Revisited".

The book covers a year-long trip through [[Trinidad]], [[British Guiana]], [[Suriname]], [[Martinique]], and [[Jamaica]] in 1961. As well as giving his own impressions, Naipaul refers to the work of earlier travellers such as [[Patrick Leigh Fermor]], who described a similar itinerary in ''The Traveller's Tree'' (1950). Naipaul addresses a range of topics including the legacy of slavery and colonialism, race relations, the roles of South Asian immigrants in the various countries, and differences in language, culture, and economics.

A '''tragic hero''' is the [[protagonist]] of a [[tragedy]] in [[dramas]].  In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] records the descriptions of the tragic hero to the playwright and strictly defines the place that the tragic hero must play and the kind of man he must be. Aristotle based his observations on previous dramas.&lt;ref&gt; Aristotle, On Poetics, Ingram Bywater&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the most famous instances of tragic heroes appear in [[Greek literature]], most notably the works of [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]]. Others, like the contemporary tragedy of J.P. Carney, happen in the ordinary confinements of our own world, bespeaking to the hubris of the modern man in the age of technology and leg day.

==Aristotle's tragic hero==

In ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Aristotle suggests that the hero of a tragedy must evoke a sense of pity or fear within the audience, stating that “the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity."&lt;ref&gt;S.H. Butcher, The Poetic of Aristotle (1902), pp. 45-47&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, the focus of the hero should not be the loss of his [[prosperity]]. He establishes the concept that [[pity]] is an emotion that must be elicited when, through his actions, the character receives undeserved misfortune, while the emotion of [[fear]] must be felt by the audience when they contemplate that such misfortune could possibly befall themselves in similar situations. Aristotle explains such change of fortune "should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad.” Such misfortune is visited upon the tragic hero "not through vice or depravity but by some error of judgment." This error, or [[hamartia]], refers to a flaw in the character of the hero, or a mistake made by the character.

An example of a mistake made by a tragic hero can be found in Sophocles' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''. In the story, the character of Oedipus is given a prophecy that he will murder his own father and marry his own mother. Although he goes to great lengths to avoid fulfilling the prophecy, Oedipus learns that the life of a man he took, Laius, was actually that of his own father, and that the woman to which he is married, Jocasta, is actually his own mother.

[[Creon]] of Sophocles' ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'' is another notable example of a tragic hero. Polyneices and his brother, Eteocles, were kings, and the former wanted more power, so he left and assembled an army from a neighboring city. They attacked and the two brothers killed each other. Through Creon's law forbidding the burial of [[Polyneices]], Creon dooms his own family. Other examples provided by Aristotle include [[Thyestes]].

Therefore, the Aristotelian hero is characterized as virtuous but not "eminently good," which suggests a noble or important personage who is upstanding and morally inclined while nonetheless subject to [[human error]]. Aristotle's tragic heroes are flawed individuals who commit, without evil intent, great wrongs or injuries that ultimately lead to their misfortune, often followed by tragic realization of the true nature of events that led to this destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Reeves, The Aristotelian Concept of The Tragic Hero, Vol. 73, No. 2 (1952), Published by: The Johns Hopkins University Press Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/291812 pp. 172-188&lt;/ref&gt; This means the hero still must be – to some degree – morally grounded. The usual [[irony]] in Greek tragedy is that the hero is both extraordinarily capable and highly moral (in the Greek [[honor]]-culture sense of being duty-bound to moral expectations), and it is these exact, highly-admirable qualities that lead the hero into tragic circumstances.  The tragic hero is snared by his or her own greatness: extraordinary competence, a righteous passion for duty, and (often) the arrogance associated with greatness ([[hubris]]).

==In other media==
The influence of the Aristotelian hero extends past [[Classical Greece|classical Greek]] [[literary criticism]]. Greek theater had a direct and profound influence on Roman theater and formed the basis of Western theater that continues into the modern era, deeply influencing a wide variety of arts throughout the world, in diverse mediums such as literature, music, film, television and even video games. Many iconic characters featured in these genres follow the archetype of the tragic hero. Examples of such characters include [[Anakin Skywalker]] from George Lucas'  ''[[Star_Wars#Prequel_trilogy|Star Wars]]'' films, Okonkwo from Nigerian author Chinua Achebe's novel ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'', Arthas Menethil from the video game franchise ''[[Warcraft]]'', and [[Stannis Baratheon]] from [[George R. R. Martin]]'s novel series ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' and the HBO television series adaptation ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. Some film historians regard [[Michael Corleone]] of ''[[The Godfather (film series)|The Godfather]]'' a tragic hero, although using traditional literary conventions, the character would more closely fit the role of [[villain]], not tragic hero.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/handv.aspx AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023071414/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/handv.aspx |date=October 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand Hungarian|Vendkérdés|date=September 2011}}

The '''Wendish question''' ({{lang-hu|Vendkérdés,}} {{lang-sl|Vendsko vprašanje,}} [[Prekmurje dialect]]: ''Vendsko pítanje,'' or ''Vendiško pitanje'') in Hungarian Nationalist and Chauvinist politics concerns the origin and nomenclature of the [[Hungarian Slovenes]].

The traditional Hungarian term for the [[Slovenes]] living in [[Hungary]] was "Wend" ({{lang-hu|Vend}}). Many Slovenes in Hungary accepted this nomenclature, although in their dialect, they always referred to themselves as "Slovenes". In the last decades of the 19th century, and especially during the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Horthy regime]], the term "Wend" was used in order to emphasize the difference between the Slovenes of historic Hungary and other Slovenes.

The term Wend received popular use among the emigre community in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.  This same community vigorously opposed the including of Prekmurje into the new Yugoslavia, lobbying the US Trianon negotiators against such inclusion.

The border between [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] was finally regulated by the [[Treaty of Trianon]] on June 4, 1920. The territory inhabited by Slovenes (the so-called ''Vendvidék'') was divided by the watershed of the two rivers [[Rába]] and [[Mur River|Mura]]. The Mura region ([[Prekmurje]]), including the areas of [[Murska Sobota]] and [[Lendava]], went to [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], while the Raba Region ([[Porabje]]) including nine communes around [[Szentgotthárd]], became part of Hungary. After this separation, the two regions' economy, politics, culture and ethnicity developed independently.

After the German [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in 1941, Hungary annexed the regions lost in 1920 including Slovenian Prekmurje. It was expedient to argue that the inhabitants of the Prekmurje region were not Slovenes after all, helping to substantiate Hungary's claim to Prekmurje. [[Sándor Mikola]], a well-known Hungarian physicist hailing from Slovenian Prekmurje, used his influence to publicize this view in his book ''A Vendség múltja és jelene'' (''The past and present of the Wends''). In the book he describes how the Wends were descended from the [[Celts]], but assimilated into the surrounding Slavic population. This theory has no scientific foundation and is not linguistically substantiated in the language of this population.

Prekmurje remained a part of [[SFR Yugoslavia]] and [[SR Slovenia]] when the Trianon boundaries were restored after [[World War II]].

'''Whitley Stokes''', [[Order of the Star of India|CSI]], [[Order of the Indian Empire|CIE]], [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (28 February 1830 – 13 April 1909) was an Irish lawyer and [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] scholar.

==Background==
He was a son of [[William Stokes (physician)|William Stokes]] (1804–1878), and a grandson of [[Whitley Stokes (physician)|Whitley Stokes]] (1763–1845), each of whom was [[Regius Professor of Physic (Dublin)|Regius Professor of Physic]] at the [[University of Dublin]]. His sister [[Margaret Stokes]] was a writer and archaeologist.

He was born at 5 [[Merrion Square]], Dublin and educated at [[St Columba's College, Dublin|St Columba's College]] where he was taught Irish by Denis Coffey, author of a ''Primer of the Irish Language''.&lt;ref name=CELT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/stokes.html |title=CELT: Whitley Stokes |publisher=Ucc.ie |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through his father he came to know the Irish antiquaries [[Samuel Ferguson]], [[Eugene O'Curry]], [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] and [[George Petrie (artist)|George Petrie]].&lt;ref name=CELT /&gt; He entered [[Trinity College, Dublin]] in 1846 and graduated with a BA in 1851. His friend and contemporary Rudolf Thomas Siegfried (1830–1863) became assistant librarian in Trinity College in 1855, and the college's first professor of [[Sanskrit]] in 1858. It is likely that Stokes learnt both Sanskrit and [[comparative philology]] from Siegfried, thus acquiring a skill-set rare among Celtic scholars in Ireland at the time.&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36315 |title=Whitley Stokes |publisher=Oxforddnb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Stokes qualified for the bar at [[Inner Temple]]. His instructors in the law were [[Arthur Cayley]], [[Hugh Cairns, 1st Earl Cairns|Hugh McCalmont Hughes]], and [[Thomas Chitty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Stokes, Whitley|journal=Who's Who|year=1908|page= 1736|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015047640118;view=1up;seq=1764}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stokes became an English [[barrister]] on 17 November 1855, practicing in London before going to India in 1862, where he filled several official positions. In 1865 he married Mary Bazely by whom he had four sons and two daughters.&lt;ref name=CELT /&gt; One of his daughters, Maïve, compiled a book of ''Indian Fairy Tales'' in 1879 (she was 12 years old) based on stories told to her by her Indian ''ayahs'' and a man-servant. It also included some notes by Mrs. Mary Stokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review. Indian Fairy Tales by Maive Stokes, Mary Stokes|journal=The Folk-Lore Record|volume=3| issue= 1|year=1880|pages=145–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/indianfairytales00stok|title=Indian Fairy Tales, collected and translated by Maive Stokes. With Notes by Mary Stokes, and an Introduction by W. R. S. Ralston|publisher=Ellis and White|year=1880|author=Stokes, Maive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary died while the family was still living in India. In 1877, Stokes was appointed legal member of the viceroy's council, and he drafted the codes of civil and criminal procedure and did much other valuable work of the same nature. In 1879 he became president of the commission on Indian law. Nine books by Stokes on Celtic studies were published in India. He returned to settle permanently in London in 1881 and married Elizabeth Temple in 1884.&lt;ref name=CELT /&gt; In 1887 he was made a [[Order of the Star of India|CSI]], and two years later a [[Order of the Indian Empire|CIE]] He was an original fellow of the [[British Academy]], an honorary fellow of [[Jesus College, Oxford]] and foreign associate of the [[Institut de France]].&lt;ref name=Oxford /&gt;

==Celtic scholarship==
Whitley Stokes is perhaps most famous as a Celtic scholar, and in this field he worked both in India and in England. He studied Irish, [[Breton language|Breton]] and [[Cornish language|Cornish]] texts. His chief interest in Irish was as a source of material for comparative [[philology]]. Despite his learning in [[Old Irish]] and [[Middle Irish]], he never acquired Irish pronunciation and never mastered [[Modern Irish]].&lt;ref name=Oxford /&gt; In the hundred years since his death he has continued to be a central figure in Celtic scholarship.&lt;ref name=Oxford /&gt; Many of his editions have not been superseded in that time and his total output in Celtic studies comes to over 15,000 pages.&lt;ref name=Oxford /&gt; He was a correspondent and close friend of [[Kuno Meyer]] from 1881 onwards. With Meyer he established the journal ''Archiv für celtische Lexicographie'' and was the co-editor, with [[Ernst Windisch]], of the ''Irische Texte'' series.&lt;ref name=Oxford /&gt;

In 1862 he was awarded the [[Cunningham Medal|Cunningham Gold Medal]] by the Royal Irish Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ria.ie/getmedia/3b7984d2-3580-4438-9d55-08ae8ded4e4e/Cunningham-Medal-2008---Seamus-Heaney.pdf.aspx Royal Irish Academy|title=Cunningham Medal|publisher=RIA|accessdate=11 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427021827/http://www.ria.ie/getmedia/3b7984d2-3580-4438-9d55-08ae8ded4e4e/Cunningham-Medal-2008---Seamus-Heaney.pdf.aspx|archivedate=27 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and reputation==
[[File:Whitleystokes.jpg|right|thumb|Stokes in old age]]
Stokes died at his London home, 15 Grenville Place, Kensington, in 1909 and is buried in Paddington Old Cemetery. Willesden Lane, where his grave is marked by a Celtic cross. Another Celtic cross was erected as a memorial to him at St Fintan's, Sutton, Dublin.  The [[Gaelic League]] paper ''[[An Claidheamh Soluis]]'' called Stokes "the greatest of the Celtologists" and expressed pride that an Irishman should have excelled in a field which was at that time dominated by continental scholars.&lt;ref name=Oxford /&gt; In 1929 the Canadian scholar James F. Kenney described Stokes as "the greatest scholar in philology that Ireland has produced, and the only one that may be ranked with the most famous of continental savants".&lt;ref name=Oxford /&gt;

A conference entitled "Ireland, India, London: The Tripartite Life Of Whitley Stokes" took place at the [[University of Cambridge]] from 18–19 September 2009.&lt;ref name="admin.cam.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/dp/2009091702 |title=Home - News - University of Cambridge |publisher=Admin.cam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was organised to mark the centenary of Stokes's death.&lt;ref name="admin.cam.ac.uk"/&gt; A volume of essays based on the papers delivered at this conference, ''The tripartite life of Whitley Stokes (1830-1909)'',
was published by [[Four Courts Press]] in autumn 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourcourtspress.ie/product.php?intProductID=1005 |title=Four Courts Press: The tripartite life of Whitley Stokes (1830-1909) by Elizabeth Boyle &amp; Paul Russell, editors |publisher=Fourcourtspress.ie |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 [[Dáibhí Ó Cróinín]] published ''Whitley Stokes (1830-1909):the Lost Celtic Notebooks Rediscovered'', a volume based on the scholarship in Stokes's 150 notebooks which had been resting unnoticed at the University Library, [[Leipzig]] since 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fourcourtspress.ie/product.php?intProductID=879 |title=Four Courts Press: Whitley Stokes (1830-1909) by Dáibhí Ó Cróinín |publisher=Fourcourtspress.ie |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214131411/http://www.fourcourtspress.ie/product.php?intProductID=879 |archivedate=2012-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
