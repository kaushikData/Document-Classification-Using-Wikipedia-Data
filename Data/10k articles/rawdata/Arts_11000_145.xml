'''''A Syntopicon: An Index to The Great Ideas''''' (1952) is a two-volume index, published as volumes 2 and 3 of [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]’s collection ''[[Great Books of the Western World]]''. Compiled by [[Mortimer Adler]], an American philosopher, under the guidance of [[Robert Hutchins]], president of the [[University of Chicago]], the volumes were billed as a collection of the 102 great ideas of the [[western canon]]. The term “syntopicon” was coined specifically for this undertaking, meaning “a collection of topics.”&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Mortimer J.. Syntopicon Booklet Draft, Box 4, Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library.&lt;/ref&gt; The volumes catalogued what Adler and his team deemed to be the fundamental ideas contained in the works of the Great Books of the Western World, which stretched chronologically from [[Homer]] to [[Freud]]. The ''Syntopicon'' lists, under each idea, where every occurrence of the concept can be located in the collection’s famous works.

==History==
The ''Syntopicon'' was created to set the Great Books collection apart from previously published sets (such as [[Harvard Classics]]). Robert Hutchins, at the time, in addition to being the president of the University of Chicago, also served as Chairman of the Board of Editors of the Encyclopædia Britannica. Hutchins and Adler were recruited by the encyclopedia’s publisher for a “special idea”&lt;ref&gt;Allen, J. S. (1983). The romance of commerce and culture: Capitalism, modernism, and the Chicago-Aspen crusade for reform. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which would increase the collection’s marketability.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Anne H. "The Philosophy of General Education and Its Contradictions: the Influence of Hutchins." The Journal of General Education 50 (2001): 165–191&lt;/ref&gt;

With this mission, Adler undertook a project that would consume over a decade of his life: identifying and indexing the western world’s Great Ideas. In the end, the ''Syntopicon'' would require over 400,000 man-hours of reading&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Mortimer J. Syntopicon Booklet Draft, Box 4, Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library&lt;/ref&gt; and cost over two million dollars.&lt;ref name="Mortimer, Adler J 1950"&gt;Mortimer, Adler J. Letter to J. Loy Maloney. 11 Apr. 1950. Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library, Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt; Britannica publisher Senator [[William Benton (senator)|William Benton]] joked at the Great Books presentation dinner that “the Syntopicon is said to be the most expensive two volumes editorially in all publishing history. How Hutchins and Adler achieved that unique distinction, the publisher is still trying to figure out. ([[Clifton Fadiman]]) assured me some day the story will be told. I’d like it whenever I can get it.”&lt;ref&gt;Benton, William. "Great Books of the Western World." Encyclopædia Britannica. Presentation Dinner. Waldorf Astoria, New York City. 15 Apr. 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of cataloging each appearance of one of the “Great Ideas” in all 431 works by 71 authors in the collection was so arduous that the ''Syntopicon'' nearly did not make it to print. Before it even came time to print, the budget had topped a million dollars and there was not even “a penny for paper” left.&lt;ref name="Adler"&gt;Adler, Mortimer J. Untitled Letter, Box 4, Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library.&lt;/ref&gt; Adler persevered, however, having spent the previous eight years of his life on the project. He single-handedly raised funds by selling more expensive “Founders Editions” of the sets, and disobeyed the order to fire his entire staff. There were times, during the process when he admitted: “the question was could we sell the plates for junk! Could we dispose of the plates as old metal?”&lt;ref name="Adler" /&gt;

Adler felt, through it all, that he was creating something completely new. The ''Syntopicon'', he felt, would be revolutionary, its release on par with such events as the creation of the first dictionary. It would do for ideas what previous reference books had done for words and facts. He worked with a team of over 100 readers who met twice a week for years to discuss the readings and the ideas within them. Among his editorial team was a young [[Saul Bellow]].

In the end, he produced two volumes, which listed the 102 Great Ideas of the western world, from Angel to World. The set was released with much fanfare, including an honorary gifting of the first two editions to U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] and [[Elizabeth II]]. An internal memo from Encyclopædia Britannica, regarding a release party, reads:

“The projected sequences of events is: (1) Mr. Hutchins kicks off the conference with a discussion of the Great Books movement, and the university’s and Britannica’s interest in the set; (2) Mr. Adler tells in detail of the contents of the set and the significance of the Syntopicon; (3) Cocktails.”&lt;ref&gt;Colvin, James. Letter to C. Scott Fletcher. 12 Apr. 1950. Encyclopædia Britannica Inter Office Correspondence. Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library, Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
In addition to being a “special idea” that would set Great Books of the Western World apart, the ''Syntopicon'' serves four other purposes, outlined in its preface. The ''Syntopicon'' can serve as a reference book, as a book to be read, as an “instrument of liberal education,” and as “an instrument of discovery and research.”&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Mortimer J. "Syntopicon I Preface." Great Books of the Western World. 1st ed. 54 vols. Chicago, IL: Encyclopædia Britannica, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

Above all, however, the ''Syntopicon'' was created to unite the western world’s canon. It was created to solve what Adler saw as a fundamental problem, that “different authors say the same thing in different ways, or use the same words to say quite different things.”&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Mortimer J. Syntopicon Booklet Draft, Box 4, Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library.&lt;/ref&gt; By cataloging the things the great authors were saying in a more scientific manner, Adler hoped to show the underlying unity that ultimately existed in the collected works.

For Hutchins, a chief proponent of classical education, the creation of the ''Syntopicon'' held even greater implications. Hutchins felt that the ideas being discussed and cross-listed in the ''Syntopicon'' might be "powerful enough to save the world from self-destruction."&lt;ref&gt;"There are Only 102 Great Ideas." Look. Jan. 1948: 58–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The ''Syntopicon'' consists of 102 chapters on the 102 Great Ideas. Each chapter is broken down into five distinct sections: the introduction, an outline of topics, references, cross-references, and additional readings. Adler penned all 102 introductions himself, giving a brief essay on the idea and its connection with the western canon. The outline of topics broke each idea down further, into as many as 15 sub-ideas. For instance, the first idea “Angel” is broken down into “Inferior deities or demi-gods in polytheistic religion,” “the philosophical consideration of pure intelligences, spiritual substances, supra-human persons” and seven other subtopics.&lt;ref&gt;"Syntopicon I." Great Books of the Western World. 1st ed. 54 vols. Chicago, IL: Encyclopædia Britannica, 1952. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; After this is the references section (for instance, “inferior deities or demi-gods in polytheistic religion” can be found in Homer, Sophocles, Shakespeare, Milton, Bacon, Locke, Hegel, Goethe and more). Cross-references follow, where similar ideas are listed. Last is the additional readings, in which one could seek out more on the subject of “Angel.”

The list of 102 ideas is broken between the two volumes, as follows:

Volume I: [[Angel]], [[Animal]], [[Aristocracy]], [[Art]], [[Astronomy]], [[Beauty]], [[Being]], [[Cause]], [[Chance (philosophy)|Chance]], [[wikt:change|Change]], [[Citizen]], [[Constitution]], [[Courage]], [[convention (norm)|Custom and Convention]], [[Definition]], [[Democracy]], [[Interpersonal attraction|Desire]], [[Dialectic]], [[Duty]], [[Education]], [[Classical element|Element]], [[Emotion]], [[Eternity]], [[Evolution]], [[Experience]], [[Family]], [[destiny|Fate]], [[wikt:Form|Form]], [[God]], [[wikt:good|Good]] and [[Evil]], [[Government]], [[Habituation|Habit]], [[Happiness]], [[History]], [[Honor]], [[Hypothesis]], [[Idea]], [[Immortality]], [[Inductive reasoning|Induction]], [[Infinity]], [[Judgment]], [[Justice]], [[Knowledge]], [[Labour (economics)|Labor]], [[Language]], [[Law]], [[Liberty]], [[Life]] and [[Death]], [[Logic]], and [[Love]].

Volume II: [[Man]], [[Mathematics]], [[Matter]], [[Mechanics]], [[Medicine]], [[Memory]] and [[Imagination]], [[Metaphysics]], [[Mind]], [[Monarchy]], [[Nature]], [[Metaphysical necessity|Necessity]] and [[Contingency (philosophy)|Contingency]], [[Oligarchy]], [[1 (number)|One]] and [[wikt:many|Many]], [[Opinion]], [[wikt:opposition|Opposition]],&lt;ref&gt;that which deals with the quality of sets of words that are opposite&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philosophy]], [[Physics]], [[Pleasure]] and [[Pain]], [[Poetry]], [[Principle]], [[Progress (history)|Progress]], [[Prophecy]], [[Prudence]], [[Punishment]], [[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]], [[Quantity]], [[Reasoning]], [[Property (philosophy)|Relation]],&lt;ref&gt;that which deals with what is "relative" to another object&lt;/ref&gt; [[Religion]], [[Revolution]], [[Rhetoric]], [[Identity (philosophy)|Same]] and [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], [[Science]], [[Sense]], [[Sign (linguistics)|Sign]] and [[Symbol]], [[Sin]], [[Slavery]], [[Soul (spirit)|Soul]], [[Space]], [[Sovereign State|State]], [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]], [[Theology]], [[Time]], [[Truth]], [[Tyranny]] and [[Despotism]], [[Universal (metaphysics)|Universal]] and [[Particular]], [[Virtue]] and [[Vice]], [[War]] and [[Peace]], [[Wealth]], [[Will (philosophy)|Will]], [[Wisdom]], and [[World]].

==Reactions==
The release of the ''Syntopicon'' and the Great Books of the Western World was covered in the ''[[New York Herald]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', and local papers across the United States.

Full page ads for ''Time'' magazine appeared in newspapers across the country, saying “What and Why is a Syntopicon?”&lt;ref&gt;"TIME Magazine." Advertisement. ''Chicago Daily News'' 20 Apr. 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; Time published an article about the new, pivotal piece of reference material, and Adler wrote them back in thanks, saying that “I think the piece is both thoroughly accurate and very lively, which, considering the subject matter, is quite a feat.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mortimer, Adler J. Letter to Bruce Barton. 22 Apr. 1950. Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library, Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Look (American magazine)|''Look'']] magazine ran a feature on the ''Syntopicon'', displaying behind-the-scene photos of the index’s staff at work. In one picture, editor Joe Roddy is shown weighing the number of entries about love on a scale. “Discussions of love by great authors,” the caption reads, “outweigh sin and eternity.”&lt;ref&gt;"There are Only 102 Great Ideas." Look Jan. 1948: 58–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the extensive press coverage and cross-country speeches, however, sales of the ''Syntopicon'' and the Great Books of the Western World were slow. Experienced encyclopedia salesmen had to be brought in to move the product, despite Hutchins’ dislike of this solution.

The ''Syntopicon'''s list was "arbitrary", as even Adler admitted.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The press and others also found problems with the ''Syntopicon'', and despite Adler’s predictions (“we predict that, as dictionaries are indispensable in the realm of words, and encyclopaedias in the realm of facts, so the Syntopicon will become indispensable in the realm of ideas”&lt;ref name="Mortimer, Adler J 1950"/&gt; ) the ''Syntopicon'' has fallen into relative obscurity. At the time of its release, ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' declared: “Its defects are on the surface. One is the implication that great books are concerned only with ideas which can be logically analyzed—whereas many masterpieces of literature live in realms partially or wholly outside the realm of logic. Another is the conception that the chief purpose of reading a book is to crack its shell and reach its kernel—the form itself being unimportant decoration.”&lt;ref&gt;Highet, Gilbert. "The Great Ideas of the Western World." Rev. of Great Books of the Western World, by Mortimer J. Adler. ''New York Times Book Review'' 14 Sept. 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent books==
In a succeeding book, Adler expressed his regret that the [[civil rights]] concept of [[social equality|Equality]] had not been selected. He attempted to rectify the omission with ''Six Great Ideas: [[Truth]]–[[Good and evil|Goodness]]–[[Beauty]]–[[Liberty]]–[[egalitarianism|Equality]]–[[Justice]]'' (1981).

Adler attempted another index, in one volume, the ''[[Propædia]]'' for the fifteenth edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. A traditional two-volume alphabetical index has since been produced for the more recent versions of the fifteenth edition, in addition to ''Propædia''.

The '''Antioch mosaics''' are a grouping of over 300 [[mosaic]] floors created around the 3rd century [[Anno Domini|AD]], and discovered during archaeological excavations of [[Antioch]] between 1932 and 1939 by a consortium of five museums and institutions. About half of the mosaics are housed at the [[Hatay Archaeology Museum]] in [[Antakya]], with others currently residing at the [[Worcester Art Museum]], [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], [[Baltimore Museum of Art]], [[Harvard University]] and [[Princeton University Art Museum]] among others. The mosaics range in design from realistic imagery and scenes, to purely geometric patterns.

==History==
[[File:Mosaics, Worcester Art Museum - IMG 7443.JPG|thumb|200px|left|''[[Worcester Hunt Mosaic|The Worcester Hunt]],'' located at the [[Worcester Art Museum]], is the largest Antioch Mosaic in the United States.]]

[[Antioch]] was an ancient city located just outside the modern day city of [[Antakya]], [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="Fabrikant" /&gt; During the reign of [[Hadrian]], during the 2nd century, through to the reign of [[Justinian]] in the 6th century, mosaic floors were the fashion in the city and its surrounding suburbs. The city thrived until it was destroyed by earthquakes in 526 and 528.&lt;ref name="Baltimore"&gt;[http://www.artbma.org/collection/overview/mosaics.html Collection: Antioch Mosaics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212071121/http://www.artbma.org/collection/overview/mosaics.html |date=December 12, 2010 }}. [[Baltimore Museum of Art]]. Retrieved January 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1932, a consortium of museums and institutions sponsored expeditions to the archaeological sites where the city of [[Antioch]] once stood. These museums, the [[Worcester Art Museum]], [[Princeton University Art Museum|Princeton University]], the [[musée du Louvre]], the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]], and [[Harvard University]]'s affiliate [[Dumbarton Oaks]],&lt;ref name="Worcester"&gt;[http://www.worcesterart.org/Information/PR/Past/8-31-02.html Worcester Art Museum Restores Border Panels to Worcester Hunt, Largest Antioch Floor Mosaic in America].

The only surviving part of the majority of the houses was the floors.&lt;ref name="Weisgall"&gt;Weisgall, Deborah.

Retrieved January 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

The floors the archaeologists discovered were covered in intricate mosaics. More than 300 mosaics were found.&lt;ref name="Weisgall" /&gt;

In 1939 the expedition ended and the archaeologists packed up to leave. They left about half of the unearthed mosaics to the city of [[Antakya]], the modern day city located at Antioch, which subsequently built a museum, the [[Antakya Archaeological Museum]], to house them. The rest of the mosaics were split up amongst the institutions that took part in the dig, and were sent all over the world.&lt;ref name="Weisgall"/&gt; To be transported, large amounts of concrete was poured behind the mosaics to create a stable backing.&lt;ref name="Fabrikant"&gt;Fabrikant, Geraldine.

[[New York Times]]. August 29, 2005. Retrieved January 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; When dividing up the floors, the archeologists, often took apart rooms and sent different parts of the floor to different museums. For an exhibit at the Worcester Art Museum in 2000, mosaics were compiled from Paris, Baltimore, Princeton and [[Wellesley College|Wellesley]], to reassemble a single room's floor.&lt;ref name="Weisgall"/&gt; After the expedition left, the pits were filled back in and olive groves were planted over them.&lt;ref name="Weisgall"/&gt;

{{Heraldic achievement}}
In [[heraldry]], an '''armiger''' is a person entitled to use a [[heraldic achievement]] (e.g., bear arms, an "armour-bearer") either by hereditary right, grant, matriculation, or assumption of arms. Such a person is said to be '''armigerous'''.

==Etymology==
The Latin word ''armiger'' literally means "arms-bearer". In high and late medieval England, the word referred to an [[esquire]] attendant upon a [[knight]], but bearing his own unique armorial device. &lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Chivalry'', Uden. Kestrel Books, Harmondsworth, 1968. {{ISBN|0-7226-5372-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Armiger'' was also used as a Latin [[cognomen]], and is now found as a rare surname in English-speaking countries.

==Modern period==

Today, the term ''armiger'' is well-defined only within jurisdictions, such as [[Canada]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom]], where [[heraldry]] is regulated by the state or a heraldic body, such as the [[College of Arms]], the [[Chief Herald of Canada]], the [[Court of the Lord Lyon]] or the [[Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland]]. A person can be so entitled either by proven (and typically [[agnatic]]) descent from a person with a right to bear a [[heraldic achievement]], or by virtue of a grant of arms to himself. Merely sharing the same family name of an armiger is insufficient.

Most of the time, the usage of a heraldic achievement is governed by legal restrictions; these restrictions are independent of the copyright status and independent of a coat of arms depiction. A coat of arms represents its owner. Though it can be freely represented, it cannot be appropriated, or used in such a way as to create a confusion with or a prejudice to its owner.

In the [[Netherlands]], titles of nobility are regulated by law but heraldry is not. In [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] the nobility has had, since 1762, the prerogative to use an [[open helmet]], while others use a [[closed helmet]].

'''Baubo''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Βαυβώ) is an old woman in [[Greek mythology]] which appears particularly in the myths of the early [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]] religion. Known as the Goddess of Mirth, she was bawdy and sexually liberated, and is said to have jested with [[Demeter]], when Demeter was mourning the loss of her daughter, [[Persephone]].

==Scholarly discussion==
In his ''Greek Myths'' (1996), [[Robert Graves]] writes that Demeter (in disguise) was the guest of [[Celeus|King Celeus]] in [[Eleusis]]. [[Iambe]], the lame maid of the king:
  
{{quotation|... tried to console Demeter with comically lascivious verses, and a dry nurse, old Baubo, persuaded her to drink [[Barley water|barley-water]] by a jest: she groaned as if in great travail and, unexpectedly, produced from beneath her skirt Demeter's own son [[Iacchus]], who leapt into his mother's arms and kissed her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Greek Myths |last=Graves |first=Robert|year=1996 |publisher=Folio Society |location=London |volume=volume 1|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Graves writes: 
[[File:Baubo figurine.jpg|thumb|188px|right|A face-in-body Baubo figurine.]]

{{quotation|Iambe and Baubo personify the obscene songs, in [[Iamb (poetry)|iambic metre]], which were sung to relieve emotional tension at the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]; but Iambe, Demeter, and Baubo form the familiar [[Triple deity|triad]] of [[Virginity|maiden]], [[nymph]], and [[crone]]. Old nurses in Greek myth nearly always stand for the goddess as crone.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''., p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The following excerpt is taken from [[Clement of Alexandria]]'s ''Exhortation to the Greeks,'' from a 1919 English translation:

{{quotation|Baubo, having received Demeter as a guest, offers her a draught of wine and meal. She declines to take it, being unwilling to drink on account of her mourning. Baubo is deeply hurt, thinking she has been slighted, and thereupon uncovers her secret parts and exhibits them to the goddess. Demeter is pleased at the sight, and now at least receives the draught, — delighted by the spectacle! These are the secret mysteries of the Athenians! These are also the subjects of Orpheus’ poems. I will quote you the very lines of [[Orpheus]], in order that you may have the originator of the mysteries as witness of their shamelessness:

“This said, she drew aside her robes, and showed a sight of shame; child Iacchus was there, and laughing, plunged his hand below her breasts. Then smiled the goddess, in her heart she smiled, and drank the draught from out the glancing cup.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement of Alexandria]]. Translated by Butterworth, G. W. (1919), [[Loeb Classical Library]], volume 92. Cambridge, Massachusetts. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Baubo figurines==
Figurines known as Baubos are found in a number of settings, usually with Greek connections. They were mass-produced in a number of styles, but the basic figure always exposes the [[vulva]] in some way:

* A plump woman with her legs held apart, gesturing to her exposed vulva.
* A naked splay-legged figure holding a harp on the back of a boar.
* A naked headless torso with the face in the body and the vulva in the chin of the face.
* A seated figure with an exaggerated vulva filling the space between the legs.
* A naked squatting figure with her hands on her genitalia

The figurines usually had elaborate [[headdress]]es, and some hold cups or harps. Some figurines have a loop moulded into the head, which seems to indicate that they were suspended in some way (possibly as an amulet).

'''''Beeldenstorm''''' in Dutch, roughly translatable to "statue storm", or '''''Bildersturm''''' in German ("image/statue storm"), also the '''Great Iconoclasm''' or '''Iconoclastic Fury''', is a term used for outbreaks of destruction of religious images that occurred in Europe in the 16th century. During these spates of [[iconoclasm]], Catholic art and many forms of church fittings and decoration were destroyed in unofficial or mob actions by [[Calvinist]]{{dubious|date=June 2018}} Protestant crowds as part of the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref name="Marshall2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Byfield2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Byfield|first=Ted|title=A Century of Giants, A.D. 1500 to 1600: In an Age of Spiritual Genius, Western Christendom Shatters|year=2002|publisher=Christian History Project|language=English|isbn=9780968987391|page=297|quote=Devoutly Catholic but opposed to Inquisition tactics, they backed William of Orange in subduing the Calvinist uprising of the Dutch beeldenstorm on behalf of regent Margaret of Parma, and had come willingly to the council at her invitation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the destruction was of art in churches and public places.&lt;ref name="Kleiner2010"/&gt;

The Dutch term usually specifically refers to the wave of disorderly attacks in the summer of 1566 that spread rapidly through the [[Low Countries]] from south to north. Similar outbreaks of iconoclasm took place in other parts of Europe, especially [[Reformation in Switzerland|in Switzerland]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the period between 1522 and 1566, notably [[Zürich]] (in 1523), [[Copenhagen]] (1530), [[Münster]] (1534), [[Geneva]] (1535), and [[Augsburg]] (1537).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;John Phillips, ''Reformation of Images: Destruction of Art in England, 1535–1660'', (Berkeley: University of California Press) 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England there was both government-sponsored removal of images and also spontaneous attacks from 1535 onwards, and in [[Scotland]] from 1559.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In France there were several outbreaks as part of the [[French Wars of Religion]] from 1560 onwards.

==Background==
In France unofficial episodes of large scale destruction of art in churches by [[Huguenot]] Calvinists had begun in 1560; unlike in the Low Countries they were often physically resisted and repulsed by Roman Catholic crowds, but were to continue throughout the [[French Wars of Religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Eire, 279–280&lt;/ref&gt; In Anglican England much destruction had already taken place in an organized fashion under orders from the government,&lt;ref name="Buchanan2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Colin|title=The A to Z of Anglicanism|date=4 August 2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|language=English|isbn=9780810870086|page=26|quote=Royal Injunctions order the reading of biblical passages in English at the mass, along with the destruction of images and the provision of a “poor men's box” for alms.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Northern Europe, groups of Calvinists marched through churches and removed images, a move which "provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs" in Germany and "antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox" in the Baltic region.&lt;ref name="Marshall2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=The Reformation|date=22 October 2009|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English|isbn=9780191578885|page=114|quote=Iconoclastic incidents during the Calvinist 'Second Reformation' in Germany provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs, while Protestant image-breaking in the Baltic region deeply antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox, a group with whom reformers might have hoped to make common cause.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamport|first=Mark A.|title=Encyclopedia of Martin Luther and the Reformation|date=31 August 2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781442271593|page=138|quote=Lutherans continued to worship in pre-Reformation churches, generally with few alterations to the interior. It has even been suggested that in Germany to this day one finds more ancient Marian altarpieces in Lutheran than in Catholic churches. Thus in Germany and in Scandinavia many pieces of medieval art and architecture survived. Joseph Leo Koerner has noted that Lutherans, seeing themselves in the tradition of the ancient, apostolic church, sought to defend as well as reform the use of images. "An empty, white-washed church proclaimed a wholly spiritualized cult, at odds with Luther's doctrine of Christ's real presence in the sacraments" (Koerner 2004, 58). In fact, in the 16th century some of the strongest opposition to destruction of images came not from Catholics but from Lutherans against Calvinists: "You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return" (Koerner 2004, 58). Works of art continued to be displayed in Lutheran churches, often including an imposing large crucifix in the sanctuary, a clear reference to Luther's ''theologia crucis''. ... In contrast, Reformed (Calvinist) churches are strikingly different. Usually unadorned and somewhat lacking in aesthetic appeal, pictures, sculptures, and ornate altar-pieces are largely absent; there are few or no candles; and crucifixes or crosses are also mostly absent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, Switzerland and England, conversion to Protestantism had been enforced on the whole population at the level of a city, principality or kingdom, with varying degrees of discrimination, persecution or expulsion applied to those who insisted on remaining Roman Catholic. The Low Countries, Flanders, [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Holland]],&lt;ref&gt;What is now approximately [[Limburg (Belgium)|Belgian Limburg]] was part of the [[Bishopric of Liège]] and ruled by the bishop (shown in brown on the map).&lt;/ref&gt; were part of the inheritance of [[Philip II of Spain]], who was a devout Catholic and self-proclaimed protector of the [[Counter-Reformation]], and [[suppression of dissent|suppressed]] Protestantism through his Governor-general or Regent, [[Margaret of Parma]] the illegitimate daughter of [[Emperor Charles V]], who was herself more willing to compromise. Although Protestants so far represented only a relatively small proportion of the Netherlandish population, but including disproportionate numbers from the nobility and upper [[bourgeoisie]], the Catholic Church had evidently lost the loyalty of the population, and traditional Catholic [[anti-clericalism]] was now dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

The region affected was perhaps the richest in Europe, but still seethed with economic discontent among parts of the population, and had suffered a poor harvest and hard winter. However, recent historians are generally less inclined to see the movement as prompted by these factors than was the case a few decades ago.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 95–98, and 116, especially note 105 (where "reputation" is presumably a misprint for "refutation"). Elliott, 89–91, first written in 1968, reflects a version of the older view, for which the German Marxist historian Erich Kuttner was the standard-bearer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollmann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DPGMstg0fosC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=iconoclasm+Beeldenstorm&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OstrTdHyEMKKhQeUmsygDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=iconoclasm%20Beeldenstorm&amp;f=false 179-80].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Die Predigt Johannes des Täufers (Bruegel).jpg|thumb|400px|An outdoor sermon (''The Preaching of St. John the Baptist'') depicted by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], apparently in 1565, the year before the Beeldenstorm movement began.]]
The Beeldenstorm grew out of a turn in the behaviour of Low Country Protestants starting around 1560, who became increasingly open in their religion, despite penal sanctions. Catholic preachers were interrupted in sermons, and raids were organized to rescue Protestant prisoners from jail, who then often fled into exile in France or England. Protestant views were spread by a large movement of "field sermons" or open-air sermons ({{lang-nl|hagepreken}}) held outside towns, and therefore out of the jurisdiction of the town authorities. The first took place on the ''Cloostervelt'' near [[Hondschoote]], in what is now the [[arrondissement of Dunkirk]] in [[French Flanders]], very close to where the attacks later began, and the first one to be armed against disruption was held near [[Boeschepe]] on July 12, 1562, two months after religious war had broken out again over the (then) French border just nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Petegree, 74–75&lt;/ref&gt;

These open-air sermons, mostly by [[Anabaptist]] or [[Mennonite]] preachers, spread through the country, attracting huge crowds, though not necessarily of those leaning to Protestantism, and in many places immediately preceded the iconoclastic attacks of August 1566. Prosecutions for [[heresy]] continued, especially in the south, although they were erratic, and in some places clergy of clearly heretical views{{Which|date=October 2017}} were appointed to churches. By 1565 the authorities seem to have realized that persecution was not the answer, and the level of prosecutions slackened, and the Protestants became increasingly confident in the open.&lt;ref&gt;Petegree, 82–86&lt;/ref&gt; A letter of July 22, 1566, from local officials to the Regent, warned that "the scandalous pillage of churches, monasteries and abbeys" was imminent.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low Countries iconoclastic attacks in 1566==
[[File:Tachtigjarigeoorlog-1566.png|thumb|300px|Blue: The spread of the Beeldenstorm in the Low Countries. Brown: Within the independent [[Bishopric of Liège]].]]

On August 10, 1566, the [[feast-day]] of [[Saint Lawrence]], at the end of the [[pilgrimage]] from Hondschoote to [[Steenvoorde]], the chapel of the ''Sint-Laurensklooster'' was defaced by a crowd who invaded the building. It has been suggested that the rioters connected the saint especially with Philip II, whose monastery palace of the [[Escorial]] near [[Madrid]] was dedicated to Lawrence, and was just nearing completion in 1566.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 103–104&lt;/ref&gt; Iconoclastic attacks spread rapidly northwards and resulted in the destruction of not only images but all sorts of decoration and fittings in churches and other church or clergy property. However, there was relatively little loss of life, unlike similar outbreaks in France, where the clergy were often killed, and some iconoclasts too.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 116&lt;/ref&gt;

The attacks reached the commercial centre of the Low Countries, Antwerp, on August 20, and on August 22 Ghent, where the cathedral, eight churches, twenty-five monasteries and convents, ten hospitals and seven chapels were wrecked. From there, it further spread east and north, reaching [[Amsterdam]], then a much smaller town, by August 23, and continuing in the far north and east into October, although the main towns were mostly attacked in August. [[Valenciennes]] ("Valencijn" on the map) was the most southerly town attacked. In the east, [[Maastricht]] on September 20 and [[Venlo]] on October 5 saw attacks, but generally the outbreaks were restricted to more westerly and northern areas.&lt;ref&gt;See map with dates in Petegree, 118; Arnade, 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; Over 400 churches were attacked in Flanders alone.&lt;ref&gt;Eire, 280&lt;/ref&gt;

The eye-witness [[Richard Clough]], a Welsh Protestant merchant then in Antwerp, saw: "all the churches, chapels and houses of religion utterly defaced, and no kind of thing left whole within them, but broken and utterly destroyed, being done after such order and by so few folks that it is to be marvelled at." The [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Church of Our Lady in Antwerp]], later made the cathedral (illustrated at top): "looked like a hell, with above 10,000 torches burning, and such a noise as if heaven and earth had got together, with falling of images and beating down of costly works, such sort that the spoil was so great that a man could not well pass through the church. So that in fine [short], I cannot write you in x sheets of paper the strange sight I saw there, organs and all destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;Spicer, 109 (spelling modernized); see also Arnade, 146–148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dutchrevolt.leiden.edu/english/sources/Pages/15660721.aspx Eye-witness Account of Image-breaking at Antwerp], Universiteit Leiden {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120709173750/http://dutchrevolt.leiden.edu/english/sources/Pages/15660721.aspx |date=2012-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicolas Sander, an English Catholic exile who was a professor of theology at [[Old University of Louvain|Louvain]], described the destruction in the same church:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;these fresh followers of this new preaching threw down the graven [sculpted] and defaced the painted images, not only of Our Lady but of all others in the town. They tore the curtains, dashed in pieces the carved work of brass and stone, brake the altars, spoilt the clothes and corporesses, wrested the irons, conveyed away or brake the chalices and vestiments, pulled up the brass of the gravestones, not sparing the glass and seats which were made about the pillars of the church for men to sit in.&amp;nbsp;... the [[Blessed Sacrament]] of the altar&amp;nbsp;... they trod under their feet and (horrible it is to say!) shed their stinking piss upon it&amp;nbsp;... these false bretheren burned and rent not only all kind of Church books, but, moreover, destroyed whole libraries of books of all sciences and tongues, yea the Holy Scriptures and the [[church Fathers|ancient fathers]], and tore in pieces the maps and charts of the descriptions of countries.&lt;ref&gt;Miola, 58–59, 59 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:UtrechtIconoclasm.jpg|thumb|250px|Damaged relief statues in the [[Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht]].]]
Such details are corroborated by many other sources. Accounts of the actions of the iconoclasts from eyewitnesses and the records of the later trials of many of them make it clear that there was often a considerable element of [[carnival]] to the outbreaks, with much mockery of the images and fittings such as fonts recorded as the iconoclasts went about their work. Alcohol features largely in very many accounts, perhaps in some cases because in Netherlandish law being drunk could be regarded as a mitigating factor in criminal sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 105–111&lt;/ref&gt;

The destruction frequently included ransacking the priest's house, and sometimes private houses suspected of sheltering church goods. There was much looting of common household goods from clergy houses and monasteries, and some street robberies of women's jewellery by the crowd; after the images were smashed and the property occupied, "men fed their stomachs in a carnivalesque indulgence of beer, bread, butter and cheese, while women carted off provisions for the kitchen or bedroom".&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 111–112 (quote from 112); 102 for women's jewellery robbed.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many accounts of rituals of inversion, in which the church sometimes stood for the whole social order. Children sometimes participated enthusiastically, and street games afterwards became play battles between "[[papist]]s" and "[[Geuzen|beggars]]". One child was killed in Amsterdam by a stone thrown in such a game.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 111–114; for the whole paragraph: 104–122&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere the iconoclasts seemed to treat their actions as a job of work; in one city the group waited for the bell rung to mark the start of the working day before beginning their work. The tombs and memorial inscriptions of the [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patriciate]] and nobility, and in some cases royalty, were defaced or destroyed in several places, although secular public buildings such as town halls, and the palaces of the nobility, were not attacked.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 116–124&lt;/ref&gt; In Ghent, on the one hand the memorial in a church to Charles V's sister Isabel (and so Philip's aunt) was carefully left alone, but a statue in the street of Charles V and the Virgin was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 119–120&lt;/ref&gt;

The actions were controversial among Protestants, some of whom implausibly tried to blame Catholic [[agent provocateur]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Petegree, 117–119&lt;/ref&gt; as it became clear that "the more popular elements of the dissident movement were out of control".&lt;ref&gt;Wells, 91&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant ministers and activists returning from exile in England and elsewhere played a significant role, and individual wealthy Protestants were widely suspected of hiring men to do the work in some places, especially Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Petegree, 116–117, and elsewhere, on returning exiles; Arnade, 146–147 on paid iconoclasts&lt;/ref&gt;

In some rural areas gangs of iconoclasts moved across country between village churches and monasteries for several days.&lt;ref name="Kleiner2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: A Concise History of Western Art|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|language=English |isbn=9781424069224|page=254|quote=In an episode known as the Great Iconoclasm, bands of Calvinists visited Catholic churches in the Netherlands in 1566, shattering stained-glass windows, smashing statues, and destroying paintings and other artworks they perceived as idolatrous.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 101–102; 104–109&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere there were large crowds involved, sometimes locals, and sometimes from outside the area. In some places the nobility gave assistance, ordering the clearing of churches on their estates. Local magistracies were often opposed, but ineffective in stopping the destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Petegree, 119–124; Arnade, 120–122&lt;/ref&gt; In many towns the archer's guild, who had a function in controlling public order, took no steps against the crowds.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 120&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1566, unlike the situation after the [[Eighty Years War]] and today, Protestantism in the Low Countries was mainly concentrated in the south (roughly modern [[Belgium]]), and much weaker in the north (roughly now the [[Netherlands]]), and iconoclasm in the north began later, after news of the events in Antwerp was received, and was more successfully resisted by local authorities in some towns, although still succeeding in most.&lt;ref name="Brouwer2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brouwer|first=Maria|title=Governmental Forms and Economic Development: From Medieval to Modern Times|date=11 August 2016|publisher=Springer|language=English|isbn=9783319420400|page=224|quote=The city of Amsterdam pursued a policy of restraint against the Calvinists. The iconoclast movement reached Amsterdam in August 1566, but the city government had moved and stored away many church possessions before the iconoclasts reached the city. All churches were closed to tame the fury.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once again individually socially prominent laymen often took the lead.&lt;ref&gt;Petegree, 124–128&lt;/ref&gt; In many places there were, or were later said to have been, false claims of official commissions from some local authority to perform the actions, and by the end of the outbreak some northern towns removed images by order of the local authority, presumably to prevent the disorder that would accompany a mob action.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 120–122&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of the records of the later trials show a wide range of occupations, covering craftsmen and small tradespeople, especially in the textile trade, and also a variety of church employees, at a fairly low level. Where wealth and property are recorded, it is "modest at best".&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 102&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Stille beeldenstorm" of 1581 in Antwerp==
Following the 1566 attacks in Antwerp there was a further period of iconoclasm there in 1581, after a Calvinist city council was elected and purged the city's clergy and guilds of Catholic office-holders. This is known as the "quiet" or "stille" beeldenstorm, as the removal of images was carried out by the institutions they belonged to, the council itself, churches and the guilds. Some images were sold rather than destroyed, but most seem to have been lost. By the summer of 1584 Antwerp was [[Fall of Antwerp|besieged by the Duke of Parma's Spanish army]], falling a year later.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic losses==
[[File:Le Sac de Lyon par les Réformés - Vers1565.jpg|thumb|300px|The looting of the Churches of Lyon by Calvinists in 1562.]]
Rarely was any thought given to the artistic heritage of these cities in 1566, though families were sometimes able to protect the [[church monument]]s of their ancestors, and in [[Delft]] the syndics of the painters' [[Guild of Saint Luke]] were able to rescue the altarpiece by [[Maarten van Heemskerck]], which the guild had commissioned only 15 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Montias, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[van Eyck]]s' [[Ghent Altarpiece]], then as now famous as a supreme example of [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and already a major tourist attraction, just restored in 1550, was saved by dismantling it and hiding it in the cathedral tower. A first attack on August 19 was deterred by a small number of guards. When a larger attack was made at night two days later the iconoclasts had provided themselves with a tree trunk as a battering ram, and succeeded in breaking through the doors.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Charney, 72–73 - a populist account; when he says April he means August, and "The Lamb" refers to the altarpiece. Petegree, 118 has the Beeldenstorm reaching Ghent on August 22. See also Arnade, 118&lt;/ref&gt;

By then the panels had been removed from the frame and hidden, with the guards, on the narrow spiral staircase up the tower, with a locked door at ground level. They were not detected and the crowd left after destroying what else they could find.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The panels were then moved to the town hall, and only returned to view in 1569, by which time the elaborate frame had disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e0X5lErg2tsC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=iconoclasm+%22Ghent+altarpiece%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gNJpTbjeIoiGhQedwbCfDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Early Netherlandish Paintings: Rediscovery, Reception and Research|first1=Bernhard|last1=Ridderbos|first2=Henk Th van|last2=Veen|first3=Anne van|last3=Buren|date=25 March 2018|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite militia guards, two of the three main churches in [[Leiden]] were attacked; in the [[Pieterskerk, Leiden|Pieterskerk]] the choirbooks and altarpiece by [[Lucas van Leyden]] were preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pieterskerk.com/en/explore/16e-eeuw/1566/|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120910114711/http://www.pieterskerk.com/en/explore/16e-eeuw/1566/|deadurl=yes|title=Iconoclasm - Pieterskerk Leiden|date=10 September 2012|archivedate=10 September 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Oude Kerk (Amsterdam)|Oude Kerk]] in Amsterdam an altarpiece with a central panel by [[Jan van Scorel]] and side panels painted on both sides by Maarten van Heemskerck was lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=46VdllfOUIUC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=art+destroyed+in+1566&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OZhuTfauM8y7hAfdtI2qBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=art+destroyed+in+1566&amp;f=false|title=Northern Renaissance Art, 1400-1600: Sources and Documents|first=Wolfgang|last=Stechow|date=25 March 1966|publisher=Northwestern University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important works of several painters, especially those like [[Pieter Aertsen]] who worked in Antwerp,&lt;ref&gt;[[Gustav Friedrich Waagen]], [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3JIZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=Iconoclasm+1566&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=jBXZSZTZKpWQMqKfgLoB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; were all destroyed, leading to a somewhat distorted view of the art history of the period. An altarpiece in [[Culemborg]] had been commissioned in 1557 from the painter Jan Dey, was then destroyed in 1566 and in 1570 recommissioned from Dey, apparently as a copy of the first. However the new work was only in place for five years before it was removed when the town went officially Calvinist.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Lynn F., review of Liesbeth M.

==Consequences==
[[File:Kreuz von stadelhofen.jpg|thumb|300px|Later depiction of the destruction of a wayside cross in [[Zurich]] in 1523.]]
On August 23, [[Margaret of Parma]], the Habsburg Regent or Governor-general, whose capital of [[Brussels]] was unaffected by the movement, agreed to an "Accord" with the group of aristocratic Protestant leaders known as the "Compromise" or ''[[Geuzen]]'' ("Beggars"), by which freedom of religion was granted, in exchange for allowing Catholics to worship unmolested and an end to the violence. Instead, "the outbreak of the iconoclastic fury began an almost uninterrupted series of skirmishes, campaigns, plunder, pirate-raids, and other acts of violence. Not all areas suffered violence at the same time or to the same extent, but practically none remained unscathed."&lt;ref&gt;Lesger, 110&lt;/ref&gt;

Many elite Protestants were now alarmed by the forces unleashed, and some of the nobility began to shift towards support of the government. Implementing the somewhat vague terms of the agreement led to further tensions, and [[William the Silent|William of Orange]], appointed by Margaret to resolve the situation in Antwerp, tried and failed to produce a wider settlement that all parties could live with. Instead unrest continued and the episode fed into the [[causes of the Dutch Revolt]] which was to erupt two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, 91–93; Petegree, 132–134; Wells, 89–91; Arnade, 100&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 29 Margaret wrote a somewhat panicked letter to Philip, "claiming that half the population were infected with heresy, and that over 200,000 people were up in arms against her authority".&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JxK_O5IclRIC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=Iconoclasm+1566&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=jBXZSZTZKpWQMqKfgLoB#v=onepage&amp;q=Iconoclasm+1566&amp;f=false|title=Immigrants and the Industries of London, 1500-1700|first=Liên|last=Luu|date=25 March 2018|publisher=Ashgate|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip decided to send the [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] with an army; he would have led them himself but was kept in Spain by other matters, especially the increasingly evident insanity of his heir, [[Carlos, Prince of Asturias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hXK2fxzn2lAC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=iconoclasm+Beeldenstorm&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LzNrTefmAYa4hAeRtOjsDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=iconoclasm+Beeldenstorm&amp;f=false|title=The Political Thought of the Dutch Revolt 1555-1590|first=Martin van|last=Gelderen|date=3 October 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Alba arrived the following year, and soon replaced Margaret as Governor-general, his heavy-handed repression, which included the execution of many convicted of iconoclastic attacks the summer before, only made the situation worse.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Antwerp was then Europe's largest financial and international trading centre, taking as much as 75 or 80% of English exports of cloth,&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; and the disturbances created serious and well-justified fears that its position as such was under threat. Sir [[Thomas Gresham]], the English financier who arranged [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s borrowings, and whose agent in Antwerp was Clough, left London for Antwerp on August 23, only hearing about the Antwerp attacks ''en route''; he needed to roll-over 32,000 Flemish pounds and borrow another 20,000 to finance her expenses in Ireland. Dining with William of Orange on his arrival, he was asked if "the English were minded to depart this town or not", and wrote to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]], Elizabeth's chief minister, "in alarm that he "liked none of their proceedings" but "apprehended great mischief", and urged that the English government "should do very well in time to consider some other realm and place" for marketing English products. It was a message that helped shape the course of events."&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, 50&lt;/ref&gt;

The English had found the Antwerp [[money market]] short of funds since earlier in the year, and now made use of [[Cologne]] and [[Augsburg]] as well, but as events unfolded in the next year, and the personal position of some leading lenders became precarious, the English found to their surprise that repayments were no longer pressed for, probably as the lenders were happy to keep their money abroad on loan to a secure borrower.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch Revolt, which from 1585 onwards included a Dutch blockade of the River [[Scheldt]] leading to the city, was to finally destroy Antwerp as a major trading centre.

[[File:Dirck van Delen - Beeldenstorm in een kerk.jpg|thumb|300px|The painting ''Beeldenstorm in een kerk'', 1630, by [[Dirck van Delen]], six decades after the original actions.]]
In many places there were attempts by Calvinist preachers to take over the ransacked buildings. These were usually repulsed in the period after the attacks. In the months afterwards there were attempted negotiations in many cities, by William of Orange and others, to allocate certain churches to accommodate the local Protestants, often divided into [[Lutheran]]s and Calvinists. These had mostly failed within a few weeks, not least because Margaret's government rejected them; she had already had an earlier attempt at compromise overruled by Philip a few months earlier, and been embarrassingly forced to retract a decree.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, 48&lt;/ref&gt; Instead there was a wave of building or adapting Calvinist "temples", though in the end none of these were to remain in use by the following year, and their layouts, which seem to have echoed early Swiss and Scottish Calvinist designs, are now largely unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Spicer, 110–118&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the revolt proper had started, there were many further instances of clearing churches, some still unofficial and disorderly, but as cities became officially Protestant, increasingly undertaken by official order, like the Amsterdam [[Alteratie]] ("Alteration") of 1578. Altars, to which Calvinists, unlike Lutherans, took strong exception, were typically completely removed, and in some large churches, like Utrecht Cathedral, large tomb monuments put where they stood, partly to make their return more difficult if political conditions changed. After the Eighty Years War was finally over, in the cities and areas that became Protestant, the old Catholic churches were all or nearly all taken over by the new [[established church]] of the Calvinist [[Dutch Reformed Church]], with other congregations left to shift for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Spicer, 116–124, and following pages&lt;/ref&gt;

The bare and empty state of those churches left in Catholic hands after the hostilities eventually ended prompted a large programme of restocking with Catholic art, which had much to do with the vigour of [[Northern Mannerism]] and later [[Flemish Baroque painting]], and many Gothic churches were given [[Baroque]] makeovers.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 4, 13&lt;/ref&gt; In the north, now very largely Protestant, religious art largely disappeared, and [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] concentrated on a wide range of secular subjects, such as [[genre painting]], [[landscape art]] and [[still-life]]s, with results that might sometimes have surprised the Protestant ministers who initiated the movement. According to one scholar, this "was not only a dramatic change in the function of art, it was the context in which our present concept of art, what the literary critic [[M. H. Abrams]] called "art as such", first began to take shape", replacing a "construction model" where art theory concerned itself with how the maker created his work, with a "contemplation model" concerned with the effect of the finished work on a "lone perceiver" or viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (short quotes from Abrams), 131&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Book-and-record sets''' are a form of entertainment for children, consisting of a picture storybook (often in [[comic book]] format, with drawings or photos) and an accompanying recording (originally in the form of a [[vinyl record]]; later in [[cassette tape]] and [[compact disc]] formats) to be played while following along with the book. The record and book complement one another, with the record usually a [[radio theater]]-style version of the story or a [[soundtrack]] recording, and the book providing visuals and text to the story. Often a tone or other kind of cue in the recording will prompt the reader to turn pages.

Book-and-record sets are popular as teaching tools and aids to reading, and as a simple form of [[multimedia]] entertainment. [[Cartoon characters]] are common subjects (or stars) of the stories, as are comic book [[superhero|superheroes]] and other [[Franchise (media)|media franchises]], characters and personalities. Occasionally popular children's or family movies are adapted for book and record; the stories may either be re-presented by a new cast of performers, members of the movie cast, or the audio taken directly from the movie, with narration added.

[[Disneyland Records]] and related companies produced several such works, as did [[Peter Pan Records]] (and its offshoot [[Power Records (Peter Pan records)|Power Records]]) and others, from the dawn of [[long-playing records]] and the [[45rpm single]] until the digital age. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, [[Capitol Records]] produced many book-and-record sets for children, ranging from everything from [[Bozo the Clown]] to the classical music fantasy ''[[Sparky's Magic Piano]]''. A "picture storybook" of the 1982 movie ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' narrated by [[Michael Jackson]] became a highly prized [[collectible]], after it went out of print. Newer sets may still be found among recordings for children.

The '''Regional Center for the Promotion of Books in Latin America and Caribbean''' '''(CERLALC)''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish:]] ''Centro Regional para el Fomento del Libro en América Latina y el Caribe''''',''' {{lang-pt|Centro Regional para o Fomento do Livro na América Latina e no Caribe}}) is an [[intergovernmental organization]] sponsored by [[UNESCO]]. The organization's headquarters are located in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]]. Its main goal is to foster favorable conditions for the development of reading communities in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]].

CERLALC has 21 member states and the organization aims its activities toward  book production and distribution; the promotion of reading and writing, the training of the actors of the book-publishing process and the stimulation and protection of intellectual creation. In this regard, it provides technical assistance in the formulation of public policies, generates knowledge, disseminates specialized information, develops and promotes training processes and promotes spaces for dialogue and cooperation.

== History ==
The establishment of CERLALC was part of [[UNESCO]]’s program for the promotion of books, which took place during UNESCO’s 14th general conference in Paris, in 1966. The original project included the creation of four centres for the promotion of book production in the world: Latin America, Asia, Africa and the Arab States. The result of this conference was the beginning of one of the most successful experiences in regional integration projects around the book.

On September 7th, 1967, the Colombian government requested UNESCO that the multilateral approaches for book promotion be extended to Latin America in the Program and Budget for the years 1969-1970. The request included the creation of a regional centre for the promotion of books in Latin America as a focal point for efforts aimed at promoting the free circulation and growth of regional book production and distribution.

Through Act 0253 of February 20th, 1970, the Colombian government gave authorization to four local organizations to create the first board of directors of the centre. These organizations were [[Instituto Caro y Cuervo]], Instituto Colombiano de Cultura, Colcultura , Instituto Colombiano para el Fomento de la Educación Superior, [[ICFES]] and Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje, [[National Training Service (Colombia)|SENA]]. The national organization was named Centro Regional para el Fomento del libro en América Latina, CERLAL. (The second “C” letter was added at a later date). The Ministers of Education and Foreign Affairs, along with the National Planning Department of Colombia, were also part of this board.

On March 3, 1970, the founding act was signed, while decree 2290 established the bylaws of CERLALC as a national organism. Following this, On April 23, 1971, in Bogotá, the Colombian government and UNESCO signed an international cooperation agreement whereby Colombia committed to transforming the organization created in 1970 into a Regional Centre. This instrument allowed the addition of all Spanish-speaking countries. The Colombian congress gave its approval through Law 27 of 1971. Gradually, in the first four years, several countries of the region joint the regional project. These active countries members  have been: Argentina, Bolivia, Brasil, Costa Rica, Chile, Ecuador, Panamá, Paraguay, República Dominicana, Uruguay and Venezuela.

The Agreement of International Cooperation between UNESCO and the Colombian government that governs until today, was signed in Paris on August 1, 1984 and ratified in Colombia by Law 65 of November 20, 1986. In this international agreement, the reach of the centre was extended to other geographic and linguistic areas, including the Caribbean region (Hence the second “C” letter) and to the countries of the Lusitanian Hispanic linguistic unit, even those outside geographical Latin America.

== Milestones ==

* During the 14th session of UNESCO's General conference, the working framework for strengthening book production and traffic throughout developing worlds was formalized. There was an expert assembly convened by UNESCO in 1969, advising the creation in Bogotá, of a Center for the Promotion of the Book in Latin America, helping as a focal point for cooperation to promote the free circulation and growth of production and regional distribution of books.
* In April 23, 1971 the Colombian government and UNESCO signed a mutual international cooperation agreement through which the Colombian government's pledge to turn the local Center, created in 1970, into a regional Center, was approved. When the restructuring was completed, the institution was entirely open to form any bond with all Spanish-speaking countries.
* On the same year, the first actions to promote the Center were undertaken, starting with several training and formation programs focused on publishing production, production seminars and seminars about production and distribution of books. In the same way, the Center, alongside with ALALC (Asociación Latinoamericana de Libre Comercio, the predecessor company to ALADI), developed some activities about information and regional integration.
* In 1975, the growth of the Latin American cooperation network reached an extension of 13 member states. The starting countries were Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Spain, Panama, Paraguay, Dominican Republic, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The network helped create book policies developed by Argentina and Colombia and supported by CERLALC. Additionally, the approach of the integration organisms helped enhance the common market of books, a blueprint for ISBN implementation, along with a number of co-edition and bibliographic database projects.
* In January 1977, the Colombian government and UNESCO renewed the agreement signed in 1971. It would be extended until December 31, 1982.
* In February 1979, in a seminar about Children's book publishing, there was a proposal, which suggested the creation and design of a Latin American co-edition publishing program, focused on children and young adults. The main purpose was to bring a new outreach for regional cultural diversity and broaden the quality of the bid sideways to save costs.
* In August of that same year, during the first Latin American co-edition assembly, the idea grew larger and, in March 1982, the group published its first edition of “Cuentos, mitos y leyendas de América Latina” with a print-run of 20.000 copies.
* In 1982, Cerlal reached an agreement with the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) to promote the use of this identifier in Latin America. The only available agencies were in Mexico (1977) and Brazil (1978), therefore the creation of agencies was encouraged in several countries such as Argentina (1982), Costa Rica (1983), Colombia (1984), Venezuela (1984), Ecuador (1986), Chile(1986), Cuba(1989) Uruguay(1990) and Peru (1995).
* Between 1984 and 1985, the Latin America Traveling Exhibition of Illustrations and Books for Children and Young People was introduced to the public. The CERLALC lead the way to garner greater attention and visibility over children's books, especially illustrated books. This presentation spread the work of graphic illustrators working in the area, increased awareness on the topic in the countries, and inspired the creation of academic programs on illustration.
* In 1988, CERLALC organized a first ISBN agencies meeting in Latin America. In this meeting, all beneficiary countries who had received support, were given a practical seminar on ISBN.
* In 1991, the first ISBN assigning software in Latin America was developed. Following this, in coordination with the ISBN agencies of Venezuela and Colombia, the first version of the Integrated Administration program of ISBN Agencies (PAII) was created.
* In 1993, the Guayaquil type law was drafted and, through this Book law, actions were pursued to promote publishing industries, granting tax exemptions and public purchases. Likewise, this law promoted the intellectual creation, reading promotion, and defense of copyright. It is important to mention this text became a mechanism for the homogenization of the national book legislations standing as an example of standards to Ibero-American lawmakers.
* In August 1994, CERLALC gathered a general meeting, all of the copyright chair holders from the main Latin America universities were invited at the request of UNESCO. In this meeting, UNESCO gave the attending professors relevant information about the UNITWIN program hosted by UNESCO chairs, to set up a network of university lecturers on copyright in the region. On 1995, began the implementation of UNITWIN UNESCO chair program on copyright and related rights in Latin America.
* In 1998, during the 8th Ibero-American Conference of Heads of State and Governments, the Ibero-American Integrated Sales book directory, or ''Repertorio Integrado de Libros en Venta en Iberoamérica'' (RILVI) was created. The main purposes were to collect all the relevant data about the ISBN records and titles linked to national ISBN agencies. The CERLALC was the promoter and main creator of the first regional inventory of editorial offers. On 2010, RILVI stopped being a summit feature program and was turned into a permanent CERLALC activity.
* In 1998, the Ibero-American Cooperation Program on Public Libraries or ''Programa Iberoamericana de Cooperación en materia de Bibliotecas Públicas'' (PICBIP) was created. During the same year, in November, in Cartagena de Indias was held the Ibero-American Encounter of National Managers of Public Libraries. The General Directorate of Books, Archives and Libraries of the Ministry of Education and Culture of Spain, organized and hosted this event, with the sponsorship of the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation or ''Agencia Española de Cooperación Internacional'' (AECI)  and the help of CERLALC. The main goal of this encounter was to start a steady funding mechanism to exchange data, experiences and allow the development of joint actions.
* In 2003, the XIII Summit of Ibero-American Presidents and Heads of State approved the Ibero-American Reading Plan (ILIMITA) at Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia.
* In September 2004, the first Meeting of National Reading Managers was held in Cartagena. In this meeting, the first white paper was presented to the 21 states of Ibero-America. This document included the reading political agenda, which included eleven main concerns about public reading policies. Note should also be taken on the presented recommendations to reach the settled goals, the actions and methods to promote reading throughout an integral perspective which involves the state-will and also to promote a stronger cooperation of different stakeholders on this subject.
* In 2006, the National Network of Reading Plans (Redplanes) was created by a group of entities and people concerned with supporting the search for strategies to streamline policy formulation, and its translation into concrete actions in favor of written culture.
* Also in 2006, a General Experts Assembly was held to discuss the implementation of public policies on copyright. The results of this event, organized by CERLALC, were included in the publication “Diagnosis of copyright in Latin America”. This document outlined the institutional reality of copyright in the region. Also, it highlighted the importance of having an observatory in charge to promote the measurement of the economic impact of creative industries in the region. The results showed that these industries were a key factor for the dissemination of specialized information on copyright. Therefore, it led to the subsequent creation of the Ibero-American Copyright Observatory (ODAI).
* In 2007, the RISBN software was developed. It was a partnership work between CERLALC and the Colombian Book Chamber to develop a software which provided an ease of request to ISBN online. This program would work with all available minimum metadata generated by ONIX.
* In 2010, CERLALC via Ibero-American Copyright Observatory, and a partnership with British council, published two documents named “Creative economy: An introductory guide” and “A practical guide to map the creative industries”. These documents remarked the importance of cultural goods and services in minimizing the impact of political polarization and economic inequality. Simultaneously, these documents gave general guidelines about public policies to measure the impact of creative industries on gross domestic product and job creation, as well as designing promotional strategies for industries protected by copyright in local economies.
* In 2011, a law model, consulted with a group of Ibero-American experts, was presented, its purpose was to give all Latin American countries a mechanism to achieve a formulation for the new book, reading culture and libraries laws. Also, this law model would help deal with the components of the sector in a balanced way, as well as making progress in the construction of reading societies.
* In 2011, the Ibero-American Cooperation Program in Public Libraries (PICBIP) evaluated the overall balance of its first decade, the results showed that the project's scope was limited. Following these results, the Iberbibliotecas Program was created, to contribute to the development and strengthening of public libraries in Latin America.
* In June 2013,CERLAC convened the Intergovernmental Panel “''Nueva Agenda por el libro y la lectura: Recomendaciones para Políticas Públicas en Iberoamerica''”  wherein were presented the further roads to action and suggestions to the local governments regarding book policies. Deputies from 17 states, members and agents from UNESCO, composed this panel during this event, CERLALC identified the most pressing needs of the region to accompany the implementation of the new agenda for books and reading.
* Between 2014 and 2015, there was an important online training course taken by 6.000 educative agents charged with tending to early childhood. The purpose of this course was the promotion of reading, children's literature, art, culture and expressive language skills. This training course was under the framework “''Fiesta de la Lectura''”, sponsored by Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar (ICBF), whose main aim was to guarantee the conditions for the development of communicative, expressive and reading skills in children from 0 to 6 years of age.
* In November 2015, CERLALC invited five Latin American subject experts on the early childhood sector. These special guests discussed topics related to education, reading culture, and comprehensive care regarding this children population. The attending experts were Eva Janovitz (Mexico), María Emilia López (Argentina), Patricia Pereira Leite (Brazil), Evelio Cabrejo (Colombia) and Yolanda Reyes (Colombia). The discussion highlighted once again the importance of several key aspects for making small children active subjects of practices around written and oral language. As a result, they established the main theoretical guidelines to promote the creation of the Ibero-American Observatory of Culture and Education for the Early Childhood (OPI).
* In 2016, the exhibition “''Contra Viento y Marea''” was held. In it, 150 successful projects from different Latin-American countries were collected. These projects presented government initiatives for the promotion of reading and democratic access to books between the end of the 19th century and the first decade of the 2000s. Besides this, CERLALC celebrated the 30th anniversary of the International Book Fair of Guadalajara, with Latin-America as a guest of honour at the book fair. The second edition of “''Contra Viento y Marea''” was held within the framework of the 30th celebration of Bogotá's Book Fair, 2017.
* In 2017, the VI Meeting of the Ibero-American Network of Policy Makers and Reading Plans was held. During the event, agents from 15 ''Redplanes'' member countries met with regional teams of institutions linked to the National Reading Plan of Chile. The Valparaíso Declaration emerged from this meeting; it reaffirms the importance of strengthening regulatory, legislative and budgetary frameworks to guarantee the continuity of the plans.
* In 2018, the Colombian government implemented a statute to safeguard orphaned literary works. They took into account the basis of a proposal by the CERLALC, presented in 2015 and endorsed by the Centre of academic and political spaces in 2018. The amendment to Law 23 of 1982 on copyright and related rights, made through Law 1915 of 2018, is a tool of special value for promoting the development of libraries in Colombia and implementing new strategies to promote access to a wide diversity of contents for users.

== Organizational structure ==
The CERLALC is composed by a council. This superior organism is in charge to approve all of the political guidelines which rule the CERLALC. The council meeting is biennial and it is composed (made-up) by:

== Action lines ==
To fulfil its main statements, CERLALC leads and supports local and regional actions in the following plans of action.

* '''Consultancy and technical help:'''  The Cerlalc offers a wide variety of services related to its member states. Among these services, it is possible to find design, upgrade and achievement of the publishing industrial policies, libraries systems, reading promotion and copyright.
* '''Investigation:''' The specialized knowledge creation is primarily deemed to inform and follow the consecution of public policies in the Ibero-American region. It also helps to foster strategic decisions with private, public and the civil society sectors around the development of reading societies.
* '''Formation:''' Cerlalc has set the backbone to promote the reading societies throughout programs which fulfill the vital need of technical help in the state members. These programs turn around the reading promotion, libraries and copyright. Besides, these courses, on-site and virtual, are a reliable option to reach general and specific objectives on joint projects.
* '''Publishing:'''The publishing activities are en route to give visibility and dissemination to the researches carried by the Center and its experts' advisors. In addition to the above,  the main focus of these projects is to build an international inventory, in order to develop thinking and the actors' labor of the region and the world.
* '''Projects:''' The articulation of these permanent programs requires cooperation between different sectors in Ibero-American societies. These programs integrate the public and private sectors to achieve the specific objectives that promote knowledge management closely aligned with the center's mission objectives and specialized programs. Cerlalc coordinates the Latin American Observatory of Culture and Early Childhood Education and exercises the functions of the Technical Unit of the Ibero-American Program of Public Libraries (Iberbibliotecas).

== Headquarters ==
CERLALC's first headquarters was granted by Colombia's Ministry of Education. It was located in the historical center of Bogotá. Due to staff extension, a new headquarters was needed soon after. That is why in 1973, the CERLALC acquired its new and current main office.

The '''Church of San Juan Bautista''' or '''San Juan Bautista de Baños de Cerrato''' is an ancient stone Early Medieval church (traditionally taken to be [[Visigoth]]ic) dedicated to St [[John the Baptist]] in the town of [[Baños de Cerrato]], ancient ''Balneos'', in the [[province of Palencia]], in central [[Spain]].  

==History==
The church is located in the fertile [[Pisuerga River]] valley, near the confluence with the [[Carrión River]]. The nearby town of [[Venta de Baños]] is presently larger and more important than Baños de Cerrato. In [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]], the area was devoted to vacationing and relaxation, with many private villas dotting the landscape. In Roman times as under the Visigoths, this was an important grain-producing region.

[[File:SAN JUAN DE BAÑOS LápidaDeConsagración.JPG|thumb|left|Replica of original consecration inscription]]
An original church (which is not the one currently standing) was commissioned by the [[Visigoth]]ic king [[Recceswinth]] of [[Hispania]] (the [[Iberian Peninsula]], comprising modern [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]), in the year 661 and whose solemn consecration ceremony is believed to have taken place on the 3rd of January, 661. It has a consecration inscription over its entry, in awkward capital letters. This text is also preserved in a codex of the 10th century, copied from a [[Toledo, Spain|Toledan]] manuscript from the 8th century. A literal translation would be:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Inscripción de construcción del rey Recesvinto
|trans-title=Construction inscription of King Recesvinto
|url=http://ceres.mcu.es/pages/ResultSearch?Museo=MAN&amp;txtSimpleSearch=Inscripci%F3n%20de%20construcci%F3n%20del%20rey%20Recesvinto
|publisher=National Archaeological Museum of Spain
|language=Spanish
|translator-first=Pedro de|translator-last = Palol
|access-date=2017-11-10
}} (The date 699 corresponds to 661 because of the difference of 38 years between the [[Spanish era]] calendar and the [[anno Domini]] calendar.)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Forerunner of the Lord, martyr John the Baptist owns this seat, built as an eternal gift which I myself, King Recesvinto, devotee and lover of your name, dedicated to you in his own right, in the third year, after the tenth, as an illustrious companion of the kingdom, in the Era, six hundred and ninety-nine.}}

The church was built as a royal foundation under the control of the Bishops of [[Palencia]]. The excavations that were carried out in 1956 and 1963 yielded a medieval necropolis of 58 tombs to the north-west of the church and discovered three pieces of 7th-century bronze: two belt buckles in the shape of a lyre and one liturgical object.

The most recent archaeological studies have proven it to be not Visigothic, but Mozarabic (so, [[9th century]] or more probably [[10th century]] in date).&lt;ref&gt;Walker, R. 2016. ''Art in Spain and Portugal from the Romans to the Early Middle Ages''. Late Antique and Early Medieval Iberia 1 (Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caballero Zoreda, L. 2000. ‘La arquitectura denominada de época visigoda, ¿es realmente tardorromana o prerrománica?’ in Luis Caballero Zoreda and Pedro Mateos Cruz (eds.). ''Visigodos y Omeyas. Un debate entre la Antigüedad tardía y la alta Edad Media'', 207-48. Anejos a AEspA 23 (Madrid: CSIC).&lt;/ref&gt; Some arguments for this date include the odd inscription (which is a re-carve of the Visigothic original in non-Visigothic lettering), its unusual layout, the use of ashlar (unparalleled in buildings archaeologically dated to the Visigothic period), and the evident mismatched use of earlier 'Visigothic' carved stones in the frieze.

==Architecture==
The church construction is of [[ashlar]] (squared stone, as against irregular [[rubble]]) set in a drywall manner (with no [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]). It and several other [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic]] churches built in Spain about the same time represent the last ashlar construction in western Europe until [[Charlemagne]], and can be seen as the end of that ancient Roman building tradition in the west. George R.H. Wright notes the [[Syria (Roman province)|Syrian]] influence seen in the horseshoe-shaped arch in pre-Islamic Spain. The belfry above was added at a later date.&lt;ref name="Wright GRH 2000 Illustration 54"/&gt;

'''''Cracks''''' is a 2009 British independent [[psychological thriller]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Jordan Scott]], starring [[Eva Green]], [[Juno Temple]], [[María Valverde]], and [[Imogen Poots]]. It was released theatrically in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 4 December 2009. In the United States it was released by [[IFC Films]] on 18 March 2011,&lt;ref name="metacritic"/&gt; and premiered on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] in late 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sho.com/site/movies/movie.do?episodeid=138490 |title=Cracks |work=Movies on Showtime |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was produced in May 2008, written for the screen by Caroline Ip, Ben Court and Jordan Scott, based on [[Cracks (novel)|the 1999 novel]] written by [[Sheila Kohler]]. Kwesi Dickson, [[Andrew Lowe]], Julie Payne, Rosalie Swedlin and [[Christine Vachon]] were the producers. [[Ridley Scott|Ridley]] and [[Tony Scott]] served as executive producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film-reviews/cracks-film-review-1004011929.story |title=Cracks – Film Review |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first=Michael |last=Rechtshaffen |date=14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was mostly filmed in [[County Wicklow, Ireland]].

==Plot==
Set in the 1930s in a strict [[elite]] [[United Kingdom|British]] [[boarding school]] called St Mathilda's, the story centers on a [[clique]] of girls who idolize their enigmatic [[Diving (sport)|diving]] instructor, Miss G ([[Eva Green]]) (in the film, we learn that Miss G had been a student at the same school where she now works and, in fact, may have even continued on at the school after she graduated). Di Radfield ([[Juno Temple]]) has a crush on Miss G, and is the firm favourite and ringleader of her group. When a beautiful [[Spanish people|Spanish]] girl named Fiamma Corona ([[María Valverde]]) arrives at the school, Miss G's focus is shifted away from the other girls. It becomes a triangle: Miss G gets increasingly obsessed with Fiamma, Fiamma is disturbed by Miss G and also openly disgusted by the teacher's hypocrisies and deceptions, and Di is terribly jealous and makes Fiamma's life hell.

In a very telling scene in the film that clearly highlighted Miss G's deceptions, Miss G (who claimed to be a world traveller to her "girls") goes to a nearby parochial town to buy some provisions. She is visibly upset by this trip and after buying her provisions and drawing the unwanted attention of some local louts, she returns to the school in, it would seem, a near panic. The bullying culminates in Di physically throwing Fiamma out of the school but, as she is unable to return to Spain as she hoped, Fiamma ends up back at the school later that night.

When Fiamma is eventually found, the two girls make the first steps towards friendship, and at the following dorm party they all get a bit drunk, and Fiamma faints. Miss G takes her to her own room. Then Miss G kisses her and rapes her while she is passed out; Di witnesses this through the room door, which was left ajar, and then flees.

The next morning, Fiamma is visibly upset, and Miss G is equally distressed as she runs around after her. Di is broody, and eventually tells the rest of her gang that ''Fiamma'' seduced Miss G. Fiamma presumably tells Miss G that she will report the molestation to the teachers, and horrified, Miss G realises her career will be over. She in turn manipulates Di's affection for her into anger. She says that Fiamma will make up lies about her molesting her (even though it was true) and plan to get her kicked out of school. Di absolutely refuses to allow this to happen.

The confrontation between Di's gang and Fiamma turns ugly as Fiamma declines to answer Di's vicious questions and tries to explain what really happened, hinting at Miss G's lies and character defects. Fiamma runs into the forest as things become more violent, but the girls catch up with her and, under Di's leadership, beat her up with their fists and sticks. Fiamma starts to have an asthma attack, and the girls stop, terrified. They run to get help, and Di runs into Miss G (who had been watching the beating and the chase that ensued quietly and with no attempt to stop the beating), who says she'll stay with Fiamma, and directs Di to go get a teacher.

In the forest, Miss G, alone with Fiamma, refuses to give Fiamma her inhaler and calmly watches her die. Di returns just in time to see Miss G placing the inhaler in Fiamma's lifeless hand, and that's when she realizes the truth.

Later, Di tells the other girls what happened and, united, they confront Miss G. They are powerless officially, but they quit the diving team and symbolically turn in their sashes. The [[head teacher|headmistress]] refuses to acknowledge the school's culpability, and seems only concerned with the school's reputation, but releases Miss G from her duties.

The final scene has Di leaving the school to explore the world, as both Fiamma and Miss G had spoken of doing, whilst Miss G, fired from the school, goes to the local village and finds a small room she can live in, presumably closing herself away for the rest of her life. In a scene that perhaps allows the viewer a better understanding of Miss G's very complex personality, we see her put her few personal possessions on her bedside table. She puts one item there and then quickly removes it to make room for another item. After that, she counts the items to make sure that there are only five. The viewer is then reminded that when Fiamma arrived at the school, in the dorm room, Di had told her that only five personal items could be displayed on her night table at one time. The audience then realizes Miss G is as much a victim of the institutionalized setting she grew up in (she was perhaps like many of the girls at the school "dumped" there and basically forgotten about by her family) as Fiamma was her victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2009/08/cracks200908 |title=Dangerous Lessons |first=Krista |last=Smith |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=August 2009}}

'''''Early Netherlandish Painting''''' (German: '''''Die altniederländische Malerei''''') is a pioneering 14-volume series of illustrated books by the German art historian [[Max Jakob Friedländer]] (1867–1958). The first volume was published in 1924, and the series ran until 1937. It was the first comprehensive modern art-historical survey of [[Early Netherlandish painting]],&lt;ref&gt;The painters are sometimes known as the Flemish Primitives&lt;/ref&gt; a  term often used in art history to describe artists of the [[Low Countries]] during the 15th- and 16th-century [[Northern Renaissance]].

Friedländer developed an interest in northern art of the period while director of the [[Bode Museum|Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum]] in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The collection included a large selection of Flemish paintings, including [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Madonna in the Church]]'', [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'' and ''[[Altar of Saint John]]'', and  [[Hugo van der Goes]]' ''Adoration of the Maji''. Friedländer was struck by the lack of biographical detail on even the most accomplished of the artists, some of whom were still identified by [[notname]]s, the sometimes poorly supported attributions, and general historical neglect.&lt;ref name="mv"&gt;McNamee (1998), vii&lt;/ref&gt;

The book focuses on establishing biographical details for the painters, attributing individual works, and detailing their major stylistic themes and techniques. The undertaking was extremely difficult, given the scant historical record of even the most significant artists.&lt;ref name="s518"&gt;Silver (1986), 518&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was a major influence on [[Erwin Panofsky]]'s equally seminal ''[[Early Netherlandish Painting (Panofsky)|Early Netherlandish Painting]]'', which expanded on Friedländer's biographical and stylistic analysis to focus on [[iconography]], intended meaning and historical context.&lt;ref name="mv" /&gt;

'''Maldivian mythology''' or '''Maldivian folklore''' is the body of myths, tales and anecdotes belonging to the oral tradition of [[Maldivians]]. Even though some of the Maldivian myths were already mentioned briefly by British commissioner in Ceylon [[Harry Charles Purvis Bell|HCP Bell]] towards the end of the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;HCP Bell, ''The Máldive Islands: An account of the Physical Features, History, Inhabitants, Productions and Trade''. Colombo, 1883&lt;/ref&gt; their study and publication were carried out only quite recently by Spanish writer and artist [[Xavier Romero-Frias]], at a time when that ancestral worldview was quickly disappearing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Xavier Romero-Frias]], ''The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom'', Barcelona 1999, {{ISBN|84-7254-801-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Maldives]] lie in the warm equatorial area of the Indian Ocean surrounded by very deep waters. This nation is made up exclusively of coral atolls. There are about 1,200 small flat and sandy islands, but only about 200 of them are inhabited.

The Maldives have been continuously populated for millennia; therefore the folklore of these islands is very ancient.

==Myths of origin==
The main myths of origin are reflecting the dependence of the Maldivians on the [[coconut]] tree and the [[tuna]] fish.

A legend says that the first inhabitants of the Maldives died in great numbers, but a great sorcerer or ''fanḍita'' man made [[coconut tree]]s grow out of the skulls of the buried corpses of the first settlers. Therefore, the coconut tree is said to have an anthropomorphic origin according to Maldive lore.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The coconut tree occupies a central place in the present-day [[Emblem of Maldives|Maldive national emblem]].

The [[skipjack tuna|tuna fish]] is said to have been brought to the Maldivian waters by a mythical seafarer (''maalimi'') called Bodu Niyami Kalēfanu who went close to the Dagas (the mythical tree at the end of the world) to bring this valuable fish.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Myths of extinction==
These myths tell that the end of the Maldives will be a great catastrophe where the islands will be submerged by the surrounding ocean. Similar myths are found in the [[Andaman Islands]] as well as in the [[Nicobar Islands]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==The origin of Malé==
The first settlers in the Maldive Islands were [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] people from the nearest coasts, which are in the Indian Subcontinent and coastal Ceylon. The people of [[Giraavaru (Kaafu Atoll)|Giraavaru]], an island located in [[Malé Atoll]] (now a tourist resort, after its inhabitants were removed) considered the first settlers, claim ancestry from the [[Ancient Tamil country|ancient]] [[Tamil people]].

It is said that Giraavaru fishermen used to go regularly to a certain large sandbank (''finolhu'') at the southern end of their atoll to clean tuna fish after a good catch. Owing to the large amount of tuna fish offal and blood, the waters around that sandbank looked like a big pool of blood (''maa ley gande''h). "Maa" (from the Sanskrit "Maha"), meaning big, and "Lē" meaning blood. Traditionally the first inhabitants of the Maldives, which include the Giraavaru people, didn't have kings. They lived in a simple society and were ruled by local headmen.

One day a prince from the Subcontinent called Koimala arrived to Malé Atoll sailing from the north on a big ship. The people of Giraavaru spotted his vessel from afar and welcomed him. They allowed Prince Koimala to settle on that large sandbank in the midst of the waters tainted with fishblood. Trees were planted on the sandbank and it is said that the first tree that grew on it was the papaya tree. As time went by the local islanders accepted the rule of this Northern Prince. A palace was built and the island was formally named Maa-le [[Malé]], while the nearest island was named Hulhu-le ([[Hulhulé]]).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Evil spirits==

[[File:Be-holhudu2.jpg|thumb|left|''Be''. Popular celebration in [[Holhudu]] Island. Men dressed like evil spirits beat empty ''bandiyaa'' water pots in the night.]]
Most of the popular tales in Maldives are about evil spirits and their interaction with the islanders. These stories contain always a lesson in some form or the other. Certain actions became necessary in order to avoid trouble with the spirit world. These patterns of behaviour, like the importance of keeping a secret, as well as the avoidance of certain areas of the island and of inauspicious times, were an essential component of the ancient popular spirituality.&lt;ref name="NIAS Press"&gt;Romero-Frias, Xavier (2012) ''Folk tales of the Maldives'', [http://www.niaspress.dk/catalogue2011/Catalogue_2012.pdf NIAS Press], {{ISBN|978-87-7694-104-8}}, {{ISBN|978-87-7694-105-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maldivian spirits can take human form, even if it is not known whether they have a human origin or not. While in human shape, the malevolence of those spirits is often masked by beauty and youth. Certain Maldivian evil spirits (handi) have the appearance of charming, beautiful women. These stories about female spirits have their origin in the [[Ancient Dravidian culture|Ancient Dravidian]] [[Village Goddess]] worship and they point to the ethnic origin of the Maldive people.&lt;ref name="NIAS Press"/&gt;
 
Other evil spirits which are the subject of many folk stories in the Maldives (''furēta'') are crude monsters coming from the ocean waters. The tales about sea monsters are part of the local cultural background, which is characterized by the oceanic environment in which, along the millennia, the Maldivian culture developed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Don Hiyala and Alifulhu==
Among the stories in which the spirit and sorcery theme are not essential, the most significant is perhaps '''Don Hiyalā and Alifulhu''', the story of an extraordinarily beautiful woman, or ''faiiymini'' as called by Maldivians, who gets kidnapped from her husband Alifulhu by a villainous king. The lovers reunite at the end of the story, however, their reunion is short lived as they are soon pursued by the King's henchmen. Instead of being captured by the King's men again, Dhonhiyala chooses to commit suicide, and Ali Fulhu follows suit.

==Local fauna==
[[File:XRF-maakana's treachery.jpg|thumb|right|The treachery of Maakana. Illustration of a Maldivian folktale.]]
Folktales where fishes, crabs and seabirds are the heroes, like the tales about Mākana, Findana, Kalhubondage Diye, Fandiyaaru Kakuni, or Don Mohonaai Miyaru, introduce us to the world of the local fauna of the Maldive Atolls, where land animals are very few. Many of these are tales for children and some are still quite popular. 
Although most of the stories of this type are original, a few are foreign tales or fables which have been adapted to the island context through local storytellers or by Maldivian learned men, like the late [[Muhammad Jameel Didi|Muhammad Jamil]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Mighty sorcerers==
In the ancestral oral literature of Maldivians, the sorcerer, or learned man of the island who knew the magic arts. Magic or sorcery is known in Maldives as ''fanḍita''.

The Maldivian sorcerer or ''fanḍita veriyaa'' is always portrayed in the folklore of Maldivians as a hero. Only he knew how to appease the spirits that terrified the average island folk on a daily (or better nightly) basis. Some recent stories tend to cast the sorcerer in the role of a villain, but these are totally disconnected from the ancestral Maldive lore.&lt;ref name="NIAS Press"/&gt;

==The conversion to Islam==
{{Main|History_of_the_Maldives#Introduction_of_Islam}}
According to the well-known Moroccan traveler [[Ibn Batuta]], the person responsible for converting the Maldivians to Islam as a [[Sunni]] Muslim visitor named Abu al Barakat ul Barbari. He subdued [[Mariamman|Ranna Maari]], a demon coming from the sea and convinced the King to become a Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Battuta, Travels in Asia and Africa 1325-1354, tr. and ed. H. A. R. Gibb (London: Broadway House, 1929)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the more reliable local historical chronicles, ''Raadavalhi'' and ''Taarikh'', mention that this saint was actually a Persian from the city of [[Tabriz]], called Yusuf Shamsud-din. He is also locally known as Tabrīzugefānu.&lt;ref&gt;[[HCP Bell]], ''The Máldive Islands. Monograph on the History, Archæology, and Epigraphy'' with W. L. De Silva, Colombo 1940&lt;/ref&gt;
The much venerated tomb of this saint now stands opposite the grounds of Hukuru Miski, in the centre of Malé, the capital.

==Local characters==
Stories about local characters, like '''Rōnu Eduru''', '''Kuda Tuttu Didi''', '''Kalhukuru''' or '''Naalaafushi Fagīru''' (the poor man of [[Naalaafushi]]) give us a glimpse on the way of life in the Maldives when the archipelago was a kingdom, and Malé, the capital, was a quaint, laid back place. In those stories we learn much about the life in the court in Malé and about the mutual interaction between the Radun (the king of Maldives) and his subjects.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Modern variants==
Since there are a great number of islands in the Maldives, many folkstories have different versions according to the particular island and the storyteller in question. 
In recent times some stories have been abridged by contemporary Maldivian writers, like [[Abdulla Sadiq]] or Ahumadu Sharīfu (Maradū) because of their extreme length.&lt;ref name="NIAS Press"/&gt;
 
Other stories ('''Karukuru''', '''Telabagudi''' and the '''Māmeli''' tales) have been sanitized, because there was much casual reference to defecation and bodily fluids, particularly in ancient folk-stories from the outer atolls, where local values found this acceptable.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==The Koimala myth==
'''Koimala Siri Mahaabarana Mahaa Radun''' ([[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]]: ކޮއިމަލާ ސިރީ މަހާބަރަނަ މަހާ ރަދުން) or '''Koimala''' ([[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]]: ކޮއިމަލާ literally "flower lad") or '''Koimala Kalo''' ([[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]]: ކޮއިމަލާ ކަލޯ, literally "Lord Koimala") is a myth about the first [[List of Sultans of the Maldives|king]] of all the [[Maldive Islands]].
Some versions of the Koimala myth claim that it refers to the first ruler of the Maldives after the [[conversion to Islam]], also known as ''Dharumavantha rasgefaanu'', who ruled from 1117 to 1141. It is believed that he was also the first king from the [[Lunar Dynasty|House of Theemuge]] and the Lunar Dynasty. By other accounts he was the fourth king of the Lunar Dynastry founded by King Balaadeettiya as the Soma Vansa Kingdom; although until Koimala the house only ruled over part of the Maldives.

However, ascribing the legend to the first Islamic ruler does not explain who built the large [[Buddhist]] monuments that are present in many inhabited islands and that were built in the first millennium AD.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It also leaves without explaining the existence of an ancient kingly dynasty in the Maldives already before the conversion, as the 12th century correspondence from the king to the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangumanun]], or community of Buddhist monks, in Sathudhuvumati ([[Haddummati Atoll]]) via copper plates proves.&lt;ref&gt;H.A. Maniku &amp; G.D. Wijayawardhana, ''Isdhoo Loamaafaanu''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Maldivian Folklore, Koimala was a prince from the [[Indian subcontinent]] who arrived in [[Malé Atoll]]. The people of [[Giraavaru people|Giraavaru]] spotted his vessel from afar and welcomed him. They allowed Prince Koimala to settle on that large sandbank in the midst of the waters tainted with fishblood. Trees were planted on the sandbank and it is said that the first tree that grew on it was the [[papaya]] tree. As time went by the local islanders accepted the rule of this northern prince. A palace was built and the island was formally named Maa-le ([[Malé]]), while the nearest island was named Hulhu-le ([[Hulhulé Island|Hulhulé]]). Since then Malé has been the seat of the Maldivian crown and now the head of state.

A different account claims Koimala to be a [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]] prince of royal birth from [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]]. The prince is said to have married the Ceylon king's daughter and made a voyage with her in two vessels from Ceylon. Reaching the Maldives they were becalmed, and rested a while at [[Rasgetheemu (Raa Atoll)|''Rasgetheemu'']] island (meaning the King's Island) in [[Northern Maalhosmadulhu Atoll]]. The Maldive Islanders who were then [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], learning that the two chief visitors were of royal descent from the Buddhist kingdom of Ceylon, invited them to remain and ultimately proclaimed Koimala their king at Rasgetheemu. The new king and his spouse migrated to Malé and settled there with the consent of the [[Indigenous peoples|aborigines]] of Giraavaru (See [[Giraavaru people]]) - then the most important community of Malé Atoll. Until then the Maldives is thought to have been ruled by different [[matriarchy|matriarchies]] in different atolls.

After the settlement in Male', two vessels were dispatched to bring more people of his race to populate Male'. It wasn't tradition for the Giraavaru and perhaps other aboriginal people of the Maldives to marry outside their community.

It is not clear, how much of this legend is true. Although he might have been the first king of the whole of Maldives, the story of a prince might actually be a corruption of the stories of King [[Soorudasaruna-Adeettiya]] and King [[Balaadeettiya]]- both exiled princes from the [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] Kingdom of India who founded the Solar and Lunar Dynastries of the Maldives. According to this source (''Kitab fi Athaari Meedoo el-Qadimiyyeh'' by Allama Ahmed Shihabuddine relating from The ''Maapanansa'' copper plates), Koimala or Siri Mahaabarana, the son of King Siri Bovana Aananda was the fourth king of the Lunar Dynastry and uncle to [[Dhovemi of the Maldives|King Dhovemi]] (Siri Bavana-adiththa) the first Sultan (Muslim king) of the Maldives.

Koimala is said to have become the King of the 14 [[atolls]] and two thousand islands of the ''Dheeva Mahal''. His kingdom was referred to as being ''Malikaddu dhemedhu''- or 'all that lies between the [[Minicoy island|Maliku]] and [[Seenu Atoll|Addu]]. He fought against the Raja Dada's (or the forces of the Tamil emperor [[Raja Raja Chola I]] of the [[Chola empire]]) Indians to claim the two northern most atolls for the newly formed Maldivian kingdom. 
Koimala was succeeded by his nephew [[Dhovemi of the Maldives|Dhovemi Kalaminja]] in 1141.

{{for|the American rock band|Grateful Dead}}
'''Grateful dead'''  (or '''grateful ghost''') is a [[Folklore|folktale]] present in many cultures throughout the world. The most common story involves a traveler who encounters a corpse of someone who never received a proper [[burial]], typically stemming from an unpaid debt.&lt;ref name="encybrit"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9037771/grateful-dead#23476.hook|title=Grateful dead|accessdate=2007-12-14|year=2007|website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cscmu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mleone/gdead/faq/name.html|title=Dead FAQ: How did they get the name?|accessdate=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traveler then either pays off the dead person's debt or pays for burial. The traveler is later rewarded or has their life saved by a person or animal who is actually the soul of the dead person; the grateful dead is a form of the [[donor (fairy tale)|donor]].

The "grateful dead" story is [[Aarne–Thompson]]–Uther type 505.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0505.html|title=The Grateful Dead:  folktales of Aarne–Thompson–Uther type 505|author=D.L. Ashliman|accessdate=2008-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ancient Egyptian text explains the [[Golden Rule|principle of reciprocity]] in which the deceased calls for a blessing on the person who remembers his name and helps him into a happy afterlife:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But if there be a man, any one whomsoever, who beholdeth this writing and causeth my soul and my name to become established among those who are blessed, let it be done for him likewise after his final arriving (at the end of life's voyage) in recompense for what was done by him for me, Osiris.&lt;ref&gt;"The Burden of Isis, Being the Laments of Isis and Nephthys", James Teackle Dennis, Dutton &amp; Co, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Herzl paints Herzl''' is a series of exhibitions that ran from 1 October 2016 to 2018 in six locations across Europe and Israel. It was created by digital painter Israel Herzl, a fourth cousin of [[Theodor Herzl]]. He was joined by fellow Israeli artists Shai Yehezkeli, Yael Bar Tana, and [[Boaz Arad]].

The exhibition commemorated the 120th anniversary of the [[First Zionist Congress]] in [[Basel]], in 1897. Within eight years, Herzl had positioned [[Zionism]] as a world movement with institutions that led to the establishment of the [[State of Israel]].

The first exhibition opened in the [[Herzl Museum]] on [[Mount Herzl]] in Jerusalem on 1 October 2016. [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Foreign Ministry]] Director General [[Yuval Rotem]] heard about the exhibition at the Herzl Museum. He was deeply impressed and asked to present it in four other exhibitions under the sponsorship of the Foreign Ministry – in Jerusalem, Vienna, Geneva and Basel.

The exhibition was shown in the:

*Foreign Ministry Museum in Jerusalem in February 2017
*Atelierhaus der Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Vienna in May 2017
*Swiss Jewish Museum in Basel in August 2017, as part of the jubilee celebrations in Basel of the Zionist Congress that took place there in 1897

The last exhibition in Europe was at the [[University of Geneva]] in November 2017; in Israel, at [[Kfar Saba]] in January 2018.

Rotem said at the opening of the exhibition in the Foreign Ministry gallery: "The exhibition is unique in that it is dedicated to one personality, and the exhibition came to the Foreign Ministry after it was presented for the last three months at the Herzl Museum on Mount Herzl, after an extension due to its success. The exhibition was made available to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Israel Herzl, who combined his special skills in digital painting with his familiarity with the image of the state's dreamer".

Because the words of Berl Katznelson, the founder of Labor Zionism - "I have a fear that the next generation will know Herzl as a name, a slogan, a flag, or at most a fine legend" and the words of Amos Ayalon, Herzl's modern biographer - "In today's Israel, Herzl is at most the name of a street", the purpose of this exhibition was that no Jew will forget what the Israeli nation owes to Herzl and his dream.

The duration of the exhibitions was seven months. Over 5,000 visitors visited these exhibitions.

The '''Ihlara Valley''' (or '''Peristrema Valley'''; [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''Ihlara Vadisi'') is a canyon which is 15 km long and up to 150 m deep in the southwest of the [[Turkey|Turkish]] region of [[Cappadocia]], in the municipality of [[Güzelyurt]], [[Aksaray Province]]. The valley contains around 50 [[Monolithic church|rock-hewn churches]] and numerous [[Rock-cut architecture of Cappadocia|rock-cut buildings]].

== Development and location ==
[[File:IhlaraTalvonTreppe.jpg|thumb|View from the entry stairs]]
[[File:Map of Cappadocia.jpg|thumb|The Ihlara Valley and other noteworthy sites in Cappadocia]]
The canyon was formed in prehistoric times by the {{ill|Melendiz Çayı|de}}. It lies between the villages of [[Ihlara]] in the southeast and [[Selime]] in the northwest. At the north end of the village of Ihlara, there is a stairway with almost 400 steps, which descends over 100 m down into the canyon. From the 7th century AD, the valley was settled by Byzantine monks who dug their houses and churches out of the [[tuff]] stone, which had been deposited by the eruptions of [[Mount Hasan]]. The earlier [[Greek language|Greek name]], ''Peristrema'' (Περιστρημα; winding round) of the village of Belisarma which is located about halfway along the valley from Ihlara to Selime, gave its name to the valley as well.

== Churches ==
[[File:SümbüllüKilise.JPG|thumb|Facade of the Sümbüllü Kilise]]
The churches in the valley fall into two groups. The first consists of the churches near the village of Ihlara, which are decorated with paintings of a local Cappadocian type that show influence from Persia and Syria to the east. They mostly pre-date the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Iconoclasm]], but were often repainted in newer styles over time. The second group is located near the village of Belisarma and consists of churches in the Byzantine style of the tenth and eleventh centuries, known as [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|Macedonian art]]. 

The first group includes:
* Ağaçaltı Kilisesi ('Church under the Tree'): a [[cross-in-square]] church cut out of the cliff,  perhaps dating to the 7th century AD. The depiction of the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]] in its cupola pre-dates the Iconoclasm. 
* Yılanlı Kilise ('Snake Church'): another cross-in-square church with an unusually long [[apse]]. In the [[narthex]] there are scenes of Hell dating to the 9th century AD, and below them are four naked sinners in the grip of snake-like monsters - from which the church takes its modern name.
* Sümbüllü Kilise ('Hyacinth church'): possibly from the 10th century AD. The church has a T-shaped ground plan and belongs to the transition to the Macedonian style. The wall paintings include depictions of [[Constantine VII]] with his wife [[Helena Lekapene|Helena]]. On the other hand, the external facade shows eastern influences.

[[File:IhlaraTal.jpg|thumb|Church facade]]

The second group includes:
* Direkli Kilise ('Pillar church'). The cruciform [[nave]] church was created in the 10th century AD. The cupola is supported by four tall columns, which are decorated with portraits of saints. One of the few inscriptions in the valley reports the dedication of the church by the Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]] (r. 976-1025).
* Karagedik Kilisesi ('Church with the Black Gap'): a cross-in-square church with four pillars, which was built from bricks and [[trachyte]] blocks in the 11th century and has been almost entirely destroyed aside from some faded remains of paintings.
* Kırkdamaltı Kilisesi ('Church with forty roofs', also called 'St George's Church'). An inscription allows the church to be dated between 1283 and 1295, which makes it the last known example of Christian architecture in the Ihlara valley until the revival of church building by the [[Cappadocian Greeks]] in the 19th century. The church's paintings include depictions of [[St George]], a painting of the Byzantine consul Basileos Giagupes, who was also an [[Emir]] and is shown in [[Seljuk]] clothing with his wife Thamar, a [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n princess. The aforementioned inscription mentions both the Seljuk Sultan [[Mesud II]] and the Byzantine emperor [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]], a sign that at this date some kind of peaceful co-existence between Christians and Muslims was possible in Cappadocia. 

In the [[Niğde Archaeological Museum]], there is a display of the mummies of a woman and four children who were entombed in the Ihlara Valley in the 10th century AD. The [[Aksaray Museum]] also has mummies from the Ihlara valley.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6600">[[File:Keith Arnatt, 1970.jpg|thumb|Keith Arnatt c. 1970]] Keith Arnatt (1930–2008) was a British conceptual artist. As well as conceptual art his work is sometimes discussed in relation to land art, minimalism, and photography.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Wilson’s essay in the catalogue to the exhibition ‘Conceptual Art in Britain 1964-1979’, Tate, London, 2016, discusses Arnatt. Arnatt exhibited in the 2012 MOCA exhibition ‘Ends of the Earth, Land Art to 1974’. The curators Philipp Kaiser and Miwon Kwon relate Minimalism and Land Art in their introductory essay for the catalogue. See also Anne Seymour’s essay in ‘The New Art’, 1972 (further details note 7). Ian Walker’s essay from the catalogue to Arnatt’s retrospective ‘Rubbish and Recollections’, The Photographers’ Gallery, London, 1989, discusses his use of the camera.&lt;/ref&gt; He lived and worked in London, Liverpool, Yorkshire and Monmouthshire.

==Life and work==
Arnatt  was born in Oxford.

He had studied painting at Oxford School of Art in the early 1950s and later at the Royal Academy Schools in London. From 1962 he taught at Liverpool and then, until 1969, Manchester. At this time he was living in and working from a farmhouse on the Yorkshire/Lancashire border. In 1969 he moved to Tintern in Monmouthshire. Liverpool (the beach at Formby); the moors around his farmhouse in Todmorden, Yorkshire; and his garden surrounded by woodland in Tintern, are settings for works.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, ''Liverpool Beach Burial'', 1968 http://www.keitharnatt.com/works/w18.html
‘Situations’ on the Yorkshire Moors 1967-68 http://www.keitharnatt.com/works/w01.html
''Self-Burial'', 1969, http://www.keitharnatt.com/works/w20.html&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 1960s Arnatt’s work was associated with the new conceptual art movement. A number of writers connected conceptual art with a general reductionist tendency in contemporary art of the time using phrases like ‘dematerialization’&lt;ref&gt;For instance in Lucy Lippard’s, ‘Six years: the dematerialization of the art object from 1966 to 1972’. Praeger, New York. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; and referring to the influence of minimalism and in particular the influence of Robert Morris in relating the presentation of art objects to the contexts of their viewing in a way that sought to activate those contexts.&lt;ref&gt;See Anne Seymour’s reference to Robert Morris’s use of mirrors in connection with Arnatt’s work in ‘The New Art’ catalogue, Hayward Gallery, London, 1972, p66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnatt took part in a number of influential exhibitions of conceptual art including 'Konzeption-Conception, Städtichen Museum, Leverkusen', 1969; 'Information', MoMA, New York, 1970; 'Umwelt-Akzente / Die Expansion der Kunst', Kunstkreis Monschau, 1970 and 'Art as Idea in England', CAYC (Centro de Arte y Comunicación), Buenos Aires, 1971.

Some works from this period, including ''Self-Burial'' in the version documenting the WDR televised ''Self-Burial (Television Interference Project)'' (1969), and ''Trouser-Word Piece'' (1972-89 version) are held in the Tate collection.&lt;ref&gt;Self-Burial (Television Interference Project) (1969) and Trouser-Word Piece (1972-89 version), see Tate collection http://www.tate.org.uk/search?type=artwork&amp;q=keith+arnatt+art+works&lt;/ref&gt; MoMA, New York has an Art + Project authorised time slice of the work ''1220400 - 0000000'' (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Art + Project, MoMA, New York https://www.moma.org/collection/works/109508&lt;/ref&gt; The Henry Moore Institute&lt;ref&gt;The archive of the Henry Moore Institute has slides of early works. Leeds City Art Gallery holds drawings from the early 1960s. Jon Wood’s catalogue to ‘Box, Body, Burial’, the Henry Moore Institute, Leeds, 2009, refers to and illustrates these.&lt;/ref&gt; in Yorkshire holds examples of early materials and the V&amp;A Museum&lt;ref&gt;V&amp;A collection, London https://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/photographs&lt;/ref&gt; has examples of proposals. Some materials that Arnatt gave to Robert Smithson in the form of documentation of proposals were donated to LACMA, Los Angeles by Nancy Holt.&lt;ref&gt;LACMA, Los Angeles https://collections.lacma.org/node/169107&lt;/ref&gt; Tate Archive has material relating to proposals by the artist including correspondence with the writer Barbara Reise. Other works, for example ''I have decided to go to the Tate Gallery next Friday'' (1971),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.keitharnatt.com/img/works/l/I_have_decided.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Art and Egocentricity – A Perlocutionary Act?'' (1971)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.keitharnatt.com/img/works/l/ArtandEgocentricity.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; were visual/textual hybrids and were intended to be realised in specific circumstances.

From the mid 1970s onwards ''The Visitors'' (1974-6), ''Walking the Dog'' (1976-9), ''Gardeners'' (1978-9), ''A.O.N.B.'' (1982-5)&lt;ref&gt;''The Visitors'' (1974-6) shown in ‘Time, Words and the Camera: Photoworks by British Artists’, Kunstlerhaus, Graz, Oct 10–Nov 07 1976, and ‘Arte inglese oggi 1960–1976 / English Art Today 1960–1976’, Pilazzo Reale, Milan, Feb 26–May 16 1976. ''Walking the Dog'' (1976-9) and ''Gardeners'' (1978-9) were shown at Anthony d’Offay, London, Nov 21–Dec 21 1979. ''A.O.N.B.'' (1982-5), ''Miss Grace's Lane'' (1986-7) and ''Howler's Hill'' (1987-8) at Keith Arnatt ‘Rubbish and Recollections’, The Photographers’ Gallery, London, Jun 02–Jul 15 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and series such as ''Miss Grace's Lane'' (1986-7) and ''Howler's Hill'' (1987-8) make directly realist evidential references in their uses of settings. Here, where Arnatt was using the camera in a first-order way and there has been some theorising over the extent of his influence on contemporary photographic practice, there still remains an overriding continuity in the form of analytic and self-disclosing interests in his work.&lt;ref&gt;Arnatt was consistently ironic in references to photography&lt;/ref&gt; In late series like ''Painter’s Cans'' (1990), ''Notes from Jo'' (1991-95), and ''Labels Borrowed/Stolen'' (1993-95)&lt;ref&gt;Notes from Jo (1991-95), and Labels Borrowed/Stolen (1993-95) recently shown at Sprüth Magers, ‘Notes’, September 14 to November 02 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Arnatt continued to investigate objects with something very close to the type of manipulative detachment originally shown in early works.

'''''Leadville''''' is a book by English writer [[Edward Platt (author)|Edward Platt]], published in 2000 by [[Picador (imprint)|Picador]]. It won both the [[John Llewellyn Rhys Prize]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.booktrust.org.uk/jlr-archive Booktrust - John Llewellyn Prize archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401030033/http://www.booktrust.org.uk/jlr-archive |date=2012-04-01 }} Retrieved 2015-04-16.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Somerset Maugham Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.societyofauthors.org/somerset-maugham-past-winners Somerset Maugham Past Winners | Society of Authors] Retrieved 2015-04-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge History of Science lecturer [[Patricia Fara]] selected it as one of her books of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/editorial/browse/books_of_the_decade/index_2.jsp Blackwell's Books of the Decade] Retrieved 2015-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subtitled "A Biography of the [[A40 road|A40]]" and with the strapline "A Journey from [[White City, London|White City]] to the [[Hangar Lane Gyratory]]" it tells the story of [[Western Avenue (London)|Western Avenue]], an [[arterial road]] in West [[London]] primarily through the words of its residents whom the author visited between 1995 and 1998. At this time many of the houses on the road were being [[Compulsory purchase in England and Wales|compulsorily purchased]] and demolished in preparation for a road widening scheme which was later cancelled. Interspersed with the views of the residents are historical accounts of the road's development and wider views on town planning and traffic management, prominently those of [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Robert Moses]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10802">[[File:Lucia Joyce dancing at Bullier Ball - Paris, May 1929.jpg|thumb|Lucia Joyce dancing at Bullier Ball – Paris, May 1929]]
'''Lucia Anna Joyce''' (26 July 1907, [[Trieste]] – 12 December 1982, [[Northampton]]) was a professional dancer and the daughter of Irish writer [[James Joyce]] and [[Nora Barnacle]]. Once treated by Swiss psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]], Joyce was diagnosed as schizophrenic in the mid 1930s and institutionalized at the [[Burghölzli]] psychiatric clinic in [[Zurich]]. In 1951, Joyce was transferred to [[St Andrew's Hospital]] in Northampton, where she remained until her death in 1982.

==Early life and career==
Lucia Anna Joyce was born in the Ospedale Civico di Trieste on 26 July 1907. She was the second child of Irish writer [[James Joyce]] and his partner (later wife) [[Nora Barnacle]], after her brother Giorgio. Her parents being expatriates living in [[Trieste]], Lucia's first language was Italian. In her younger years, she trained as a dancer at the Dalcroze Institute in Paris. Joyce studied dancing from 1925 to 1929, training first with Jacques Dalcroze, followed by [[Margaret Morris (dancer)|Margaret Morris]] (granddaughter of [[William Morris]]), and later with [[Raymond Duncan]] (brother of [[Isadora Duncan]]) at his school near Salzburg.[2] In 1927, she danced a short duet as a toy soldier in [[Jean Renoir]]’s film adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's "La Petite marchande d’allumettes" (The Little Match Girl). She furthered her studies under Lois Hutton, Hélène Vanel, and Jean Borlin, lead dancer of the Ballet suédois.&lt;ref&gt;Shloss, Carol (2003). ''Lucia Joyce: To Dance in the Wake'', New York: Farrar, Straus and Girous, 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, she joined "Les Six de rythme et couleur," a commune of six female dancers that were soon performing at venues in France, Austria, and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Le Bihan, Adrien (2011). ''James Joyce travesti par trois clercs parisiens'', Paris: Cherche Bruit, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; After a performance in La Princesse Primitive at the Vieux-Colombier theatre,  the ''Paris Times'' wrote of her,  "Lucia Joyce is her father’s daughter. She has James Joyce’s enthusiasm, energy, and a not-yet-determined amount of his genius. When she reaches her full capacity for rhythmic dancing, James Joyce may yet be known as his daughter’s father."[5] &lt;ref&gt;Shloss, 6&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 May 1929, she was chosen as one of six finalists in the first international festival of dance in Paris held at the [[Bal Bullier]]. Although she did not win, the audience, which included her father and the young [[Samuel Beckett]], championed her performance as outstanding and loudly protested the jury’s verdict.&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson, James (1996). ''Damned to Fame: the Life of Samuel Beckett'', London: Bloomsbury, 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt; Her relationship with [[Samuel Beckett]] was one of unrequited affection. Allegedly, when Lucia was 21, she and Beckett, who was her father's secretary for a short time, became lovers. Their relationship lasted only a short while and ended after Beckett, who was involved with another woman at the time, admitted he was solely interested in having a professional relationship with James Joyce.&lt;ref&gt;Shloss, 127&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 22, Joyce, after years of rigorous dedication and long hours of practice, decided "she was not physically strong enough to be a dancer of any kind".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/12/08/a-fire-in-the-brain A Fire in the Brain]: The difficulties of being James Joyce’s daughter&lt;/ref&gt; Announcing she would become a teacher, she then "turned down an offer to join a group in [[Darmstadt]] and effectively gave up dancing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://arlindo-correia.com/lucia_joyce.html Brenda Maddox, ''A Mania for Insects''], review of Carol Shloss’s biography, ''Lucia Joyce, To Dance in the Wake''&lt;/ref&gt;

Her biographer Carol Shloss, however, argues that it was her father who finally put an end to her dancing career. James reasoned that the intense physical training for ballet caused her undue stress which in turn exacerbated the long-standing animosity between her and her mother Nora. The resulting incessant domestic squabbles prevented work on ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''. James convinced her she should turn to drawing [[Initial|lettrines]] to illustrate his prose and forgo her deep-seated artistic inclinations.&lt;ref&gt;Shloss's argument summarized in Le Bihan, 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; To his patron [[Harriet Shaw Weaver]], James Joyce wrote that this resulted in "a month of tears as she thinks she has thrown away three or four years of hard work and is sacrificing a talent".&lt;ref&gt;[http://arlindo-correia.com/lucia_joyce.html Brenda Maddox, ''A Mania for Insects'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mental illness and later life ==
Joyce started to show signs of [[mental illness]] in 1930, a year after she began casually dating the 23-year-old [[Samuel Beckett]], then a junior lecturer in English at the [[Ecole normale supérieure]] in Paris. In May 1930, while her parents were in Zurich, she invited Beckett to dinner, hoping "to press him into some kind of declaration."&lt;ref&gt;Bowker, 400.&lt;/ref&gt; He flatly rejected her, explaining that he was only interested in her father and his writing. In his biography of James Joyce, Gordon Bowker argues that the underlying reasons for the rejection were Beckett's keen awareness of the "strong unfulfilled erotic bond between Lucia and her father" and her need to find "a genius father-substitute", together with "her predilection for unprotected sex."&lt;ref&gt;Bowker, 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1934, she had participated in several failed affairs, with her drawing teacher [[Alexander Calder]], another expatriate artist Albert Hubbell, and Myrsine Moschos, assistant to [[Sylvia Beach]] of [[Shakespeare and Company (bookstore)|Shakespeare and Company]]. As the year wore on, her condition had deteriorated to the point that James had [[Carl Gustav Jung]] take her in as a patient. Soon after, she was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]] at the [[Burghölzli]] psychiatric clinic in [[Zurich]]. In 1936, James consented to have his daughter undergo blood tests at [[St Andrew's Hospital]] in Northampton. After a short stay, Lucia Joyce insisted she return to Paris, the doctors explaining to her father that she could not be prevented from doing so unless he had her committed. James told his closest friends that "he would never agree to his daughter being incarcerated among the English."&lt;ref&gt;Bowker, 482.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucia Joyce returned to stay with [[Maria Jolas]], the wife of ''[[transition (literary journal)|transition]]'' editor [[Eugene Jolas]], in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]]. After three weeks, her condition worsened and she was taken away in a [[straitjacket]] to the Maison de Santé Velpeau in [[Vésinet]]. Considered a danger to both staff and inmates, she was left in isolation. Two months later, she entered the ''maison de santé'' of François Achille Delmas at [[Ivry-sur-Seine]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowker, 482.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Joyce was again transferred to St Andrew's Hospital. Over the years, she received visits from Beckett, [[Sylvia Beach]], [[Frank Budgen]], Maria Jolas, and Harriet Shaw Weaver who acted as her guardian. In 1962, Beckett donated his share of the royalties from his 1929 contributory essay on ''Finnegans Wake'' in ''[[Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress]]'' to help pay for her confinement at St Andrew's.&lt;ref&gt;Bair, Deirdre (1980). ''Samuel Beckett: A Biography'', London: Picador, 451.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Joyce suffered a stroke and died on 12 December of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beja|first1=Morris|title=James Joyce: A Literary Life|date=1992|publisher=Ohio State University Press|location=Columbus, Ohio|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is buried in [[Kingsthorpe]] Cemetery.

== Legacy ==
Her mental state, and documentation related to it, is the subject of a 2003 study by Carol Shloss who believes Lucia Joyce to have been her father's [[muse]] for ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''. Making heavy reference to the letters between Joyce and her father, the study became the subject of a [[copyright misuse]] suit by the James Joyce estate. On 25 March 2007, this litigation was resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6493095.stm Joyce letters court case settled].

First Amendment Center/Associated Press, 2007-03-27.{{Dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Joyce's life was the subject of ''Calico'', a West End play written by [[Michael Hastings (playwright)|Michael Hastings]], and of the 2012 graphic novel ''[[Dotter of Her Father's Eyes]]'' by Bryan and Mary M. Talbot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rachel |last=Cooke |title=Dotter of Her Father's Eyes by Mary M Talbot and Bryan Talbot – review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/27/dotter-fathers-eyes-talbot-james-joyce |work=The Guardian |date=27 January 2012 |accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another play exploring her life titled ''L'' was performed to a limited audience in Concord Academy from April 14–16, 2016. It was written and directed by Sophia Ginzburg.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.concordacademy.org/news/detail/index.aspx?LinkId=5507&amp;ModuleId=280,485{{Dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, she was the subject of a biographical novel, ''The Joyce Girl'' by [[Annabel Abbs]], which was published in the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand and translated into German, Spanish and Turkish. She is the protagonist of the "Round the Bend" chapter of [[Alan Moore]]'s 2016 novel ''Jerusalem''; set at the Northampton clinic where she spent her final years, the chapter is written in the style of her father's ''Finnegans Wake''.

'''Maashaus''' ({{lang-de|Maßhaus}}) is a spacious room taking the whole front part of a ground floor of a multi-storied [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] or [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] town house.

This room was used mainly for serving beer, or other kinds of trade and craft. It was not heated. It also worked to link together other parts of the house, since it held a staircase to the first floor above ground (where the owner lived) and to the basement, an archway or similar passage to the courtyard and so on. The ceiling was almost always [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] and was often supported by an asymmetrically placed central [[column]]. It was separated from the street or the arcade by a wall with a doorway and one or more windows.

==Origins==

Maashauses started to appear in the 13th century as a manifestation of the trend to sequester the living quarters of a burgers' house to the first floor. What used to be a main living room of the house, the so-called smoke abode, kept only its public, trade and craft functions, which remained on the ground floor, because they required the proximity of the cellar, the courtyard and especially the street entrance. The trade activities involved mainly the aforementioned serving of beer, which is related to the [[brewing right]]s (in the [[Middle Ages]] a vast majority of burgers' houses were granted this right), but other trade and crafts were performed there also.

==Maashauses in Bohemia==

In the 19th century most maashauses were converted to private shops. Later, they were being renovated in many historic cities as part of restoration activities in the [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948–89)|socialist period]]. To this day, maashauses are found in many buildings in the centers of [[Český Krumlov|Česky Krumlov]], [[Slavonice]] and so on. After 1989 many maashauses were again employed for retail or by pubs and restaurants.

==Etymology==
"[[Maß]]“ is  an old unit of volume (approximately equivalent to 1.4 [[Litre|l]]), used for measuring mainly [[beer]], ''haus'' means a "house“ in German, but in the past it could also stand for the main living room of a house. Therefore, maashaus could be translated as a "beer house".

'''''Madonna: Truth or Dare''''' (known as '''''In Bed with Madonna''''' outside of North America) is a 1991 American [[documentary film]] chronicling the life of [[United States|American]] singer and songwriter [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] during her 1990 [[Blond Ambition World Tour]]. The film was generally well received by critics and was successful at the box office with a worldwide gross of $29,012,935 (an estimated ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|29|r=2|1991}}}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). It remained the highest-grossing documentary of all time, until ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'' surpassed it in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jan/03/entertainment/et-munoz3/2&lt;/ref&gt; It was screened out of competition at the [[1991 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/94/year/1991.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Truth or Dare |accessdate=2009-08-12|publisher=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Madonna produced another documentary, ''[[I'm Going to Tell You a Secret]]'', which followed her 2004 [[Re-Invention World Tour]]. It was filmed and narrated in the same style as ''Truth or Dare'', with stage performances filmed in colour and behind-the-scenes in black and white. ''Truth or Dare'' was nominated for a [[Razzie Award]] for Worst Actress for Madonna as herself, which she lost to [[Sean Young]] for ''[[A Kiss Before Dying (1991 film)|A Kiss Before Dying]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=John|title=The Official Razzie Movie Guide: Enjoying the Best of Hollywood's Worst |year=2005|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|isbn=0-446-69334-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It holds an 84% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 25 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/madonna_truth_or_dare/|title=Madonna: Truth or Dare|work=rottentomatoes.com|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{Long plot|film|date=August 2018}}
The film begins on August 6, 1990, the day after the final show of the [[Blond Ambition Tour]] in [[Nice]]. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] cleans up her hotel room while, in a [[voice-over]], she explains that she is not as emotional as the rest of her group over the end of the tour. She has already grieved, she says, but it will hit her later and she hopes she will be in a safe place when it happens.

In a flashback to April 1990, the tour is about to kick off in Japan. Everything is a mess; there are sound problems and Madonna did not realize that the tour is during the [[rainy season]] in Japan. Because it is cold and wet, Madonna and the dancers scrap their costumes for warmer attire. In a voice-over, Madonna confesses that the only thing keeping her from "slashing my wrists" is the thought of returning to [[North America]] and performing the show as it is meant to be. In America, Madonna meets the families of her dancers. One dancer, Oliver, sees his father for the first time in several years, while Madonna talks with her father, Silvio "Tony" Ciccone, on the phone. Though she insists that she can get him tickets, he is reluctant to impose.

The Blond Ambition tour stops in [[Los Angeles]], where sound problems abound. Despite reassurances, Madonna focuses on the technical problems and yells at her manager, [[Freddy DeMann]], for allowing so many people from the music industry, who appeared bored by her performance, in the front rows.  Though then-boyfriend [[Warren Beatty]] tries to console her, he is distracted by the cameras and walks away laughing. Madonna parties with several celebrities, including ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'' co-stars [[Al Pacino]] and [[Mandy Patinkin]], and [[Olivia Newton-John]]. [[Kevin Costner]] offends Madonna by calling her show "neat". Madonna pretends to gag after he leaves. Despite the lively atmosphere, Beatty still seems bothered by the cameras' presence.

During her stay in Washington, D.C., Madonna attends the premiere of ''Dick Tracy'' with Beatty, with whom she co-starred. In another voice-over, she describes a dream that she had the night before: [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] came to her show and she thought about how jealous Beatty would be that she met him first. She declares it "a good dream".

On the final night of the show in [[Toronto]], Madonna is informed that [[Undercover operation#Plainclothes law enforcement|plainclothes]] officers are prepared to arrest her if she performs the simulated [[masturbation]] scene at the end of "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]". Madonna refuses to change her show, stating, "Last time I was on tour, [[Sean Penn|Sean]] [Penn] was in jail. I guess it's my turn." Freddy DeMann bets that the threat of arrest will only make Madonna go further and no one takes his bet. According to a news report, Toronto police decide not to arrest the singer, claiming that no threats were made.

The Blond Ambition tour goes to Madonna's hometown of [[Detroit]].  In a voice-over, Madonna expresses the difficulty she has going back home, especially since fame seems to change one's loved ones. At the end of "[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]", Madonna calls her father on stage and sings "[[Happy Birthday to You]]". Backstage, Tony and his wife, Joan, compliment Madonna (and Christopher) on the show, though Tony expresses his displeasure at some of the more "burlesque" aspects. Madonna and Christopher wait for their older brother, Martin, to show up while they discuss his substance abuse problems. By the time Martin arrives, Christopher has left and Madonna has gone to bed.

Madonna reunites with her "childhood idol", Moira McFarland-Messana. Moira gives Madonna a painting she made entitled "Madonna and Child", and asks Madonna to be the godmother to her unborn child. Before leaving Detroit, Madonna visits her mother's grave as "Promise to Try" plays in the background. It is the first time she has visited her mother's grave since she was a little girl. Madonna lies down beside her mother's grave as Christopher watches and Madonna whispers that, "I'm going to fit in right here. They're going to bury me sideways."

As the tour continues, Madonna's throat problems worsen while Beatty becomes more fed up with the cameras. During a throat examination in Madonna's hotel room, Beatty chastises her for the documentary, telling her the atmosphere is driving everyone insane. Madonna ignores Beatty, and when she declines to have the rest of her examination done off camera, Beatty starts laughing, saying, "She doesn't want to live off-camera, much less talk... What point is there of existing off-camera?"

Due to Madonna's throat problems she cancels some of her shows. In [[New York City|New York]], Madonna's doctor instructs her not to talk and she finds herself isolated in her apartment with only her assistant, Melissa Crowe, as contact to the outside world. Everything seems to fall apart and she loses contact with the dancers. ''[[Star (magazine)|Star]]'' reports that Madonna dumped Beatty for one of her dancers, Oliver Crumes. The other dancers torment him and Madonna chastises them. Sharon Gault, a make-up artist, is drugged and [[sodomy|sodomized]] while partying. In a prayer circle before the final show in New York, Madonna attempts to pull everyone back together.

The third leg of the tour kicks off in [[Europe]] with everyone in better spirits. Madonna and the dancers visit [[Chanel]] in [[Paris]], fool around at Melissa's birthday party and imitate Madonna's 1984 "Like a Virgin" music video. As the tour nears Italy, the [[Pope]] attempts to have it banned, forcing Madonna to cancel two shows. [[Sandra Bernhard]] appears to cheer up Madonna. Sandra asks who would really blow her away if she could meet them and Madonna replies, "God, I think I've met everybody... oh, except that guy who's in all of [[Pedro Almodóvar]]'s films—[[Antonio Banderas]]." When Almodóvar throws a party in [[Madrid]] and invites the future ''[[Evita (1996 film)|Evita]]'' co-stars, Madonna spends a week thinking up ways to seduce Banderas. It turns out that he is married, ending Madonna's two-year crush.

While Madonna works in her hotel room, voice-overs from her family, friends, and co-workers describe the star. Though she is happier now than she was on her [[Who's That Girl Tour|last tour]], Sandra Bernhard does not think that she takes enough time to enjoy her successes. Others describe her in unflattering terms. Luis Camacho says, "I just feel like she's a little girl lost in the storm sometimes. You know, there's just a whole whirlwind of things going on around her, and sometimes she gets caught up in it." As the tour winds down, the group plays a game of [[Truth or Dare?]] and Madonna is dared to perform [[Fellatio]] on a glass bottle. Madonna is asked, "Who has been the love of your life for your whole life??" Madonna replies without hesitation, "[[Sean Penn|Sean]]. Sean." Madonna invites her dancers, and backup singers, one-by-one, to join her in bed, where she imparts words of wisdom to each.

While the show's closing act, "[[Keep It Together (Madonna song)|Keep It Together]]", plays, a montage of Madonna saying good-bye to her dancers is shown. The film ends with a clip of Madonna telling director [[Alek Keshishian]] to go away and, "Cut it, Alek! Cut it, Goddamnit!"

==History==
The title of the documentary is in reference to the party game [[Truth or Dare?]] Outside [[North America]] the documentary title was changed by [[Miramax]] Films to ''In Bed with Madonna'', due to the game being relatively unknown in other countries. Madonna has commented in various interviews that she hates the title of ''In Bed with Madonna''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |subject=Madonna |subjectlink=Madonna (entertainer) |interviewer=[[Dermot O'Leary]] |title=Confessions of Madonna |publisher=[[Channel 4]] |location=London |date=November 27, 2005 |quote= [...] as a kind of sequel to ''Truth or Dare'' or I think it was called ''In Bed with Madonna'', which is a really naff title. It wasn't my idea.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original working title of the documentary was ''"Truth or Dare: On the Road, Behind the Scenes and In Bed with Madonna"''.

During the summer of 1990, Madonna hired director [[Alek Keshishian]] to film backstage and onstage footage of her [[Blond Ambition World Tour]]. The entire documentary is filmed in [[black-and-white]], except for onstage sequences which are in full color. There are appearances from celebrities such as [[Al Pacino]], [[Mandy Patinkin]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Antonio Banderas]], [[Sandra Bernhard]], [[Kevin Costner]], and [[Warren Beatty]], whom she was dating at the time.

Concert video footage was shot at [[Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy|Bercy]] in [[Paris]], [[France]], in July 1990. In the "[[Express Yourself (Madonna song)|Express Yourself]]" concert sequence, Madonna says "All right, America! Do you believe in love?" This audio is overdubbed from a US date onto footage shot in Paris where she does not wear the ponytail as in the Japan and USA stops.

==In popular media==
To promote the just-released film, Madonna made a guest appearance in a pre-filmed segment on the May 11, 1991 episode of the sketch-comedy show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

During a ''[[Wayne's World]]'' sketch, Wayne ([[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]]) and Garth ([[Dana Carvey]]) encounter a seductive Madonna lying on a bed in a hotel room during a dream fantasy sequence (filmed in black and white). After some back-and-forth banter, Wayne and Madonna play [[Truth or Dare]]. Wayne dares Madonna to make out with him. As they kiss, the music for her controversial 1990 video "[[Justify My Love]]" begins to play. Garth is then seen dancing in a parody of the video before being abducted by two women in fetish-wear outfits.

The [[parody]], ''[[Medusa: Dare to Be Truthful]]'', stars comedian [[Julie Brown]] as the title character, with [[Kathy Griffin]] and [[Donal Logue]] in supporting roles. Brown plays [[Medusa]], a controlling, hyper-sexual blonde bombshell who has allowed a documentary crew to follow her on her "Blonde Leading the Blonde Tour". The film, originally produced as a one-hour [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] television special, goes to great pains to recreate costumes, sets, and situations that occurred in the original documentary.

Rock group [[Medusa (band)|Medusa]] released the documentary "In Bed with Medusa" in 2013.&lt;ref name="In Bed with Medusa"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2756008/] In Bed with Medusa (2013) IMDb IMDb.com. Retrieved 2013-04-01&lt;/ref&gt; The film uses the same black and white style along with many further references as it simultaneously parodies the film and documents the early life of the band as they release 2 albums and hit the headlines in the UK.

In addition, the popular British television comedy programme ''[[French &amp; Saunders]]'' did a highly regarded parody of the film with both stars playing Madonna in tandem, a unique concept, which was called "In Bed with French &amp; Saunders". Madonna herself was widely reported to be delighted with the long skit, saying that when French &amp; Saunders did a parody of anything, it was proof that it had "arrived".

In 2016, ''[[Strike a Pose]]'', a documentary about the life and career of Madonna's dancers over 20 years after the [[Blond Ambition World Tour]], was released. They look back on the impact of that tour and tour film on people's lives, and what was happening in the background on emotional levels.

==Lawsuit==
On January 21, 1992, three of the Blond Ambition dancers, Oliver Crumes, [[Kevin Stea]], and Gabriel Trupin, filed a lawsuit against Madonna. The suit claimed that the singer had invaded her dancers' privacy during the filming of ''Truth or Dare'', as well as charging her with fraud and deceit, intentional misrepresentation, suppression of fact, and intentional infliction of emotional distress for displaying the men's private lives in the documentary.

In a commercial for MTV's [[Rock the Vote]] campaign later that year, Madonna joked about the lawsuit, saying, "You're probably thinking that's not a very good reason to vote... So sue me!  Everybody else does." In October 1994, after more than two years of litigation, the suit was withdrawn and an undisclosed settlement was reached.&lt;ref name="Hartford Courant, ib id"&gt;[http://articles.courant.com/1994-10-02/entertainment/9409300079_1_madonna-gabriel-trupin-oliver-crumesaid=380&amp;category=Hartford Courant] Dancers Settle Suit Against Madonna, October 02, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions on showing gay people ==
Madonna's dancers for the tour, who were almost all gay, and showed their homosexual identity in the tour film (encouraged by Madonna to be and 'express themselves'), received numerous comments, messages and letters from fans to whom this freedom meant a great deal as role models and inspiration to live their own sexual identity. This impact was mentioned in the 2016 documentary [[Strike a Pose]].

During media interviews for ''Strike a Pose'', a documentary about Madonna's dancers from the Blond Ambition tour, and featured in this film, Oliver Crumes frequently expressed regret for his homophobic comments in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cswap.com/1991/Madonna:_Truth_or_Dare/cap/en/25fps/a/01_40|title=Madonna: Truth or Dare - 01:40|website=www.cswap.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://squaremadonna.com/2016/04/07/oliver-crumes-the-tour-taught-me-to-appreciate-gay-people/|title=OLIVER CRUMES : ‘THE TOUR TAUGHT ME TO APPRECIATE GAY PEOPLE’|date=2016-04-07|website=squaremadonna|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/entertainment/strike+pose+revisits+madonnas+blond+ambition+tour+dancers/13075428/story.html|title=Q&amp;A: 'Strike a Pose' doc revisits Madonna's Blond Ambition tour dancers|last=Friend|first=David|date=March 9, 2017|work=Calgary Herald/The Canadian Press|access-date=March 10, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I have come to see we are all human beings, who have emotions, hearts and feelings.

He would repeat similar comments against violence towards people in the LGBTQ community in other interviews, and emphasize that his outlook has changed since the tour.

Since the refurbishment of the [[art gallery]], MAFA has endeavoured to maintain its profile by presenting [[art exhibition|exhibitions]] of [[painting]], [[Printmaking|prints]], [[drawing]]s and [[sculpture]] in venues in [[Manchester]] and throughout [[North West England]].

The society has been associated with a number of notable individuals, including [[Alfred Waterhouse]], [[Ford Madox Brown]], [[LS Lowry]], [[Käthe Schuftan]], [[Norman Adams (British artist)|Norman Adams]] and Anne Redpath. Past presidents include the artists [[William Knight Keeling]], [[Charles Oppenheimer]] and [[Robert Crozier (artist)|Robert Crozier]].&lt;ref name=MAFA&gt;[http://www.mafa.org.uk/past_presidents.php "History of Mafa: Past Presidents"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302044715/http://www.mafa.org.uk/past_presidents.php |date=2016-03-02 }}, ''Manchester Academy of Fine Arts'' website, accessed 11 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Academy members have played a significant role in the Manchester art scene for over a century, including the design of several of its buildings and public works.

==Membership==

The academy consists of more than 100 elected members who are mainly professional artists practising not only in the North West of England but throughout the United Kingdom and in Europe. The objective of the academy is to promote the work of its members and other artists by organising exhibitions, workshops and talks.

In 2009–2010, MAFA celebrated its 150th anniversary through a series of exhibitions and a service at [[Manchester Cathedral]] in November 2009.

'''Max Kalish''' (March 1, 1891 – 1945) was American sculptor born in [[Valozhyn]], [[Belarus]], and best known for his sculptures of laborers. 

His Orthodox Jewish family emigrated to Cleveland, Ohio in 1893, when he was two years old.&lt;ref&gt;http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artist/?id=2534&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied with [[Herman Matzen]] at the [[Cleveland School of Art]]; in New York City with [[Herbert Adams (sculptor)|Herbert Adams]] at the National Academy of Design, and in the studios of [[Alexander Stirling Calder]] and [[Isidore Konti]]; and in Paris with [[Paul Wayland Bartlett]] at the Académie Colorossi, and [[Jean Antoine Injalbert]] at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;Opitz, Glenn B, editor, ''Mantle Fielding's Dictionary of American Painters, Sculptors &amp; Engravers'', Apollo Book, Poughkeepsie NY, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Who"&gt;McGlauflin, Alice Coe, editor, ''Who’s Who in American Art 1938-1939, vol. 2'', The American Federation of Arts, Washington D.C.,  1937&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artist/?id=2534&lt;/ref&gt;

His best known work is his 1932 statue of Abraham Lincoln in Cleveland, Ohio.

Washington, D.C. publisher Willard M. Kiplinger commissioned Kalish to create fifty portrait statuettes of prominent figures in World War II era politics, arts and sciences. Kiplinger donated the statuettes to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=14E616B32D504.1375&amp;profile=ariall&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;view=subscriptionsummary&amp;uri=full=3100001~!453060~!36&amp;ri=1&amp;aspect=Browse&amp;menu=search&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;staffonly=&amp;term=Kalish,+Max,+1891-1945,+sculptor.&amp;index=AUTHOR&amp;uindex=&amp;aspect=Browse&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=1 Walter Lippmann], from Smithsonian Institution.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalish was the author of ''Labor Sculpture'', largely a collection of photographs of his statues of workers.  Most of the works in the book are in a [[Social realism]] style. Critic Emily Genauer wrote in 1938, "It is the workmen who dominate the American scene, and who have become as surely symbolic of their time as the pioneers in covered wagons, and the robber barons and the great merchant princes were in there respective eras." This was what Kalish portrayed in his art.&lt;ref&gt;Kalish, Max, ''Labor Sculpture'', Introduction by Emily Genauer, New York,  1938, copyright by Max Kalish, introduction&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1939, Kalish lived in New York City and summered in Cleveland.&lt;ref name="Who"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4698">The '''Metropolitan Zoological Park and Museum District''' or '''ZMD''' is a cultural tax district in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis City]] and [[St. Louis County, Missouri]].  The district has five subdistricts, these being the [[St. Louis Art Museum]], [[St. Louis Zoo]], [[St. Louis Science Center]], [[Missouri History Museum]], and [[Missouri Botanical Garden]].  Of these, all but the Botanical Gardens are located in or near [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]].  The subsidies provided by the district ensures that the institutions are public non-profits with free admission for all, with the exception of the Botanical Gardens, which charges a nominal admission fee.

==History==
In the early 1960s, the St. Louis Art Museum and the St. Louis Zoo were both publicly funded by a tax in St. Louis City.  Zoo chairman [[Howard Baer]] and his successor, Circuit Judge [[Thomas F. McGuire]], worked with their supporters to secure the statute to establish the district.  H.B. 23 authorized a 1969 vote in St. Louis City and County, where voters approved the creation of the tax district to fund the Zoo and Art Museum at a rate of 8 cents for every $100 assessed.  The Science Center, which had previously received no tax benefit, was added at a rate of 4 cents for every $100 assessed.&lt;ref name=mzdstl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mzdstl.org/History.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125165028/http://www.mzdstl.org/History.htm |archivedate=2010-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Earl Wipfler]] was selected as the first Executive Director of the district in 1972, and he guided the initial creation of the district's budgeting and accounting procedures.  The [[Missouri Supreme Court]] approved them.&lt;ref name=mzdstl/&gt; Wipfler served as Executive Director until 1990.

The Missouri Botanical Garden was added as the district's fourth subdistrict in 1983, and the History Museum in 1988.&lt;ref name=mzdstl/&gt;

[[Olney F. Otto]] served as the district's second executive director from 1990 until his death in 2001.  [[Mr. J. Patrick Dougherty]] has served in the position since.&lt;ref name=mzdstl/&gt;

==Revenue==
From an initial annual revenue of $3.9 million in 1972, the district grew to $72 million in 2008.  In the past few years, around 85% of these funds have come from the county with the city providing only about 15%.  Though the tax is the same in both places, the disparity in income and population accounts for the difference in money generated.&lt;ref name=index&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mzdstl.org/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207114623/http://www.mzdstl.org/index.htm |archivedate=2009-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governing Board==
The eight-member governing board is composed of four appointments from St. Louis City, chosen by the mayor, and four from St. Louis County, chosen by the county executive.  The terms last four years, and two positions open up on January 1 each year, one for the city and one for the county.&lt;ref name=mzdstl/&gt;

==Criticism==
{{POV-section|date=February 2015}}
{{Unreferenced-section|date=November 2016}}
Through the government subsidy, all five subdistricts are able to operate without charging admission.  Some people have questioned whether tourists and residents of areas outside St. Louis City and St. Louis County should continue to be allowed free admission, and that it might be just to charge them, as they contribute nothing to the regional attractions. The exception to this is the Missouri Botanical Garden, which charges admission to non-residents of St. Louis City and County at double the rate of residents. Institutional and political efforts to persuade neighboring [[Jefferson County, Missouri|Jefferson]], [[St. Charles County, Missouri|St. Charles]] and other counties to pass tax levies to join the district (and contribute to operations of the regional attractions) have not been successful.  The issue of equity has come up intermittently throughout the district's history.

==Emulation==
The MZMD is one of the earliest, largest, and most successful cultural districts of its kind.  Other cities have created similar programs and tax districts based on the St. Louis model.&lt;ref name=index/&gt;

== History ==
NAWPA began in 1996 with Dr. William Wortman, humanities librarian, and John Allen Johnson, a Cherokee and African American graduate student researching Native American women playwrights at Miami University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/865063187|title=The Native American renaissance : literary imagination and achievement|others=Velie, Alan R., 1937-, Lee, A.

== Holdings ==
The Native American Women Playwrights Archive in the King Library's Walter Havighurst Special Collections of Miami University contains play manuscripts and other materials including audio and video recordings of performances (VHS tapes, audio cassettes, CDs, and DVDs), photographs, newspaper articles, reviews, flyers, and posters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The archive also holds administrative and financial documents, notes, forms, mailings lists, and correspondence pertaining to the management of the archive and sponsored conferences and events.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other holdings include documents relating to the work of Spiderwoman Theater, such as photographs of performances, play programs, interviews, and personal accounts from the members of the theater troupe. There are also documents regarding the legal dispute with Marvel Comics over the name "Spiderwoman."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

All the materials in NAWPA are open-access and available for anyone to read in the library. NAWPA continuously adds new playwrights and works to its collection. The archive encourages "playwrights at any level of development"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to submit their materials.

== Publications ==
In 2008, University of Michigan Press published ''Footpaths and Bridges: Voices from the Native American Women Playwrights Archive'', edited by Shirley A. Huston-Findley and Rebecca Howard. The anthology includes a number of scripts from NAWPA and critical commentary on the recurring themes in the plays.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other related publications include:

* ''Performing Worlds into Being: Native American Women's Theater'', edited by Ann Elizabeth Armstrong, Kelli Lyon Johnson, and William A. Wortman (2009)

Native works across the spectrum from automotive to consumer electronics, telecommunications and healthcare. The company is based in London and San Francisco and employs 200 staff.

== History and Work ==
Native Design was founded in 1997 by former Manager of Design at [[Bowers &amp; Wilkins]], [[Morten Villiers Warren]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bowers &amp; Wilkins|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowers_%26_Wilkins|website=Wikipedia|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morten designed the "Emphasis Speakers" on the cover of Art of Noise's "Below the Waste" album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Below the Waste|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Below_the_Waste|website=Wikipedia|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the success of their early work, the company developed a long-standing relationship &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nobuyuki|first1=Fu|title=Speaker Book 2017|date=2017|publisher=ONGAKU SHUPPAN-SHA|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and collaboration with Bowers &amp; Wilkins, designing earphones &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dowdy|first1=Clare|title=Design space: A more ergonomic earphone|url=https://www.ft.com/content/41f2efc6-c8fb-11e0-aed8-00144feabdc0|website=Financial Times|accessdate=20 June 2017}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Zeppelin iPod dock and loudspeaker &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ozler|first1=Levent|title=A Zeppelin in the Livingroom|url=https://www.dexigner.com/news/15623|website=Dexigner|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the PM1 loudspeaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bowers &amp; Wilkins PM1 - exclusive interview with designer Morten Warren|url=http://blog.bowers-wilkins.com/news/new-products/bowers-wilkins-pm1-exclusive-interview-with-designer-morten-warren/|website=Bowers &amp; Wilkins Blog|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morten is credited with being responsible for today's sleek, contemporary shape.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mrporter.com/journal/journal_issue115/9&lt;/ref&gt;

Working with the HP Design Team in 2014, Native created the [[Sprout (computer)|Sprout]], a touch screen computer with both vertical and horizontal screens, which "aims to help designers move between physical and digital platforms seamlessly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dawood|first1=Sarah|title=Hewlett Packard to launch dual-screen desktop computer|url=https://www.designweek.co.uk/hewlett-packard-to-launch-dual-screen-desktop-computer/|website=Design Week|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2015, HP's CEO [[Meg Whitman]] called for a unification across HP's GBUs and thus kick-started concept visioning with Native.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.danielhuang.com/Laserjet-Refresh&lt;/ref&gt;

Native was commissioned to create the new user experience and homepage for the BBC in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=Hannah|title=Morten Warren, Native Design|url=http://www.director.co.uk/morten-warren-native-design-headspace-21-april-2015/|website=Director|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coloplast employed Native to create the "Design DNA" in 2016, which won a Gold Lion at the Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oakes|first1=Omar|title=Google's wearable clothes idea wins Cannes Grand Prix for Product Design|url=http://www.campaignlive.com/article/googles-wearable-clothes-idea-wins-cannes-grand-prix-product-design/1399817|website=Campaign|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cannes Lions 2016 - Product Design Gold Lion for COLOPLAST DESIGN DNA|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFjItWPmSaY|website=Youtube|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gwynn|first1=Simon|title=UK companies lead nominations in Product Design Lions|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/uk-companies-lead-nominations-product-design-lions/1399262|website=Campaign|accessdate=20 June 2017}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation "has been so successful for Coloplast that it is now embedded in the culture of the company worldwide" and set a new standard for products that make independent living easier for people with intimate healthcare needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cheves|first1=Olivia|title=SHOREDITCH STUDIO WINS INTERNATIONAL ACCLAIM FOR INSPIRING DESIGNS|url=http://madeinshoreditch.co.uk/2015/10/16/shoreditch-studio-wins-international-acclaim-inspiring-designs/|website=Made in Shoreditch|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Forbes named the company as one of the "Top 25 Most Innovative Companies of 2016".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 25 Most Innovative Companies 2016|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/elem45igi/no-22-coloplast/#49bc59326dbe|website=Forbes|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native was recently honoured with the International Design Excellence Gold Award&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.idsa.org/awards/idea/digital-interaction/definitive-autonomous-car-experience|title=The Definitive Autonomous Car Experience|last=IDSA|first=|date=24 September 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its work with the [[Ford Motor Company]] on the creation of their future car experience known as the [[Self-driving car|Autonomous Vehicle]] Simulator (AVS). It was created in response to global research and identifies the digital &amp; physical experiences that people want when they no longer need to drive. AVS is a demonstration platform that reimagines transportation choice and business models beyond the [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbc-2.com/story/39159419/native-design-honored-with-international-design-excellence-gold-award|title=Native Design Honored With International Design Excellence Gold Award|last=|first=|date=24 September 2018|work=NBC 2|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work generated hundreds of new patents for Ford&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Awards and recognition ==
The company was the first British design company to win both Gold and Best in Show at the IDSA International Design Excellence Awards (IDEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Morten Warren, I/IDSA|url=http://www.idsa.org/members/morten-warren|website=IDSA|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information (NNPI)''' is a category of [[intellectual capital]] defined by the [[United States Navy]] to be "classified or unclassified information concerning the design, arrangement, development, manufacture, testing, operation, administration, training, maintenance, and repair of the propulsion plants of naval nuclear-powered ships and prototypes, including the associated shipboard and shore-based nuclear support facilities.." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|url=http://doni.daps.dla.mil/Directives/09000%20General%20Ship%20Design%20and%20Support/09-200%20Propulsion%20Plants%20Support/N9210.3%20(Unclas%20Portion).pdf
|title=OPNAVINST N9210.3, SAFEGUARDING OF NAVAL NUCLEAR PROPULSION INFORMATION (NNPI), 6/7/2010, Unclassified Portion, page 1-1, Definition|accessdate=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all NNPI is [[classified information]].  While most NNPI is sensitive, the Navy recognizes that the public has an interest in [[Natural environment|environmental]], [[safety]], and [[health]] information, and that the basic [[research]] carried out by the Navy can be useful to [[industry]].  Unclassified information is therefore marked with the acronym "U-NNPI", but is still restricted as [[wikt:NOFORN|NOFORN]].&lt;ref&gt;See OPNAVINST N9210.3, esp. Chapters 3 and 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

NNPI is explicitly protected information and is not released to the general public without authority.  Those who release even NNPI-U without authority may be administratively punished, and even [[criminal law|criminally]] in the case of NNPI-C.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}  NNPI is restricted from disclosure under the Arms Export Control Act, [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2778 22 USC §§2778] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2794 2794(7)]; such information is listed in the [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=d148ef6a9390b1e27fc09865c734666c;rgn=div5;view=text;node=22%3A1.0.1.13.60;idno=22;cc=ecfr US Munitions List, 22 CFR §121.1], Category VI, paragraph (g).  

In some instances, small events that would normally be reported as "Events" or LOC (Loss of Control) to the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] from other licensees can be classified as NNPI-C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|url=http://azstarnet.com/news/national/dangerous-tennessee-radioactive-spill-kept-from-public-papers-sealed/article_70fed1e3-e100-5f8e-91b6-4535b39289d6.html
|title=Dangerous Tennessee radioactive spill kept from public; papers sealed 
|author=Associated Press
|publisher=Arizona Daily Star
|date=2007-08-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This designation differs for similar "events" that occur on a secret network, which are referred to as "spillage".

==History==
Oakley was started by [[James Jannard]] in 1975 out of his garage with an initial investment of $300. The name "Oakley" came from Jim's English Setter, "Oakley Anne." Jannard began by selling what he called 'The Oakley Grip' out of the back of his car at [[motocross]] events. His [[Motorcycle handlebar|motorcycle grips]] were unlike other grips available at the time. The material is still used to make the earsocks on Oakley glasses, and many of the nose pieces and now the bands of their watches. Oakley went on to produce number plates, gloves, grips, elbow guards, chin guards, and goggles for the BMX and motocross communities.&lt;ref name="Caldwell2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Caldwell|first=Michael|title=The Unknown Billionaires: The life stories of 50 self-made men and women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6n3_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT84|date=11 July 2014|publisher=eBookPartnership.com|isbn=978-0-9784620-8-6|pages=84–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; After selling Oakely Inc. to Italian Eyeware company [[Luxottica|Luxottica Group]] in 2007, founder James Jannard went on to found [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|Red Digital Cinema]].

In 1980, Jannard released a pair of [[goggles]] called the O-Frame. With the 'Oakley' logo present on the strap, the brand garnered increasing recognition and prominence throughout the sports industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oakley.com/innovation/history |title=Oakley History |publisher=Oakley.com |accessdate=April 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, Oakley began selling ski goggles.&lt;ref name="Oakley Inc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Oakley-Inc-Company-History.html| title=Oakley Inc.|accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Oakley sunglasses; Factory Pilot Eyeshades, were sport-oriented, resembling goggles and were released in 1984. These were followed in 1985 by the Oakley Frogskin, a casual sunglass style that was made in Japan.&lt;ref name="Caldwell2014"/&gt;

The company went public in 1995, raising $230 million.&lt;ref name="LA Times: A Trip to Planet Oakley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-03-16/magazine/tm-38675_1_oakley-sunglasses|title=LA Times: A Trip to Planet Oakley|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=November 4, 2012|first=Ed |last=Leibowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1996, Oakley had a pricing dispute with Italian company [[Luxottica]], the world's largest eyewear manufacturers and retailers. Luxottica stopped carrying Oakley's products in their stores, including Sunglass Hut, and Oakley's stock market value declined 33%.&lt;ref name="SIXTYMINUTES2012"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sticker shock: Why are glasses so expensive?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57527151/sticker-shock-why-are-glasses-so-expensive/|newspaper=[[60 Minutes]]|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=October 7, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/oakley-inc-history/ |title=History of Oakley, Inc. – FundingUniverse |publisher=Fundinguniverse.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Oakley bought Iacon, Inc., operator of mall-based sunglasses stores Sunglass Designs, Sporting Eyes, and Occhiali da Sole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865482/Oakley-to-buy-Iacon---a-sunglasses-retail-chain.html?pg=all |title=Oakley to buy Iacon a sunglasses retail chain |publisher=Deseret News |date=2001-09-24 |accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oakley signed a four-year agreement to manufacture eyewear designed by themselves and [[Fox Racing]] in September 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinterest.com/eyewearoutlet "Fox Racing Signs Sunglasses Deal With Oakley." ''Bicycle Retailer''. September 7, 2004] April, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2004, Jannard bought large quantities of Oakley stock: $2 million in 2004, $16 million in 2005, and $4.6 million in early 2006, bringing his personal stake in the company to 63%.&lt;ref name=sa500&gt;{{cite journal|title=Why the Oakley Buyout Was No Surprise |date=June 27, 2007 |journal=S&amp;A Digest|first=Graham|last=Summers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Oakley acquired the [[Oliver Peoples]] group, a manufacturer of high-end fashion branded eyewear (under the Oliver Peoples, Mosley Tribes, and [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)|Paul Smith]] brands) for $55.7m,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2006/02/09/339240/93733/en/Oakley-Acquires-Oliver-Peoples-a-Leading-Fashion-Eyewear-Brand.html |title=Oakley Acquires Oliver Peoples - a Leading Fashion Eyewear Brand NYSE:OO |publisher=Globenewswire.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Optical Shop of Aspen, a luxury eyewear retailer with fourteen stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opticianonline.net/Articles/2006/03/15/15434/Oakley+buys+US+luxury+chain+Optical+Shop+of+Aspen.htm |title=Oakley buys US luxury chain Optical Shop of Aspen |publisher=Optician Online |date=2006-03-15 |accessdate=2013-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429215104/http://www.opticianonline.net/Articles/2006/03/15/15434/Oakley+buys+US+luxury+chain+Optical+Shop+of+Aspen.htm |archivedate=2014-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 21, 2007, Luxottica announced a plan to purchase Oakley in a cash deal worth $2.1 billion, paying a 16% premium over the extant share price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/06/21/luxottica-oakley-update-markets-equity-cx_vr_0621markets21.html |title=Luxottica's Shade-less Deal With Oakley |publisher=Forbes |date= |accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was completed on November 15, 2007, making Oakley part of a portfolio that includes brands such as [[Ray-Ban]], [[Persol]], and Vogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moodiereport.com/document.php?c_id=1132&amp;doc_id=14387 |title=Luxottica acquires rival Oakley in US$2.1 billion deal; creates global eyewear superforce |publisher=TheMoodieReport.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112211926/http://www.moodiereport.com/document.php?c_id=1132&amp;doc_id=14387 |archivedate=2013-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schweikart"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schweikart|first1=Larry |last2=Pierson Doti|first2=Lynne |title=American Entrepreneur: The Fascinating Stories of the People Who Defined Business in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mC-dVPOSFoAC&amp;pg=PA15|year=2009|publisher=AMACOM Div American Mgmt Assn|isbn=978-0-8144-1412-5|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oakley donated 35 pairs of its Radar sports glasses, fitted with specially selected tints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/10/13/sports-sunglasses-aim-ease-miners-transition/ |title=Sports Sunglasses Can Aid Chilean Miners' Transition |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=October 13, 2010 |accessdate=October 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical innovation==

Most of Oakley's technological designs, fashion pieces, gear, etc. were developed with extensive athlete input and testing in the field – including extreme conditions. Oakley also maintains US Standard Issue, which provides U.S. military and law enforcement eye protection. Oakley M Frame sunglasses are included as part of the U.S. Army's Authorized Protective Eyewear List (APEL), and have been assigned a NSN number for ordering through military supply channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Transforming the defense industrial base a roadmap|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0t_GKF5rmsYC&amp;pg=SL2-PA28|year=2003|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-4289-8277-2|pages=27–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has also built at least one 'golf [[hovercraft]]', intended as an all terrain replacement for conventional [[golf cart]]s, in partnership with the professional golfer, [[Bubba Watson]].

== Early life and education ==
[[File:Olivier Zahm in 1979.jpg|thumb|333x333px|Zahm pictured in [[1979]] in [[Paris]]]]
Olivier Zahm was born and raised in [[Paris]], France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/community/people/olivier-zahm|title=Olivier Zahmis One of the 500 People Shaping the Global Fashion Industry|work=The Business of Fashion|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the eldest of three children born to two university professors. His parents, who were both students at the time of his birth, raised Zahm and his other siblings in student quarters that were designed by [[Charlotte Perriand]] and [[Jean Prouvé]], located at [[:fr:Résidence_universitaire_Jean-Zay|Résidence Universitaire Jean-Zay]] in [[Antony, Hauts-de-Seine|Antony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/9kby7d/purple-reign-tbt-to-2010-when-i-d-met-olivier-zahm|title=purple reign: #tbt to 2010, when i-D met olivier zahm|date=2017-05-04|work=I-d|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of his early childhood was spent in academic settings, particularly- during the volatile period of civil unrest in France that broke out in [[May 1968]]''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/9kby7d/purple-reign-tbt-to-2010-when-i-d-met-olivier-zahm|title=purple reign: #tbt to 2010, when i-D met olivier zahm|date=2017-05-04|work=I-d|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The protests reached such a point that political leaders feared civil war or revolution. The unrest began with a series of student occupation protests against [[capitalism]], [[consumerism]], [[American imperialism]], and traditional institutions, values and order. Many of the new and radical ideas surrounding Zahm, immersing his youth in tumultuous generational discord, stayed with him, shaping his views on art, philosophical ideas and lifestyle choices.  He leveraged his profound formative experience using it as a tool to build aspects and themes that remain prevalent in his personal and professional life in adulthood.  He told The [[The New York Times|New York Times]] in 2010 that he, “remembers summers spent vacationing in the South of France with his parents in a community of like minded free spirits”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/fashion/04ZAHM.html|title=Publisher in the Warhol Mold|last=Morgan|first=Spencer|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; - who he labeled hippies. It was the ''1970s'', the decade of sex revolution and Zahm's parents were committed to [[free love]]'','' [[Naturism|nudism]] and [[Polyamory|polyamourous]] relationships. "My parents had a lot of lovers, they had a lot of affairs. At the time, my parents were really part of this alternative movement in Paris but quite bourgeois too. It wasn't San Francisco or New York. It was the French way&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_au/article/9kby7d/purple-reign-tbt-to-2010-when-i-d-met-olivier-zahm|title=purple reign: #tbt to 2010, when i-D met olivier zahm|date=2017-05-04|work=I-d|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-au}}&lt;/ref&gt;." Zahm’s love of magazines began when he was a teenager in the Paris suburbs. “We used to steal porn magazines in the bookstores and shops and look at them during school,” he says. “It was fun and secret. This is where my obsession for magazines comes from. Magazines used to reveal and give us access to sex, fashion, music and art. TV never did that, and books are mostly academic. Magazines were a symbol of freedom.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2013/02/olivier-zahm-fashions-most-libidinal-editor.html|title=Riding Around Paris With Olivier Zahm, Fashion’s Most Libidinal Editor|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He studied [[Philosophy|philosophy,]] [[history]],  [[semiotics]] and [[literature]] at the [[Sorbonne University|Sorbonne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.parismatch.com/Culture/Livres/Olivier-Zahm-l-anar-chic-purple-Fashion-156808|title=Olivier Zahm, l’anar chic|last=Match|first=Paris|access-date=2018-09-24|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. His father, Claude, taught philosophy, and Zahm was on track to do the same, before realizing, at 25, that he preferred life outside “la tour d’ ivoire.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2013/02/olivier-zahm-fashions-most-libidinal-editor.html|title=Riding Around Paris With Olivier Zahm, Fashion’s Most Libidinal Editor|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zahm's youngest sister committed suicide in 1994 at the age of 20. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2013/02/olivier-zahm-fashions-most-libidinal-editor.html|title=Riding Around Paris With Olivier Zahm, Fashion’s Most Libidinal Editor|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Before entering the world of fashion, Zahm worked as an art critic with widespread recognition for his work as a curator as well as his participation in over 150 exhibitions featuring international contemporary art. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://magpile.com/purple-prose/2/|title=Purple Prose , #2|website=Magpile|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;In responding to the superficial glamour of the 1980s, Zahm co-founded Purple Prose magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://magpile.com/purple-prose/about/|title=Purple Prose  magazine on Magpile|website=magpile.com|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the introduction of Purple Anthology, Zahm shares why he chose to create Purple Prose:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rizzoliusa.com/book/9780847830206/|title=Purple Anthology: Art Prose Fashion Music Architecture Sex - Rizzoli New York|work=Rizzoli New York|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/magazine/fw-2008-issue-10/purple-anthology/|title=Purple Anthology - purple MAGAZINE|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''"We launched Purple Prose in the early 1990s without any means, and without any experience, because we wanted to make a magazine that was radically different. We wanted to support the artists around us that no one else supported, much less talked about. It would be a form of opposition of our own".'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Purple Anthology|last=Zahm|first=Olivier|last2=Fleiss|first2=Elein|publisher=Rizzoli|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8478-3020-6|location=New York City|pages=introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Purple-Anthology-Prose-Fashion-Architecture/dp/0847830209|title=Purple Anthology: Art Prose Fashion Music Architecture Sex|date=2008-05-27|publisher=Rizzoli|isbn=9780847830206|editor-last=Zahm|editor-first=Olivier|location=New York|language=English|editor-last2=Fleiss|editor-first2=Elein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Art critic and curator (1985–1994) ===
During the beginning of the 80’s Zahm started to observe and take an interest in the art world. He liked the notion of “being everywhere and on the move”, following art fairs, meeting artists, educating himself in the universe of contemporary art while immersing himself into its social landscape.  Zahm’s gift of being a charismatic intellectual and having an eye for contemporary art made itself apparent early on. He found himself penning for the three leading art titles at the time [[Artforum|Art Forum]], Art Flash, [[Texte zur Kunst|Texte Zur Kunst]] and [[Art press|Art Presse]] and introduced a then unknown [[Jeff Koons]], [[Martin Kippenberger]], and [[Larry Clark]] to the European art world.   He started traveling to the United States and Japan, realizing he could set up his own operation and work agenda, 24/7. He told [[I-D|I-D magazine]] in 2010: 
[[File:Jan Van Osst, Sans titre, 1993.jpg|thumb|Jan Van Osst, Sans Titre, 1993 at L'Hiver De L'amour in [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris|Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville Paris]] curated by Zahm]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Freedom for me came from the art world because it was a place where I could meet the artists. I wanted to be a social critic. I was more interested in the category of intellectual, involving art and politics and writing sometimes. But I didn't want to be a writer necessarily, I just wanted to be part of an intellectual world." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_au/article/9kby7d/purple-reign-tbt-to-2010-when-i-d-met-olivier-zahm|title=purple reign: #tbt to 2010, when i-D met olivier zahm|date=2017-05-04|work=I-d|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-au}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;In 1989, while working at [[Artforum]],  Elien Fleiss, then a young gallery curator received a phone call from Zahm. She was looking for an art critic to write a manifesto against a journalist from a daily newspaper who she felt was writing insanities about contemporary art in general. Zahm agreed to do it, and that was the beginning of the encounter, which then became a love story. Their romance was short-lived, but their professional relationship was fruitful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/fashion/04ZAHM.html|title=Publisher in the Warhol Mold|last=Morgan|first=Spencer|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1994, they curated “The Winter of Love,”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/4589&lt;/ref&gt; a hit show for the [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris|Museum of Modern Art in Paris]] that they later took to [[MoMA PS1|P.S. 1]] in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/4589|title=The Winter of Love (L'Hiver de l'Amour) {{!}} MoMA|website=www.moma.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/france/art-press/20170521/282626032622730|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May of  2017, Zahm published a book in collaboration with Donation Grau titled,' Une avant-garde sans avant-garde'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lespressesdureel.com/ouvrage.php?id=3523|title=Olivier Zahm: Une avant-garde sans avant-garde – Les presses du réel (livre)|website=www.lespressesdureel.com|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://i-d.vice.com/fr/article/3kbd8v/sans-dieu-ni-maitres-petite-lecon-davant-gardisme-par-olivier-zahm|title=sans dieu ni maitre, petite leçon d'avant-gardisme par olivier zahm|date=2017-04-25|work=I-d|access-date=2018-09-24|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;The book is a collection of Zahm’s most significant texts written during the last 30 years. It is above all a radical reading of art from the 1990s to the present. The [[anthology]] tries to decipher this chaotic, contradictory, oppressive, and ultra-creative period. The introductions that precede each chapter contextualize the selected texts, and develop the idea that the 1990s invented an avant-garde without an avant-garde, the issues of which are increasing and intensifying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lespressesdureel.com/ouvrage.php?id=3523|title=Olivier Zahm:  Une avant-garde sans avant-garde – Les presses du réel (livre)|website=www.lespressesdureel.com|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.fr/Une-avant-garde-sans-Olivier-Zahm/dp/2840665441|title=Une avant-garde sans avant-garde|last=recherche|first=résultats de|last2=Grau|first2=Donatien|date=2017-03-01|publisher=Les Presses du réel|isbn=9782840665441|location=Dijon; Zurich}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jrp-ringier.com/pages/index.php?id_r=4&amp;id_t=&amp;id_p=18&amp;id_b=2748|title=Olivier Zahm - Une avant-garde sans avant-garde|website=jrp-ringier|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://livre.fnac.com/a10494503/Olivier-Zahm-Une-avant-garde-sans-avant-garde|title=Une avant-garde sans avant-garde Essai sur l'art - broché - Olivier Zahm - Achat Livre {{!}} fnac|website=livre.fnac.com|language=fr-FR|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/diary/olivier-zahms-new-book-une-avant-garde-sans-avant-garde-co-edited-with-donatien-grau-is-available-now-to-pre-order/|title=Olivier Zahm's new book "Une avant-garde sans avant-garde" co-edited with Donatien Grau is available now to pre-order! - purple DIARY|date=2017-02-23|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Purple ===

==== Early day's of ''Purple'' (1992–2004) ====

Zahm gravitated towards the idea of working with magazines from the conception of his career in art.  In 1992 Zahm and his partner Elien Fleiss printed the first issue of Purple Prose, a Parisian literary art zine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ravelinmagazine.com/posts/les-chroniques-purple/|title=Les Chroniques Purple - Ravelin Magazine|date=2014-08-13|work=Ravelin Magazine|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebay.com/itm/PURPLE-PROSE-MAGAZINE-ISSUE-1-1992-OLIVIER-ZAHM-ELEIN-FLEISS-RARE-/121033472335|title=PURPLE PROSE MAGAZINE ISSUE #1 1992 OLIVIER ZAHM, ELEIN FLEISS *RARE*  {{!}} eBay|website=eBay|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their goal was to create a new kind of space for artists to present their work and express their ideas; and to design a network through which people working in different disciplines, could easily access new information and each other and contributing to the early 90s alternative indie culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-colour-purple-1249204.html|title=The colour purple|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/creative-class/olivier-zahms-cocktail-of-intellect-sex-and-the-seventies|title=Olivier Zahm’s Cocktail of Intellect, Sex and the Seventies|date=2015-05-27|work=The Business of Fashion|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zahm liked the idea of a color sharing the title with an art magazine. [[Dike Blair]] an American artist suggested the title Purple Prose in reference to the literary term in which a prose text is so extravagent, ornate, or flowery that it breaks the flow and draws excessive attention to itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2017/11/interview-olivier-zahm-on-the-purple-25th-anniversary.html|title=A French Fashion Editor on the Difference Between Paris, New York, and L.A.|last=Swanson|first=Carl|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after the birth of Purple Prose, Zahm created spin-off publications like Purple Sexe, Purple Fiction and Purple Fashion. Zahm aimed at fusing together his two worlds, fashion and art, in creating Purple Fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://magpile.com/purple-prose/1/|title=Purple Prose , #1|website=Magpile|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A typical issue featured interviews, articles and presentations covering a wide range of topics and disciplines which include; film and video, politics, fashion, architecture, sexuality, science, photography and music. Each issue was built around a loose theme which serves to create a link between subjects-past examples have been: Indian Summer, Violet Violence, Post-Sex. With its international correspondents and cutting-edge design, Purple Prose had the distinctive feel of a truly global art zine. The texts were written in roughly equal parts French and English, without translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adaweb.walkerart.org/purple/info.html|title=Purple Prose|website=adaweb.walkerart.org|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For many years the magazine was associated with a realist esthetic, that of the new photography of the early 1990s- of photographers like [[Juergen Teller]], [[Terry Richardson]], [[Wolfgang Tillmans]], and [[Mario Sorrenti]].  From a visual standpoint, the magazine represented a break from 80s imagery (like [[Richard Avedon]]’s photography for [[Versace]], for example.)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/30/fine-print-the-purple-anthology/?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=2D16E914473B5E10578FBC9B4FEF8E2C&amp;gwt=pay|title=Fine Print {{!}} 'The Purple Anthology'|last=Hruska|first=Jordan|work=T Magazine|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an artistic standpoint, the artists from the early 1990s were raising up against art as a capitalist fetish; they were aligning themselves with the artistic social and political practices of the 1970s-- those of performance, [[video art]], [[Fluxus]], and the conceptual and minimalist [[avant-garde]]. The magazine was an integral part of this burgeoning context, which included the deconstruction of fashion by [[Martin Margiela]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/magazine/ss-2007-issue-7/retrospective-maison-martin-margiela/|title=Retrospective Maison Martin Margiela - purple MAGAZINE|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Comme des Garçons|Comme des Garçsons]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/magazine/fw-2012-issue-18/rei-kawakubo/|title=Rei Kawakubo - purple MAGAZINE|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the return of subtle political art, with that of [[Félix González-Torres|Felix Gonzalez- Torres]], [[Maurizio Cattelan]], and [[Philippe Parreno]], among others; photography of [[Juergen Teller]]; and [[Harmony Korine]] and [[Larry Clark]]’s independent filmmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/magazine/ss-2013-issue-19/harmony-korine/|title=Harmony Korine - purple MAGAZINE|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/magazine/ss-2013-issue-19/larry-clark/|title=Larry Clark - purple MAGAZINE|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media now generally satisfy the need for images, contacts, and creativity. Publishing a magazine has become so expensive… An actual print object like Purple is a luxury item, which is why new alternative magazines don’t last more than a few years, are often bought, or simply disappear. Doing a luxury magazine today is one of the paradoxes of the Instagram era, when such things cost nothing… A magazine is not an ego trip… It’s a collective work by a group of creative people who believe in the artistic value of the print media and share a similar vision. (Thanks to all of them!) Every image, every single text, the choice of paper, the layout, even the choice of typefaces matters. Everything matters… Purple is made to last. Purple is made to capture a moment every season… In this period of global Internet obsession and digital amnesia, I think that means something&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/diary/purple-25th-anniversary-issue-is-out-now/|title=PURPLE 25TH ANNIVERSARY ISSUE IS OUT NOW! - purple DIARY|date=2017-09-05|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;"&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2017 Purple moved their US based headquarters and offices from [[New York City]] to [[Los Angeles]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wwd.com/business-news/media/purples-l-a-times-1202780271/|title=Purple’s L.A.

In 2009 [[Chanel]] launched its very first magazine: 31 Rue Cambon. Chanel’s goal was to combine sales and information. [[Karl Lagerfeld]] delegated the artistic direction of the magazine which was not available to the public, but instead only the private cliental of Chanel to Zahm &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tendances-de-mode.com/2009/11/17/1549-31-rue-cambon-le-magazine-chanel|title=31 Rue Cambon : le magazine Chanel - Tendances de Mode|website=www.tendances-de-mode.com|language=fr|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/diary/the-new-chanel-magazine-31-rue-cambon-issue-3/|title=THE NEW CHANEL MAGAZINE, 31 RUE CAMBON, issue #3 - purple DIARY|date=2011-02-05|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elle.com/fashion/news/a5892/olivier-zahm-made-a-corporate-mag-for-chanel-16120/|title=Olivier Zahm Made A 'Corporate Mag' for Chanel|date=2011-02-23|work=ELLE|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zahm credited Lagerfeld for reigniting his sentiment for taking photos in 2005.  Zahm told WWD in an interview dedicated to Purple’s 25th Anniversary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wwd.com/eye/people/purple-reign-10970276/|title=Purple Reign|last=Foreman|first=Katya|date=2017-09-05|work=WWD|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;:  &lt;blockquote&gt;“He (Lagerfeld) was buying these little digital cameras at the time, Sony Cyber-shots, a little pocket-size, flat, digital camera. He had a pile of them on his table and said: “Take this, if you’ll use it.” We had this long discussion about photography and I said, “Karl how can you want to be a photographer when you were friends with [[Helmut Newton]] because, me, I have [[Juergen Teller]] in my generation and I haven’t been able to do photography since I’ve known him, because he’s the best.” And he said: “Olivier, shut up. You don’t understand, photography is not about getting the right picture, it’s about documenting your everyday life. Remember [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]], do you think he was a good photographer?

'''Pavel Aleksandrovich Svedomsky''' ({{lang-ru|Павел Александрович Сведомский}}; 7 June 1849, [[Saint-Petersburg]]—27 August 1904, [[Rome]]) was a Russian painter and the brother of another artist, [[Alexander Svedomsky]].

Pavel Svedomsky studied first in the [[Düsseldorf]] Academy of Arts, then in [[Munich]] under [[Eduard von Gebhardt]] and [[Mihály Munkácsy]].

==Life==
[[File:Svedomsky-Fulvia.jpg|thumb|350px|''[[Fulvia]] With the Head of [[Cicero]]'']]
Svedomsky belonged to hereditary [[Russian nobility]]. Together with his brother he spent the childhood in the family estate Mikhaylovski Zavod, located in the [[Perm]] [[Guberniya]]. In 1870 Pavel entered the Düsseldorf Academy of Arts, but studied there only few months. The Svedomskys traveled together across Europe until settling in Rome in 1875. He died there in 1904 and is buried with his brother Alexander in the [[Protestant Cemetery, Rome|Protestant Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.protestantcemetery.it/graves/databases.html Non-Catholic Cemetery in Rome databases: Swedomsky Paolo] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207015655/http://www.protestantcemetery.it/graves/databases.html |date=February 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pavel Svedomsky painted in various genres, most notably in historic. The painting ''Medusa'' (1882) was bought by [[Pavel Tretyakov]] to be displayed in [[Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://diaghilev.u-education.ru/svedom/content/files/page5.html# СВЕДОМСКИЙ ПАВЕЛ АЛЕКСАНДРОВИЧ] Diaghilev.u-education.ru&lt;/ref&gt;

Working in the [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]] in [[Kiev]], Svedosmky painted the northern and southern [[nave]]s of the cathedral, creating six scenes from the life of [[Jesus]]: ''The Resurrection of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]]'', ''The Entry of Christ into Jerusalem'', ''The [[Last Supper]]'', ''The [[Agony in the Garden]]'', ''The Trial of [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]]'', ''The Crucifixion'' and ''The Ascension''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.rulex.ru/01180056.htm Сведомские (художники)] Rulex.ru&lt;/ref&gt; During his later years Svedomsky turned to Russian subjects, painting ''The Poor Bride'', ''The Fool in Christ'', ''The Fire of Moscow, 1812'' (1879) and ''The Execution of [[Yermak]]''.

The works of Svedomsky are scattered across various central and regional museums. The Tretyakov Gallery houses five of his paintings, while the Perm State Art Gallery holds a sketch for the church painting ''Procession of the Cross'', as well as ''Two Roman Women With Tambourine and Flute''.

[[File:Dresden - Scenography, set construction and theatrical scenery - 2546.jpg|thumb|A scenic painter at work at the [[Semperoper]] in [[Dresden, Germany]]]]
'''Theatrical scenic painting''' includes wide-ranging disciplines, encompassing virtually the entire scope of [[painting]] and craft techniques. An experienced scenic painter (or scenic artist) will have skills in [[Landscape art|landscape]] painting, [[figurative painting]], [[trompe l'oeil]], and [[faux finishing]], and be versatile in different media such as [[Acrylic paint|acrylic]], [[Oil painting|oil]], and [[tempera]] paint. The painter might also be accomplished in three-dimensional skills such as [[Sculpture|sculpting]], [[Plaster of Paris|plasterering]] and [[gilding]].

The scenic painter takes direction from the theatre designer. In some cases designers paint their own designs.

The techniques and specialized knowledge of the scenic painter replicate an image to a larger scale from a designer's [[maquette]], perhaps with accompanying photographs, printouts and original research, and sometimes with paint and style samples.

== Scenic paint ==
'''Scenic paint''' has traditionally been mixed by the painter using pigment powder colour, a binder and a medium. The binder adheres the powder to itself and to the surface on which it is applied. The medium is a thinner which allows the paint to be worked more easily, disappearing as the paint dries. Today it is common to use brands of ready-made scenic paint, or pigment suspended in a medium to which a binder will be added.

[[File:Smock Alley Theatre Dublin sign.JPG|thumb|Smock Alley Theatre sign]]

Since the 17th century there have been numerous theatres in Dublin with the name of '''Smock Alley'''.

The current '''Smock Alley Theatre''' is a 21st-century theatre in Dublin, converted from a 19th-century church building, incorporating structural material from an 18th-century theatre building, and built on the site of the 17th century [[Theatre Royal, Dublin]]. The present theatre was opened in 2012, after a €3.5 million investment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejournal.ie/smock-alley-theatre-reopening-after-225-years-453466-May2012/ Smock Alley Theatre reopening after 225 years - New theatre set to open today on site of original facility which opened in 1662.] 17 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smock Alley Theatre site comprises Smock Alley Theatre (178 seats), The Boys School (60 - 100 capacity), Black Box (80 capacity), and The Banquet Hall (300 capacity).

==History of the building==
===Theatre Royal===

The first Theatre Royal was opened on the site by [[John Ogilby]] in 1662. Ogilby, who was the first Irish [[Master of the Revels]], had previously run the [[Werburgh Street Theatre|New Theatre]] in [[Werburgh Street]], which had closed during the Puritan [[Commonwealth of England|interregnum]]. This building was entirely demolished, with a new theatre replacing it in 1735. This second building was active as a theatre until 1759, with a brief later revival until its final closure in 1787.

====First building (1662)====
The Theatre Royal consisted of a classical proscenium stage, pit, boxes, a middle and upper gallery, lattices (which were a type of box peculiar to Dublin) and a music/orchestra loft above the stage, also the acoustics were said to be excellent. The pit had backless benches and a raked floor that rose toward the back of the audience to help sightlines. Mostly single men sat here, and it was the noisiest, rowdiest area in the theatre. Boxes sat upper-class aristocrats. Boxes were luxuriously decorated with velvet drapes should the occupants require some privacy during the evening....for whatever reason. The doors were wider in the boxes to allow access for the voluminous dresses of the ladies. Galleries held the lower class, including servants of the upper classes in attendance. These were the worst seats as they were on the same level as the large chandeliers that lit the theatre. Candles were made of tallow (animal fat) and they were very pungent and smokey. The building was built on reclaimed ground from the River Liffey and due to this, in 1670 and later in 1701 the upper galleries collapsed killing several people inside and injuring many more including the son of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Charles Earl of Middlesex. He was pulled from the wreckage of his box with two broken legs

There was another partial collapse in March 1734 after which it was abandoned for a short while. The major decision was then taken to demolish and rebuild the theatre in 1735 with increased audience capacity.

====Second building (1735)====
In the time between the demolition of the original theatre and the construction of its replacement, a new theatre had opened in Aungier Street and it managed to wrestle the title Theatre Royal from Smock Alley for a time. In 1745 Thomas Sheridan, godson of [[Jonathan Swift]], took on the role of manager of Smock Alley and Aungier Street. He made many improvements and reclaimed the title Theatre Royal for Smock Alley. By 1750 the Aungier Street theatre had closed down. Sheridan was not only director of the theatre, he was also a playwright and strove to improve audiences at the theatre by cleaning up the neighbourhood in which it stood. At the time there were many unsavoury taverns and ale houses as well as many establishments of ill repute that Sheridan successfully petitioned to have closed down in favour of more wholesome and decent businesses. This change in the area encouraged more noble people to again return to the theatre and it once again thrived.

[[Benjamin Victor (theatre manager)|Benjamin Victor]] was an Englishman who originally visited Ireland in an effort to extend his textile business, but that did not prove profitable, and he eventually gave it up. On 11 October 1746 Victor settled with his family in Dublin as treasurer and deputy-manager to Sheridan at the Smock Alley Theatre. The theatre was for some years fairly successful; but about 1753 Sheridan was at variance with a portion of the theatre-going public, and for two years Victor and John Sowdon, a principal actor in the company, took over its management. On 15 July 1755 Sheridan returned to Dublin, and Victor resumed his old position. Eventually the theatre was closed on 20 April 1759, and Victor returned to England. The theatre later reopened, being active until 1787, but Victor did not return - having become involved with the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]] in his native London.

====Legacy====
The first Theatre Royal housed the plays of [[George Farquhar]] (The Recruiting Officer/The Beaux Stratagem), [[Oliver Goldsmith]] (She Stoops to Conquer) and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], son of Thomas Sheridan (The Rivals/School for Scandal). It was here that the stars of world theatre appeared to much acclaim such as Peg Woffington, Thomas Sheridan, Spranger Barry and Charles Macklin. It was on the stage of Smock Alley Theatre that [[David Garrick]], the greatest actor of the 18th century, first played Hamlet. It was the first time Hamlet had ever been staged in Ireland and some 3,000 customer clambered to get one of only 300 tickets.

It was also the site of some infamous 18th century Dublin riots, the most serious being the Kelly riots of 1747. Thomas Sheridan was manager at the time and had recently banned the presence of audience members on stage and the taking of money for the privilege of going backstage. These rules were for men only. Indeed, it was under Charles II that the law was changed to even allow women to act on stage. These rules were severely tested by a very drunk Trinity College student named Richard Kelly. Kelly did not appreciate the new rules restricting access backstage and brazenly went back stage.&lt;ref name=Chronology&gt;{{cite book|editor=Moody, T. W.|title=A New History of Ireland. '''8''': A Chronology of Irish History|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0-19-821744-2|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===St Michael and John's Church (1815)===

In 1758 another rival theatre opened, and eventually the Theatre Royal at Smock Alley closed in 1787. After this, the building was used as a whiskey store, falling into heavy disrepair before purchase by Fr Michael Blake in 1811.

The structure of the derelict building was partially demolished, and the new church incorporated some of this original theatre structure into its own during the building work, which was carried out between 1811 and 1815. The resultant new building was named St Michael and John's Church, after the medieval churches of St Michael of the Hill (now Dublinia) and St John of Booth Street (Fishamble Street). It had a famous stained glass window that is now in Swords. The theatre still boasts ornate stained glass windows and ceiling plasterwork which dates from the turn of the 20th century.

When the bell tolled in 1811, 18 years before Catholic Emancipation; it was the first Catholic bell to ring in Dublin in nearly 300 years. This prompted the aldermen of the city to bring charges against Fr Blake, though these charges were
dropped when young lawyer Daniel O'Connell came to his defence.

In 1989 due to falling numbers of parishioners the church of St Michael and John was deconsecrated. It was then redeveloped (part of the Temple Bar rejuvenation scheme) into the 'Viking Adventure' which was closed down in 2002.

===Excavation===

In 2009, a full archaeological excavation took place under Margaret Gowan Archaeology. The dig revealed part of the foundations from the first theatre on the site built in 1662, and the full basement and foundation plan of the 1735 theatre.

A total of 229 artefacts were recovered from the excavations, these included medieval and post-medieval pottery, glass finds (mostly wine bottles), clay tobacco pipe fragments, an actor's wig curler, a medieval roof tile, fragments
of mosaic floor and lots of oyster shells, remnants of the building's theatrical past.

'''Stanton Williams''' is a British [[architecture|architectural]] [[design]] practice based in [[Islington]], London.

The studio was founded by Alan Stanton and Paul Williams in 1985 and now has a team of over 85 people with four directors, two associate directors and fifteen associates. Stanton Williams has completed over 350 architectural, urban design, masterplanning, exhibition and interior design projects, winning more than 100 awards. In 2012 their [[Sainsbury Laboratory Cambridge University|Sainsbury Laboratory]] in Cambridge was awarded the [[Stirling Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Youngs|first=Ian|title=Sainsbury Laboratory wins Stirling architecture prize|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19923820|publisher=BBC|accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Paul Williams is the first design-trained architect to be registered with ARB and received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of the Arts London in 2012. Alan Stanton was elected a Royal Academician in 2009 and both Alan and Paul are both Royal Designers of Industry, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stantonwilliams.com Stanton Williams]&lt;/ref&gt; They each received an OBE for their services to architecture in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stantonwilliams.com/news/alan-stanton-and-paul-williams-receive-obe-in-queens-2014-birthday-honours-list/ Alan Stanton and Paul Williams receive OBE in Queen's 2014 birthday honours list], [http://www.stantonwilliams.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice has developed its portfolio from an initial focus on museums and galleries towards a wide variety of projects, all of which demonstrate its overarching objective of putting the user’s experience of space, light and materials at the forefront of the agenda, as well as creating places that sensitively respond to their cultural, social and physical context.

'''Swanke Hayden Connell Architects''' was an international architecture, interiors and historic preservation firm with U.S. headquarters in [[New York City]].

==History==
The firm was founded in New York in 1906 by Alexander Stewart Walker (1876-1952) and Leon N. Gillette (1878-1945). Originally known as [[Walker &amp; Gillette]], the firm designed country estates and urban townhouses for some of New York's more affluent families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Covell|first=Alwyn T.|title=Works of Walker &amp; Gillette (Variety in Architectural Practice)|journal=Architectural Record|date=January–June 1914|volume=XXXV|pages=277–355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the years, the practice expanded to include corporate interiors for prominent banking and brokerage concerns as well as major architectural commissions such as the [[Fuller Building]] at 57th Street and Madison Avenue and the First National Bank Building at 57th Street.

Following Gillette's death in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=L.N. Gillette Dies; Long an Architect|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 4, 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; A. Stewart Walker merged his practice with the Office of [[Alfred Easton Poor]]. The firm practiced under the name of Walker &amp; Poor from 1946 to 1952 with commissions that included Sotheby Parke Bernet Galleries, [[Chemical Bank]], [[Morgan Stanley]] &amp; Co. Inc., [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation]] and [[NATO]] air bases in France.

After Walker's death in 1952,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A. Stewart Walker, Noted Architect, 72|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 11, 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; the firm continued the practice as the Office of Alfred Easton Poor until 1971. In 1958, the firm opened a second office in Washington, D.C. During this period, the firm expanded and diversified further into governmental facilities, office buildings, communications centers, and industrial structures throughout the United States, Europe, and South America.

In 1972, the firm became known as Poor and Swanke &amp; Partners, in 1975, Poor, Swanke, Hayden &amp; Connell, in 1979, Swanke Hayden Connell &amp; Partners, and in 1981, Swanke Hayden Connell Architects. During this time, the firm expanded its disciplines and became a global practice, opening offices in Miami and London in 1987, Istanbul in 1997, Sheffield 2002, Moscow in 2006, and Shanghai in 2010.

In 2000, the firm acquired Taylor Clark Architects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Richard C. Clark, architect|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/operations/facilities-commercial-real-estate/753794-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; a firm specializing in the healthcare field. In 2002, the Firm acquired George Trew Dunn Architects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Swanke Hayden acquires firm|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3601/is_39_48/ai_86851793/?tag=content;col1|newspaper=Real Estate Weekly|date=May 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; another healthcare architecture firm with offices in London and Sheffield, England.

On January 6, 2015 the firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, after failing to receive over $2 million in fees from a client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Century-old architecture firm Swanke Hayden Connell files for bankruptcy|url=http://www.dezeen.com/2015/01/14/swanke-hayden-connell-architects-bankruptcy/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Terry Fenton was born in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] in 1940, and studied at Regina College's School of Fine Art (now [[University of Regina]]) from 1958-1960, with [[Ronald Bloore]], [[Roy Kiyooka]], and [[Arthur McKay]]. Moving to the Saskatoon campus to study English literature, Fenton earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1962. Along with studies at the University of Regina (1965-1966), Fenton attended [[Emma Lake Artist's Workshops]] in Saskatchewan with [[John Cage]] and [[Lawrence Alloway]] in 1965, [[Frank Stella]] in 1967, and Michael Steiner in 1969.&lt;ref name="SNAC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sknac.ca/index.php?page=ArtistDetail&amp;id=307|title=Saskatchewan NAC Artists - Terry Fenton|first=|last=Squareflo.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bugeramathesongallery.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Terry-Fenton-Bio-2014.pdf Bugera Matheson Gallery, Terry Fenton: Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Painting ==
The imagery in Terry Fenton's paintings is often focused on the large skies and wide open prairies of his home province. In Fenton's own words, "''Because of their apparent lack of scenery, the open prairies haven't been much painted by anyone. Even painters who've flourished in Saskatchewan have preferred the river valleys in the plains or the aspen parkland and forest to the north and east. While I admire and have absorbed much from them, I'm drawn south and west to the grasslands, partly because I was born and raised in Regina, but especially because the colour and light there is so luminous.''"&lt;ref name="SNAC" /&gt; Fenton's paintings can be found in a number of collections, including the [[University of Lethbridge]], Alberta; the [[MacKenzie Art Gallery]], Regina; the [[Art Gallery of Greater Victoria]], British Columbia; and the Canada Council Art Bank, Ottawa.&lt;ref name="TFCV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharecom.ca/fenton/cv.html|title=Terry Fenton Curriculum Vitae|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/fenton_terry.html|title=Terry Fenton Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing ==
Terry Fenton's writing on art has touched on subjects both historical and contemporary, from essays on [[Fayum mummy portraits]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/fenton/fayuum.html Terry Fenton, ''"PRE-PICTURES? Roman Portraits from FAYUUM"'']&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Giovanni Bellini]]'s ''[[St. Francis in Ecstasy (Bellini)|St. Francis in Ecstasy]],''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/fenton/bellini.html Terry Fenton, ''"St. Francis in Ecstasy"'']&lt;/ref&gt; to articles on [[Morris Louis]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/fenton/louis.html Terry Fenton, ''"Morris Louis"'']&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adolph Gottlieb]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/fenton/gottlieb.html Terry Fenton, ''"Adolph Gottlieb"'']&lt;/ref&gt;
Fenton has written a number of books, including monographs on [[Dorothy Knowles]], [[Reta Cowley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hagiospress.com/books/detail/land-marks-the-art-of-dorothy-knowles|title=Hagios Press|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Caro]] and [[Kenneth Noland]], as well as his 2009 treatise on pictorial art, "About Pictures."

'''''The Excursion to Tilsit''''' is a 1917 collection of short stories or novellas by the German writer [[Hermann Sudermann]]. Its German title is '''''Litauische Geschichten''''', which means "Lithuanian stories". The book consists of four stories set in rural Lithuania in the mid 19th century. It was published in English in 1930, translated by Lewis Galantière.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/excursion-to-tilsit/oclc/1474999|title=The excursion to Tilsit|work=[[WorldCat]]|accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several stories from the book have been adapted for film. Most famously, [[F. W. Murnau]]'s 1927 film ''[[Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans]]'' is loosely based on the titular story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fischer|first=Lucy|year=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V96tee1l2q8C&amp;pg=PA75|chapter=Sunrise: A Tale of Two Humans|editor1-last=White|editor1-first=Rob|editor2-last=Buscombe|editor2-first=Edward|title=British Film Institute Film Classics, Volume 1|location=London; New York|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]; [[Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|Fitzroy Dearborn]]|page=75|isbn=1-57958-328-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Hired Girl''' (Die Magd)

==Reception==
Margaret Wallace of ''[[The Bookman (New York)|The Bookman]]'' wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Like [[Selma Lagerlöf]], and many other novelists whose material is national and even provincial, Sudermann by his very unconcern with cosmopolitan values gives a deeper truth and meaning to the lives of his characters. Of these four stories of Lithuanian peasants, only one, "Miks Bumbullis", depends for its effect upon purely national traits and circumstances. They are, for the most part, founded solidly upon the fundamental and inescapable human facts of birth and love and death. They are moving and tragic and, above all, intensely and vividly alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Wallace|first=Margaret|year=April 1930|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Bookman-1930apr-00214a03|title=''The Excursion to Tilsit'' by Hermann Sudermann|work=[[The Bookman (New York)|The Bookman]]|page=214-215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[The Outlook (New York)|The Outlook]]'' reviewed the book:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Excursion to Tilsit'' by Hermann Sudermann is a collection of powerful short stories dealing with the life of Lithuanian peasants. The author has observed them sympathetically and at first hand. Nominal Catholics, they still live in fear of pagan gods, giving even their lives to propitiate them. ... Among the stories, that of Jons and Erdma who, having built a home by tricks and cunning are tricked out of it at last by their daughters, compares favorably with [[Ivan Turgenev|Turgeniev's]] ''Lear of the Steppes'' as a story of faith and treachery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=1930-04-02|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Outlook-1930apr02-00544a02|title=The Leisure Arts: The Week's Reading|work=[[The Outlook (New York)|The Outlook]]|page=546}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Throwing Curves : Eva Zeisel''''' is a 2002 [[documentary film]] directed by [[Jyll Johnstone]]. The film follows and interviews then-97-year-old [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[industrial design]]er and [[ceramic art]]ist [[Eva Zeisel]]. It examines how her upbringing, fame, and personality have influenced her work and reputation to the present day. Zeisel narrates her own history, including her escape from both the Soviet Union and Nazi-annexed Austria, as family members, friends, and relevant experts offer insights into her character.&lt;ref name=ceramicstoday&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Alternating between archival footage and video interviews, the film explores how Zeisel's personal life has shaped the development of her work, which is on display in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and other museums around the world.&lt;ref name=moma&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Zeisel's age is a key theme of the film, and several interviewees comment on her unusual industriousness and innovation for an elderly woman.

The film is the first in a series of three films by [[Directors Guild of America Awards|Directors Guild of America Award]]-nominated director [[Jyll Johnstone]] that "explores the lives of three 85-plus women still actively engaged in creative lives."&lt;ref name=canobielisting&gt;

'''Venecia, Puente de Rialto''' is an oil painting by [[Giorgio de Chirico|Giorgio of Chirico]] from 1950. The style of this work moves away from his metaphysical landscapes, characterized by the inclusion of architecture, sculptures and big empty spaces.

== Description of the work ==
The strong impression that the Italian squares and sights caused on Greek artists is evident in this painting.
The main motif in this work is the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]]. It widens towards the front and some of the sumptuous Venetian edifications line its banks.
The Puente de Rialto is the centre of the composition. It stands out by its white colour, imitated only by one of the lateral constructions.&lt;ref&gt;Varios, Museo Soumaya, Ed. Fundación Carlos Slim, México 2015, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vincent Brooks, Day &amp; Son''' was a major British [[lithographic]] firm most widely known for reproducing the weekly caricatures published in ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine 1868-1914)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine. The company was formed in 1867 when Vincent Brooks bought the name, good will and some of the property of Day &amp; Son Ltd, which had gone into [[liquidation]] that year. The firm reproduced artwork and illustrations and went on to print many of the iconic [[London Underground]] posters of the twenties and thirties before being wound up in 1940.

== Vincent Brooks ==
Company literature holds 1848 as the year that Vincent Robert Alfred Brooks (1815–1885) first set up in business.&lt;ref name="centenary"&gt;Document from the company’s 1923 Centenary Celebration. Brooks Family Collection.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was the radical printer and stationer John Brooks of 421 Oxford Street.&lt;ref name="Brooks"&gt;Brooks, Frederick Vincent, undated, My Life’s Medley – an autobiography. Chapter 1, unpublished.&lt;/ref&gt; John Brooks has been described as the publisher of the Owenites because of his association with the early socialist [[Robert Owen]].&lt;ref&gt;Medwin, Thomas, 1847, The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley, Vol. 1, p.102, Thomas Cautley Newby, London.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the second council of the National Political Union&lt;ref&gt;National Political Union, 1833, Proceedings at the Second Annual Meeting of the National Political Union, held at The Crown and Anchor Tavern, Strand, on Monday, 4 February 1833.

After leaving school, Vincent Brooks spent time on [[John Minter Morgan]]'s farm estate near Uxbridge before returning to London to join his father in business.&lt;ref name="BCPS"&gt;British &amp; Colonial Printer &amp; Stationer and Booksellers’ Circular. Vol. XV, No. 17. Thursday, 22 October 1885.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1840 John Brooks relocated to the Channel Island of Jersey where he continued to trade as a wholesale stationer and paper merchant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vincentbrooksnotes.blogspot.com/2009/07/notes-made-from-elizabeth-brooks-diary.html|title=The Brooks' Journey to Jersey|first=|last=Simon|date=1 July 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent was left with the business in London.&lt;ref&gt;The 1841 Census shows Vincent Brooks living at 421 Oxford Street while John Brooks and family are now in Jersey. Census Returns of England and Wales &amp; Channel Islands Census, 1841. Kew, Surrey, England. The National Archives of the UK: Public Record Office.&lt;/ref&gt; At some time during this period he was also associated with Charles Robertson, an artists’ colourman based in Long Acre.&lt;ref name="BCPS"/&gt;

It is not certain at what point Vincent Brooks first practised lithography. A number of his early pieces were shown at the [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition of 1851]].&lt;ref name="BCPS"/&gt; The following year the business moved from Oxford Street to 40 King Street, Covent Garden.&lt;ref name="Brooks"/&gt;
[[File:Vincent Brooks.jpg|thumb|Vincent Brooks]]
Vincent conducted lithographic classes at [[Marlborough House]] during 1855 in what was destined to become the [[Royal College of Art]]. He was entrusted with the Princess Royal's Dying Soldier on the Battlefield, which was reproduced and sold in aid of the Patriotic fund.&lt;ref name="BCPS"/&gt; The following year the [[Arundel Society]] commissioned a series of lithographs to be issued yearly to their subscribers. An effort described as ‘…the most important non-commercial application of chromolithography’ in the country at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Denvir, B., "The Loaded Image," Art &amp; Artists (Sept. 1976), pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Arundel Society complained, maybe unjustly, about the quality or the lack of expertise in depicting religious subjects. The prints were also hampered by delays and by 1860 production had been switched to a German firm.&lt;ref&gt;Art Journal, 1874, pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Leighton Brothers, who would go on to produce the pictures featured in the [[Illustrated London News]], left their Red Lion Square premises in 1857. Vincent Brooks is reported to have taken over the remaining plant.&lt;ref name="BCPS"/&gt;

Staying in the Covent Garden area of London, two years later, during 1859, Vincent Brooks moved to larger premises in Chandos Street.&lt;ref name="Brooks"/&gt; The street is now renamed Chandos Place. Work from this era is marked either as Vincent Brooks Lith. or Vincent Brooks imp.

[[1862 International Exhibition|London's International Exhibition]] of 1862 saw Vincent Brooks awarded a gold medal for his Lithograph of [[William Mulready|Mulready]]’s ‘Choosing the Wedding Gown’.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 11 August 1921, Obituary of Frederick Vincent Brooks, London.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year Vincent Brooks produced one of his finest works in the form of a chromo-lithograph of the Lumley Portrait of William Shakespeare.&lt;ref name="BCPS"/&gt; It is even reported that the reproduction was so complete that one was sold for forty guineas to a purchaser who thought he was buying the original portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Ingleby, C.M., 1883, Shakespeare’s Bones.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1860s, Vincent Brooks acquired plant and premises of Messrs J.S.Hodgson &amp; Son of High Street Lambeth and he embarked in letterpress and colour block printing.&lt;ref name="Brooks"/&gt; The firm also fought off competition from Day &amp; Son and Messrs Hanhart Bros in reproducing one of [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]]’s cartoons of Jorrocks in a competition organised by [[Punch Magazine]]. The company’s winning entry was reproduced by one of their leading chromo-lithographic artists, William B. Bunney, and the firm’s success led to many years of work from Punch.&lt;ref name="Brooks"/&gt;

In 1865 Vincent Brooks became involved with the ‘inventor’ of colour printing [[George Baxter (printer)|George Baxter]]. He purchased many of Baxter's plates and printed them using Baxter's presses which he had lent him on the understanding that George Baxter Jr. took up the management of them and that George Baxter himself supervised the work.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, C. T. C., 1908, George Baxter (colour printer) his Life and Work: A Manual For Collectors, Sampson Low, Marston, London.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a complex process that required up to 20 blocks per image. The process failed to pay its way and Brooks sold the plant four years later to Abraham Le Blond.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, C.T.C., 1920, The Le Blond Book, p.108, Sampson Low, Marston &amp; Company, London and Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;

1866 saw Vincent Brooks joined in business by his second eldest son [[wikibooks:The Rowers of Vanity Fair/Brooks FV|Frederick Vincent Brooks]]&lt;ref&gt;The Baxter Society, 1921, Quarterly Journal, Vol. 1, Hall &amp; English, Birmingham.&lt;/ref&gt; who was to eventually take over after his father's death.

At Paris's [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]], held during 1867, Vincent Brooks won a gold medal for ‘the excellence of their reproductions’.&lt;ref&gt;British &amp; Colonial Printer &amp; Stationer, 13 January 1927, Volume 100, Number 2., Page 22. Who’s Who: WV Brooks.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vincent Brooks had started negotiating to take over the business of Day &amp; Son Ltd during 1866.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;Lewis, C.T.C., 1924, George Baxter, The Picture Printer, P.195. Sampson Low, Marston &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Financially assisted by the Mr. [[Henry Graves (printseller and publisher)|Henry Graves]], the Printseller of Pall Mall,&lt;ref name="Brooks"/&gt; Vincent Brooks bought their property, name, and goodwill in an agreement dated 25 March 1867.&lt;ref&gt;The Baxter Society, 1923, Quarterly Journal, Vol. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The firm now became known as Vincent Brooks, Day &amp; Son.&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt;

== Day &amp; Son ==
The firm of [[William Day (lithographer)|William Day]], later Day &amp; Son, has been described as one of the largest and most prominent lithographic firms of the second third of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Tidman"&gt;Tidman, Kathy Kajander, 1997, Art for the Victorian Household, p.13, Online Originals, London &amp; Bordeaux.&lt;/ref&gt; Company documents record William Day's business starting in 1823&lt;ref name="centenary"/&gt; although the first known lithograph was produced the following year. By 1829 the firm had moved from 59 Great Queen Street to 17 Gate Street.&lt;ref&gt;Twyman, Michael, 1976, A Directory of London Lithographic Printer, 1800–1850. As cited by K.K. Tidman, Op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early thirties the company was often referred to as Day &amp; Haghe.&lt;ref name="centenary"/&gt; This was due to the popularity of the work of [[Louis Haghe]] a Belgian draughtsman and water colourist who worked for the company until 1852 when he left to focus on painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidrobertslithographs.com/whoislh.html,|title=Who was Louis Haghe?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Past management.jpg|thumb|Taken from the 1923 Centenary Programme; an illustration showing the firm's past management.]]

The firm was granted the status of  ‘Lithographers to Queen Victoria and to the Queen Dowager, Queen Adelaide’ in 1837&lt;ref&gt;"Spotlight on Vincent Brooks, Day and Son", ‘INTO PRINT’
(house journal of Sanders Philips Corporation), n.d. pp. 2–3. As cited by K.K. Tidman, Op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; although they were not the only lithographers to be awarded the Royal Warrant.&lt;ref name="Tidman"/&gt; William Day Senior died in 1845&lt;ref&gt;Day, William Jr., 1891, Notes and Queries, p.452&lt;/ref&gt; leaving the business in the hands of his son William Day Junior. The company now became known as Day &amp; Son.&lt;ref name="centenary"/&gt;

The 1850s started with a prize medal at the Great Exhibition for their display of lithography.&lt;ref&gt;Korey, M.E. &amp; McLean, Ruari, 1995. Elegant Editions: Aspects of Victorian Book Design and Colour Printing, University of Toronto, Massey College, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid fifties the premises in Gate Street were enlarged and the Prince of Wales and Prince Alfred visited (probably the completed works) in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Illustrated London News, vol. xxviii, 1856, p.488. This wood-engraving has been reproduced in M. Twyman’s "The Tinted Lithograph" ‘Journal of the Printing Historical Society’, 1965, vol. 1, p.55. That the premises were enlarged around this time is indicated in the ‘Abridged Prospectus’ quoted below on p.280. As cited by K.K. Tidman Op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1851, Day &amp; Son was commissioned by [[Matthew Digby Wyatt]], known for his work as an architect, to produce the book ''The Industrial Arts of the Nineteenth Century'', an imposing imperial folio in two volumes which illustrates a selection of items from the [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition of 1851]].&lt;ref name="Leathlean, Howard 1993 pp. 229-245"&gt;Leathlean, Howard. The Archaeology of the Art Director? Some Examples of Art Direction in Mid-Nineteenth-Century British Publishing. Journal of Design History, Vol. 6, No. 4 (1993), pp. 229-245. Oxford University Press on behalf of Design History Society.&lt;/ref&gt; There are 160 chromolithographed plates. Wyatt himself stated that he had used 'the best means of graphic representation available'.&lt;ref&gt;M. Digby Wyatt, Industrial Arts of the Nineteenth Century, 2 vols., Day &amp; Son, 1851-3, vol. 1, p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; Wyatt proudly drew attention to the previously unsurpassed scale and speed of production of the book. But what brought the entire project into being was the desire of Day &amp; Son to demonstrate the potential of [[chromolithography]]. The firm was particularly associated with the process. However, as Wyatt himself explained, the proposal was not even formalized until after the Great Exhibition had opened. Such a grandiose production must have called into play a significant proportion of Day's resources, including skilled craftsmen and lithographers such as Francis Bedford, J.A. Vinter and [[Henry Rafter]], as well as significant capital, and management. According to Wyatt, four or five of Day's staff were constantly engaged upon the business details of the operation alone.&lt;ref name="Leathlean, Howard 1993 pp. 229-245"/&gt;

In 1861 the firm printed a large run of bank notes for [[Lajos Kossuth]], the famous Hungarian patriot and democratic. Kossuth was in exile from his homeland and this attempt at re-establishing a separate Hungarian currency lead to both him and Day &amp; Son to be charged in the courts with having ‘levied war upon the Emperor of Austria’. The affair ended with Day &amp; Son delivering the notes to the Bank of England where they were duly burnt.&lt;ref&gt;Colebrook, F., "A Fine Old Lithographer", ‘Modern Lithographer’, 1906, p.537. As cited by K.K. Tidman Op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm now started to experience financial difficulties. Many stock auctions were held, the first, of engravings, taking place in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, 1865, A catalogue of the first portion of the valuable stock of choice line engravings, important chromo lithographs, and other productions, of the eminent firm of Day &amp; Son. Lithographers to The Queen: Which will be sold by auction, by Mr. Hodgson, at his new auction rooms, No. 115, Chancery Lane, London.&lt;/ref&gt; That year Day &amp; Son became a Limited Company.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter Society, 1923, Quarterly Journal, Vol.3&lt;/ref&gt; This not only meant that capital could be raised by the sale of shares but also that, in some cases, employees could be paid partly in shares in lieu of real wages.&lt;ref&gt;Eyre-Todd, ‘William Simpson’, p.176. As cited by K.K Tidman Op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another auction, this time of illustrated books, was held in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;The Bookseller, 28 Feb 1866, p. 185. "Mr. G Hodgson will sell by Auction, at his rooms, 115, Chancery Lane, W.C., on TUESDAY, 13 and 3 March following days, at 1 o’clock, the whole of the following highly important books, being that portion of the Productions of the eminent firm of Day &amp; Son, Lithographers to the Queen, not purchased by the Company "Day &amp; Son (Limited),"&lt;/ref&gt; Hodgson &amp; Co. would continue to sell off Day &amp; Son assets up until 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, 1873, A catalogue of fine illustrated books chiefly the productions of "Day &amp; Son, Limited": Which will be sold by auction, by Messrs. Hodgson, at their auction rooms, No. 115, Chancery Lane, W.C. (Fleet Street End,) on Tuesday, 18 November 1873.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their other business worries by 1866 Day &amp; Son Ltd, as well as Gate Street, had premises at 43 Piccadilly and at The German Gallery, New Bond Street.&lt;ref&gt;The Bookseller, 31 Oct 1851, p.704. Advert gives company addresses as 6 Gate Street and the ‘German Gallery, 168, New Bond Street, W."&lt;/ref&gt; These were show rooms and exhibition spaces for the company's work. They also took on the well-known photographer Vernon Heath to manage the photographic department.&lt;ref&gt;‘Art Journal’, 1866, p.62. As cited by K.K. Tidman, Op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since becoming a limited company, directorship was conditional on holding at least five hundred shares. Just two years after incorporation it was pointed out to William Day Junior that he no longer fulfilled this criterion. He refused to leave the board and after the resulting row he left the company and for a short time started business in Cockspur Street.&lt;ref&gt;Eyre-Todd, ‘William Simpson’, pp.175–76. As cited by K.K. Tidman, Op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm now faced liquidation and was taken over by Vincent Brooks.

== Vincent Brooks, Day &amp; Son ==
Vincent Brooks now consolidated the new combined business in Day &amp; Son's Gate Street premises. A later obituary published in a trade journal praises Vincent Brooks's handling of the situation stating that ‘the way in which he combined together the two businesses testified to his energy and experience, and the way in which they formed a harmonious whole, were a record of his remarkable tact and kindness.’&lt;ref name="BCPS"/&gt;
[[File:Parker Street.JPG|thumb|Employees of Vincent Brooks, Day &amp; Son prepare to depart from Parker Street on a works outing.]]

A year after the merger, 1868,  [[Thomas Gibson Bowles|Gibson Bowles]] began planning his new ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine 1868-1914)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine. His new brand of society weekly was to carry satirical [[caricature]]s of the men of the day lithographed by Vincent Brooks.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;Vanity Fair, 18 September 1912, p.364, from the text accompanying Frederick Vincent Brooks's cartoon.&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when Punch magazine was still primarily using wood blocks&lt;ref&gt;Appelbaum, Stanley &amp; Kelly, Richard, 1981, Great Drawings and Illustrations from Punch 1841–1901, pp.x-xi. Dover Publications, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; this ‘process of [[chromolithography]] and wedding it to a new kind of visual humour helped to bring about a revolution in taste, preparing the way for the acceptance of less strictly representational art forms and breaching the fortifications of academic realism.’&lt;ref&gt;Weil, Thomas E., 2005, Beauty and the Boats: Art and Artistry in Early British Rowing, Illustrated from the Thomas E. Weil Collection, pp.46–47, River and Rowing Museum, Henley-on-Thames, England.&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue to carry a cartoon came out in January 1869 featuring a portrait of [[Benjamin Disraeli]].&lt;ref&gt;National Portrait Gallery, Disraeli and Gladstone in Vanity Fair, Past Exhibition Archive, Victorian Galleries 8 July – 12 December 2004. "The leading society magazine Vanity Fair was founded in 1868 and introduced a distinctive type of satirical portraiture new to British journalism. Appearing every week for over half a century, these caricatures were reproduced by the revolutionary new process of chromolithography and included many of the best-known personalities of the late Victorian and Edwardian periods.

This display brings together the original drawings for the first two caricatures to be published in the magazine. The first of these, [[Carlo Pellegrini (caricaturist)|Carlo Pellegrini]]'s [[Benjamin Disraeli]] shown on the left, appeared in the issue of 30 January 1869. This landmark work in the history of nineteenth-century graphic satire was recently acquired by the Gallery. The second caricature to be published – also by Pellegrini – was of Disraeli's great political adversary, [[William Ewart Gladstone|W. E. Gladstone]]. The original drawing for this has been part of the Gallery's collection of ''Vanity Fair'' watercolours since 1923 and is shown alongside.

Born in Capua in 1839, [[Carlo Pellegrini (caricaturist)|Carlo Pellegrini]] moved to London in November 1864 where he became the protégé of the Prince of Wales and his set. Joining the magazine as an amateur without any professional experience, Pellegrini's caricatures were none the less brilliantly successful. Both these drawings are signed 'Singe', subsequently to be anglicised to 'Ape’."&lt;/ref&gt; Later the magazine would claim that, {{Cquote|Vincent Brooks...was a pioneering lithographer on whose expertise Bowles built Vanity Fair.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;}}

Back in Chandos Street the firm had received a Command from the Queen to execute lithographs of Kenneth MacLeay's watercoloured Highlanders of Scotland.&lt;ref name="Brooks"/&gt; These featured the principle clans and the retainers of the Royal Household at Balmoral and are known as the artist's best works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/online_az/4:322/?initial=M&amp;artistId=5779&amp;artistName=Kenneth+MacLeay&amp;submit=1|title=Artworks - National Galleries of Scotland|website=www.nationalgalleries.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1870 the originals had appeared at an exhibition at Mitchell's Royal Library in Old Bond Street with the lithographs being sold in two volumes later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/University_Library/libs/hay/focus/victoria/|title=Focus on the John Hay Library|website=www.brown.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1870s the firm was employing over one hundred and forty men and forty boys&lt;ref&gt;The 1871 Census records Alfred’s occupation as ‘retired Lithographer’. Census Returns of England and Wales &amp; Channel Islands Census, 1871. Kew, Surrey, England. The National Archives of the UK: Public Record Office. Vincent Brooks is listed as ‘Lithographer (employing 148 men and 40 boys)’.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1885 acquired the remaining part of Leighton bros.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Thomas Courtney Lewis, 1928, The Story of Picture Printing in England During the Nineteenth Century, p.87.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 September 1885 Vincent Brooks died in [[Spalding &amp; Hodge]] Counting House, Drury Lane.&lt;ref&gt;Boase, Frederic, 1965, Modern English Biography: Containing Many Thousand Concise Memoirs of persons who have died between the years 1851–1900, with an index of the most interesting matter, Frank Cass, London.&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded in the business by his son [[b:The Rowers of Vanity Fair/Brooks FV|Frederick Vincent Brooks]] (1848–1921).&lt;ref&gt;Wakeman and Bridson, ‘Guide to Colour Printers’, p.18. As cited by K.K. Tidman, Op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Centenary diagram.jpg|thumb|left|Taken from the 1923 Centenary Programme; a diagram showing the firm's history.]]

Frederick and his older brother Alfred appeared in the bankruptcy courts in 1898&lt;ref&gt;The London Gazette, 11 February 1898, First meetings and public examinations listings.&lt;/ref&gt;  and on 14 May that year the company was incorporated as Vincent Brooks, Day &amp; Son Ltd.&lt;ref name="High Court"&gt;High Court of Justice, 24 June 1940, Chancery Division, Companies Court, Summary of Statement of Affairs in the matter of Vincent Brooks, Day &amp; Son, Limited. "2. The Company was incorporated on 14 May 1898, under the Companies Acts, 1862 to 1893, with a nominal capital of £10,000 in £1 shares and was formed to acquire and take over as a going concern the business carried on at 48, Parker Street under the style of Vincent Brooks, Day &amp; Son and to carry on the business of printers, lithographers, etc."&lt;/ref&gt; During this time the firm's premises in Gate Street were badly damaged by fire. It started around ten o'clock in the evening of Sunday 10 April and quickly spread through the buildings. It is reported that 'the whole of the main building, containing about 40 printing machines and a great quantity of type, had been entirely destroyed'.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Monday 11 April 1898, pg.4.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the run of Vanity Fair prints temporarily switched to colour offsets produced by P.W. Van De Weyer over in the Netherlands&lt;ref name="Mellini, p.204"&gt;Matthews and Mellini, 'In Vanity Fair', p.204, 1982, London, Scolar Press&lt;/ref&gt;  and the firm moved to a new home in Parker Street just a couple of minutes walk west of Gate Street.&lt;ref name="High Court"/&gt;

From January 1906 ''Vanity Fair'' used a number of other (probably cheaper) firms to produce their caricatures.&lt;ref name="Mellini, p.204"/&gt; This decision was reversed in 1911 with the arrival of editor Thomas Allinson who, struggling with the now failing magazine, wished to revert to the process whereby 'the most satisfactory results' had been obtained.&lt;ref&gt;Vanity Fair, Article by Jehr Junior, Aug 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; Vanity Fair magazine finally ceased publication in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;What happened to Vanity Fair magazine?
Vanity Fair: The Early Years, 1914–1936. An on-line article by the current owners of Vanity Fair. "Once upon a time, before the income tax, the Great War, and Prohibition, Mr. Condé Nast bought a magazine called Dress, a potential rival to his four-year-old Vogue. A few months later, in 1913, he paid $3,000 for a musty British social, literary, and political review titled Vanity Fair, named after both the sinful place in John Bunyan's 17th-century allegory The Pilgrim's Progress and William Makepeace Thackeray's 19th-century satirical novel. Crossbreeding his two acquisitions, Nast created Dress and Vanity Fair, a hydra-headed flop. To salvage the situation, Nast sought advice from the most cultivated, elegant, and endearing man in publishing, if not Manhattan, Frank Crowninshield. The upper-crust aesthete—who, earlier the same year, had helped organize the landmark Armory Show, a succés de scandale which introduced Cubism to the American public—offered a remarkably simple solution. "Your magazine should cover the things people talk about," Crowninshield told Mr. Nast. "Parties, the arts, sports, theatre, humor, and so forth." Nast at once anointed Crowninshield editor, and agreeing to ditch the first half of the old title, the publishing tycoon launched Vanity Fair in January 1914."&lt;/ref&gt; Its forty-five year run of [[List of Vanity Fair caricatures|caricatures]] ended as Allinson absorbed it into his ''Hearth and Home'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews and Mellini, 'In Vanity Fair', p.36, 1982, London, Scolar Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The start of the century also saw Frederick Vincent Brooks write an article for the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Frederick Vincent, 1907, Draft for Encyclopædia Britannica entry on Lithography. Brooks Family Collection.&lt;/ref&gt; and become the official printer of the [[Senefelder Club]].&lt;ref&gt;Pennell, Elizabeth Robins, 1929, The Life and Letters of Joseph Pennell, Vol.2, p.77, Little, Brown &amp; Company, USA. The source puts the firms involvement around early 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick died on 7 August 1921&lt;ref&gt;Death Certificate of Frederick Vincent Brooks. General Register Office. England and Wales Civil Registration Indexes. London, England. No. 245, Seventh August 1921, 27 Hornsey Rise Gardens, Male, 72 years, Lithographer, Cause of death:(1)Hodgkiss disease [Hodgkins] (2)Asthenia, Informant: F A Brooks, Son present at death 27 Hornsey Rise Gardens Islington.&lt;/ref&gt; and the business passed to two of his sons, Wilfred Vincent Brooks and Frederick Allan Brooks.&lt;ref name="High Court"/&gt; Two years later the firm celebrated their centenary. Wilfred remarked that ‘although there were older firms in existence that were now practising lithography, no other house had been established as lithographic printers for so long a period as theirs.’ During the evening's celebration it was also announced that a former apprentice Thomas Edgar Griffits had been co-opted onto the firm's board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;The British &amp; Colonial Printer and Stationer, Vol. 93, no. 25, 20 December 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Brooks Brothers and apprentice.JPG|thumb|The directors of Vincent Brooks, Day &amp; Son Ltd in the late 1920s. Right to left; Frederick Allan Brooks, Wilfred Vincent Brooks and Thomas Edgar Griffits.]]

During the twenties and thirties the art of the poster reached its pinnacle. Under the guidance of [[Frank Pick]], the London Underground embraced the likes of [[John Hassall (illustrator)|John Hassall]] and [[Edward McKnight Kauffer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ltmcollection.org/posters/about/behindthecollection.html?IXstory=all|title=Information|website=www.ltmcollection.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists were directly commissioned and it was believed that the influence of good design could extend to enrich every aspect of life. This was a common theme during the thirties. Wilfred Vincent Brooks served as chairman of the Commercial Printing Section of the [[Royal Academy|Royal Academy of Art]]'s exhibition ‘British Art in Industry’ held during 1935. He expressed his own sentiments in a speech soon after,

{{Cquote|The day, I hope, will come when quality and quantity will come together in happy alliance and the most ordinary commodities will benefit in form as well as in substance. Ugliness is at all times and in all places to be vigorously rejected; it is a coarsening and debasing influence, a clear sign of deterioration in a nations life. Since the products of industry are so widespread amongst the people, there influence for a good or evil condition of taste is immense. Hence the conquest of ugliness is of even greater moment in industry than elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Wilfred Vincent, 1935, Speech made to the Lincoln branch of the National Council of Women at the Great Northern Hotel, Lincoln, Monday 29th 1935. From the Brooks Family Collection.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During this period Wilfred was ‘a valuable member of the Colour Lithography Committee of the London Master Printers’ Association and was also a member of the London Central Districts Master Printers’ Association.’&lt;ref&gt;British &amp; Colonial Printer &amp; Stationer  Volume 100, Number 2. 13 January 1927, Page 22. ‘Who’s Who in the Printing &amp; Allied Trades; A Prominent London Lithographer’.&lt;/ref&gt; He was chairman of the Education Committee and member of the Advisory Sub-committee, with the London County Council School of Photo-Engraving and Lithography in Bolt Street, Fleet Street, and was an inspector of the London printing schools for the Board of Education.&lt;ref&gt;World Press News, Vol. 4, No. 81. 18 September 1930, Page 47. ‘Printer’s Who’s Who, W. Vincent Brooks’.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was later reported that business had been continuing with ‘fluctuating results up until 1919 and then had had a general upward trend in turnover. Dividends at the rate of 10% per annum were paid for each of the eight years to 1927.  Dividends for the four following years were lower and no dividends were paid after 1931. From 1932 to 1940 profits were earned in only two years namely, 1937 and 1938. In an effort to raise funds the lease on the premises was sold in 1939 but this did little to bring in new business which had been affected by the start of World War Two. Finally a creditor petitioned the Companies Court and a Winding-up Order was made on 5 February 1940.&lt;ref name="High Court"/&gt;

The official Receiver concluded his report stating that ‘the Receiver for the debenture holder is continuing the business in the hopes of disposing of it as a going concern, but he states that having regard to the specialised and somewhat ancient type of plant he doubts whether the assets will realise sufficient to discharge the debenture liability, particularly bearing in mind the somewhat heavy claims of the preferential creditors.’&lt;ref name="High Court"/&gt; 

==Sanders Phillips and Co.==
Sanders Phillips and Co. Ltd took over the company in the same year. Nine months later the Parker Street premises were destroyed by fire during an air raid,&lt;ref&gt;[http://awalkinhistory.blogspot.com/2008/05/friday-30th-may-blitz.html A Walk In History, The blitz. Online blog] "The Blitz was the bombing of London between 7 September 1940 and 11 May 1941, although there were of course sporadic attacks until the end of the war. In the old borough of Holborn, 650 buildings (that one seventh) were destroyed, 426 people were killed and 621 were seriously injured. This was the highest rate per capita in the whole of the country. A total of 282 high explosive bombs fell on Holborn and, in 19944 V1 and V2 rockets also fell here. There were no specific targets in the area, but because Holborn is very central, close to Kings Cross and Euston with their rail links to the north, and night bombing was not an exact science, Holborn suffered a great deal of damage. Theobalds Road, Red Lion Square, Red Lion Street and High Holborn suffered the worst of the damage, the worst two raids being on 16 and 17 April 1941 and 10 and 11 May 1941."&lt;/ref&gt; but the company, operating from London offices in Norfolk Street, Strand, son established Government contracts for reproducing maps for Bomber Command, plans for M.I.8, and, after ‘D’ Day, ‘communication maps’ which were collected by the R.A.F. and flown direct to France.

When these contracts ran out at the end of the war, it was decided to specialise in the reproduction of town and country planning maps. Typical of this work was a new series of land utilisation maps for King's College Geographic Department, which were produced in 11 colours.
Later examples include motorways and transport maps for the Greater London Council.

Sanders Phillips and Co became a part of the International Publishing Corporation (IPC) in 1963 operating as a subsidiary of the parent company. The IPC were in turn acquired by the Reed Group in 1969 who created Reed International plc to control its UK subsidiaries.

In 1976 Reed International sold off Vincent Brooks, Day &amp; Son to the firms chief draughtsman Sidney Reed. Up until his retirement in the 1990s Sidney Reed continued to run the company on a small-scale basis using outside printers, notably Round Square Ltd, to produce the work he had created. Round Square Ltd took ownership of Vincent Brooks, Day &amp; Son after Sidney Reed's retirement but went into liquidation themselves some time prior to 1999.

Ten years after this Sidney Reed's son Barry revived the company name and, although not currently trading, is keeping alive the name of the company that his father dedicated virtually his whole working life to.

'''''Wheatfield with Crows''''' is a July 1890 painting by [[Vincent van Gogh]]. It has been cited by several critics as one of his greatest works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B6JTCCBSZuoC&amp;pg=PA11|title=Cézanne to Picasso: Ambroise Vollard, Patron of the Avant-garde|page=11|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|date=2006|isbn=1588391957}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cqWFCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT101|title=Art, Literature and Culture from a Marxist Perspective|last=McKenna|first=Tony|publisher=Springer|date=2015|isbn=1137526610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is commonly stated that this was van Gogh's final painting. However, art historians are uncertain as to which painting was van Gogh's last, as no clear historical records exist. The evidence of his letters suggests that ''Wheatfield with Crows'' was completed around 10 July and predates such paintings as ''[[The Town Hall at Auvers|Auvers Town Hall on 14 July 1890]]'' and ''[[Daubigny's Garden]]''.&lt;ref name="Letter"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "VGM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vggallery.com/painting/by_period/auvers.htm| title=Auvers-sur-Oise: May – July 1890 (75 paintings) |publisher=vggallery.com|accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[Jan Hulsker]] points out that a painting of harvested wheat, ''Field with Stacks of Wheat'' (F771), must be a later painting.&lt;ref name= "Hulsker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hulsker|first=Jan|title=The Complete Van Gogh: Paintings, Drawings, Sketches|year=1986|work=[[Random House]]|isbn=0-517-44867-X|page=480}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The [[Van Gogh Museum]]'s ''Wheatfield with Crows'' was painted in July 1890, in the last weeks of van Gogh’s life. Many have claimed it as his last painting, while it is also possible ''[[Tree Roots]]'', or the previously mentioned ''Daubigny's Garden'', was his final painting.

''Wheat Field with Crows,'' made on a [[Double-squares and Squares#Van Gogh.27s Double-square canvases|double-square canvas]], depicts a dramatic, cloudy sky filled with crows over a wheat field.&lt;ref name= "VGM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=3343&amp;lang=en#moretotell |title=Wheat Field with Crows |work=Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sense of isolation is heightened by a central path leading nowhere and by the uncertain direction of flight of the crows. The windswept wheat field fills two-thirds of the canvas. &lt;!--- No! 3 paths, uncertain horizon etc "An empty path pulls the audience into the painting."---&gt; [[Jules Michelet]], one of van Gogh's favorite authors, wrote of crows: "They interest themselves in everything, and observe everything.  The ancients, who lived far more completely than ourselves in and with nature, found it no small profit to follow, in a hundred obscure things where human experience as yet affords no light, the directions of so prudent and sage a bird."&lt;!--- garbled and referenced next para anyway: Of making the painting Van Gogh wrote that he did not have a hard time depicting the sadness and emptiness of the painting, which was powerfully offset by the restorative nature of the countryside. ---&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards149"&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh and God: A Creative Spiritual Quest | author=Edwards, C | publisher=Loyola Press | location=Chicago | year=1989 | pages=78, 186 | isbn=0-8294-0621-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fYA9QzwvsekC&amp;pg=PA78 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kathleen Erickson finds the painting as expressing both sorrow and a sense of his life coming to an end.&lt;ref name="Erickson97"&gt;{{cite book | title=At Eternity's Gate: The Spiritual Vision Of Vincent Van Gogh | author=Erickson, K | publisher=William B.

[[File:Vincent van Gogh - Wheatfield Under Thunderclouds - VGM F778.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''[[Wheat Fields (Van Gogh series)|Wheatfield Under Thunderclouds]]'' (1890)]]

About 10 July 1890 van Gogh wrote to his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]] and his wife [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger|Jo Bonger]], saying that he had painted another three large canvases at [[Auvers-sur-Oise|Auvers]] since visiting them in Paris on 6 July.&lt;ref name="Letter"&gt;{{cite web|title=To Theo van Gogh and Jo van Gogh-Bonger. Auvers-sur-Oise, on or about Thursday, 10 July 1890|url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let898/letter.html|work=Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=[[Van Gogh Museum]]|accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of these are described as &lt;!--- source is "d'immenses" ---&gt; immense stretches of wheatfields under turbulent skies, thought to be ''[[Wheat Fields (Van Gogh series)|Wheatfield under Clouded Sky]]'' and ''Wheatfield with Crows'', and the third is ''[[Daubigny's Garden]]''. He wrote that he had made a point of expressing sadness, later adding "extreme loneliness" (''de la solitude extrême''), but also says he believes the canvases show what he considers healthy and fortifying about the countryside (and adds that he intended to take them to Paris as soon as possible).

Walther and Metzger, in ''Van Gogh: The Complete Paintings'', state that "There is nothing in van Gogh's words to support a simplistic interpretation along the lines of artistic ''angst'' and despair – nor is there any evidence for the widely-held belief that it was this painting that van Gogh had on his easel at the time he killed himself."&lt;ref name=ingo/&gt; They refer to a June 1880 letter of van Gogh's, in which he compared himself to a bird in a cage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To Theo van Gogh. Cuesmes, between about Tuesday, 22 and Thursday, 24 June 1880|url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let155/letter.html|work=Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=[[Van Gogh Museum]]|accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remark: "The crows in the painting, in other words, were an altogether personal symbol closely associated with van Gogh's own life".&lt;ref name=ingo&gt;{{cite book|title=Van Gogh: The Complete Paintings|year=2010|first1= Ingo F.|first2= Rainer|last1 = Walther|last2= Metzger|pages= 680–682|work=[[Taschen]]|isbn=3-8365-2299-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These painting are all examples of van Gogh's elongated double-square canvases, used exclusively by him in the last few weeks of his life, in June and July 1890.

The painting is held in the collection of the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in Amsterdam, as is ''Wheatfield under Clouded Sky''.
