'''Alan Charles Heyman''' (16 March 1931 – 1 March 2014) was a South Korean musicologist and composer. Born in the United States, he first came to South Korea in 1953 with the United States Army during the Korean War, and after completing a graduate degree in music education at [[Columbia University]], moved to South Korea permanently in 1960 to devote himself to research and composition. He led traditional Korean music troupes on tours of North America and Europe, and made significant contributions to the preservation of Korean traditional music, for which he was recognised with awards from national and international organisations. He [[relinquishment of United States nationality|gave up his U.S. citizenship]] to become a South Korean citizen in 1995, and remained in the country until his death in 2014.

==In the Korean War==
Heyman was born in [[New York City]] on 16 March 1931 to Charles and Lillian Heyman.&lt;ref name="KT20140304"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/issues/2014/03/178_152651.html|first=Fred Jeremy|last=Seligson|title=Korean music expert Heyman dies at 83|work=The Korea Times|date=2014-03-03|accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to attend the [[University of Colorado]], where he majored in music while also studying a [[pre-medical]] course, graduating in 1952.&lt;ref name="KT20140304"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SeoulShinmun20120802"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20120802025002|title='푸른 눈' 원로 국악학자 해의만의 국악사랑 50년|trans-title='Blue-eyed' elder Korean music scholar Hae Eui-man's 50 years of love for Korean music|work=[[Seoul Shinmun]]|date=2012-08-02|accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his graduation, Heyman was drafted into the United States Army.&lt;ref name="KH20110210"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20110210000860|first=Hahish|last=Boland-Rudder|title=Alan Heyman donates his collection of musical treasures to National Gugak Center|work=The Korea Herald|date=2011-02-10|accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially knew nothing about [[Korea]]; when informed by his senior officer that he would be stationed in [[Uijeongbu]] near the South Korean capital [[Seoul]], he asked, "Excuse me sir, in what part of Japan is Uijeongbu?" He would go on to serve as an army medic and lab technician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://einfo.usembassy.or.kr/koreanwar/his6.html|title=Interview with Mr. Alan Heyman, Army Medic and Lab Technician, Korean War|work=60th Anniversary of the Korean War {{ndash}} Oral Histories &amp; Video Files|publisher=Public Affairs Section, U.S. Embassy Seoul|accessdate=2014-03-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615021004/http://einfo.usembassy.or.kr/koreanwar/his6.html|archivedate=2015-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heyman was first exposed to East Asian music during his Korean War service.&lt;ref name="KH20110210"/&gt; In 1953, he was attached to a [[field hospital]] unit stationed in [[Gangwon Province (South Korea)|Gangwon Province]]. Chinese and North Korean forces stationed on a nearby mountain would often play loud drum, gong, and ''[[taepyeongso]]'' music over a loudspeaker late at night, using the sound as a [[non-lethal weapon]] to try to keep their enemies [[sleep deprivation|sleep-deprived]].&lt;ref name="KH20110617"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20110617000531|author=Kim Yoon-mi|title=Half a century with Korean music|work=The Korea Herald|date=2011-06-17|accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Heyman's comrades found the noise irritating.&lt;ref name="KH20110210"/&gt; However, it had the opposite effect on Heyman himself, who was enthralled by the music, describing it as "refreshing and interesting". During the war, he also met the woman who would become his first wife, a nurse.&lt;ref name="KH20110617"/&gt;

Heyman returned to the U.S. in 1954.&lt;ref name="SBS20110610"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sbs.co.kr/section_news/news_read.jsp?news_id=N1000928376|title=푸른 눈의 국악원로 해의만|trans-title=Blue-eyed Korean traditional musician Hae Eui-man|work=Seoul Broadcasting System|date=2011-06-10|accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that point, Heyman did not know the name of the instrument that had so fascinated him, the ''taepyeongso''. He would not find out until after his tour of duty had ended and he had entered [[Columbia University]] to start studying towards his master's degree in [[music education]]: a fellow graduate student from South Korea informed Heyman, based on the description he provided, that the sound he heard was that of the ''taepyeongso'', which he analogised to a "conical [[oboe]]".&lt;ref name="KH20110617"/&gt; That same friend would encourage Heyman to go back to South Korea and pursue his interest in Korean music.&lt;ref name="Wade215"&gt;{{cite book|first=James|last=Wade|title=One Man's Korea|publisher=Hollym|year=1967|oclc=900499|page=215|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to South Korea==
In 1960, the year after U.S. civilians could officially live in South Korea again, Heyman moved to [[Insa-dong]] in [[Seoul]]. He states that he was the only passenger on the [[Northwest Airlines]] flight which brought him back to the country.&lt;ref name="KH20110210"/&gt; He enrolled in the Korea Traditional Musical Arts Conservatory near his house, offering free English lessons in exchange for his studies. He also married the nurse whom he had met during the war.&lt;ref name="KH20110617"/&gt; He took on a variety of other odd jobs to support his family.&lt;ref name="Wade216"/&gt; As he was not yet fluent in the [[Korean language]] at the time, he faced numerous difficulties in his studies, though he later stated, "Luckily, in music one can learn much by example and observation, without the need for language."&lt;ref name="Wade216"&gt;{{harvnb|Wade|1967|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the ''taepyeongso'', he also learned to play a number of other [[traditional Korean musical instruments]], including the  ''[[gayageum]]'', the ''[[piri]]'', and the ''[[janggu]]'', as well as [[Korean dance]]s such as the ''[[talchum]]'' and dances related to ''[[nongak]]''.&lt;ref name="KT20140304"/&gt; Among his teachers was Im Bang-ul ([[:ko:임방울|임방울]]).&lt;ref name="Sisa20100908"/&gt; Though he eventually attained fluency in Korean, he later admitted he did not read [[hanja]] very well.&lt;ref name="KH20110210"/&gt;

Heyman was initially nervous whether he could find success in his chosen field, but his confidence and reputation grew after a 1962 performance he gave, the first in which a foreigner had performed Korean traditional music on stage. He recalled that "the audience was flabbergasted. They couldn't believe that they were seeing a foreigner perform Korean music."&lt;ref name="KH20110210"/&gt; He even performed for South Korean president [[Yun Bo-seon]].&lt;ref name="KT20140304"/&gt; In 1964, with the sponsorship of the [[Asia Society]], he organised a twenty-seven city tour of the U.S. for traditional Korean music group Sam Chun Li. Among the highlights, they performed at the [[Lincoln Center]] and on national television on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.&lt;ref name="Wade216"/&gt; However, the tour's success was damaged by negative rumours about their shows  spread by a rival musical group, which resulted in cancellations by 17 out of 27 universities where they had scheduled performances; their sponsors refused to pay the musicians their contracted wages, and Heyman had to make up the difference out of his own pocket.&lt;ref name="KH20110617"/&gt;

In 1973, Heyman led another troupe of [[National Gugak Center]] musicians on a tour of Europe. Again he ended up incurring unexpected expenses: the troupe arrived in [[Berlin]] and took a bus through [[East Germany]] on the way to the rest of Europe, but on the way back  to Berlin a South Korean consular official in Paris demanded they fly instead of taking the bus, fearing that East German authorities might detain the musicians and turn them over to the [[North Korea]]ns. Around that time, Heyman also considered moving back to the United States to take a position as an instructor in traditional Korean music and dance at [[Brown University]], but the university cancelled its plans to hire him at the last minute. Instead he chose to remain in South Korea. His first wife died after a protracted struggle with [[liver cancer]] in 1985, leaving him with large debts as the couple had lacked medical insurance to pay for her treatments.&lt;ref name="KH20110617"/&gt;

==Naturalisation and later life==
Heyman applied for naturalisation as a South Korean citizen in 1995, after more than thirty years of living in the country. He first faced a grueling naturalisation test, in which only two students passed the written portion; however, the oral portion was much simpler for him, as his interviewer asked him only to tell the tale of [[Heungbu and Nolbu]], which he knew quite well from his ''[[pansori]]'' studies.&lt;ref name="KH20110210"/&gt; As South Korea did not permit [[multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] at the time, he then gave up his U.S. citizenship. He took the [[Korean name]] Hae Eui-man.&lt;ref name="Sisa20100908"/&gt; In September 2010, he donated a large amount of the research materials he had collected over the years to the National Gugak Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=103&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0004836139|title=사람들: 국악 자료 기증한 해의만 씨|trans-title=People: Mr. Hae Eui-man, who donated materials on Korean music|work=Yonhap News|date=2010-12-24|accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his old age, Heyman suffered from declining health, in particular spinal problems, but maintained good humour about his physical limitations.&lt;ref name="KT20140304"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KH20110617"/&gt; Heyman died at his home in [[Hwagok-dong]], Seoul on the evening of 1 March 2014.&lt;ref name="Yonhap20140302"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/society/2014/03/02/0701000000AKR20140302034751004.HTML|title='푸른눈'의 원로 국악학자 해의만 선생 별세|trans-title='Blue-eyed' elder Korean music scholar Professor Hae Eui-man passes away|work=Yonhap News|date=2014-03-02|accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wake was held at [[Severance Hospital]] in [[Sinchon-dong, Seoul|Sinchon-dong]] two days later. He was survived by his second wife Choi Ok-ja, son Seong-gwang, also a scholar of Korean music, another son Seon-ju, an entrepreneur, and daughter Hay Laam, a professor at [[York University]] in Canada.&lt;ref name="KT20140304"/&gt;

==Music and scholarship==
In the 1960s, Heyman also began taking an interest in the music of [[Donald Sur]], a Hawaii-born composer whose works drew inspiration from the traditional music of his [[Korean immigration to Hawaii|Korean immigrant forebears]], as well as that of [[Alan Hovhaness]] and [[Lou Harrison]], who had both visited South Korea and were influenced by the music they encountered there. However, he was an opponent of attempts to adapt Korean music to Western sensibilities in the name of modernisation.&lt;ref name="Wade216"/&gt; In 1985, he was particularly critical of [[Hwang Byungki]]'s efforts in this regard in the composition ''Migung'', calling it "Hwang's one and only venture into the abstract madness of modern music, and it is surely hoped that it will remain just that", and recounting an anecdote of a woman who ran "screaming from the concert hall" upon hearing it performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Keith|last=Howard|title=Perspectives on Korean Music: Creating Korean music : tradition, innovation and the discourse of identity|work=Ashgate Publishing|year=2006|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AXd9i2YPlJUC&amp;pg=PA96 96]|isbn=9780754657293|postscript=}}. {{cite book|first=Andrew|last=Killick|title=Hwang Byungki: Traditional Music and the Contemporary Composer in the Republic of Korea|work=Ashgate Publishing|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=WgPsQhVg_SAC&amp;pg=PA146 146]–148]|year=2013|isbn=9781409420309|postscript=}}. Both cite {{cite journal|last=Heyman|first=Alan|title=Hwang Pyong-gi: Kayakum masterpieces|journal=Korea Journal|volume=25|number=1|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the odd jobs that Heyman took to support himself and his wife during his music studies in the 1960s, he composed [[film score]]s for various films set in South Korea; by 1968, he had nearly a dozen such credits to his name, mostly documentaries.&lt;ref name="KH20110617"/&gt; One non-documentary one was ''[[Northeast of Seoul]]'', a 1972 thriller directed by [[David Lowell Rich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmsdefrance.com/revs/FDF_Northeast_of_Seoul_1972_review.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140304095048/http://filmsdefrance.com/revs/FDF_Northeast_of_Seoul_1972_review.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-03-04 |title=Film Review: Northeast of Seoul (1972) |work=Films de France |accessdate=2014-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His English translation of Im Sok-jae's ''Mu-ga: The Ritual Songs of Korean Mudangs'', sponsored by the Korea Literature Translation Association, was published by Asian Humanities Press in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=108&amp;oid=044&amp;aid=0000039762|author=Kim Jin|title=Translation agency unveils more works|work=The Korea Herald|date=2003-12-13|accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/25075864|first=Keith|last=Howard|title=Book Review: ''Mu-ga: The Ritual Songs of the Korean Mudangs'' by Im Sok-jae; Alan C.

Heyman received various awards recognising his contributions to the study, preservation, and documentation of Korean traditional music. He received a [[UNESCO]] cultural award in 1991.&lt;ref name="SeoulShinmun20120802"/&gt; In 1995, he was awarded the South Korean government's [[Order of Cultural Merit (Korea)|Order of Cultural Merit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=103&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0003980305|title=국악발전 유공자 표창|trans-title=표창 for contributors to development of Korean music|work=Yonhap News|date=1995-03-31|accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Lee Myung-bak]] awarded Heyman the Silver Crown Order of Cultural Merit in April 2011 in recognition of his contributions to the National Gugak Center.&lt;ref name="KH20110617"/&gt; That month he also received an award from the National Gugak Center on the occasion of their 60th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.donga.com/3/all/20110413/36369359/1|title=국립국악원 개원 60주년 해의만 씨 등 29명 포상|trans-title=National Gugak Center awards prizes to Hae Eui-man and 28 others on their 60th anniversary|work=The Dong-A Ilbo|date=2011-04-13|accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, he was inducted into the [[Royal Asiatic Society Korea Branch]] as an honorary lifetime member.&lt;ref name="KH20110617"/&gt;

'''Biographical research''' is a [[qualitative research]] approach aligned to the social interpretive paradigm of research. The biographical research is concerned with the reconstruction of [[Life history (sociology)|life histories]] and the constitution of meaning based on biographical narratives and documents. The material for analysis consists of interview protocols ([[memorandum]]s), video recordings, photographs, and a diversity of sources. These documents are evaluated and interpreted according to specific rules and criteria. The starting point for this approach is the understanding of an individual [[biography]] in terms of its social constitution. The biographical approach was influenced by the [[symbolic interactionism]], the [[Sociology of knowledge|phenomenological sociology of knowledge]] ([[Alfred Schütz]], [[Peter L. Berger]], and [[Thomas Luckmann]]), and [[ethnomethodology]] ([[Harold Garfinkel]]). Therefore, biography is understood in terms of a [[Social constructionism|social construct]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge|last=Berger|first=Peter|last2=Luckmann|first2=Thomas|publisher=Anchor Books|year=1966|isbn=|location=Garden City, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the reconstruction of biographies can give insight on [[Figurational sociology|social processes and figurations]] (as in [[Norbert Elias]]), thus helping to bridge the gap between micro-, meso-, and macro- [[Level of analysis|levels of analysis]]. The biographical approach is particularly important in German sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.soziologie.de/de/sektionen/biographieforschung/portrait/|title=DGS - Deutsche Gesellschaft für Soziologie: Portrait|website=soziologie.de|language=DE|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is used in the [[Social science|Social Sciences]] as well as in [[Pedagogy]] and other disciplines.

== History of Biographical Research ==
[[Biography|Biographies]], including autobiographies, have always contained a sociological dimension since their advent in the Antiquity ([[Plutarch]]). For the most part of the usage of this notion, biographers dealt with outstanding individual personalities (such as politicians and artists) but there were also exceptions, such as [[Ulrich Bräker]]’s autobiography, “The Poor Man of Toggenburg” (''Der arme Mann im Toggenburg''). The emergence of [[Sociology]] influenced an approach to biography that extended this notion beyond the individual dimension, such as the works of [[Alphons Silbermann]] on the life of the composer [[Jacques Offenbach]] and [[Norbert Elias]] on the life of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mozart: Portrait of a Genius|last=Elias|first=Norbert|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0520084759|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biography as a form of access to larger groupings ===
The biographical method as a research approach to understand larger groupings was used as sociological material by [[Florian Znaniecki]] and [[W. I. Thomas|William Isaac Thomas]] in the 1920s. After their work, the biographical approach was considered amongst the dominant research approaches in empirical social research. The study ''[[The Polish Peasant in Europe and America]]'' (1918–1920) by Znaniecki and Thomas used an extensive collection of diaries, letters, [[memoir]]s, [[Autobiography|autobiographies]], and other personal and archival documents as main source for a sociological investigation. The reception of this work was initially late due to linguistic barriers, but it was then absorbed and disseminated in the [[Social Science Research Council]] (SSRC). The biographical research approach formed an important foundation for the development of the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]], which later influenced the [[symbolic interactionism]] and the work of sociologists such as [[Robert E. Park]], [[Ernest Burgess|Ernest W. Burgess]], and [[George Herbert Mead]].

Another milestone in the development of biographical research was the analysis of the [[Life course approach|life course]] of delinquent youths written by Clifford R. Shaw in 1930&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jack Roller. A Delinquent Boy's Own Story|last=Shaw|first=Clifford|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=978-0-415-70093-1|location=London|pages=|orig-year=1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Natural History of a Delinquent Career|last=Shaw|first=Clifford|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1968|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=|orig-year=1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1945, the interest in biographical research declined due to the success of [[Quantitative Methods|quantitative methods]] and [[Structural functionalism|structural-functionalist]] theories. The biographical approach influence was felt mainly in the study of [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]]. In 1978, [[Aaron Cicourel|Aaron Victor Cicourel]] published a case study on the [[Life history (sociology)|life history]] of a boy named Mark, that received special attention in the discipline of [[social work]]. Cicourel’s study explored in detail how a criminal career was constructed through [[Interrogation|police interrogation]], individual and distorted interpretations, and institutional [[document]]s.

=== Recent Biographical Research ===
Since the 1980s, biographical research gained momentum in the wake of a growing interest for qualitative social research. Biographical research is now a recognized  approach in sociology, especially in the German Sociological Tradition (see [[Fritz Schütze]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schütze|first=Fritz|date=2007|title=Biography Analysis on the Empirical Base of Autobiographical Narratives: How to Analyse Autobiographical Narrative Interviews - Part I|url=http://www.zsm.ovgu.de/zsm_media/Das+Zentrum/Forschungsprojekte/INVITE/B2_1-p-140.pdf|journal=University of Magdeburg|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Kohli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kohli|first=Martin|date=1986|title=Biographical Research in the German Language Area|url=|journal=A Commemorative Book in Honor of Florian Znaniecki|volume=|pages=91–110|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Werner Fuchs-Heinritz and others). This development was supported by a tendency to shift the sociological focus from [[system]] and [[structure]] to the [[lifeworld]], the [[everyday life]], and the resurgence of [[Phenomenological sociology|phenomenological approaches]] in sociology (under the influence of [[Edmund Husserl]]). The sociology turned to the reconstruction of biographical cases and individual life courses as a form to gain insight on [[Process|social processes]].

With the increasing pluralization of [[Lifeworld|life-worlds]], [[Modernization theory|modernization]], and [[Differentiation (sociology)|differentiation]] in [[Postmodernity|Postmodern societies]], the dissolution of [[Social conservatism|traditional values]] and the conference of meaning, the biographical approach proved useful to study these [[Social phenomenon|social phenomena]] of the turn of the millennium. The actor became an intersection of different and sometimes divergent determinants, logics, expectations, normative models, and institutionalized mechanisms of control (see [[Georg Simmel]]’s chapter “The Intersection of Social Circles”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sociology: inquiries into the construction of social forms|last=Simmel|first=Georg|publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV|year=2009|isbn=978-90-04-17321-7|location=Leiden, The Netherlands|pages=363–408}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The “normal biography” broke up and prompted the [[Individualism|individual]] to manage his life course on his own and to find solutions amongst different and contradictory influencing factors and [[Figurational sociology|figurations]]. In this situation, the self-discovered biographical [[Identity (social science)|identity]] with its [[Risk society|endangered transitions, breaks, and status changes]] becomes a conflict between institutional control and individual strategy.

The reconstructive approach in biographical research, which is connected to the phenomenological and [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] approaches, was methodologically developed by the German sociologist [[Gabriele Rosenthal]]. Rosenthal used principles of the method of [[Hermeneutics|objective hermeneutics]] and the reconstructive analysis of [[Ulrich Oevermann]], and the Gestalt and structure considerations proposed by [[Aron Gurwitsch]] and [[Kurt Koffka]] to develop a method for the reconstruction of biographical cases.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenthal|first=Gabriele|date=1993|title=Reconstruction of Life Stories: Principles of selection in generating stories for narrative biographical interviews|url=https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/bitstream/handle/document/5929/ssoar-tnsl-1993-1-rosenthal-reconstruction_of_life_stories.pdf?sequence=1|journal=The Narrative Study of Lives|volume=1 |issue=1|pages=59–91|via=SSOAR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.univerlag.uni-goettingen.de/bitstream/handle/3/isbn-978-3-86395-374-4/rosenthal_interpretive.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=Interpretive Social Research.

== Methods and Limitations of the Biographical Research ==

=== Individual Cases and Inductive Generalizations ===
In the context of qualitative researches, the biographical research is to be seen as a case-reconstructive approach. The decision to reconstruct cases is in itself an approach to the field rather than a specific [[Research|research method]]. Biographical  research does not use a single method for [[data analysis]]. The most commonly used methods for [[Data collection|data construction]] in biographical research is the biographical narrative interview (see Fritz Schütze&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) and/or [[Open-ended question|open interviews]]. Many use [[content analysis]] to analyze the biographical data. The diversity of biographical sources turns an [[Inductive reasoning|inductive approach]], as used in quantitative social research, unfruitful. The logic of an [[abductive reasoning]] process is preferred by many researchers that use the biographical approach. The principles of a [[grounded theory]] (as in [[Barney Glaser]] and [[Anselm Strauss]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Discovery of Grounded Theory|last=Glaser|first=Barney|last2=Strauss|first2=Anselm|publisher=Aldine Press|year=1967|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are often applied alongside a biographical research.

The questions regarding the possibility to use individual cases to create [[Generalization|scientifically valid generalizations]] arise from the use of the [[abductive reasoning]]. This is que question of the sustainability of abductive conclusions (as in [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]). The abductive conclusion that biographical cases are socially relevant and bear general patterns of [[behavior]], [[Agency (philosophy)|action]], and [[Hermeneutics|interpretation]] in them is common in sociological practice, although some think that it is not yet fully developed. Different approaches to the development of typologies exist, as well as for the contrastive comparison between types in order to allow for [[Theory|theoretical generalizations]] (see Uta Gerhardt, 1984; Gabriele Rosenthal, 1993;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and Susann Kluge, 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kluge|first=Susann|date=2000|title=Empirically Grounded Construction of Types and Typologies in Qualitative Social Research|url=http://www.qualitative-research.net/index.php/fqs/article/view/1124/2499|journal=Forum: Qualitative Social Research|volume=1 |issue=1|pages=|via=FQS}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Experienced Life History and Narrated Life Story (''erlebte und erzählte Lebensgeschichte'') ===
A fundamental problem exists regarding the differences between the levels of the experienced (''erlebte'') [[Life history (sociology)|life history]] and the [[Narrative|narrated]] (''erzählte'') life story.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another fundamental implication is the interrelation of [[experience]], [[memory]], and [[narration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenthal|first=Gabriele|date=2006|title=The Narrated Life Story: On the Interrelation Between Experience, Memory and Narration|url=http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/4894/2/Chapter_1_-_Gabriele_Rosenthal.pdf|journal=Narrative, Memory &amp; Knowledge: Representations, Aesthetics, Contexts|volume=|pages=1–16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early studies of biographical research, great value was placed on the reconstruction of the actual life course of the individual using data from additional sources (such as institutional archives, diaries, interviews with relatives and friends, etc.) and thus eliminating “errors” in the memory and presentation of the interviewee. Today – according to the phenomenological “bracketing” of the being of objects (as by the grounded theory principles) – it is increasingly assumed that the actual life course cannot be reconstructed: experiences are always interpreted by the subject and are mediated by perception, thus constituting the memory in regard to the framework of the overall biography as well as to the situation (for more, see [[Erving Goffman]]n notion of [[frame analysis]]) where the narrative is collected.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Thus, the main concern of the biographical research should be the life as experiences and narrated by subjects in clear contrast to the “true facts” of a life course reconstruction. Interpretations and constructions of meaning are of utmost importance to reconstruct a biographical case, as the actions and the self-interpretation of these actions by the individual turns his own biography into a coherent totality. Based on empirical experiences with narrated life history and using the research method of biographical narrative interviews, the method of biographical case reconstruction has developed in the last decades in fields that range from the study of migration&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Apitzsch|first=Ursula|last2=Siouti|first2=Irini|date=2007|title=Biographical Analysis as an Interdisciplinary Research Perspective in the Field of Migration Studies|url=https://www.york.ac.uk/res/researchintegration/Integrative_Research_Methods/Apitzsch%20Biographical%20Analysis%20April%202007.pdf|journal=University of York, UK|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to professional careers and healthcare.

=== Reconstruction of the Latent Structures of Meaning ===
The question of the construction of meaning leads to the questions of the subjectively intended and the objective meaning. Ulrich Oevermann says that an actor in a situation of interaction produces more meaning than he is aware of. Therefore, some researchers consider the task of the biographical research to be the reconstruction of both types of meaning – the intended and the objective.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Oevermann|first=Ulrich|last2=Tilman|first2=Allert|last3=Konau|first3=Elisabeth|last4=Krambeck|first4=Jürgen|date=1987|title=Structures of Meaning and Objective Hermeneutics|url=|journal=In: Volker Meja, Dieter Misgeld, Nico Stehr (Eds.): Modern German Sociology|volume=|pages=436–447|isbn=978-0-231-05854-4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behind and below the interpretations expressed by the interviewees are the latent structures of meaning that constitute the sense of life and manifest themselves in biographical life situations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In these latent, hidden patterns of meaning, individual experience and societal conditioning are intertwined. Thus, behind individual action lies a direction and a framework for action. According to Heinz Bude, the method of [[objective hermeneutics]] and reconstruction of structures of meaning is used in biographical research as a method for the reconstruction of the latent structures of meaning at play in specific situations of a case&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bude|first=Heinz|date=1984|title=Rekonstruktion von Lebenskonstruktionen.

[[Image:Taraxacum sect. Ruderalia MHNT.jpg|thumb|right|Wind dispersal of [[dandelion]] seeds.]]

'''Biological dispersal''' refers to both the movement of individuals ([[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungi]], [[bacteria]], etc.) from their birth site to their breeding site ('natal dispersal'), as well as the movement from one breeding site to another ('breeding dispersal').
Dispersal is also used to describe the movement of [[propagule]]s such as [[seed]]s and [[spore]]s.
Technically, dispersal is defined as any movement that has the potential to lead to [[gene flow]].&lt;ref name=Ronce&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ronce, O. |year=2007|title= How does it feel to be like a rolling stone?

The act of dispersal involves three phases: departure, transfer, settlement and there are different fitness costs and benefits associated with each of these phases.&lt;ref name=Bonte&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bonte, D. |author2=Van Dyck, H. |author3=Bullock, J.

Through simply moving from one habitat [[Landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|patch]] to another, the dispersal of an individual has consequences not only for individual [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], but also for [[population dynamics]], [[population genetics]], and [[species distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dunning, J.

Biological dispersal may be contrasted with [[geodispersal]], which is the mixing of previously isolated populations (or whole biotas) following the erosion of geographic barriers to dispersal or gene flow (Lieberman, 2005;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lieberman|year= 2005|title= Geobiology and paleobiogeography: tracking the coevolution of the Earth and its biota|journal= Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |volume=219|pages= 23–33|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2004.10.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2004.10.012|title=Geobiology and paleobiogeography: Tracking the coevolution of the Earth and its biota|year=2005|last1=Lieberman|first1=Bruce S.|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|volume=219|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albert and Reis, 2011&lt;ref name="AlbertReis2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James S.

Dispersal can be distinguished from [[animal migration]] (typically round-trip seasonal movement), although within the [[population genetics]] literature, the terms '[[migration (disambiguation)|migration]]' and 'dispersal' are often used interchangeably.

== Types of dispersal ==
[[File:Dispersal diagram.jpeg|thumb|Dispersal from parent population]]
Some organisms are motile throughout their lives, but others are adapted to move or be moved at precise, limited phases of their life cycles. This is commonly called the '''dispersive phase''' of the life cycle. The strategies of organisms' entire life cycles often are predicated on the nature and circumstances of their dispersive phases.

In general there are two basic types of dispersal:
; Density-independent dispersal: Organisms have evolved adaptations for dispersal that take advantage of various forms of kinetic energy occurring naturally in the environment. This is referred to as density independent or passive dispersal and operates on many groups of organisms (some [[invertebrate]]s, [[fish]], [[insect]]s and [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] organisms such as [[plant]]s) that depend on animal [[dispersal vector|vectors]], wind, gravity or current for dispersal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Maguire Jr., B.|year= 1963|title= The passive dispersal of small aquatic organisms and their colonization of isolated bodies of water|doi=10.2307/1948560|jstor=1948560|volume=33|journal=Ecological Monographs|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nathan, R.|year=2001|title=The challenges of studying dispersal|url=http://bio.huji.ac.il/ese/PDFs/Nathan2001TREE.pdf|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(01)02272-8|volume=16|issue=9|pages=481|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928204701/http://www.bio.huji.ac.il/ese/PDFs/Nathan2001TREE.pdf|archivedate=2013-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Density-dependent dispersal: Density dependent or active dispersal for many animals largely depends on factors such as local [[population]] size, resource [[competition]], [[habitat]] quality, and habitat size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Johst, K.  |author2=Brandl, R.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1997|title= The effect of dispersal on local population dynamics|doi=10.1016/S0304-3800(97)00112-9|journal= Ecological Modelling|volume=104|pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bowler&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bowler, D.

Due to population density, dispersal may relieve pressure for resources in an ecosystem, and competition for these resources may be a selection factor for dispersal mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Irwini, A.J.  |author2=Taylor, P.D.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007|title= Evolution of Dispersal in a Stepping-Stone Population with Overlapping Generations|pmid=11162790|url=http://www.mast.queensu.ca/~peter/pdf/TPB%2058%2000.pdf|journal= Theoretical Population Biology|volume=58|issue=4|pages=321–8|doi=10.1006/tpbi.2000.1490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dispersal of organisms is a critical process for understanding both geographic isolation in evolution through [[gene flow]] and the broad patterns of current geographic distributions ([[biogeography]]).

A distinction is often made between '''natal dispersal''' where an individual (often a juvenile) moves away from the place it was born, and '''breeding dispersal''' where an individual (often an adult) moves away from one breeding location to breed elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Ronce /&gt;

==Costs and benefits ==
[[File:Epilobium hirsutum - Seed head - 3.jpg|thumb|230px|Epilobium hirsutum - Seed head]]

In the broadest sense, dispersal occurs when the fitness benefits of moving outweigh the costs.

There are a number of benefits to dispersal such as locating new resources, escaping unfavorable conditions, avoiding competing with [[sibling]]s, and avoiding breeding with closely related individuals which could lead to [[inbreeding depression]].&lt;ref name=Bowler/&gt;

There are also a number of costs associated with dispersal, which can be thought of in terms of four main currencies: energy, risk, time and opportunity.&lt;ref name=Bonte/&gt;
Energetic costs include the extra energy required to move as well as energetic investment in movement machinery (e.g. wings). Risks include increased injury and mortality during dispersal and the possibility of settling in an unfavorable environment.
Time spent dispersing is time that often cannot be spent on other activities such as growth and reproduction.
Finally dispersal can also lead to [[outbreeding depression]] if an individual is better adapted to its natal environment than the one it ends up in. In social animals (such as many birds and mammals) a dispersing individual must find and join a new group, which can lead to loss of social rank.&lt;ref name=Bonte/&gt;

== Dispersal range ==

"Dispersal range" refers to the distance a species can move from an existing population or the parent organism. An [[ecosystem]] depends critically on the ability of individuals and [[populations]] to disperse from one habitat [[Landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|patch]] to another. Therefore, biological dispersal is critical to the stability of ecosystems.

=== Environmental constraints ===

Few species are ever evenly or randomly distributed within or across [[landscapes]]. In general, [[species]] significantly vary across the landscape in association with environmental features that influence their reproductive success and population persistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Groom MJ, Meffe GK, Carroll CR |year= 2005|isbn=0-87893-597-5|title= Principles of Conservation Biology|place= Sunderland (MA)|publisher= Sinauer Associates, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Martin TE|year= 1998|title= Are microhabitat preferences of coexisting species under selection and adaptive? |journal=Ecology| volume=79|issue=2|pages=656–670|url=http://www.umt.edu/mcwru/personnel/martin/PDF%20Martin/Reprint550.pdf|doi=10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[0656:AMPOCS]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spatial patterns in environmental features (e.g. resources) permit individuals to escape unfavorable conditions and seek out new locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Turner MG, Gardner RH, O'Neill, Robert V |year= 2001|title= Landscape Ecology: In theory and practice, pattern and process|place= New York |publisher=Springer|isbn=0-387-95123-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the organism to "test" new environments for their suitability, provided they are within animal's geographic range. In addition, the ability of a species to disperse over a gradually changing environment could enable a population to survive extreme conditions. (i.e. [[climate change]]).

As the climate changes, prey and predators have to adapt to survive. This poses a problem for many animals, for example the [[Southern rockhopper penguin|Southern Rockhopper Penguins]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.cebc.cnrs.fr/publipdf/2003/TMEPS251.pdf|title = Geographic variation in the foraging behaviour, diet and chick growth of rockhopper penguins|last = Tremblay|first = Yann|date = April 11, 2003|journal = Marine Ecology Progress Series|doi = 10.3354/meps251279|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These penguins are able to live and thrive in a variety of climates due to the penguins' phenotypic plasticity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Penguin responses to climate change in the Southern Ocean|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01909.x/abstract|journal = Global Change Biology|date = 2009-07-01|issn = 1365-2486|pages = 1618–1630|volume = 15|issue = 7|doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01909.x|first = Jaume|last = Forcada|first2 = Philip N.|last2 = Trathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are predicted to respond by dispersal, not adaptation this time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is explained due to their long life spans and slow microevolution. Penguins in the subantarctic have very different foraging behavior than the subtropical waters, it would be very hard to survive and keep up with the fast changing climate because these behaviors took years to shape.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Dispersal barriers ===

A dispersal barrier may mean that the dispersal range of a species is much smaller than the species distribution. An artificial example is [[habitat fragmentation]] due to human land use. Natural barriers to dispersal that limit species distribution include mountain ranges and rivers. An example is the separation of the ranges of the two species of [[chimpanzee]] by the [[Congo River]].

On the other hand, human activities may also expand the dispersal range of a species by providing new dispersal methods (e.g., [[Ballast water discharge and the environment|ships]]). Many of them become [[invasive species|invasive]], like [[rat]]s and [[stinkbugs]], but some species also have a slightly positive effect to human settlers like [[honeybees]] and [[earthworm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/05/jamestown/charles-mann-text/2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dispersal mechanisms ==

Most [[animal]]s are capable of [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]] and the basic mechanism of dispersal is movement from one place to another. Locomotion allows the organism to "test" new environments for their suitability, provided they are within the animal's range. Movements are usually guided by inherited [[behavior]]s.

The formation of barriers to dispersal or gene flow between adjacent areas can isolate populations on either side of the emerging divide.  The geographic separation and subsequent genetic isolation of portions of an ancestral population can result in speciation.

=== Plant dispersal mechanisms ===
[[File:Bur Macro BlackBg.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bur]]s are an example of a seed dispersion mechanism which uses a biotic vector, in this case [[animal]]s with [[fur]].]]
{{Main article|Seed dispersal}}
[[Seed dispersal]] is the movement or transport of [[seed]]s away from the parent plant. Plants have limited mobility and consequently rely upon a variety of [[dispersal vector]]s to transport their propagules, including both [[abiotic]] and [[Biotic component|biotic]] vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the parent plant individually or collectively, as well as dispersed in both space and time.  The patterns of seed dispersal are determined in large part by the dispersal mechanism and this has important implications for the demographic and genetic structure of plant populations, as well as migration patterns and [[species]] interactions.  There are five main modes of seed dispersal: gravity, wind, ballistic, water and by animals.

=== Animal dispersal mechanisms ===

==== Non-motile animals ====
There are numerous animal forms that are non—motile, such as [[sea sponge|sponges]], [[bryozoan]]s, [[tunicate]]s, [[sea anemone]]s, [[coral]]s, and [[oyster]]s. In common, they are all either [[ocean|marine]] or aquatic. It may seem curious that plants have been so successful at stationary life on land, while animals have not, but the answer lies in the food supply. Plants produce their own food from sunlight and [[carbon dioxide]]—both generally more abundant on land than in water. Animals fixed in place must rely on the surrounding medium to bring food at least close enough to grab, and this occurs in the three-dimensional water environment, but with much less abundance in the atmosphere.

All of the marine and aquatic [[invertebrate]]s whose lives are spent fixed to the bottom (more or less; anemones are capable of getting up and moving to a new location if conditions warrant) produce dispersal units. These may be specialized "buds", or motile sexual reproduction products, or even a sort of alteration of generations as in certain [[cnidaria]].

Corals provide a good example of how sedentary species achieve dispersion. Corals reproduce by releasing sperm and eggs directly into the water. These release events are coordinated by lunar phase in certain warm months, such that all corals of one or many species on a given reef will release on the same single or several consecutive nights. The released eggs are fertilized, and the resulting [[zygote]] develops quickly into a multicellular ''[[planula]]''. This motile stage then attempts to find a suitable substratum for settlement. Most are unsuccessful and die or are fed upon by zooplankton and bottom dwelling predators such as anemones and other corals. However, untold millions are produced, and a few do succeed in locating spots of bare limestone, where they settle and transform by growth into a '''''polyp'''''. All things being favorable, the single polyp grows into a coral head by budding off new polyps to form a colony.

==== Motile animals ====
{{main article|Animal locomotion|Animal migration}}
The majority of all animals are [[Motility|motile]]. Although motile animals can, in theory, disperse themselves by their spontaneous and independent locomotive powers, a great many species utilize the existing kinetic energies in the environment, resulting in passive movement. Dispersal by water currents is especially associated with the physically small inhabitants of marine waters known as [[plankton|zooplankton]]. The term plankton comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]], πλαγκτον, meaning "wanderer" or "drifter".

====Dispersal by dormant stages====
Many animal species, especially freshwater invertebrates, are able to disperse by wind or by transfer with an aid of larger animals (birds, mammals or fishes) as dormant eggs, dormant embryos or, in some cases, dormant adult stages. [[Tardigrades]], some [[rotifers]] and some [[copepods]] are able to withstand desiccation as adult dormant stages. Many other taxa ([[Cladocera]], [[Bryozoa]], [[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]], [[Copepoda]] and so on) can disperse as dormant eggs or embryos. Freshwater [[sponges]] usually have special dormant propagules called [[gemmulae]] for such a dispersal. Many kinds of dispersal dormant stages are able to withstand not only desiccation and low and high temperature, but also action of digestive enzymes during their transfer through digestive tracts of birds and other animals, high concentration of salts and many kinds of toxicants. Such dormant-resistant stages made possible the long-distance dispersal from one water body to another and broad distribution ranges of many freshwater animals.

== Quantifying dispersal ==

Dispersal is most commonly quantified either in terms of rate or distance.

Dispersal rate (also called [[Net migration rate|migration rate]] in the [[population genetics]] literature) or probability describes the probability that any individual leaves an area or, equivalently, the expected proportion of individual to leave an area.

The dispersal distance is usually described by a '''dispersal kernel''' which gives the [[probability distribution]] of the distance traveled by any individual. A number of different functions are used for dispersal kernels in theoretical models of dispersal including the [[negative exponential distribution]],&lt;ref name=Chapman&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Chapman, D.

== Consequences of dispersal ==
Dispersal not only has costs and benefits to the dispersing individual (as mentioned above), but it also has consequences at the level of the [[population]] and [[species]] as well.

Most populations have a patchy spatial distribution. Dispersal, by moving of individuals between different sub-populations, can increase the overall [[landscape connectivity|connectivity]] of the population, helping to minimize the risk of [[stochastic]] extinction, since if a sub-population goes [[extinct]] by chance, it is likely to be recolonized if the dispersal rate is high.
Increased connectivity can also decrease the degree of local adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lenormand, T. |year=2002|title= Gene flow and the limits to natural selection|journal= Trends in Ecology and Evolution |volume=17|issue=4|pages= 183–189|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02497-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30675">'''Biology [[Monte Carlo methods]] (BioMOCA)''' have been developed at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] to simulate ion transport in an electrolyte environment through ion channels or nano-pores embedded in membranes.&lt;ref name="Straaten"&gt;T.A. van der Straaten, G. Kathawala, A. Trellakis, R.S. Eisenberg, and U. Ravaioli, Molecular Simulation, 31, 151 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; It is a 3-D particle-based [[Monte Carlo]] simulator for analyzing and studying the ion transport problem in ion channel systems or similar nanopores in wet/biological environments. The system simulated consists of a protein forming an ion channel (or an artificial nanopores like a Carbon Nano Tube, CNT), with a membrane (i.e. lipid bilayer) that separates two ion baths on either side. BioMOCA is based on two methodologies, namely the [[Boltzmann equation|Boltzmann transport]] Monte Carlo (BTMC)&lt;ref name="Jacoboni"&gt;C. Jacoboni, P. Lugli, The Monte Carlo Method for Semiconductor Device Simulation, Springer Verlag, New York (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; and particle-particle-particle-mesh (P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;M).&lt;ref name="Hockney"&gt;R. Hockney, J. Eastwood, Computer Simulation Using Particles, McGraw-Hill, New York (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; The first one uses Monte Carlo method to solve the Boltzmann equation, while the later splits the electrostatic forces into short-range and long-range components.

==Backgrounds==
In full-atomic [[molecular dynamics]] simulations of [[ion channel]]s, most of the computational cost is for following the trajectory of water molecules in the system. However, in BioMOCA the water is treated as a continuum dielectric background media. In addition to that, the [[protein]] atoms of the ion channel are also modeled as static point charges embedded in a finite volume with a given dielectric coefficient. So is the [[lipid membrane]], which is treated as a static dielectric region inaccessible to ions. In fact the only non-static particles in the system are ions. Their motion is assumed classical, interacting with other ions through electrostatic interactions and pairwise [[Lennard-Jones potential]]. They also interact with the water background media, which is modeled using a scattering mechanism.

The ensemble of ions in the simulation region, are propagated synchronously in time and 3-D space by integrating the equations of motion using the second-order accurate leap-frog scheme. Ion positions ''r'' and forces ''F'' are defined at time steps ''t'', and ''t''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''dt''. The ion velocities are defined at ''t''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;''dt''/2, ''t''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''dt''/2. The governing finite difference equations of motion are

:&lt;math&gt;
\vec{v}(t+\frac{dt}{2})
= \vec{v}(t-\frac{dt}{2}) + \vec{F}(t) \, dt
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\vec{r}(t+dt)= \vec{r}(t-dt) + \vec{v}(t+\frac{dt}{2}) \, dt
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''F'' is the sum of electrostatic and pairwise ion-ion interaction forces.

===Electrostatic field solution===
The [[electrostatic potential]] is computed at regular time intervals by solving the [[Poisson’s equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla (\varepsilon (r)\nabla \phi (r,t))
= -(\rho_\text{ions}(r,t) + \rho_\text{perm}(r))
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho_\text{ions}(r,t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho_\text{perm}(r)&lt;/math&gt; are the charge density of ions and permanent charges on the protein, respectively. &lt;math&gt;\epsilon (r)&lt;/math&gt; is the local [[dielectric constant]] or [[permittivity]], and &lt;math&gt;\phi (r,t)&lt;/math&gt; is the local electrostatic potential. Solving this equation provides a self-consistent way to include applied bias and the effects of image charges induced at dielectric boundaries.

The ion and partial charges on protein residues are assigned to a finite rectangular grid using the cloud-in-cell (CIC) scheme.&lt;ref name="Hockney"/&gt; Solving the Poisson equation on the grid counts for the particlemesh component of the P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;M scheme. However, this discretization leads to an unavoidable truncation of the short-range component of electrostatic force, which can be corrected by computing the short-range charge-charge [[Coulomb's law|Coulombic interactions]].

===Dielectric coefficient===
Assigning the appropriate values for dielectric permittivity of the protein, membrane, and aqueous regions is of great importance. The dielectric coefficient determines the strength of the interactions between charged particles and also the [[dielectric|dielectric boundary forces]] (DBF) on ions approaching a boundary between two regions of different permittivity. However, in nano scales the task of assigning specific permittivity is problematic and not straightforward.

The protein or membrane environment could respond to an external field in a number of different ways.&lt;ref name="Straaten"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reza"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Warshel"&gt;A. Warshel, S.T. Russell, Q. Rev. Biol., 17, 283 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schutz"&gt;C.N. Schutz, A. Warshel, Proteins, 44, 400 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Warshel2"&gt;A. Warshel, A. Papazyan, Curr Opin Struct Biol., 8, 211 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Field induced dipoles, reorientation of permanent dipoles, protonation and deprotonation of protein residues, larger scale reorganization of ionized side-chains and water [[molecules]], both within the interior and on the surface of the protein, are all examples of how complicated the assignment of permittivity is. In MD simulations, where all the charges, [[dipoles]], and field induced atomic dipoles are treated explicitly then it is suggested that a dielectric value of 1 is appropriate. However, in reduced-particle ion simulation programs, such as ours, where the protein, membrane, and water are continuum backgrounds and treated implicitly, and on top of that, the ion motion takes place on the same time-scale as the protein’s response to its presence, it is very difficult to assign the dielectric coefficients. In fact, changing the dielectric coefficients could easily alter the channel characteristics, such as ion permeation and selectivity The assignment of dielectric coefficient for water is another key issue. The water molecules inside ion channels could be very ordered due to tapered size of the pore, which is often lined with highly charged residues, or hydrogen bond formation between water molecules and protein.&lt;ref name="Roux"&gt;B. Roux, T. Allen, S. Berneche, W. Im, Q. Rev. Biophys., 37, 15 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the dielectric constant of water inside an ion channel could be quite different from the value under bulk conditions. To make the matter even more complicated, the dielectric coefficients of water inside [[nanopore]]s is not necessarily an isotropic scalar value, but an [[anisotropic]] tensor having different values in different directions.

===Anisotropic permittivity===
It has become evident that the [[macroscopic]] properties of a system do not necessarily extend to the molecular length scales.  In a recent research study carried by Reza Toghraee, R. Jay Mashl, and Eric Jakobsson at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign,&lt;ref name="Reza"&gt;Reza Toghraee, J. R. Mashl, K.I. Lee, E. Jakobsson, U. Ravaioli,  Journal of Computational Electronics, 8, 98, (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; they used Molecular Dynamics simulations to study the properties of water in featureless hydrophobic cylinders with diameters ranging from 1 to 12&amp;nbsp;nm. This study showed that water undergoes distinct transitions in structure, dielectric properties, and [[Electrical mobility|mobility]] as the tube diameter is varied. In particular they found that the dielectric properties in the range of 1 to 10&amp;nbsp;nm is quite different from bulk water and is in fact anisotropic in nature.
Though, such featureless [[hydrophobic]] channels do not represent actual ion channels and more research has to be done in this area before one could use such data for ion channels, it is evident that water properties like [[permittivity]] inside an ion channel or nano-pore could be much more
complicated that it has been thought before. While a high axial dielectric constant shields ion’s electrostatic charges in the axial direction (along the channel), low radial dielectric constant increases the interaction between the mobile ion and the partial charges, or the dielectric charge images on the channel, conveying stronger selectivity in ion channels.

Solving the [[Poisson equation]] based on an anisotropic permittivity has been incorporated into BioMOCA using the box integration discretization method,&lt;ref name="Selberherr"&gt;[[Siegfried Selberherr|S. Selberherr]], Analysis and Simulation of Semiconductor Devices, New York, Springer-Verlag Wien, (1984). {{ISBN|3-211-81800-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been briefly described below.

==Calculations==

===Box integration discretization===
In order to use box integration for discretizing a D-dimensional Poisson equation
:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla (\varepsilon \nabla \varphi) = \rho
&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; being a diagonal ''D''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''D'' tensor, this differential equation is reformulated as an integral equation. Integration the above equation over a D-dimensional region &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, and using Gauss theorem, then the integral formulation is obtained
:&lt;math&gt;
\oint_{\partial \Omega} \hat{n} (\varepsilon \nabla \varphi)
= - \int_\Omega \rho
&lt;/math&gt;

In this appendix it is assumed to be a two-dimensional case. Upgrading to a three-dimensional system would be straightforward and legitimate as the Gauss theorem is also valid for the one and three dimensions. &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be given on the rectangular regions between nodes, while &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is defined on the grid nodes (as illustrated on figure at the right).

[[File:F1.gif|thumb|Box integration for a two-dimensional tensor product grid. The integration region is indicated by the dashed rectangle. Charges are assumed to be given on the same nodes as potential]]

The integration regions &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; are then chosen as rectangles centered around node and extending to the 4 nearest neighbor nodes. The gradient &lt;math&gt;\nabla \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is then approximated using centered difference normal to the boundary of the integration region &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, and average &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; over the integration surface &lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega&lt;/math&gt; . This approach allows us to approximate the left hand side of the Poisson equation above in first order as
:&lt;math&gt;
\oint_{\partial \Omega} \hat{n}(\varepsilon \nabla \varphi)
= \frac{\varphi_{i+1,j} - \varphi_{i,j}}{h_i^x}
\left ( \frac{h^y_j}{2} \epsilon^x_{i,j} + \frac{h^y_{j-1}}{2} \varepsilon^x_{i,j-1} \right )
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
{} - \frac{\varphi_{i,j} - \varphi_{i-1,j}}{h_{i-1}^x}
\left ( \frac{h^y_j}{2} \epsilon^x_{i-1,j} + \frac{h^y_{j-1}}{2} \varepsilon^x_{i-1,j-1} \right )
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
{} + \frac{\varphi_{i,j+1} - \varphi_{i,j}}{h_{j}^y}
\left ( \frac{h^x_i}{2} \varepsilon^y_{i,j} + \frac{h^x_{i-1}}{2} \varepsilon^y_{i-1,j} \right )
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
{} - \frac{\varphi_{i,j} - \varphi_{i,j-1}}{h_{j-1}^y}
\left ( \frac{h^x_i}{2} \varepsilon^y_{i,j-1} + \frac{h^x_{i-1}}{2} \varepsilon^y_{i-1,j-1} \right )
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^y&lt;/math&gt; are the two components of the diagonal of the tensor &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.
Discretizing the right-hand side of the Poisson equation is fairly simple. &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is discretized on the same grid nodes, as it's been done for &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{\Omega_i} \rho = \text{Volume}(\Omega_i) \rho_i
&lt;/math&gt;

===Ion size===
The finite size of ions is accounted for in BioMOCA using pairwise [[Coulomb's law|repulsive forces]] derived from the 6–12 [[Lennard-Jones potential]]. A truncated-shifted form of the Lennard-Jones potential is used in the simulator to mimic ionic core repulsion. The modified form of the Lennard-Jones pairwise potential that retains only the repulsive component is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
U_{LJ}(r_{ij}) =
\begin{cases}
4\epsilon_{LJ} \left (\left (\frac{\sigma_{ij}}{r_{ij}}\right )^{12} - \left (\frac{\sigma_{ij}}{r_{ij}}\right )^6 \right ) + \epsilon_{LJ}
&amp; r_{ij} &lt; 2^{1/6} \sigma_{ij} \\
0 &amp;  r_{ij} &gt; 2^{1/6} \sigma_{ij}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{LJ}&lt;/math&gt; is the Lennard-Jones energy parameter and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}=(\sigma_i + \sigma_j)/2&lt;/math&gt; is the average of the individual Lennard-Jones distance parameters for particles ''i'' and ''j''. Using a truncated form of the potential is computationally efficient while preventing the ions from overlapping or coalescing, something that would be clearly unphysical.

===Ion-protein interaction===
Availability of high-resolution X-ray crystallographic measurements of complete [[molecular structures]] provides information about the type and location of all atoms that forms the protein. In BioMOCA the protein atoms are modeled as static point charges embedded in a finite volume inaccessible to the ions and associated with a user-defined dielectric coefficient. Moreover, a number of force-field parameters are available that provide information about the charge and radii of atoms in different amino-acid groups. The conjunction of the molecular structure and force fields provide the coordinates, radii, and charge of each atom in the protein channel. BioMOCA uses such information in the standard PQR (Position-Charge-Radius) format to map the protein system onto a rectangular grid.

Ideally, the steric interactions between protein atoms and the ions in the aqueous medium are to use a repulsive potential like [[Lennard-Jones]] to prevent ions from penetrating the protein. As this approach could add a significant load to the amount of calculations, a simpler approach is chosen that treats the protein surfaces as predetermined hard wall boundaries. Many recent open source molecular biology packages have built-in facilities that determine the volume accessible to ions in a protein system. The Adaptive Poisson Boltzmann Solver (APBS) scheme&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;N.A. Baker, D. Sept, M.J. Holst, J.A. McCammon, IBM J. Res. Dev., 45, 427 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; has been incorporated to BioMOCA to obtain the accessible volume region and therefore partition the simulation domain into continuous regions.

Ions are deemed to have access to protein and lipid regions and if any point within the finite-size of ionic sphere crosses the protein or membrane boundary, a collision is assumed and the ion is reflected diffusively.

===Ion-water interactions===
As a reduced particle approach, BioMOCA replaces the explicit water molecules with continuum background and handles the ion-water interactions using BTMC method, in which, appropriate scattering rates should be chosen. In other words, ion trajectories are randomly interrupted by scattering events that account for the ions’ [[Molecular diffusion|diffusive motion]] in water.&lt;ref name="Straaten"/&gt; In between these scattering events, ions follow the Newtonian forces. The free flight times, ''T&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'', are generated statistically from the total scattering rate according to

:&lt;math&gt;
-\ln(r) = \int^{T_f}_0 \lambda (\vec{p}(t)) \, dt
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r'' is a random number uniformly distributed on the unit interval. &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, a function of [[momentum]], is the total [[scattering]] rate for all [[collision]] mechanisms. At the end of each free flight, the ion’s velocity is reselected randomly from a Maxwellian distribution. As the correct scattering mechanism for ion-water interactions in nonbulk electrolyte solutions has yet to be developed, a position dependent scattering rate linked to the local diffusivity is used in our model. This dependency on position comes from the fact that water molecules can have different order of organization in different regions, which will affect the [[scattering rate]].

===Position-dependent diffusivity===
It is widely accepted that the ions and water molecules do not have the same mobility or diffusivity in confined regions as in bulk.&lt;ref name="Jacoboni"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schutz"/&gt; In fact, it is more likely to have a lessening in the [[electron mobility|effective mobility]] of ions in ion channels.&lt;ref name="Warshel"/&gt; In reduced particle methods where the channel water is assumed as implicit continuum background, a mean ion mobility is needed to reveal how ions could diffuse due to local [[electrostatic forces]] and random events. In Transport Monte Carlo simulations, the total scattering rate (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;), is assumed to only result from ion-water interactions; it is related to ion diffusivity with the expression

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{kT}{mD}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the mass of the ion and ''D'' is its diffusion constant. As the equation indicates, reduced diffusivity of ions inside the lumen of the channel renders to increased incidence of scattering events.

===Hydration shells===
In addition to having a diffusive effect on [[ion transport]], water molecules also form hydration shells around individual ions due to their polar nature. The hydration shell not only shields the charge on ions from other ions but also modulates the ion radial distribution function causing the formation of peaks and troughs. The average minimum distance between two ions is increased as there is always at least one layer of water molecules present between them, acting as a physical deterrent preventing two ions from getting too close to each other, in a manner that is similar to the short-range repulsive component of the Lennard-Jones potential.

The theory of hydration shells is well developed in the physical chemistry literature however a simple model is required that captures the essential effects with as little computational overhead as possible. For this purpose the same pairwise potential discussed by Im and Roux&lt;ref name="Im"&gt;W. Im, B. Roux, J. Mol. Biol., 322, 851 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; is implemented to include the effect of hydration shells.

:&lt;math&gt;
U_{hy} = c_0 \exp \left (\frac{c_1 - r}{c_2} \right )
cos(c_3(c_1 - r)\pi ) + c_4 \left (\frac{c_1}{r} \right )^6
&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients ''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' were determined empirically for a 1 M [[KCl]] solution, using MD simulations to benchmark the ion radial distribution functions against Equilibrium [[Monte Carlo simulations]]. The effect of hydration shells was found to be important in simulations at higher salt concentrations where the conductance of many ion channels, porin among them, is observed to saturate as the salt concentration in the electrolyte baths is further increased. Earlier simulations that did not include a model of hydration shells did not reproduce the conductance saturation behavior. This suggests an additional repulsive potential acting to prevent ion crowding, and hence limiting the concentration of ions and current density in the confined space of the pore even at high bath salt concentration. When the repulsive potential was included moderate channel [[Electrical conductance|conductance]] was observed.

==Conditions and methods==

===Boundary conditions===
The electrical and physiological properties of ion channels are experimentally measured by inserting the channel into a lipid membrane separating two baths containing solutions of specific concentrations. A constant electrostatic bias is applied across the channel by immersing the electrodes in the two baths. Formulating [[boundary conditions]] that accurately represent these contact regions may require enormously large bath regions and is a challenging task. Beyond a Debye length from the membrane the electrostatic potential and ion densities do not vary appreciably. This assumption has been supported by the results of continuum results presented earlier.&lt;ref name="Straaten37"&gt;T. A. van der Straaten, J. M. Tang, U. Ravaioli, R. S. Eisenberg and N. Aluru, J. Comp. Elect. 2, 29 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; For typical salt concentrations used in ion channel simulations, the [[Debye length]] is of the order of 10 Å. Using the assumption, [[Dirichlet boundary conditions]] are imposed on the potential at the two domain boundary planes that are transverse to the channel, taking care that these planes are sufficiently far from the membrane.

The other problem in duplicating the experimental conditions is the problem of maintaining fixed charge density in the two baths. This problem is treated by maintaining the specified density in two buffer regions extending from the boundary plane toward the membrane. The number of ions needed to maintain the density in the two buffer regions is calculated at the start of the simulations. The count of the ions in these buffers is sampled throughout the simulation and an ion is injected whenever a deficit is observed. The initial velocity of the injected particle is decided according to Maxwellian distribution. It should be noted that the ions can leave the system only by exiting through the two Dirichlet boundary planes and an ion is not removed artificially from these buffer regions. The reflections from the [[Neumann boundary condition|Neumann boundary planes]] are treated as [[Reflection seismology|elastic reflections]].

===Multi-grids and grid focusing method===
{{inappropriate person|section|we|date=April 2011}}
In all most any of the methods in simulation of ion channels, the major computational cost comes from the calculation of electrostatic forces acting on the ions. In continuum models, for instance, where [[Charge density|ionic density]] exist rather than explicit ions, the electrostatic potential is calculated in a self-consistent manner by solving the Poisson equation. In MD simulations, on the other hand, the [[electrostatic forces]] acting on the particles are calculated by explicit evaluation of the Coulombic force term, often splitting the short-range and long-range electrostatic forces so they could be computed with different methods. In our model as a reduced particle method, the longrange electrostatic forces are evaluated by solving the [[Poisson equation]] and augmenting the forces so obtained with a short-range component. By solving the Poisson equation it is possible to self-consistently include the forces arising from the bias to the system, while this is a difficult issue to be addressed in MD simulations.

Currently there are two Poisson solvers implemented in BioMOCA based on the [[finite difference method]]. One uses the pre-conditioned [[conjugate gradient method|Conjugate Gradient scheme]] (pCG) and is used by default. The later is borrowed from an APBS solver, which uses a V-multi-grid scheme. Other than the numerical approach to solve the Poisson equation, the main difference between the two solvers is on how they address the [[permittivity]] in the system. In the first solver, a dielectric value is assigned to each cell in the grid, while in the APBS solver the dielectric coefficients are defined on the grid nodes. As discussed earlier box integration method is used in the pCG solver, which allows us to treat the Poisson equation in the most accurate way. Even though a full multigrid solver based on box-integration method has been under development, there is a neat way to reuse the already exiting code and treat the ion channel systems.

Ion channel simulations require the presence of large bath regions for accurate treatment of screening.&lt;ref name="Straaten"/&gt; There being of such bath regions make the mesh domain of Poisson equation large and leads to either a large number of grid points with fine mesh resolution or a small number of grid points with very coarse discretization. From bulk simulations a coarse mesh is sufficient for describing the baths using the P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;M scheme. However, a fine resolution is required in the channel domain because of the highly charged nature of these regions and the presence of spatially varying dielectric regions. Besides the ultimate interest is to study the channel behavior in terms of ion [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]], selectivity, gating, density, etc.… In other words, it is better off to put more computational resources in the channel region, and bare minimum in the baths to reduce the overall computational cost and speed up our simulations from weeks to perhaps days instead.
A scheme based on the grid focusing method has been developed that makes it possible to satisfy the requirement of large bath region and a fine grid resolution in channel at the same time in a computationally effective way. This methodology also allows us to have multiple fine mesh domains, which may be needed to describe multiple pore channels like OmpF porin, or an array of ion channels sharing the same bath regions or even having yet finer meshes inside a fine mesh for relatively large channels with narrow ion passages like [[Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor|Nicotine receptor channel]].&lt;ref name="Hai-Long"&gt;Hai-Long Wang, Reza Toghraee, D. Papke, X. L. Cheng, J. A. McCammons, U. Ravaioli, and S. M. Sine, Biophysical Journal, 96, 3582, (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first grid is coarse mesh spanning the entire problem domain including the bath regions and the channel region. The second grid (and so on for any other grids, 3rd, 4th, etc.) is a relatively much finer mesh that spans a sub-domain of the system containing the region that requires fine resolution like the channel pore. The Poisson equation is first solved on the coarse mesh with all the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, taking into account the applied bias. Next the [[boundary conditions]] for the secondary meshes are obtained by interpolating from the first or previous solutions of the Poisson equation. The Poisson equation is solved again for the finer meshes using the new boundary conditions. In this way, electrostatic fields with different mesh discretization for different regions can be generated.

===EMF and DBF===
The [[Electromotive force|electro-motive-force]] (EMF) is the measurement of the energy needed for a charged particle like ion to cross the ion channel embedded in a membrane. Part of this potential energy barrier is due the interaction between the crossing ion and the permanent/partial charges on the protein residues. The other part comes from the induced dipoles in the protein/membrane dielectric medium, and is referred as dielectric-boundary-force (DBF). To compute the DBF alone, one may turn off all the static charges on the protein residues and drag the ion through the pore and compute the energy barrier using
:&lt;math&gt;
P_{DBF} = \int -d \hat{z}. \vec{E}
&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to note that EMF or DBF measurements are just qualitative measurements, as an ion does not necessarily cross the channel through the center of its lumen in a straight line and it is often accompanied by other ions moving in the same or opposite directions, which dramatically changes the dynamics of the system. Moreover, unlike steered MD calculations where the protein residues dynamically reposition themselves as an ion or ions are bouncing across the channel, in our EMF or DBF calculations protein is modeled as a static continuum, which further affects the energy calculations in a more quantitative way. Another issue that additionally impacts the measurements is absence of water hydration molecules, which move with the ion and shield part of its charge. Having said all of above, still computing EMF or DBF is valuable to address channel selectivity or gating. Computing either of these two energy barriers is available as an option in BioMOCA.

===Visualization using VMD===
[[File:Visual Molecular Dynamics visualization.jpg|thumb|VMD visualization of Gramicidin 1MAG molecule along with the structure generated by BioMOCA, where green represents protein, red addresses the membrane (i.e. lipid), and purple is the channel and left and right baths]]
[[Visual Molecular Dynamics|VMD]]&lt;ref name="ks"&gt;http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd&lt;/ref&gt; was equipped with the option of loading BioMOCA structures. This is a very useful feature as one could load both the protein  structure (i.e. PDB or PQR file) along with the structures generated by BioMOCA to make comparisons. Figure at the right shows how BioMOCA has generated a structure for [[Gramicidin|Gramicidin channel]] with a membrane wrapped around it. Furthermore, BioMOCA also dumps the ion trajectories in standard formats so they could be later loaded to molecular visualization tools such as VMD and watched frame by frame in a movie format.

===Recording trajectories in binary===
Other than counting the number of ions crossing the channel, sometimes it is desirable to study their behavior at different regions of the channel. Such examples would be the average occupancy of ions or their average moving velocity inside the channel or a nanopore. BioMOCA has been equipped with the option of dumping every ions position, average and instantaneous velocities, [[potential energy|potential]] and [[kinetic energy|kinetic energies]], average and instantaneous displacements and other info at every step (or few steps) of the simulations in ASCII format, so such trajectory information could be studied later on to gather further statistics. From a technical point of view however, dumping such information for tens of ions, even at every few hundreds of time steps, could slow down the simulations and end up with huge files accumulating to tens of gigabytes. Loading such files later on from disk storage is also a very time consuming and computationally inefficient procedure. Over and above that, recoding the numerical information in [[ASCII]] format does not hold its machine precision and has loss of accuracy.

Solving such problems is actually an easy task and it is simply to avoid using [[ASCII]] format and use binary format instead. Not only it preserves the machine accuracy but also writing and reading to file system is a lot faster. The computational overhead to dump the trajectories becomes negligible and the trajectory files become about two orders of magnitude smaller in size. The downside might be that programming and decoding the data could become very tricky, but once it’s done correctly and with care, the advantages of using binary format are well worth the extra effort. BioMOCA is now equipped with the tools to record the trajectory information in [[binary format]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5607">A '''biorefinery''' is a facility that integrates biomass conversion processes and equipment to produce fuels, power, heat, and value-added chemicals from [[biomass]]. The biorefinery concept is analogous to today's [[petroleum refinery]], which produce multiple fuels and products from [[petroleum]].&lt;ref&gt;Dr W J Smith, Tamutech Consultancy. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/mapping-the-development-of-uk-biorefinery-complexes-nnfcc-07-008 Mapping the Development of UK Biorefinery Complexes], NNFCC, 2007-06-20.

The [[International Energy Agency]] Bioenergy Task 42 on Biorefineries has defined biorefining as the sustainable processing of biomass into a spectrum of bio-based products (food, feed, chemicals, materials) and bioenergy (biofuels, power and/or heat).

By producing multiple products, a biorefinery takes advantage of the various components in biomass and their intermediates therefore maximizing the value derived from the biomass feedstock. Some researcher have considered the exploration of a biorefinery as a practical method of improving the economic performance of stand-alone biomass to bioenergy system since biochemicals are produced&lt;ref&gt;1.

Journal of Cleaner Production 142 .1583-1608&lt;/ref&gt; A biorefinery could, for example, produce one or several low-volume, but high-value, chemical or [[nutraceutical]] products and a low-value, but high-volume liquid transportation fuel such as [[biodiesel]] or [[bioethanol]] (see also [[alcohol fuel]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]].

Retrieved on 2011-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time generating electricity and process heat, through [[combined heat and power]] (CHP) technology, for its own use and perhaps enough for sale of electricity to the local utility. The high-value products increase profitability, the high-volume fuel helps meet energy needs, and the power production helps to lower energy costs and reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from traditional power plant facilities.  Although some facilities exist that can be called bio-refineries, the bio-refinery has yet to be fully realized. Future biorefineries may play a major role in producing chemicals and materials that are traditionally produced from [[petroleum]].

==Examples==
The fully operational [[Blue Marble Energy]] company has multiple biorefineries located in Odessa, WA and Missoula, MT.

Canada's first Integrated Biorefinery, developed on anaerobic digestion technology by [[Himark BioGas]] is located in [[Hairy Hill, Alberta]]. The Biorefinery utilizes Source Separated Organics from the metro [[Edmonton]] region, Open Pen Feedlot Manure, and Food Processing Waste.

Several potential biorefinery examples have been proposed, starting from feedstocks such as [[tobacco]], [[flax]] [[straw]] and the residues from the production of [[bioethanol]].&lt;ref&gt;Cedric Briens, Jan Piskorz and Franco Berruti, "Biomass Valorization for Fuel and Chemicals Production -- A Review," 2008.

A '''blast wall''' is a barrier designed to protect vulnerable buildings or other structures and the people inside them from the effects of a nearby [[explosion]], whether caused by [[industrial accident]], military action or [[terrorism]].

== Effectiveness ==
Research by [[Cranfield University]] [[Defence College of Management and Technology|Defence Academy]], building on earlier work, has shown that blast walls have the following properties:
* A non-deforming upright wall will significantly reduce the peak blast [[overpressure]] and impulse in an area between 4 and 6 wall heights behind it
* Similar protection occurs at greater distances behind the wall, but to a diminishing extent
* Blast walls perform best if the explosion is relatively close to the front of the wall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civ.uth.gr/cost-c26/documents/6th%20meeting_Timisoara/presentations/WG3/10.Smith%20-%20Blast%20walls.pdf |title=THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BLAST WALLS |last1=Smith |first1=Peter |last2= |first2= |date= |website=www.civ.uth.gr/ |publisher=Department of Civil Engineering, University of Thessaly |accessdate=6 November 2014}} (p. 5)&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Canopied" walls (with a top section overhanging the front face) show some improved blast protection over plane walls
* A 90-degree canopy is more effective than a 45-degree one&lt;ref&gt;Smith p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;
* Walls containing sand or water work well, and cause little damage if they fail
* A wall has to stay intact long enough to "interact" with the blast in order to have any effect&lt;ref&gt;Smith p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meditation''' and its effect on '''brain activity''' and the [[central nervous system]] became a focus of collaborative research in [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]] and [[neurobiology]] during the latter half of the 20th century. [[Research on meditation]] sought to define and characterize various practices. Meditation’s effect on the brain can be broken up into two categories: state changes and trait changes, respectively alterations in brain activities during the act of meditating and changes that are the outcome of long-term practice.

[[Mindfulness]] meditation is frequently studied, a [[Buddhist meditation]] approach found in [[Zen]] and [[Vipassana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Essentials of Buddhism |last=Mizuno |first=Kogen |year=1972 |publisher=Kosei Publishing Company |location=Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vipassana : A Universal Buddhist Meditation Technique |last=Ahir |first=D.C. |year=1999 |publisher=Sri Satguru Publications |location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] describes mindfulness meditation as a complete, unbiased attention to the current moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wherever You Go, There You Are : Mindfulness Meditation in Everyday Life 
 |last=Kabat-Zinn |first=Jon |year=1998 |publisher=Hyperion |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes in brain state==

=== Electroencephalography===
[[Electroencephalography]] (EEG) has been used in many studies as a primary method for evaluating the meditating brain.  Electroencephalography uses electrical leads placed all over the scalp to measure the collective electrical activity of the [[cerebral cortex]].  Specifically, EEG measures the electric fields of large groups of neurons.  EEG has the benefit of excellent temporal resolution and is able to measure aggregate activity of portions or the entire cortex down to the millisecond scale.  Unlike other imaging based methods, EEG does not have good spatial resolution and is more appropriately used to evaluate the running spontaneous activity of the cortex.  This spontaneous activity is classified into four main classifications based on the frequency of the activity, ranging from low frequency delta waves (&lt; 4&amp;nbsp;Hz) commonly found during sleep to beta waves (13–30&amp;nbsp;Hz) associated with an awake and alert brain.  In between these two extremes are theta waves (4–8&amp;nbsp;Hz) and alpha waves (8–12&amp;nbsp;Hz).

Many studies on mindfulness meditation, assessed in a review by Cahn and Polich in 2006, have linked lower frequency alpha waves, as well as theta waves, to meditation.&lt;ref name="Cahn"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cahn BR, Polich J |title = Meditation states and traits : EEG, ERP, and neuroimaging studies|pmid=16536641 |journal = Psychological Bulletin |volume = 132 |pages = 180–211 |year = 2006 &lt;!--|accessdate = 2011-09-06--&gt; |issue=2 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.132.2.180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much older studies report more specific findings, such as decreased alpha blocking and increased frontal lobe specific theta activity.&lt;ref name="Kasamatsu"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kasamatsu KH, Hirai T |title = An electroencephalographic study on the zen meditation (Zazen) |journal = Folia Psychiatrica et Neurologica Japonica |volume = 20 |pages = 315–336 |year = 1966 &lt;!--|accessdate = 2011-09-06--&gt; |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1819.1966.tb02646.x |pmid=6013341 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alpha blocking is a phenomenon where the active brain, normally presenting beta wave activity, cannot as easily switch to alpha wave activity often involved in memory recall.  These findings would suggest that in a meditative state a person is more relaxed but maintains a sharp awareness.  Two large, recent comprehensive review works, however, point to poor control and statistical analyses in these early studies and comment that it can only be said with confidence that increased alpha and theta wave activity exists.&lt;ref name="Cahn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chiesa"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Chiesa A, Serretti, A |title = A systematic review of neurobiological and clinical features of mindfulness meditations |journal = Psychological Medicine |volume = 40 |issue = 8 |pages = 1239–1252 |year = 2010 &lt;!--|accessdate = 2011-09-06--&gt; |doi=10.1017/S0033291709991747 |pmid=19941676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroimaging===
[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) is another highly utilized methodology for studying state changes in meditating brains.  fMRI detects subtle increases in blood flow to areas of the brain with higher metabolic activity.  Thus these areas of increased metabolic activity indicate which regions of the brain are currently being used to process whatever stimuli presented.  Counter to EEG, the advantage of fMRI is its spatial resolution, with the ability to produce detailed spatial maps of brain activity.  It suffers, however, in temporal resolution and cannot measure progressive activity, like the EEG, with much detail.

====Topographical findings====
As a relatively new technology, fMRI has only recently been used to assess brain state changes during meditation.  Recent studies have shown heightened activity in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], [[frontal lobe|frontal cortex]], and [[prefrontal cortex]], specifically in the dorsal medial prefrontal area during Vipassana meditation.&lt;ref name="Holzel"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Holzel BK, Ott U, Hempel H, Hackl A, Wolf K, Stark R, Vaitl D |title = Differential engagement of anterior cingulate and adjacent medial frontal cortex in adept meditators and non-meditators |journal = Neuroscience Letters |volume = 421 |pages = 16–21 |year = 2007 &lt;!--|accessdate = 2011-09-06--&gt; |doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2007.04.074 |pmid=17548160}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the [[cingulate cortex]] and [[frontal cortex]] areas were shown to have increased activity during Zen meditation.&lt;ref name="Pagnoni"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pagnoni G, Cekic M, Guo Y |title = ‘ Thinking about not- thinking’: neural correlates of conceptual processing during Zen meditation |journal = PLoS ONE |volume = 3 |pages = e3083 |year = 2008 &lt;!--|accessdate = 2011-09-06--&gt; |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0003083}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both studies comment on the possibility that these findings could indicate some state of heightened voluntary control over attention during mindfulness meditation.  Review works by Cahn and Chiesa state that these results indicate consistency in meditation’s effect on these regions of the brain, citing a multitude of other studies spanning other meditative disciplines, but mention the need for further investigation with better controls.&lt;ref name="Cahn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chiesa" /&gt;

====Study on meditation and emotion====
The review by Cahn also notes findings describing a heightened emotional state of meditators.  A more complex study, conducted in 2008 by Lutz et al., focused on emotional response during meditation.&lt;ref name="Lutz"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lutz A, Brefczynski-Lewis J, Johnstone T, Davidson RJ |title = Regulation of the Neural Circuitry of Emotion by Compassion Meditation: Effects of Meditative Expertise |journal = PLoS ONE |volume = 3 |issue=3 |pages = e1897 |year = 2008 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001897 |pmid=18365029 |pmc=2267490}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This investigation involved the creation of a “compassion meditation” state by novice and experienced meditators and testing the meditators response to emotionally charged sounds.  fMRI results indicated heightened activity in the cingulate cortex but also in the [[amygdala]], temporo-parietal junction, and right posterior [[superior temporal sulcus]] in response to the emotional sounds.  The authors of this study believe this indicates greater sensitivity to emotional expression and positive emotion due to the neural circuitry activated.&lt;ref name="Lutz" /&gt;

==Changes in brain due to the prolonged practice==

===Electroencephalography===
Similar to research into state changes in brain function, older studies make more specific claims about trait changes in meditators versus non-meditators. Changes to the alpha wave were indicated to be a trait, as well as state, phenomena. Studies have reported an increase in the specific frequencies expressed in the alpha range, increased alpha band power, and an overall slowing (reduction in frequency) in EEG activity in experienced meditators versus less experienced meditators while meditating.&lt;ref name="Kasamatsu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stigsby"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stigsby B, Rodenberg JC, Moth HB |title = Electroencephalographic findings during mantra meditation (transcendental meditation). A controlled, quantitative study of experienced meditators |journal = Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology |volume = 51 |pages = 434–442 |year = 1981 &lt;!--|accessdate = 2011-09-06--&gt; |doi=10.1016/0013-4694(81)90107-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The alpha blocking phenomena, observed as a state change in brain function, was investigated as a possible trait change as well.  One study that examined a variety of meditation techniques tried to show that alpha blocking was affected by the long term practice of meditation by testing response to auditory stimuli.&lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Becker DE, Shapiro D |title = Physiological responses to clicks during Zen, yoga, and TM meditation |journal = Psychophysiology |volume = 18 |pages = 694–699 |year = 1981 &lt;!--|accessdate = 2011-09-06--&gt; |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01846.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Review works, however, comment on inconsistent findings as well as a lack of repeated results in this, and other studies.  They further remark that, similar to observations in brain state changes, only general assertions can be made about brain trait changes: some change in the electroencephalographic profile exists but with some inconsistency.&lt;ref name="Cahn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Andersen J |title = Meditation meets behavioural medicine: The story of experimental research on meditation |journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume = 7 |pages = 17–73 |year = 2000&lt;!--|accessdate = 2011-09-06--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important to note that these trait changes were observed during meditation, and although it does indicate that a practitioner’s electroencephalographic profile is modified by the practice of meditation, these EEG studies have not yet shown changes in non-meditating brains, even of experienced meditators.

[[File:Hippocampus.gif|thumb|left|Red region of the brain shows the [[hippocampus]] which had been shown to have heightened activity during meditation by experienced meditators.]]

===Neuroimaging===
Brain trait changes have also been observed in neuroimaging studies, most often employing fMRI. In a [[meta-analysis]] of 21 neuroimaging studies, eight brain regions were found to be consistently altered, including areas key to meta-awareness (frontopolar cortex/[[Brodmann area 10]]), exteroceptive and interoceptive body awareness ([[sensory cortex]] and [[insular cortex]]), memory consolidation and reconsolidation ([[hippocampus]]), self and emotion regulation ([[anterior cingulate cortex]] and [[orbitofrontal cortex]]), and intra- and interhemispheric communication (superior longitudinal fasciculus; [[corpus callosum]])&lt;ref name="Fox 48–73"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fox|first=Kieran C.R.|author2=Nijeboer, Savannah |author3=Dixon, Matthew L. |author4=Floman, James L. |author5=Ellamil, Melissa |author6=Rumak, Samuel P. |author7=Sedlmeier, Peter |author8= Christoff, Kalina |title=Is meditation associated with altered brain structure? A systematic review and meta-analysis of morphometric neuroimaging in meditation practitioners|journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|date=June 2014|volume=43|pages=48–73|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.03.016 |pmid=24705269}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes were distinguished by density increases in [[grey matter]] regions and [[white matter]] pathways in the brains of individuals who meditate in comparison to individuals who do not. Of all areas with reported findings, a greater number of structural changes were found in the left hemisphere.
   
There is also evidence to suggest meditation plays a protective role against the natural reduction in [[grey matter]] volume associated with aging. One study found evidence that Zen meditators experienced a slower age related decline rate for cerebral gray matter volume in the [[putamen]] which plays a role in learning, cognitive flexibility and attentional processing &lt;ref name="Pagnoni2"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pagnoni G, Cekic M |title = Age effects on gray matter volume and attentional performance in Zen meditation |journal = Neurobiology of Aging |volume = 28 |pages = 1623–1627 |year = 2007 |doi = 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2007.06.008 |pmid = 17655980 |issue = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could suggest a better attentiveness in aging meditators versus non-meditators.

Long-term meditation practitioners have also shown to have a higher tolerance for pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=J. A.|author2=Rainville, P.|title=Pain Sensitivity and Analgesic Effects of Mindful States in Zen Meditators: A Cross-Sectional Study|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|date=5 January 2009|volume=71|issue=1|pages=106–114|doi=10.1097/psy.0b013e31818f52ee}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect has been correlated to altered function and structure in somatosensory cortices and an increased ability to decouple regions in the brain associated with the cognitive appraisal of pain ([[anterior cingulate cortex]] and [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=Joshua A.|author2=Courtemanche, Jérôme |author3=Rainville, Pierre |title=A non-elaborative mental stance and decoupling of executive and pain-related cortices predicts low pain sensitivity in Zen meditators|journal=Pain|date=January 2011|volume=152|issue=1|pages=150–156|doi=10.1016/j.pain.2010.10.006|pmid=21055874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brain state changes found in meditators are almost exclusively found in higher-order executive and association cortices.&lt;ref name="Fox 48–73"/&gt; This supports the notion that meditation increases self-regulation and attentiveness. Recent studies have also investigated how these changes may alter the functionality and connectivity of the [[default mode network]], which is a hypothesized network of brain regions that are active when an individual is engaged in internal tasks such as daydreaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jang|first=Joon Hwan|author2=Jung, Wi Hoon |author3=Kang, Do-Hyung |author4=Byun, Min Soo |author5=Kwon, Soo Jin |author6=Choi, Chi-Hoon |author7= Kwon, Jun Soo |title=Increased default mode network connectivity associated with meditation|journal=Neuroscience Letters|volume=487|issue=3|pages=358–362|doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2010.10.056 |pmid=21034792 |date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Validity of findings===
In the meta-analysis performed by Fox et al., several sources of bias were indicated which bring into question the validity of meditation studies which use neuroimaging. Fox et al. suggests a publication bias may be leading to the over-reporting of significant results.&lt;ref name="Kieran C.R 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fox|first=Kieran C.R.|author2=Nijeboer, Savannah |author3=Dixon, Matthew L. |author4=Floman, James L. |author5=Ellamil, Melissa |author6=Rumak, Samuel P. |author7=Sedlmeier, Peter |author8= Christoff, Kalina |title=Is meditation associated with altered brain structure? A systematic review and meta-analysis of morphometric neuroimaging in meditation practitioners|journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|volume=43|pages=48–73|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.03.016 |pmid=24705269 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, however, Fox et al. found "consistent differences in prefrontal cortex and body awareness regions" in "areas key to meta-awareness..., exteroceptive and interoceptive body awareness..., memory consolidation and reconsolidation..., self and emotion regulation..., and intra- and interhemispheric communication..." and that changes were significant with "moderate" global median effect size and "consistent and medium-sized brain structure differences."&lt;ref name="Kieran C.R 2014" /&gt;

More research will be needed before any firm conclusions can be made.

==Popular literature==

===Positive portrayal===
Besides scientific literature, some authors have written of the promising [[research on meditation]] in books targeted for general audiences.  One such book, Buddha’s Brain by Rick Hanson, PhD shares the current scientific research and investigations into meditation.&lt;ref name=Hanson&gt;{{cite book |title=Buddha’s Brain: The Practical Neuroscience of Happiness, Love, and Wisdom |last=Hanson |first=Rick |year=2009 |publisher=New Harbinger Publication, INC |location=Oakland, CA|isbn=978-1572246959}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hanson, a neuroscientist and researcher, explains to readers the scientific studies in plain language and discuss the impact of the results.  Hanson’s main argument is that positive emotions, like love can be strengthened through meditation in a neuroplastic manner, citing dozens of scientific studies to support this claim.&lt;ref name=Hanson /&gt;  Hanson’s viewpoint is representative of a larger popular movement to study and embrace Eastern phenomena including meditation in the Western world.

===Rebuttal===
Critics, like Owen Flanagan, PhD, believe that Hanson, and those like him, are overextending the results of current scientific studies.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}  In his book ''Bodhisattva’s Brain: Buddhism Naturalized'', Flanagan presents a more conservative viewpoint of current scientific research and cautions readers against the seemingly exciting results of recent studies.&lt;ref name=Flanagan&gt;{{cite book |title= Bodhisattva’s Brain: Buddhism Naturalized |last=Flanagan |first=Owen |year=2011 |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0262016049}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Flanagan does not believe current science supports the idea that positive emotion can be strengthened in the same way that stroke victims can recover use of limbs with use.&lt;ref name=Flanagan /&gt;  Flanagan does acknowledge that meditation may be beneficial in some way, but the mechanism of how meditation affects the brain is still clouded.&lt;ref name=Flanagan /&gt;  Similarly, Awasthi argues that Meditation is non-specific to the research studies showing clinical efficacy in some cases, though mechanisms remain unclear.&lt;ref name="Awasthi"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Awasthi B |title = Issues and perspectives in meditation research: in search for a definition|pmid=23335908  |journal = Frontiers in Psychology
 |volume = 3 |pages = 613 |year = 2013 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00613 |pmc=3541715}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flanagan and Hanson use many of the same scientific studies to attempt to support their differing viewpoint, but both authors identify the need and importance of future studies investigating meditation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4846">'''Cathemerality''', sometimes called '''metaturnality''', is the behaviour in which an organism has sporadic and random intervals of activity during the day or night in which food is acquired, socializing with other organisms occurs, and any other activities necessary for livelihood are performed. It has been defined as follows: "The activity of an organism may be regarded as cathemeral when it is distributed approximately evenly throughout the 24 h of the daily cycle, or when significant amounts of activity, particularly feeding and/or traveling, occur within both the light and dark portions of that cycle."{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|p=477}}{{Sfn|Tattersall|1987}}

Many animals do not fit the traditional definitions of being strictly [[nocturnal animal|nocturnal]], [[diurnal animal|diurnal]], or [[crepuscular]], often by factors that include the availability of food, predation pressure, and variable ambient temperature. As a result, many species, particularly among [[primates]], may be classified as cathemeral.{{Sfn|Jacobs|2008|pp=627–628}}

Alternative patterns of cathemeral activity have been observed in specific lemurs.{{sfn|Kirk|2006|p=28}} Seasonal cathemerality  has been described for the [[mongoose lemur]] (''Eulemur mongoz'') as activity that shifts from being predominantly diurnal to being predominantly nocturnal over a yearly cycle. The [[Common brown lemur]]s (''E. fulvus fulvus'') have been observed as seasonally shifting from diurnal activity to cathemerality.{{sfn|Colquhoun|2007|pp=147-148}}

==Etymology==

In the original manuscript for his paper, "Patterns of activity in the [[Common brown lemur|mayotte lemur]], ''Lemur fulvus mayottensis''," [[Ian Tattersall]] introduced the term "cathemerality" to describe a pattern of observed activity that was neither diurnal nor nocturnal.{{Sfn|Tattersall|1979}}  Though the term "cathemeral" was proposed, "a reviewer took exception to the introduction of what he regarded as unnecessary new [[jargon]]. The result was that the term '[[diel]]' was substituted for 'cathemeral' in the published version." In 1987 Tattersall gave a formal definition of "cathemeral", turning to its [[Ancient Greek]] roots.

The word is a compound of two Greek terms: kata (κατα), meaning "through," and hemera (ήμέρα), meaning "day." Transliteration leads to  "cathemeral," meaning "through the day, with  'day'  meaning the full 24-hour day from midnight to midnight. Tattersall credits his father, Mr. Arthur Tattersall, and Dr. Robert Ireland, two classicists, for considering this lexical problem and proposing its solution.{{Sfn|Tattersall|1987}}

[[File:Chris Mason Artist.jpg|thumb|Australian artist Chris Mason. ]]
'''Chris Mason''' (born 1976) is an Australian artist. Mason resides in [[Melbourne]]. His work is held in several public collections, including those of the [[National Gallery of Australia]] and the [[State Library of Victoria]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thenorthsider.com.au/a-thousand-words-arts-project-australia/|title=A Thousand Words: Arts Project Australia|last=Harper|first=Alli|date=16 December 2015|work=Northsider|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career, themes and style ==
Both Mason's lack of formal training and autism have identified him as one of the key figures within the [[Outsider art|Outsider Art]] category in Australia.  This categorisation is confirmed by his repeated inclusion in Outsider Art exhibitions and fairs, both in Australia and in the USA. However, in recent years his work has also achieved success in more conventional art institutions and has been acquired for major collections at the [[National Gallery of Australia]] and the [[State Library of Victoria]].

Mason cites as a major influence the artist [[Ron mueck|Ron Mueck]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=So Far… Eight Artists / Eight Stories|last=Stonehouse|first=Anne|publisher=Arts Project Australia|year=2014|isbn=9780958665971|location=Melbourne, Australia|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom his work shares the [[Hyperrealism (visual arts)|Hyperrealist]] style that emerged from [[photorealism]], and whose subject matter is derived from reinterpretations of photographic imagery. His signature depictions of voluptuous women are sourced from images collected from the Internet and various publications; in his search for reference material he aims for women whose dimensions result in the figures being "almost as tall as they are wide," dimensions which he views as "perfect" and "archetypal."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In recent years Mason has developed a tendency towards smaller-scale ceramic pieces and has expressed a strong interest in pursuing taxidermy in his work, which APA Studio Manager James McDonald describes as "a logical next step."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Mason has exhibited at [[Gertrude Contemporary Art Spaces|Gertrude Contemporary]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gertrude.org.au/exhibitions/gallery-11/past-14/the-agents.phps|title=NATHAN GRAY, CHRISTINA HAYES, CHRIS MASON, CHRIS O'BRIEN: THE AGENTS|last=|first=|date=2002|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; c3 Contemporary Art Space&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.c3artspace.com.au/world-in-my-eyes/|title=World In My Eyes|last=|first=|date=2016|website=c3 Contemporary Art Spaces|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Linden New Art.

{{Christianity|state=collapsed}}
'''Church attendance''' is a central religious practice for many [[Christians]]; some [[Christian denominations]], such as the [[Catholic Church]] require church attendance on the [[Lord's Day]] (Sunday); the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] is held by the Reformed Churches and teaches [[first-day Sabbatarianism]],&lt;ref name="Wigley1980"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wigley|first=John|title=The Rise and Fall of the Victorian Sunday|year=1980|publisher=Manchester University Press|language=English|isbn=9780719007941|page=800|quote=Following the formulation of the Westminster Confession, fully fledged Sabbatarianism quickly took root too, being embodied in an Act of 1661, then spreading northwards and westwards as the Highlands were opened up after the '45, during which time the doctrine lost its original force and vigour in the Lowlands.}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus proclaiming the duty of public worship in keeping with the [[Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy|Ten Commandments]].&lt;ref name="McKim2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=McKim|first=Donald K.|title=More Presbyterian Questions, More Presbyterian Answers: Exploring Christian Faith|year=2011|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=9780664503086|page=72|quote=The Westminster Confession urges a strict observance of the Lord's Day as a day of rest and worship, away from "works, words, and thoughts" about "worldly employments and recreations." The whole time is to be devoted to "public and private exercises of [God's) worship, and in duties of necessity and mercy" (''BC'' 6.119). In the United States, many "blue laws" relating to Sunday originated from this general prescription observed by American Puritans of the Reformed tradition.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, The General Rules of the Methodist Church also requires "attending upon all the ordinances of God" including "the public worship of God".&lt;ref name="AbrahamKirby2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abraham|first1=William J.|last2=Kirby|first2=James E.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Methodist Studies|date=24 September 2009|publisher=OUP Oxford|language=English|isbn=9780191607431|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1791, the [[government of the United Kingdom]] required attendance at [[church service]]s of the [[Church of England]] (the mother Church of the [[Anglican Communion]] and a [[state Church]]) at least twice a year.&lt;ref name="Day2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Cathy|title=Wiltshire Marriage Patterns 1754-1914: Geographical Mobility, Cousin Marriage and Illegitimacy|date=26 September 2014|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|language=English|isbn=9781443867924|page=198|quote=Attendance at an Anglican church service at least twice a year was a legal requirement for all people until 1791 and some parishioners endured the minimum church attendance requirement in order to avoid a fine.}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, all major branches of [[Christianity]], however, encourage church attendance, with one Christian apostolate providing the following biblical imperatives: 
{{quote|The Bible tells us we need to attend church so we can worship God with other believers and be taught His Word for our spiritual growth ({{Bibleverse|Acts|2:42|NRSV}}; {{Bibleverse|Hebrews|10:25|NRSV}}). Church is the place where believers can love one another ({{Bibleverse|1 John|4:12|NRSV}}), encourage one another ({{Bibleverse|Hebrews|3:13|NRSV}}), "spur" one another ({{Bibleverse|Hebrews|10:24|NRSV}}), serve one another ({{Bibleverse|Galatians|5:13|NRSV}}), instruct one another ({{Bibleverse|Romans|15:14|NRSV}}), honor one another ({{Bibleverse|Romans|12:10|NRSV}}), and be kind and compassionate to one another ({{Bibleverse|Ephesians|4:32|NRSV}}).&lt;ref name="Editor2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Michael Houdmann|first=S. |title=Got Questions?: Bible Questions Answered|date=24 April 2014|language=English|isbn=9781490832739|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The [[Lutheran]] Christian theologian [[:da:Balthasar Münter|Balthasar Münter]] stated that church attendance is the "foundation for the Christian life" as "the [[Christian Bible]] and the [[sacraments]] provide the framework for the faith"; he also states that it is important for believers because it aids in the prevention of [[backsliding]], as well as offers "the [[Communion (Christian)|company of other believers]]".&lt;ref name="Roos2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roos|first=Merethe|title=Enlightened Preaching: Balthasar Münter’s Authorship 1772-1793|date=2013-03-08|publisher=[[Brill Academic Publishers]]|language=English |isbn=9789004249899|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to data from the European Social Survey in 2012 around a third of [[Christianity in Europe|European Christians]] say they attend services once a month or more.&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/international/21684679-march-christianity-future-worlds-most-popular-religion-african Christianity and church attendance]&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely about two-thirds of [[Christianity in Latin America|Latin American Christians]] and according to the [[World Values Survey]] about 90% of [[Christianity in Africa|African Christians]] (in [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]], [[Rwanda]], [[South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe]]) said they attended church regularly.&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt; The [[Gallup poll|Gallup International]], a self-reporting survey conducted via telephone, indicates that 37% of Americans report that they attend religious services weekly or near-weekly in 2013.&lt;ref name=gallup&gt;{{cite web|title=Religion: Gallup Historical Trends|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/1690/religion.aspx|website=www.gallup.com|publisher=Gallup, Inc.|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pew Research Center]] stated, however, that there is a "sharp increase in church attendance around the two most significant Christian holidays, [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/04/18/when-easter-and-christmas-near-more-americans-search-online-for-church/|title=When Easter and Christmas near, more Americans search online for "church"|last=Kuriakose|first=Noble|date=18 April 2014|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|language=English|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, on Christmas (a [[Principal Feast]] in the [[Anglican Communion]], a [[holy day of obligation]] in the [[Catholic Church]] and a [[Liturgical_calendar_(Lutheran)#Festivals|Festival]] in the [[Lutheran Church]]es), LifeWay Research found that "six out of 10 Americans typically attend church".&lt;ref name="Stetzer2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2015/december/what-is-church-attendance-like-during-christmastime-new-dat.html|title=What Is Church Attendance Like During Christmastime?

The [[Gallup poll|Gallup International]], a self-reporting survey conducted via telephone, indicates that 37% of Americans report that they attend religious services weekly or near-weekly in 2013.&lt;ref name=gallup/&gt; Self-reporting surveys conducted online indicate substantially lower weekly attendance rates,&lt;ref name=RNS&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grossman|first1=Cathy Lynn|title=Poll: Americans stretch the truth on attending church|url=http://www.religionnews.com/2014/05/17/christians-church-atheists-prri/|website=Religion News Service|publisher=Religion News LLC|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and methods of measurement that don't rely on self-reporting estimate even lower rates; for instance, a 2005 study published in the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion found that just 22% of Americans attend services weekly.&lt;ref name=Marler&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2005.00288.x |jstor=3590599 |title=How Many Americans Attend Worship Each Week?

Based on 1990-1991 data, it was estimated that the country with the highest rate of church attendance in the world was [[Nigeria]] (89%) and with the lowest - the Soviet Union (2%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/rel_ratefor.htm How many people outside of North America go regularly to religious services?]&lt;/ref&gt; Nigeria's data was notable, as Nigeria is very religiously diverse - the population is 50.1% Muslim and 48.2% Christian.

A survey commissioned by the ''Época Magazine'' in 2005 showed that 29% of [[Brazil]]ians attend church weekly, and indicated that it is lesser than in the United States but higher than in Western Europe and Japan, indeed showing that contrary to the local popular belief, Brazilians of the time could indeed be regarded as a religious people even in practice (though it is ponderable that the growth of the population declaring to be solely irreligious in nationwide censuses grew about 100% between 2000 and 2010, and 200% between 2000 and 2013, from 4% to 12%, and general secularization also grew among the portion of the population that remained religious).&lt;ref&gt;[http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Revista/Epoca/0,,EDR70422-6014,00.html Época – O brasileiro em números {{pt icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029210647/http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Revista/Epoca/0%2C%2CEDR70422-6014%2C00.html |date=2013-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2006, ''Financial Times (FT)/Harris Poll'' conducted online surveyed 12,507 adults over 16 years old in the United States (2,010 U.S. adults were surveyed) and five European countries (France, Italy, Germany, Great Britain and Spain). The survey found that only 26% of those polled attended religious services "every week or more often", 9% went "once or twice a month", 21% went "a few times a year", 3% went "once a year", 22% went "less than once a year", and 18% never attend religious services. ''Harris Interactive'' stated that the magnitude of errors cannot be estimated due to [[sampling error]]s and [[Non-response bias|non-response]] bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/NEWS/allnewsbydate.asp?NewsID=1130 |title=Religious Views and Beliefs Vary Greatly by Country, According to the Latest Financial Times/Harris Poll |publisher=Harrisinteractive.com |date=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A previous nearly identical survey by Harris in 2003 found that only 26% of those surveyed attended religious services "every week or more often", 11% went "once or twice a month" 19% went "a few times a year", 4% went "once a year", 16% went "less than once a year", and 25% never attend religious services.

Calculating the church's average weekend attendance is important since it determines the size of a given church. For example, in the U.S., an average weekend attendance of more than 2,000 people separates a [[mega church]] from a large church, and an average weekend attendance between 51 and 300 people defines the large church; while a small church is the church with an attendance lower than 50 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usachurches.org/church-sizes.htm Church Sizes]. ''USA Churches.org''. Accessed on January 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; (Alternative definitions, such as house church, simple church, intentional community, were proposed by [[the Barna Group]], an American private consulting firm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.barna.org/barna-update/congregations/45-new-statistics-on-church-attendance-and-avoidance New Statistics on Church Attendance and Avoidance]. ''Barna Group'', March 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;) A narrow definition of a regular church attendee can be viewed as a synonym for a Sunday service visitation, while a broad definition, names as a regular attendee a person who comes to church during three out of eight weekends.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Rebecca and Lindy Lowry.

===Attendance by country===
The frequency at which Christians attend church services varies greatly around the world. In some countries weekly attendance at religious services is common among Christians, while in others weekly attendance is rare. The following attendance statistics are mostly based on self-reporting surveys and may not accurately reflect real attendance figures.

A 2005 European Union survey found that religious belief increased with age and was higher among women, those who were leaning towards [[right-wing politics]], and those reflecting more upon philosophical and ethical issues.&lt;ref name="Eurostat Religion"&gt;{{cite web |title=Eurobarometer 225: Social values, Science &amp; Technology |publisher=[[Eurostat]] |year=2005 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf |accessdate=2007-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the [[Iona Institute]] documented increasing church attendance in Ireland, despite sex-abuse scandals that plagued the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name="The Iona Institute"&gt;[http://www.ionainstitute.eu/assets/files/Press_Release_by_The_Iona_Institute_2Nov2009-1.pdf ''Press Release by the Iona Institute'', 2 November 2009].&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggest{{who|date=December 2016}} the rise is due to the effects of the economic recession.

Research shows that there is a correlation between church attendance and the level of education. For instance, in a Pew Research study from 1996, approximately 34% of high school dropouts went to church on a typical Sunday, while 44% of those with a college degree or higher did.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Analysis/96KOHUT/96KOHUT_Var63_1.asp Religion and Politics Survey, 1996]. ''The Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA)''. Accessed on 19 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 48% of married individuals attended church on a typical Sunday, compared with 29% of divorced and 31% of never-married individuals. While it is likely that the well-educated and married might over-report their church attendance more often, these findings nevertheless demonstrate that they have maintained a stronger church-going identity than other Americans. A number of studies have been undertaken to examine the topic of [[religiosity and intelligence]] and religiosity and education. Studies also indicate that there is a higher rate of church attendance among married couples.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Influence of parents ===

Several research studies in the USA and Europe found that church attendance practices of parents, especially fathers, can be highly influential in forming the future church attendance practices of their children.

In [[Switzerland]], the [[Fertility and Family Survey]] was commissioned by the [[Federal Statistical Office (Switzerland)]] to enable Switzerland to take part in this international project launched by the [[UNECE Population Activities Unit]]. The survey was conducted between October 1994 and May 1995, with the results being published in 2000 by the [[Council of Europe]].  The results are representative of Switzerland's permanent resident population aged 20–49 and presented in the table below.&lt;ref name="HaugCourbage2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Werner Haug|author2=Philippe Wanner|title=The Demographic Characteristics of National Minorities in Certain European States|url=https://book.coe.int/eur/en/population-studies-series/1949-the-demographic-characteristics-of-national-minorities-in-certain-european-states-volume-2-population-studies-no-31.html|accessdate=12 November 2013|series=Population Studies No. 31|volume=Volume 2|date=January 2000|publisher=Council of Europe|location=Germany|isbn=978-92-871-4159-0|page=154|chapter=IV.

A non-practicing mother with a regular father will see a minimum of two-thirds of her children ending up at church. In contrast, a non-practicing father with a regular mother will see two-thirds of his children not attending church. If his wife is similarly irregular that figure rises to 80 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Truth About Men &amp; Church | journal = Touchstone | date = June 2003 | first = Robbie | last = Low | volume = 16 | issue = 5| id=| url = http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=16-05-024-v |publisher= The Fellowship of St. James| accessdate = 2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Egan |first=Richard |url=http://www.ad2000.com.au/church_attendance_the_family_feminism_and_the_declining_role_of_fatherhood_september_2002 |title=Church Attendance: The family, feminism and the declining role of fatherhood |journal=AD2000 |volume=15 |issue=8 |date=September 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*When both parents attend [[Sunday school]], 72% of the children attend Sunday school when grown.
*When only the father attends Sunday school, 55% of the children attend when grown.
*When only the mother attends Sunday school, 15% of the children attend when grown.
*When neither parent attends Sunday school, only 6% of the children attend when grown.

An unrelated survey in the USA also found fathers to be highly influential in church attendance. It found that if a child is the first person in a household to become a Christian, there is a 3.5% probability everyone else in the household will follow. If the mother is the first to become a Christian, there is a 17% probability everyone else in the household will follow. However, when the father is first, there is a 93% probability everyone else in the household will follow.&lt;ref name="HornerRalston1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bob Horner|author2=Ron Ralston|author3=David Sunde|title=The promise keeper at work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CglElq-WtecC|accessdate=12 November 2013|series=Promise Builders Study Series|date=December 1996|publisher=Focus on the Family Publishing|isbn=978-1-56179-451-5|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?id=15630 | title = Baptist Press: Want your church to grow?

Church attendance in advanced industrial societies is in gradual general decline with people shifting from weekly to monthly or holiday attendance. Sociologists have attributed this trend to a number of reasons, starting from a simple boredom during services and lack of motivation, to generational incompatibility of belief systems and social changes attributed to modernity.&lt;ref name="Christian Research Association"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100801010204/http://www.cra.org.au/pages/00000242.cgi Why People Don't Go to Church... ].

An article published in the ''Christianity Today Magazine'' emphasized that at least in America church attendance since the 1990s has remained stable.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter Baker. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2007/novemberweb-only/145-42.0.html Is Church Attendance Declining?], 11 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, 50% of Americans replied that God is very important in their lives, comparing with 40% of Irish, 28% of Canadians, 26% of Spaniards, 21% of Australians, and 10% of the French.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Michele.

Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The percent of Americans who regularly attend religious services has fluctuated over time, but presently is at a low point.&lt;ref name="Newport"&gt;Frank Newport, [http://www.gallup.com/poll/200186/five-key-findings-religion.aspx Five Key Findings on Religion in the US], Gallup Poll (December 23, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Gallup Poll]] surveys, the yearly aggregate of those who answer "yes" to the question "Did you, yourself, happen to attend church or synagogue in the last seven days, or not?" was 36% in 2014, 2015, and 2016.&lt;ref name="GallupPoll"&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/1690/religion.aspx Religion], Gallup Poll (last accessed May 12, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; This is a very long-running Gallup question: "In 1939, when Gallup first asked this question, 41% said 'yes.' That percentage dropped to 37% in 1940 and rose to 39% in 1950. It continued to climb, reaching as high as 49% at multiple points in the 1950s. Attendance then settled down to figures around 40% for decades, before dropping to 36%" beginning in 2014.&lt;ref name="Newport"/&gt;

The decline in church attendance is more pronounced in developed European countries, where it is suggested that the secular culture overrides interest in religion. In Poland Church attendance has declined from more than 50% in 1979 to 40% in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Praktyki niedzielne Polaków (dominicantes)|url = http://iskk.pl/kosciolnaswiecie/211-praktyki-niedzielne-polakow-dominicantes.html|website = iskk.pl|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In the early 1990s, American sociologists Kirk Hadaway, Penny Marler, and Mark Chaves found that weekly attendance at Protestant and Catholic churches in one rural county in [[Ohio]] was only about 20%, whereas self-reported church attendance was 36%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hadaway |first1=C.

Kirk }}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings point to a bigger issue as many people in the world may be over-reporting church attendance because of their self-perception and identity as churchgoing people, indicating a certain psychological aspect to the over-reporting of church attendance. Although surveys of church attendance are aimed to study religious behavior, many respondents view them as questions about their identity. This is especially true among Americans who consider themselves "regular churchgoers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/about/news_and_notes_vol4no1.html The Church Attendance Gap: A look at two older studies whose findings should be taken more seriously] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130031340/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/about/news_and_notes_vol4no1.html |date=2013-11-30 }}.

}}
The '''coelom''' is the main [[body cavity]] in most animals&lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Coelom&lt;/ref&gt; and is positioned inside the body to surround and contain the [[digestive tract]] and other organs. In developed [[animal]]s, it is lined with [[mesothelium]]. In other animals, such as [[molluscs]], it remains undifferentiated.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

== Etymology ==
The term "coelom" derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{wikt-lang|grc|κοιλία}} ({{grc-transl|κοιλία}}), meaning "cavity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/461974285 | title=Abrégé du dictionnaire grec français | last=Bailly | first=Anatole | date=1981-01-01 | publisher=Hachette | isbn=2010035283 | location=Paris | oclc=461974285}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.tabularium.be/bailly/ | title=Greek-french dictionary online | last=Bailly | first=Anatole | date= | website=www.tabularium.be | publisher= | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Coelom and Serous Membranes|volume=6|page=642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

=== Development ===

During the [[embryogenesis|development of the embryo]], coelom formation begins in the [[gastrulation]] stage. The developing digestive tube of an [[embryo]] forms as a blind pouch called the [[archenteron]].

In [[Protostomes]], the coelom forms by a process known as [[schizocoely]]. The [[archenteron]] initially forms, and the [[mesoderm]] splits into two layers: the first attaches to the body wall or [[ectoderm]], forming the [[parietal layer]] and the second surrounds the [[endoderm]] or [[alimentary canal]] forming the [[visceral layer]]. The space between the parietal layer and the visceral layer is known as the coelom or body cavity.

In [[Deuterostomes]], the coelom forms by [[enterocoely]]: [[mesoderm]] buds from the walls of the archenteron and hollows to become the coelomic cavities. Deuterostomes are therefore known as ''enterocoelomates''. Examples of deuterostome coelomates belong to three major clades: [[chordates]] ([[vertebrate]]s, [[tunicate]]s, and [[lancelet]]s), [[echinoderms]] ([[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumber]]s), and [[hemichordates]] ([[acorn worm]]s and [[graptolite]]s).

=== Origins ===
The [[evolution]]ary origin of the coelom is uncertain. The oldest known animal to have had a body cavity was the ''[[Vernanimalcula]]''. Current hypothesis include:{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}[http://faculty.college-prep.org/~bernie/sciproject/project/Kingdoms/Animal%20Kingdom%20-%205/Local%20copy/evolution.html]
* The acoelomate theory, which states that coelom evolved from an acoelomate ancestor. 
* The enterocoel theory, which states that coelom evolved from gastric pouches of [[Cnidaria|cnidarian]] ancestors. This is supported by research on [[flatworm]]s and small worms recently discovered in marine fauna ([http://www.answers.com/body%20cavity "coelom"])

== Functions ==
A coelom can absorb shock or provide a [[hydrostatic skeleton]]. It can also support an immune system in the form of [[coelomocyte]]s that may either be attached to the wall of the coelom or may float about in it freely. The coelom allows muscles to grow independently of the body wall — this feature can be seen in the digestive tract of [[tardigrade]]s (also known as ''water bears'') which is suspended within the body in the [[mesentery]] derived from a mesoderm-lined coelom.

== Coelomic fluid ==
The fluid inside the coelom is known as coelomic fluid. This is circulated by mesothelial [[cilia]] or by contraction of muscles in the body wall which are themselves of mesin{{cfn|date=June 2018}}.&lt;ref name=Ruppert&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-81-315-0104-7 |page=205 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The coelomic fluid serves several functions; it acts as a hydroskeleton, it allows free movement and growth of internal organs, it serves for transport of gases, nutrients and waste products between different parts of the body, it allows storage of sperm and eggs during maturation and it acts as a reservoir for waste.&lt;ref name=Dorit&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R.

== Classification in zoology ==
{{Further information|Body cavity}}
In the past, some zoologists grouped [[bilaterian]] animal phyla based on characteristics related to the coelom for practical purposes, knowing, and explicitly stating, that these groups were ''not'' [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] related. Animals were classified in three informal groups according to the type of body cavity they possess, in a non-taxonomic, utilitarian way, as the Acoelomata, Pseudocoelomata, and Coelomata. These groups were never intended to represent related animals, or a sequence of evolutionary traits.

However, this scheme was followed by a number of college textbooks  and some general classifications , but is now almost totally abandoned as a formal classification. Indeed, as late as 2010, one author of a [[molecular phylogeny]] study mistakenly called this classification scheme the "traditional, morphology-based phylogeny".&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, C. (2010). The “new phylogeny”. What is new about it?. ''Palaeodiversity'', 3, 149–150, [http://www.palaeodiversity.org/pdf/03Suppl/Supplement_Nielsen.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Coelomate''' animals or '''Coelomata''' (also known as eucoelomates — "true coelom") have a body cavity called a coelom with a complete lining called [[peritoneum]] derived from mesoderm (one of the three [[germ layer|primary tissue layers]]). The complete mesoderm lining allows organs to be attached to each other so that they can be suspended in a particular order while still being able to move freely within the cavity. Most bilateral animals, including all the [[vertebrate]]s, are coelomates.
* '''Pseudocoelomate''' animals have a '''pseudocoelom''' (literally “false cavity”), which is a fluid filled body cavity. Tissue derived from mesoderm partly lines the fluid filled body cavity of these animals. Thus, although organs are held in place loosely, they are not as well organized as in a coelomate. All pseudocoelomates are [[protostome]]s; however, not all protostomes are pseudocoelomates. An example of a Pseudocoelomate is the roundworm. Pseudocoelomate animals are also referred to as [[Blastocoele|Blastocoelomate]].
* '''Acoelomate''' animals, like [[flatworm]]s, have no body cavity at all. Semi-solid mesodermal tissues between the gut and body wall hold their organs in place.

=== Coelomates ===
Coeloms developed in [[triploblast]]s but were subsequently lost in several lineages. The lack of a coelom is correlated with a reduction in body size. Coelom is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to any developed digestive tract. Some organisms may not possess a coelom or may have a false coelom ([[Body cavity#Pseudocoelom|pseudocoelom]]). Animals having coeloms are called [[coelomate]]s, and those without are called [[acoelomate]]s. There are also subtypes of coelom:{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

* schizocoelom: develops from split in [[mesoderm]] found in [[annelids]], [[arthropods]] and [[molluscs]]
* haemocoelom: true coelom reduced &amp; cavity filled with blood found from [[arthropoda]] and [[mollusca]]
* enterocoelom: develops from wall of embryonic gut found from [[echinodermata]] to [[chordata]]

==== Coelomate phyla ====
According to [[Taxonomy of invertebrates (Brusca &amp; Brusca, 2003)|Brusca and Brusca]],&lt;ref name=Brusca&gt;R.C.Brusca, G.J.Brusca. ''Invertebrates.'' Sinauer Associates, Sunderland Mass 2003 (2nd ed.), p.&amp;nbsp;47, {{ISBN|0-87893-097-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the following [[bilaterian]] [[phylum|phyla]] possess a coelom:

* [[Nemertea]], traditionally viewed as acoelomates
* [[Priapulida]]&lt;!--To which [[Priapula]] redirects--&gt;
* [[Annelida]]
* [[Sipuncula]]
* [[Echiura]]
* [[Onychophora]]
* [[Tardigrada]]
* [[Arthropoda]]
* [[Mollusca]]
* [[Phoronida]]
* [[Ectoprocta]]
* [[Brachiopoda]]
* [[Echinodermata]]
* [[Chaetognatha]]
* [[Hemichordata]]
* [[Chordata]]

For others, the coelomate phyla &lt;!--pointless having two near identical lists; it's easier to list the differences)--&gt;excludes Nemertea but also comprises Entoprocta, Pentastoma, Pogonophora (i.e., from tiny [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] aquatic animals to great whales and everything in between).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.earthlife.net/inverts/coelom.html|title = Coeloms and Pseudocoeloms|work=earthlife.net|accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2015}}

=== Pseudocoelomates ===

In some [[protostome]]s, the embryonic [[blastocoele]] persists as a body cavity. These protostomes have a fluid filled main body cavity unlined or partially lined with tissue derived from mesoderm.

This fluid-filled space surrounding the internal [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s serves several functions like distribution of nutrients and removal of waste or supporting the body as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]].

A '''pseudocoelomate''' or '''blastocoelomate''' is any [[invertebrate]] [[animal]] with a three-layered body and a pseudocoel. The coelom was apparently lost or reduced as a result of [[mutation]]s in certain types of [[gene]]s that affected early development. Thus, pseudocoelomates evolved from coelomates.&lt;ref&gt;Evers, Christine A., Lisa Starr. ''Biology:Concepts and Applications.'' 6th ed. United States:Thomson, 2006. {{ISBN|0-534-46224-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Pseudocoelomate" is no longer considered a valid [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic group]], since it is not [[monophyletic]]. However, it is still used as a descriptive term.

Important characteristics:
* lack a vascular blood system
** [[diffusion]] and [[osmosis]] circulate nutrients and waste products throughout the body.
* lack a skeleton
** hydrostatic pressure gives the body a supportive framework that acts as a skeleton.
* no segmentation
* body wall
** epidermis and muscle
** often [[syncytial]]
** usually covered by a secreted cuticle
* most are microscopic
* parasites of almost every form of life (although some are free living)
* [[eutely]] in some
* loss of [[larval]] stage in some
* possibly [[pedomorphism]]

==== Pseudocoelomate phyla ====
According to Brusca and Brusca,&lt;ref name=Brusca /&gt; bilaterian pseudocoelomate phyla include:
* [[Rotifera]]
* [[Kinorhyncha]]
* [[Nematoda]]
* [[Nematomorpha]]
* [[Acanthocephala]]
* [[Loricifera]]

Some authors list the following phyla as pseudocoelomates:{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Ecdysozoans pseudocoelomates
* [[Nematoda]] (roundworms)
* [[Nematomorpha]] (nematomorphs or horsehair worms)
* [[Loricifera]]
* [[Priapulida]]
* [[Kinorhyncha]]
Lophotrochozoans pseudocoelomates
* [[Gastrotricha]]
* [[Entoprocta]]
* [[Rotifera]] (rotifers)
* [[Acanthocephala]] (spiny-headed worms)

=== Acoelomates ===
Acoelomates lack a fluid-filled body cavity between the body wall and digestive tract. This can cause some serious disadvantages. Fluid compression is negligible, while the tissue surrounding the organs of these animals will compress. Therefore, acoelomate organs are not protected from crushing forces applied to the animal’s outer surface. The coelom can be used for diffusion of gases and metabolites etc. These creatures do not have this need, as the surface area to volume ratio is large enough to allow absorption of nutrients and gas exchange by diffusion alone, due to dorso-ventral flattening.



* [[Platyhelminthes]]
* [[Gastrotricha]], traditionally viewed as blastocoelomates
* [[Entoprocta]], traditionally viewed as blastocoelomates
* [[Gnathostomulida]], traditionally viewed as blastocoelomates
* [[Cycliophora]]&lt;ref&gt;R.C.Brusca, G.J.Brusca 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;379.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to others, acoelomates include the [[cnidaria]]ns ([[jellyfish]] and allies), and the [[Ctenophora|ctenophores]] (comb jellies), [[platyhelminthes]] ([[flatworm]]s including [[tapeworm]]s, etc.), [[Nemertea]], and [[Gastrotricha]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

{{Refimprove|date=October 2014}}
'''Computational Heuristic Intelligence'''&lt;ref&gt;Newell, A. (1981) [http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA106557 THE HEURISTIC OF GEORGE POLYA AND ITS RELATION TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE] Department of Computer Science, Carnegie-Mellon University&lt;/ref&gt;(CHI) refers to specialized programming techniques in [[computational intelligence]] (also called [[artificial intelligence]], or AI). These techniques have the express goal of avoiding [[complexity]] issues, also called [[NP-hard]] problems, by using human-like techniques. They are best summarized as the use of exemplar-based methods ([[heuristics]]), rather than rule-based methods ([[algorithms]]). Hence the term is distinct from the more conventional computational ''algorithmic'' intelligence, or [[GOFAI]]. An example of a CHI technique is the [[encoding specificity principle]] of Tulving and Thompson.&lt;ref&gt;Tulving, E., &amp; Thomson, D.M. (1973).  [http://gureckislab.org/courses/fall15/lhc/readings/TulvingThompson1973.pdf Encoding specificity and retrieval processes in episodic memory]. Psychological Review, 80, 352–373,&lt;/ref&gt; In general, CHI principles are problem solving techniques used by people, rather than programmed into machines. It is by drawing attention to this key distinction that the use of this term is justified in a field already replete with confusing neologisms. Note that the legal systems of all modern human societies employ both heuristics (generalisations of cases) from individual trial records as well as legislated statutes (rules) as regulatory guides.

Another recent approach to the avoidance of complexity issues is to employ [[feedback]] control rather than [[feed forward (control)|feedforward]] modeling as a problem-solving paradigm. This approach has been called [[computational cybernetics]], because (a) the term 'computational' is associated with conventional computer programming techniques which represent a strategic, compiled, or feedforward model of the problem, and (b) the term 'cybernetic' is associated with conventional system operation techniques which represent a tactical, interpreted, or feedback model of the problem. Of course, real programs and real problems both contain both feedforward and feedback components. A real example which illustrates this point is that of human cognition, which clearly involves both perceptual ([[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]], feedback, sensor-oriented) and conceptual ([[wikt:top-down|top-down]], feedforward, motor-oriented) information flows and hierarchies.

'''Cyclonic Niño''' is a climatological phenomenon that has been observed in [[Climate model|climate models]] where [[tropical cyclone]] activity is increased. Increased tropical cyclone activity mixes ocean waters, introducing [[Cold wake|cooling in the upper layer of the ocean]] that quickly dissipates and warming in deeper layers that lasts considerably more, resulting in a net warming of the ocean. 

In climate simulations of the [[Pliocene]], this net warming is then transported by [[Ocean current|ocean currents]] and part of it ends up in the [[Eastern Pacific]], warming it relative to the [[Western Pacific Ocean|Western Pacific]] and thus creating [[El Niño]]{{efn|
Present-day [[El Niño]] is a climate phenomenon that occurs every three to seven years, during which warm water masses appear in the Eastern Pacific, suppressing [[upwelling]] there. In the [[Western Pacific Ocean|Western Pacific]] conversely precipitation and temperature both decrease.{{sfn|Watanabe|Suzuki|Minobe|Kawashima|2011|p=209}} Tropical [[Kelvin wave]]s associated with the [[Madden-Julian oscillation]] and [[Yanai wave]]s can favour the onset of El Niño events.{{sfn|Sriver|Huber|Chafik|2013|p=2}}}}-like conditions. Reconstructed temperatures in the Pliocene have shown an El Niño-like pattern of [[Ocean temperature|ocean temperatures]] that may be explained by increased tropical cyclone activity and thus increased temperatures in the Eastern Pacific. Some of the heat is transported away from the tropics and may be responsible for past episodes of warmer-than-usual climate, such as in the [[Eocene]] and [[Cretaceous]], although there is no agreement on the predominant effects of tropical cyclones on heat transport away from the tropics. There is evidence that under present-day climate when conditions are right [[Typhoon|typhoons]] might start El Niño events.

== Background ==

=== Tropical cyclones and ocean mixing ===
[[File:GulfMexTemps 2005Hurricanes.gif|thumb|Depression of [[Sea surface temperature|sea surface temperatures]] caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita]] in [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005]]]]
[[Tropical cyclone]]s are dangerous and destructive weather phenomena that are every year responsible for nearly 10,000,000,000$ damage in the United States of America alone.{{sfn|Sriver|2013|p=15173}} They also have diverse effects on the atmosphere and ocean,{{efn|
As an example, during the [[little ice age]] when tropical cyclone activity in the area was depressed, the ocean was more strongly stratified close to [[Great Bahama Bank]], probably reflecting a lowered tropical cyclone mediated mixing.{{sfn|Woodruff|Sriver|Lund|2011|p=341}}}}{{sfn|Sriver|Huber|Chafik|2013|p=1}} their winds mix the upper ocean waters{{sfn|Zhang|Zhao|Lin|Yang|2015|p=5966}} and draw up cold deep water; in addition heat is extracted from the ocean although this effect is small.{{sfn|Scoccimarro|Gualdi|Bellucci|Sanna|2011|p=4368}} The effects have usually been described as a temporary [[cold wake|cooling of the water surface]]{{sfn|Korty|Emanuel|Scott|2008|p=639}} by up to {{convert|6|C-change}}{{sfn|Manucharyan|Brierley|Fedorov|2011|p=1}} that tends to weaken the storm{{sfn|Scoccimarro|Gualdi|Bellucci|Sanna|2011|p=4368}} but is dissipated by the sea and the atmosphere in one-two months.{{sfn|Li|Sriver|2018|p=3}} This is accompanied by a much longer lasting warming of subsurface waters, although there is a certain complexity in response patterns;{{sfn|Bueti|Ginis|Rothstein|Griffies|2014|p=6978}}{{sfn|Sriver|2013|p=15173}}&lt;ref name="Zhang2018" /&gt; part{{efn|According to one study 3/4 of the warming{{sfn|Bueti|Ginis|Rothstein|Griffies|2014|p=6979}}}} of{{sfn|Manucharyan|Brierley|Fedorov|2011|p=12}} the subsurface warming tends to dissipate into the atmosphere through seasonal variations in the [[thermocline]] if it is not sufficiently deep.{{sfn|Scoccimarro|Gualdi|Bellucci|Sanna|2011|p=4369}} Moreover, other effects of tropical cyclones on the ocean such as the [[precipitation]] can alter or counteract the wind-driven effects.&lt;ref name="Wang2012" /&gt; This potentially has effects on global heat transport; the effects on global climate is modest under current climate but could be stronger in warmer climates.{{sfn|Woodruff|Sriver|Lund|2011|p=337}}

The net result of the mixing would thus be a warming of the ocean{{sfn|Korty|Emanuel|Scott|2008|p=639}} and a heat flux of between {{convert|0.26|-|0.4|PW}},{{sfn|Scoccimarro|Gualdi|Bellucci|Sanna|2011|p=4369}} as well as - for a realistic distribution of tropical cyclones - a decreased heat transport out of the tropics{{sfn|Sriver|Huber|2010|p=1}} with about 1/3 of the heat accumulating in the equatorial regions.{{efn|
The distribution of tropical cyclones implies that the transport of heat towards the poles is inhibited by the cyclone-induced mixing.{{sfn|Sriver|Goes|Mann|Keller|2010|p=2}} Tropical cyclones usually occur within the area of the subtropical [[overturning circulation]] which retains the mixed-down heat.{{sfn|Sriver|Goes|Mann|Keller|2010|p=4}} One 2015 computer simulation observed a strong heat accumulation in the tropics as a consequence.{{sfn|Zhang|Zhao|Lin|Yang|2015|p=5970}}
}}{{sfn|Manucharyan|Brierley|Fedorov|2011|p=2}} Estimates of [[ocean heat content]] through [[Satellite altimeter|satellite imaging]] support that tropical cyclone activity increases the heat content of the oceans, although there are some caveats{{sfn|Sriver|2013|p=15174}} and the effect on global heat fluxes is not particularly large under present-day tropical cyclone activity;{{sfn|Sriver|Huber|Chafik|2013|p=2}} however, according to one study the effect might be large enough to explain discrepancies between the steady state ocean mixing observed in the tropics and the amount required by [[Earth's energy budget#Earth's energy imbalance|planetary energetics]], as the former is insufficient otherwise.{{sfn|Sriver|Huber|2010|p=1}}

=== Pliocene ===
[[File:Pliocene sst anomaly.png|thumb|Sea surface temperature anomalies during the Pliocene]]
The concept has been formulated in discussions of [[Pliocene]] climates; during the Pliocene temperatures were {{convert|2|-|4|K-change}} higher than today and temperature gradients in the [[Pacific Ocean]] substantially smaller,{{sfn|Koizumi|Sakamoto|2012|p=29}}{{sfn|Fedorov|Brierley|Emanuel|2010|p=1066}} meaning that the [[Eastern Pacific]] had similar temperatures to the [[Western Pacific Ocean|Western Pacific]],&lt;ref name="ZhangPrange2012" /&gt; equivalent to strong [[El Niño]] conditions.{{sfn|Fedorov|Brierley|Emanuel|2010|p=1066}} Among the reconstructed effects are significantly moister conditions in the [[Southwestern United States]] than today.&lt;ref name="Winnick2013" /&gt; As [[greenhouse gas]] concentrations were not higher than today, other explanations have been sought for these temperature anomalies.{{sfn|Fedorov|Brierley|Emanuel|2010|p=1067}}

The existence of a permanent El Niño-like state however is not uncontested, and in some research results a more [[La Niña]]-like state of the Pacific Ocean. [[Climate model]]s, sea surface temperatures reconstructed with [[alkenone]]s{{efn|Alkenones are [[organic compound]]s that can be used to reconstruct past temperatures.&lt;ref name="Brassell1986" /&gt;}} and sometimes even reconstructions from [[foraminifera]] in the same [[drill core]] have yielded conflicting results.{{sfn|Watanabe|Suzuki|Minobe|Kawashima|2011|p=209}} [[Coral]]-based reconstructions have been used in a 2011 study to infer that the [[El Niño Southern Oscillation]] already existed during the [[Pliocene]], including discrete [[El Niño]] events.{{sfn|Watanabe|Suzuki|Minobe|Kawashima|2011|p=210}}

== Computer simulations concerning the Pliocene ==

Modelling with the CAM3 [[general circulation model]] has indicated that the number of [[tropical cyclone]]s was much larger than today and their occurrence more extensive owing to higher [[sea surface temperature]]s and a weaker atmospheric circulation (the [[Hadley cell]] and [[Walker circulation]]) which results in less [[wind shear]]. Also, tropical cyclones last longer and occur throughout the year rather than being tied to specific reasons.{{sfn|Fedorov|Brierley|Emanuel|2010|p=1067}}

This expansion of tropical cyclone activity would bring tropical cyclones within reach of zones of the ocean where [[sea current]]s below the surface transport water towards the [[Eastern Pacific]].{{sfn|Fedorov|Brierley|Emanuel|2010|p=1068}} Tropical cyclones induce mixing of the sea surface waters;{{sfn|Fedorov|Brierley|Emanuel|2010|p=1067}} with a tenfold increase in ocean mixing within two bands 8-40° north and south of the equator - especially mixing occurring in the [[Central Pacific Ocean|Central Pacific]] where tropical cyclone activity is low under present-day climate - heat would be introduced into these sea currents and eventually lead to a warming of the central and eastern [[Pacific Ocean]] similar to [[El Niño]] and a warming of the [[upwelling]] regions,{{sfn|Fedorov|Brierley|Emanuel|2010|p=1068}} with a warming of about {{convert|2|-|3|C-change}} in the zone of the East Pacific [[cold tongue]].{{sfn|Manucharyan|Brierley|Fedorov|2011|p=2}} This effect can take up to a century to set in and its strength is dependent on the exact pattern of ocean mixing. It is also subject to [[positive feedback]], as the warming of the eastern Pacific in turn increases tropical cyclone activity; eventually a climate state featuring a permanent El Niño and a weaker [[El Niño Southern Oscillation]] can arise.{{sfn|Fedorov|Brierley|Emanuel|2010|p=1069}}

During the mid-[[Piacenzian]] where [[carbon dioxide]] concentrations were close to present-day levels, Earth was about {{convert|2|-|4|C-change}} warmer than present{{sfn|Yan|Zhang|Zhang|2018|p=3}} and simulations indicate that tropical cyclones were more intense;{{sfn|Yan|Zhang|Zhang|2018|p=4}} the modelled distribution of tropical cyclones however was different from the one reconstructed for other stages of the Pliocene. Simulations using the CESM [[climate model]] conducted in 2018{{sfn|Yan|Zhang|Zhang|2018|p=5}} showed a reduced temperature gradient between the East and West Pacific and a deeper [[thermocline]] in response to [[tropical cyclone]] driven mixing and anomalous eastward sea currents in the Pacific; this is accompanied by a cooling of the areas where mixing is strongest and a warming of the Eastern Pacific.{{sfn|Yan|Zhang|Zhang|2018|pp=8-9}} There are also effects on the [[East Asian monsoon]] such as a stronger [[winter monsoon]]{{sfn|Yan|Zhang|Zhang|2018|p=12}} but in the simulations the background climate of the Piacenzian was more significant than the tropical cyclone effects.{{sfn|Yan|Zhang|Zhang|2018|p=11}} 

== Subsequent findings ==

Later researchers have suggested that the increased winds may actually strengthen the El Niño Southern Oscillation{{sfn|Watanabe|Suzuki|Minobe|Kawashima|2011|p=211}} and that [[Eocene]] and [[Pliocene]] warm climates still featured an ENSO cycle. This does not necessarily imply that there still was an east-west temperature gradient in the Pacific Ocean,&lt;ref name="IvanyBrey2011" /&gt; ]hich instead might have featured an eastward expanded Pacific [[warm pool]].{{sfn|Koizumi|Sakamoto|2012|p=29}} Temperature reconstructions based on [[coral]]s and reconstructed precipitation data from Chinese [[loess]] indicate that there was no permanent El Niño like state&lt;ref name="He2013" /&gt; Another 2013 study with a different climate model indicated that tropical cyclones in the western Pacific may actually induce cooling of eastern Pacific sea surface temperatures.&lt;ref name="ZhangPei2013" /&gt; A 2015 simulation of [[tropical cyclogenesis]] did not show increased tropical cyclone genesis in the Pliocene, although the simulation did not obtain a decreased East-West Pacific temperature gradient and it did obtain increased tropical cyclone activity in the parts of the Central Pacific most critical for the occurrence of Cyclonic Niño effects.&lt;ref name="Koh2015" /&gt; A 2018 simulation implied that adding tropical cyclone mixing induced climate phenomena to simulations of mid-[[Piacenzian]] climate can in some aspects improve and in others reduce the match between the modelled climate and the climate reconstructed from paleoclimate data.{{sfn|Yan|Zhang|Zhang|2018|p=12}}

A 2010 climate simulation indicated that increasing the average winds of tropical cyclones induced warming in the Eastern Pacific and cooling in the Western Pacific,{{sfn|Sriver|Huber|2010|p=2}} consistent with an [[El Niño]] like response; there is also strengthening of the [[Hadley cell]] of the atmospheric circulation{{sfn|Sriver|Huber|2010|p=4}} and some heat is transported out of the tropics by the western [[boundary current]]s.{{sfn|Sriver|Huber|2010|p=3}} Similar East-West temperature changes were obtained in other 2010{{sfn|Sriver|Goes|Mann|Keller|2010|p=3}} and 2011 studies;{{sfn|Manucharyan|Brierley|Fedorov|2011|p=6}} in the latter high latitude temperatures warmed by about {{convert|0.5|-|1|C-change}} and a global warming by {{convert|0.2|C-change}}{{sfn|Manucharyan|Brierley|Fedorov|2011|p=11}} and the former indicated that the heat is transported at depths of about {{convert|200|m}} towards the [[Equatorial Undercurrent]] which then brings it into the Eastern Pacific. Similar effects but of much smaller magnitude are seen in the [[North Atlantic]] and other oceans{{sfn|Sriver|Goes|Mann|Keller|2010|p=3}} and there are also changes to the [[Indonesian Throughflow]].{{sfn|Sriver|Goes|Mann|Keller|2010|p=7}} A 2013 study using tropical cyclones from the [[2003 Pacific typhoon season]] including [[Typhoon Chan-hom]] showed that the tropical cyclone winds could induce eastward moving [[equatorial wave]]s{{sfn|Sriver|Huber|Chafik|2013|p=3}} and suggested that such typhoon induced waves can start El Niño events{{sfn|Sriver|Huber|Chafik|2013|p=6}} when background conditions are favourable.{{sfn|Sriver|Huber|Chafik|2013|p=8}} A 2014 study showed a total increase in ocean heat content caused by the typhoons and hurricanes active in 2004-late 2005.{{sfn|Bueti|Ginis|Rothstein|Griffies|2014|p=6996}} Another 2018 simulation shows that warm subsurface anomalies are transported eastward into the Eastern Pacific.{{sfn|Li|Sriver|2018|p=29}}

== Concurrent effects on worldwide climate ==

Increased tropical cyclone activity during warmer climates might increase ocean heat transport, which could explain why climate records of warmer past climates often do not show much warming in the tropics compared to high latitude temperatures; the increased heat transport would remove heat more effectively from the tropics{{sfn|Koll|Abbot|2013|p=6742}} and thus keep temperatures stable even with changing rates of ocean heat transport.{{sfn|Koll|Abbot|2013|p=6746}}

Such alteration of ocean heat transport by tropical cyclones has been used to explain other past climate states where Earth was warmer than today and the temperature gradient between the poles and the tropics smaller. This was the case for example during the late [[Cretaceous]], during the [[Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum]] during which temperatures in the [[Arctic]] exceeded {{convert|20|C}} at times,{{sfn|Korty|Emanuel|Scott|2008|p=638}} during the [[Eocene]]{{sfn|Sriver|Huber|Chafik|2013|p=1}} and during the [[Pliocene]] between 3 and 5 million years ago.{{sfn|Sriver|Goes|Mann|Keller|2010|p=2}}{{sfn|Koizumi|Sakamoto|2012|p=36}}

The "Cyclonic Niño" effect could partially explain temperature distributions in the [[Pliocene]]{{sfn|Fedorov|Brierley|Emanuel|2010|p=1069}} and a flattening of the oceanic [[thermocline]] during the Pliocene.&lt;ref name="IvanyBrey2011" /&gt; The permanent [[El Niño]] conditions may have had effects similar to that of present-day [[El Niño]], although this is not undisputed.&lt;ref name="ZhangPrange2012" /&gt; A permanent El Niño would suppress [[hurricane]] activity in the [[North Atlantic]] less effectively than a present-day El Niño, owing to different thermodynamic effects of transitory warming.&lt;ref name="Korty2012" /&gt;

Stronger tropical cyclones are expected to cause more mixing of the ocean and thus a stronger effect on heat transport. [[Anthropogenic global warming]] is expected to increase the frequency of intense tropical cyclones and thus may induce a Cyclonic Niño effect.&lt;ref name="Sriver2010" /&gt; Increased [[hurricane]] activity in the [[Central Pacific Ocean|Central Pacific]] could be a consequence.&lt;ref name="Adams2011" /&gt;

[[File:Fedor Bronnikov 014.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Poetry reading by Horace, an early advocate of decorum. Painting by [[Fyodor Bronnikov]]]]
'''Decorum''' (from the [[Latin]]: "right, proper") was a principle of classical [[rhetoric]], poetry and theatrical theory that was about the fitness or otherwise of a style to a theatrical subject. The concept of decorum is also applied to [[#Social decorum|prescribed limits of appropriate social behavior]] within set situations.

==In rhetoric and poetry==
In classical rhetoric and poetic theory, decorum designates the appropriateness of style to subject. Both [[Aristotle]] (in, for example, his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'') and [[Horace]] (in his ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'') discussed the importance of appropriate style in [[Epic poetry|epic]], [[tragedy]], [[comedy]], etc. Horace says, for example: "A comic subject is not susceptible of treatment in a tragic style, and similarly the banquet of [[Thyestes]] cannot be fitly described in the strains of everyday life or in those that approach the tone of comedy. Let each of these styles be kept to the role properly allotted to it."&lt;ref&gt;Horace. ''On the Art of Poetry''. Translated by T.S. Dorsch. In: ''Aristotle/Horace/Longinus: Classical Literary Criticism''. London: Penguin Books, 1965. p. 82 (corresponding to lines 81-106 in the Latin version). {{ISBN|0-14-044155-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hellenistic and Latin [[rhetor]]s divided style into: the grand style, the middle style and the low (or plain) style; certain types of vocabulary and diction were considered appropriate for each stylistic level. A discussion of this division of styles was set out in the pseudo-[[Cicero]]nian ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]''. Modeled on [[Virgil]]'s three-part literary career (''[[Bucolics]]'', ''[[Georgics]]'', ''[[Aeneid]]''), ancient, medieval and Renaissance theorists often linked each style to a specific [[genre]]: [[Epic poetry|epic]] (high style), [[didactic]] (middle style) and [[pastoral]] (plain style). In the Middle Ages, this concept was called "Virgil's wheel". For stylistic purists, the mixing of styles within a work was considered inappropriate, and a consistent use of the high style was mandated for the epic.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony James Boyle. ''Roman Epic.'' Routledge, 1993. p.6. {{ISBN|0-415-14357-8}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=iOMyLO_Etj8C Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; However, stylistic diversity had been a hallmark of classical epic (as seen in the inclusion of comic and/or erotic scenes in the epics of Virgil or Homer).
Poetry, perhaps more than any other literary form, usually expressed words or phrases that were not current in ordinary conversation, characterized as [[poetic diction]].

With the arrival of [[Christianity]], concepts of decorum became involved with those of the [[Sacred-profane dichotomy|sacred and profane]] in a different way from in the previous classical religions. Although in the [[Middle Ages]] religious subjects were often treated with broad humour in a "low" manner, especially in [[medieval drama]], the churches policed carefully the treatment in more permanent art forms, insisting on a consistent "high style". By the Renaissance the mixture of revived [[classical mythology]] and Christian subjects was also considered to fall under the heading of decorum, as was the increasing habit of mixing religious subjects in art with lively [[genre painting]] or portraiture of the fashionable. The Catholic [[Council of Trent]] [[The Reformation and art#Council of Trent|specifically forbade]], among other things, the "indecorous" in religious art.

Concepts of decorum, increasingly sensed as inhibitive and stultifying, were aggressively attacked and [[deconstruction|deconstructed]] by writers of the [[Modernism|Modernist movement]], with the result that readers' expectations were no longer based on decorum, and in consequence the violations of decorum that underlie the wit of [[mock-heroic]], of literary [[burlesque]], and even a sense of [[bathos]], were dulled in the twentieth-century reader.

==In theatre==
In continental European debates on theatre in the Renaissance and post-Renaissance, decorum is concerned with the appropriateness of certain actions or events to the stage. In their emulation of classical models and of the theoretical works by Aristotle and Horace (including the notion of the "[[Three Unities]]"), certain subjects were deemed to be better left to narration. In Horace's ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'', the poet (in addition to speaking about appropriate vocabulary and diction, as discussed above) counseled playwrights to respect decorum by avoiding the portrayal, on stage, of scenes that would shock the audience by their cruelty or unbelievable nature: "But you will not bring on to the stage anything that ought properly to be taking place behinds the scenes, and you will keep out of sight many episodes that are to be described later by the eloquent tongue of a narrator. [[Medea]] must not butcher her children in the presence of the audience, nor the monstrous [[Atreus]] cook his dish of human flesh within public view, nor [[Procne]] be metamorphosed into a bird, nor [[Cadmus]] into a snake. I shall turn in disgust from anything of this kind that you show me. "&lt;ref&gt;Horace. ''On the Art of Poetry''. Translated by T.S. Dorsch. In: ''Aristotle/Horace/Longinus: Classical Literary Criticism''. London: Penguin Books, 1965. p. 85 (corresponding to lines 164-193 in the Latin version). {{ISBN|0-14-044155-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Renaissance Italy, important debates on decorum in theater were set off by [[Sperone Speroni]]'s play ''[[Canace (play)|Canace]]'' (portraying incest between a brother and sister) and [[Giovanni Battista Giraldi]]'s play ''[[Orbecche]]'' (involving patricide and cruel scenes of vengeance).&lt;ref&gt;See Timothy Reiss. "Renaissance theatre and the theory of tragedy." ''The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism.'' Volume III: The Renaissance. pp.229-247. {{ISBN|0-521-30008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In seventeenth-century France, the notion of decorum (''les bienséances'') was a key component of French classicism in both theater and the novel (see [[French literature of the 17th century]]), as well as the visual arts - see [[hierarchy of genres]].

==Social decorum==
''Social'' decorum sets down appropriate [[social behavior]] and propriety, and is thus linked to notions of [[etiquette]] and [[manners]].

The precepts of social decorum as we understand them, of the preservation of external decency, were consciously set by [[Philip Dormer Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]], who was looking for a translation of ''les moeurs'': "Manners are too little, morals are too much."&lt;ref&gt;Chesterfield, in the ''World'', 12 August 1756, noted by Watson 1947:197.&lt;/ref&gt; The word decorum survives in Chesterfield's severely reduced form as an element of etiquette: the prescribed limits of appropriate social behavior within a set situation. The use of this word in this sense is of the sixteenth-century,&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]]'s use of ''decorum'' in discussing virtue in ''De officiis'' does not distinguish it from ''honestum'', according to Melvin R. Watson, "Lord Chesterfield and 'Decorum'" ''Modern Language Notes'' '''62'''.3 (March 1947), pp. 197-198.&lt;/ref&gt; prescribing the boundaries established in drama and literature, used by [[Roger Ascham]], ''The Scholemaster'' (1570) and echoed in [[Malvolio]]'s tirade in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', "My masters, are you mad, or what are you? Have you no wit, manners nor honesty, but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night?...Is there no respect of persons, place nor time in you?"&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Kranidas, "Malvolio on Decorum" ''Shakespeare Quarterly'' '''15'''.4 (Autumn 1964, pp. 450-451) p 450; see also T. McAlindon, ''Shakespeare and Decorum'' (New York) 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

The place of decorum in the courtroom, of the type of argument that is within bounds, remains pertinent:&lt;ref&gt;"Decorum of Attorney in Argument: Propriety of Appeals to the Pathetic or Sentimental" ''Michigan Law Review'' '''2'''.1 (June 1903), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; the decorum of argument was a constant topic during the [[O. J. Simpson murder case|O.J. Simpson trial]].

During [[Model United Nations]] conferences the honorable chair may have to announce, "Decorum delegates!" if delegates are not adhering to parliamentary procedure dictated by the rules. This often happens if a delegate speaks out of turn or if the delegation is being disruptive.

'''Dematerialization of the art object''' is an idea in [[conceptual art]].  In "Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object" [[Lucy Lippard]] characterizes the period of 1966 to 1972 as one in which the [[art object]] was dematerialised through the new artistic practices of [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane Blocker]] ''What the Body Cost''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11127">'''Environmental health ethics''' is a field of study that combines environmental health policies and ethical consideration towards a mutually acceptable goal. Given the myriad of environmental issues facing society today a sound ethical background can be applied in an attempt to reach a compromise between conflicting interests, like [[anthropocentrism]], global stewardship, religious values, economic development, and public health. A small sample of the scientific disciplines involved in environmental health ethics include: [[ecology]], [[toxicology]], [[epidemiology]], and [[exposure biology]].

==Ethical approaches==

===[[Virtue ethics|Virtue]] theories===

===[[Christian]] ethics===

===Natural rights===

===[[Kantianism]]===

===John Stuart Mill's [[Utilitarianism]]===

===Richard Brandt's [[Richard Brandt|Utilitarianism]]===

===W. D. Ross's [[W. D. Ross|view]]===

==Environmental health topics==

Environmental health embodies a wide range of topics with which there are many ethical issues. Many of these issues can be traced back to a moral obligation towards to life forms and other units of biological organization, like ecosystems, and the nature of that obligation. Humanity's place within any given ecosystem must be weighed against the importance of regional, and global health of the environment as a whole. Human and animal rights, property use, and other freedoms can be combined with other factors like to form an ethical dilemma [[social justice]], equality, sustainability, and [[globalism]] to form ethical dilemmas. In response to difficulties with using moral theories to resolve ethical dilemmas various approaches can be used. A case-by-case approach may be too slow when considering the volume of issues at present, so an alternative may be better suited to the task. Taking into account commonly accepted moral virtues can guide conduct and address conflicts between values, rules, and obligations. Most, if not all, of these generally held principles can be found in the ethical approaches listed above, an example of which may be 'respect human rights'. This Principle-Based Method for ethical decision making can be viewed below.

# State the question or problem.
# Gather the relevant information.
# Explore different opinions.
# Apply ethical principles to the different options.
# Resolve any conflicts among ethical principles.
# Take action.&lt;ref&gt;Fox and DeMarco 2000; Beauchamp and Childress 2008; Shamoo and Resnik 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

After settling on a methodology for analyzing different ethical situations we can turn to a broad survey of some of the most relevant issues which face humanity today.

==Pest control==
[[Pesticide]]s are used throughout the world in an attempt to control, repel, or kill pest species. Though many species of insect can be commonly identified throughout the world, others may harm human health and well-being while providing a benefit to the overall environment of an area. One example of the phenomenon is a bee's ability to sting an individual who may have a serious allergic reaction, though they also play a crucial role in the pollination of an ecosystem. A further example would be various species of bat, which though they can transmit rabies, also help to control mosquito populations.
 
Perhaps the biggest event in the history of pesticide use is the widespread use of [[DDT]] to control various pests, including mosquitoes and lice. Its long-term effects had not been sufficiently documented and thus it was assumed to be of low toxicity. Over time the widespread use of DDT began to have serious environmental and human health consequences. Organisms further up the food chain showed significant amounts of DDT in their tissues and this presence had adverse health effects, for example, the weakening of predatory bird eggshells and fish kills. Adverse effects among humans included endocrine system disruption which can lead to reproductive complications.

Among the most disruptive pesticides are those dubbed [[Persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs) which do not break down easily in the environment, or if they do they become something equally harmful. Because POPs represent such a threat to organisms within an environment, especially those higher on a food chain, specific international legislation referred to as the Stockholm Convention banned several of them being used. Some of these pollutants are DDT, [[aldrin]], [[chlordane]], [[dieldrin]], [[endrin]], [[heptachlor]], [[hexachlorobenzene]], and [[toxaphene]].&lt;ref&gt;Robson et al. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

With these considerations in place it falls onto lawmakers to regulate responsible use of pesticides, and ethics can provide a starting point to consider the best option. Extensive use of pesticides would improve life in the short-term but be harmful in the long-term, and completely banning their use would likewise be detrimental to overall environmental and human health. One strategy to encourage is called Integrated Pest Management (IPM), in which pesticides are responsibly used to limit agricultural loss but also watched for growing resistance and environmental toxicity. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) have also taken measured to educate clinicians and the public about relevant issues and the best ways to manage pesticide use.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic engineering, food, and nutrition==
[[Genetic engineering]] concerns the application of scientific alteration of plant and animal DNA in order to combat pests, disease, drought, and other factors which can adversely harm the organism. Objections to [[genetically modified organism]]s (GMOs) include theological (playing God) and economic (GMOs can be costly) viewpoints. Genetic engineering of both plants and animals must pass through FDA legislation, which may include public labeling of the product or otherwise marking it as genetically modified.

Food and nutrition also fall under the category of things regulated by the FDA, however, the ethics of this regulation are not always clear. Health consequences of unsafe food, eating in overlarge quantities, are well documented yet in all societies there is no legislation against over-consumption. Ethical properties of utilitarianism and [[social justice]] conflict with humanity's freedom of choice in the determining of access to healthy, safe food.

==Pollution and waste==
Air, water, and solid waste pollution are environmental health issues which can adversely affect people, plants, and animals. From an ethical standpoint many things about pollutants can be studied, like questions of disposal, storage, recycling, and responsibility. A few examples of air pollutants include particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon oxides, [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s, and [[toxic heavy metal|heavy metals]] (e.g. [[mercury (element)|mercury]]). Perhaps the largest ethical debate concerning [[air pollution]] is how to balance economic development against the interests of the [[public health]], safety, and cleanliness. With both sides offering benefits and drawbacks it can be difficult to establish an acceptable compromise. Legislation enacted to prevent widespread use of chlorofluorocarbons, which cause significant environmental damage, can be seen as one instance of economic development taking a lower priority to public health.

Water pollution is another type of widespread contaminant which has ethical implications in mitigating the source and balancing conflicting priorities. The two types of water contaminants are anthropogenic compounds (generally referred to as pollutants, such as disinfection products, metals, municipal and agricultural waste, and petroleum and coal hydrocarbons) and natural contaminants (such as microorganisms or chemicals like arsenic and nitrogen, which are naturally present in the soil). the common misconception is that chemicals leaking into the soil will be diluted over time and rendered harmless. This theory does not take into account persistent organic pollutants, which do not break down easily, and sometimes break down into more harmful constituents. Most industrialized nations have legislation in place to protect the public from impure drinking water. The Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 established maximum levels of pollutants in public drinking water, however its power to regulate private sources of bottled water or wells is severely limited. An additional issue regarding water pollution is the relative scarcity of clean fresh water on the earth, an issue which acutely presents itself in areas prone to drought. Agriculture uses a great deal of water, so much so that shortages in drought-prone areas can significantly affect crop yield. The main ethical issues with water pollution is whether growth should be restricted in order to preserve public health. An additional issue is the regulation of private corporations, whose activities may put populations of citizens at risk for groundwater contamination.

Solid waste pollution includes pollutants like agricultural waste, construction waste, [[electronic waste]], hazardous waste, medical, and mining waste. The two prevailing strategies for solid waste management are prevention and treatment/disposal. Waste prevention is the preferable, both economically and environmentally, as it does not necessitate costly removal and storage. Many of the same ethical issues related above manifest themselves with the handling and storage of solid waste, as well as an additional social justice issue of exactly where the storage area for solid waste should be located.

==Chemical regulation==
[[Chemical regulation]], including carbon particles and nanotubes and nanotechnology, are very new technologies whose long-term effects have not been satisfactorily studied. This lack of research argues that cautionary use of these products is warranted, especially when short-term effects include harmful symptoms. In opposition to this caution is the nanotechnology industry which is growing very rapidly and may be able to alleviate many of the problems facing society today, like selective cancer treatment and the energy crisis. Perhaps the largest obstacle to testing occurs with the sheer diversity of nanoparticles, of which the only unifying factor is their minuscule size.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6377">'''Ethogenics''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|iː|θ|ə|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|ɪ|k|s}}; "the study of behavior as generated by persons who exhibit a character, an ethos",&lt;ref&gt;Wayne C. Boot (1988), ''The Vocation of a Teacher: Rhetorical Occasions, 1967-1988'', University of Chicago Press, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἦθος ''ethos'', "custom, character" and γένος ''genos'', "birth, generation") is an interdisciplinary social scientific approach that attempts to understand the systems of belief or means through which individuals attach significance to their actions and form their identities by linking these to the larger structure of rules (norms) and cultural resources in society. For [[Rom Harré]], the founder of ethogenics, it represents a radical innovation in traditional psychology, even a completely "new psychology" that should take its place.  (Harré et al., 1985: 129).

== Roots of ethogenics ==
The origins of ethogenic social science are in [[microsociology]] and [[symbolic interactionism]]: in particular, Erving Goffman's [[dramaturgy (sociology)|dramaturgical sociology]] and Harold Garfinkel's [[ethnomethodology]].&lt;ref&gt;Burkitt, Ian. (1991). ''Social Selves: Theories of the Social Formation of Personality.'' London: Sage Publications, 55-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Goffman and Garfinkel looked at the particular ways in which social actors manage authenticity and construct social order through their performances. Therefore, microsociologists working in this tradition are concerned with [[The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life|the presentation of self in everyday life]].

== Ethogenic theories ==
Ethogenicists argue that the unified self (or 'I') emerges through everyday discourse and is enabled through metaphors. Rom Harré states: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All that is personal in our mental and emotional lives is individually appropriated from the conversation going on around us and perhaps idiosyncratically transformed. The structure of our thinking and our feeling will reflect, in various ways, the form and content of that conversation. The main thesis of this work is that mind is no sort of entity, but a system of beliefs structured by a cluster of grammatical models. The science of psychology must be reformed accordingly (1983: 20).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Methodologically, ethogenics starts with the social formation as the primary human reality ''and then'' shows how the human self exists within it via personally modified 'templates.'(Harré 1983: 64-65). While Harré makes a distinction between personal and social being, he does not claim that personal being is prior to social being.

By contrast, John Shotter's approach to ethogenics analyzes social action with others (as opposed to individual rule-following and performances), which is said to give individuals 'social powers.' There is no cognitive structure of the social self-independent of social context (Shotter 1983: 33). Therefore, Shotter emphasizes the practical necessities which bring individuals together in moral configurations, which it is necessary to hermeneutically approach. Shotter believes this is a better way to understand the "accounting practices" (and resulting consciousness) of individuals than Harré's methods. 

[[Kenneth Gergen]] argues that scientific activity (theories) also plays a significant role in [[social constructionism|constructing the reality]] and values of individuals. Gergen argues that scientific theories appeal to the common sense within our everyday symbolic world. Societal power relations are affected by groups who try to impose certain frameworks for understanding selfhood, which then guide action (Gergen 1989).

== Critique of mainstream social psychology ==
Ethogenics emerged from a period of crisis in social psychology, representing a rejection of experimental methods (Ginsburg 1995). Such methods apply external "treatments" to groups of individuals rather than studying the personal "sense-making" that individuals must engage in &lt;!-- not a mistake--&gt;in order to live in society.

The '''European Master in Management''' (EMM) is a 2-year general management master program run jointly by [[École de management de Lyon|EMLYON Business School]] (France), [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwig Maximilian Universität]] (Germany) and [[Lancaster University Management School]] (UK). The purpose of the program is to allow students to study international business from a European and global perspective.

The European Master in Management is '''''a triple master's degree based in the France, Germany and the UK'''''. After completing all program requirements, '''''students are awarded three [[Master of Science|MSc]] Diplomas: one from each of the Partner Universities'''''. The EMM was the first European triple-degree program.

The objective of the EMM is to prepare students for a wide range of career possibilities all focused on global business through a combination of academic periods on different campuses, in-company internships, and a unique multicultural European experience with a great diversity in the student body. The first year is devoted to general management courses, whereas the second year is dedicated to a specialization in [[Corporate finance|Corporate Finance]], [[Marketing]], Strategy &amp; Change or [[Corporate development|Corporate Development]].

When the program was launched, in 2007, [[Aston Business School]] was the program's Partner University in the UK. After Aston Business School left the partnership, the program was run as a double degree master from EMLYON Business School and Ludwig Maximilian Universität (Germany) until Lancaster University Management School joined the partnership, bringing it back to a triple degree program.

==Program==

In the first year, students stay on the same campus ([[École de management de Lyon|EMLYON Business School]]) and are provided with a broad foundation of management knowledge. Each fundamental management course gives students a broader perspective of global business, as it is designed and taught jointly by a team of professors from [[École de management de Lyon|EMLYON]], [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|LMU]] and [[Lancaster University Management School|LUMS]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.european-master.com/Content/classes-teaching-methods&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second year, students take on an elective specialisation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.european-master.com/Content/Specialisations&lt;/ref&gt; This is an opportunity to study at a new campus, depending on the specialization chosen:
* [[Corporate Finance]] at [[École de management de Lyon|EMLYON Business School]] (at the European Campus in Lyon or at the Asian Campus in Shanghai)
* Marketing at [[École de management de Lyon|EMLYON Business School]] (at the European Campus in Lyon)
* Strategy &amp; Change at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwig Maximilian Universität]] (at the campus in Munich)
* Corporate Development at [[Lancaster University Management School]] (at the campus in Lancaster)

Students spend at least one semester in a company, on a management internship, and must write a professionally oriented Master's Dissertation. This provides the opportunity to strengthen relations with the business world.

==European Master in Management Partners Companies==

Throughout the year, students have multiple opportunities to contact with the corporate partners. Different companies are frequently represented on campus, either to give lectures and seminars or to offer internship and job opportunities directly to the students.

Some of the main partner companies are:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.european-master.com/Careers-Network/partner-companies&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Friedrich A. Kittler''' (June 12, 1943 &amp;ndash; October 18, 2011) was a literary scholar and a media theorist. His works relate to [[Mass media|media]], [[technology]], and the [[military]].

==Biography==
Friedrich Adolf Kittler was born in 1943 in [[Rochlitz]] in [[Saxony]]. His family fled with him to [[West Germany]] in 1958, where from 1958 to 1963 he went to a [[natural sciences]] and [[modern languages]] ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' in [[Lahr]] in the [[Black Forest]], and thereafter, until 1972, he studied [[German studies]], [[Romance languages|Romance]] [[philology]] and [[philosophy]] at the [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg]] in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]]. During his studies, he was especially influenced by the writings of [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Martin Heidegger]].

In 1976, Kittler received his doctorate in philosophy after a thesis on the poet [[Conrad Ferdinand Meyer]]. Between 1976 and 1986 he worked as academic assistant at the university's ''Deutsches Seminar''. In 1984, he earned his [[Habilitation]] in the field of Modern German Literary History.

He had several stints as a Visiting Assistant Professor or Visiting Professor at universities in the [[United States]], such as the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] and [[Stanford University]].

From 1986 to 1990, he headed the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|DFG's]] ''Literature and Media Analysis'' project in [[Kassel]] and in 1987 he was appointed Professor of Modern German Studies at the [[Ruhr University]]. In 1993 he was appointed to the chair for Media Aesthetics and History at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]].

In 1993, Kittler was awarded the "Siemens Media Arts Prize" (''Siemens-Medienkunstpreis'') by [[Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie|ZKM Karlsruhe]] (''Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie'', or "Centre for Art and Media Technology") for his research in the field of media theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/stories/storyReader%241107 Siemens Medienkunstpreis 1993/ Friedrich Kittle] ZKM. Museum für Neue Kunst.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was recognized in 1996 as a Distinguished Scholar at [[Yale University]] and in 1997 as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]]. Kittler was a member of the Hermann von Helmholtz Centre for Culture and the research group ''Bild Schrift Zahl'' ("Picture Writing Number") (DFG).  

Among Kittler's theses was his tendency to argue, with a mixture of polemicism, apocalypticism, erudition, and humor, that technological conditions were closely bound up with epistemology and ontology itself. This claim and his style of argumention is aptly summed up in his dictum "Nur was schaltbar ist, ist überhaupt"—a phrase that could be translated as "Only that which is switchable, exists" or more freely, "Only that which can be switched, can be." This phrase plays both on the concept that in principle any representation can be presented according to the on/off binary logic of computing. Kittler goes one step further by suggesting that, conversely, anything that can't be "switched" can't really "be," at least under current technical conditions. He invoked this doctrine on his deathbed in 2011. Dying in a hospital in Berlin and sustained only by a medical instruments, his final words were "Alle Apparate ausschalten", which translates as "switch off all apparatuses".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2011/11/09/tom-mccarthy/kittler-and-the-sirens/ London Review of Books article].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Friedrich Kittler is influential in the new approach to [[media influence|media theory]] that grew popular starting in the 1980s, [[new media]] ({{lang-de|technische Medien}}, which translates roughly to "technical media"). Kittler's central project is to "prove to the human sciences [...] their technological-media ''a priori''" ([[Hartmut Winkler]]), or in his own words: "Driving the human out of the humanities",&lt;ref&gt;This loses something in the translation, since "spirit" is "Geist" in [[German language|German]], and "[[humanities]]" is "Geisteswissenschaften", or "spiritual sciences".&lt;/ref&gt; a title that he gave a work that he published in 1980.

Kittler sees an autonomy in technology and therefore disagrees with [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s reading of the media as "extensions of man": "Media are not pseudopods for extending the human body. They follow the logic of escalation that leaves us and written history behind it. (Kittler in ''Geschichte der Kommunikationsmedien''. In: Jörg Huber, Alois Martin Müller (publishers): ''Raum und Verfahren''.)

Consequently, he sees in writing literature, in writing programmes and in burning structures into [[silicon chip]]s a complete continuum: "As we know and simply do not say, no human being writes anymore. [...] Today, human writing runs through inscriptions burnt into silicon by electronic lithography [...]. The last historic act of writing may thus have been in the late seventies when a team of Intel engineers [plotted] the hardware architecture of their first integrated microprocessor." (Kittler, ''Es gibt keine Software''. In: ders.: ''Draculas Vermächtnis. Technische Schriften''.)

{{cquote|And Kittler is a good friend of mine – I sponsored a chair at the Humboldt University for two years. He is not mainstream. Historians of music come and say, “But he did not write his thesis on [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]].” And all the professors of philosophy say, “But did he write a thesis on [[Kant]] or Heidegger?” No, Kittler is a mixture: Kittler is in between philosophy, the history of music, computer science, and media theory. That’s why he is completely outstanding. We have some fundamental heroes in Germany, really outstanding people on the level of [[Deleuze]], [[Derrida]], Lacan, [[Georges Bataille|Bataille]] … Among these are [[Bazon Brock]], Friedrich Kittler, [[Peter Sloterdijk|Sloterdijk]], [[Horst Bredekamp|Bredekamp]], or [[Hans Belting]]. These people will last longer than I will in this book. In 50 years, each of them will be known as people who had been very sensitive to changes of the media.—[[Hubert Burda]], 2011&lt;ref&gt;[[David Woodard|Woodard, D.]], "In Media Res," ''[[032c]]'', Sum 2011, [http://032c.com/2012/in-media-res/ pp. 180–189].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|180–189}}}}

'''Gender mainstreaming''' is the [[public policy]] concept of assessing the different implications for people of different genders of any planned [[policy]] action, including [[legislation]] and [[Program (management)|programmes]], in all areas and levels. Mainstreaming essentially offers a pluralistic approach that values the diversity among people of different genders.

The concept of gender mainstreaming was first proposed at the 1985 Third World Conference on Women in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]. The idea has been pushed in the [[United Nations]] development community. The idea was formally featured in 1995 at the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]], and was cited in the document that resulted from the conference, the [[Beijing Platform for Action]].

== Definition ==
Most definitions of gender mainstreaming conform to the UN [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] formally defined concept:
: Mainstreaming a gender perspective is the process of assessing the implications for women and men of any planned action, including legislation, policies or programmes, in all areas and at all levels. It is a strategy for making women's as well as men's concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, economic and societal spheres so that women and men benefit equally and inequality is not perpetuated. The ultimate goal is to achieve [[gender equality]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. "[https://www.un.org/documents/ga/docs/52/plenary/a52-3.htm Report of the Economic and Social Council for 1997]". A/52/3.18 September 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
There are different approaches to gender mainstreaming:

''Institutional perspective:''  The ways in which specific organizations adopt and implement mainstreaming policies. This will often involve an analysis of how national politics intersects with international norms and practices.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations|last=Shepard|first=Laura J.|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Discursive'' ''perspective:'' Queries the ways in which mainstreaming reproduces power relations through language and issue-framing. This approach will often involve looking at documents, resolutions and peace agreements to see how they reproduce the narratives of gender in a political context.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

These approaches are not necessarily competing, and can be seen as complimentary.

The ways in which approaches are used, however, can also reflect differing feminist theories. For example, ''liberal feminism'' is strongly invoked by mainstreaming through the binary approach of gender in strict relation to the public sphere of policymaking. ''Poststructuralist feminism'' can be seen in mainstreaming thought which seeks to displace gender difference as the sole axis of difference and to highlight the diversity of policy its ramifications.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Shafiqa Quraishi, Director of the [[Afghan National Police Gender Mainstreaming Unit]], speaks at an ANP female recruiting conference covered how to recruit and train the additional 5,000 women that [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] President [[Hamid Karzai]] has mandated be added to the police force by 2014]]

===Prioritizing gender equality===

Gender mainstreaming tries, among others, to ascertain a [[gender equality]] perspective across all [[policy]] areas.&lt;ref name="True, Jacqui 2010"&gt;True, Jacqui, Mainstreaming Gender in Global Public Policy, International Feminist Journal of Politics, 2010, 371&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jacqui True, a Professor of politics and international relations, "[e]very [[policy]] or piece of [[legislation]] should be evaluated from the perspective of whether or not it reduces or increases gender inequalities."&lt;ref name="True, Jacqui 2010"/&gt; This concept of [[gender equality]] is not limited to formal equality, it includes as well equality de facto, which is a more holistic approach to gender [[policy]] in order to tackle the interconnected causes that create an unequal relation between the sexes in all areas of life (work, politics, sexuality, culture, and violence).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Lombardo, E., (2005) "Integrating or Setting the Agenda? Gender Mainstreaming in the European Constitution-Making Process", Social Politics 12(3): 417&lt;/ref&gt;

Lombardo notes that "[t]here should be evidence that [[gender equality]] objective and policies of special concern for women (for example, [[social policy]]) have been prioritized in the organization among competing objectives (in terms of financial and human resources, type of measures adopted, voting systems used, and so forth)."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Incorporating gender into politics and decision making===

Puechguirbal takes a discursive approach to argue that in order to successfully mainstream a gendered perspective in politics, language needs to be reevaluated and used to change the parameters of how women are perceived.

Historically, documents concerning international agreements, peacekeeping arrangements and legal resolutions have perpetuated stereotypes that disempower women. This can be seen through the use of language, even as simply as in the UN Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration program's (DDR) motto: 'One man, on weapon'.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Reference of gender issues should be found in all [[policy]] areas. "There must be evidence that the [[mainstream]] political agenda has been reoriented by rethinking and rearticulating [[policy]] ends and means from a gender perspective," Lombardo says, referencing [[Rounaq Jahan]], a political scientists, feminist leader and author.&lt;ref name="Lombardo, E. 2005"&gt;Lombardo, E., (2005) "Integrating or Setting the Agenda? Gender Mainstreaming in the European Constitution-Making Process", ''Social Politics'' 12(3): 417&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Beijing Platform for Action]] states, "women's equal participation in political life plays a pivotal role in the general process of the advancement of women."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Beijing Platform for Action, G. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, according to the [[Beijing Platform for Action]] "[w]ithout the active participation of women and the incorporation of women's perspective at all levels of decision-making, the goals of equality, development and peace cannot be achieved."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Therefore, Lombardo claims that women and men should be equally represented in any decision-making institution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Charlesworth agrees and believes that every effort should be made to broaden women's participation at all levels of decision-making.&lt;ref name="Charlesworth, H 2005"&gt;Charlesworth, H., (2005) "Not waving but Drowning: Gender Mainstreaming and Human Rights in the United Nations", 18 ''Harvard Human Rights Journal'' 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Post-conflict peace-building (PCPB) ====
An area of policy and decision making that will particularly benefit from gender mainstreaming is post-conflict peace-building, also known as PCPB. Various feminist research has concluded that men and women experience violent conflict differently and moreover, the current policies surrounding PCPB are insufficient in addressing the disadvantaged position of women in male-dominated power structures that are further reinforced by peace-building efforts, both from the domestic and international communities. Gender mainstreaming in PCPB would emphasize the importance of gendered considerations of particular issues that disproportionally affect women in post-conflict settings. This would mean that policy reflected an acknowledgment of the many instances of wartime sexualized violence perpetrated on women, among other issues that (primarily) women face during conflict. A major focus of the effort towards gender mainstreaming in post-conflict peace-building policy is to lessen the international community's inclination towards building a return to 'normal' for the post-conflict region. Much of feminist research has found that returning to 'normal' is of little comfort for women, who were burdened by the patriarchal systems that were in place before conflict broke out. As Handrahan&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Handrahan|first=Lori|date=|title=Conflict, gender, ethnicity and post-conflict reconstruction|url=|journal=Security Dialogue|volume=35|pages=429–445|via=University of Victoria library database}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes, the international community involved in much of PCPB "tolerates high levels of violence against women in their own societies." Policy that prioritized gender in its applications and goals would seek to build a society where women are better off than they were before conflict broke out.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Shifts in institutional culture===

Gender mainstreaming can be seen as a process of organizational change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bibbings|first=Sharleene May|title=The politics of mainstreaming in critical perspective|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Pub.|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|isbn=9781443835121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender mainstreaming must be institutionalized through concrete steps, mechanisms, and processes in all parts of the organization.&lt;ref name="Charlesworth, H 2005"/&gt; According to Lombardo, this change involves three aspects: [[policy]] process, [[policy]] mechanisms; and [[policy]] actors. She explains as follows:

"1. A shift in [[policy]] process means that the process "is reorganized so that ordinary actors know how to incorporate a gender perspective" or that gender expertise is included "as normal requirement for [[policy]]-makers" (Council of Europe 1998, 165&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe. 1998. Gender Mainstreaming: Conceptual Framework, Methodology and Presentation of Good Practices: Final Report of Activities of the Group of Specialists on Mainstreaming. EG-S-MS. Strasbourg: Council of Europe&lt;/ref&gt;).

2. A shift in [[policy]] mechanism involves (a) the adoption of horizontal cooperation on [[gender]] issues across all [[policy]] areas, levels, and departments; and (b) the use of appropriate [[policy]] tools and techniques to integrate the gender variable in all policies and to monitor and evaluate all policies from a [[gender]] perspective.

3. The range of [[policy]] actors participating in the policy-making process is broadened to include, apart from policy-makers and civil servants, gender experts and civil society."&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo, E., (2005) "Integrating or Setting the Agenda?

{{Main|Gender budgeting}}

Gender budgeting encompasses activities and initiatives aiming at the preparation of [[budget]]s or the analysis of policies and budgets from a gender perspective. It can also be referred to as gender-sensitive budgeting or gender-responsive budgeting. Gender budgeting does not aim at creating separate budgets for women, or only increasing spending on women’s programmes. It is rather concerned with addressing budgetary [[gender inequality]] concerns, as for instance, how gender hierarchies influence budgets, and gender-based unpaid or low paid work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002316/231646e.pdf|title=A Guide for Gender Equality in Teacher Education Policy and Practices|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100069-0|location=|pages=72–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
As Jacqui True says, "[m]ainstreaming was established as a global strategy for achieving [[gender equality]], and in turn for achieving sustainable economic development in the 1995 [[Beijing Platform for Action]] ratified by all [[United Nations]] member states. It is now incumbent upon nation-states and international organizations to carry out gender mainstreaming. As such, mainstreaming has achieved widespread endorsement by individual governments, regional supra-state bodies."&lt;ref&gt;True, Jacqui, Mainstreaming Gender in Global Public Policy, International Feminist Journal of Politics, 2010, 369&lt;/ref&gt; What follows is a non-exhaustive list of examples of these endorsements.

===Nicaragua===
The election of 1990 in [[Nicaragua]] brought to office the first female [[president]] in the Americas. On April 25, 1990, [[Violeta Chamorro]] became the first and only woman to defeat a male incumbent presentment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prevost|first=G.|title='The Nicaraguan Revolution: Six Years After The Sandinista Electoral Defeat'|journal=Third World Quarterly|year=1996|volume=17|issue=2|pages=307–327|doi=10.1080/01436599650035707}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This helped to change and mobilize [[mainstream]] [[gender]] structure within [[Nicaragua]]. In 1993 the existing outdated Sandinista Women's organization, the Nicaraguan Institute for Research on Women, was revitalized and renamed by the Chamorro government as the Nicaraguan Institute for Woman (INIM). This was to encourage the involvement of Nicaraguan women in the country's economic, social, cultural, and political development and to promote a change in mainstream gender constructs.&lt;ref name="Isbester 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Isbester|first=Katherine|title=Still Fighting: The Nicaraguan Women's movement, 1977-2000,|year=2001|publisher=University of Pittsburgh press|location=Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, the INIM aims to institute in all sectors a system of gender-focus indicators and to achieve equal opportunity in all State body programming.&lt;ref name="General Assembly"&gt;{{cite web|last=General Assembly|first=United Nations|title=Nicaraguan Institute for women Instrumental in Mainstream Gender Equality Strategies, Anti-Discrimination,|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/wom1595.doc.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the INIM with 62 women's groups held discussions to mobilize their initiatives and form a bill of action. The discussions formed a plan, which defined [[patriarchy]], [[sexism]], and [[gender stereotypes]] to reduce inequality in education, employment, and violence.&lt;ref name="Isbester 2001"/&gt;

Although the Nicaraguan Institute for Women claimed to "have been instrumental in mainstreaming [[gender equality]] principles and strategies into agriculture, socio-economic development, higher education, and sexual and [[domestic violence]] prevention," the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 2007 raised several concerns, such as the backlog of important women's rights legislation in the country, the lack of studies on [[abortion]], and the available funds of the Institute.&lt;ref name="General Assembly"/&gt;

===Taiwan===
Under the influence of the UN community, the usage of the term increased in [[Taiwan]] since 2000. Local feminist organizations have different views on gender mainstreaming. Some groups considered that the Commission on Women Rights Promotion under [[Executive Yuan]] should be expanded, while other groups, including the [[National Alliance of Taiwan Women's Associations]], considered that gender mainstreaming is not promotion of women's rights but an assessment of all policies and requires a specific organization.&lt;ref&gt;Lin, Fang-Mei. "性別主流化在台灣：從國際發展到在地化實踐". ''第一屆性別研究與公共政策學術研討會'', Taipei:[[Shih Hsin University]]. April 13, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Foundation of Women's Rights Promotion and Development]] (FWRPD) has conducted research on gender mainstreaming and gender equality development, produced gender resources kits for training and education, networked women groups and entrepreneurs, participated in international exchange in [[UN]], [[APEC]] gender related meetings.&lt;ref name="website_apecwln.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apecwln.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/Taiwan%20Women's%20Organizations.pdf |title=Taiwan's Women's Organizations |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=APEC Women Leaders Network |publisher=APEC Women Leaders Network. |access-date=2015-11-15 |quote= }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vienna, Austria===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2013}}

In late 2006, the city council of [[Vienna]], capital of [[Austria]], ordered several gender mainstreaming measures for public facilities and areas. [[Pictogram]]s and information display charts will feature a male silhouette holding a baby in his arms to advise passengers on the [[Rapid transit|underground railway]] to offer seating to parents with children.&lt;ref&gt;Prabha Khosla, Vienna, Austria – A Model City for Gender Mainstreaming&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Ursula.

===UN Peacekeeping Operations===

The [[United Nations]] began acknowledging the importance of gender mainstreaming as a tool towards achieving [[gender equality]] in the mid-1990s, as outlined in the [[Beijing Platform for Action]] and the Report from the Secretary General to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=United Nations, Fourth World Conference on Women|title=Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/pdf/BDPfA%20E.pdf|accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=United Nations General Assembly |title=E/1997/66 |url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E/1997/66 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001054742/http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E%2F1997%2F66 |archivedate=2013-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2000, the [[UN Security Council]] passed Resolution 1325,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/1325(2000)|title=United Nations Official Document|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; a resolution that called for an enhanced female participation in the prevention, management and resolution of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;True, Jacqui, Mainstreaming Gender in Global Public Policy, International Feminist Journal of Politics, 2010, 373&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peacekeeping]] was an area of particular concern, and the [[Security Council]] recognized "the urgent need to mainstream a gender perspective into [[peacekeeping]] operations."&lt;ref&gt;Resolution 1325, 2&lt;/ref&gt; The Council requested "the [[Secretary-General]], where appropriate, to include in his reporting to the [[Security Council]], progress on gender mainstreaming throughout peacekeeping missions and all other aspects relating to women and girls."&lt;ref&gt;Resolution 1325, 4&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there has been an increase in female peacekeeping personnel. As of 2012, in [[peacekeeping]] operations and special political missions, 29 percent of international and 17 percent of national staff were women. If we compare these figures with the 48 percent representation of women at the [[UN Headquarters]], the participation of women in the [[United Nations Peacekeeping]] operations still faces challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=United Nations|title=Women in Peacekeeping|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/issues/women/womeninpk.shtml|accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===

The equality [[policy]] of the [[European Union]] consists of three pillars: (1) [[anti-discrimination]], (2) [[affirmative action]] policies, and (3) gender mainstreaming.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, S., 2009, Assessing Advocacy: European Transnational Women's Networks and Gender Mainstreaming, 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"&gt;{{cite thesis|author=Calvo, D.|year=2013|title=What is the problem of gender? Mainstreaming gender in migration and development policies in the European Union|location=Gothenburg|publisher=Department of Sociology and Work Science|type=Doctoral Dissertation|url=https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/31823/1/gupea_2077_31823_1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}}

In the 1990s the [[European Union]] officially put gender mainstreaming on their agenda, "fixing the principle in [[treaty]] articles, action programs and communications, and setting up institutional bodies and mechanisms to promote the incorporation of a gender perspective into policymaking."&lt;ref&gt;Lang, S., 2009, Assessing Advocacy: European Transnational Women's Networks and Gender Mainstreaming, 2&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, gender mainstreaming was introduced in 1991 in the European Community as an element of the Third Action Programme on Equal Opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, Mark A. and Hafner-Burton, Emilie. 2000. Gender Mainstreaming in the European Union, Harvard Jean Monnet Working Paper 2/000, 9&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the legal basis for gender mainstreaming in European law is Article 8 of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] (TFEU). This article states the following: "In all its activities, the Union shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality, between men and women".

What follows is a non-exhaustive overview of current gender governance initiatives in the [[European Union]] that encourages gender mainstreaming.

For instance, since 1997 gender mainstreaming has been part of the [[European Employment Strategy]], a concept launched by the [[European Council]]. The [[European Employment Strategy]] requires governments to adopt an approach that complies with the concept of gender mainstreaming, while deciding on employment policies.&lt;ref name="Rubery, Jill 2005"&gt;Rubery, Jill, 2005, Reflections on Gender Mainstreaming: An Example of Feminist Economics in Action?, Feminist Economics 11(3), November 2005, 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Alison E. 2008. Too late for gender mainstreaming? Taking stock in Brussels Journal of European Social Policy (2008) 18 (3): 4&lt;/ref&gt; Some concrete examples: new equal opportunities acts requiring mainstreaming (e.g., in France social partners are required to promote gender equality through collective bargaining); mainstreaming or [[gender]] assessment in individual ministries or areas of public services (e.g., in Finland and Sweden); and [[gender]] assessment of all new pieces of legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Rubery, Jill, 2005, Reflections on Gender Mainstreaming: An Example of Feminist Economics in Action?, Feminist Economics 11(3), November 2005, 9-10&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jill Rubery, a Professor of comparative employment system at Manchester School of Management, so far "the experience has been mixed: though the argument that increasing women's employment is critical to the achievement of Europe's aspirations for a higher employment rate has been widely accepted, there is a much weaker and more fragile commitment to improving the quality of work available to women."&lt;ref name="Rubery, Jill 2005"/&gt;

A second example is the Transnational Women's Networks.&lt;ref name="Lang, S. 2009"&gt;Lang, S., 2009, Assessing Advocacy: European Transnational Women's Networks and Gender Mainstreaming, 12&lt;/ref&gt; As such we can cite the [[European Women's Lobby]] (EWL) as an important women's organization at EU level that was created in 1990. About 2,500 [[NGOs]] of 30 European countries are part of the EWL.&lt;ref name="Lang, S. 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|51}} The [[European Women's Lobby]] encourages "coordination of women's civic groups on the EU stages."&lt;ref name="Lang, S. 2009"/&gt; The EWL lobbied for increasing the involvement of women's organizations in the process of gender governance.&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|51}} In addition the EWL has been pushing for "an EU Strategy to promote, implement and facilitate civil society and specifically women's organizations input into the European debate as an essential part of the European social model."&lt;ref&gt;European Women's Lobby. 2005a. Contribution from the European Women's Lobby to the Green Paper on an EU Approach to Managing Economic Migration, COM(2005)811 final, 6&lt;/ref&gt; Another important organization is [[Women in Development Europe]] (WIDE). This network, created in 1985, consists of NGOs, women's organizations, gender experts, and activists active in development. [[Women in Development Europe]] monitors European economic and developmental policies and practices&lt;ref name="Lang, S. 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|52}}  and is involved at many phases in policy-making activities as knowledge source.&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|52}}

Another [[gender]] governance actor is the [[European Institute for Gender Equality]] (EIGE), established in May 2007. The EIGE has as mandate to "provide expertise, improve knowledge and raise visibility of equality between men and women".&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|53}}

Obviously there are many more initiatives on EU level, to name a few: Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men,&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|57}} High Level Group on Gender Mainstreaming,&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|58}} Inter-Service Group on Gender Equality,&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt; Informal Group of Experts on Gender Equality in Development Cooperation,&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|61}} Women in Europe for our Common Future.&lt;ref name="Lang, S. 2009"/&gt;

==Criticism==

===Ineffective results===
Maria Stratigaki, Assistant Professor at the Department of Social Policy of [[Panteion University]], claims that the transformative effect of gender mainstreaming was minimal and its application has led to contradictory results. It opened important opportunities for specific policies in new [[policy]] areas, whereas in some other it diluted [[positive action]]. She also claims that, at least as of 2003, gender mainstreaming has failed to affect core [[policy]] areas or radically transform [[policy]] processes within the European Institutions.&lt;ref name="Stratigaki, M 2005"&gt;Stratigaki, M., (2005) "Gender Mainstreaming vs Positive Action. An Ongoing Conflict in EU Gender Equality Policy", ''European Journal of Women's Studies'' 12 (2): 165-186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some say that gender mainstreaming has not increased women's participation in decision making. As Charlesworth notes, "[i]n the most readily measurable area, the United Nations' employment of women in professional and managerial posts, progress has been glacial. In 2004, women held 37.4 percent of these positions. The annual growth rate toward the 50 percent target [...] is predicted to be 0.4 percent. On top of this slow growth, there is a considerable hierarchy based on sex. On June 30, 2004, women held 83.3 percent of positions at the lowest professional level, P-1, but just 16.7 percent at the highest staff level, Under-Secretary-General."&lt;ref name="Charlesworth, H 2005"/&gt; In a similar vein, concerning the [[European Union]], Lombardo reports that as of 2003 women represented only 20 percent of the representatives of the head of state or government the member states, 10 percent of the representatives of national parliaments, 31.25 percent of the representatives of the [[European Parliament]] and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo, E., (2005) "Integrating or Setting the Agenda? Gender Mainstreaming in the European Constitution-Making Process", Social Politics 12(3): 422&lt;/ref&gt;

True claims that mainstreaming gender does not end in simply increasing the number of women within a specific institution. It is about changing social consciousness, so that the effects of a policy for both women and men are truly analyzed before they are implemented. While it is necessary for [[feminists]] to engage with mainstream institutions, the ability of gender mainstreaming to deconstruct the embedded masculinization of institutions varies depending on the characteristics of the policy, the political nature of the institution, and the depth of the institution's consultation with civil society and other members of the women's rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;"True, J. (2010) "Mainstreaming Gender in International Relations". ''Gender Matters in Global Politics'' (New York: Routledge) L.J. Shepherd (Ed.) 194"&lt;/ref&gt; The danger of gender mainstreaming is that large compromises can be made for small gains and can lead to what feminist and sociology professor Carol Dines calls "trickle-down [[feminism]]"—i.e., "working to increase the ranks of women in elite jobs without a strategy for wider economic and social change represents a kind of "trickle-down [[feminism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/25/having-it-all-women-anne-marie-slaughter |title='Having it all' looks very different for women stuck in low-paid jobs &amp;#124; Gail Dines &amp;#124; Comment is free |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2014-04-23 |accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poor implementation===
Charlesworth remarks that "[a]lthough it has not been difficult to encourage the adoption of the vocabulary of mainstreaming, there is little evidence of monitoring or follow-up. A consistent problem for all the organizations that adopted gender mainstreaming is the translation of the commitment into action."&lt;ref name="Charlesworth, H 2005"/&gt; She continues: "A review of gender mainstreaming policies implemented under the [[United Nations Development Programme]], [[World Bank]], and [[ILO]] found inadequate budgeting for the gender components of projects, insufficient development of analytical skills, poor supervision of the implementation of gender components and a general lack of political commitment both within the organization and at the country level."&lt;ref name="Charlesworth, H 2005"/&gt;

===Hindering progress===
Stratigaki claims that [[positive action]] was sidelined after the launch of gender mainstreaming as a result of the specific way gender mainstreaming was used by the opponents of [[gender equality]]. According to Stratigaki, "[a]lmost all analyses of [gender mainstreaming] agree that it is a strategy which complements but does not replace previous gender specific equality policies like equal treatment legislation and positive action." However, she states too that "in a hostile gender equality policy environments (i.e. patriarchal structures of institutional organisations or the prevalence of policy objectives contrary to gender equality etc.), [gender mainstreaming] may be conceived and applied as an alternative to positive action and used to downplay the final overall objective of [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name="Stratigaki, M 2005"/&gt;

True is of the opinion that in practice, attempts to mainstream gender within international institutions have led to the marginalization and increasing invisibility of gender in each policy area. Anne-Marie Goetz, a Clinical Professor at [[NYU]], and Joanne Sandler, a consultant for gender equality and organizational development, argue that ironically, mainstreaming gender runs the risk of becoming everyone's responsibility, yet nobody's at the same time.&lt;ref name="True, J., 2010, p. 196"&gt;True, Jacqui (2010). Laura J. Shepherd, ed. ''Gender Mainstreaming in International Institutions''. New York: Routledge. p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Gender mainstreaming can allow those in power who are not genuinely interested in the women's movement to adopt the language of women's rights, a reflection of power politics that becomes more of a tool used to legitimize the actions of governments. Gender mainstreaming then becomes more about advising governments than advancing gender equality.&lt;ref name="True, J., 2010, p. 198"&gt;True, Jacqui (2010). Laura J. Shepherd, ed. ''Mainstreaming Gender in International Institutions''. New York: Routledge. p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other criticism===

As differences are silenced, the kind of [[feminism]] that is likely to be mainstreamed could be a western, white, or middle class brand of feminism. When mainstreaming decisions within international organizations are made by elites can undermine the input of local women's groups.&lt;ref name=Palmary&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Palmary, I.|author2=Nunez, L.|year=2009|title=The Orthodoxy of Gender Mainstreaming: Reflecting on Gender Mainstreaming as Strategy for Accomplishing the Millennium Development Goals|journal=Journal of Health Management|volume=11|issue=65|pages=65–78|doi=10.1177/097206340901100105}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|72}}

When gender mainstreaming policies are drafted without consulting sections of the women's movement (i.e., women's rights civil society groups), they lack ground level-expertise. [[Policy]] decisions related to gender that are made without consulting sections of the women's movement do not demonstrate a clear political willingness to addressing gender inequality. When institutions reach out to the women's rights movement, it demonstrates transparency, inclusiveness, accountability and the implementation process is more likely to be monitored with diligence.&lt;ref name="True, J., 2010, p. 199"&gt;True, Jacqui (2010). Laura J. Shepherd, ed. Mainstreaming Gender in International Institutions. New York: Routledge. p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs), as an attempt at mainstreaming gender into development, were formed with minimal consultation with women's groups. The MDGs have led to a considerable amount of theoretically discourse about the goals but less analysis about how they will be implemented.&lt;ref name=Palmary/&gt;{{rp|78}}

True highlights the tendency for gender mainstreaming to become a guise under which women are used as economic subjects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Women are framed in terms of advancing economic growth, as opposed to the inherent normative ideal for women and men to hold equal positions of power in society.

[[Image:Gene Regulatory Network 2.jpg|thumb|right|360px|Control process of a gene regulatory network]]

A '''gene''' (or '''genetic''') '''regulatory network''' ('''GRN''') is a collection of molecular regulators that interact with each other and with other substances in the cell to govern the [[gene expression]] levels of [[mRNA]] and proteins. These play a central role in [[morphogenesis]], the creation of body structures, which in turn is central to [[evolutionary developmental biology]] (evo-devo).

The regulator can be [[DNA]], [[RNA]], [[protein]] and complexes of these. The interaction can be direct or indirect (through transcribed RNA or translated protein). In general, each mRNA molecule goes on to make a specific protein (or set of proteins). In some cases this protein will be [[Protein#Structural proteins|structural]], and will accumulate at the cell membrane or within the cell to give it particular structural properties. In other cases the protein will be an [[enzyme]], i.e., a micro-machine that catalyses a certain reaction, such as the breakdown of a food source or toxin. Some proteins though serve only to activate other genes, and these are the [[transcription factors]] that are the main players in regulatory networks or cascades. By binding to the [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] region at the start of other genes they turn them on, initiating the production of another protein, and so on. Some transcription factors are inhibitory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=DH Latchman|title=Inhibitory transcription factors|journal=Biochem Cell Biol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In single-celled organisms, regulatory networks respond to the external environment, optimising the cell at a given time for survival in this environment. Thus a yeast cell, finding itself in a sugar solution, will turn on genes to make enzymes that process the sugar to alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Transcriptional Regulatory Networks in ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' |publisher=Young Lab |url= http://web.wi.mit.edu/young/regulator_network/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process, which we associate with wine-making, is how the yeast cell makes its living, gaining energy to multiply, which under normal circumstances would enhance its survival prospects.

In multicellular animals the same principle has been put in the service of gene cascades that control body-shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Davidson E, Levin M |title=Gene regulatory networks |journal=Proc.

Sometimes a 'self-sustaining feedback loop' ensures that a cell maintains its identity and passes it on. Less understood is the mechanism of [[epigenetics]] by which [[chromatin]] modification may provide cellular memory by blocking or allowing transcription. A major feature of multicellular animals is the use of [[morphogen]] gradients, which in effect provide a positioning system that tells a cell where in the body it is, and hence what sort of cell to become. A gene that is turned on in one cell may make a product that leaves the cell and [[diffusion|diffuses]] through adjacent cells, entering them and turning on genes only when it is present above a certain threshold level. These cells are thus induced into a new fate, and may even generate other [[morphogens]] that signal back to the original cell. Over longer distances morphogens may use the active process of [[signal transduction]]. Such signalling controls [[embryogenesis]], the building of a [[body plan]] from scratch through a series of sequential steps. They also control and maintain adult bodies through [[feedback]] processes, and the loss of such feedback because of a mutation can be responsible for the cell proliferation that is seen in [[cancer]]. In parallel with this process of building structure, the gene cascade turns on genes that make [[Protein#Structural proteins|structural protein]]s that give each cell the physical properties it needs.

== Overview ==

At one level, biological cells can be thought of as "partially mixed bags" of biological chemicals – in the discussion of gene regulatory networks, these chemicals are mostly the [[messenger RNA]]s (mRNAs) and [[protein]]s that arise from gene expression. These mRNA and proteins interact with each other with various degrees of specificity. Some diffuse around the cell. Others are bound to [[cell membrane]]s, interacting with molecules in the environment. Still others pass through cell membranes and mediate long range signals to other cells in a multi-cellular organism. These molecules and their interactions comprise a ''gene regulatory network''. A typical gene regulatory network looks something like this:

[[Image:DG Network in Hybrid Rice.png|thumb|right|540px|Example of a regulatory network]]

The nodes of this network can represent genes, proteins, mRNAs, protein/protein complexes or cellular processes. Nodes that are depicted as lying along vertical lines are associated with the cell/environment interfaces, while the others are free-floating and can [[diffusion|diffuse]]. Edges between nodes represent interactions between the nodes, that can correspond to individual molecular reactions between DNA, mRNA, miRNA, proteins or molecular processes through which the products of one gene affect those of another, though the lack of experimentally obtained information often implies that some reactions are not modeled at such a fine level of detail. These interactions can be inductive (usually represented by arrowheads or the + sign), with an increase in the concentration of one leading to an increase in the other, inhibitory (represented with filled circles, blunt arrows or the minus sign), with an increase in one leading to a decrease in the other, or dual, when depending of the circumstances the regulator can activate or inhibit the target node. The nodes can regulate themselves directly or indirectly, creating feedback loops, which form cyclic chains of dependencies in the topological network. The network structure is an abstraction of the system's molecular or chemical dynamics, describing the manifold ways in which one substance affects all the others to which it is connected. In practice, such GRNs are inferred from the biological literature on a given system and represent a distillation of the collective knowledge about a set of related biochemical reactions. To speed up the manual curation of GRNs, some recent efforts try to use text mining, curated databases, network inference from massive data, model checking and other information extraction technologies for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Florian Leitner, Martin Krallinger, Sushil Tripathi, Martin Kuiper, Astrid Lægreid and Alfonso Valencia, Mining cis-Regulatory Transcription Networks from Literature, Proceedings of BioLINK Special Interest Group, 5–12, ISBM/ECCB, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Genes can be viewed as nodes in the network, with input being proteins such as [[transcription factor]]s, and outputs being the level of [[gene expression]]. The value of the node depends of a function which depends in the value of its regulators in previous time steps (in the Boolean network described below these are [[Boolean functions]], typically AND, OR, and NOT). These functions have been interpreted as performing a kind of [[information processing]] within the cell, which determines cellular behavior. The basic drivers within cells are concentrations of some proteins, which determine both spatial (location within the cell or tissue) and temporal (cell cycle or developmental stage) coordinates of the cell, as a kind of "cellular memory". The gene networks are only beginning to be understood, and it is a next step for biology to attempt to deduce the functions for each gene "node", to help understand [[systems biology|the behavior of the system]] in increasing levels of complexity, from gene to signaling pathway, cell or tissue level.&lt;ref&gt;Azpeitia, E., Muñoz, S., González-Tokman, D., Martínez-Sánchez, M. E., Weinstein, N., Naldi, A., ... &amp; Mendoza, L. (2017). The combination of the functionalities of feedback circuits is determinant for the attractors’ number and size in pathway-like Boolean networks. Scientific Reports, 7, 42023.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mathematical model]]s of GRNs have been developed to capture the behavior of the system being modeled, and in some cases generate predictions corresponding with experimental observations. In some other cases, models have proven to make accurate novel predictions, which can be tested experimentally, thus suggesting new approaches to explore in an experiment that sometimes wouldn't be considered in the design of the protocol of an experimental laboratory. Modeling techniques include [[differential equation]]s (ODEs), [[Boolean network]]s, [[Petri net]]s, [[Bayesian network]]s, [[graphical Gaussian model]]s, [[Stochastic]], and [[Process calculus|Process Calculi]]. Conversely, techniques have been proposed for generating models of GRNs that best explain a set of [[time series]] observations. Recently it has been shown that ChIP-seq signal of Histone modification are more correlated with transcription factor motifs at promoters in comparison to RNA level.&lt;ref&gt;Vibhor Kumar, Masafumi Muratani, Nirmala Arul Rayan, Petra Kraus, Thomas Lufkin, Huck Hui Ng and Shyam Prabhakar, Uniform, optimal signal processing of mapped deep-sequencing data, Nature Biotechnology, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Hence it is proposed that time-series histone modification ChIP-seq could provide more reliable inference of gene-regulatory networks in comparison to methods based on expression levels.

== Structure and evolution ==

=== Global feature ===
Gene regulatory networks are generally thought to be made up of a few highly connected [[node (graph theory)|node]]s ([[network topology|hubs]]) and many poorly connected nodes nested within a hierarchical regulatory regime. Thus gene regulatory networks approximate a [[Network topology|hierarchical]] [[Scale-free network|scale free network]] topology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barabasi | first1 = A. | last2 = Oltvai | first2 = Z.

P.  |author2=J. Zhang |date=2011 |title=The pleiotropic structure of the genotype-phenotype map: the evolvability of complex organisms |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=12 |pages=204–213 |doi=10.1038/nrg2949}}&lt;/ref&gt; This structure is thought to evolve due to the [[preferential attachment]] of [[Gene duplication|duplicated genes]] to more highly connected genes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Recent work has also shown that natural selection tends to favor networks with sparse connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Robert D Leclerc |title=Survival of the sparest: robust gene networks are parsimonious |journal=Molecular Systems Biology |volume=4 |pages=213 |date= August 2008 |pmc=2538912 |doi=10.1038/msb.2008.52 |url=http://msb.embopress.org/content/4/1/213.long |pmid=18682703 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are primarily two ways that networks can evolve, both of which can occur simultaneously. The first is that network topology can be changed by the addition or subtraction of nodes (genes) or parts of the network (modules) may be expressed in different contexts. The'' [[Drosophila]]'' [[Hippo signaling pathway]] provides a good example. The Hippo signaling pathway controls both mitotic growth and post-mitotic cellular differentiation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jukam | last2 = Xie | first2 = D. B. | last3 = Rister | first3 = J. | last4 = Terrell | first4 = D. | last5 = Charlton-Perkins | first5 = M. | last6 = Pistillo | first6 = D. | last7 = Gebelein | first7 = B. | last8 = Desplan | first8 = C. | last9 = Cook | first9 = T.

This suggests that the Hippo signaling pathway operates as a conserved regulatory module that can be used for multiple functions depending on context.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus, changing network topology can allow a conserved module to serve multiple functions and alter the final output of the network. The second way networks can evolve is by changing the strength of interactions between nodes, such as how strongly a transcription factor may bind to a cis-regulatory element. Such variation in strength of network edges has been shown to underlie between species variation in vulva cell fate patterning of ''[[Caenorhabditis]]'' worms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hoyos | first1 = E. | last2 = Kim | first2 = K. | last3 = Milloz | first3 = J. | last4 = Barkoulas | first4 = M. | last5 = Penigault | first5 = J. | last6 = Munro | first6 = E. | last7 = Felix | first7 = M. | year = 2011 | title = Quantitative variation in autocrine signaling and pathway crosstalk in the Caenorhabditis vulva network | journal = Current Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 7| pages = 527–538 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.02.040| pmid = 21458263 | pmc=3084603}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Feed-forward motif.GIF|thumb|Feed-forward loop]]

Another widely cited characteristic of gene regulatory network is their abundance of certain repetitive sub-networks known as [[network motif]]s. Network motifs can be regarded as repetitive topological patterns when dividing a big network into small blocks. Previous analysis found several types of motifs that appeared more often in gene regulatory networks than in randomly generated networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Network motifs in the transcriptional regulation network of Escherichia coli |url=http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v31/n1/full/ng881.html|journal=Nature Genetics |date=2002-05-01 |issn=1061-4036 |pages=64–68|volume=31|issue=1|doi=10.1038/ng881|first=Shai S.|last=Shen-Orr|first2=Ron |last2=Milo |first3=Shmoolik |last3=Mangan |first4=Uri |last4=Alon |pmid=11967538}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Transcriptional Regulatory Networks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/298/5594/799 |journal=Science |date=2002-10-25|issn=0036-8075 |pmid=12399584|pages=799–804 |volume=298|issue=5594 |doi=10.1126/science.1075090|first=Tong Ihn |last=Lee |first2=Nicola J. |last2=Rinaldi |first3=François |last3=Robert |first4=Duncan T. |last4=Odom |first5=Ziv|last5=Bar-Joseph |first6=Georg K.|last6=Gerber|first7=Nancy M.|last7=Hannett |first8=Christopher T. |last8=Harbison |first9=Craig M.|last9=Thompson|bibcode=2002Sci...298..799L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Comparative analysis of regulatory information and circuits across distant species |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v512/n7515/full/nature13668.html |journal=Nature |date=2014-08-28 |issn=0028-0836 |pmc=4336544 |pmid=25164757 |pages=453–456 |volume=512 |issue=7515 |doi=10.1038/nature13668|first=Alan P.|last=Boyle|first2=Carlos L. |last2=Araya |first3=Cathleen |last3=Brdlik|first4=Philip |last4=Cayting |first5=Chao |last5=Cheng|first6=Yong |last6=Cheng |first7=Kathryn |last7=Gardner |first8=LaDeana W. |last8=Hillier |first9=Judith |last9=Janette|bibcode=2014Natur.512..453B }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, one such motif is called feed-forward loops, which consist three nodes. This motif is the most abundant among all possible motifs made up of three nodes, as is shown in the gene regulatory networks of fly, nematode, and human.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The enriched motifs have been proposed to follow [[convergent evolution]], suggesting they are "optimal designs" for certain regulatory purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Convergent evolution of gene circuits|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ng1181|journal=Nature Genetics|date=2003-01-01|volume=34|issue=3|doi=10.1038/ng1181|first=Gavin C|last=Conant|first2=Andreas|last2=Wagner|pmid=12819781|pages=264–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, modeling shows that feed-forward loops are able to coordinate the change in node A (in terms of concentration and activity) and the expression dynamics of node C, creating different input-output behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Structure and function of the feed-forward loop network motif|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/100/21/11980|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=2003-10-14|issn=0027-8424|pmc=218699|pmid=14530388|pages=11980–11985|volume=100|issue=21|doi=10.1073/pnas.2133841100|first=S.|last=Mangan|first2=U.|last2=Alon|bibcode=2003PNAS..10011980M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Incoherent Feedforward Loop Can Provide Fold-Change Detection in Gene Regulation |url=http://www.cell.com/article/S1097276509008594/abstract|journal=Molecular Cell|date=2009-11-12 |issn=1097-2765 |pmc=2896310 |pmid=20005851|pages=894–899|volume=36|issue=5 |doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2009.11.018 |first=Lea |last=Goentoro |first2=Oren |last2=Shoval|first3=Marc W.|last3=Kirschner |first4=Uri|last4=Alon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[galactose]] utilization system of ''[[E. coli]]'' contains a feed-forward loop which accelerates the activation of galactose utilization [[operon]] ''galETK'', potentially facilitating the metabolic transition to galactose when glucose is depleted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Incoherent Feed-forward Loop Accelerates the Response-time of the gal System of Escherichia coli |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283605015573|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |date=2006-03-10|pages=1073–1081 |volume=356|issue=5|doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2005.12.003 |first=S.|last=Mangan |first2=S. |last2=Itzkovitz |first3=A. |last3=Zaslaver|first4=U.|last4=Alon |pmid=16406067}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feed-forward loop in the [[arabinose]] utilization systems of ''E.coli'' delays the activation of arabinose catabolism operon and transporters, potentially avoiding unnecessary metabolic transition due to temporary fluctuations in upstream signaling pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Coherent Feedforward Loop Serves as a Sign-sensitive Delay Element in Transcription Networks|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283603012038|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|date=2003-11-21 |pages=197–204|volume=334 |issue=2|doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2003.09.049 |first=S |last=Mangan |first2=A |last2=Zaslaver |first3=U|last3=Alon|pmid=14607112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly in the Wnt signaling pathway of ''[[Xenopus]]'', the feed-forward loop acts as a fold-change detector that responses to the fold change, rather than the absolute change, in the level of β-catenin, potentially increasing the resistance to fluctuations in β-catenin levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Evidence that Fold-Change, and Not Absolute Level, of β-Catenin Dictates Wnt Signaling |url=http://www.cell.com/article/S1097276509008582/abstract|journal=Molecular Cell |date=2009-11-12 |issn=1097-2765 |pmc=2921914 |pmid=20005849 |pages=872–884|volume=36|issue=5 |doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2009.11.017 |first=Lea |last=Goentoro |first2=Marc W. |last2=Kirschner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the convergent evolution hypothesis, the enrichment of feed-forward loops would be an [[adaptation]] for fast response and noise resistance.

Support for this hypothesis often comes from computational simulations. For example, fluctuations in the abundance of feed-forward loops in a model that simulates the evolution of gene regulatory networks by randomly rewiring nodes may suggest that the enrichment of feed-forward loops is a side-effect of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Feed-Forward Loop Circuits as a Side Effect of Genome Evolution|url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/10/1931|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |date=2006-10-01|issn=0737-4038 |pmid=16840361|pages=1931–1936 |volume=23|issue=10|doi=10.1093/molbev/msl060|first=Otto X.|last=Cordero|first2=Paulien|last2=Hogeweg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another model of gene regulator networks evolution, the ratio of the frequencies of gene duplication and gene deletion show great influence on network topology: certain ratios lead to the enrichment of feed-forward loops and create networks that show features of hierarchical scale free networks.

Regulatory networks allow [[bacteria]] to adapt to almost every environmental niche on earth.&lt;ref name= FillouxAAM&gt;{{cite book | author= Filloux, AAM (editor) | year=2012 | title=Bacterial Regulatory Networks | publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] | isbn= 978-1-908230-03-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= GrossRBeierD&gt;{{cite book | author= Gross, R; Beier, D (editor) | year=2012 | title=Two-Component Systems in Bacteria | publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] | isbn= 978-1-908230-08-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A network of interactions among diverse types of molecules including DNA, RNA, proteins and metabolites, is utilised by the bacteria to achieve regulation of gene expression.

== Modelling ==

=== Coupled ordinary differential equations ===
{{for|an example of modelling of the cell cycle with ODEs|cellular model}}

It is common to model such a network with a set of coupled [[ordinary differential equation]]s (ODEs) or [[Stochastic differential equation|SDE]]s, describing the reaction kinetics of the constituent parts. Suppose that our regulatory network has &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; nodes, and let &lt;math&gt;S_1(t),S_2(t), \ldots, S_N(t)&lt;/math&gt; represent the concentrations of the &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; corresponding substances at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Then the temporal evolution of the system can be described approximately by

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{dS_j}{dt} = f_j \left (S_1,S_2, \ldots, S_N \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where the functions &lt;math&gt; f_j &lt;/math&gt; express the dependence of &lt;math&gt;S_j&lt;/math&gt; on the concentrations of other substances present in the cell. The functions &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; are ultimately derived from basic [[rate equation|principles of chemical kinetics]] or simple expressions derived from these e.g. [[Michaelis-Menten]] enzymatic kinetics. Hence, the functional forms of the &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; are usually chosen as low-order [[polynomials]] or [[Hill equation (biochemistry)|Hill function]]s that serve as an [[ansatz]] for the real molecular dynamics. Such models are then studied using the mathematics of [[dynamical system|nonlinear dynamics]]. System-specific information, like [[reaction rate]] constants and sensitivities, are encoded as constant parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chu D, Zabet NR, Mitavskiy B |title=Models of transcription factor binding: sensitivity of activation functions to model assumptions |journal=J. Theor. Biol. |volume=257 |issue=3 |pages=419–29 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19121637 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.11.026 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022-5193(08)00631-0|last2=Zabet |last3=Mitavskiy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By solving for the [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of the system:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{dS_j}{dt} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, one obtains (possibly several) concentration profiles of proteins and mRNAs that are theoretically sustainable (though not necessarily [[stability (mathematics)|stable]]). [[Steady state]]s of kinetic equations thus correspond to potential cell types, and [[Oscillation|oscillatory]] solutions to the above equation to naturally cyclic cell types. Mathematical stability of these [[attractor]]s can usually be characterized by the sign of higher derivatives at critical points, and then correspond to [[Steady state (biochemistry)|biochemical stability]] of the concentration profile. [[Critical point (mathematics)|Critical point]]s and [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]]s in the equations correspond to critical cell states in which small state or parameter perturbations could switch the system between one of several stable differentiation fates. Trajectories correspond to the unfolding of biological pathways and transients of the equations to short-term biological events. For a more mathematical discussion, see the articles on [[nonlinearity]], [[dynamical systems]], [[bifurcation theory]], and [[chaos theory]].

=== Boolean network ===
{{Main|Boolean network}}
The following example illustrates how a [[Boolean network]] can model a GRN together with its gene products (the outputs) and the substances from the environment that affect it (the inputs). [[Stuart Kauffman]] was amongst the first biologists to use the metaphor of Boolean networks to model genetic regulatory networks.&lt;ref name="kauffmanRBN"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Origins of Order| last=Kauffman| first=Stuart | year=1993 | isbn=0-19-505811-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kauffman SA |title=Metabolic stability and epigenesis in randomly constructed genetic nets |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |issue=3 |pages=437–467 |year=1969 |url=http://lis.epfl.ch/~markus/References/Kauffman69.pdf |pmid=5803332 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(69)90015-0 |volume=22 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Each gene, each input, and each output is represented by a node in a [[directed graph]] in which there is an arrow from one node to another if and only if there is a causal link between the two nodes.
# Each node in the graph can be in one of two states: on or off.
# For a gene, "on" corresponds to the gene being expressed; for inputs and outputs, "off" corresponds to the substance being present.
# Time is viewed as proceeding in discrete steps. At each step, the new state of a node is a [[Boolean function]] of the prior states of the nodes with arrows pointing towards it.

The validity of the model can be tested by comparing simulation results with time series observations. A partial validation of a Boolean network model can also come from testing the predicted existence of a yet unknown regulatory connection between two particular transcription factors that each are nodes of the model.&lt;ref name="pmid25398016"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lovrics A, Gao Y, Juhász B, Bock I, Byrne HM, Dinnyés A, Kovács KA |title=Boolean modelling reveals new regulatory connections between transcription factors orchestrating the development of the ventral spinal cord |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=9 |issue=11 |pages=11430|date=November 2014 |pmid=25398016 |url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111430 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0111430 |pmc=4232242|bibcode=2014PLoSO...9k1430L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continuous networks ===

Continuous network models of GRNs are an extension of the boolean networks described above. Nodes still represent genes and connections between them regulatory influences on gene expression. Genes in biological systems display a continuous range of activity levels and it has been argued that using a continuous representation captures several properties of gene regulatory networks not present in the Boolean model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vohradsky J |title=Neural model of the genetic network |journal=J.

&lt;/ref&gt; Formally most of these approaches are similar to an [[artificial neural network]], as inputs to a node are summed up and the result serves as input to a sigmoid function, e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Geard N, Wiles J |title=A gene network model for developing cell lineages |journal=Artif. Life |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=249–67 |year=2005 |pmid=16053570 |doi=10.1162/1064546054407202 |last2=Wiles }}&lt;/ref&gt; but proteins do often control gene expression in a synergistic, i.e. non-linear, way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Schilstra MJ, Bolouri H |title=Modelling the Regulation of Gene Expression in Genetic Regulatory Networks |date=2 January 2002 |work= |publisher=Biocomputation group, University of Hertfordshire |url=http://strc.herts.ac.uk/bio/maria/NetBuilder/Theory/NetBuilderModelling.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013022705/http://strc.herts.ac.uk/bio/maria/NetBuilder/Theory/NetBuilderModelling.htm |archivedate=13 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is now a continuous network model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |vauthors=Knabe JF, Nehaniv CL, Schilstra MJ, Quick T |title=Evolving Biological Clocks using Genetic Regulatory Networks |booktitle=Proceedings of the Artificial Life X Conference (Alife 10) |pages=15–21 |publisher=MIT Press |year=2006 |location= |citeseerx = 10.1.1.72.5016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that allows grouping of inputs to a node thus realizing another level of regulation. This model is formally closer to a higher order [[recurrent neural network]].

Recent (as of 2007) experimental results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elowitz MB, Levine AJ, Siggia ED, Swain PS |title=Stochastic gene expression in a single cell |journal=Science |volume=297 |issue=5584 |pages=1183–6 |date=August 2002 |pmid=12183631 |doi=10.1126/science.1070919 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12183631|last2=Levine |last3=Siggia |last4=Swain |bibcode=2002Sci...297.1183E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, many authors are now using the stochastic formalism, after the work by Arkin et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arkin A, Ross J, McAdams HH |title=Stochastic kinetic analysis of developmental pathway bifurcation in phage lambda-infected Escherichia coli cells |journal=Genetics |volume=149 |issue=4 |pages=1633–48 |date=August 1998 |pmid=9691025 |pmc=1460268 |last2=Ross |last3=McAdams }}&lt;/ref&gt; Works on single gene expression&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Raser JM, O'Shea EK |title=Noise in Gene Expression: Origins, Consequences, and Control |journal=Science |volume=309 |issue=5743 |pages=2010–3 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16179466 |pmc=1360161 |doi=10.1126/science.1105891 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16179466|last2=O'Shea |bibcode=2005Sci...309.2010R }}&lt;/ref&gt; and small synthetic genetic networks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elowitz MB, Leibler S |title=A synthetic oscillatory network of transcriptional regulators |journal=Nature |volume=403 |issue=6767 |pages=335–8 |date=January 2000 |pmid=10659856 |doi=10.1038/35002125|last2=Leibler }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gardner TS, Cantor CR, Collins JJ |title=Construction of a genetic toggle switch in Escherichia coli |journal=Nature |volume=403 |issue=6767 |pages=339–42 |date=January 2000 |pmid=10659857 |doi=10.1038/35002131|last2=Cantor |last3=Collins }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the genetic toggle switch of Tim Gardner and [[James Collins (bioengineer)|Jim Collins]], provided additional experimental data on the phenotypic variability and the stochastic nature of gene expression. The first versions of stochastic models of gene expression involved only instantaneous reactions and were driven by the [[Gillespie algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gillespie DT |title=A general method for numerically simulating the stochastic time evolution of coupled chemical reactions |journal=J. Comput. Phys. |volume=22 |pages=403–34 |year=1976 |doi=10.1016/0021-9991(76)90041-3 |issue=4|bibcode=1976JCoPh..22..403G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since some processes, such as gene transcription, involve many reactions and could not be correctly modeled as an instantaneous reaction in a single step, it was proposed to model these reactions as single step multiple delayed reactions in order to account for the time it takes for the entire process to be complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roussel MR, Zhu R |title=Validation of an algorithm for delay stochastic simulation of transcription and translation in prokaryotic gene expression |journal=Phys Biol |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=274–84 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17200603 |doi=10.1088/1478-3975/3/4/005 |url=http://stacks.iop.org/1478-3967/3/274|last2=Zhu |bibcode=2006PhBio...3..274R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From here, a set of reactions were proposed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ribeiro A, Zhu R, Kauffman SA |title=A general modeling strategy for gene regulatory networks with stochastic dynamics |journal=J. Comput. Biol. |volume=13 |issue=9 |pages=1630–9 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17147485 |doi=10.1089/cmb.2006.13.1630|last2=Zhu |last3=Kauffman }}&lt;/ref&gt; that allow generating GRNs. These are then simulated using a modified version of the Gillespie algorithm, that can simulate multiple time delayed reactions (chemical reactions where each of the products is provided a time delay that determines when will it be released in the system as a "finished product").

For example, basic transcription of a gene can be represented by the following single-step reaction (RNAP is the RNA polymerase, RBS is the RNA ribosome binding site, and Pro&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the promoter region of gene ''i''):

: &lt;math&gt; \text{RNAP} + \text{Pro}_i \overset{k_{i,bas}}

\longrightarrow \text{Pro}_i(\tau _i^1 ) + \text{RBS}_i(\tau_i^1)+ \text{RNAP}(\tau _i^2) &lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, there seems to be a trade-off between the noise in gene expression, the speed with which genes can switch, and the metabolic cost associated their functioning. More specifically, for any given level of metabolic cost, there is an optimal trade-off between noise and processing speed and increasing the metabolic cost leads to better speed-noise trade-offs.&lt;ref name="a30"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rsif.2009.0474 |author=Zabet NR, Chu DF |title=Computational limits to binary genes |journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface |volume=7 |issue=47 |pages=945–954 |date=June 2010 |pmid= 20007173 |url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/7/47/945.full |pmc=2871807|last2=Chu }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="a31"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biosystems.2011.01.006 |author=Chu DF, Zabet NR, Hone ANW |title=Optimal Parameter Settings for Information Processing in Gene Regulatory Networks |journal=BioSystems |volume=104 |issue=2–3 |pages=99–108 |date=May–Jun 2011 |pmid=21256918 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030326471100027X|last2=Zabet |last3=Hone }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="a32"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.06.021 |author=Zabet NR |title=Negative feedback and physical limits of genes |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume= 284|issue=1 |pages=82–91 |date=September 2011 |pmid=21723295 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519311003201|arxiv=1408.1869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent work proposed a simulator (SGNSim, ''Stochastic Gene Networks Simulator''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ribeiro AS, Lloyd-Price J |title=SGN Sim, a stochastic genetic networks simulator |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=777–9 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17267430 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btm004 |url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17267430|last2=Lloyd-Price }}

&lt;/ref&gt; that can model GRNs where transcription and translation are modeled as multiple time delayed events and its dynamics is driven by a stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) able to deal with multiple time delayed events.
The time delays can be drawn from several distributions and the reaction rates from complex
functions or from physical parameters. SGNSim can generate ensembles of GRNs within a set of user-defined parameters, such as topology. It can also be used to model specific GRNs and systems of chemical reactions. Genetic perturbations such as gene deletions, gene over-expression, insertions, frame shift mutations can also be modeled as well.

The GRN is created from a graph with the desired topology, imposing in-degree and out-degree distributions. Gene promoter activities are affected by other genes expression products that act as inputs, in the form of monomers or combined into multimers and set as direct or indirect. Next, each direct input is assigned to an operator site and different transcription factors can be allowed, or not, to compete for the same operator site, while indirect inputs are given a target. Finally, a function is assigned to each gene, defining the gene's response to a combination of transcription factors (promoter state). The transfer functions (that is, how genes respond to a combination of inputs) can be assigned to each combination of promoter states as desired.

In other recent work, multiscale models of gene regulatory networks have been developed that focus on synthetic biology applications. Simulations have been used that model all biomolecular interactions in transcription, translation, regulation, and induction of gene regulatory networks, guiding the design of synthetic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kaznessis YN |title=Models for synthetic biology |journal=BMC Syst Biol |volume=1|pages=47 |year=2007 |pmid=17986347 |pmc=2194732 |doi=10.1186/1752-0509-1-47 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/1/47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prediction ==

Other work has focused on predicting the gene expression levels in a gene regulatory network. The approaches used to model gene regulatory networks have been constrained to be interpretable and, as a result, are generally simplified versions of the network. For example, Boolean networks have been used due to their simplicity and ability to handle noisy data but lose data information by having a binary representation of the genes. Also, artificial neural networks omit using a hidden layer so that they can be interpreted, losing the ability to model higher order correlations in the data. Using a model that is not constrained to be interpretable, a more accurate model can be produced. Being able to predict gene expressions more accurately provides a way to explore how drugs affect a system of genes as well as for finding which genes are interrelated in a process. This has been encouraged by the DREAM competition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The DREAM Project |publisher=Columbia University Center for Multiscale Analysis Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet)  |url= http://wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/dream/index.php/The_DREAM_Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; which promotes a competition for the best prediction algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gustafsson M, Hörnquist M |title=Gene Expression Prediction by Soft Integration and the Elastic Net—Best Performance of the DREAM3 Gene Expression Challenge |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages= e9134|year=2010 |pmid= 20169069|pmc= 2821917|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0009134 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009134|last2=Hörnquist |bibcode=2010PLoSO...5.9134G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other recent work has used artificial neural networks with a hidden layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |vauthors=Smith MR, Clement M, Martinez T, Snell Q |title=Time Series Gene Expression Prediction using Neural Networks with Hidden Layers |booktitle=Proceedings of the 7th Biotechnology and Bioinformatics Symposium (BIOT 2010) |pages=67–69 |year=2010 |location= |url=http://axon.cs.byu.edu/papers/smith_2010biot.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google was founded in 1998 by [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]] while they were Ph.D. students at [[Stanford University]] in [[California]]. Together they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through [[Preferred stock|supervoting]] stock. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the [[Googleplex]]. In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate called [[Alphabet Inc.]] Google is Alphabet's leading subsidiary and will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests. [[Sundar Pichai]] was appointed CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page who became the CEO of Alphabet.

The company's rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond Google's core search engine ([[Google Search]]). It offers services designed for work and productivity ([[Google Docs]], [[Google Sheets]], and [[Google Slides]]), email ([[Gmail]]/[[Inbox by Gmail|Inbox]]), scheduling and time management ([[Google Calendar]]), cloud storage ([[Google Drive]]), social networking ([[Google+]]), instant messaging and video chat ([[Google Allo]], [[Google Duo|Duo]], [[Hangouts]]), language translation ([[Google Translate]]), mapping and navigation ([[Google Maps]], [[Waze]], [[Google Earth]], [[Street View]]), video sharing ([[YouTube]]), note-taking ([[Google Keep]]), and photo organizing and editing ([[Google Photos]]). The company leads the development of the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile operating system, the [[Google Chrome]] web browser, and [[Chrome OS]], a lightweight operating system based on the Chrome browser. Google has moved increasingly into hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it partnered with major electronics manufacturers in the production of its [[Google Nexus|Nexus]] devices, and it released multiple hardware products in October 2016, including the [[Pixel (smartphone)|Google Pixel]] smartphone, [[Google Home]] smart speaker, [[Google Wifi]] mesh wireless router, and [[Google Daydream]] virtual reality headset. Google has also experimented with becoming an Internet carrier. In February 2010, it announced [[Google Fiber]], a fiber-optic infrastructure that was installed in Kansas City; in April 2015, it launched [[Project Fi]] in the United States, combining Wi-Fi and cellular networks from different providers; and in 2016, it announced the Google Station initiative to make public Wi-Fi available around the world, with initial deployment in India.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Byford, The Verge.

[[Alexa Internet]] monitors commercial web traffic and lists Google.com as the most visited website in the world.

Google's [[mission statement]] is "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful", and its unofficial slogan was "Don't be evil". In October 2015, the motto was replaced in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase ''"Do the right thing"'', while the original one was retained in the code of conduct of Google.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Around May 2018, the slogan was silently removed from the code's clauses, leaving only one generic reference in its last paragraph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393|title=Google Removes 'Don't Be Evil' Clause From Its Code of Conduct|first=Kate|last=Conger|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google was initially funded by an August 1998 contribution of $100,000 from [[Andy Bechtolsheim]], co-founder of [[Sun Microsystems]]; the money was given before Google was incorporated.&lt;ref name="Bechtolsheim"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/04/29/MNGLD6CFND34.DTL |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919030812/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F2004%2F04%2F29%2FMNGLD6CFND34.DTL |archivedate=September 19, 2009 |title=For early Googlers, key word is $$ |last=Kopytoff |first=Verne |date=April 29, 2004 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |publisher=Hearst Communications |accessdate=February 19, 2010 |location=San Francisco |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Google received money from three other [[angel investor]]s in 1998: [[Amazon.com]] founder [[Jeff Bezos]], Stanford University computer science professor [[David Cheriton]], and entrepreneur [[Ram Shriram]].&lt;ref name="1998 Investments"&gt;''On September 7, 1998, the day Google officially incorporated, he [Shriram] wrote out a check for just over $250,000, one of four of this size the founders received.'' {{Cite book |title=Googled: The End of the World As We Know It |last=Auletta |first=Ken |date=October 26, 2010 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=9780143118046 |edition=Reprint |location=New York, N.Y. |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 1999, Brin and Page decided they wanted to sell Google to [[Excite]]. They went to Excite CEO George Bell and offered to sell it to him for $1 million. He rejected the offer.

In September 2015, Google engineering manager Rachel Potvin revealed details about Google's software code at an engineering conference. She revealed that the entire Google codebase, which spans every single service it develops, consists of over 2 billion lines of code. All that code is stored in a code repository available to all 25,000 Google engineers, and the code is regularly copied and updated on 10 Google data centers. To keep control, Potvin said Google has built its own "version control system", called "Piper", and that "when you start a new project, you have a wealth of libraries already available to you. Almost everything has already been done." Engineers can make a single code change and deploy it on all services at the same time. The only major exceptions are that the PageRank search results algorithm is stored separately with only specific employee access, and the code for the Android operating system and the Google Chrome browser are also stored separately, as they don't run on the Internet. The "Piper" system spans 85 [[Terabyte|TB]] of data. Google engineers make 25,000 changes to the code each day and on a weekly basis change approximately 15 million lines of code across 250,000 files. With that much code, automated bots have to help. Potvin reported, "You need to make a concerted effort to maintain code health. And this is not just humans maintaining code health, but robots too.” Bots aren't writing code, but generating a lot of the data and configuration files needed to run the company's software. "Not only is the size of the repository increasing," Potvin explained, "but the rate of change is also increasing. This is an exponential curve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Cade |last=Metz |title=Google is 2 billion lines of code - and it's all in one place |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/09/google-2-billion-lines-codeand-one-place/ |website=Wired |date=September 16, 2015 |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Tarantola |title=Google's codebase is ludicrously huge for good reason |url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/09/18/googles-codebase-is-ludicrously-huge-for-good-reason/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=September 18, 2015 |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2010–present ====
In 2010, [[Google Energy]] made its first investment in a [[renewable energy]] project, putting $38.8&amp;nbsp;million into two [[wind farm]]s in [[North Dakota]]. The company announced the two locations will generate 169.5&amp;nbsp;megawatts of power, enough to supply 55,000 homes. The farms, which were developed by [[NextEra Energy Resources]], will reduce fossil fuel use in the region and return profits.

Google's [[AdWords]] allows advertisers to display their advertisements in the Google content network, through a cost-per-click scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Vangie |last=Beal |title=AdWords - Google AdWords |url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/adwords.html |website=Webopedia |publisher=QuinStreet Inc. |accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sister service, Google [[AdSense]], allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Vangie |last=Beal |title=AdSense - Google AdSense |url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/adsense.html |website=Webopedia |publisher=QuinStreet Inc. |accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility of [[click fraud]], which occurs when a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the advertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claimed that approximately 14 to 20&amp;nbsp; percent of clicks were fraudulent or invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mills |first=Elinor |url=http://news.cnet.com/Google-to-offer-advertisers-click-fraud-stats/2100-1024_3-6098469.html |title=Google to offer advertisers click fraud stats |work=news.cnet.com |publisher=CNET |date=July 25, 2006 |accessdate=July 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2003, Google stopped showing the advertisements of [[Oceana (non-profit group)|Oceana]], a non-profit organization protesting a major cruise ship's sewage treatment practices. Google cited its editorial policy at the time, stating "Google does not accept advertising if the ad or site advocates against other individuals, groups, or organizations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2004/05/17/google-somewhat-lifts-oceana-ad-ban |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130095413/http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2004/05/17/google-somewhat-lifts-oceana-ad-ban |archivedate=January 30, 2009 |title=Google Somewhat Lifts Oceana Ad Ban |publisher=webpronews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, Google reached an advertising agreement with Yahoo!, which would have allowed Yahoo! to feature Google advertisements on its web pages. The alliance between the two companies was never completely realized because of [[Competition law|antitrust]] concerns by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]]. As a result, Google pulled out of the deal in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bloggingstocks.com/2008/10/31/yahoo-and-google-may-dump-their-deal/print/ |title=Yahoo and Google may dump their deal |last=Mclntyre |first=Douglas |publisher=Bloggingstocks.com |date=October 31, 2008 |accessdate=October 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/11/ending-our-agreement-with-yahoo.html |title=Ending our agreement with Yahoo! |last=Drummond |first=David |date=November 5, 2008 |accessdate=October 26, 2010 |publisher=Google, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Google started rejecting all flash-based adverts replacing them by HTML5. Google's plan was to go “100% HTML5” beginning on January 2, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://latestgadgets.tech/2016/02/11/google-will-reject-flash-based-adverts-push-html5/|title=Google Will Reject All Flash Based Adverts In a Push For HTML5 • Latest Gadgets|date=February 11, 2016|work=Latest Gadgets|access-date=June 13, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[comScore]] market research from November 2009, [[Google Search]] is the dominant search engine in the United States market, with a [[market share]] of 65.6%.&lt;ref name="comscore"&gt;{{Cite news |date=December 16, 2006 |title=comScore Releases November 2009 U.S. Search Engine Rankings |url=http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2009/12/comScore_Releases_November_2009_U.S._Search_Engine_Rankings |accessdate=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google [[search engine indexing|indexes]] billions of web pages to allow users to search for the information they desire through the use of keywords and [[Operator (computer programming)|operators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Arrington |title=Google's Misleading Blog Post: The Size Of The Web And The Size Of Their Index Are Very Different |url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/07/25/googles-misleading-blog-post-on-the-size-of-the-web/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=July 25, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, ''[[The New York Times]]'' complained about Google's [[search engine indexing|indexing]], claiming that Google's [[web cache|caching]] of content on its site infringed its copyright for the content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1038_3-1024234.html |title=Google cache raises copyright concerns |last1=Olsen |first1=Stefanie |date=July 9, 2003 |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both ''[[Field v.

Google also hosts [[Google Books]]. The company began scanning books and uploading limited previews, and full books were allowed, into its new book search engine. The [[Authors Guild]], a group that represents 8,000 U.S. authors, filed a class action suit in a New York City federal court against Google in 2005 over this service. Google replied that it is in compliance with all existing and historical applications of copyright laws regarding books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=China |last=Martin |url=http://www.infoworld.com/t/platforms/google-hit-second-lawsuit-over-library-project-722 |title=Google hit with second lawsuit over Library project |publisher=[[InfoWorld]] |date=November 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google eventually reached a revised settlement in 2009 to limit its scans to books from the U.S., the UK, Australia, and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Pettersson, Edvard |title=Google Wins Preliminary Approval of Online Books Settlement |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ahUxORgasDFs |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67Qvo6uhf?url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ahUxORgasDFs |archivedate=May 5, 2012 |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |date=November 20, 2009 |accessdate=December 18, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Paris Civil Court ruled against Google in late 2009, asking it to remove the works of La Martinière ([[Éditions du Seuil]]) from its database.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{Cite news |author=Smith, Heather |title=Google's French Book Scanning Project Halted by Court |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=apZ3UG9CPLo8 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67QvoTecZ?url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=apZ3UG9CPLo8 |archivedate=May 5, 2012 |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |date=December 18, 2009 |accessdate=December 18, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In competition with [[Amazon.com]], Google sells digital versions of new books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Motoko |last=Rich |title=Preparing to Sell E-Books, Google Takes on Amazon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/01/technology/internet/01google.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 31, 2009 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21, 2010, in response to [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]], Google updated its image search to display a streaming sequence of [[thumbnail]]s that enlarge when pointed at. Although web searches still appear in a batch per page format, on July 23, 2010, dictionary definitions for certain English words began appearing above the linked results for web searches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/07/this-week-in-search-72510.html |title=This Week in Search 7/25/10 |last1=Mayer |first1=Marissa |publisher=Google, Inc. |date=July 25, 2010 |accessdate=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Hummingbird" update to the Google search engine was announced in September 2013. The update was introduced over the month prior to the announcement and allows users ask the search engine a question in natural language rather than entering keywords into the search box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Google introduces the biggest algorithm change in three years |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/27/google-biggest-algorithm-change-hummingbird |accessdate=September 29, 2013 |newspaper=Guardian |date=September 27, 2013 |author=Samuel Gibbs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Google announced two major changes to its mobile search results. The first change removes the "mobile-friendly" label that highlighted easy to read pages from its mobile search results page. For the second change, the company—starting on January 10, 2017—will punish mobile pages that show intrusive [[interstitial ad]]vertisements when a user first opens a page. Such pages will also rank lower in Google search results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Frederic |last=Lardinois |title=Google will soon start punishing mobile sites that show hard-to-dismiss popups |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/23/good-riddance/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=August 23, 2016 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, Google enabled a new "Personal" tab in Google Search, letting users search for content in their Google accounts' various services, including email messages from [[Gmail]] and photos from [[Google Photos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Barry |last=Schwartz |title=Google Adds Personal Tab To Search Filters |url=https://www.seroundtable.com/google-personal-tab-search-23912.html |website=Search Engine Roundtable |publisher=RustyBrick |date=May 26, 2017 |accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chaim |last=Gartenberg |title=Google adds new Personal tab to search results to show Gmail and Photos content |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/26/15701778/google-personal-tab-search-results-gmail-photos-images-maps-news-filter |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=May 26, 2017 |accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Innovation Time Off policy ===
{{Anchor|Innovation Time Off}}
As a motivation technique, Google uses a policy known as Innovation Time Off, where Google engineers are encouraged to spend 20% of their work time on projects that interest them. Some of Google's services, such as Gmail, Google News, [[Orkut]], and AdSense originated from these independent endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Bharat |last1=Mediratta |first2=Julie |last2=Bick |title=The Google Way: Give Engineers Room |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/jobs/21pre.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 21, 2007 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a talk at Stanford University, [[Marissa Mayer]], Google's Vice-President of Search Products and User Experience until July 2012, showed that half of all new product launches in the second half of 2005 had originated from the Innovation Time Off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video |people=Mayer, Marissa (speaker) |date=June 30, 2006 |title=Marissa Mayer at Stanford University |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soYKFWqVVzg |medium=Seminar |publisher=Martin Lafrance |accessdate=June 20, 2010 |time=11:33 |quote=Fifty percent of what Google launched in the second half of 2005 actually got built out of 20% time.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 October 2018, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published the ''[[Investigative journalism|exposé]]'', "How Google Protected [[Andy Rubin]], the ‘Father of Android’". The company subsequently announced that "48 employees have been fired over the last two years" for sexual misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Welch |first1=Chris |title=Google says 48 people have been fired for sexual harassment in the last two years |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18024486/google-sexual-harassment-people-fired-rubin-2-years-ceo |accessdate=31 October 2018 |publisher=The Verge |date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week after the article appeared, [[Google X]] (renamed X Development LLC in 2015) executive Rich DeVaul resigned pursuant to  a complaint of [[sexual harassment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Musil |first1=Steven |title=Google exec accused of sexual harassment leaves company |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-exec-accused-of-sexual-harassment-leaves-company/ |accessdate=31 October 2018 |publisher=CNET |date=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google's employees are hired based on a hierarchical system.

Following the company's IPO in 2004, founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page and CEO Eric Schmidt requested that their [[One-dollar salary|base salary be cut to $1]]. Subsequent offers by the company to increase their salaries were turned down, primarily because their main compensation continues to come from owning stock in Google. Before 2004, Schmidt made $250,000 per year, and Page and Brin each received an annual salary of $150,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul R. |last=La Monica |title=Google leaders stick with $1 salary |url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/03/31/technology/google/index.htm |website=CNN Money |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=March 31, 2006 |accessdate=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many employees have access to the corporate recreation center. Recreational amenities are scattered throughout the campus and include a workout room with weights and rowing machines, locker rooms, washers and dryers, a massage room, assorted video games, [[table football]], a baby grand piano, a billiard table, and ping pong. In addition to the recreation room, there are snack rooms stocked with various foods and drinks, with special emphasis placed on nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/corporate/culture.html |title=About the Googleplex |accessdate=March 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free food is available to employees 24/7, with the offerings provided by paid vending machines [[Pro rata|prorated]] based on and favoring those of better nutritional value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/life/print/2011/07/what-googles-famous-cafeterias-can-teach-us-about-health/241876/ |title=What Google's Famous Cafeterias Can Teach Us About Health |publisher=[[The Atlantic]] |author=[[Marion Nestle]] |date=July 2011 |accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, the company announced plans to install thousands of [[solar panel]]s to provide up to 1.6&amp;nbsp;mega[[watt]]s of electricity, enough to satisfy approximately 30% of the campus' energy needs.&lt;ref name="solar"&gt;{{cite web |last=Richmond |first=Riva |url=http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/google_plans_to_build_huge |title=Google plans to build huge solar energy system for headquarters |website=post1.net |publisher=[[MarketWatch]] |date=October 17, 2006 |accessdate=October 17, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160519010259/http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/google_plans_to_build_huge |archivedate=May 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system will be the largest [[Rooftop photovoltaic power station|solar power system]] constructed on a U.S. corporate campus and one of the largest on any corporate site in the world.&lt;ref name="solar" /&gt; In addition, Google announced in 2009 that it was deploying herds of [[goats]] to keep grassland around the Googleplex short, helping to prevent the threat from seasonal bush fires while also reducing the [[carbon footprint]] of mowing the extensive grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/mowing-with-goats.html |title=Official Google Blog: Mowing with goats |date=May 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/04/AR2009050400027.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |title=My Day With The Google Goats |first=MG |last=Siegler |date=May 3, 2009 |accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of trimming lawns using goats originated from [[Bob Widlar]], an engineer who worked for [[National Semiconductor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.national.com/rap/Horrible/sheep.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990506135340/http://www.national.com/rap/Horrible/sheep.html |archivedate=May 6, 1999 |title=Sheep Mow Lawns |publisher=[[National Semiconductor]] |accessdate=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Google faced accusations in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' of being an "energy glutton".

==== International locations ====
Internationally, Google has over 78 offices in more than 50 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/locations/?region=north-america|title=Google: Our Offices|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has product research and development operations in cities around the world, namely [[Sydney]] (birthplace location of [[Google Maps]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sydney |url=https://careers.google.com/locations/sydney/ |website=Google Careers |accessdate=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[London]] (part of [[Android (operating system)|Android]] development).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=London |url=https://careers.google.com/locations/london/ |website=Google Careers |accessdate=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, Google announced plans for a new [[London]] headquarter, a notable 1 million square foot office able to accommodate 4,500 employees. Recognized as one of the biggest ever commercial property acquisitions at the time of the deal's announcement in January,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Leo |last=Mirani |title=Inside Google's new 1-million-square-foot London office—three years before it's ready |url=https://qz.com/139794/inside-googles-new-1-million-square-foot-london-office-three-years-before-its-ready/ |website=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |publisher=[[Atlantic Media]] |date=November 1, 2013 |accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google submitted plans for the new headquarter to the [[Camden London Borough Council|Camden Council]] in June 2017.

=== Doodles ===
{{Main|Google Doodle}}
{{As of|1998|since=y|post=,}} Google has been designing special, temporary alternate logos to place on their [[homepage]] intended to celebrate [[holiday]]s, events, achievements and people. The first Google [[Doodle]] was in honor of the [[Burning Man|Burning Man Festival]] of 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/doodle4google/history.html |title=Doodle 4 Google |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/doodles/burning-man-festival |title=Burning Man Festival |date=August 30, 1998 |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doodle was designed by [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]] to notify users of their absence in case the servers crashed. Subsequent Google Doodles were designed by an outside contractor, until Larry and Sergey asked then-[[intern]] [[Dennis Hwang]] to design a logo for [[Bastille Day]] in 2000. From that point onward, Doodles have been organized and created by a team of employees termed "Doodlers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/12/meet-people-behind-google-doodles-logo |title=Meet the people behind the Google Doodles |publisher=The Guardian |date=April 12, 2014 |accessdate=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Easter eggs and April Fools' Day jokes ===
{{Main|List of Google April Fools' Day jokes|List of Google Easter eggs}}

Google has a tradition of creating [[April Fools' Day]] jokes. On April 1, 2000, [[Google's hoaxes#2000|Google MentalPlex]] allegedly featured the use of mental power to search the web.&lt;ref name="mentalplex"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/mentalplex/ |title=Google MentalPlex |date=April 1, 2000 |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Google announced a free Internet service called [[TiSP]], or Toilet Internet Service Provider, where one obtained a connection by flushing one end of a [[optical fiber|fiber-optic]] cable down their toilet.&lt;ref name="TiSP"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/tisp/ |title=Welcome to Google TiSP |date=April 1, 2007 |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2007, Google's Gmail page displayed an announcement for [[Gmail Paper]], allowing users to have email messages printed and shipped to them.&lt;ref name="gmail_paper"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mail.google.com/mail/help/paper/more.html |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20080315144610/http://mail.google.com/mail/help/paper/more.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 15, 2008 |title=Google Paper |date=April 1, 2000 |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, Google announced Gmail Custom time where users could change the time that the email was sent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://mail.google.com/mail/help/customtime/index.html |title=Gmail Custom Time: Google makes custom time |date=April 14, 2011 |publisher=Google |accessdate=April 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Google changed its company name to Topeka in honor of [[Topeka, Kansas]], whose mayor changed the city's name to Google for a short amount of time in an attempt to sway Google's decision in its new [[Google Fiber|Google Fiber Project]].&lt;ref name="Google Blog: A Different Kind of Company Name"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/different-kind-of-company-name.html |title=A different kind of company name |last1=Schmidt |first1=Eric |date=April 1, 2010 |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/04/01/business/main6353136.shtml |title=April Fools: Google Changes Name to Topeka |date=April 1, 2010 |publisher=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Google announced [[Gmail Motion]], an interactive way of controlling Gmail and the computer with body movements via the user's webcam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/216708/technology/googles-gmail-motion-launched-april-1 |title=Google's GMail Motion launched April 1 |date=April 1, 2011 |publisher=[[GMA News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google's services contain [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]], such as the [[Swedish Chef]]'s "Bork bork bork," [[Pig Latin]], "Hacker" or [[leet]]speak, [[Elmer Fudd]], [[International Talk Like a Pirate Day|Pirate]], and [[Klingon language|Klingon]] as language selections for its search engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/language_tools |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hT77QDRS?url=http://www.google.com/language_tools |archivedate=June 12, 2009 |title=Language Tools |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The search engine calculator provides the [[Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything]] from [[Douglas Adams]]' ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/search?q=answer+to+life+the+universe+and+everything |title=Google Search Results for 'answer to life the universe and everything' |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When searching the word "recursion", the spell-checker's result for the properly spelled word is exactly the same word, creating a recursive link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/search?q=recursion |title=Google Search Results for 'recursion' |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When searching for the word "[[anagram]]," meaning a rearrangement of letters from one word to form other valid words, Google's suggestion feature displays "Did you mean: nag a ram?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/search?q=anagram |title=anagram search |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Google Maps, searching for directions between places separated by large bodies of water, such as Los Angeles and Tokyo, results in instructions to "[[kayak]] across the [[Pacific Ocean]]." During [[FIFA World Cup 2010]], search queries including "[[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]" and "[[FIFA]]" caused the "Goooo...gle" page indicator at the bottom of every result page to read "Goooo...al!" instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asia.cnet.com/crave/google-celebrates-world-cup-with-gooooooooooal-62111461.htm |title=Google celebrates World Cup with Gooooooooooal! |website=CNET Asia |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=May 18, 2011 |author=Chan, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philanthropy ===

In 2004, Google formed the not-for-profit philanthropic [[Google.org]], with a start-up fund of $1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="philanthropy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.org/about.html |title=About the Foundation |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714080922/http://www.google.org/about.html |archivedate=July 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the organization is to create awareness about [[climate change]], global public health, and global poverty. One of its first projects was to develop a viable [[plug-in hybrid]] [[electric vehicle]] that can attain 100 miles per gallon. Google hired [[Larry Brilliant]] as the program's executive director in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Katie |last=Hafner |title=Philanthropy Google's Way: Not the Usual |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/14/technology/14google.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 14, 2006 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Megan Smith has {{as of|2009|2|23|alt=since}} replaced him has director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Miguel |last=Helft |title=Google Chief for Charity Steps Down on Revamp |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/technology/companies/24google.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 23, 2009 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Google announced its "project 10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;" which accepted ideas for how to help the community and then allowed Google users to vote on their favorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.project10tothe100.com/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hT8OddCZ?url=http://www.project10tothe100.com/ |archivedate=June 12, 2009 |title=Project 10 to the 100th |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; After two years of silence, during which many wondered what had happened to the program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/06/google-struggles-to-give-away-10-million/ |title=Google Struggles to Give Away $10&amp;nbsp;million |last1=Van Burskirk |first1=Elliot |date=June 28, 2010 |work=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |accessdate=September 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google revealed the winners of the project, giving a total of ten million dollars to various ideas ranging from non-profit organizations that promote education to a website that intends to make all legal documents public and online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/09/10-million-for-project-10100-winners.html |title=$10&amp;nbsp;million for Project 10^100 winners |date=September 24, 2010 |last1=Twohill |first1=Lorraine |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=September 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, in partnership with the [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]] (MSRI), Google hosted the first [[Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival]] at its headquarters in Mountain View.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDL7yoz1TGQ The 2007 [[Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival]] at Google was the founding of this event for middle school and high school students.] video&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Google donated 1&amp;nbsp;million euros to [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] to support the next five annual International Mathematical Olympiads (2011–2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jill |last=Duffy |title=Mathletes Receive €1M Donation from Google |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2376099,00.asp |website=[[PC Magazine]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=January 21, 2011 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imo2011.nl/node/39 |title=Google donating 1&amp;nbsp;million euros to IMO |date=January 20, 2011 |accessdate=February 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724154518/https://www.imo2011.nl/node/39 |archivedate=July 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, Google launched a "[[Legalize Love]]" campaign in support of [[gay rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/07/08/google-launches-legalise-love-gay-rights-campaign/ |title=Google launches 'Legalise Love' gay rights campaign |website=PinkNews.co.uk |accessdate=September 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tax avoidance ===
{{Further|Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Multinational tax schemes}}

Google uses various [[Tax avoidance|tax avoidance strategies]]. Out of the [[List of the largest information technology companies|five largest American technology companies]], it pays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues. Google between 2007 and 2010 saved $3.1 billion in taxes by shuttling non-U.S. profits through [[Ireland]] and the [[Netherlands]] and then to [[Bermuda]]. Such techniques lower its non-U.S. tax rate to 2.3 per cent, while normally the corporate tax rate in for instance the UK is 28 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Metz |first=Cade |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/10/22/google_double_irish_tax_loophole/ |title=Google slips $3.1bn through 'Double Irish' tax loophole. |publisher=The Register |date=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has reportedly sparked a French investigation into Google's [[transfer pricing]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Leach |first=Anna |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/10/31/google_france_tax_office_billion_euros/ |title=French gov 'plans to hand Google €1bn tax bill'&amp;nbsp;– report |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=October 31, 2012 |accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following criticism of the amount of corporate taxes that Google paid in the United Kingdom, Chairman Eric Schmidt said, "It's called capitalism. We are proudly capitalistic." During the same December 2012 interview, Schmidt confirmed that the company had no intention of paying more to the UK exchequer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/google-boss-im-very-proud-of-our-tax-avoidance-scheme-8411974.html |title=Google boss: I'm very proud of our tax avoidance scheme |last1=Kumar |first1=Nikhil |last2=Wright |first2=Oliver |date=December 13, 2012 |publisher=The Independent |accessdate=December 17, 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google Vice-President [[Matt Brittin]] testified to the [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] of the UK House of Commons that his UK sales team made no sales and hence owed no sales taxes to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Brid-Aine Parnell, May 17, 2013 |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/05/17/quotw_ending_may_17/ |title='I think you DO do evil, using smoke and mirrors to avoid tax' |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=May 17, 2013 |accessdate=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, Google reached a settlement with the UK to pay £130m in back taxes plus higher taxes in future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=John Gapper, January 23, 2016 |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d50ad5f4-c125-11e5-9fdb-87b8d15baec2.html |title=Google strikes £130m back tax deal |publisher=FT.com |accessdate=January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environment ===
{{As of|2007|since=y|post=,}} Google has aimed for carbon neutrality in regard to its operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jack |last=McGrath |title=Google's Green Initiative: Environmentally Conscious Technology |url=http://www.technobuffalo.com/2011/05/18/googles-green-initiative-environmentally-conscious-technology/ |publisher=''TechnoBuffalo'' |date=May 18, 2011 |accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google disclosed in September 2011 that it "continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes", almost 260 million watts or about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant. Total carbon emissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, mostly due to fossil fuels that provide electricity for the data centers. Google said that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels in 2010. An average search uses only 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, so all global searches are only 12.5 million watts or 5% of the total electricity consumption by Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Glanz |title=Google Details, and Defends, Its Use of Electricity |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/09/technology/google-details-and-defends-its-use-of-electricity.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 8, 2011 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Google launched a project centered on developing renewable energy, titled the "Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal (RE&lt;C)" project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google's Goal: Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal |url=http://googlepress.blogspot.no/2007/11/googles-goal-renewable-energy-cheaper_27.html |date=November 27, 2007 |accessdate=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project was canceled in 2014, after engineers Ross Koningstein and David Fork understood, after years of study, that "best-case scenario, which was based on our most optimistic forecasts for renewable energy, would still result in severe climate change", writing that they "came to the conclusion that even if Google and others had led the way toward a wholesale adoption of renewable energy, that switch would not have resulted in significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Ross |last1=Koningstein |first2=David |last2=Fork |title=What It Would Really Take to Reverse Climate Change |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/what-it-would-really-take-to-reverse-climate-change |publisher=''IEEE Spectrum'' |date=November 18, 2014 |accessdate=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, ''The Washington Post'' reported that Google had donated $50,000 to the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]], a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[think tank]] that calls human carbon emissions a positive factor in the environment and argues that global warming is not a concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Anatomy of a Washington dinner: Who funds the Competitive Enterprise Institute? |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/06/20/anatomy-of-a-washington-dinner-who-funds-the-competitive-enterprise-institute/ |accessdate=July 12, 2013 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=June 20, 2013 |author=Juliet Eilperin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, it was reported that Google had hosted a fundraising event for Oklahoma Senator [[Jim Inhofe]], who has called climate change a "hoax".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Google hosts fundraiser for climate change denying US senator |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jul/09/google-climate-denier-jim-inhofe |accessdate=July 12, 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=July 9, 2013 |author=Suzanne Goldenberg |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Google cut ties with the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC) after pressure from the Sierra Club, major unions and Google's own scientists because of ALEC's stance on climate change and opposition to renewable energy.&lt;ref name=LA&gt;{{cite news |title=Google pulls out of conservative group amid environmentalist pressure |author=EVAN HALPER |date=September 23, 2014 |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-google-gop-20140924-story.html |accessdate=October 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, Google bought 536 megawatts of wind power. The purchase made the firm reach 100% renewable energy. The wind energy comes from two power plants in South Dakota, one in Iowa and one in Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fortune.com/2017/12/01/google-clean-energy/ |title= Google Just Bought Enough Wind Power to Run 100% On Renewable Energy |date= November 30, 2017 |author= Grace Donnelly |work= Fortune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lobbying ===
In 2013, Google ranked 5th in [[Lobbying in the United States|lobbying]] spending, up from 213th in 2003. In 2012, the company ranked 2nd in campaign donations of technology and Internet sections.&lt;ref name=lobby1&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-google-is-transforming-power-and-politicsgoogle-once-disdainful-of-lobbying-now-a-master-of-washington-influence/2014/04/12/51648b92-b4d3-11e3-8cb6-284052554d74_story.html |title=Google, once disdainful of lobbying, now a master of Washington influence |work=[[The Washington Post]] |first1=Tom |last1=Hamburger |first2=Matea |last2=Gold |date=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Litigation ===
{{main|Google litigation}}

Google has been involved in a number of lawsuits including the [[High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation]] which resulted in Google being one of four companies to pay a $415 million settlement to employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rosenblatt |first=Joel |title=Apple-Google $415 Million No-Poaching Accord Wins Approval |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-02/tech-no-poaching-settlement-gets-judge-s-preliminary-approval |accessdate=January 24, 2016 |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |date=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, 2017, the company received a record fine of {{€|2.42 billion|link=yes}} from the [[European Union]] for "promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40406542 |title=Google hit with record EU fine over Shopping service |first=Leo |last=Kelion |date=June 27, 2017 |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the penalty, ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine said: "The hefty sum – the largest ever doled out by the EU's competition regulators – will sting in the short term, but Google can handle it. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, made a profit of $2.5 billion (€2.2 billion) in the first six weeks of 2017 alone. The real impact of the ruling is that Google must stop using its dominance as a search engine to give itself the edge in another market: online price comparisons." The company disputed the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2139097-googles-e2-4bn-fine-is-small-change-the-eu-has-bigger-plans/ |title=Google's €2.4bn fine is small change – the EU has bigger plans |publisher=newscientist.com |accessdate=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and controversy ==
{{main|Criticism of Google|Censorship by Google}}

Google's market dominance has led to prominent media coverage, including [[Criticism of Google|criticism of the company]] over issues such as [[Google tax avoidance|aggressive tax avoidance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jesse |last=Drucker |title=Google 2.4% Rate Shows How $60 Billion Is Lost to Tax Loopholes |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-10-21/google-2-4-rate-shows-how-60-billion-u-s-revenue-lost-to-tax-loopholes |website=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |date=October 21, 2010 |accessdate=January 22, 2017}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Criticism of Google#Page rank|search neutrality]], [[Criticism of Google#Copyright issues|copyright]], [[censorship by Google|censorship]] of search results and content,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/magazine/the-case-against-google.html |title=The Case Against Google |website=nytimes.com |date=February 20, 2018 |accessdate=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Google privacy|privacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6740075.stm |work=BBC News |title=Google ranked 'worst' on privacy |date=June 11, 2007 |accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jeffrey |last=Rosen |title=Google's Gatekeepers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/magazine/30google-t.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 28, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other criticisms include alleged misuse and manipulation of search results, its use of others' [[intellectual property]], concerns that its [[Data collection|compilation of data]] may violate people's [[Internet privacy|privacy]], and the [[energy consumption]] of its servers, as well as concerns over traditional business issues such as [[monopoly]], [[restraint of trade]], [[anti-competitive practices]], and [[patent infringement]].

Google adhered to the [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|Internet censorship policies of China]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4645596.stm|title=Google censors itself for China|last=|first=|date=January 25, 2006|work=|publisher=BBC News|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; enforced by means of filters colloquially known as "The [[Great Firewall of China]]". ''The Intercept'' reported in August 2018 that Google is developing for the people's Republic of China a censored version of its search engine (known as [[Dragonfly (search engine)|Dragonfly]]) "that will blacklist websites and search terms about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Google Plans to Launch Censored Search Engine in China, Leaked Documents Reveal · Ryan Gallagher |url=https://theintercept.com/2018/08/01/google-china-search-engine-censorship/ |work=The Intercept |date=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Disis |first=Jill|title=Google grilled over 'Project Dragonfly' at Senate hearing on data privacy |date=26 September 2018 |newspaper=CNN |url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/26/technology/google-dragonfly-senate-hearing/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926222719/https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/26/technology/google-dragonfly-senate-hearing/index.html |archive-date=26 September 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google's commitment to such robust idealism has been increasingly called into doubt due to a number of the firm's actions and behaviors which appear to contradict this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Holly |last=Baxter |title=Who's more evil – Facebook or Google? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/25/evil-facebook-google-beheading-email-abuse |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=October 25, 2013 |accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Roxane |last=Gay |title=The Blog That Disappeared |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/30/opinion/sunday/the-blog-that-disappeared.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 29, 2016 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following media reports about [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], NSA's massive electronic [[Mass surveillance|surveillance program]], in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Edward Snowden: Leaks that exposed US spy programme |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-23123964 |website=[[BBC News]] |date=January 17, 2014 |accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to leaks of said program, Google joined the PRISM program in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Glenn |last1=Greenwald |first2=Ewen |last2=MacAskill |title=NSA Prism program taps in to user data of Apple, Google and others |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=June 7, 2013 |accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 8, 2017, Google fired employee James Damore after he distributed [[Google memo|a memo]] throughout the company which argued that "Google's ideological echo chamber" and bias clouded their thinking about diversity and inclusion, and that it is also biological factors, not discrimination alone, that cause the average woman to be less interested than men in technical positions.&lt;ref name=NYTFired&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/business/google-women-engineer-fired-memo.html Google Fires Engineer Who Wrote Memo Questioning Women in Tech].

=== Legal controversies ===
In 2017, David Elliot and Chris Gillespie argued before the [[Ninth Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals]] that "google" had suffered [[genericide]]. The controversy began in 2012 when Gillespie acquired 763 domain names containing the word "google." Google promptly filed a complaint with the [[National Arbitration Forum]] (NAF). Elliot then filed a petition for canceling the Google trademark. Ultimately, the court ruled in favor of Google because Elliot failed to show a preponderance of evidence showing the genericide of "google."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/15-15809/15-15809-2017-05-16.html|title=Elliott v.

==History==
Green chemistry emerged from a variety of existing ideas and research efforts (such as [[atom economy]] and [[catalysis]]) in the period leading up to the 1990s, in the context of increasing attention to problems of chemical pollution and [[resource depletion]]. The development of green chemistry in Europe and the United States was linked to a shift in environmental problem-solving strategies: a movement from [[command and control regulation]] and mandated reduction of industrial emissions at the "end of the pipe," toward the active prevention of pollution through the innovative design of production technologies themselves. The set of concepts now recognized as green chemistry coalesced in the mid- to late-1990s, along with broader adoption of the term (which prevailed over competing terms such as "clean" and "sustainable" chemistry).&lt;ref name="WoodhouseBreyman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodhouse | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Breyman | first2 = S. | title = Green chemistry as social movement? | journal = Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 199–222 | date = 2005 | doi = 10.1177/0162243904271726 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Linthorst"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10698-009-9079-4 | title = An overview: Origins and development of green chemistry | journal = Foundations of Chemistry | volume = 12 | pages = 55 | year = 2009 | last1 = Linthorst | first1 = J. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] played a significant early role in fostering green chemistry through its pollution prevention programs, funding, and professional coordination. At the same time in the United Kingdom, researchers at the [[University of York]] contributed to the establishment of the Green Chemistry Network within the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]], and the launch of the journal ''[[Green Chemistry (journal)|Green Chemistry]]''.&lt;ref name="Linthorst" /&gt;

==Principles==
In 1998, [[Paul Anastas]] (who then directed the Green Chemistry Program at the US EPA) and [[John Warner (chemist)|John C. Warner]] (then of [[Polaroid Corporation]]) published a set of principles to guide the practice of green chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Anastas | first1 = Paul T. | authorlink1 = Paul Anastas | last2 = Warner | first2 = John C. | authorlink2 = John Warner (chemist) | title = Green chemistry: theory and practice | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = 1998 | location = Oxford [England]; New York | isbn = 9780198502340}}&lt;/ref&gt; The twelve principles address a range of ways to reduce the environmental and health impacts of chemical production, and also indicate research priorities for the development of green chemistry technologies.

The principles cover such concepts as:

* the design of processes to maximize the amount of raw material that ends up in the product;
* the use of [[renewable material]] feedstocks and [[renewable energy|energy]] sources;
* the use of safe, environmentally benign substances, including solvents, whenever possible;
* the design of [[Efficient energy use|energy efficient]] processes;
* [[Waste minimisation|avoiding the production of waste]], which is viewed as the ideal form of [[waste management]].

The '''twelve principles of green chemistry''' are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/greenchemistry/what-is-green-chemistry/principles/12-principles-of-green-chemistry.html|title=12 Principles of Green Chemistry - American Chemical Society|website=American Chemical Society|language=en|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''Prevention'''. Preventing waste is better than treating or cleaning up waste after it is created.
# '''[[Atom economy]].''' Synthetic methods should try to maximize the incorporation of all materials used in the process into the final product.
# '''Less hazardous chemical syntheses'''. Synthetic methods should avoid using or generating substances toxic to humans and/or the environment.
# '''Designing safer chemicals.''' Chemical products should be designed to achieve their desired function while being as non-toxic as possible.
# '''Safer solvents and auxiliaries'''. Auxiliary substances should be avoided wherever possible, and as non-hazardous as possible when they must be used.
# '''Design for energy efficiency'''. Energy requirements should be minimized, and processes should be conducted at ambient temperature and pressure whenever possible.
# '''Use of renewable feedstocks'''. Whenever it is practical to do so, renewable feedstocks or raw materials are preferable to non-renewable ones.
# '''Reduce derivatives'''. Unnecessary generation of derivatives—such as the use of [[protecting group]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s—should be minimized or avoided if possible; such steps require additional reagents and may generate additional waste.
# '''Catalysis'''. [[Catalysis|Catalytic]] reagents that can be used in small quantities to repeat a reaction are superior to [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] reagents (ones that are consumed in a reaction).
# '''Design for degradation'''. Chemical products should be designed so that they do not pollute the environment; when their function is complete, they should break down into non-harmful products.
# '''Real-time analysis for pollution prevention'''. Analytical methodologies need to be further developed to permit real-time, in-process monitoring and control ''before'' hazardous substances form.
# '''Inherently safer chemistry for accident prevention'''. Whenever possible, the substances in a process, and the forms of those substances, should be chosen to minimize risks such as explosions, fires, and accidental releases.

== Trends ==
Attempts are being made not only to quantify the ''greenness'' of a chemical process but also to factor in other variables such as [[chemical yield]], the price of reaction components, safety in handling chemicals, hardware demands, energy profile and ease of product workup and purification. In one quantitative study,&lt;ref name=ecoscale&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Redox|reduction]] of [[nitrobenzene]] to [[aniline]] receives 64 points out of 100 marking it as an acceptable synthesis overall whereas a synthesis of an [[amide]] using [[Sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide|HMDS]] is only described as adequate with a combined 32 points.

Green chemistry is increasingly seen as a powerful tool that researchers must use to evaluate the environmental impact of nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanotechproject.org/file_download/files/GreenNano_PEN8.pdf Green nanotechnology]&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[nanomaterials]] are developed, the environmental and human health impacts of both the products themselves and the processes to make them must be considered to ensure their long-term economic viability.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Examples==

===Green solvents===
Solvents are consumed in large quantities in many chemical syntheses as well as for cleaning and degreasing.  Traditional solvents are often toxic or are chlorinated.  Green solvents, on the other hand, are generally derived from renewable resources and biodegrade to innocuous, often a naturally occurring product.&lt;ref&gt;Prat, D.; Pardigon, O.; Flemming, H.-W.; Letestu, S.; Ducandas, V.; Isnard, P.; Guntrum, E.; Senac, T.; Ruisseau, S.; Cruciani, P.; Hosek, P., "Sanofi’s Solvent Selection Guide: A Step Toward More Sustainable Processes", Org. Proc. Res. Devel. 2013, 17, 1517-1525.  {{DOI|10.1021/op4002565}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, J.; Chin, B.; Huibers, P. D. T.; Garcia-Valls, R.; Hatton, T. A., "Solvent Replacement for Green Processing", Environ. Health Persp. 1998, 106, 253-271. {{DOI|10.2307/3433925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthetic techniques===
Novel or enhanced synthetic techniques can often provide improved environmental performance or enable better adherence to the principles of green chemistry. For example, the 2005 [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]] was awarded, to Yves Chauvin, Robert H. Grubbs and Richard R. Schrock, for the development of the [[Olefin metathesis|metathesis]] method in organic synthesis, with explicit reference to its contribution to green chemistry and "smarter production."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2005 | work=The Nobel Foundation  | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2005/press.html | accessdate=2006-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 review identified three key developments in green chemistry in the field of [[organic synthesis]]: use of [[supercritical carbon dioxide]] as green solvent, [[aqueous]] [[hydrogen peroxide]] for clean [[oxidation]]s and the use of hydrogen in [[asymmetric synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1039/B502713F| title = Pursuing practical elegance in chemical synthesis| journal = Chemical Communications| issue = 14| pages = 1807| year = 2005| last1 = Noyori | first1 = R. | authorlink = Ryōji Noyori}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some further examples of applied green chemistry are [[supercritical water oxidation]], [[on water reaction]]s, and [[dry media reaction]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[Bioengineering]] is also seen as a promising technique for achieving green chemistry goals. A number of important process chemicals can be synthesized in engineered organisms, such as [[shikimate]], a [[Tamiflu]] precursor which is [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermented]] by Roche in bacteria. [[Click chemistry]] is often cited{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} as a style of chemical synthesis that is consistent with the goals of green chemistry.  The concept of 'green pharmacy' has recently been articulated based on similar principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s12649-012-9146-2| title = Towards a Greener Pharmacy by More Eco Design| journal = Waste and Biomass Valorization| volume = 3| issue = 4| pages = 395| year = 2012| last1 = Baron | first1 = M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carbon dioxide as blowing agent====
In 1996, [[Dow Chemical]] won the 1996 Greener Reaction Conditions award for their 100% [[carbon dioxide]] blowing agent for [[polystyrene]] foam production. Polystyrene foam is a common material used in packing and food transportation.  Seven hundred million pounds are produced each year in the United States alone. Traditionally, [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]] and other [[ozone]]-depleting chemicals were used in the production process of the foam sheets, presenting a serious [[environmental hazard]]. Flammable, explosive, and, in some cases toxic hydrocarbons have also been used as CFC replacements, but they present their own problems.  Dow Chemical discovered that [[supercritical carbon dioxide]] works equally as well as a blowing agent, without the need for hazardous substances, allowing the polystyrene to be more easily recycled. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; used in the process is reused from other industries, so the net carbon released from the process is zero.

===Hydrazine===
Addressing principle #2 is the Peroxide Process for producing [[hydrazine]] without cogenerating salt. Hydrazine is traditionally produced by the [[Olin Raschig process]] from [[sodium hypochlorite]] (the active ingredient in many [[bleach]]es) and [[ammonia]].  The net reaction produces one equivalent of sodium chloride for every equivalent of the targeted product hydrazine:&lt;ref name="Ullmann"&gt;Jean-Pierre Schirmann, Paul Bourdauducq "Hydrazine" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a13_177}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:NaOCl  +  2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;   →   H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  NaCl  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

In the greener [[Peroxide process]] hydrogen peroxide is employed as the oxidant and the side product is water. The net conversion follows:
:2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O 
Addressing principle #4, this process does not require auxiliary extracting solvents. [[Methyl ethyl ketone]] is used as a carrier for the hydrazine, the intermediate ketazine phase separates from the reaction mixture, facilitating workup without the need of an extracting solvent.

===1,3-Propanediol===
Addressing principle #7 is a green route to [[1,3-Propanediol|1,3-propanediol]], which is traditionally generated from petrochemical precursors.  It can be produced from renewable precursors via the [[bioseparation of 1,3-propanediol]] using a [[genetically modified]] [[strain (biology)|strain]] of ''[[E. coli]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kurian, Joseph V. "A New Polymer Platform for the Future – Sorona from Corn Derived 1,3-Propanediol" Journal of Polymers and the Environment, Vol. 13, No. 2 (April 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[diol]] is used to make new polyesters for the manufacture of carpets.

===Lactide===
[[File:Lactide.png|thumb|144px|right|Lactide]]
In 2002, Cargill Dow (now [[NatureWorks]]) won the Greener Reaction Conditions Award for their improved method for [[polymerization]] of [[polylactic acid]] . Unfortunately, lactide-base polymers do not perform well and the project was discontinued by Dow soon after the award. [[Lactic acid]] is produced by fermenting corn and converted to [[lactide]], the cyclic dimer ester of lactic acid using an efficient, tin-catalyzed cyclization. The L,L-lactide enantiomer is isolated by distillation and polymerized in the melt to make a crystallizable [[polymer]], which has some applications including [[textiles]] and apparel, cutlery, and food packaging. [[Wal-Mart]] has announced that it is using/will use PLA for its produce packaging. The NatureWorks PLA process substitutes renewable materials for petroleum feedstocks, doesn't require the use of hazardous organic solvents typical in other PLA processes, and results in a high-quality polymer that is [[recyclable]] and compostable.

===Carpet tile backings===
In 2003 [[Shaw Industries]] selected a combination of polyolefin resins as the base polymer of choice for EcoWorx due to the low toxicity of its feedstocks, superior adhesion properties, dimensional stability, and its ability to be recycled. The EcoWorx compound also had to be designed to be compatible with nylon carpet fiber. Although EcoWorx may be recovered from any fiber type, nylon-6 provides a significant advantage. Polyolefins are compatible with known nylon-6 depolymerization methods. PVC interferes with those processes. Nylon-6 chemistry is well-known and not addressed in first-generation production. From its inception, EcoWorx met all of the design criteria necessary to satisfy the needs of the marketplace from a performance, health, and environmental standpoint.  Research indicated that separation of the fiber and backing through [[elutriation]], grinding, and air separation proved to be the best way to recover the face and backing components, but an infrastructure for returning postconsumer EcoWorx to the elutriation process was necessary. Research also indicated that the postconsumer carpet tile had a positive economic value at the end of its useful life. EcoWorx is recognized by MBDC as a certified [[cradle-to-cradle design]].

[[File:Isomers of oleic acid.png|thumb|right|''Trans'' and ''cis'' fatty acids]]

===Transesterification of fats===
In 2005, [[Archer Daniels Midland]] (ADM) and [[Novozymes]] won the Greener Synthetic Pathways Award for their [[enzyme]] interesterification process. In response to the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) mandated labeling of [[trans-fats|''trans''-fats]] on nutritional information by January 1, 2006, Novozymes and ADM worked together to develop a clean, enzymatic process for the [[interesterification]] of oils and fats by interchanging saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.  The result is commercially viable products without ''trans''-fats. In addition to the human health benefits of eliminating ''trans''-fats, the process has reduced the use of toxic chemicals and water, prevents vast amounts of byproducts, and reduces the amount of fats and oils wasted.

===Bio-succinic acid===
In 2011, the Outstanding Green Chemistry Accomplishments by a Small Business Award went to [[BioAmber Inc.]] for integrated production and downstream applications of bio-based [[succinic acid]]. Succinic acid is a platform chemical that is an important starting material in the formulations of everyday products. Traditionally, succinic acid is produced from petroleum-based feedstocks. BioAmber has developed process and technology that produces succinic acid from the fermentation of renewable feedstocks at a lower cost and lower energy expenditure than the petroleum equivalent while sequestering CO{{sub|2}} rather than emitting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.epa.gov/green-chemistry/2011-small-business-award |title=2011 Small Business Award |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laboratory chemicals===
Several [[laboratory]] chemicals are controversial from the perspective of Green chemistry. The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] created a "Green" Alternatives Wizard [http://ehs.mit.edu/greenchem/] to help identify alternatives. [[Ethidium bromide]], [[xylene]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[formaldehyde]] have been identified as "worst offenders" which have alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Coombs A. (2009). [http://www.the-scientist.com/2009/07/1/55/1/ Green at the Bench]. ''The Scientist''.&lt;/ref&gt; Solvents in particular make a large contribution to the environmental impact of chemical manufacturing and there is a growing focus on introducing Greener solvents into the earliest stage of development of these processes: laboratory-scale reaction and purification methods.&lt;ref&gt;J-C Bradley ''et al.'', [https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13065-015-0085-4 &amp;ldquo;Predicting Abraham model solvent coefficients&amp;rdquo;], ''Chemistry Central Journal'' 9:12 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; In the Pharmaceutical Industry, both GSK&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1039/c0gc00918k| title = Expanding GSK's solvent selection guide – embedding sustainability into solvent selection starting at medicinal chemistry| journal = Green Chemistry| volume = 13| issue = 4| pages = 854| year = 2011| last1 = Henderson | first1 = R.

== Legislation ==

===The EU===
In 2007, The EU put into place the [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals]] (REACH) program, which requires companies to provide data showing that their products are safe. This regulation (1907/2006) ensures not only the assessment of the chemicals' hazards as well as risks during their uses but also includes measures for banning or restricting/authorising uses of specific substances. ECHA, the EU Chemicals Agency in Helsinki, is implementing the regulation whereas the enforcement lies with the EU member states.

===United States===
The U.S. law that governs the majority of industrial chemicals (excluding pesticides, foods, and pharmaceuticals) is the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] (TSCA) of 1976. Examining the role of regulatory programs in shaping the development of green chemistry in the United States, analysts have revealed structural flaws and long-standing weaknesses in TSCA; for example, a 2006 report to the California Legislature concludes that TSCA has produced a domestic chemicals market that discounts the hazardous properties of chemicals relative to their function, price, and performance.&lt;ref&gt;

Passed in 1990, the [[Pollution Prevention Act of 1990|Pollution Prevention Act]] helped foster new approaches for dealing with pollution by preventing environmental problems before they happen.

In 2008, the State of California approved two laws aiming to encourage green chemistry, launching the [[California Green Chemistry Initiative]]. One of these statutes required California's [[California Department of Toxic Substances Control|Department of Toxic Substances Control]] (DTSC) to develop new regulations to prioritize "chemicals of concern" and promote the substitution of hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives. The resulting regulations took effect in 2013, initiating DTSC's ''Safer Consumer Products Program''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Contested definition==
There are ambiguities in the definition of green chemistry, and in how it is understood among broader science, policy, and business communities. Even within chemistry, researchers have used the term "green chemistry" to describe a range of work independently of the framework put forward by Anastas and Warner (i.e., the 12 principles).&lt;ref name="Linthorst" /&gt; While not all uses of the term are legitimate (see [[greenwashing]]), many are, and the authoritative status of any single definition is uncertain. More broadly, the idea of green chemistry can easily be linked (or confused) with related concepts like [[green engineering]], [[environmental design]], or [[sustainability]] in general. The complexity and multifaceted nature of green chemistry makes it difficult to devise clear and simple [[Green chemistry metrics|metrics]]. As a result, "what is green" is often open to debate.&lt;ref name="MatusBarriers"&gt;

[[File:Illusory discontinuity stimulus.wav|thumb|Example of illusory discontinuity stimulus: continuous tone with spectrally remote noise. The tone sounds discontinuous to some listeners.]]

'''Illusory discontinuity''' is an [[auditory illusion]] in which a continuous ongoing sound becomes inaudible during a brief, non-masking noise.  The illusion is perceived only by some listeners, but not by others, reflecting individual variation in hearing abilities. It has been estimated that among young adults 24% are susceptible to illusory discontinuity.&lt;ref name="PlosOne"&gt;Vinnik E, Itskov PM, Balaban E  (2011). "[http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0017266 Individual differences in sound-in-noise perception are related to the strength of short-latency neural responses to noise]." PLoS One. 6(2): e17266. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0017266}}. {{PMID|21387016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most susceptible listeners describe their sensations in terms of the sound actually containing a physical gap. 
The illusory discontinuity is strongest when the interrupting sound is short (50[[Millisecond|ms]]). Longer sounds elicit weaker illusory discontinuity; this effect may be related to better auditory segregation.&lt;ref name="Thesis"&gt;[https://digitallibrary.sissa.it/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1963/6179/PhD_Vinnik.pdf?sequence=1 Sounds in noise: Behavioral and neural studies of illusory continuity and discontinuity. Vinnik, Ekaterina PhD thesis, SISSA, 2009-11-02]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to other auditory illusions ==

Illusory discontinuity is antagonistic with [[illusory continuity of tones]] (auditory [[filling-in]]). While [[Illusory continuity of tones|illusory continuity]] restores perceptual continuity of obscured sounds, illusory discontinuity disrupts the perception even if the sound is indeed continuous. Listeners strongly susceptible to illusory discontinuity do not perceive illusory auditory continuity .

== Relation to auditory masking ==

The illusion is likely to be a novel form of informational masking (broadly defined as a degradation of auditory detection or discrimination of a signal embedded in a context of other similar sounds).&lt;ref name="Maskingpaper"&gt;Leek MR, Brown ME, Dorman MF (1991) Informational masking and auditory attention. Percept Psychophys. 50(3):205-14 {{PMID|1754361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illusory discontinuity cannot be explained by simultaneous [[Auditory masking|masking]], because it appears even if the noise is as far  as one octave away.

== Relation to auditory stream segregation ==

It has been suggested that illusory discontinuity is related to inability to segregate the ongoing sound from the interrupting noise,&lt;ref name="Thesis" /&gt; although more research is needed to prove this.

== Physiology ==

The mechanism of the illusory discontinuity is unknown. An [[Electroencephalography|electroencephalographic]] study has demonstrated that participants who were not prone to illusory discontinuity showed robust early neural responses at 40–66 ms after noise burst onset, whereas those prone to the illusion lacked these early responses.&lt;ref name="PlosOne" /&gt; This suggests that the individual variability in perceiving discontinuity illusion is related to neural processing of the interrupting sound.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12699">'''J. William Lloyd''' (never using his given name John) (June 4, 1857 – October 23, 1940) was an [[United States|American]] [[individualist]] [[anarchist]] from 1884 to around 1904. He was born in [[Westfield, New Jersey]]; he later moved to Kansas, then Iowa, then to experimental colonies in [[Tennessee]] and [[Florida]], before returning to New Jersey in 1888.  He based his anarchism upon [[natural law]], rather than on [[Egoist anarchism|egoism]] as [[Benjamin Tucker]] did.  His first book, "Wind-Harp Songs" (poetry), was published in 1895 ("Anarchists' March," a printed musical score with words by Lloyd, had been issued by Tucker in 1888).  He founded an anarchist group, The Comradeship of Free Socialists, in 1897.  His work, "The Red Heart in a White World: A Suggestive Manual of Free Society; Containing a Method and a Hope," formed the basis for it.  Lloyd later modified his position to [[minarchism]].

His life changed when in that year, reading Edward Carpenter while riding on a train to N.Y., he experienced "Cosmic Consciousness" (R.M. Bucke devoted a chapter to Lloyd in his 1901 book of that title).  This inspired his book, "Dawn-Thought on the Reconciliation: a Volume of Pantheistic Impressions and Glimpses of Larger Religion" (1900). 

He founded his magazine, "The Free Comrade," which first ran from 1900 to 1902.  There he championed anarchism, free love, Whitman ("Our American Shakespeare, and greater than he") and Edward Carpenter ("The greatest man of modern England").  In 1902 and 1904 were published his two utopian novels, "The Natural Man: A Romance of the Golden Age" and  "The Dwellers in Vale Sunrise: How They Got Together and Lived Happy Ever After.  A Sequel to 'The Natural Man,' Being an Account of the Tribes of Him."  

''The Free Comrade'' resumed publication in a new series, which ran from 1910 to 1912.  Lloyd now co-edited it with his friend Leonard D. Abbott, who financed its publication.  Between the end of the original series and the beginning of the new, Lloyd had stopped considering himself a pure anarchist, indeed joining the Socialist Party ("I am still anarchistic in the essential sense.... the great need of Socialism is a stronger infusion of Anarchism....").   Meanwhile his friend Abbott had moved from socialism towards anarchism.  They saw the new series "as an advocate of the juncture of the Anarchist and Socialist forces." 

Lloyd's writings appeared in [[Benjamin Tucker]]'s "[[Liberty (1881-1908)|Liberty]]"; in [[Moses Harman]]'s anarchist and free love journal, "Lucifer the Light Bearer";  the anarchist and sex-radical newspaper "Fair Play"; the anarchist paper "[[Free Society]],"  Horace Traubel's "Conservator";  etc.   He had  a column in "Ariel," published by the Christian Socialist George Littlefield.

He wrote hundreds of poems, many of which appeared in anarchist periodicals.

He wrote many books.  Besides those listed above, they include "Aw-Aw Tam Indian Nights: Being the Myths and Legends of the Pimas of Arizona" (1911);  "Karezza Method," a sex manual (first published clandestinely ca. 1918); "Eneres," published by Allen &amp; Unwin in 1929 and Houghton Mifflin in 1930, with an introduction by Havelock Ellis; and at least 14 other works, mostly poetry.

In "Edward Carpenter: In Appreciation," edited by Gilbert Beith (Allen &amp; Unwin, 1931), Will S. Monroe wrote, "Carpenter's most devoted American disciple is J. William Lloyd, who did more than any other follower in the United States (Ernest Crosby excepted) to familiarize our countrymen with his doctrines."

He contrasted his idea of free love to that of "the artistic free-lovers, the Bohemians":  "My view of sex is religious, I might almost say, touched with austerity.  Sex and love to me are sacred and woman their priestess.  Sex should not be cultivated as a sybaritic indulgence, but with reference always to spiritual uplift, mental inspiration, physical health, individual fulfillment and racial progress-- always with reference to higher uses." (Free Comrade, July 1910). 

Lloyd supported the Allies in World War I.  He moved to California in 1922.  In the 1930's he promoted the ideas of Edward Bellamy.  But throughout his life he maintained friendly relations with former associates.  He died in 1940.

Though at times called a "drugless physician," Lloyd never graduated from the water-cure medical college he attended as a young man.

Archival material by Lloyd can be found in the Labadie collection at the [[University of Michigan]] and at the von Mises Institute in Auburn, Alabama.

==Sex theorist==
A sex theorist, Lloyd strongly criticized patriarchy and sexual possessiveness and exclusivity. He viewed the historical fall of Matriarchy as "the great crime," and saw jealousy as akin to monopoly attained by legal power. He developed a concept which he called "The Larger Love."  As he wrote in 1929, "In my later twenties I conceived the most beautiful ideal of my whole life; one that has remained with me ever since, thru [sic] all the years, and which I feel is my special message to  humanity, my gospel and prophecy for the future....  The Larger Love, actualized, would be a state of human love- and sex-relation in which each human being of adult age, male or female, would normally have a Central Love, that is a mate who in loyalty, tenderness, reliability and fitness would fill the place of the mate in monogamic ideals, excepting that it would be expected and usually occur that each partner in this union would also have one or several Side Lovers, that is, close friends or mates of the opposite sex, whose affection might not express itself sexually, but could do so without any social surprize [sic] or reproach, and probably usually would do so, at least at certain times.  This whole group to form affectionally and spiritually a Love Family, or Love Group, socially recognized and approved as such, but not legally bound together in any way.  But as each side Lover would also normally have a Central Lover and center another group, it is plain that these love groups would be very closely intertwined and woven together."

His "Karezza Method" advocated sexual intercourse without seminal emission.   ("In the highest form and best expression of the art neither man nor woman has or desires to have the orgasm...")

In his Karezza book, Lloyd addresses such concerns as the question of semen buildup. He concluded from examples of sterilized men that semen is absorbed back into the body, if it is not let out.&lt;ref name="Lloyd1931"&gt;{{cite book

Lloyd openly questioned the trend toward viewing orgasm as purely beneficial. Concerning the male, he pointed to a standard stockbreeder practice to not let a bull or a stallion serve too many or too often so as not to devitalize him. This practical knowledge of businessmen to him was unbiased evidence on the effects of ejaculation.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd (1931), p. 60-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloyd observed that [[Coitus reservatus|karezza]] offered health benefits. For example, he said he knew it to “act like magic in painful menstruation,” and as a remarkable nerve sedative, even curing nervous headache. He also found it one of the best agents “for the benefit and cure of ordinary sexual weaknesses and ailments, including [[urethritis]] and [[prostatitis]].”

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In successful Karezza the sex-organs become quiet, satisfied, demagnetized, as perfectly as by the orgasm, while the rest of the body of each partner glows with a wonderful vigor and conscious joy … tending to irradiate the whole being with romantic love; and always with an after-feeling of health, purity and well-being. We are most happy and good-humored as after a full meal.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd (1931), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, he was “willing to concede that where the intercourse is of such a nature as to cause a congestion that is not sublimated, or where sexual congestion occurs and sublimation and [karezza] are not available, the orgasm may have a necessary place.”

In Lloyd’s day, some people objected to karezza on the grounds that it would encourage excessive indulgence in sexual relations. He responded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Those who do not use Karezza are vastly more liable to excess, and this usually from too frequent and intense orgasms, too frequent pregnancies, or too coarse, cynical and invasive an attitude. Where there is merely a physical itch or craving gratified, with no mutual tenderness or kindness, or perhaps actually against the desire or protest of one party, sex is always excessive.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd (1931), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lloyd offered many practical ideas for successful karezza, including the need for lovers to give in order to benefit from controlled intercourse. “Try to feel yourself a magnetic battery,” he advised.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As you acquire the habit of giving your sexual electricity out in blessing to your partner from your sex-organs, hands, lips, skin, eyes and voice, you will acquire the power to satisfy yourself and her without an orgasm. Soon you will not even think of self-control, because you will have no desire for the orgasm, nor will she.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd (1931), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Karezza, said Lloyd, is the greatest beautifier because it increases and makes enduring heart love. He advised that to increase sexual control, “keep the spiritual on top, dominant—loving is the first thing, and at-one-ment … of your souls, your real end.” “Sex is very close to soul.… [It only satisfies] when it unites souls, not merely copulates bodies for a thrill.”

In a chapter called “Does the Woman Need the Orgasm?” he explained in karezza, the lady “melts” her whole being to her partner and there is not an orgasm in the ordinary definition of the word, yet beneficial physical relaxation also occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd (1931), p. 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote that the full magnetic rapport of karezza occurs when:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Two souls and bodies seem as one, supported and floating on some divine stream in Paradise.… This is the real ideal and end of Karezza. You will finally enter into such unity that in your fullest embrace you can hardly tell yourselves apart and can read each other’s thoughts. You will feel a physical unity as if her blood flowed in your veins, her flesh were yours. For this is the Soul-Blending Embrace.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd (1931), p. 48, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[molecular biology]], a '''library''' is a collection of DNA fragments that is stored and propagated in a population of micro-organisms through the process of [[molecular cloning]].  There are different types of DNA libraries, including [[CDNA library|cDNA libraries]] (formed from [[Complementary DNA|reverse-transcribed RNA]]), [[Genomic library|genomic libraries]] (formed from genomic DNA) and randomized mutant libraries (formed by de novo gene synthesis where alternative nucleotides or codons are incorporated).  DNA library technology is a mainstay of current molecular biology, and the applications of these libraries depends on the source of the original DNA fragments.  There are differences in the [[cloning vectors]] and techniques used in library preparation, but in general each DNA fragment is uniquely inserted into a cloning vector and the pool of recombinant DNA molecules is then transferred into a population of [[bacteria]] (a [[Bacterial Artificial Chromosome]] or BAC library) or yeast such that each organism contains on average one construct (vector + insert).  As the population of organisms is grown in culture, the DNA molecules contained within them are copied and propagated (thus, "cloned").

==Terminology==
The term "library" can refer to a population of organisms, each of which carries a DNA molecule inserted into a cloning vector, or alternatively to the collection of all of the cloned vector molecules.

===cDNA libraries===
{{Main|cDNA library}}

A [[cDNA library]] represents a sample of the [[mRNA]] purified from a particular source (either a collection of cells, a particular tissue, or an entire organism), which has been converted back to a DNA template by the use of the enzyme [[reverse transcriptase]]. It thus represents the genes that were being actively transcribed in that particular source under the physiological, developmental, or environmental conditions that existed when the mRNA was purified. cDNA libraries can be generated using techniques that promote "full-length" clones or under conditions that generate shorter fragments used for the identification of "[[expressed sequence tag]]s".

cDNA libraries are useful in reverse genetics, but they only represent a very small (less than 1%) portion of the overall genome in a given organism.

Applications of cDNA libraries include:
* Discovery of novel genes
* Cloning of full-length cDNA molecules for ''in vitro'' study of gene function
* Study of the repertoire of mRNAs expressed in different cells or tissues
* Study of [[alternative splicing]] in different cells or tissues

===Genomic libraries===
{{Main|genomic library}}

A [[genomic library]] is a set of clones that together represents the entire genome of a given organism.  The number of clones that constitute a genomic library depends on (1) the size of the genome in question and (2) the insert size tolerated by the particular [[cloning vector]] system.  For most practical purposes, the tissue source of the genomic DNA is unimportant because each cell of the body contains virtually identical DNA (with some exceptions).

Applications of genomic libraries include:
* Determining the complete genome sequence of a given organism (see [[genome project]])
* Serving as a source of genomic sequence for generation of [[transgenic animal]]s through [[genetic engineering]]
* Study of the function of [[regulatory sequences]] ''in vitro''
* Study of [[genetic mutation]]s in [[cancer]] tissues

===Randomized mutant libraries===
In contrast to the library types described above, a randomized mutant library is created by de novo synthesis of a gene.&lt;ref name="mutant_library_construction"&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/g726736085083267/] Tian-Wen Wang, Hu Zhu, Xing-Yuan Ma, Ting Zhang, Yu-Shu Ma and Dong-Zhi Wei, Molecular Biotechnology
Volume 34, Number 1, 55-68: Mutant library construction in directed molecular evolution&lt;/ref&gt; During synthesis, alternative nucleotides or codons are incorporated into the DNA sequence at specific positions. This results in a mixture of double stranded DNA molecules which represent variants of the original gene. These variants can then be ligated into an expression vector, individual [[Cloning|clones]] can be created, and the encoded protein variants can be [[Protein expression (biotechnology)|expressed]].

The expressed proteins can then be screened for variants which exhibit favourable properties. Typically the properties that are to be improved by screening a randomized mutant library are the binding affinity of antibodies or other protein-protein interactions, the activity of enzymes, or the stability of a protein. Multiple cycles of creating gene variants and screening the expression products are typically involved in [[directed evolution]] experiments.

==Overview of library preparation techniques==

===DNA Extraction===
If creating an mRNA library (ie with cDNA clones), there are several possible protocols for isolating full length mRNA. To extract DNA for genomic DNA (also known as gDNA) libraries, a DNA mini-prep may be useful.

===Prepare Inserts===
cDNA libraries require care to ensure that full length clones of mRNA are captured as cDNA (which will later be inserted into vectors). Several protocols have been designed to optimise the synthesis of the 1st cDNA strand and the 2nd cDNA strand for this reason, and also to make directional cloning into the vector more likely. 

gDNA fragments are generated from the extracted gDNA by using non-specific frequent cutter restriction enzymes.

===Vectors===
The nucleotide sequences of interest are preserved as inserts to a [[plasmid]] or the genome of a [[bacteriophage]] that has been used to infect bacterial cells.

Vectors are propagated most commonly in bacterial cells, but if using a YAC (Yeast Artificial Chromosome) then yeast cells may be used. Vectors could also be propagated in viruses, but this can be time consuming and tedious. However, the high transfection efficiency achieved by using viruses (often phages) makes them useful for packaging the vector (with the ligated insert) and then introducing them into the bacterial (or yeast) cell. 

Additionally, for cDNA libraries, a system using the Lambda Zap II phage, ExAssist, and 2 E. coli species has been developed. A Cre-Lox system using loxP sites and the in vivo expression of the recombinase enzyme can also be used instead. These are examples of in vivo excision systems. In vitro excision involves subcloning often using traditional restriction enzymes and cloning strategies. In vitro excision can be more time-consuming and may require more "hands-on" work than in vivo excision systems. In either case, the systems allow the movement of the vector from the phage into a live cell, where the vector can replicate and propagate until the library is to be used.

==Using libraries==
This involves "screening" for the sequences of interest. There are multiple possible methods to achieve this.

'''Meister Cody''' is an [[Online game|online training game]] with an integrated diagnostic screening test for children with [[dyscalculia]] and math weakness, the [[CODY Assessment]]. It was developed as a part of the CODY Project,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.meistercody.com/en/page/science/ ''CODY Assessment'' Link to scientific based background of the CODY Project. Retrieved 2016-05-09]&lt;/ref&gt; a collaboration with psychologists and neuroscientists at the [[University of Münster]], and technology experts at ''Kaasa health'' (an [[mHealth]] tech company based in [[Düsseldorf]]). The [[educational video game]] is used by parents, teachers and therapists as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool. The scientific research at the [[University of Münster]] drove the development of the computer-based training software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-muenster.de/CODY/training.html ''CODY-Training'' Website of the University of Münster. Retrieved 2016-05-09]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
Before the training begins, children take the [[CODY Assessment]], a voluntary screening test that detects four dyscalculia relevant aspects: core markers (Dot Enumeration (DE), Magnitude Comparison (MCS, MCM)), number processing skills, calculation skills, and working memory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.meistercody.com/en/page/test-and-training/ ''Meister Cody Test'' Link to test and training page. Retrieved 2016-05-09]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, J.-T./ Holling, H.: ''Number sense or working memory? The effect of two computer-based trainings on mathematical skills in elementary school.''  In: Advances in Cognitive Psychology, 2014, vol. 10(2), pp. 59-67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, J.-T.: ''Developmental Dyscalculia. Causes, Characteristics, and Interventions.'' In: Zeitschrift für Psychologie, 2015, vol. 223, pp 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt;
The CODY training targets impaired number skills that could underlie dyscalculia. The focus lies on aspects of number and quantity processing, such as quantity-number-linkage, part-whole relationship, spatial ability, relational number perception, fact retrieval, [[subitizing]], understanding of the positional notation system and [[transcoding]].&lt;ref&gt;Landerl, K./ Kaufmann, L.: ''Dyskalkulie. Modelle, Diagnostik, Intervention'', 2008, pp. 120-122.&lt;/ref&gt; Training includes 19 different tasks. The first version of CODY training, which had four key tasks, was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial, and compared with a computer-based training of inductive reasoning. A meta-analysis by psychologists at the University of Münster about children with mathematical disorders showed: "Computer-based interventions were also effective".&lt;ref&gt;Chodura, S., Kuhn, J.-T., Holling, H.: ''Interventions for Children With Mathematical Difficulties: A Meta-Analysis. Special edited issue on developmental dyscalculia.'' In: Zeitschrift für Psychologie, 2015, vol. 223, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The math training is embedded in an adventure story and incorporates gamification via its reward system. Daily training (3–5 days per week) is recommended for maximum growth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.meistercody.com/en/page/science/ ''CODY Assessment'' Link to scientific based background of the CODY project. Retrieved 2015-08-06]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characters ==
The main character of the educational game is Meister Cody, a traveler, storyteller, scholar and master magician. He receives a call for help through his crystal ball from the Kingdom of Talasia. He asks the game player to assist Princess Namea and Prince Fandales to save Talasia. The epic story has many characters, such as the Genie, Port Master, Oracle, Forest Fairies and Ice Fairies. These characters give the child clues, support and motivation.

== Application ==
The game is aimed at elementary school children from the second to fourth grade, but it also develops basic math skills that could benefit children in kindergarten.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, C./ Petermann, F.:''Rechenstörungen'', 2007, pp. 26-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Meister Cody – Talasia is an adaptive [[Single player video game|single player game]].

'''Multi-disciplinary design optimization''' ('''MDO''') is a field of [[engineering]] that uses [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] methods to solve [[design]] problems incorporating a number of disciplines. It is also known as multidisciplinary optimization and multidisciplinary system design optimization (MSDO).

MDO allows designers to incorporate all relevant disciplines simultaneously.  The optimum of the simultaneous problem is superior to the design found by optimizing each discipline sequentially, since it can exploit the interactions between the disciplines.  However, including all disciplines simultaneously significantly increases the [[computational complexity theory|complexity]] of the problem.

These techniques have been used in a number of fields, including [[automobile]] design, [[naval architecture]], [[electronics]], [[architecture]], [[computer]]s, and [[electricity distribution]].  However, the largest number of applications have been in the field of [[aerospace engineering]], such as [[aircraft]] and [[spacecraft]] design.  For example, the proposed [[Boeing]] [[blended wing body]] (BWB) aircraft concept has used MDO extensively in the conceptual and preliminary design stages.  The disciplines considered in the BWB design are [[aerodynamics]], [[structural analysis]], [[Air propulsion|propulsion]], [[control theory]], and [[economics]].

==History==
Traditionally engineering has normally been performed by teams, each with expertise in a specific discipline, such as aerodynamics or structures.  Each team would use its members' experience and judgement to develop a workable design, usually sequentially.  For example, the aerodynamics experts would outline the shape of the body, and the structural experts would be expected to fit their design within the shape specified.  The goals of the teams were generally performance-related, such as maximum speed, minimum [[drag (physics)|drag]], or minimum structural weight.

Between 1970 and 1990, two major developments in the aircraft industry changed the approach of aircraft design engineers to their design problems.  The first was [[computer-aided design]], which allowed designers to quickly modify and analyse their designs.  The second was changes in the procurement policy of most [[airline]]s and military organizations, particularly the [[military of the United States]], from a performance-centred approach to one that emphasized [[Product lifecycle management|lifecycle]] cost issues.  This led to an increased concentration on economic factors and the attributes known as the "[[ilities]]" including [[manufacturability]], [[reliability (engineering)|reliability]], [[maintainability]], etc.

Since 1990, the techniques have expanded to other industries.  Globalization has resulted in more distributed, decentralized design teams.  The high-performance [[personal computer]] has largely replaced the centralized [[supercomputer]] and the [[Internet]] and [[local area network]]s have facilitated sharing of design information. Disciplinary design software in many disciplines (such as [[OptiStruct]] or [[NASTRAN]], a [[finite element analysis]] program for structural design) have become very mature.  In addition, many optimization algorithms, in particular the population-based algorithms, have advanced significantly.

=== Origins in structural optimization ===
Whereas optimization methods are nearly as old as [[calculus]], dating back to [[Isaac Newton]], [[Leonhard Euler]], [[Daniel Bernoulli]], and [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], who used them to solve problems such as the shape of the [[catenary]] curve, numerical optimization reached prominence in the digital age. Its systematic application to structural design dates to its advocacy by Schmit in 1960. The success of structural optimization in the 1970s motivated the emergence of multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) in the 1980s. Jaroslaw Sobieski championed decomposition methods specifically designed for MDO applications. The following synopsis focuses on optimization methods for MDO. First, the popular gradient-based methods used by the early structural optimization and MDO community are reviewed. Then those methods developed in the last dozen years are summarized.

=== Gradient-based methods ===
There were two schools of structural optimization practitioners using [[Gradient|gradient]]-based methods during the 1960s and 1970s: optimality criteria and [[Mathematical optimization|mathematical programming]]. The optimality criteria school derived recursive formulas based on the [[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions|Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) necessary conditions]] for an optimal design. The KKT conditions were applied to classes of structural problems such as minimum weight design with constraints on stresses, displacements, buckling, or frequencies [Rozvany, Berke, Venkayya, Khot, et al.] to derive resizing expressions particular to each class. The mathematical programming school employed classical gradient-based methods to structural optimization problems. The method of usable feasible directions, Rosen’s gradient projection (generalized reduce gradient) method, sequential unconstrained minimization techniques, sequential linear programming and eventually sequential quadratic programming methods were common choices. Schittkowski et al. reviewed the methods current by the early 1990s.

The gradient methods unique to the MDO community derive from the combination of optimality criteria with math programming, first recognized in the seminal work of Fleury and Schmit who constructed a framework of approximation concepts for structural optimization. They recognized that optimality criteria were so successful for stress and displacement constraints, because that approach amounted to solving the dual problem for [[Lagrange multipliers]] using linear Taylor series approximations in the reciprocal design space. In combination with other techniques to improve efficiency, such as constraint deletion, regionalization, and design variable linking, they succeeded in uniting the work of both schools. This approximation concepts based approach forms the basis of the optimization modules in modern structural design software such as Altair – Optistruct, ASTROS, MSC.Nastran, PHX [[ModelCenter]], Genesis, iSight, and I-DEAS.

Approximations for structural optimization were initiated by the reciprocal approximation Schmit and Miura for stress and displacement response functions. Other intermediate variables were employed for plates. Combining linear and reciprocal variables, Starnes and Haftka developed a conservative approximation to improve buckling approximations. Fadel chose an appropriate intermediate design variable for each function based on a gradient matching condition for the previous point. Vanderplaats initiated a second generation of high quality approximations when he developed the force approximation as an intermediate response approximation to improve the approximation of stress constraints. Canfield developed a [[Rayleigh quotient]] approximation to improve the accuracy of eigenvalue approximations. Barthelemy and Haftka published a comprehensive review of approximations in 1993.

=== Non-gradient-based methods  ===
In recent years, non-gradient-based evolutionary methods including [[Genetic algorithm|genetic algorithms]], [[Simulated annealing|simulated annealing]], and [[Ant colony optimization algorithms|ant colony algorithms]] came into existence. At present, many researchers are striving to arrive at a consensus regarding the best modes and methods for complex problems like impact damage, dynamic failure, and [[Real-time analyzer|real-time analyses]]. For this purpose, researchers often employ multiobjective and multicriteria design methods.

=== Recent MDO methods ===
MDO practitioners have investigated [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] methods in several broad areas in the last dozen years. These include decomposition methods, [[approximation]] methods, [[evolutionary algorithm]]s, [[memetic algorithm]]s, [[response surface methodology]], reliability-based optimization, and [[multi-objective optimization]] approaches.

The exploration of decomposition methods has continued in the last dozen years with the development and comparison of a number of approaches, classified variously as hierarchic and non hierarchic, or collaborative and non collaborative. 
Approximation methods spanned a diverse set of approaches, including the development of approximations based on [[surrogate model]]s (often referred to as metamodels), variable fidelity models, and trust region management strategies. The development of multipoint approximations blurred the distinction with response surface methods. Some of the most popular methods include [[Kriging]] and the [[moving least squares]] method.

[[Response surface methodology]], developed extensively by the statistical community, received much attention in the MDO community in the last dozen years. A driving force for their use has been the development of massively parallel systems for high performance computing, which are naturally suited to distributing the function evaluations from multiple disciplines that are required for the construction of response surfaces. Distributed processing is particularly suited to the design process of complex systems in which analysis of different disciplines may be accomplished naturally on different computing platforms and even by different teams.

Evolutionary methods led the way in the exploration of non-gradient methods for MDO applications. They also have benefited from the availability of massively parallel high performance computers, since they inherently require many more function evaluations than gradient-based methods. Their primary benefit lies in their ability to handle discrete design variables and the potential to find globally optimal solutions.

Reliability-based optimization (RBO) is a growing area of interest in MDO. Like response surface methods and evolutionary algorithms, RBO benefits from parallel computation, because the numeric integration to calculate the probability of failure requires many function evaluations. One of the first approaches employed approximation concepts to integrate the probability of failure. The classical first-order reliability method (FORM) and second-order reliability method (SORM) are still popular. Professor Ramana Grandhi used appropriate normalized variables about the most probable point of failure, found by a two-point adaptive nonlinear approximation to improve the accuracy and efficiency. [[Southwest Research Institute]] has figured prominently in the development of RBO, implementing state-of-the-art reliability methods in commercial software. RBO has reached sufficient maturity to appear in commercial structural analysis programs like Altair's [[OptiStruct|Optistruct]] and MSC's [[Nastran]].

Utility-based probability maximization (Bordley and Pollock, Operations Research, Sept, 2009, pg.1262) was developed in response to some logical concerns (e.g., Blau's Dilemma) with reliability-based design optimization. This approach focuses on maximizing the joint probability of both the objective function exceeding some value and of all the constraints being satisfied.  When there is no objective function, utility-based probability maximization reduces to a probability-maximization problem.   When there are no uncertainties in the constraints, it reduces to a constrained utility-maximization problem.  (This second equivalence arises because the utility of a function can always be written as the probability of that function exceeding some random variable.)   Because it changes the constrained optimization problem associated with reliability-based optimization into an unconstrained optimization problem, it often leads to computationally more tractable problem formulations.

In the marketing field there is a huge literature about optimal design for multiattribute products and services, based on experimental analysis to estimate models of consumers' utility functions. These methods are known as [[Conjoint analysis|Conjoint Analysis]]. Respondents are presented with alternative products, measuring preferences about the alternatives using a variety of scales and the utility function is estimated with different methods (varying from regression and surface response methods to choice models). The best design is formulated after estimating the model. The experimental design is usually optimized to minimize the variance of the estimators. These methods are widely used in practice.

==Problem formulation==

Problem formulation is normally the most difficult part of the process.  It is the selection of design variables, constraints, objectives, and models of the disciplines.  A further consideration is the strength and breadth of the interdisciplinary coupling in the problem.

===Design variables===

A design variable is a specification that is controllable from the point of view of the designer.  For instance, the thickness of a structural member can be considered a design variable.  Another might be the choice of material.  Design variables can be continuous (such as a wing span), discrete (such as the number of ribs in a wing), or boolean (such as whether to build a monoplane or a [[biplane]]).  Design problems with continuous variables are normally solved more easily.

Design variables are often bounded, that is, they often have maximum and minimum values.  Depending on the solution method, these bounds can be treated as constraints or separately.

One of the important variables that needs to be accounted is an uncertainty. Uncertainty, often referred to as epistemic uncertainty, arises due to lack of knowledge or incomplete information. Uncertainty is essentially unknown variable but it may causes the failure of system.

===Constraints===

A constraint is a condition that must be satisfied in order for the design to be feasible.  An example of a constraint in aircraft design is that the [[lift (force)|lift]] generated by a wing must be equal to the weight of the aircraft.  In addition to physical laws, constraints can reflect resource limitations, user requirements, or bounds on the validity of the analysis models.  Constraints can be used explicitly by the solution algorithm or can be incorporated into the objective using [[Lagrange multiplier]]s.

===Objectives===

An objective is a numerical value that is to be maximized or minimized.  For example, a designer may wish to maximize profit or minimize weight.  Many solution methods work only with single objectives.  When using these methods, the designer normally weights the various objectives and sums them to form a single objective.  Other methods allow multiobjective optimization, such as the calculation of a [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto front]].

===Models===

The designer must also choose models to relate the constraints and the objectives to the design variables.  These models are dependent on the discipline involved.  They may be empirical models, such as a [[regression analysis]] of aircraft prices, theoretical models, such as from [[computational fluid dynamics]], or reduced-order models of either of these.  In choosing the models the designer must trade off fidelity with analysis time.

The multidisciplinary nature of most design problems complicates model choice and implementation.  Often several iterations are necessary between the disciplines in order to find the values of the objectives and constraints.  As an example, the aerodynamic loads on a wing affect the structural deformation of the wing.  The structural deformation in turn changes the shape of the wing and the aerodynamic loads.  Therefore, in analysing a wing, the aerodynamic and structural analyses must be run a number of times in turn until the loads and deformation converge.

===Standard form===

Once the design variables, constraints, objectives, and the relationships between them have been chosen, the problem can be expressed in the following form:

: find &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;  that minimizes &lt;math&gt;J(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; subject to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{x})\leq\mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{h}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_{lb}\leq \mathbf{x} \leq \mathbf{x}_{ub} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is an objective, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] of design variables, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of inequality constraints, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{h}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of equality constraints, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_{lb}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_{ub}&lt;/math&gt; are vectors of lower and upper bounds on the design variables.  Maximization problems can be converted to minimization problems by multiplying the objective by -1.  Constraints can be reversed in a similar manner.  Equality constraints can be replaced by two inequality constraints.

==Problem solution==

The problem is normally solved using appropriate techniques from the field of optimization.  These include [[gradient]]-based algorithms, population-based algorithms, or others.  Very simple problems can sometimes be expressed linearly; in that case the techniques of [[linear programming]] are applicable.

===Gradient-based methods===
*[[Adjoint equation]]
*[[Newton's method]]
*[[Steepest descent]]
*[[Conjugate gradient]]
*[[Sequential quadratic programming]]

===Gradient-free methods===
* Hooke-Jeeves pattern search
* [[Nelder-Mead method]]

===Population-based methods===
*[[Genetic algorithm]]
*[[Memetic algorithm]]
*[[Particle swarm optimization]]
*[[Harmony search]]
*ODMA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00500-014-1536-x|title=ODMA: a novel swarm-evolutionary metaheuristic optimizer inspired by open source development model and communities|author1=Hossein Hajipour|author2=Hamed Behzadi Khormuji|author3=Habib Rostami|doi=10.1007/s00500-014-1536-x|journal=Soft Comput|year=2016|volume=20|page=727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other methods===
*Random search
*[[Grid search]]
*[[Simulated annealing]]
*[[Brute-force search|Direct search]]
*[[IOSO]] (Indirect Optimization based on Self-Organization)

Most of these techniques require large numbers of evaluations of the objectives and the constraints.  The disciplinary models are often very complex and can take significant amounts of time for a single evaluation.  The solution can therefore be extremely time-consuming.  Many of the optimization techniques are adaptable to [[parallel computing]].  Much current research is focused on methods of decreasing the required time.

Also, no existing solution method is guaranteed to find the [[global optimization|global optimum]] of a general problem (see [[No free lunch in search and optimization]]). Gradient-based methods find local optima with high reliability but are normally unable to escape a local optimum.  Stochastic methods, like simulated annealing and genetic algorithms, will find a good solution with high probability, but very little can be said about the mathematical properties of the solution.  It is not guaranteed to even be a local optimum.  These methods often find a different design each time they are run.

{{Literature}}
A '''novel''' is a relatively long work of [[narrative]] [[fiction]], normally in [[prose]], which is typically published as a [[book]].

The entire [[genre]] has been seen as having "a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years",&lt;ref name="The True Story of the Novel"&gt;Margaret Anne Doody, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BBYU6jyA3MUC&amp;pg=PA1 ''The True Story of the Novel'']. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1996, rept. 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;1. Retrieved 25 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; with its origins in classical [[Classical Greece|Greece]] and [[Classical Rome|Rome]], in [[medieval]] and early [[Modern history|modern]] [[Chivalric romance|romance]], and in the tradition of the Italian renaissance [[novella]]. (Since the 18th century, the term "novella", or "novelle" in German, has been used in English and other European languages to describe a long [[short story]] or a short novel.)

Murasaki Shikibu's ''[[Tale of Genji]]'' (1010) has been described as the world's first novel. Spread of printed books in China led to the appearance of [[Four Great Classical Novels|classical Chinese novels]] by the [[Ming dynasty#Literature and arts|Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644). Parallel European developments occurred after the [[Spread of the printing press|invention of the printing press]]. [[Miguel de Cervantes]], author of ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (the first part of which was published in 1605), is frequently cited as the first significant European [[novelist]] of the [[modern era]].&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster 1995"&gt;''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature''.  Kathleen Kuiper, ed. 1995. Merriam-Webster, Springfield, Mass.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Watt]], in ''The Rise of the Novel'' (1957), suggested that the modern novel was born in the early 18th century.

[[Walter Scott]] made a distinction between the novel, in which (as he saw it) "events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society" and the '''romance''', which he defined as "a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents".&lt;ref&gt;"Essay on Romance", ''Prose Works'' volume vi, p.&amp;nbsp;129, quoted in "Introduction" to Walter Scott's ''Quentin Durward'', ed. Susan Maning. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;xxv. Romance should not be confused with [[Harlequin Romance]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, many such romances, including the [[Historical novel|historical romances]] of Scott,&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction" to Walter Scott's ''Quentin Durward'', ed. Susan Maning, pp.&amp;nbsp;xxv–xxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''&lt;ref name="Moers, Ellen 1978"&gt;Moers, Ellen. ''Literary Women: The Great Writers''[1976] (London: The Women’s Press, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick] Robert McCrum, "The Hundred best novels: Moby Dick", ''The Observer'', Sunday 12 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; are also frequently called novels, and Scott describes romance as a "kindred term". This sort of romance is in turn different from the [[genre fiction]] love romance or [[romance novel]]. Other European languages do not distinguish between romance and novel: "a novel is ''le roman'', ''der Roman'', ''il romanzo''."&lt;ref name="Doody 1996, p. 15"&gt;Doody (1996), p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining the genre==
[[File:Madame de Pompadour.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Madame de Pompadour]] spending her afternoon with a book ([[François Boucher]], 1756)]]
A novel is a long, fictional narrative which describes intimate human experiences. The novel in the [[modern era]] usually makes use of a literary prose style. The development of the prose novel at this time was encouraged by innovations in [[printing]], and the introduction of cheap paper in the 15th century.

The present English (and Spanish) word for a long work of prose fiction derives from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''novella'' for "new", "news", or "short story of something new", itself from the [[Latin]] ''novella'', a singular noun use of the neuter plural of ''novellus'', diminutive of ''novus'', meaning "new".&lt;ref&gt;''Britannica Online Encyclopedia'' [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110453/novel] accessed 2 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Most European languages use the word "romance" (as in French, Dutch, Russian, Slovene, [[Serbo-Croatian]], Romanian, Danish, Swedish and Norwegian "roman"; Finnish "romaani"; German "Roman"; Portuguese "romance" and Italian "romanzo") for extended narratives.
* A fictional narrative
[[Fiction]]ality is most commonly cited as distinguishing novels from [[historiography]]. However this can be a problematic criterion. Throughout the [[early modern period]] authors of historical narratives would often include inventions rooted in traditional beliefs in order to embellish a passage of text or add credibility to an opinion. Historians would also invent and compose speeches for didactic purposes. Novels can, on the other hand, depict the social, political and personal realities of a place and period with clarity and detail not found in works of history.
* Literary prose
While prose rather than verse became the standard of the modern novel, the ancestors of the modern European novel include verse epics in the [[Romance languages|Romance language]] of southern France, especially those by [[Chrétien de Troyes]] (late 12th century), and in [[Middle English]] ([[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s (c. 1343 – 1400) ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Doody (1996), pp.&amp;nbsp;18–3, 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the 19th century, fictional narratives in verse, such as [[Lord Byron]]'s ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' (1824), [[Alexander Pushkin]]'s ''[[Eugene Onegin|Yevgeniy Onegin]]'' (1833), and [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]]'s ''[[Aurora Leigh]]'' (1856), competed with prose novels. [[Vikram Seth]]'s ''[[The Golden Gate (Vikram Seth novel)|The Golden Gate]]'' (1986), composed of 590 [[Onegin stanza]]s, is a more recent example of the verse novel.&lt;ref&gt;Doody (1996), p.&amp;nbsp;187.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Content: intimate experience
Both in 12th-century Japan and 15th-century Europe, prose fiction created intimate reading situations. On the other hand, verse epics, including the ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Aeneid]]'', had been recited to a select audiences, though this was a more intimate experience than the performance of plays in theaters. A new world of individualistic fashion, personal views, intimate feelings, secret anxieties, "conduct", and "gallantry" spread with novels and the associated prose-romance.
* Length
The novel is today the longest genre of narrative prose fiction, followed by the [[novella]]. However, in the 17th century, critics saw the romance as of epic length and the novel as its short rival. A precise definition of the differences in length between these types of fiction, is, however, not possible.The requirement of length has been traditionally connected with the notion that a novel should encompass the "totality of life."&lt;ref&gt;[[György Lukács]] ''The Theory of the Novel. A historico-philosophical essay on the forms of great epic literature'' [first German edition 1920], transl. by Anna Bostock (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tosa Mitsuoki—Portrait of Murasaki Shikibu.jpg|thumb|Paper as the essential carrier: [[Murasaki Shikibu]] writing her ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' in the early 11th century, 17th-century depiction]]
Although early forms of the novel are to be found in a number of places, including [[classical Rome]], 10th– and 11th-century Japan, and [[Elizabethan England]], the European novel is often said to have begun with ''[[Don Quixote]]'' in 1605.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster 1995" /&gt;

Early works of extended fictional prose, or novels, include works in [[Latin]] like the ''[[Satyricon]]'' by [[Petronius Arbiter|Petronius]] (c. 50 AD), and ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' by [[Apuleius]] (c. 150 AD), works in [[Ancient Greek]] such as ''[[Daphnis and Chloe]]'' by [[Longus]] (c. late second century AD), works in [[Sanskrit]] such as the 6th– or 7th-century ''[[Daśakumāracarita]]'' by [[Daṇḍin]], and in the 7th-century ''[[Kadambari]]'' by [[Banabhatta]], [[Murasaki Shikibu]]'s 11th-century Japanese work ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'', the 12th-century ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' (or ''Philosophus Autodidactus'', the 17th-century Latin title) by [[Ibn Tufail]], who wrote in [[Arabic]], the 13th-century ''[[Theologus Autodidactus]]'' by [[Ibn al-Nafis]], another Arabic novelist, and ''[[Blanquerna]]'', written in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] by [[Ramon Llull]] (1283), and the 14th-century Chinese ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' by [[Luo Guanzhong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henderson|first1=Jeffrey|title=Longus: Daphnis and Chloe; Xenophon of Ephesus: Anthia and Habrocomes|date=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press: Loeb Classical Library|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0674996335|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murasaki Shikibu's ''[[Tale of Genji]]'' (1010) has been described as the world's first novel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/581365/The-Tale-of-Genji "The Tale of Genji"]  Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Japanese''. Reischauer, Edwin O. Belknap Press.  Cambridge, MA 1980. p.&amp;nbsp;49. {{ISBN|0674471784}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and shows essentially all the qualities for which [[Madame de La Fayette|Marie de La Fayette]]'s novel ''[[La Princesse de Clèves]]'' (1678) has been praised: individuality of perception, an interest in character development, and psychological observation.&lt;ref&gt;''Identity in Asian Literature'' edited by Lisbeth Littrup. Richmond, Surrey: Curzon Press, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Urbanization and the spread of printed books in [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279) China led to the evolution of oral storytelling into fictional [[Four Great Classical Novels|novels]] by the [[Ming dynasty#Literature and arts|Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644). Parallel European developments did not occur until after the invention of the printing press by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in 1439, and the rise of the publishing industry over a century later allowed for similar opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/printing-press | title=Printing press &amp;#124; History &amp; Types}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, Ibn Tufail's ''Hayy ibn Yaqdhan'' and Ibn al-Nafis' ''Theologus Autodidactus'' are works of didactic philosophy and theology. In this sense, ''Hayy ibn Yaqdhan'' would be considered an early example of a [[philosophical novel]],&lt;ref name=Jon&gt;Jon Mcginnis, ''Classical Arabic Philosophy: An Anthology of Sources'', p.&amp;nbsp;284, [[Hackett Publishing Company]], {{ISBN missing}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Attar&gt;[[Samar Attar]], ''The Vital Roots of European Enlightenment: Ibn Tufayl's Influence on Modern Western Thought'', Lexington Books, {{ISBN missing}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Theologus Autodidactus'' would be considered an early theological novel.&lt;ref name=Meyerhof&gt;[[Muhsin Mahdi]] (1974), "''The Theologus Autodidactus of Ibn at-Nafis'' by Max Meyerhof, Joseph Schacht", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''94''' (2), pp.&amp;nbsp;232–34. {{doi|10.2307/600915}}. {{JSTOR|600915}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hayy ibn Yaqdhan'', with its story of a human outcast surviving on an island, is also likely to have influenced [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1719), because the work was available in an English edition in 1711.&lt;ref&gt;''The Improvement of Human Reason, exhibited in the life of Hai Ebn Yokdhan: written in Arabic above 500 Years ago, by Abu Jaafar Ebn Tophail'' [...] ''newly translated from the original Arabick, by Simon Ockley'' (London: W. Bray, 1711).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Epic poetry]] exhibits some similarities with the novel, and the Western tradition of the novel reaches back into the field of verse epics, though again not in an unbroken tradition. The epics of Asia, such as the [[Sumer]]ian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' (1300–1000 BC), and [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epics]] such as the ''[[Ramayana]]'' (400 BCE and 200 CE), and ''[[Mahabharata]]'' (4th century BC) were as unknown in [[early modern Europe]] as was the [[Anglo-Saxon]] epic of ''[[Beowulf]]'' (c. 750–1000 AD), which was rediscovered in the late 18th century and early 19th century. Other non-European works, such as the [[Torah]], the [[Koran]], and the [[Bible]], are full of stories, and thus have also had a significant influence on the development of prose narratives, and therefore the novel. Then at the beginning of the 18th century, French prose translations brought Homer's works to a wider public, who accepted them as forerunners of the novel.

Classical Greek and Roman prose narratives&lt;ref name="Morgan &amp; Stoneman"&gt;John Robert Morgan, Richard Stoneman, ''Greek fiction: the Greek novel in context'' (Routledge, 1994), Gareth L. Schmeling, and Tim Whitmarsh (hrsg.) ''The Cambridge companion to the Greek and Roman novel'' (Cambridge University Press 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; included a didactic strand, with the philosopher [[Plato]]'s (c. 425 – c. 348 BC) dialogues; a satirical dimension with [[Petronius]]' ''[[Satyricon]]''; the incredible stories of [[Lucian of Samosata]]; and [[Lucius Apuleius]]' proto-[[picaresque]] ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', as well as the heroic romances of the Greeks [[Heliodorus of Emesa|Heliodorus]] and [[Longus]]. Longus is the author of the Greek novel, ''[[Daphnis and Chloe]]'' (2nd century AD).&lt;ref name="Morgan &amp; Stoneman" /&gt;

===Chivalric Romances===
{{Main|Chivalric romance}}
[[File:Chaucer Troilus frontispiece.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] reciting ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'': early-15th-century manuscript of the work at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]]]]
Romance or chivalric romance is a type of [[narrative]] in [[prose]] or [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] popular in the aristocratic circles of [[High Middle Ages|High Medieval]] and [[Early Modern Europe]]. They were marvel-filled [[adventure]]s, often of a [[knight-errant]] with [[hero]]ic qualities, who undertakes a [[quest]], yet it is "the emphasis on heterosexual love and courtly manners distinguishes it from the ''[[chanson de geste]]'' and other kinds of [[epic poetry|epic]], which involve heroism."&lt;ref&gt;"Chivalric romance", in Chris Baldick, ed., ''Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', 3rd ed. (Oxford University Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; In later romances, particularly those of French origin, there is a marked tendency to emphasize themes of [[courtly love]].

Originally, romance literature was written in [[Old French]], [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] and [[Occitan]], later, in [[English language|English]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[German language|German]]. During the early 13th century, romances were increasingly written as prose.

The shift from verse to prose dates from the early 13th century. The ''[[Lancelot-Grail|Prose Lancelot]]'' or ''Vulgate Cycle'' includes passages from that period. This collection indirectly led to [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' of the early 1470s. Prose became increasingly attractive because it enabled writers to associate popular stories with serious histories traditionally composed in prose, and could also be more easily translated.&lt;ref&gt;See [[William Caxton]]'s preface to his 1485 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular literature also drew on themes of romance, but with [[Irony|ironic]], [[Satire|satiric]] or [[Burlesque (literature)|burlesque]] intent. Romances reworked [[legend]]s, [[fairy tale]]s, and history, but by about 1600 they were out of fashion, and [[Miguel de Cervantes]] famously [[burlesque]]d them in ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1605). Still, [[Medievalism|the modern image of medieval]] is more influenced by the romance than by any other medieval genre, and the word "medieval" evokes knights, distressed damsels, dragons, and such tropes.&lt;ref&gt;[[C.S. Lewis]], ''[[The Discarded Image]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;9 {{ISBN|0521477352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1800, the connotations of "romance" was modified with the development [[Gothic fiction]].

===The novella===
{{Main|Novella}}

The term "novel" originates from the production of short stories, or [[novella]] that remained part of a European oral culture of storytelling into the late 19th century. Fairy tales, jokes, and humorous stories designed to make a point in a conversation, and the [[exemplum]] a priest would insert in a sermon belong into this tradition. Written collections of such stories circulated in a wide range of products from practical compilations of examples designed for the use of clerics to compilations of various stories such as [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Decameron]]'' (1354) and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' (1386–1400). The ''[[Decameron]]'' (1354) was a compilation of one hundred [[novelle]] told by ten people—seven women and three men—fleeing the [[Black Death]] by escaping from [[Florence]] to the Fiesole hills, in 1348.

==Renaissance period: 1500–1700==
[[File:1474 Melusine Ausgabe Augsburg Johann Bämler Blatt 2.png|thumb|1474: The customer in the copyist's shop with a book he wants to have copied. This illustration of the first printed German [[Melusine]] looked back to the market of manuscripts.]]

The modern distinction between history and fiction did not exist in the early sixteenth century and the grossest improbabilities pervade many historical accounts found in the early modern print market. [[William Caxton]]'s 1485 edition of [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' (1471) was sold as a true history, though the story unfolded in a series of magical incidents and historical improbabilities. [[Sir John Mandeville]]'s ''Voyages'', written in the 14th century, but circulated in printed editions throughout the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;The [[English Short Title Catalogue|ESTC]] notes 29 editions published between 1496 and 1785 [http://estc.bl.uk/F/YMU7APITB3P8CLP4R6J16RSRKXTRGRN9HE79F36U1UPQP8QVU9-05108?func=short-sort&amp;set_number=093136&amp;sort_option=01---A02---A ESTC search result]&lt;/ref&gt; was filled with natural wonders, which were accepted as fact, like the one-footed Ethiopians who use their extremity as an umbrella against the desert sun. Both works eventually came to be viewed as works of fiction.

In the 16th and 17th centuries two factors led to the separation of history and fiction. The invention of printing immediately created a new market of comparatively cheap entertainment and knowledge in the form of [[chapbooks]]. The more elegant production of this genre by 17th- and 18th-century authors were ''[[belles lettres]]—''that is, a market that would be neither low nor academic. The second major development was the first best-seller of modern fiction, the Spanish ''[[Amadis de Gaula]]'', by García Montalvo. However, it was not accepted as an example of ''belles lettres''. The ''Amadis'' eventually became the archetypical romance, in contrast with the modern novel which began to be developed in the 17th century.

===Chapbooks===
{{Main|Chapbook}}
A chapbook is an early type of [[popular literature]] printed in [[early modern Europe]]. Produced cheaply, chapbooks were commonly small, paper-covered booklets, usually printed on a single sheet folded into books of 8, 12, 16 and 24 pages. They were often illustrated with crude [[woodcut]]s, which sometimes bore no relation to the text. When illustrations were included in chapbooks, they were considered [[popular prints]]. The tradition arose in the 16th century, as soon as [[printing press|printed]] books became affordable, and rose to its height during the 17th and 18th centuries and Many different kinds of [[ephemera]] and popular or folk literature were published as chapbooks, such as [[almanac]]s, [[children's literature]], [[Folklore|folk tales]], [[nursery rhyme]]s, [[pamphlet]]s, [[poetry]], and political and religious [[Tract (literature)|tracts]].&lt;ref name=mit.edu&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapbooks: Definition and Origins|url=http://web.mit.edu/21h.418/www/nhausman/chap1.html|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "chapbook" for this type of literature was coined in the 19th century. The corresponding French and German terms are ''[[bibliothèque bleue]]'' (blue book) and ''[[Volksbuch]]'', respectively.&lt;ref&gt;From ''[[chapmen]]'', chap, a variety of [[peddler]], which folks circulated such literature as part of their stock.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Margaret Spufford|last=Spufford|first=Margaret |date=1984|title= The Great Reclothing of Rural England|publisher= Hambledon Press|location= London|isbn= 978-0907628477}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Leitch, R. |date=1990|title='Here Chapman Billies Take Their Stand': A Pilot Study of Scottish Chapmen, Packmen and Pedlars|work=Proceedings of the Scottish Society of Antiquarians 120|pages= 173–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal historical subject matter of chapbooks was abridgements of ancient historians, popular medieval histories of knights, stories of comical heroes, religious legends, and collections of jests and fables.&lt;ref&gt;See Rainer Schöwerling, ''Chapbooks. Zur Literaturgeschichte des einfachen Lesers. Englische Konsumliteratur 1680–1840'' (Frankfurt, 1980), [[Margaret Spufford]], ''Small Books and Pleasant Histories. Pleasant Fiction and its Readership in Seventeenth-Century England'' (London, 1981) and Tessa Watt, ''Cheap Print and Popular Piety 1550–1640'' (Cambridge, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; The new printed books reached the households of urban citizens and country merchants who visited the cities as traders. Cheap printed histories were, in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially popular among apprentices and younger urban readers of both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;See Johann Friedrich Riederer German satire on the widespread reading of novels and romances: "Satyra von den Liebes-Romanen", in: ''Die abentheuerliche Welt in einer Pickelheerings-Kappe'', vol. 2 (Nürnberg, 1718). [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1718-liebes-romane.html online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

The early modern market, from the 1530s and 1540s, divided into low [[chapbooks]] and high market expensive, fashionable, elegant [[belles lettres]]. The ''[[Amadis]]'' and [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]]' ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' were important publications with respect to this divide. Both books specifically addressed the new customers of popular histories, rather than readers of ''belles lettres''. The Amadis was a multi–volume fictional history of style, that aroused a debate about style and elegance as it became the first best-seller of popular fiction. On the other hand, ''Gargantua and Pantagruel'', while it adopted the form of modern popular history, in fact satirized that genre's stylistic achievements. The division, between low and high literature, became especially visible with books that appeared on both the popular and ''belles lettres'' markets in the course of the 17th and 18th centuries: low  chapbooks included abridgments of books such as [[Miguel Cervantes]]' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1605/1615)

The term "chapbook" is also in use for present-day publications, commonly short, inexpensive booklets.&lt;ref name="mit.edu"/&gt;

===Heroic romances===
{{main|Heroic romances|17th-century French literature}}
Heroic Romance is a genre of imaginative literature, which flourished in the 17th century, principally in France.

The beginnings of modern fiction in France took a pseudo-[[bucolic]] form, and the celebrated ''[[L'Astrée]]'', (1610) of [[Honore d'Urfe]] (1568–1625), which is the earliest French novel, is properly styled a [[pastoral]]. Although its action was, in the main, languid and sentimental, there was a side of the Astree which encouraged that extravagant love of glory, that spirit of " panache", which was now rising to its height in France. That spirit it was which animated [[Marin le Roy de Gomberville]] (1603–1674), who was the inventor of what have since been known as the Heroical Romances. In these there was experienced a violent recrudescence of the old medieval elements of romance, the impossible valour devoted to a pursuit of the impossible beauty, but the whole clothed in the language and feeling and atmosphere of the age in which the books were written. In order to give point to the [[chivalrous]] actions of the heroes, it was always hinted that they were well-known public characters of the day in a romantic disguise.

===Satirical romances===
[[File:Richard Head 1666.png|left|thumb|[[Richard Head]], ''The English Rogue'' (1665)]]
Stories of witty cheats were an integral part of the European novella with its tradition of [[fabliaux]]. Significant examples include ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]'' (1510), ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]'' (1554), [[Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen|Grimmelshausen]]'s ''[[Der abenteuerliche Simplicissimus|Simplicissimus Teutsch]]'' (1666–1668) and in England [[Richard Head]]'s ''The English Rogue'' (1665). The tradition that developed with these titles focused on a hero and his life. The adventures led to satirical encounters with the real world with the hero either becoming the pitiable victim or the rogue who exploited the vices of those he met.

A second tradition of satirical romances can be traced back to [[Heinrich Wittenwiler]]'s ''Ring'' (c. 1410) and to [[François Rabelais]]' ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' (1532–1564), which parodied and satirized heroic romances, and did this mostly by dragging them into the low realm of the burlesque. Cervantes' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1606/1615) modified the satire of romances: its hero lost contact with reality by reading too many romances in the Amadisian tradition.

Other important works of the tradition are [[Paul Scarron]]'s ''Roman Comique'' (1651–57), the anonymous French ''Rozelli'' with its satire on Europe's religions, [[Alain-René Lesage]]'s ''[[Gil Blas]]'' (1715–1735), [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[Joseph Andrews]]'' (1742) and ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'' (1749), and [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Jacques the Fatalist]]'' (1773, printed posthumously in 1796).&lt;ref&gt;Compare also: Günter Berger, ''Der komisch-satirische Roman und seine Leser. Poetik, Funktion und Rezeption einer niederen Gattung im Frankreich des 17. Jahrhunderts'' (Heidelberg: Carl Winter Universitätsverlag, 1984), Ellen Turner Gutiérrez ''The reception of the picaresque in the French, English, and German traditions'' (P. Lang, 1995), and Frank Palmeri, ''Satire, History, Novel: Narrative Forms, 1665–1815'' (University of Delaware Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Histories===
[[File:1719-heathcot-robinson-crusoe.png|thumb|1719 newspaper reprint of ''Robinson Crusoe'']]
A market of literature in the modern sense of the word, that is a separate market for fiction and poetry, did not exist until the late seventeenth century. All books were sold under the rubric of "History and politicks" in the early 18th century, including [[pamphlet]]s, [[memoir]]s, [[travel literature]], political analysis, serious histories, romances, poetry, and novels.

That fictional histories shared the same space with academic histories and modern journalism had been criticized by historians since the end of the Middle Ages: fictions were "lies" and therefore hardly justifiable at all. The climate, however, changed in the 1670s.

The romance format of the quasi–historical works of [[Madame d'Aulnoy]], [[César Vichard de Saint-Réal]],&lt;ref&gt;See his ''Dom Carlos, nouvelle histoire'' (Amsterdam, 1672) and the recent dissertation by Chantal Carasco, ''Saint-Réal, romancier de l'histoire: une cohérence esthéthique et morale'' (Nantes, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras]],&lt;ref&gt;Jean Lombard, ''Courtilz de Sandras et la crise du roman à la fin du Grand Siècle'' (Paris: PUF, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anne-Marguerite Petit du Noyer]], allowed the publication of histories that dared not risk an unambiguous assertion of their truth. The literary market-place of the late 17th and early 18th century employed a simple pattern of options whereby fictions could reach out into the sphere of true histories. This permitted its authors to claim they had published fiction, not truth, if they ever faced allegations of libel.

Prefaces and title pages of 17th– and early 18th-century fiction acknowledged this pattern: histories could claim to be romances, but threaten to relate true events, as in the ''[[Roman à clef]]''. Other works could, conversely, claim to be factual histories, yet earn the suspicion that they were wholly invented. A further differentiation was made between private and public history: [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' was, within this pattern, neither a "romance" nor a "novel". It smelled of romance, yet the preface stated that it should most certainly be read as a true private history.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Defoe, [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1719-robinson-crusoe/p-iii.html ''Robinson Crusoe''] (London: W. Taylor, 1719)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cervantes and the modern novel===
{{See also|Picaresque novel}}

The rise of the novel as an alternative to the romance began with the publication of [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]]' ''[[Novelas ejemplares|Novelas Exemplares]]'' (1613). It continued with [[Paul Scarron|Scarron]]'s ''Roman Comique'' (the first part of which appeared in 1651), whose heroes noted the rivalry between French romances and the new Spanish genre.&lt;ref&gt;See Paul Scarron, ''The Comical Romance'', Chapter XXI. "Which perhaps will not be found very Entertaining" (London, 1700) with its call for the new genre. [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/library/e-1700-0002.html#c21 online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Late 17th-century critics looked back on the history of prose fiction, proud of the generic shift that had taken place, leading towards the modern novel/novella.&lt;ref&gt;See [Du Sieur,] "Sentimens sur l'histoire" in: ''Sentimens sur les lettres et sur l'histoire, avec des scruples sur le stile'' (Paris: C. Blageart, 1680) [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1683-1712-novels.html online edition] and Camille Esmein's ''Poétiques du roman. Scudéry, Huet, Du Plaisir et autres textes théoriques et critiques du XVIIe siècle sur le genre romanesque'' (Paris, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The first perfect works in French were those of Scarron and [[Madame de La Fayette]]'s "Spanish history" ''Zayde'' (1670). The development finally led to her ''[[La Princesse de Clèves|Princesse de Clèves]]'' (1678), the first novel with what would become characteristic French subject matter.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Europe witnessed the generic shift in the titles of works in French published in Holland, which supplied the international market and English publishers exploited the novel/romance controversy in the 1670s and 1680s.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Robert Letellier|Robert Ignatius Letellier]], ''The English novel, 1660–1700: an annotated bibliography'' (Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary critics listed the advantages of the new genre: brevity, a lack of ambition to produce epic poetry in prose; the style was fresh and plain; the focus was on modern life, and on heroes who were neither good nor bad.&lt;ref&gt;See the preface to ''The Secret History of Queen Zarah'' (Albigion, 1705)– the English version of Abbe Bellegarde, "Lettre à une Dame de la Cour, qui lui avoit demandé quelques Reflexions sur l'Histoire" in: ''Lettres curieuses de littérature et de morale'' (La Haye: Adrian Moetjens, 1702) [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1683-1712-novels.html online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; The novel's potential to become the medium of urban gossip and scandal fuelled the rise of the novel/novella. Stories were offered as allegedly true recent histories, not for the sake of scandal but strictly for the moral lessons they gave. To prove this, fictionalized names were used with the true names in a separate key. The ''[[Mercure Gallant]]'' set the fashion in the 1670s.&lt;ref&gt;DeJean, Joan. ''The Essence of Style: How the French Invented Fashion, Fine Food, Chic Cafés, Style, Sophistication, and Glamour'' (New York: Free Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Collections of letters and memoirs appeared, and were filled with the intriguing new subject matter and the [[epistolary novel]] grew from this and led to the first full blown example of scandalous fiction in [[Aphra Behn]]'s ''[[Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister]]'' (1684/ 1685/ 1687). Before the rise of the literary novel, reading novels had only been a form of entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, William B.

However, one of the earliest English novels, [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1719), has elements of the romance, unlike these novels, because of its exotic setting and story of survival in isolation. ''Crusoe'' lacks almost all of the elements found in these new novels: wit, a fast narration evolving around a group of young fashionable urban heroes, along with their intrigues, a scandalous moral, gallant talk to be imitated, and a brief, conciseness plot.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The new developments did, however, lead to [[Eliza Haywood]]'s epic length novel, ''Love in Excess'' (1719/20) and to [[Samuel Richardson]]'s ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]]'' (1741).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Some literary historians date the beginning of the English novel with Richardson's ''Pamela'', rather than ''Crusoe.''&lt;ref name="asj.upd.edu.ph"&gt;Cevasco, George A.

==18th century novels==
{{main|Augustan prose}}

The idea of the "rise of the novel" in the 18th century is especially associated with [[Ian Watt]]'s influential study ''The Rise of the Novel'' (1957).&lt;ref&gt;Ian Watt's, ''The Rise of the Novel: Studies in Defoe, Richardson and Fielding'' (London, 1957).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2018}} In Watt's conception, a rise in fictional realism during the 18th century came to distinguish the novel from earlier prose narratives.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rise of the Novel'' (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1963), p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1769 Laurence Sterne Tristram Shandy v6 p70.jpg|thumb|[[Laurence Sterne]], ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'', vol.6, pp.&amp;nbsp;70–71 (1769)]]

===Philosophical novel===
{{main|Philosophical fiction}}
The rising status of the novel in 18th-century can be seen in the development of philosophical&lt;ref&gt;See [[Jonathan Israel|Jonathan Irvine Israel]], ''Radical Enlightenment: Philosophy and the Making of Modernity 1650–1750'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2002), pp.&amp;nbsp;591–599, Roger Pearson, ''The fables of reason: a study of Voltaire's "Contes philosophiques"'' (Oxford University Press 1993), Dena Goodman, ''Criticism in action: Enlightenment experiments in political writing'' ([[Cornell University Press]] 1989), Robert Francis O'Reilly, ''The Artistry of Montesquieu's Narrative Tales'' (University of Wisconsin., 1967), and René Pomeau and Jean Ehrard, ''De Fénelon à Voltaire'' (Flammarion, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[experimental novel]]s.

Philosophical fiction was not exactly new. [[Plato]]'s dialogues were embedded in fictional narratives and his ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' is an early example of a [[Utopia]]. The tradition of works of fiction that were also philosophical texts continued with [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1516) and [[Tommaso Campanella]]'s ''[[The City of the Sun|City of the Sun]]'' (1602). However, the actual tradition of the [[philosophical novel]] came into being in the 1740s with new editions of More's work under the title ''Utopia: or the happy republic; a philosophical romance'' (1743).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Voltaire]] wrote in this genre in ''[[Micromégas|Micromegas: a comic romance, which is a biting satire on philosophy, ignorance, and the self-conceit of mankind]]'' (1752, English 1753). His ''[[Zadig]]'' (1747) and ''[[Candide]]'' (1759) became central texts of the French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and of the modern novel.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

An example of the [[experimental novel]] is [[Laurence Sterne]]'s ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' (1759–1767), with its rejection of continuous narration.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Britannica [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tristram-Shandy].&lt;/ref&gt; In it the author not only addresses readers in his preface but speaks directly to them in his fictional narrative. In addition to Sterne's narrative experiments, there has visual experiments, such as a marbled page, a black page to express sorrow, and a page of lines to show the plot lines of the book. The novel as a whole focuses on the problems of language, with constant regard to [[John Locke]]'s theories in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.&lt;ref name=griffin&gt;{{cite journal |last=Griffin |first=Robert J. |year=1961 |title=Tristram Shandy and Language |journal=College English |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=108–12|jstor=372959 |doi=10.2307/372959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The romance genre in the 18th century===
[[File:Richardson pamela 1741.jpg|left|thumb|[[Samuel Richardson]]'s ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded|Pamela]]'' (1741)]]

The rise of the word novel at the cost of its rival, the romance, remained a Spanish and English phenomenon, and though readers all over Western Europe had welcomed the novel(la) or short history as an alternative in the second half of the 17th century, only the English and the Spanish had, however, openly discredited the romance.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

But the change of taste was brief and [[François Fénelon|Fénelon's]] ''Telemachus'' (1699/1700) already exploited a nostalgia for the old romances with their heroism and professed virtue. [[Jane Barker]] explicitly advertised her ''Exilius'' as "A new Romance", "written after the Manner of Telemachus", in 1715.&lt;ref&gt;See the preface to her [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1715-exilius.html ''Exilius''] (London: E. Curll, 1715)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robinson Crusoe]] spoke of his own story as a "romance", though in the preface to the third volume, published in 1720, Defoe attacks all who said "that [...] the Story is feign'd, that the Names are borrow'd, and that it is all a Romance; that there never were any such Man or Place".

The late 18th century brought an answer with the [[romanticism|Romantic]] Movement's readiness to reclaim the word romance, with the [[gothic romance]], and the [[historical novel]]s of [[Walter Scott]]. ''Robinson Crusoe'' now became a "novel" in this period, that is a work of the new realistic fiction created in the 18th century.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===The sentimental novel===
{{main|Sentimental novel}}
Sentimental novels relied on emotional responses, and feature scenes of distress and tenderness, and the plot is arranged to advance emotions rather than action. The result is a valorization of "fine feeling", displaying the characters as models of refined, sensitive emotional effect. The ability to display such feelings was thought at this time to show character and experience, and to help shape positive social life and relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Maxwell and Katie Trumpener, eds., ''The Cambridge Companion to Fiction in the Romantic Period'' (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this genre is [[Samuel Richardson]]'s ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]]'' (1740), composed "to cultivate the Principles of Virtue and Religion in the Minds of the Youth of Both Sexes", which focuses on a potential victim, a heroine that has all the modern virtues and who is vulnerable because her low social status and her occupation as servant of a libertine who falls in love with her. She, however, ends in reforming her antagonist.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Male heroes adopted the new [[sentimental novel|sentimental]] character traits in the 1760s. [[Laurence Sterne]]'s [[Yorick]], the hero of the ''[[A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy|Sentimental Journey]]'' (1768) did so with an enormous amount of humour. [[Oliver Goldsmith]]'s ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield|Vicar of Wakefield]]'' (1766) and [[Henry Mackenzie]]'s ''Man of Feeling'' (1771) produced the far more serious role models.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Thees works inspired a [[Subculture|sub]]- and [[counterculture]] of [[pornography|pornographic]] novels, for which Greek and Latin authors in  translations had provided elegant models from the last century.&lt;ref&gt;The elegant and clearly fashionable edition of ''The Works of [[Lucian]]'' (London: S. Briscoe/ J. Woodward/ J. Morphew, 1711), would thus include the story of "Lucian's Ass", vol.1 pp.&amp;nbsp;114–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Pornography includes [[John Cleland]]'s ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' (1748), which offered an almost exact reversals of the plot of novel's that emphasised virtue. The prostitute Fanny Hill learns to enjoy her work and establishes herself as a free and economically independent individual, in editions one could only expect to buy under the counter.&lt;ref&gt;See Robert Darnton, ''The Forbidden Best-Sellers of Pre-Revolutionary France'' (New York: Norton, 1995), Lynn Hunt, ''The Invention of Pornography: Obscenity and the Origins of Modernity, 1500–1800'' (New York: Zone, 1996), Inger Leemans, ''Het woord is aan de onderkant: radicale ideeën in Nederlandse pornografische romans 1670–1700'' (Nijmegen: Vantilt, 2002), and Lisa Z. Sigel, ''Governing Pleasures: Pornography and Social Change in England, 1815–1914'' (January: Scholarly Book Services Inc, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Less virtuous protagonists can also be found in satirical novels, like [[Richard Head]]'s ''English Rogue'' (1665), that feature brothels, while women authors like [[Aphra Behn]] had offered their heroines alternative careers as precursors of the 19th-century [[femme fatale|femmes fatales]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aphra Behn]]'s ''[[Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister]]'' (1684/ 1685/ 1687)&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;

The genre evolves in the 1770s with, for example, Werther in [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' (1774) realising that it is impossible for him to integrate into the new conformist society, and [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]] in ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]]'' (1782) showing a group of aristocrats playing games of intrigue and amorality.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}.

===The social context of the 18th century novel===

====Changing cultural status====
By around 1700, fiction was no longer a predominantly aristocratic entertainment, and printed books had soon gained the power to reach readers of almost all classes, though the reading habits differed and to follow fashions remained a privilege. Spain was a trendsetter into the 1630s but French authors superseded [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], [[Francisco de Quevedo|de Quevedo]], and [[Mateo Alemán|Alemán]] in the 1640s. As [[Pierre Daniel Huet|Huet]] was to note in 1670, the change was one of manners.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Daniel Huet, ''The History of Romances'', transl. by Stephen Lewis (London: J. Hooke/ T. Caldecott, 1715), pp.&amp;nbsp;138–140.&lt;/ref&gt; The new French works taught a new, on the surface freer, gallant exchange between the sexes as the essence of life at the French court.

The situation changed again from 1660s into the 1690s when works by French authors were published in Holland out of the reach of French censors.&lt;ref&gt;See for the following: Christiane Berkvens-Stevelinck, H. Bots, P.G. Hoftijzer (eds.), ''Le Magasin de L'univers: The Dutch Republic as the Centre of the European Book Trade: Papers Presented at the International Colloquium, Held at Wassenaar, 5–7 July 1990'' (Leiden/ Boston, MA: Brill, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch publishing houses pirated of fashionable books from France and created a new market of political and scandalous fiction. This led to a market of European rather than French fashions in the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;See also the article on [[Pierre Marteau]] for a profile of the European production of (not only) political scandal.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1711 The Court and City Vagaries.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|right|Intimate short stories: ''The Court and City Vagaries'' (1711).]]

By the 1680s fashionable political European novels had inspired a second wave of private scandalous publications and generated new productions of local importance. Women authors reported on politics and on their private love affairs in The Hague and in London. German students imitated them to boast of their private amours in fiction.&lt;ref&gt;See ''George Ernst Reinwalds Academien- und Studenten-Spiegel'' (Berlin: J.A. Rüdiger, 1720), pp.&amp;nbsp;424–427 and the novels written by such "authors" as Celander, Sarcander, and Adamantes at the beginning of the 18th century.&lt;/ref&gt; The London, the anonymous international market of the Netherlands, publishers in Hamburg and Leipzig generated new public spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry Into a Category of the Bourgeois Society'' [1962], translated by Thomas Burger (MIT Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Once private individuals, such as students in university towns and daughters of London's upper class began write novels based on questionable reputations, the public began to call for a reformation of manners.&lt;ref&gt;See the ''Entertainments'' pp.&amp;nbsp;74–77, Jane Barker's preface to her [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1715-exilius.html ''Exilius''] (London: E. Curll, 1715), and ''George Ernst Reinwalds Academien- und Studenten-Spiegel'' (Berlin: J.A. Rüdiger, 1720), pp.&amp;nbsp;424–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important development in Britain, at the beginning of the century, was that new journals like ''[[Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'' and ''[[Tatler (1709)|The Tatler]]'' reviewed novels. In Germany [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s ''Briefe, die neuste Literatur betreffend'' (1758) appeared in the middle of the century with reviews of art and fiction. By the 1780s such reviews played had an important role in introducing new works of fiction to the public.

Influenced by the new journals, reform became the main goal of the second generation of 18th-century novelists. ''The Spectator'' Number 10 had stated that the aim was now "to enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with morality […] to bring philosophy out of the closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables and coffeehouses"). Constructive criticism of novels had until then been rare.&lt;ref&gt;See Hugh Barr Nisbet, Claude Rawson (eds.), ''The Cambridge history of literary criticism'', vol. IV (Cambridge University Press 1997); and Ernst Weber, ''Texte zur Romantheorie: (1626–1781)'', 2 vols. (München: Fink, 1974/ 1981) and the individual volumes of Dennis Poupard (et al.), ''Literature Criticism from 1400 to 1800: '' (Detroit, Mich.: Gale Research Co, 1984 ff.).&lt;/ref&gt; The first treatise on the history of the novel was a preface to Marie de La Fayette's  novel ''Zayde'' (1670).

A much later development was the introduction of novels into school and later university curricula.{{when|date=July 2018}}

====The acceptance of novels as literature====

The French churchman and scholar [[Pierre Daniel Huet]]'s ''[[Traitté de l'origine des romans]]'' (1670) laid the ground for a greater acceptance of the novel as literature, that is comparable to the [[classics]], in the early 18th century. The theologian had not only dared to praise fictions, but he had also explained techniques of theological interpretation of fiction, which was a novelty. Furthermore, readers of  novels and romances could gain insight not only into their own culture, but also that of distant, exotic countries.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

When the decades around 1700 saw the appearance of new editions of the classical authors [[Petronius]], [[Lucian]], and [[Heliodorus of Emesa]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Works of T. Petronius Arbiter'' [...] ''second edition'' [...] (London: S. Briscoe/ J. Woodward/ J. Morphew, 1710); ''The Works of Lucian,'', 2 vols. (London: S. Briscoe/ J. Woodward/ J. Morphew, 1711). See ''The Adventures of Theagenes and Chariclia'' [...]'', 2 vols. (London: W. Taylor/ E. Curll/ R. Gosling/ J. Hooke/ J. Browne/ J. Osborn, 1717),&lt;/ref&gt; the publishers equipped them with prefaces that referred to Huet's treatise. and the [[Western canon|canon]] it had established. Also exotic works of Middle Eastern fiction entered the market that gave insight into Islamic culture. ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]'' was first published in Europe from 1704 to 1715 in French, and then translated immediately into English and German, and was seen as a contribution to Huet's history of romances.&lt;ref&gt;August Bohse's (alias Talander) "Preface" to the German edition. (Leipzig: J.L. Gleditsch/ M.G. Weidmann, 1710).&lt;/ref&gt;

The English, ''Select Collection of Novels in six volumes'' (1720–22), is a milestone in this development of the novel's prestige. It included Huet's ''Treatise'', along with the European tradition of the modern novel of the day: that is, novella from [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]'s to [[Marie de La Fayette]]'s masterpieces. [[Aphra Behn]]'s novels had appeared in the 1680s but became classics when reprinted in collections. [[François Fénelon|Fénelon]]'s ''Telemachus'' (1699/1700) became a classic three years after its publication. New authors entering the market were now ready to use their personal names rather than pseudonyms, including [[Eliza Haywood]], who in 1719 following in the footsteps of Aphra Behn used her name with unprecedented pride.

==19th century novels==

===Romanticism===
{{main|Romanticism}}
{{See also|Newgate novel}}
[[File:Walter Scott Waverley illustration (Pettie-Huth).jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|Image from a Victorian edition of [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'']]
The very word [[romanticism]] is connected to the idea of romance, and the romance genre experienced a revival, at the end of the 18th century, with [[gothic fiction]], that began in 1746 with English author [[Horace Walpole]]'s ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'', subtitled (in its second edition) "A Gothic Story". Other important works are [[Ann Radcliffe]]'s ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'' (1794) and [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|'Monk' Lewis]]'s ''[[The Monk]]'' (1795).

The new romances challenged the idea that the novel involved a [[realism (arts)|realistic]] depictions of life, and destabilized the difference the critics had been trying to establish, between serious classical art and popular fiction. Gothic romances exploited the [[grotesque]],&lt;ref&gt;See Geoffrey Galt Harpham,'' On the Grotesque: Strategies of Contradiction in Art and Literature'', 2nd ed. (Davies Group, Publishers, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and some critics thought that their subject matter deserved less credit than the worst medieval tales of [[Arthurian romance|Arthurian knighthood]].&lt;ref&gt;See Gerald Ernest Paul Gillespie, Manfred Engel, and Bernard Dieterle, ''Romantic prose fiction'' (John Benjamin's Publishing Company, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of this new type of fiction were accused of exploiting all available topics to thrill, arouse, or horrify their audience. These new [[romanticism|romantic]] novelists, however, claimed that they were exploring  the entire realm of fictionality. And psychological interpreters, in the early 19th century, read these works as encounters with the deeper hidden truth of the human imagination: this included sexuality, [[Angst|anxieties]], and insatiable [[desire (emotion)|desires]]. Under such readings, novels were described as exploring deeper human motives, and it was suggested that such artistic freedom would reveal what had not previously been openly visible.

The romances of [[Marquis de Sade|de Sade]], ''[[The 120 Days of Sodom|Les 120 Journées de Sodome]]'' (1785), [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]]'s ''[[Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque]]'' (1840), [[Mary Shelley]], ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818), and [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]], ''[[Die Elixiere des Teufels]]'' (1815), would later attract 20th-century psychoanalysts and supply the images for 20th- and 21st-century horror films, [[romance novel|love romances]], [[fantasy]] novels, [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] computer games, and the [[surrealism|surrealists]].

The [[historical romance]] was also important at this time. But, while earlier writers of these romances paid little attention to historical reality, [[Walter Scott]]'s [[historical novel]] ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'' (1814) broke with this tradition, and he invented "the true historical novel".&lt;ref name="The Bloomsbury Guide p. 885"&gt;''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', ed. Marion Wynne Davis. New York: Prentice Hall, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;885.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time he was influenced by [[gothic romance]], and had collaborated in 1801 with [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|'Monk' Lewis]] on ''Tales of Wonder''.&lt;ref name="The Bloomsbury Guide p. 885" /&gt; With his [[Waverley novels]] Scott "hoped to do for the Scottish border" what [[Goethe]] and other German poets "had done for the [[Middle Ages]], "and make its past live again in modern romance".&lt;ref&gt;''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', ed. Marion Wynne Davis, p.&amp;nbsp;884.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott's novels "are in the mode he himself defined as romance, 'the interest of which turns upon marvelous and uncommon incidents'".&lt;ref name=norton&gt;''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', vol.2, 7th edition, ed. M.H. Abrams. New York: Norton, 2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; He used his imagination to re-evaluate history by rendering things, incidents and protagonists in the way only the novelist could do. His work remained historical fiction, yet it questioned existing historical perceptions. The use of historical research was an important tool: Scott, the novelist, resorted to documentary sources as any historian would have done, but as a romantic he gave his subject a deeper imaginative and emotional significance.&lt;ref name=norton/&gt; By combining research with "marvelous and uncommon incidents", Scott attracted a far wider market than any historian could, and was the most famous novelist of his generation, throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="The Bloomsbury Guide p. 885" /&gt;

In the 19th century the relationship between authors, publishers, and readers, changed. Authors originally had only received payment for their manuscript, however, changes in [[History of copyright law|copyright laws]], which began in 18th and continued into 19th century&lt;ref&gt;See Mark Rose, ''Authors and Owners: The Invention of Copyright'' 3rd ed. (Harvard University Press, 1993) and Joseph Lowenstein, ''The Author's Due: Printing and the Prehistory of Copyright'' (University of Chicago Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; promised royalties on all future editions. Another change in the 19th century was that novelists began to read their works in theaters, halls, and bookshops.&lt;ref&gt;See Susan Esmann, "Die Autorenlesung&amp;nbsp;– eine Form der Literaturvermittlung", ''Kritische Ausgabe'' 1/2007 [http://kritische-ausgabe.de/hefte/werkstatt/esmann.pdf PDF; 0,8 MB].&lt;/ref&gt; Also during the nineteenth century the market for [[popular fiction]] grew, and competed with works of literature. New institutions like the [[circulating library]] created a new market with a mass reading public.&lt;ref&gt;See Richard Altick and Jonathan Rose, ''The English Common Reader: A Social History of the Mass Reading Public, 1800–1900'', 2nd ed. (Ohio State University Press, 1998) and William St. Clair, ''The Reading Nation in the Romantic Period'' (Cambridge: CUP, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another difference was that novels began to deal with more difficult subjects, including current political and social issues, that were being discussed in newspapers and magazines. The idea of social responsibility became a key subject, whether of the citizen, or of the artist, with the theoretical debate concentrating on questions around the moral soundness of the modern novel.&lt;ref&gt;See: James Engell, ''The committed word: Literature and Public Values'' (Penn State Press, 1999) and Edwin M. Eigner, George John Worth (ed.), ''Victorian criticism of the novel'' (Cambridge: CUP Archive, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Questions about artistic integrity, as well as [[aestheticism|aesthetics]], including, for example. the idea of "[[art for art's sake]]", proposed by writers like [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], were also important.&lt;ref&gt;Gene H. Bell-Villada, ''Art for Art's Sake &amp; Literary Life: How Politics and Markets Helped Shape the Ideology &amp; Culture of Aestheticism, 1790–1990'' (University of Nebraska Press, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

Major British writers such as [[Charles Dickens]]&lt;ref&gt;Arthur C. Benson, "Charles Dickens". ''The North American Review'', Vol. 195, No. 676 (Mar., 1912), pp.&amp;nbsp;381–91.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thomas Hardy]]&lt;ref&gt;Jane Millgate, "Two Versions of Regional Romance: Scott's ''The Bride of Lammermoor'' and Hardy's ''Tess of the d'Urbervilles''. ''Studies in English Literature'', 1500–1900, Vol. 17, No. 4, Nineteenth Century (Autumn, 1977), pp.&amp;nbsp;729–38.&lt;/ref&gt; were influenced by the romance genre tradition of the novel, which had been revitalized during the Romantic period. The [[Brontë sisters]] were notable mid-19th-century authors in this tradition, with [[Anne Brontë]]'s ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'', [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' and [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lucasta Miller, ''The Brontë Myth''. London: Vintage, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Publishing at the very end of the 19th century, [[Joseph Conrad]] has been called, "a supreme 'romancer'".&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Literary Terms &amp; Literary Theory'', ed. J.A. Cuddon, 4th ed., revised C.E. Preston (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;761.&lt;/ref&gt; In America "the romance ... proved to be a serious, flexible, and successful medium for the exploration of philosophical ideas and attitudes." Notable examples include [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'', and [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.&lt;ref name="Literary Terms 1995 p.450"&gt;''A Handbook of Literary Terms'', 7th edition, ed. Harmon and Holman (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;450.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of European novelists were similarly influenced influenced during this period by the earlier romance tradition, along with the [[Romantic Movemennticism|Romanticism]], including [[Victor Hugo]], with novels like ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'' (1831) and ''[[Les Misérables]]'' (1862), and [[Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov]] with ''[[A Hero of Our Time]]'' (1840).

[[File:UncleTomsCabinCover.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|[[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852)]]

Many 19th-century authors dealt with significant social matters.&lt;ref&gt;For the wider context of 19th-century encounters with history see: [[Hayden White]], ''[[Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe]]'' (Baltimore: [[Johns Hopkins University]], 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Zola]]'s novels depicted the world of the [[working class]]es, which [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]'s non-fiction explores. In the United States slavery and racism became topics of far broader public debate thanks to [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852), which dramatizes topics that had previously been discussed mainly in the abstract. [[Charles Dickens]]' novels led his readers into contemporary [[workhouses]], and provided first-hand accounts of [[child labor]]. The treatment of the subject of war changed with [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]'' (1868/69), where he questions the facts provided by historians. Similarly the treatment of crime is very different in [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' (1866), where the point of view is that of a criminal. Women authors had dominated fiction from the 1640s into the early 18th century, but few before [[George Eliot]] so openly questioned the role, education, and status of women in society, as she did.

As the novel became a platform of modern debate, [[nationalist|national literatures]] were developed that link the present with the past in the form of the [[historical novel]]. [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|I Promessi Sposi]]'' (1827) did this for Italy, while novelists in Russia and the surrounding Slavonic countries, as well as [[Scandinavia]], did likewise.

Along with this new appreciation of history, the future also became a topic for fiction. This had been done earlier in works like [[Samuel Madden]]'s ''[[Memoirs of the Twentieth Century]]'' (1733) and [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[The Last Man]]'' (1826), a work whose plot culminated in the catastrophic last days of a mankind extinguished by the plague. [[Edward Bellamy]]'s ''[[Looking Backward]]'' (1887) and [[H.G. Wells]]'s ''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895) were concerned with technological and biological developments. [[Industrialization]], [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s [[theory of evolution]] and Marx's theory of [[social class|class]] divisions shaped these works and turned historical processes into a subject of wide debate. Bellamy's ''Looking Backward'' became the second best-selling book of the 19th century after Harriet Beecher Stowe's ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See Scott Donaldson and Ann Massa ''American Literature: Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries'' (David &amp; Charles, 1978), p.&amp;nbsp;205.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claire Parfait, ''The Publishing History of Uncle Tom's Cabin, 1852–2002'' (Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Such works led to the development of a whole genre of popular [[science fiction]] as the 20th century approached.

[[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922) had a major influence on modern novelists, in the way that it replaced the 18th- and 19th-century narrator with a text that attempted to record inner thoughts, or a "[[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]". This term was first used by [[William James]] in 1890 and is used (or the related [[interior monologue]]) by [[modernists]] like [[Dorothy Richardson]], [[Marcel Proust]], as well as, later [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[William Faulkner]].&lt;ref&gt;See Erwin R. Steinberg (ed.) ''The Stream-of-consciousness technique in the modern novel'' (Port Washington, N.Y: Kennikat Press, 1979). On the extra-European usage of the technique see also: Elly Hagenaar/ Eide, Elisabeth, "Stream of consciousness and free indirect discourse in modern Chinese literature", ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'', 56 (1993), p.&amp;nbsp;621 and P.M. Nayak (ed.), ''The voyage inward: stream of consciousness in Indian English fiction'' (New Delhi: Bahri Publications, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the 1920s [[expressionist]] [[Alfred Döblin]] went in a different direction with ''[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]'' (1929), where interspersed non-fictional text fragments exist alongside the fictional material to create another new form of realism, which differs from that of stream-of-consciousness.

Later works like [[Samuel Beckett]]'s trilogy ''[[Molloy (novel)|Molloy]]'' (1951), ''[[Malone Dies]]'' (1951) and ''[[The Unnamable (novel)|The Unnamable]]'' (1953), as well as [[Julio Cortázar]]'s ''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cortázar novel)|Rayuela]]'' (1963) and [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'' (1973) all make use of the stream-of-consciousness technique. On the other hand, [[Robert Coover]] is an example of those authors who, in the 1960s,  fragmented their stories and challenged time and sequentiality as fundamental structural concepts.
[[File:Chinua Achebe - Buffalo 25Sep2008.jpg|right|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Chinua Achebe]], Buffalo, 2008]]
The 20th century novels deals with a wide range of subject matter. [[Erich Maria Remarque]]'s ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' (1928) focusses on young German's experiences of [[World War I]]. The [[Jazz Age]] is explored by American [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], and the [[Great Depression]] by fellow American [[John Steinbeck]]. The rise of [[totalitarian]] states is the subject of British writer [[George Orwell]]. France's existentialism is the subject of French writers [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[Nausea (novel)|Nausea]]'' (1938) and [[Albert Camus]]' ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' (1942). The [[counterculture of the 1960s]] led to revived interest in [[Hermann Hesse]]'s ''[[Steppenwolf (novel)|Steppenwolf]]'' (1927), and produced such iconic works of its own like [[Ken Kesey]]'s ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' and [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]''. Novelist have also been interested in the subject of racial and [[gender identity]] in recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Susan Hopkins, ''Girl Heroes: The New Force In Popular Culture'' (Annandale NSW:, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Jesse Kavadlo of [[Maryville University]] of St. Louis has described [[Chuck Palahniuk]]'s ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'' (1996) as "a closeted [[Feminism|feminist]] critique".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kavadlo|first=Jesse|date=Fall/Winter 2005|title=The Fiction of Self-destruction: Chuck Palahniuk, Closet Moralist|url=|journal=Stirrings Still: The International Journal of Existential Literature|volume=2|issue=2|pages=7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Doris Lessing]], [[Elfriede Jelinek]] were feminist voices during this period.

Furthermore, the major political and military confrontations of the 20th and 21st centuries have also influenced novelists. The events of [[World War II]], from a German perspective, are dealt with by [[Günter Grass]]' ''[[The Tin Drum]]'' (1959) and an American by [[Joseph Heller]]'s ''[[Catch-22]]'' (1961). The subsequent [[Cold War]] influenced popular [[spy fiction|spy novels]]. Latin American self-awareness in the wake of the (failing) left revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s resulted in a "[[Latin American Boom]]", linked to with the names of novelists [[Julio Cortázar]], [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], [[Carlos Fuentes]] and [[Gabriel García Márquez]], along with the invention of a special brand of postmodern [[magic realism]].

Another major 20th-century social events, the so-called [[sexual revolution]] is reflected in the modern novel.&lt;ref&gt;See: Charles Irving Glicksberg, ''The Sexual Revolution in Modern American Literature'' (Nijhoff, 1971) and his ''The Sexual Revolution in Modern English Literature'' (Martinus Nijhoff, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; [[D.H. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' had to be published in Italy in 1928; British censorship lifted its ban as late as 1960. [[Henry Miller]]'s ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'' (1934) created the comparable US scandal. Transgressive fiction from [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Lolita]]'' (1955) to [[Michel Houellebecq]]'s ''[[Les Particules élémentaires]]'' (1998) entered a literary field that eventually led to more pornographic works such as [[Anne Desclos]]' ''[[Story of O]]'' (1954) to [[Anaïs Nin]]'s ''[[Delta of Venus]]'' (1978).

In the second half of the 20th century, [[postmodernism|Postmodern]] authors subverted serious debate with playfulness, claiming that art could never be original, that it always plays with existing materials.&lt;ref&gt;See for a first survey [[Brian McHale]], ''Postmodernist Fiction'' (Routledge, 1987) and John Docker, ''Postmodernism and popular culture: a cultural history'' (Cambridge University Press, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that language is self-referential was already an  accepted truth in the world of [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]]. A postmodernist re-reads popular literature as an essential cultural production. Novels from [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s ''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]'' (1966), to [[Umberto Eco]]'s ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' (1980) and ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]'' (1989) made use of [[intertextuality|intertextual]] references.&lt;ref&gt;See Gérard Genette, ''Palimpsests'', trans.

While the reader of so-called [[Classic book|serious literature]] will follow public discussions of novels, popular fiction production employs more direct and short-term marketing strategies by openly declarating of the work's genre. Popular novels are based entirely on the expectations for the particular genre, and this includes the creation of a series of novels with an identifiable brand name. e.g. the [[Sherlock Holmes]] series by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]

Popular literature holds a larger market share. [[Romance fiction]] had an estimated $1.375&amp;nbsp;billion share in the US book market in 2007. [[Inspirational literature]]/religious literature followed with $819&amp;nbsp;million, [[science fiction]]/[[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] with $700&amp;nbsp;million, [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] with $650&amp;nbsp;million and then classic literary fiction with $466&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;See the page [http://www.rwanational.org/cs/the_romance_genre/romance_literature_statistics Romance Literature Statistics: Overview]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223085813/http://www.rwanational.org/cs/the_romance_genre/romance_literature_statistics |date=2007-12-23 }} (visited March 16, 2009) of ''[http://www.rwanational.org/cs/home Romance Writers of America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203140439/http://www.rwanational.org/cs/home |date=2010-12-03 }}'' homepage.

Genre literature might be seen as the successor of the early modern [[chapbook]]. Both fields share a focus on readers who are in search of accessible reading satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Richetti ''Popular Fiction before Richardson. Narrative Patterns 1700–1739'' (Oxford: OUP, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt; The 20th-century love romance is a successor of the novels [[Madeleine de Scudéry]], [[Madame de La Fayette|Marie de La Fayette]], [[Aphra Behn]], and [[Eliza Haywood]] wrote from the 1640s into the 1740s. The modern [[adventure novel]] goes back to [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1719) and its immediate successors. Modern [[pornography]] has no precedent in the chapbook market but originates in libertine and hedonistic belles lettres, of works like [[John Cleland]]'s ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' (1749) and similar eighteenth century novels. [[Ian Fleming]]'s ''[[James Bond]]'' is a descendant of the anonymous yet extremely sophisticated and stylish narrator who mixed his love affairs with his political missions in ''La Guerre d'Espagne'' (1707). [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'' is influenced by [[Tolkien]], as well as [[Arthurian literature]], including its 19th-century successors. Modern [[horror fiction]] also has no precedent on the market of chapbooks but goes back to the elitist market of early-19th-century [[Romantic literature]]. Modern popular science fiction has an even shorter history, from the 1860s.

The authors of popular fiction tend to advertise that they have exploited a controversial topic and this is a major difference between them and so-called elitist literature. [[Dan Brown]], for example, discusses, on his website, the question whether his ''Da Vinci Code'' is an anti-Christian novel.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Brown on his [http://www.danbrown.com/novels/davinci_code/faqs.html website] visited February 3, 2009. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116181432/http://www.danbrown.com/novels/davinci_code/faqs.html |date=January 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And because authors of popular fiction have a fan community to serve, they can risk offending [[literary critic]]. However, the boundaries between popular and serious literature have blurred in recent years, with [[postmodernism]] and [[poststructuralism]], as well as by adaptation of popular literary classics by the film and television industries.
[[File:J. K. Rowling 2010.jpg|right|upright=0.9|thumb|[[J.K. Rowling]], 2010]]
Crime became a major subject of 20th and 21st century genre novelists and [[crime fiction]] reflects the realities of modern industrialized societies. Crime is both a personal and public subject: criminals each have their personal motivations; detectives, see their moral codes challenged. [[Patricia Highsmith]]'s [[psychological thriller|thrillers]] became a medium of new psychological explorations. [[Paul Auster]]'s ''[[The New York Trilogy|New York Trilogy]]'' (1985–1986) is an example of experimental [[postmodern]]ist literature based on this genre.

[[Fantasy]] is another major area of commercial fiction, and a major example is [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1954/55), a work originally written for young readers that became a major cultural artefact. Tolkien in fact  revived the tradition of European [[epic (genre)|epic]] literature in the tradition of [[Beowulf]], the North Germanic [[Edda]] and the [[King Arthur|Arthurian Cycles]].

[[Science fiction]], is another important type of genre fiction and it has developed in a variety of ways, ranging from the early, technological adventure [[Jules Verne]] had made fashionable in the 1860s, to [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) about Western [[consumerism]] and technology. [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949) deals with [[totalitarianism]] and [[surveillance]], among other matters, while [[Stanisław Lem]], [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] produced modern classics which focus on the interaction between humans and machines. The surreal novels of [[Philip K Dick]] such as ''[[The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch]]'' explore the nature of reality, reflecting the widespread recreational experimentation with drugs and cold-war paranoia of the 60's and 70's. Writers such as [[Ursula le Guin]] and [[Margaret Atwood]] explore feminist and broader social issues in their works. [[William Gibson]], author of the cult classic ''[[Neuromancer]]'' (1984), is one of a new wave of authors who explore post-apocalyptic fantasies and [[virtual reality]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3934">'''Nutrition analysis''' refers to the process of determining the [[nutrition]]al content of [[food]]s and food products.  The process can be performed through a variety of certified methods.

==Methods==
===Laboratory analysis===
Traditionally, food companies would send food samples to laboratories for physical testing. 
Typical analysis includes:
Moisture (water) by loss of mass at 102 °C,
Protein by analysis of total nitrogen, either by Dumas or Kjeldahl methods,
Total fat, traditionally by a solvent extraction, but often now by secondary methods such as NMR,
[[Crude ash]] (total inorganic matter) by combustion at 550C,
Estimated dietary fibre by various AOAC methods such as 985.29,
Sodium (and thereby Salt) either by flame photometry, AA or ICP-OES,
Total sugars, normally by a liquid chromatography technique, such as IC-HPAED or HPLC-RI,
Fatty acids by GC-FID,
Carbohydrates and energy values are normally calculated from these analytical values.

===Software===
Software is available as an alternative to laboratory nutrition analysis.  This software typically utilizes a database of ingredients that have previously been laboratory tested.  The user can input ingredient data by matching their ingredients to ingredients found in the database; the analysis can then be calculated.

===Online nutrition analysis===
In recent years, web-based nutrition analysis software services have become more popular. Online nutrition analysis allows users to access online databases and draw from certified ingredients to produce instant nutrition information.

===Turnkey nutrition analysis services===
Another emerging trend is the use of nutritional analysis services that do a complete analysis of any recipe by using their proprietary database.  Users provide recipes, cooking methods and serving sizes.  In turn, the service provides a complete nutritional analysis.

==Applications==
In the United States, nutrition information is required on packaged retail foods in the form of nutrition facts panels as a result of [[food labeling regulations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Food/LabelingNutrition/default.htm Food Labeling and Nutrition Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, many restaurants have begun posting nutrition information as a result of both customer demand and menu-labeling laws.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/business/mcdonalds-to-start-posting-calorie-counts.html New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrition facts label===
{{main|Nutrition facts label}}

===Menu-labeling===
The [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], signed into law March 23, 2010, includes a provision that creates a national, uniform nutrition-disclosure standard for food service establishments.

The nutrition-disclosure provision requires chain restaurants, similar retail food establishments and vending machines with 20 or more locations to provide specific nutrition labeling information. Those establishments must post calories on menus, menu boards and drive-thru boards. Buffets, salad bars and other self-service items are also included and will be required to provide caloric information adjacent to the item.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nacsonline.com/NACS/Government/NutritionPolicy/Pages/MenuLabeling.aspx Issue Update:Menu Labeling ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently many state and local menu-labeling laws have been passed requiring restaurants to post nutrition information on menus and menu boards, or have it readily available upon customer request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cspinet.org/menulabeling/ Center for Science in the Public Interest]&lt;/ref&gt; Restaurants have had to perform nutrition analysis in order to generate nutrition information and conform to these laws. More recently national legislation has been introduced that would set a national standard for menu labeling, the most popular of which is the [[LEAN act]].

'''Optical lens design''' is the process of designing a [[lens (optics)|lens]] to meet a set of performance requirements and constraints, including cost and manufacturing limitations. Parameters include surface profile types ([[spherical]], [[asphere|aspheric]], [[holographic]], [[diffraction|diffractive]], etc.), as well as [[Radius of curvature (optics)|radius of curvature]], distance to the next surface, material type and optionally tilt and decenter. The process is computationally intensive, using [[Ray tracing (physics)|ray tracing]] or other techniques to model how the lens affects light that passes through it.

==Design requirements==
Performance requirements can include:

#[[optics|Optical]] performance (image quality): This is quantified by various metrics, including [[encircled energy]], [[modulation transfer function]], [[Strehl ratio]], ghost reflection control, and pupil performance (size, location and aberration control); the choice of the image quality metric is application specific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Optical System Design |edition=2nd |first1=Robert E. |last1=Fischer |first2=Biljana |last2=Tadic-Galeb |first3=Paul R. |last3=Yoder |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2008 |pages=8, 179–198 |isbn=0-07-147248-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edmundoptics.com/technical-resources-center/optics/modulation-transfer-function/ |title=Modulation Transfer Function}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}
#Physical requirements such as [[weight]], static [[volume]], dynamic volume, [[center of gravity]] and overall configuration requirements.
#Environmental requirements: ranges for [[temperature]], [[pressure]], [[oscillation|vibration]] and [[electromagnetic shielding]].

Design constraints can include realistic lens element center and edge thicknesses, minimum and maximum air-spaces between lenses, maximum constraints on entrance and exit angles, physically realizable glass [[index of refraction]] and [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] properties.

Manufacturing costs and delivery schedules are also a major part of optical design. The price of an optical glass blank of given dimensions can vary by a factor of fifty or more, depending on the size, glass type, index [[Refractive index|homogeneity]] quality, and availability, with [[BK7]] usually being the cheapest.  Costs for larger and/or thicker optical blanks of a given material, above 100–150&amp;nbsp;mm, usually increase faster than the physical volume due to increased blank [[Annealing (glass)|annealing]] time required to achieve acceptable index homogeneity and internal [[Birefringence|stress birefringence]] levels throughout the blank volume.  Availability of glass blanks is driven by how frequently a particular glass type is made by a given manufacturer, and can seriously affect manufacturing cost and schedule.

==Process==

Lenses can first be designed using [[Paraxial approximation|paraxial theory]] to position [[image]]s and [[Entrance pupil|pupils]], then real surfaces inserted and optimized.  Paraxial theory can be skipped in simpler cases and the lens directly optimized using real surfaces. Lenses are first designed using average [[index of refraction]] and [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] (see [[Abbe number]]) properties published in the glass manufacturer's catalog and though [[glass model]] calculations. However, the properties of the real glass blanks will vary from this ideal; index of refraction values can vary by as much as 0.0003 or more from catalog values, and dispersion can vary slightly. These changes in index and dispersion can sometimes be enough to affect the lens focus location and imaging performance in highly corrected systems.

The lens blank manufacturing process is as follows:

#The [[glass batch]] ingredients for a desired glass type are mixed in a powder state,
#the powder mixture is melted together in a furnace,
#the fluid is further mixed while molten to maximize batch homogeneity,
#poured into lens blanks and
#[[Annealing (glass)|annealed]] according to empirically determined time-temperature schedules.

The glass blank pedigree, or "melt data", can be determined for a given glass batch by making small precision [[Prism (optics)|prisms]] from various locations in the batch and measuring their index of refraction on a [[spectrometer]], typically at five or more [[wavelengths]].  Lens design programs have [[curve fitting]] routines that can fit the melt data to a selected [[Sellmeier equation|dispersion curve]], from which the index of refraction at any wavelength within the fitted wavelength range can be calculated.  A re-optimization, or "melt re-comp", can then be performed on the lens design using measured index of refraction data where available.  When manufactured, the resulting lens performance will more closely match the desired requirements than if average glass catalog values for index of refraction were assumed.

Delivery schedules are impacted by glass and mirror blank availability and lead times to acquire, the amount of tooling a shop must fabricate prior to starting on a project, the manufacturing tolerances on the parts (tighter tolerances mean longer fab times), the complexity of any [[optical coatings]] that must be applied to the finished parts, further complexities in mounting or bonding lens elements into cells and in the overall lens system assembly, and any post-assembly alignment and quality control testing and tooling required.  Tooling costs and delivery schedules can be reduced by using existing tooling at any given shop wherever possible, and by maximizing manufacturing tolerances to the extent possible.

==Lens optimization==
A simple two-element air-spaced lens has nine variables (four radii of curvature, two thicknesses, one airspace thickness, and two glass types).  A multi-configuration lens corrected over a wide spectral band and field of view over a range of [[focal length]]s and over a realistic temperature range can have a complex design volume having over one hundred dimensions.

Lens optimization techniques that can navigate this multi-dimensional space and proceed to local [[Maxima and minima|minima]] have been studied since the 1940s, beginning with early work by [[James G. Baker]], and later by Feder,&lt;ref&gt;D.P. Feder, "Automatic Optical Design," Appl. Opt. 2, 1209–1226 (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; Wynne,&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Wynne and P. Wormell, "Lens Design by Computer," Appl. Opt. 2:1223–1238 (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; Glatzel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zeisshistorica.org/Glatzel.html |title=Dr. Erhardt Glatzel (Biography) |accessdate=July 21, 2013 |publisher=The Zeiss Historica Society |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127182506/http://www.zeisshistorica.org/Glatzel.html |archivedate=January 27, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grey&lt;ref&gt;Grey, D.S., "The Inclusion of Tolerance Sensitivities in the Merit Function for Lens Optimization", SPIE Vol. 147, pp. 63–65, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; and others.  Prior to the development of [[digital computer]]s, lens optimization was a hand-calculation task using [[trigonometric]] and [[logarithm]]ic tables to plot 2-D cuts through the multi-dimensional space. Computerized ray tracing allows the performance of a lens to be modelled quickly, so that the design space can be searched rapidly. This allows design concepts to be rapidly refined. In most cases the designer must first choose a viable design for the optical system, and then numerical modelling is used to refine it.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer (2008), pp. 171–5.&lt;/ref&gt; The designer ensures that designs optimized by the computer meet all requirements, and makes adjustments or restarts the process when they do not.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9311">'''Pay as you throw''' (PAYT) (also called trash metering, unit pricing, variable rate pricing, or user-pay) is a usage-pricing model for disposing of [[municipal solid waste]]. Users are charged a rate based on how much waste they present for collection to the municipality or local authority.

A variety of models exist depending on the region and municipality. Waste is measured by weight or size while units are identified using different types of bags, tags, containers or even [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]]. Services for waste diversion, like [[recycling]] and [[composting]], are often provided free of charge where pay-as-you-throw systems are implemented.&lt;ref name="Batllevell"&gt;Batllevell, Marta and Kenneth Hanf. “The fairness of PAYT systems: Some guidelines for decision-makers.” Waste Management 28 (2008): 2793-2800.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three main types of pay-as-you-throw programmes:
- Full-unit pricing: users pay for all the garbage they want collected in advance by purchasing a tag, custom bag, or selected size container.
- Partial-unit pricing: the local authority or municipality decides on a maximum number of bags or containers of garbage, with collection paid for by taxes. Additional bags or containers are available for purchase should the user exceed the permitted amount
- Variable-rate pricing: users can choose to rent a container of varying sizes (some programs offer up to five), with the price corresponding to the amount of waste generated.&lt;ref name="Kelleher"&gt;Kelleher, Maria, et al. “Taking out the Trash: How to Allocate the Costs Fairly.” C.D. Howe Institute Commentary 213 (2005): 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
The two most traditional approaches to disposing of municipal solid waste are a flat-rate system or municipal taxes. All users pay the same municipal taxes regardless of how much waste they present for pickup.&lt;ref name="Bilitewski"&gt;Bilitewski, Bernd. “Pay-as-you-throw – A tool for urban waste management.” Editorial. Waste Management 28 (2008): 2759.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the flat-rate system there is no incentive to reduce waste produced.&lt;ref name="Reichenbach"&gt;Reichenbach, Jan. “Status and prospects of pay-as-you-throw in Europe – A review of pilot research and implementation studies.” Waste Management 28 (2008): 2809-2814.&lt;/ref&gt;

PAYT is based on two guiding principles of environmental policy: the [[polluter pays principle]] and the [[shared responsibility]] concept.&lt;ref name="Batllevell" /&gt; The rationale for PAYT can be divided into three broad categories:

===Economic===
Under a PAYT scheme, some or all of the costs of waste management can be removed from property tax bills, providing more independence in the management and financial of residential waste system.&lt;ref name="Kelleher" /&gt;  Waste management services are then treated just like other utilities such as electricity or water that are charged by unit of consumption.&lt;ref name="Bilitewski" /&gt;

===Environmental===
PAYT program are an effective tool in increasing waste separation and recycling, and also encourage waste minimization. The result is significant energy savings from transportation, increases in material recovery from recycling, and reduction in pollution from landfills and incinerators. And thus reduce the load of landfills.&lt;ref name="Bilitewski" /&gt; PAYT programs also indirectly encourage producers to develop more efficient designs and environmentally friendly product life cycles.&lt;ref name="Kelleher" /&gt;

===Social===
Waste collections costs are distributed more fairly among the population, and in proportion to the amount of waste each user generates.&lt;ref name="Kelleher" /&gt; Free riders are no longer able to have their behavior subsidized, and PAYT is said to promote community sustainability.  Lower-income families tend to produce less waste and thus pay lower waste collection fees.&lt;ref name="Batllevell" /&gt;

==Diversion effects and risks==
Charging for waste can also sometimes result in illegal dumping ([[fly-tipping]]) or the waste being passed to unlicensed or illegal disposal methods.&lt;ref name="Batllevell" /&gt;  In practice, increased litter, open burning, and illegal dumping have not been observed by most pay-as-you-throw communities, especially when combined with easier recycling and composting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scdhec.gov/library/OR-0608.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="massdep"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/massdep/recycle/reduce/pay-as-you-throw-basics-for-municipalities.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Municipalities in Massachusetts have typically observed a reduction in trash larger than the increase in recycling, but this is believed to be due to people formerly bringing in trash from other communities (where presumably there is no free pickup) to the homes of friends and relatives.&lt;ref&gt;http://radioboston.wbur.org/2011/04/12/mass-recycling-program&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political opposition==
When there is a change to any established municipal service, public resistance is common.&lt;ref name="Kelleher"/&gt;  The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection recommends making PAYT programs revenue-neutral by reducing taxes at the same time as introducing trash fees, so residents don't see the trash fee as a new cost.&lt;ref name="massdep"/&gt;

==Implementation==
Urban communities usually offer curbside collection while rural communities provide drop-off collection service.&lt;ref name="Kelleher" /&gt; Both the European Union and the US Environmental Protection Agency have published handbooks for introducing PAYT.&lt;ref name="Sakai"&gt;Sakai, S., et al. “Unit-charging programs for municipal solid waste in Japan.”  Waste Management 28 (2008): 2815-2825.&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
PAYT programs operated in California, Michigan, New York and Washington as early as the 1970s, although The City of San Francisco “had practiced a kind of PAYT scheme since 1932.” &lt;ref name ="Reichenbach" /&gt; By 2000, 6,000 communities in the U.S. (20%) and 200 in Canada had implemented user fees for waste management.&lt;ref name="Kelleher" /&gt;  In 2002 North Americans disposed of 24 million tonnes of waste, with residential sources accounting for 9.5 million tonnes.&lt;ref name="Kelleher" /&gt; PAYT programs resulted in residential waste declining from 9 - 38% and increased recycling from 6 – 40%.&lt;ref name="Kelleher" /&gt;

===Europe===
{{See also|Waste management in Switzerland}}

Austria was the first country to implement individual waste charging in 1945, but PAYT did not catch on until the 1980s when efficient and secure electronic identification systems became available.&lt;ref name="Reichenbach"/&gt; The first city in Europe to implement an electronic identification and billing system for waste charges was Dresden, Germany.&lt;ref name= "Bilitewski"/&gt; The first experience in Spain was in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Puig Ventosa, I. "Charging systems and PAYT experiences for waste management in Spain". Waste Management 2008, 28, 2767–2771&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1991, the European Waste Policy has required that “part of the costs not covered by revenues from material reuse must be recovered on the polluter-pays principle.” Versions of PAYT are present in municipalities all over Europe.&lt;ref name="Reichenbach"/&gt;

===Asia===
After being introduced in the 1970s, 954 municipalities (30%) in Japan have implemented PAYT programs.&lt;ref name="Sakai" /&gt; The city of [[Taipei]] currently runs a scheme where households and companies purchase specially printed blue bin bags, and place waste in it. The municipal waste management department collects only rubbish placed within these special bags. Called the "Per Bag Trash Collection Fee", this scheme encourages usage of recyclable packaging, as those do not need a special bag and are disposed free of charge.

Apartments serviced through this pricing mechanism showed a significant reduction in their garbage footprint.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3357">The '''Plebs' League''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] educational and political organisation which originated around a [[Marxist]] way of thinking in 1908 and was active until 1926.

Central to the formation of the League was [[Noah Ablett]], a [[miner]] from the [[Rhondda]] who was at the core of a group at [[Ruskin College, Oxford]] who challenged the lecturers' opposition to Marxism.  In the 1907–8 academic year, Ablett began leading unofficial classes in Marxist [[political economy]] which were attended by [[Ebby Edwards]], among others.  Ablett returned to South Wales in 1908, where he began promoting Marxist education through local branches of the [[Independent Labour Party]].&lt;ref name="pitt"&gt;[http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/History/Nextstep.html Syndicalism in South Wales], Bob Pitt&lt;/ref&gt;

A mixture of students and former students at Ruskin founded the Plebs' League in November 1908, also launching the ''Plebs' Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;''Proletcult'', Eden Paul (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the first issue of the ''Plebs'', dated February 1909, Ablett contributed an article on the need for independent [[working class education]].&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical Dictionary of European Labor Leaders'', A. T. Lane (1995), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  The League ran classes teaching Marxist principles and later [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] ideas.&lt;ref name="welsh"&gt;''The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales''. [[John Davies (historian)|John Davies]], [[Nigel Jenkins]], Menna Baines and Peredur Lynch (2008), p. 687 {{ISBN|978-0-7083-1953-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1909, student agitation for Marxism continued at Ruskin.  The students were supported by the Principal, [[Dennis Hird]], and when he was dismissed the students went on strike, refusing to attend classes.  The rebels formed the [[Central Labour College]], which worked closely with the Plebs' League.&lt;ref name="welsh" /&gt;

By 1910, the Plebs' League was active in South Wales, Lancashire and Scotland.  Activists included [[A. J. Cook (trade unionist)|A. J. Cook]], [[William Mainwaring]], [[Mark Starr (labor educationalist)|Mark Starr]] and [[John Maclean (Scottish socialist)|John Maclean]].&lt;ref name="pitt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/hallas/works/1986/12/ruskin.htm The Ruskin Debate: Their college or ours?], ''Socialist Worker Review 93'', [[Duncan Hallas]] (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

The League had sympathies with [[De Leonism]], primarily represented in Britain by the [[Socialist Labour Party (UK, 1903)|Socialist Labour Party]].  It later had a relationship with the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="barberis"&gt;''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations'', Peter Barberis, John McHugh and Mike Tyldesley (2000), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

The League was absorbed by the [[National Council of Labour Colleges]] the year after the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike]], although the ''Plebs' Magazine'' continued to appear for many years.&lt;ref name="barberis" /&gt;

He then won a scholarship to [[Cambridge University]], where in 1965 he earned a second PhD in Nepali sculpture and painting. However he failed to get a teaching job in India, and moved to the US instead.&lt;ref name="LAT Profile"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Muchnic|first1=Suzanne|authorlink1=Suzanne Muchnic|title=ART : Laboring Under No Illusions|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-11-20/entertainment/ca-65009_1_southeast-asian-art/|accessdate=2 May 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=20 November 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1967 Pal was appointed the curator of the Indian art collection at [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Boston Museum]], a position that had previously been held by [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]]. In 1969, he moved to the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], which was then beginning to develop its own collection of Indian art. Pal joined as the head of department of Indian and Islamic art, and subsequently served as the museum's acting director (1979–80) and as the senior curator of Indian and Southeast Asian art from 1981. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' art writer [[Suzanne Muchnic]] described his legacy as building the museum's collection from "a handful of items to about 4,000 pieces, giving LACMA one of the nation's preeminent holdings of Indian and Southeast Asian art."&lt;ref name="LAT Profile" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DIA&gt;{{cite web|title=Distinguished Indian Art Scholar Pratapaditya Pal to speak at Detroit Institute of Arts|url=http://www.dia.org/news/1656/Distinguished-Indian-Art-Scholar-Pratapaditya-Pal-to-speak-at-Detroit-Institute-of-Arts---Essence-of-Indian-art-and-its-relation-to-Hinduism,-Buddhism-and-Jainism-topic-of-talk.aspx|website=dia.org|publisher=[[Detroit Institute of Arts]]|accessdate=2 May 2015|date=29 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505075255/http://www.dia.org/news/1656/Distinguished-Indian-Art-Scholar-Pratapaditya-Pal-to-speak-at-Detroit-Institute-of-Arts---Essence-of-Indian-art-and-its-relation-to-Hinduism,-Buddhism-and-Jainism-topic-of-talk.aspx|archivedate=5 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pro Tools''' is a [[digital audio workstation]] developed and released by [[Avid Technology]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[OS X|macOS]] which can be used for a wide range of [[sound recording]] and sound production purposes. Pro Tools can run as standalone [[software]], or operate using a range of external [[analog/digital converter]]s and internal [[PCI Local Bus]] (PCI) or [[PCIe]] [[audio card]]s with onboard [[digital signal processor]]s (DSP) to provide [[effects unit|effects]] such as [[reverb]], [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] and [[compression (audio)|compression]]. Like all digital audio workstation software, Pro Tools can perform the functions of a [[multitrack tape recorder]] and [[audio mixer]], along with additional features that can only be performed in the digital domain, such as non-destructive editing, using the Undo feature.

Most of Pro Tools' basic functions can be controlled within Edit or Mix windows, which the user can see on a [[Flat-panel display|computer screen]]. The Edit window displays audio and [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface]] (MIDI) tracks, and provides graphical representation of the information recorded or imported. Here, audio can be edited in a [[Non-linear editing system|non-linear]], [[non-destructive editing|non-destructive]] fashion. Pro Tools supports 16-bit, 24-bit, and [[32-bit]] [[float (computing)|float]] audio [[Audio bit depth|bit depths]] at [[sample rate]]s up to 192&amp;nbsp;kHz. Pro Tools can handle [[WAV]], [[AIFF]], AIFC, [[mp3]], and formerly SDII audio files. Pro Tools has also most recently incorporated video editing capabilities, so users can import and manipulate high definition video file formats such as XDCAM, MJPG-A, PhotoJPG, DV25, [[QuickTime]], and more. It features [[time code]], tempo maps, elastic audio, [[Console automation|automation]] and [[surround sound]] abilities. The Pro Tools [[Time-division multiplexing|TDM]] mix engine (supported until 2011) employed [[24-bit]] [[fixed-point arithmetic]] for plug-in processing and [[48-bit]] for mixing; current HDX hardware systems, HD Native and native systems use [[32-bit]] [[Floating-point arithmetic|floating point]] resolution for plug-ins and [[64-bit]] floating point summing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/avid-hdx#para3|title=Avid HDX {{!}}|website=www.soundonsound.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
Pro Tools was developed by [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] graduates Evan Brooks, who majored in [[electrical engineering]] and [[computer science]], and Peter Gotcher. The first incarnation of Pro Tools was introduced in 1984 under the brand name Sound Designer. At the time, the pair were creating and selling [[electronic drums|digital drum]] sound chips under their Digidrums label. Sound Designer was originally designed to edit sounds for the [[E-mu Emulator]] sampling keyboard, but it was rapidly ported to many other sampling keyboards, such as the [[Akai]] S900 and the [[Sequential Circuits Prophet 2000|Prophet 2000]]. Thanks to the universal file specification developed by Brooks, Sound Designer files could be transferred to and from one sampling keyboard to another keyboard made by a different manufacturer. 

This universal file specification, along with the printed source code to a 68000 assembly language interrupt driven [[MIDI]] driver, were distributed through [[Macintosh]] MIDI interface manufacturer Assimilation, which manufactured the first MIDI interface for the Mac in 1985. Macintosh Editor/librarian software development pioneers and visionaries, Beaverton Digital Systems, provided a dial-up service called MacMusic starting in 1985 which used 2400-[[baud]] modems and 100 MB of disk, and used [[Red Ryder (software)|Red Ryder Host]] on a 1 MB [[Macintosh Plus]], allowing users of Sound Designer to download and install the entire Emulator II sound library to other less expensive samplers. MacMusic allowed users worldwide to share sample libraries across different manufacturers platforms without copyright infringement. Beaverton Digital Systems President John Connolly already had several conversations with Evan Brooks in 1985, as he was listed as a contact for technical support for the Assimilation MIDI toolkit, and the current Apple operating system in 1985 did not have native MIDI communications drivers. One evening in 1986 at John Connolly's [[Beaverton, Oregon]] home, an alert was sent online from MacMusic requesting the system operator, and to Connolly's surprise it was Peter Gotcher, thanking him for providing such a revolutionary service and making Sound Designer a much more attractive program to buy, by leveraging both the universal file format and by developing the first online sample file download site in the world, many years before the [[World Wide Web]] use soared.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.emulatorarchive.com/SampleDesign/SDSoundDesigner/sdsounddesigner.html Sound Designer Page at the Emulator Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Gotcher and Brooks discussed with [[E-mu Systems]] the possibility of integrating their renamed 'Sound Tools' software into the Emulator III. E-mu rejected this offer and the pair started Digidesign, with Gotcher as president and Brooks as lead engineer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eqmag.com/article/the-software-chronicles/Mar-06/19100 Evan Brooks, Digidesign] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004165207/http://www.eqmag.com/article/the-software-chronicles/Mar-06/19100 |date=2008-10-04 }}, EQ Magazine, Mar 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Sound Tools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.me.com/protoolsman1/deprotoolsman/Geschiedenis_files/soundtools.jpg|title=iCloud|publisher=|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; debuted on January 20, 1989 at [[NAMM]] (National Association of Music Merchandisers). At this stage Sound Tools was a simple computer-based stereo audio editor. Although the software had the possibility to do far more, it was limited by the hard drive technology, which was used to stream audio and allow for the [[non-destructive editing]] that Sound Tools offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.namm.org/library/oral-history/evan-brooks|title=Library - NAMM.org|work=NAMM.org|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first version of Pro Tools was launched in 1991, offering four tracks and selling for $6,000 USD. The core engine technology and much of the user interface was designed by and licensed from a small San Francisco company called OSC, known at the time for creating the first software-based digital multi-track recorder, called DECK, in 1990.&lt;ref name="wired212"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.12/osc.html|title=Wired 2.12: Consume the Minimum, Produce the Maximum|publisher=|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That software, manufactured by OSC but distributed by Digidesign, formed the platform upon which Pro Tools version 1 was built. The OSC designers and engineers responsible for that technology, Josh Rosen, Mats Myrberg and John Dalton, split from Digidesign in 1993 in order to focus on releasing lower-cost ($399)&lt;ref name="wired212"/&gt; multi-track software that would run on computers with no additional hardware.  The software was known circa mid-1990s as Session (for stereo-only audio cards) and Session 8 (for multi-channel audio interfaces). Although the original design remained largely the same, Digidesign continued to improve Pro Tools software and hardware, adding a visual [[MIDI sequencer]] and more tracks, with the system offering 16-bit, 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz audio recording. In 1997, Pro Tools reached 24-bit, 48 tracks. It was at this point that the migration from more conventional analog studio technology to the Pro Tools platform took place within the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inG-VGagm_U|title=YouTube|publisher=|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ricky Martin]]'s "[[Livin' la Vida Loca]]" (1999) was the first No. 1 single to be recorded, edited, and mixed fully within the Pro Tools environment, by [[Charles Dye]] and [[Desmond Child]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_recordin_la_vida/ |title=Recordin' "La Vida Loca |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604161013/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_recordin_la_vida/ |archive-date=2011-06-04 |work=Mix Magazine, Nov 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Pro Tools was used for creating the audio for the video games ''[[DJ Hero]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero]]'', using the modeling plug-in Eleven for the guitar sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://akwww2.digidesign.com/digizine/flashviewer/2009/winter/DZ_Win_Spr09.pdf |title=Unsung Guitar Heroes |format=PDF |work=Digizine Winter/Spring 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interface==
[[Image:protools9screen.png|thumb|Pro Tools 9 running on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]]]
Most of Pro Tools' basic functions can be controlled within Edit or Mix windows. The Edit window displays audio and [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface]] (MIDI) tracks, and provides graphical representation of the information recorded or imported. Here, audio can be edited in a [[Non-linear editing system|non-linear]], [[non-destructive editing|non-destructive]] fashion. MIDI information can also be manipulated. The Mix window displays each track's fader channel and allows for the adjustment of a channel's volume and pan, as well as being the usual place to insert plug-in effects and route audio to and from different outputs and inputs. The release of Pro Tools 8 introduced a MIDI edit window, which enables the user to manipulate MIDI data in either piano-roll or score windows. It also includes MIDI edit lanes so that the user can see note, velocity and other CC data in the same window. These additions took Pro Tools from the long standard 2 edit window approach to having 3 edit windows. Real-time effects processing and virtual instruments in Pro Tools are achieved through the use of plug-ins, which are either processed by the [[digital signal processing|DSP]] chips as DSP plug-ins, or the host computer as Native plug-ins. Additionally, out-of-time processing is available in the form of AudioSuite plug-ins, which also enables time-domain processing.

==Systems==
{{advert|section|date=May 2012}}
{{expert-subject|Pro Tools|section|date=February 2013}}

===HDX systems===
In October 2011 Avid introduced a new line of DSP accelerated cards, named HDX cards, along with version 10 of its Pro Tools software. The cards included DSP processors manufactured by Texas Instruments, operating with increased computational precision – 32-bit floating point versus the previous 24-bit fixed (in the older generation 56k chips made by Motorola). Benefits claimed for the new system included improved technical performance in terms of audio dynamic range, monitoring latency, and overall computational power, when compared to the older HD line. In its marketing Avid aimed the HDX system at customers requiring the highest and most consistent practically achievable levels of technical performance. The practical benefit to the user was the more reliable creation of large and complex productions typical of those demanded in modern music production. A key stated benefit was near-zero monitoring latency.

The "HD" product line was reorganised to include "HD|Native" (without DSP) and HDX. The HD|Native systems made use of the host system's CPU for all audio processing while retaining the augmented workflows and sound quality factors of Pro Tools HD. HDX's primary advantage over HD remained the considerably lower latency for all DSP reliant operations. As a result, in order to maintain the required consistency of performance, HDX products were specified with a fixed maximum number of "voices" (audio tracks). Up to three HDX cards could be installed on a single system, for a maximum of 768 total "voices" (audio channels).

While by comparison, native systems from all manufacturers including Avid may offer an apparently unlimited number of tracks / voices, every system necessarily has practical limits to what can usefully be achieved, depending on technical specification of the host computer, software configuration and user preferences. HDX systems accelerated digital signal processing for Avid's own AAX format plugins only. The company ended support for the older TDM technology for use with its HDX products. (TDM stood for [[Time-division multiplexing|Time Division Multiplexing]]; though it was sometimes known as Time Domain Multiplexing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pro Tools DigiRack Plug-Ins Guide: Version 5.0.1 for Macintosh and Windows|publisher=Digidesign, Inc.|accessdate=23 October 2013|url=http://akarchive.digidesign.com/support/docs/50/DigiRack_Plug-Ins_Guide501.pdf|page=18|format=PDF|year=2000|quote="time domain plug-ins"}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Avid advised users that Pro Tools 10 would be the final release for Pro Tools|HD Process and Accel systems, and that its TDM technology would be discontinued.

===HD systems===
Pro Tools HD and HDX systems represent the company's professional product line. They rely on dedicated chips that aid audio processing, in conjunction with rack-mounted interfaces, which handle outgoing and incoming audio, MIDI, and sync connections. With the introduction of Avid's HDX line, HD ("native") interfaces no longer feature [[digital signal processing|DSP]], and this feature has been reserved for HDX only. HD and HDX systems utilise proprietary cables to interconnect with external units. Older Pro Tools HD cards featured DSP chips from the Motorola 56k family. Newer HDX interfaces rely on DSP chips from Texas Instruments and have split facilities for managing track playback and signal processing operations. At launch Pro Tools HD cards were called HD Process cards. Approximately 2 years later, the HD Process cards were replaced by the HD Accel card, which was designed around a faster variant of the Motorola DSP chip and provided approximately twice the signal processing power per card. When Apple changed the expansion slot architecture of the G5 to PCI Express, Digidesign launched a line of PCIe HD Accel cards that both adopted the new card slot format and also slightly changed the combination of chips. There are TDM plug-ins that require the presence of Accel chips to run and therefore cannot run on the earlier non-Accel HD systems.

On October 6, 2010, Avid released Pro Tools HD Native, a lower cost PCIe card system designed for host-processing with fully functional HD software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avid.com/US/products/Pro-Tools-HD-native?intcmp=AV-HP-S2|title=Avid - Pro Tools - HD Native - Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) from Avid|publisher=|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Native PCIe card has a FPGA chip to facilitate an upgradable option to the card over time. On November 4, 2010, Avid released Pro Tools 9, a lower-cost application that decoupled hardware from software. Among several new features, Pro Tools 9 has a new track feature named HEAT (Harmonically Enhanced Algorithm Technology), which is used for creating what many in the industry are calling [[Harmonically Enhanced Digital Audio (HEDA)|HEDA (Harmonically Enhanced Digital Audio)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avid.com/US/press-room/Avid-Unleashes-Pro-Tools-9 |title=Avid Unleashes Pro Tools 9 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204193730/http://www.avid.com/US/press-room/Avid-Unleashes-Pro-Tools-9 |archive-date=2010-12-04 |website=Avid.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When first available, Pro Tools systems relied exclusively on integral hard disks for storage and were thus limited to the storage options available on the Apple hardware platform. In 2002, AVID rebranded a proprietary [[Storage area network|SAN]] product called MediaNet and promoted it to Pro Tools users who were becoming aware of the benefits of network-based collaboration and workflows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editorsguild.com/v2/magazine/Newsletter/MayJun02/tip_avid_unity.html "Avid's Unity MediaNet"], Editor's Guild Magazine, May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; MediaNet was based on WindowsNT and could only be administered using Windows-based tools. To date, neither Pro Tools HD Native nor Pro Tools 9 support commodity [[network attached storage]], and MediaNet remains Avid's only supported option for accessing storage over the network. There has been some positive experience with using remote storage with Pro Tools via iSCSI technology. A company from Netherlands, Ardis Technologies, produces a SAN solution based on iSCSI protocol, which is aimed primarily to the audio/video postproduction market. It is called DDP (Dynamic Drive Pool). It can use existing Gigabit Ethernet network and does not require additional hardware on the DAW side except Gigabit Ethernet adapter.

===LE systems===
The Pro Tools LE (Limited Edition) line is discontinued as of the release of Pro Tools 9. Pro Tools LE systems performed data processing on the host CPU. Purchasers were required to choose from a range of proprietary audio interfaces, one of which was required for all audio I/O (recording and playback). The hardware thus doubled as a copy-protection mechanism for the software, as the software did not function without the specialized Digidesign interface. The entry-level MBox range of interfaces connect via USB or Firewire 400. All have a stereo audio output, and include a small number of line and microphone inputs. The more powerful 003 (formerly 002) interfaces use FireWire and have significantly larger I/O abilities. The Eleven Rack, in addition to its many input options, includes in-box DSP processing via a FPGA chip offloads the Eleven guitar amp/speaker emulation and guitar effects plug-in processing to the interface, allowing those plug-ins to run without taxing the host system.

Pro Tools LE had a similar look and feel to Pro Tools HD, but had a smaller track count and a lower maximum sampling rate. Pro Tools LE also lacked many features such as the ability to export to MP3, SMPTE time code, Automatic Delay Compensation (ADC), ability to import [[Open Media Framework|OMF]] and [[Advanced Authoring Format|AAF]] files, DigiBase Pro, and multi-track Beat Detective. These features, along with higher track counts, could be accessed via the purchase of the "DV Toolkit" and "Music Production Toolkit" or "Complete Production Toolkit" upgrade packages. Under Pro Tools 9, these upgrades have changed and been combined to the "Complete Production Toolkit 2".

===9 system changes===
In 2010–11, Pro Tools upgraded Pro Tools LE with some of the features of HD and effectively merged it into one hardware-independent software package named Pro Tools Standard. Pro Tools 9 has no proprietary hardware requirement, allowing use of the software with any interface. It can operate using the internal sound card of a PC via the [[Audio Stream Input/Output]] (ASIO) driver and a Mac using [[Core Audio]]. Mac Core Audio also allows, for the first time, the use of aggregate devices, allowing the use of more than one interface at the same time. This can also be achieved on a PC by using the third party application [[ASIO4ALL]]. Pro Tools 9 also included a new keyboard shortcut for "New Playlist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonicscoop.com/2010/12/02/pro-tools-9-do-you-need-it-we-ask-the-early-adopters/|title=Pro Tools 9: Do You Need It? We Ask The Early Adopters - SonicScoop|publisher=|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When operating on a machine containing one or more HD Core, Accel or Native cards, the software will run as Pro Tools HD 9, with the full Pro Tools HD feature set. In all other cases it will run as Pro Tools 9, with a smaller track count and a number of advanced features turned off. However, non-HD Pro Tools 9 users can also gain access to the full feature set with the Complete Production Toolkit 2. Pro Tools 9 also included as standard many features which on Pro Tools LE were only accessible via additional "Toolkit" upgrades. Pro Tools 9 uses [[iLok]] for copy-protection. Pro Tools 9 is the first version to have one 'unified' installer for the software, with the iLok licence determining, which elements of the software are unlocked.

===M-Powered systems===
[[M-Audio]], formerly Midiman, was acquired by [[Avid Technology]] in 2004–2005, and Digidesign soon released Pro Tools M-Powered, which brought Pro Tools LE functionality to a subset of M-Audio USB, FireWire and PCI interfaces. Pro Tools M-Powered uses an [[iLok]] license as copy protection and was formerly the only way to run Pro Tools without using Digidesign/Avid hardware.

===M-Powered Essential===
This is a scaled-down version of the M-Powered system. It was aimed at the starter consumer market, and offers very limited scope, with only 16 tracks, no third-party plug-ins and limited USB device support.

===SE===
Pro Tools SE is a stripped-down version of what used to be Pro Tools LE, also made for beginners. The software is sold in one of three bundles with a hardware unit for guitarists, keyboardists, and vocalists. It also comes with the M-Audio Fast Track and MobilePre USB audio interfaces except for the "Ultra" sub-series. &lt;!--The MobilePre (aka "dongle") may function with Pro Tools as well as Garageband. --&gt;There is no option to upgrade to the full version of Pro Tools from Pro Tools SE.

===Control surfaces===
Digidesign/Avid control surfaces attempt to bridge the gap between old-style analog desks and modern DAWs by providing physical controls for the Pro Tools software. These include the C|24, a 24-fader surface with 16 built-in pre-amps, and the ICON: Integrated Console Environment (consisting of user selectable fader count units D-Command, D-Control and their add-on fader banks and X-Mon monitoring system), which work alongside Pro Tools|HD or Ultimate. Latterly the Avid S6 control surface superseded the ICON as the flagship controller, though ICON systems remain in use worldwide, in mix studios and post production houses, and were the best selling medium/large format "console" of all time.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} VENUE, a similar system, was released for live-sound applications. The Command|8 is a smaller eight-fader control surface. Pro Tools compatible control surfaces have also been developed by other companies. For example, the [[Audient]] ASP2802 has integrated [[digital audio workstation|DAW]] control, and is compatible with Pro Tools as well as [[Logic Pro]] and [[Cubase]].&lt;ref name="SOS2802"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.soundonsound.com/news?NewsID=12672 | title= Musikmesse 2010: Audient ASP 2802 (Video) | accessdate= 13 July 2010 | publisher= [[Sound on Sound]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It therefore provides an external analog mixing interface for the computer. In April 2010, Avid acquired Euphonix, a manufacturer of high quality control surfaces.

==Related products and services==
An official Pro Tools training curriculum and certification program, which includes courses in music and post production, was introduced by Digidesign in 2002. The curriculum is delivered by a number of schools and universities. The Music Production and DV toolkits increase the abilities of non-HD Pro Tools systems. Both increase the maximum number of tracks and highest possible sample rate to 96&amp;nbsp;kHz and include additional plug-ins. The LE-only DV tool kit adds feet and frames and timecode timelines and functionality.

==Advanced Instrument Research (AIR)==
{{see also|AIR Users Blog}}
In August 2005, [[Avid Technology|Avid]] acquired the German company Wizoo, formerly working mainly for [[Steinberg]] (Cubase, Nuendo) and developers of virtual instruments. They further announced the creation of Advanced Instrument Research (AIR), which meant Avid would be developing virtual instruments and plug-ins for use in Pro Tools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://airvirtualinstruments.blogspot.com/2009/01/interview-with-peter-gorges-head-of-air.html Interview with Peter Gorges of AIR] on Air Users Blog&lt;/ref&gt;

This also resulted in the landmark redevelopment of Pro Tools, versions 8 through 10. This relied heavily on the inclusion of AIR Virtual Instrument plug-ins to bring it closer to its competitor [[Logic Pro]]. Those included with Pro Tools Standard (called the Creative Collection) include:

* Structure FREE, a sample playback instrument.
* Boom, a drum machine
* Xpand2, a multi-timbral sample-playback/synthesis plug-in
* DB33, a [[Hammond Organ]] emulator
* Vacuum, a monophonic vintage synth.
* Mini Grand, Piano.

AIR also contributes reverbs, dynamics, modulation and other effects as part of the Pro Tools, all of these work in native format only.

Some of the additional virtual instruments for Pro Tools that AIR has created include:

* Hybrid, a high definition Synthesizer
* Velvet, vintage electric piano
* Transfuser, real-time loop, phrase and groove creator

In July 2012, [[inMusic Brands]], parent company of brands such as [[Akai Professional]] and [[Alesis]], announced its acquisition of AIR from Avid,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.synthtopia.com/content/2012/07/02/avid-downsizes-sells-m-audio-to-inmusic/ | title= Avid Downsizes, Sells M-Audio To inMusic | accessdate= 17 October 2012 | publisher= Synthtopia}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a larger acquisition that included Avid's consumer audio products and the [[M-Audio]] brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://www.avid.com/US/press-room/Avid-Divests-Consumer-Businesses-and-Streamlines-Operations | title= Avid Divests Consumer Businesses and Streamlines Operations | accessdate= 17 October 2012 | publisher= Avid | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121002214830/http://www.avid.com/US/press-room/Avid-Divests-Consumer-Businesses-and-Streamlines-Operations | archivedate= 2 October 2012 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/avid-sells-m-audio-551367 | title= Avid sells M-Audio | accessdate= 18 October 2012 | publisher= MusicRadar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rich Dad''' is a brand established by [[Robert Kiyosaki]] for a series of educational books and games about personal finance. The trademark is owned by Cashflow Technologies, a corporation established in 1997 by Robert and Kim Kiyosaki to market these books and games.

==Books and other media==
''[[Rich Dad Poor Dad]]'' was written by [[Robert Kiyosaki]] and advocates [[financial independence]] through investing, real estate, owning businesses, and the use of finance protection tactics.

Kiyosaki followed with ''Rich Dad's CASHFLOW Quadrant'' and ''Rich Dad's Guide to Investing''. 

Originally self-published before being picked up commercially, the central concept of ''Rich Dad Poor Dad'' is an anecdotal comparison of his "two fathers". His "poor dad" was his biological father, who became [[Superintendent (education)|Superintendent]] of the Hawaii State Department of Education but had very little real [[net worth]] which is contrasted with this is his  "rich dad".

==Didactic games==
Kiyosaki stresses the value of games, particularly ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', as tools for learning basic financial strategies such as "trade four green houses for one red hotel." Kiyosaki has created several games to reinforce the information in his books. 

"Cashflow 101" is a [[board game]] designed by Kiyosaki, which aims to teach the players concepts of [[investing]] and making [[money]].

There are two stages to the game. In the first, "the [[rat race]]", the player aims to raise his or her character's [[passive income]] level to where it exceeds the character's [[expense]]s through a variety of investment options. The winner is determined in the second stage, "the fast track." To win, a player must get his  character to buy his "dream" or accumulate $50,000 in monthly [[cash flow]].

The game forces the players to do the accounts by themselves. In place of "score cards", there are [[financial statements]]. Therefore, players can see more clearly what is happening with their money. It generally shows how assets generate incomes and liabilities and 'doodads' affect expenses.

Basic strategies involved in this game are: buying and selling stocks, cashflow, appreciation, and leverage.

==Controversy==
{{controversy section|date=October 2014}}
In 2010, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] investigated the Rich Dad seminars associated with Kiyosaki on their consumer advocacy program, ''[[Marketplace (Canadian TV program)|Marketplace]]''.&lt;ref name="MarketPlace"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/2010/road_to_rich_dad/main.html|title= Road to Rich Dad: Who's getting rich off Rich Dad?|author= |date= January 29, 2010|work= [[Marketplace (Canadian TV program)|Marketplace]]|publisher= [[Canadian Broadcasting Company|CBC]]|accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that one-day free seminars were conducted at which three-day courses were offered for $500. At the three-day classes, participants were offered longer courses priced between $12,000 and $45,000. A hidden camera was employed at a $500 seminar in [[Kitchener, Ontario]], showing the trainer, Marc Mousseau, advising participants to request that their credit-card be raised and giving out scripts with instructions for how to ask for limits as high as $100,000.&lt;ref name=CBC-Feb1&gt;{{cite news |title= {{-'}}Rich Dad' seminars deceptive: Marketplace|url=http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2010/01/28/consumer-rich-dad-poor-dad-marketplace.html|date= February 1, 2010|publisher= [[CBC News]]|accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show interviewed Bob Aaron,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aaron.ca/main.cfm|title= About Aaron and Aaron |publisher= Aaron and Aaron Barristers and Solicitors|accessdate=February 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a lawyer whose practice is 25% real estate law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawyerahead.ca/lawyer/view/_28/ |title=Bob Aaron |publisher=Lawyerahead.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; who said that some of Mousseau's advice was unusual and unlikely to work, such as advising that a developer might give two condos free when selling ten, getting an [[Option (finance)|option]] to buy the house at a later date and buying a house in pre-foreclosure.&lt;ref name=CBC-Feb1/&gt; The program also found a claim by the trainer to be untrue; he claimed to have been part of a deal that made $32 million on a mobile home park in Saskatchewan, but the park did not exist. The instructor was described as "overbearing, obnoxious, and rude" by an attendee, after showing video footage of his behavior.&lt;ref name="MarketPlace" /&gt;  

On August 20, 2012, one of Kiyosaki's companies, Rich Global LLC, filed for bankruptcy in Wyoming Bankruptcy Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Company Bankruptcy Information for Rich Global LLC|url=http://business-bankruptcies.com/cases/rich-global-llc|date= August 20, 2012|publisher= busbk.com|accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move followed a ruling by a U.S. District Court jury that former business partners of Kiyosaki were entitled to $23,687,957.21 of the profits from events they helped to set up for Kiyosaki including a 2002 appearance at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. A spokesman for Kiyosaki asserted that the amount of the award exceeded the value of Rich Global LLC and that Kiyosaki would not use money from outside the company to meet the judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Rich Dad, Poor Dad now a bankrupt dad: Best-selling author files for corporate bankruptcy after losing $24m judgement|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2215642/Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad-bankrupt-dad-Best-selling-author-files-corporate-bankruptcy-losing-24m-judgement.html|date= October 10, 2012|work= [[Daily Mail]]|location=London|accessdate=2012-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rich Dad Education==

Part of Rich Dad Education's mission is to increase financial literacy among youth. Rich Dad Education’s CEO Anthony Humpage was interviewed by Business Insider&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kane|first1=Libby|title=6 Money Lessons You Should Have Learned Before College|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-teens-should-know-about-money-college-2014-7|publisher=Business Insider|date=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in July 2014 for teaching the lessons that college bound teens need to know about financial independence.

The '''Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies''' ({{lang-nl|Koninklijk Instituut voor Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde|lit = Royal Institute for the Linguistics, Geography and [[Ethnology]]}}, abbreviated: '''KITLV''') at [[Leiden]] was founded in 1851. Its objective is the advancement of the study of the [[anthropology]], [[linguistics]], [[social sciences]], and [[history]] of [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Pacific Area]], and the [[Caribbean]]. Special emphasis is laid on the former Dutch colonies of the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]), [[Suriname]], and the [[Dutch West Indies]] (the [[Netherlands Antilles]] and [[Aruba]]). Its unique collection of books, manuscripts, prints and photographs attracts visiting scholars from all over the world. On July 1, 2014, the management of the collection was taken over by [[Leiden University Libraries]].

== Jakarta ==

In 1969, a KITLV office was started by [[Hans Ras]] in [[Jakarta]] ("KITLV-Jakarta"), as a part of an agreement with the [[Indonesian Institute of Sciences]]. Here, publications from Indonesia, [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] are bought and given a place in the library of the institute, publications of the institute are sold, and original scientific works in the [[Dutch language]] are translated into [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. The Jakarta office is, since July 1, 2014, part of [[Leiden University Libraries]] and Representative Office of Leiden University doubles as the [[representative office]] of Leiden University.

== Publications ==
The KITLV Press published and distributed academic books on Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies. It also published three journals: 
* ''[[Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde]]'',  
* ''Journal of Indonesian Social Sciences and Humanities'', and  
* ''[[New West Indian Guide]] / Nieuwe West-Indische Gids''. 
[[Brill Publishers|Brill]] acquired KITLV Press in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brill.com/news/brill-completes-acquisition-kitlv-press Brill Completes Acquisition of KITLV Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''stereopticon''' is a [[slide projector]] or "[[magic lantern]]", which has two lenses, usually one above the other.
These devices date back to the mid 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were a popular form of entertainment and education before the advent of [[motion picture|moving pictures]]. Americans William and [[Frederick Langenheim]] introduced stereopticon slide technology—slide shows of projected images on glass—in 1850.  For a usual fee of ten cents, people could view realistic images of nature, history, and science themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.magiclanternsociety.org/about-magic-lanterns/lantern-slides/|title=Lantern Slides {{!}} Magic Lantern Society|website=www.magiclanternsociety.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two lenses are used to dissolve between images when projected. At first, the shows used random images, but over time, lanternists began to place the slides in logical order, creating a narrative.  This "visual storytelling" with technology directly preceded the development of the first moving pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The term stereopticon has been widely misused to name a [[stereoscope]]. A stereopticon will not project or display stereoscopic/[[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] images on cards. All stereopticons can be classified as [[Magic lantern|magic lanterns]], but not all magic lanterns are stereopticons.

[[File:The_Making_of_the_English_Landscape_Hoskins_Penguin.jpg|thumb|upright|From 1970 onwards, [[Penguin Books]] released versions of ''The Making of the English Landscape'' in numerous reprints, alongside hardback editions from [[Hodder and Stoughton]] and other publishers.&lt;ref name="WorldCatPenguin"/&gt;]]

'''''The Making of the English Landscape''''' is a 1955 book by the English local historian [[William George Hoskins]]. It is illustrated with 82 monochrome plates, mostly photographs by Hoskins himself, and 17 maps or plans. It has appeared in at least 35 editions and reprints in English and other languages.

The book is a [[landscape history]] of England and a seminal text in that discipline and in [[local history]]. The brief history of some one thousand years is widely used in local and [[environmental history]] courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.history.ac.uk/makinghistory/resources/articles/environmental_history.html | title=Making History: British environmental history | publisher=History.ac.uk | year=2008 | accessdate=26 May 2014 | author=Cooper, Timothy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoskins defines the theme of the book in the first chapter, arguing that a landscape historian needs to use [[botany]], [[physical geography]] and [[natural history]] as well as [[history|historical]] knowledge to interpret any given scene fully. The remaining chapters describe how the English landscape was formed from the [[Anglo-Saxon]] period onwards, starting c. 450 AD, and looking in detail at the [[middle ages|mediaeval]] landscape, the depopulation following the [[Black Death]], the [[Tudor period]] through to the splendour of the [[Georgian period]], the parliamentary [[enclosure]]s that affected much of the English midlands, the [[industrial revolution]], the development of road, canal, and railway transport networks, and finally the growth of towns from Norman times onwards. There is little mention of cities. The concluding chapter however laments the damage done to the English countryside by "the villainous requirements of the new age"&lt;ref name=Hoskins231/&gt; such as military airfields and arterial roads, describes the new England as barbaric, and invites the reader to contemplate the past.

The work has been widely admired, but also described as grandly emotive, populist, and openly anti-modernist. Writers have praised the book for helping them understand and interpret the landscape in which they lived.

==Book==

===Overview===

The introduction sets out Hoskins' stall with "No book exists to describe the manner in which the various landscapes of this country came to assume the shape and appearance they now have",&lt;ref name=Intro&gt;''The Making of the English Landscape'', 1955. Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; mentioning geology ("only one aspect of the subject"),&lt;ref name=Intro/&gt; the clearing of woodlands, the reclaiming of moor and marsh, the creation of fields, roads, towns, country houses, mines, canals and railways: "in short, with everything that has altered the natural landscape."&lt;ref name=Intro/&gt;

===Editions and translations===

In 2005, the [[Folio Society]] published an edition in England.

In 2013, Little Toller books published a paperback edition in England.

===Illustrations===

The book is illustrated with 82 monochrome plates and 17 maps or plans, all uncredited except for some use of [[Ordnance Survey]] maps, and so apparently the work of Hoskins himself. These are closely integrated into the text; for example, the text in chapter 1 is accompanied by a pair of diagrams showing how a [[sunken lane|holloway]] ('hollow way') could be formed by the digging of a 'double ditch', i.e. a pair of raised earth banks either side of a ditch to mark the boundary of two estates, and supported by a photograph (Plate 13) of a sunken lane in Devon, explained by Hoskins as a boundary, from probably the seventh century, between the Saxon estates of (royal) Silverton and Exeter Abbey. The photograph shows high hedgebanks in bright sunshine, dwarfing the figure of a woman in the middle distance.

==Contents==

The book covers its subject in 10 chapters:

===1. The Landscape before the English Settlement===
[[File:The Malvern Hills - geograph.org.uk - 1456678.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|The [[Malvern Hills]] above the [[Severn]] plain of the English West Midlands]]

Hoskins uses the first few pages of this chapter as an introduction, beginning with praise for [[William Wordsworth]]'s ''[[A Guide through the District of the Lakes]]'' (1810), and from which he quotes a passage in which the reader is asked to envisage "an image of the tides visiting and revisiting the friths, the main sea dashing against the bolder shore".&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p17&lt;/ref&gt; Hoskins writes that on a desolate moor one can feel oneself imaginatively back in time to the [[Bronze Age]], but that there are now few such unaltered places left. He argues that the landscape historian "needs to be a [[botanist]], a [[physical geography|physical geographer]], and a [[naturalist]], as well as an historian"&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p19&lt;/ref&gt; to understand a scene in full:

{{quote|For what a many-sided pleasure there is in looking at a wide view anywhere in England, not simply as a sun-drenched whole, fading into unknown blue distances, like the view of the West Midland plain from the top of the [[Malvern Hills]], or at a pleasant rural miniature like the crumpled [[Woburn, Bedfordshire|Woburn]] ridge in homely [[Bedfordshire]]; but in recognizing every one of its details name by name, in knowing how and when each came to be there, why it is just that colour, shape, or size, and not otherwise, and in seeing how the various [[patterns in nature|patterns]] and parts fit together to make the whole scene.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. pp19–20&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The rest of the chapter covers [[Prehistoric Britain|Pre-Roman]], Western (i.e. [[Celts|Celtic]]) and [[Roman Britain]]. He estimates very roughly that 750,000 acres at most were in use as arable or grassland in Roman times, compared to 27 million acres in 1914.

===2. The English Settlement===
[[File:Medieval Ridge and Furrow above Wood Stanway - geograph.org.uk - 640050.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The method of ploughing the fields created a distinctive [[ridge and furrow]] pattern in [[open field system]] farming. The outlines of the [[mediaeval]] strips of cultivation, called selions, are still clearly visible in these now enclosed fields at [[Wood Stanway]], Gloucestershire.]]

Hoskins describes how England was settled with [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] people between c. 450 and 1066 AD, making the country a land of villages. Estate boundaries from this period survive in features such as sunken lanes and banks. The [[Viking Britain|Scandinavian]] conquest of much of England from the late 9th century added more villages, though many with Scandinavian placename elements such as -by ('village') may simply have been renamed Saxon settlements.

Many English villages were given their shape in this period, and almost all are described in some detail in the eleventh century [[Domesday Book]]. Hoskins identifies three major types of village: those around a green or central square, as at [[Finchingfield]] in Essex; those along a single street, like [[Henley in Arden]] in Warwickshire; and those consisting of apparently haphazardly scattered dwellings, like [[Barton, Oxfordshire|Middle Barton]] near Hoskins's home in Oxfordshire.

===3. The Colonization of Mediaeval England===

This chapter looks at the [[middle ages|mediaeval]] landscape from the [[Domesday Book]] onwards, with the section 'The Landscape in 1086'. The country had almost every village that exists today; a typical one, Hoskins writes, had a small [[watermill]] and a church without a spire.

In 'The Clearing of the Woodlands', Hoskins argues that before the 15th century England must have looked like one great forest, but most of the woods were cleared for arable or pasture in the 12th and 13th centuries. Under [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] perhaps a third of the country was royal forest.

Hoskins begins the section on 'Marsh, Fen, and Moor' with the words "There are certain sheets of the one-inch Ordnance Survey maps which one can sit down and read like a book for an hour on end, with growing pleasure and imaginative excitement".&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p95&lt;/ref&gt; One such section is of [[The Wash]], rich in mediaeval detail. Marshes such as those in [[Lincolnshire]], Norfolk and the [[Pevensey Levels]] were reclaimed at this time, whole communities working together, often under the [[Danelaw]].

[[File:South Middleton deserted village - geograph.org.uk - 388966.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|South Middleton, a [[deserted village]] in Northumberland]]

'Buildings in the landscape' briefly describes abbeys, churches, mills, bridges and castles built to serve the growing population, which just before the Black Death had tripled since Domesday.

===4. The Black Death and after===

Hoskins describes the [[abandoned village|abandonment of villages]] from the [[bubonic plague]] of 1348, the [[Black Death]], which killed a third to a half of the population (he states), and the subsequent new colonisation and building as the population eventually recovered. Marginal land such as the [[Breckland]] of Norfolk and Suffolk, never thickly populated, was abandoned. Many villages in counties such as [[Leicestershire]] were deserted. Villages such as Lower Ditchford in [[Gloucestershire]] can be seen today only as a ground-plan from the air.

Between 1350 and 1500, many new buildings appeared, especially churches with towers like [[Church of St Mary and All Saints, Fotheringhay|Fotheringhay]] in Northamptonshire. Some fine bridges as at [[Wadebridge]] in Cornwall are from this period.

===5. Tudor to Georgian England===
[[File:Front of Burghley House 2009.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The façade of [[Burghley House]], built between 1558 and 1587]]

Hoskins starts this chapter by observing that in 1500 in [[Tudor period|Tudor times]] there were roughly three sheep for every human being in England, perhaps 8 million sheep to two and a half million people. There were four million acres of hardwood forest, remembered now as [[Epping Forest]], the [[Forest of Arden]], [[Sherwood Forest]], the [[Forest of Dean]], [[Wychwood]] and many others. A village might be surrounded by a single enormous thousand acre field, shared amongst all the village's farmers. There were extensive heaths and wild places, largely uninhabited, with "no industrial smoke, nothing faster on the roads than a horse, no incessant noises from the sky".&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p139&lt;/ref&gt; The first enclosures and the flowering of rural England, country houses and parks such as the magnificent [[Burghley House]] and [[Knole]] date from this period up to [[Georgian period|Georgian times]].

===6. Parliamentary Enclosure and the Landscape===
[[File:Canterbury Orchards 1945 OS Map 171 detail.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Orchards]] around [[Canterbury, Kent]] in the 'Garden of England' on 1945 one-inch [[Ordnance Survey]] map. Some fields and orchards appear to have been enclosed directly from the woods to the west of the town in [[mediaeval]] times. The network of [[Roman road]]s to the town had been joined by a network of five railway lines.]]

In this chapter Hoskins describes the effects of enclosure on the landscape and on fields, hedgerows and trees, roads and farmhouses. He begins by quoting the rural poet [[John Clare]]: "Inclosure, thou'rt a curse upon the land, and tasteless was the wretch who thy existence plann'd".&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p177&lt;/ref&gt;

Parliamentary enclosures accounted for about 4.5 million acres of what had been open fields, not counting the enclosure of [[common land]] and wild 'waste'. In 1700 roughly half England's arable land was already enclosed; by the end of the enclosure process, almost all of it was. The revolution in the landscape began in about 1750, affecting about 3,000 parishes, especially in the English midlands. Between 1760 and 1800 there were 1,479 enclosure acts, covering 2.5 million acres; another 1.5 million acres were enclosed by 1844, by more than a thousand further acts. Some counties such as Kent, Essex and Devon were little affected, having largely been enclosed much earlier, often directly from forest or moorland. Many miles of new straight hedgerows were laid to mark out the newly enclosed fields of the midlands; in some areas such as [[Derbyshire]], straight limestone walls were used instead. Many straight new roads were created at the same time. Farmhouses remained in the old villages at first, but new red-brick [[Victorian era|Victorian]] ones were often built in the middle of their now enclosed land in due course.

===7. The Industrial Revolution and the Landscape===

Hoskins begins his chapter on [[Industrial revolution|industrialisation]] with the remark "England was still a peaceful agricultural country at the beginning of the seventeenth century."&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p211&lt;/ref&gt; He describes the early industrial landscape, water power and early mills, steam power and slums. He names transformative inventions such as Kay's [[flying shuttle]] of 1733 and Hargreaves's [[spinning jenny]] of 1767, and comments that Matthew Boulton opened his [[steam engine]] factory "in the still unravished country"&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p215&lt;/ref&gt; outside Birmingham in 1765. He quotes a poem by [[Anna Seward]] lamenting the ravishing of [[Coalbrookdale]], c. 1785, and one by Wordsworth from ''The Excursion''. He is critical of the industrial slums and the smoke and dirt of the [[Staffordshire Potteries]]. He emphasises the rapid growth of industrial towns like [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], and of new towns like [[Middlesbrough]], which went from a single farm in 1830 to over 50,000 inhabitants in 1880. However he appreciates the mining landscapes of [[Cornwall]], including the gleaming white [[china clay]] pits of [[St Austell]] and the abandoned tin mines of [[St Cleer]], commenting that "there is a point, as [[Arthur Young (agriculturist)|Arthur Young]] saw, when industrial ugliness becomes [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]".&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p232&lt;/ref&gt;

===8. Roads, Canals, and Railways===
[[Image:Canal boats at Stourport Basin.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The canal basin at [[Stourport]], the only town in England to be created by [[Canals in the United Kingdom|canals]], according to Hoskins]]

Hoskins describes roads and trackways from the Iron Age (like the [[Jurassic Way]] across the midlands, near his Oxfordshire home) and Roman times (like [[Akeman Street]] in the same area). He notes that the [[Fosse Way]] runs for miles in Gloucestershire away from any village, as the Anglo-Saxons built villages away from large roads for safety. Still in his home area, he records that "the wide green track now called Dornford Lane"&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p240&lt;/ref&gt; was built in the 10th century for supplies to be carted from the Anglo-Saxon kings' own estate at &lt;!--Westcott, Middle and Steeple--&gt;Barton. He goes on to describe the building of the [[Canals in the United Kingdom|canal network]] between roughly 1760 and 1825, noting that just one town was created by the canals, [[Stourport]]. Soon afterwards, a much more widespread transport network transformed the English landscape: the [[Rail transport in Great Britain|railways]]. Hoskins devotes over a page to each of two quotations from [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Dombey and Son]]'', describing the construction in 1836 of a railway in [[Camden Town]]. He mentions, too, that Wordsworth campaigned against the railway from [[Kendal]] to [[Windermere]], bringing trains into the heart of the Lake District, and that conservatives like Wordsworth "lost all along the line".&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p263&lt;/ref&gt;

===9. The Landscape of Towns===
[[File:Marlborough Centre.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The main street in the former [[market town]] of [[Marlborough, Wiltshire]] is exceptionally wide, probably made, argues Hoskins, to hold the once regular sheep market.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p291&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the houses were rebuilt in brick or refronted with tiles in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66528 | title=The Borough of Marlborough | publisher=British History Online | year=1983 | accessdate=27 May 2014 | author=Crowley, D. A. (editor)}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The last chapter of the body of the book – if Chapter 10 is considered more or less an epilogue – covers towns seen as part of the English landscape. Hoskins justifies this on the grounds that understanding [[town]]s brings pleasure. He describes in turn planned towns, the open-field town, and the [[market town]]. Towns were planned as early as Norman times, [[Abbot Baldwin]] planning [[Bury St Edmunds]] between 1066 and 1086; [[Stratford-on-Avon]] was laid out in 1196. Another burst of town planning came with the [[spa town]]s in the late 18th century, and of new industrial towns like Middlesbrough and [[Barrow-in-Furness]] in the mid 19th century. Open-field towns like [[Nottingham]], [[Leicester]], and [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]] grew naturally in their own open fields, but were trapped by pasture rights from growing in the 19th century, giving Nottingham slums, and Leicester a problem that it just managed to solve, growing across its fields: while Stamford stopped growing entirely, becoming fossilised as what Hoskins calls a museum piece of a beautiful 17th and 18th century town.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p280&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the [[market town]]s like Marlborough grew up around their often large and handsome market places, which are however of any number of shapes.

===10. The Landscape Today===
Hoskins concludes with a brief chapter, with one image, Plate 82, "The completed English landscape" showing a tall tree in a wide open field, a strip of hedges and villages just visible in the distance. The chapter laments the damage caused to parts of the English landscape, mentioning bulldozers and tractors, nuclear bombers and by-passes, and ends by celebrating again the wealth of detail within a few hundred yards of Hoskins' study window at [[Steeple Barton]].

==Reception==

===Contemporary===

The geographer [[E. G. R. Taylor]], reviewing the book for the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in 1955, wrote that Hoskins made the case for getting a strong pair of boots to learn landscape history clearly enough. Taylor compared the book to [[Dudley Stamp]]'s ''Man and the Land'', published a few months earlier in 1955, saying that Hoskins seemed to have missed it, but that given the differences in their approaches, they could be read side by side. She noted also that Hoskins did not talk about London though he covered town landscapes, and appeared unaware of [[urban geography]]. Her review ended by remarking that Hoskins "views the industrial revolution with mounting horror, and the industrialists themselves are bitterly chastised as 'completely and grotesquely insensitive. No scruples weakened their lust for money; they made their money and left their muck.'"&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; She noted however that Hoskins had happily moved to "a quiet spot in Oxfordshire where he can forget the 'barbaric England of the scientists, the military men and the politicians' and look out of his study window on to the past",&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; where, she wrote, he "draws for us a last tender and evocative picture of the 'gentle unravished English landscape.'"&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; Dr. Hoskins, she wrote, forgetting all the horrors, "reaches back through the centuries one by one and rediscovers Eden".&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=1791761 | title=The English Scene: Review | author=Taylor, E.

[[Penelope Lively]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', describes the book as

{{quote|a marvellous, robust, opinionated account of the landscape as narrative, whether rural or urban, the visible record of what has gone before, once you know how to read it – or once he has told you how. You were to put on your walking boots and understand the country in which you lived. Plenty did, or tried to; I did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/25/hero-wg-hoskins-penelope-lively | title=My Hero: WG Hoskins by Penelope Lively | work=The Guardian | date=25 November 2011 | accessdate=26 May 2014 | author=Lively, Penelope}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]], also in ''The Guardian'', described the book as "an absolute trailblazer, a revolution."&lt;ref name=Boyd&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/11/rereading-making-english-landscape | title=William Boyd: rereading The Making of the English Landscape by WG Hoskins | work=The Guardian | date=11 May 2013 | accessdate=26 May 2014 | author=Boyd, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that [[W. H. Auden]] "revered" the book, and that reading Hoskins had enabled him to 'read' a landscape as a "historical [[palimpsest]]":&lt;ref name=Boyd/&gt;

{{quote|The familiar English countryside, in whatever regional variation, became a form of historical palimpsest – its evolving history there to be decoded and discerned for those who could look at it through the innovative lens that Hoskins provided. It was as if the landscape was all of a sudden an archaeological dig – hills and dales, woods and copses, fields and rivers, villages and roads ceased to be simple features of a view. Instead the whole history of English humankind and husbandry was on display, from the Holocene age to the latest horrors of agribusiness. And the book in which that history was written was the very land itself.&lt;ref name=Boyd/&gt;}}

Local historian Graeme White, in ''The Medieval English Landscape, 1400–1540'', calls Hoskins' book "brilliantly-crafted" and observes that "Although this famously railed against the 'England of the arterial by-pass, treeless and stinking of diesel oil' – along with much else belonging to the mid-twentieth century – the fact that national car ownership more than doubled during the 1950s made this a subject whose time had come."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RmnwVXGZNC8C | title=The Medieval English Landscape, 1400–1540 | publisher=A&amp;C Black | author=White, Graeme J. | year=2012 | pages=Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], writing in ''[[The Spectator]]'', said that the book "was for me an eye-opener, as it was for many people. It told us of the extent to which our landscape had been made by man, not God, and taught us to look much more observantly at it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/6050223/not-every-aspect-pleases/ | title=Not every aspect pleases | work=The Spectator | date=2 June 2010 | accessdate=27 May 2014 | author=Johnson, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===An assessment===

Matthew H. Johnson, writing a chapter on English culture and landscape in the edited book ''The Public Value of the Humanities'', identifies "six key points" established by Hoskins:&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.bloomsburycollections.com/book/the-public-value-of-the-humanities/ch9-making-a-home | title=Chapter 9. Making a Home: English Culture and English Landscape | publisher=Bloomsbury Academic | author=Johnson, Matthew H. | year=2011 | pages=118–130 | work=The Public Value of the Humanities | editor=Bate, Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:1. The landscape is of great antiquity ("everything is much older than we think"&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1955. p 12&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

:2. Landscapes often changed suddenly, as in the 18th century enclosures.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

:3. Hoskins, following [[O. G. S. Crawford]]'s 1953 ''Archaeology in the Field'', stressed we had to read the landscape using research to reveal its cultural value.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

:4. Hoskins thus told a "grand and emotive story about that landscape."&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; Johnson compares this to [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s account in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' when the [[hobbit]]s return to a "despoiled and industrialized landscape of [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]]".&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

:5. The narrative is [[populism|populist]], to be disseminated "to anyone who would listen."&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; The result was that it became part of English post-war culture.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

:6. It was "openly anti-[[modernist]]". In evidence, Johnson cites Hoskins's "most famous passage" from the concluding chapter:&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

:{{quote|What else has happened in the immemorial landscape of the English countryside? Airfields have flayed it bare … Poor devastated Lincolnshire and Suffolk! And those long gentle lines of the dip-slope of the Cotswolds, those misty uplands of the sheep-grey oolite, how they have lent themselves to the villainous requirements of the new age! Over them drones, day after day, the obscene shape of the atom-bomber, laying a trail like a filthy slug upon Constable's and Gainsborough's sky. England of the [[Nissen hut|Nissen-hut]], the "[[Prefabs in the UK|pre-fab]]", and the electric fence, of the high barbed wire around some unmentionable devilment; England of the arterial by-pass, treeless and stinking of diesel oil, murderous with lorries; England of the bombing-range wherever there was once silence … Barbaric England of the scientists, the military men, and the politicians; let us turn away and contemplate the past before all is lost to the vandals.|W.G. Hoskins, ''The Making of the English Landscape'', Chapter 10.&lt;ref name=Hoskins231&gt;Hoskins, 1955. pp231–2&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Television==
In 1972 the BBC broadcast an episode of the television programme ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' on ''The Making of the English Landscape'' produced by Peter Jones, and featuring Hoskins as presenter.&lt;ref name="Hoskins, W. G. presenter; Jones, Peter producer"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2272237/ | title=Horizon: The Making of the English Landscape | publisher=IMDb (originally BBC) | origyear=(broadcast) 26 October 1972 | accessdate=27 May 2014 | author=Hoskins, W.
