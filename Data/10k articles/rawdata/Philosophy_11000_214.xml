      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2368">The '''assignment of income doctrine''' is a [[judicial doctrine]] developed in [[United States]] [[case law]] by courts trying to limit [[tax evasion]].  The assignment of income doctrine seeks to "preserve the progressive rate structure of [[Internal Revenue Code|the Code]] by prohibiting the splitting of income among taxable entities."&lt;ref&gt;David Mattingly, Empty Forms:  Applying the Assignment of Income Doctrine to Contingent Liability Tax Shelters, 94 Georgetown Law Journal 1993, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[United States Supreme Court]] created the assignment of income doctrine in the ''[[Lucas v. Earl]]'' decision.&lt;ref&gt;    {{ussc|name=Lucas v. Earl|link=|volume=281|page=111|pin=|year=1930}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court held that income from services is taxed to the party who performed the services.&lt;ref name="281 U.S. 111, 115 1930"&gt;''Lucas v. Earl,'' 281 U.S. at 115.&lt;/ref&gt; To elaborate on this principle, the decision used the metaphor that "the fruits cannot be attributed to a different tree from that on which they grew."&lt;ref name="281 U.S. 111, 115 1930"/&gt; The case is used to support the proposition that the substance of the transaction, rather than the form, is controlling for tax purposes.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=106542,00.html IRS article].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The doctrine was later expanded in the ''[[Helvering v. Horst]]'' decision to include income from property.&lt;ref name="Helvering"&gt;{{ussc|name=Helvering v. Horst|link=|volume=311|page=112|pin=|year=1940}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision relied on the principle that the power to dispose of income and the enjoyment of property's economic benefits is the equivalent of ownership.&lt;ref name="Helvering"/&gt;

==Impact==
This doctrine has important implications for taxpayers trying to shift their tax burden to another person. When assigning income to another person (particularly a family member) in the form of a gift, the courts will usually see it as a way to avoid tax and thus consider it “fruit.” Only in an arms-length sale do the courts see the “tree” itself being moved.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, Samuel A., ''Federal Income Taxation of Individuals:  Cases, Problems and Materials'' 155 (2d ed. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Avguštin Stegenšek''' [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph. D.]]  (7 July 1875 in [[Tevče, Laško]] &amp;ndash; 16 March 1920) was a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] [[theologian]], [[philosopher]] and [[art historian]].

After his graduation of [[theology]], he left for [[Rome]] to study [[archaeology]] and [[art history]]. Later, he was awarded a doctor's degree of [[philosophy]] sciences at the university of [[Graz]] in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Rebič Adalbert, Splošni religijski leksikon, page 1158&lt;/ref&gt; He took part in the Historic Society for Slovene [[Styria]], founded 1906, and was appointed honorary conservator in Styria by Committee for the protection of monuments in [[Vienna]]. Stegenšek was the pioneer of the [[monumental topography]] on the territory of [[Slovenia]]. He framed the monumental work »Cerkveni spomeniki lavantinske škofije« (Church Monuments of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Maribor|Lavantine Diocese]]), which included two issues »Dekanija Gornji Grad« ([[Deanery]] [[Gornji Grad, Gornji Grad|Gornji Grad]]) and Konjiška Dekanija ([[Deanery]] [[Slovenske Konjice]]) got up by his own [[photography|photographs]] and drawings as well edited and published on his own.&lt;ref&gt;Boldin Aleksandra, Dr. Avguštin Stegenšek in Konjiška dekanija&lt;/ref&gt;

Stegenšek died in Maribor in 1920.

'''''Book of the Civilized Man by Daniel of Beccles''''' ({{lang-la|Urbanus Magnus Danielis Becclesiensis}}, also known as '''''Liber Urbani''''', '''''Urbanus Magnus''''', or '''''Civilized Man''''') is believed to be the first English [[courtesy book]] (or book of manners), dating probably from the beginning of the 13th century. The book is significant because in the later [[Middle Ages]] dozens of such courtesy books were produced. Because this appears to be the first in English history, it represented a new awakening to [[etiquette]] and decorum in English court society, which occurred in the 13th century. As a general rule, a book of etiquette is a mark of a dynamic rather than a stable society, one in which there is an influx of "new" men, who have not been indoctrinated with the correct decorum from an early age and who are avid to catch up in a hurry.

==The poem==
''Civilized Man'' is a 3000-line [[Latin]] [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] poem that gives proper advice on a wide range of social situations that the typical medieval person might have encountered in day-to-day life.

Examples include:
*If you wish to belch, remember to look up to the ceiling.
*Do not attack your enemy while he is squatting to defecate.
*If there is something you do not want people to know, do not tell it to your wife.
*Say thank you to your host.
*Don't mount your horse in the hall.
*If visitors had already eaten, give them drink anyway.
*Loosen your reins when riding over a bridge.
*Receive gifts from great men with gratitude.
*If you are a judge, be just.
*Eating at the table of the rich, speak little.
*The book ends with "Old King Henry first gave to the uncourtly the teaching written in this book."

==The poet==
Historians believe that Daniel of Beccles may have been a member of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]'s court. [[John Bale]] (16th century) wrote that he had seen a document showing Daniel in Henry's court for over 30 years. This, the fact that a Henry is mentioned in the text, and some of the manuscripts can be dated to the early 13th century, make it very probable the poem dates from that period. There a reference to a Daniel of Beccles in the "Seventh Regnal Year of King John" (circa 1206) secretly being given the patronage (advowson) of the church of Endgate in Beccles by the Abbot of Bury St Edmund's.

==Three themes==
There are three major recurrent themes in the poem: social hierarchy, self-control and sexual morality.

The first theme is the emphasis on [[social hierarchy]] and how to behave around those of higher or lower status (lords and servants). The poem takes the general tone of addressing the reader as someone who is a "householder". This can be seen in the opening lines of the poem "Reader, if you wish to be adorned with good manners, if you wish to be respected and lead a civilized life as a noble householder...". In other words, it addresses a very minor upper percentage of the general population who own households and have servants, the class that from the 16th century might be identified as "country [[gentry]]".

The second recurrent theme is self-control, in general holding oneself inward when it comes to speaking, eating and [[fart|bodily emissions]]. When it comes to speaking, "Be careful to whom, what, why and when you speak". He suggests it is better to keep your thoughts to yourself. When it comes to eating, he suggests small bites, not overeating, not playing with food, no using fingers to clean bowls. Also, guests and servants should not urinate in the dining hall, but the host may.

The third recurrent theme is [[sexual morality]]. The ''Civilized Man'' was clearly written for men. It offers advice on [[prostitute]]s: "If you are overcome with erotic desire when you are young and your penis drives you to go to a prostitute, do not go to a common whore; empty your testicles quickly and depart quickly." He offers advice on how to pick a wife, which includes looking at her property value and personal traits. Following a tradition inherited from antiquity, Daniel describes women as lustful and untrustworthy. The poem describes a woman lying in bed with her husband, with her thoughts on to her secret lover: "The lascivious woman throws herself around the neck of her lover, her fingers give him those secret touches that she denies to her husband in bed; one wicked act with her lover pleases the lascivious adulteress more than a hundred with her husband; women's minds always burn for the forbidden." He says she is always ready to fornicate "with a cook or a half-wit, a peasant or a ploughman, or a chaplain... what she longs for is a thick, leaping, robust piece of equipment, long, smooth and stiff... such are the things that charm and delight women". Daniel had a nearly pathological view of the promiscuity of women, but despite this he says "Whatever your wife does, do not damage your marriage" and he goes on to say "if you are jealous, do not whisper a word about it... when you are jealous, learn to look up at the ceiling." The message is clearly in the same theme of holding inward and avoiding any embarrassments at all cost.

Daniel's advice comes to a climax in what is perhaps the most difficult situation of all: the wife of one's lord makes a sexual proposition. It is a combination of the three problems: hierarchical relationships, control of bodily emissions, and sexual morality. Daniel's solution? Pretend to be ill.

==Philosophical work==
Elgin's work has considered such questions as "what makes something cognitively valuable?"  As an epistemologist, she considers the pursuit of understanding to be of higher value than the pursuit of knowledge.&lt;ref name="havahd"/&gt;

In ''Considered Judgement'', Elgin argues for "a reconception that takes reflective equilibrium as the standard of rational acceptability."&lt;ref name="princeton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/6075.html|title=Considered Judgment|publisher=Princeton University Press|accessdate=2009-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9493">'''Charles de Bovelles''' ({{lang-la|Carolus Bovillus}}; born c. 1475 at [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint-Quentin]], died at [[Ham, Somme]] after 1566) was a [[French people|French]] [[mathematician]] and philosopher, and canon of [[Noyon]]. His ''Géométrie en françoys'' (1511) was the first scientific work to be printed in French.
[[Image:Bouelles - Geometrie practique, 1551 - 1228411.jpg|thumb|''Geometrie practique'', 1551]]

Bovelles authored a number of philological, theological and mystical treatises, and has been reckoned to be "perhaps the most remarkable French thinker of the 16th century."&lt;ref&gt;Albert Rivaud. Cf. [[:fr:Charles de Bovelles|French Wikipédia article]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Joseph Victor has written the best intellectual biography of Charles de Bovelles, but got the date of his death wrong.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

He studied arithmetic under [[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]]. His contemporaries knew him as widely travelled in Europe. 
It is known that he made a [[rebus]] for the year (1509) of the building of the ''hôtel de ville'' in Saint-Quentin. He gave a stained glass window in the town in 1521. In 1547, in the preface of ''La Geometrie practique'', Bovelles acknowledges help from [[Oronce Fine]] with the engravings.

Maupin (end of nineteenth century) assigned dates 1470-1553, which confused many people subsequently. S. Musial in a careful study published in the Actes of the 500th centennial of his birth in Noyon in 1979 (published 1982) fixes the date of his death at 1567 (see also Margolin's Letters and Poems of Charles de Bovelles, 2002).

His first major work, ''Quæ in hoc volumine'' (1510/11), a collection of 12 works by Bovelles that constitute a major but still little recognized contribution to the philosophical thought of the Renaissance. Of these 12 works, the Liber de Sapiente is certainly the most significant, serving to summarize and synthesize the ideas presented in the other short treatises. In fact, the Liber de Sapiente is the only part of In Hoc Volumine that has had a modern edition having been translated once into Italian and twice into French. And yet this work still has no English translation.  The Liber de sapiente is important to intellectual history because it exemplifies the transition between Medieval and Renaissance thinking. Ernst Cassirer considered the Liber de Sapiente, "perhaps the most curious and in some respects the most characteristic creation of Renaissance philosophy … [because] in no other work can we find such an intimate union of old and new ideas." (1927, p.&amp;nbsp;88).  Cassirer even included a critical Latin edition of the de Sapiente prepared by his student as an appendix to The Individual and the Cosmos in Renaissance Philosophy.

In geometry, Bovelles was a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]]: objects and living beings take up regular shapes. Some of his chapters, on [[Bell (instrument)|bell]]s, [[physiognomy]], machines, are representative of the period.

[[Michel Chasles]], in his ''Aperçu historique... des méthodes en géométrie'', points out Bovelles for his work on star polyhedra, a successor in this of [[Thomas Bradwardine]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8832">The '''Code of Rajah Kalantiaw''' was a supposed [[legal code]] in the epic history [[Maragtas (book)|Maragtas]] that is said to have been written in 1433 by Datu [[Kalantiaw]], a chief on the island of [[Negros Island|Negros]] in the [[Philippines]]. The code is now believed by many historians to have been a hoax and that it had actually been written in 1913 by [[Jose E. Marco]] as a part of his historical fiction ''Las antiguas leyendas de la Isla de Negros'' ({{lang-en|The Ancient Legends of the Island of Negros}}), which he attributed to a priest named [[Jose Maria Pavon]].

Philippine historian [[Teodoro Agoncillo]] describes the code as "a disputed document."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite doubts on its authenticity, some history texts continue to present it as historical fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zulueta|Nebres|2003|pp=28–33}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and doubts of authenticity==

In 1917, the historian [[Josué Soncuya]] wrote about the Code of Kalantiaw in his book ''Historia Prehispana de Filipinas'' ("Prehispanic History of the Philippines") where he moved the location of the Code's origin from Negros to the [[Panay Island|Panay]] province of [[Aklan Province|Aklan]] because he suspected that it may be related to the [[Ati-atihan festival]]. Other authors throughout the 20th century gave credence to the story and the code.

In 1965, then [[University of Santo Tomas]] [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral candidate]] [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]] began an examination of prehispanic sources for the study of Philippine history. Scott eventually demonstrated that the code was a forgery committed by Marco. When Scott presented these conclusions in his doctoral dissertation, defended on 16 June 1968 before a panel of eminent Filipino historians which included [[Teodoro Agoncillo]], [[Horacio de la Costa]], [[Marcelino Foronda]], [[Mercedes Grau Santamaria]], [[Nicolas Zafra]] and [[Gregorio Zaide]], not a single question was raised about the chapter which he had called ''The Contributions of Jose E. Marco to Philippine historiography''.

Scott later published his findings debunking the code in his book ''Prehispanic Source Materials for the Study of Philippine History''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Scott|1992|pp=159–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filipino historians later removed the code from future literature regarding Philippine history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Scott|1984|pp=132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Antonio W. Molina]] published a Spanish version of his ''The Philippines Through the Centuries'' as ''Centuries as historia de Filipinas'' (Madrid, 1984), he replaced the Code with one sentence: "La tésis doctoral del historador Scott desbarate la existencia misma de dicho Código" (The doctoral dissertation of the historian Scott demolishes the very existence of the Code).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Scott|1992|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws of the Kalantiaw Code==
In his book, ''Struggle for Freedom'' (2008), Cecilio Duka provides a full reproduction of the code for the reader's "critical examination... to decide on its veracity and accuracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Duka|2008|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4wk8yqCEmJUC&amp;pg=PA25 25–27]}}, citing {{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Duka|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4wk8yqCEmJUC&amp;pg=PA25 25]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conservatism''' is a [[Political philosophy|political]] and [[social philosophy]] promoting traditional social institutions in the context of [[culture]] and [[civilization]]. The central tenets of conservatism include tradition, human imperfection, [[organic society]], hierarchy, authority, and [[property rights]].{{sfn|Heywood|2012|p=68}} Conservatives seek to preserve a range of institutions such as [[monarchy]], religion, [[parliamentary government]], and property rights, with the aim of emphasizing social stability and continuity.{{sfn|Heywood|2012|p=69}} The more extreme elements—[[reactionaries]]—oppose [[modernism]] and seek a return to "the way things were".&lt;ref&gt;Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan, "Conservatism", ''Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'', Third Edition, "Sometimes it (conservatism) has been outright opposition, based on an existing model of society that is considered right for all time. It can take a 'reactionary' form, harking back to, and attempting to reconstruct, forms of society which existed in an earlier period", Oxford University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-19-920516-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/133435/conservatism|title=Conservatism (political philosophy)|publisher=Britannica.com}} Retrieved on 1 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first established use of the term in a political context originated in 1818 with [[François-René de Chateaubriand]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerry Z. Muller|title=Conservatism: An Anthology of Social and Political Thought from David Hume to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9F7i5u4sOtgC&amp;pg=PA26|year=1997|publisher=Princeton U.P.|page=26|quote=Terms related to 'conservative' first found their way into political discourse in the title of the French weekly journal, ''Le Conservateur'', founded in 1818 by François-René de Chateaubriand with the aid of Louis de Bonald.|isbn=0691037116}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the period of [[Bourbon Restoration]] that sought to roll back the policies of the [[French Revolution]]. Historically associated with [[right-wing politics]], the term has since been used to describe [[#Forms|a wide range of views]]. There is no single set of policies regarded as conservative because the meaning of conservatism depends on what is considered traditional in a given place and time. Thus conservatives from different parts of the world—each upholding their respective traditions—may disagree on a wide range of issues. [[Edmund Burke]], an 18th-century politician who opposed the French Revolution but supported the [[American Revolution]], is credited as one of the main theorists of [[conservatism in the United Kingdom|conservatism in Great Britain in the 1790s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank O'Gorman|title=Edmund Burke: His Political Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-reNJAnv1oC&amp;pg=PA171|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|page=171|isbn=9780415326841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg]], the chairman of the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in 1959: "Conservatism is not so much a philosophy as an attitude, a constant force, performing a timeless function in the development of a free society, and corresponding to a deep and permanent requirement of human nature itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Quintin Hogg Baron Hailsham of St. Marylebone|title=The Conservative Case|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22+attitude,+a+constant+force,+performing+a+timeless+function+in+the+development+of+a+free+society,+and+corresponding+to+a+deep+and+permanent+requirement+of+human+nature+itself%22&amp;num=10|year=1959|publisher=Penguin Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the tradition-based definition of conservatism, some political theorists such as [[Corey Robin]] define conservatism primarily in terms of a general defense of [[Social inequality|social]] and [[economic inequality]]. From this perspective, conservatism is less an attempt to uphold traditional institutions and more, "a meditation on — and theoretical rendition of — the felt experience of having power, seeing it threatened, and trying to win it back".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/15/what-does-conservatism-stand-for|title=What does conservatism stand for?|last=Rooksby|first=Ed|date=15 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Conservative-Mind/130199/|title=The Conservative Mind|last=Robin|first=Corey|date=8 January 2012|work=|newspaper=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liberal conservatism ===
{{Main|Liberal conservatism}}
[[Liberal conservatism]] incorporates the [[classical liberal]] view of minimal government intervention in the economy. Individuals should be free to participate in the market and generate wealth without government interference.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} However, individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life, therefore liberal conservatives believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order and social institutions are needed to nurture a sense of duty and responsibility to the nation.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} Liberal conservatism is a variant of conservatism that is strongly influenced by [[Liberalism|liberal]] stances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGNRRwkZFysC&amp;pg=PA109|title=Analyzing Politics|last=Grigsby|first=Ellen|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2008|isbn=978-0-495-50112-1|location=|pages=108–09, 112, 347|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As these latter two terms have had different meanings over time and across countries, liberal conservatism also has a wide variety of meanings. Historically, the term often referred to the combination of [[economic liberalism]], which champions ''[[laissez-faire]]'' markets, with the classical conservatism concern for established [[tradition]], respect for authority and religious values. It contrasted itself with [[classical liberalism]], which supported [[freedom for the individual]] in both the economic and social spheres.

Over time, the general conservative ideology in many countries adopted economic liberal arguments and the term liberal conservatism was replaced with conservatism. This is also the case in countries where liberal economic ideas have been the tradition such as the United States and are thus considered conservative. In other countries where liberal conservative movements have entered the political mainstream, such as [[Italy]] and [[Spain]], the terms liberal and conservative may be synonymous. The liberal conservative tradition in the United States combines the economic [[individualism]] of the classical liberals with a [[Burkean]] form of conservatism (which has also become part of the [[American conservative]] tradition, such as in the writings of [[Russell Kirk]]).

A secondary meaning for the term liberal conservatism that has developed in [[Europe]] is a combination of more modern conservative (less traditionalist) views with those of [[social liberalism]]. This has developed as an opposition to the more [[collectivist]] views of [[socialism]]. Often this involves stressing what are now conservative views of [[free market]] economics and belief in individual responsibility, with social liberal views on defence of [[civil rights]], [[environmentalism]] and support for a limited [[welfare state]]. In continental Europe, this is sometimes also translated into English as social conservatism.

[[Conservative liberalism]] is a variant of liberalism that combines liberal values and policies with conservative stances, or more simply the right-wing of the liberal movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.ipolitique.fr/liberalisme-conservateur.htm Ipolitique.fr] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319053712/http://www.ipolitique.fr/liberalisme-conservateur.htm |date=March 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parties-and-elections.de/contents.html|title=parties-and-elections.de|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mair"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Representative Government in Europe|last=Gallagher|first=M.|last2=Laver|first2=M.|last3=Mair|first3=P.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=221|quote=|author-link=Michael Gallagher (academic)|author-link3=Peter Mair|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of conservative liberalism are found at the beginning of the [[History of liberal thought|history of liberalism]]. Until the two [[World Wars]], in most European countries the political class was formed by conservative liberals, from Germany to Italy. Events after [[World War I]] brought the more radical version of classical liberalism to a more conservative (i.e. more moderate) type of liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Liberalism|last=Allen|first=R.T.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=13|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Libertarian conservatism ===
{{Main|Libertarian conservatism}}
[[Libertarian conservatism]] describes certain political ideologies within the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] which combine [[libertarian]] economic issues with aspects of conservatism. Its four main branches are [[constitutionalism]], [[paleolibertarianism]], [[American conservatism|small government conservatism]] and [[Christian libertarianism]]. They generally differ from [[Paleoconservatism|paleoconservatives]], in that they are in favor of more [[liberty|personal]] and [[economic freedom]].

[[Agorist]]s such as [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]] labeled libertarian conservatism [[right-libertarianism]].&lt;ref name="nlm"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Libertarian Manifesto |url=http://agorism.info/NewLibertarianManifesto.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223021118/http://www.agorism.info/NewLibertarianManifesto.pdf |archivedate=February 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="int"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview With Samuel Edward Konkin III|url=http://www.spaz.org/~dan/individualist-anarchist/software/konkin-interview.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to paleoconservatives, libertarian conservatives support strict ''laissez-faire'' policies such as [[free trade]], opposition to any national bank and opposition to [[regulations|business regulations]]. They are vehemently opposed to [[environmental regulation]]s, [[corporate welfare]], [[subsidies]] and other areas of economic intervention.

Many conservatives, especially in the United States, believe that the government should not play a major role in regulating business and managing the economy. They typically oppose efforts to charge high tax rates and to redistribute income to assist the poor. Such efforts, they argue, do not properly reward people who have earned their money through hard work.

=== Fiscal conservatism ===
{{Main|Fiscal conservatism}}
[[File:TeaPartyByFreedomFan.JPG|thumb|[[Taxpayer March on Washington]], as conservative protesters walk down [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]], Washington, D.C., in 2009]]
[[Fiscal conservatism]] is the economic philosophy of prudence in government spending and debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B10JkvO82x8C&amp;pg=PA109|title=Correctional Organization and Management: Public Policy Challenges, Behavior, and Structure|first=Robert M.|last=Freeman|publisher=Elsevier|year=1999|page=109|isbn=978-0-7506-9897-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'', Edmund Burke argued that a government does not have the right to run up large debts and then throw the burden on the taxpayer: &lt;blockquote&gt;[I]t is to the property of the citizen, and not to the demands of the creditor of the state, that the first and original faith of civil society is pledged. The claim of the citizen is prior in time, paramount in title, superior in equity. The fortunes of individuals, whether possessed by acquisition or by descent or in virtue of a participation in the goods of some community, were no part of the creditor's security, expressed or implied...[T]he public, whether represented by a monarch or by a senate, can pledge nothing but the public estate; and it can have no public estate except in what it derives from a just and proportioned imposition upon the citizens at large.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[National conservatism]] is a political term used primarily in Europe to describe a variant of conservatism which concentrates more on national interests than standard conservatism as well as upholding cultural and ethnic identity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary Of Public Administration|last=Mandal|first=V.C.|year=2007|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|location=|isbn=978-81-7625-784-8|page=306|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Hs0xJORVIHwC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;cd=8&amp;q=%22National%20conservatism%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while not being outspokenly [[Nationalism|nationalist]] or supporting a [[Far-right politics|far-right]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Jason (August 23, 2016).

National conservatism is heavily oriented towards the traditional [[family]] and social stability as well as in favour of limiting [[immigration]]. As such, national conservatives can be distinguished from economic conservatives, for whom free market economic policies, [[deregulation]] and fiscal conservatism are the main priorities. Some commentators have identified a growing gap between national and economic conservatism: "[M]ost parties of the Right [today] are run by economic conservatives who, in varying degrees, have marginalized social, cultural, and national conservatives".&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n12_v49/ai_19559422 National questions – conservatives fragmenting as liberals unite]{{dead link|date=January 2016}}, National Review, June 30, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; National conservatism is also related to [[traditionalist conservatism]].

Traditionalist conservatism is a political philosophy emphasizing the need for the principles of [[natural law]] and transcendent moral order, [[tradition]], [[hierarchy]] and [[organic unity]], [[agrarianism]], [[classicism]] and [[high culture]] as well as the intersecting spheres of loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson, ed. (2006) ''American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia'' Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, pp. 870–75&lt;/ref&gt; Some traditionalists have embraced the labels "[[reactionary]]" and "[[counterrevolution]]ary", defying the stigma that has attached to these terms since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Having a hierarchical view of society, many traditionalist conservatives, including a few Americans, defend the [[monarchy|monarchical]] political structure as the most natural and beneficial social arrangement.

=== Cultural and social conservatism ===
{{Main|Cultural conservatism|social conservatism}}
[[Cultural conservative]]s support the preservation of the heritage of one nation, or of a shared culture that is not defined by national boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RbwDNb5jtzUC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Cultural Conservatism, Political Liberalism: From Criticism to Cultural Studies |first=James |last=Seaton |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-472-10645-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shared culture may be as divergent as [[Western culture]] or [[Chinese culture]]. In the United States, the term cultural conservative may imply a conservative position in the [[culture war]]. Cultural conservatives hold fast to traditional ways of thinking even in the face of monumental change. They believe strongly in traditional values and traditional politics and often have an urgent sense of nationalism.

[[Social conservatism]] is distinct from cultural conservatism, although there are some overlaps. Social conservatives may believe that society is built upon a fragile network of relationships which need to be upheld through duty, traditional values and established institutions;{{sfn|Heywood|2017|p=69}} and that the government has a role in encouraging or enforcing traditional values or behaviours. A social conservative wants to preserve traditional morality and social mores, often by opposing what they consider radical policies or [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]]. Social change is generally regarded as suspect.

A second meaning of the term social conservatism developed in the [[Nordic countries]] and [[continental Europe]], where it refers to liberal conservatives supporting modern [[European welfare state]]s.

Social conservatives (in the first meaning of the word) in many countries generally favour the [[pro-life]] position in the [[abortion controversy]] and oppose human [[embryonic stem cell]] research (particularly if publicly funded); oppose both [[eugenics]] and [[human enhancement]] ([[transhumanism]]) while supporting [[bioconservatism]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utne.com/2005-01-01/TheNextDigitalDivide.aspx?page=2 The Next Digital Divide] (utne article)&lt;/ref&gt; support a traditional definition of marriage as being one man and one woman; view the [[nuclear family]] model as society's foundational unit; oppose expansion of [[civil marriage]] and [[child adoption]] to couples in [[same-sex relationship]]s; promote [[public morality]] and traditional [[family values]]; oppose [[atheism]],&lt;ref&gt;"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots.

Most conservatives in the United States support the [[death penalty]].

=== Religious conservatism {{anchor|Religious conservatism}}===
{{See also|Christian right|Religious fundamentalism}}
[[File:Marche pour la vie 2012 - 6.jpg|thumb|[[March for Life (Paris)|March for Life]] in Paris, France in 2012]]
Religious conservatism principally apply the teachings of particular religions to politics, sometimes by merely proclaiming the value of those teachings, at other times by having those teachings influence laws.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Margaret L., Taylor, Howard Francis. [https://books.google.com/books?id=LP9bIrZ9xacC&amp;pg=PA469 ''Sociology: Understanding a Diverse Society''] Cengage Learning, 4th Ed. (2005), pp. 469–70.  {{ISBN|978-0-534-61716-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most democracies, political conservatism seeks to uphold traditional family structures and social values. Religious conservatives typically oppose abortion, homosexual behavior, drug use&lt;ref&gt;"So Christians do not approve of the taking of illegal drugs, including most recreational drugs, especially those which can alter the mind and make people incapable of praying or being alert to God." http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/sanctity/chdrugsrev2.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; and sexual activity outside of marriage. In some cases, conservative values are grounded in religious beliefs and conservatives seek to increase the role of religion in public life.&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, David L. (2005). "Genesis and Family Values". ''Journal of Biblical Literature''. '''124''' (1).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paternalistic conservatism ===
{{Main|Paternalistic conservatism}}
Paternalistic conservatism is a strand in conservatism which reflects the belief that societies exist and develop organically and that members within them have obligations towards each other.{{sfn|Heywood|2013|p=34}} There is particular emphasis on the [[Noblesse oblige|paternalistic obligation]] of those who are [[Social privilege|privileged]] and [[wealth]]y to the [[Poverty|poorer parts of society]]. Since it is consistent with principles such as [[Organic unity|organicism]], [[hierarchy]] and [[duty]], it can be seen an outgrowth of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditional conservatism]]. Paternal conservatives support neither the [[individual]] nor the [[State (polity)|state]] in principle, but are instead prepared to support either or recommend a balance between the two depending on what is most practical.{{sfn|Heywood|2012|p=80}}

It stresses the importance of a [[social safety net]] to deal with [[poverty]], support of limited [[redistribution of wealth]] along with government regulation to regulate markets in the interests of both consumers and producers.&lt;ref name="Patrick Dunleavy 2000. pp. 107–08"&gt;Patrick Dunleavy, Paul Joseph Kelly, Michael Moran. ''British Political Science: Fifty Years of Political Studies''. Oxford, England, UK; Malden, Massachusetts, US: Wiley-Blackwell, 2000. pp. 107–08&lt;/ref&gt; Paternalistic conservatism first arose as a distinct ideology in the [[United Kingdom]] under Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]]'s "[[One nation conservatism|One Nation]]" [[Toryism]].&lt;ref name="Patrick Dunleavy 2000. pp. 107–08"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Blake. Disraeli. Second Edition. London, England, UK: Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode (Publishers) Ltd, 1967. p. 524&lt;/ref&gt; There have been a variety of one nation conservative governments.

The Tory Party: its policies, divisions and future. Penguin, 1978. p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; were one nation conservatives.

In [[Germany]], during the 19th-century [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] adopted policies of state-organized compulsory insurance for workers against sickness, accident, incapacity and old age. Chancellor [[Leo von Caprivi]] promoted a conservative agenda called the "New Course".&lt;ref&gt;John Alden Nichols. ''Germany after Bismarck, the Caprivi era, 1890–1894: Issue 5''. Harvard University Press, 1958. p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the administration of President [[William Howard Taft]] was a progressive conservative and he described himself as "a believer in progressive conservatism"&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Lurie. William Howard Taft: The Travails of a Progressive Conservative. New York, New York, US: Cambridge University Press, 2012. p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; and President [[Dwight D.

Kutler, ''Eisenhower: a centenary assessment''. p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Canada]], a variety of conservative governments have been part of the [[Red tory]] tradition, with Canada's former major conservative party being named the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] from 1942 to 2003.&lt;ref name="Hugh Segal 2011. pp. 113–48"&gt;Hugh Segal.

=== Authoritarian conservatism ===
{{Main|Far-right politics}}
[[Authoritarian conservatism]] refers to autocratic regimes that center their ideology around conservative nationalism rather than [[ethnic nationalism]], though certain racial components such as [[antisemitism]] may exist.&lt;ref&gt;Michael H. Kater. Never Sang for Hitler: The Life and Times of Lotte Lehmann, 1888–1976. Cambridge University Press, 2008. p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Authoritarian conservative movements show strong devotion towards religion, tradition and culture while also expressing fervent nationalism akin to other far-right nationalist movements. Examples of authoritarian conservative leaders include [[António de Oliveira Salazar]]&lt;ref&gt;Howard J. Wiarda, Margaret MacLeish Mott. Catholic Roots and Democratic Flowers: Political Systems in Spain and Portugal. Westport, CT: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Engelbert Dollfuss]].&lt;ref&gt;Günter J. Bischof, Anton Pelinka, Alexander Lassner. The Dollfuss/Schuschnigg Era in Austria: A Reassessment. Piscataway, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2001. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Authoritarian conservative movements were prominent in the same era as [[fascism]], with which it sometimes clashed. Although both ideologies shared core values such as nationalism and had common enemies such as [[communism]] and [[materialism]], there was nonetheless a contrast between the traditionalist nature of authoritarian conservatism and the revolutionary, [[Palingenetic ultranationalism|palingenetic]] and populist nature of fascism—thus it was common for authoritarian conservative regimes to suppress rising fascist and [[National Socialism (disambiguation)|National Socialist movements]].&lt;ref&gt;Cyprian Blamires. World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2006. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The hostility between the two ideologies is highlighted by the struggle for power for the [[Austrian National Socialism|National Socialists]] in Austria, which was marked by the assassination of [[Engelbert Dollfuss]].

Sociologist [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] has examined the class basis of right-wing extremist politics in the 1920–1960 era. He reports:
: Conservative or rightist extremist movements have arisen at different periods in modern history, ranging from the [[Miklós Horthy|Horthyites]] in Hungary, the [[Engelbert Dollfuss|Christian Social Party of Dollfuss in Austria]], the [[Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Stahlhelm]] and other nationalists in pre-Hitler Germany, and [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar in Portugal]], to the pre-1966 Gaullist movements and the monarchists in contemporary France and Italy. The right extremists are conservative, not revolutionary. They seek to change political institutions in order to preserve or restore cultural and economic ones, while extremists of the centre and left seek to use political means for cultural and social revolution. The ideal of the right extremist is not a totalitarian ruler, but a monarch, or a traditionalist who acts like one. Many such movements in Spain,  Austria, Hungary, Germany, and Italy-have been explicitly monarchist....The supporters of these movements differ from those of the centrists, tending to be wealthier, and more religious, which is more important in terms of a potential for mass support.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour M. Lipset, "Social Stratification and 'Right-Wing Extremism'" ''British Journal of Sociology'' 10#4 (1959), pp. 346-382 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/587800 on-line]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Development of Western conservatism ===
==== United Kingdom ====
{{Main|Conservatism in the United Kingdom}}
{{Toryism|Related}}
In Great Britain, conservative ideas (though not yet called that) emerged in the [[Tory]] movement during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period (1660–1688). Toryism supported a hierarchical society with a monarch who ruled by [[Divine right of kings|divine right]]. [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]] opposed the idea that sovereignty derived from the people and rejected the authority of parliament and freedom of religion. [[Robert Filmer]]'s ''Patriarcha: or the Natural Power of Kings'' (published posthumously in 1680, but written before the [[English Civil War]] of 1642–1651) became accepted as the statement of their doctrine. However, the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 destroyed this principle to some degree by establishing a constitutional government in England, leading to the hegemony of the Tory-opposed [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] ideology. Faced with defeat, the Tories reformed their movement, now holding that sovereignty was vested in the three estates of Crown, Lords and Commons&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=ix, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than solely in the Crown. Toryism became marginalized during the long period of Whig ascendancy in the 18th century.

[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edmund Burke]] (1729–1797)]]
Conservatives typically see [[Richard Hooker]] (1554–1600) as the founding father of conservatism, along with the [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|Marquess of Halifax]] (1633–1695), [[David Hume]] (1711–1776) and [[Edmund Burke]] (1729–1797). Halifax promoted pragmatism in government whilst Hume argued against political rationalism and utopianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Muller|editor1-first=Jerry Z.|title=Conservatism: an anthology of social and political thought from David Hume to the present|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolin|first1=Sheldon S.|title=Hume and Conservatism|journal=American Political Science Review|date=2 September 2013|volume=48|issue=4|pages=999–1016|doi=10.2307/1951007|jstor=1951007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke served as the private secretary to the [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Marquis of Rockingham]] and as official pamphleteer to the [[Rockingham Whigs|Rockingham branch of the Whig party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Edmund Burke: selected writings and speeches|last=Stanlis|first=Peter J.|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]]|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=18|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the Tories, they were the conservatives in the late 18th century United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Morton Auerbach|title=The Conservative Illusion|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AuerbachMMorton-1959?View=FindIt|publisher=Columbia University Press (1959)|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke's views were a mixture of liberal and conservative. He supported the [[American Revolution]] of 1765–1783, but abhorred the violence of the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799). He accepted the liberal ideals of private property and the economics of [[Adam Smith]] (1723–1790), but thought that economics should remain subordinate to the conservative social ethic, that capitalism should be subordinate to the medieval social tradition and that the business class should be subordinate to [[aristocracy]]. He insisted on standards of honor derived from the medieval aristocratic tradition and saw the aristocracy as the nation's natural leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|first=|publisher=|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=37–40|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That meant limits on the powers of the Crown, since he found the institutions of Parliament to be better informed than commissions appointed by the executive. He favored an [[established church]], but allowed for a degree of [[religious toleration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|first=|publisher=|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=52–54|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke justified the social order on the basis of tradition: tradition represented the wisdom of the species and he valued community and social harmony over social reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|first=|publisher=|year=1959|isbn=|location=|page=41|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke was a leading theorist in his day, finding extreme idealism (either Tory or Whig) an endangerment to broader liberties and (like Hume) rejecting abstract reason as an unsound guide for political theory. Despite their influence on future conservative thought, none of these early contributors were explicitly involved in Tory politics. Hooker lived in the 16th century, long before the advent of [[toryism]], whilst Hume was an apolitical philosopher and Halifax similarly politically independent. Burke described himself as a Whig.

===== Revival =====
Shortly after Burke's death in 1797, conservatism revived as a mainstream political force as the Whigs suffered a series of internal divisions. This new generation of conservatives derived their politics not from Burke but from his predecessor, the [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Viscount Bolingbroke]] (1678–1751), who was a Jacobite and traditional Tory, lacking Burke's sympathies for Whiggish policies such as [[Catholic emancipation]] and [[American Revolution|American independence]] (famously attacked by [[Samuel Johnson]] in "Taxation No Tyranny"). In the first half of the 19th century, many newspapers, magazines and journals promoted loyalist or right-wing attitudes in religion, politics and international affairs. Burke was seldom mentioned, but [[William Pitt the Younger]] (1759–1806) became a conspicuous hero. The most prominent journals included ''The Quarterly Review'', founded in 1809 as a counterweight to the Whigs' ''Edinburgh Review'' and the even more conservative ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine''. Sack finds that the ''Quarterly Review'' promoted a balanced Canningite toryism as it was neutral on Catholic emancipation and only mildly critical of Nonconformist Dissent; it opposed slavery and supported the current poor laws; and it was "aggressively imperialist". The [[high-church]] clergy of the Church of England read the ''[[Orthodox Churchman's Magazine]]'' which was equally hostile to Jewish, Catholic, [[Jacobin]], [[Methodist]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] spokesmen. Anchoring the ultra Tories, ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'' stood firmly against Catholic emancipation and favoured slavery, cheap money, mercantilism, the [[Navigation Acts]] and the [[Holy Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sack|first=J. J.|year=1987|title=The Memory of Burke and the Memory of Pitt: English Conservatism Confronts Its Past, 1806–1829|url=|journal=The Historical Journal|volume=30|issue=3|pages=623–40|jstor=2639162|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservatism evolved after 1820, embracing free trade in 1846 and a commitment to democracy, especially under Disraeli. The effect was to significantly strengthen conservatism as a grassroots political force. Conservatism no longer was the philosophical defense of the landed aristocracy, but had been refreshed into redefining its commitment to the ideals of order, both secular and religious, expanding imperialism, strengthened monarchy and a more generous vision of the welfare state as opposed to the punitive vision of the Whigs and liberals.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Claeys, "Political Thought," in Chris Williams, ed., ''A Companion to 19th-Century Britain'' (2006). p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1835, Disraeli attacked the Whigs and utilitarians as slavishly devoted to an industrial oligarchy, while he described his fellow Tories as the only "really democratic party of England" and devoted to the interests of the whole people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Richmond|author2=Paul Smith|title=The Self-Fashioning of Disraeli, 1818–1851|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnF3IRJbKR8C&amp;pg=PA162|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=162|isbn=9780521497299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, inside the party there was a tension between the growing numbers of wealthy businessmen on the one side and the aristocracy and rural gentry on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|first=|publisher=|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=39–40|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aristocracy gained strength as businessmen discovered they could use their wealth to buy a peerage and a country estate.

Although conservatives opposed attempts to allow greater representation of the middle class in parliament, they conceded that [[electoral reform]] could not be reversed and promised to support further reforms so long as they did not erode the institutions of church and state. These new principles were presented in the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] of 1834, which historians regard as the basic statement of the beliefs of the new Conservative Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robert Peel Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Robert Peel]] (1788–1850)]]
Some conservatives lamented the passing of a pastoral world where the ethos of ''[[noblesse oblige]]'' had promoted respect from the lower classes. They saw the [[Anglican Church]] and the aristocracy as balances against commercial wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worked toward legislation for improved working conditions and urban housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; This viewpoint would later be called [[Tory democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since Burke there has always been tension between traditional aristocratic conservatism and the wealthy business class.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834, Tory [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Peel]] issued the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] in which he pledged to endorse moderate political reform. This marked the beginning of the transformation of British conservatism from [[High Tory]] reactionism towards a more modern form based on "conservation". The party became known as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] as a result, a name it has retained to this day. However, Peel would also be the root of a split in the party between the traditional Tories (led by the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli]]) and the "Peelites" (led first by Peel himself, then by the [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Earl of Aberdeen]]). The split occurred in 1846 over the issue of [[free trade]], which Peel supported, versus [[protectionism]], supported by Derby. The majority of the party sided with Derby whilst about a third split away, eventually merging with the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] and the [[radicalism (politics)|radicals]] to form the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. Despite the split, the mainstream Conservative Party accepted the doctrine of free trade in 1852.

In the second half of the 19th century, the Liberal Party faced political schisms, especially over [[History of Ireland|Irish]] [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Home Rule]]. Leader [[William Gladstone]] (himself a former Peelite) sought to give Ireland a degree of autonomy, a move that elements in both the left and right-wings of his party opposed. These split off to become the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]] (led by [[Joseph Chamberlain]]), forming a coalition with the Conservatives before merging with them in 1912. The Liberal Unionist influence dragged the Conservative Party towards the left as Conservative governments passing a number of progressive reforms at the turn of the 20th century. By the late 19th century, the traditional business supporters of the Liberal Party had joined the Conservatives, making them the party of [[business]] and [[commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=|last=Feuchtwanger|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=273|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a period of Liberal dominance before the [[First World War]], the Conservatives gradually became more influential in government, regaining full control of the cabinet in 1922. In the interwar period, conservatism was the major ideology in Britain&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Ball, "Baldwin, Stanley, first Earl Baldwin of Bewdley (1867–1947)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross McKibbin, ''Parties and people: England, 1914–1951'' (Oxford, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garside, W.R.; Greaves, J.I. (1997). "Rationalisation and Britain's industrial Malaise: The interwar years revisited". ''Journal of European Economic History''. '''26''' (1): 37–68.&lt;/ref&gt; as the Liberal Party vied with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] for control of the left. After the [[Second World War]], the first Labour government (1945–1951) under [[Clement Attlee]] embarked on a program of nationalization of industry and the promotion of social welfare. The Conservatives generally accepted those policies until the 1980s.

[[File:Margaret Thatcher.png|thumb|upright|[[Margaret Thatcher]] (1925–2013), during her leadership the Conservative Party has shifted their economic policies to the right, as well as [[Thatcherism]].]]
In the 1980s, the Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]], guided by [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economics, reversed many of Labour's programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics|last=McLean|first=Iain|last2=McMillan|first2=Laistair|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=|isbn=978-0-19-920516-5|location=|page=364|quote=In the developed world neoliberalism is often coupled with Thatcherism [...].|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative Party also adopt [[soft euroscepticism|soft eurosceptic]] politics, and oppose [[Federal Europe]]. Other conservative political parties, such as the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP, founded in 1993), [[Northern Ireland]]'s [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) and the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP, founded in 1971), began to appear, although they have yet to make any significant impact at Westminster ({{as of |2014 |lc = on}}, the DUP comprises the largest political party in the ruling coalition in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]), and since 2017 the DUP has provided support for the Conservative [[Second May ministry|minority government]].

==== France ====
[[File:Jmaistre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph de Maistre]] (1753–1821)]]
Another form of conservatism developed in France in parallel to conservatism in Britain. It was influenced by [[Counter-Enlightenment]] works by men such as [[Joseph de Maistre]] and [[Louis de Bonald]]. Latin conservatism was less pragmatic and more [[reactionary]] than the conservatism of Burke.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Many continental or traditionalist conservatives do not support [[separation of church and state]], with most supporting state recognition of and cooperation with the [[Catholic Church in France|Catholic Church]], such as had existed in France before the Revolution.

Eventually, conservatives added [[Gaullism]], [[patriotism]], and [[nationalism]] to the list of traditional values they support. Conservatives were the first to embrace nationalism, which was previously associated with [[liberalism]] and the Revolution in France.&lt;ref&gt;ams, Ian Political Ideology Today (2nd edition), Manchester University Press, 2002, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Germany ====
{{Main|Conservatism in Germany}}
Conservatism developed alongside nationalism in Germany, culminating in Germany's victory over France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the creation of the unified [[German Empire]] in 1871 and the simultaneous rise of [[Otto von Bismarck]] on the European political stage. Bismarck's "balance of power" model maintained peace in Europe for decades at the end of the 19th century. His "revolutionary conservatism" was a conservative state-building strategy designed to make ordinary Germans—not just the Junker elite—more loyal to state and emperor, he created the modern welfare state in Germany in the 1880s. According to Kees van Kersbergen and Barbara Vis, his strategy was: {{Quote|[G]ranting social rights to enhance the integration of a hierarchical society, to forge a bond between workers and the state so as to strengthen the latter, to maintain traditional relations of authority between social and status groups, and to provide a countervailing power against the modernist forces of liberalism and socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kersbergen|first1=Kees van|last2=Vis|first2=Barbara|title=Comparative Welfare State Politics: Development, Opportunities, and Reform|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQL3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38|year=2013|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=38|isbn=9781107652477}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Bismarck also enacted universal male suffrage in the new German Empire in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=Robert Laurence|last2=Vaudagna|first2=Maurizio|title=The American Century in Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PeoqKSxiOu4C&amp;pg=PA226|year=2003|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=226|isbn=0801440750}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a great hero to German conservatives, who erected many monuments to his memory after he left office in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frankel|first=Richard|date=|year=2003|title=From the Beer Halls to the Halls of Power: The Cult of Bismarck and the Legitimization of a New German Right, 1898–1945|url=|journal=German Studies Review|volume=26|issue=3|pages=543–60|doi=10.2307/1432746|jstor=1432746|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of [[Nazism]] in 1933, [[agrarianism|agrarian movements]] faded and was supplanted by a more command-based economy and forced social integration. Though [[Adolf Hitler]] succeeded in garnering the support of many German industrialists, prominent traditionalists openly and secretly opposed his policies of euthanasia, genocide and attacks on organized religion, including [[Claus von Stauffenberg]], [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], [[Henning von Tresckow]], Bishop [[Clemens August Graf von Galen]] and the monarchist [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler]].

More recently, the work of conservative [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] leader and Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] helped bring about [[German reunification]], along with the closer integration of Europe in the form of the [[Maastricht Treaty]].

Three conservative leaders in the EPP included [[Prime Minister of Spain]] [[Mariano Rajoy]] (2011-18), [[Chancellor of Germany]] [[Angela Merkel]] and [[Prime Minister of Hungary]] [[Viktor Orbán]].]]
Today, German conservatism is often associated with politicians such as Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]], whose tenure has been marked by attempts to save the common European currency ([[Euro]]) from demise. The German conservatives are divided under Merkel due to the refugee crisis in Germany and many conservatives in the [[CDU/CSU]] oppose the refugee and migrant policies developed under Merkel.

==== United States ====
{{Main|Conservatism in the United States}}
American conservatism is a broad system of political beliefs in the [[United States]] that is characterized by respect for American traditions, support for [[Judeo-Christian ethics|Judeo-Christian]] values, [[economic liberalism]], [[anti-communism]] and a defense of [[Western culture]]. [[Liberty]] within the bounds of conformity to Conservatism is a core value, with a particular emphasis on strengthening the [[free market]], limiting the size and scope of government and opposition to high taxes and government or labor union encroachment on the entrepreneur.

The major conservative party in the United States is the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], also known as the GOP (Grand Old Party). American conservatives consider [[individualism|individual liberty]] as long as it conforms to Conservative values, [[small government]], [[deregulation]] of the government, [[economic liberalism]] and [[free trade]], as the fundamental traits of democracy, which contrasts with [[Modern Liberalism in the United States|modern American liberals]], who generally place a greater value on [[social equality]] and [[social justice]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory L. Schneider, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IVD3z0PuTRQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Conservative Century: From Reaction to Revolution]'' "The label (conservatism) is in frequent use and has come to stand for a skepticism, at times an outright hostility, toward government social policies; a muscular foreign policy combined with a patriotic nationalism; a defense of traditional Christian religious values; and support for the free market economic system.", "Within the conservative disposition in America there are inherent contradictions between supporters of social order and tradition and supporters of individual freedom.", (2009) pp. 4–9, 136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood Thompson, ''Encyclopedia of Diversity and Social Justice''  p. 7: "Historically...social justice became associated with liberalism in which equality is the ideal.", Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2014, {{ISBN|978-1442216044}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historic conservatism in different countries ===
{{Further|Right-wing politics|Political spectrum}}
Conservative political parties vary widely from country to country in the goals they wish to achieve. Both conservative and liberal parties tend to favor private ownership of property, in opposition to communist, socialist and green parties, which favor communal ownership or laws requiring social responsibility on the part of property owners. Where conservatives and liberals differ is primarily on social issues. Conservatives tend to reject behavior that does not [[conformity|conform]] to some [[social norm]]. Modern conservative parties often define themselves by their opposition to liberal or labor parties. The United States usage of the term "conservative" is unique to that country.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Alan. ''Political Parties and Party Systems''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-19-878076-2}}, pp. 31–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Alan Ware, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom retained viable conservative parties into the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Alan. ''Political Parties and Party Systems''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-19-878076-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ware said that Australia, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malta, New Zealand, Spain and the United States had no conservative parties, although they had either Christian democrats or liberals as major right-wing parties. Canada, Ireland and Portugal had right-wing political parties that defied categorization: the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]]; [[Fianna Fáil]], [[Fine Gael]] and [[Progressive Democrats]] in Ireland; and the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party of Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Alan. ''Political Parties and Party Systems''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-19-878076-2}}, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the [[Swiss People's Party]] has moved to the extreme right and is no longer considered to be conservative.&lt;ref&gt;Flecker, Jörg. ''Changing working life and the appeal of the extreme right''. Hampshire, UK: Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-7546-4915-1}}, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Klaus von Beyme]], who developed the method of party categorization, found that no modern Eastern European parties could be considered conservative, although the communist and communist-successor parties had strong similarities.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Paul G. ''Political parties in post-communist Eastern Europe''. Routledge, 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-415-20182-7}} pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, which was united by liberals and radicals (''[[Risorgimento]]''), liberals not conservatives emerged as the party of the right.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Denis Mack. ''Modern Italy: a political history''.  University of Michigan Press, 1997. {{ISBN|978-0-472-10895-4}} p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; In the Netherlands, conservatives merged into a new Christian democratic party in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Daalder, Hans and Irwin, Galen A. ''Politics in the Netherlands: how much change?'' Routledge, 1989. {{ISBN|0-7146-3361-5}} pp. 154–57&lt;/ref&gt; In Austria, Germany, Portugal and Spain, conservatism was transformed into and incorporated into fascism or the [[Far-right politics|far-right]].&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn, Martin. ''Fascists and conservatives''. Routledge, 1990.  p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, all Japanese parties were merged into a single fascist party.

New York: Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-8264-1521-9}} pp. 262–263.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis Hartz]] explained the absence of conservatism in Australia or the United States as a result of their settlement as radical or liberal fragments of Great Britain. Although he said English Canada had a negligible conservative influence, subsequent writers claimed that [[United Empire Loyalist|loyalists]] opposed to the American Revolution brought a Tory ideology into Canada. Hartz explained conservatism in Quebec and Latin America as a result of their settlement as feudal societies.&lt;ref&gt;Fierlbeck, Katherine. ''Political thought in Canada: an intellectual history''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-55111-711-9}} pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt; The American conservative writer [[Russell Kirk]] provided the opinion that conservatism had been brought to the United States and interpreted the American Revolution as a "conservative revolution".&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, Russell. ''The Conservative Mind''. Washington, DC: Regnery Publishing, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-89526-171-7}}, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-89526-171-7}} pp. 6, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative elites have long dominated Latin American nations. Mostly, this has been achieved through control of and support for civil institutions, the church and the armed forces, rather than through party politics. Typically, the church was exempt from taxes and its employees immune from civil prosecution. Where national conservative parties were weak or non-existent, conservatives were more likely to rely on military dictatorship as a preferred form of government. However, in some nations where the elites were able to mobilize popular support for conservative parties, longer periods of political stability were achieved. Chile, Colombia and Venezuela are examples of nations that developed strong conservative parties. Argentina, Brazil, El Salvador and Peru are examples of nations where this did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Middlebrook, Kevin J. ''Conservative parties, the right, and democracy in Latin America''. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000 {{ISBN|978-0-8018-6386-8}} pp. 1–52.&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative Party of Venezuela disappeared following the [[Federal War]]s of 1858–1863.&lt;ref&gt;Peeler, John A. ''Latin American Democracies: Colombia, Costa Rica, Venezuela''. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1985. p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Chile's conservative party, the [[National Party (Chile, 1966–1973)|National Party]], disbanded in 1973 following a military coup and did not re-emerge as a political force following the subsequent return to democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheim, Lois Hecht.

==== Belgium ====
Having its roots in the conservative [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Party]], the [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Christian People's Party]], retained a conservative edge through the twentieth century, supporting the king in the [[Royal Question]], supporting [[nuclear family]] as the cornerstone of society, defending Christian education and opposing [[euthanasia]]. The Christian People's Party dominated politics in post-war Belgium. In 1999, the party's support collapsed and it became the country's fifth largest party.&lt;ref&gt;Annesley, Claire.

==== Canada ====
{{Main|Conservatism in Canada}}
Canada's conservatives had their roots in the loyalists Tories who left America after the American Revolution. They developed in the socio-economic and political cleavages that existed during the first three decades of the 19th century and had the support of the business, professional and established Church (Anglican) elites in Ontario and to a lesser extent in Quebec. Holding a monopoly over administrative and judicial offices, they were called the "[[Family Compact]]" in Ontario and the "[[Chateau Clique]]" in Quebec. [[John A. Macdonald]]'s successful leadership of the movement to confederate the provinces and his subsequent tenure as prime minister for most of the late 19th century rested on his ability to bring together the English-speaking Protestant oligarchy and the [[ultramontane]] Catholic hierarchy of Quebec and to keep them united in a conservative coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Kornberg, Allan and Mishler, William. ''Influence in Parliament, Canada''. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1976. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservatives combined [[Economic liberalism|pro-market liberalism]] and [[Toryism]]. They generally supported an activist government and state intervention in the marketplace and their policies were marked by ''[[noblesse oblige]]'', a paternalistic responsibility of the elites for the less well-off.&lt;ref&gt;Schultze, Rainer-Olaf; Sturm, Roland and Eberle, Dagmar.

Germany: VS Verlag, 2003. {{ISBN|978-3-8100-3812-8}} p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; From 1942, the party was known as the Progressive Conservatives until 2003, when the national party merged with the [[Canadian Alliance]] to form the [[Conservative Party of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Panizza, Francisco. ''Populism and the mirror of democracy''. London: Verso, 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-85984-489-2}} p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservative [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] governed the province of Quebec in periods from 1936 to 1960 and in a close alliance with English Canadian business elites and the Catholic Church. This period, known as the [[Grande Noirceur|Great Darkness]], ended with the [[Quiet Revolution]] and the party went into terminal decline.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, John Frederick.

The modern [[Conservative Party of Canada]] has rebranded conservatism and under the leadership of [[Stephen Harper]], the Conservative Party add more conservative policies.

==== Colombia ====
{{Main|Conservatism in Colombia}}
The [[Colombian Conservative Party]], founded in 1849, traces its origins to opponents of General [[Francisco de Paula Santander]]'s 1833–1837 administration. While the term "liberal" had been used to describe all political forces in Colombia, the conservatives began describing themselves as "conservative liberals" and their opponents as "red liberals". From the 1860s until the present, the party has supported strong central government; supported the Catholic Church, especially its role as protector of the sanctity of the family; and opposed separation of church and state. Its policies include the legal equality of all men, the citizen's right to own property and opposition to dictatorship. It has usually been Colombia's second largest party, with the [[Colombian Liberal Party]] being the largest.&lt;ref&gt;Osterling, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Denmark ====
Founded in 1915, the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party of Denmark]]. was the successor of ''Højre'' (literally "[[Right-wing politics|Right"]]). The conservative party led the government coalition from 1982 to 1993. The party was a junior partner in coalition with the [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberals]] from 2001 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Annesley, Claire. ''A political and economic dictionary of Western Europe''. London: Routledge, 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-85743-214-5}}, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; The party is preceded by 11 years by the [[Young Conservatives (Denmark)|Young Conservatives (KU)]], today the youth movement of the party. The party suffered a major defeat in the parliamentary elections of September 2011 in which the party lost more than half of its seat and also lost governmental power. A liberal cultural policy dominated during the postwar period. However, by the 1990s disagreements regarding immigrants from entirely different cultures ignited a conservative backlash.&lt;ref&gt;Kasper Støvring,  "The Turn from Cultural Radicalism to National Conservatism: Cultural Policy in Denmark."

==== Finland ====
The conservative party in Finland is the [[National Coalition Party]] (in Finnish ''Kansallinen Kokoomus'', ''Kok''). The party was founded in 1918 when several monarchist parties united. Although in the past the party was right-wing, today it is a moderate liberal conservative party. While the party advocates [[economic liberalism]], it is committed to the [[social market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Siaroff, Alan.

Following the Second World War, conservatives in France supported Gaullist groups and have been nationalistic and emphasized tradition, order and the regeneration of France.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Vinen, "The Parti républicain de la Liberté and the Reconstruction of French Conservatism, 1944–1951," ''French History'' (1993) 7#2 pp. 183–204&lt;/ref&gt; Gaullists held divergent views on social issues. The number of conservative groups, their lack of stability and their tendency to be identified with local issues defy simple categorization. Conservatism has been the major political force in France since the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Viereck, Peter and Ryn, Claes G.

==== Greece ====
The main interwar conservative party was called the [[People's Party (Greece)|People's Party]] (PP), which supported [[Greek monarchy|constitutional monarchy]] and opposed the [[Second Hellenic Republic|republican]] [[Liberal Party (Greece)|Liberal Party]]. Both it and the Liberal party were suppressed by the authoritarian, arch-conservative and royalist [[4th of August Regime]] of [[Ioannis Metaxas]] in 1936–1941. The PP was able to re-group after the Second World War as part of a United Nationalist Front which achieved power campaigning on a simple anticommunist, ultranationalist platform during the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946–1949). However, the vote received by the PP declined during the so-called "Centrist Interlude" in 1950–1952. In 1952, Marshal [[Alexandros Papagos]] created the [[Greek Rally]] as an umbrella for the right-wing forces. The Greek Rally came to power in 1952 and remained the leading party in Greece until 1963—after Papagos' death in 1955 reformed as the [[National Radical Union]] under [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]]. Right-wing governments backed by the palace and the army overthrew the [[Centre Union]] government in 1965 and governed the country until the establishment of the far-right [[Regime of the Colonels]] (1967–1974). After the [[metapolitefsi|regime's collapse]] in August 1974, Karamanlis returned from exile to lead the government and founded the [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party. The new conservative party had four objectives: to confront [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish expansionism in Cyprus]], to reestablish and solidify democratic rule, to give the country a strong government and to make a powerful moderate party a force in Greek politics.&lt;ref&gt;Penniman, Howard Rae. ''Greece at the polls: the national elections of 1974 and 1977''.  Washington: American Enterprise Institute, 1981. {{ISBN|978-0-8447-3434-7}} pp. 49–59&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Independent Greeks]], a newly formed political party in [[Greece]], has also supported conservatism, particularly [[National conservatism|national]] and [[religious conservatism]]. The Founding Declaration of the Independent Greeks strongly emphasises in the preservation of the Greek state and its [[sovereignty]], the [[Greek people]] and the [[Greek Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://anexartitoiellines.gr/files/idritiki%20diakirixi.pdf Founding Declaration of Independent Greeks]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Iceland ====
Founded in 1924 as the [[Conservative Party (Iceland)|Conservative Party]], Iceland's [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]] adopted its current name in 1929 after the merger with the [[Liberal Party (Iceland, historical)|Liberal Party]]. From the beginning, they have been the largest vote-winning party, averaging around 40%. They combined liberalism and conservatism, supported nationalization of infrastructure and opposed class conflict. While mostly in opposition during the 1930s, they embraced [[economic liberalism]], but accepted the welfare state after the war and participated in governments supportive of state intervention and protectionism. Unlike other Scandanivian conservative (and liberal) parties, it has always had a large working-class following.&lt;ref&gt;Grofman, Bernard and Lijpart, Arend, editors. ''The evolution of electoral and party systems in the Nordic countries''. New York: Agathon Press, 2002. "The Icelandic electoral system 1844–1999" by Olafur Th. Hardarson {{ISBN|978-0-87586-138-8}}, pp. 107–08&lt;/ref&gt; After the financial crisis in 2008, the party has sunk to a lower support level around 20–25%.

==== Italy ====
After World War II, in [[Italy]] the conservative parties were mainly represented by the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] (DC) party, which government form the foundation of the Republic until party's dissolution in 1994. Officially, DC refused the ideology of conservatism, but in many aspects, for example [[family values]], it was a typical [[social conservative]] party.

In 1994, the media tycoon and entrepreneur [[Silvio Berlusconi]] founded the [[liberal conservative]] party [[Forza Italia]] (FI). Berlusconi won three elections in [[Italian general election, 1994|1994]], [[Italian general election, 2001|2001]] and [[Italian general election, 2008|2008]], governing the country for almost ten years as [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]]. Forza Italia formed a coalition with right-wing regional party [[Lega Nord]] while in government.

Besides FI, now the conservative ideas are mainly expressed by the [[New Centre-Right]] party led by [[Angelino Alfano]], Berlusconi form a new party, which is the reborn [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] founding a new conservative movement. Alfano was the current [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs|Minister of Foreign Affairs]]. After the [[Italian general election, 2018|2018 election]], [[Lega Nord]] and the [[Five Star Movement]] formed the [[right-wing populist]] government.

==== Luxembourg ====
Luxembourg's major [[Christian democratic]] conservative party, the [[Christian Social People's Party]] (CSV or PCS), was formed as the Party of the Right in 1914 and adopted its present name in 1945. It was consistently the largest political party in Luxembourg and dominated politics throughout the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Urwin, Derek W. ''A Dictionary of European History and Politics, 1945–1995''. London: Pearson UK, 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-582-25874-7}} p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Norway ====
The [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party of Norway]] (Norwegian: Høyre, literally "[[Right-wing politics|right"]]) was formed by the old upper class of state officials and wealthy merchants to fight the populist democracy of the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]], but lost power in 1884 when parliamentarian government was first practised. It formed its first government under parliamentarism in 1889 and continued to alternate in power with the Liberals until the 1930s, when Labour became the dominant political party. It has elements both of paternalism, stressing the responsibilities of the state and of economic liberalism. It first returned to power in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Knut Heidar|Heidar, Knut]].

==== Sweden ====
Sweden's conservative party, the [[Moderate Party]], was formed in 1904, two years after the founding of the liberal party.&lt;ref&gt;Grofman, Bernard and Lijpart, Arend, editors. ''The evolution of electoral and party systems in the Nordic countries''. New York: Agathon Press, 2002. "The Icelandic electoral system 1844–1999" by Olafur Th. Hardarson {{ISBN|978-0-87586-138-8}}, pp. 107–235&lt;/ref&gt;  The party emphasizes tax reductions, deregulation of private enterprise and privatization of schools, hospitals and kindergartens.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Clive S.

==== Switzerland ====
There are a number of conservative parties in Switzerland's parliament, the Federal Assembly. These include the largest, the [[Swiss People's Party]] (SVP),&lt;ref name="Hans-Georg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ziebertz|first=Hans-Georg|title=How Teachers in Europe Teach Religion: An International Empirical Study: An International Empirical Study in 16 Countries|year=2011|publisher=Lit Verlag|isbn=978-3-643-10043-6|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland|Christian Democratic People's Party]] (CVP)&lt;ref name=Juravich&gt;{{cite book|last=Juravich|first=Tom|title=Ravenswood: The Steelworkers' Victory and the Revival of American Labor|year=2000|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8666-1|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Conservative Democratic Party of Switzerland]] (BDP),&lt;ref name=Schwok&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwok|first=René|title=Switzerland – European Union: An Impossible Membership?|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-90-5201-576-7|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a splinter of the SVP created in the aftermath to the election of Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf as Federal Council.&lt;ref name="Schwok"/&gt; The right-wing parties have a majority in the Federal Assembly.

The [[Swiss People's Party]] (SVP or UDC) was formed from the 1971 merger of the [[Party of Farmers, Traders and Independents|Party of Farmers, Traders and Citizens]], formed in 1917 and the smaller Swiss Democratic Party, formed in 1942. The SVP emphasized agricultural policy and was strong among farmers in German-speaking Protestant areas. As Switzerland considered closer relations with the European Union in the 1990s, the SVP adopted a more militant protectionist and isolationist stance. This stance has allowed it to expand into German-speaking Catholic mountainous areas.&lt;ref&gt;Siaroff, Alan ''Comparative European Party Systems''. New York: Garland, 2000. {{ISBN|0-8153-2930-X}} p. 446&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Defamation League]], a non-Swiss lobby group based in the United States has accused them of manipulating issues such as immigration, Swiss neutrality and welfare benefits, awakening antisemitism and racism.&lt;ref&gt;The Stephen Roth Institute. ''Anti-semitism worldwide'' Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2002 {{ISBN|0-8032-5943-3}} p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Council of Europe]] has called the SVP "extreme right", although some scholars dispute this classification. For instance, Hans-Georg Betz describes it as "populist radical right".&lt;ref&gt;Hainsworth, pp. 44, 74&lt;/ref&gt; The SVP is the largest party since 2003.

==== United Kingdom ====
{{Main|Conservatism in the United Kingdom}}
According to historian James Sack, English conservatives celebrate [[Edmund Burke]] as their intellectual father.&lt;ref&gt;James J. Sack, "The Memory of Burke and the Memory of Pitt; English Conservatism Confronts its Past, 1806–1829" (1987) 623–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke was affiliated with the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig Party]] which eventually became the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], but the modern [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] is generally thought to derive from the [[Tories (British political party)|Tory party]] and the MPs of the modern conservative party are still frequently referred to as Tories.

=== Modern conservatism in different countries ===
While conservatism has been seen as an appeal to traditional, hierarchical society, some writers such as [[Samuel P. Huntington]] see it as situational. Under this definition, conservatives are seen as defending the established institutions of their time.&lt;ref&gt;Winthrop and Lovell, pp. 163–66&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Australia ====
{{Main|Conservatism in Australia}}
The [[Liberal Party of Australia]] adheres to the principles of [[social conservatism]] and [[liberal conservatism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dennis Raphael|title=Tackling Health Inequalities: Lessons from International Experiences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zjh4lQAbPrYC&amp;pg=PA66|year=2012|publisher=Canadian Scholars’ Press|isbn=978-1-55130-412-0|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is liberal in the sense of economics. Other conservative parties are the [[National Party of Australia]], a sister party of the Liberals, [[Family First Party]], [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|Democratic Labor Party]], [[Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party]], [[Australian Conservatives]] and the [[Katter's Australian Party]].

The second largest party in the country is the [[Australian Labor Party]] and its dominant faction is [[Labor Right]], a [[socially conservative]] element. Australia undertook significant economic reform under the Labor Party in the mid-1980s. Consequently, issues like protectionism, welfare reform, privatization and deregulation are no longer debated in the political space as they are in Europe or North America. Moser and Catley explain: "In America, 'liberal' means left-of-center, and it is a pejorative term when used by conservatives in adversarial political debate. In Australia, of course, the conservatives are in the Liberal Party".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Mosler|author2=Robert Catley|title=America and Americans in Australia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YungugjvIaQC&amp;pg=PA83|year=1998|page=83|isbn=9780275962524}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jupp points out that, "[the] decline in English influences on Australian reformism and radicalism, and appropriation of the symbols of Empire by conservatives continued under the Liberal Party leadership of Sir [[Robert Menzies]], which lasted until 1966".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Jupp|title=The English in Australia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n63TaXC5TpEC&amp;pg=PA172|year=2004|page=172|isbn=9780521542951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Brazil ====
[[File:Federal Deputy Jair Bolsonaro at the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jair Bolsonaro]], the President-elect of Brazil, known for his conservative stances.]]
Conservatism in Brazil originates from the cultural and historical tradition of Brazil, whose cultural roots are Luso-Iberian and [[Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freyre|first=Gilberto|date=1943|title=Em Torno Do Problema De Uma Cultura Brasileira|jstor=2103064|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|volume=4|issue=2|pages=167–171|doi=10.2307/2103064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazilian conservatism from the 20th century on includes names such as Gerardo Melo Mourão and [[Otto Maria Carpeaux]] in literature; Oliveira Lima and Oliveira Torres in historiography; [[Sobral Pinto]] and [[Miguel Reale]] in law; [[Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira]] and [[Father Paulo Ricardo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://padrepauloricardo.org/episodios/o-minimo-que-voce-precisa-saber-para-nao-ser-um-idiota|title=O mínimo que você precisa saber para não ser um idiota|last=|first=|date=|website=Padre Paulo Ricardo|language=pt|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Catholic Church; [[Roberto de Oliveira Campos|Roberto Campos]] and Mario Henrique Simonsen in economics; [[Carlos Lacerda]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/ha-100-anos-nascia-carlos-lacerda-o-maior-inimigo-de-vargas,14718e1da3fa5410VgnVCM4000009bcceb0aRCRD.html|title=Há 100 anos nascia Carlos Lacerda, o maior inimigo de Vargas|last=|first=|date=April 29, 2017|website=Terra|language=pt|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the political arena; and [[Olavo de Carvalho]] in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/opiniao/colunistas/bruno-garschagen/historia-e-tradicao-do-conservadorismo-brasileiro-8qlhl00pnfgvr3cb27qln44gp|title=História e tradição do conservadorismo brasileiro|last=Garschagen|first=Bruno|date=|website=Gazeta do Povo|language=pt|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brazilian Labour Renewal Party]], [[Patriota]], [[Progressistas]], [[Social Christian Party (Brazil)|Social Christian Party]] and [[Social Liberal Party (Brazil)|Social Liberal Party]] are the conservative parties in Brazil.

==== India ====
In India, [[Narendra Modi]] and his [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) represent conservative politics. The BJP is the largest right-wing conservative party. It promotes [[Hindu nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Abhilasha Kumari|author2=Sabina Kidwai|title=Crossing the Sacred Line: Women's Search for Political Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=urvvwXU_ZQkC&amp;pg=PA83|year=1998|publisher=Orient Blackswan|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Russia ====
Under [[Vladimir Putin]], the dominant leader since 1999, Russia has promoted explicitly conservative policies in social, cultural and political matters, both at home and abroad. Putin has attacked globalism and economic liberalism. Putin has promoted new think tanks that bring together like-minded intellectuals and writers. For example, the Izborsky Club, founded in 2012 by Aleksandr Prokhanov, stresses Russian nationalism, the restoration of Russia's historical greatness and systematic opposition to liberal ideas and policies.&lt;ref&gt;Marlene Laruelle, "The Izborsky Club, or the New Conservative Avant‐Garde in Russia." ''Russian Review'' 75.4 (2016): 626–44.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vladislav Surkov]], a senior government official, has been one of the key ideologists during Putin's presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Sirke Mäkinen,  "Surkovian narrative on the future of Russia: making Russia a world leader." ''Journal of Communist Studies and Transition Politics'' 27#2 (2011): 143–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cultural and social affairs, Putin has collaborated closely with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. Mark Woods provides specific examples of how the Church under [[Patriarch Kirill of Moscow]] has backed the expansion of Russian power into Crimea and eastern Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Woods, "How the Russian Orthodox Church is backing Vladimir Putin's new world order" [http://www.christiantoday.com/article/how.the.russian.orthodox.church.is.backing.vladimir.putins.new.world.order/81108.htm  ''Christian Today'' March 3, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, ''The New York Times'' reports in September 2016 how that Church's policy prescriptions support the Kremlin's appeal to social conservatives:
: A fervent foe of homosexuality and any attempt to put individual rights above those of family, community or nation, the Russian Orthodox Church helps project Russia as the natural ally of all those who pine for a more secure, illiberal world free from the tradition-crushing rush of globalization, multiculturalism and women’s and gay rights.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Higgins, "In Expanding Russian Influence, Faith Combines With Firepower," [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/world/europe/russia-orthodox-church.html ''New York Times'' Sept 13, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== South Korea ====
{{Main|Conservatism in South Korea}}
[[South Korea]]'s major conservative party, the [[Liberty Korea Party]], has changed its form throughout its history. First it was the Democratic-Republican Party (1963–1980) and its head was [[Park Chung-hee]], who seized power in a 1961 military coup d'état and ruled as an unelected military strongman until his formal election as President in [[South Korean presidential election, 1963|1963]]. He was President for 16 years until his assassination on 26 October 1979. The [[Democratic Justice Party]] inherited the same ideology as the Democratic-Republican Party. Its head, [[Chun Doo-hwan]], also gained power through a coup and his followers called themselves the Hanahae. The Democratic Justice Party changed its form and acted to suppress the opposition party and to follow the people's demand for direct elections. The party's [[Roh Tae-woo]] became the first President who was elected through direct election. The next form of the major conservative party was the Democratic-Liberal Party and again through election its second leader, [[Kim Young-sam]], became the fourteenth President of Korea. When the conservative party was beaten by the opposition party in the general election, it changed its form again to follow the party members' demand for reforms. It became the New Korean Party, but it changed again one year later since the President Kim Young-sam was blamed by the citizen for the [[International Monetary Fund]].{{clarify|date=March 2014}} It changed its name to Grand National Party (GNP). Since the late [[Kim Dae-jung]] assumed the presidency in 1998, GNP had been the opposition party until [[Lee Myung-bak]] won the presidential election of [[South Korean presidential election, 2007|2007]].

==== United States ====
{{Main|Conservatism in the United States}}
[[File:President Reagan speaking in Minneapolis 1982.jpg|thumb|[[President of the United States]] [[Ronald Reagan]] (1981-1989). His [[Reagan Doctrine]] has reshaped the Republican Party.]]
The meaning of "conservatism" in the United States has little in common with the way the word is used elsewhere. As Ribuffo (2011) notes, "what Americans now call conservatism much of the world calls liberalism or neoliberalism".&lt;ref&gt;Leo P. Ribuffo, "20 Suggestions for Studying the Right now that Studying the Right is Trendy," ''Historically Speaking'' Jan 2011 v.12#1 pp. 2–6, quote on p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1950s, conservatism in the United States has been chiefly associated with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. However, during the era of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] many [[Southern Democrats]] were conservatives and they played a key role in the [[Conservative coalition]] that largely controlled domestic policy in Congress from 1937 to 1963,&lt;ref&gt;Kari Frederickson, ''The Dixicrat Revolt and the End of the Solid South, 1932–1968'', p. 12, "...conservative southern Democrats viewed warily the potential of New Deal programs to threaten the region's economic dependence on cheap labor while stirring the democratic ambitions of the disfranchised and undermining white supremacy.", The University of North Carolina Press, 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-8078-4910-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Conservative Democrat]]s continued to have influence in the U.S. politics until 1994's [[Republican Revolution]], when the American South shifted from solid Democrat to solid Republican, while maintaining its conservative values.

Major priorities within American conservatism include support for the [[traditional family]], [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]], the [[right to bear arms]]. [[Christian values]], [[anti-communism]] and a defense of "[[Western civilization]] from the challenges of modernist culture and totalitarian governments".&lt;ref name="GregorySchneider"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Conservative Century: From Reaction to Revolution|last=Schneider|first=Gregory|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|year=2009|isbn=|location=|page=xii|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic conservatives and libertarians favor [[small government]], low taxes, limited regulation and free enterprise.

The conservative movement of the 1950s attempted to bring together these divergent strands, stressing the need for unity to prevent the spread of "Godless communism", which Reagan later labeled an "[[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]]".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Edward Gottfried, ''Conservatism in America: Making Sense of the American Right'', p. 9, "Postwar conservatives set about creating their own synthesis of free-market capitalism, Christian morality, and the global struggle against Communism." (2009); Gottfried, ''Theologies and moral concern'' (1995) p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Reagan administration]], conservatives also supported the so-called "[[Reagan Doctrine]]" under which the U.S. as part of a Cold War strategy provided military and other support to guerrilla insurgencies that were fighting governments identified as socialist or communist. The Reagan administration also adopted [[Neoliberalism]] and [[trickle-down economics]], as well as [[Reaganomics]], which made for economic growth in the 1980s, fueled by trillion dollar deficits.

Other modern conservative positions include opposition to [[big government]] and [[opposition to environmentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Jacques; Riley E. Dunlap; Mark Freeman, ''The organisation of denial: Conservative think tanks and environmental scepticism'', Environmental Politics. v12 m3 (2008), pp. 349–85&lt;/ref&gt; On average, American conservatives desire tougher foreign policies than liberals do.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=23736 Peter Hays Gries, ''The Politics of American Foreign Policy: How Ideology Divides Liberals and Conservatives over Foreign Affairs'' (Stanford, 2014).]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Economic liberalism]], [[deregulation]] and [[social conservatism]] are main principles of the Republican Party.

Most recently, the [[Tea Party movement]], founded in 2009, has proven a large outlet for populist American conservative ideas. Their stated goals include rigorous adherence to the U.S. Constitution, lower taxes and opposition to a growing role for the federal government in health care. Electorally, it was considered a key force in Republicans reclaiming control of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Theda Skocpol and Vanessa Williamson, ''The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism'' (2012) pp. 45–82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-12030-503544.html|title=Katie Couric Interviews Tea Party Leaders|date=25 January 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Biology and political orientation}}
Following the Second World War, psychologists conducted research into the different motives and tendencies that account for ideological differences between left and right. The early studies focused on conservatives, beginning with [[Theodor W. Adorno]]'s ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950) based on the [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]] personality test. This book has been heavily criticized on theoretical and methodological grounds, but some of its findings have been confirmed by further empirical research.&lt;ref name="Jost, J.J 2003"&gt;Jost, J.J, Glaser, J., Kruglanski, A.A., &amp; Sulloway, F.J. (2003). Political conservatism as motivated social cognition. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 129:(3), pp. 339–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, British psychologist [[Glenn Wilson (psychologist)|Glenn Wilson]] published an influential book providing evidence that a general factor underlying conservative beliefs is "fear of uncertainty".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, G.D. (Ed.)(1973) The Psychology of Conservatism, London: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis of research literature by Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski and Sulloway in 2003 found that many factors, such as [[Ambiguity tolerance|intolerance of ambiguity]] and need for [[Cognitive closure (psychology)|cognitive closure]], contribute to the degree of one's political conservatism.&lt;ref name="Jost, J.J 2003"/&gt; A study by Kathleen Maclay stated these traits "might be associated with such generally valued characteristics as personal commitment and unwavering loyalty". The research also suggested that while most people are resistant to change, liberals are more tolerant of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/07/22_politics.shtml|title=Researchers help define what makes a political conservative|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to psychologist [[Bob Altemeyer]], individuals who are politically conservative tend to rank high in [[right-wing authoritarianism]] (RWA) on his RWA scale.&lt;ref&gt;Altemeyer, B. (1981). Right-wing authoritarianism. Winnipeg, Canada: University of Manitoba Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This finding was echoed by [[Theodor Adorno]]. A study done on Israeli and Palestinian students in Israel found that RWA scores of right-wing party supporters were significantly higher than those of left-wing party supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubinstein|first1=G.|doi=10.1177/0022022196272005|title=Two Peoples in One Land: A Validation Study of Altemeyer's Right-Wing Authoritarianism Scale in the Palestinian and Jewish Societies in Israel|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|year=1996|volume=27|pages=216–230|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2005 study by H. Michael Crowson and colleagues suggested a moderate gap between RWA and other conservative positions: "The results indicated that conservatism is not synonymous with RWA".&lt;ref&gt;Crowson, H. Michael, Stephen J. Thoma, and Nita Hestevold. "Is political conservatism synonymous with authoritarianism?." ''The Journal of Social Psychology'' 145.5 (Oct 2005): 571(22). Expanded Academic ASAP. Gale. Remote Access. 20 May 2009 [http://find.galegroup.com/itx/start.do?prodId=EAIM Galegroup.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist Felicia Pratto and her colleagues have found evidence to support the idea that a high [[social dominance orientation]] (SDO) is strongly correlated with conservative political views and opposition to social engineering to promote equality,&lt;ref name="pratto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pratto|first1=Felicia|last2=Sidanius|first2=Jim|last3=Stallworth|first3=Lisa M.|last4=Malle|first4=Bertram F.|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.4.741|title=Social dominance orientation: A personality variable predicting social and political attitudes|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1994|volume=67|pages=741–763|issue=4|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3207711}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Pratto's findings have been highly controversial{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} as Pratto and her colleagues found that high SDO scores were highly correlated with measures of [[prejudice]]. However, [[David J. Schneider]] argued for a more complex relationships between the three factors, writing "correlations between prejudice and political conservative are reduced virtually to zero when controls for SDO are instituted, suggesting that the conservatism–prejudice link is caused by SDO".&lt;ref&gt;The psychology of stereotyping, David J. Schneider,  Guilford Press, 2005 {{ISBN|978-1-59385-193-4}}  p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Minogue]] criticized Pratto's work, saying: "It is characteristic of the conservative temperament to value established identities, to praise habit and to respect prejudice, not because it is irrational, but because such things anchor the darting impulses of human beings in solidities of custom which we do not often begin to value until we are already losing them. Radicalism often generates youth movements, while conservatism is a condition found among the mature, who have discovered what it is in life they most value".&lt;ref&gt;The Social science encyclopedia, Jessica Kuper, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1985 {{ISBN|978-0-7102-0008-2}} pp. 155–156.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1996 study on the relationship between racism and conservatism found that the correlation was stronger among more educated individuals, though "anti-Black affect had essentially no relationship with political conservatism at any level of educational or intellectual sophistication". They also found that the correlation between racism and conservatism could be entirely accounted for by their mutual relationship with social dominance orientation.&lt;ref name="sidanius96"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.3.476|last1=Sidanius|first1=J|last2=Pratto|first2=F|last3=Bobo|first3=L|year=1996|title=Racism, conservatism, affirmative action, and intellectual sophistication: A matter of principled conservatism or group dominance?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=70|issue=3|pages=476–490|url=http://www.scholar.harvard.edu/files/bobo/files/1996_racism_conservatism_affirmative_action_and_journal_of_personality_and_social_psychology.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 research report found that conservatives are happier than liberals and that—as income inequality increases—this difference in relative happiness increases because conservatives (more than liberals) possess an ideological buffer against the negative hedonic effects of [[economic inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Napier|first1=J.

"'''Dog Gone'''" is the eighth episode of the [[Family Guy (season 8)|eighth season]] of the [[animated cartoon|animated]] [[television comedy|comedy series]] ''[[Family Guy]]''. It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on November 29, 2009. The episode features [[Brian Griffin|Brian]], the family pet, attempting to prove that a dog's life is just as important as that of a human's, after he accidentally kills another dog with no consequences. Meanwhile, the [[Griffin family]] hires Consuela, a stereotypical Hispanic woman, as the [[maid|household maid]], which they each end up regretting once she takes advantage of the family's home.

First announced at the 2009 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], the episode was written by series showrunner [[Steve Callaghan]] and directed by [[Julius Wu]]. It received high praise from critics for its storyline and many cultural references, in addition to receiving some criticism from [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]].&lt;ref name="ignreview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/105/1050140p1.html |title=Family Guy: "Dog Gone" Review |publisher=IGN |author=Haque, Ahsan |accessdate=2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 8.48 million homes in its original airing.&lt;ref name="ratings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/11/30/tv-ratings-sunday-of-course-football-wins-fox-animation-bounces-back-as-abc-slumps/34749 |title=TV Ratings Sunday: Of Course Football Wins; Fox Animation Bounces Back; ABC Slumps |publisher=TVbytheNumbers |accessdate=2009-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202051753/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/11/30/tv-ratings-sunday-of-course-football-wins-fox-animation-bounces-back-as-abc-slumps/34749 |archivedate=2009-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode featured guest performances by [[Chris Matthews]], [[Nathan Gunn]], [[Eddie "Piolín" Sotelo|Eddie Sotelo]], [[Fred Tatasciore]] and Kel MacFarlane, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. "Dog Gone" was released on [[DVD]] along with seven other episodes from the season on June 15, 2010.

==Plot==
After much anticipation, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] receives an invitation to an award ceremony celebrating his novel, ''Faster Than the Speed of Love'',  by the Rhode Island Society for Special Literary Excellence. Convinced he is a great writer, Brian attempts to gain the family's interest but fails to do so. Once he arrives at the "award ceremony" however, he discovers that he has misunderstood the meaning of the word "[[developmental disability|special]]",  prompting him to drown his sorrows at the local bar and realize that he is not a writer, but a joke. He drives home drunk that night and accidentally [[roadkill|runs over and kills a dog]]. He secretly buries the dead dog's body outside the Griffins' home and tries to keep quiet about it. [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], having witnessed his deed, begins to toy with Brian's guilt, eventually driving him to a state where he decides to confess to "murder". However, when he confesses to [[Joe Swanson|Joe]] and the Griffin family, they all laugh, saying that no one cares if a dog or any other animal is killed, especially by another animal.&lt;ref name="ignpreview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/104/1049353p1.html |title=Family Guy Preview: "Dog Gone" |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="msnplot"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.msn.com/tv/episode/family-guy/dog-gone/?silentchk=1 |title=Family Guy – 'Dog Gone' Episode Info |publisher=[[MSN]] |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outraged, Brian starts a support group, and decides to call it "The Quahog Animal Equal Rights League", to convince the town that the lives of animals should be of equal value to humans'. As the town citizens learn more about it, however, none of them are keen on changing their lifestyles if it means no processed [[meat]]s and [[medical research]] on animals, and even become interested in how dogs taste after Brian mentions they are eaten in some cultures. Refusing to listen any further, they chase after Brian in an attempt to eat him.

Brian realizes that if no one cares about the lives of animals, then he is worthless to the Griffin family and everyone else. Stewie finds Brian crying in the bathtub, and, seeing how upset Brian is and feeling sorry for him, Stewie successfully fakes his death by putting his collar (which Brian hadn't been wearing) on a stray and killing it in a [[liquor store]] fire. The Griffins are devastated upon learning about Brian's supposed death, and realize how close a friend he was to them. Seeing this, Stewie rushes upstairs to show Brian how much the Griffins still care about him, regardless of his species. Brian then realizes his life does have a purpose and thanks Stewie for helping him, and decides to remain hidden to let the Griffins grieve a little longer.

Meanwhile, [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] accidentally knocks over a carton of [[Kool-Aid]] mix on the kitchen floor of the Griffin's house and leaves [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] to take the blame. Frustrated with having to clean Peter's messes, [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] hires a Hispanic maid named Consuela to clean their house. But Consuela quickly proves to be very stubborn, refusing to leave after her work hours and sleeping at the Griffins' house overnight, much to Peter and Lois' annoyance. They try to fire her and even bribe her to leave, but she still refuses (though she takes the money they offer her anyway). In a last-ditch attempt, Peter finally gets rid of her by tricking her into inhaling [[chloroform]] on a handkerchief, and leaves her in a basket on Joe's front porch.

At the end, Peter lets us know that everyone at ''Family Guy'' respects all living beings and assures the viewers that no animals were harmed in the making of the episode, but they did hurt the feelings of an Italian opera singer by prematurely dropping the curtain on his performance.

First announced at the 2009 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]] on July 25, 2009, by future showrunner Steve Callaghan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MacFarlane revels in 'Family Guy' noms|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|author=Maxwell, Erin|date=July 25, 2009|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118006495.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1|accessdate=October 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 25, 2009|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2009/07/the-emmynominated-family-guy-and-the-abortion-episode-you-wont-see.html|author=Phillips, Jevon|title=The Emmy-nominated 'Family Guy' and the abortion episode you will not see|accessdate=October 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the episode was directed by series regular, and former ''[[King of the Hill]]'' and ''[[The Oblongs]]'' director, [[Julius Wu]], and written by Callaghan&lt;ref name="yahoocast"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tv.yahoo.com/family-guy/show/dog-gone/episode/223904/castcrew |title=Family Guy&amp;nbsp;— Dog Gone&amp;nbsp;— Cast and Crew |publisher=[[Yahoo!]] |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the conclusion of the [[Family Guy (season 8)|eighth production season]]. The episode saw the reintroduction of the recurring character Consuela, a Hispanic maid whose first appearance was in the [[Family Guy (season 6)|sixth season]] episode "[[Believe It or Not, Joe's Walking on Air]]".

"Dog Gone", along with seven other episodes from ''Family Guy''{{'}}s eighth season, was released on a three-disc [[DVD]] set in the United States on June 15, 2010. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Seth MacFarlane and various crew and cast members for several episodes,&lt;ref name="DVDs8"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Family-Guy-Volume-8/13518 |title=Family Guy – This Just In: Volume 8 DVD Announced to Retailers, with Complete Details |accessdate=2010-04-03 |publisher=TVShowsonDVD.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329203405/http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/Family-Guy-Volume-8/13518 |archivedate=2010-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of deleted scenes, a special mini-feature which discussed the process behind animating "[[Road to the Multiverse]]", and a mini-feature entitled ''Family Guy'' Karaoke.

In addition to the regular cast, anchor and [[Pundit (expert)|political commentator]] [[Chris Matthews]], voice actor [[Fred Tatasciore]], opera singer [[Nathan Gunn]], radio personality [[Eddie "Piolín" Sotelo|Eddie Sotelo]] and Kel MacFarlane, webmaster of the [[Seth MacFarlane]] fan site, guest starred in the episode.&lt;ref name="yahoocast"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimescast"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.nytimes.com/episode/97534/Family-Guy/overview |title=Family Guy&amp;nbsp;— Dog Gone, Full Episode Cast |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |accessdate=2009-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315233933/http://tv.nytimes.com/episode/97534/Family-Guy/overview |archivedate=2012-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recurring guest voice actors [[Ralph Garman]], writer John Viener, writer [[Mark Hentemann]], actress [[Alexandra Breckenridge]], writer [[Alec Sulkin]] and writer [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]] also made minor appearances.&lt;ref name="yahoocast"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimescast"/&gt;

==Cultural references==
In the opening scene of the episode, Stewie is seen going through Brian's internet history, which includes [[Egosurfing|searches about himself]] on the internet search engine [[Google]]. Later, after going to the bar to drink, Brian talks to Bill, the father from ''[[The Family Circus]]'' [[print syndication|syndicated]] comic strip. After Bill tells him he should have tried harder on writing his book, Brian responds by yelling that all Bill does is "judge" other people, and demands for him to go home and "[[fuck]] [his] wife in the face", to which Bill agrees. This is also later recognized by Peter the next day, when he is seen reading [[comic strip|the funnies]], and murmurs to himself, "this is a very shocking ''Family Circus''."&lt;ref name="ignreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tvcritic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetvcritic.org/dog-gone/ |title=The TV Critic.org&amp;nbsp;— Episode 8 – Dog Gone Review |publisher=The TV Critic.org |accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chris Matthews.jpg|left|thumb|upright|200px|alt=A man with yellow hair wearing a formal tie and suit, smiles with a series of red and white decorations behind him.|News anchor [[Chris Matthews]] made his first guest appearance in the series.]]
News anchor and political commentator Chris Matthews' show entitled ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'' is referenced by Stewie when he suggests Brian is getting a big head, with the guest, [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Harry Reid]], then appearing on Matthews' forehead, suggesting Matthews is self-centered. After Reid continues to interrupt him, however, Matthews cuts to actor [[Kurtwood Smith]], in which Matthews appears on Smith's forehead instead.&lt;ref name="ignreview"/&gt;

Once Consuela is hired as the family maid, she first begins to annoy Peter by listening to stereotypical [[Latin American music|Latin music]] played loudly on a portable radio, in which the singer repeats the Spanish phrase "¡Muchos horn-os!" which literally translates to "many ovens" but within the context of the show is actually meant to be [[Spanglish]] for "many horns." In Consuela's final appearance in the episode, she is seen watching a commercial, which parodies local commercials urging viewers to hire a lawyer if they are in a car accident.&lt;ref name="tvsquad"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2009/11/30/sundays-with-seth-the-best-little-dry-cleaners-in-virginia/ |title=Sundays With Seth: The best little dry cleaners in Virginia |author=Hughes, Jason |publisher=TV Squad |accessdate=2009-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to try to prove that an animal has the same rights as humans, Brian starts an advocacy group, and is suggested by Lois to join [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]], but she is unable to enunciate the word differently from how she pronounces "Peter," leading her husband to become confused. The end of the gag has Chris stating his belief that [[Betty White]] is a member of the organization, with his wording prompting Peter to yell, "That doesn't even make sense!" &lt;ref name="ignreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="peta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.peta.org/archives/2009/11/family_guy.php |title=How Cutting-Edge, 'Family Guy' |publisher=PETA |author=Schinke, Amanda |accessdate=2009-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222073052/http://blog.peta.org/archives/2009/11/family_guy.php |archivedate=2009-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian goes on to create a public service announcement regarding animal rights, one of which involves a dog being "tortured" by having to listen to the radio show ''[[All Things Considered]]'' on [[National Public Radio]], which the dog's owner leaves on for him before leaving the house.&lt;ref name="peta"/&gt;

==Reception==
In an improvement over the previous four episodes, the episode was viewed in 8.48 million homes in its original airing, according to [[Nielsen ratings]], despite airing simultaneously with ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'', the television movie ''[[A Dog Named Christmas]]'' on [[CBS]] and ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The episode also acquired a 4.4 rating in the 18–49 demographic, beating ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'' and ''[[American Dad!]]'', but was ultimately edged out slightly by ''The Simpsons'' in total viewership.&lt;ref name="ratings"/&gt;

Reviews of the episode were highly positive, citing the Brian and Stewie storyline as a "solid attempt to tell a good story," and the Consuela scenes as "terrific." Ahsan Haque of [[IGN]] also noted that "the writers deserved some credit" for the episode, saying that, in comparison to past episodes the episode did not "come across as a haphazardly assembled string of {{interp|random}} jokes."&lt;ref name="ignreview"/&gt; Jason Hughes of [[TV Squad]] also found the Consuela scenes to be "hilarious," but found the final scene to be "strangely {{interp|...}} uncomfortable," expecting Meg to be pushed out of the family hug.&lt;ref name="tvsquad"/&gt; Todd VanDerWerff of [[The A.V. Club]] praised the handling of Brian's character in the episode, and called the Peter and PETA gag "pretty cheap, but quite funny," giving the episode a B rating overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/rednecks-and-broomsticksfrom-bed-to-worsedog-goneg,35810/|title="Rednecks and Broomsticks"/"From Bed to Worse"/"Dog Gone"/"G-String Circus"|publisher=[[The A.V. Club]]|author=VanDerWerff, Todd|date=November 30, 2009|accessdate=2009-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, for "rais[ing] public awareness of animal issues", "Dog Gone" won a [[Genesis Awards|Genesis Award]] for television comedy, winning over ''South Park'' episode '[[Whale Whores]]" and ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' episode "Mr. Monk and the Dog".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307122122/http://www.humanesociety.org/about/events/genesis_awards/nominees.html|archivedate=March 7, 2012 |url=http://www.humanesociety.org/about/events/genesis_awards/nominees.html|publisher=[[The Humane Society of the United States]]|title=Nominees for the Genesis Awards|accessdate=March 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a post on PETA's official blog, Amanda Schinke, however, was highly critical of the episode for its "myriad of violent deaths of cartoon dogs." In addition, she called for the show to "hire {{interp|writers}} who can generate material that doesn't make us roll our eyes."&lt;ref name="peta"/&gt;

'''''Fixing Sex: Intersex, Medical Authority, and Lived Experience''''', a book by Stanford [[anthropologist]] and [[bioethicist]] [[Katrina Karkazis]], was published in 2008. Described as "thoughtful", "meticulous", and an "authoritative treatise on intersex",&lt;ref name="scbe" /&gt; the book examines the perspectives of [[intersex]] people, their families, and clinicians to offer compassionate look at the treatment of people born with atypical sex characteristics.

==Synopsis==

In a scholarly work, Karkazis draws heavily on interviews with intersex adults, parents, and physicians to explore how intersex is understood and treated. In part 1, she reviews the history of treatment for intersex traits, highlighting the work of [[John Money]] and the introduction of the, then new, terms "gender", "gender role" and "gender identity". She explores the events following publication of [[Milton Diamond]]'s study of the [[David Reimer]] or "John/Joan" case, and the ways in which public opinion impacted on medical treatment. In part 2, Karkazis presents an analysis of current medical approaches to intersex, and the risks involved, in the wake of a 2006 "consensus statement on the management of intersex disorders".&lt;ref name="nejm" /&gt; She also reviews the methods utilised to assign a sex of rearing to intersex infants, such as genitals and penis size, chromosomes, fertility, "sexing of the brain", and parental wishes; these impact upon determination whether or not to proceed with early genital surgery.&lt;ref name="mijeon"&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2694968/ Fixing Sex: Intersex, Medical Authority, and Lived Experience], [[Claude Migeon]] in ''[[American Journal of Human Genetics]]'', June 12, 2009; 84(6): 718-727. DOI: 10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.04.022.&lt;/ref&gt; Part 3 interviews parents of children with [[complete androgen insensitivity syndrome]] and [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], and adults with intersex experiences. Part 3 also looks at activism by intersex [[List of intersex organizations|organizations]].

==Reception==

The book has been well received by both clinicians and intersex groups. Gary Berkovitz, writing in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] states that Karkazis's analysis is fair, compelling, and eloquent; "Current consensus guidelines recommend early separation of the vagina and urethra for female subjects with abnormalities in the formation of the sex organs... Karkazis presents a compelling argument for the deferment of subsequent surgery until the patient is able to decide."&lt;ref name="nejm"&gt;[http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMbkrev0805101 Fixing Sex: Intersex, Medical Authority, and Lived Experience], New England Journal of Medicine, April 16, 2009. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMbkrev0805101.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Reis, reviewing the book in [[American Journal of Bioethics]], states that the book identifies risk of incontinence, fistulas, scarring and lack of physical sensation arising from surgical intervention, and the psychological harm caused by the knowledge that "one's genitals are 'wrong,' requiring constant medical scrutiny and 'fixing'. It "masterfully examines the concerns and fears of all those with a stake in the intersex debate: physicians, parents, intersex adults, and activists. . . . Karkazis’s honest, multi-pronged approach poses critical questions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15265160902790617#.UruFq3lw1cc Review of Katrina Karkazis, Fixing Sex: Intersex, Medical Authority, and Lived Experience], Elizabeth Reis in [[American Journal of Bioethics]], Volume 9, issue 6, 2009. DOI:10.1080/15265160902790617&lt;/ref&gt; Mijeon in [[American Journal of Human Genetics]] writes that the "conclusion is quite fitting", "the history of thinking about the body ... can be highly politicized and controversial".&lt;ref name="mijeon" /&gt; Kenneth Copeland MD, former president of the [[Pediatric endocrinology|Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society]] describes the book as "Masterfully balancing all aspects of one of the most polarizing, contentious topics in medicine... the most recent authoritative treatise on intersex."&lt;ref name="scbe" /&gt;

[[Gayle Rubin]] describes the book as "meticulous, sensitive, and brilliantly executed".&lt;ref name="scbe"&gt;[http://bioethics.stanford.edu/people/resumes/karkazispubs.html Katrina Karkazis, PhD, MPH] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226191601/http://bioethics.stanford.edu/people/resumes/karkazispubs.html |date=2013-12-26 }}, [[Stanford University School of Medicine]] Center for Biomedical Ethics, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Arlene Baratz MD, ([[Accord Alliance]]) describes the book as "a velvet-gloved punch to the gut", "astonishing, a tale told straight from the mouths of affected adults, parents, and physicians in tender and lyrical prose."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kalahari.com/Books/Fixing-Sex_p_32893085;jsessionid=DC14247A5DEDB631E99E1210FBB6BFE4 Fixing Sex], Kalahari.com&lt;/ref&gt; Intersex community organization [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] regards the book as "approachable," "compelling and recommended reading".&lt;ref&gt;[http://oii.org.au/5849/fixing-sex-karkazis/ Katrina Karkazis, "Fixing Sex" (recommended reading)], [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]], 26 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was referenced by ''Involuntary or coerced sterilisation of intersex people in Australia,'' a 2013 report of a committee of the [[Senate of Australia]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="SenateOnSterilisation"&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Community_Affairs/Involuntary_Sterilisation/Sec_Report/index Involuntary or coerced sterilisation of intersex people in Australia], Community Affairs Committee, [[Senate of Australia]], October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==

The book was nominated for the Margaret Mead Award, 2010, and a finalist for the Lambda Literary Award, 2009.&lt;ref name="scbe" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8655">'''Fragmentarium''' (Digital Research Laboratory for Medieval Manuscript Fragments) is an online database to collect and collate fragments of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[manuscripts]] making them available to researchers, collectors and historians worldwide. It is an international collaboration of major libraries and collections including the [[British Library]], [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], [[Martin Schøyen Collection]], [[Bavarian State Library]], [[Harvard]], [[Yale]] and the [[Vatican Library|Vatican]].

==History==
The Fragmentarium project was first proposed in October 2013 and the first planning meeting took place in [[Cologny]] in 2014. It was supported initially by representatives of 12 institutions, its goal being to study the field of manuscript fragment research and look at worldwide cataloguing standards. Fragmentarium was officially launched on 1 September 2017, by the Medieval Institute of the University of Fribourg at [[Abbey Library of St. Gall]] in [[St. Gallen]], Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fragmentarium Launched|url=http://www.fragmentarium.unifr.ch/about/news|website=Fragmentarium|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Historians and librarians are now able to upload images to the Fragmentarium where they will be made available for research and encouraged to publish images under a [[Creative Commons]] [[public domain license]].&lt;ref name=bl2017&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dunning|first1=Andrew|title=Fragmentarium and the burnt Anglo-Saxon fragments|url=http://blogs.bl.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2017/09/fragmentarium-and-the-burnt-anglo-saxon-fragments.html|website=British Library: Medieval Manuscripts|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library currently operates as a closed system and will open up public resources gradually from 2018.

Fragmentarium follows an established Swiss [[codex]] digitisation system known as e-codices and aims to promote cooperative research and discussion between researchers and scholars from multiple institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kahn|first1=Eve M.|title=Antiquarian Book Fair Offers Victorian Children’s Peep Shows|url=http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/about/history|website=The New York Times|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more fragments are uploaded it will be possible to reunite fragments which have become separated and compare analyses of similar manuscript pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online-Plattform erleichtert die Erforschung alter Handschriften|url=http://www.freiburger-nachrichten.ch/nachrichten/online-plattform-erleichtert-die-erforschung-alter-handschriften|website=Freiburger Nachrichten|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fragments have been analysed using the [[Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-based Sciences and Education#CHESS|Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS)]] to identify pigments, creating a unique "fingerprint" to enable it to be matched to corresponding fragments elsewhere in the world and potentially track their journey with “the potential to learn more about trade routes, historic mining sites, and the regional use of pigments and ingredients”.&lt;ref name="cc2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aloi|first1=Daniel|title=Out of the blue: Medieval fragments yield surprises|url=http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2017/07/out-blue-medieval-fragments-yield-surprises|website=Cornell Chronicle|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other fragments have been identified as "recycled" into covers or bindings for later documents, a practice which was prevalent in the 15th to 17th century.&lt;ref name="srf2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Recycling von Pergament Handschriften - Puzzle in der Stiftsbibliothek|url=https://www.srf.ch/news/regional/ostschweiz/handschriften-puzzle-in-der-stiftsbibliothek|website=Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen (SRF)|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is also useful in documenting and digitally preserving partial manuscripts which have been damaged by neglect or fire as in the [[Cotton library#Ashburnham House fire|Cotton library fire]] of 1731,&lt;ref name=bl2017/&gt; or by deliberate destruction as occurred in the reformation in [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref name=lz2017/&gt; In more recent times, in the 1950s and 1960s medieval manuscripts were frequently deliberately divided in order to attract a higher return on resale values and have subsequently become lost to researchers: Fragmentarium hopes to reunite them.

'''Good law''' is the concept in [[case law|jurisprudence]] that a legal decision is still valid. That is, that a decision has not been overturned (during an [[appeal]]) or otherwise rendered obsolete (such as by a change in the underlying law).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Cite Checking"|url=http://nationalparalegal.edu/public_documents/courseware_asp_files/researchLitigation/LegalResearch/CiteChecking.asp|website=National Paralegal College|accessdate=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gretchen C. Daily''' (born October 19, 1964 [[Washington D.C.]]) is the Bing Professor of Environmental Science in the Department of Biology at [[Stanford University]], the director of the Center for Conservation Biology at Stanford, and a senior fellow at the [[Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment]]. Her main research interests include [[biogeography]], [[conservation biology]] and [[ecology]]. Daily is also a co-founder of the Natural Capital Project, a fellow of the [[U.S. National Academy of Sciences]],&lt;ref name=nas&gt;{{cite web|title=Gretchen Daily|url=http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/members/20004880.html|publisher=National Academy|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]&lt;ref name=alphalist&gt;{{cite web|title=alphalist.pdf|url=https://www.amacad.org/multimedia/pdfs/alphalist.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Science|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[American Philosophical Society]].&lt;ref name=aps&gt;{{cite web|title=APS Member History|publisher=American Philosophical Society|url=http://www.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=gretchen+daily&amp;title=&amp;subject=&amp;subdiv=&amp;mem=&amp;year=&amp;year-max=&amp;dead=&amp;keyword=&amp;smode=advanced|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Daily is a board member at the Beijer Institute for Ecological Economics and the [[Nature Conservancy]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

==Education and career==
Daily received her B.S. in biological sciences from [[Stanford University]] in 1986. She then went on to earn her M.S. in biological sciences at Stanford University in 1987 and received her Ph.D. in biological sciences from Stanford University in 1992.&lt;ref name=biog&gt;{{cite web|title=Gretchen Daily {{!}} Stanford Woods Institute|url=http://woods.stanford.edu/about/woods-faculty/gretchen-daily|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 Daily was awarded the Winslow/Heinz Postdoctoral Fellow at [[UC Berkeley]]'s Energy and Resources Group.&lt;ref name=cv&gt;{{cite web|last=Daily|first=Gretchen|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=http://med.stanford.edu/profiles/viewCV?facultyId=6214&amp;name=Gretchen_Daily|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=6 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612144302/http://med.stanford.edu/profiles/viewCV?facultyId=6214&amp;name=Gretchen_Daily|archivedate=12 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1995 Daily became a Bing Interdisciplinary Research Scientist in the Department of Biological Sciences at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; During her time as a research scientist, Daily served as the editor for ''Nature's Services: Societal Dependence on Natural Ecosystems'', which provides examples of the benefits that ecosystems can provide for societies and ideas for how to quantify the value of these services. The Heinz Foundation noted that ''Nature's Services'' "has served as a model for ecosystems regulation in several regions of the world and was a catalyst for the U.N.'s Millennium Ecosystem Assessment." After 7 years as a research scientist, Daily was appointed as an associate professor in the Department of Biological Sciences and as a senior fellow at the Institute of International Studies (both at Stanford University) in 2002.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; In 2002, Daily also co-wrote the book ''The New Economy of Nature: The Quest to Make Conservation Profitable'' with [[Katherine Ellison]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

In 2005, Daily was appointed as the Bing Professor of Environmental Science in the Department of Biology at Stanford University, a senior fellow at the [[Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment]] and was made the director of the Center for Conservation Biology at Stanford University.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; As of 2013, Daily still holds all three of these positions.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;&lt;ref name=biog/&gt;

In 2005 Daily (the project leader from Stanford), along with partners at [[The Nature Conservancy]], [[the University of Minnesota]], and the [[World Wildlife Fund]], established the Natural Capital Project. The organization's stated goal is to "improve the state of biodiversity and human well-being by motivating greater and more cost-effective investments in both."&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;&lt;ref name=ncp1&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Capital Project - About|url=http://www.naturalcapitalproject.org/about.html#mission|publisher=Natural Capital Project|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As one of the directors of the Natural Capital Project, Daily "serves as [the organization's] chief emissary to financial and government leaders."&lt;ref name=ncp2&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Capital Project - People|url=http://www.naturalcapitalproject.org/people.html#directors|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Daily became a member of the board of directors of the Nature Conservancy. Daily served as the inaugural [[Humanitas Programme|Humanitas]] Visiting Professor in Sustainability Studies at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 2013.

==Awards==
Daily has received numerous prestigious awards and honors throughout her academic career, including the 21st Century Scientist Award (2000), The [[Sophie Prize]] (2008), The [[International Cosmos Prize]] (2009), The 16th Annual [[Heinz Award]] with special focus on global change, the Midori Prize (2010), the [[Volvo Environment Prize]] (2012), and the [[Blue Planet Prize]] (2017).&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;&lt;ref name=2012prize&gt;{{cite web|title=Valuation of natural capital awarded 2012 Volvo Environment Prize|url=http://www.volvogroup.com/group/global/en-gb/investors/_layouts/CWP.Internet.VolvoCom/NewsItem.aspx?News.ItemId=129904&amp;News.Language=en-gb|publisher=Volvo Group|accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Heinz Awards: Gretchen Daily|url=http://www.heinzawards.net/recipients/gretchen-daily|website=The Heinz Awards|publisher=The Heinz Awards|accessdate=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental work earns Gretchen Daily the Blue Planet Prize|url=https://news.stanford.edu/2017/10/19/gretchen-daily-collects-blue-planet-prize/|website=Stanford News|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research area==
Daily's academic profile at the Center for Conservation Biology states that "Daily’s scientific research is on countryside biogeography and the future dynamics of biodiversity change."&lt;ref name=woodsprofile&gt;{{cite web|title=Gretchen Daily|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/CCB/cgi-bin/ccb/content/gretchen-daily|publisher=Woods Institute|accessdate=2013-10-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029233723/http://www.stanford.edu/group/CCB/cgi-bin/ccb/content/gretchen-daily/|archivedate=2013-10-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview, Daily remarked that "'Countryside biogeography' is a new conceptual framework for elucidating the fates of populations, species, and ecosystems in ‘countryside’ – the growing fraction of Earth's unbuilt land surface whose ecosystem qualities are strongly influenced by humanity."&lt;ref name=interviewconservationbytes&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradshaw|first=CJA|title=Conservation Scholars: Gretchen Daily|url=http://conservationbytes.com/2008/09/27/conservation-scholars-gretchen-daily/|publisher=Conservation Bytes|accessdate=2013-10-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029214720/http://conservationbytes.com/2008/09/27/conservation-scholars-gretchen-daily/|archivedate=2013-10-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using findings from research done in countryside biogeography, Daily, and researchers like her, is attempting to determine what "species are most important and most merit protection" and "what is the scientific basis for deciding" the relative importance of species within a given ecosystem.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; When asked "which species/systems most merit protection?" Daily responded that she is "actively attempting to link projected changes in biodiversity and ecosystems to changes in 'services' to humanity." She went on to cite "production of goods," "life-support processes,"  "life-fulfilling conditions" and "options (genetic diversity for future use)" as the services that ecosystems/species provide for humans. 
 
As one of the co-founders of the Natural Capital Project, Daily employs her research practically by working "with private landowners, economists, lawyers, business people, and government agencies to incorporate environmental issues into business practice and public policy."&lt;ref name=biog/&gt;

==Publications==
Daily has authored, coauthored and/or edited five books. Daily has published more than 200 scientific and popular articles.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;&lt;ref name=biog/&gt; She has published articles in many prestigious journals, including ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]'', ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

==''Nature's Services: Societal Dependence on Natural Ecosystems reviews''==
''Nature's Services: Societal Dependence on Natural Ecosystems'' was published in 1997 by [[Island Press]]. ''Nature's Services'' starts off with an introduction from Daily titled "What are Ecosystem Services" and another introductory piece by Harold Mooney and Paul Ehrlich that seeks to detail the "fragmentary history" of ecosystem services. After the introductions, the book is split into four distinct sections that address different elements of ecosystem services.

The first section of the book address the economic issues involved in assigning value to ecosystem services in the first place. The next two sections outline different kinds of services that can be provided by nature, "Overarching Services" and "Services Supplied by Major Biomes."

In his review of the book, James Salzman concluded that ''Nature's Services'', in contrast with efforts like the [[Endangered Species Act]], "takes a different, potentially more effective tack, calling for explicit recognition of ecosystem services because of the direct, tangible benefits they provide. Such recognition could provide a more integrated and compelling basis for action than those suggested by a single-species or biodiversity protection for the simple reason that the impacts of those services on humans are more immediate and undeniably important."&lt;ref name=valuingecosystemservices&gt;{{cite web|last=Salzman|first=James|title=Valuing Ecosystem Services|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2238&amp;context=faculty_scholarship|accessdate=11-1-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The New Economy of Nature: The Quest to Make Conservation Profitable''==
''The New Economy of Nature: The Quest to Make Conservation Profitable'' was co-written by Daily and [[Katherine Ellison]] and was published on September 1, 2003, by [[Island Press]]. The book presents different cases studies where companies or governments were able to actually profit from their conservation efforts. One chapter describes how New York "decided to meet federal requirements to improve
water quality with a less expensive, though more controversial, option of protecting watershed integrity through land purchases and development limits, rather than adopt the technological solution of a multibillion dollar treatment facility."&lt;ref name=karrow/&gt; While another chapter offers "an assessment of plans to manage and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by developing a worldwide system of carbon
trading patterned on the U.S. experience with pollution"&lt;ref name=karrow/&gt;

[[Kenneth Arrow]] remarked that Daily and Ellison "have delineated the new movement to make conservation of natural resources financially rewarding and illustrate in a lively and probing manner many cases of profitable activities that also preserve the biosphere."&lt;ref name=karrow&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Economy of Nature: The Quest to Make Conservation Profitable - Katherine Ellison|url=http://www.katherineellison.com/_p_style__font__14pt_18pt_garamond__georgia__serif_color__1175a4___the_new_econo_40610.htm|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review of the book, Patrick Wilson stated that "The most notable contribution of ''The New Economy of Nature'' is its balanced message, optimistic and cautious." He goes on to say that the book "avoids the fallacy that the market is the solution to our environmental protection challenges and that, if allowed to operate free of government intervention, it can somehow make the policymaking choices less problematic and the tradeoffs less daunting" and that "it challenges elements of environmental orthodoxy that hold that the market, because of its short-term orientation and emphasis on profit over conservation, is an intrinsic threat to nature and the only solution is increased government oversight and financial commitment."&lt;ref name=nrj&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Patrick|title=The New Economy of Nature: The Quest to Make Conservation Profitable.

'''Gómez Pereira''' (1500–1567) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[philosopher]], [[Physician|doctor]], and natural [[humanism|humanist]] from [[Medina del Campo]]. Pereira worked hard to dispel medieval concepts of medicine and proposed the application of empirical methods; as for his philosophy, it is of the standard direction and his reasonings are a clear precedent of [[René Descartes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Santos López, Modesto|title=Gómez Pereira, médico y filósofo medinense  |work=Historia de Medina del Campo y su Tierra, volumen I: Nacimiento y expansión.|year=1986|publisher=Eufemio Lorenzo Sanz, coord. Ayuntamiento de Medina del Campo|isbn=84-505-4412-2|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to propose the famous "''[[Cogito ergo sum]]''", in 1554, commonly attributed to [[René Descartes|Descartes]]. He was famous for his practice of medicine, although he had many diverse occupations, such as owning businesses, [[engineering]], and [[philosophy]].

== Biography ==
Not much is known of his life, because there was no one who took care of his manuscripts.  What is known is the result of the investigation of unrelated documents to which researchers have given shape, many of them having to do with business or lawsuits.

[[File:Documento Notarial de Gómez Pereira.gif|thumb|center|550px|&lt;center&gt;Notary document of 1567 with Pereira's signature&lt;/center&gt;]]

Born in 1500 in [[Medina del Campo]], he was the second of five brothers; his father, Antonia Pereira, owned a small shop of " xerguería," i.e., fabrics and low quality cloths.  His mother, Margarita de Medina, died in 1515 and her sons went to the care of her aunt Ana de Avila.  It is thought that Pereira descended from a family of converted Jews originally from Portugal, though this is not certain because the source of this was a neighbor that testified against him in a lawsuit.

However, we cannot rule out this conversion because we know that, until his marriage, Pereira lived with his parents on Serrano street, which is located in the old Jewish quarter of town.

Pereira studied natural philosophy at the [[University of Salamanca]] with professor Juan Martínez Silíceo (who later became the [[archbishop of Toledo]] between 1545 and 1557).  There, apparently, he was actively involved in the disputes between the [[Philosophical realism|realists]] and the [[nominalists]], preferring the latter and rejecting the authority of the old masters in favor of knowledge provided by experience and reason.  Here, he also studied medicine, concluding his studies 1520.

He then returned to Medina where he established himself as a doctor.  He married Isabel Rodriguez and lived on Rúa Nueva (now Padilla Street) where he worked as a doctor and managed the business that he inherited from his family.  He possessed a considerable amount of capital and invested in a wide range of business including responsibility for making the actual income and managing the collection of several parishes, trading and warehousing wines, and renting rooms to other merchants who went to the "Great Exhibitions of the Kingdom" that took place in Medina.

His fame as a physician exceeded the boundaries of Medina, and he practiced in Burgos, Segovia, Ávila and other important cities of Castille.  He even came to the court of [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip II]] where he was summed to attend upon [[Carlos, Prince of Asturias|Prince Charles]], heir to the unfortunate throne, who had suffered a serious accident.  Thanks to Pereira, the Prince lived until 1568.  He was also interested in the construction of hydraulic devices and, with his companion Francisco Lobato, designed a watermill dam that could function without water, which was patented in 1563.

In folio 26 of the ''Manuscripts of Francisco Lobato'', the Medinan engineer decided to design a special mill, at the initiative of King Maxmilian II of Austria, who at the time was in Vallodolid (ca. 1550), a refugee from the wars against the Protestants.  The future king of Bohemia took a fancy to go up the [[Douro River]], so he commanded a galley be built and ordered the removal of any building that disrupted his navigation, i.e., fisheries and mills.  This greatly harmed the locals who came to Lobato and Pereira to design a mill that could grind with the force of water without being directly on the river bank.  Lobato goes on to explain that a model they tested on the Zapardiel River "milled and shook with reasonable force…, but it sucked in so much water that, by midday, there wasn't a single drop."  Although the model was refined with a dam that returned the water to the river, the king paid no attention, and the project fell into oblivion.  Lobato complained bitterly that, despite the promises of funding by the [[Habsburgs]], "we have already spent 150 ducats…and he never paid me anything—someday I'll have to ask for it."

[[File:Molino de Gomez Pereira.gif|thumb|center|550px|&lt;center&gt;Siphoning mill of Francisco Lobato and Gómez Pereira&lt;/center&gt;]]

Pereira's unique thought arose from his synthesis of philosophy and medicine.  He rejected the authority of the old masters and medievals in favor of reason, logic and experience.  Moreover, he often used paradoxes and syllogisms to expose the errors of those he questioned.  Thus, it can be argued that his philosophy was more negative than positive, but this is understandable considering the context of ideological suppression in the face of religious authority, as well the veiled accusations about Pereira's Jewish origins.  The famous essayist [[Menéndez Pelayo]] wrote of this famous thinker:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In experimental psychology, Gómez Pereira is, without a doubt, more advanced than his time, more than the seventeenth century, more than Bacon, more than Descartes.  None noted the phenomenon of his intelligence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Novae veraeque Medicinae''===
''Novae veraeque Medicinae'' is a medical treatise that focuses on the study of fevers [its causes and types] as well as other specific diseases like leprosy and smallpox.  In this work, which he dedicated to Prince Don Carlos, Pereira challenges the tradition of [[Aristotle]] and [[Galen]], as well as the medieval tradition of "''[[Mirabile dictu|magister dixit]]''". His is an entirely empirical and rational method, based in his experience as a physician.  The healing methods are simple, and the doctor, because of his method and experience, is the final criterion of truth (as opposed to truths of religion or faith).  "In no case of religious things will I give the opinion and sentence of some philosopher if it is not based on reason."

Gómez Pereira felt that the heat generated by a fever is the body's defense mechanism to remove the damage that affects it and, thus, nature restores the natural balance of any body, a surprisingly modern conception of fever as a reaction against disease.  As for his studies of diseases such as leprosy or smallpox, Pereira's conclusions were later commended by the physician and historian Antonio Hernández Morejón.

===''Antoniana Margarita''===
[[File:Antoniana-Margarita.png|thumb|&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;''Antoniana Margarita''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]
''Antoniana Margarita'' was reprinted many times but only very recently translated into Castilian (2000, form the original Latin).  The work is dedicated to his teacher Juan Martinez Silicium and is a tribute to his parents, Antonio and Margarita, even though the subtitle of clearly indicates its scientific and philosophical contents: "a work so useful and necessary for medical, physical, and theologians ("''Opus nempe phisicis, ac medicis teologis, non minus utile quam necessarium''").

A difficult text to read because there are no chapters or paragraphs, the document uses the language of the "christianos nuevos" (New Christians) to explore new ideas from [[empiricism]] and [[materialism]], possibly an effort to hide potentially controversial and blasphemous methods of reasoning (16th Century Castile, the [[Council of Trent]] had already begun). Thus, the Pereira did not venture to develop the logical conclusions to their fullest extent.

It is a philosophical treatise that addresses three key issues:  the "automatism of beasts"; the theory of human knowledge; the immortality of the soul.

====The insensibility of animals====
Pereira's paradigm is typical of the Christian humanism of the [[Renaissance]], denying that animals are equal to humans, while acknowledging some resemblance.  Both have a body with five senses, but in the case of animals, the senses do not lead to knowledge, but cause automatic reactions.  Indeed, many animals are capable of acting on internal impulses (''soma''), upon external stimuli (''specie'' and ''phantasma''), and have some non-conscious ability to learn (''memoria'').  Nevertheless, Pereira denies animals the capacity for real knowledge: "''bruta sensu carent''."

The idea had many supporters, because, as indicated by the author himself, if animals feel just like humans, there would be nothing to differentiate, and if humans and animals are equal, animals can also learn about the Universal, which would be "absurd and impious."  But he also had detractors, some of them very close.  The physician Francisco de Sosa, who published in 1556 his work "''Endecálago against Antoniana Margarita, in which is treated many and very sensitive reasons and authorities of the proofs of the feeling and movement of brutes.''"

====Human knowledge====
In this sense, Pereira's ideas are radically opposed to medieval [[scholasticism]].  He argues that knowledge enters through the sensory organs, as in animals, but only the human soul, its spirit, is capable of converting the information provided by the senses into real thought.  This is one of the qualities of the soul, the ability to extract from physical sensations the substance of things (universals) through this process of abstraction.  But Gómez Pereira believes that sensation and intellect go together in such a way that in human beings there is something that identifies the faculty of feeling with the quality of thought, in the same way, e.g., that thought and language are linked: "if you feel, you understand."

====The immortality of the soul====
Thus, knowledge would be an essential faculty of the soul, and, moreover, the human being has a soul conscious of itself, that exists thanks to the thoughts it develops.  In this work (''Antoniana Margarita''), there is the phrase "I know that I know something, anyone who knows exists, then I exist" ("''Nosco me aliquid noscere, &amp; quidquid noscit, est, ergo ego sum''").&lt;ref&gt;Gómez Pereira, ''Antoniana Margarita'': "De Immortalitate Animae", 1749 [1554], p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Santos López, Modesto (1986). "Gómez Pereira, médico y filósofo medinense". In: ''Historia de Medina del Campo y su Tierra, volumen I: Nacimiento y expansión'', ed. by Eufemio Lorenzo Sanz, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

History has not recognized his contribution even though Descartes had already been accused of plagiarism in his time, for example by Pierre Daniel Huet.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Daniel Huet, ''Censura philosophiae Cartesianae''. París: D. Horthemels, 1689.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Pereira recognizes that animals have souls, it dies with them.  The human soul, however, is self-sufficient and thus immortal.  He provides three proofs that he claims had not been discovered.  First, because of its consciousness, the human soul is capable of knowing independent of the body, and thus is capable of existing despite the body's death.  Secondly, the human soul does not change even though the body ages or becomes diseased, that is, its essence is not affected by extrinsic factors.  Thirdly, it is the desire of all humans to attain happiness, which, alongside the wish to know the future and the consequences of our actions, are the reasons that prompt us to do good, because evil deeds lead to punishment and misfortune.

== Pereira and Descartes ==
After [[René Descartes]] published his ''[[Discourse on Method]]'' in 1637, the originality of the thoughts was questioned and even said to be an overt plagiarism of Gómez Pereira, as the Spanish philosopher had been studied by many prestigious intellectuals during the 16th and 17th Centuries.

The first to suggest the similarities between the two was [[Pierre Daniel Huet]], originally a follower then an opponent of Cartesian philosophy.  Descartes himself was forced to defend himself against these accusations, as is evidenced by a letter he wrote in 1641 to his friend Father Marin Mersenne:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;small&gt;I have not seen ''Antoniana Margarita'', nor do I have a great need to see it any more than the Theses of Louvain or the book of Hansenius, but I would like to know where to find a copy if you think it necessary.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many scholars of the 17th and 18th Centuries sided with Descartes and despised the work of Pereira, among them [[Pierre Bayle]] (although he did recognize the similarity between the two) and the Enclyopedists [[Diderot]] and [[d'Alembert]] who said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Descartes is the first philosopher who dared to consider animals as mere machines: therefore, Gómez Pereira, who said this some time before him . . . stumbled upon this hypothesis by chance.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, many others have defended the contrary thesis.  Even accepting that Descartes may not have read the work of Pereira, they argue that he was influenced indirectly, especially through the work of another Spanish physician and philosopher, Francisco Valles, who read it in French.  Among those who accuse Descartes of being a counterfeit are [[Isaac Cardoso]] and [[Voltaire]].

The basis for this criticism is the striking similarities between the two thinkers on some key points:

# The empirical method: Descartes' is ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' and deductive, whereas Pereira's is ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' and inductive.
#Souls of animals: for both, it is a material soul, limited and mortal
#The "automatism of beasts":  whereas Descartes says that animals have a body, mind and memory, Pereira says the same using different language, viz., animals have internal structure or ''soma'', external stimuli or ''phantasmae'', and the ability to learn or ''memoria''.
#The basic syllogism is strikingly similar in both, the "[[Cogito ergo sum]]" ("''je pense, donc je suis''") of Descartes versus the "''quidquid noscit, est, ergo ego sum''" of Pereira (which precedes Descartes by some one hundred years).

'''Hadi Sabzavari''' ({{lang-fa|ملا هادی سبزواری}}) or '''Hajj Molla Hadi Sabzavari''' (1797–1873) was a famous [[Iran]]ian&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; philosopher, mystic theologian and poet.&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hadi-sabzavari Seyyed Hossein Nasr, "HĀDI SABZAVĀRI" in Encyclopaedia Iranica]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
Molla Hadi lived in Qajar period. According to his description, this period was along with descend of Hikmah; he also complaint of his period for the sake of lacking knowledge and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rizvi|p.474|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of entrance to subject, was common among Islamic philosophers. There was an intellectual and spiritual turmoil in Qajar period. In fact in this period, Iranian encountered with new European thought and revival of traditional thinking; also in this period we can see the diverse divisions in beliefs like Bahaei,Babi, shaykhi and at the same time weakness and disappearance of Shiite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Keddie|p.40-48|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Molla Hadi counted as one of the four prominent masters of Tehran philosophical school. He was along with [[Aqa ‘Ali Mudarris]], [[Aqa Muhammad Riza Qumshihi]], Mirza Abul Hasan Jelveh.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rizvi|p.494|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born in [[Sabzevar]], [[Iran]]&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; to a family of land-owning merchants.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; His formal education started as a young age under his cousin, Molla Hosayn Sabzavari,&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; and he wrote a small treatise at the age of seven.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; His father died when he was seven or eight years old and his uncle Molla Ḥosayn Sabzavari, became his caretaker. When he reached the age of ten, he was taken by his cousin to [[Mashhad]]. There, he resided in the Hajj Hasan madrasa near the mausoleum of [[Imam Reza]], where he studied [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Fiqh|Islamic Jurisprudence]], [[logic]], and the principles of religion and law with Molla Hosay for a period of ten years.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; When he turned twenty, he returned to his hometown of Sabzavar. From there, he prepared his plans for the [[Hajj]] and set out in the direction of [[Isfahan]]. During this period, [[Isfahan]] was an important intellectual center of [[Iran]], where philosophy and intellectual mysticism ('Erfan) flourished.

Among the important masters of these tradition at the time, the names of Mollā ʿAli Nuri (died 1830–31) and Mollā Esmāʿil Eṣfahāni, a student of Nuri, were prominent. They taught Islamic philosophy, mostly of [[Sadr al-Din Shirazi]]  and his school. He remained in [[Isfahan]] for around eight or nine years, where he studied under these two undisputed masters of [[Mulla Sadra]]'s school of philosophy. He concentrated on the main works of Mulla Sadra, such as the [[Asfar]] and Al-Shawahed al-Robubiya.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; Simultaneously, he also studied Islamic jurisprudence with Aqa Mohammad 'Ali Najafi, one of the major Shia scholars of [[Isfahan]].&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; In [[Isfahan]], Sabzevari lived a life of pietry despite having received a substantial inheritance.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; According to the orientalist [[Edward Granville Browne|Edward Browne]], “he used to take pains to discover which of the students stood most in need of pecuniary help, and would then secretly place sums of money in their room during their absence, without leaving any clue that would lead to the identification of the donor. In this way he is said to have expended no less than 100,000 tumáns (about 30,000 Pounds Sterling), while he was in Isfahan, leaving himself only so much as he deemed necessary for his own maintenance”.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

In In 1826–27, Sabzavari returned to [[Mashhad]]. There he began to teach in the Hājj Hasan madrasa although the scholars in Mashhad did not have the same interest in philosophy as [[Isfahan]]. The atmosphere of [[Mashhad]] was not as open as [[Isfahan]] for the pursuit of intellectual sciences. However, he continued to teach both the transmitted science as well as the intellectual sciences. He thought the intellectual sciences based on his work al-Manzuma, which he must have composed in [[Isfahan]]. His commentary on this important work of his however was completed in 1845. In 1831–32, he set out for [[Sabzavar]] where he made preparation for the [[Hajj]]. He left for [[Mecca]] in 1832–33 where he performed the rites of the pilgrimage. He returned to Iran in 1834–35 during the interval of the death of [[Fath Ali Shah Qajar]]. During this period of anarchy, traveling within Iran had become dangerous. Having lost his wife in Hajj, he settled in [[Kerman]] while waiting for calmer conditions to return to [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. During the year he spent in [[Kerman]], he was enganged in asceticism while agreeing to sweep the religious school for its keeper who provided him a room to live in. He married the keeper's daughter that year who was later to accompany him to [[Sabzavar]]. At this time, no one knew his real identity and degree of knowledge.

In 1836–37, Sabzavari set to [[Sabzavar]] and established a center for the study of Islamic philosophy and gnosis. The school he established rivaled with the schools of Tehran and Isfahan due to his personality. For a period of 10 months, he also thought in [[Mashhad]]. However, the rest of time was spent in Sabzevar where he made the Fasihiya school the center of teaching. This school became known as Madrasa-ye Ḥāji, where part of it still survives till this day.  Scholars and students began to flock from all over Persia, Iraq, Turkey, Caucasus, India and even [[Tibet]].  His name became widespread all over Iran so much so that in 1857–58, when [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]] made a pilgrimage to [[Mashhad]], he stopped in Sabzavar and paid a visit to hakim Sabzavari.  The [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] King became very impressed by the philosopher and asked his royal photographer Aqa Reza 'Akkas-Bashi to photograph the hakim.  The picture, which is widely available, is the oldest picture of an Islamic philosopher.  The Qajar king also requested from him a book in Persian containing the complete theory and cycle of traditional philosophy.  Sabzavari obliged and composed the two Persian books: the Asrāral-ḥekam, which he dedicated to Naser al-Din Shah and also another book titled Hedāyat al-ṭālebin.  Sabzavari died suddenly in 1872, probably as a result of heart failure.  The date of his death is recorded in several chronographs, including the numerical value of the couplet ''ka namord zendatar shod'' ("He did not die but became more alive after his passing") which was composed by one of his students.

==Works==
Sabzavari wrote some fifty-two works of prose and poetry in both Arabic and [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;  He wrote the Asrar al-hikmah ("The Secrets of Wisdom"), which, together with his [[Arabic language|Arabic]] treatise Sharh-i manzumah ("A Treatise on Logic in Verse"), remains a basic text for the study of hikmat doctrines in Iran. Not limited to philosophy, he also wrote poetry under the name of Asrar and completed a commentary on the Masnavi of Jalal ad-Din ar-Rumi, the great mystic poet of Islam.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;"Sabzevari, Hajji Hadi." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 12 Jan. 2007  &lt;http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9064639&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

For philosophy in the reign of [[Nasir al-Din Shah]] [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] (1848–1896), he was what [[Mulla Sadra]] had been in the reign of Shah [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]]. He was also the faithful interpreter of Mulla Sadra and [[Transcendent Theosophy]]. He played a part in making Mulla Sadra the 'master thinker' of the Iranian philosophers. It could even be said that circumstances permitted him, to a greater extent than [[Mulla Sadra]], to give free rein to his genius as a mystical theosopher, because there was greater freedom of self-expression during the [[Safavid]] epoch.&lt;ref&gt;Corbin (1993), p.358&lt;/ref&gt;

== Books ==
Sabzevari wrote numerous works in [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]].  He wrote works dealing with an array of subjects from [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] to logic to theology. However, the majority of his works deal with philosophy and mysticism.

*Šarḥ al-manẓuma, is a work in Arabic also known as Ḡorar al-farāʾed. It is one of his more notable books which was completed around 1845. Till this day, it is still thought in religious seminaries in Iran with numerous later commentaries. The work is a versified summary and commentary of the transcendence philosophy of [[Mulla Sadra]].

===Asrār al-ḥekam fi’l-moftataḥ wa’l-moḵtatam===
The book was written for [[Naser al-Din Shah]] after the Shah while passing through Sabzavār asked Mulla Hadi Sabzevari to write a him a book about man's origin and destination in Persian together with the mysteries of God’s onenes.&lt;ref name="Asrar"/&gt;  The book was completed in 1868 and it deals with concepts of illuminative wisdom (ešrāq) and [[peripatetic philosophy]], and is rich in intuitive and mystic insights.&lt;ref name="Asrar"/&gt;

The gnosis of Sabzavari falls into three categories which are: (1) knowledge of God, consisting of knowledge of the beginning and knowledge of the end; (2) knowledge of one's self; (3)  knowledge of God’s commands, consisting of knowledge of every rule of divine law (šarīʿa) and knowledge of the spiritual path (ṭarīqa). On the basis of this classification, the book is divided into two parts.&lt;ref name="Asrar"/&gt;

Part I of the book consists of seven chapters:
*proof of the Necessarily Existent (wāǰeb al-woǰūd),
*knowledge of God’s attributes
*God's actions
*knowledge of one’s self and psychology (maʿāref-e nafs)
*knowledge of man’s origin and destination,
*absolute prophethood
*Imamate

Part II comprises four chapters
*ritual purity (ṭahāra)
*prayer (ṣalāt)
*alms
*fasting (ṣīām).

The most important part of the book is on the proof of the Necessarily Existent (i.e., God).

{{refimprove|date=November 2016}}
[[File:Coat of arms of Kenya (Official).svg|thumb|[[Coat of arms of Kenya]]]]

==History==
'''''Harambee''''' is a [[Kenya]]n tradition of community self-help events, e.g. [[fundraising]] or development activities. ''Harambee'' literally means "all pull together" in [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and is also the official [[List of national mottos|motto]] of Kenya and appears on its [[Coat of arms of Kenya|coat of arms]]. 

Harambee events may range from informal affairs lasting a few hours, in which invitations are spread by word of mouth, to formal, multi-day events advertised in newspapers. These events have long been important in parts of [[East Africa]], as ways to build and maintain communities.

Following [[Kenya]]'s independence in 1963, the first Prime Minister, and later first [[President of Kenya]], [[Jomo Kenyatta]] adopted "Harambee" as a concept of pulling the country together to build a new nation. He encouraged communities to work together to raise funds for all sorts of local projects, pledging that the government would provide their startup costs. Under this system, wealthy individuals wishing to get into politics could donate large amounts of money to local harambee drives, thereby gaining legitimacy; however, such practices were never institutionalised during Kenyatta's presidency.

==Etymology==
A [[popular etymology]] deriving the term from the name of a [[Hindu]] goddess, ''Amba Mata'' (a form of [[Durga]] riding a Tiger) has been proposed, supposedly via Hindu railway linesmen carrying  loads of iron rails and sleeper blocks who would chant "har, har Ambe!" ("praise Amba") when working.

The first president, [[Jomo Kenyatta]] has been said to have witnessed such a railway line team as it worked in cohesion and harmony and derived the term from there.  The actual etymology of the term is, however, cited as genuinely Bantu, from the [[Miji Kenda]] term ''halumbe'' "to pull or push together".&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.jaluo.com/?p=8900 Kenya:&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Criticism==
The word ''Harambee'' and the concept of ''harambee'' funds-drives have received criticism. The word was originally adopted by [[Jomo Kenyatta]] into the Kenyan philosophy to mean ''pulling together'' or cooperating in community projects. 

===Historical Abuse and Poor Performance===
Due to repeated abuse, the word ''Harambee'' is often perceived to refer to manipulative or deceptive collection of monetary funds from the public. 

''Harambee'' funds drives have been repeatedly abused through:-
*misappropriation of publicly collected ''harambee'' funds by individuals;
*force contributions by government officials;
*forced contributions through forced and unofficial deductions on the salaries of government employees;
*corruption and use of ''harambee'' (funds drives) for personal gains;
*many stalled ''harambee'' projects (schools, hospitals, roads, State owned factories etc);
*poor coordination of ''harambee'' funded projects;
*use of ''harambee'' funds drives as campaign platforms by political aspirants;
*use of ''harambee'' funds drives to publicly attack and embarrass political rivals;
*use of ''harambee'' funds drives to launder money stolen by officers who attempt to clean their public image by appearing to give generous donations for public projects;
*use of ''harambee'' events to give bribes under the guise of issuing public donations;
*poor performance of State controlled entities that have the word ''Harambee'' as part of their name e.g., the national football team [[Kenya_national_football_team|''Harambee Stars'']];
*perceived inferior status and poor management history of ''Harambee'' schools which were established through ''Harambee'' fund-raising projects; and
*perceived legitimisation of dependency on donations or external assistance at the expense of promoting self-sufficiency, resourcefulness and innovation.

===Religious Criticism===
Kenyan Christians have criticised the use of the word ''Harambee'' as an official term due to its apparent hindu origin. ''Harambee'' is neither a Hindu god nor a hindu word; it is a Swahili word and Kenyan. The objections have also been dismissed on the basis that even if the supposed derivation from ''Hare Ambeh'' (Hail Ambeh) were true, it has become irrelevant to the term's modern usage and meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/blogs-news/hindu-press-international/kenyan-national-motto-controversial-to-some/3084.html "Kenyan National Motto Controversial to Some"], ''Hindu Press International,'' July 5, 2003 [http://allafrica.com/stories/200805051353.html "Kenya: What's in a Name? Goddesses Have Always Been Worshipped"], ''The Nation,'' May 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempted Replacement===
In January 2002, the Risk Advisory Group Ltd commissioned by [[Daniel_arap_Moi|President Moi's]] administration as part of the anti-corruption efforts recommended the abolition of ''harambee'' or the ''spirit of pulling together''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000092053/efforts-to-end-corruption-in-harambees "Efforts to end corruption in harambees"], ''The Standard'', August 27, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2003 when the [[National_Rainbow_Coalition|National Rainbow Coalition NARC]] took over from the [[Kenya_African_National_Union|Kenya African National Union KANU]], President [[Mwai Kibaki]] enacted the Public Officers Ethics Act which prohibited Members of Parliament and Cabinet Secretaries from presiding over ''Harambees''.

In February 2018, a petition was presented to the Kenyan Parliament, [[Senate_of_Kenya|Senate]], seeking to have the word ''HARAMBEE'' removed from the Public Seal on the claim that it represents a Hindu Goddess &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001269763/petition-over-word-harambee-splits-senators "Petition over word ‘harambee’ splits senators"], ''The Standard'', February 15, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Harrison Allen.jpg|thumb|]]
'''Harrison Allen''' (1841–1897) was an [[United States|American]] physician and [[anatomist]], born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]].  He graduated from the [[Perelman School of Medicine|medical department of the University of Pennsylvania]] in 1861,&lt;ref name="AMB"&gt;{{Cite AMB1920|wstitle=Allen, Harrison}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1862 became a [[surgeon]] in the [[United States Army]] and served until the conclusion of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in 1865. Doctor Allen should not be confused with the Union Army officer who was colonel of the 151st Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment, who was mustered out July 31, 1863 and later was awarded the grade of brevet brigadier general.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, John H., and [[David J. Eicher]], ''Civil War High Commands.'' Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8047-3641-3}}. p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boatner, Mark Mayo, III. ''The Civil War Dictionary.'' New York: McKay, 1988. {{ISBN|0-8129-1726-X}}. First published 1959 by McKay. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865 he was made professor of comparative anatomy and medical zoölogy at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].  He was transferred in 1878 to the chair of [[physiology]], which he occupied until 1895.

==Publications==
In addition to many papers contributed to medical journals, he authored a number of books:
* ''Outlines of Comparative Anatomy and Medical Zoölogy'' (1867)
* ''Studies in the Facial Region'' (1874)
* An Analysis of the Life Form in Art'' (1875)
* ''System of Human Anatomy'' (1880)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6444">'''Jean Beaufret''' ({{IPA-fr|bofʁɛ|lang}}; 22 May 1907 in [[Auzances]]{{spaced ndash}}7 August 1982 in [[Paris]]) was a French [[philosopher]] and [[Germanist]] tremendously influential in the reception of [[Martin Heidegger]]'s work in [[France]].

==Life==
After graduating from the [[École Normale Supérieure]] and completing military service Beaufret passed his ''[[agrégation]] de philosophie'' in 1933 and undertook a career teaching as a [[lycée]] philosophy instructor. His early philosophical interests were in 19th century [[German philosophy]], particularly [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|GWF Hegel]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], and [[Karl Marx]]. In the period before the [[World War II|Second World War]], he came to know [[Paul Éluard]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[André Breton]], and [[Paul Valéry]]. During the war, he was a prisoner and escaped. Then he became a member of the Resistance near the city of Lyon in the "Service Périclès".

==Beaufret and Heidegger==
In 1946, as Heidegger's continued teaching privileges came into question by the [[denazification]] committees, he made Beaufret's acquaintance. Beaufret engaged Heidegger on the development of French existentialism, and Heidegger wrote the ''[[Letter on Humanism]]'' (Brief über den Humanismus) to Beaufret in response. Beaufret took his students to visit Heidegger at Todtnauberg in 1947 following a month-long Franco-German academic exchange at [[Freiburg|Freiburg im Breisgau]], while [[Baden-Württemberg]] was still under French occupation. [[Jean-François Lyotard]], one of the group of students on the trip selected to visit Heidegger, wrote about the experience thus:

:I remember a sly peasant in his ''Hütte'', dressed in traditional costume, of sententious speech and shifty eye, apparently lacking in shame and anxiety, protected by his knowledge and flattered by his discipline. This picture was enough to prevent me from becoming a "Heideggerian." I take no pride in this. These were fugitive impressions, due no doubt to the prejudices of a young Parisian. I continued to read his work. ("Heidegger and 'the Jews': a Conference in Vienna and Freiburg", p. 137, in ''Political Writings'')

Beaufret remained a close associate of Heidegger's, and it was through Beaufret that Heidegger became aware of [[Jacques Derrida|Jacques Derrida's work]].

He was "a legendary professor of philosophy, having trained generations of students and future professors" (D. Pettigrew and F. Raffoul, ''French Interpretations of Heidegger'', p.&amp;nbsp;6).

Beaufret is considered the wellspring of "orthodox French Heideggerianism," which was the element of French philosophy that was most dismissive of Heidegger's involvement with [[Nazism|National Socialism]] after the French publication in 1987 of [[Víctor Farías]]'s ''Heidegger and Nazism''. One reason for Beaufret's dismissal of Farías may have been the latter's revealing that Beaufret, according to Farías, had written in agreement with the holocaust denial of [[Robert Faurisson]] (however such interpersonal relations are exaggerated given that Beaufret's interest in Heidegger's thought was central to his own philosophical growth as a thinker, and his focus was mainly on the conceptual merits of Heideggerianism).  In a letter sent to Faurisson, Beaufret is quoted as saying:

"I believe that for my part I have traveled approximately the same path as you and have been considered suspect for having expressed the same doubts [concerning the existence of the gas chambers]. Fortunately for me, this was done orally." Also [[Jacques Derrida]] was shocked by Beaufret's anti-Semitic tirade against [[Emmanuel Levinas]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wolin, "French Heidegger Wars." in ''The Heidgegger Controversy'', ed. Richard Wolin, p. 282; Víctor Farías, ''Heidegger and Nazism'', Temple University Press, 1989, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; [[:Fr:François Fédier|François Fédier]] replied that Beaufret actually wrote this letter in 1978, long before Faurisson declared himself as a true negationist, so that he is absolutely not denying the Holocaust. Beaufret wrote the letter only because Faurisson, who was a former student of his, had been violently attacked in the street.&lt;ref&gt;[[:Fr:François Fédier|François Fédier]], « Lettre au Pr. H.Ott » in ''Regarder voir'', Belles Lettres/Archimbaud, 1995, p.244&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the so-called anti-Semitic tirade, Jacques Derrida actually didn't hear it : this was reported to him by a friend, Roger Laporte, and Beaufret denied it completely.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

'''Johan Andreas Dèr Mouw''' (24 July 1863 – 8 July 1919) was a Dutch poet and philosopher. During Dèr Mouw's life only some of his poems were published in literary journals.

==Life and career==
Dèr Mouw was born in [[Westervoort]]. His father Jacob Cornelis der Mouw (orig. Dermauw) was for a short period insurance agent and bookseller; his mother Anna Elisabeth Zillinger was director of a school in [[Deventer]]. Dèr Mouw attended the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] (grammar school) in Deventer and studied at [[Leiden University]] from 1883 up to 1887, where he took up Greek, Latin, Sanskrit and philosophy. After graduating, Dèr Mouw got a job as teacher at the Gymnasium in [[Doetinchem]].
He defended his doctoral [[dissertation]] (''Quomodo Antiqui Naturam mirati sunt?'') at Leiden University in 1890. In 1893 Dèr Mouw married Hendrika van Enst. Their stepdaughter Teuntje Vink was later renamed Hetty der Mouw.
Dèr Mouw's companionship with the son of the headmaster of the Gymnasium in Doetinchem led to a conflict. He was sued and convicted for insulting the headmaster. (His attorney was [[Pieter Jelles Troelstra]]). In the course of the scandal Dèr Mouw tried to commit suicide. Afterwards, Dèr Mouw moved to [[Rijswijk]] in 1904, and later to [[The Hague]], where he supported his family by giving private tuition. He devoted the rest of his life to writing poetry and studying philosophy. He published two books on philosophy, with special attention to [[Hegel]].

==Poetry==
The poetry of Dèr Mouw is special, because he manages to express his mystical view on the world in clear words, that have a down-to-earth appeal. This can be seen in one of his most famous poems: ''I'm Brahman. But we are without a maid''. Dèr Mouw published some of his poems in literary magazines, and was immediately recognised as an important poet by writers like [[Frederik van Eeden]] and [[Albert Verwey]]. Poets like [[P.C. Boutens]] and [[J. H. Leopold|J.H. Leopold]] shared his interest for eastern mysticism.
Dèr Mouw's didn't live to see his first book, ''Brahman I'', come to light. It  was published within a few weeks after his death, in July 1919.

Letters and manuscripts of J.A. Dèr Mouw are being kept in the Nederlands Letterkundig Museum in The Hague.

This, however, is only part of the story. For the kind of internal agreement just discussed is adequate only to establish what Fichte himself called the "inner truth"—by which he meant the consistency and completeness of a system. But surely a system can be consistent and complete without being true in the sense that Fichte himself considered most important, that is, without possessing any extra-systematic basis in something certain. This kind of truth, which Fichte sometimes referred to as a philosophy's "outer truth," cannot be established simply by insuring the correct ... systematic form."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Solomon&gt;[[Robert C.

In a similar way, Fichte had derived in his ''[[Foundations of the Science of Knowledge]]'' (publ. 1794/1795, paras. 1–2) the logical laws of identity and non-contradiction from the original positing and counter-positing of the I.

Recently, philosophers and scholars have begun to appreciate Fichte as an important philosopher in his own right due to his original insights into the nature of [[self-consciousness]] or [[self-awareness]].&lt;ref name="Henrich"/&gt; Fichte was also the originator of ''[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis–antithesis–synthesis]]'',&lt;ref name="Breazeale 63"&gt;"Review of ''[[Aenesidemus (book)|Aenesidemus]]''" ([http://www.gleichsatz.de/b-u-t/trad/fichte/jgf-aenesidemus.html "Rezension des Aenesidemus"], ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung|de}}'', February 11–12, 1794).

Solomon]], ''In the Spirit of Hegel'', Oxford University Press, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and Kant before him, Fichte was motivated by the problem of [[subjectivity]] and [[consciousness]]. Fichte also wrote works of [[political philosophy]]; he has a reputation as one of the fathers of [[German nationalism]].

==Biography==

===Origins===
Fichte was born in [[Rammenau]], [[Upper Lusatia]]. The son of a ribbon weaver,&lt;ref name="nie"&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Fichte, Johann Gottlieb|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; he came of peasant stock which had lived in the region for many generations. The family was noted in the neighborhood for its probity and piety. Christian Fichte, Johann Gottlieb's father, married somewhat above his station. It has been suggested that a certain impatience which Fichte himself displayed throughout his life was an inheritance from his mother.&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt;

Young Fichte received the rudiments of his education from his father. He showed remarkable ability from an early age, and it was owing to his reputation among the villagers that he gained the opportunity for a better education than he otherwise would have received. The story runs that the Freiherr von Militz, a country landowner, arrived too late to hear the local pastor preach. He was, however, informed that a lad in the neighborhood would be able to repeat the sermon practically verbatim. As a result, the baron took the lad into his protection, which meant that he paid his tuition.&lt;ref name="americana"&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Fichte, Johann Gottlieb|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early schooling===
Fichte was placed in the family of Pastor Krebel at [[Niederau]] near [[Meissen]] and there received thorough grounding in the [[classics]]. From this time onward, Fichte saw little of his parents. In October 1774, he was attending the celebrated foundation-school at [[Pforta]] near [[Naumburg]]. This school is associated with the names of [[Novalis]], [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]], [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]. The spirit of the institution was semi-monastic and, while the education given was excellent in its way, it is doubtful whether there was enough social life and contact with the world for a pupil of Fichte's temperament and antecedents. Perhaps his education strengthened a tendency toward introspection and independence, characteristics which appear strongly in his doctrines and writings.&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt;

===Theological studies and private tutoring===
In 1780, he began study at the theology seminary of [[University of Jena]]. He was transferred a year later to study at the [[Leipzig University]]. Fichte seems to have supported himself at this period of bitter poverty and hard struggle.&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt; Freiherr von Militz continued to support him, but when he died in 1784, Fichte had to end his studies prematurely, without completing his degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Breazeale|first1=Daniel|last2=Fichte|first2=Johann|title=Fichte: Early Philosophical Writings|date=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the years 1784 to 1788, he supported himself in a precarious way as tutor in various Saxon families.&lt;ref name="nie"/&gt; In early 1788, he returned to [[Leipzig]] in the hope of finding a better employment, but eventually he had to settle for a much less promising position with the family of an innkeeper in [[Zurich]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J. La Vopa, ''Fichte: The Self and the Calling of Philosophy, 1762-1799'', Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in Zurich for the next two years (1788–1790), which was a time of great contentment for him. There he met his future wife, Johanna Rahn,&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;She happened to be the niece of the famous poet [[F. G. Klopstock]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]]. There he also became in 1793 a member of the [[Freemasonry]] lodge "Modestia cum Libertate" with which [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] was also connected.&lt;ref&gt;Imhof, Gottlieb (1959).

La Vopa, ''Fichte: The Self and the Calling of Philosophy, 1762-1799'', Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1790, Fichte began to study the works of Kant, but this occurred initially because one of his students wanted to know about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Breazeale|first1=Daniel|last2=Fichte|first2=Johann|title=Fichte: Early Philosophical Writings|date=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had a lasting effect on the trajectory of his life and thought. While he was assimilating the Kantian philosophy and preparing to develop it, fate dealt him a blow: the Rahn family had suffered financial reverses, and his impending marriage had to be postponed.&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt;

===Kant===
From Zurich, Fichte returned to Leipzig in May 1790.&lt;ref name="La Vopa 151"/&gt; In the spring of 1791, he obtained a tutorship at [[Warsaw]] in the house of a [[Polish people|Polish]] nobleman. The situation, however, quickly proved disagreeable and he was released. He then got a chance to see Kant at [[Königsberg]]. After a disappointing interview on July 4 of the same year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Breazeale|first1=Daniel|last2=Fichte|first2=Johann|title=Fichte: Early Philosophical Writings|date=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; he shut himself in his lodgings and threw all his energies into the composition of an essay which would compel Kant's attention and interest. This essay, completed in five weeks, was the ''Versuch einer Critik&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; aller Offenbarung'' (''[[Attempt at a Critique of All Revelation]]'', 1792).&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt; In this book, according to Henrich, Fichte investigated the connections between divine revelation and Kant's [[critical philosophy]]. The first edition of the book was published without Kant or Fichte's knowledge, moreover without Fichte's name or signed preface.  It was thus mistakenly thought to be a new work by Kant himself.&lt;ref&gt;Traditionally, it has been assumed that either the omission was an accident or a deliberate attempt by the publisher to move copies. In either case, Fichte did not plan it and in fact only heard of the accident much later.  He writes to his fiancée: "Why did I have to have such utterly strange, excellent, unheard-of good luck?" See Garrett Green's Introduction to ''Attempt at a Critique of All Revelation''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews were assuming Kant was the author when Kant cleared the confusion and openly praised the work and author. Fichte's reputation skyrocketed as many intellectuals of the day were of the opinion that it was "the most shocking and astonishing news... [since] nobody but Kant could have written this book. This amazing news of a third sun in the philosophical heavens has set me into such confusion".&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Jens Baggeson to Karl Reinhold. Quoted in Editor's Introduction to Fichte, ''Early Philosophical Writings''. London: Cornell University Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Karl Popper]] considers the book as essentially "a fraud" which though rather boring cleverly imitated Kant's style and that the rumours that Kant himself had written the book to be contrived.&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Karl. "The Open Society and Its Enemies." Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994. Vol 2, p 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant waited seven years to make public statement about the incident; after considerable external pressure he dissociated himself from Fichte. In his statement, he inscribed, "May God protect us from our friends. From our enemies, we can try to protect ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Karl. "The Open Society and Its Enemies." Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994. Vol 2, p 266. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Jena===
In October 1793, he was married in Zurich, where he remained the rest of the year. Stirred by the events and principles of the [[French Revolution]], he wrote and anonymously published two pamphlets which led to him being seen as a devoted defender of liberty of thought and action and an advocate of political changes. In December of the same year, he received an invitation to fill the position of extraordinary professor of philosophy at the [[University of Jena]]. He accepted and began his lectures in May of the next year. With extraordinary zeal, he expounded his system of "[[transcendental idealism]]". His success was immediate. He seems to have excelled as a lecturer because of the earnestness and force of his personality. These lectures were later published under the title ''The Vocation of the Scholar'' (''Einige Vorlesungen über die Bestimmung des Gelehrten''). He gave himself up to intense production, and a succession of works soon appeared.&lt;ref name="nie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt;

===Atheism Dispute===
{{main|Atheism Dispute}}
After weathering a couple of academic storms, he was finally dismissed from Jena in 1799 as a result of a charge of atheism. He was accused of atheism in 1798 after publishing his essay "Ueber&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; den Grund unsers&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; Glaubens an eine göttliche Weltregierung" ("On the Ground of Our Belief in a Divine World-Governance"), which he had written in response to [[Friedrich Karl Forberg]]'s essay "Development of the Concept of Religion", in his ''Philosophical Journal''. For Fichte, God should be conceived primarily in moral terms: "The living and efficaciously acting moral order is itself God. We require no other God, nor can we grasp any other" ("On the Ground of Our Belief in a Divine World-Governance").

Fichte's intemperate "Appeal to the Public" ("Appellation an das Publikum", 1799) provoked [[F. H. Jacobi]] to publish an [[open letter]] to Fichte, in which he equated philosophy in general and Fichte's [[transcendental philosophy]] in particular with [[nihilism]].&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;

===Berlin===
Since all the German states except Prussia had joined in the cry against him, he was forced to go to Berlin. There he associated himself with the Schlegels, [[Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Ludwig Tieck|Tieck]].&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt;

In April 1800, through the introduction of Hungarian writer [[Ignaz Aurelius Fessler]], he was initiated into [[Freemasonry]] in the Lodge Pythagoras of the Blazing Star where he was elected minor warden. At first Fichte was a warm admirer of Fessler, and was disposed to aid him in his proposed Masonic reform. But later he became Fessler's bitter opponent. Their controversy attracted much attention among Freemasons.&lt;ref name="Mackey"&gt;{{Cite book|journal=Mackey's National Freemason|title=Fichte as a Freemason: October 1872 to September 1873|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ip5bF1xtRB0C&amp;pg=PA430|page=430|date=2003|editor=Albert G. Mackey|isbn=9780766157170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fichte presented two lectures on the philosophy of Masonry during the same period as part of his work on the development of various [[Masonic degree|higher degrees]] for the lodge in Berlin.&lt;ref name="Magee 55"&gt;Glenn Alexander Magee, ''Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition'', Cornell University Press, 2008, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; A certain Johann Karl Christian Fischer, a high official of the [[Grand Orient]], published those lectures in 1802/03 in two volumes under the title ''Philosophy of Freemasonry: Letters to Konstant'' (''Philosophie der Maurerei. Briefe an Konstant''), where Konstant referred to a fictitious non-Mason.&lt;ref name="Magee 55"/&gt;

In November 1800, Fichte published ''The Closed Commercial State: A Philosophical Sketch as an Appendix to the Doctrine of Right and an Example of a Future Politics'' (''Der geschlossene Handelsstaat. Ein philosophischer Entwurf als Anhang zur Rechtslehre und Probe einer künftig zu liefernden Politik''), a philosophical statement of his property theory, a historical analysis of European economic relations, and a political proposal for reforming them.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Nakhimovsky, ''The Closed Commercial State: Perpetual Peace and Commercial Society from Rousseau to Fichte'', Princeton University Press, 2011, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1805, he was appointed to a professorship in [[University of Erlangen|Erlangen]]. The [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|disaster at Jena]] in 1806, in which [[Napoleon]] completely crushed the Prussian army, drove him to Königsberg for a time, but he returned to Berlin in 1807 and continued his literary activity.&lt;ref name="nie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt;

The deplorable situation of Germany stirred him to the depths and led him to deliver the famous ''[[Addresses to the German Nation]]'' (''Reden an die deutsche Nation'', 1808) which guided the uprising against Napoleon. He became a professor of the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|new university at Berlin]] founded in 1810. By the votes of his colleagues Fichte was unanimously elected its rector in the succeeding year. But, once more, his impetuosity and reforming zeal led to friction, and he resigned in 1812. The campaign against Napoleon began, and the hospitals at Berlin were soon full of patients. Fichte's wife devoted herself to nursing and caught a virulent fever. Just as she was recovering, he himself was stricken down. He died of [[typhus]] at the age of 51.&lt;ref name="nie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt;

His son, [[Immanuel Hermann Fichte]] (18 July 1796 – 8 August 1879), also made contributions to [[philosophy]].

==Philosophical work==
In mimicking Kant's difficult style, his critics argued that Fichte produced works that were barely intelligible. "He made no hesitation in pluming himself on his great skill in the shadowy and obscure, by often remarking to his pupils, that 'there was only one man in the world who could fully understand his writings; and even he was often at a loss to seize upon his real meaning.'"&lt;ref&gt;Robert Blakely, ''History of the Philosophy of Mind'', Vol. IV, p. 114, London: Longmans, 1850&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Fichte himself acknowledged the difficulty of his writings, but argued that his works were clear and transparent to those who made the effort to think without preconceptions and prejudices.

Fichte did not endorse Kant's argument for the existence of [[noumenon|noumena]], of "things in themselves", the supra-sensible reality beyond the categories of direct human perception. Fichte saw the rigorous and [[system]]atic separation of "things in themselves" ([[noumenon|noumena]]) and things "as they appear to us" ([[phenomenon|phenomena]]) as an invitation to [[skepticism]]. Rather than invite such skepticism, Fichte made the radical suggestion that we should throw out the notion of a noumenal world and instead accept the fact that [[consciousness]] does not have a grounding in a so-called "real world". In fact, Fichte achieved fame for originating the argument that consciousness is not grounded in ''anything'' outside of itself. The phenomenal world as such, arises from self-consciousness; the activity of the ego; and moral awareness. His student (and critic), [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], wrote:

{{Quotation|Fichte who, because the [[thing-in-itself]] had just been discredited, at once prepared a system without any thing-in-itself. Consequently, he rejected the assumption of anything that was not through and through merely our [[Representation (psychology)|representation]], and therefore let the knowing [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] be all in all or at any rate produce everything from its own resources. For this purpose, he at once did away with the essential and most meritorious part of the [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian doctrine, the distinction between ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' and ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' and thus that between the [[phenomenon]] and the thing-in-itself. For he declared everything to be ''a priori'', naturally without any evidence for such a monstrous assertion; instead of these, he gave sophisms and even crazy sham demonstrations whose absurdity was concealed under the mask of profundity and of the incomprehensibility ostensibly arising therefrom. Moreover, he appealed boldly and openly to [[intellectual]] [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], that is, really to [[Invention|inspiration]].|Arthur Schopenhauer, ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. I, §13}}

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] was also a student of the writings of Fichte: 
{{Quotation|Our whole age is imbued with a formal striving. This is what led us to disregard congeniality and to emphasize symmetrical beauty, to prefer conventional rather than sincere social relations. It is this whole striving which is denoted by — to use the words of another author — Fichte's and the other philosophers' attempts to construct systems by sharpness of mind and Robespierre's attempt to do it with the help of the guillotine; it is this which meets us in the flowing butterfly verses of our poets and in Auber's music, and finally, it is this which produces the many revolutions in the political world. I agree perfectly with this whole effort to cling to form, insofar as it continues to be the medium through which we have the idea, but it should not be forgotten that it is the idea which should determine the form, not the form which determines the idea. We should keep in mind that life is not something abstract but something extremely individual. We should not forget that, for example, from a poetic genius' position of immediacy, form is nothing but the coming into existence of the idea in the world, and that the task of reflection is only to investigate whether or not the idea has gotten the properly corresponding form. Form is not the basis of life, but life is the basis of form. Imagine that a man long infatuated with the Greek mode of life had acquired the means to arrange for a building in the Greek style and a Grecian household establishment — whether or not he would be satisfied would be highly problematical, or would he soon prefer another form simply because he had not sufficiently tested himself and the system in which he lived. But just as a leap backward is wrong (something the age, on the whole, is inclined to acknowledge), so also a leap forward is wrong — both of them because a natural development does not proceed by leaps, and life's earnestness will ironize over every such experiment, even if it succeeds momentarily.|Søren Kierkegaard, ''Journals'', "Our Journalistic Literature", November 28, 1835&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Kierkegaard,Soren/JournPapers/I_B.html Journals and Papers of Søren Kierkegaard, 1B]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Central theory===
{{refimprove|section|date=May 2017}}
In his work ''[[Foundations of Natural Right]]'' (1797), Fichte argued that [[self-awareness|self-consciousness]] was a social phenomenon — an important step and perhaps the first clear step taken in this direction by modern philosophy. A necessary condition of every subject's self-awareness, for Fichte, is the existence of other rational subjects. These others call or summon (''fordern auf'') the subject or self out of its unconsciousness and into an awareness of itself as a free individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foundations of Natural Right|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/96398724/Fichte-Foundations-of-Natural-Right-1797|website=Scribd|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fichte's account proceeds from the general principle that the I (''das Ich'') must posit itself as an individual in order to posit (''setzen'') itself at all, and that in order to posit itself as an individual it must recognize itself as it were to a calling or summons (''Aufforderung'') by other free individual(s) — called, moreover, to limit its own freedom out of respect for the freedom of the other. The same condition applied and applies, of course, to the other(s) in its development. Hence, mutual recognition (''gegenseitig anerkennen'') of rational individuals turns out to be a condition necessary for the individual I in general.&lt;ref&gt;Fichte, J. G. (2000), ''Foundations of Natural Right, according to the Principles of the Wissenschaftslehre'', ed. F. Neuhouser, trans. M. Baur. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Allen W. Wood]], ''The Free Development of Each: Studies on Reason, Right, and Ethics in Classical German Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 207: "The whole point of the summons, in fact, is that it is what first makes our individuality possible for us, through presenting us with the concept of our own individual free action in the form of an object of our consciousness."&lt;/ref&gt; This argument for [[intersubjectivity]] is central to the conception of selfhood developed in the ''[[Foundations of the Science of Knowledge]]''&lt;ref&gt;Also translated as ''Foundations of the Entire Science of Knowledge''.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Grundlage der gesamten&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; Wissenschaftslehre'', 1794/1795). In Fichte's view consciousness of the self depends upon resistance or a check by something that is understood as not part of the self yet is not immediately ascribable to a particular sensory perception.  In his later 1796–1799 lectures (his ''Nova methodo''), Fichte incorporated it into his revised presentation of the very foundations of his system, where the summons takes its place alongside original feeling, which takes the place of the earlier ''Anstoss'' (see below) as both a limit upon the absolute freedom of the I and a condition for the positing of the same.

The I itself posits this situation for itself. To posit does not mean to 'create' the objects of consciousness. The principle in question simply states that the essence of an I lies in the assertion of one's own self-identity, i.e., that consciousness presupposes self-consciousness. Such immediate self-identity, however, cannot be understood as a psychological fact, nor as an act or accident of some previously existing substance or being. It is an action of the I, but one that is identical with the very existence of this same I. In Fichte's technical terminology, the original unity of self-consciousness is to be understood both as an action and as the product of the same I, as a "fact and/or act" (''Thathandlung''; [[Modern German]]: ''Tathandlung''), a unity that is presupposed by and contained within every fact and every act of empirical consciousness, although it never appears as such therein.

The I must posit itself in order to be an I at all; but it can posit itself only insofar as it posits itself as limited. Moreover, it cannot even posit for itself its own limitations, in the sense of producing or creating these limits. The finite I cannot be the ground of its own passivity. Instead, for Fichte, if the I is to posit itself off at all, it must simply discover itself to be limited, a discovery that Fichte characterizes as an "impulse,"&lt;ref&gt;Breazeale 2013, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; "repulse,"&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Adams, George Pattison, Graham Ward (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Theology and Modern European Thought'', Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; or "resistance"&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Reid, ''The Anti-Romantic: Hegel Against Ironic Romanticism'', A&amp;C Black, 2014, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Anstoss''; Modern German: ''[[wikt:Anstoß|Anstoß]]'') to the free practical activity of the I. Such an original limitation of the I is, however, a limit for the I only insofar as the I posits it out as a limit. The I does this, according to Fichte's analysis, by positing its own limitation, first, as only a feeling, then as a sensation, then as an intuition of a thing, and finally as a summons of another person. The ''Anstoss'' thus provides the essential impetus that first posits in motion the entire complex train of activities that finally result in our conscious experience both of ourselves and others as empirical individuals and of the world around us.

Though ''Anstoss'' plays a similar role as the [[thing in itself]] does in [[Kantian]] philosophy, unlike Kant, Fichte's ''Anstoss'' is not something foreign to the I. Instead, it denotes the original encounter of the I with its own finitude. Rather than claim that the not-I (''das Nicht-Ich'') is the cause or ground of the ''Anstoss'', Fichte argues that not-I is posited by the I precisely in order to explain to itself the ''Anstoss'', that is, in order to become conscious of ''Anstoss''.

Though the ''Wissenschaftslehre'' demonstrates that such an ''Anstoss'' must occur if self-consciousness is to come about, it is quite unable to deduce or to explain the actual occurrence of such an ''Anstoss'' — except as a condition for the possibility of consciousness. Accordingly, there are strict limits to what can be expected from any a priori deduction of experience, and this limitation, for Fichte, equally applies to Kant's transcendental philosophy.

According to Fichte, transcendental philosophy can explain that the world must have space, time, and causality, but it can never explain why objects have the particular sensible properties they happen to have or why I am this determinate individual rather than another. This is something that the I simply has to discover at the same time that it discovers its own freedom, and indeed, as a condition for the latter.

[[Dieter Henrich]] (1966) proposed that Fichte was able to move beyond a "reflective theory of consciousness". According to Fichte, the self must already have some prior acquaintance with itself, independent of the act of reflection ("no object comes to consciousness except under the condition that I am aware of myself, the conscious subject [''jedes Object kommt zum Bewusstseyn lediglich unter der Bedingung, dass ich auch meiner selbst, des bewusstseyenden Subjects mir bewusst sey'']").&lt;ref&gt;Fichte, J. G., ''Versuch einer neuen Darstellung der Wissenschaftslehre'' (1797/1798): II.2; ''Gesamtausgabe'' I/4:274–275.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is what Henrich called [[Fichte's original insight]].&lt;ref name="Henrich"&gt;[[Dieter Henrich]], "Fichte's Original Insight", ''Contemporary German Philosophy'' 1 (1982 [1966]), ed. by Darrel E. Christensen ''et al.'', pp. 15–52 (translation of Henrich, Dieter (1966), "Fichtes ursprüngliche Einsicht", in: ''Subjektivität und Metaphysik. Festschrift für Wolfgang Cramer'' edited by D. Henrich und H. Wagner, Frankfurt/M., pp. 188–232). Henrich's article is an analysis of the following three presentations of the ''[[Gnosology|Wissenschaftslehre]]'': ''[[Foundations of the Science of Knowledge|Grundlage der gesamten&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; Wissenschaftslehre]]'' (''Foundations of the Science of Knowledge'', 1794/1795), ''Versuch einer neuen Darstellung der Wissenschaftslehre'' (''An Attempt a New Presentation of the Wissenschaftslehre'', 1797/1798), and ''Darstellung der Wissenschaftslehre'' (''Presentation of the Wissenschaftslehre'', 1801).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other works===
Fichte also developed a theory of the state based on the idea of self-sufficiency. In his mind, the state should control international relations, the value of money, and remain an [[autarky]].  Because of this necessity to have relations with other rational beings in order to achieve consciousness, Fichte writes that there must be a 'relation of right', in which there is a mutual recognition of rationality by both parties.

===Nationalism===
Between December 1807 and March 1808, Fichte gave a series of lectures concerning the "German nation" and its culture and language, projecting the kind of national education he hoped would raise it from the humiliation of its defeat at the hands of the French. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Allen|title=Fichte's Ethical Thought |year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having been a supporter of Revolutionary France, Fichte became disenchanted by 1804 as Napoleon's armies advanced through Europe, occupying German territories, stripping them of their raw materials and subjugating them to foreign rule. Consequently, Fichte came to believe Germany would be responsible to carry the virtues of the French Revolution into the future. Furthermore, his nationalism was not aroused by Prussian military defeat and humiliation, for these had not yet occurred, but resulted from devotion to his own humanitarian philosophy. Through disappointment in the French he turned to the German nation as the instrument of fulfilling it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Eugene|title=Nationalism and the Culture Crisis in Prussia: 1806-1815|year=1966|publisher=Octagon Press|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lectures, entitled the ''Addresses to the German Nation'', coincided with a period of reform in the Prussian government, under the chancellorship of [[Baron vom Stein]]. The ''Addresses'' display Fichte's interest during that period in language and culture as vehicles of human spiritual development. Fichte built upon the earlier ideas of [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and attempted to unite them with his more systematic approach. The aim of the German nation, according to Fichte, was to "found an empire of spirit and reason, and to annihilate completely the crude physical force that rules of the world."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fichte|first=Johann Gottlieb|title=Addresses to the German Nation|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=496}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Herder's German nationalism, Fichte's was wholly cultural, and grounded in the aesthetic, literary, and moral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Allen|title=Fichte's Ethical Thought|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nationalism propounded by Fichte in the ''Addresses'' would be appealed to over a century later by the Nazi Party in Germany, which sought in Fichte a forerunner to its own nationalist ideology. Like [[Nietzsche]], the association of Fichte with the Nazi regime came to colour readings of Fichte's German nationalism in the post-war period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Rohan|title=The Roots of National Socialism|year=1941|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|page=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reading of Fichte was often bolstered through reference to an unpublished letter from 1793, ''Contributions to the Correction of the Public's Judgment concerning the French Revolution'', wherein Fichte expressed anti-semitic sentiments, such as arguing against extending civil rights to Jews and calling them a "state within a state" that could "undermine" the German nation.&lt;ref name="Gesamtausgabe I/1 pp. 292"&gt;''Gesamtausgabe'', I/1, pp.&amp;nbsp;292–293&lt;/ref&gt; However, attached to the letter is a footnote in which Fichte provides an impassioned plea for permitting Jews to practice their religion without hindrance. Furthermore, the final act of Fichte's academic career was to resign as rector of Humboldt University in protest when his colleagues refused to punish the harassment of Jewish students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Allen|title=Fichte's Ethical Thought|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; While recent scholarship has sought to dissociate Fichte's writings on nationalism with his adoption by the Nazi Party, the association continues to blight his legacy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Allen|title=Fichte's Ethical Thought|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Fichte, as if to exclude all ground of doubt, clearly and distinctly prohibits —&amp;nbsp;in his reworked version of ''The Science of Ethics as Based on the Science of Knowledge'' (see [[#Final period in Berlin|§ Final period in Berlin]])&amp;nbsp;— genocide and other crimes against humanity:

===Women===
Fichte argued that "active citizenship, civic freedom and even property rights should be withheld from women, whose calling was to subject themselves utterly to the authority of their fathers and husbands."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher M. Clark, ''Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600-1947'' (Harvard University Press, 2006: {{ISBN|0-674-02385-4}}), p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final period in Berlin==
[[File:Dorotheenst Friedhof Fichte.jpg|thumb|Tombs of Johann Gottlieb Fichte and his wife Johanna Marie, [[:de:Friedhof der Dorotheenstädtischen und Friedrichswerderschen Gemeinden|Dorotheenstaedtischer Friedhof]] (cemetery), Berlin]]
Fichte gave a wide range of public and private lectures in Berlin from the last decade of his life. These form some of his best known work, and are the basis of a revived German-speaking scholarly interest in his work.&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;Breazeale, Dan, "Johann Gottlieb Fichte", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL: &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2012/entries/johann-fichte/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lectures include two works from 1806. In ''The Characteristics of the Present Age'' (''Die Grundzüge des gegenwärtigen Zeitalters''), Fichte outlines his theory of different historical and cultural epochs. His mystic work ''The Way Towards the Blessed Life'' (''Die Anweisung zum seligen Leben oder auch die Religionslehre'') gave his fullest thoughts on religion. In 1808 he gave a series of speeches in French-occupied Berlin, ''Addresses to the German Nation''.

In 1810, the new [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] was set up, designed along lines put forward by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]. Fichte was made its rector and also the first Chair of Philosophy. This was in part because of educational themes in the ''Addresses'', and in part because of his earlier work at Jena University.

Fichte lectured on further versions of his ''Wissenschaftslehre''. Of these, he only published a brief work from 1810, ''The Science of Knowledge in its General Outline'' (''Die Wissenschaftslehre, in ihrem allgemeinen Umrisse dargestellt''; also translated as ''Outline of the Doctrine of Knowledge''). His son published some of these thirty years after his death.

Most only became public in the last decades of the twentieth century, in his collected works.&lt;ref&gt;''Gesamtausgabe der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften'', approx. 40 volumes. Edited by {{ill|Reinhard Lauth|de}}, Erich Fuchs, Hans Gliwitzky, Ives Radrizzani, Günter Zöller, et al., Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; This included reworked versions of the ''Doctrine of Science'' (''Wissenschaftslehre'', 1810–1813), ''The Science of Rights'' (''Das System der Rechtslehre'', 1812), and ''The Science of Ethics as Based on the Science of Knowledge'' (''Das System der Sittenlehre nach den Principien der Wissenschaftslehre'', 1812; 1st ed. 1798).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3880">This '''list of publications by John Dewey''' complements the partial list at the [[John Dewey]] article.

Dewey (1859&amp;ndash;1952) was an [[United States|American]] [[philosopher]], [[psychologist]], and [[school reform|educational reformer]], whose thoughts and ideas have been greatly influential in the [[United States]] and around the world.

He was a prolific writer and, over a career spanning some 65 years, his output was extraordinary, covering a wide range of topics. 

The full collection of his writings, making up 37 volumes, has been edited by JoAnn Boydston for the [[Southern Illinois University Press]] ([[Carbondale, Illinois]]), as follows: 

# ''The Early Works, 1882–1898'' (5 volumes)
# ''The Middle Works, 1899–1924'' (15 volumes)

'''John Maynard Keynes, 1st Baron Keynes'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB |last= Cairncross |first= Alec |title= Keynes, John Maynard, Baron Keynes (1883–1946) |id= 34310}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{post-nominals |country= GBR|CB|FBA}} ({{IPAc-en |k|eɪ|n|z}} {{respell |KAYNZ}}; 5 June 1883 – 21 April 1946), was a British [[economist]] whose ideas fundamentally changed the theory and practice of [[macroeconomics]] and the [[economic policies]] of governments. He built on and greatly refined earlier work on the causes of [[business cycle]]s, and was one of the most influential economists of the 20th century.{{sfn |Yergin|Stanislaw|2002 |pp= 39–42}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= John |last=Sloman |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7682887.stm |title= How to kick-start a faltering economy the Keynes way |publisher= [[BBC]] | date= 22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Cohn |first=Steven Mark|title= Reintroducing Macroeconomics: A Critical Approach: A Critical Approach |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bZ5sBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1 |year= 2015|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn= 978-1-317-46120-3 |page= 111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Davis |first1= William L. |first2= Bob |last2=Figgins |first3= David |last3=Hedengren |first4= Daniel B. |last4= Klein |title= Economic Professors' Favorite Economic Thinkers, Journals, and Blogs |work= [[Econ Journal Watch]] |volume= 8 |issue=2 |pages= 126–46 |date=May 2011 |url= https://econjwatch.org/file_download/487/DavisMay2011.pdf?mimetype=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widely considered the founder of modern macroeconomics, his ideas are the basis for the [[schools of economic thought |school of thought]] known as [[Keynesian economics]], and its various offshoots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Skidelsky |first1=Robert |title=Keynes: The Return of the Master |date=26 October 2010 |publisher=Public affairs |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-1-58648-897-0 |accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, Keynes spearheaded [[Keynesian Revolution|a revolution in economic thinking]], challenging the ideas of [[neoclassical economics]] that held that [[free market]]s would, in the short to medium term, automatically provide full employment, as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands. He instead argued that [[aggregate demand]] determined the overall level of economic activity and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high [[unemployment]]. Keynes advocated the use of [[fiscal policy|fiscal]] and [[monetary policy|monetary]] policies to mitigate the adverse effects of economic [[recession]]s and [[depression (economics)|depressions]]. Keynes's magnum opus, ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', was published in 1936.

The leading Western economies adopted Keynes's policy recommendations before the outbreak of [[World War II]], and in the two decades following Keynes's death in 1946, almost all [[capitalism|capitalist]] governments had done so. Keynes's influence waned in the 1970s, partly as a result of the [[stagflation]] that plagued the [[Anglo-America]]n economies during that decade, and partly because of criticism of Keynesian policies by [[Milton Friedman]] and other [[Monetarism|monetarist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krugman|first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Krugman|title=Peddling Prosperity: Economic Sense and Nonsense in the Age of Diminished Expectations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GcmvijkDrEcC&amp;pg=PA43|year=1995|publisher=W.W.

The advent of the global [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]] caused a [[2008–09 Keynesian resurgence|resurgence in Keynesian thought]]. Keynesian economics provided the theoretical underpinning for economic policies undertaken in response to the crisis by President [[Barack Obama]] of the United States, Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] of the United Kingdom, and other heads of governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c4cf37f4-d611-11dd-a9cc-000077b07658.html |title= The undeniable shift to Keynes |work=Financial Times |author=Chris Giles in London, Ralph Atkins in Frankfurt and Krishna Guha in Washington |accessdate=23 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine included Keynes among its [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|Most Important People of the Century]] in 1999, it said that "his radical idea that governments should spend money they don't have may have saved capitalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990614,00.html |title= The Time 100: John Maynard Keynes |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |first=Robert |last=Reich |date=29 March 1999 |accessdate=18 June 2009 |authorlink= Robert Reich}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Economist]]'' has  described Keynes  as "Britain's most famous 20th-century economist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21577382-chancellor-likely-ignore-imfs-advice-toothless-truth-tellers |title=The IMF in Britain: Toothless truth tellers |work=[[The Economist]] |date= 11 May 2013 |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being an economist, Keynes was also a civil servant, a director of the [[Bank of England]], and a part of the [[Bloomsbury Group]] of intellectuals.&lt;ref name="The Bloomsbury Group"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://therem.net/bloom-maynard.htm |title= Maynard Keynes  |publisher= The Bloomsbury Group |date= 22 August 2007 |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
[[Image:KingsCollegeChapelWest.jpg|thumb| [[King's College, Cambridge]]. Keynes's grandmother wrote to him saying that, since he was born in Cambridge, people will expect him to be clever.]]

John Maynard Keynes was born in [[Cambridge]], [[Cambridgeshire]], [[England]], to an upper-middle-class family. His father, [[John Neville Keynes]], was an economist and a lecturer in [[moral science]]s at the University of Cambridge and his mother [[Florence Ada Keynes]] a local social reformer. Keynes was the first born, and was followed by two more children – Margaret Neville Keynes in 1885 and [[Geoffrey Keynes]] in 1887. Geoffrey became a surgeon and Margaret married the Nobel Prize-winning physiologist [[Archibald Hill]].

According to the  [[economic historian]] and biographer [[Robert Skidelsky]], Keynes's parents were loving and attentive. They remained in the same house throughout their lives, where the children were always welcome to return. Keynes would receive considerable support from his father, including expert coaching to help him pass his scholarship exams and financial help both as a young man and when his assets were nearly wiped out at the onset of [[Great Depression]] in 1929. Keynes's mother made her children's interests her own, and according to Skidelsky, "because she could grow up with her children, they never outgrew home".&lt;ref name="SkidelP1" &gt;
{{cite book |last=Skidelsky |first=Robert |title=John Maynard Keynes: 1883–1946: Economist, Philosopher, Statesman |year=2003 |isbn=0330488678 |pages= 14, 43–46, 456, 263, 834|publisher=Pan MacMillan Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1889 at the age of five and a half, Keynes started at the kindergarten of the [[Perse School for Girls]] for five mornings a week. He quickly showed a talent for arithmetic, but his health was poor leading to several long absences. He was tutored at home by a governess, Beatrice Mackintosh, and his mother. In January 1892, at eight and a half, he started as a day pupil at [[St Faith's School|St Faith's]] preparatory school. By 1894, Keynes was top of his class and excelling at mathematics. In 1896, St Faith's headmaster, Ralph Goodchild, wrote that Keynes was "head and shoulders above all the other boys in the school" and was confident that Keynes could get a scholarship to Eton.&lt;ref&gt;'''Sources''':

In 1897, Keynes won a scholarship to [[Eton College]], where he displayed talent in a wide range of subjects, particularly mathematics, [[classics]] and history. At Eton, Keynes experienced the first "love of his life" in Dan Macmillan, older brother of the future Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]].&lt;ref name=Supermac&gt;
{{Cite book |title= Supermac: The Life of Harold Macmillan |last= Thorpe|first= D.R.|page= 27 |publisher=[[Chatto &amp; Windus]] |year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his middle-class background, Keynes mixed easily with upper-class pupils. 

In 1902 Keynes left Eton for [[King's College, Cambridge]], after receiving a scholarship for this also to read mathematics. [[Alfred Marshall]] begged Keynes to become an economist,&lt;ref&gt;

although Keynes's own inclinations drew him towards philosophy – especially the ethical system of [[G. E. Moore]]. Keynes joined the [[Pitt Club]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moggridge|first=Donald Edward|title=Maynard Keynes: An Economist's Biography|year=1992|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxford|isbn=9781134798667|pages=52–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was an active member of the semi-secretive [[Cambridge Apostles]] society, a debating club largely reserved for the brightest students. Like many members, Keynes retained a bond to the club after graduating and continued to attend occasional meetings throughout his life. Before leaving Cambridge, Keynes became the President of the [[Cambridge Union Society]] and [[Cambridge University Liberal Club]]. He was said to be an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=s3qqM3B_920C&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=John+Maynard+Keynes+atheist#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20Maynard%20Keynes%20atheist&amp;f=false|title=Essays on John Maynard Keynes|last=Keynes|first=Milo|date=1979-11-29|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521296960|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sgpb7PBClmUC&amp;pg=PT24&amp;dq=John+Maynard+Keynes+atheist#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20Maynard%20Keynes%20atheist&amp;f=false|title=Humanism: A Beginner's Guide|last=Cave|first=Peter|date=2009-03-01|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=9781780740294|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1904, he received a first class BA in mathematics. Aside from a few months spent on holidays with family and friends, Keynes continued to involve himself with the university over the next two years. He took part in debates, further studied philosophy and attended economics lectures informally as a graduate student for one term, which constituted his only formal education in the subject. He took civil service exams in 1906.

The economist [[Harry Gordon Johnson|Harry Johnson]] wrote that the optimism imparted by Keynes's early life is a key to understanding his later thinking.&lt;ref&gt;

Keynes's optimism was also cultural, in two senses: he was of the last generation raised by an empire still at the height of its power, and was also of the last generation who felt entitled to govern by culture, rather than by expertise. According to [[Skidelsky]], the sense of cultural unity current in Britain from the 19th century to the end of [[World War I]] provided a framework with which the well-educated could set various spheres of knowledge in relation to each other and to life, enabling them to confidently draw from different fields when addressing practical problems.&lt;ref name = "SkidelP1" /&gt;

==Career==
In October 1906, Keynes's [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Civil Service]] career began as a clerk in the [[India Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=11879|date=6 November 1906  |page=1124}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed his work at first, but by 1908 had become bored and resigned his position to return to Cambridge and work on [[probability theory]], at first privately funded only by two [[University don|dons]] at the university – his father and the economist [[Arthur Cecil Pigou|Arthur Pigou]].

By 1909 Keynes had published his first professional economics article in ''The Economic Journal'', about the effect of a recent global economic downturn on India.{{r|"Minksky"}} He founded the [[Political Economy Club (1909)|Political Economy Club]], a weekly discussion group. Also in 1909, Keynes accepted a lectureship in economics funded personally by [[Alfred Marshall]]. Keynes's earnings rose further as he began to take on pupils for private tuition.

In 1911 Keynes was made editor of ''[[The Economic Journal]]''. By 1913 he had published his first book, ''Indian Currency and Finance''.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite journal|last=Keynes|first=John Maynard|year=1913 |title=Indian Currency and Finance|publisher=Macmillan &amp; Co.|place=London|url= https://archive.org/stream/indiancurrencyan014875mbp#page/n3/mode/2up |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then appointed to the [[Royal Commission]] on Indian Currency and Finance&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28711|page=2809|date=18 April 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; – the same topic as his book – where Keynes showed considerable talent at applying economic theory to practical problems. His written work was published under the name "J M Keynes", though to his family and friends he was known as Maynard. (His father, John Neville Keynes, was also always known by his middle name).&lt;ref name = "clarke" /&gt;

===First World War===

The British Government called on Keynes's expertise during the [[World War I|First World War]]. While he did not formally re-join the civil service in 1914, Keynes travelled to London at the government's request a few days before hostilities started. Bankers had been pushing for the suspension of [[Hard money (policy)|specie]] payments – the [[convertibility]] of [[banknotes]] into gold – but with Keynes's help the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] (then [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]]) was persuaded that this would be a bad idea, as it would hurt the future reputation of the city if payments were suspended before it was absolutely necessary.

In January 1915, Keynes took up an official government position at the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]]. Among his responsibilities were the design of terms of credit between Britain and its continental allies during the war, and the acquisition of scarce currencies. According to economist [[Robert Lekachman]], Keynes's "nerve and mastery became legendary" because of his performance of these duties, as in the case where he managed to assemble – with difficulty – a small supply of Spanish [[Spanish peseta|peseta]]s.

The secretary of the Treasury was delighted to hear Keynes had amassed enough to provide a temporary solution for the British Government. But Keynes did not hand the pesetas over, choosing instead to sell them all to break the market: his boldness paid off, as pesetas then became much less scarce and expensive.&lt;ref&gt;

On the introduction of [[military conscription]] in 1916 he applied for exemption as a [[conscientious objector]], which was effectively granted conditional upon continuing his government work.

In the 1917 King's [[Birthday Honours]], Keynes was appointed [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] for his wartime work,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30111 |supp=y|page=5456|date=1 June 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his success led to the appointment that would have a huge effect on Keynes's life and career; Keynes was appointed financial representative for the Treasury to the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles peace conference]]. He was also appointed Officer of the Belgian [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31928 |supp=y|page=6175|date=1 June 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Versailles peace conference===
{{Main article|Heavenly Twins (Sumner and Cunliffe)}}

[[Image:David Lloyd George 1902.jpg|thumb|Keynes's colleague, [[David Lloyd George]]. Keynes was initially wary of the "Welsh Wizard," preferring his rival [[H. H. Asquith|Asquith]], but was impressed with Lloyd George at Versailles; this did not prevent Keynes from painting a scathing picture of the then-prime minister in his ''[[The Economic Consequences of the Peace|Economic Consequences of the Peace]]''.]]

Keynes's experience at [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] was influential in shaping his future outlook, yet it was not a successful one for him. Keynes's main interest had been in trying to prevent [[World War I reparations|Germany's compensation payments]] being set so high it would traumatise innocent German people, damage the nation's ability to pay and sharply limit her ability to buy exports from other countries – thus hurting not just Germany's own economy but that of the wider world.

Unfortunately for Keynes, conservative powers in the coalition that emerged from the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|1918 coupon election]] were able to ensure that both Keynes himself and the Treasury were largely excluded from formal high-level talks concerning reparations. Their place was taken by the [[Heavenly Twins (Sumner and Cunliffe)|Heavenly Twins]] – the judge [[John Hamilton, 1st Viscount Sumner|Lord Sumner]] and the banker [[Walter Cunliffe, 1st Baron Cunliffe|Lord Cunliffe]] whose nickname derived from the "astronomically" high war compensation they wanted to demand from Germany. Keynes was forced to try to exert influence mostly from behind the scenes.

The three principal players at Versailles were Britain's Lloyd George, France's [[Georges Clemenceau|Clemenceau]] and America's [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]].&lt;ref name = "origins"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
It was only Lloyd George to whom Keynes had much direct access; until the 1918 election he had some sympathy with Keynes's view but while campaigning had found his speeches were only well received by the public if he promised to harshly punish Germany, and had therefore committed his delegation to extracting high payments.

Lloyd George did however win some loyalty from Keynes with his actions at the Paris conference by intervening against the French to ensure the dispatch of much-needed food supplies to German civilians. Clemenceau also pushed for substantial reparations, though not as high as those proposed by the British, while on security grounds, France argued for an even more severe settlement than Britain.

Wilson initially favoured relatively lenient treatment of Germany – he feared too harsh conditions could foment the rise of extremism, and wanted Germany to be left sufficient capital to pay for imports. To Keynes's dismay, Lloyd George and Clemenceau were able to pressure Wilson to agree to include pensions in the reparations bill.

Towards the end of the conference, Keynes came up with a plan that he argued would not only help Germany and other impoverished central European powers but also be good for the world economy as a whole. It involved the radical writing down of war debts, which would have had the possible effect of increasing international trade all round, but at the same time thrown the entire cost of European reconstruction on the United States.

Lloyd George agreed it might be acceptable to the British electorate. However, America was against the plan; the US was then the largest creditor, and by this time Wilson had started to believe in the merits of a harsh peace and thought that his country had already made excessive sacrifices. Hence despite his best efforts, the end result of the conference was a treaty which disgusted Keynes both on moral and economic grounds, and led to his resignation from the Treasury.&lt;ref name="Skidel20s" &gt;

In June 1919 he turned down an offer to become chairman of the [[British Bank of Northern Commerce]], a job that promised a salary of £2000 in return for a morning per week of work.

Keynes's analysis on the predicted damaging effects of the treaty appeared in the highly influential book, ''[[The Economic Consequences of the Peace]]'', published in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policonomics.com/keynes/ |title=John Maynard Keynes |publisher=Policonomics |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work has been described as Keynes's best book, where he was able to bring all his gifts to bear – his passion as well as his skill as an economist. In addition to economic analysis, the book contained pleas to the reader's sense of [[compassion]]:

{{quote|I cannot leave this subject as though its just treatment wholly depended either on our own pledges or on economic facts. The policy of reducing Germany to servitude for a generation, of degrading the lives of millions of human beings, and of depriving a whole nation of happiness should be abhorrent and detestable, –abhorrent and detestable, even if it were possible, even if it enriched ourselves, even if it did not sow the decay of the whole civilised life of Europe.}}

Also present was striking imagery such as "year by year Germany must be kept impoverished and her children starved and crippled" along with bold predictions which were later justified by events:

{{quote|text=If we aim deliberately at the impoverishment of Central Europe, vengeance, I dare predict, will not limp. Nothing can then delay for very long that final war between the forces of Reaction and the despairing convulsions of Revolution, before which the horrors of the late German war will fade into nothing.}}

Keynes's followers assert that his predictions of disaster were borne out when the German economy suffered the [[Inflation in the Weimar republic|hyperinflation of 1923]], and again by the collapse of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the outbreak of the Second World War. However the historian [[Ruth Henig]] claims that "most historians of the Paris peace conference now take the view that, in economic terms, the treaty was not unduly harsh on Germany and that, while obligations and damages were inevitably much stressed in the debates at Paris to satisfy electors reading the daily newspapers, the intention was quietly to give Germany substantial help towards paying her bills, and to meet many of the German objections by amendments to the way the reparations schedule was in practice carried out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Henig|first=Ruth|title=Versailles and After, 1919-1933|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqInX6qQPyUC&amp;pg=PA65|edition=second|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-79873-5|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Sally |last=Marks |title=Mistakes and Myths: The Allies, Germany, and the Versailles Treaty, 1918–1921 |journal=[[The Journal of Modern History]] |date=September 2013 |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=632 |jstor=10.1086/670825 |doi=10.1086/670825 |quote=For nearly forty years, historians of twentieth-century diplomacy have argued that the Versailles treaty was more reasonable than its reputation suggests and that it did not of itself cause the Depression, the rise of Hitler, or World War II" (p. 632). Marks also claims that the book is a "brilliant but warped polemic" (p. 636) that is "long discredited by scholars" and which Keynes regretted writing (p. 656).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a small fraction of reparations were ever paid. In fact, the historian Stephen Schuker demonstrates in ''American 'Reparations' to Germany, 1919–33'', that the capital inflow from American loans substantially exceeded German outpayments so that, on a net basis, Germany received support equal to four times the amount of the post-Second World War [[Marshall Plan]].

Schuker also shows that, in the years after Versailles, Keynes became an informal reparations adviser to the German government, wrote one of the major German reparation notes, and actually supported the hyperinflation on political grounds.  Nevertheless, ''The Economic Consequences of the Peace'' gained Keynes international fame, even though it also caused him to be regarded as anti-establishment – it was not until after the outbreak of the Second World War that Keynes was offered a directorship of a major British Bank, or an acceptable offer to return to government with a formal job. However, Keynes was still able to influence government policy making through his network of contacts, his published works and by serving on government committees; this included attending high-level policy meetings as a consultant.&lt;ref name="Skidel20s" /&gt;

===In the 1920s===
[[Image:Gold Bars.jpg|thumb|right| Keynes argued against a return to the [[gold standard]] at parity with pre-war sterling valuation after [[World War I]]]]
Keynes had completed his ''[[A Treatise on Probability]]'' before the war, but published it in 1921.&lt;ref name="Skidel20s" /&gt; The work was a notable contribution to the philosophical and mathematical underpinnings of [[probability theory]], championing the important view that ''probabilities'' were no more or less than [[truth value]]s intermediate between simple truth and falsity. Keynes developed the first upper-lower probabilistic [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] approach to probability in chapters 15 and 17 of this book, as well as having developed the first decision weight approach with his conventional coefficient of risk and weight, ''c'', in chapter 26. In addition to his academic work, the 1920s saw Keynes active as a journalist selling his work internationally and working in London as a financial consultant. In 1924 Keynes wrote an obituary for his former tutor
[[Alfred Marshall]] which [[Joseph Schumpeter]] called "the most brilliant life of a man of science I have ever read."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Marshall's widow was "entranced" by the memorial, while [[Lytton Strachey]] rated it as one of Keynes's "best works".&lt;ref name="Skidel20s" /&gt;

In 1922 Keynes continued to advocate reduction of German reparations with ''A Revision of the Treaty''.&lt;ref name="Skidel20s" /&gt; He attacked the post-World War I deflation policies with ''A Tract on Monetary Reform'' in 1923&lt;ref name="Skidel20s" /&gt; – a trenchant argument that countries should target stability of domestic prices, avoiding deflation even at the cost of allowing their currency to depreciate. Britain suffered from high unemployment through most of the 1920s, leading Keynes to recommend the depreciation of [[Pound sterling|sterling]] to boost jobs by making British exports more affordable. From 1924 he was also advocating a fiscal response, where the government could create jobs by spending on public works.&lt;ref name="Skidel20s" /&gt; During the 1920s Keynes's pro stimulus views had only limited effect on policy makers and mainstream academic opinion – according to [[Hyman Minsky]] one reason was that at this time his theoretical justification was "muddled".&lt;ref name = "Minksky" /&gt; The ''Tract'' had also called for an end to the gold standard. Keynes advised it was no longer a net benefit for countries such as Britain to participate in the [[gold standard]], as it ran counter to the need for domestic policy autonomy. It could force countries to pursue deflationary policies at exactly the time when expansionary measures were called for to address rising unemployment. The Treasury and Bank of England were still in favour of the gold standard and in 1925 they were able to convince the then Chancellor [[Winston Churchill]] to re-establish it, which had a depressing effect on British industry. Keynes responded by writing ''The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill'' and continued to argue against the gold standard until Britain finally abandoned it in 1931.&lt;ref name="Skidel20s" /&gt;

===During the Great Depression===
[[Image:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Depression]] with its periods of worldwide economic hardship formed the backdrop against which the [[Keynesian Revolution]] took place. The image is ''[[Florence Owens Thompson]]'' by photographer [[Dorothea Lange]] taken in March 1936.]]

Keynes had begun a theoretical work to examine the relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="50 greats" /&gt; The work, ''[[A Treatise on Money|Treatise on Money]]'', was published in 1930 in two volumes. A central idea of the work was that if the amount of money being saved exceeds the amount being invested – which can happen if interest rates are too high – then unemployment will rise. This is in part a result of people not wanting to spend too high a proportion of what employers pay out, making it difficult, in aggregate, for employers to make a profit. Another key theme of the book is the unreliability of financial [[index (economics)|indices]] for representing an accurate – or indeed meaningful – indication of general shifts in purchasing power of currencies over time. In particular he criticised the justification of Britain's return to the [[gold standard]] in 1925 at pre-war valuation by reference to the [[wholesale price index]]. He argued that the index understated the effects of changes in the costs of services and of labour. In 1927 he wrote, "We will not have any more crashes in our time."

Keynes was deeply critical of the British government's austerity measures during the [[Great Depression]]. He believed that budget deficits were a good thing, a product of [[recession]]s. He wrote, "For Government borrowing of one kind or another is nature's remedy, so to speak, for preventing business losses from being, in so severe a slump as the present one, so great as to bring production altogether to a standstill."&lt;ref name="Cassidy2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cassidy|first=John|title=The Demand Doctor|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=10 October 2011|url = https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/10/the-demand-doctor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of the Great Depression, in 1933, Keynes published ''The Means to Prosperity'', which contained specific policy recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter-cyclical public spending. ''The Means to Prosperity'' contains one of the first mentions of the [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier effect]]. While it was addressed chiefly to the British Government, it also contained advice for other nations affected by the global recession. A copy was sent to the newly elected President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and other world leaders. The work was taken seriously by both the American and British governments, and according to [[Robert Skidelsky, Baron Skidelsky|Robert Skidelsky]], helped pave the way for the later acceptance of Keynesian ideas, though it had little immediate practical influence. In the 1933 [[London Economic Conference]] opinions remained too diverse for a unified course of action to be agreed upon.&lt;ref name = "Skid30s" &gt;

Keynesian-like policies were adopted by Sweden and Germany, but Sweden was seen as too small to command much attention, and Keynes was deliberately silent about the [[Economy of Nazi Germany#Pre-war economy: 1933–1939|successful efforts of Germany]] as he was dismayed by their imperialist ambitions and their treatment of Jews.&lt;ref name = "Skid30s" /&gt; Apart from Great Britain, Keynes's attention was primarily focused on the United States. In 1931, he received considerable support for his views on counter-cyclical public spending in Chicago, then America's foremost centre for economic views alternative to the mainstream.&lt;ref name = "Minksky" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Skid30s" /&gt; However, orthodox economic opinion remained generally hostile regarding fiscal intervention to mitigate the [[Depression (economics)|depression]], until just before the [[World War II|outbreak of war]].&lt;ref name = "Minksky"/&gt; In late 1933 Keynes was persuaded by [[Felix Frankfurter]] to address President Roosevelt directly, which he did by letters and face to face in 1934, after which the two men spoke highly of each other.&lt;ref name = "Skid30s"/&gt; However, according to Skidelsky, the consensus is that Keynes's efforts only began to have a more than marginal influence on US economic policy after 1939.&lt;ref name = "Skid30s"/&gt;

Keynes's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'' was published in 1936. It was researched and indexed by one of Keynes's favourite students, later the economist [[David Bensusan-Butt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Keith |last=Tribe |title=Economic Careers: Economics and Economists in Britain, 1930–1970 |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |page=61 |isbn=0-415-14708-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The work served as a theoretical justification for the [[Economic interventionism|interventionist policies]] Keynes favoured for tackling a recession. The ''General Theory'' challenged the earlier [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic]] paradigm, which had held that provided it was unfettered by government interference, the market would naturally establish [[full employment]] equilibrium. In doing so Keynes was partly setting himself against his former teachers Marshall and Pigou. Keynes believed the classical theory was a "special case" that applied only to the particular conditions present in the 19th century, his own theory being the general one. Classical economists had believed in [[Say's law]], which, simply put, states that "[[supply creates its own demand]]", and that in a free market workers would always be willing to lower their wages to a level where employers could profitably offer them jobs. An innovation from Keynes was the concept of [[Nominal rigidity|price stickiness]] – the recognition that in reality workers often refuse to lower their wage demands even in cases where a classical economist might argue it is rational for them to do so. Due in part to price stickiness, it was established that the interaction of "[[aggregate demand]]" and "[[aggregate supply]]" may lead to stable unemployment equilibria – and in those cases, it is the state, not the market, that economies must depend on for their salvation.

[[File:Keynes caricature Low 1934.jpg|left|thumb|Caricature by [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]], 1934]]

The ''General Theory'' argues that demand, not supply, is the key variable governing the overall level of economic activity. Aggregate demand, which equals total un-hoarded income in a society, is defined by the sum of consumption and investment. In a state of unemployment and unused production capacity, one can ''only'' enhance employment and total income by ''first'' increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment. Without government intervention to increase expenditure, an economy can remain trapped in a low employment equilibrium – the demonstration of this possibility has been described as the revolutionary formal achievement of the work.&lt;ref name = "SkidelP2" &gt;

The book advocated activist economic policy by government to stimulate demand in times of high unemployment, for example by spending on [[public works]]. "Let us be up and doing, using our idle resources to increase our wealth," he wrote in 1928. "With men and plants unemployed, it is ridiculous to say that we cannot afford these new developments. It is precisely with these plants and these men that we shall afford them."&lt;ref name="Cassidy2011" /&gt;

The ''General Theory'' is often viewed as the foundation of modern [[macroeconomics]]. Few senior American economists agreed with Keynes through most of the 1930s.&lt;ref name = "Hazlit"&gt;

Keynes himself had only limited participation in the theoretical debates that followed the publication of the ''General Theory'' as he suffered a heart attack in 1937, requiring him to take long periods of rest. Among others, [[Hyman Minsky]] and [[Post-Keynesian economics|Post-Keynesian]] economists have argued that as result, Keynes's ideas were diluted by those keen to compromise with classical economists or to render his concepts with mathematical models like the [[IS–LM model]] (which, they argue, distort Keynes's ideas).&lt;ref name="Minksky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="K rev. and critics" /&gt; Keynes began to recover in 1939, but for the rest of his life his professional energies were largely directed towards the practical side of economics – the problems of ensuring optimum allocation of resources for the war efforts, post-war negotiations with America, and the new international financial order that was presented at the [[Bretton Woods Conference]].

In the ''General Theory'' and later, Keynes responded to the socialists and left-wing liberals who argued, especially during the Great Depression of the 1930s, that capitalism caused war. He argued that if capitalism were managed domestically and internationally (with coordinated international Keynesian policies, an international monetary system that didn't pit the interests of countries against each other, and a high degree of freedom of trade), then this system of managed capitalism could promote peace rather than conflict between countries. His plans during World War II for post-war international economic institutions and policies (which contributed to the creation at Bretton Woods of the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]], and later to the creation of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] and eventually the [[World Trade Organization]]) were aimed to give effect to this vision.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Keynes has been widely criticised – especially by members of the [[Chicago school of economics]] – for advocating irresponsible government spending financed by borrowing, in fact he was a firm believer in balanced budgets and regarded the proposals for programs of public works during the Great Depression as an exceptional measure to meet the needs of exceptional circumstances.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Universal Man'' Richard Davenport-Hines Collins 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second World War===
[[Image:WhiteandKeynes.jpg|thumb|right| Keynes (right) and the US representative [[Harry Dexter White]] at the inaugural meeting of the [[International Monetary Fund]]'s Board of Governors in [[Savannah, Georgia]] in 1946]]
During the [[World War II|Second World War]], Keynes argued in ''[[How To Pay For The War|How to Pay for the War]]'', published in 1940, that the war effort should be largely financed by higher taxation and especially by compulsory saving (essentially workers lending money to the government), rather than [[deficit spending]], in order to avoid [[inflation]]. Compulsory saving would act to dampen domestic demand, assist in channelling additional output towards the war efforts, would be fairer than punitive taxation and would have the advantage of helping to avoid a post war slump by boosting demand once workers were allowed to withdraw their savings. In September 1941 he was proposed to fill a vacancy in the Court of Directors of the [[Bank of England]], and subsequently carried out a full term from the following April.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35279|page=5489|date=19 September 1941}}&lt;br /&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35511|page=1540|date=3 April 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1942, Keynes was rewarded for his service with a [[hereditary peer]]age in the King's Birthday Honours.&lt;ref name="TheLondon"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35586|page=2475|date=5 June 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 July his title was [[The London Gazette|gazetted]] as "'''Baron Keynes''', of Tilton, in the County of [[Sussex]]" and he took his seat in the [[House of Lords]] on the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] benches.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35623|page=2987|date=7 July 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory began to look certain, Keynes was heavily involved, as leader of the British delegation and chairman of the [[World Bank]] commission, in the mid-1944 negotiations that established the [[Bretton Woods system]]. The Keynes-plan, concerning an international clearing-union, argued for a radical system for the management of currencies. He proposed the creation of a common world unit of currency, the [[bancor]], and new global institutions – a world [[central bank]] and the [[International Clearing Union]]. Keynes envisaged these institutions managing an international trade and payments system with strong incentives for countries to avoid substantial trade deficits or surpluses.&lt;ref&gt;Marie Christine Duggan (2013) "Taking Back Globalization: A China-United States Counterfactual Using Keynes's 1941 International Clearing Union."

According to US economist [[J. Bradford DeLong]], on almost every point where he was overruled by the Americans, Keynes was later proved correct by events.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The two new institutions, later known as the World Bank and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), were founded as a compromise that primarily reflected the American vision. There would be no incentives for states to avoid a large [[Balance of trade|trade surplus]]; instead, the burden for correcting a trade imbalance would continue to fall only on the [[Deficit spending|deficit]] countries, which Keynes had argued were least able to address the problem without inflicting economic hardship on their populations. Yet, Keynes was still pleased when accepting the final agreement, saying that if the institutions stayed true to their founding principles, "the brotherhood of man will have become more than a phrase."&lt;ref&gt;

===Postwar===
After the war, Keynes continued to represent the United Kingdom in international negotiations despite his deteriorating health. He succeeded in obtaining preferential terms from the United States [[Anglo-American loan|for new and outstanding debts]] to facilitate the rebuilding of the British economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maynardkeynes.org/keynes-career-timeline.html |title=John Maynard Keynes: Career Timeline |publisher=Maynardkeynes.org |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before his death in 1946, Keynes told Henry Clay, a professor of social economics and advisor to the [[Bank of England]],&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; of his hopes that [[Adam Smith]]'s "[[invisible hand]]" could help Britain out of the economic hole it was in: "I find myself more and more relying for a solution of our problems on the invisible hand which I tried to eject from economic thinking twenty years ago."&lt;ref&gt;

===Keynesian ascendancy 1939–79===
{{Main article|Keynesian Revolution}}

From the end of the Great Depression to the mid-1970s, Keynes provided the main inspiration for economic policy makers in Europe, America and much of the rest of the world.&lt;ref name="K rev. and critics"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fletcher|first=Gordon A.|title=Keynesian Revolution and Its Critics: Issues of Theory and Policy for the Monetary Production Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZKawCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88|edition=second|year=1989|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=978-1-349-20108-2|pages=xix–xxi, 88, 189–191, 234–238, 256–261}}&lt;/ref&gt; While economists and policy makers had become increasingly won over to Keynes's way of thinking in the mid and late 1930s, it was only after the outbreak of World War II that governments started to borrow money for spending on a scale sufficient to eliminate unemployment. According to the economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] (then a US government official charged with controlling inflation), in the rebound of the economy from wartime spending, "one could not have had a better demonstration of the Keynesian ideas."&lt;ref name = "Heights1"&gt;

The [[Keynesian Revolution]] was associated with the rise of [[social liberalism|modern liberalism]] in the West during the post-war period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Barry Stewart|title=Political Economy: A Comparative Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3wpiDzS45PsC&amp;pg=pa101|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-95869-5|page=101|quote=Modern liberalism was the dominant ideology in Western nations from the end of World War II until the early 1970s.

Despite his popularity as a war hero, Churchill suffered a landslide defeat to [[Clement Attlee]] whose government's economic policy continued to be influenced by Keynes's ideas.&lt;ref name = "Heights1"/&gt;

====Neo-Keynesian economics====
{{Main article|Neo-Keynesian economics}}
[[Image:Islm.svg|thumb|right|[[Neo-Keynesian economics|Neo-Keynesian]] [[IS–LM model]] is used to analyse the effect of [[demand shock]]s on the economy]]

In the late 1930s and 1940s, economists (notably [[John Hicks]], [[Franco Modigliani]], and [[Paul Samuelson]]) attempted to interpret and formalise Keynes's writings in terms of formal [[mathematical model]]s. In what had become known as the [[neoclassical synthesis]], they combined Keynesian analysis with [[neoclassical economics]] to produce [[neo-Keynesian economics]], which came to dominate [[Mainstream economics|mainstream macroeconomic thought]] for the next 40 years.

By the 1950s, Keynesian policies were adopted by almost the entire developed world and similar measures for a [[mixed economy]] were used by many developing nations. By then, Keynes's views on the economy had become mainstream in the world's universities. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the developed and emerging free capitalist economies enjoyed exceptionally high growth and low unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;

In late 1965 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine ran a cover article with a title comment from [[Milton Friedman]] (later echoed by U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]]), "[[We are all Keynesians now]]". The article described the exceptionally favourable economic conditions then prevailing, and reported that "Washington's economic managers scaled these heights by their adherence to Keynes's central theme: the modern capitalist economy does not automatically work at top efficiency, but can be raised to that level by the intervention and influence of the government." The article also states that Keynes was one of the three most important economists who ever lived, and that his ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money|General Theory]]'' was more influential than the ''magna opera'' of other famous economists, like [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

===Keynesian economics out of favour 1979–2007===
{{Main article|Post-war displacement of Keynesianism}}
Keynesian economics were officially discarded by the British Government in 1979, but forces had begun to gather against Keynes's ideas over 30 years earlier. [[Friedrich Hayek]] had formed the [[Mont Pelerin Society]] in 1947, with the explicit intention of nurturing intellectual currents to one day displace Keynesianism and other similar influences. Its members included the [[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]] along with the then young Milton Friedman. Initially the society had little impact on the wider world – according to Hayek it was as if Keynes had been raised to sainthood after his death and that people refused to allow his work to be questioned.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Friedman however began to emerge as a formidable critic of Keynesian economics from the mid-1950s, and especially after his 1963 publication of ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]''.

On the practical side of economic life, "[[big government]]" had appeared to be firmly entrenched in the 1950s, but the balance began to shift towards the power of private interests in the 1960s. Keynes had written against the folly of allowing "decadent and selfish" speculators and financiers the kind of influence they had enjoyed after World War I. For two decades after World War II the public opinion was strongly against private speculators, the disparaging label "[[Gnomes of Zürich]]" being typical of how they were described during this period. International speculation was severely restricted by the capital controls in place after Bretton Woods. According to the journalists [[Larry Elliott]] and [[Dan Atkinson]], 1968 was the pivotal year when power shifted in favour of private agents such as currency speculators. As the key 1968 event Elliott and Atkinson picked out America's suspension of the conversion of the dollar into gold except on request of foreign governments, which they identified as the beginning of the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system.&lt;ref name="failedgods" &gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticisms of Keynes's ideas had begun to gain significant acceptance by the early 1970s, as they were then able to make a credible case that Keynesian models no longer reflected economic reality. Keynes himself included few formulas and no explicit mathematical models in his ''General Theory''. For economists such as [[Hyman Minsky]], Keynes's limited use of mathematics was partly the result of his scepticism about whether phenomena as inherently uncertain as economic activity could ever be adequately captured by mathematical models. Nevertheless, many models were developed by Keynesian economists, with a famous example being the [[Phillips curve]] which predicted an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. It implied that unemployment could be reduced by government stimulus with a calculable cost to inflation. In 1968, Milton Friedman published a paper arguing that the fixed relationship implied by the Philips curve did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Friedman suggested that sustained Keynesian policies could lead to both unemployment and inflation rising at once – a phenomenon that soon became known as [[stagflation]]. In the early 1970s stagflation appeared in both the US and Britain just as Friedman had predicted, with economic conditions deteriorating further after the [[1973 oil crisis]]. Aided by the prestige gained from his successful forecast, Friedman led increasingly successful criticisms against the Keynesian consensus, convincing not only academics and politicians but also much of the general public with his radio and television broadcasts. The academic credibility of Keynesian economics was further undermined by additional criticism from other [[Monetarism|monetarists]] trained in the [[Chicago school of economics]], by the [[Lucas critique]] and by criticisms from Hayek's Austrian School.&lt;ref name="K rev. and critics" /&gt; So successful were these criticisms that by 1980 [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert Lucas]] claimed economists would often take offence if described as Keynesians.&lt;ref name = "Blinder" &gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Keynesian principles fared increasingly poorly on the practical side of economics – by 1979 they had been displaced by monetarism as the primary influence on Anglo-American economic policy.&lt;ref name="K rev. and critics"/&gt; However, many officials on both sides of the Atlantic retained a preference for Keynes, and in 1984 the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] officially discarded monetarism, after which Keynesian principles made a partial comeback as an influence on policy making.&lt;ref&gt;

Not all academics accepted the criticism against Keynes – Minsky has argued that Keynesian economics had been debased by excessive mixing with neoclassical ideas from the 1950s, and that it was unfortunate that this branch of economics had even continued to be called "Keynesian".&lt;ref name = "Minksky" /&gt; Writing in ''[[The American Prospect]]'', [[Robert Kuttner]] argued it was not so much excessive Keynesian activism that caused the economic problems of the 1970s but the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of [[capital control]]s, which allowed [[capital flight]] from regulated economies into unregulated economies in a fashion similar to [[Gresham's law]] phenomenon (where weak currencies undermine strong currencies).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A more typical response was to accept some elements of the criticisms while refining Keynesian economic theories to defend them against arguments that would invalidate the whole Keynesian framework – the resulting body of work largely composing [[New Keynesian economics]]. In 1992 [[Alan Blinder]] wrote about a "Keynesian Restoration", as work based on Keynes's ideas had to some extent become fashionable once again in academia, though in the mainstream it was highly synthesised with monetarism and other neoclassical thinking. In the world of policy making, [[free market]] influences broadly sympathetic to monetarism have remained very strong at government level – in powerful normative institutions like the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Treasury]], and in prominent opinion-forming media such as the ''[[Financial Times]]'' and ''[[The Economist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Donald Markwell]] argued that in the absence of such an international approach, there would be a risk of worsening international relations and possibly even world war arising from economic factors similar to those present during the depression of the 1930s.&lt;ref name = "MarkwellRelations"/&gt;

By the end of December 2008, the ''Financial Times'' reported that "the sudden resurgence of Keynesian policy is a stunning reversal of the orthodoxy of the past several decades."&lt;ref&gt;

In December 2008, Paul Krugman released his book ''[[The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008]]'', arguing that economic conditions similar to what existed during the earlier part of the 20th century had returned, making Keynesian policy prescriptions more relevant than ever. In February 2009 [[Robert J. Shiller]] and [[George Akerlof]] published ''[[Animal Spirits: How Human Psychology Drives the Economy, and Why It Matters for Global Capitalism|Animal Spirits]]'', a book where they argue the current US stimulus package is too small as it does not take into account Keynes's insight on the importance of confidence and expectations in determining the future behaviour of [[Businessperson|businesspeople]] and other economic agents.

In the March 2009 speech entitled ''Reform the International Monetary System'', [[Zhou Xiaochuan]], the governor of the [[People's Bank of China]], came out in favour of Keynes's idea of a centrally managed global reserve currency. Zhou argued that it was unfortunate that part of the reason for the Bretton Woods system breaking down was the failure to adopt Keynes's [[bancor]]. Zhou proposed a gradual move towards increased use of IMF [[special drawing rights]] (SDRs).&lt;ref&gt;

Although Zhou's ideas had not been broadly accepted, leaders meeting in April at the [[2009 G-20 London summit]] agreed to allow $250 billion of special drawing rights to be created by the IMF, to be distributed globally. Stimulus plans were credited for contributing to a better than expected economic outlook by both the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]&lt;ref&gt;

expressed concern over the potential impact on inflation, national debt and the risk that a too large stimulus will create an unsustainable recovery.

Among professional economists the revival of Keynesian economics has been even more divisive. Although many economists, such as George Akerlof, Paul Krugman, Robert Shiller, and Joseph Stiglitz, supported Keynesian stimulus, others did not believe higher government spending would help the United States economy recover from the [[Great Recession]]. Some economists, such as [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert Lucas]], questioned the theoretical basis for stimulus packages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/printedition/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14030288 |title= The other-worldly philosophers |accessdate=20 July 2009 |date = 16 July 2009 |work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like [[Robert Barro]] and [[Gary Becker]], say that [[empirical evidence]] for beneficial effects from Keynesian stimulus does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J.

==Reception and views==

===Praise===

Keynes's economic thinking only began to achieve close to universal acceptance in the last few years of his life. On a personal level, Keynes's charm was such that he was generally well received wherever he went – even those who found themselves on the wrong side of his occasionally sharp tongue rarely bore a grudge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McCann | first = Charles Robert | title = John Maynard Keynes – critical responses | year = 1998 | volume = 4 | page = 21 | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | isbn = 0-415-15193-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Keynes's speech at the closing of the Bretton Woods negotiations was received with a lasting standing ovation, rare in international relations, as the delegates acknowledged the scale of his achievements made despite poor health.&lt;ref name="Cunningham"/&gt;

Austrian School economist [[Friedrich Hayek]] was Keynes's most prominent contemporary critic, with sharply opposing views on the economy.&lt;ref name = "SkidelP2" /&gt; Yet after Keynes's death, he wrote: "He was the one really great man I ever knew, and for whom I had unbounded admiration. The world will be a very much poorer place without him."&lt;ref name="Wapshott2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wapshott|first=Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas Wapshott|title=Keynes Hayek: The Clash that Defined Modern Economics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=su1OvQrGVAAC&amp;pg=PA206|year=2011|publisher=W. W. Norton|isbn=978-0-393-08311-8|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lionel Robbins]], former head of the economics department at the [[London School of Economics]], who engaged in many heated debates with Keynes in the 1930s, had this to say after observing Keynes in early negotiations with the Americans while drawing up plans for Bretton Woods:&lt;ref name = "SkidelP2" /&gt;

{{quote|This went very well indeed. Keynes was in his most lucid and persuasive mood: and the effect was irresistible. At such moments, I often find myself thinking that Keynes must be one of the most remarkable men that have ever lived – the quick logic, the birdlike swoop of intuition, the vivid fancy, the wide vision, above all the incomparable sense of the fitness of words, all combine to make something several degrees beyond the limit of ordinary human achievement. }}

[[Douglas LePan]],&lt;ref name = "SkidelP2" /&gt; an official from the [[High Commission of Canada to the United Kingdom|Canadian High Commission]], wrote:

{{quote|I am spellbound. This is the most beautiful creature I have ever listened to. Does he belong to our species? Or is he from some other order? There is something mythic and fabulous about him. I sense in him something massive and sphinx like, and yet also a hint of wings. }}

{{quote|Keynes's intellect was the sharpest and clearest that I have ever known. When I argued with him, I felt that I took my life in my hands, and I seldom emerged without feeling something of a fool.}}

Keynes's obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' included the comment: "There is the man himself – radiant, brilliant, effervescent, gay, full of impish jokes ... He was a humane man genuinely devoted to the cause of the common good."&lt;ref name="new economics"/&gt;

===Critiques===

As a man of the centre described by some as having the greatest impact of any 20th-century economist,&lt;ref name="50 greats" /&gt; Keynes attracted considerable criticism from both sides of the political spectrum. In the 1920s, Keynes was seen as anti-establishment and was mainly attacked from the right. In the "red 1930s", many young economists favoured [[Marxism|Marxist]] views, even in Cambridge,&lt;ref name = "Minksky"/&gt; and while Keynes was engaging principally with the right to try to persuade them of the merits of more progressive policy, the most vociferous criticism against him came from the left, who saw him as a supporter of capitalism. From the 1950s and onwards, most of the attacks against Keynes have again been from the right.

[[File:Friedrich Hayek portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich Hayek]], one of Keynes's most prominent critics]]

In 1931 [[Friedrich Hayek]] extensively critiqued Keynes's 1930 ''Treatise on Money''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://www.mises.org/etexts/reflections.pdf | accessdate = 20 May 2008 | title = Reflections on the Pure Theory of Money of Mr. J.M. Keynes |journal=[[Economica]] |author=Hayek, Friedrick August von | volume = 11 | date = August 1931 | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; After reading Hayek's ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', Keynes wrote to Hayek&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hoover | first = Kenneth R. | title = Economics as Ideology | publisher = [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] | year = 2008 | location = [[Lanham, Maryland]] | page = 152 | isbn = 0-7425-3113-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Morally and philosophically I find myself in agreement with virtually the whole of it", but concluded the letter with the recommendation: {{quote|What we need therefore, in my opinion, is not a change in our economic programmes, which would only lead in practice to disillusion with the results of your philosophy; but perhaps even the contrary, namely, an enlargement of them. Your greatest danger is the probable practical failure of the application of your philosophy in the United States.}} On the pressing issue of the time, whether deficit spending could lift a country from depression, Keynes replied to Hayek's criticism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Heilbroner, Robert | title = [[The Worldly Philosophers]] | year = 2000 | pages = 278–8 | isbn = 0-671-63482-8 | authorlink = Robert Heilbroner }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the following way:

{{quote|I should... conclude rather differently. I should say that what we want is not no planning, or even less planning, indeed I should say we almost certainly want more. But the planning should take place in a community in which as many people as possible, both leaders and followers wholly share your own moral position. Moderate planning will be safe enough if those carrying it out are rightly oriented in their own minds and hearts to the moral issue.}}

Asked why Keynes expressed "moral and philosophical" agreement with Hayek's ''Road to Serfdom'', Hayek stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 20 May 2008 | url = http://reason.com/hayekint.shtml | title = The Road from Serfdom | work = [[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] | date = July 1992 | last1 = Hazlett |first1 = Thomas W. | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081013182404/http://reason.com/hayekint.shtml|archivedate=13 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Because he believed that he was fundamentally still a classical English liberal and wasn't quite aware of how far he had moved away from it. His basic ideas were still those of individual freedom. He did not think systematically enough to see the conflicts. He was, in a sense, corrupted by political necessity.}}

According to some observers,{{who|date=November 2016}} Hayek felt that the post-World War II "Keynesian orthodoxy" gave too much power to the state, and that such policies would lead toward socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Dransfield |first1 = Robert | last2 = Dransfield | first2 = Don | title = Key Ideas in Economics | publisher = Nelson Thornes | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-7487-7081-X | page = 81 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Milton Friedman]] described ''The General Theory'' as "a great book", he argues that its implicit separation of [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal from real magnitudes]] is neither possible nor desirable. Macroeconomic policy, Friedman argues, can reliably influence only the nominal.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_quarterly/1997/spring/friedman | title=John Maynard Keynes | publisher=[[Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond]] | date=Spring 1997 | author=Friedman, Milton | journal=Economic Quarterly | volume=83/2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and other monetarists have consequently argued that [[Keynesian economics]] can result in [[stagflation]], the combination of low growth and high inflation that developed economies suffered in the early 1970s. More to Friedman's taste was the ''Tract on Monetary Reform'' (1923), which he regarded as Keynes's best work because of its focus on maintaining domestic price stability.&lt;ref name="Friedman" /&gt;

[[Joseph Schumpeter]] was an economist of the same age as Keynes and one of his main rivals. He was among the first reviewers to argue that Keynes's ''General Theory'' was not a general theory, but in fact a special case.&lt;ref name = "HarvardPeter"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/5626.html | title =  Dividends from Schumpeter's Noble Failure | publisher = Harvard Business School | author = Thomas K. McCraw | date = 7 February 2009 | accessdate = 21 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said the work expressed "the attitude of a decaying civilisation". After Keynes's death Schumpeter wrote a brief biographical piece ''Keynes the Economist'' – on a personal level he was very positive about Keynes as a man, praising his pleasant nature, courtesy and kindness. He assessed some of Keynes's biographical and editorial work as among the best he'd ever seen. Yet Schumpeter remained critical about Keynes's economics, linking Keynes's childlessness to what Schumpeter saw as an essentially short term view. He considered Keynes to have a kind of unconscious patriotism that caused him to fail to understand the problems of other nations. For Schumpeter "Practical Keynesianism is a seedling which cannot be transplanted into foreign soil: it dies there and becomes poisonous as it dies."&lt;ref name="Schumpeter" &gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=jTDo58DZi1cC&amp;dq=The+New+Economics:+Keynes'+Influence+on+Theory+and+Public+Policy&amp;printsec=frontcover | title =  The New Economics: Keynes's Influence on Theory and Public Policy | publisher =  and Kessinger Publishing | author = Symour E Harris | author2 = Joseph Schumpter |trans-title=Keynes the Economist by Schumpter | pages = 73–101 | isbn = 978-1-4191-4534-6 | date = 1 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Harry S. Truman]] was skeptical of Keynesian theorizing: "Nobody can ever convince me that government can spend a dollar that it's not got," he told [[Leon Keyserling]], a Keynesian economist who chaired Truman's [[Council of Economic Advisers]].&lt;ref name="Cassidy2011" /&gt;

===Views on race===

Keynes sometimes explained the mass murder that took place during the first years of [[communism|communist]] Russia on a racial basis, as part of the "Russian and Jewish nature", rather than as a result of the communist rule. After a trip to Russia, he wrote in his ''Short View of Russia'' that there is "beastliness on the Russian and Jewish natures when, as now, they are allied together". He also wrote that "out of the cruelty and stupidity of the Old Russia nothing could ever emerge, but (...) beneath the cruelty and stupidity of the New Russia a speck of the ideal may lie hid", which together with other comments may be construed as [[Anti-Russian sentiment|anti-Russian]] and [[antisemitism|antisemitic]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Short View of Russia'', Essays in Persuasion, (London 1932) John Maynard Keynes, 297–312&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics, including [[Murray Rothbard]], have sought to show that Keynes had sympathy with [[Nazism]], and a number of writers described him as antisemitic. Keynes's private letters contain portraits and descriptions, some of which can be characterized as antisemitic, others as [[Philo-Semitism|philosemitic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reder |first=Melvin W. |title=The Anti-Semitism of Some Eminent Economists |journal=History of Political Economy |volume=32 |issue=4 |year=2000 |pages=833–856 |doi=10.1215/00182702-32-4-833 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Was Keynes Anti-Semitic?|journal=[[Economic and Political Weekly]]|volume=35|issue=6 May 2000|jstor=4409262|pages=1619–1624|last1=Chandavarkar|first1=A.|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have suggested that these reflect clichés current at the time that he accepted uncritically, rather than any racism.&lt;ref name="Nina Paulovicova"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://ejournals.library.ualberta.ca/index.php/pi/article/viewFile/1591/1117 | title = The Immoral Moral Scientist. John Maynard Keynes | publisher = University of Alberta | author = Nina Paulovicova | accessdate = 14 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On several occasions Keynes used his influence to help his Jewish friends, most notably when he successfully lobbied for [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] to be allowed residency in the United Kingdom, explicitly in order to rescue him from being deported to [[Anschluss|Nazi-occupied Austria]]. Keynes was a supporter of [[Zionism]], serving on committees supporting the cause.&lt;ref name="Nina Paulovicova"/&gt;

Allegations that he was racist or had totalitarian beliefs have been rejected by [[Robert Skidelsky]] and other biographers.&lt;ref name = "Cunningham" /&gt; Professor Gordon Fletcher wrote that "the suggestion of a link between Keynes and any support of totalitarianism cannot be sustained".&lt;ref name="K rev. and critics"/&gt; Once the aggressive tendencies of the Nazis towards Jews and other minorities had become apparent, Keynes made clear his loathing of Nazism. As a lifelong pacifist he had initially favoured peaceful containment of [[Nazi Germany]], yet he began to advocate a forceful resolution while many conservatives were still arguing for appeasement. After the war started he roundly criticised the Left for losing their nerve to confront [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]:

{{quote|The intelligentsia of the Left were the loudest in demanding that the Nazi aggression should be resisted at all costs. When it comes to a showdown, scarce four weeks have passed before they remember that they are pacifists and write defeatist letters to your columns, leaving the defence of freedom and civilisation to Colonel Blimp and the Old School Tie, for whom Three Cheers.&lt;ref name = "SkidelP2" /&gt;}}

===Views on inflation===

Keynes has been characterised as being indifferent or even positive about mild [[inflation]].&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitext/ess_inflation.html|title= Keynes on Inflation|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|author=Daniel Yergin | author2 = Joseph Stanislaw|accessdate=30 June 2009|authorlink= Daniel Yergin|authorlink2= Joseph Stanislaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had indeed expressed a preference for inflation over [[deflation]], saying that if one has to choose between the two evils, it is "better to disappoint the rentier" than to inflict pain on [[working class]] families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tabb|first=William K.|title=Reconstructing Political Economy: The Great Divide in Economic Thought|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|page=151|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vj3ovRJfufQC&amp;pg=PA151#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9780203049310}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also supported the German hyperinflation as a way to get free from reparations obligations.  However, Keynes was also aware of the dangers of inflation.&lt;ref name="K rev. and critics"/&gt; In ''[[The Economic Consequences of the Peace]]'', he wrote: {{quote|[[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the Capitalist System was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt;}}One of Keynes most oft quoted phrases "''In the long term we are all dead''" came from his 1923 response critiquing the long term positive benefits to workers, propounded by some economists, with respect to people who had lost their jobs due to factories that had been closed down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Maynard keynes : Te the long run |url=http://www.thecommentator.com/article/3689/john_maynard_keynes_in_the_long_run |website=www.thecommentator.com |publisher=The Commentator |accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keynes |first1=John Maynard |title=A tract on monetary reforms |date=1 November 2014 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=9781607960812 |edition=2 |accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on trade imbalances===

He was the principal author of a proposal – the so-called Keynes Plan – for an [[International Clearing Union]]. The two governing principles of the plan were that the problem of settling outstanding balances should be solved by 'creating' additional 'international money', and that debtor and creditor should be treated almost alike as disturbers of equilibrium. In the event, though, the plans were rejected, in part because "American opinion was naturally reluctant to accept the principle of equality of treatment so novel in debtor-creditor relationships".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Crowther, Geoffrey|title=An Outline of Money|version=Second Edition|publisher= Thomas Nelson and Sons|year=1948|pages=326–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The new system is not founded on free-trade (liberalisation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deregulate.asp&lt;/ref&gt; of foreign trade&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade-liberalization.asp&lt;/ref&gt;) but rather on the regulation of international trade, in order to eliminate trade imbalances: the nations with a surplus would have an incentive to reduce it, and in doing so they would automatically clear other nations deficits.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1127&amp;context=peri_workingpapers&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed a global bank that would issue its own currency - the bancor - which was exchangeable with national currencies at fixed rates of exchange and would become the unit of account between nations, which means it would be used to measure a country's trade deficit or trade surplus. Every country would have an overdraft facility in its bancor account at the International Clearing Union. He pointed out that surpluses lead to weak global aggregate demand – countries running surpluses exert a "negative externality" on trading partners, and posed far more than those in deficit, a threat to global prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/05/reform-euro-or-bin-it-greece-germany&lt;/ref&gt;
	
In ''"National Self-Sufficiency" The Yale Review, Vol. 22, no. 4 (June 1933)'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uam.es/personal_pdi/economicas/jsanchez/documentos/1601%20KEYNES%20National%20Self-sufficiency%201933.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.india-seminar.com/2009/601/601_david_singh_grewali.htm&lt;/ref&gt; he already highlighted the problems created by free trade .
 	
His view, supported by many economists and commentators at the time, was that creditor nations may be just as responsible as debtor nations for disequilibrium in exchanges and that both should be under an obligation to bring trade back into a state of balance. Failure for them to do so could have serious consequences. In the words of [[Geoffrey Crowther, Baron Crowther|Geoffrey Crowther]], then editor of [[The Economist]], "If the economic relationships between nations are not, by one means or another, brought fairly close to balance, then there is no set of financial arrangements that can rescue the world from the impoverishing results of chaos."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Crowther, Geoffrey|title=An Outline of Money|version=Second Edition|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons
 	
|year=1948|page=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
These ideas were informed by events prior to the [[Great Depression]] when – in the opinion of Keynes and others – international lending, primarily by the U.S., exceeded the capacity of sound investment and so got diverted into non-productive and speculative uses, which in turn invited default and a sudden stop to the process of lending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Crowther, Geoffrey| title=An Outline of Money|version=Second Edition|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons|year=1948|pages= 368–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Influenced by Keynes, economics texts in the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade. For example, the second edition of the popular introductory textbook, ''An Outline of Money'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Crowther, Geoffrey|title=An Outline of Money|version= Second Edition|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons|year=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; devoted the last three of its ten chapters to questions of foreign exchange management and in particular the 'problem of balance'. However, in more recent years, since the end of the [[Bretton Woods system]] in 1971, with the increasing influence of [[Monetarist]] schools of thought in the 1980s, and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances, these concerns – and particularly concerns about the destabilising effects of large trade surpluses – have largely disappeared from [[mainstream economics]] discourse&lt;ref&gt;See for example, Krugman, P and Wells, R (2006). "Economics", Worth Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; and Keynes' insights have slipped from view.&lt;ref&gt;although see Duncan, R (2005). "The Dollar Crisis: Causes, Consequences, Cures", Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; They are receiving some attention again in the wake of the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example,{{cite web|url= http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2008/11/18/clearing-up-this-mess/|title=Clearing Up This Mess| date=18 November 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090123161345/http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2008/11/18/clearing-up-this-mess/| archivedate= 23 January 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Keynes had been in relationships while at Eton and Cambridge; significant among these early partners were [[Dilly Knox]] and Daniel Macmillan.&lt;ref name=Supermac/&gt;{{sfn|Strachey|1994|pp=123, 127, 715}} Keynes was open about his affairs, and from 1901 to 1915 kept separate diaries in which he tabulated his many sexual encounters.&lt;ref name="moreintelligentlife.com"&gt;[http://www.moreintelligentlife.com/node/824 The Sex Diaries of John Maynard Keynes] The Economist, 28 January 2008, Evan Zimroth (Clare Hall, Cambridge)  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124021328/http://www.moreintelligentlife.com/node/824 |date=24 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Grady, Sean.

Attitudes in the [[Bloomsbury Group]], in which Keynes was avidly involved, were relaxed about homosexuality. Keynes, together with writer [[Lytton Strachey]], had reshaped the [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] attitudes of the [[Cambridge Apostles]]: "since [their] time, homosexual relations among the members were for a time common", wrote [[Bertrand Russell]].{{sfn|Strachey|1994|p=103}}  The artist [[Duncan Grant]], whom he met in 1908, was one of Keynes's great loves. Keynes was also involved with Lytton Strachey,&lt;ref name="New York Times" /&gt; though they were for the most part love rivals, not lovers. Keynes had won the affections of [[Arthur Hobhouse]],{{sfn|Strachey|1994|pp=108-110}} and as with Grant, fell out with a jealous Strachey for it.{{sfn|Strachey|1994|pp=181–183}} Strachey had previously found himself put off by Keynes, not least because of his manner of "treat[ing] his love affairs statistically".{{sfn|Strachey|1994|p=128}}

Political opponents have used Keynes's sexuality to attack his academic work.&lt;ref name=Bartlett&gt;{{cite news|last=Bartlett|first=Bruce|title=Keynes's Biggest Mistake|url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/keyness-biggest-mistake/|newspaper=The New York Times|date=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One line of attack held that he was uninterested in the long term ramifications of his theories because he had no children.&lt;ref name=Bartlett/&gt;

Keynes's friends in the Bloomsbury Group were initially surprised when, in his later years, he began dating and pursuing affairs with women,&lt;ref&gt;Adam Trimingham, [http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/nostalgia/past_present/10030998.print/ "A man of numbers"], ''[[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]]'', 12 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating himself to be [[bisexuality|bisexual]].&lt;ref&gt;Sources describing Keynes as bisexual include:

===Marriage===
[[File:Lopokova and Keynes 1920s.jpg|thumb|[[Lydia Lopokova]] and Keynes in the 1920s]]
In 1921, Keynes wrote that he had fallen "very much in love" with [[Lydia Lopokova]], a well-known Russian [[Ballet dancer|ballerina]] and one of the stars of [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s ''[[Ballets Russes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Maynard Keynes: an economist's biography|year=1992|publisher=Routledge|page=395|author=D. E. Moggridge|quote=I again fell very much in love with her. She seemed to me perfect in every way.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years of his courtship, he maintained an affair with a younger man, [[W. J. H.

Lydia became pregnant in 1927 but miscarried.&lt;ref name = "clarke"/&gt;
Among Keynes's Bloomsbury friends, Lopokova was, at least initially, subjected to criticism for her manners, mode of conversation, and supposedly humble social origins – the last of the ostensible causes being particularly noted in the letters of [[Vanessa Bell|Vanessa]] and [[Clive Bell]], and [[Virginia Woolf]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Lady Talky'', Alison Light, London Review of Books, Vol. 30 No. 24, 18 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Review: Keynes and the Celestial Dancer", by Anand Chandavarkar, Reviewed work(s): Lydia and Maynard: Letters between Lydia Lopokova and Maynard Keynes by Polly Hill; Richard Keynes, Economic and Political Weekly, Vol. 25, No. 34 (25 August 1990), p. 1896&lt;/ref&gt; In her novel ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' (1925), Woolf bases the character of Rezia Warren Smith on Lopokova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lydia and Maynard: letters between Lydia Lopokova and John Maynard Keynes|page=97|publisher=André Deutsch|editor1=Polly Hill |editor2=Richard Keynes |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. M. Forster]] would later write in contrition about "Lydia Keynes, every whose word should be recorded":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Commonplace Book|quote=Lydia Keynes, every whose word should be recorded, said to me as I was leaving her flat the other night: "You know I once tumbled from the stairs and believe me I paid the price."

[[File:46 Gordon Square London.jpg|thumb|46 [[Gordon Square]], where Keynes would often stay while in London. Following his marriage, Keynes took out an extended lease on ''Tilton House'', a farm in the countryside near [[Brighton]], which became the couple's main home when not in the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tiltonhouse.co.uk/ |title=Tilton House homepage |publisher=Tiltonhouse.co.uk |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[File:John Maynard Keynes 46 Gordon Square blue plaque.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque, 46 Gordon Square]]

===Support for the arts===
Keynes thought that the pursuit of money for its own sake was a pathological condition, and that the proper aim of work is to provide leisure. He wanted shorter working hours and longer holidays for all.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Keynes was interested in literature in general and drama in particular and supported the [[Cambridge Arts Theatre]] financially, which allowed the institution to become one of the major British stages outside London.&lt;ref name="ES" /&gt;

Keynes's personal interest in classical opera and dance led him to support the [[Royal Opera House]] at [[Covent Garden]] and the Ballet Company at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre|Sadler's Wells]]. During [[World War II|the war]], as a member of CEMA (Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts), Keynes helped secure government funds to maintain both companies while their venues were shut. Following the war, Keynes was instrumental in establishing the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] and was its founding chairman in 1946. From the start, the two organisations that received the largest grants from the new body were the Royal Opera House and Sadler's Wells.

Like several other notable British authors of his time, Keynes was a member of the [[Bloomsbury Group]]. [[Virginia Woolf]]'s biographer tells an anecdote of how Virginia Woolf, Keynes, and [[T. S. Eliot]] discussed religion at a dinner party, in the context of their struggle against [[Victorian era]] morality.&lt;ref name="bell177"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to one biographer, "he was never able to take religion seriously, regarding it as a strange aberration of the human mind."&lt;ref name="skidv1" /&gt;

===Investments===
Keynes was ultimately a successful investor, building up a private fortune. His assets were nearly wiped out following the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], which he did not foresee, but he soon recouped. At Keynes's death, in 1946, his net worth stood just short of £500,000 – equivalent to about £11 million ($16.5 million) in 2009. The sum had been amassed despite lavish support for various good causes and his personal ethic which made him reluctant to sell on a falling market, in cases where he saw such behaviour as likely to deepen a slump.&lt;ref&gt;See ''John Maynard Keynes'' by Skidelsky (2003), pp. 520–21, p. 563 and especially p. 565 where Keynes is quoted as "It is the duty of a serious investor to accept the depreciation of his holding with equanimity ... any other policy is anti-social, destructive of confidence and incompatible with the working of the economic system."&lt;/ref&gt;

Keynes built up a substantial collection of fine art, including works  by [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and [[Georges Seurat]] (some of which can now be seen at the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]]).&lt;ref name="ES" /&gt; He enjoyed collecting books; he collected and protected many of [[Isaac Newton]]'s papers. In part on the basis of these papers, Keynes wrote of Newton as "the last of the magicians."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Keynes successfully managed the endowment of [[King's College, Cambridge]], with the active component of his portfolio outperforming a British equity index by an average of 8% a year over a quarter century, earning him favourable mention by later investors such as [[Warren Buffett]] and [[George Soros]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Political causes===
Keynes was a lifelong member of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], which until the 1920s had been one of the two main political parties in the United Kingdom, and as late as 1916 had often been the dominant power in government. Keynes had helped campaign for the Liberals at elections from about 1906, yet he always refused to run for office himself, despite being asked to do so on three separate occasions in 1920. From 1926, when Lloyd George became leader of the Liberals, Keynes took a major role in defining the party's economic policy, but by then the Liberals had been displaced into third party status by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].&lt;ref name = "SkidelP1" /&gt;

In 1939 Keynes had the option to enter Parliament as an independent MP with the [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|University of Cambridge seat]]. A by-election for the seat was to be held due to the illness of an elderly [[Conservative Party (UK)|Tory]], and the master of [[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene College]] had obtained agreement that none of the major parties would field a candidate if Keynes chose to stand. Keynes declined the invitation as he felt he would wield greater influence on events if he remained a free agent.&lt;ref name = "clarke"/&gt;

Keynes was a proponent of [[eugenics]]. He served as director of the [[Galton Institute|British Eugenics Society]] from 1937 to 1944. As late as 1946, shortly before his death, Keynes declared eugenics to be "the most important, significant and, I would add, genuine branch of sociology which exists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Opening remarks: The Galton Lecture|journal=Eugenics Review|author=Keynes, John Maynard|volume=38|issue=1|year=1946|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keynes once remarked that "the youth had no religion save [[communism]] and this was worse than nothing."&lt;ref name="bell177"/&gt; [[Marxism]] "was founded upon nothing better than a misunderstanding of [[David Ricardo|Ricardo]]", and, given time, he (Keynes) "would deal thoroughly with the Marxists" and other economists to solve the economic problems their theories "threaten to cause".&lt;ref name="bell177"/&gt;

In 1931 Keynes had the following to say on Marxism:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

|isbn=0-393-00190-3

&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|How can I accept the Communist doctrine, which sets up as its bible, above and beyond criticism, an [[Das Kapital|obsolete textbook]] which I know not only to be scientifically erroneous but without interest or application to the modern world? How can I adopt a creed which, preferring the mud to the fish, exalts the boorish [[proletariat]] above the [[bourgeoisie]] and the [[intelligentsia]], who with all their faults, are the quality of life and surely carry the seeds of all human achievement? Even if we need a religion, how can we find it in the turbid rubbish of the red bookshop? It is hard for an educated, decent, intelligent son of Western Europe to find his ideals here, unless he has first suffered some strange and horrid process of conversion which has changed all his values.}}

Keynes was a firm supporter of [[women's rights]] and in 1932 became vice-chairman of the [[Marie Stopes International|Marie Stopes Society]] which provided [[birth control]] education. He also campaigned against job discrimination against women and unequal pay. He was an outspoken campaigner for reform of the [[LGBT social movements|laws against homosexuality]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Tilton House, 2017.jpg|thumb|Tilton House, 2017]]

Throughout his life, Keynes worked energetically for the benefit both of the public and his friends; even when his health was poor, he laboured to sort out the finances of his old college.&lt;ref name="JMK Ind08Nov08"&gt;
{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/john-maynard-keynes-can-the-great-economist-save-the-world-994416.html |title=John Maynard Keynes: Can the great economist save the world? |accessdate=20 November 2008 |work=The Independent |location=United Kingdom |first=Nick |last=Fraser |date=8 November 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Helping to set up the [[Bretton Woods system]], he worked to institute an [[International monetary systems|international monetary system]] that would be beneficial for the [[world economy]]. Keynes suffered a series of [[heart attack]]s, which ultimately proved fatal. They began during negotiations for the [[Anglo-American loan]] in [[Savannah, Georgia]], where he was trying to secure favourable terms for the United Kingdom from the United States, a process he described as "absolute hell".&lt;ref name="50 greats"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks after returning from the United States, Keynes died of a heart attack at Tilton, his farmhouse home near [[Firle]], [[East Sussex]], England, on 21 April 1946, at the age of 62.&lt;ref name = "SkidelP1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lord Keynes Dies of Heart Attack.

Both of Keynes's parents outlived him: his father [[John Neville Keynes]] (1852–1949) by three years, and his mother [[Florence Ada Keynes]] (1861–1958) by twelve. Keynes's brother Sir [[Geoffrey Keynes]] (1887–1982) was a distinguished surgeon, scholar, and bibliophile. His nephews include [[Richard Keynes]] (1919–2010), a physiologist, and [[Quentin Keynes]] (1921–2003), an adventurer and bibliophile. Keynes had no children; his widow, [[Lydia Lopokova]], died in 1981.

'''Karrar Hussain''' (1911&amp;ndash;1999) was a [[Pakistan]]i educationist, writer and literary critic. In his student days in [[British India]] he was affiliated with the [[Khaksar movement]], with which he later parted ways due to a difference of opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Half Sufi, half communist|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/73592/half-sufi-half-communist/|newspaper=[[The Express Tribune]]|date=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Karrar Hussain was born in Kota, Rajasthan, British India. After passing Intermediate Exams from Meerut, he went to Agra University and got master's degrees in English and Urdu. As a student politician, he was affiliated with the Indian National Congress and Khaksar Tehreek by Allama Mushriqui. He started working at Meerut College in 1933, where [[Jameel Jalibi]], [[Hasan Askari (writer)|Hasan Askari]], [[Intizar Hussain]], and Saleem Ahmed were his students.

In 1948 he migrated to [[Pakistan]], where he continued as a lecturer in English at several colleges and was appointed as the first vice-chancellor of the [[University of Balochistan]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Obituaries|journal=Iqbal Review|date=April 2000|volume=2|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com/publications/journals/review/apr00/20.htm|publisher=[[Iqbal Academy Pakistan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his many writings is a biographical treatise about the [[Urdu]] poet [[Mirza Ghalib]] commissioned by the ''Idara Yadgaar-e-Gahlib'' titled "Ghalib: Sab Achcha Kahein Jissay".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shafique|first=[[Khurram Ali]]|title=Forgotten Accounts|url=http://www.therepublicofrumi.com/khurram/ghalib02.htm|newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] The Review|date=25–31 December 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karrar was also a scholar of [[Islam]], though he advocated that secularism provided the best environment for an Islamic society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ahmed|first=Khaled|title=Why do we hate secularism?|url=http://www.jang.com.pk/thenews/nov2010-weekly/nos-21-11-2010/dia.htm#1|newspaper=[[The News International]] Dialogue|date=21 November 2010|authorlink=Khaled Ahmed (writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His written work includes several books and published collections of his speeches. He also wrote Urdu poetry, including [[Naat]], [[Salaam (poetry)|Salam]], [[Munqibat]], [[Marsiya]]s, [[Nazm]] and [[Ghazal]]s. His poems have been published in various literary magazines.

'''Korean Confucian art''' took strong hold with the Yi generals who set in place the [[Joseon dynasty]] which distinguished itself in many ways by promoting [[Korean Confucianism|Confucian thought]] as the basis for a new national vision. Differentiating itself by restraint, spartan choices of color, and design, understatement, and great care and precision, the legacy of this art since the 13th century has been extensive throughout Asia. Confucian art was inspired of course by Confucius. Confucian art originated in China, then spread westwards on the Silk road, southward down to southern China and then onto Southeast Asia, and eastwards through northern China on to Japan and Korea. 

[[Korean flower arrangement]] is part of the Confucian tradition.

'''Kurt Aland''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=on|FBA|size=100%}} (28 March 1915 – 13 April 1994) was a [[Germany|German]] theologian and [[Biblical studies|biblical scholar]] who specialized in [[New Testament]] [[textual criticism]]. He founded the ''[[Institute for New Testament Textual Research|Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung]]'' (Institute for New Testament Textual Research) in [[Münster]] and served as its first director from 1959–83. He was one of the principal editors of ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece#Editions|Nestle-Aland – Novum Testamentum Graece]]'' for the [[Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft]] and ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece#Editions|The Greek New Testament]]'' for the [[United Bible Societies]].

== Life ==

Aland was born in [[Berlin]]-[[Steglitz]]. He started studying theology in 1933 at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität]] in Berlin (he also studied philology, archaeology, and history). On 23 March that year he was examined before the ''Bruderrat'' (council of brothers) in the ''[[Bekennende Kirche]]'' (Confessing Church). During his studies, he worked for the journal of the Confessing Church, ''Junge Kirche'' (Young Church). In an ideological brochure, ''Wer fälscht?'' (Who is lying?), written against [[Mathilde Ludendorff]], he confirmed the position of the Confessing Church and identified with them. In 1939 he studied for his bachelor's degree under the guidance of [[Hans Lietzmann]]. In 1940 he was released from military service; and in 1941, after Lietzmann's death, he took over the responsibilities of editing the ''Theologische Literaturzeitung'' (the only German theological magazine at that time). He graduated that same year, and in 1944 was ordained as minister of the parish of [[Berlin-Steglitz]].

After [[World War II]], Aland became a lecturer on the theological faculty of the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. In 1947 he was appointed professor ordinarius in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle (Saale)]].

Aland disapproved of the Marxist government of [[East Germany]], and was persecuted as a result. In 1953 he was accused of smuggling watches to [[West Berlin]] and was kept under arrest for three months. Aland frequently spoke out against various forms of state oppression directed at churches and also demanded freedom of speech in East Germany. In July 1958, he lost his job at the university. However, in September of that year, he successfully escaped to West Berlin. His 8000-volume library was incorporated into the University Library.

In 1958 he became a professor at the [[University of Münster]], Germany. Aland rejected a professorship of the [[University of Chicago]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;''Kurt Aland - In Memoriam'', 1995, p. 15'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Archive of the University of Münster/Germany''&lt;/ref&gt; In Münster he founded the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research]] ("Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung") in 1959, which he directed until 1983. Furthermore, he founded the world's first "[[Bible Museum Münster|Bible Museum]]" in 1979, which was unique in the world for many years. His institute achieved worldwide recognition by publishing the ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece#Editions|Nestle-Aland - Novum Testamentum Graece]]'' and ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece#Editions|The Greek New Testament]]'' for the [[United Bible Societies]].

Aland was married twice. His first marriage was to Ingeborg Aland (they had three children together). In 1972 he married [[Barbara Aland]]. He died in [[Münster (Westfalen)|Münster]], [[Germany]] in 1994.

Kurt Aland was representative of increasing specialism within theological-historical studies.&lt;ref name= "odin"&gt;{{Citation | first = Karl-Alfred | last = Odin | contribution = Entdecker und Wissenschaftorganisator von hohen Gnaden | title = Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung | date = 28 March 1985 | language = de}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of New Testament research, his work (and also the work that he did together with his wife [[Barbara Aland]] in the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research]] in Münster) is internationally acclaimed.

The focus of his work began as an intense and adventurous search for old manuscripts on several expeditions to abbeys in Russia and Greece (amongst others). He discovered numerous manuscripts of the New Testament, whose evaluation is still in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | language = de | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | URL = http://www.bundespraesident.de/SharedDocs/Reden/DE/Horst-Koehler/Reden/2009/12/20091209_Rede2_Anlage.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=2 | title = Speech of the President of Germany | first = Horst | last = Köhler | date = 2009-12-09}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most notable among his work was the newly arranged edition of ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece]]'' (Greek New Testament) in 1979 (also called Nestle-Aland).&lt;ref name= "odin" /&gt; This textual foundation for the New Testament exemplifies a scholarly mentality aimed at achieving the highest possible convergence with the "original text."

Furthermore, he acted in the Hermann-Kunst-Stiftung, which was founded in 1964 by Hermann Kunst, a good friend of Aland. Many important figures within politics and economics participated in the sponsorship of the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research]].

Another priority in his life was church history, being concerned with the early church, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], and movements such as [[pietism]] and revivalism.

Aland received critical acclaim for his profundity and comprehensive knowledge of the textual sources for the New Testament. His contemporary presence is relevant, having contributed to modern scientific methodology.&lt;ref name= "odin"/&gt; Aland was of the opinion that every work within historical research stands on its adherence to reliability and accessibility.

The archives (''[[Nachlass]]'') of Kurt Aland are provided in the University Archives of the [[University of Münster]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Uni Münster | language = de | URL = http://www.uni-muenster.de/Archiv/jahresbericht2014.html | title = Jahresbericht | year = 2014}}.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8970">[[File:1910 photo of German physicist Max Bernhard Weinstein.jpg|thumb|right]]
'''Max Bernhard Weinstein''' (1 September 1852 in [[Kaunas]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luise-berlin.de/kalender/jahr/1852.htm Berlin im Jahr 1852 (Berlin in 1852)]: "Max Bernhard Weinstein wird in Kowno (Kaunas/Litauen) geboren. Weinstein war seit 1886 Privatdozent für Physik und Geographie an der Berliner Universität." ''Translation'': "Max Bernard Weinstein was born in Kovno (Kaunas / Lithuania). Weinstein was since 1886 a lecturer in physics and geography at the University of Berlin."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vilna Governorate]] – 25 March 1918) was a [[Germany|German]] [[physicist]] and [[philosopher]]. He is best known as an opponent of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[Theory of Relativity]], and for having written a broad examination of the theological theory of [[Pandeism]].

The [[Imperial Russia|Russian]]-born&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;''The Symbolic Universe: Geometry and Physics 1890-1930'', page 104, by Jeremy Gray. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Weinstein translated [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s ''Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism'' into [[German language|German]] in 1883,&lt;ref name="Mehra"&gt;''The Historical Development of Quantum Theory'', page 33, by [[Jagdish Mehra]] and Helmut Rechenberg, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and taught courses on [[electrodynamics]] at the University of Berlin.&lt;ref name="Mehra"/&gt;

While teaching at the Institute of Physics in the University of Berlin, Weinstein associated with [[Max Planck]], [[Emil du Bois-Reymond]], [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], [[Ernst Pringsheim, Sr.]], [[Wilhelm Wien]], [[Carl A. Paalzow]] of the Technische Hochschule in Berlin Charlottenburg, [[August Kundt]], [[Werner von Siemens]], theologian [[Adolph von Siemens]], historian [[Theodor Mommsen]], and Germanic philologist [[Wilhelm Scherer]].&lt;ref&gt;''Review of theology &amp; philosophy - Volume 7'', page 576, by Allan Menzies. 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of Einstein's theory of relativity ==

Weinstein was among the first physicists to reject and criticize [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]], contending that "general relativity had removed gravity from its earlier isolated position and made it into a "world power" controlling all laws of nature," and warning that "physics and mathematics would have to be revised."&lt;ref name="Crelinsten"&gt;''Einstein's Jury: The Race to Test Relativity'', page 102, by Jeffrey Crelinsten. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Weinstein's writings, and their impact driving public sentiment against Einstein's theories, which led astronomer [[Wilhelm Foerster]] to convince Einstein to write a more accessible explanation of those ideas.&lt;ref name="Crelinsten"/&gt; But, one commentator contends that Weinstein's summaries of relativistic physics were "tedious exercises in algebra."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Galison, ''Science and Society: The History of Modern Physical Science in the Twentieth Century'', p. 288, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical writings ==

In addition to his work in physics, Weinstein wrote several philosophical works. ''[https://archive.org/details/WeinsteinWeltUndL Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis]'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910) examined the origins and development of a great many philosophical areas, including the broadest and most far-reaching examination of the theological theory of [[Pandeism]] written up to that point. A critique reviewing Weinstein's work in this field deemed Pandeism to be an 'unsightly' combination of Greek and Latin.&lt;ref name="Kirn"&gt;Otto Kirn, reviewer, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") in [[Emil Schürer]], [[Adolf von Harnack]], editors, ''Theologische Literaturzeitung'' ("Theological Literature Journal"), Volume 35, column 827 (1910): "Dem Verfasser hat anscheinend die Einteilung: religiöse, rationale und naturwissenschaftlich fundierte Weltanschauungen vorgeschwebt; er hat sie dann aber seinem Material gegenüber schwer durchführbar gefunden und durch die mitgeteilte ersetzt, die das Prinzip der Einteilung nur noch dunkel durchschimmern läßt. Damit hängt wohl auch das vom Verfasser gebildete unschöne griechisch-lateinische Mischwort des ,Pandeismus' zusammen. Nach S. 228 versteht er darunter im Unterschied von dem mehr metaphysisch gearteten Pantheismus einen ,gesteigerten und vereinheitlichten Animismus', also eine populäre Art religiöser Weltdeutung. Prhagt man lieh dies ein, so erstaunt man über die weite Ausdehnung, die dem Begriff in der Folge gegeben wird. Nach S. 284 ist Scotus Erigena ein ganzer, nach S. 300 Anselm von Canterbury ein ,halber Pandeist'; aber auch bei Nikolaus Cusanus und Giordano Bruno, ja selbst bei Mendelssohn und Lessing wird eine Art von Pandeismus gefunden (S. 306. 321. 346.)." ''Translation'': "The author apparently intended to divide up religious, rational and scientifically based philosophies, but found his material overwhelming, resulting in an effort that can shine through the principle of classification only darkly. This probably is also the source of the unsightly Greek-Latin compound word, 'Pandeism.' At page 228, he understands the difference from the more metaphysical kind of pantheism, an enhanced unified animism that is a popular religious worldview. In remembering this borrowing, we were struck by the vast expanse given the term. According to page 284, Scotus Erigena is one entirely, at p. 300 Anselm of Canterbury is 'half Pandeist'; but also Nicholas of Cusa and Giordano Bruno, and even in Mendelssohn and Lessing a kind of Pandeism is found (p. 306 321 346.)".&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer further criticises Weinstein's broad assertions that such historical philosophers as [[Scotus Erigena]], [[Anselm of Canterbury]], [[Nicholas of Cusa]], [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] all were Pandeists or leaned towards Pandeism.&lt;ref name="Kirn"/&gt;

Philosophically, Weinstein was attracted to what he called a psychical or spiritual monism, which he believed to be comparable to the [[Pantheism]] of [[Spinoza]], and wherein the essence of all phenomena could be found entirely in the mind.&lt;ref name="Kragh"&gt;''Entropic Creation: Religious Contexts of Thermodynamics and Cosmology'', page 131-132, by Helge Kragh. 2008. {{ISBN|0754664147}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Though he could see no way around the eventual [[heat death of the Universe]], Weinstein suggested that there existed a fundamental 'psychical energy,' of which a maximum-entropy world would ultimately consist.&lt;ref name="Kragh"/&gt; Weinstein wrote:

{{cquote|That would correspond to the Indians' thoughts of Brahma and Buddha's nirvana. Would we call such an end in an absolutely spiritual being death? Certainly not death, but probably a dreamless sleep from which there is no awakening.&lt;ref name="Kragh"/&gt;}}

From this premise Weinstein reasoned that the world must have both a beginning and an end, and that a supernatural force must have initiated it, and so could bring about its end as well:

{{cquote|The world cannot emerge by itself from the entropic death. If the world, understood as matter, substance or energy, is finite, the entropic death must occur within a finite time. But then the world, and its processes in particular, must also have begun a finite time ago. This cannot have happened by itself, ... [and] a supernatural cause must consequently have been active. If one is forced to admit such a cause in the beginning, one can also let it govern the end, so that a beginning follows the end, and so on in all eternity.&lt;ref name="Kragh"/&gt;}}

Though he rejected theistic formulations regarding such things, Weinstein found the origin of the Universe to be so problematic that he wrote: "As far as I can see, only Spinozist pantheism, among all philosophies, can lead to a satisfactory solution."&lt;ref name="Kragh"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1942">'''Menhuan''' ({{zh|s=门宦|t=門宦|p=Ménhuàn}}) is a term used by [[Hui people|Chinese-speaking Muslims]] for a Chinese-style [[Sufi order]]. The leaders of a menhuan over the ages form a chain of spiritual succession, known in Arabic as ''[[silsilah]]'', which goes back to  the order's founder in China (e.g., [[Ma Laichi]] or [[Ma Mingxin]]), and beyond, toward his teachers in Arabia.&lt;ref name=dillon113&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
The term ''menhuan'' itself is of comparatively recent origin: according to [[Ma Tong]] (1983), it was first attested in an essay by the [[Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture|Hezhou Prefecture]] Magistrate [[Yang Zengxin]] dated 1897.&lt;ref name=dillon113/&gt; It has been suggested by Chinese researchers that it has developed from ''menfa'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|门阀}}), meaning "powerful and influential family", or ''menhu'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|门户}}), which has been used in the [[Northwestern China]] to mean "gateway" or "faction".&lt;ref name=dillon113/&gt;
&lt;!--
==History==
Chinese authors often talk about the "Four Great ''menhuan''s", the list usually including [[Jahriyya]] (哲合忍耶), [[Khufiyya]] (虎夫耶)), [[Qadiryya]] (尕德忍耶 or 戛迪林耶 or 嘎吉忍耶), and (库布忍耶).

== Early life ==
Hazarvi was born in Chamba Village, [[Kot Najeebullah]], [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–55)|North-West Frontier Province]], [[British Raj|British India]]. His father Abdul Hameed Hazarvi, an Islamic scholar, belonged to the [[Karlal]] [[Hindko]] tribe. He was a follower of the [[Chishti]] Order.&lt;ref name="Adams, p.100-101"&gt;Adams, p.100-101&lt;/ref&gt; He was the elder of his four brothers and sisters.&lt;ref name="JI"&gt;[http://jamaat.org/beta/site/page/3 Sayyid Abul A'la Maududi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418092730/http://jamaat.org/beta/site/page/3 |date=18 April 2014 }}. Official website of the [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]].&lt;/ref&gt; He started studies of [[Islamic law]], [[Urdu]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]] languages at the local [[maktab]] in Chamba Village,Hazarvi studied from scholars including Muhib-un-Nabi. He was the student of Mushtaq Ahmad Kanpuri, where he learned [[Islamic Jurisprudence]] and traditional [[Dars-i-Nizami]]. He completed the Dawra [[Hadith]] and [[Qur'anic exegesis]] with [[Hamid Raza Khan]] the elder son of [[Ahmad Raza Khan]] in Madrasa [[Manzar-e-Islam]], [[Bareily]]. [[Hamid Raza Khan]] gave this student of his [[khilafat]], which is why [[Qadri]] is written on his gravestone. Hazarvi was attracted to mathematics, and studied the fundamental concepts in mathematics in depth.&lt;ref&gt;Tazkira-e-Qari Muslehuddin – Page 4 – Professor Jalaluddin Ahmad Noori (Karachi University)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pledge of allegiance and services==
Hazarvi offered [[Bay'ah]] (allegiance) to [[Meher Ali Shah]] at the age of 11 and asked him to pray that he could become a scholar. [[Pir Meher Ali Shah]] said to him that "jaao! eik din tum bohot barei moulvi bano gei" (Mawlawi was the title used for [[Ulama|Alim]] in those days).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahmood|first=Sohail|title=Islamic Fundamentalism in Pakistan, Egypt and Iran|year=1995|publisher=Vanguard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 28, in 1937 Abdul Ghafoor Hazarvi went to Jeendhar Sharif, [[Gujrat District|Gujrat]], at the service of Uwais-e-Waqat Khawaja Gohar Munir Jeendharvi which was a great [[Sufi]] of the [[Uwaisi|Uwaisi order]], who devoted everything to his followers, due to this immense [[Faiz|fayz]] (blessing), Hazarvi progressed rapidly through the stages of spiritual training and [[Tasawwuf]]. He conferred ''[[khilafah]]'' upon Hazarvi thus giving him permission to speak on behalf of the [[Uwaisi]] Order.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Irfan-e-Manzil – Darul Kutub Hanfia Kharadar Karachi – 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

After taking the education he started the teaching [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] in [[Madrasa]] [[Manzar-e-Islam]] in [[Bareilly]], India. After then he taught [[Dars-i-Nizami]] in Jamia Khudam-ul-Sufiya in [[Gujrat city|Gujrat]], where he performed his duties as [[Mawlānā|Mudarris]]. On (1935), Hazarvi established [[Jamia Nizamia Ghousia]] in [[Wazirabad]], where he served as the [[Principal (academia)|Mohatmim]] and [[Khatib]]. Hazarvi was a great [[Mawlānā|Mudarris]] and in the month of [[Ramadan]] especially he would teach Dowra [[Qur'an]] to advanced students over the 30 days.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Abdul Ghafoor Hazarvi being one of the best speakers in [[South Asia]], he was a brilliant orator, and he had his gifted ability to answer and reply spontaneously. Many people would go "[[Mast (Sufism)|Mast]]" when he delivered his speeches. Ghazali-e-Zaman Syed [[Ahmad Saeed Kazmi]] Shah would consider himself uneducated in front of him. Hazarvi shared a close relationship with [[Muhaddith]]-e-Azam Pakistan Moulana Sardar Ahmad Qadri; both had studied under Hamid Raza Khan.&lt;ref name="The Daily Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|title=Preachers of hate on British TV: what they said that broke the broadcasting rules|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/9859822/Preachers-of-hate-on-British-TV-what-they-said-that-broke-the-broadcasting-rules.html|work=The Daily Telegraph (newspaper)|accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agitation for democracy==
During the [[Ayub]] era, nine prominent leaders belonging to different political parties were tried for mutiny under the Official Secret Act. The nine of them had decided to initiate a democratic movement; As a president of [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan]] Abdul Ghafoor Hazarvi was one of the nine. The trial lingered on for two years. Ultimately, the case was taken back by the government, for lack of evidence. In 1965, the joint opposition was organised, he was one of its central leaders. Along with other leaders of the [[Combined Opposition Party|COP]], Hazarvi toured the two wings of the country (East and West Pakistan) to create mass awareness and organise a strong national democratic movement. The military ruler, president [[Muhammad Ayub Khan]] (1958–1969), banned political parties and warned Hazarvi against continued political activism. [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan]] supported the opposition party, the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM). In the 1964–1965 presidential elections, Hazarvi supported the opposition leader, [[Fatima Jinnah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al Mujahid|first=Sharif|title=Far East and Australasia 2003|editor=Eur|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1986|edition=34th|pages=1163|isbn=1-85743-133-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LclscNCTz9oC&amp;pg=PA1163&amp;lpg=PA1163&amp;dq=Mian+Tufail+Mohammad+C.O.P.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yk3qY41f_6&amp;sig=lecn-DCXde5LrCiYhr5Jks0mEMI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KGe1SpWFHo-F8QbrrciFDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8#v=onepage&amp;q=Mian%20Tufail%20Muhammad%20C.O.P.&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opposition to other sects ==
[[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] of [[Qadian]] claimed to be the [[Mahdi]] (messiah) awaited by Muslims, as well as a [[Prophethood (Ahmadiyya)|''Ummati Nabi'']], a subordinate prophet to Muhammed who brings no new [[Sharia]] but instead restores Islam to its pure form.&lt;ref name="reviewofreligions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewofreligions.org/1599/my%E2%80%88claim-to-promised-messiahship/|title=My Claim to Promised Messiahship – The Review of Religions|publisher=reviewofreligions.org|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims proved controversial among many Muslims, and Hazarvi branded Mirza Ghulam Ahmad as a [[Heresy|heretic]] and [[apostate]] and called him and his followers ([[Ahmadis]]) [[Kuffar]].&lt;ref&gt;Zahid Aziz, Ahmadiyya Anjuman Ishaat Islam (2008) ''A survey of the Lahore Ahmadiyya movement: history, beliefs, aims and work''.

==Beliefs and Practices==

===Beliefs regarding Muhammad===
Hazarvi believed that:
*Muhammad is a human being but created from light like angels, rather than from clay like other human beings.
*He is present in many places at the same time.&lt;ref name=Asthana&gt;N. C. Asthana &amp; A.Nirmal.

*He has the authority to do whatever he desires as granted to him by God.&lt;ref name="Ludhiyānvī1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Muḥammad Yūsūf Ludhiyānvī|title=Differences in the Ummah and the straight path|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wPLXAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=20 April 2011|year=1999|publisher=Zam Zam Publishers|pages=35–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Although human, he possessed a ''[[Nūr (Islam)|nūr]]'' (light) that predates creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Islamic Beliefs, Practices, and Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H_m14NlQQMYC&amp;pg=PA145|accessdate=4 May 2011|date=1 September 2010|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7926-0|pages=145–}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with the [[Deobandi]] view that Muhammad was ''[[Al-Insān al-Kāmil|insan-e-kamil]]'' ("the complete man"), a respected but physically typical human.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Akbar S.

*He is ''haazir naazir'' (can be present in many places at the same time, as opposed to God, who is everywhere by definition).&lt;ref name=Asthana/&gt;
*God has granted him ''ilm-e-ghaib'' (the knowledge of the unseen).

*Leaving the beard to grow for men; the Hazarvis views a man who trims his beard to less than a fist-length as a sinner, and shaving the beard is considered abominable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arun Shourie]], ''The World of Fatwas or the Sharia in Action'', pg. 135. ASA Publications, 1995. {{ISBN|9788190019958}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- PLEASE ELABORATE ON MAJOR THEOLOGICAL POINTS HERE.  SEE [[Shia Islam]] FOR IDEAS AS TO HOW TO STRUCTURE THE SECTION. --&gt;

== Works==
Hazarvi wrote and translated books on a variety of subjects, including his compilation of [[Manaqib-al-Jaleela]], is a book on [[Islamic Jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wimnet.org/articles/alagenius.htm#&amp;#91;j&amp;#93;%20A%E2%80%98lahazrat%20as%20a%20Translator%20of%20Holy%20Qur%E2%80%98an A‘lahazrat as a Translator of Holy Qur‘an]. wimnet.org {{vs|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works include:

* ''Tahqiq-ul-Haq Fi Kalima-tul-Haq'' (''The Truth about Kalima-tul-Haq'')
* ''Shamsul Hidayah''
* ''I'la Kalimatillah Fi Bayan-e-Wa Ma Uhilla Bihi Legharillah''
* ''AlFatuhat-us-Samadiyyah'' (''Divine Bounties'')
* ''Tasfiah Mabain Sunni Wa Shi'ah''
* ''Majmua Fatawa''

==Ideology==
Hazarvi's understanding of Islamic law has been presented concisely in his book ''[[Manaqib-al-Jaleela]]''. Hazarvi's inspiration from his mentor, [[Ahmed Raza Khan Barelvi]] and non-traditionalist approach to the religion has parted him from traditionalist understanding on a number of issues, but he never goes out of the traditional framework.

===Jihad===
Hazarvi believes that there are certain directives of the [[Qur'an]] pertaining to war which were specific only to [[Muhammad]] and certain specified peoples of his times (particularly the progeny of [[Abraham]]: the [[Ishmaelites]], the [[Israelites]], and the [[Nazarites]]). Thus, Muhammad and his designated followers waged a war against Divinely specified peoples of their time (the [[polytheists]] and the [[Israelites]] and [[Nazarites]] of Arabia and some other Jews, Christians, et al.) as a form of Divine punishment and asked the polytheists of Arabia for submission to Islam as a condition for exoneration and the others for [[jizya]] and submission to the political authority of the Muslims for exemption from death punishment and for military protection as the [[dhimmi]]s of the Muslims. Therefore, after Muhammad and his companions, there is no concept in Islam obliging Muslims to wage war for propagation or implementation of Islam. The only valid basis for [[jihad]] through arms is to end oppression when all other measures have failed.&lt;ref name="jihad"&gt;''Mizan'', [http://www.renaissance.com.pk/junespart2y2.html The Islamic Law of Jihad] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121083252/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/junespart2y2.html |date=21 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him Jihad can only be waged by an organised Islamic state. No person, party or group can take arms into their hands (for the purpose of waging Jihad) under any circumstances. Another corollary, in his opinion, is that death punishment for [[apostasy]] was also specifically for the recipients of the same Divine punishment during Muhammad's times—for they had persistently denied the truth of Muhammad's mission even after it had been made conclusively evident to them by God through Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.renaissance.com.pk/septrefl22y2.html Islamic Punishments: Some Misconceptions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205707/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/septrefl22y2.html |date=27 September 2007 }}'', [[Al-Mawrid|Renaissance – Monthly Islamic Journal]], 12(9), 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of an Islamic state is not a religious obligation ''per se'' upon the Muslims. However, he believes that if and when Muslims form a state of their own, Islam does impose certain religious obligations on its rulers as establishment of the institution of [[salat]] (obligatory prayer), [[zakah]] (mandatory charity), and [[Enjoin what is good and forbid what is wrong|'''amr bi'l-ma'ruf wa nahi 'ani'l-munkar'']] (preservation and promotion of society's good conventions and customs and eradication of social vices; this, in Hazarvi's opinion, should be done in modern times through courts, police, etc. in accordance with the law of the land which, as the government itself, must be based on the opinion of the majority).

The Qur'an states [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] for male-female interaction in [[sura]]h [[An-Nur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|24|27|31|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in [[sura]]h [[Al-Ahzab]], there are special directives for [[Muhammad's marriages|wives of Muhammad]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|33|32|34|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; and directives given to Muslim women to distinguish themselves when they were being [[harass]]ed in [[Medina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|33|58|61|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="norms"&gt;''Mizan'', [http://www.renaissance.com.pk/novislaw2y2.html Norms of Gender Interaction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205906/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/novislaw2y2.html |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an has created a distinction between men and women only to maintain family relations and relationships.&lt;ref name="soc"&gt;''Mizan'', The Social Law of Islam&lt;/ref&gt;

===Penal laws===
* The Islamic punishments of [[hudud]] (lit. "limit" or "boundary") are maximum pronouncements that can be mitigated by a court of law on the basis of extenuating circumstances.&lt;ref name="penal"&gt;''Mizan'', [http://www.renaissance.com.pk/septfeart2y2.html The Penal Law of Islam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127184245/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/septfeart2y2.html |date=27 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[shariah]] (Divine law) does not stipulate any fixed amount for the [[diyya]] (monetary compensation for unintentional murder); the determination of the amount—for the unintentional murder of a man or a woman—has been left to the conventions of society.&lt;ref name="penal"/&gt;
* ''[[Ceteris paribus]]'' (all other things being equal), a woman's testimony is equal to that of a man's.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.renaissance.com.pk/septrefl12y2.html The Law of Evidence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211020525/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/septrefl12y2.html |date=11 February 2007 }}'', [[Al-Mawrid|Renaissance – Monthly Islamic Journal]], 12(9), 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
*  Rape is [[hirabah]] and deserves severe punishments as mentioned in the {{cite quran|5|33|34|style=ref}}. It doesn't require four witnesses to register the case as in the case of [[zina|Zina (Arabic)]] (''consensual sex''). Those who were punished by [[stoning]] (''[[rajm]]'') in Muhammad's time were also punished under [[hirabah]] for raping, sexually assaulting women, and spreading [[vulgarity]] in society through prostitution.&lt;ref name="penal"/&gt;

===Sources of Islam===
* All that is Islam is constituted by the [[Qur'an]] and [[Sunnah]]. Nothing besides these two is Islam or can be regarded as its part.&lt;ref name="src"&gt;''Mizan'', [http://www.renaissance.com.pk/JulRefl2y6.html Sources of Islam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614041859/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/JulRefl2y6.html |date=14 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Just like [[Quran]], [[Sunnah]] (the way of the prophet) is only what [[Ummah|Muslim nation]] received through [[ijma]] (consensus of [[sahaba|companions of the prophet]]) and [[tawatur]] (perpetual adherence of [[Ummah|Muslim nation]]).&lt;ref name="src"/&gt;
* Unlike [[Quran]] and [[Sunnah]], [[ahadith]] only explain and elucidate what is contained in these two sources and also describe the exemplary way in which [[Muhammad]] followed Islam.&lt;ref name="src"/&gt;
* The [[Sharia]] is distinguished from [[fiqh]], the latter being collections of interpretations and applications of the Sharia by Muslim jurists. Fiqh is characterised as a human exercise, and therefore subject to human weakness and differences of opinion. A Muslim is not obliged to adhere to a school of fiqh.{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}}

==Death==
Hazarvi died on 9 October 1970, in a road accident at [[Wazirabad]], [[Punjab, Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Ofcom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ofcom Broadcast Bulletin Issue number 205, 8 May 2012|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/enforcement/broadcast-bulletins/obb205/obb205.pdf|accessdate=10 November 2018|publisher=Ofcom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Muhō Nölke'''|ネルケ無方}} (b. March 1, 1968, as Jens Olaf Christian Nölke) &lt;ref&gt;[http://japan-magazine.jnto.go.jp/en/1308_zen.html "A German Zen Master"], ''Japan Monthly Web Magazine'' (July 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; is a German-born [[Zen monk]] who is presently the abbot of [[Antai-ji]], a [[Japan]]ese [[Sōtō Zen]] [[Buddhist temples in Japan|temple]] in [[Shin'onsen, Hyōgo|Shin'onsen]] in the [[Mikata District, Hyōgo|Mikata District]] of [[Japan]]'s [[Hyōgo Prefecture]]. He has translated works of [[Dōgen]] and [[Kodo Sawaki|Kōdō Sawaki]], and has authored two books in German and several books in Japanese.

At age 16, Muhō was introduced to ''[[zazen]]'' by one of his [[high school]] [[teacher]]s and soon had the wish to become a Zen [[monk]]. To prepare for his stay in [[Japan]], he studied [[Japanese language|Japanese]] at the university in Berlin, along with [[philosophy]] and [[physics]]. During his studies, he spent one year at [[Kyoto University]] and learned for the first time about [[Antai-ji]]. At age 22, he spent six months there as a lay practitioner.

Three years later, after graduating from university, Muhō was ordained as a [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] [[monk]] under the [[abbot]] Miyaura Shinyu Rōshi. Apart from [[Antai-ji]], he has trained for one year at the [[Rinzai school|Rinzai]] [[monastery]] [[Tōfuku-ji]] in [[Kyoto]], and one year at [[Hosshin-ji]] in [[Obama, Fukui]].

After obtaining the transmission of [[dharma]] (''[[Shiho|shihō]]'') from his [[teacher]] Miyaura Rōshi, Muhō decided to live as a [[Homelessness|homeless]] [[monk]] in a park in central [[Osaka]], where he led a ''zazen'' group in 2001. Six months later, in February 2002, he learned of the sudden death of his teacher and was called back to [[Antai-ji]]. He succeeded his teacher as the ninth [[abbot]] in the spring of that year. Apart from his responsibilities at Antai-ji, he is also teaching at [[Chigen-ji]], a Sōtō Zen priest seminary in [[Kyoto]] prefecture.&lt;ref&gt;http://chigenji.com/oshirase.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhō has published numerous books and translations in both Japanese and German. He has also featured in several short films, including documentaries by director [[Takeshi Kitano]] and broadcaster [[Peter Barakan]]'s "[[Begin Japanology]]", as well as [[Werner Penzel]]'s [[feature film]] "Zen for Nothing".

{{for|the historic branch of metaphysics|Natural philosophy}}
'''''Naturphilosophie''''' (German for "'''nature-philosophy'''"&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;) is a term used in English-language philosophy to identify a current in the [[philosophy|philosophical]] tradition of [[German idealism]], as applied to the study of [[nature]] in the earlier 19th century. German speakers use the clearer term ''Romantische Naturphilosophie'', the [[philosophy of nature]] developed at the time of the founding of [[German Romanticism]]. It is particularly associated with the philosophical work of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling]]&lt;ref name=Beiser&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser]](2002), ''German Idealism: The Struggle Against Subjectivism 1781-1801'', Harvard university Press, p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]&lt;ref name=Beiser/&gt;—though it has some clear precursors also. More particularly it is identified with some of the initial works of Schelling during the period 1797–9, in reaction to the views of Fichte, and subsequent developments from Schelling's position. Always controversial, some of Schelling's ideas in this direction are still considered of philosophical interest, even if the subsequent development of experimental [[natural science]] had a destructive impact on the credibility of the theories of his followers in ''Naturphilosophie''.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schelling/&lt;/ref&gt;

''Naturphilosophie'' attempted to comprehend nature in its totality and to outline its general theoretical structure, thus attempting to lay the foundations for the natural sciences. In developing their theories, the German ''Naturphilosophen'' found their inspiration in the [[natural philosophy]] of the Ancient Greek [[Ionian philosophers]].

As an approach to philosophy and science, ''Naturphilosophie'' has had a difficult reception. In Germany, [[Neo-Kantianism|Neo-Kantians]] came to distrust its developments as speculative and overly metaphysical.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cohen/&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the 19th and early 20th centuries, it was poorly understood in [[Anglophone]] countries. Over the years, it has been subjected to continuing criticism. Since the 1960s, improved translations have appeared, and scholars have developed a better appreciation of the objectives of ''Naturphilosophie''.

==Outline of development==

The German Idealist philosopher Fichte had attempted to show that the whole structure of reality follows necessarily from the fact of [[self-consciousness]]. Schelling took Fichte's position as his starting-point, and in his earliest writings posited that nature must have reality for itself. In this light Fichte's doctrines appeared incomplete. On the one hand, they identified the ultimate ground of the universe of reason too closely with finite, individual Spirit. On the other, they threatened the reality of the world of nature by seeing it too much in the manner of [[subjective idealism]]. Fichte, in this view, had not managed to unite his system with the [[aesthetic]] view of nature to which [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' had pointed.

''Naturphilosophie'' is therefore one possible theory of the unity of nature. Nature as the sum of what is objective, and intelligence as the complex of all the activities making up self-consciousness, appear as equally real. The philosophy of nature and [[transcendental idealism]] would be the two complementary portions making up philosophy as a whole.

==German philosophy==

''Naturphilosophie'' translated into English would mean just "philosophy of nature", and its scope began to be taken in a broad way. [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], particularly taken in opposition to [[Immanuel Kant]], was a precursor of Schelling:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Herder's dynamic view of nature was developed by Goethe and Schelling and led to the tradition of ''Naturphilosophie''[...]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/view/160/269&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] theorised about a particular German strand in philosophy of nature, citing [[Jakob Böhme]], [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Georg Ernst Stahl]], with [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] as an edge case.&lt;ref&gt;Paola Mayer, ''Jena Romanticism and Its Appropriation of Jakob Böhme: Theosophy, Hagiography, Literature'' (1999), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick Beiser]] instead traces ''Naturphilosophie'' as developed by Schelling, Hegel, Schlegel and [[Novalis]] to a crux in the theory of matter, and identifies the origins of the line they took with the ''[[vis viva]]'' theory of matter in the work of [[Gottfried Leibniz]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Beiser, 'The Enlightenment and Idealism', pp. 21–42, esp. pp. 32–33, in [[Karl Ameriks]] (editor) (2000), ''The Cambridge Companion to German Idealism''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently Schelling identified himself with [[Baruch Spinoza|Baruch de Spinoza]], to whose thought he saw himself as approaching. The ''Darstellung meines Systems'', and the expanded treatment in the lectures on a ''System der gesamten&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; Philosophie und der Naturphilosophie insbesondere'' given in [[Würzburg]] in 1804, contain elements of Spinoza's philosophy.

{{also|History of metaphysical realism}}
In a short space of time Schelling produced three works: ''Ideen zu einer Philosophie der Natur als Einleitung in das Studium dieser Wissenschaft'', 1797 (''Ideas for a Philosophy of Nature as Introduction to the Study of this Science''); ''Von der Weltseele'', 1798 (''On the World Soul''); and ''Erster Entwurf eines Systems der Naturphilosophie'', 1799 (First Plan of a System of the Philosophy of Nature).  As criticism of scientific procedure, these writings retain a relevance. Historically, according to Richards:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite the tentativeness of their titles, these monographs introduced radical interpretations of nature that would reverberate through the sciences, and particularly the biology, of the next century. They developed the fundamental doctrines of ''Naturphilosophie''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''System des transzendentalen Idealismus'', 1800 (''System of Transcendental Idealism'') Schelling included ideas on matter and the organic in Part III. They form just part of a more ambitious work that takes up other themes, in particular aesthetics. From this point onwards ''Naturphilosophie'' was less of a research concern for him, as he reformulated his philosophy. However, it remained an influential aspect of his teaching. For a short while, he edited a journal, the ''Neue Zeitschrift für speculative Physik'' (bound volume 1802).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/diglib/aufkl/nzsspekulativephys/index.htm Online text]&lt;/ref&gt;

Schelling's ''Naturphilosophie'' was a way in which he worked himself out of the tutelage of Fichte, with whom he quarrelled decisively towards the end of the 1790s. More than that, however, it brought him within the orbit of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], both intellectually and (as a direct consequence of Goethe's sympathetic attitude) by a relocation; and it broke with basic [[Kantian]] tenets. Grant writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Schelling's postkantian confrontation with nature itself begins with the overthrow of the [[Copernican Revolution (metaphor)|Copernican revolution]] ...&lt;ref&gt;Grant p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schelling held that the divisions imposed on nature, by our ordinary perception and thought, do not have absolute validity. They should be interpreted as the outcome of the single formative energy which is the soul or inner aspect of nature. In other words he was a proponent of a variety of [[organicism]]. The dynamic series of stages in nature, the forms in which the ideal structure of nature is realized, are matter, as the equilibrium of the fundamental expansive and contractive forces; light, with its subordinate processes (magnetism, electricity, and chemical action); organism, with its component phases of reproduction, irritability and sensibility. The continual change presented to us by experience, taken together with the thought of unity in productive force of nature, leads to the conception of the [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|duality]] through which nature expresses itself in its varied products.

In the introduction to the ''Ideen'' he argues against [[dogmatism]], in the terms that a dogmatist cannot explain the organic; and that recourse to the idea of a cosmic creator is a feature of dogmatic systems imposed by the need to explain nature as purposive and unified.&lt;ref&gt;Dale E. Snow, ''Schelling and the end of Idealism'' (1996), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Fichte's system, called the ''Wissenschaftslehre'', had begun with a fundamental distinction between dogmatism (fatalistic) and criticism (free), as his formulation of idealism.&lt;ref&gt;Beiser 2002, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beiser divides up the mature form of Schelling's ''Naturphilosophie'' into the attitudes of '''transcendental realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (the thesis that "nature exists independent of all consciousness, even that of the transcendental subject") and '''transcendental naturalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (the thesis that "everything is explicable according to the laws of nature, including the rationality of the transcendental subject").&lt;ref&gt;Beiser 2002, p. 483.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes how ''Naturphilosophie'' was first a counterbalance to ''Wissenschaftslehre'', and then in Schelling's approach became the senior partner. After that, it was hardly to be avoided that Schelling would become an opponent of Fichte, having been a close follower in the early 1790s.

We are able to apprehend and represent nature to ourselves in the successive forms which its development assumes, since it is the same spirit of which we become aware in self-consciousness, though here unconsciously. The variety of its forms is not imposed on it externally, since there is no external [[teleology]] in nature. Nature is a self-forming whole, within which only natural explanations can be sought. The function of ''Naturphilosophie'' is to exhibit the ideal as springing from the real, not to deduce the real from the ideal.

==Influence and critics of ''Naturphilosophie''==

Criticism of ''Naturphilosophie'' has been widespread, over two centuries. Schelling's theories, however influential in terms of the general culture of the time, have not survived in scientific terms. Like other strands of speculation in the [[life sciences]], in particular, such as [[vitalism]], they retreated in the face of experiment, and then were written out of the history of science as [[Whig history]]. But critics were initially not scientists (a term not used until later); rather they came largely from within philosophy and [[Romanticism in science|Romantic science]], a community including many physicians. Typically, the retrospective views of scientists of the 19th century on "Romantic science" in general erased distinctions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Scientific criticism in the nineteenth century took hardly any notice of the distinctions between Romantic, speculative and transcendental, scientific and aesthetic directions.&lt;ref name=DvE&gt;Dietrich von Engelhardt, ''Romanticism in Germany'' p. 112, in [[Roy Porter]] and [[Mikulaš Teich]], editors, ''Romanticism in National Context'' (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One outspoken critic was the chemist [[Justus von Liebig]], who compared ''Naturphilosophie'' with the [[Black Death]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Siegbert Prawer]] (editor), ''The Romantic Period in Germany'' (1970), Introduction by Prawer p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic, the physiologist [[Emil du Bois-Reymond]], frequently dismissed ''Naturphilosophie'' as "bogus."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reden|last=du Bois-Reymond|first=Emil|publisher=Veit|year=1912|isbn=|location=Leipzig|pages=vol. 2: 143, 258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in aesthetics===

[[Isaiah Berlin]] summed up the reasons why ''Naturphilosophie'' had a wide-ranging impact on views of art and artists:

&lt;blockquote&gt;if everything in nature is living, and if we ourselves are simply its most self-conscious representatives, the function of the artist is to delve within himself, and above all to delve within the dark and unconscious forces which move within him, and to bring these to consciousness by the most agonising and violent internal struggle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaiah Berlin]], ''The Roots of Romanticism'' (Henry Hardy, editor) (2000), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Philosophical criticism===

Fichte was very critical of the opposition set up in Schelling's ''Naturphilosophie'' to his own conception of ''Wissenschaftslehre''. In that debate, Hegel then intervened, largely supporting his student friend Schelling, with the work usually called his ''Differenzschrift'', the ''Differenz des Fichteschen und Schellingschen Systems der Philosophie'' (The Difference Between Fichte's and Schelling's System of Philosophy); a key publication in his own philosophical development, his first book, it was published in September 1801.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Pinkard, ''Hegel'' (2000), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schelling's Absolute was left with no other function than that of removing all the differences which give form to thought. The criticisms of Fichte, and more particularly of Hegel (in the Preface to the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''), pointed to a defect in the conception of the Absolute as mere featureless identity. It was ridiculed by Hegel as "the night in which all cows are black."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Phenomenology of Spirit|url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=xOnhG9tidGsC&amp;dq=The+Phenomenology+of+Spirit,+trans.+A.+V.+Miller&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|date = 1998-01-01|isbn = 9788120814738|language = en|first = Georg Wilhelm Friedrich|last = Hegel|first2 = A.

{{Christian mysticism |theo/phil}}
[[Neoplatonism]] was a major influence on [[Christian theology]] throughout [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]] in the West. This was due to [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine of Hippo]], who was influenced by the early Neoplatonists [[Plotinus]] and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], as well as the works of the Christian writer [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], who was influenced by later Neoplatonists, such as [[Proclus]] and [[Damascius]].

==Late antiquity==
Certain central tenets of Neoplatonism served as a philosophical interim for the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theology|theologian]] [[Augustine of Hippo]] on his journey from [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] [[Manichaeism]] to Christianity. As a Manichee, Augustine had held that evil has substantial being and that God is made of matter; when he became a Neoplatonist, he changed his views on these things. As a Neoplatonist, and later a Christian, Augustine believed that evil is a privation of good and that God is not material. Perhaps more importantly, the emphasis on mystical contemplation as a means to directly encounter God or the One, found in the writings of [[Plotinus]] and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], deeply affected Augustine.  He reports at least two [[mystical experience]]s in his Confessions which clearly follow the Neoplatonic model. According to his own account of his important discovery of 'the books of the Platonists' in ''Confessions'' Book 7, Augustine owes his conception of both God and the human soul as incorporeal substance to Neoplatonism.

When  writing his treatise 'On True Religion' several years after his 387 baptism, Augustine's [[Christianity]] was still tempered by Neoplatonism, but he eventually decided to abandon Neoplatonism altogether in favor of a Christianity based on his own reading of [[the Bible|Scripture]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Many other Christians were influenced by Neoplatonism, especially in their identifying the Neoplatonic One, or God, with [[Yahweh]]. The most influential of these would be [[Origen]], who potentially took classes from [[Ammonius Saccas]] (but this is not certain because there may have been a different philosopher, now called [[Origen the Pagan|Origen the pagan]], at the same time), and the late 5th century author known as [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]].  

Neoplatonism also had links with [[Gnosticism]], which Plotinus rebuked in his ninth tractate of the second ''[[Enneads]]'': "Against Those That Affirm The Creator of The Kosmos and The Kosmos Itself to Be Evil" (generally known as "Against The Gnostics"). 

Due to their belief being grounded in Platonic thought, the Neoplatonists rejected Gnosticism's vilification of Plato's [[demiurge]], the creator of the material world or cosmos discussed in the [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]. Although Neoplatonism has been referred to as orthodox Platonic philosophy by scholars like Professor [https://web.archive.org/web/20140816004048/http://www.unl.edu/classics/faculty/turner/triadaft.htm John D. Turner], this reference may be due in part to Plotinus' attempt to refute certain interpretations of Platonic philosophy, through his [[Enneads]]. Plotinus believed the followers of gnosticism had corrupted the original teachings of Plato.

Despite the influence this philosophy had on Christianity, [[Justinian I]] would hurt later Neoplatonism by ordering the closure of the refounded [[Platonic Academy|Academy of Athens]] in 529.&lt;ref&gt;See Rainer Thiel, ''Simplikios und das Ende der neuplatonischen Schule in Athen'', and [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2000/2000-04-19.html a review by Gerald Bechtle, University of Berne, Switzerland, in the Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2000.04.19]. Online version retrieved June 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==
Pseudo-Dionysius proved significant for both the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Byzantine]] and [[Roman Catholicism|Roman]] branches of Christianity.  His  works were translated into Latin by [[John Scotus Eriugena]] in the 9th century.

==Neo-Platonism in Orthodox theology==
From the days of the Early Church until the present, the Orthodox Church has made positive selective use of ancient Greek philosophy, particularly Socrates, Plato, Aristotle and the Stoics.&lt;ref&gt; Constantine Cavarnos, Orthodoxy and Philosophy, The Institute for Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies, 2003 pages &lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the term ‘logos’ (Greek  Λόγος ) originated with Heraclitus and meant reason or thought. In the Christian context, Logos takes on a deeper meaning and becomes a name for the second person of the Trinity. The writer and theologian Gregory Palamas gives four distinct meanings for the term ‘logos’.&lt;ref&gt; Gregory Palamas, ‘The One Hundred and Fifty Chapters’,  in The Philokalia, The Complete Text Volume 4, translated by Palmer, Sherrand and Ware, published 1995 Faber and Faber. pages 360-361&lt;/ref&gt;  The most important principle to keep in mind is that early Christianity developed in a Greek milieu and a common vocabulary was used in philosophical, spiritual and theological writing. However, the meanings of words sometimes evolved along different lines. In other cases, philosophical ideas and concepts were sometimes adapted and changed by Christian writers. Any exegetical endeavor trying to unravel the influence of Neo-Platonic thought on Christian theology needs to keep these principles in mind.  One should also note that philosophy was used quite differently in the Eastern and Western theological traditions. 

The writings attributed to Dionysius the Areopagite are among the most enigmatic works of late antiquity. Byzantine scholars such as Gregory Palamas cited Dionysius especially in matters of Mystical Theology such as theoria, the divine energies and the unknowability of God.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Palamas, The Triads, edited by John Meyendorff, Paulist Press 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;  At present, modern theologians and philosophers&lt;ref&gt; Sarah Coakley and Charles M. Stang, Re-thinking Dionysius the Areopagite, John Wiley and Sons, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; are still debating whether Dionysius was a Neo-Platonist with Christian influences or a Christian writer with Neo-Platonic influences. Among Orthodox scholars, the later view seems to be shared by such writers as Andrew Louth&lt;ref&gt; Andrew Louth, Denys the Areopagite, Continuum Books, 1989, Pages 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;  and Vladimir Lossky.&lt;ref&gt; Vladimir Lossky, The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church, St. Vladimir’s Seminary Press, page 29&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other Orthodox scholars such as John Meyendorff believe that the Neo-Platonism of Dionysius exerted both positive and negative influences on Orthodox theology.&lt;ref&gt;John Meyendorff, Byzantine Theology, Historical Trends and Doctrinal Themes, Fordham University Press, 1974, pages 27-28)&lt;/ref&gt;  Meyendorff maintains that Dionysius has led to some confusion in the areas of liturgical and ecclesiological formulations. 

==Renaissance==
[[Marsilio Ficino]], who translated Plotinus, Proclus, as well as Plato's complete works into Latin, was the central figure of a major Neoplatonist revival in the Renaissance.  His friend, [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] was also a major figure in this movement. Both were students of Jewish mystical [[Kabbalah]], which was heavily influenced by Neoplatonism. Renewed interest in Plotinian philosophy contributed to the rational theology and philosophy of the "[[Cambridge Platonist]]" circle (B. Whichcote, R. Cudworth, J. Smith, H. More, etc.).  Renaissance Neoplatonism also overlapped with or graded into various forms of [[Esoteric Christianity|Christian esotericism]].

==Christoplatonism==
Christoplatonism is a term used to refer to a [[dualistic cosmology|dualism]] opined by Plato, which influenced the [[Christian Church|Church]], which holds [[spirit]] is good but [[matter]] is evil.&lt;ref name="Christoplatonism"&gt;{{cite web|author=Robin Russell|title=Heavenly minded: It’s time to get our eschatology right, say scholars, authors|url=http://www.umportal.org/article.asp?id=5101|quote=Greek philosophers—who believed that spirit is good but matter is evil—also influenced the church, says Randy Alcorn, author of Heaven (Tyndale, 2004). He coined the term “Christoplatonism” to describe that kind of dualism, which directly contradicts the biblical record of God calling everything he created “good.”|publisher=UM Portal|date=6 April 2009|accessdate=10 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722154244/http://www.umportal.org/article.asp?id=5101|archivedate=22 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author [[Randy Alcorn]], Christoplatonism directly "contradicts the Biblical record of God calling everything He [[Genesis creation narrative|created]] good."&lt;ref name="Christoplatonism"/&gt;

The term '''Nile Valley Civilizations''' is sometimes used in [[Afrocentrism]] or [[Pan-Africanism]] to group a number of interrelated and interlocking, regionally distinct cultures that formed along the length of the [[Nile Valley]] from its headwaters in [[Ethiopia]], [[Egypt]] and Sudan to its mouth in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

Introduced around 1970,&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Ben-Jochannan, African origins of the major "Western religions", African-American heritage series, Alkebu-lan Books, 1970 [https://books.google.com/books?id=xANDAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Nile+Valley+Civilizations%22&amp;dq=%22Nile+Valley+Civilizations%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=I-hDTdHBFdXX4gaN_ZX9Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; it was popularized by [[Ivan Van Sertima]] in the 1980s and saw wide use in Afrocentric publications during the 1990s, e.g. 
Festus Ugboaja Ohaegbulam, ''Towards an understanding of the African experience from historical and contemporary perspectives'', University Press of America (1990);  Runoko Rashidi, ''Introduction to the study of African clasical [sic] civilizations'' (1992), Walter Arthur McCray, ''The Black Presence in the Bible: Discovering the Black and African Identity of Biblical Persons and Nations'', [[Urban Ministries]] Inc, (1995), etc.

'''Roger John Traynor''' (February 12, 1900 &amp;ndash; May 14, 1983) served as the 23rd [[Chief Justice of California]] from 1964 to 1970, and as an Associate Justice from 1940 to 1964.  A nationally respected [[jurist]], Traynor's 30-year career as California's 77th Justice coincided with tremendous demographic, social, and governmental growth in [[California]] and in the [[United States of America]], and was marked by a belief (in the words of his biographer, G. Edward White) that "the increased presence of [[government]] in American life was a necessary and beneficial phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;White, G. Edward (1987). "Introduction," in [http://uchastings.edu/?pid=1408 ''The Traynor Reader: A Collection of Essays by the Honorable Roger J. Traynor'']. San Francisco: The Hastings Law Journal, Hastings College of the Law.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, education and career==
Traynor was born and raised in [[Park City, Utah]], then a hardscrabble [[mining]] town, at the turn of the century by Felix and Elizabeth Traynor.  His parents were impoverished [[Irish people|Irish]] [[immigrant]]s from [[Hilltown, Northern Ireland|Hilltown]] in [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ledbetter|first1=Les|title=Roger J. Traynor, California Justice|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/17/obituaries/roger-j-traynor-california-justice.html|accessdate=October 6, 2017|work=New York Times|date=May 17, 1983|page=B7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, upon the advice of a high school teacher, he entered the [[University of California, Berkeley]], though he had only $500 in savings to finance his college education.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;  Fortunately, he won a [[scholarship]] at the end of his first year due to his excellent grades, and went on to earn a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1923, an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1924, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1926; all these degrees were in [[political science]].  He also earned a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from Boalt Hall in 1927. He earned the two latter degrees at the same time, while also teaching undergraduates and serving as editor-in-chief of the ''[[California Law Review]]''. He was subsequently admitted to the [[State Bar of California]] that same year.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

At Boalt Hall, Traynor wrote groundbreaking articles on [[taxation]], while serving as editor-in-chief of the ''California Law Review'', and later became a full-time [[professor]] in 1936.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=J. Edward|title=History of Supreme Court, Vol 2, Justices, 1900-1950|date=1966|publisher=Bancroft-Whitney Co.|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=182–196 |url=http://library.courtinfo.ca.gov/included/docs/SCJC_Vol_2.pdf|accessdate=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also acted as a [[consultant]] to the [[California State Board of Equalization]] from 1932 to 1940, and to the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] from 1937 to 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sales Taxes Cause Upset of Business|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=MT19330802.2.7&amp;srpos=8&amp;e=------193-en--20--1--txt-txIN-%22roger+j.+traynor%22-------1|accessdate=October 3, 2017|work=Madera Tribune|issue=79|publisher=California Digital Newspaper Collection|date=2 August 1933|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Officers to Collect Sales Tax Selected|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SBS19330803.1.15&amp;srpos=16&amp;e=------193-en--20--1--txt-txIN-%22roger+j.+traynor%22-------1|accessdate=October 3, 2017|work=San Bernardino Sun|agency=UPI|issue=39|publisher=California Digital Newspaper Collection|date=3 August 1933|page=15|quote=Roger J.

Before the [[Great Depression]], nearly all California governmental functions were funded ''only'' through a general property tax on both real and personal property. This proved unworkable when property values collapsed.  Through his work for the Board of Equalization, Traynor was responsible for creating much of California's modern tax regime, including the [[Vehicle registration plate|vehicle registration fee]] (1933), [[sales tax]] (1933), [[income tax]] (1935), [[use tax]] (1935), [[corporate income tax]] (1937), and [[fuel tax]] (1937).&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; He served as the first administrator of the California sales tax and supervised its deployment across 200,000 [[retail]]ers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Divide State for Sales Tax|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SBS19330809.1.1&amp;srpos=24&amp;e=------193-en--20--21--txt-txIN-roger+Traynor----1933---1|accessdate=October 3, 2017|work=San Bernardino Sun|agency=Associated Press|issue=39|publisher=California Digital Newspaper Collection|date=9 August 1933|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Business Men Confer With State Board About Troublesome Sales Tax Features|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SBS19330812.1.2&amp;srpos=23&amp;e=------193-en--20--21--txt-txIN-roger+Traynor----1933---1|accessdate=October 3, 2017|work=San Bernardino Sun|agency=Associated Press|issue=39|publisher=California Digital Newspaper Collection|date=12 August 1933|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Chief Explains New Sales Law: Director Traynor Clears Up Disputed Points," ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 4 August 1933, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1940, he started working part-time as a Deputy [[Attorney General]] under California Attorney General [[Earl Warren]] (who later became [[Chief Justice of the United States]]).&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;  He also started serving as Acting Dean of [[Boalt Hall]], UC Berkeley's law school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braitman|first1=Jacqueline R.|last2=Uelmen|first2=Gerald F.|title=Justice Stanley Mosk: A Life at the Center of California Politics and Justice|date=2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0786468416|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztAzK7_RGggC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=roger+traynor+acting+dean+uc+berkeley&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PKSC6CKWx6&amp;sig=W160IMbwhWOY7DIV6sHB22UhENU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiu5_iagczaAhVkh-AKHa0DBL0Q6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=roger%20traynor%20acting%20dean%20uc%20berkeley&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 31, 1940, Traynor was nominated to the Supreme Court of California by [[Governor of California|Governor]] [[Culbert Olson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Has Another Try Complete Court|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=MT19400731.2.15&amp;srpos=4&amp;e=------194-en--20--1--txt-txIN-%22roger+j.+traynor%22-------1|accessdate=October 3, 2017|work=Madera Tribune|issue=80|publisher=California Digital Newspaper Collection|date=31 July 1940|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunlap|first1=Jack W.|title=Politically Speaking: Warren Rebukes Olson, Governor Names Traynor, Youthful, Inexperienced|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=HTES19400805.2.26&amp;srpos=1&amp;e=------194-en--20--1--txt-txIN-%22roger+Traynor%22-------1|accessdate=October 3, 2017|work=Healdsburg Tribune, Enterprise and Scimitar|agency=UPI|issue=88|publisher=California Digital Newspaper Collection|date=5 August 1940|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was unanimously confirmed by the Qualifications Committee on August 13 and was sworn in the same day.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Traynor Accepted in Supreme Court, University Professor Takes Oath of Office|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=MT19400814.2.3&amp;srpos=3&amp;e=------194-en--20--1--txt-txIN-%22roger+j.+traynor%22-------1|accessdate=October 3, 2017|work=Madera Tribune|publisher=California Digital Newspaper Collection|date=14 August 1940|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1940, he was retained by the voters in the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunlap|first1=Jack W.|title=Politically Speaking: California is the Key State|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=HTES19401031.2.27&amp;srpos=2&amp;e=------194-en--20--1--txt-txIN-%22roger+Traynor%22-------1|accessdate=October 3, 2017|work=Healdsburg Tribune, Enterprise and Scimitar|agency=UPI|issue=9|publisher=California Digital Newspaper Collection|date=31 October 1940|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Johnson's Vote Makes Record in California|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=HTES19401209.2.20&amp;srpos=5&amp;e=------194-en--20--1--txt-txIN-%22roger+j.+traynor%22----1940---1|accessdate=October 3, 2017|work=Healdsburg Tribune, Enterprise and Scimitar|agency=UPI|issue=20|publisher=California Digital Newspaper Collection|date=9 December 1940|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1964, Chief Justice [[Phil S.

Traynor has generally been viewed by the American legal community as the single greatest [[judge]] in the history of the California [[judiciary]], and one of the greatest judges in the history of the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="friedman"&gt;Lawrence M. Friedman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JndnEiydTiYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=traynor&amp;f=false ''A History of American Law''] 3rd ed.

Retrieved October 3, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; His [[obituary]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'' noted that "Traynor was often called one of the greatest judicial talents never to sit on the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]."&lt;ref&gt;Les Ledbetter, [https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/17/obituaries/roger-j-traynor-california-justice.html "Roger J. Traynor, California Justice"],  ''[[New York Times]]'', 17 May 1983, B6. Retrieved October 3, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

His 1948 opinion in ''[[Perez v. Sharp]]'' was the first instance of a [[state supreme court]] striking down a [[statute]] prohibiting [[miscegenation]].  Traynor also wrote a 1952 opinion that abolished the defense of [[recrimination]] in the context of [[divorce]] and paved the way for the social revolution of [[no-fault divorce]].  But his most significant and well-known contribution to contemporary [[Law of the United States|American law]] is probably his 1963 creation of true strict liability in product liability cases.  An earlier generation of judges had cautiously experimented with [[legal fiction]]s like warranties to avoid leaving severely injured [[plaintiff]]s without any recourse.  Traynor simply threw those away and imposed strict liability as a matter of [[public policy]].
 
To those skeptical of government's power to redress social wrongs, Traynor's extraordinary work is notable for the degree to which it asserted the judiciary's power to resolve difficult issues of public policy, and to redefine the boundaries of corporate and governmental liability.  In his biography of Traynor, White wrote: "If California was a testing ground for governmental theories of modern liberalism, Traynor was an architect of a judicial role compatible with the activities of the modern liberal state."&lt;ref&gt;G. Edward White, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RTky8bDIXy0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''American Judicial Tradition: Profiles of Leading American Judges''], 3rd ed. (New York: Oxford University Press US, 2007), 247. {{ISBN|019972430X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his long and distinguished career, Traynor authored more than 900 opinions, and he gained a reputation as the nation's leading [[State court (United States)|state court]] judge.&lt;ref name="friedman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Editorial: Wright: Justice of Principle|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SBS19850328.1.10&amp;srpos=1&amp;e=------198-en--20--1--txt-txIN-%22roger+j.+Traynor%22-------1|accessdate=October 3, 2017|work=San Bernardino Sun|publisher=California Digital Newspaper Collection|date=28 March 1985|page=10|quote=Roger J.

Traynor}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure, the decisions of the Supreme Court of California became the most frequently cited by all other state courts in the nation.  Several of Traynor's decisions were majority opinions that transformed California from a conservative and somewhat repressive state into a progressive, innovative jurisdiction in the forefront of American law.&lt;ref&gt;DJ DeBenedictis, "Traynor dies at 83: led state court in progressive era," ''Los Angeles Daily Journal'', 17 May 1983, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Traynor was also noted for the quality of his writing and reasoning,&lt;ref&gt;Irving Younger, "Legal Writing All-Stars," ''ABA Journal'' 72, no. 12 (December 1986): 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt; and was honored during his lifetime with membership in the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (a rare honor for a judge).&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;  Many of his opinions are still mandatory reading for American law students. Also, Traynor did not uniformly join all opinions that could be characterized as "liberal" or "progressive" during his time on the Court; for example, he filed a two-sentence dissent in the landmark case of ''[[Dillon v. Legg]]'' (1968),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dillon v. Legg]]'' (1968), [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C2/68C2d728.htm 68 Cal. 2d 728]&lt;/ref&gt; which was a major step towards the modern tort of [[negligent infliction of emotional distress]].

==Criticism==
The liberal tendencies of much of Traynor's work has since made him the subject of extensive criticism from American [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and [[conservatism|conservatives]], and [[tort reform]]ers have often grouped Traynor together with Earl Warren as examples of [[judicial activism|judicial activist]]s.  For example, the conservative magazine ''[[National Review]]'' attacked Traynor's reasoning in the [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] case (''Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. G. W. Thomas Drayage Co.'', 69 Cal. 2d 33 (1968)) in a 1991 cover story.&lt;ref&gt;L. Gordon Crovitz and Stephen Bates, "How law destroys order," ''[[National Review]]'', 11 February 1991, 28-33&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, ''Regulation'' (the [[Cato Institute]]'s journal) published a harsh critique of the California tort law system by Stephen Hayward. He claimed that "rather than protecting life, liberty, and property, [it] has ... become a threat to these."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hayward, [http://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv17n3/reg17n3-hayward.html "Golden Lawsuits in the Golden State"],  ''Regulation'' 17, no. 3 (Summer 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; In blunt language, Hayward identified Roger Traynor's liberalizing influence on the Court's view of liability as "the first breach":

{{quote|In the 1944 case of ''Escola v. Coca Cola Bottling Co.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C2/24C2d453.htm ''Escola v. Coca Cola Bottling Co.''] (1944), 50 P.2d 436, 24 Cal. 2d 453.&lt;/ref&gt; ... Traynor introduced the idea of broad social fault. "I believe," Traynor wrote, "the manufacturer's negligence should no longer be singled out as the basis of a plaintiff's right to recover in cases like the present one." .... "Even if there is no negligence," Traynor wrote further, "public policy demands that responsibility be fixed wherever it will most effectively reduce the hazards to life and health inherent in defective products that reach the market." Note the appeal to the demands of public policy, rather than law .... While this line of reasoning might be the basis for a legislative debate over which public policies should be adopted to allocate and compensate for risk, Justice Traynor's opinion represents a clear case of legislation by judicial fiat.}}

In a 1966 essay addressed to both the legal community of his time and future generations, Traynor defended his judicial philosophy:

{{quote|There are always some who note with alarm any appellate opinion that goes beyond a mechanical canvass of more or less established precedents.  They include the diehards, dead set against all but familiar routines.  They include the slothful, who would rationalize their own inertia.  They also include carpers hostile toward any enlightenment, who would knowingly impair judicial vigil by keeping the visibility low.  Slyly they equate justice with the [[Lady Justice|blindfold image]] without articulating the corollary that decision would then be reduced to a blind toss of the coin.  They do not state how problematic are the problems that reach the Supreme Court, and how great the need for judicial reasoning beyond formulas.&lt;ref&gt;Roger J. Traynor, "The Supreme Court's Watch On The Law," in [http://library.courtinfo.ca.gov/included/docs/SCJC_Vol_2.pdf ''History of the Supreme Court Justices of California: Volume II, 1900-1950''], ed. J. Edward Johnson, 206-211 (San Francisco: Bancroft-Whitney Company, 1966), 211. Retrieved October 3, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Retirement==
On January 2, 1970, Traynor announced his [[retirement]] in order to avoid losing eligibility for retirement benefits under a California law that stripped judges of most benefits if they chose to remain on the bench past age 70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reagan Has First Chance To Name a State Justice|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=DS19700105.2.55&amp;srpos=2&amp;e=------197-en--20--1--txt-txIN-%22roger+j.+Traynor%22-------1|accessdate=October 3, 2017|work=Desert Sun|agency=UPI|issue=130|publisher=California Digital Newspaper Collection|date=5 January 1970|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Coast Chief Justice to Resign; Reagan Will Choose Successor," ''[[New York Times]]'', 3 January 1970, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; He became chairman of the National News Council, concerned with [[freedom of the press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Freedom of Press' Has Own Roadblocks|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=DS19730703.2.34&amp;srpos=3&amp;e=------197-en--20--1--txt-txIN-%22roger+j.+Traynor%22-------1|accessdate=October 3, 2017|work=Desert Sun|agency=UPI|publisher=California Digital Newspaper Collection|date=3 July 1973|page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Florida Rule Threat to Freedom of Press|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=DS19731110.2.39&amp;srpos=5&amp;e=------197-en--20--1--txt-txIN-%22roger+j.+Traynor%22-------1|accessdate=October 3, 2017|work=Desert Sun|agency=UPI|publisher=California Digital Newspaper Collection|date=10 November 1973|page=3A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nixon's Charges Under Study|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=DS19731117.2.32&amp;srpos=6&amp;e=------197-en--20--1--txt-txIN-%22roger+j.+Traynor%22-------1|accessdate=October 3, 2017|work=Desert Sun|agency=Capitol News Service|publisher=California Digital Newspaper Collection|date=17 November 1973|page=A4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, he retired to [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and subsequently died there in his home from [[cancer]].

In July 1983, the ''California Law Review'' gave over all its space in issue 4, volume 71 to publishing eloquent tributes to Justice Traynor from several esteemed judges, law professors, and [[politician]]s, including [[Warren Burger]], [[Henry Friendly]], and [[Pat Brown|Edmund G. Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;Warren Burger, "A tribute," ''California Law Review'' 71, no. 4 (July 1983): 1037-1038, Henry J.

Brown, "A judicial giant," ''California Law Review'' 71, no. 4 (July 1983): 1053-1054.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
On August 23, 1933, Traynor married Madeleine Emilie Lackman, a woman who shared his love of learning: she already held a [[Master's degree|M.A.]] in political science from UC Berkeley and would go on to earn a J.D. in 1956.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;  They had three sons: Michael, Joseph, and Stephen.  Michael followed his father into law; he attended [[Harvard Law School]], became a partner with [[Cooley Godward Kronish LLP]], and has served as president of The [[American Law Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press release: Cooley Litigator, Michael Traynor, Named to American Academy of Appellate Lawyers|url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/cooley-litigator-michael-traynor-named-to-american-academy-of-appellate-lawyers-690378.htm|website=Marketwired.com|publisher=Cooley Godward LLP|accessdate=October 3, 2017|date=April 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ali.org/members/member/100702/ Michal Traynor profile].

'''Serge Moscovici''' (June 14, 1925 in [[Brăila]], [[Romania]] as ''Srul Herş Moscovici'' –  November 15, 2014 in [[Paris]])&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2014/11/16/serge-moscovici-figure-de-la-psychologie-sociale-est-mort_4524344_3382.html&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Romania]]n-born [[France|French]] [[social psychology|social psychologist]], director of the ''[[Laboratoire Européen de Psychologie Sociale]]'' ("European Laboratory of Social Psychology"), which he co-founded in 1974 at the ''[[Maison des sciences de l'homme]]'' in [[Paris]]. He was a member of the [[European Academy of Sciences and Arts]] and Officer of the ''[[Légion d'honneur]]'', as well as a member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] and honorary member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]. Moscovici's son, [[Pierre Moscovici]], is the current European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs.

Born in [[Brăila]] to [[Jewish]] parents who were grain merchants,&lt;ref name="balzan"&gt;{{cite web|title=2003 Balzan Prize for Social Psychology|url=http://www.balzan.org/en/prizewinners/serge-moscovici|website=[[Balzan Prize|Fondazione Internazionale Premio Balzan]] (International Balzan Prize Foundation)|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moscovicijurnalul"&gt;{{ro icon}} Lavinia Betea, [http://www.jurnalul.ro/articole/60354/moscovici-victima-regimului-antonescu "Moscovici, victima regimului Antonescu"], in ''[[Jurnalul Naţional]]'', October 24, 2004 (retrieved June 17, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Moscovici frequently relocated, together with his father, spending time in [[Cahul]], [[Galaţi]], and [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref name="balzan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moscovicijurnalul"/&gt; (Later he would indicate that his stay in [[Basarabia]] had contributed to his image of a homeland.&lt;ref name="moscovicijurnalul"/&gt;) From an early age Moscovici suffered the effects of [[Anti-semitism|anti-semitic discrimination]]: in 1938, he was expelled from a [[Bucharest]] high school on the basis of newly-issued anti-semitic legislation.&lt;ref name="balzan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moscovicijurnalul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="instreperes"&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://psycho.univ-lyon2.fr/article.php3?id_article=347 ''Serge Moscovici.

Moscovici trained as a [[mechanic]] at the Bucharest [[vocational school]] ''Ciocanul''.&lt;ref name="moscovicijurnalul"/&gt; Faced with an ideological choice between [[Zionism]] and [[communism]], he opted for the latter, and, in 1939, joined the then-illegal [[Romanian Communist Party]], being introduced by a clandestine activist whom he knew by the pseudonym ''Kappa''.&lt;ref name="moscovicijurnalul"/&gt;
 
During [[World War II]] Moscovici witnessed the [[Iron Guard]]-instigated [[Legionnaires' Rebellion and Bucharest Pogrom|Bucharest Pogrom]] in January 1941. Later the [[Ion Antonescu]] régime interned him in a [[Penal labour|forced-labor camp]], where, together with other persons of his age, he worked on construction teams until freed by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] in 1944.&lt;ref name="balzan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moscovicijurnalul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="instreperes"/&gt; During those years he taught himself [[French language|French]] and educated himself by reading philosophical works (including those of [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[René Descartes]]).&lt;ref name="balzan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="instreperes"/&gt;

Subsequently, Moscovici travelled extensively, notably visiting [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], [[Germany]] and [[Austria]].&lt;ref name="balzan"/&gt; During the late stages of [[World War II]] he met [[Isidore Isou]], the founder of [[lettrism]], with whom he founded the artistic and literary review ''Da'' towards the end of 1944 (''Da'' was quickly [[censorship|censored]]{{by whom|date=August 2016}}).&lt;ref name="instreperes"/&gt; Refusing promotion on the basis of political affiliation at a time when the Communist Party participated in Romania's governments, he became instead a [[welder]] in the large Bucharest factory owned by [[Nicolae Malaxa]].&lt;ref name="moscovicijurnalul"/&gt;

Initially welcoming [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation]], Moscovici grew increasingly disillusioned with communist politics, and noted the incidence of anti-Semitism among Red Army soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ştefan Ionescu, [http://www.idee.ro/holocaust/pdf/mem_supr.pdf ''În umbra morţii. Memoria supravieţuitorilor Holocaustului în România''], at [http://www.idee.ro/ Idee Communication] (retrieved June 17, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] was taking over and the [[Cold War]] started, he helped Zionist dissidents cross the border illegally.&lt;ref name="moscovicijurnalul"/&gt; For this, he was involved in a 1947 trial held in [[Timişoara]], and decided to leave Romania definitively.&lt;ref name="moscovicijurnalul"/&gt; Choosing clandestine immigration, he arrived in France a year later, having passed through [[Hungary]] and Austria, and having spent time in a [[refugee camp]] in [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="balzan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moscovicijurnalul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="instreperes"/&gt;

In [[Paris]], helped by a refugee fund, he studied [[psychology]] at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] while employed by an industrial enterprise.&lt;ref name="balzan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="instreperes"/&gt; At the time, Moscovici became close to Paris-based writers, including the Romanian-born Jewish [[Paul Celan]] and {{ill|Isac Chiva|fr}}.&lt;ref name="balzan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chiva"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Isaac Chiva]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=15837&amp;print=true "Pogromul de la Iaşi"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'' (retrieved June 17, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to himself, Celan, and Moscovici, Chiva later recalled: &lt;blockquote&gt;"For us, people on the [[Left-wing politics|Left]], but who had fled communism, the first period in Paris, in a capital where the intellectual environments were developing under full-scale [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] enthusiasm, was very harsh. We were caught between a rock and a hard place: on one side, the French university environment who saw us as «[[Fascism|fascists]]». [...] On the other, the Romanian exiles, most of all the [[Nationalism|nationalist]] students, when not outright on the [[far right]], who did not shy away from denouncing us as communist «[[Mole (espionage)|moles]]» in the pay of Bucharest or [[Moscow]]."&lt;ref name="chiva"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moscovici's 1961 thesis (''La psychanalyse, son image, son public''), directed by the [[psychoanalyst]] [[Daniel Lagache]], explored the [[social representations]] of psychoanalysis in France.&lt;ref name="instreperes"/&gt; Moscovici also studied [[epistemology]] and [[history of science]]s with philosopher [[Alexandre Koyré]]. During the 1960s [[Princeton University]]'s [[Institute for Advanced Study]] invited him to the [[United States]]; he worked at [[Stanford University]] and at [[Yale University|Yale]] before returning to Paris to teach at the ''[[École pratique des hautes études]]''.&lt;ref name="balzan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="instreperes"/&gt; Serge Moscovici served as a visiting professor at [[the New School]] in [[New York City]], at the [[Rousseau Institute]] in [[Geneva]], as well as at the ''[[Université catholique de Louvain]]'' and at the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="instreperes"/&gt;

By 1968, together with [[Brice Lalonde]] and others, he became involved in [[green politics]], and ran in elections for the office of [[List of mayors of Paris|Mayor of Paris]] for what later became ''[[The Greens (France)|Les Verts]]''.&lt;ref name="moscovicijurnalul"/&gt; A [[doctor honoris causa|doctor ''honoris causa'']] of several universities, Moscovici received the [[Balzan Prize]] in 2003 for social psychology.&lt;ref name="balzan"/&gt;

In 1997, Serge Moscovici authored an [[Autobiography|autobiographical]] essay titled ''Chronique des années égarées'' ("Chronicle of the Mislaid Years"). It was translated into [[Romanian language|Romanian]] as ''Cronica anilor risipiţi'' (published by [[Polirom]] in 1999).

In commemoration of his elaborate and significant contribution to the world of psychology and society in general, several awards, medals, lectures have been established.Notable among these are:

1.Serge Moscovici Medal awarded by the European Association of Social Psychology(EASP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serge Moscovici Medal|url=http://www.easp.eu/about/awards/serge-moscovici-medals/|publisher=European Association of Social Psychology|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2."Serge Moscovici" Values-Based Leadership Award by the Aspen Institute Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Serge Moscovici" Leadership Award|url=http://test.aspeninstitute.ro/articole/aspen-leadership-awards-and-gala-dinner-2015|accessdate=2 September 2016|publisher=Aspen Institute Romania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
His research focus was on [[group psychology]] and he began his career by investigating the way knowledge is reformulated as groups take hold of it, distorting it from its original form. His theory of ''social representations'' is now widespread in understanding this process of cultural  ''[[Telephone (game)|Chinese whispers]]''. Influenced by [[Gabriel Tarde]], he later criticized American research into majority influence ([[conformity (psychology)|conformity]]) and instead investigated the effects of minority influence, where the opinions of a small group influence those of a larger one.&lt;ref name="balzan"/&gt; He also researched the dynamics of group decisions and consensus-forming.

===Minority influence===
{{main|Conversion theory of minority influence}}
Moscovici claimed that majority influence in many ways was misleading – if the majority was indeed all-powerful, we would all end up thinking the same.&lt;ref name="balzan"/&gt; Drawing attention to the works of [[Gabriel Tarde]], he pointed to the fact that most major social movements have been started by individuals and small groups (e.g. [[Christianity]], [[Buddhism]], the [[Suffragette]] movement, [[Nazism]], etc.) and that without an outspoken minority, we would have no innovation or social change.

The study he is most famous for, ''Influences of a consistent minority on the responses of a majority in a colour perception task'', is now seen as one of the defining investigations into the effects of minority influence:
*Aims: To investigate the process of innovation by looking at how a consistent minority affect the opinions of a larger group, possibly creating doubt and leading them to question and alter their views
*Procedures: Participants were first given an eye test to check that they were not colour blind. They were then placed in a group of four participants and two confederates. they were all shown 36 slides that were different shades of blue and asked to state the colour out loud. There were two groups in the experiment. In the first group the confederates were consistent and answered green for every slide. In the second group the confederates were inconsistent and answered green 24 times and blue 12 times.
*Findings: For 8.42% of the trials, participants agreed with the minority and said that the slides were green. Overall, 32% of the participants agreed at least once.
*Conclusions: The study suggested that minorities can indeed exert an effect over the opinion of a majority. Not to the same degree as majority influence, but the fact that almost a third of people agreed at least once is significant. However, this also leaves two thirds who never agreed. In a follow up experiment, Moscovici demonstrated that consistency was the key factor in [[minority influence]]; by instructing the stooges to be inconsistent, the effect fell off sharply.

[[File:Dc morita.jpg|right|thumb|Dr. Shoma Morita (1874-1938)]]
'''Morita Masatake''' (1874-1938), also read as '''Morita Shoma''' (森田 正馬), was a contemporary of [[Sigmund Freud]] and the founder of [[Morita therapy]], a branch of [[clinical psychology]] strongly influenced by [[Zen]] Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religion and Psychotherapy in Modern Japan|publisher=Routledge|date=2014|editor1-first=Christopher|editor1-last=Harding|editor2-last=Iwata|editor2-first=Fumiaki|editor3-last=Yoshinaga|editor3-first=Shin’ichi|chapter=The Mind and Healing in Morita Therapy|last1=Kondo|first1=Kyoichi|last2=Kitanishi|first2=Kenji|isbn=9781317682998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his capacity as the head of [[psychiatry]] for a large [[Tokyo]] hospital, Morita began developing his methods while working with sufferers of ''shinkeishitsu'', or anxiety disorders with a hypochondriac base.

==Theory and methods==
According to Morita, how a person feels is important as a [[Wikt:sensation|sensation]] and as an indicator for the present moment, but is uncontrollable: we don't create feelings, feelings happen to us. Since feelings do not cause our behavior, we can coexist with unpleasant feelings while still taking constructive action.

The essence of Morita's method maybe summarized in three rules: Accept all your feelings, know your purpose(s), and do what needs to be done. When once asked what shy people should do, Morita replied, "Sweat."

*'''Accept your feelings''' - Accepting feelings is not ignoring them or avoiding them, but welcoming them; [[Vietnam]]ese poet and writer [[Nhat Hanh|Thich Nhat Hanh]] recommends we say, "Hello Loneliness, how are you today? Come, sit by me and I will take care of you." Morita's advice: "In feelings, it is best to be wealthy and generous" - that is, have many and let them fly as they wish.
*'''Know your purpose''' - Implicit in Morita's method, and the traditional Buddhist psychological principles which he adapted, is an independence of thought and action, something a little alien to the Western ideal to "follow our whims and moods". Morita held that we can no more control our thoughts than we can control the weather, as both are phenomena of most amazingly complex natural systems. And if we have no hope of controlling our emotions, we can hardly be held responsible any more than we can be held responsible for feeling hot or cold. We do, however, have complete dominion over our behavior, and for Morita, that is a sacred responsibility. "What needs doing now?" is like a [[mantra]] in his methods.
*'''Do what needs doing''' - One can feel crushed and alone or hurt and homicidal while pulling up the weeds in your garden, but one would not be doing it at all if one had not intended to raise flowers. Morita's way of treatment is very different from the Western [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]]/disease model. Morita's methods lead his "students" through experiments, and in each assignment, the lesson is not explained by a master, but learned first hand, through the "doing" or ''taiken'', that knowledge gained by direct experience.

Perhaps most notable of Morita's foreign followers is [[David K. Reynolds]]. Dr. Reynolds synthesized parts of [[Morita therapy]] along with the practice of [[Naikan]] into [[Constructive Living]], an educational method intended for English-speaking Westerners. Constructive Living has since become extremely popular in Japan. [[Fritz Perls]] spent a week in a Morita Hospital in Japan.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

'''Sunim''' is the [[Korean language|Korean]] title for a [[Buddhist monk]] or [[Buddhist nun]]. It is considered respectful to refer to senior monks or nuns in [[Korea]] as ''Kun sunim''. In most Korean temples, a middle-aged monk assumes the role of a ''juji sunim'', who serves administrative functions. The eldest sunim is typically seen as a symbolic leader of the younger sunims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =[[Daehaeng_Sunim|Daehaeng]] Sunim| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =No River to Cross: Trusting the Enlightenment That's Always Right Here| publisher =Wisdom Publications| year =2007| pages 96-97=| url =http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/133465561&amp;referer=one_hit| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-86171-534-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Kwan| first =Okyun| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Buddhist and Protestant Korean Immigrants: Religious Beliefs and Socioeconomic Aspects of Life| publisher =LFB Scholarly Publishing| year =2003| location =| page =125| url =http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56995147&amp;referer=one_hit| doi =| id = | isbn = 1-931202-65-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Song of the Sannyasin''''' is a poem of thirteen verses written by [[Swami Vivekananda]]. Vivekananda composed the poem in July 1895 when he was delivering a series of lectures to a groups of selected disciples at the [[Wellesley Island|Thousand Island Park]], New York. In the poem he defined the ideals of ''[[Sannyasa]]'' or monastic life.&lt;ref name="HT 116—118"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hinduism Today|1999|pp=116–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chakrabarti 73–75"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chakrabarti|1998|pp=73–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In the beginning of 1895, American disciples of Vivekananda requested him to organize a special session of lectures throughout the summer. Though Vivekananda was very tired at this time after multiple long sessions of public and private lectures, he assented. From mid-June to early August 1895, Vivekananda delivered a series of lectures to a group of selected disciples at the [[Wellesley Island|Thousand Island Park]], New York.&lt;ref name="Sheean p346—347"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sheean|2005|pp=346–347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michelis p121"&gt;{{Harvnb|Michelis|2005|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this period, sometime in July 1895 Vivekananda wrote ''The Song of the Sannyasin''.&lt;ref name="HT 116—118" /&gt;

== Theme ==
[[File:The Song of the Sannyasin manuscript portion.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A portion of the manuscript in Vivekananda's own handwriting.]]
In the poem Vivekananda glorified [[Hindu]] concepts on ''[[Sannyasa]]'' and defined the ideals of monastic life. For centuries it has been a tradition in India to revere ''Sannyasi''s and encourage people (especially the younger ones) to work for self-realization God realization. According to Hindu beliefs, 'Sannyasa'' is the best path of life one can take. In these 13 short poems, Vivekananda discusses the concept, beliefs and ideals of ''Sannyasa'' or monastic life.&lt;ref name="HT 116—118" /&gt;

Mohit Chakrabarti in his book ''Swami Vivekananda: A Poetic Visionary'', called these poems as Vivekananda's religious introspection. Chakrabarti told— "Quote apart from the utilitarian and segmentary approach to religion more often than not prone to achieving a platform of materialistic superiority, the religion that Vivekananda highlights here is one of emancipation of man by means of sustained devotion to and involvement in knowledge, truth and freedom."&lt;ref name="Chakrabarti 73–75" /&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Verse I'''&lt;/center&gt;
Wake up the note! the song that had its birth
Far off, where worldly taint could never reach,
In mountain caves and glades of forest deep,
Whose calm no sigh for lust or wealth or fame
Could ever dare to break; where rolled the stream
Of knowledge, truth, and bliss that follows both.
Sing high that note, Sannyâsin bold! Say—
"Om Tat Sat, Om!"
&lt;/poem&gt;
|
&lt;poem&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Verse II'''&lt;/center&gt;
Strike off thy fetters! Bonds that bind thee down,
Of shining gold, or darker, baser ore ;
Love, hate—good, bad—and all the dual throng,
Know, slave is slave, caressed or whipped, not free ;
For fetters, though of gold, are not less strong to bind ;
Then off with them, Sannyâsin bold! Say—
"Om Tat Sat, Om!"
&lt;/poem&gt;
|
&lt;poem&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Verse III'''&lt;/center&gt;
Let darkness go; the will-o'-the-wisp that leads
With blinking light to pile more gloom on gloom.
This thirst for life, for ever quench ; it drags
From birth to death, and death to birth, the soul.
He conquers all who conquers self. Know this
And never yield, Sannyâsin bold! Say—
"Om Tat Sat, Om!"
&lt;/poem&gt;

According to Kalpana Mohapatra, ''The Song of the Sannyasin'' is the Bible of Bengal.&lt;ref name="Mohapatra 10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mohapatra|1996|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also considered as a source of inspiration for Hindu monks, specially the monks of [[Ramakrishna Mission|Ramakrishna Order]] find solace, inspiration and guidance from these poems.

'''Vasiliy Vasilievich Nalimov''' (Васи́лий Васи́льевич Нали́мов; 4 November 1910 – 19 January 1997) was a [[Russia]]n [[philosopher]] and [[Humanism|humanist]] and wrote on [[Transpersonal psychology|Transpersonal Psychology]]. His main areas of research were the philosophy of probability and its biological, mathematical, and linguistic manifestations. He also studied the roles of [[gnosticism]] and [[mysticism]] in [[science]]. Thompson (1993) summarizes Nalimov as: "...philosopher, educator, devoted husband, mathematician, dissident, writer, and (although he may deny it) visionary".

Nalimov has a reputation as a founder of the area of [[Scientometrics]], as he coined the Russian term "Naukometriya" in 1969, together with Mulchenko.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
He was not proposing the concept of [[citation index]], as sometimes claimed. That idea reaches much further back (1873) and was first professionally used in the area of law to look up related cases [[Shepard's Citations]]. It was introduced on a large scale for science first by [[Eugene Garfield]].

Nalimov's father, Vasily Petrovich, obtained a formal medical degree in Moscow, was an [[anthropologist]] and [[ethnographer]] and was considered a [[shaman]] by his community. Nalimov's mother, Nadezhda Ivanovna, was among the first group of women to graduate as [[physician]]s in Russia.

Nalimov was a co-worker of the mathematician [[Andrey Kolmogorov]].  [[Rustum Roy]] held Nalimov in high regard and sponsored some of his works.

'''''Yeridat ha-dorot''''' ([[Hebrew]]: ירידת הדורות), meaning literally "the decline of the generations", or '''''nitkatnu ha-dorot''''' (נתקטנו הדורות), meaning "the diminution of the generations", is a concept in classical [[Rabbinic Judaism]] and contemporary [[Orthodox Judaism]] expressing a belief in the intellectual inferiority of subsequent, and contemporary [[Torah]] scholarship and spirituality in comparison to that of the past. It is held to apply to the transmission of the "Revealed" (''nigleh'') aspects of [[Torah study]], embodied in the legal and homiletic [[Talmud]], and other mainstream [[rabbinic literature]] scholarship. Its reasoning derives from the weaker claim to authoritative traditional interpretation of scripture, in later stages of a lengthening historical chain of transmission from the original revelation of the Torah at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], and the codification of the [[Oral Torah]] in the Talmud. This idea provides the basis to the designated Rabbinic Eras from the [[Tannaim]] and [[Amoraim]] of the Talmud, to the subsequent [[Gaonim]], [[Rishonim]] and [[Acharonim]]. Additionally, it has an extra [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] explanation in [[Kabbalah]], regarding lower levels of souls in succeeding generations.

However, Kabbalah limits the effect of ''Yeridat ha-dorot'' only to ''nigleh''. In contrast, the "Concealed" (''nistar'') aspects of Torah, embodied in [[Jewish mysticism]], are identified with an opposite process of successively higher articulations of mystical thought as the process of history unfolds. The reasoning for this derives from the notion that Jewish mysticism progresses instead from successive new divine revelations to [[Tzadik|supreme mystics]], as the only way to deepen its conceptual structures. This paradoxical [[dialectic]] relates in Kabbalistic terminology to descending immanent "[[Ohr|Vessels]]", and successively higher transcendent "[[Ohr|Lights]]" through the history of creation. In Jewish thought, deepening Talmudic and [[Jewish philosophy|Rationalist]] enquiry broadens the physical application of Torah (vessels), while deepening Jewish mysticism draws down higher levels of illumination (light).

One of the first expressions of the idea appears in the [[Talmudic]] adage found in [[Shabbos (tractate)|Shabbos]] 112b (Soncino):
{{quote|[[R. Zera]] said in [[Raba bar Zimuna]]'s name: If the earlier [scholars] were sons of angels, we are sons of men; and if the earlier [scholars] were sons of men, we are like asses...}}

The idea is found in many other classical Jewish sources, and underlies the reluctance of the Torah scholars in a particular generation to challenge the legal rulings of a previous generation.  {{Harvtxt|Weiss-Halivni|1993}} discusses the relationship between the principle of ''yeridat ha-dorot'' and the seemingly contrary principle of ''chate'u Yisrael'' ("''Israel sinned''," referring to a failure in transmission of the tradition), an idea invoked to explain cases where ''[[derash]]'' (exegetical interpretation) trumps ''[[peshat]]'' (plain reading) in order to restore original intent.

==Eras of Rabbinic Judaism==

{{Eras of the Halakha}}

Rabbinic tradition divides its historical development into distinct eras. According to traditional interpretation, scholars in one era within [[Halachic]] development (legal codification of Jewish observance) do not challenge the rulings of previous-era scholars.

[[Chazal]] is an acronym for "Chachameinu Zichronam Livracha" ("Our Sages may their memory be blessed"). In Rabbinic writings this refers to all Sages of the [[Talmud]] and other [[Rabbinic literature]] commentators, from the times of the Second Temple of Jerusalem until the 6th century. Up until the end of the [[Savoraim]] era, Chazal had the authority to commentate the Torah according to the [[Talmudical Hermeneutics]] standards required by the law given to Moses at Sinai (The non written laws handed to Moses at Sinai). Nowadays, this authority is not delegated to the current generation's Sages, and thus the Torah can not be commentated on, in matters concerning the [[Halakha]], if it is in contradiction to Chazal's commentary. Earlier on, up until the midst of the [[Tannaim]] era, when there was a Sanhedrin (a [[Halakha|Jewish law]] court), Chazal had also the authority to decree predestinations and to enact new religious regulations, in any matter they saw fit, concerning issues that were not included in the written "Torah", or were not handed at Biblical Mount Sinai.

[[Rishonim]] ("the first ones") were the leading Rabbis and [[Poskim]] (Halachic decisors) who lived approximately during the 11th to 15th centuries, in the era before the writing of the [[Shulkhan Arukh]] (Code of Jewish Law) and following the [[Geonim]]. Rabbinic scholars subsequent to the Shulkhan Arukh are known as [[Acharonim]] ("the latter ones"). The distinction between Rishonim and Geonim is meaningful historically; in Halakha (Jewish Law) the distinction is less important. According to a widely held view in [[Orthodox Judaism]], Acharonim generally cannot dispute the rulings of Rabbis of previous eras unless they find support of other Rabbis in previous eras. On the other hand, this view is not formally a part of Halakhah itself. Acharonim is a term used in Jewish law and history, to signify the leading Rabbis and Poskim living from roughly the 16th century to the present. The publication of the Shulkhan Arukh marks the transition from the era of the Rishonim to the Acharonim. The question of which prior rulings can and cannot be disputed has led to efforts to define which rulings are within the Acharonim era with precision. According to many Rabbis the Shulkhan Arukh is from an Acharon. Some hold that Rabbi [[Yosef Karo]]'s Beit Yosef has the Halakhic status of a work of a Rishon, while his later Shulkhan Arukh has the status of a work of an Acharon.

The 18th century [[Vilna Gaon]] was one of the most influential Rabbinic authorities since the Middle Ages; although he is counted among the Acharonim, he is held by many authorities after him as belonging to the Rishonim.

==Generational ascent in Kabbalah==

[[Kabbalah]] tends to supports the [[Halachic]] notion of the Descent of the Generations, by relating it to a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] structure of descending levels of souls in each subsequent generation. Through processes such as [[Gilgul]] (Reincarnation), all souls are held to derive from the original collective soul of Adam. As the [[Sephirot]] relate the powers of the soul metaphorically to the image of Man, so the souls of Israel derive from different aspects of Adam; supreme [[Tzadik]]im who lead the community from his "head", down to simple souls of his "feet". In this way, the latter generations when the "Heels of the Messiah" can be heard approaching, relate to their low souls from the level of Adam's "Heel".

However, at the same time, Kabbalah tends to explain an opposite process of progressively increasing Divine [[Ohr]] ("Light").  This light may be said to increasingly illuminate creation in each subsequent generation. In relation to Jewish scholarship, this [[dialectic]] process is connected to the mystical concept of the [[Tzadik]]. While the en masse community of souls of Israel in each generation are lower, the most supreme Tzadikim of the generations are unaffected by this limitation. In traditional view, Talmudic and Halachic study (''Nigleh''-"Revealed" aspects of Judaism) uncovers new interpretations of previously revealed Scriptural and Rabbinic texts. Consequently, this scholarship is affected by diminishing authority of latter generations to disagree with earlier codification. However, Kabbalistic (''Nistar''-"Concealed") scholarship advances with successive new descriptive articulations, through a progressive process of revelation of new doctrines by select supreme Tzadikim. In this picture, ''Nigleh'', affected by Yeridot HaDorot, involves the ascent of human intellect up to God. The new articulations of ''Nistar'' by rare Tzadikim involve the descent of new, successively higher Divine intellect into man's conceptual understanding. Where [[Halacha]] descends generationally through time, [[Kabbalah]] ascends generationally.

===A Hasidic point of view===
According to one Hasidic author, the three successive stages of mid-16th century [[Cordoveran Kabbalah]], latter-16th century [[Lurianic Kabbalah]], and 18th century [[Hasidic philosophy]] may be understood as three ascending levels of mystical perception and relationship to God in Kabbalah:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"There are three distinct stages in the historical revelation of [[Kabbalah]]. Each represents a conceptual approach to understanding Kabbalistic tradition. Each is identified with a particular historical figure. Rabbi [[Moshe Cordevero]], also known as the Ramak; Rabbi [[Isaac Luria]], popularly referred to as the holy Ari; and Rabbi Yisrael [[Baal Shem Tov]]. Each system of thought served to advance the evolution of Kabbalistic theory by providing new and more illuminating frameworks within which to organize the totality of Kabbalistic doctrine existing up to their time."&lt;ref name=Ginsburgh&gt;Ginsburgh, Yitzchak. [http://www.inner.org/stages/stages.htm The Development of Kabbalah in Three Stages] from www.inner.org&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In ascending order:&lt;ref name=Ginsburgh/&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Stage of Kabbalistic teaching: !! Date: !! Relative level: !! Divine characteristic:
|-
| [[Cordoveran Kabbalah]] || Mid 1500s || [[Four Worlds|Olamot]]-Worlds || [[Seder hishtalshelus|Hishtalshelut]]-Evolution
|-
| [[Lurianic Kabbalah]] || 1570s and after || [[Gilgul|Neshamot]]-Souls || [[Tohu and Tikun|Hitlavshut]]-Enclothement
|-
| [[Hasidic philosophy]] || 18th century and after || [[Atzmus|Elokut]]-Divinity || [[Divine providence (Judaism)#Particular divine providence in Hasidic philosophy|Hashra'ah]]-Omnipresence
|}
While Lurianic Kabbalah completed the full, [[Divine transcendence|transcendent]] structure of traditional Jewish metaphysics, this explanation places the Hasidic philosophical focus on [[Panentheism|Omnipresent]] Divine [[Divine immanence|immanence]] as the culmination of Kabbalistic thought. Where Kabbalah remained restricted to elite circles, Hasidic Divine Unity could likewise offer the first [[Deveikut|popularisation]] of mysticism to both elite scholars and unlearned common folk, offering to each new soulful directions.

==In contemporary Judaism==
The concept of ''Yeridat ha-dorot'' is particularly influential in [[Haredi Judaism]], which regards not only [[Halakha]] but even [[Minhag|customs]] of old as possessing divine inspiration and wisdom which later generations cannot match.  [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] has a somewhat ambivalent approach to the concept, believing that classical positions can sometimes be re-examined in light of modern circumstances but deferentially, and in accordance with classical rules of interpretation, while embracing modern science and secular learning.

The [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] movement is a pluralistic movement which accepts multiple positions about the degree of deference to tradition in contemporary thought and decision-making.  The Conservative movement has not expressly rejected the concept of yeridat ha-dorot, though Conservative authorities may sometimes view modern concepts of morality as superior to ancient concepts.

[[Reform Judaism]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], as modern liberal movements, reject the whole idea as incompatible with progress, liberalism, and modernity.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}
