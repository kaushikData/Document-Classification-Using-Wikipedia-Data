'''7 April Stadium''' ({{lang-ar|ملعب السابع من نيسان}}) is a [[association football|football]] [[stadium]] in the [[Syria]]n city of [[Aleppo]]. Opened in 1948, the venue is considered to be the oldest football stadium in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://jamahir.alwehda.gov.sy/__archives.asp?FileName=51352778820090321221740 |title=لمحة عن تاريخ الحركة الرياضية السورية ( حلب) |publisher=Jamahir.alwehda.gov.sy |date= |accessdate=2011-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426012410/http://jamahir.alwehda.gov.sy/__archives.asp?FileName=51352778820090321221740 |archivedate=2012-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium is home to the Syrian 2nd Division football club [[Al-Yarmouk SC Aleppo|Al-Yarmouk SC]].

==History==
The stadium was opened as the '''Aleppo Municipal Stadium''' in 1948 shortly-after the independence of Syria. In 1977, the stadium was enlarged and the [[seating capacity]] was increased to 12,000. In the same year, the stadium was renamed as '''7 April Stadium''' to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the foundation of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Ba'ath Party]]. During the beginning of the 1980s, the natural grass of the stadium was replaced with a plastic pitch. Later in 2001, an artificial turf was installed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tishreen.news.sy/tishreen/public/read/288794 Aleppo 7 April Stadium complex] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304033006/http://www.tishreen.news.sy/tishreen/public/read/288794 |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium has a nearby outdoor swimming pool and 2 outdoor tennis courts.

After the breakout of the [[Syrian Civil War]], the stadium remained intact during the [[Battle of Aleppo (2012–2016)|Battle of Aleppo between 2012 and 2016]].

The '''Beauty and The Beast Strongman Challenge''', also known as the '''Beauty and The Beast World Strongman Challenge''' was a short-lived annual strongman competition that was notable for the calibre of the entrants it attracted, as well as for the reputation it attained in a short amount of time.
==History==
The Beauty and The Beast Strongman Challenge was organised and promoted by strongman competitor [[Odd Haugen]] from 1998. It was initially promoted on the IFSA circuit as the North American open championship and from its inception took place in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]].  In its first year it was dominated by the USA, with the winner being [[Mark Philippi]], a successful athlete in other major tournaments such as [[World Muscle Power Classic]].

By 1999 the promoter and competitor, Odd Haugen had enticed many more international competitors including 1998 [[World's Strongest Man]] winner [[Magnus Samuelsson]] and 1997 World's Strongest Man winner [[Jouko Ahola]]. The previous year had been the final year of the original format [[World Strongman Challenge]], and so Haugen appended this prestigious events title to the end of Beauty and The Beast, thus conituing the tradition of one of strength athletics more enduring brands. Ahola tested some of the events for Haugen and gave his approval by stating ''"This is like a Finnish competition, heavy. I like that."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ironmind.com/ironmind/opencms/Articles/1999/Jun/Beauty_and_The_Beast.html Beauty &amp; The Beast..., June 3 1999, Ironmind]&lt;/ref&gt; With such pedigree the competition did draw on June 5 and 6, the top American competitors, as well as some of the biggest names on the international strongman circuit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ironmind.com/ironmind/opencms/Articles/1999/Apr/Beauty_and_The_Beast_Venue.html Ironmind April 28 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; It was called the "24 Hour Fitness" "Beauty &amp; the Beast" strongman competition and featured on [[ESPN]]'s "American Muscle Magazine". The [[International Federation of Strength Athletes|IFSA]] combined an IFSA Grand Prix and the IFSA American Championships into this event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ironmind.com/ironmind/opencms/Articles/1999/Jun/Beauty_and_The_Beast_TV_Schedule.html Ironmind June 30 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; The promoter, Odd Haugen, placed third in the IFSA American Championships section of the competition, although no USA athlete made the Grand Prix podium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ironmind.com/ironmind/opencms/Articles/1999/Jun/Beauty_and_the_Beast_2000.html Ironmind June 10 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

2000 again attracted international strongmen who again dominated the standings, with [[Janne Virtanen]] winning the event. These championships were also notable for introducing the [[Rolling Thunder World Championships]], seen as the event that determines the athlete with the greatest grip strength on the planet. In 2000 this was a kickoff event in a Honolulu sports bar the night before the strongman competition began. Those that entered included the four-time World's Strongest Man winner [[Magnus Ver Magnusson]].&lt;ref name="ironmind.com"&gt;[http://www.ironmind.com/ironmind/opencms/Articles/2009/Mar/ASC_Will_Feature_the_IronMindx_Grip_Challenge.html Tuesday, March 24, 2009 ASC Will Feature the IronMind Grip Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2001 edition of Beauty and the Beast was held on June 2 and was a one-day, eight-event contest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ironmind.com/ironmind/opencms/Articles/2000/Dec/Beauty_and_the_Beast_2001__.html Ironmind December 8 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; The podium saw three eventual winners of the [[World's Strongest Man]] title with [[Magnus Samuelsson]], [[Phil Pfister]] and [[Svend Karlsen]] finishing first, second and third respectively. By now Odd Haugen was credited with having done an incredible job of organizing one of the great contests on the strongman circuit making this a preview for the World's Strongest man.

The 2002 edition of the Beauty and Beast was scheduled for June 8, featuring defending World's Strongest Man winner Svend Karlsen, along with other top competitors including [[Janne Virtanen]], [[Hugo Girard]], [[Martin Muhr]], [[Wout Zijlstra]], [[Phil Pfister]], [[Karl Gillingham]], [[Brian Schoonveld]], [[Jesse Marunde]], and [[Grant Higa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ironmind.com/ironmind/opencms/Articles/2002/Apr/Beauty_and_the_Beast.html Beauty and the Beast, april 15 2002]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IFSA World Strongman Super Series was being heavily promoted in 2002 and Beauty and the Beast formed part of that. In the end, it became the Grand Prix Final held on January 17, 2003, finishing off the 2002 season. The very next day, a second Hawaii Grand Prix, again deemed Beauty and the Beast, was held as the opner for the 2003 IFSA World Strongman Super Series. Some deemed this a little farcical. This turned out to be the last holding of the event. Like the [[World Muscle Power Classic]], once the Beauty and the Beast became entangled with the Super Series, it lost its stand alone gravitas and quickly fell from favour. In the tentative schedule for the 2004/05 Super Series there was to have been a November Hawaii Grand Prix, but that season was foreshortened and this did not take place.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021123190434/http://www.super-series.com/ archive of official site of IFSA super series]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Beauty==
The Beauty and the Beast was so-called because there were in fact two events running. The strongman equated to the Beast. The beauty was initially a bikini fitness challenge. In 2001 this was replaced by the first ever Women's Strength &amp; Fitness Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.samson-power.com/Beauty_%26_the_Beast_2001.htm |title=Beauty_&amp;_the_Beast_2001 |access-date=2018-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302011300/http://samson-power.com/Beauty_%26_the_Beast_2001.htm |archive-date=2010-03-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rolling Thunder==
The association between Strongman contests and the [[Rolling Thunder (Strongman)|Rolling Thunder]] grip contests, as seen at [[Mohegan Sun Grand Prix]] events and [[Fortissimus]] began with Odd Haugen's Beauty and the Beast contests. The 2000 Rolling Thunder World Championships was a kickoff event in a Honolulu sports bar the night before the strongman competition began.&lt;ref name="ironmind.com"/&gt; On May 31, 2001 the second annual [[IronMind]] [[Rolling Thunder World Championships]] were held in conjunction with the Beauty &amp; the Beast strongman competition. Both 2000 and 2001 were won by [[Jan Bartl]]. No such championship was held in 2002, with the IFSA shifting the June 2002 date for the contest to January 2003. The world championships were not to be reintroduced until 2008.

'''Chesapeake Energy Arena''', originally known as the '''Ford Center''' from 2002 to 2010 and '''Oklahoma City Arena''' until 2011, is an [[arena]] located in [[Downtown Oklahoma City|Downtown]] [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]], [[United States]]. It opened in 2002 and since 2008 has served as the home venue of the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). Previously, Chesapeake Energy Arena was home to the [[Oklahoma City Blazers (1992–2009)|Oklahoma City Blazers]] of the [[Central Hockey League]] (CHL) from 2002 until the team folded in July 2009, and the [[Oklahoma City Yard Dawgz]] of [[AF2]] from 2004 to 2009 when the team moved to the [[Cox Convention Center]]. In addition to its use as a sports venue, Chesapeake Energy Arena hosts concerts, family and social events, conventions, ice shows, and civic events. The arena is owned by the city and operated by the [[SMG (property management)|SMG]] property management company and has 18,203 seats in the basketball configuration, 15,152 for hockey, and can seat up to 16,591 for concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chesapeake Energy Arena - Fast Facts - Capacities|first=|last=|url=http://www.chesapeakearena.com/about-the-arena/fast-facts|accessdate=April 13, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2005 to 2007 the arena also served as the [[Effect of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans Hornets|temporary home]] for the [[New Orleans Hornets]] of the NBA when the Hornets were forced to play games elsewhere following extensive damage to [[New Orleans Arena]] and the city of [[New Orleans]] from [[Hurricane Katrina]]. During the two seasons in Oklahoma City, the team was known as the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets. The response from fans while the Hornets played in Oklahoma City was an impetus to the city being discussed prior to 2008 as a future NBA team, either by [[Relocation of professional sports teams|relocation]] or [[Expansion team|expansion]].

==History==
It is owned by the City of Oklahoma City and opened on June 8, 2002, three years after construction began.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview|url=http://www.okfordcenter.com/arena/index.cfm?page=arenainformation|publisher=Ford Center|accessdate=August 27, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027062404/http://www.okfordcenter.com/arena/index.cfm?page=arenainformation|archivedate=October 27, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located adjacent to the Robinson Avenue exit of [[Interstate 40 in Oklahoma|I-40 Crosstown Expressway]] in downtown Oklahoma City. The original ''Ford Center'' name came from a [[naming rights]] deal with the Oklahoma Ford Dealers group which represented the marketing efforts of the state's Ford [[car dealership|dealership]]s, rather than the [[Ford Motor Company]] itself.&lt;ref name="newname"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ford Center Name to Change|first=John|last=Rohde|url=http://newsok.com/ford-center-name-to-change/article/3488958?custom_click=headlines_widget|newspaper=[[The Oklahoman]]|location=Oklahoma City|date=August 26, 2010|accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility was the premier component of the city's 1993 Capital Improvement Program, known as Metropolitan Area Projects (MAPS), which financed new and upgraded sports, entertainment, cultural, and convention facilities primarily in the downtown section with a temporary 1-cent sales tax assessed. Despite the "metropolitan" moniker of the improvement program, the tax was only assessed inside city limits.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;
 
Originally billed and marketed as a "state-of-the-art" facility, Oklahoma City Arena was actually constructed to minimum NBA and NHL specifications. The arena was built without luxury amenities because of local concerns on expenditures on an arena without a major-league tenant, with the ability to create "buildout" amenities and improvements to the arena if a professional sports team announced it would relocate to the city.

A plan for such buildout improvements began in 2007 in the wake of acquisition of the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] by an Oklahoma-City based ownership group in October 2006. Originally, city officials had hoped to include Oklahoma City Arena buildout improvements as part of a planned 2009 "MAPS 3" initiative. However, given the impending relocation decision of the Sonics ownership group in late 2007, the City Council of Oklahoma City placed a sales tax initiative on the city election ballot on March 4, 2008.&lt;ref name=knapp1&gt;{{cite web |title=Ford Center Arena Improvement Plan|first=Adam|last=Knapp|url=http://okc.about.com/od/politicalparties/a/fordcentervote.htm|accessdate=November 17, 2010|publisher=www.about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This initiative was passed by a 62% to 38% margin, and extended a prior one-cent sales tax for a period of 15 months in order to fund $121&amp;nbsp;million in budgeted improvements to the arena, as well as fund a separate practice facility for a relocated franchise.&lt;ref name=knapp1/&gt;

Subsequent to the ballot initiative, City officials and Sonics ownership announced a preliminary agreement to [[Seattle SuperSonics relocation to Oklahoma City|move the Sonics franchise]] to Oklahoma City and the Ford Center. The deal included a provision for $1.6&amp;nbsp;million in annual rents to the City for use of the Ford Center (including marketing rights of luxury seating areas for all NBA and most non-NBA events), and a $409,000 annual supplemental payment in exchange for a transfer of arena naming rights and associated revenue to the Sonics franchise.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg1&gt;{{cite news |title=NBA Owners Approve SuperSonics' Move to Oklahoma|first=Larry|last=DiTore|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=afMhL.CcD5gc&amp;refer=home|work=Bloomberg|date=April 18, 2008|accessdate=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The franchise move was approved by NBA ownership on April 18, 2008.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg1/&gt;

===Current name===
[[File:Chesapeake Energy Arena Logo.png|thumb|150px|left|Chesapeake Energy Arena logo, 2011–2017.]]

On August 26, 2010, the franchise, by then renamed the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]], announced that they had begun negotiating naming rights to its home arena with new potential partners. The facility was called the Ford Center and signage throughout the building remained intact during the negotiation period.&lt;ref name="newname"/&gt; The Thunder previously had discussions with the Oklahoma Ford Dealers; however, a new agreement could not be reached.&lt;ref name="newname"/&gt; As a result of the failed negotiation with the Oklahoma Ford Dealers, the Thunder decided to terminate the existing naming rights agreement, which was allowed under the original contract.&lt;ref name="newname"/&gt; On October 21, 2010, because of the ongoing negotiation for the naming rights for the arena, and because of its failed negotiation with the Oklahoma Ford Dealers, it was announced that the arena would be called the ''Oklahoma City Arena''. The new name was used temporarily until naming rights were settled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ford Center Is Now The Oklahoma City Arena|url=http://www.koco.com/sports/25464292/detail.html|work=KOCO|location=Oklahoma City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 22, 2011, a 12-year naming rights partnership was announced, the partnership between the Oklahoma City Thunder and [[Chesapeake Energy]] Corporation to rename the arena Chesapeake Energy Arena.&lt;ref name=CEA/&gt; The agreement between Chesapeake and the Thunder has an initial annual cost of $3 million with a 3% annual escalation.&lt;ref name=CEA/&gt; Included in the agreement Chesapeake had its branding throughout the building, prominent premium placement on the high-definition scoreboard, and on new state-of-the-art interior and exterior digital signs. Most of the new signs were in place before the start of the Thunder's [[2011–12 Oklahoma City Thunder season|2011–12 season]].&lt;ref name=CEA&gt;{{cite web |title=OKC Arena to be Renamed Chesapeake Energy Arena|url=http://www.nba.com/thunder/news/release_arena_110721.html|publisher=Oklahoma City Thunder|date=July 21, 2011|accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arena information==
The {{convert|581000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} facility seats up to 19,711 on three seating levels with a fourth added during concerts and features 3,380&amp;nbsp;club seats, seven party suites, and 49&amp;nbsp;private suites. It is located immediately across the street from the [[Cox Convention Center]], a marketing point often used by city officials (since Cox Center itself has a 15,000-seat arena). It also features The [[Jack Daniel's|OLD NO. 7]] Club, a full service restaurant and bar. Several other exclusive dining options are also available at The Pub, a {{convert|1,576|sqft|m2|sing=on}} "Irish Pub" themed bar, and at The Courtside Club, a {{convert|6,198|sqft|m2|sing=on}} restaurant and lounge area, as well as at the Victory Club, Sunset Carvery, and the new Terrace Lounges.

===Improvements===
On March 4, 2008, the citizens of Oklahoma City passed a $121.6&amp;nbsp;million initiative designed to renovate and expand the Chesapeake Energy Arena and to build a practice facility for the relocated [[Seattle SuperSonics]] team which is now known as the Oklahoma City Thunder. Financing consists of a temporary 15-month, 1-cent sales tax that will be paid by Oklahoma City residents and shoppers beginning January&amp;nbsp;1, 2009.

The city held the temporary tax initiative in March 2008 to facilitate the relocation of the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics or another relocation franchise. It is expected that the refurbishment will turn the Chesapeake Energy Arena into a top-tier NBA facility.

Some of the planned upgrades to the Chesapeake Energy Arena include upscale restaurants, clubs, additional suites (including so-called 'bunker suites'), office space, Kid's Zone, additional concessions, flooring upgrades, an integrated video and scoring system from [[Daktronics]], view lounges, and upgraded 'general use' locker rooms.&lt;ref name="Daktronics"&gt;{{cite web |title=New Scoreboard Designed with Fans in Mind|url=http://www.nba.com/thunder/news/fordcenterscoreboard_090601.html|publisher=Oklahoma City Thunder|date=June 1, 2009|accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NBA specific amenities include 'NBA ONLY' locker rooms and facilities, a practice court, media broadcast facilities, lighting, and sound, an NBA press room, an onsite NBA and team store, and ticket/staff rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Voters Approve $121.6 Million in Arena Upgrades to Lure NBA Team|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3277413|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=March 5, 2008|accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is anticipated that the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] team will lease the new office space.

Renovation work on the arena was delayed due to a sales tax receipt shortfall during the 2008–10 economic crisis; eventual tax receipts totaled $103.5&amp;nbsp;million rather than the projected $121&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MAPS 3 Citizens Advisory Board Presentation|url=http://www.okc.gov/agendapub/cache/2/xo5hufii3c1njdqg3sqfuw55/98900111172010122518933.PDF|publisher=City of Oklahoma City|date=August 24, 2010|accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The shortfall was accommodated by revising plans for certain features of the arena expansion project, including limiting the size of a new glass entryway, and eliminating a practice court planned for above the delivery entrance of the arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ford Center Practice Gym Eliminated from Renovations|first=John|last=Rohde|url=http://www.newsok.com/article/3483508 |newspaper=[[The Oklahoman]]|location=Oklahoma City|date=August 8, 2010|accessdate=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Major construction work on the arena expansion was also delayed from the summer of 2010 to the summer of 2011. Similar revisions were made to the plans for the Thunder's separate practice facility, for a total cost savings of approximately $14&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Oklahoma City Might Save as Much as $14 Million on Ford Center Renovations, Practice Facility|first=Mike|last=Baldwin|url=http://www.newsok.com/article/3474044|newspaper=[[The Oklahoman]]|location=Oklahoma City|date=July 7, 2010|accessdate=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Thunder's practice facility completion date was similarly pushed back to approximately March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thunder Practice Facility Set for March Completion|first=John|last=Rohde|url=http://newsok.com/thunder-practice-facility-set-for-march-completion/article/3515264|newspaper=[[The Oklahoman]]|location=Oklahoma City|date=November 16, 2010|accessdate=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
The Chesapeake Energy Arena hosts a number of games and events from [[Oklahoma City University]], the [[University of Oklahoma]], and [[Oklahoma State University]] along with those from local high schools and post-secondary organizations. It is also used for other events, including major concert tours, conventions, [[National Hockey League]] preseason and exhibition games, and notably [[professional wrestling]] shows.

===College Sports=== 
It hosted the [[2007 Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament]] for the first time in 2007 (with the [[2007 Big 12 Women's Basketball Tournament]] held across the street at [[Cox Convention Center]]). The venue has hosted the NCAA Men's Basketball First and Second Round on several occasions (including [[2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2010]] and [[2016 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2016]]) and is the permanent host of the All-College Basketball Classic. It hosted the 2009 [[Big 12 Conference]] Men's Basketball Tournament. In March 2014, the arena played host to the NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships.

===NBA===

====New Orleans Hornets====
{{Main article|Effect of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans Hornets}}
After the city of [[New Orleans]], and surrounding area was devastated by [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] reached a deal with the City of Oklahoma City which allowed the [[New Orleans Hornets]] franchise to temporarily move to the Chesapeake Energy Arena (then known as the Ford Center). The New Orleans Hornets leased the facility for the [[2005–06 NBA season|2005–06]] season and exercised the option with the city to extend for the [[2006–07 NBA season|2006–07]] season. The arena acquired a $200,000 renovation (primarily to lighting and sound) as part of the Hornets' lease. During this time, the team was known as the "New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets", giving Oklahoma City credit for hosting the 'home team'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hornets Nest Spruced Up Ford Center|first=John|last=Rhode|url=http://newsok.com/hornets-nest-spruced-upbrspan-classhl2ford-centerspan/article/2968225|newspaper=[[The Oklahoman]]|location=Oklahoma City|date=November 8, 2006|accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hornets played their last game in Oklahoma City on October 9, 2007, a preseason game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fans Thank Hornets for the Memories|first=Darnell|last=Mayberry|url=http://newsok.com/fans-thank-hornets-for-the-memories/article/3144547|newspaper=[[The Oklahoman]]|location=Oklahoma City|date=October 10, 2007|accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hosting of the Hornets arguably gave Oklahoma City the edge it needed to land on the radar of professional sports. Long being considered by many as too small to host a major-league team for a variety of reasons, support for the Hornets during their two-year stay caught the attention of the NBA and other sports leagues. Attendance for Hornets games at the Chesapeake Energy Arena averaged 18,716&amp;nbsp;fans in 2005–06 (36&amp;nbsp;games) and 17,951&amp;nbsp;fans (35&amp;nbsp;games) in 2006–07. David Stern was quoted as stating that "Oklahoma City was at the top of the relocation list of cities" and during the Hornets' last home game he all but assured local fans that "I look forward to the day that the NBA will return to Oklahoma City."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stern Looking Forward to NBA's Return to Oklahoma City|url=http://newsok.com/stern-looking-forward-to-nbas-return-to-oklahoma-city/article/3040332|newspaper=[[The Oklahoman]]|location=Oklahoma City|date=April 13, 2007|accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oklahoma City Thunder====
{{Main article|Seattle SuperSonics relocation to Oklahoma City}}
[[Image:OKC Thunder.JPG|thumb|Oklahoma City hosted and defeated Minnesota for their first win.]]
Oklahoma City billionaire investor [[Clay Bennett (businessman)|Clay Bennett]] of the [[Professional Basketball Club LLC]] purchased the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] and [[Seattle Storm]] franchises from [[Howard Schultz]] in 2006. The deal included a provision that gave [[Seattle]] officials one year to solve its arena situation or allow Bennett to seek relocation.

After an April 2008 league approval, it was announced on July 2, 2008 that the Sonics franchise would be relocating to Oklahoma City and would play at what was then the Ford Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Now That Seattle Lawsuit Has Been Settled, the NBA Is on Its Way Here to Stay|first1=Randy|last1=Ellis|first2=Chris|last2=Casteel|url=http://newsok.com/now-that-seattle-lawsuit-has-been-settled-the-nba-is-on-its-way-here-to-stay/article/3265341|newspaper=[[The Oklahoman]]|location=Oklahoma City|date=July 3, 2008|accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement retires the "SuperSonics" moniker, color, and logos, possibly to be used by a future NBA team in Seattle. On September&amp;nbsp;2, 2008, the team announced they would be called the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]].

The Thunder have been a playoff mainstay since arriving in Oklahoma.  Chesapeake Energy Arena hosted playoff games every year between 2010 and 2014, as well as 2016.  In 2012, the arena became host of the [[2012 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] for the only time to date, when the Thunder went up against the [[Miami Heat]] for the league championship.  The Thunder won Game 1 at Chesapeake Energy Arena in convincing fashion, but lost the last four games and the championship to the Heat.

===MMA &amp; Pro Wrestling===
The arena has hosted many WWE events such as [[WWE Raw|Raw]], [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]], and [[Unforgiven (2005)|Unforgiven 2005]]. Raw came to the Chesapeake Energy Arena on September 25, 2006 and March 1, 2010 with [[Cheech &amp; Chong]] appearing as the evening's [[List of WWE Raw guest stars|guest hosts]]. During the show on September 25, 2006, the opening of the show suffered a blackout, but lights were restored shortly after the night began.

On September&amp;nbsp;16, 2009, the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] returned to Oklahoma&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UFC Fight Night: Diaz vs. Guillard|url=http://www.ufc.com/event/UFC-Fight-Night-DIAZ-vs-GUILLARD|publisher=UFC|date=September 16, 2009|accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the first time since [[UFC 4]], which was at the [[Expo Square Pavilion]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] on December&amp;nbsp;16, 1994. A [[mixed martial arts]] event returned to the arena on January&amp;nbsp;12, 2013 with the [[Strikeforce: Champions]] event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmajunkie.com/news/2012/12/strikeforce-confirms-jan-12-event-is-final-showtime-broadcast|title=Strikeforce confirms Jan. 12 event is final Showtime broadcast|publisher=MMAJunkie.com|date=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other events===
The [[Professional Bull Riders|PBR]] has held an event at the Chesapeake Energy Arena annually since 2002. Its premier [[bull riding]] tour, the [[Built Ford Tough Series]] (known as the Bud Light Cup until 2002), has occupied the Chesapeake Energy Arena from 2002–2006 and again in 2009 and each year since. In 2007 and 2008, the PBR held their Challenger Tour finals here. Prior to 2002, the PBR's BFTS tour event was held at the Oklahoma State Fair Arena.

The 2015 North American Youth Congress (NAYC) of the United Pentecostal Church was held in the arena. The event sold out and the [[Cox Convention Center]] across the street used as overflow with video streamed from across the street.

[[File:Anselmus-van-Hulle-Hommes-illustres MG 0445.tif|thumb|Duke Augustus of Brunswick-Lüneburg, 1717 engraving after [[Anselm van Hulle]]]]
'''''Chess or the King's Game''''' ({{lang-de|Das Schach- oder Königsspiel}}) is a book on [[chess]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.chess.com/chessopedia/view/selenus-gustavus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kongernessamling.dk/en/dronningens-haandbibliotek/object/hertug-august-af-braunschweig-luneburgs-skakbog-16161617/&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in [[Leipzig]] in 1616 under the name of ''Gustavus Selenus'' ("Gustavus" being an anagram of "Augustus" and "Selenus" referring to the Greek moon goddess [[Selene]], linked to the Latin origin of the name "Lüneburg"), the [[pen name]] of Duke [[Augustus the Younger, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Augustus of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] (1579–1666).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gettyimages.com/photos/augustus-the-younger?excludenudity=true&amp;sort=mostpopular&amp;mediatype=photography&amp;phrase=augustus%20the%20younger&lt;/ref&gt; As a young prince, Augustus probably had learned of the game during his voyages to [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]] and purchased numerous chess books from the Augsburg merchant and art collector [[Philipp Hainhofer]]. The first textbook on chess in the German language, the work is mainly based on the ''[[Libro de la invencion liberal y arte del juego del axedrez]]'' written in 1561 by the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] priest [[Ruy López de Segura]], but also contains extensive philosophical and historical considerations (e.g. on the "chess village" of [[Ströbeck]]).

In addition to chess instruction, the book contained interesting illustrations of contemporary German chess pieces by [[Jacob van der Heyden]] et al. The usage for chessmen at the time tended to favor slender designs with nested floral crowns. The book was so successful that pieces of this pattern became known as the "[[Selenus chess set]]s”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eldrbarry.net/hatr/chess/convent.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, pieces became taller, thinner, and more elaborate. Their apparent floral nature lead some to name them "Garden chess sets" or "Tulip chess sets". Selenus pattern sets were commonly made in Germany and Central Europe until about 1914 when they were completely eclipsed by the more playable and stable [[Staunton chess set]] Pattern, which was introduced in 1849&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jaqueslondon.co.uk/indoor-games/chess-sets.html&lt;/ref&gt; by manufacturer [[Jaques of London]].

'''Children's Mercy Park''' is a [[soccer-specific stadium]] in [[Kansas City, Kansas]], United States, and is the home of [[Sporting Kansas City]]. The stadium is located near [[Kansas Speedway]] and it opened during the [[2011 Major League Soccer season|2011 season]] of [[Major League Soccer]] on June 9, 2011 with a match against the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/312888?cc=5901|title=Sporting KC settles for 0–0 draw with Fire|accessdate=June 10, 2011|date=June 9, 2011|publisher=ESPN.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026020837/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/312888?cc=5901|archivedate=October 26, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium has a seating capacity of 18,467 seats, which can expand to 25,000 for concerts.

In 2013, the stadium hosted the [[MLS All-Star Game]], the [[United States men's national soccer team]], and the [[MLS Cup]], three of the most prestigious matches in the United States, and is the only stadium to host all three in the same year.&lt;ref name="2013 Eastern Final Recap"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaplan|first=Jonathan|title=Recap: MLS Cup bound Sporting KC wins Eastern Conference Final with 2–1 victory over Houston|url=http://www.sportingkc.com/news/2013/11/recap-mls-cup-bound-sporting-kc-wins-eastern-conference-final-2-1-victory-over-housto|work=Sportingkc.com|publisher=Sporting Kansas City|accessdate=November 24, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127195307/http://www.sportingkc.com/news/2013/11/recap-mls-cup-bound-sporting-kc-wins-eastern-conference-final-2-1-victory-over-housto|archivedate=November 27, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Initial planning===
Originally, [[Sporting Club]], the team's ownership group, planned to move to southeast [[Kansas City, Missouri]] on land previously occupied by [[Bannister Mall]]. The redevelopment plan, called [[The Trails]], was passed on December 13, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collison |first1=Kevin |title=As expected, City Council gives final approval to Three Trails project |url=http://primebuzz.kcstar.com/?q=node/8940 |archive-date=June 28, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628164818/http://primebuzz.kcstar.com/?q=node%2F8940 |work=Kansas City Star |accessdate=October 10, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last package of economic incentives, a $30-million tax rebate, was passed on November 21, 2008.

The stadium's planned site had been demolished to prepare the site for infrastructure. It was intended to open in 2011 with a capacity of 18,500 seats. However, fallout from the 2008–2009 financial crisis placed the project on hiatus, and the stadium developer eventually sought to move the new project near the Village West retail center in [[Kansas City, Kansas]], near the [[Kansas Speedway]] and [[CommunityAmerica Ballpark]].&lt;ref name="KCK move"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kansascity.com/842/story/1433346.html|title=Wizards Stadium Project Kicked Over the State Line to Wyandotte County|first=Kevin|last=Collison|archive-date=September 12, 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090912055722/http://www.kansascity.com/842/story/1433346.html|newspaper=[[The Kansas City Star]]|date=September 8, 2009|accessdate=September 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developer of The Trails complex sought additional "enhancements" (i.e., borrowing authority) from Kansas City, Missouri, to finance the building of the soccer stadium and its associated amateur soccer complex. However, the city was unwilling to provide the desired financing, leading the developer to seek a new site across the state line.{{citation needed|date= June 2011}}

In September 2009, the developer asked [[Wyandotte County, Kansas|Wyandotte County]] and [[Kansas]] state officials for permission to use revenues from existing [[tax increment financing]] in the [[Village West]] area to help finance the soccer complex.&lt;ref name="legends_stadium"&gt;[http://www.kansascity.com/sports/wizards/story/1619544.html Kansas adjusts offer aimed at spurring Cerner, Wizards development near speedway]{{dead link|date=January 2017}}, ''The Kansas City Star'', December 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 17, Sporting KC president, Robb Heineman provided an update on the stadium situation published on team official website and blog,&lt;ref name="RHUpdate1"&gt;[http://kc.wizards.mlsnet.com/news/team_news.jsp?ymd=20091217&amp;content_id=7825974&amp;vkey=pr_kcw&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;team=t105 Heineman provides stadium update] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126133209/http://kc.wizards.mlsnet.com/news/team_news.jsp?ymd=20091217&amp;content_id=7825974&amp;vkey=pr_kcw&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;team=t105 |date=January 26, 2010 }}, KC Wizards Official Website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RHUpdate2"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091220023902/http://www.hillcrestroadblog.com/2009/12/rh-stadium-update.html Hillcrest Road – RH Stadium Update], OnGoal CEO/Wizards President Robb Heineman gives an update on the progress of the stadium project.&lt;/ref&gt; basically putting the Kansas City, Kansas location as final, pending the signature of the final agreements.

===Inaugural season===
The opening match took place on June 9, 2011, as Sporting played the [[Chicago Fire SC|Chicago Fire]] to a scoreless draw in front of an over capacity crowd of 19,925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kansascity.com/2011/06/09/2939575/sporting-kc-gets-0-0-draw-with.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621123219/http://www.kansascity.com/2011/06/09/2939575/sporting-kc-gets-0-0-draw-with.html |archivedate=June 21, 2012 |date=June 9, 2011 |title=Sporting KC plays to 0–0 draw with Fire|last1=Paylor|first1=Terez |work=The Kansas City Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first goal would come days later during the [[2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup]] when [[Dwayne De Rosario]] converted a penalty kick for [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]] against [[Panama national football team|Panama]]. Sporting's first goal came from [[C. J. Sapong]] in a 1–0 win over the [[San Jose Earthquakes]], the club's first victory in the stadium. Sporting would finish its first regular season in the stadium with a 9–2–6 record at home.  Average attendance was 17,810 for the year, or 96.4% of capacity.

===2012–present===
In the stadium's second season, Sporting KC averaged an attendance of 19,404, 105% of its capacity. That year, Sporting KC made it to the playoffs, but lost to the Houston Dynamo in the [[2012 MLS Cup Playoffs#Eastern conference|conference semifinals]]. However, Sporting KC did win the [[2012 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|US Open Cup]] by defeating the Seattle Sounders.

In 2013, Sporting KC once again raised their average attendance. Because of their 2012 US Open Cup win, they qualified for the [[2013-14 CONCACAF Champions League|CONCACAF Champions League]], and played games both in the MLS and in CONCACAF. Children's Mercy Park was also host to a World Cup qualifying match between the United States and Jamaica with an attendance of 18,467, where the United States shut out Jamaica 2–0, and the [[2013 MLS All-Star Game]] between [[A.S. Roma]] and the MLS All-Stars with an attendance of 21,175, where A.S. Roma beat the All-Stars 3–1. Sporting KC set an attendance record of 21,650 in the playoffs when they defeated the Houston Dynamo 2–1 to advance to the [[MLS Cup 2013|MLS Cup Finals]] against Real Salt Lake, Sporting won in penalty kicks, the second final in two years to be hosted at Children's Mercy Park.

Also in 2013, it was announced that the 2014 through 2018 [[NCAA Division II Football Championship]]s would be played at Children's Mercy Park, moving from [[Braly Municipal Stadium]] in Florence, Alabama.

The '''Chernomorets Stadium''' is a football [[stadium]] built in 2011 in [[Odesa]], [[Ukraine]]. The stadium has a capacity of 34,164 and is the  home of [[FC Chornomorets Odesa]]. The inaugural match, between FC Chornomorets Odesa and [[FC Karpaty Lviv]], was played on November 19, 2011, and ended with a 2–2 draw. The first goal was scored by [[Vitaliy Balashov]] in the 46th minute from penalty.

The stadium was constructed on the site of the old Soviet multi-use '''Central Stadium of the Black Sea Shipping Company''' (ChMP), which was demolished in 2009.

The venue was considered to be one of the stadiums of [[UEFA Euro 2012]] but failed to be nominated as such.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/55131/ "Surkis says Odesa mayor promised much, did little with respect to Euro 2012"], [[Kyiv Post]] (December 15, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Former stadium==
The former ChMP stadium was built on the same site in 1935, and it was originally named as '''Stanislav Kosior Stadium''' after the [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine|First Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communist Party]] of the [[Ukrainian SSR]], [[Stanislav Kosior]]. After Stanislav Kosior was repressed in the 1930s, the name was changed to '''Shevchenko Park Stadium'''. 

After [[World War II]], the stadium was passed to the ownership of the republican Ministry of Food and received name as the '''Central Stadium Kharchovyk'''. At the end of the 1950s, it was renamed as '''Avanhard Stadium''' after the Ukrainian Sport Society of industrial workers. In 1959, the stadium was renamed to the Central Stadium of the Black Sea Shipping Company or alternatively '''Central Stadium Chornomorets'''.

ChMP could hold 34,362 people. It hosted the [[Ukrainian Super Cup]] from 2004 until 2007. At the end of 2008 it was closed and, in 2009, it was demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Looking  back and future prospective  in Ukraine|url=http://www.ukrchicago.com/tem/Investments/Euro2012_web/ukraine-EURO2012.ppt|publisher=Consulate General of Ukraine in Chicago|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425122719/http://www.ukrchicago.com/tem/Investments/Euro2012_web/ukraine-EURO2012.ppt|archivedate=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clinton Arena''', also known as '''Edward W. Stanley Recreation Center''', is an indoor [[arena]] in [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York|Clinton, New York]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rinkatlas.com/rinks/186|title=Clinton Arena|accessdate=2018-04-16|publisher=RinkAtlas}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Originally built in 1948-49, the arena burned down on September 11, 1953.  It was then rebuilt in 1954.  It is built of [[concrete block]] and is two stories high. It consists of two blocks: the entrance block containing locker rooms and offices and the [[ice hockey rink]] block.  The roof uses a [[Truss bridge#Pennsylvania (Petit) truss|Pennsylvania Truss]] system for support.&lt;ref name="NysNrhpNom"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cris.parks.ny.gov/ |title=Cultural Resource Information System (CRIS) |publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]] |format=Searchable database |accessdate=2016-08-01 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web|url=https://cris.parks.ny.gov/Uploads/ViewDoc.aspx?mode=A&amp;id=25472&amp;q=false |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Edward W.

It hosted the [[Eastern Hockey League]]'s [[Clinton Comets]] from 1954 to 1973. In 1977, portion of Slap Shot was filmed in the arena. The arena seats 2,000 people and additional 300 standing room.  The rink is currently utilized by the [[Clinton High School (New York)|Clinton Central School]] hockey program and Clinton Youth Hockey and the Clinton Figure Skating Club.  In December 2006 Clinton Arena hosted the first annual "Hockey town" event between [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] and [[Utica College]].

The Clinton Arena is also home to the Clinton Figure Skating Club. It is one of the oldest figure skating clubs in the country and one of the largest on the East Coast. The club began as an informal group in 1948 following the construction of the Clinton Arena in Clinton, New York. Two years later, on August 14, 1950, Edward W. Stanley, one of the pioneers of the arena, initiated the first contact with the [[United States Figure Skating Association]].

It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="nps"/&gt;

On April 14, 2018, the Clinton Arena won the [[Kraft Hockeyville]] U.S. Grand Prize. The arena will receive $150,000 in rink upgrades and host an NHL pre-season game between the [[Buffalo Sabres]] and the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]].

A '''derby''' ({{IPAc-en|uk|ˈ|d|ɑːr|b|i}} {{respell|DAR|bee}}, {{IPAc-en|us|ˈ|d|ɜːr|b|i}} {{respell|DUR|bee}}) is a type of [[Horse-racing|horse race]] named after the [[Derby Stakes]] run at [[Epsom Downs Racecourse]] in England.{{sfn|Reeves|1997|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=taIfkYgVCWIC&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;pg=PA134#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.134]}} That was in turn named after [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby]], who inaugurated the race in 1780.{{sfn|Vesey|2003|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5YiIzxJT5o8C&amp;lpg=RA1-PT110&amp;pg=RA1-PT110#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 135]}} Perhaps the best-known example after the original is the [[Kentucky Derby]] in the [[United States]].{{sfn|Freeman|1997|loc=[https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=dujiiVP2KJIC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eL9tTPubFY6CvgPVkdz1Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 68]}}{{sfn|Schreifer|Sivell|1996|[https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=NhXkvhEQaCQC&amp;lpg=SL11-PA1&amp;pg=SL11-PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.

Traditionally, the term "derby" is used strictly to refer to races restricted to three-year-olds,{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} as the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing#United Kingdom|English]] and [[United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|U.S.]] [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]] races all are. The most notable exceptions to this rule are the [[Hong Kong Derby]] and [[Singapore Derby]], restricted to four-year-old Thoroughbreds, and the Canadian Pacing Derby, an annual [[harness racing|harness race]] for "aged pacers" ([[Standardbred horse|Standardbreds]]) four years old and up.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In [[Scandinavia]]n harness racing Derby is restricted to four-year-olds. Exception is [[finnhorse|the Finnhorse Derby]], which is restricted to five-year-olds.

==Stats==
The series began with both teams' formation in 1887. Prior to 1887, English and Latin had fielded a unified team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|
title=What Oneida club reveals about high school football history |work= Boston.com |publisher=Boston Globe Media |author= Bob Holmes |date= November 21, 2012 |quote=The first Thanksgiving game between Boston Latin and Boston English was 1887. Prior to that, the two schools played against other Boston area schools as a united team called High &amp; Latin School, or H.L.S. But by 1887, the two schools had grown enough to form their own teams, according to research done by Boston English trustee Peter Powilatis. |url= http://www.boston.com/sports/schools/football/2012/11/21/the-oneida-football-club-history-and-notes-thanksgiving/idCEARbEfAW29T8VvRq23K/story.html
|accessdate= January 9, 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the late 1960s, the rivalry was fairly even. Since that time, Latin has dominated the series, leading all time 81–36–13, and winning 51 of the last 54 contests (1964-2018).

Latin's dominance could be considered at its zenith in the 1970s when they held English to only 28 points for the entire decade.

Ten of the games ended in scoreless ties, a rare feat in modern [[American Football|Football]] at any level, although the last instance of this came in 1945. The implementation of [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] has dramatically reduced the number of tie games throughout the game of football.

Much of the series has been decided in blowout victories by one side or the other, with 63 of the 127 games being decided by shutouts and 38 of the contests ending in 20 point or more victories.

'''Estadio Pocitos''' was a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]]. This stadium was mainly used for football matches of the owner club [[Peñarol]] from 1921 to 1933. It was demolished later in the 1930s because Peñarol started to play in the [[Estadio Centenario]] as its home field, and additionally due to the increasing urbanisation of Montevideo. The first [[FIFA World Cup]] goal was scored in this stadium by the French player Laurent. The game was France against Mexico and was one of the two games that opened the World Cup, the other being held at the same time in Parque Central.

This stadium was one of the first soccer stadiums to include elliptical stands, taken from the model of the ancient Greek theatre. It has been said that the Estadio Centenario was planned to be a "giant version" of this stadium. This stadium is included in a German book of the 40 most influential stadiums in history.

==The 1930 FIFA World Cup==
During the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]], the stadium hosted two group matches:

Football Tennis game, 2014

'''Footballtennis''', also known as '''futnet''' (in Czech and Slovak ''[[:cs:Nohejbal|nohejbal]]'') is a [[sport]] originating in the 1920s in [[Czechoslovakia]]. It is a ball game that can be played indoors or outdoors in a court divided by a low net with two opposing teams (one, two or three players) who try to score a point hitting the ball with any part of their body except for the hands and making it bounce in the opponent's area in a way that makes it difficult or impossible for the other team to return it over the net.

==History==
In 1922 the members of the football club [[Slavia Prague]] started playing a game which they called football over the rope, because it was initially played over a horizontally suspended rope, which was later replaced by a net. Usually two or three players on each side could touch the ball three times (not two consecutive touches by the same player) with all parts of the body except for the arms and could let the ball bounce once between the touches, altogether three times before passing it on the other side.

In 1940 the first official rules were written. The first futnet cup was played in 1940 and between 1953-1961 first league called Trampská liga was played and it was banterous. In 1961, futnet was recognised as an official sport by [[Czechoslovak Sports Organisation]] (ČSTV) and the [[Prague Futnet Commission]] was established. In 1971 the "Český nohejbalový svaz" (Czech Futnet Association) was founded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://nohejbal.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=122&amp;Itemid=116
| title= History of futnet on the website of Czech Futnet Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1974 "Výbor nohejbalového zväzu SÚV ČSTV" (Slovak Futnet Association).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://nohejbal-sk.sk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=140:historia-nohejbalu-na-slovensku&amp;catid=35:historia&amp;Itemid=84
| title= History of Slovak futnet on the website of Slovak Futnet Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Official international competitions have been organised for decades. European championships have been held since 1991 and World championships since 1994.

== Rules ==

There are three futnet disciplines:
*Single: one player, two touches, one bounce in all categories, court dimensions 9 m × 12.8 m.
*Double: two players, three touches (but not two consecutive touches by the same player), one bounce allowed for men and two bounces for women and juniors, court dimensions 9 m × 12.8 m. However, per backyard rules, established in 2018 at Jeremy’s house, the length of the court for a two on two game shall be 1.5x the net width per side. If the net is 10 feet wide, the court shall be a total of 30 feet long.
*Triple: three players, three touches (but not two consecutive touches by the same player), one bounce allowed for men and two for women and juniors, court dimensions 9 m × 18 m.

In all the disciplines, a set finishes with 11th point with a two-point difference, maximum score is 15:14. To win a match, the team has to win 2 sets. The height of the net is 1.10 m. The players may not touch the net during the game, otherwise it is a point for the opponent. The futnet ball is similar to a football in size, but is glued, made of 32 panels, of synthetic (natural) leather and when properly inflated, should bounce more than half a meter.

== International associations ==

In 1987, the International Footballtennis Association (IFTA, later renamed to FIFTA, the Federation International de Footballtennis Association) was founded. In 2010,
Union Internationale de Futnet (UNIF) was founded by some former FIFTA members, later joined by other nations, to govern, regulate and promote the sport of futnet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.futnet.eu/about-futnet/history1987-2011/| title= International Development of Futnet between 1987 and 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, UNIF had 17 member countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://unifut.net/about.php | title= Members of Union Internationale de Futnet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010 European Futnet Association (EFTA) was founded in [[Marseille]], [[France]], to reactivate the sport in Europe where it had been stagnating under FIFTA. Current EFTA members include [[Switzerland]], [[France]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Romania]], [[Ireland]], Basque Country, [[Denmark]], [[England]], [[Poland]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.futnet.eu/efta//
| title= Members of European Futnet Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; EFTA is the continental association of UNIF in Europe.

== International name ==
While footballtennis is still a commonly used, the word futnet is being used more and more as the new international name to reflect the truly independent nature of this [[sport]] which has now almost 100 years of history and which has its own rules and regulations, governing structures and regular competitions.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

'''Gaper-Day''' is a mountain tradition that takes place in [[ski resort]]s across [[North America]].  It is the day when locals can dress in the most ridiculous outfits and pretend to be like their gaper counterparts. Their getup can range from no or very limited clothing (only shorts) to the most retro ski attire there is.  It is like the [[April Fools' Day]]  of the mountain. It normally occurs around April, when the snow starts melting and the temperatures are warmer.  

According to a local reporter at [[Jackson Hole Ski Resort]], Gaper-Day "is a Spring right [sic] of passage for those who live in mountain towns. It's a day that can provide large amounts of entertainment as locals do their best to poke a little fun at the tourists with which they have dealt throughout the season."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theholeconcierge.com/activities/gaper-day/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. National tennis championship]], precursor to today's US Open,  was played on Germantown Cricket's lawn tennis courts from 1921 to 1923.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web|title=Germantown Cricket Club History|url=http://germantowncricket.org/history.htm|publisher=Germantown Cricket Club|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germantown Cricket Club was located in Nicetown from 1877 until 1890 when it moved to its present Manheim Street location after the merging with the Young America Cricket Club in 1890. The Newhall brothers joined the Germantown cricket team at this time after being the backbone of the [[Young America Cricket Club]] for forty years. 

It continues as a private club with facilities for tennis, squash, swimming, and special events. The club's facilities are a designated [[National Historic Landmark]].

'''Jorge Luis Burruchaga''' ({{IPA-es|ˈxoɾxe βuruˈtʃaɣa}}; nicknamed ''Burru'', born 9 October 1962) is an [[Argentines|Argentine]] [[association football]] coach and former professional football player, born in [[Gualeguay, Entre Ríos|Gualeguay]], [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]]. He played both as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]] and [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]], scored the winning goal in the final of the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/26444580 |title=World Cup 2014: 100 great World Cup moments – 41 days to go |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 May 2014 |accessdate=24 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

Burruchaga started playing in [[Primera B Metropolitana#List of champions|1980]] for [[Arsenal de Sarandí]] in [[Primera B Metropolitana|Argentina's then second division]].

He was bought by [[Club Atlético Independiente|Independiente]] in [[1982 Argentine Primera División|1982]] and debuted in a victory against [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] on 12 February. He was part of the team that won the [[1983 Argentine Primera División#Metropolitano Championship)|Metropolitano 1983]], the [[Copa Libertadores 1984|Copa Libertadores]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfootball.net/schedule/copa-libertadores-1984-finale/0/ |title=Copa Libertadores 1984 |publisher=World Football |accessdate=24 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[1984 Intercontinental Cup|Intercontinental Cup]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/matchreport/newsid=512088.html |title=Toyota Cup 1984 |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=24 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306222947/http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/matchreport/newsid%3D512088.html |archivedate= 6 March 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was then transferred to French team [[FC Nantes|Nantes]], where he played for seven years. He also played one year for [[Valenciennes FC|Valenciennes]], where he was involved in a bribing scandal involving the French and European champions [[Olympique de Marseille]] 'buying' a 1–0 league win at Valenciennes on 20 May 1993. Marseille midfield player [[Jean-Jacques Eydelie]] and the club's general manager, [[Jean-Pierre Bernes]], had offered him money to throw the game, Burruchaga said he agreed but then changed his mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-scandal-leaves-a-stain-on-the-white-shirt-of-marseille-allegations-of-matchfixing-of-francfilled-envelopes-buried-in-gardens-are-threatening-to-dethrone-the-kings-of-french-football-nick-bidwell-reports-1484695.html | title = Football: Scandal leaves a stain on the white shirt of Marseille: Allegations of match-fixing, of franc-filled envelopes buried in gardens are threatening to dethrone the kings of French football.

He returned to [[Argentina]] for his last spell in [[Club Atlético Independiente|Independiente]], when he won a [[1995 Supercopa Libertadores|Supercopa Sudamericana]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/sacups/supcopa95full.html |title=Supercopa Libertadores 1995 – Full Details |publisher=RSSSF | date = 11 April 2001 | accessdate = 11 June 2015 | first = Josef | last = Bobrowsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[1995 Recopa Sudamericana|Recopa Sudamericana]] both in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=634523 | title = Un estigma que se reitera | language = es | website = Lá Nación | accessdate = 11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/sacups/recopa94.html |title=Recopa 1994 |publisher=RSSSF | date = 3 July 2003 | accessdate = 11 June 2015 | first = Erik | last = Garin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Australie Aborigene ancetre totemique kangourou.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Kangaroo totemic ancestor -  Australian [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] [[bark painting]], [[Arnhem Land]], c. 1915.]]
'''Kangaroo emblems and popular culture''' deals with how the [[kangaroo]] has become a recognisable symbol of [[Australia]], both within Australia itself, and internationally.  It also deals with the various uses which have been made of the image and name of the kangaroo.

== European first encounters==
The kangaroo was considered a unique oddity when [[James Cook|Captain Cook's]] [[HMS Endeavour|HMB ''Endeavour'']] arrived back in England in 1771 with a specimen on board. Over time it has come to symbolise Australia and Australian values.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Melissa and White, Richard (eds) (2010). Symbols of Australia, p. 28-29, UNSW Press, Sydney: National Museum of Australia Press, Canberra. {{ISBN|978-1-921410-50-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Banks]], the naturalist on the ''Endeavour'' voyage, commissioned [[George Stubbs]] to paint a portrait of the kangaroo specimen. When the official account of the voyage was published in 1773, it was illustrated with an engraving of Stubbs' kangaroo. From that time on, the kangaroo quickly came to symbolise the Australian continent, appearing in exhibitions, collections, art and printed works across Europe.&lt;ref name="nmaKangaroo"&gt;[http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/symbols_of_australia/kangaroo/ Symbols of Australia: Kangaroo, National Museum of Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kangaroo status ==
It took a long time for the kangaroo to achieve official recognition in Australia. Despite being a "declared noxious animal" because of its reputation for damaging crops and fences and competing with domestic animals for resources, the kangaroo finally achieved official recognition with its inclusion on [[Australian Coat of Arms|Australia's coat of arms]] in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Melissa and White, Richard (eds) (2010). Symbols of Australia, p. 24. UNSW Press, Sydney: National Museum of Australia Press, Canberra. {{ISBN|978-1-921410-50-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kangaroo is now popularly regarded as Australia’s unofficial animal emblem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/national_icons.html Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade: About Australia – National Icons] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019233119/http://dfat.gov.au/facts/national_icons.html |date=19 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[kangaroo]] has appeared on [[coin]]s and [[emblem]]s, been used in [[logo]]s, [[architecture|architectural decoration]], the [[decorative arts]] and public art, been a [[mascot]] and used in the naming of [[sport]]s teams. Kangaroos also appear in books, television series, films, cartoons, games and songs.

==Kangaroo emblems and logos==
[[File:Coat of Arms of Australia.svg|thumb|200px|right|Australian Coat-of-Arms]]

The kangaroo and [[emu]] are bearers on the [[Australian Coat of Arms]]. It has been claimed these animals were chosen to signify a country moving 'forward' because of a common belief that neither can move backward.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Melissa and White, Richard (eds) (2010). Symbols of Australia, p. 25. UNSW Press, Sydney: National Museum of Australia Press, Canberra. {{ISBN|978-1-921410-50-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two red kangaroos serve as bearers to the [[Coat of Arms of Western Australia]].

Australia's national airline, [[Qantas]], uses a bounding kangaroo for its logo. The kangaroo has always been part of the Qantas logo,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qantas.com.au/travel/airlines/history-kangaroo-symbol/global/en Qantas: The Kangaroo Symbol]&lt;/ref&gt; and the airline has previously been known informally as "The Flying Kangaroo".

[[Tourism Australia]] makes use of the kangaroo in its logo to "help ensure instant recognition for Australia around the world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tourism.australia.com/en-au/brand-australia_5536.aspx Tourism Australia: Using the Brandmark]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian made logo|Australian Grown]] logo uses a golden kangaroo in a green triangle to show that a product is made or grown in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australianmade.com.au/logo/ Australian Made | Australian Grown]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal Australian Air Force]] [[roundel]] features a bounding red kangaroo.

Warships of the [[Royal Australian Navy]] have red kangaroo symbols (based on the kangaroo on the reverse of the [[Penny (Australian)|Australian penny]]) fixed to either side of their superstructure or funnel. This originated during the Korean War: as the destroyer {{HMAS|Anzac|D59|6}} was repeatedly mistaken for a British warship, her executive officer had a brass 'weathervane' in the shape of a kangaroo made and mounted to the ship's mainmast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cassells |first=Vic |title=The Destroyers: their battles and their badges |year=2000 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=East Roseville, NSW |isbn=0-7318-0893-2 |oclc=46829686 |pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kangaroo is part of the official emblem of the [[Royal Australian Regiment]] with a kangaroo in between two [[Lee–Enfield]] bolt-action rifles.

The [[Coat of arms of Victoria (Australia)|Victorian Coat of Arms]] includes the upper portion of a kangaroo holding an [[Imperial State Crown|Imperial Crown]] in its paws.

The red kangaroo is the animal emblem of the [[Northern Territory]].

The kangaroo is the official emblem of [[Northern Territory Police]].

British clothing and headwear company [[Kangol]], known for its berets, features a kangaroo in its logo.

==Kangaroos and coins==
The kangaroo has been featured on pre-decimal coins, and on [[decimal]] coins.

The Kangaroo was featured on the Australian pre-decimal [[Coins of the Australian pound|penny]] coin.

The Kangaroo was also featured on the Australian pre-decimal [[Coins of the Australian pound|half-penny]] coin.

Five Kangaroos are featured on the Australian [[Coins of the Australian dollar|one dollar coin]]

==Kangaroo mascots in Australia==
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Boxingkangaroo.svg|200px|thumb|Boxing Kangaroo flag, design used in 1983.]] --&gt;

[[File:Opening ceremony (8075978683).jpg|thumb|''Matilda'', at the [[1982 Commonwealth Games]]]]

The ''[[Boxing kangaroo]]'' – mascot for the [[Australia II]] team in the 1983 [[America's Cup]].  This rendition of the kangaroo has become a sporting icon, known informally as the green and gold "Sporting Kangaroo", and is highly popular with cricket crowds and international sporting events which feature Australian participation.

''Matilda'', the [[mascot]] at the [[1982 Commonwealth Games]] held in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]], was represented by both a  [https://web.archive.org/web/20070208150816/http://www.commonwealthgames.org.au/GamesInfo/PastGames/1982/Mascot.htm cartoon kangaroo]  and a 13-metre high (42 feet 8&amp;nbsp;inches) mechanical kangaroo (which [[wink]]ed at the spectators during the opening and closing ceremonies).  The 'medal', which was worn by both the cartoon and mechanical versions of ''Matilda'', features the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070208150729/http://www.commonwealthgames.org.au/GamesInfo/PastGames/1982/Logo.htm 1982 Commonwealth Games logo] — a [[Wiktionary:stylized|stylised]] representation of a kangaroo bounding (in "flight") – similar to the [[Wiktionary:pose|pose]] of the kangaroo featured on the pre-decimal half-penny coin.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070208150816/http://www.commonwealthgames.org.au/GamesInfo/PastGames/1982/Mascot.htm 1982 Commonwealth Games Mascot]," ''[[Australian Commonwealth Games Association]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War I|First World War]], pet kangaroos and toy kangaroos were a popular choice of mascot for Australian servicemen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cas.awm.gov.au/item/RELAWM07953 Kangaroo soft toy mascot: Red Cross Hut, Rouelles], [[Australian War Memorial]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/australian-war-memorial/3527160248/ Photograph: Australian nurse with a kangaroo mascot, Harefield, England], [[Australian War Memorial]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carlton club.jpg|thumb|200px|Kangaroo gargoyles atop The Carlton Club (built 1889) in [[Carlton, Victoria]].]]

==Architectural references==
The first uses of Kangaroo ornaments as architectural expression appeared during the Victorian era.  This was at first limited to the use of the coat of arms on buildings; however, kangaroos soon became used as decorative motifs on their own in some commercial buildings, particularly in [[Melbourne]].

It was the [[Federation architecture]], however, which brought native ornamentation into the mainstream, so that kangaroos began to be mass-produced as ornamentation on domestic houses in the large cities, as part of an Australiana movement and effort to create a uniquely Australian style.  Examples of this decoration include the ornamental [[terracotta]] tile capping on residential roofs.  Reproduction products using Kangaroos are still used today.

==Public art and sculpture==
[[File:Perth Council House.jpg|thumb|Perth Council house kangaroo sculptures]]

==Decorative arts and design==
An early depiction of a kangaroo on an item of [[Decorative arts|decorative art]] is the Macintosh &amp; Degraves [[Token coin|Token]] Shilling 1823.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museumvictoria.com.au/collections/items/63320/token-1-shilling-macintosh-degraves-sawmills-hobart-tasmania-australia-1823 Macintosh &amp; Degraves Token Shilling 1823], [[Museum Victoria]]&lt;/ref&gt; Another early example is the Garret salver. This item of [[Tasmania]]n colonial silver incorporates a kangaroo, an emu and wattle branches in its design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.tmag.tas.gov.au/decorativeart/objects/metalware/P708/index.html Garrett salver], [[Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The kangaroo has continued to be incorporated into decorative designs by craftspeople and designers in Australia and elsewhere in the world. The Terence Lane kangaroo collection at the [[National Museum of Australia]] consists of more than 150 objects and ephemera in a wide range of styles produced over a period of 150 years. The collection ranges from a one-metre-high [[Royal Doulton|Doulton]] ceramic kangaroo umbrella stand to small items of jewellery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/highlights/terence-lane-kangaroo-collection Terence Lane kangaroo collection], [[National Museum of Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''L.R. Hill Sports Complex''' is an athletic building on the campus of [[Old Dominion University]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. Construction started in August 2007 and the building opened on September 13, 2008. Built by S.B. Ballard, who has constructed many buildings at ODU including the [[Ted Constant Center]] and the University Village Apartments.&lt;ref&gt;http://hamptonroads.com/2009/07/little-extra-story A little extra to the story &lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The L.R. Hill Sports Complex is a {{convert|48000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building that houses Old Dominion Football, Women's Lacrosse, and Women's Field Hockey. The facility cost $17 Million to build.&lt;ref&gt; http://hamptonroads.com/node/305111. Ground broken on ODU's $17 million Powhatan Sports Center &lt;/ref&gt; It is located along Powhatan Avenue near the Lambert's Point Golf Club and Golf Course. Included in the Powhatan Sports Complex is a {{convert|6000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} area for strength &amp; conditioning, players lounges, locker rooms, high definition screens, and a {{convert|3000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} athletic training area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.odusports.com/ot/oldd-08-powhatan-sports-complex.html Powhatan Sports Complex &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Motivation for the complex began with the re-addition of [[American football|football]] to Old Dominion University. The school used to have a team from 1930–41 and in 2005 the Board of Visitors voted unanimously in favor of adding football.

To get land for the complex, just less than 3 acres, ODU gave the city of Norfolk 3 acres of land near Lambert's Point across Hampton Boulevard.&lt;ref&gt;https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/dailypress/access/1046203731.html?dids=1046203731:1046203731&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun+01%2C+2006&amp;author=MICHAEL+C.+WRIGHT+mwright2@dailypress.com+%7C+247-4759&amp;pub=Daily+Press&amp;desc=ODU+IS+READY+FOR+FOOTBALL%2C+AGAIN&amp;pqatl=google ODU Ready for Football, Again &lt;/ref&gt; 

For [[lacrosse]] and [[field hockey]], a new field was built that shares the both. Stands face east, with the press box on the opposite side. Their offices are located on the 1st and 2nd floors of the complex. All three occupants share the athletic and strength &amp; conditioning areas, while individually having their own offices and locker rooms.

==Football==
The football offices are located on the 2nd floor of the building. Coaches offices and meeting rooms occupy the upstairs. The players' locker rooms, lounge and equipment room are located on the 1st floor near the practice fields. A 100-yard football field and a 60-yard football field was built adjacent to the lacrosse and field hockey stadium. All outside areas are equipped with lighting for night practice and/or games.

The grass used for the football practice fields are GameDay Grass 3D and were supplied by GeneralSports Venue (GSV). GameDay Grass 3D is a form of astroturf. GameDay is also used by the [[Buffalo Bills]], [[Toronto Blue Jays]], and [[Tampa Bay Rays]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astroturfusa.com/GameDay-Grass.aspx Astroturf Gameday Grass &lt;/ref&gt; 

==NCAA Field Hockey Final Four==
The Powhatan Sports Complex has received national attention and has hosted the 2012, 2013 and 2016 NCAA Field Hockey Final Four. This will be the fourth time the event will on the campus of Old Dominion University, with previous events being held at Foreman Field in 1985, 1986, and 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://hamptonroads.com/2010/06/odu-host-field-hockey-final-four-2012-and-2013 ODU to host field hockey Final Four in 2012 and 2013 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Association football]] clubs around the world sometimes retire [[squad number]]s to recognise players' loyal service, sometimes as a memorial after their death.

==Background==
This practice, long established in the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major North American sports]], is a recent development in football since squad numbers for specific players were not widely used until the 1990s. Before then, it was typical for players in the starting lineup to be issued numbers 1 to 11 by formation/position on a match-by-match basis, and substitutes to be numbered from 12 upwards, meaning a player might wear different numbers during the season if they were to play in different positions for tactical reasons, or simply not be a regular in the starting lineup.

Retiring a player's number usually occurs after the player has left the team or retired. It honours a player who has meant so much to his club that they retire the shirt number that the player wore during their time there, meaning no other player is permitted to use that number in the future. In some cases, such as those of [[Jason Mayélé]], [[Vittorio Mero]], [[Marc-Vivien Foé]], [[Miklós Fehér]], [[Ray Jones (footballer born 1988)|Ray Jones]], [[Dylan Tombides]], [[François Sterchele]], [[David di Tommaso]], [[Antonio Puerta]], [[Besian Idrizaj]], [[Piermario Morosini]] and [[Davide Astori]], numbers have been retired to posthumously honour a player who died while still active. Also, Norwegian club [[Fredrikstad F.K.|Fredrikstad]]  retired [[Dagfinn Enerly]]'s number following an on-pitch accident that left him [[paraplegia|paralysed]]. In Britain, only [[Bobby Moore]]'s and [[Jack Lester]]'s shirt numbers have been retired due to great service to the club as opposed to a tragic incident. Although it has not been officially retired, [[Gianfranco Zola|Gianfranco Zola's]] No. 25 shirt has not been reissued by Chelsea since he left the club in 2003.

The [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] and [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] national teams have been prevented from retiring the numbers of [[Diego Maradona]] (10), [[Christian Benítez]] (11)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/03/06/soccer-friendlies-latam-idUKL3N0M33JT20140306|title=Soccer-Ecuador to reinstate Benitez's number 11 for World Cup|date=6 March 2014|publisher=reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marc-Vivien Foé]] (17), respectively, by [[FIFA]] rules dealing with squad numbers for Finals tournaments; in other competitions or [[Friendly match|friendlies]], national associations may assign numbers according to criteria of their choosing. Similarly, several clubs have been required to reissue retired numbers for continental club competitions due to squad numbering rules of continental confederations. For example, [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] and [[CONMEBOL]] have such rules in their club competitions, but [[CONCACAF]] does not.

Some South American teams (such as [[Universitario de Deportes]] or [[Flamengo]], and even Mexican teams invited for the occasions) have occasionally had to re-issue their retired numbers for special cases due to CONMEBOL rules, which state that shirts must be numbered 1–25 in continental club competitions (such as [[Copa Libertadores]] and [[Copa Sudamericana]], among others).

Number 17, derived from the day of his death, was selected to be retired. The number would later also be dedicated to the club's fans, thus they have not retired squad number 12 like most Japanese League teams.

==Dedication to fans==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015}}
Some clubs dedicate a number to their fans, and do not issue it to any player. The most common number for this practice is 12, from descriptions of the fans as "[[12th man (football)|the twelfth man]]".

In Japanese footballing tradition, almost all the professional teams retired the number 12 for their supporters. The only two teams not to retire 12 are [[Urawa Red Diamonds]] and [[Sagan Tosu]] (Sagan retired 17 for a similar reason).

'''Parker's Piece''' is a {{convert|25|acre|m2|adj=on}} flat and roughly square green [[commons|common]] located near the centre of [[Cambridge]], [[England]] and is now regarded as the birthplace of the rules of Association Football.  The two main walking and cycling paths across it run diagonally, and the single lamp-post at the junction is colloquially known as [[Reality Checkpoint]]. The area is bounded by [[Park Terrace, Cambridge|Park Terrace]], [[Parkside, Cambridge|Parkside]], [[Gonville Place]], and [[Regent Terrace, Cambridge|Regent Terrace]]. The Cambridge University Football Club Laws were first used on Parker's Piece and adopted by the Football Association in 1863. "They embrace the true principles of the game, with the greatest simplicity" (E. C. Morley, F.A. Hon. Sec. 1863). 'The Cambridge Rules appear to be the most desirable for the Association to adopt' (C. W. Alcock 1863, FA committee member and founder of the FA Cup). A statue was due to be erected in October 2013 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Football Association and their adoption of the Cambridge Rules, but has been delayed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-27702522 BBC News - Cambridge football statue plans resurrected]&lt;/ref&gt;

The grass is well manicured and it is known today chiefly as a spot for picnics and games of [[football (soccer)|football]] and [[cricket]], and serves as the games field for nearby [[Parkside Community College]].  Fairs tend to be held on the rougher ground of [[Midsummer Common]].

[[Image:Parker's Piece Coronation Feast.jpg|thumb|right|The coronation feast of 1838.]]
In 1838, a feast for 15,000 guests was held on Parker's Piece to celebrate the coronation of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].

==History==
Before 1613, the site of Parker's Piece was owned by [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]]. In that year, the college exchanged with the town of Cambridge the land, at that time located well outside the town, and the majority of Garret Hostel Green, an island on the [[River Cam]], and the site of the current [[Wren Library, Cambridge|Wren Library of Trinity College]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}. It was subsequently named after a college cook, Edward Parker, who obtained the rights to farm on it.

As a [[cricket ground]], Parker's Piece was used for [[first-class cricket|first-class]] matches from 1817 to 1864.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/375_f.html List of first-class matches on Parker's Piece]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, it was one of the principal sports grounds used by students at the [[University of Cambridge]] and the site of numerous [[Varsity Match]]es against [[Oxford University|Oxford]].

==Parker's Piece and football==

In the 19th century, football was also commonly played on this ground, as is described in the following quotation from [[George Corrie (priest)|George Corrie]], Master of [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]] (1838):  "In walking with Willis we passed by Parker's Piece and there saw some forty Gownsmen playing at football. The novelty and liveliness of the scene were amusing!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuafc.org/history.php C.U.A.F.C. History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027053608/http://www.cuafc.org/history.php |date=27 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rules of football===
{{Main|Cambridge rules}}

Parker's Piece has a special place in the history of modern [[football|football games]], as it was here that the [[Cambridge Rules]] of 1848 were first put into practice.  They were very influential in the creation of the modern rules of [[football (soccer)|Association Football]], drawn up in [[London]] by [[The Football Association]] in 1863.  A plaque has been mounted at Parker's Piece bearing the following inscription:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cambridgeshire/content/articles/2006/06/09/cambridge_football_rules_parkers_piece_feature.shtml BBC Cambridgeshire - Football - Cambridge Rules]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|Here on Parker's Piece, in the 1800s, students established a common set of simple football rules emphasising skill above force, which forbade catching the ball and 'hacking'. These 'Cambridge Rules' became the defining influence on the 1863 Football Association rules.}}

===Modern passing tactics===
{{main|Combination game}}

The move by the [[Cambridge University AFC]] away from Parker's Piece in 1882 coincided with the side's significant role in the development of the modern passing, [[combination game]]. In a detailed investigation into the evolution of football tactics based upon contemporary accounts, Adrian Harvey refers to the teams responsible for the ''early'' development of the passing game (including Sheffield, The Royal Engineers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Adrian|last=Harvey|title=Football, the First Hundred Years|year=2005|pages=273, ref 34&amp;ndash;119|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-35019-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxoZ0S-GC7MC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Queens Park) but comes to the following conclusion about the finished, modern team product:  "Curiously, the side that was generally credited with transforming the tactics of association football and almost single-handedly inventing the modern game was not a professional team but the Cambridge University XI of 1882.  Contemporaries described Cambridge as being the first "combination" team in which each player was allotted an area of the field and played as part of a team in a game that was based upon passing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Brendan|last=Murphy|title=From Sheffield with Love|year=2007|publisher=Sports Book Limited|isbn=978-1-899807-56-7|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a discussion by [[CW Alcock]] on the history of a "definite scheme of attack" and  "elaborate combination" in football playing style, he states in 1891:  "The perfection of the system which is in vogue at the present time however is in a very great measure the creation of the last few years.  The Cambridge University eleven of 1882 were the first to illustrate the full possibilities of a systematic combination giving full scope to the defence as well as the attack"&lt;ref&gt;Association Football, chapter by CW Alcock, The English Illustrated Magazine 1891, page 287&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed sculpture===
In May 2013, the [[Cambridge City Council]] proposed that a {{convert|2|m|ft|adj=on|abbr=off}} statue by artist Gordon Young, in the form of a [[Subbuteo]] referee on top of a circular plinth engraved with [[Cambridge Rules]] be installed on Parker's Piece to mark the 150th anniversary of the publication of the 1863 Football Association rules and Parker's Piece's association with it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-22446716 BBC News - Cambridge 'Subbuteo' sculpture to mark 'home' of football's rules]&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was rejected in June 2013 before public consultation due to negative feedback and concerns with [[Hasbro]], which markets Subbuteo, and the possibility of significantly exceeding its original £88,000 budget.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-22813155 BBC News - Cambridge Subbuteo sculpture for Parker's Piece rejected]&lt;/ref&gt;

For a four-week trial beginning January 2013, lighting bollards were temporarily installed along the northwest path, between [[Reality Checkpoint]] and [[Melbourne Place]], as residents and students had claimed that Parker's Piece was unsafe after dark. Several attacks had previously occurred in the park. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/News/Lighting-trialled-on-Parkers-Piece-amid-safety-fears-28012013.htm Cambridge News - Lighting trialled on Parker's Piece amid safety fears] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130140047/http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/News/Lighting-trialled-on-Parkers-Piece-amid-safety-fears-28012013.htm |date=30 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parkside==
Parkside is the street on the north-east side of the park. Since 2006&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Cambridge/Anger-as-coach-stop-is-put-outside-school.htm&lt;/ref&gt; it has been the terminus for long distance coach services (such as the [[Stagecoach bus route X5]] to [[Oxford]]), visitor coaches and a stopping point for local bus services. The street is also home to the city's police and fire stations, as well as giving access to [[Parkside Community College]].

'''Sames Auto Arena''' (formerly known as the '''Laredo Entertainment Center''' and '''Laredo Energy Arena''') is a multi-purpose [[arena]], in [[Laredo, Texas]]. The Sames Auto Arena can seat up to 8,065 fans at an ice hockey game, 8,067, at an arena football game, 10,000, at a basketball game, and 11,360, at concerts. It is located to Bob Bullock Loop 20, on the northeastern side of Laredo. Within the Sames Auto Arena complex, there are several hotels within a walking distance. The [[Laredo International Airport]] is also nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://learena.com/plan/ |publisher=Laredo Energy Arena |title=Technical Information |accessdate=April 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==
In 2010, the previously-named Laredo Entertainment Center was renamed the Laredo Energy Arena after Laredo Energy purchased the venue's naming rights. Eight years later, Sames Auto Group purchased the naming rights to the arena and the venue is now known as the Sames Auto Arena.
 
The City of Laredo funded the $36.5 million project through a one-quarter percent sales tax increase that was approved by Laredo voters on August 12, 2000, with the facility's groundbreaking taking place in June 2001. The facility opened in October 2002. 
 
The facility's management company, SMG, oversees all aspects of the arena including operations, concessions, scheduling, ticketing, and marketing.
 
With 32,000 square feet of continuous open floor space, the Sames Auto Arena has the largest indoor convention space in South Texas. The 178,000 square foot facility has a [[seating capacity]] of 10,000 with 14 luxury suites, six meeting rooms and a private club. 

The Sames Auto Arena sits on 25 acres at Jacaman Road and Loop 20 – property that Arena Ventures donated to the City of Laredo. Arena Ventures owns 35 additional acres around the site that is currently being developed with hotels and office parks, specialized retail stores and restaurants, and a $1.5 millionwater feature with fountains, a boardwalk and quarter-mile jogging track.

'''Soloflex''' refers to both the Soloflex exercise machine and to Soloflex, Inc., the company that created and produces it.  Instead of pulleys, the Soloflex used an elastomer Weightstrap made of heavy-duty rubber to create variable resistance. The company started out as Bucksteel Mfg in [[Roswell, New Mexico]], in a small plant on the old [[Army Air Force]] base south of town. It is now based in [[Hillsboro, Oregon]].

==History==
Soloflex, Inc. was established in 1978 by Jerry Wilson. The idea behind the weight straps came from Jerry's days flying small airplanes.  The resistance on the plane's controls came from the [[bungee cord]].  Jerry used this idea to create the Weightstraps that provide enough resistance to equal large amounts of free weight.

In 1980, the company relocated to [[Hillsboro, Oregon]].  After the move to [[Oregon]],  Bucksteel changed its name to Soloflex. The company then used model Scott Madsen in an infomercial to promote their product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/clark-county/index.ssf/2010/10/famed_soloflex_model_sentenced_to_prison_for_embezzling_from_uncles_vancouver_business.html#incart_mce|title=Famed Soloflex model sentenced to prison for embezzling from uncle's Vancouver business|last=Denson|first=Bryan|date=October 4, 2010|work=[[The Oregonian]]|accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1984 the company's sales had grown to $18 million annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCallum|first=Jack|title=Everybody's Doin' It|journal=Sports Illustrated|date=December 3, 1984|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1122903/2/index.htm|accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, several additions to the machine were made such as butterfly attachments and leg extensions. The newest product addition is the Soloflex Whole Body Vibration (WBV) Platform.  Vibrating while you are lifting weights is thought to magnify the conditioning effects to help promote faster muscle growth.

==Products==
Soloflex home gym machines use an elastic element to provide resistance. The product also comes with an instructional DVD.

Soloflex's WBV Platform recently made news in July 2007 for a Consumer Reports review that demonstrated it had been using claims from research that may not apply to their machine. "At press time, even the research on its Web site involved competitors’ products and lab machines. Some research suggests that certain vibrating machines might help improve strength and balance, but our experts said it’s unclear whether the Soloflex would. Its vibration levels differ from those studied."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/health-fitness/exercise-wellness/soloflex-whole-body-vibration-platform-7-07/overview/0707_soloflex_ov_1.htm Consumer Reports Article]&lt;/ref&gt;

Soloflex disputed the article's comments on burning calories, but did not comment on other claims.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

A '''sports bra''' is a [[bra]] that provides support to female [[breast]]s during physical exercise. Sturdier than typical bras, they minimize breast movement, alleviate discomfort, and reduce potential damage to chest [[ligament]]s. Many women wear sports bras to reduce pain, and physical discomfort caused by breast movement during exercise. Some sports bras are designed to be worn as outerwear during exercise such as jogging.

==History==
{{Main|History of brassieres}}
The first commercially available sports bra was the "Free Swing Tennis Bra" introduced by Glamorise Foundations, Inc. in 1975.  The first general exercise bra, initially called a "jockbra", was invented in 1977 by [[Lisa Lindahl]] and theater costume designer Polly Smith with the help of Smith's assistant,  [[Hinda Miller|Hinda Schreiber]]. Lindahl's sister, Victoria Woodrow, complained about her bad experience exercising in ordinary bras, having experienced runaway straps, chafing and sore breasts. During the course of Lindahl and Smith's exploration for a better alternative, Lindahl's husband suggested that what they needed was a [[jockstrap]] for women's breasts.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts |first1=Jacob |title=Women's work |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=1 |pages=6–11 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/womens-work|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the costume shop of Royall Tyler Theatre at the [[University of Vermont]], Lindahl and Smith actually sewed two jockstraps together and nicknamed it a "jockbra". It was later renamed a "jogbra".&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ladiesonlysports.com/somehistory.html|title=A History of the Sports Bra|date=March–April 2007 |work=Women's Adventure Magazine |accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of their original Jogbras is bronzed and on display near the costume shop of the theatre. Two others are housed by the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]] and another by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|New York Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uvm.edu/~uvmpr/?Page=article.php&amp;id=1598 |title=History-Changing Garment Born in Theater Costume Shop |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516195454/http://www.uvm.edu/~uvmpr/?Page=article.php&amp;id=1598 |archivedate=2014-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 [[Playtex]] purchased Jogbra from Lindahl and her partners. This was followed by research by [[Christine Haycock]], associate professor of surgery at the [[University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey]]. She measured breast movement of women running on treadmills. Sought out by bra manufacturers for her expertise, she advocated wide bottom bands for extra support and firm straps that minimized breasts bounce. Renelle Braaten, a Montana hairdresser, struggled to contain her [[Bra size|DD]]-sized breasts while playing racquetball and volleyball. Unable to interest mainstream bra manufacturers, she collaborated with freelance apparel designer Heidi Fisk, and founded Enell Incorporated. After considerable lobbying, she persuaded [[Oprah Winfrey]] in 2001 to try her bra. This led to very positive reviews in ''[[O: The Oprah Magazine]]'', a 2001 appearance on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', and a huge surge in orders.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

==Design challenges==
Sports bras can either encapsulate or compress breasts. Bras that encapsulate breasts have molded cups, while compression-type bras restrict movement by flattening the breasts. Encapsulation-type bras generally are more effective at reducing discomfort, but some women prefer compression designs.

The most common sports bra is basically designed like a [[Sleeveless shirt|tank top]] with the bottom half cut off. Other designs use gel and water pads, silver fibres, and air bags. A stitchless bra was made by [[Wacoal]], was molded, compressed, and shaped. A compressed bra is designed to push the breasts against the chest to reduce movement and bounce. Other bras are knitted in circular patterns, giving varying stretch and support.&lt;ref name="casselman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Casselman |first=Anne |date=2005 |title=The Physics of Bras |journal=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |volume=26 |issue=11 |pages= |id= |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2005/nov/physics-of-bras |accessdate=2014-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A common design uses a stretchable, absorbent fabric such as [[Lycra]] designed to reduce irritation by drawing [[perspiration]] away from the skin.

Sports bras are also worn by women after certain surgical procedures. In those situations, a front-closing sports bra with a compression, seamless cup is recommended for healing and comfort. Certain fabrics such as Lycra have been found to help reduce swelling and help "even-out" a bustline that has been altered by a surgical procedure.

Sports bras are also manufactured for men with large breasts to enable them to take part more comfortably in physical activity. Some descriptions used euphemistically to describe bras for men are chest binders, compression vests or shimmels.&lt;ref name="Bumgardner"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Bumgardner |first=Wendy |url=http://walking.about.com/od/sportsbras/a/sensmensbra.htm |title=Men Who Need Chest Support |publisher=[[About.com]] |accessdate=2011-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem arises from the shoulder straps of standard bras. Standard well-fitting bras are constructed in the form of a "square frame", with all dimensions adjusted for each woman in a normal standing position, with arms to the sides. When a woman performs an activity which requires her to lift her arms above the shoulders, the frame is strained because it is anchored by the chest band, putting direct pressure on the shoulder [[trapezius muscles]]. This may result in neck and shoulder pain, numbness and tingling in the arm and headaches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/utsw/cda/dept16498/files/311483.html Dr. Karen Kowalske.

==Levels of control==
Different physical activities require different levels of breast control. [[Yoga]], [[walking]] and [[gardening]] require only "light" control;  [[bicycling]], [[power walking]] and [[hiking]] require "moderate" control; [[tennis]], [[soccer]] and [[jogging]] requires "firm" control; and [[running]], intense  [[workout]]s, [[Women's boxing|boxing]] and [[horseback riding]] requires "maximum" control.

Some female athletes are concerned that a sports bra may interfere with breathing, but even though increased pressure on the rib cage has been demonstrated, no significant effect on breathing can be shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bowles |first=KA |authorlink= |author2=Steele, JR |author3=Chaunchaiyakul, R  |date=September 2005 |title=Do current sports brassiere designs impede respiratory function? |journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc |volume=37 |issue=9 |pages=1633–40 |pmid = 16177619 |doi=10.1249/01.mss.0000177590.75686.28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exercise discomfort==

About 50 percent of women report some pain or discomfort in their breasts during exercise. This varies considerably in intensity and may depend on what they are wearing. In an Australian study 3 women (17–21, cup sizes B and C) were photographed exercising bare breasted, again wearing two different bra models, and a fourth time wearing a specific sports bra. As expected, breast motion was reduced by bras, and the sports bra was the most effective. The women reported less discomfort with bras and especially with the sports bra. However, not all sports bras are created equally and a woman should be properly fitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mason |first=BR |author2=Page, KA |author3=Fallon, K  |date=June 1999 |title=An analysis of movement and discomfort of the female breast during exercise and the effects of breast support in three cases |journal=J Sci Med Sport |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=134–44 |pmid=10476977 |doi=10.1016/S1440-2440(99)80193-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=J.|last2=Scurr|first2=J.|title=Evaluation of professional bra fitting criteria for bra selection and fitting in the UK|journal=Ergonomics|date=June 2012|volume=55|issue=6|pages=704–711|doi=10.1080/00140139.2011.647096|pmid=22397508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2007, scientist Doctor Joanna Scurr of the [[University of Portsmouth]] conducted a motion study of seventy women while running. They represented the widest range of breast sizes ever studied, from A up to JJ. Glamour model [[Katie Price|Jordan]], whose bra cup size is F, is six cup sizes smaller than Scurr’s biggest breasted subject.&lt;ref name=sciencedaily/&gt; Scurr found that breasts move in three planes of motion during exercise - vertically, horizontally, and laterally, in an overall figure-8 motion. Unrestrained movement of large breasts may contribute to sagging over time.&lt;ref name=medbroadcast&gt;{{cite web|title=Why do breasts sag?|url=http://www.medbroadcast.com/channel_section_details.asp?text_id=5822&amp;channel_id=1003&amp;relation_id=4536#.Tyq1CoGEzXY|work=MedBroadcast.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Motion studies have revealed that when a woman runs, more than 50% of the breast's total movement is vertical, 22% side-to-side, and 27% in-and-out.&lt;ref name=calf&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthy Breast: Why You Should Wear Sports Bras on Every Workout?|url=http://www.calfreduction.net/content/healthy-breast%3A-why-you-should-wear-sports-bras-every-workout%3F|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2007 study found that encapsulation-type sports bras, in which each cup is separately molded, are more effective than compression-type bras, which press the breasts close to the body, at reducing total breast motion during exercise. Encapsulation bras reduce motion in two of the three planes, while compression bras reduce motion in only one plane.&lt;ref name=sciencedaily&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070915124901.htm |publisher=University of Portsmouth |date=September 23, 2007 |title= Bouncing Breasts Spark New Bra Challenge |accessdate=3 Feb 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, it was commonly believed that a woman with small to medium-size breasts benefited most from a compression-type sports bra, and women with larger breasts need an encapsulation-type sports bra.&lt;ref name=calf/&gt;

The work of Scurr has criticised this belief and has shown that this is not the case.

In 2010 Scurr, White and Hedger conducted a study on the effect of breast support on the movement of the breast during the running gait cycle. The aim of this study was to investigate the multi-directional breast displacement, velocity and acceleration with and without breast support during running and also to establish the correlation with breast comfort. 15 D cup participants were used and all regularly participated in exercise. Using treadmill running in three different bra conditions, (No bra, T-shirt bra and sports bra) they concluded that breast displacement and velocity were reduced as breast support increased and that no particular direction of breast movement showed a stronger relationship to breast pain. Further to this they found that breast discomfort was most closely correlated to breast velocity.&lt;ref&gt;Scurr. J.C., White, J.L., and Hedger. W. (2010) The effect of breast support on the kinematics of the breast during the running gait cycle. Journal of Sports sciences, 28(10), 1103–1109&lt;/ref&gt;

A later study in 2011 by Scurr et al. looked at supported and unsupported breast displacement with the aim to quantify multi-directional breast displacement across varying activity levels and in varying breast support conditions. The study used 21 D cup participants and activity levels varied from treadmill walking to maximal treadmill running. Maximum displacement was found in the right breast during the unsupported condition at 15&amp;nbsp;km/h, this showed an overall displacement of 15.8&amp;nbsp;cm. Results also showed that breast displacement was reduced as breast support increased by up to 59% in an encapsulation bra versus no bra. Results also showed that there was a significant increase in breast displacement as treadmill speed increased up to 10&amp;nbsp;km/h. The results of this study concluded that at higher speeds of activity, vertical breast displacement was highest, however side-to-side and forwards-backwards movement still accounted for half of the total breast displacement. Therefore, this means that sports bra design should primarily concentrate on vertical displacement factors but not totally ignore other planes of motion. The study also suggested that as no evidence was found that breast support requirements change as running speed increased. Designs should look into sports-specific sports bras that will account for the individual variances of breast displacement in different sports.&lt;ref&gt;Scurr.J.C., White, J.L., and Hedger.W. (2011) Supported and unsupported breast displacement in three dimensions across treadmill activity levels. Journal of Sports sciences, 29(1), 55–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further research at the [[University of Portsmouth]] by Debbie Risius has shown that sports bras may also need to account for differences linked to age as well as size. Her research has shown that younger women's breasts experience more up and down motion whereas older women (45+) experience more side to side and in-out movement of the breasts. This suggests that standard sports bra may not be suitable for all ages of women. Therefore, designs must be adapted to create bras for older women that will support the specific movement shown by the breasts. This may encourage more older women to participate in sport and to feel more comfortable whilst doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uopnews.port.ac.uk/2012/09/24/older-breast-has-less-bounce/|title=Older breast has less bounce {{!}} UoP News|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wiener AF''' or '''WAF''' was a football club which played in [[Austria]]. It dissolved in 2004.

==History==
The club was established at the end of the 1909–10 season after most of the first-team squad of [[Wiener AC]] (known as WAC) left the club to form a new club.&lt;ref name=RSSSF&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tableso/oost-tagblatt.html Austria - Tagblatt-Pokal 1900-1903] RSSSF&lt;/ref&gt; The club was named '''Wiener Assoziationsfootball Club''', aiming to inherit the WAC abbreviation. However, the club became generally known as Wiener Assoziations Footballclub (WAF).&lt;ref name=RSSSF/&gt;

On 21 September 1910, the club gained entry to the 1. Klasse division.&lt;ref name=RSSSF/&gt; WAF and [[Wiener Sport-Club]] were the best teams during the Autumn part of the season; as a result, a play-off match was held between the two clubs. The first game was a 1–1 draw, with WAF winning the replay 3–1.&lt;ref name=RSSSF/&gt;

In [[1911–12 Austrian football championship|1911–12]] WAF finished fourth in the league. After finishing second in [[1912–13 Austrian football championship|1912–13]], they won the league in [[1913–14 Austrian football championship|1913–14]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tableso/oostchamp.html Austria - List of Champions] RSSSF&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921–22 the club won the [[Austrian Cup]] for the only time in their history, beating [[FK Austria Wien|SV Amateure]] 2–1 in the final.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tableso/oostcuphist.html Austria - List of Cup Finals] RSSSF&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1923–24 Austrian football championship|1923–24]] the club finished bottom of the 1. Klasse division and were relegated to the second tier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tableso/oosthist.html#24 Austria Final League Tables (First and Second Level)] RSSSF&lt;/ref&gt;
