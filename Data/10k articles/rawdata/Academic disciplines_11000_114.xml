'''Aerospace engineering''' is the primary field of [[engineering]] concerned with the development of [[aircraft]] and [[spacecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Aerospace Engineering''. [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], 2010. {{ISBN|978-0-470-75440-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has two major and overlapping branches: Aeronautical engineering and Astronautical Engineering.  [[Avionics]] engineering is similar, but deals with the [[electronic engineering|electronics]] side of aerospace engineering.

[[Aeronautics|Aeronautical engineering]] was the original term for the field. As [[flight technology]] advanced to include craft operating in [[outer space]] ([[astronautics]]), the broader term "[[aerospace]] engineering" has come into common use.&lt;ref name=britannica_Engineering&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title= Engineering |author= Stanzione, Kaydon Al |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica |volume= 18 |edition= 15 |pages= 563–563 |year= 1989 |location= Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aerospace engineering, particularly the astronautics branch, is often colloquially referred to as "[[rocket science (disambiguation)|rocket science]]".&lt;ref name=SA/&gt;

==Overview==
Flight vehicles are subjected to demanding conditions such as those produced by changes in [[atmospheric pressure]] and [[temperature]], with [[structural load]]s applied upon vehicle components. Consequently, they are usually the products of various technological and [[List of engineering branches|engineering disciplines]] including [[aerodynamics]], [[Air propulsion|propulsion]], [[avionics]], [[materials science]], [[structural analysis]] and [[manufacturing]]. The interaction between these technologies is known as aerospace engineering. Because of the complexity and number of disciplines involved, aerospace engineering is carried out by teams of engineers, each having their own specialized area of expertise.&lt;ref name=Princeton_review&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/cte/profiles/dayInLife.asp?careerID=5 |title=Career: Aerospace Engineer |accessdate=2006-10-08 |work=Career Profiles |publisher=The Princeton Review |quote=Due to the complexity of the final product, an intricate and rigid organizational structure for production has to be maintained, severely curtailing any single engineer's ability to understand his role as it relates to the final project. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509023617/http://www.princetonreview.com/cte/profiles/dayInLife.asp?careerID=5 |archivedate=2006-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Aviation history}}
[[File:First flight2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Orville and Wilbur Wright]] flew the [[Wright Flyer]] in 1903 at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.]]

The origin of aerospace engineering can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the late 19th to early 20th centuries, although the work of Sir [[George Cayley]] dates from the last decade of the 18th to mid-19th century. One of the most important people in the history of [[aeronautics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Sir George Cayley |url= http://www.flyingmachines.org/cayl.html |publisher= ? |date= |accessdate= 2009-07-26 |quote= Sir George Cayley is one of the most important people in the history of aeronautics. Many consider him the first true scientific aerial investigator and the first person to understand the underlying principles and forces of flight.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cayley was a pioneer in aeronautical engineering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Sir George Cayley (British Inventor and Scientist) |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/100795/Sir-George-Cayley-6th-Baronet |publisher= Britannica |date= n.d. |accessdate= 2009-07-26 |quote= English pioneer of aerial navigation and aeronautical engineering and designer of the first successful glider to carry a human being aloft.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is credited as the first person to separate the forces of [[Lift (force)|lift]] and [[Drag (physics)|drag]], which are in effect on any flight vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Sir George Cayley |url= http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Dictionary/Cayley/DI15.htm |publisher= U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission |date= |accessdate= 31 January 2016 |quote= A wealthy landowner, Cayley is considered the father of aerial navigation and a pioneer in the science of aerodynamics. He established the scientific principles for heavier-than-air flight and used glider models for his research. He was the first to identify the [[four forces of flight]]--thrust, lift, drag, and weight—and to describe the relationship each had with the other.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering.&lt;ref name=americana&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author= [[Kermit Van Every]] |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia Americana |title= Aeronautical engineering |edition= |year= 1988 |publisher= Grolier Incorporated |volume= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists understood some key elements of aerospace engineering, like [[fluid dynamics]], in the 18th century. Many years later after the successful flights by the [[Wright brothers]], the 1910s saw the development of aeronautical engineering through the design of [[World War I]] military aircraft.

The first definition of aerospace engineering appeared in February 1958.&lt;ref name=britannica_Engineering /&gt; The definition considered the Earth's atmosphere and the outer space as a single realm, thereby encompassing both aircraft (''aero'') and spacecraft (''space'') under a newly coined word ''[[aerospace]]''. In response to the USSR launching the first satellite, [[Sputnik]] into space on October 4, 1957, U.S. aerospace engineers launched the [[Explorer I|first American satellite]] on January 31, 1958.  The [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] was founded in 1958 as a response to the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/factsheet.htm |title=A Brief History of NASA |publisher= NASA |date= |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:engine.f15.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|A fighter jet engine undergoing testing. The tunnel behind the engine allows noise and exhaust to escape.]]
* [[Radar cross-section]]&amp;nbsp;– the study of vehicle signature apparent to [[Radar]] [[remote sensing]].
*[[Fluid mechanics]]&amp;nbsp;– the study of [[fluid flow]] around objects. Specifically [[aerodynamics]] concerning the flow of air over bodies such as [[wing]]s or through objects such as [[wind tunnel]]s (see also [[lift (force)|lift]] and [[aeronautics]]).
* [[Astrodynamics]]&amp;nbsp;– the study of [[orbital mechanics]] including prediction of orbital elements when given a select few variables.  While few schools in the United States teach this at the undergraduate level, several have graduate programs covering this topic (usually in conjunction with the Physics department of said college or university).
* [[Statics]] and [[Dynamics (physics)|Dynamics]] (engineering mechanics)&amp;nbsp;– the study of movement, forces, moments in mechanical systems.
* [[Mathematics]]&amp;nbsp;– in particular, [[calculus]], [[differential equations]], and [[linear algebra]].
* [[Electrotechnology]]&amp;nbsp;– the study of [[electronics]] within engineering.
* Propulsion&amp;nbsp;– the energy to move a vehicle through the air (or in outer space) is provided by [[internal combustion engine]]s, [[jet engine]]s and [[turbomachinery]], or [[rocket]]s (see also [[propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] and [[spacecraft propulsion]]). A more recent addition to this module is [[electric propulsion]] and [[ion propulsion]].
* [[Control engineering]]&amp;nbsp;– the study of [[mathematical modeling]] of the [[Flight dynamics|dynamic]] behavior of systems and designing them, usually using feedback signals, so that their dynamic behavior is desirable (stable, without large excursions, with minimum error). This applies to the dynamic behavior of aircraft, spacecraft, propulsion systems, and subsystems that exist on aerospace vehicles.
* [[Aircraft structures]]&amp;nbsp;– design of the physical configuration of the craft to withstand the forces encountered during flight. Aerospace engineering aims to keep structures lightweight and low-cost while maintaining structural integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Aircraft Structures in Aerospace Engineering |url= http://aerospaceengineering.aero/aircraft-structures-in-aerospace-engineering/ |work= Aerospace Engineering, Aviation News, Salary, Jobs and Museums |accessdate= 2015-11-06 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151109124154/http://aerospaceengineering.aero/aircraft-structures-in-aerospace-engineering/ |archive-date= 2015-11-09 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Materials science]]&amp;nbsp;– related to structures, aerospace engineering also studies the materials of which the aerospace structures are to be built. New materials with very specific properties are invented, or existing ones are modified to improve their performance.
* [[Solid mechanics]]&amp;nbsp;– Closely related to material science is solid mechanics which deals with stress and strain analysis of the components of the vehicle. Nowadays there are several Finite Element programs such as MSC Patran/Nastran which aid engineers in the analytical process.
* [[Aeroelasticity]]&amp;nbsp;– the interaction of aerodynamic forces and structural flexibility, potentially causing [[Aeroelastic flutter|flutter]], divergence, etc.
* [[Avionics]]&amp;nbsp;– the design and programming of [[computer systems]] on board an aircraft or spacecraft and the [[simulation]] of systems.
* [[Software]]&amp;nbsp;– the specification, design, development, test, and implementation of [[computer software]] for aerospace applications, including [[flight software]], [[ground control software]], test &amp; evaluation software, etc.
* [[Reliability engineering|Risk and reliability]]&amp;nbsp;– the study of risk and reliability assessment techniques and the mathematics involved in the quantitative methods.
* [[Noise control]]&amp;nbsp;– the study of the mechanics of sound transfer.
* [[Aeroacoustics]]&amp;nbsp;– the study of noise generation via either turbulent fluid motion or aerodynamic forces interacting with surfaces.
* [[Flight test]]&amp;nbsp;– designing and executing flight test programs in order to gather and analyze performance and [[handling qualities]] data in order to determine if an aircraft meets its design and performance goals and certification requirements.

The basis of most of these elements lies in theoretical [[physics]], such as [[fluid dynamics]] for aerodynamics or the [[equations of motion]] for [[flight dynamics]]. There is also a large [[empiricism|empirical]] component. Historically, this empirical component was derived from testing of scale models and prototypes, either in [[wind tunnel]]s or in the free atmosphere. More recently, advances in [[computing]] have enabled the use of [[computational fluid dynamics]] to simulate the behavior of the fluid, reducing time and expense spent on wind-tunnel testing. Those studying hydrodynamics or [[Hydroacoustics]] often obtained degrees in Aerospace Engineering.

Additionally, aerospace engineering addresses the integration of all components that constitute an aerospace vehicle (subsystems including power, [[aerospace bearing]]s, communications, [[Temperature control|thermal control]], [[life support]], etc.) and its life cycle (design, temperature, pressure, [[radiation]], [[velocity]], [[Fatigue (material)|lifetime]]).

==Degree programs==
{{main|List of aerospace engineering schools}}

Aerospace engineering may be studied at the [[diploma|advanced diploma]], [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's]], [[master's degree|master's]], and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] levels in aerospace engineering departments at many universities, and in [[mechanical engineering]] departments at others. A few departments offer degrees in space-focused astronautical engineering.  Some institutions differentiate between aeronautical and astronautical engineering.  Graduate degrees are offered in advanced or specialty areas for the aerospace industry.

A background in chemistry, physics, computer science and mathematics is important for students pursuing an aerospace engineering degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myfuture.com/careers/education/aerospace-engineers_17-2011.00 |title=Entry education, Aerospace Engineers |publisher=myfuture.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[wikt:rocket scientist|rocket scientist]]" is sometimes used to describe a person of great [[intelligence]] since rocket science is seen as a practice requiring great mental ability, especially technically and mathematically.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2413">The '''Affleck–Dine mechanism''' ('''AD mechanism''') is a postulated mechanism for explaining [[baryogenesis]] during the primordial Universe immediately following the [[Big Bang]]. Thus, the AD mechanism may explain the asymmetry between matter and anti-matter in the current Universe. It was proposed in 1985 by [[Ian Affleck]] and [[Michael Dine]] of Princeton University.&lt;ref name=npbppB249_2_361/&gt;

In the [[supersymmetry]] theory of [[particle physics]], ordinary [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s have scalar partners that carry [[Baryon number|baryon]] and [[lepton number]]s. As the latter decay into [[fermion]]s during the early Universe, the net baryon number that they carry can then form the currently observed excess of ordinary baryons. This occurs due to interactions of the scalars with the [[inflaton]] field, resulting in [[CP violation]]s.&lt;ref name=muelmenstaedt2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=rmp76_1_1/&gt;

The AD mechanism must have occurred during or after the reheating event that followed [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]]. This may explain why the net mass of normal matter and [[dark matter]] are apparently so close to each other, rather than being widely different.&lt;ref name=rmp76_1_1/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3021">'''Alfred Wotquenne''' ({{IPA-fr|wɔtkɛn|lang}}&lt;!--Belgian French phonology--&gt;; 25 January 1867{{spaced ndash}}25 September 1939) was a Belgian musical [[bibliographer]], best known for his catalogues of the works of [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]] and [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]].

==Biography==
Wotquenne was born in [[Lobbes]], [[Hainaut (province)|Hainault]], Belgium. He studied at [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels|Brussels' Conservatoire Royal]], where his teachers included [[Louis Brassin]] (piano), {{ill|Alphonse Mailly|fr}} (organ), and [[François-Auguste Gevaert]] (theory). In 1894 he was appointed the chief librarian of the conservatoire; he retained this post until 1918. During his time the library acquired a great many works, both printed and in manuscript.

The best known of Wotquenne's achievements is his 1905 bibliographical study of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, but he also performed similar services for other composers: [[Baldassare Galuppi]] (1900), [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] (1905), and [[Luigi Rossi]] (1909).&lt;ref name=grove&gt;''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', 5th ed, 1954, Vol. IX, p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; He also contributed to a complete inventory of the works of a fellow-Belgian, the [[Liège]]-born [[André Grétry]].

Thanks to Wotquenne's efforts, C. P. E. Bach's pieces came to be known by their "Wq" numbers. They are now also known by their "H" numbers, from a new and more thorough catalogue by Eugene Helm (1989). A concordance between these systems is available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.wagner.edu/david-schulenberg/c-p-e-bach-pages/ Indexes, Concordances, and Other Material for the Study of Music by C.P.E. Bach], David Schulenberg, [[Wagner College]]&lt;/ref&gt;

By royal decree he lost the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]] and his position on 9 August 1919; he was convicted for "participating with the enemy".&lt;ref&gt;KB 9.8.1919: Leopoldsorde Schrapping: Werkdadige hulp aan den Vijand&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=December 2017}} He was arrested in 1918.

From 1921 Wotquenne lived in France, working in [[Antibes]] as a choir master and organ teacher. He died at Antibes shortly after the outbreak of World War II.

{{Electromagnetism |Network}}

'''Alternating current''' ('''AC''') is an [[electric current]] which periodically reverses direction, in contrast to [[direct current]] ('''DC''') which flows only in one direction. Alternating current is the form in which [[electric power]] is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of [[electrical energy]] that consumers typically use when they plug [[kitchen appliance]]s, televisions, fans and electric lamps into a [[wall socket]]. A common source of DC power is a [[battery (electricity)|battery cell]] in a [[flashlight]]. The abbreviations ''AC'' and ''DC'' are often used to mean simply ''alternating'' and ''direct'', as when they modify ''[[Electric current|current]]'' or ''[[voltage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Basic Electronics &amp; Linear Circuits| author = N.

The usual [[waveform]] of alternating current in most electric power circuits is a [[sine wave]], whose positive half-period corresponds with positive direction of the current and vice versa. In certain applications, different waveforms are used, such as [[Triangle wave|triangular]] or [[square wave]]s. [[Audio frequency|Audio]] and [[radio frequency|radio]] signals carried on electrical wires are also examples of alternating current. These types of alternating current carry information such as sound (audio) or images (video) sometimes carried by [[modulation]] of an AC carrier signal. These currents typically alternate at higher frequencies than those used in power transmission.

==Transmission, distribution, and domestic power supply==

{{Main|Electric power transmission|Electric power distribution}}
[[File:Electric Transmission.png|thumb|265px|A schematic representation of long distance electric power transmission.  C=consumers, D=step down transformer, G=generator, I=current in the wires, Pe=power reaching the end of the transmission line, Pt=power entering the transmission line, Pw=power lost in the transmission line, R=total resistance in the wires, V=voltage at the beginning of the transmission line, U=step up transformer.]]

Electrical energy is distributed as alternating current because AC [[voltage]] may be increased or decreased with a [[transformer]]. This allows the power to be transmitted through [[power line]]s efficiently at high voltage, which reduces the energy lost as heat due to [[electrical resistance|resistance]] of the wire, and transformed to a lower, safer, voltage for use. Use of a higher voltage leads to significantly more efficient transmission of power. The power losses (&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm w}&lt;/math&gt;) in the wire are a product of the square of the current (I) and the [[electrical resistance|resistance]] (R) of the wire, described by the formula
:&lt;math&gt; P_{\rm w} = I^2 R \, .&lt;/math&gt;
This means that when transmitting a fixed power on a given wire, if the current is halved (i.e. the voltage is doubled), the power loss will be four times less.

The power transmitted is equal to the product of the current and the voltage (assuming no phase difference); that is,
:&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm t} = IV \, .&lt;/math&gt;
Consequently, power transmitted at a higher voltage requires less loss-producing current than for the same power at a lower voltage. Power is often transmitted at hundreds of kilovolts, and transformed to 100&amp;nbsp;V – 240&amp;nbsp;V for domestic use.

[[File:Highvoltagetransmissionlines.jpg|thumb|right|265px|High voltage transmission lines deliver power from [[electric generation]] plants over long distances using alternating current. These lines are located in eastern [[Utah]].]]

High voltages have disadvantages, such as the increased insulation required, and generally increased difficulty in their safe handling. In a [[power plant]], energy is generated at a convenient voltage for the design of a [[Electric generator|generator]], and then stepped up to a high voltage for transmission. Near the loads, the transmission voltage is stepped down to the voltages used by equipment. Consumer voltages vary somewhat depending on the country and size of load, but generally motors and lighting are built to use up to a few hundred volts between phases. The voltage delivered to equipment such as lighting and motor loads is standardized, with an allowable range of voltage over which equipment is expected to operate. Standard power utilization voltages and percentage tolerance vary in the different [[mains power systems]] found in the world. [[High-voltage direct current|High-voltage direct-current]] (HVDC) electric power transmission systems have become more viable as technology has provided efficient means of changing the voltage of DC power. Transmission with high voltage direct current was not feasible in the early days of [[electric power transmission]], as there was then no economically viable way to step down the voltage of DC for end user applications such as lighting incandescent bulbs.

[[Three-phase electric power|Three-phase]] electrical generation is very common. The simplest way is to use three separate coils in the generator [[stator]], physically offset by an angle of 120° (one-third of a complete 360° phase) to each other. Three current waveforms are produced that are equal in magnitude and 120° [[out of phase]] to each other. If coils are added opposite to these (60° spacing), they generate the same phases with reverse polarity and so can be simply wired together. In practice, higher "pole orders" are commonly used. For example, a 12-pole machine would have 36 coils (10° spacing). The advantage is that lower rotational speeds can be used to generate the same frequency. For example, a 2-pole machine running at 3600&amp;nbsp;rpm and a 12-pole machine running at 600&amp;nbsp;rpm produce the same frequency; the lower speed is preferable for larger machines. If the load on a three-phase system is balanced equally among the phases, no current flows through the [[neutral point]]. Even in the worst-case unbalanced (linear) load, the neutral current will not exceed the highest of the phase currents. Non-linear loads (e.g. the switch-mode power supplies widely used) may require an oversized neutral bus and neutral conductor in the upstream distribution panel to handle [[Harmonic (electrical power)|harmonics]]. Harmonics can cause neutral conductor current levels to exceed that of one or all phase conductors.

For three-phase at utilization voltages a four-wire system is often used. When stepping down three-phase, a transformer with a Delta (3-wire) primary and a Star (4-wire, center-earthed) secondary is often used so there is no need for a neutral on the supply side. For smaller customers (just how small varies by country and age of the installation) only a [[single-phase electric power|single phase]] and neutral, or two phases and neutral, are taken to the property. For larger installations all three phases and neutral are taken to the main distribution panel. From the three-phase main panel, both single and three-phase circuits may lead off. [[Split-phase electric power|Three-wire single-phase]] systems, with a single center-tapped transformer giving two live conductors, is a common distribution scheme for residential and small commercial buildings in North America. This arrangement is sometimes incorrectly referred to as "two phase". A similar method is used for a different reason on construction sites in the UK. Small power tools and lighting are supposed to be supplied by a local center-tapped transformer with a voltage of 55&amp;nbsp;V between each power conductor and earth. This significantly reduces the risk of [[electric shock]] in the event that one of the live conductors becomes exposed through an equipment fault whilst still allowing a reasonable voltage of 110&amp;nbsp;V between the two conductors for running the tools.

A [[Ground and neutral|third wire]], called the bond (or earth) wire, is often connected between non-current-carrying metal enclosures and earth ground. This conductor provides protection from electric shock due to accidental contact of circuit conductors with the metal chassis of portable appliances and tools. Bonding all non-current-carrying metal parts into one complete system ensures there is always a low [[electrical impedance]] path to ground sufficient to carry any [[Fault (power engineering)|fault]] current for as long as it takes for the system to clear the fault. This low impedance path allows the maximum amount of fault current, causing the overcurrent protection device (breakers, fuses) to trip or burn out as quickly as possible, bringing the electrical system to a safe state. All bond wires are bonded to ground at the main service panel, as is the neutral/identified conductor if present.

==AC power supply frequencies==
{{further|Mains electricity by country}}

The [[Utility frequency|frequency of the electrical system]] varies by country and sometimes within a country; most electric power is generated at either 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz]]. Some countries have a mixture of 50&amp;nbsp;Hz and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz supplies, notably [[Electricity sector in Japan#Transmission|electricity power transmission in Japan]]. A low frequency eases the design of electric motors, particularly for hoisting, crushing and rolling applications, and commutator-type [[traction motor]]s for applications such as [[railway]]s. However, low frequency also causes noticeable flicker in [[arc lamp]]s and [[incandescent light bulb]]s. The use of lower frequencies also provided the advantage of lower impedance losses, which are proportional to frequency. The original Niagara Falls generators were built to produce 25&amp;nbsp;Hz power, as a compromise between low frequency for traction and heavy induction motors, while still allowing incandescent lighting to operate (although with noticeable flicker). Most of the 25&amp;nbsp;Hz residential and commercial customers for Niagara Falls power were converted to 60&amp;nbsp;Hz by the late 1950s, although some{{which|date=December 2011}} 25&amp;nbsp;Hz industrial customers still existed as of the start of the 21st century. 16.7&amp;nbsp;Hz power (formerly 16 2/3&amp;nbsp;Hz) is still used in some European rail systems, such as in [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Switzerland]]. Off-shore, military, textile industry, marine, aircraft, and spacecraft applications sometimes use 400&amp;nbsp;Hz, for benefits of reduced weight of apparatus or higher motor speeds. Computer [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] systems were often powered by 400&amp;nbsp;Hz or 415&amp;nbsp;Hz for benefits of [[ripple (electrical)|ripple]] reduction while using smaller internal AC to DC conversion units.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecmweb.com/basics/basics-400-hz-power-systems The Basics of 400-Hz Power Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the input to the M-G set is the local customary voltage and frequency, variously 200&amp;nbsp;V (Japan), 208&amp;nbsp;V, 240&amp;nbsp;V (North America), 380&amp;nbsp;V, 400&amp;nbsp;V or 415&amp;nbsp;V (Europe), and variously 50&amp;nbsp;Hz or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz.

==Effects at high frequencies==

{{main|Skin effect}}

[[File:22. Теслин трансформатор.ogv|thumb|left|280px|A [[Tesla coil]] producing high-frequency current that is harmless to humans, but  lights a [[fluorescent lamp]] when brought near it]]

A direct current flows uniformly throughout the cross-section of a uniform wire. An alternating current of any frequency is forced away from the wire's center, toward its outer surface. This is because the acceleration of an [[electric charge]] in an alternating current produces [[electromagnetic waves|waves]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] that cancel the propagation of electricity toward the center of materials with high [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]]. This phenomenon is called [[skin effect]]. At very high frequencies the current no longer flows ''in'' the wire, but effectively flows ''on'' the surface of the wire, within a thickness of a few [[skin depth]]s. The skin depth is the thickness at which the current density is reduced by 63%. Even at relatively low frequencies used for power transmission (50&amp;nbsp;Hz – 60&amp;nbsp;Hz), non-uniform distribution of current still occurs in sufficiently thick [[Electrical conductor|conductor]]s. For example, the skin depth of a copper conductor is approximately 8.57&amp;nbsp;mm at 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, so high current conductors are usually hollow to reduce their mass and cost. Since the current tends to flow in the periphery of conductors, the effective cross-section of the conductor is reduced. This increases the effective AC [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of the conductor, since resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. The AC resistance often is many times higher than the DC resistance, causing a much higher energy loss due to [[ohmic heating]] (also called I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;R loss).

{{clear}}

===Techniques for reducing AC resistance===
For low to medium frequencies, conductors can be divided into stranded wires, each insulated from one another, and the relative positions of individual strands specially arranged within the conductor bundle. Wire constructed using this technique is called [[Litz wire]]. This measure helps to partially mitigate skin effect by forcing more equal current throughout the total cross section of the stranded conductors. Litz wire is used for making [[Quality factor|high-Q]] [[inductor]]s, reducing losses in flexible conductors carrying very high currents at lower frequencies, and in the windings of devices carrying higher [[radio frequency]] current (up to hundreds of kilohertz), such as switch-mode [[power supply|power supplies]] and [[radio frequency]] [[transformer]]s.

===Techniques for reducing radiation loss===
As written above, an alternating current is made of [[electric charge]] under periodic [[acceleration]], which causes [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]] of [[electromagnetic waves]]. Energy that is radiated is lost. Depending on the frequency, different techniques are used to minimize the loss due to radiation.

====Twisted pairs====
At frequencies up to about 1&amp;nbsp;GHz, pairs of wires are twisted together in a cable, forming a [[twisted pair]]. This reduces losses from [[electromagnetic radiation]] and [[inductive coupling]]. A twisted pair must be used with a balanced signalling system, so that the two wires carry equal but opposite currents. Each wire in a twisted pair radiates a signal, but it is effectively cancelled by radiation from the other wire, resulting in almost no radiation loss.

====Coaxial cables====
[[Coaxial cable]]s are commonly used at [[Audio frequency|audio frequencies]] and above for convenience. A coaxial cable has a conductive wire inside a conductive tube, separated by a [[dielectric]] layer. The current flowing on the surface of the inner conductor is equal and opposite to the current flowing on the inner surface of the outer tube. The electromagnetic field is thus completely contained within the tube, and (ideally) no energy is lost to radiation or coupling outside the tube. Coaxial cables have acceptably small losses for frequencies up to about 5&amp;nbsp;GHz. For [[microwave]] frequencies greater than 5&amp;nbsp;GHz, the losses (due mainly to the electrical resistance of the central conductor) become too large, making [[Waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguides]] a more efficient medium for transmitting energy. Coaxial cables with an air rather than solid dielectric are preferred as they transmit power with lower loss.

====Waveguides====
[[Waveguide (electromagnetism)|Waveguides]] are similar to coaxial cables, as both consist of tubes, with the biggest difference being that the waveguide has no inner conductor. Waveguides can have any arbitrary cross section, but rectangular cross sections are the most common. Because waveguides do not have an inner conductor to carry a return current, waveguides cannot deliver energy by means of an [[electric current]], but rather by means of a ''guided'' [[electromagnetic field]]. Although [[Current density|surface currents]] do flow on the inner walls of the waveguides, those surface currents do not carry power. Power is carried by the guided electromagnetic fields. The surface currents are set up by the guided electromagnetic fields and have the effect of keeping the fields inside the waveguide and preventing leakage of the fields to the space outside the waveguide. Waveguides have dimensions comparable to the [[wavelength]] of the alternating current to be transmitted, so they are only feasible at microwave frequencies. In addition to this mechanical feasibility, [[electrical resistance]] of the non-ideal metals forming the walls of the waveguide cause [[dissipation]] of power (surface currents flowing on lossy [[electrical conductor|conductors]] dissipate power). At higher frequencies, the power lost to this dissipation becomes unacceptably large.

====Fiber optics====
At frequencies greater than 200&amp;nbsp;GHz, waveguide dimensions become impractically small, and the [[ohmic heating|ohmic losses]] in the waveguide walls become large. Instead, [[fibre optics|fiber optics]], which are a form of dielectric waveguides, can be used. For such frequencies, the concepts of voltages and currents are no longer used.

[[File:Sine wave 2.svg|right|thumb|A sine wave, over one cycle (360°). The dashed line represents the [[root mean square]] (RMS) value at about 0.707]]
Alternating currents are accompanied (or caused) by alternating voltages. An AC voltage ''v'' can be described mathematically as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of time by the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;v(t)=V_\mathrm{peak}\cdot\sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;,

where
*&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle V_{\rm peak}&lt;/math&gt; is the peak voltage (unit: [[volt]]),
*&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]] (unit: [[radians per second]])
**The angular frequency is related to the physical frequency, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f&lt;/math&gt; (unit = [[hertz]]), which represents the number of cycles per second, by the equation &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\omega = 2\pi f&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle t&lt;/math&gt; is the time (unit: [[second]]).

The peak-to-peak value of an AC voltage is defined as the difference between its positive peak and its negative peak. Since the maximum value of &lt;math&gt;\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt; is +1 and the minimum value is −1, an AC voltage swings between &lt;math&gt;+V_{\rm peak}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-V_{\rm peak}&lt;/math&gt;. The peak-to-peak voltage, usually written as &lt;math&gt;V_{\rm pp}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;V_{\rm P-P}&lt;/math&gt;, is therefore &lt;math&gt;V_{\rm peak} - (-V_{\rm peak}) = 2 V_{\rm peak}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Power===
{{main|AC power}}


The relationship between voltage and the power delivered is

:&lt;math&gt;p(t) = \frac{v^2(t)}{R}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; represents a load resistance.

Rather than using instantaneous power, &lt;math&gt;p(t)&lt;/math&gt;, it is more practical to use a time averaged power (where the averaging is performed over any integer number of cycles). Therefore, AC voltage is often expressed as a [[root mean square]] (RMS) value, written as &lt;math&gt;V_{\rm rms}&lt;/math&gt;, because
:&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm time~averaged} = \frac{{V_{\rm rms}}^2}{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

;Power oscillation
:&lt;math&gt;v(t)=V_\mathrm{peak}\sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i(t)=\frac{v(t)}{R}=\frac{V_\mathrm{peak}}{R}\sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P(t)=v(t)\ i(t)=\frac{(V_\mathrm{peak})^2}{R} \sin^2(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

===Root mean square voltage{{anchor|Root mean square}}===
{{further|RMS amplitude}}
{{broader|Root mean square voltage}}

Below it is assumed an [[AC waveform]] (with no [[DC component]]).

The RMS voltage is the square '''R'''oot of the [[Mean of a function|'''M'''ean]] over one cycle of the '''S'''quare of the instantaneous voltage.

*For an arbitrary periodic waveform &lt;math&gt;v(t)&lt;/math&gt; of period &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{rms}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{T} \int_0^{T}{[v(t)]^2 dt}}.&lt;/math&gt;

* For a sinusoidal voltage:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
V_\mathrm{rms} &amp;=\sqrt{\frac{1}{T} \int_0^{T}[{V_{pk}\sin( \omega t+\phi)]^2 dt}}\\
               &amp;=V_{pk}\sqrt{\frac{1}{2T} \int_0^{T}[{1-\cos(2\omega t+2\phi)] dt}}\\
               &amp;=V_{pk}\sqrt{\frac{1}{2T} \int_0^{T}{ dt}}\\
               &amp;=\frac{V_{pk}}{\sqrt {2}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

: where the [[trigonometric identity]] &lt;math&gt;\sin^2 x = \frac {1 - \cos 2x}{2}&lt;/math&gt; has been used and the factor &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[crest factor]], which varies for different waveforms.

*For a [[triangle wave]]form centered about zero
:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{rms}=\frac{V_\mathrm{peak}}{\sqrt{3}}.&lt;/math&gt;

*For a [[square wave]]form centered about zero
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle V_\mathrm{rms}=V_\mathrm{peak}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Example===
To illustrate these concepts, consider a 230&amp;nbsp;V AC [[Mains power systems|mains]] supply used in [[Mains power systems#Table of mains voltages and frequencies|many countries]] around the world. It is so called because its [[root mean square]] value is 230&amp;nbsp;V. This means that the time-averaged power delivered is equivalent to the power delivered by a DC voltage of 230&amp;nbsp;V. To determine the peak voltage (amplitude), we can rearrange the above equation to:

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{peak}=\sqrt{2}\ V_\mathrm{rms}.&lt;/math&gt;

For 230&amp;nbsp;V AC, the peak voltage &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{peak}&lt;/math&gt; is therefore &lt;math&gt;230 V\times\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;, which is about 325&amp;nbsp;V. During the course of one cycle the voltage rises from zero to 325&amp;nbsp;V, falls through zero to -325&amp;nbsp;V, and returns to zero.

==Information transmission==
Alternating current is used to transmit [[information]], as in the cases of [[telephone]] and [[cable television]]. Information signals are carried over a wide range of AC frequencies. [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] telephone signals have a frequency of about 3 kHz, close to the [[baseband]] audio frequency. Cable television and other cable-transmitted information currents may alternate at frequencies of tens to thousands of megahertz. These frequencies are similar to the electromagnetic wave frequencies often used to transmit the same types of information [[wireless|over the air]].

==History==
The first [[alternator]] to produce alternating current was a [[Dynamo|dynamo electric generator]] based on [[Michael Faraday]]'s principles constructed by the French instrument maker [[Hippolyte Pixii]] in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/java/pixiimachine/index.html |title=Pixii Machine invented by Hippolyte Pixii, National High Magnetic Field Laboratory |access-date=2012-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907092008/http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/java/pixiimachine/index.html |archive-date=2008-09-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pixii later added a [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] to his device to produce the (then) more commonly used direct current. The earliest recorded practical application of alternating current is by [[Guillaume Duchenne]], inventor and developer of [[electrotherapy]]. In 1855, he announced that AC was superior to [[direct current]] for electrotherapeutic triggering of muscle contractions.&lt;ref&gt;Licht, Sidney Herman., "History of Electrotherapy", in Therapeutic Electricity and Ultraviolet Radiation, 2nd ed., ed. Sidney Licht, New Haven: E. Licht, 1967, Pp. 1-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternating current technology had first developed in Europe due to the work of [[Guillaume Duchenne]] (1850s), the Hungarian [[Ganz Works]] company (1870s), and in the 1880s: [[Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti]], [[Lucien Gaulard]], and [[Galileo Ferraris]].

In 1876, Russian engineer [[Pavel Yablochkov]] invented a lighting system where sets of induction coils were installed along a high voltage AC line.

===Transformers===
Alternating current systems can use [[transformer]]s to change voltage from low to high level and back, allowing generation and consumption at low voltages but transmission, possibly over great distances, at high voltage, with savings in the cost of conductors and energy losses. A bipolar open-core [[Transformer|power transformer]] developed by [[Lucien Gaulard]] and [[John Dixon Gibbs]] was demonstrated in London in 1881, and attracted the interest of [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]]. They also exhibited the invention in [[Turin]] in 1884. However these early induction coils with open magnetic circuits are inefficient at transferring power to [[Electrical load|loads]]. Until about 1880, the paradigm for AC power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit. Open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps. The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp (or other electric device) affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit. Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit, including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil.&lt;ref name=FJU1889&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/historyoftransfo00upperich|last=Uppenborn|first=F. J.|title=History of the Transformer|publisher=E. &amp; F. N. Spon|location=London|date=1889|pages=35–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The direct current systems did not have these drawbacks, giving it significant advantages over early AC systems.

===Pioneers===

[[File:ZBD team.jpg|thumb|right|The Hungarian "ZBD" Team ([[Károly Zipernowsky]], [[Ottó Bláthy]], [[Miksa Déri]]), inventors of the first high efficiency, closed-core shunt connection [[transformer]]]]

[[File:DBZ trafo.jpg|right|thumb|The prototype of the ZBD transformer on display at the Széchenyi István Memorial Exhibition, [[Nagycenk]] in [[Hungary]]]]

In the autumn of 1884, [[Károly Zipernowsky]], [[Ottó Bláthy]] and [[Miksa Déri]] (ZBD), three engineers associated with the Ganz factory, determined that open-core devices were impractical, as they were incapable of reliably regulating voltage.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; In their joint 1885 patent applications for novel transformers (later called ZBD transformers), they described two designs with closed magnetic circuits where copper windings were either a wound around iron wire ring core or b)&amp;nbsp;surrounded by iron wire core.&lt;ref name=FJU1889/&gt; In both designs, the magnetic flux linking the primary and secondary windings traveled almost entirely within the confines of the iron core, with no intentional path through air (see [[transformer#Toroidal cores|toroidal cores]]). The new transformers were 3.4 times more efficient than the open-core bipolar devices of Gaulard and Gibbs.&lt;ref name=Jeszenszky&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeszenszky|first=Sándor|title=Electrostatics and Electrodynamics at Pest University in the Mid-19th Century|url=http://ppp.unipv.it/Collana/Pages/Libri/Saggi/Volta%20and%20the%20History%20of%20Electricity/V%26H%20Sect2/V%26H%20175-182.pdf|publisher=[[University of Pavia]]|accessdate=Mar 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ganz factory in 1884 shipped the world's first five high-efficiency AC transformers.&lt;ref name="Halacsy (1961)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Halacsy |first1=A.

The ZBD patents included two other major interrelated innovations: one concerning the use of parallel connected, instead of series connected, utilization loads, the other concerning the ability to have high turns ratio transformers such that the supply network voltage could be much higher (initially 1400&amp;nbsp;V to 2000&amp;nbsp;V) than the voltage of utilization loads (100&amp;nbsp;V initially preferred).&lt;ref name="Ideal (2008)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hungarian Inventors and Their Inventions |url=http://www.institutoideal.org/conteudo_eng.php?&amp;sys=biblioteca_eng&amp;arquivo=1&amp;artigo=94&amp;ano=2008 |publisher=Institute for Developing Alternative Energy in Latin America |accessdate=Mar 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322223457/http://www.institutoideal.org/conteudo_eng.php?&amp;sys=biblioteca_eng&amp;arquivo=1&amp;artigo=94&amp;ano=2008 |archivedate=2012-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BUTE-OMIKK-BlathyOtto&gt;{{cite web|title=Bláthy, Ottó Titusz|url=http://www.omikk.bme.hu/archivum/angol/htm/blathy_o.htm|publisher=Budapest University of Technology and Economics, National Technical Information Centre and Library|accessdate=Feb 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When employed in parallel connected electric distribution systems, closed-core transformers finally made it technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes, businesses and public spaces.&lt;ref name="Bláthy_HPO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bláthy, Ottó Titusz (1860 - 1939)|url=http://www.hpo.hu/English/feltalalok/blathy.html|publisher=Hungarian Patent Office

The AC power systems was developed and adopted rapidly after 1886 due to its ability to distribute electricity efficiently over long distances, overcoming the limitations of the [[direct current]] system. In 1886, the ZBD engineers designed the world's first [[power station]] that used AC generators to power a parallel-connected common electrical network, the steam-powered Rome-Cerchi power plant.&lt;ref name="IEC Techline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iec.ch/cgi-bin/tl_to_htm.pl?section=technology&amp;item=144 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930171011/http://www.iec.ch/cgi-bin/tl_to_htm.pl?section=technology&amp;item=144 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |title=Ottó Bláthy, Miksa Déri, Károly Zipernowsky |publisher=IEC Techline |accessdate=Apr 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reliability of the AC technology received impetus after the Ganz Works electrified a large European metropolis: [[Rome]] in 1886.&lt;ref name="IEC Techline"/&gt;

In the US [[William Stanley, Jr.]] designed one of the first practical devices to transfer AC power efficiently between isolated circuits. Using pairs of coils wound on a common iron core, his design, called an [[induction coil]], was an early (1885) [[transformer]]. Stanley also worked on engineering and adapting European designs such as the Gaulard and Gibbs transformer for US entrepreneur [[George Westinghouse]] who started building AC systems in 1886. The spread of Westinghouse and other AC systems triggered a push back in late 1887 by Edison (a proponent of direct current) who attempted to discredit alternating current as too dangerous in a public campaign called the "[[War of Currents]]". In 1888 alternating current systems gained further viability with introduction of a functional [[AC motor]], something these systems had lacked up till then. The design, an [[induction motor]], was independently invented by [[Galileo Ferraris]] and [[Nikola Tesla]] (with Tesla's design being licensed by Westinghouse in the US). This design was further developed into the modern practical [[three-phase]] form by [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] and [[Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[[Arnold Heertje]], Mark Perlman [https://books.google.com/books?id=qQMOPjUgWHsC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=tesla+motors+sparked+induction+motor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d0d_SjX8YX&amp;sig=sA8LhTkGdQtgByBPD_ZDalCBwQA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XoVSUPnfJo7A9gSwiICYCQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=tesla%20motors%20sparked%20induction%20motor&amp;f=false Evolving Technology and Market Structure: Studies in Schumpeterian Economics], page 138&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant]] (spring of 1891) and the original [[Niagara Falls]] [[Adams Power Plant]] (August 25, 1895) were among the first hydroelectric alternating current power plants. The first long distance transmission of single-phase electricity was from a hydroelectric generating plant in Oregon at Willamette Falls which in 1890 sent power fourteen miles downriver to downtown Portland for street lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1915|title=Electric Transmission of Power|url=|journal=General Electric Review|volume=XVIII|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1891, a second transmission system was installed in Telluride Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1915|title=Electric Transmission of Power|url=|journal=General Electric|volume=XVIII|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The San Antonio Canyon Generator was the third commercial single-phase hydroelectric AC power plant in the United States to provide long-distance electricity.  It was completed on December 31, 1892 by [[Almarian Decker|Almarian William Decker]] to provide power to the city of [[Pomona, California]] which was 14 miles away.  In 1893 he next designed the first commercial [[three-phase]] power plant in the United States using alternating current was the hydroelectric [[Mill Creek No. 1 Hydroelectric Plant]] near [[Redlands, California]].  Decker's design incorporated 10&amp;nbsp;kV three-phase transmission and established the standards for the complete system of generation, transmission and motors used today. The [[Jaruga Hydroelectric Power Plant]] in Croatia was set in operation on 28 August 1895. The two [[Electric generator|generators]] (42&amp;nbsp;Hz, 550&amp;nbsp;kW each) and the transformers were produced and installed by the Hungarian company [[Ganz]]. The transmission line from the power plant to the City of [[Šibenik]] was {{convert|11.5|km|sp=us}} long on wooden towers, and the municipal distribution grid 3000&amp;nbsp;V/110&amp;nbsp;V included six transforming stations. Alternating current circuit theory developed rapidly in the latter part of the 19th and early 20th century. Notable contributors to the theoretical basis of alternating current calculations include [[Charles Steinmetz]], [[Oliver Heaviside]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=f5FqsDPVQ2MC&amp;pg=PA1229&amp;dq=theoretical++alternating+current++Oliver+Heaviside&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bifsUOmuLKio0AHXtIGoBg&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Oliver%20Heaviside&amp;f=false I.

'''[[Angel]]s''' have appeared in works of [[art]] since early Christian art, and they have been a popular subject for [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Europe]]an paintings and sculpture.

Angels are usually intended, in both Christian and Islamic art, to be beautiful, though several depictions go for more awesome/frightening attributes, notably in the depiction of the [[Living creatures (Bible)|living creatures]] (which have beastial characteristics), [[ophanim]] (which are unanthropomorphic wheels) and [[cherubim]] (which have mosaic features);&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Alice. Of Wing and Wheels: A Synthetic Study of the Biblical Cherubim. pp. 2–4. {{ISBN|978-3-11-020528-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a matter of theology, they are spiritual beings who do not eat or excrete and are genderless. Many angels in art may appear to the modern eye to be gendered as either male or female by their dress or actions, but until the 19th century, even the most female looking will normally lack breasts, and the figures should normally be considered as genderless.&lt;ref&gt;"Because angels are purely spiritual creatures without bodies, there is no sexual difference between them. There are no male or female angels; they are not distinguished by gender.", p. 10, "Catholic Questions, Wise Answers", Ed. Michael J. Daley, St. Anthony Messenger Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0867163984}}, 9780867163988. See also [https://www.catholic.com/qa/can-angels-be-male-or-female Catholic Answers], which gives the standard, unchanged, Catholic position.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 19th-century art, especially [[funerary art]], this traditional convention is sometimes abandoned.

The earliest known Christian image of an angel, in the ''Cubicolo dell'Annunziazione'' in the [[Catacomb of Priscilla]], which is dated to the middle of the third century, is a depiction of the Annunciation in which Gabriel is portrayed without wings. Representations of angels on [[sarcophagi]] and on objects such as lamps and [[reliquaries]] of that period also show them without wings,&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007), pp. 81-89; cf. review in ''[[La Civiltà Cattolica]]'', 3795-3796 (2–16 August 2008), pp. 327-328.&lt;/ref&gt; as for example the angel in the ''[[Sacrifice of Isaac]]'' scene in the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]].

In a third-century fresco of the Hebrew children in the furnace, in the cemetery of St. Priscilla, a dove takes the place of the angel, while a fourth-century representation of the same subject, in the coemeterium majus, substitutes the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] for the heavenly messenger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01485a.htm Hassett, Maurice. "Early Christian Representations of Angels." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 25 Dec. 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known representation of angels with wings is on what is called the Prince's Sarcophagus, discovered at Sarigüzel, near [[Istanbul]], in the 1930s, and attributed to the time of [[Theodosius I]] (379-395).&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;  Flying winged angels, very often in pairs flanking a central figure or subject, are derivations in visual terms from pairs of [[Victoria (mythology)|winged Victories]] in classical art.&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt;

In this same period, Saint [[John Chrysostom]] explained the significance of angels' wings: "They manifest a nature's sublimity. That is why Gabriel is represented with wings. Not that angels have wings, but that you may know that they leave the heights and the most elevated dwelling to approach human nature. Accordingly, the wings attributed to these powers have no other meaning than to indicate the sublimity of their nature."&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

From then on Christian art generally represented angels with wings, as in the cycle of mosaics in the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]] (432-440).&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007), pp. 90-95; cf. review in ''[[La Civiltà Cattolica]]'', 3795-3796 (2–16 August 2008), pp. 327-328.&lt;/ref&gt;  Multi-winged angels, often with only their face and wings showing, drawn from the higher grades of angels, especially [[cherubim]] and [[seraphim]], are derived from Persian art, and are usually shown only in heavenly contexts, as opposed to performing tasks on earth.  They often appear in the [[pendentive]]s of [[dome]]s or [[semi-dome]]s of churches.

===Byzantine art===
[[File:Erzengel Michael und Gabriel.jpg|thumb|12th century [[icon]] of the Archangels [[Michael (angel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]] wearing the ''[[loros]]'' of the Imperial guards.]]

Angels appear in Byzantine art in mosaics and icons. Artists found some of their inspiration from winged Greek figures such as "Victory". They also drew from imperial iconography. Court eunuchs could rise to positions of authority in the Empire. They performed ceremonial functions and served as trusted messengers. Amelia R. Brown points out that legislation under Justinian indicates that many of them came from the Caucasus, having light eyes, hair, and skin, as well as the "comely features and fine bodies" desired by slave traders.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;  Those "castrated in childhood developed a distinctive skeletal structure, lacked full masculine musculature, body hair and beards,...." As officials, they would wear a white tunic decorated with gold. Brown suggests that  "Byzantine artists drew, consciously or not, on this iconography of the court eunuch".&lt;ref name=brown&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1053017/Painting_the_Bodiless_Angels_and_Eunuchs_in_Byzantine_Art_and_Culture Brown, Amelia R., "Painting the Bodiless: Angels and Eunuchs in Byzantine Art and Culture", University of Queensland (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel 10: 5-6 describes an angel as clothed in linen and girt with gold.&lt;ref name=longhurst/&gt; Angels, especially the archangel Michael, who were depicted as military-style agents of God, came to be shown wearing [[Late Antique]] military uniform.  This could be either the normal military dress, with a tunic to about the knees, armour breastplate and [[pteruges]], but also often the specific dress of the bodyguard of the [[Byzantine Emperor]], with a long tunic and the ''[[loros]]'', a long gold and jewelled  [[pallium]] restricted to the Imperial family and their closest guards, and in icons to archangels.  The basic military dress it is still worn in pictures into the [[Baroque]] period and beyond in the West, and up to the present day in [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon]]s. Other angels came to be conventionally depicted in long robes.

===Medieval art===
Medieval depictions of angels borrow from the Byzantine. In the French ''Hours of Anne of Brittany'', Gabriel wears a dalmatic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9QQFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA54 Andre, J. Lewis. "The Icons and Emblems of the Holy Angels", ''The Belfry: Quarterly Papers on Art, History and Archaeology'', No. III, Burns &amp; Oates, London, October 1876,]&lt;/ref&gt; In the later Middle Ages they often wear the vestments of a [[deacon]], a [[cope]] over a [[dalmatic]], especially [[Gabriel]] in [[Annunciation]] scenes - for example ''[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|The Annunciation]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]]. This indicated that, for all their powers, they could not perform the [[Eucharist]], and were in this respect outranked by every priest, reinforcing the prestige of the clergy.  In [[Early Christian art]] white robes were almost invariably adopted, sometimes bound with the "golden girdle" of Revelation. During the mediæval period senior angels were often clad in every brilliant colour,&lt;ref name=vinycomb&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/lcr/fsca/fsca08.htm Vinycomb, John. ''Fictitious and Symbolic Creatures in Art'', p.30, Chapman and Hall, London(1909)]&lt;/ref&gt; while junior ranks wore white. Early Renaissance painters such as [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Fra Angelico]] painted angels with multi-colored wings.  Depictions of angels came to combine medieval notions of beauty with feminine ideals of grace and beauty, as in da Panicale's 1435 ''Baptism of Christ''.&lt;ref name=gorgievski/&gt;

===Renaissance art===
[[File:ANGELICO, Fra Annunciation, 1437-46 (2236990916).jpg|thumb|left|Fra Angelico, The Annunciation, 1437-46]]
The classical ''[[erotes]]'' or ''[[putto]]'' re-appeared in art during the [[Italian Renaissance]] in both religious and mythological art, and is often known in English as a [[cherub]], the singular of cherubim, actually one of the higher ranks in the [[Christian angelic hierarchy]].  They normally appear in groups and are generally given wings in religious art, and are sometimes represented as just a winged head.  They generally are just in attendance, except that they may be amusing Christ or [[John the Baptist]] as infants in scenes of the [[Holy Family]].

===Victorian art===
In the late 19th century artists' model [[Jane Morris|Jane Burden Morris]] came to embody an ideal of beauty for [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painters. With the use of her long dark hair and features made somewhat more androgynous, they created a prototype Victorian angel which would appear in paintings and stained glass windows. Roger Homan notes that [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and others used her image often and in different ways, creating a new type of angel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialaffairsunit.org.uk/blog/archives/000614.php Homan, Roger. "Jane Burden: How a Pre-Raphaelite model changed our image of angels", ''The Social Affairs Unit'', 14 October 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Islamic art ==
According to Islamic teaching, angels are made of light, are beautiful, and have wings; although the shape and form of the wings are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iris.org.nz/angels.php Islamic Resource &amp; Information Service (IRIS), New Zealand] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410081112/http://www.iris.org.nz/angels.php |date=10 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Islamic art]] angels mainly appear mainly in narrative scenes in miniature painting, in the [[Persian miniature|Persian]] [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] and [[Ottoman miniature|Ottoman]] traditions.  They are especially common in illustrations of the Prophet's [[Mi'raj]], one of the occasions where their presence is mentioned in the [[Quran]].  Their appearance generally draws more from the [[iconography]] of pre-Islamic Persia, and [[Buddhist art]], than from angels in Christian art. Some of the earliest [[Ilkhanid]] examples are exceptions to this.  They have wings, often multi-coloured,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/angels-fly-on-high-multicolored-wings.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=27524&amp;NewsCatID=438 Gamm, Niki. Angels fly on high multicolored wings", ''Hurriyit Daily News'' Istanbul, Turkey, 11 August 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; and very often floating scarves drawing from Chinese Buddhist art. They are not very common however; many appear in illustrations to biographical accounts of the life of the Prophet [[Muhammad]], which are themselves rare.  There are a few studies of angels by themselves, especially from [[Safavid]] Persia.

In Islamic holy book, God rejects the depictions of angel as female in several verses of [[Quran]],&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Maulana Muhammad. ''The Holy Qur'an''. [[wikisource:The Holy Qur'an (Maulana Muhammad Ali)/37. Those Ranging in Ranks|chapter 37:149-150]].&lt;/ref&gt; and He will question those who make the depiction.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Maulana Muhammad. ''The Holy Qur'an''.  [[wikisource:The Holy Qur'an (Maulana Muhammad Ali)/43. Gold|chapter 43:19-20]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle''' (20 August 1517{{snd}}21 September 1586), Comte de La Baume Saint Amour, was a Burgundian statesman, made a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], who followed his father as a leading minister of the Spanish [[Habsburg]]s, and was one of the most influential European politicians during the time which immediately followed the appearance of [[Protestantism]] in Europe; "the dominating Imperial statesman of the whole century".&lt;ref name="Trevor-Roper, Hugh 1976, p.112"&gt;Trevor-Roper, Hugh; ''Princes and Artists, Patronage and Ideology at Four Habsburg Courts 1517–1633'', Thames &amp; Hudson, London, 1976, p.112&lt;/ref&gt;
He was also a notable [[art collector]], the "greatest private collector of his time, the friend and patron of Titian and Leoni and many other artists".&lt;ref name="Trevor-Roper, Hugh 1976, p.112"/&gt;

==Biography==
He was born in the Free Imperial City of [[Ornans]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06727a.htm Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle], ''Catholic Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; now in France, then a self-governing city surrounded by the Imperial territory of the [[Franche-Comté]]. &lt;!-- what??: Due to politics, his birth was recorded 4 days after birth in Besançon. --&gt; His father, [[Nicholas Perrenot de Granvelle]] (1484–1550), afterwards became chancellor of the empire under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], held an influential position in the Netherlands, and from 1530 until his death he was one of the emperor's most trusted advisers in Germany. On the completion of his studies in law at [[Padua]] and in divinity at [[Leuven]], Antoine held a canonry at [[Besançon]] in eastern France, then was promoted to the [[bishopric of Arras]] with a dispensation due to his age of barely twenty-three (1540).&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Granvella, Antoine Perrenot, Cardinal de|volume=12|pages=361–362}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was ordained into the priesthood in 1540.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In his episcopal capacity he attended several diets of the empire, as well as the opening meetings of the [[Council of Trent]], which he addressed on behalf of Charles V. The influence of his father, now chancellor, led to Granvelle being entrusted with many difficult and delicate pieces of public business. In the execution of these tasks he developed a talent for diplomacy, while at the same time acquiring an intimate acquaintance with most of the currents of European politics. He was involved in the settlement of the terms of peace after the defeat of the [[Schmalkaldic League]] at the [[Battle of Mühlberg]] in 1547, a settlement in which, to say the least, some particularly sharp practice was exhibited. In 1550, he succeeded his father in the office of secretary of state; in this capacity he attended Charles in the war with [[Maurice of Saxony]], accompanied him in the flight from [[Innsbruck]], and afterwards drew up the [[Peace of Passau]] (August 1552).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In the following year he and [[Simon Renard]], the ambassador of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] to the Queen [[Mary I of England]], conducted the negotiations for the marriage of [[Mary I of England|Mary]] and [[Philip II of Spain]]. It was to Philip in 1555, on the abdication of the emperor, that Granvelle transferred his services, and by whom he was employed in the Netherlands. In April 1559 Granvelle was one of the Spanish commissioners who arranged the [[Peace of Cateau Cambrésis]], and on Philip's withdrawal from the Netherlands in August of the same year he was  surreptitiously appointed chief councillor to the regent [[Margaret of Parma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rise of the Dutch Republic: A History Vol. 1|last=Motley|first=John|publisher=Harper and Brothers|year=|isbn=|location=New York, New York|publication-date=1883|pages=202, 208–210|quote=|orig-year=Original release 1855|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy of repression which in this capacity he pursued during the next five years secured for him many tangible rewards: in 1560 he was elevated to the archepiscopal see of [[Mechelen]], and in 1561 he became a cardinal; but the growing hostility of a people whose religious convictions he had set himself to oppose ultimately made it impossible for him to continue in the Netherlands; and on the advice of his royal master he retired to [[Franche-Comté]] in March 1564.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

After a visit to Rome in 1565; in November 1566 he was appointed as member of the Congregation of "Principi", the centre of the [[Papal States]]' foreign policy, by Pope [[Pius V]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Enciclopedia dei Papi|last = |first = |publisher = Istituto dell'Enciclopedia italiana - Treccani|year = 2000|isbn = |location = Rome|pages = |url = http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/santo-pio-v_(Enciclopedia_dei_Papi)/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1570, Granvelle, at the request of Philip, helped to arrange the alliance between the Papacy, Venice and Spain against the Turks, an alliance which was responsible for the victory of [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Lepanto]] the next year. In the same year he became viceroy of [[Naples]], a post of some difficulty and danger, which for five years he occupied with ability and success. He was summoned to [[Madrid]] in 1575 by Philip II to be president of the council for Italian affairs. Among the more delicate negotiations of his later years were those of 1580, which had for their object the ultimate union of the crowns of Spain and Portugal, and those of 1584, which resulted in a check to France by the marriage of the Spanish infanta Catherine to [[Charles Emmanuel I of Savoy]]. In the same year he was made [[archbishop of Besançon]], but meanwhile he had been stricken with a lingering disease; he was never enthroned, but died at Madrid in 1586. His body was taken to [[Besançon Cathedral]], where his father had been buried. His tomb  is in [[St. Rumbold's Cathedral|Mechelen cathedral]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Collector of art==
Granvelle had a famous art collection, which partly featured the favourite artists of his Habsburg patrons, such as [[Titian]] and [[Leone Leoni]], but also included a number of works by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Brueghel]], as well as a significant collection inherited from his father.  Brueghel's friend, the sculptor [[Jacques Jonghelinck]] (brother of Brueghel's biggest patron) had a studio in Granvelle's palace in Brussels.   Whilst in the Netherlands, he "discovered" [[Antonis Mor]] and introduced him to the Madrid court, and he also patronised [[Giambologna]] and arranged his first visit to Italy.  At his death the collection was inherited by his nephew, who was pressured by [[Rudolf II]], the very acquisitive Austrian Habsburg Emperor, to sell the finest pieces to him, which in 1597 he very reluctantly did, protesting that the price offered for thirty-three works was not enough even for six, and less than he had recently refused from Cardinal [[Alessandro Farnese (cardinal)|Farnese]] for [[Dürer]]'s ''Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand'' alone.  The arrangements were handled by [[Hans von Aachen]].  Most of these pieces are now in Vienna or Madrid, including Titian's ''Venus with an Organ-player'', [[Giambologna]]'s copy of the [[equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius]], tapestries after [[cartoon]]s by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] and a bust of Charles V by Leoni.&lt;ref name="Trevor-Roper, Hugh 1976, p.112"/&gt;

Though he was painted by Titian&lt;ref&gt;The portrait is at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City.&lt;/ref&gt; and Mor, more famous than any portrait of Granvelle himself is the portrait of his dwarf and his mastiff by Mor, now at the [[Musée du Louvre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=obj_view_obj&amp;objet=cartel_8163_10811_p0005735.001.jpg_obj.html&amp;flag=true Louvre On-line Catalog]&lt;/ref&gt; which perhaps initiated the Spanish tradition of portraits of court dwarfs. The Flemish [[Renaissance humanist]] [[Justus Lipsius]] was Granvelle's secretary for a period in Rome. He also corresponded with the composers [[Lassus]] and [[Adrian Willaert]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 3128706|title = Polyphony in the Low Countries|journal = Early Music|volume = 26|issue = 3|pages = 487–488|last1 = Fitch|first1 = Fabrice|year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He had a magnificent library, some of which remains at Besançon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccfr.bnf.fr/rnbcd_visu/FondetailServlet?num=894 Exposition des livres du cardinal de Granvelle à la Bibliothèque municipale de Besançon, Besançon, 1986: liste dactylographiée des ouvrages exposés.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061124181438/http://ccfr.bnf.fr/rnbcd_visu/FondetailServlet?num=894 |date=24 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''bicoid 3'-UTR regulatory element''' is an [[mRNA]] [[regulatory element]] that controls the [[gene expression]] of the bicoid protein in fruitfly ''[[Drosophila Melanogaster]]''.

The structured RNA element consists of four domains (denoted as II, III, IV and V) in the [[3'UTR]] of the [[mRNA]].  It is essential for the correct transport and localisation of [[bicoid]] [[mRNA]] during [[oocyte]] and embryo [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]], which has been studied most thoroughly in the [[developmental biology|development]] of ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' (fruitfly) [[larva]]e.&lt;ref name="pmid3143913"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Macdonald PM, Struhl G |title=cis-acting sequences responsible for anterior localization of bicoid mRNA in Drosophila embryos. |journal=Nature |volume=336 |issue=6199 |pages=595–8 |year=1988 |pmid=3143913 |doi=10.1038/336595a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid2081457"&gt;{{cite journal |author=MacDonald PM |title=bicoid mRNA localization signal: phylogenetic conservation of function and RNA secondary structure. |journal=Development |volume=110 |issue=1 |pages=161–71 |year=1990 |pmid=2081457}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1975239"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Seeger MA, Kaufman TC |title=Molecular analysis of the bicoid gene from Drosophila pseudoobscura: identification of conserved domains within coding and noncoding regions of the bicoid mRNA. |journal=EMBO J |volume=9 |issue=9 |pages=2977–87 |year=1990 |pmid=1975239 |pmc=552015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ehresmann C | first = C | year = 2004 | title = Secondary structure of the 3' UTR of bicoid mRNA | journal = Biochimie | volume = 86 | pages = 91–104 | doi = 10.1016/j.biochi.2004.01.002 | pmid = 15016447 | last2 = Ehresmann | first2 = C | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Template mediated crystallization is qualitatively different from ''[[in vitro]]'' crystallization. [[Enzyme inhibitor|Inhibitor]]s of biocrystallization are of interest in [[drug design]] efforts against [[lithiasis]] and against [[pathogen]]s that feed on [[blood]], since many of these organisms use this process to safely dispose of [[heme]].

==DNA==
Under severe stress conditions the [[bacteria]] ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' protects its [[DNA]] from damage by sequestering it within a crystalline structure.&lt;ref name="pmid10403254"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wolf SG, Frenkiel D, Arad T, Finkel SE, Kolter R, Minsky A |title=DNA protection by stress-induced biocrystallization |journal=Nature |volume=400 |issue=6739 |pages=83–5 |date=July 1999 |pmid=10403254 |doi=10.1038/21918 |bibcode=1999Natur.400...83W}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is mediated by the stress response protein Dps and allows the bacteria to survive varied assaults such as [[oxidative stress]], [[heat shock]], [[ultraviolet light]], [[gamma radiation]] and extremes of [[pH]].&lt;ref name="pmid15205421"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nair S, Finkel SE |title=Dps Protects Cells against Multiple Stresses during Stationary Phase |journal=J.

==Heme==
[[Image:Chloroquine 3D.png|thumb| right|The biocrystallization inhibitor [[chloroquine]] was developed in Germany in the 1930s. For 20 years Chloroquine was a "magic bullet".]]
[[Blood]] feeding organisms digest [[hemoglobin]]  and release high quantities of free toxic [[heme]]. To avoid destruction by this molecule, the parasite biocrystallizes  heme to form  [[hemozoin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hempelmann E, Marques HM |title=Analysis of malaria pigment from Plasmodium falciparum|journal=J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages= 25–30|date=September 1994 |pmid=7833503 |doi= 10.1016/1056-8719(94)90013-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the only definitively characterized product of hematin disposal is the pigment hemozoin. Hemozoin is ''per definitionem'' not a [[mineral]] and therefore not formed by [[biomineralization]]. Heme biocrystallization has been found in blood feeding organisms of great medical importance including ''[[Plasmodium]]'', ''[[Rhodnius]]'' and ''[[Schistosoma]]''. Heme biocrystallization is inhibited by [[quinoline]] [[Antimalarial drug|antimalarials]] such as [[chloroquine]].

Targeting [[heme]]  biocrystallization remains one of the most promising avenues for antimalarial drug development because the drug target is highly specific to the malarial parasite, and outside the [[Genetics|genetic]] control of the [[parasite]].

==Lithiasis==
[[Lithiasis]] (formation of stones) is a global human health problem.  Stones can form in both urinary and gastrointestinal tracts.  Related to the formation of stones is the formation of crystals;  this can occur in joints (e.g. [[gout]]) and in the viscera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Porena M, Guiggi P, Micheli C |title=Prevention of stone disease|journal=Urol.

In the arts, '''bricolage''' ([[French language|French]] for "[[DIY]]" or "do-it-yourself projects") is the construction or creation of a work from a diverse range of things that happen to be available, or a work created by mixed media.

The term ''bricolage'' has also been used in many other fields, including [[anthropology]], philosophy, critical theory, education, computer software, and business.

==Origin==
''Bricolage'' is a French [[loanword]] that means the process of [[improvisation]] in a human endeavor. The word is derived from the French verb ''bricoler'' ("to tinker"), with the English term [[DIY]] ("Do-it-yourself") being the closest equivalent of the contemporary French usage. In both languages, ''bricolage'' also denotes any works or products of DIY endeavors.&lt;ref name=Baldick&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms |last= Baldick |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Baldick |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford; New York |isbn= 9780199208272 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=dictionary%20of&amp;pg=PA42 |accessdate=29 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Broady&gt;{{Cite book |title=Colloquial French 2: The Next step in Language Learning |last=Broady |first=Elspeth |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0-415-26647-5 |page=77 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JM2AAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The arts==

===Music===
Instrumental bricolage in music includes the use of [[found object]]s as instruments, such as:

*[[Spoon (musical instrument)|Spoons]]
*[[Musical saw]]
*Australasian [[Slapping (music)|slap bass]] made from a [[tea chest]]
*Comb and wax paper for [[humming]] through
*[[eucalyptus|Gumleaf]] humming
*[[Lagerphone]] (made from a stick and bottle tops)
*[[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidadian]] [[steelpan|steel drums]] (made from [[drum (container)|industrial storage drums]])
*[[African drums]] and [[thumb piano]]s made from recycled pots and pans.
*American super instruments made from recorders and bicycle bells or metal rods and keys
*[[Stomp (dance troupe)|Stomp dancing]] is an example of the use of bricolage in music and dance, utilizing everyday objects, such as trash cans and broom sticks, to produce music.
*Many of the musical instruments created by American composer [[Harry Partch]] utilize unusual items, such as automotive [[hubcap]]s and [[pyrex]] [[carboy]]s.

Stylistic bricolage is the inclusion of common musical devices with new uses.  Shuker writes, "Punk best emphasized such stylistic bricolage".&lt;ref&gt;Shuker ''Popular Music: Key Concepts'' 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Musical bricolage flourishes in music of sub-cultures where: 
*experimentation is part of daily life (pioneers, immigrants, artistic communities),
*access to resources is limited (such as in remote, discriminated or financially disconnected sub-cultures) which limits commercial influence (e.g. acoustic performers, ghetto music, hippie, folk or traditional musicians), and
*there is a political or social drive to seek individuality (e.g. rap music, peace-drives, drummers' circles)

Unlike other bricolage fields, the intimate knowledge of resources is not necessary. Many punk musicians, for instance, are not musically trained, because they believe training can discourage creativity in preference for accuracy. Also, careful observation and listening is not necessary, it is common in spontaneous music to welcome 'errors' and disharmony. Like other bricolage fields, bricolage music still values trusting one's ideas and self-correcting structures such as targeted audiences.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Visual art===
In art, bricolage is a technique or creative mode, where works are constructed from various materials available or on hand, and is seen as a characteristic of many [[postmodern]] works.

These materials may be [[mass-produced]] or "junk". See also: [[Kurt Schwitters|Merz]], [[polystylism]], [[collage]], [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]].

Bricolage can also be applied to [[Improvisational theatre|theatrical forms of improvisation]], where the main strategy is to use the environment and materials at hand. The environment is the stage and the materials are often pantomimed. The use of the stage and the imaginary materials are all made up on the spot, so the materials which are at hand are actually things that the players know from past experiences (i.e. an improvisation of ordering fast food: One player would start with the common phrase "How may I help you?").

Bricolage is also applied in [[interior design]], through blending styles and accessorizing spaces with what is "on hand". Many designers use bricolage to come up with innovative and unique ideas.

===Architecture===
Bricolage is considered the jumbled effect produced by the close proximity of buildings from different periods and in different architectural styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/bricolage |title=bricolage - definition of bricolage by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a term that is admiringly applied to the architectural work of [[Le Corbusier]], by Colin Rowe and Fred Koetter in their book ''Collage City'', suggesting that he assembled ideas from found objects of the [[history of architecture]]. This, in contrast to someone like [[Mies Van der Rohe]], whom they called a "hedgehog", for being overly focused on a narrow concept.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Academics==

===Literature===
In literature, bricolage is affected by [[intertextuality]], the shaping of a text's meanings by reference to other texts.

===Cultural studies===
In [[cultural studies]] bricolage is used to mean the processes by which people acquire objects from across [[social division]]s to create new [[cultural identity|cultural identities]]. In particular, it is a feature of [[subculture]]s such as the [[Punk subculture|punk]] movement. Here, objects that possess one meaning (or no meaning) in the dominant culture are acquired and given a new, often subversive meaning. For example, the [[safety pin]] became a form of decoration in punk culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hebdige, Dick. ''Subculture: the Meaning of Style.'' London: Routledge, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social psychology&lt;!--linked from 'Claude Lévi-Strauss'--&gt;===
The term "psychological bricolage" is used to explain the mental processes through which an individual develops novel solutions to problems by making use of previously unrelated knowledge or ideas they already possess. 
The term, introduced by Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks, Matthew J. Karlesky and Fiona Lee&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez-Burks, J., Karlesky, M., &amp; Lee, F. (in press). Psychological Bricolage and the Creative Process. In C. Shalley, M. Hitt, and J. Zhou (Eds.), Oxford Handbook of Creativity, Innovation and Entrepreneurship.&lt;/ref&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOEwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=oxford+creativity+bricolage&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9YO2B5AYJD&amp;sig=fUzbuH-bEH_OB4D3iaqMu-DbRjk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J3MgVbe9KcjosAXC1oGABw&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=oxford%20creativity%20bricolage&amp;f=false] of the [[University of Michigan]], draws from two separate disciplines.  The first, “social bricolage,” was introduced by cultural anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] in 1962. Lévi-Strauss was interested in how societies create novel solutions by using resources that already exist in the collective social consciousness. The second, "creative cognition,” is an intra-psychic approach to studying how individuals retrieve and recombine knowledge in new ways.  Psychological bricolage, therefore, refers to the cognitive processes that enable individuals to retrieve and recombine previously unrelated knowledge they already possess.&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez-Burks, J., Karlesky, M., &amp; Lee, F. "Psychological Bricolage, Integrating social identities to produce creative solutions."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Shalley, M. Hitt, &amp; J. Zhou. Oxford Handbook of Creativity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship.&lt;/ref&gt;  Psychological bricolage is an intra-individual process akin to [[Karl E. Weick]]’s notion of bricolage in organizations, which is akin to Lévi-Strauss' notion of bricolage in societies.&lt;ref name="organizational1"&gt;Karl Weick, "Organizational Redesign as Improvisation", reprinted in ''Making Sense of the Organization''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy===
In his book ''[[The Savage Mind]]'' (1962, English translation 1966), French anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] used  "bricolage" to describe the characteristic patterns of mythological thought. In his description it is opposed to the engineers' creative thinking, which proceeds from goals to means. Mythical thought, according to Lévi-Strauss, attempts to re-use available materials in order to solve new problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Claude |last=Lévi-Strauss |title=La Pensée sauvage |location=Paris |year=1962 }} English translation as ''The Savage Mind'' (Chicago, 1966). {{ISBN|0-226-47484-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tesugen.com/archives/03/08/bricolage |title=Bricolage [Tesugen&amp;#93; |publisher=Tesugen.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930035434/http://tesugen.com/archives/03/08/bricolage |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://varenne.tc.columbia.edu/bib/info/levstcld066savamind.html |title=Varenne: quotes from Lévi-Strauss (1963 [1962&amp;#93;) |publisher=Varenne.tc.columbia.edu |date=1999-05-11 |accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Derrida]] extends this notion to any discourse. "If one calls ''bricolage'' the necessity of borrowing one's concept from the text of a heritage which is more or less coherent or ruined, it must be said that every discourse is ''bricoleur''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jacques |last=Derrida |authorlink=Jacques Derrida |url=http://hydra.humanities.uci.edu/derrida/sign-play.html |title=Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences |publisher=Hydra.humanities.uci.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], in their 1972 book ''[[Anti-Œdipus|Anti-Oedipus]]'', identify ''bricolage'' as the characteristic [[mode of production]] of the schizophrenic producer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], ''[[Anti-Œdipus|Anti-Oedipus]]: Capitalism and Schizophrenia''. Trans. Robert Hurley, Mark Seem, and Helen R. Lane. Continuum edition. London: Continuum, 2004 (1972). p.7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
In the discussion of [[Constructionism_(learning_theory)|constructionism]], [[Seymour Papert]] discusses two styles of solving problems. Contrary to the analytical style of solving problems, he describes bricolage as a way to learn and solve problems by trying, testing, playing around.

[[Joe L. Kincheloe]] and [[Shirley R. Steinberg]] have used the term bricolage in educational research to denote the use of multiperspectival research methods. In Kincheloe's conception of the research bricolage, diverse theoretical traditions are employed in a broader critical theoretical/critical pedagogical context to lay the foundation for a transformative mode of multimethodological inquiry. Using these multiple frameworks and methodologies, researchers are empowered to produce more rigorous and praxiological insights into socio-political and educational phenomena.

Kincheloe and Steinberg theorize a critical multilogical epistemology and critical connected ontology to ground the research bricolage. These philosophical notions provide the research bricolage with a sophisticated understanding of the complexity of knowledge production and the interrelated complexity of both researcher positionality and phenomena in the world. Such complexity demands a more rigorous mode of research that is capable of dealing with the complications of socio-educational experience. Such a critical form of rigor avoids the reductionism of many monological, mimetic research orientations (see Kincheloe, 2001, 2005; Kincheloe &amp; Berry, 2004; Steinberg, 2015; Kincheloe, McLaren, &amp; Steinberg, 2012).

==Information technology==

===Information systems===
In [[information systems]], bricolage is used by [[Claudio Ciborra]] to describe the way in which [[strategic information system]]s (SIS) can be built in order to maintain successful [[competitive advantage]] over a longer period of time than standard SIS. By valuing tinkering and allowing SIS to evolve from the bottom-up, rather than implementing it from the top-down, the firm will end up with something that is deeply rooted in the [[organisational culture]] that is specific to that firm and is much less easily imitated.&lt;ref&gt;Ciborra, Claudio (1992). "From Thinking to Tinkering: The Grassroots of Strategic Information Systems", ''The Information Society'' 8, 297–309&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
In her book ''[[Life on the Screen]]'' (1995), [[Sherry Turkle]] discusses the concept of bricolage as it applies to problem solving in code projects and workspace productivity.  She advocates the "bricoleur style" of programming as a valid and underexamined alternative to what she describes as the conventional structured "planner" approach.  In this style of coding, the programmer works without an exhaustive preliminary specification, opting instead for a step-by-step growth and re-evaluation process.  In her essay "Epistemological Pluralism", Turkle writes: "The bricoleur resembles the painter who stands back between brushstrokes, looks at the canvas, and only after this contemplation, decides what to do next."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Turkle |first=Sherry |url=http://www.papert.org/articles/EpistemologicalPluralism.html |title=Epistemological Pluralism |publisher=Papert.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual arts==
The visual arts is a field in which individuals often integrate a variety of knowledge sets in order to produce inventive work. To reach this stage, artists read print materials across a wide array of disciplines, as well as information from their own social identities.&lt;ref&gt;Cobbledick, Susie. "Information-Seeking Behavior of Artists: Exploratory Interviews."&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the artist [[Shirin Neshat]] has integrated her identities as an Iranian exile and a woman in order to make complex, creative and critical bodies of work.&lt;ref&gt;2010 TED Talk, "Shirin Neshat: Art in Exile."&lt;/ref&gt; This willingness to integrate diverse knowledge sets enables artists with multiple identities to fully leverage their knowledge sets. This is demonstrated by Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks, Chi-Ying Chen and Fiona Lee, who found that individuals were shown to exhibit greater levels of innovation in tasks related to their cultural identities when they successfully integrated those identities.&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez-Burks, J., Cheng, C. &amp; Lee, F. "Increasing Innovation Through Identity Integration."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
[[Karl Weick]] identifies the following requirements for successful bricolage in organizations.&lt;ref name="organizational1"/&gt;
 
*Intimate knowledge of resources
*Careful observation and listening
*Trusting one's ideas
*Self-correcting structures, with feedback

Nasim Nicholas Taleb mentions it in his book ''[[Antifragile]]''.

==In popular culture==

===Fashion===
In his essay "Subculture: The Meaning of Style", [[Dick Hebdige]] discusses how an individual can be identified as a bricoleur when they "appropriated another range of commodities by placing them in a symbolic ensemble which served to erase or subvert their original straight meanings".&lt;ref&gt;"Subculture: The Meaning of Style". Dick Hebdige. In ''Cultural Studies: An Anthology''. Ed. Michael Ryan. 2008. p. 592&lt;/ref&gt; The fashion industry uses bricolage-like styles by incorporating items typically utilized for other purposes. For example, candy wrappers are woven together to produce a purse. The movie ''[[Zoolander]]'' parodies this concept with "Derelicte", a line of clothing made from trash.

===Television===
* ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'' is a television series in which the protagonist is the paragon of a bricoleur,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ian |last=Bogost |title=Comparative Video Game Criticism |url=http://gac.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/1/1/41 |work= [[Games and Culture]] |volume= 1, No. 1 |pages=41–46 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating solutions for the problem to be solved out of immediately available found objects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17543">'''Building services engineering''' is a [[Regulation and licensure in engineering|professional engineering]] discipline that strives to achieve a safe and comfortable [[Indoor air quality|indoor environment]] whilst minimizing the [[environmental impact]] of a [[building]].

'''Alternative titles''': The term ''Building services engineering'' is also commonly known as ''Architectural engineering'', ''Technical building services'', ''Building engineering'', or ''Facilities and services planning engineering''. The term ''Building services engineering'' is widely used in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries (incl. [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]]), but in the [[United States of America]], the field is also known as ''Building systems engineering'', ''[[Architectural engineering]]'' or ''[[Building engineering]]'', though the latter two disciplines generally have a broader scope, also encompassing elements of [[Structural engineering]] and more traditional architectural tasks such as room planning and material selection. In India the engineers are known as ''facilities planners''. In some counties, a ''building services architect'' is an engineer with experience in the integration of building services.

==Scope==
Building services engineers are responsible for the design, installation, operation and monitoring of the technical services in buildings (including [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]] and [[public health system]]s, also known as [[Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|MEP]] or [[HVAC]]), in order to ensure the safe, comfortable and [[environmentally friendly]] operation. Building services [[engineer]]s work closely with other construction professionals such as architects, structural engineers and quantity surveyors. Building services engineers influence the architectural design of building, in particular facades, in relation to [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and indoor environment, and can integrate local energy production (e.g. façade-integrated [[photovoltaics]]) or community-scale energy facilities (e.g. [[district heating]]). Building services engineers therefore play an important role in the design and operation of energy-efficient buildings (including [[green building]]s, [[passive house]]s, and [[Energy-plus-house|Plus-houses]], and [[Zero-energy building]]s). With buildings accounting for about a third of all carbon emissions&lt;ref&gt;https://webstore.iea.org/technology-roadmap-energy-efficient-buildings-heating-and-cooling-equipment&lt;/ref&gt; and over a half of the global electricity demand,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iea.org/buildings/&lt;/ref&gt; building services engineers play an important role in the move to a [[Low-carbon economy|low-carbon society]], hence mitigate [[global warming]].

The career path of a building services engineer can take a very wide range of directions. Within the broad field of building services engineering, new roles are emerging, for example specialization in [[renewable energy]], [[sustainability]], low-carbon technologies, energy management, [[building automation]], and [[Building information modeling|building information modeling (BIM)]]. Building services engineers increasingly seek status as accredited [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), [[BREEAM]] (BRE Environmental Assessment Method), or CIBSE Low Carbon Consultants (LCC) and Energy Assessors (LCEA) auditors, in addition to their status as [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|chartered]]/[[European Engineer|professional engineer]].

Building services engineering encompasses much more than just [[Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|MEP]] or [[HVAC]]), but also the following:
* '''Mechanical''' services:
** [[Energy]] supply – [[gas]], [[electricity]] and [[renewable energy|renewable]] sources
** [[Escalators]] and [[Elevator|lifts]]
** [[Heating]] including low-exergy (low-temperature) solutions
** [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]]. This includes clean-room solutions (e.g. hospitals, labs) and industrial ventilation (factory spaces and processes)
** [[Air conditioning]] and other applications of [[refrigeration]]
* '''Electrical''' services:
** [[Low voltage]] (LV) systems, [[distribution board]]s and [[switchgear]]
** Communication lines, telephones and IT networks ([[Information and communications technology|ICT]])
** [[Building automation]]
** [[Lightning]] protection
** [[Fire]] detection and protection
** [[Security]] and [[alarm]] systems
* '''Public health''' services:
** [[Plumbing]] solutions for [[water]] supply, both potable cold water and DHW (domestic hot water), 
** [[Drainage]] of waste water (sewage) from inside a building and drainage/treatment of external surface runoff around a building. Increasing use of grey-water recycling and solutions to delay runoff (e.g. green roofs and infiltration beds)
** Solutions for [[hygiene]] and [[sanitation]], including [[cleaning]], [[indoor air quality]], and health technology (e.g. isolation wards)
* '''Other''':
** Building-integrated features such as [[passive cooling]]
** [[Natural lighting]] and [[artificial lighting]], and building [[facades]]
** [[Building engineering physics|Building physics]], especially related to heat and moisture transfer, daylighting etc.

Examples of roles/duties a Building Services Engineer may have include:
* '''[[Consultant]] engineer''': Designing layouts and requirements for building services for residential or commercial developments. Design management is the business side of design, which aims to create the right environment to control and support a culture of creativity and innovation, and to embrace the iterative nature of design involving the many disciplines that, collectively, will deliver design solutions – and all at the same time as ensuring that an organisation’s commercial goals and objectives are achieved and that all is done in an ethically sound way. Typically the building services engineering installation is worth 30–60% of the total value of a contract. Design management is not the same as project management. Project management focuses on a wider range of administrative skills but is not normally sympathetic to the peculiarities of delivering a fully coordinated functioning design, taking into account its unique nature and dealing with the changing requirements of clients and the external factors over which there is little control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Portman|first=Jackie|title=Building Services Design Management|date=July 2014|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Oxford:UK|isbn=978-1118528129}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[General contractor|Contractor]]''': Supervising the installation of the building services, commissioning systems. This includes tasks such as [[Testing, adjusting, balancing|TABS]].
* '''[[Facility management|Facilities manager]]''': Operation, servicing, and continuous commissioning of existing buildings and plant.

==Professional bodies==
The two most notable professional bodies are:
* The [[ASHRAE|American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers]] (ASHRAE) was founded in 1894.
* The [[Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers]] (CIBSE) was founded in 1976, and received a Royal Charter in the [[United Kingdom]], and formally recognising building services engineering as a profession. Its objectives of the Institution are to: ''support the Science, Art and Practice of building services engineering, by providing our members and the public with first class information and education services and promoting the spirit of fellowship which guides our work.''

==Education==
Building services engineers typically possess an academic degree in building services engineering, [[mechanical engineering]] or [[electrical engineering]]. The length of study for such a degree is usually 3–4 years for a [[Bachelor of Engineering]] (BEng) or [[Bachelor of Science]] (BSc) and 5–6 years for a [[Master of Engineering]] (MEng).

The list below includes accredited education programs. In the United Kingdom, the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers ([[Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers|CIBSE]]) accredits university degrees in Building Services Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cibse.org/membership/accredited-courses/list-of-accredited-courses&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, [[ABET]] accredits degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abet.org/AccredProgramSearch/AccreditationSearch.aspx Search All Accredited Programs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817205746/http://www.abet.org/AccredProgramSearch/AccreditationSearch.aspx |date=2011-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building services engineering software==
Many tasks in building services engineering involve the use of engineering software, for example to design/model or draw solutions. The most common types of tool are whole building energy simulation&lt;ref&gt;K. Mahmud, U. Amin, M.J. Hossain, J. Ravishankar, "Computational tools for design, analysis, and management of residential energy systems", Applied Energy, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.03.111&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] (traditionally 2D) or the increasingly popular [[Building Information Modeling]] (BIM) which is 3D. 3D BIM software can have integrated tools for Building Services calculations such sizing ventilation ducts or estimating noise levels. Another use of 3D/4D BIM is that empowers more informed decision making and better coordination between different disciplines, such as [[collision detection|'collision testing']].

{{Unreferenced|date=September 2015}}'''CandyGirls''' are a line of realistic [[sex doll]]s manufactured by Orient Industries in [[Japan]].

The dolls have a reputation for aesthetics (highly detailed, lifelike faces), potentially occupying a similar market niche as that of the premium American-made [[RealDoll]]s. (While the low-end product series of CandyGirl dolls, Petit Pure, are priced at $1,383, a high-end CandyGirl doll costs about $7,000; RealDolls start at around $6,000.)

The dolls are not sold directly to customers outside Japan, although it is possible to purchase them using intermediaries based in Japan ("shopping deputies").

'''Cellosaurus''' is an on-line knowledge resource on cell lines &lt;ref name=Bairoch2018&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bairoch Amos|title=The Cellosaurus, a cell-line knowledge resource |journal=Journal of Biomolecular Techniques |volume=29 |pages=1-14 |year=2018 |pmid=29805321 |doi=10.7171/jbt.18-2902-002 |issue=[Epub ahead of print |pmc=5945021}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is provided by the [[Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics]] (SIB) as one of its contribution &lt;ref&gt;https://www.elixir-europe.org/services/cellosaurus&lt;/ref&gt;{{fv|date=July 2018}} to [[ELIXIR]]. It is the contributing resource for cell lines on the Resource Identification Portal &lt;ref&gt;https://scicrunch.org/resources/Cell%20Lines/source/SCR_013869-1/search?q=%2A&amp;l=&lt;/ref&gt;.

Its scope includes [[immortalised cell line]]s, naturally immortal cell lines (example: [[embryonic stem cell]]s) and finite life cell lines when those are distributed and used widely.
The Cellosaurus provides a wealth of manually curated information;
for each cell line it lists a recommended name, synonyms and the species of origin. 
Other types of information include standardised disease terminology (for [[cancer]] or [[genetic disorder]] cell lines),
the transformant used to immortalise a cell line, transfected or knocked-out genes, microsatellite instability, doubling time, gender and age of donor (patient or animal), important sequence variations, web links, publication references and cross-references to more than 70 different databases, ontologies, cell collections and other relevant resources.

Since many cell lines used in research have been misidentified or [[Cell culture#Cell line cross-contamination|contaminated]],
the Cellosaurus keeps track of problematic cell lines, including all those listed in the
International Cell Line Authentication Committee (ICLAC) &lt;ref&gt;http://iclac.org/wp-content/uploads/Cross-Contaminations-v8_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; tables.

For human as well as some dog cell lines, it provides [[short tandem repeat]] (STR) profile information.

Since July 2018, all cell lines in the Cellosaurus are represented as items in [[Wikidata]].

It is developed by [[Amos Bairoch]] at the CALIPHO group &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sib.swiss/bairoch-amos-lane-lydie/amos-bairoch-lydie-lane-sub CALIPHO group], on the web site of the SIB&lt;/ref&gt;{{fv|date=July 2018}} of the [[Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics]] (SIB).

The '''Center for Applied Genomics''' is a Center of Emphasis at the [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]] with the primary goal of discovering and translating basic research findings into medical innovations.

The Center is one of the world’s largest genetics research and analytical facilities. It is the primary center at a pediatric hospital with access to state-of-the-art high-throughput genotyping technology, and has processed genetic samples from over 100,000 people.

The Center is focused on detecting the genetic causes of some of the most prevalent childhood diseases including (but not limited to) [[asthma]], [[obesity]], [[ADHD]], [[autism]], [[diabetes]], [[inflammatory bowel disease]], [[epilepsy]], [[schizophrenia]], and pediatric [[cancer]], all of which are thought to involve multiple, interacting genes within the body.

==Mission statement==

The mission of the Center for Applied Genomics is to develop new and better ways to diagnose and treat children affected by complex medical disorders. The Center is a specialized Center of Emphasis at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia with the primary goal of translating basic research findings to medical innovations.

We aim to discover genetic causes for the most prevalent diseases of childhood including asthma, autism, diabetes, epilepsy, obesity, schizophrenia, and pediatric cancer. Ultimately, our objective is to generate new diagnostic tests and to guide physicians to the most appropriate therapies.

The Center is one of the world's largest genetics research programs, and the lead center at a pediatric hospital to have large-scale access to state-of-the-art high-throughput genotyping technology.

===ADHD===
Although highly heritable, genetic correlates of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ([[ADHD]]) have been difficult to pinpoint. In 2009, Center for Applied Genomics researchers identified [[copy number variants]] as a potential cause of the disorder. CNVs are relatively large segments of chromosomes where the DNA has been deleted, duplicated, or rearranged. The group found 222 CNVs that were more common in individuals with ADHD than in unrelated healthy individuals. These CNVs tended to concentrate in areas that had previously been associated with other neurodevelopmental disorders including autism, schizophrenia and [[Tourette syndrome]]. They also tended to occur at or near genes known to be important for learning, synapse transmission, and nervous system development. This paper was one of the first to pinpoint CNVs as a genetic cause of ADHD and was important in identifying previously unassociated genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elia J, Gai X, Xie HM |title=Rare structural variants found in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder are preferentially associated with neurodevelopmental genes |journal=Molecular Psychiatry |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=637–46 |date=June 2010 |pmid=19546859 |pmc=2877197 |doi=10.1038/mp.2009.57|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asthma===
[[Asthma]] is a complex disease with genetic and environmental causes. It affects more than 6% of children in the developed world (Fanta, 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fanta CH |title=Asthma |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=360 |issue=10 |pages=1002–14 |date=March 2009 |pmid=19264689 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra0804579}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Because of its complexity, candidate genes for asthma have been difficult to determine. In 2010, the Center published a genome-wide association study of 3,377 children with asthma and 5,579 healthy children. This type of study allows researchers to examine genetic variations across an individual’s entire genome, and compare variations between affected and unaffected groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sleiman PM, Flory J, Imielinski M |title=Variants of DENND1B associated with asthma in children |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=362 |issue=1 |pages=36–44 |date=January 2010 |pmid=20032318 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0901867|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; They discovered a region on chromosome 17 and a previously unassociated region on chromosome 1 that strongly correlated with susceptibility to asthma. The region in chromosome 1 was especially associated with asthma in the children of African ancestry, and contains a gene, DENND1B, that is expressed by natural killer cells – a critical component of the immune system. Targeting the DENND1B gene may be a promising avenue for future treatments of asthma.

===Autism===
Although twin studies suggest that ASDs are highly heritable, specific genes have been difficult to identify. In 2009, the Center conducted a [[genome-wide association study]] on a group of 780 families (3,101 individuals) with affected children, a second group of 1,204 affected individuals, and 6,491 controls, all of whom had European ancestry. By comparing genomics variations between the groups, researchers led by Kai Wang identified six genetic markers between two specific genes that confirmed susceptibility to ASDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang K, Zhang H, Ma D |title=Common genetic variants on 5p14.1 associate with autism spectrum disorders |journal=Nature |volume=459 |issue=7246 |pages=528–33 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19404256 |pmc=2943511 |doi=10.1038/nature07999|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first study to demonstrate a genome-wide significant association of this kind. The two genes, [[cadherin]] 10 and [[cadherin]] 9 are sticky molecules that help neurons bind together. They play an important role in neurodevelopment, and may be important in helping us understand the neuropathology of autism.

In 2009, the Center published a second paper in the journal Nature that identified copy number variations (CNVs) as important genetic features in autism. Led by Joseph Glessner, the group examined 859 autism cases and 1,409 healthy children of European ancestry. The autism group had significantly more CNVs on or near genes that had previously been associated with the disorder. Further, they identified several new susceptibility genes in [[ubiquitin]] networks that were associated with the autism group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Glessner JT, Wang K, Cai G |title=Autism genome-wide copy number variation reveals ubiquitin and neuronal genes |journal=Nature |volume=459 |issue=7246 |pages=569–73 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19404257 |pmc=2925224 |doi=10.1038/nature07953|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ubiquitins are small proteins that help to destroy unneeded or damaged proteins. Damage to ubiquitin networks can theoretically cause neurological changes that may underlie autism and are an important avenue for future research into the disorder.

===Cancer===
The Center for Applied Genomics has been at the forefront of research into the genetic causes of a number of cancers and has had a major impact on our understanding of how cancer occurs.

[[Neuroblastoma]] is a type of cancer most commonly found in children that affects the sympathetic nervous system (part of the nervous system that helps control our organs). It is often lethal. In 2008, the Center group collaborated with the [http://stokes.chop.edu/programs/maris/ Maris Lab] at the Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania to publish the first of three important papers on the genetic causes of neuroblastoma. They performed a genome-wide association study comparing the genomes of 1032 patients and 2043 controls. The researchers found a significant association between neuroblastoma and a region of chromosome 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maris JM, Mosse YP, Bradfield JP |title=Chromosome 6p22 locus associated with clinically aggressive neuroblastoma |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=358 |issue=24 |pages=2585–93 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18463370 |pmc=2742373 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0708698|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Center followed-up this finding with another genome-wide association study that focused on a 397-person high-risk subset of the neuroblastoma group. They identified a region on chromosome 2 on or near the BARD1 gene, which has been found to regulate cell growth and tumor suppressants. These data show that a common variation in the BARD1 gene contributes to aggressive neuroblastoma – the most clinically important form of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Capasso M, Devoto M, Hou C |title=Common variations in BARD1 influence susceptibility to high-risk neuroblastoma |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=718–723 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19412175 |pmc=2753610 |doi=10.1038/ng.374|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Center contributed another study identifying copy number variations (CNVs) as a potential cause of neuroblastoma. CNVs are segments of DNA consisting of deleted, duplicated, or rearranged genetic material. They identified a CNV on chromosome 1 that associated with the disorder. It behaved similarly to a class of genes known as neuroblastoma breakpoint family (NBPF) genes and was thus implicated as a previously unknown member of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Diskin SJ, Hou C, Glessner JT |title=Copy number variation at 1q21.1 associated with neuroblastoma |journal=Nature |volume=459 |issue=7249 |pages=987–91 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19536264 |pmc=2755253 |doi=10.1038/nature08035|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was the first germline CNV study in any cancer.

[[Testicular cancer]] is the most common form of cancer in men between the ages of 15 and 34, but also peaks in infancy and old age. In 2009, in collaboration with the [http://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p9542 Nathanson Lab] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], the Center published the results of a genome-wide associated study that examined the genomes of 227 patients with testicular germ cell tumors and 919 controls. They identified an area on chromosome 5 as a major risk factor for the disease, which was in the region of a gene called [[SPRY4]]. A specific copy of this gene is associated with a 40% greater chance of testicular cancer. Even more strikingly, they identified a region in chromosome 12 within a gene called KITLG. Patients with a specific form of the KITLG gene were much more likely to have testicular cancer – each copy of the gene-form increased risk of testicular cancer threefold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kanetsky PA, Mitra N, Vardhanabhuti S |title=Common variation in KITLG and at 5q31.3 predisposes to testicular germ cell cancer |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=41 |issue=7 |pages=811–5 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19483682 |pmc=2865677 |doi=10.1038/ng.393|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represents one of the largest effect sizes reported in cancer.

===Crohn's Disease===
[[Crohn's disease]] (CD) is one of the two main forms of [[inflammatory bowel disease]] (the other being [[ulcerative colitis]]). It affects the gastrointestinal tract, and may cause pain, diarrhea, and vomiting, and can result in significant weight loss. The genetic associations of CD have remained elusive. In 2008, the Center pioneered an alternative strategy for examining the disorder by focusing on age-of-onset. To this end, they carried out a genome-wide association study of 1,011 individuals with pediatric-onset IBD and 4,250 matched controls. Researchers identified and replicated two previously unreported regions on chromosome 20 and chromosome 21 that predicted childhood IBD. These regions were located near the genes TNFRSF6B and PSMG1 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kugathasan S, Baldassano RN, Bradfield JP |title=Loci on 20q13 and 21q22 are associated with pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=1211–5 |date=October 2008 |pmid=18758464 |pmc=2770437 |doi=10.1038/ng.203|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these genes is now thought to be intimately linked to the biology of IBD.

In a subsequent paper, the Center applied [[pathway analysis]] to focus on multiple regions in the genome that may interact to cause Crohn’s disease.  Researchers led by Kai Wang identified an association between CD and a network of 20 genes. The network contains many [[interleukins]] – proteins that are critical components of the immune system. Many of the genes in the pathway did not correlate significantly with CD independently. However, when analyzed together, the network of genes did significantly associate with the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang K, Zhang H, Kugathasan S |title=Diverse genome-wide association studies associate the IL12/IL23 pathway with Crohn Disease |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=84 |issue=3 |pages=399–405 |date=March 2009 |pmid=19249008 |pmc=2668006 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.01.026|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding represents an important proof-of-principle as the first demonstration of the power of a pathway approach to understanding human genomics.

In 2009, the Center also published a genome-wide association study of inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) in 3,426 affected individuals and 11,963 genetically matched controls. Researchers identified five new regions associated with early-onset IBD, and detected associations at a number of loci previously implicated in adult-onset IBD.

===Schizophrenia===
[[Schizophrenia]] is a complex disorder that affects about a half percent of the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bhugra D |title=The global prevalence of schizophrenia |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=e151; quiz e175 |date=May 2005 |pmid=15916460 |pmc=1140960 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goldner EM, Hsu L, Waraich P, Somers JM |title=Prevalence and incidence studies of schizophrenic disorders: a systematic review of the literature |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=47 |issue=9 |pages=833–43 |date=November 2002 |pmid=12500753}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the first symptoms of schizophrenia typically appear in adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bhugra D |title=The global prevalence of schizophrenia |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=e151; quiz e175 |date=May 2005 |pmid=15916460 |pmc=1140960 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020151}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a genome-wide association study of 1,735 schizophrenic patients and 3,485 healthy adults, the Center identified copy number variations as a potential cause of the disorder. In the schizophrenia group, researchers located CNVs near the CACNA1B and DOC2A genes, both of which facilitate calcium signals that are important to [[neurotransmission]] in the brain. They also identified CNVs near the RET and RIT2 genes, which are known to be involved in brain development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Glessner JT, Reilly MP, Kim CE |title=Strong synaptic transmission impact by copy number variations in schizophrenia |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=107 |issue=23 |pages=10584–9 |date=June 2010 |pmid=20489179 |pmc=2890845 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1000274107|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the regions associated with schizophrenia have previously been found to associate with autism and ADHD. This provides a strong indication that many psychiatric disorders stem share similar neurodevelopmental features.

===Type 1 Diabetes===
[[Type 1 diabetes]] in children results from autoimmune destruction of cells in the pancreas, leading to an insufficient production of insulin. It is fatal unless treated by insulin. In 2007, researchers performed a genome-wide association study in a large pediatric group that identified a previously unknown association between type 1 diabetes and a genetic variation on chromosome 16. This region contains KIAA0350, the gene product of which is predicted to be a sugar-binding protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grant SF, Hakonarson H, Schwartz S |title=Can the genetics of type 1 and type 2 diabetes shed light on the genetics of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults? |journal=Endocrine Reviews |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=183–93 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20007922 |doi=10.1210/er.2009-0029}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent follow-up studies (e.g. Concannon ''et al.'', 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Concannon P, Onengut-Gumuscu S, Todd JA |title=A human type 1 diabetes susceptibility locus maps to chromosome 21q22.3 |journal=Diabetes |volume=57 |issue=10 |pages=2858–61 |date=October 2008 |pmid=18647951 |pmc=2551699 |doi=10.2337/db08-0753|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have confirmed a link between this gene and type-1 diabetes, and our group is currently participating in a resequencing study of this region. This paper was published in Nature [hyperlink to ]

== Technology ==
The Center uses [[microarrays]] to perform whole-genome analysis – microarrays are slides consisting of thousands to millions of tiny probes. They allow researchers to screen an individual’s genome for huge numbers of genetic markers called [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs). A SNP occurs when the DNA in two individuals in the population differs by a single nucleotide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g2conline.org/#Gene%20Finding?aid=554/|title=Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms|publisher=[[Dolan DNA Learning Center]]|accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, one individual may have an 'A' at a specific position, and another individual may have a 'C'. This can impact on the protein encoded by the DNA sequence (the gene) and increase gene risk.

An association typically means that a SNP is significantly more frequent in a patient-group than in controls.  Once researchers know the location of a SNP that is more common in a group, they can examine the sequence of DNA from which it comes. In this way, they can check if it is part of a gene, or is close to a gene. The Center can simultaneously scan the genome for thousands of these associations at once – a powerful methodology called [[genome-wide association]]. At the Center, researchers have examined over 100,000 individuals.

Humans can also differ in the number of copies of each gene an individual has. These differences are called [[copy number variants]]. Rare alterations in a chromosome can lead to the gain or a loss of a copy.  A duplication occurs when a fragment of DNA is gained – during copying, or when genes are shuffled at conception. The same process can cause a deletion, where a fragment of DNA is lost. Deletions and duplications of greater than 1,000 nucleotides are called copy number variants (CNVs).

The Center is equipped with the [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] BeadArray System and utilizes both the Infinium and GoldenGate analytical methods. The Center's equipment includes multiple Tecan hardware systems and scanning instruments with integrative Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). It uses several [[genotyping]] units from [[Affymetrix]], adding flexibility to internal and collaborative projects to conduct studies on either platform.

The '''Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration''' (CAA)  (previously the '''Chinese Antarctic Administration of the State Antarctic Research Committee''')&lt;ref name="NSIDC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsidc.org/pubs/notes/33/|title=NSIDC Notes, Issue 33|date=September 2000|work=National Snow and Ice Data Center|publisher=University of Colorado at Boulder|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Beijing]]-based agency of the [[People's Republic of China]]'s [[State Oceanic Administration]] (SOA).  Established in 1981, it organizes China's scientific program for both the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]], and it provides logistic support to Antarctic expeditions. There are several; divisions, including General Affairs, Operation &amp; Logistics, Science Programs, International Cooperation, representation in the Chinese Embassy in [[Chile]], and a Winter Training Base.&lt;ref name="BriefIntroduction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinare.gov.cn/en/index.html?pid=about|title=A Brief Introduction to CAA|work=chinare.gov.cn|accessdate=27 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307224446/http://www.chinare.gov.cn/en/index.html?pid=about|archivedate=7 March 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director is [[Qu Tanzhou]].&lt;ref name="chinadaily"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-05/06/content_9814100.htm|title=Arctic research set to be beefed up|last=Qian|first=Wang|date=2010-05-06|work=[[China Daily]]|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAA organizes, coordinates and supervises China's polar program.  As such, its responsibilities include: developing an integrated national polar research strategy, developing policy to guide national polar research activities, developing a five-year plan which coordinates the national policy, updating the national polar plan on an annual basis, coordinating the annual national polar research expedition, promoting coordination of polar research programs with other agencies, and supporting polar research cooperation with other nations and international organizations.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaAntarctic"&gt;{{cite book|last=Riffenburgh|first=Beau |title=Encyclopedia of the Antarctic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fRJtB2MNdJMC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=Chinese+Arctic+and+Antarctic+Administration&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZTtOTMalFI_CsAOb39EL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Chinese%20Arctic%20and%20Antarctic%20Administration&amp;f=false|volume=1|year=2007 |publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-415-97024-5|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAA is affiliated with the [[International Arctic Research Center]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iarc.uaf.edu/gmap/|title=IARC International Collaborations, Partners, and Related Organizations|date=2009-02-13|work=iarc.uaf.edu|publisher=IARC, University of Alaska, Fairbanks|accessdate=27 July 2010|location=Fairbanks|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515143417/http://www.iarc.uaf.edu/gmap/|archivedate=15 May 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
and the [[International Arctic Science Committee]].

==Projects==
A 2006 ''[[Shanghai Daily]]'' news report stated that Chinese scientists would begin naming 46 newly surveyed, anonymous Antarctic islands and that the CAA, with its teammate [[Sina.com]], would collect candidate names.&lt;ref name="ChinaEntersIceAge"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/blogs/eyeonasia/archives/2006/04/china_enters_the_ice_age.html|title=China enters the Ice Age|last=Einhorn|first=Bruce|date=2006-04-03|work=[[Business Week]]|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2007 through 2009, the CAA organized a government sponsored research project to enhance its understanding of the legal, military and political issues associated with the Arctic. The agency also operates a winter training base at [[Yabuli Ski Resort]] in the northern province of [[Heilongjiang]].&lt;ref name="BriefIntroduction"/&gt;

The [[International Polar Year]] 2007-2008 China Programme included a partnership between the [[International Polar Foundation]], the CCA, and the [[Polar Research Institute of China]]. This included the participation of Jean de Pomereu, reporter and photographer, in the 25th CHINARE Expedition late in the year in 2008.  He traveled aboard the Chinese [[icebreaker]], [[MV Xue Long|Xuelong]]  ("Snow Dragon"), then reported from China's east Antarctic research station, [[Antarctic Zhongshan Station]].&lt;ref name="polarfoundation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polarfoundation.org/projects/project_detail/panda_dome_a_station_25th_chinese_antarctic_expedition/|title=PANDA &amp; Dome A station: 25th Chinese Antarctic Expedition|work=polarfoundation.org|accessdate=28 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222001358/http://www.polarfoundation.org/projects/project_detail/panda_dome_a_station_25th_chinese_antarctic_expedition/|archivedate=22 December 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition team sent by the CAA was also entrusted with starting construction of the [[Antarctic Kunlun Station]], China's third Antarctic station.&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090106/full/457134a.html|title=China builds inland Antarctic base|last=Qiu|first=Jane|date=2009-01-06|work=[[Nature News]]|accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Xuelong'', China's only polar research icebreaker was purchased in 1993 from [[Ukraine]], and has made 24 research expeditions to the Antarctic and three to the Arctic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4182">In [[literature]], the '''deuteragonist''' or '''secondary main character''' (from {{lang-grc|δευτεραγωνιστής}}, ''deuteragōnistḗs'', second actor) is the second most important  character, after the [[protagonist]] and before the [[tritagonist]].&lt;ref name="deut1"&gt;Bartleby.com (2006). [http://www.bartleby.com/61/56/D0175600.html Deuteragonist]&lt;/ref&gt; The deuteragonist may switch between supporting and opposing the protagonist, depending on the deuteragonist's own conflict or plot.

==History==
[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[drama]] began with simply one actor, the protagonist, and a [[Greek chorus|chorus]] of dancers. The playwright [[Aeschylus]] introduced the deuteragonist; Aristotle says in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'':

{{Quote
|1={{lang|grc|Καὶ τό τε τῶν ὑποκριτῶν πλῆθος ἐξ ἑνὸς εἰς δύο πρῶτος Αἰσχύλος ἤγαγε καὶ τὰ τοῦ χοροῦ ἠλάττωσε καὶ τὸν λόγον πρωταγωνιστεῖν παρεσκεύασεν}}

''{{lang|grc-Latn|Kai to te tōn hypokritōn plēthos ex enos eis duo prōtos Aiskhilos ēgage kai ta tou khorou ēlattōse kai ton logon prōtagōnistein pareskeuasen}}''

Thus, it was Aeschylus who first raised the number of the actors from one to two. He also curtailed the chorus and made the dialogue be the leading part.
|2=[[Aristotle]]
|3=[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]] (1449a15)&lt;ref name="deut2"&gt;Perseus Digital Library (2006). [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Poet.+1449a Aristotle, ''Poetics'']&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Aeschylus' efforts brought the dialogue and interaction between characters to the forefront and set the stage for other playwrights of the era, like [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], to produce many iconic plays.&lt;ref name="deut3"&gt;TheatreHistory.com (2006). [http://www.theatrehistory.com/ancient/aeschylus001.html "Aeschylus and his Tragedies"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drama==
Because [[Ancient Greek drama]] involved only three actors (the protagonist, deuteragonist, and tritagonist) plus the chorus, each actor often played several parts. For instance, in Sophocles' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', the protagonist would be [[Oedipus]], who is on stage in most acts, the deuteragonist would be [[Jocasta]] (Oedipus' mother and wife), as well as the Shepherd and Messenger. This would be because Jocasta is certainly a major role&amp;mdash;acting opposite Oedipus many times and occupying a central part of the story&amp;mdash;and because the Shepherd and Messenger are onstage when Jocasta is offstage.&lt;ref name="deut4"&gt;Wayne S. Turney (2006). [http://www.wayneturney.20m.com/oedipus.htm Sophokles' ''Oedipus Rex'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
In literature, the deuteragonist often assumes the role of "[[sidekick]]" to the protagonist. In [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', the protagonist is [[Huckleberry Finn (character)|Huck]] and the deuteragonist, his constant companion, is [[Jim (Huckleberry Finn)|Jim]]. In this story the tritagonist would be [[Tom Sawyer]].&lt;ref name="deut5"&gt;Dr. L. Kip Wheeler (2006). [http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_T.html Literary Vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the deuteragonist could also be a particularly visible [[antagonist]], normally whom the actual antagonist hides behind. In some cases, the deuteragonist is a sidekick who is also used as a foil for the protagonist, in order to more greatly enhance the powers or strengths of the main character. [[Doctor Watson|Dr. John Watson]], for example, in the [[Sherlock Holmes]] series by [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], is an educated and intelligent gentleman of professional standing, and yet his own intelligence is of too rigid a stance to embrace fully the kind of possibilities of which the more maverick [[Sherlock Holmes]] is capable.

The '''eddy break-up model''' ('''EBU''') is used in [[combustion]] engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Combustion | work = CFD Online website | publisher = CFD Online | url = http://www.cfd-online.com/Wiki/Combustion#Eddy_Break-Up_model | accessdate = 23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Combustion modeling has a wide range of applications. In most of the combustion systems fuel and oxygen (or air) are separately supplied in the combustion chamber. Due to this chemical reaction and combustion occurs simultaneously in the [[combustion chamber]]. However, the rate of the chemical reaction is faster than the rate of mixing fuel and oxygen. Therefore, that rate of combustion is controlled by rate of mixing. Such cases, where formation of pre-mixture is difficult, are called [[diffusion combustion]] or [[diffusion flame]]s.

==Diffusion flames==
[[Diffusion]] flames can be [[laminar flow|laminar]] diffusion flames (e.g. candles and matches burning in the air etc.) or [[turbulent diffusion]] flames (e.g. furnaces, turbo-machinery, some liquid-fuel rocket engines and [[internal combustion engine]]s) depending on the nature of mixed gas flow. Further, the flame shapes of this kind of burning are divided into two categories oxygen-rich diffusion flames and oxygen-deficient. Flame shapes also depend on the discharging [[velocity]] of fuel and air. [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|Eddies]] inside the air flow plays an important role in deciding the flame shapes. With increase in discharging velocity of fuel into the air laminar diffusion flames tends to become turbulent diffusion flames. This leads to an increase in the flame height and finally it gains a maximum height (critical limit). After this limit further increase in the jet velocity of the fuel adds to instability of turbulent flame. The position where laminar flame is changing into turbulent flame is termed as "break-up point". Increase in jet velocity after critical limit results in decrease of the whole flame height. Beyond this point the height of the break-up point reaches a certain value where even after increasing the jet velocity of fuel the flame height will not change. Studies by Hawthorne et al. prove that the chemical reaction rates in turbulent diffusion flames and in laminar diffusion flames are almost similar.

==Problems==
Combustion plays a vital role in many applications and a proper understanding of its effect on the system can be very helpful in designing the newer technologies and improving the existing ones. Nowadays, numerical modeling is a most effective tool for understanding and studying such problems. But a number of problems are associated with it such as:
* The control equations associated are very complicated.
* Large number of control equation need to be studied which include knowledge of both fluid dynamics and chemistry of chemical reactions during combustion.
* Involvement of huge number of components in the chemical reactions.
* There are serious time-scale problems because of mismatch in chemical reaction rate and fluid transport rate.
* Effect of several other processes like heat transfer, radiation, convection and diffusion.

==Combustion models==
Many combustion models have been proposed. There is a long list of such models in literature but due to simplicity the eddy break-up model originally proposed by Spalding and later modified by Magnussen and Hjertager ([[eddy dissipation model]] (EDM)) became popular models. It is based on the assumption that the reaction rate is controlled by turbulent mixing because of the dependence of reaction rate on the mixing of the turbulent eddies. It is well documented that there are strong interactions between the turbulent flow and reactions. The heat released during the reaction affects the density and hence turbulence. While the turbulent flow induces changes concentration and temperature pulsations which enhance the mixing and heat transfer and affect the reaction rate. Turbulence also results in deformations in burning flame surface due to which folding occurs and the surface is also broken into pieces of different sizes. This enhances the total surface area of the flame and thus increases the combustible mixed gases burnt per unit time. Due to this, turbulent flames grow at a much faster rate than that of laminar flames.

==Formula==
Spalding (1971)&lt;ref&gt;Spalding, D. B., "Mixing and chemical reaction in steady confined turbulent flames", Thirteenth symposium (international) on combustion, The combustion institute, pp. 649–657, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; defined rate of fuel consumption as a function of local flow properties of fuel and oxidant. This model is based on a single step global infinitely fast stoichiometric chemical reaction.

1&amp;nbsp;kg of fuel + s kg of oxidant→(1+s) kg of products

For ''m&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' as mass fraction and ''M&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' as molecular weight of species ''j''; local density of mixture ''(ρ)'' is dependent on concentration of reactant and products and temperature of mixture. It can be mathematically calculated as:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{\rho = \frac{P}{RT\sum_{\text{for all j}}{\frac{m_j}{M_j}}}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
 
It is used to express the turbulent dissipation rate of fuel ''(R&lt;sub&gt;fu&lt;/sub&gt;)'', oxygen ''(R&lt;sub&gt;ox&lt;/sub&gt;)'' and products ''(R&lt;sub&gt;pr&lt;/sub&gt;)'' following the proposal from Magnussen and Hjertager as:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{R_{fu}=-C_R\rho m_{fu}\frac{\varepsilon}{k}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{R_{ox}=-C_R\rho \frac{m_{ox}}{s}\frac{\varepsilon}{k}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{R_{pr}=-C_R^{'}\rho \frac{m_{pr}}{(1+s)}\frac{\varepsilon}{k}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}
Where ''k'' is the turbulent kinetic energy, is the rate of dissipation of ''k'', and are model constants (value varies from 0.35 to 4). The reaction rate of fuel is considered to be smallest among all and is given by:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{S_{fu}=-\rho\frac{\varepsilon}{k}min\biggl[C_Rm_{fu}, C_R\frac{m_{ox}}{s}, C_R^{'}\frac{m_{pr}}{1+s}\biggr]}&lt;/math&gt;|{{equationRef|5}}}}
The model also leads to determination of mass fraction of product and oxygen using transport equation of mixture fraction ''(f)''
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{ f=\frac{[{sm}_{fu}-m_{ox}]-{[{sm}_{fu}-m_{ox}]}_0}{{[{sm}_{fu}-m_{ox}]}_1-{[{sm}_{fu}-m_{ox}]}_0}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}
For solving we need to first find the stociometric mixture fraction ''(f&lt;sub&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt;)'' when there is no fuel and oxygen is present in products, which is defined as 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{f_{st}=\frac{m_{ox, 0}}{{sm}_{fu, 1}+m_{ox, 0}}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{{If} f &lt; f_{st}, f=\frac{-m_{ox}+m_{ox, 0}}{{sm}_{fu, 1}+m_{ox, 0}}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|8}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{{If} f &gt; f_{st}, f=\frac{-{sm}_{fu, 1}+m_{ox, 0}}{{sm}_{fu, 1}+m_{ox, 0}}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|9}}}}
Above equations (7-9) not only shows linear relation of mixture fraction with mass fraction of oxygen and products but also helps in predicting their values. Magnussen and Hjertager (1976)&lt;ref&gt;Magnussen, B. F.; Hjertager, B. H., "On the mathematical modeling of turbulent combustion with special emphasis on shoot formation and combustion", Sixth symposium (International) on combustion, The combustion institute, pp. 719–729, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; utilize this model and conformity of experimental results with predictions supports this model. Several other researchers also justified the beauty of this model for fairly good predictions which are quite close to experimental results. Hence, this model is a topic of top priority due to its simplicity, steady convergence, and implementation in [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) procedures.

{{singlesource|date=April 2017}}
A '''fake book''' is a collection of musical [[lead sheet]]s intended to help a performer quickly learn and perform new songs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wwbw.com/the-music-room/what-is-a-music-fakebook Woodwind Brasswind: "What is a fake book?"]&lt;/ref&gt; Each song in a fake book contains the [[Melody|melody line]], basic [[Chord (music)|chords]] and sometimes [[lyrics]]{{snd}}the minimal information needed by a [[musician]] or small group to make an impromptu, extemporized [[arrangement]] of a song, or "fake it". The fake book is a central part of the culture of playing [[music]] in [[jazz]], where strong [[jazz improvisation|improvisation]] abilities are expected from "[[comping]]" [[rhythm section]] players ([[piano]], [[electric guitar]], [[double bass]], [[drum kit]]) and "lead instruments" which play the melody and improvise lengthy solos over the [[chord progression]].

==Overview==
Fake books are not intended for novices. Sometimes, melodies with [[syncopation]] are written with the syncopation omitted, so the reader must be familiar with the songs "by ear" to play the melodies correctly. Some [[32 bar form]]s do not have a printed melody during the "B" section, as the lead instrumentalist is expected to improvise one. Similarly, the [[chord progression]]s for some [[blues]] tunes omit the [[Turnaround (music)|turnaround]] (often simply indicating two bars on the tonic), as it is expected that an experienced jazz player will know the appropriate turnarounds to insert (e.g., (I–VI&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;–ii–V&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;). The reader needs to have thorough familiarity with [[extended chords]] (e.g., C&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[altered chord]]s (e.g., C&lt;sup&gt;7{{music|#}}11&lt;/sup&gt;). Introductions and codas are often omitted, as it is expected that players will know the familiar intros and codas used on specific songs. Fake books are often bound.

A variant type of fake book contains only the [[chord progression]]s to the songs. These books could be used by the rhythm section instruments to guide their improvised accompaniment and by "lead instruments" for their improvised solo sections, but since they do not contain the melody, they can be used in performances only by players who have the melodies memorized. Fake books are commonly used at informal "[[jam session]]s" and at jazz shows at small [[nightclub]]s and bars.

==History==
A predecessor to fake books was created in May 1942 when George Goodwin, a radio station director, released the first Tune-Dex cards. Printing on {{convert|3|by|5|in|cm|adj=on}} [[index card]]s that had the same size as library catalog cards, Goodwin provided lyrics, melody and chord symbols as well as copyright information.&lt;ref name="kernfeld"/&gt; Goodwin also promoted the cards to professional musicians until 1963, when poor health forced his retirement. For many years the "standard" fake books were called simply "Fake Books". All were composed of [[song]]s illegally printed, with no [[music royalties|royalties]] paid to the copyright owners. In 1964, the [[FBI]]'s Cleveland, Ohio, office observed that "practically every professional musician in the country owns at least one of these fake music books as they constitute probably the single most useful document available".&lt;ref name="kernfeld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/bdk4/PREHISTORY.pdf|title=Pop Song Piracy, Fake Books, and a Pre-history of Sampling|accessdate=2008-04-05|year=2003|last=Kernfeld|first=Barry|publisher=Kernfeld|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906191712/http://www.personal.psu.edu/bdk4/PREHISTORY.pdf|archivedate=2008-09-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first two volumes, ''Fake Book Volume 1'' and ''Fake Book Volume 2'', issued in the late 1940s–1950s, together comprised about 2000 songs dating from the turn of the 20th century through the late 1950s. In the 1950s the ''Modern Jazz Fake Book, Volumes 1 and 2'' was issued, and ''Fake Book Volume 3'', containing about 500 songs, came out in 1961. The music in ''Fake Books 1'', ''2'', and ''3'' was [[photocopied]] or reset with a musical typewriter from the melody lines of the original [[sheet music]]. Usually chord symbols, titles, composer names, and lyrics were typewritten, but for a number of songs these were all photocopied along with the melody line.

The chord changes in these books were notoriously inaccurate. Most of them were based on the guitar and ukulele chords commonly found in earlier sheet music, which often did not include the roots of the harmony. For example, a chord labeled "Fdim" ("F diminished") for guitar or ukulele might functionally be a G&lt;sup&gt;7{{music|b}}9&lt;/sup&gt; ("G seven, flat nine") chord, which has a G as the root plus all the notes of an Fdim&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; chord. Thus, successfully using the ''Fake Books'' required the expertise of jazz musicians and others trained in functional harmony in order to reinterpret the chord symbols.

The three ''Fake Books'' were well indexed, alphabetically as well as by musical genre and [[Broadway show]]. Although the tunes in the ''Fake Books'' were compiled illegally, the creators printed copyright information under every song{{snd}}perhaps to give the false impression that the ''Fake Books'' were legal, or to show respect for the creators. The ''Modern Jazz Fake Book'' was divided into two sections, each indexed separately as ''Volume One'' and ''Volume Two''. The music was transcribed by hand from recordings, and each transcription included performer name, record label, and catalog number. Unlike today's fake and "real" books that have "jazz" in their titles, the ''Modern Jazz Fake Book'' included no standards, but only original tunes written and recorded by jazz musicians. All these books have been long out of print, though music students have photocopied the books from other musicians. Fake books originally infringed [[copyright]]s, and their circulation was primarily [[Black market|underground]].

During the school year of 1974–75, an unidentified group of musicians based at the [[Berklee College of Music]] in Boston published ''The [[Real Book]]'', which claimed to fix all problems of poor design, although it was riddled with errors, which were gradually corrected by generations of players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://myguitarpal.com/history-of-the-real-fake-book/ My Guitar Pal: "History of the Real Book"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Swallow]], who was teaching at Berklee at that time, said the students who edited the book intended "to make a book that contained a hipper repertoire, more contemporary repertoire".&lt;ref name="kernfeld"/&gt;   It was popular and in its turn spawned a number of "fake Real Books".

In the 2000s, some types of "real books" have been published which fully respect copyright laws. In the 2000s, some computer-based "fake books" became available. Since these computer-based fake books are stored on a computer, the user can have the key [[Musical transposition|transposed]] instantly. This facilitates the performance of music at shows where some performers have transposing instruments, or in shows with a [[singer]] who wants the band to play in a different key to accommodate their vocal range.

A '''footpath''' (also pedestrian way, [[walking trail]], [[nature trail]]) is a type of [[thoroughfare]] that is intended for use only by [[pedestrian]]s and not other forms of traffic such as [[Motor vehicle|motorized vehicles]], cycles, and [[horseback|horses]]. They can be found in a wide variety of places, from the centre of cities, to farmland, to mountain ridges. Urban footpaths are usually paved, may have steps, and can be called [[alleys]], lanes, steps, etc.

[[National parks]], [[nature preserve]]s, [[conservation area]]s and other protected [[wilderness]] areas may have footpaths ([[trail]]s) that are restricted to pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/vafo/planyourvisit/hikingtrails.htm |title=Trails - Valley Forge National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service) |publisher=Nps.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term footpath can also describe a pavement/[[sidewalk]] in some English-speaking countries (such as Australia and the Republic of Ireland).

A footpath can also take the form of a [[footbridge]], linking two places across a river. 
==Origins and history==
Public footpaths are [[rights of way]] originally created by people walking across the land to work, market, the next village, church, and school. This includes [[Mass path]]s and [[Corpse road]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hampsteadramblers.org.uk/history/14-history-highways.html |title=History - footpaths, highways and public rights of way |publisher=Hampsteadramblers.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cambswalks.blogspot.ca/2014/04/history-of-footpaths.html |title=Cambridgeshire walks: History of footpaths |publisher=Cambswalks.blogspot.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some footpaths were also created by those undertaking a [[pilgrimage]]. Examples of the latter are the [[Pilgrim's Way]] in England and [[Pilgrim's Route]] (St. Olav's Way or the Old Kings' Road) in Norway. Some landowners allow access over their land without dedicating a right of way. These permissive paths are often indistinguishable from normal paths, but they are usually subject to restrictions. Such paths are often closed at least once a year, so that a permanent right of way cannot be established in law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/blog/2011/08/rights-of-way/ |title=Everything you need to know about Rights of Way &amp;#124; Ordnance Survey Blog |publisher=Ordnancesurvey.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Old Corpse Road - geograph.org.uk - 72907.jpg|thumb|Corpse road in the English [[Lake District]]]]

A mass path is a [[pedestrian]] track or road connecting destinations frequently used by rural communities, most usually the destination of [[Sunday Mass]]. They were most common during the centuries that preceded motorised transportation in Western Europe, and in particular the British Isles and the Netherlands (where such a path is called "kerkenpad" (lit. Church path). Mass paths typically included stretches crossing fields of neighboring farmers and were likely to contain [[stile]]s, when crossing fences or other boundaries, or plank [[footbridge]]s to cross ditches. Some mass paths are still used today in the [[Republic of Ireland]], but are usually subject to Ireland's complicated [[rights of way]] law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coillteoutdoors.ie/index.php?id=54&amp;trail=126&amp;no_cache=1 |title=Coillte Outdoors: Mass Path/River Walk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129150107/http://www.coillteoutdoors.ie/index.php?id=54&amp;trail=126&amp;no_cache=1 |archive-date=2007-11-29 |date=2007-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corpse roads provided a practical means for transporting corpses, often from remote communities, to [[cemetery|cemeteries]] that had burial rights, such as parish churches and [[chapel of ease|chapels of ease]].&lt;ref name="Muir"&gt;Muir, Richard (2008), ''Woods, Hedgerows and Leafy Lanes.'' Tempus, Chalford. {{ISBN|978-0-7524-4615-8}}; p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Great Britain]], such routes can also be known by a number of other names: bier road, burial road, coffin road, coffin line, lyke or lych way, funeral road, procession way, corpse way,&lt;ref name="Muir"/&gt; etc.

Nowadays footpaths are mainly used for recreation and have been frequently linked together, along with bridle paths and newly created footpaths, to create [[long distance trails]]. Also organizations have been formed in various countries to protect the right to use public footpaths, including the [[Ramblers Association]] in England. Footpaths are now also found in [[botanic garden]]s, [[arboretum]]s, [[regional park]]s, [[conservation area]]s, [[wildlife garden]]s, and [[open-air museum]]s. There are also [[educational trail]]s, [[themed walk]]s, [[sculpture trail]]s and historic interpretive trails.

==Rights of way==
[[File:Thottu Varambu.jpg|thumbnail|Footpath in [[Kuttippuram]], India.]]
In [[England and Wales]], public footpaths are [[Rights of way in England and Wales|rights of way]] on which pedestrians have a legally protected right to travel. Other public [[Right of way (public throughway)|rights of way]] in England and Wales, such as [[bridleway]]s, [[byway (road)|byway]]s, [[towpath]]s, and [[Green lane (road)|green lanes]] are also used by pedestrians. In Scotland there is no legal distinction between a footpath and a [[bridleway]] and it is generally accepted that cyclists and horse riders may follow any right of way with a suitable surface. The law is different in both [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]] and there are far fewer rights of way in Ireland as a whole (see [[Keep Ireland Open]]).

===Definitive path maps===
Footpaths and other rights of way in England and Wales are shown on [[definitive map]]s. A definitive map is a record of public [[Right-of-way (transportation)|rights of way]] in England and Wales. In law it is the definitive record of where a right of way is located. The highway authority (normally the [[county council]], or unitary authority in areas with a one-tier system) has a statutory duty to maintain a definitive map, though in national parks the [[national park authority]] usually maintains the map. The [[Inner London]] boroughs are exempt from the statutory duty though they have the powers to maintain a map: currently none does so.&lt;ref&gt;See: [http://www.ramblers.org.uk/footpaths/law/definitivemap.html Public Paths and the Definitive Map] from the [[Ramblers Association]] and 
[http://www.planning-inspectorate.gov.uk/pins/appeals/rights_of_way/rights_way.htm Definitive Map Orders: Consistency Guidelines] from the [[Planning Inspectorate]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland different legislation applies and there is no legally recognised record of rights of way. However, there is a National Catalogue of Rights of Way (CROW), compiled by the Scottish Rights of Way and Access Society (Scotways), in partnership with Scottish Natural Heritage, and the help of local authorities.&lt;ref name="Rights of way in Scotland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snh.org.uk/pdfs/access/sr-sprow.pdf|format=PDF|title= Rights of way in Scotland|publisher=Snh.org.uk|accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open Spaces Society===
[[File:Stepping Stones - geograph.org.uk - 5528.jpg|left|thumb|[[Step-stone bridge|Stepping stones]] in the [[River Rothay]], [[Lake District]], England.]]
The [[Open Spaces Society]] is a charitable British organisation that works to protect public rights of way and open spaces in the United Kingdom, such as [[common land]] and [[village green]]s. It is Britain's oldest national conservation body. The society was founded as the Commons Preservation Society and merged with the National Footpaths Society in 1899, and adopted their present name.&lt;ref name="oss"&gt;[http://www.oss.org.uk/ Open Spaces Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the Open Spaces Society's work is concerned with the preservation and creation of public paths. Before the introduction of  [[definitive map]]s of public paths in the early 1950s, the public did not know where paths were, and the Open Spaces Society helped the successful campaign for paths to be shown on [[Ordnance Survey]] maps. It advises the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] and National Assembly for Wales on applications for works on common land. Local authorities are legally required to consult the society whenever there is a proposal to alter the route of a public right of way.&lt;ref name="oss"/&gt;

[[The Ramblers]] are another British organisation concerned with the protection of footpaths.

==Urban footpaths==
[[File:Grange farm map.png|thumb|250px|A map which shows a network of paths (dotted blue) created in the town of [[Kesgrave]], Suffolk, England, for walkers and cyclists]]
There are a variety of footpaths in urban settings, including paths along streams and rivers, through [[park]]s and across [[Common land|commons]]. Another type is the [[alley]], normally providing access to the rear of properties or connecting built-up roads not easily reached by vehicles. [[Towpath]]s are another kind of urban footpath, but they are often shared with cyclists. A typical footpath in a park is found along the [[seawall]] in [[Stanley Park]], [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada. This is a segregated path, with one lane for skaters and cyclists and the other for pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Kevin; Terri Clark (4 February 2005). "Grand Old Man of the Seawall". ''Vancouver Sun''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USA and Canada, where [[urban sprawl]] has begun to strike even the most rural communities, developers and local leaders are currently striving to make their communities more conducive to non-motorized transportation through the use of less traditional paths. The [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] has established the [[Active Living by Design]] program to improve the [[Quality of life|livability]] of communities in part through developing trails,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humpal.org/program-areas/active-living-primer |title=Active Living By Design |publisher=Humpal.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Upper Valley Trails Alliance]] has done similar work on traditional trails, while the [[Somerville Community Path]] and related paths, are examples of urban initiatives. In [[St. John’s, Newfoundland|St. John's]], [[Newfoundland]], Canada The [[Grand Concourse (St. John's)|Grand Concourse]], is an integrated [[walkway]] system that has over {{convert|160|km|mi|sp=us}} of footpaths which link every major park, river, pond, and green space in six municipalities.

In [[Walking in London|London]], England, there are several long-distance walking routes which combine footpaths and roads to link green spaces. These include the [[Capital Ring]], [[London Outer Orbital Path]] and the [[Jubilee Walkway]], the use of which have been endorsed by [[Transport for London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/walking/top-walking-routes|title=Walk London|publisher=[[Transport for London]]|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alley and steps===
[[File:Marten-Trotzigs-Graend.jpg|170px|left|thumb|A typical urban footpath: [[Mårten Trotzigs Gränd]], {{convert|90|cm|ft|abbr=on}} wide, the narrowest alley in [[Gamla stan]], [[Stockholm]], Sweden]]
An [[alley]] is a narrow, usually paved, pedestrian path, often between the walls of buildings in towns and cities. This type is usually short and straight, and on steep ground can consist partially or entirely of steps. In older cities and towns in Europe, alleys are often what is left of a medieval street network, or a [[right of way]] or ancient footpath. Similar paths also exist in some older North American towns and cities. In some older urban development in North America lanes at the rear of houses, to allow for deliveries and garbage collection, are called alleys. Alleys may be paved, or unpaved, and a blind alley is a [[cul-de-sac]]. Some alleys are roofed because they are within buildings, such as the [[traboule]]s of [[Lyon]], or when they are a pedestrian passage through railway embankments in Britain. The latter follow the line of [[Rights of way in England and Wales|rights-of way]] that existed before the railway was built.

Because of  [[topography]], steps ([[stairs]]) are the predominant form of alley in hilly cities and towns. This includes [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] (see [[Steps of Pittsburgh]]), [[Cincinnati]] (see [[Steps of Cincinnati]]), [[Seattle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlestairwalks.com/ |title=Seattle Stairway Walks |publisher=Seattlestairwalks.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[San Francisco]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.sisterbetty.org/stairways/ |title=Stairways of San Francisco |publisher=Sisterbetty.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States, as well as [[Hong Kong]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abhk.org/ill-take-the-stairs%E2%80%A8/ |title=I’ll take the stairs : Alliance For a Beautiful Hong Kong |publisher=Abhk.org |date=2013-01-11 |accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://italiannotes.com/5-steps-to-rome/ |title=Steps to Rome - Top 5 of interesting steps and staircases in Rome |publisher=Italiannotes.com |date=2011-06-29 |accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Long distance paths==
Footpaths (and other rights of way) have been combined, and new paths created, so as to produce [[Long distance trail|long distance walking routes]] in a number of countries. These can be rural in nature, such as the [[Essex Way]], in southern England, which crosses farmland, or urban as with [[Walking in London|various routes in London, England]], or along a coastline like the [[South West Coast Path]] in the [[West of England]], or in the high mountains, like the [[Pacific Crest Trail]] in the USA, which reaches  {{convert|13153|ft|m|0}}{{refn|

[[File:Shaharah bridge.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A footbridge in [[Shaharah District]], Yemen]]

==Maintenance==
Many footpaths require some maintenance. Most rural paths have an earth or grass surface with [[stile]]s, and or gates, including [[kissing gate]]s. A few will have [[Step-stone bridge|stepping stones]], fords, or bridges. Urban footpaths may be constructed of [[masonry]], [[brick]], [[concrete]], asphalt, cut [[stone]] or [[boardwalk|wood boardwalk]]. [[Crushed rock]], [[decomposed granite]], fine [[wood chips]] are also used. The construction materials can vary over the length of the footpath and may start with a well constructed hard surface in an urban area, and end with an inexpensive soft or loose surface in the countryside. Stairs or steps are sometimes found in urban [[alley]]s, or cliff paths to beaches.

==Issues==
The main issues in urban areas include maintenance, litter, crime, and lighting after dark. In the countryside there are issues relating to conflicts between walkers and livestock, and these occasionally result in people being injured or even killed. Dogs often contribute to such conflicts – see in [[England and Wales]] The [[Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Act 1953]]. Also footpaths in remote locations can be difficult to maintain and a route along a country path can be impeded by ploughing, crops, overgrown vegetation, illegal barriers (including [[barbed wire]]), damaged [[stile]]s, etc.

===Confrontation with landowners in the UK===
{{see also|Highways in England and Wales}}
There have been numerous problems over the years in England and Wales with landowners.

One notable example was with the millionaire property tycoon [[Nicholas Van Hoogstraten]] who had a long-standing dislike of and dispute with ramblers, describing them as "scum of the earth". In 1999 Mr Hoogstraten erected a large fence across a footpath on his country estate in East Sussex. Local ramblers staged a protest against the erection of the fence outside the boundary of Van Hoogstraten's estate. On 10 February 2003 and after a 13-year battle and numerous legal proceedings, the path was finally re-opened.&lt;ref&gt;Raath, Jan (3 July 2009). ''The Times'' (London).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Isle of Man====
Another conflict involved [[Jeremy Clarkson]], a TV presenter and ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' host who lives on the [[Isle of Man]]. He became frustrated at the lack of privacy at his home when ramblers deviated from a pathway to take photographs of his dwelling. Clarkson's property bordered a small 250-metre strip of land that had no definitive status as a public right of way but was used by walkers regardless. Clarkson aimed to close access to this small strip of his land, thereby forcing ramblers to take a small diversion to stick to the official public [[right of way]] and therefore protecting his claimed right to privacy on his own property. In May 2010 the former transport minister, Hon. [[David Anderson (Manx politician)|David Anderson]] MHK, accepted the conclusions of a public inquiry that all except five of the paths claimed at the inquiry as public rights of way have been dedicated as public rights of way and should be added to the definitive map.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.im/transport/highways/ViewNews.gov?menuid=18480&amp;page=lib/news/transport/highways/publicinquiryint.xml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002231815/http://www.gov.im/transport/highways/ViewNews.gov?menuid=18480&amp;page=lib%2Fnews%2Ftransport%2Fhighways%2Fpublicinquiryint.xml |archive-date=2012-10-02 |date=2012-10-02 |title=Public Inquiry into Public Rights of Way on the Langness Peninsula – Highways Division Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33097">In [[fluid flow]], '''friction loss''' (or skin friction) is the [[Head loss|loss of pressure or “head”]] that occurs in pipe or [[Duct (flow)|duct flow]] due to the effect of the fluid's [[viscosity]] near the surface of the pipe or duct.&lt;ref name=Munson&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In mechanical systems such as [[internal combustion engine]]s, the term refers to the power lost in overcoming the friction between two moving surfaces, a different phenomenon.

== Economics ==
Friction loss is a significant economic concern wherever fluids are made to flow, whether entirely enclosed in a pipe or duct, or with a surface open to the air.
* Historically, it is a concern in [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]] of all kinds, throughout human history. It is also relevant to sewer lines. Systematic study traces back to [[Henry Darcy]], an aqueduct engineer. 
* Natural flows in river beds are important to human activity; friction loss in a stream bed has an effect on the height of the flow, particularly significant during flooding. 
* The economies of pipelines for petrochemical delivery are highly affected by friction loss. The Yamal–Europe pipeline carries methane at a volume flow rate of 32.3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of gas per year, at [[Reynolds number]]s greater than 50&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* In [[hydropower]] applications, the energy lost to skin friction in [[flume]] and [[penstock]] is not available for useful work, say generating electricity. 
* [[Irrigation]] water is pumped at large yearly volumes of flow, entailing significant expense.
* [[HVAC]] systems pump conditioning air on a widespread basis.
* In [[refrigeration]] applications, energy is expended pumping the coolant fluid through pipes or through the condenser. In split systems, the pipes carrying the coolant take the place of the air ducts in HVAC systems. 
* Wells and domestic water systems must be engineered for effective and economical operation.

== Defining Friction Loss ==
In the following discussion, we define volumetric flow rate V̇ (i.e. volume of fluid flowing) 
V̇ = πr&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;v

where
: r = radius of the pipe (for a pipe of circular section, the internal radius of the pipe).
: v = mean velocity of fluid flowing through the pipe.
: A = cross sectional area of the pipe.
In long pipes, the loss in pressure (assuming the pipe is level) is proportional to the length of pipe involved.
Friction loss is then the change in pressure Δp per unit length of pipe ''L''
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ \Delta p }{ L }. &lt;/math&gt;
When the pressure is expressed in terms of the equivalent height of a column of that fluid, as is common with water, the friction loss is expressed as ''S'', the "head loss" per length of pipe, a dimensionless quantity also known as the ''hydraulic slope''. 
: &lt;math&gt;S = \frac{h_f }{ L } = \frac{ 1 }{ \rho  \mathrm{g} } \frac{ \Delta p }{ L } .&lt;/math&gt;
where
: ρ = [[density|density of the fluid]], (SI kg&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
: g = the local [[Gravitational acceleration|acceleration due to gravity]];

== Characterizing Friction Loss ==

&lt;!--This mode of energy loss is due to the [[shear stress]] between the pipe surface and the fluid flowing within, that flow being characterized as either [[Laminar flow|laminar]] or [[Turbulent flow|turbulent]].  
In the case of laminar flow, obtained at low flow velocity, that velocity varies smoothly between the bulk of the fluid and the surface, where it is zero. 
In turbulent flow (obtained at higher velocity) a layer of chaotic eddies and vortices near the surface, called the viscous sub-layer, forms the transition to the bulk flow.
For turbulent flow, the pressure drop is influenced by the roughness of the surface; in the laminar case, such effects are negligible because the velocity near the surface is zero.&lt;ref name=Munson /&gt;--&gt;

Friction loss, which is due to the [[shear stress]] between the pipe surface and the fluid flowing within, depends on the conditions of flow and the physical properties of the system. These conditions can be encapsulated into a dimensionless number Re, known as the [[Reynolds number]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re}=\frac{1}{\nu}VD&lt;/math&gt;
where ''V'' is the mean fluid velocity and ''D'' the diameter of the (cylindrical) pipe.  In this expression, the properties of the fluid itself are reduced to the [[kinematic viscosity]] ν
:&lt;math&gt;\nu=\frac{\mu}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;
where
: μ = [[viscosity|viscosity of the fluid]] (SI kg&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;s)

=== Friction loss in straight pipe ===
The friction loss In a uniform, straight sections of pipe, known as "major loss", is caused by the effects of [[viscosity]], the movement of fluid [[molecules]] against each other or against the (possibly rough) wall of the pipe. Here, it is greatly affected by whether the flow is [[Laminar flow|laminar]] (Re&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2000) or [[Turbulent flow|turbulent]] (Re &gt; 4000):&lt;ref name=Munson /&gt;
* In [[laminar flow]], losses are [[Hagen–Poiseuille equation|proportional to fluid velocity]], ''V''; that velocity varies smoothly between the bulk of the fluid and the pipe surface, where it is zero. The roughness of the pipe surface influences neither the fluid flow nor the friction loss. 
* In [[turbulent flow]], losses are proportional to the [[Darcy–Weisbach equation|square of the fluid velocity]], ''V''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;;  here, a layer of chaotic eddies and vortices near the pipe surface, called the viscous sub-layer, forms the transition to the bulk flow. In this domain, the effects of the roughness of the pipe surface must be considered. It is useful to characterize that roughness as the ratio of the roughness height ε to the pipe diameter ''D'', the "relative roughness".  Three sub-domains pertain to turbulent flow:
** In the smooth pipe domain, friction loss is relatively insensitive to roughness. 
** In the rough pipe domain, friction loss is dominated by the relative roughness and is insensitive to Reynolds number.
** In the transition domain, friction loss is sensitive to both. 
* For Reynolds numbers 2000&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;Re&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;4000, the flow is unstable, varying with time as vortices within the flow form and vanish randomly. This domain of flow is not well modeled, nor are the details well understood.

=== Form friction ===
Factors other than straight pipe flow induce friction loss; these are known as “minor loss”:
* Fittings, such as bends, couplings, valves, or transitions in [[Hose (tubing)|hose]] or [[piping|pipe]] diameter, or
* Objects intruded into the fluid flow.
For the purposes of calculating the total friction loss of a system, the sources of form friction are sometimes reduced to an equivalent length of pipe.

== Measurements ==
Because of the importance of friction loss in civil engineering and in industry, it has been studied extensively for over a century.

== Calculating friction loss ==

=== Hagen–Poiseuille ===
Laminar flow is encountered in practice with very viscous fluids, such as motor oil, flowing through small-diameter tubes, at low velocity. Friction loss under conditions of laminar flow follow the [[Hagen–Poiseuille equation]], which is an exact solution to the [[Hagen–Poiseuille flow from the Navier–Stokes equations|Navier-Stokes equations]]. For a circular pipe with a fluid of density ''ρ'' and viscosity ''μ'', the hydraulic slope ''S'' can be expressed
:&lt;math&gt;S = \frac{64}{\mathrm{Re}} \frac{V^2}{2gD} = \frac{64\nu}{2g} \frac{V}{D^2}&lt;/math&gt;
In laminar flow (that is, with Re&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;~2000), the hydraulic slope is proportional to the flow velocity.

=== Darcy–Weisbach ===
In many practical engineering applications, the fluid flow is more rapid, therefore turbulent rather than laminar. Under turbulent flow, the friction loss is found to be roughly proportional to the square of the flow velocity and inversely proportional to the pipe diameter, that is, the friction loss follows the phenomenological [[Darcy–Weisbach equation]] in which the ''hydraulic slope'' ''S'' can be expressed&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;S = f_D \frac{ 1 }{ 2g } \frac{V^2}{D} &lt;/math&gt;
where we have introduced the [[Darcy friction factor formulae|Darcy friction factor ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;]] (but see [[Darcy–Weisbach equation#Confusion with the Fanning friction factor|''Confusion with the Fanning friction factor'']]);
: ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; = [[Darcy friction factor formulae|Darcy friction factor]]
Note that the value of this dimensionless factor depends on the pipe diameter ''D'' and the roughness of the pipe surface ε. Furthermore, it varies as well with the flow velocity ''V''  and on the physical properties of the fluid (usually cast together into the Reynolds number Re). Thus, the friction loss is not precisely proportional to the flow velocity squared, nor to the inverse of the pipe diameter: the friction factor takes account of the remaining dependency on these parameters.

From experimental measurements, the general features of the variation of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; are, for fixed ''relative roughness'' ε&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''D'' and for Reynolds number Re = ''V'' ''D''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;ν&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;~2000,{{efn|See [[Moody chart]]}}
* With relative roughness ε&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''D''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; declines in value with increasing Re in an approximate power law, with one order of magnitude change in ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; over four orders of magnitude in Re. This is called the "smooth pipe" regime, where the flow is turbulent but not sensitive to the roughness features of the pipe (because the vortices are much larger than those features). 
* At higher roughness, with increasing Reynolds number Re, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; climbs from its smooth pipe value, approaching an asymptote that itself varies logarithmically with the relative roughness ε&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''D''; this regime is called "rough pipe" flow. 
* The point of departure from smooth flow occurs at a Reynolds number roughly inversely proportional to the value of the relative roughness: the higher the relative roughness, the lower the Re of departure. The range of Re and ε&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''D'' between smooth pipe flow and rough pipe flow is labeled "transitional". In this region, the measurements of Nikuradse show a decline in the value of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; with Re, before approaching its asymptotic value from below,&lt;ref name=Nikuradse1933/&gt; although Moody chose not to follow those data in his chart,&lt;ref name = Moody1944&gt;{{citation

* At values of 2000&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;Re&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;4000, there is a ''critical zone'' of flow, a transition from laminar to turbulence, where the value of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; increases from its laminar value of 64&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;Re to its smooth pipe value. In this regime, the fluid flow is found to be unstable, with vortices appearing and disappearing within the flow over time.
* The entire dependence of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; on the pipe diameter ''D'' is subsumed into the Reynolds number Re and the relative roughness ε&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''D'', likewise the entire dependence on fluid properties density ρ and viscosity μ is subsumed into the Reynolds number Re.

[[File:Flow at Constant Friction Loss in PVC pipe.svg|thumb|Water friction loss (“hydraulic slope”) ''S'' versus flow ''Q'' for given ANSI Sch. 40 NPT PVC pipe, roughness height ''ε''  = 1.5 μm]]
In a design problem, one may select pipe for a [[Darcy–Weisbach equation#Direct calculation|particular hydraulic slope ''S'' based on the candidate pipe's diameter ''D'' and its roughness ε]]. 
With these quantities as inputs, the friction factor ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; can be expressed in closed form in the [[Darcy–Weisbach equation#Turbulent Regime|Colebrook–White equation or other fitting function]], and the flow volume ''Q'' and flow velocity ''V'' can be calculated therefrom.

=== Calculating Friction Loss for Air in a Duct ===
[[File:Equal-friction chart for air in metal duct (ε = 0.05mm).svg|thumb|A graphical depiction of the relationship between Δ''p''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''L'', the pressure loss per unit length of pipe, versus flow volume ''Q'', for a range of choices for pipe diameter ''D'', for air at standard temperature and pressure. Units are SI. Lines of constant Re{{radic|''f''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;}} are also shown.&lt;ref name=Elder/&gt;]]
Friction loss takes place as a gas, say air, flows through [[Duct (flow)|duct work]].&lt;ref name=Elder&gt;{{cite web
| title= Duct Design
| last=Elder

| accessdate=8 October 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The difference in the character of the flow from the case of water in a pipe stems from the differing Reynolds number Re and the roughness of the duct.

The friction loss is customarily given as pressure loss for a given duct length, Δ''p''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''L'', in units of (US) inches of water for 100 feet or (SI) kg&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

For specific choices of duct material, and assuming air at standard temperature and pressure (STP), standard charts can be used to calculate the expected friction loss.&lt;ref name=FreeCalc /&gt;&lt;ref name=PDHonline&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chart exhibited in this section can be used to graphically determine the required diameter of duct to be installed in an application where the volume of flow is determined and where the goal is to keep the pressure loss per unit length of duct ''S'' below some target value in all portions of the system under study. First, select the desired pressure loss Δ''p''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''L'', say 1&amp;nbsp;kg&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.12 in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O per 100&amp;nbsp;ft) on the vertical axis (ordinate). Next scan horizontally to the needed flow volume ''Q'', say 1 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;s (2000 cfm): the choice of duct with diameter ''D'' = 0.5 m (20 in.) will result in a pressure loss rate Δ''p''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''L'' less than the target value. Note in passing that selecting a duct with diameter ''D'' = 0.6 m (24 in.) will result in a loss Δ''p''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''L'' of 0.02&amp;nbsp;kg&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.02 in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O per 100&amp;nbsp;ft), illustrating the great gains in blower efficiency to be achieved by using modestly larger ducts.

The following table gives flow rate ''Q'' such that friction loss per unit length Δ''p'' / ''L'' (SI kg / m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is  0.082, 0.245, and 0.816, respectively, for a variety of nominal duct sizes. The three values chosen for friction loss correspond to, in US units inch water column per 100 feet, 0.01, .03, and 0.1. Note that, in approximation, for a given value of flow volume, a step up in duct size (say from 100mm to 120mm) will reduce the friction loss by a factor of 3.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1395">'''''GB84''''' is a novel published in 2004 by [[David Peace]], set during the [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)|1984-85 miners' strike]].&lt;ref&gt;The Observer, https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/feb/29/fiction.features3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The novel is largely based on factual events and follows two main characters: Terry Winters (based on [[Roger Windsor]]),&lt;ref&gt;Red Pepper, http://www.redpepper.org.uk/No-redemption/&lt;/ref&gt; chief executive of the National Union of Mineworkers; and Stephen Sweet (based on [[David Hart (UK political activist)|David Hart]]), an advisor to the Thatcher government.

The novel refers to contemporary events including the murder of [[Hilda Murrell]], the [[Battle of Orgreave]], the involvement of the police and [[MI5]], and the [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)#NUM links with Libya and the Soviet Union|NUM's links with the Soviet Union and Libya]].

==Structure and style==
Each chapter begins with "day by day" accounts from two striking miners, Martin and Peter, written in short conversational sentences. The rest of each chapter is written in a more standard style.

==Reception==
The book was awarded the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for literature in 2005.

'''Gene therapy for color blindness''' is an experimental [[gene therapy]] aiming to convert congenitally [[color blindness|colorblind]] individuals to [[trichromacy|trichromats]] by introducing a [[photopigment]] gene that they lack.  Though partial color blindness is considered only a mild disability and is controversial whether it is even a disorder, it is a condition that affects many people, [[Sex linkage|particularly males]]. Complete color blindness, or [[achromatopsia]], is very rare but more severe. While never demonstrated in humans, animal studies have shown that it is possible to confer [[color vision]] by injecting a gene of the missing photopigment using [[gene therapy]].  As of 2018 there is no medical entity offering this treatment, and no clinical trials available for volunteers.

==Color blindness==
{{Main article|Color blindness}} 





The [[retina]] of the [[human eye]] contains photoreceptive cells called [[cone cell|cones]] that allow color vision.  A normal trichromat individual possesses three different types of cones to distinguish different colors within the [[visible spectrum]] from 380&amp;nbsp;nm to 740&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=KandelCh29&gt;{{Cite book| editors= Kandel ER, Schwartz JH, Jessel TM| chapter=Ch. 29: Color Vision |title = Principles of Neural Science| year = 2000| publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional| isbn = 978-0-8385-7701-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The three types of cones are designated L, M, and S cones, and each type is sensitive to a certain range of wavelength of light depending on what photopigment it contains.  More specifically, the L cone absorbs around 560&amp;nbsp;nm, the M cone absorbs near 530&amp;nbsp;nm, and the S cone absorbs near 420&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=KandelCh29/&gt;   Contrary to popular belief, the peak absorption frequency for L, M, and S cones do not exactly correspond to red, green, and blue wavelength.  Rather, the peak frequency for the L cone is orange, yellowish green in M cones, and blue-violet in S cones. These cones [[Transduction (physiology)|transduce]] the absorbed light into electrical information to be relayed to neurons in the retina such as [[Bipolar cell of the retina|retinal bipolar cells]] and [[retinal ganglion cells]], before reaching the [[human brain|brain]].&lt;ref name=KandelCh29/&gt;

The signals from different cones are added or subtracted from each other to process the color of incoming light.  For instance, the color red stimulate L cones more than M cones, whereas the color green stimulates the L and M cones more than the S cones.&lt;ref name=KandelCh29/&gt;  The colors are perceived in an [[opponent process]], such that red and green are perceived in opposition, as are blue and yellow, black and white.&lt;ref name=KandelCh29/&gt;

The gene loci coding for the photopigments: M-[[opsin]] and L-opsin are located in close proximity within the [[X chromosome]] and are highly polymorphic.&lt;ref name=KandelCh29/&gt;  Among the population, some have a deleted gene for the M photopigment in the X chromosome (such as in deuteranopia), whereas others have a mutated form of the gene (such as in deuteranomaly).  Individuals who can express only two types of opsins in the cones are called [[Dichromacy|dichromats]].  Because males have only one copy of the X chromosome, dichromatism is much more prevalent among men.&lt;ref name=KandelCh29/&gt;  With only two types of cones, dichromats are less capable of distinguishing between two colors.  In the most common form of color blindness, deuteranopes have difficulty discriminating between red and green color.&lt;ref name=KandelCh29/&gt;  This is shown by their poor performance in [[Ishihara test]].  Although dichromatism poses little problem for daily life, dichromats may find some color-coded diagrams and maps difficult to read.

Less common forms of dichromacy include protoanopia (lack of L-cones), and tritanopia (lack of S-cones).  If a person lacks two types of photopigments, they are considered [[monochromats]]. People lacking the three types of photopigments are said to have complete color blindness or [[achromatopsia]]. Color blindness can also result from damages to the [[visual cortex]] in the brain.&lt;ref name=KandelCh29/&gt;

==Theory==
Experiments using a variety of mammals (including primates) demonstrated that it is possible to confer color vision to animals by introducing an opsin gene that the animal previously lacked.  Using a replication-defective recombinant [[adeno-associated virus]] (rAAV) as a vector, the [[cDNA]] of the opsin gene found in the L or M cones can be delivered to some fraction of the cones within the retina via subretinal injection.  Upon gaining the gene, the cone begins to express the new photopigment.  The effect of therapy lasts until the cones die or the inserted DNA is lost within the cones.

While gene therapy for humans has been ongoing with some success, a gene therapy for humans to gain color vision has not been attempted to date.  However, demonstrations using several mammals (including primates such as a squirrel monkey) suggest that the therapy should be feasible for humans as well.  It is also theoretically possible for trichromats to be "upgraded" to [[tetrachromats]] by introducing new opsin genes.

==Motivation==
The goal of the gene therapy is to make some of the cones in the retina of a dichromat individual to express the missing photopigment.  Although partial color blindness is considered to be a mild disability and even an advantage under certain circumstances (such as spotting camouflaged objects), it can pose challenges for many occupations such as Law Enforcement, Airline pilot, Railroad workers and military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldeyelasik.com/other-treatments/color-blindness-treatment.html |title=Colour blindness treatment |publisher=World Eye Centers Istanbul |accessdate=2009-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618113537/http://www.worldeyelasik.com/other-treatments/color-blindness-treatment.html |archivedate=2009-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, color codes in maps and figures may be difficult to read for individuals with color blindness.

Because only a single gene codes for a photopigment and the gene is only expressed in the retina, it is a relatively easy condition to treat using gene therapy compared to other genetic diseases.  However, there remains the question of whether the therapy is worthwhile, for an individual to undergo an invasive subretinal injection to temporarily treat a condition that is more of an inconvenience than a disorder.

However, complete color blindness, or [[achromatopsia]], is very rare but more severe. Indeed, achromats cannot see any color, have a strong [[photophobia]] (blindness in full sun), and a reduced visual acuity (generally 20/200 after correction).

Moreover, the research may have strong implications toward genetic therapy of other cone diseases.  Other cone diseases such as [[Leber's congenital amaurosis]], [[cone-rod dystrophy]], and certain types of [[maculopathy|maculopathies]] may be treatable using the same techniques as the gene therapy used for color blindness.&lt;ref&gt;Pang, J.-J., J. Alexander, et al. (2010). Achromatopsia as a Potential Candidate for Gene Therapy: 639-646.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bennett/&gt;

==Research so far==
There has been ongoing research for gene therapy to treat [[Leber's congenital amaurosis]], a genetic disorder in photoreceptors that can lead to vision loss and blindness.  These treatments use AAV vector and is delivered in much the same way as the gene therapy for color blindness.&lt;ref&gt;Bennicelli, J., J. F. Wright, et al. (2008). "Reversal of Blindness in Animal Models of Leber Congenital Amaurosis Using Optimized AAV2-mediated Gene Transfer." Mol Ther 16(3): 458-465.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, S. G. B., Sanford L.; Aleman, Tomas S.; Thomas J. Conlon, Caroline J. Zeiss, Alejandro J. Roman, Artur V. Cideciyan, Sharon B. Schwartz, Andras M. Komaromy, Michelle Doobrajh, Andy Y. Cheung, Alexander Sumaroka, Susan E. Pearce-Kelling, Gustavo D. Aguirre, Shalesh Kaushal, Albert M. Maguire, Terence R. Flotte, William W. Hauswirth. (2006). "Safety in Nonhuman Primates of Ocular AAV2-RPE65, a Candidate Treatment for Blindness in Leber Congenital Amaurosis." Human Gene Therapy 17(8).&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobs et al. published their research in the journal: ''Science'' in 2007, on their work introducing a human L-cone photopigment in [[house mouse|mice]].  Since the mice possess only S cones and M cones, they are dichromats.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, G. H., G. A. Williams, et al. (2007). "Emergence of Novel Color Vision in Mice Engineered to Express a Human Cone Photopigment." ''Science'' 315(5819): 1723-1725.&lt;/ref&gt;  The researchers replaced M-opsin with a cDNA of L-opsin in the X chromosome of some mice.  By breeding these "knock-in" [[transgenic]] mice, they generated heterozygous females with both an M cone and an L cone.  These mice had improved range of color vision and have gained trichromacy, as tested by [[electroretinogram]] and behavioral tests.  However, this is more difficult to apply in the form of gene therapy.

In a paper published in the journal: ''Visual Neuroscience'' by Mauck et al., researchers used recombinant AAV vector to introduce the [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) gene in the cones of [[gerbils]].&lt;ref&gt;Mauck, M. C., K. Mancuso, et al. (2008). "Longitudinal evaluation of expression of virally delivered transgenes in gerbil cone photoreceptors." Visual Neuroscience 25(03): 273-282.&lt;/ref&gt;  The genetic insert was designed to only be expressed in S or M cones, and the study observed the expression of GFP ''in vivo'' over time.  The study characterized the time of onset of expression, and also demonstrated that gene expression could stabilize if a sufficiently high dose of the viral vector is given.

Mancuso et al. published their research in the journal: ''Nature'' in 2009, on converting adult dichromat [[squirrel monkeys]] into trichromats using gene therapy.&lt;ref name=Mancuso&gt;Mancuso, K., W. W. Hauswirth, et al. (2009). "Gene therapy for red‚ and green colour blindness in adult primates." ''Nature'' 461(7265): 784-787.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[New world monkeys]] such as squirrel monkeys lack the L-opsin gene and are incapable of discriminating between certain shades of red and green.&lt;ref name=Mancuso/&gt;  The researchers used recombinant AAV vector to deliver a human L-opsin gene into the monkey’s retina.  Cones that gained the missing genes began expressing the new photopigment.&lt;ref name=Mancuso/&gt;

The researchers raised two possibilities if the therapy worked—that the monkeys would either remain dichromatic with greater sensitivity for longer wavelength of light, or they would become trichromats.&lt;ref name=Mancuso/&gt;  Electroretinogram recordings demonstrated that they are able to discriminate blue-green from red-violet, and have indeed gained trichromacy.&lt;ref name=Mancuso/&gt;  The treated monkeys were also more successful when their color vision was tested with a modified Ishihara test.&lt;ref name=Mancuso/&gt;

In 2007, Alexander JJ et al.&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;Alexander JJ, et al. (2007). "Restoration of cone vision in a mouse model of achromatopsia." Nat. Med. Jun;13(6):685-7. Epub 21 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; used gene therapy to restore some of the sight of mice with [[achromatopsia]]. The results were positive for 80% of the mice treated.
Moreover, a paper by Komáromy et al.,&lt;ref name="Komáromy"&gt;Komáromy, K., et al. (2010). "Gene therapy rescues cone function in congenital achromatopsia." Human Molecular Genetics {{doi|10.1093/hmg/ddq136}} .&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2010, deals with gene therapy for a form of [[achromatopsia]] in dogs. Cone function and day vision have been restored for at least 33 months in two young dogs with achromatopsia. However, this therapy was less efficient for older dogs.

==Theoretical questions==
According to research by [[David H. Hubel]] and [[Torsten Wiesel]], suturing shut one eye of monkeys at an early age resulted in an irreversible [[ocular dominance|loss of vision]] in that eye, even after the suture was removed.&lt;ref name=KandelCh29/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. H. Hubel, T. N. Wiesel, and S. LeVay. Plasticity of Ocular Dominance Columns in Monkey Striate CortexPhil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B April 26, 1977 278:377-409; {{doi|10.1098/rstb.1977.0050}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study concluded that the [[neural circuitry]] for vision is wired during a "critical period" in childhood, after which the visual circuitry can no longer be rewired to process new sensory input.  Contrary to this finding, Mancuso et al.’s success in conferring trichromacy to adult squirrel monkeys suggests that it is possible to adapt the preexisting circuit to allow greater acuity in color vision.  The researchers concluded that integrating the stimulus from the new photopigment as an adult was not analogous to vision loss following visual deprivation.&lt;ref name=Mancuso/&gt;

It is yet unknown how the animals that gain a new photopigment are perceiving the new color.  While the article by Mancuso et al. states that the monkey has indeed gained trichromacy and gained the ability to discriminate between red and green, they claim no knowledge of how the animal internally perceives the sensation.&lt;ref name=Mancuso/&gt;

While red/green color blindness among deuteranopes can be treated by introducing M-opsin genes, rarer forms of color blindness such as tritanopia can in principle be treated as well.  For tritanopia, the S-opsin gene must be introduced instead of M-opsin gene.

==Challenges==
Despite the success in animals, there still remain challenges to conducting gene therapy on humans for treating color blindness.

===Safety===
How to deliver the viral vector into the retina is probably the main obstacle to making gene therapy a practical treatment for color blindness.  Because the virus has to be injected directly by using a needle to penetrate the [[sclera]] of the eye, the treatment may be highly unpleasant and is a risk for eye infection.  Without a way to deliver the virus noninvasively, the treatment is rather risky for the benefit gained.

It is not known yet how frequently the gene needs to be injected to maintain trichromacy among congenitally colorblind individuals.  At the time of publication, Mancuso et al. reports that the treated squirrel monkeys have maintained 2 years of color vision after the treatment.&lt;ref name=Mancuso/&gt;  If repeat injections are needed, there is also the concern of the body developing an immune reaction to the virus.  If a body develops sensitivity to the viral vector, the success of the therapy could be jeopardized and/or the body may respond unfavorably. An editorial by J. Bennett points to Mancuso et al.'s use of an "unspecified postinjection corticosteroid therapy".&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;Bennett J. Gene Therapy for Color Blindness. N Engl J Med. 17 December 2009, 2009;361(25):2483-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bennett suggests that the monkeys may have experienced inflammation due to the injection.&lt;ref name=Bennett/&gt;  However, the AAV virus that is commonly used for this study is non-pathogenic, and the body is less likely to develop an immune reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Grieger JC, Samulski RJ (2005). "Adeno-associated virus as a gene therapy vector: vector development, production and clinical applications". Advances in Biochemical Engineering/biotechnology 99: 119–45. {{doi|10.1007/10_005}}. {{PMID|16568890}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needless to say, an extensive review of the safety of the treatment must precede any human trials.

The subject should first be evaluated to identify which photopigment they need to gain trichromacy.  Also, while gene therapy may treat congenital color blindness (such as dichromacy), it is not intended to treat non-retinal forms of color blindness such as damage to the visual cortex of the brain.

===Ethics===
As a way to introduce new genetic information to change a person’s phenotype, a gene therapy for color blindness is open to the same [[Gene therapy#Problems and ethics|ethical questions]] and criticisms as gene therapy in general.  Given the large number of people with color blindness, there is also the question of whether color blindness is a disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan MJ, Adam A, Mollon JD. "Dichromats detect colour-camouflaged objects that are not detected by trichromats." ''Proc Biol Sci.'' 22 June 1992;248 (1323):291-5. {{PMID|1354367}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, even if gene therapy succeeds in converting incomplete colorblind individuals to trichromats, the degree of satisfaction among the subjects is unknown. It is uncertain how the quality of life will improve (or worsen) after the therapy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1617">In [[probability theory]] and [[statistical mechanics]], a '''Gibbs state''' is an equilibrium probability distribution which remains invariant under future evolution of the system.  For example, a stationary or steady-state distribution of a [[Markov chain]], such as that achieved by running a [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] iteration for a sufficiently long time, is a Gibbs state.

Precisely, suppose &lt;math&gt;L &lt;/math&gt; is a generator of evolutions for an initial state &lt;math&gt;\rho_0 &lt;/math&gt;, so that the state at any later time is given by &lt;math&gt;\rho(t) = e^{L t} [\rho_0] &lt;/math&gt;.  Then the condition for &lt;math&gt;\rho_{\infty} &lt;/math&gt; to be a Gibbs state is

:&lt;math&gt;L [\rho_{\infty}] = 0 &lt;/math&gt; .

In [[physics]] there may be several physically distinct Gibbs states in which a system may be trapped, particularly at lower temperatures. 

They are named after [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]], for his work in determining equilibrium properties of [[statistical ensemble]]s. Gibbs himself referred to this type of statistical ensemble as being in "statistical equilibrium".&lt;ref name="gibbs"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibbs |first=Josiah Willard |authorlink=Josiah Willard Gibbs |title=[[Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics|Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics, developed with especial reference to the rational foundation of thermodynamics]] |year=1902 |publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]] |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Graphic communication''' as the name suggests is [[communication]] using [[graphic]] elements. These elements include symbols such as [[glyph]]s and [[icon (computing)|icon]]s, images such as drawings and photographs, and can include the passive contributions of [[substrate (printing)|substrate]], color and surroundings. It is the process of creating, producing, and distributing material incorporating [[word]]s and [[image]]s to convey [[data]], [[concept]]s, and [[emotion]]s.&lt;ref name="GCC08"&gt;[http://teched.vt.edu/GCC/HTML/VirtualTextbook/VirtualArticles/DefinitionOfGraphicComm.html Definition of Graphic Communications] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306143724/http://www.teched.vt.edu/gcc/HTML/VirtualTextbook/VirtualArticles/DefinitionOfGraphicComm.html |date=2008-03-06 }} GRAPHIC COMM CENTRAL, 2008. Accessed 25 Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of graphic communications encompasses all phases of the graphic communications processes from origination of the idea (design, layout, and typography) through reproduction, finishing and distribution of two- or three-dimensional products or electronic transmission.&lt;ref name="GCC08"/&gt;

== Overview ==
Graphic communication involves the use of visual material to relate ideas such as [[drawings]], [[photograph]]s, [[Photographic slide|slide]]s, and [[Sketch (drawing)|sketch]]es. The drawings of plans and refinements and a rough map sketched to show the way could be considered graphical communication.

Any medium that uses a [[graphics]] to aid in conveying a [[message]], [[Education|instruction]], or an [[idea]] is involved in graphical communication. One of the most widely used forms of graphical communication is the [[drawing]].&lt;ref&gt;David L. Goetsch et al. (1999). ''Technical Drawing''. {{ISBN|0-7668-0531-X}}. p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest graphics known to anthropologists studying prehistoric periods are [[cave paintings]] and markings on boulders, bone, ivory, and antlers, which were created during the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period from 40,000–10,000 [[Before Christ|B.C.]] or earlier. Many of these played a major role in [[geometry]]. They used graphics to represent their mathematical theories such as the Circle Theorem and the [[Pythagorean theorem]].

== Graphic communication topics ==
=== Graphics ===
[[Graphics]] are visual presentations on some surface, such as a wall, [[canvas]], computer screen, paper, or stone to [[brand]], inform, illustrate, or entertain. Examples are [[photograph]]s, [[drawings]], [[line art]], [[graphics|graphs]], [[diagrams]], [[typography]], [[number]]s, [[symbols]], [[geometric]] designs, [[map]]s, [[engineering drawings]], or other [[image]]s. Graphics often combine [[character (computer)|text]], [[illustration]], and [[color]]. [[Graphic design]] may consist of the deliberate selection, creation, or arrangement of typography alone, as in a brochure, flier, poster, web site, or book without any other element. Clarity or effective communication may be the objective, association with other cultural elements may be sought, or merely, the creation of a distinctive style.

Graphics can be functional or artistic. The latter can be a recorded version, such as a photograph, or an interpretation by a scientist to highlight essential features, or an artist, in which case the distinction with imaginary graphics may become blurred.

=== Communication ===
[[Communication]] is the process whereby information is imparted by a sender to a receiver via a [[media (communication)|medium]]. It requires that all parties have an area of communicative commonality. There are [[Sound|auditory]] means, such as speaking, singing and sometimes tone of voice, and [[nonverbal communication|nonverbal]], physical means, such as [[body language]], [[sign language]], [[paralanguage]], [[Haptic perception|touch]], [[eye contact]], by using [[writing]]. Communication is defined as a process by which we assign and [[convey]] meaning in an attempt to create shared understanding.  This process requires a vast repertoire of skills in [[intrapersonal]] and [[interpersonal]] processing, listening, observing, speaking, questioning, analyzing, and evaluating. if you use these processes it is developmental and transfers to all areas of life: home, school, community, work, and beyond. It is through communication that [[collaboration]] and [[cooperation]] occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Communication |work=office of superintendent of Public instruction |location=Washington |url=http://www.k12.wa.us/CurriculumInstruct/Communications/default.aspx |accessdate=March 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual communication ===
[[Visual communication]] as the name suggests is [[communication]] through visual aid. It is the conveyance of ideas and information in forms that can be read or looked upon. Primarily associated with [[Dimension|two dimensional]] images, it includes: [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], [[typography]], [[drawing]], [[graphic design]], [[illustration]], colour and electronic resources. It solely relies on vision. It is a form of [[communication]] with visual effect. It explores the idea that a visual message with text has a greater power to inform, educate or [[persuade]] a person.  It is communication by presenting information through Visual form. The evaluation of a good visual design is based on measuring comprehension by the audience, not on aesthetic or artistic preference.  There are no universally agreed-upon principles of beauty and ugliness.  There exists a variety of ways to present information visually, like [[gestures]], body languages, video and TV. Here, focus is on the presentation of text, pictures, diagrams, photos, et cetera, integrated on a computer display. The term visual presentation is used to refer to the actual presentation of information. Recent research in the field has focused on [[web design]] and graphically oriented usability. [[Graphic designers]] use methods of visual communication in their professional practice.

=== Communication design ===
[[Communication design]] is a mixed discipline between design and information-development which is concerned with how  intermission such as [[printing|printed]], [[craft]]ed, [[electronic media]] or [[presentations]] communicate with people. A communication design approach is not only concerned with developing the [[message]] aside from the [[aesthetic]]s in media, but also with creating new media channels to ensure the message reaches the target audience. Communication design seeks to attract, inspire, create desires and motivate the people to respond to messages, with a view to making a favorable impact to the bottom line of the commissioning body, which can be either to build a brand, move sales, or for humanitarian purposes. Its process involves strategic [[business]] thinking, utilizing [[market research]], [[creativity]], and [[problem-solving]].

=== Graphic design ===
The term [[graphic design]] can refer to a number of artistic and professional disciplines which focus on visual communication and presentation.  Various methods are used to create and combine symbols, images and/or words to create a visual representation of ideas and messages. A graphic designer may use [[typography]], [[visual arts]] and [[page layout]] techniques to produce the final result.  Graphic design often refers to both the process (designing) by which the communication is created and the products (designs) which are generated.

Common uses of graphic design include magazines, advertisements, product packaging and web design.  For example, a product package might include a logo or other artwork, organized text and pure design elements such as shapes and color which unify the piece.  [[Composition (visual arts)|Composition]] is one of the most important features of graphic design especially when using pre-existing materials or diverse elements.

=== Graphical representation ===
The term representation, according to O'Shaughnessy and Stadler (2005), can carry a range of meanings and interpretations. In [[literary theory]] representation is commonly defined in three ways.
#To look like or resemble
#To stand in for something or someone
#To present a second time to re-present&lt;ref name=Stadler2005&gt;O'Shaughnessy, M &amp; Stadler J, ''Media and society: an introduction'', 3rd edn, Oxford University Press, South Melbourne, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Representation, according to Mitchell (1995), began with early literary theory in the ideas of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], and has evolved into a significant component of language, [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurian]] and [[communication]] studies. Aristotle discusses representation in three ways:&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995&gt;Mitchell, W. 1995, "Representation", in F Lentricchia &amp; T McLaughlin (eds), ''Critical Terms for Literary Study'', 2nd edn, University of Chicago Press, Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''The object:'' The symbol being represented.
# ''Manner:'' The way the symbol is represented.
# ''Means:'' The material that is used to represent it.
The ''means'' of literary representation is [[language]]. The means of graphical representation are [[graphics]]. Graphical representation of data is one of the most commonly used modes of presentation.
The purpose of graphical communication is transfer message or information to the receiver in effective way.when professional organizations prepare reports then usually use the mode of graphical presentations.

Since reports of the [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) began to emerge in the [[United States]] in the 1980s, the HIV epidemic has frequently been linked to [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and other [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM) by epidemiologists and medical professionals. The first official report on the virus was published by the [[Center for Disease Control]] (CDC) on June 5, 1981 and detailed the cases of five young gay men who were hospitalised with serious infections.&lt;ref&gt;CDC (1981, 5th June) 'Pheumocystis Pneumonia - Los Angeles', MMWR, Vol. 30.                        No. 21. https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/june_5.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, The New York Times reported that 41 homosexuals had been diagnosed with [[Kaposi’s Sarcoma]], and eight had died less than 24 months after the diagnosis was made.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times (1981, 3rd July) "Rare cancer seen in 41 homosexuals" https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/03/us/rare-cancer-seen-in-41-homosexuals.html?&amp;pagewanted=2&lt;/ref&gt; By 1982, the condition was referred to in the medical community as ([[Gay-related immune deficiency]] (GRID), "gay cancer," and "gay compromise syndrome."&lt;ref&gt;Oswald, G.A, et al (1982) 'Attempted immune stimulation in the "gay compromise syndrome"'. BMJ, 1982 October 16; 285(6348): 1082.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until July 1982 that the term [[Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome]] (AIDS) was suggested to replace GRID,&lt;ref&gt;Grmek, M.D. (1990) 'History of AIDS: Emergence and origin of a modern pandemic', New Jersey: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and even then it was not until September that the CDC first used the AIDS acronym in an official report.&lt;ref&gt;MMWR Weekly (1982) 'Current Trends Update on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) – United States', September 24, 31(37); 507-508, 513-514.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now well understood that HIV does not only affect the [[gay community]] but can also infect anybody, regardless of sex, ethnicity, or [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="UNAIDS"&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 AIDS epidemic update |publisher=Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and World Health Organization |date=November 2009 |url=http://www.unaids.org/en/dataanalysis/epidemiology/2009aidsepidemicupdate |accessdate=September 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928011837/http://www.unaids.org/en/dataanalysis/epidemiology/2009aidsepidemicupdate/ |archivedate=September 28, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, HIV still severely affects MSM across the globe.  MSM are only a small percentage of the U.S. population, but they are consistently the population group most affected by the HIV/AIDS virus and are the largest proportion of American citizens with an AIDS diagnosis who have died.&lt;ref name="Disease Control 2010"&gt;Center for Disease Control. “HIV among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM)” (2010). Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations estimates that 2 to 20% of MSM are infected with HIV, depending on the region they live in.&lt;ref name="data.unaids.org"&gt;Men who have sex with men, HIV prevention and care” Geneva, November 2005. UNAIDS. http://data.unaids.org/pub/Report/2006/jc1233-msm-meetingreport_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Men who have sex with men}}
Men who have sex with men (abbreviated as '''MSM''', also known as '''males who have sex with males''') are [[male|male person]]s who engage in sexual activity with members of the same sex, regardless of how they personally identify themselves. Many MSM choose not to (or cannot for other reasons) identify as [[homosexual]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNAIDS: Men who have sex with men |publisher=UNAIDS |url=http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/dataimport/pub/briefingnote/2006/20060801_policy_brief_msm_en.pdf |accessdate=October 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320001221/http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/dataimport/pub/briefingnote/2006/20060801_policy_brief_msm_en.pdf |archivedate=March 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the label excludes men who identify as gay or bisexual, but who have never had sex with another man, including many gay teenagers.

The terms MSM and women who have sex with women (WSW) have been used in medical scholarship since at least 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Rebecca M. and Ilan H. Meyer. “The Trouble With “MSM” and "WSW”: Erasure of the Sexual-Minority Person in Public Health Discourse.” Am J Public Health. (2005) 95: 1144–1149.&lt;/ref&gt; But, the term has been attributed to Glick ''et al.'', because their usage in a 1994 study solidified the concept in medical terminology.&lt;ref name="Young Meyer"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Young RM, Meyer IH |title=The trouble with "MSM" and "WSW": erasure of the sexual-minority person in public health discourse |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=95 |issue=7 |pages=1144–1149 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15961753 |pmc=1449332 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.046714 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Glick M, Muzyka BC, Salkin LM, Lurie D |title=Necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis: a marker for immune deterioration and a predictor for the diagnosis of AIDS |journal=J.

Meyer. “The Trouble With “MSM” and “WSW”: Erasure of the Sexual-Minority Person in Public Health Discourse.” Am J Public Health. (2005) 95: 1144–1149.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographics===
Determining the number of men who have ever had sex with another man is difficult worldwide. The World Health Organization estimates that at least 3% and as high as 16% of men have had sex at least once with a man. Their estimate includes victims of sexual abuse in addition to men who regularly or voluntarily have sex with men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
| url = http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/vct/sw_toolkit/Between_men_full_version.pdf
| title = Between Men – HIV/STI prevention for men who have sex with men
| page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations estimates that 6-20% of men worldwide have sex with other men at some point during their lifetime.&lt;ref name="Geneva 2005"&gt;“Men who have sex with men, HIV prevention and care” Geneva, November 2005. UNAIDS. http://data.unaids.org/pub/Report/2006/jc1233-msm-meetingreport_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates about the U.S. population of MSM vary. The Center for Disease Control estimates that men who have sex with men represent about 2% of the American population.&lt;ref name="Disease Control 2010"/&gt; A 2005 study estimates that among U.S. men aged 15 to 44, an estimated 6% of have engaged in oral or anal sex with another man at some point in their lives, and about 2.9% have had at least one male partner in the previous 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Of these men, 71% are White, 15.9% are Hispanic, and 8.9% are black. The percentage of men who were MSM varied by state, with the lowest percentage in South Dakota (3.3%) and the highest in the District of Columbia (13.2%).  However, the same study found that 57% of men who have sex with men identify as bisexual or straight.&lt;ref&gt;Lieb, S., Fallon, S., Friedman, S., Thompson, D., Gates, G., Liberti, T., &amp; Malow, R. (2011). Statewide estimation of racial/ethnic populations of men who have sex with men in the U.S. PubMed, 126(1), 60-72.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 Study estimated that 2.6% had engaged in same-sex behavior in the past year, 4.0% in the past five years, and 7.0% at any point in their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Purcell, D.W., C Johnson, A Lansky, J Prejean, R Stein, P Denning, Z Gaul, H Weinstock, J Su, &amp; N Crepaz.  “Calculating HIV and Syphilis Rates for Risk Groups: Estimating the National Population Size of Men Who Have Sex with Men” Latebreaker #22896 Presented March 10, 2010. 2010 National STD Prevention Conference; Atlanta, GA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==HIV infection rates==

The CDC reported  that in 2009 that male-to-male sex (MSM)  accounted for 61% of all new HIV infections in the U.S. and that those who had a history of recreational [[drug injection]] accounted for an additional 3% of new infections. Among the approximately 784,701 people living with an HIV diagnosis, 396,810 (51%) were MSM. About 48% of MSM living with an HIV diagnosis were white, 30% were black, and 19% were Hispanic or Latino. Although the majority of MSM are white,  non-whites accounted for 54% of new infections HIV related MSM infections in 2008.&lt;ref name="Disease Control 2010"/&gt;

In 2010  the CDC reported that MSM represented approximately 4 percent of the male population in the United States but male-to-male sex accounted for 78 percent  of new HIV infections among men and 63 percent of all new infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DECEMBER 2012 2 HIV Infections by Route  of Transmission|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/2012/hiv-infections-2007-2010.pdf|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men overall accounted for 76% of all adults and adolescents living with HIV infection at the end of 2010 in the United States, and 80% (38,000) of the estimated 47,500 new HIV infections.  69% of men  living with HIV were gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men.  39% (14,700) of new HIV infections in US men were in blacks, 35% (13,200) were in whites, and 22% (8,500) were in Hispanics/Latinos.  The rate of estimated new HIV infections among black men (per 100,000) was 103.6—six and a half times that of white men (15.8) and more than twice the rate among Hispanic/Latino men (45.5) as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV Among Men in the United States|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/gender/men/index.html|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDC (2015) reported  that gay and bisexual men accounted for 82% (26,375 out of 1,242,000 adults and adolescents) of HIV diagnoses among males and 67% of all diagnoses in the United States, while six percent (2,392) of HIV diagnoses were attributed to injection drug use (IDU) and another 3% (1,202) to male-to-male sexual contact plus IDU.  Heterosexual contact accounted for 24% (9,339) of all HIV diagnoses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV in the United States: At A Glance|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/statistics/overview/ataglance.html|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among all gay and bisexual men with HIV infection classified as AIDS in the United States in 2015, African Americans accounted for the highest number (3,928; 39%), followed by whites (3,096; 31%) and Hispanics/Latinos (2,430; 24%). At the end of 2014, 508,676 gay and bisexual men were living with diagnosed HIV infection (53% of everyone living with diagnosed HIV in the US). Of gay and bisexual men living with diagnosed HIV, 157,758 (31%) were African American, 212,558 (42%) were white, and 109,857 (22%) were Hispanic/Latino. From 2005 to 2014 diagnoses among African American gay and bisexual men increased 22% but has increased less than 1% between 2010 and 2014.

A 2010 study estimated that for every 100,000 MSM, 692 will be diagnosed with HIV. This makes MSM 60 times more likely to contract the virus than other men and 54 times more likely than women.&lt;ref&gt;Purcell, D.W., C Johnson, A Lansky, J Prejean, R Stein, P Denning, Z Gaul, H Weinstock, J Su, &amp; N Crepaz.

Since its height in 1993-1994 the death rate due to HIV  has fallen more than 9 other leading causes of death, yet as of 2013 HIV continues to be one of the 10  leading causes of death among persons 25-44, especially among men, African Americans and in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mortality Slide Series|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/library/slidesets/cdc-hiv-epa5-mortality-slides-2013.pdf|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also as regards HIV relation to mortality, a study  in the [[United Kingdom]]   reported that in 2008 the overall mortality rate among the HIV-diagnosed  population aged 15–59 years remained more than five times higher than that in the general population. However, as the study acknowledges  data  on  the  impact  of  HIV/AIDS  on  mortality among  gay and bisexual men as well as  among other populations, is very limited, and  methods to use  this are  problematic.&lt;ref name="wiley.com"&gt;Wiley Online Library: [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hiv.12045/pdf Ten-year mortality trends among persons diagnosed with HIV infection in England and Wales in the era of antiretroviral therapy: AIDS remains a silent killer - Simmons - 2013 - HIV Medicine - Wiley Online Library], accessdate: April 2, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk factors==
A 2007 study analyzing two large population surveys found that "the majority of gay men had similar numbers of unprotected sexual partners annually as straight men and women."&lt;ref name=MedicalNews&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/82330.php Sexual Behavior Does Not Explain Varying HIV Rates Among Gay And Straight Men]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goodreau SM, Golden MR |title=Biological and demographic causes of high HIV and sexually transmitted disease prevalence in men who have sex with men |journal=Sex Transm Infect |volume=83 |issue=6 |pages=458–462 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17855487 |pmc=2598698 |doi=10.1136/sti.2007.025627}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2006 study found that men who reported 4 or more male sexual partners were at increased risk of HIV infection. Study participants who reported amphetamine or heavy alcohol use before sex were more likely to have HIV or other sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref name="BA Koblin. 2006"&gt;BA Koblin. “Risk factors for HIV infection among men who have sex with men” (2006) AIDS, 20. 731-739.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Kaiser Family Foundation study indicated that fewer Americans view HIV as a top health priority today compared to ten years ago. In 1996, 25% of Americans viewed HIV as an “urgent problem” to their community but in 2009, only 17% listed it as “urgent.” The percentage of 18- to 29-year-olds that were personally concerned about contracting the virus dropped from 28% in 1995 to 17% in 2009 &lt;ref&gt;Kaiser Family Foundation. (2009) “2009 Survey of Americans on HIV/AIDS: summary of findings on the domestic epidemic.”&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted in 6 major U.S. cities found that only one in 4 teenage men who have sex with men believed they were personally at risk for contracting the HIV virus.&lt;ref&gt;MacKellar DA, Valleroy LA, Secura GM, et al. (2007) Perceptions of lifetime risk and actual risk for acquiring HIV among young men who have sex with men. AIDS Behav:263-270.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unprotected anal intercourse===

The HIV virus is more easily transmitted through unprotected [[anal intercourse]] than through unprotected [[vaginal intercourse]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.avert.org/men-sex-men.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and men who report unprotected receptive anal intercourse are at increased risk of contracting the HIV virus.&lt;ref name="BA Koblin. 2006"/&gt; Generally, the receptive partner is at greater risk of contracting the HIV virus because the lining of the rectum is thin and may allow the virus to enter the body through semen exchange. The insertive partner is also at risk because STIs can enter through the [[urethra]] or through small cuts, abrasions, or open sores on the penis. Also, condoms are more likely to break during anal sex than during vaginal sex. Thus, even with a condom, anal sex can be risky.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/qa/qa22.htm Center for Disease Control; "Can I get HIV from anal sex?"]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 study of HIV positive men found men who had unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) in the past year were put at risk for contracting the virus. The study found that men who reported engaging in UAI had increased from 30% in 1996 to 42% in 2000. Almost half of all men who participated in UAI in 1996-1997 said that they had not known the HIV status of their partner &lt;ref&gt;Dodds, J.P., D.E. Mercey, J.V. Parry &amp; A.M. Johnson. (2004) Increasing risk behaviour and high levels of undiagnosed HIV infection in a community sample of homosexual men. Sex Transm Infect; 80:236-240&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found that risk factors for HIV infection are anal intercourse with a man in the past 12 months, having unstable housing, and having inhaled [[alkyl nitrites]] (“poppers”).&lt;ref&gt;Mimiaga, M., Reisner, S., Cranston, K., Isenberg, D., Bright, D., Daffin, G., Bland, S., &amp; Driscoll, M. (2009). Sexual mixing patterns and partner characteristics of black msm in Massachusetts at increased risk for HIV infection and transmission. Journal of Urban Health, 86(4), 602-623.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study on the prevalence of unprotected anal intercourse among HIV-diagnosed MSM found that majority protected their partners during sexual activity, but a sizeable number of men continue to engage in sexual behaviors that place themselves and others at risk for HIV infections.&lt;ref&gt;Crepaz, Nicole, Marks, Gary; Liau, Adrian; Mullins, Mary M; Aupont, Latrina W; Marshall, Khiya J; Jacobs, Elizabeth D; Wolitski, Richard J; (2009) “Prevalence of unprotected anal intercourse among HIV-diagnosed MSM in the United States: a meta-analysis”, AIDS, 80, 23:1617-1629&lt;/ref&gt;

===Condom fatigue===
Although HIV transmission rates fell throughout the 1990s, they hit a plateau at the end of the decade. The increasing rates of sexually transmitted diseases in major cities in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom led to reports in the gay and mainstream media of [[condom fatigue]] and "AIDS optimism" as causes of the new "laxness" in safe sex practices.&lt;ref name="Adam, Barry D. 2005"&gt;Adam, Barry D., Winston Husbands, James Murray, and John Maxwell. (2005): AIDS optimism, condom fatigue, or self-esteem? Explaining unsafe sex among gay and bisexual men, Journal of Sex Research, 42:3, 238-248&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by research on the tendency of couples (heterosexual or homosexual) to use [[condoms]] less over time.&lt;ref&gt;Appleby, P., Miller, L., &amp; Rothspan, S. (1999). The paradox of trust for male couples. Personal Relationships, 6, 81-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bochow, M. (1998). The importance of contextualizing research. In M. Wright, B. R. S. Rosser, &amp; O. de Zwart (Eds.), New international direc- tions in HIV prevention for gay and bisexualmen. New York: Harrington Park Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cusick, L., &amp; Rhodes, T. (2000).

Interpretations of condom use and nonuse among young Norwegian gay men. Medical Anthropology Quarterly, 15(1), 58-83.&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2010 study found that gay and bisexual men choose to have unprotected sex for a variety of reasons and cannot be generalized. [[Erectile dysfunction]], mental health problems and [[Mood disorder|depression]], lack of communication or intimacy, and a [[subculture]] of unprotected sex were all listed as reasons why men had sex without condoms voluntarily.&lt;ref name="Adam, Barry D. 2005"/&gt;

==Prevention==
In the late 1980s the first direct advocacy groups for people with HIV/AIDS were created. Notably, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power ([[ACT UP]]) formed at the [[Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center]] in New York in the wake of the antiretroviral drug [[Zidovudine|AZT]] to petition better access to drugs as well as cheaper prices, public education about AIDS and the prohibition of AIDS-related discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;ACT UP New York: Capsule History - 1988, [http://www.actupny.org/documents/cron-88.html Actupny.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) published a paper in 2005 offering specific policy solutions for alleviating the spread of the HIV virus in the MSM population for specific regions around the world. They pointed to “a profound lack of knowledge” and stigma about sexual identity as worldwide barriers to preventing transmission and encouraging those infected to seek treatment. The UNAIDS program has recommended that the South African government implement “sex positive” policies to reduce societal stigma around homosexuality and promote the use of water-based lubricants. Particularly in Morocco, the program has advocated distributing condoms in prisons. In recent years, the Chinese government has begun to acknowledge the sexuality of its constituents. According to UNAIDS, the “Government has made significant progress in recognizing the issue of male-to-male sexual health and HIV.” In Latin America, outreach to rural areas is critical to ensuring care to all individuals. The United Nations also emphasizes a focus on LGBT populations that are most vulnerable in Latin American nations. In Jamaica, as in many countries across the globe, homosexuality is outlawed so there are unique challenges to HIV prevention in the MSM community. The UN is trying to implement community-based strategies in Jamaica while still ensuring the anonymity of the people served. In Norway, UNAIDS has observed an increasing number of MSM who have untreated sexually transmitted infections, and their emphasis is on promoting condom use within the gay community. Despite Canada’s “liberal and progressive” reputation on the world stage, HIV-related stigma is still related to the gay community. The United Nations believes the United States needs to recognize [[sexual education]] as a fundamental human right. Additionally, better research on MSM in the U.S. would positively affect funding for HIV prevention and treatment programs.&lt;ref name="Geneva 2005"/&gt;

Studies have shown that although there is a large market for vaginal microbicides in developing nations, rectal microbicides are stigmatized and less researched. No microbicide has yet been proven to effectively protect against the risks of unprotected anal intercourses, but advocates believe greater funding for research is needed since condom usage rates are so low. However, stigma and homophobia would potentially be barriers to individuals buying the product. The authors mention this is especially a concern in Caribbean countries where HIV prevalence is high but homosexuality is still illegal and highly stigmatized (See [[HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean]].) &lt;ref&gt;

===Access to testing===
UNAIDS has observed “sero-selection” (choosing a partner based on their HIV status) becoming increasingly prevalent in partner choice and transmission in the United States.&lt;ref name="data.unaids.org"/&gt; A 2008 CDC study found that one in five (19%) of MSM in major U.S. cities were infected with HIV and almost half (44%) were unaware of their infection.&lt;ref name="Disease Control 2010"/&gt; Many HIV-infected individuals do not seek treatment until late in their infection (an estimated 42% do not seek treatment until they begin to experience signs of illness.) Furthermore, a significant portion of individuals who are tested for HIV never return for their test results. Studies have advocated for funding and implementation of HIV tests that can be administered outside medical settings since 2003. Home testing is considered especially important because 8%-39% of partners tested in studies of partner counseling and referral services (PCRS) were found to have a previously undiagnosed HIV infection that their partner was unaware of.&lt;ref&gt;R. S. Janssen, M.D., I. M. Onorato, M.D., R. O. Valdiserri, M.D., T. M. Durham, M.S., W. P. Nichols, M.P.A., E. M. Seiler, M.P.A., H. W. Jaffe, M.D. “Advancing HIV Prevention: New Strategies for a Changing Epidemic -- United States, 2003” (2003) The Body Pro: HIV Resource for Health Professionals.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, OraQuick, the first rapid HIV home-testing kit, went on sale for $40. The test is nearly 100% accurate when it predicts HIV-negative results for HIV-negative individuals. However, for HIV-positive individuals that are not yet producing the antibodies detected by the test, it produces a false negative 93% of the time. Although the manufacturer, OraSure Technologies, is not advertising the test for use for selection of partners,  experts have suggested that it may prevent unprotected sexual contact with partners that lie about or are unaware of their HIV status.&lt;ref name="Donald G. 2012"&gt;McNeil Jr., Donald G. “Another Use for Rapid Home H.I.V. Test: Screening Sexual Partners.” The New York Times. October 5th, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study examined how the OraQuick test would identify the behavior of 27 self-identified gay men who frequently had unprotected sex with acquaintances. The researchers gave each participant 16 tests to use over the course of three months. 101 potential partners were tested, and 10 were positive. None of the participants had sex with someone who tested positive.  23 other potential partners refused testing and left the encounter. 2 men admitted they were HIV-positive. Most participants said they would continue using home tests after the study ended to test potential partners on their own. The researchers considered home testing to be an effective prevention method for high-risk groups.&lt;ref&gt;Carballo-Dieguez, Alex, Timothy Frasca, Ivan Balan, Mobolaji Ibitoye, and Curtis Dolezal. “Use of a Rapid HIV Home Test Prevents HIV Exposure in a High Risk Sample of Men Who Have Sex With Men.” AIDS and Behavior. Volume 16, Number 7 (2012), 1753-1760.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the test’s $40 cost is considered a major deterrent to commonplace partner testing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29259">'''[[Aerodynamics]]''' is a branch of [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] concerned with the study of the motion of [[air]].  It is a sub-field of [[fluid dynamics|fluid]] and [[gas dynamics]], and the term "aerodynamics" is often used when referring to gas dynamics.

Early records of fundamental aerodynamics concepts date back to the work of [[Aristotle]] and [[Archimedes]] in the 2nd and 3rd centuries BC, but efforts to develop a quantitative theory of air flow did not begin until the 18th century.  In 1726, [[Isaac Newton]] became one of the first aerodynamicists in the modern sense when he developed a theory of air resistance, which was later verified for low flow speeds.  Air resistance experiments were performed by investigators throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, aided by the construction of the first [[wind tunnel]] in 1871.  In his 1738 publication ''Hydrodynamica'', [[Daniel Bernoulli]] described a fundamental relationship between pressure, velocity, and density, now termed [[Bernoulli's principle]], which provides one method of calculating [[Lift (force)|lift]].

Aerodynamics work throughout the 19th century sought to achieve [[heavier-than-air]] flight.  [[George Cayley]] developed the concept of the modern fixed-wing aircraft in 1799, and in doing so identified the four fundamental forces of flight - [[Lift (force)|lift]], [[thrust]], [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]], and [[weight]].  The development of reasonable predictions of the thrust needed to power flight in conjunction with the development of high-lift, low-drag airfoils paved the way for the first powered flight.  On December 17, 1903, [[Wright brothers|Wilbur and Orville Wright]] flew the first successful powered aircraft.  The flight, and the publicity it received, led to more organized collaboration between aviators and aerodynamicists, leading the way to modern aerodynamics.

Theoretical advances in aerodynamics were made parallel to practical ones.  The relationship described by Bernoulli was found to be valid only for incompressible, inviscid flow.  In 1757, [[Leonhard Euler]] published the [[Euler equations]], extending Bernoulli's principle to the compressible flow regime.  In the early 19th century, the development of the [[Navier-Stokes equations]] extended the Euler equations to account for [[viscosity|viscous]] effects.  During the time of the first flights, several investigators developed independent theories connecting [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|flow circulation]] to lift.  [[Ludwig Prandtl]] became one of the first people to investigate [[boundary layer]]s during this time.

==Early aerodynamic thought - antiquity to the 19th century==
[[Image:Design for a Flying Machine.jpg|thumb|A drawing of a design for a flying machine by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (c. 1488). This machine was an [[ornithopter]], with flapping wings similar to those of a bird, first presented in his [[Codex on the Flight of Birds]] in 1505.]]

===Theoretical foundations===
Although the modern theory of aerodynamic science did not emerge until the 18th century, its foundations began to emerge in ancient times.  The fundamental aerodynamics [[Aerodynamics#Continuum assumption|continuity assumption]] has its origins in Aristotle's ''Treatise on the Heavens'', although [[Archimedes]], working in the 3rd century BC, was the first person to formally assert that a fluid could be treated as a continuum.{{sfn |Anderson|1997|p = 17}}  Archimedes also introduced the concept that fluid flow was driven by a pressure gradient within the fluid.{{sfn|Anderson|1997|pp = 18-19}}&lt;ref name="ackroyd"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Ackroyd | first1 = J. A. D. | last2 = Axcell | first2 = B. P. | last3 = Ruban | first3 = A. I. | title = Early Developments of Modern Aerodynamics | location = Reston, Virginia | publisher = [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] | year = 2001 | isbn = 1-56347-516-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This idea would later prove fundamental to the understanding of fluid flow.

In 1687, Newton's ''Principia'' presented [[Newton's laws of motion]], the first complete theoretical approach to understanding mechanical phenomena.  In particular, [[Newton's second law]], a statement of the [[conservation of momentum]], is one of three fundamental physical principles used to obtain the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] and [[Navier-Stokes equations]].

In 1738, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-[[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[mathematician]] [[Daniel Bernoulli]] published ''Hydrodynamica'', in which he described the fundamental relationship between pressure and velocity, known today as [[Bernoulli's principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/658890/Hydrodynamica#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=Hydrodynamica%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia | title= Hydrodynamica | accessdate=2008-10-30 |publisher= Britannica Online Encyclopedia }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This states that the pressure of a flowing fluid decreases as its velocity increases and as such was a significant early advance in the theory of [[fluid dynamics]], and was first quantified in an equation derived by [[Leonhard Euler]].{{sfn|Anderson|1997|47}}  This expression, often called [[Bernoulli's principle#Derivations of Bernoulli's equation|Bernoulli's Equation]], relates the pressure, density, and velocity at two points along a streamline within a flowing fluid as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;{v_1^2 \over 2}+{p_1\over\rho} = {v_2^2 \over 2}+{p_2\over\rho}&lt;/math&gt;

Bernoulli's Equation ignores compressibility of the fluid, as well as the effects of [[gravity]] and viscous forces on the flow.  [[Leonhard Euler]] would go on to publish the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] in 1757, which are valid for both compressible and incompressible flows. The Euler equations were extended to incorporate the effects of viscosity in the first half of the 1800s, resulting in the [[Navier–Stokes equations|Navier-Stokes equations]].

===Studies of air resistance===
[[Image:Governableparachute.jpg|thumb|left|A drawing of a glider by [[Sir George Cayley]], one of the early attempts at creating an aerodynamic shape.]]

The retarding effect of air on a moving object was among the earliest aerodynamic phenomena to be explored.  Aristotle wrote about [[Aerodynamic drag|air resistance]] in the 4th century BC,&lt;ref name = "ackroyd"/&gt; but lacked the understanding to quantify the resistance he observed.  In fact, Aristotle paradoxically suggested that the movement of air around a thrown spear both resisted its motion and propelled it forward.{{sfn|Anderson|1997|pp=16-17}}  In the 15th century, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] published the ''Codex Leicester'', in which he rejected Aristotle's theory and attempted to prove that the only effect of air on a thrown object was to resist its motion,{{sfn|Anderson|1997|p=25}} and that air resistance was proportional to flow speed, a false conclusion which was supported by Galileo's 17th century observations of pendulum motion decay.&lt;ref name="ackroyd" /&gt;  In addition to his work on drag, da Vinci was the first person to record a number of aerodynamic ideas including correctly describing the circulation of vortices and the [[Aerodynamics#Mass continuity|continuity principle]] as applied to channel flow.&lt;ref name="ackroyd"/&gt;

The true quadratic dependency of drag on velocity was experimentally proven independently by [[Edme Mariotte]] and [[Christiaan Huygens]], both members of the Paris Academy of Sciences, in the late 17th century.{{sfn|Anderson|1997|pp=32-35}} [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] later became the first person to theoretically derive this quadratic dependence of air resistance in the early 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Newton, I. | title=Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, Book II | year=1726}}&lt;/ref&gt; making him one of the first theoretical aerodynamicists.  Newton stated that drag was proportional to the dimensions of a body, the density of the fluid, and the square of the air velocity, a relationship which was demonstrated to be correct for low flow speeds, but stood in direct conflict with Galileo's earlier findings.  The discrepancy between the work of Newton, Mariotte, and Huygens, and Galileo's earlier work was not resolved until advances in viscous flow theory in the 20th century.

Newton also developed a law for the drag force on a flat plate inclined towards the direction of the fluid flow.  Using ''F'' for the drag force, ''ρ'' for the density, ''S'' for the area of the flat plate, ''V'' for the flow velocity, and ''θ'' for the angle of attack, his law was expressed as:  
:&lt;math&gt;F = \rho SV^2 \sin^2 (\theta) &lt;/math&gt;
This equation overestimates drag in most cases, and was often used in the 19th century to argue the impossibility of human flight.&lt;ref name="ackroyd" /&gt;  At low inclination angles, drag depends linearly on the sin of the angle, not quadratically.  However, Newton's flat plate drag law yields reasonable drag predictions for supersonic flows or very slender plates at large inclination angles which lead to flow separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=von Karman, Theodore | title=Aerodynamics: Selected Topics in the Light of Their Historical Development | publisher=Dover Publications | year=2004 | isbn=0-486-43485-0 | oclc=53900531}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Anderson|1997|p=40}}

Air resistance experiments were carried out by investigators throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Drag theories were developed by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=d'Alembert, J. | title=Essai d'une nouvelle theorie de la resistance des fluides | year=1752}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustav Kirchhoff]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Kirchhoff, G. | title=Zur Theorie freier Flussigkeitsstrahlen | publisher=Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik (70), 289-298 | year=1869}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Rayleigh, Lord | title=On the Resistance of Fluids | publisher=Philosophical Magazine (5)2, 430-441 | year=1876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equations for fluid flow with [[friction]] were developed by [[Claude-Louis Navier]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Navier, C. L. M. H. | title=Memoire sur les lois du mouvement des fluides | journal=Mémoires de l'Académie des Sciences |volume=6 |pages=389–440 | year=1827}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Gabriel Stokes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Stokes, G. | title=On the Theories of the Internal Friction of Fluids in Motion | publisher=Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society (8), 287-305 | year=1845}}&lt;/ref&gt; To simulate fluid flow, many experiments involved immersing objects in streams of water or simply dropping them off the top of a tall building. Towards the end of this time period [[Gustave Eiffel]] used his [[Eiffel Tower]] to assist in the drop testing of flat plates.

A more precise way to measure resistance is to place an object within an artificial, uniform stream of air where the velocity is known. The first person to experiment in this fashion was [[Francis Herbert Wenham]], who in doing so constructed the first [[wind tunnel]] in 1871. Wenham was also a member of the first professional organization dedicated to aeronautics, the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. Objects placed in wind tunnel models are almost always smaller than in practice, so a method was needed to relate small scale models to their real-life counterparts. This was achieved with the invention of the dimensionless [[Reynolds number]] by [[Osborne Reynolds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Reynolds, O. | title=An Experimental Investigation of the Circumstances which Determine whether the Motion of Water Shall Be Direct or Sinuous and of the Law of Resistance in Parallel Channels | publisher=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A-174, 935-982 | year=1883}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds also experimented with [[Laminar flow|laminar]] to [[Turbulence|turbulent]] flow transition in 1883.

==Developments in aviation==
Working from at least as early as 1796, when he constructed a model helicopter,&lt;ref&gt;Wragg, D.W.; ''Flight before flying'', Osprey, 1974, Page 57.&lt;/ref&gt; until his death in 1857, [[George Cayley|Sir George Cayley]] is credited as the first person to identify the four aerodynamic forces of flight—[[weight]], [[Lift (force)|lift]], [[Drag (physics)|drag]], and [[thrust]]—and the relationships between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = U.S Centennial of Flight Commission - Sir George Cayley.| url = http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Prehistory/Cayley/PH2.htm| publisher = | accessdate = 2008-09-10| quote = Sir George Cayley, born in 1773, is sometimes called the Father of Aviation.

(Via [[NASA]]). [http://invention.psychology.msstate.edu/i/Cayley/Cayley.html Raw text]. Retrieved: 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Cayley is also credited as the first person to develop the modern fixed-wing aircraft concept; although da Vinci's notes contain drawings and descriptions of a fixed-wing heavier-than-air flight machine, da Vinci's notes were disorganized and scattered following his death, and his aerodynamics achievements were not rediscovered until after technology had progressed well beyond da Vinci's advances.{{sfn|Anderson|1997|pp=21, 25-26}}

By the late 19th century, two problems were identified before heavier-than-air flight could be realized. The first was the creation of low-drag, high-lift aerodynamic wings. The second problem was how to determine the power needed for sustained flight. During this time, the groundwork was laid down for modern day [[fluid dynamics]] and aerodynamics, with other less scientifically-inclined enthusiasts testing various flying machines with little success.

In 1884, [[John J. Montgomery]], an American trained in physics, began experimenting with glider designs. Using a water table with circulating water and a smoke chamber he began applying the physics of fluid dynamics to describe the motions of flow over curved surfaces such as airfoils.&lt;ref&gt;Harwood, CS and Fogel, GB ''Quest for Flight: John J. Montgomery and the Dawn of Aviation in the West,'' University of Oklahoma Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, [[Charles Renard]], a French aeronautical engineer, became the first person to reasonably predict the power needed for sustained flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Renard, C. | title=Nouvelles experiences sur la resistance de l'air | publisher=L'Aeronaute (22) 73-81 | year=1889}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renard and German physicist [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] explored the wing loading (weight to wing-area ratio) of birds, eventually concluding that humans could not fly under their own power by attaching wings onto their arms. [[Otto Lilienthal]], following the work of Sir George Cayley, was the first person to become highly successful with glider flights. Lilienthal believed that thin, curved airfoils would produce high lift and low drag.

[[Octave Chanute]]'s 1893 book, ''Progress in Flying Machines'', outlined all of the known research conducted around the world up to that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Chanute, Octave| title=Progress in Flying Machines | publisher=Dover Publications | year=1997 | isbn=0-486-29981-3 | oclc=37782926}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chanute's book provided a great service to those interested in aerodynamics and flying machines.

With the information contained in Chanute's book, the personal assistance of Chanute himself, and research carried out in their own wind tunnel, the [[Wright brothers]] gained enough knowledge of aerodynamics to fly the first powered aircraft on December 17, 1903. The Wright brothers' flight confirmed or disproved a number of aerodynamics theories. Newton's drag force theory was finally proved incorrect. This first widely publicised flight led to a more organized effort between aviators and scientists, leading the way to modern aerodynamics.

During the time of the first flights, [[John J. Montgomery]],&lt;ref&gt;Harwood, CS and Fogel, GB ''Quest for Flight: John J. Montgomery and the Dawn of Aviation in the West'' University of Oklahoma Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick W. Lanchester]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lanchester, F. W. | title=Aerodynamics | year=1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Kutta]], and [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Nikolai Zhukovsky]] independently created theories that connected [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] of a fluid flow to lift. Kutta and Zhukovsky went on to develop a two-dimensional wing theory. Expanding upon the work of Lanchester, [[Ludwig Prandtl]] is credited with developing the mathematics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Prandtl, L. | title=Tragflügeltheorie | publisher=Göttinger Nachrichten, mathematischphysikalische Klasse, 451-477 | year=1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; behind thin-airfoil and lifting-line theories as well as work with [[boundary layer]]s. Prandtl, a professor at the [[University of Göttingen]], instructed many students who would play important roles in the development of aerodynamics, such as [[Theodore von Kármán]] and [[Michael Max Munk|Max Munk]].

==Design issues with increasing speed==
[[Compressibility]] is an important factor in aerodynamics. At low speeds, the compressibility of air is not significant in relation to [[aircraft]] design, but as the airflow nears and exceeds the [[speed of sound]], a host of new aerodynamic effects become important in the design of aircraft. These effects, often several of them at a time, made it very difficult for [[World War II]] era aircraft to reach speeds much beyond 800&amp;nbsp;km/h (500&amp;nbsp;mph).

Some of the minor effects include changes to the airflow that lead to problems in control. For instance, the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|P-38 Lightning]] with its thick high-lift wing had a particular problem in high-speed dives that led to a nose-down condition. Pilots would enter dives, and then find that they could no longer control the plane, which continued to nose over until it crashed. The problem was remedied by adding a "dive flap" beneath the wing which altered the center of pressure distribution so that the wing would not lose its lift.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| isbn=0-9629359-5-6|last=Bodie|first=Warren M.|title=The Lockheed P-38 Lightning|pages= 174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar problem affected some models of the [[Supermarine Spitfire]]. At high speeds, the [[aileron]]s could apply more torque than the Spitfire's thin wings could handle, and the entire wing would twist in the opposite direction. This meant that the plane would roll in the direction opposite to that which the pilot intended, and led to a number of accidents. Earlier models weren't fast enough for this to be a problem, and so it wasn't noticed until later model Spitfires like the Mk.IX started to appear. This was mitigated by adding considerable torsional rigidity to the wings, and was wholly cured when the Mk.XIV was introduced.

The [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] and [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Mitsubishi Zero]] had the exact opposite problem in which the controls became ineffective. At higher speeds, the pilot simply couldn't move the controls because there was too much airflow over the control surfaces. The planes would become difficult to maneuver, and at high enough speeds aircraft without this problem could out-turn them.

These problems were eventually solved as jet aircraft reached transonic and [[supersonic]] speeds. German scientists in WWII experimented with [[swept wing]]s. Their research was applied on the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] and [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86 Sabre]] and bombers such as the [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet|B-47 Stratojet]] used [[swept wing]]s which delay the onset of shock waves and reduce drag.

In order to maintain control near and above the speed of sound, it is often necessary to use either power operated all-flying tailplanes ([[stabilator]]s), or [[delta wings]] fitted with power operated [[elevons]]. Power operation prevents aerodynamic forces overriding the pilots' control inputs.

Finally, another common problem that fits into this category is [[Aeroelasticity|flutter]]. At some speeds, the airflow over the control surfaces will become turbulent, and the controls will start to flutter. If the speed of the fluttering is close to a [[harmonic]] of the control's movement, the [[resonance]] could break the control off completely. This was a serious problem on the Zero and [[VL Myrsky]]. When problems with poor control at high speed were first encountered, they were addressed by designing a new style of control surface with more power. However, this introduced a new resonant mode, and a number of planes were lost before this was discovered. On design of VL Myrsky, this problem was countered by increasing the rigidity and weight of the wing, therefore increasing the dampening of the harmonic oscillation, which compromised the performance to some extent.

All of these effects are often mentioned in conjunction with the term "compressibility", but in a manner of speaking, they are incorrectly used. From a strictly aerodynamic point of view, the term should refer only to those side-effects arising as a result of the changes in airflow from an incompressible fluid (similar in effect to water) to a compressible fluid (acting as a gas) as the speed of sound is approached. There are two effects in particular, [[wave drag]] and [[critical mach]].

Wave drag is a sudden rise in drag on the aircraft, caused by air building up in front of it. At lower speeds, this air has time to "get out of the way", guided by the air in front of it that is in contact with the aircraft. But at the speed of sound, this can no longer happen, and the air which was previously following the [[Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamline]] around the aircraft now hits it directly. The amount of power needed to overcome this effect is considerable. The critical mach is the speed at which some of the air passing over the aircraft's wing becomes supersonic.

At the speed of sound, the way that lift is generated changes dramatically, from being dominated by [[Bernoulli's principle]] to forces generated by [[shock wave]]s. Since the air on the top of the wing is traveling faster than on the bottom, due to Bernoulli effect, at speeds close to the speed of sound the air on the top of the wing will be accelerated to supersonic. When this happens, the distribution of lift changes dramatically, typically causing a powerful nose-down trim. Since the aircraft normally approached these speeds only in a dive, pilots would report the aircraft attempting to nose over into the ground.

Dissociation absorbs a great deal of energy in a reversible process. This greatly reduces the thermodynamic temperature of hypersonic gas decelerated near an aerospace vehicle. In transition regions, where this pressure dependent dissociation is  incomplete, both the differential, constant pressure heat capacity and beta (the volume/pressure differential ratio) will greatly increase. The latter has a pronounced effect on vehicle aerodynamics including stability.

==Faster than sound – later 20th century==
As aircraft began to travel faster, aerodynamicists realized that the density of air began to change as it came into contact with an object, leading to a division of fluid flow into the incompressible and [[Compressible flow|compressible]] regimes. In compressible aerodynamics, density and pressure both change, which is the basis for calculating the [[speed of sound]]. Newton was the first to develop a mathematical model for calculating the speed of sound, but it was not correct until [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] accounted for the molecular behavior of gases and introduced the [[heat capacity ratio]]. The ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the [[Mach number]] after [[Ernst Mach]], who was one of the first to investigate the properties of [[supersonic]] flow which included [[Schlieren photography]] techniques to visualize the changes in density. [[William John Macquorn Rankine]] and [[Pierre Henri Hugoniot]] independently developed the theory for flow properties before and after a [[shock wave]]. [[Jakob Ackeret]] led the initial work on calculating the lift and drag on a supersonic airfoil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Ackeret, J. | title=Luftkrafte auf Flugel, die mit der grosserer als Schallgeschwindigkeit bewegt werden | publisher=Zeitschrift fur Flugtechnik und Motorluftschiffahrt (16), 72-74 | year=1925}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theodore von Kármán and [[Hugh Latimer Dryden]] introduced the term [[transonic]] to describe flow speeds around Mach 1 where drag increases rapidly. Because of the increase in drag approaching Mach 1, aerodynamicists and aviators disagreed on whether supersonic flight was achievable.

[[Image:X-43A (Hyper - X) Mach 7 computational fluid dynamic (CFD).jpg|thumb|left|Image showing shock waves from NASA's [[X-43A]] hypersonic research vehicle in flight at Mach 7, generated using a [[computational fluid dynamics]] algorithm.]]
On September 30, 1935, an exclusive conference was held in [[Rome]] with the topic of high velocity flight and the possibility of breaking the [[sound barrier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Anderson, John D.| title=Fundamentals of Aerodynamics | publisher=McGraw-Hill | edition=4th |year=2007 | isbn=0-07-125408-0 | oclc=60589123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants included [[Theodore von Kármán]], [[Ludwig Prandtl]], [[Jakob Ackeret]], [[Eastman Jacobs]], [[Adolf Busemann]], [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor]], [[Gaetano Arturo Crocco]], and Enrico Pistolesi. Ackeret presented a design for a [[supersonic wind tunnel]]. Busemann gave a presentation on the need for aircraft with [[swept wing]]s for high speed flight. Eastman Jacobs, working for [[NACA]], presented his optimized airfoils for high subsonic speeds which led to some of the high performance American aircraft during [[World War II]]. Supersonic propulsion was also discussed. The sound barrier was broken using the [[Bell X-1]] aircraft twelve years later, thanks in part to those individuals.

By the time the sound barrier was broken, much of the subsonic and low supersonic aerodynamics knowledge had matured. The [[Cold War]] fueled an ever-evolving line of high performance aircraft. [[Computational fluid dynamics]] was started as an effort to solve for flow properties around complex objects and has rapidly grown to the point where entire aircraft can be designed using a computer, with wind-tunnel tests followed by flight tests to confirm the computer predictions.

With some exceptions, the knowledge of [[hypersonic]] aerodynamics has matured between the 1960s and the present decade. Therefore, the goals of an aerodynamicist have shifted from understanding the behavior of fluid flow to understanding how to engineer a vehicle to interact appropriately with the fluid flow. For example, while the behavior of hypersonic flow is understood, building a [[scramjet]] aircraft to fly at hypersonic speeds has seen very limited success. Along with building a successful scramjet aircraft, the desire to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of current aircraft and propulsion systems will continue to fuel new research in aerodynamics. Nevertheless, there are still important problems in basic aerodynamic theory, such as in predicting transition to turbulence, and the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations.

'''Hydrodynamic separators''' (HDS) are [[stormwater]] management devices that use [[cyclonic separation]] to control [[water pollution]].  They are designed as flow-through structures with a settling or separation unit to remove [[sediment]] and other pollutants.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Storm Water Technology Fact Sheet: Hydrodynamic Separators |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P1000ZRK.txt |date=September 1999 |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, DC |id=EPA 832-F-99-017}}&lt;/ref&gt; HDS are considered structural [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]] (BMPs), and are used to treat and pre-treat stormwater [[surface runoff|runoff]].

== Design and applications ==
HDS systems use the physics of flowing water to remove a variety of pollutants and are characterized by an internal structure that either creates a swirling [[vortex]] or plunges the water into the main sump.&lt;ref name="Mohseni"&gt;Mohseni, Omid; Saddoris, David A.; McIntire, Kurtis D.; Gulliver, John S. (2010). [http://www.cts.umn.edu/Publications/ResearchReports/reportdetail.html?id=1890 "Hydrodynamic Separator Sediment Retention Testing."] Technical Report No. MN/RC 2010-10. St. Paul, MN: Minnesota Department of Transportation.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} Along with supplemental features to reduce velocity, an HDS system is designed to separate floatables (trash, debris and oil) and settleable particles, like sediment, from stormwater. HDS systems are not effective for the removal of very fine [[suspended solids|solids]] or dissolved pollutants.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact1" /&gt; The systems are also subject to scour and sediment washout during large storm events, e.g. a 10-year storm.&lt;ref name="Mohseni" /&gt;{{rp|42}}

== Evaluation ==
A number of factors are relevant in selecting a hydrodynamic separator product for a site.

=== Sizing and treatment performance ===
HDS systems should be sized based on treatment objectives including desired level of pollutant removal, drainage basin characteristics, climate of the region, and particle size to be targeted. Performance is also sensitive to water temperature, i.e. season.{{clarify|date=April 2016}} Care must be taken to avoid routing excess flow through the device and compromising performance. Each vendor’s product has different pollutant removal rates that should be evaluated before selecting the system.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact1" /&gt;

The TAPE and TARP programs are evaluation programs sponsored by several state agencies in the U.S. These programs include lab and field testing and provide specific sizing criteria for hydrodynamic separation systems.&lt;ref&gt;State of Washington. Department of Ecology. Olympia, WA. [http://www.ecy.wa.gov/pubs/0210037.pdf Technology Assessment Protocol - Ecology (TAPE): Guidance for Evaluating Emerging Stormwater Treatment Technologies.] January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). Trenton, NJ (2007). [http://www.state.nj.us/dep/dsr/bscit/TARPMain.htm "Technology Acceptance and Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) Program."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey Corporation for Advanced Technology (NJCAT). Bordentown, NJ. [http://www.njcat.org/education/glossary.cfm "A Comprehensive Approach to Performance Verification for Stormwater Treatment Systems."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010183709/http://www.njcat.org/education/glossary.cfm |date=2008-10-10 }} Accessed 2011-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the EWRI-ASCE and the ASTM International are developing comprehensive verification guidelines and standard test methods for assessing the performance of these devices.

=== Maintenance and inspection requirements ===
HDS systems are not maintenance-intensive, when compared with land-based BMP’s.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact1" /&gt; Each manufactured system is different, therefore maintenance and inspection requirements should be looked at closely when purchasing an HDS system. [[Vacuum truck]]s are typically used for maintenance, so unobstructed access to accumulated pollutants for removal is critical.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

=== Installation and operating costs ===
Costs for HDS systems depend on site-specific conditions such as land characteristics, amount of runoff to be treated, system depth and performance requirements. Be aware that not all HDS systems are alike in treatment performance, and basing a decision solely on the installation and operating cost of a system may compromise system performance and the environment. Long-term maintenance costs should also be considered with overall costs when purchasing or selecting a stormwater BMP as initial installation and operating costs may not reflect the long-term investment needed to maintain the system.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact1" /&gt;

=== Land costs ===
According to the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), “Using structural BMPs that can be placed underground and are design to withstand site specific soil, groundwater and traffic loading conditions provide valuable savings in land area compared to conventional volume-based stormwater treatment practices such as ponds, wetlands, and swales.”&lt;ref name="EPA Fact1" /&gt; HDS systems may be ideal for areas where land is not readily available and/or tight retrofits are needed as they are installed underground.

== Regulations ==
As stormwater regulations become increasingly stringent, many states and municipalities have developed criteria to govern the use and sizing of HDS systems, and publish lists that identify acceptable HDS systems.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see NJDEP list of approved [http://www.njstormwater.org/treatment.html "Stormwater Manufactured Treatment Devices."] 2011-09-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Other jurisdictions evaluate the applicability of HDS on a site-specific basis.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Maryland Department of the Environment, [http://www.mde.state.md.us/assets/document/Proprietary%202005.pdf "Maryland’s Stormwater Program &amp; Proprietary Practices."] 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; It is increasingly common to use HDS as the first component of a treatment train, a combination of BMPs in series, to remove coarse solids and floatable pollutants that can rapidly clog other BMPs thus prolonging their maintenance cycle.

'''Inter-cultural communication principles''' guide the process of exchanging meaningful and unambiguous information across cultural boundaries, in a way that preserves mutual respect and minimises antagonism. For these purposes, [[culture]] is a shared system of [[symbol]]s, [[belief]]s, [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s, [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s, [[Expectation (epistemic)|expectation]]s, and [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]s of [[behaviour]]. It refers to coherent groups of people whether resident wholly or partly within state territories, or existing without residence in any particular territory. Hence, these principles may have equal relevance when a tourist seeks help, where two well-established independent corporations attempt to merge their operations, and where politicians attempt to negotiate world peace. Two factors have raised the importance of this topic:
*Improvements in communication and transportation technology have made it possible for previously stable cultures to meet in unstructured situations, e.g. the internet opens lines of communication without mediation, while budget airlines transplant ordinary citizens into unfamiliar ''milieux''. Experience proves that merely crossing cultural boundaries can be considered threatening, while positive attempts to interact may provoke defensive responses. Misunderstanding may be compounded by either an exaggerated sensitivity to possible slights, or an exaggerated and over-protective fear of giving offence;
*Some groups believe that the phenomenon of [[globalisation]] has reduced cultural [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] and so reduced the opportunity for misunderstandings, but characterising people as a homogeneous market is simplistic. One product or [[brand]] only appeals to the material aspirations of one self-selecting group of buyers, and its sales performance will not affect the vast multiplicity of factors that may separate the cultures.

==What can go wrong?==
People from different cultures encode and decode messages differently, increasing the chances of misunderstanding, so the safety-first consequence of recognizing cultural differences should be to assume that others' thoughts and actions are different. Such assumptions stem from potentially devastating ignorance and can lead to much frustration for members of both cultures. Entering a culture with this type of ethnocentrism, the assumption one's own culture is correct, is another byproduct of ignorance and cultural misunderstanding.

===Rights, values, and needs===
Some cultural characteristics will be easy to identify: whether people are conscious of status or make displays of material wealth. However, many rights are assumed, values are implied, and needs are unspoken, (for safety, security, love, a sense of belonging to a group, self-esteem, and the ability to attain one's goals).

For example, issues of personal security, dignity, and control will be very different as between an able-bodied and a disabled person. Similarly, there may be problems of respect when a person from a rigidly class-based culture meets a meritocrat or if there is racism, sexism or religious intolerance in play. In such situations, [[identity (social science)|identity]] is fundamental when disputing the proper role or "place" of the other, about who is in control of their lives, and how they present themselves to the outside world. The reality is more deeply rooted in power relationships, who is on top of the social, economic, and/or political hierarchy. Family members or longterm rivals may be obsessed with their mutual competition.

===Intercultural communication ethics===
Communication is something that no one can escape and it comes in many forms. Whenever a person from one culture sends a message to be processed from a different culture, intercultural communication is present.&lt;ref&gt;
Samovar, Larry A., and Richard E. Porter. "Chapter 1." Intercultural Communication: A Reader. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, 2011. 8. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to recognize when it happens to able to make wise decisions as to how the communication takes place. Intercultural communication ethics incorporates learning about different goods, the discourse that arises from and shapes the texture of those goods, and practices that enable constructive conversation in a postmodern world of difference.&lt;ref&gt;Arnett, Ronald C., Janie M. Harden Fritz, and Leeanne M. Bell. "Chapter 9." Communication Ethics Literacy: Dialogue and Difference. Los Angeles: Sage Publications, 2009. 158. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In any ethical dilemma situation, hard choices must be made in considering the intent, the action, the means, the consequence, the end goal, the situation, and the embedded cultural contexts of the case. In an intercultural decision-making context, in particular, often difficult choices must be made between upholding one's own cultural beliefs and values and considering the values of the other culture.&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, George, Steve May, and Debashish Munshi. "Chapter 20." The Handbook of Communication Ethics. New York: Routledge, 2011. 335. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Acknowledging the different goods, values, and beliefs will help to interact with someone from a different culture. A knowledge of intercultural communication, and the ability to use it effectively, can help bridge cultural differences, mitigate problems, and assist in achieving more harmonious, productive relations.&lt;ref&gt;Samovar, Larry A., and Richard E. Porter. "Chapter 1." Intercultural Communication: A Reader. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, 2011. 8. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially important in today's world where the market is global.

===Assumptions===
People may misinterpret each other's motives. For example, one group may assume that they are simply exchanging information about what they believe, but the other believes that they are negotiating a change in behavior. That is most likely to arise when the parties are not completely honest with each other from the outset. Individuals may wish to protect their [[privacy]], corporations may be concerned about [[industrial espionage]], and politicians may be bound by requirements of secrecy in the national interest. Nevertheless, clarifying the purpose of the interaction is essential to eliminating confusion.

===Situation===
If time is not a factor and those interacting approach their meetings with good will and patience, effective communication is more likely. If the parties are under pressure (whether generated by external circumstances or internal needs), emotions may colour the exchange. [[Prejudice]] is a shortcut decision-making tool. In a crisis, fear and anger may trigger more aggressive tactics, particularly if the meeting is being staged under the gaze of the news media.

==Improving intercultural communication==
It is essential that people research the cultures and communication conventions of those whom they propose to meet to minimise the risk of making the elementary mistakes. It is also prudent to set a clear agenda so that everyone understands the nature and purpose of the interaction. When language skills are unequal, clarifying one's meaning in five ways will improve communication:
#Avoid using slang and idioms, choosing words that will convey only the most specific ''denotative'' meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Zhu, P. (2010). Cross-Cultural Blunders in Professional Communication from a Semantic Perspective. Journal of Technical Writing and Communication,40(2), 179-196. doi:10.2190/tw.40.2.e&lt;/ref&gt;
#Listen carefully and, if in doubt, ask for confirmation of understanding (particularly important if local accents and pronunciation are a problem).
#Recognise that accenting and intonation can cause meaning to vary significantly.
#Respect the local communication formalities and styles, and watch for any changes in body language.
#Investigate their culture's perception of your culture by reading literature about one's culture through their eyes before entering into communication with them. This will allow one to prepare yourself for projected views of one's culture that will be borne as a visitor in their culture.
#Use politeness strategies such as hedging opinions, and making requests that allow freedom of action.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, P. S., &amp; Lee-Wong, S. M. (2003). Reconceptualizing Politeness to Accommodate Dynamic Tensions in Subordinate-to-Superior Reporting. Journal of Business and Technical Communication, 17(4), 379-412. doi:10.1177/1050651903255401&lt;/ref&gt;

If it is not possible to learn the other's language, show some respect by learning a few words. In all important exchanges, a translator can convey the message.

When writing, the choice of words represent the relationship between the reader and the writer so more thought, and care should be invested in the text since it may be thoroughly analysed by the recipient.

Baron '''Karl Eduard von Liphart''' or '''Carl Eduard von Liphart''' (16 May 1808 – 15 February 1891) was a noted art expert&lt;ref&gt;"An acute connoisseur" according to the seminal art historians [[Joseph Archer Crowe|Crowe]] and [[Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle|Cavalcaselle]] in ''Raphael: his life and works'', 1885:322 note.&lt;/ref&gt; and collector from Estonia. The family manor was near Dorpat (now [[Tartu]]).

==Life==
Liphart was born in [[Kambja Parish]] in [[Tartu County]] in 1808. He was one of the three children of [[Carl Gotthard von Lindhardt]] and Annette von Loewenwolde. He came from a noble family based at [[Raadi Manor]] who were members of the Estonian intelligentsia and owned a significant art collection.&lt;ref name=museum&gt;[http://www.erm.ee/en/visit/raadi/history-of-manor History of Manor], Eesti. Rahva Muuseum, retrieved 30 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Liphart's father maintained his own string quartet led by [[Ferdinand David (musician)|Ferdinand David]],  a gifted violinist and composer; David  left in 1836 to work in Leipzig  with his friend [[Mendelssohn]], but later returned to marry Liphart's sister Sophie.&lt;ref name=silvela&gt;{{cite book|last=Silvela|first=Zdenko|title=A new history of violin playing : the vibrato and Lambert Massart's revolutionary discovery|year=2001|publisher=Universal Publishers|location=US|isbn=1581126670|page=140|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1581126670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1853 Liphart was the founding President of the [[Estonian Naturalists' Society]]. The society still operates (2013) and claims to be the oldest scientific society in the Baltic states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elus.edicypages.com/about-ens/history History], Estonian Naturalists Society, retrieved 31 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862 Liphart moved to Florence because of the poor health of his son, [[Ernst Friedrich von Liphart|Ernst]]. However, in Florence he was able to add to his expertise and to amass a collection of paintings. He was financed and supported by Grand Duchess [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia (1819–1876)|Maria Nikolaevna]], the daughter of [[Tsar Nicholas I]].&lt;ref name=reh/&gt; The bas-relief of St Jerome by [[Desiderio da Settignano]] now in the [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, was purchased in Florence by an agent of Maria Nikolaevna as a gift for Baron Liphart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.1252.html National Gallery: ''Sr Jerome in the Desert'', Desiderio da Settignano, c 1461].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Leonardo Da Vinci - Annunciazione angel crop.jpeg|left|thumb|The angel from [[Annunciation (Leonardo)|Leonardo da Vinci's ''Annunciation'']]]]
Liphart became an acknowledged expert on the history of art. In 1867, following a theory put forward by [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen|Gustav Waagen]], Liphart was able to recognise that a [[Annunciation (Leonardo)|painting of the Annunciation]] newly arrived in the [[Uffizi Gallery]] was by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=David Alan|title=Leonardo da Vinci : origins of a genius|year=1998|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=0300072465|page=169|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0300072465}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871 he realised that another painting in the Uffizi was by the seventeenth century artist [[Hercules Seghers]]. It was Liphart and his friend the Director of the [[Berlin State Museums]], [[Wilhelm von Bode]], who independently established that this artist was more than just an etcher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/liphartk.htm Liphart, Karl Eduard Baron von, also Carl], Dictionary of Art Historians, retrieved 30 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Florence]] in 1891. After his death his art collection was moved to Estonia where it was combined with his family's collection at [[Raadi Manor]].&lt;ref name=reh&gt;[http://www.rehs.com/printimage.html?image_no=28 The Environs of Plymouth], rehs.com, retrieved 30 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Liphart wrote numerous articles and published brief notes, but never published a book-length monograph.  He corresponded with all the major art historians of his time, in Europe, Great Britain and the United States.{{citation needed|date = January 2013}}

Liphart's son, [[Ernst Friedrich von Liphart]], was disinherited by his father in 1873 for converting to marry a Roman Catholic. However his son was an accomplished artist, painting portraits including one of [[Tsar Nicholas II]]. He went on to be a curator of the Hermitage Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rusartnet.com/biographies/russian-artists/19th-century/late-19th-century/baron-ernst-friedrich-von-liphart Baron Ernst Friedrich von Liphart], RusArtNet.com, retrieved 30 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==The art collection==
The graphic art that was collected by the Liphart family came into the possession of [[Tartu University]] in the 1920s. The university still conserves the collection which includes examples of Japanese art as well as noted European printmakers like [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[William Hogarth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kunstimuuseum.ut.ee/eng/graphic.html Graphic Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101050527/http://kunstimuuseum.ut.ee/eng/graphic.html |date=1 January 2014 }}, University of Tartu Art Museum, retrieved 31 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Loc. cit.''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]], short for '''''loco citato''''', meaning "in the place cited") is a [[footnote]] or [[endnote]] term used to repeat the title and page number for a given work (and author). ''Loc. cit.'' is used in place of [[ibid.]] when the reference is not only to the work immediately preceding, but also refers to the same page. Therefore, ''loc. cit.'' is never followed by volume or page numbers. ''Loc. cit.'' may be contrasted with ''[[op. cit.]]'' (''opere citato'', "in the work cited"), in which reference is made to a work previously cited, but to a different page within that work.

==Sample usage==
* Example 1:

&lt;blockquote&gt;9. R. Millan, "Art of Latin grammar" (Academic, New York, 1997), p. 23.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;10. ''Loc. cit.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the above example, the ''loc. cit.'' in reference #10 refers to reference #9 in its entirety, including page number. Note that ''loc. cit.'' is capitalized in this instance.

* Example 2:

&lt;blockquote&gt;9. R. Millan, "Art of Latin grammar" (Academic, New York, 1997), p. 23.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;10. G. Wiki, "Blah and its uses" (Blah Ltd., Old York, 2000), p. 12.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;11. Millan, ''loc. cit.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the second example, the ''loc. cit.'' in reference #11 refers to reference #9, including page number.

* Second, it relates to the statistical description of the kinetics of macroscopic or mesoscopic systems as an ensemble of elementary processes: collisions, elementary transitions or reactions. For these processes, the consequence of the microscopic T-symmetry is: &lt;blockquote&gt;''Corresponding to every individual process there is a reverse process, and in a state of equilibrium the average rate of every process is equal to the average rate of its reverse process.''&lt;ref name = "Lewis2925"&gt;Lewis, G.N. (1925) [http://www.pnas.org/content/11/3/179.full.pdf+html A new principle of equilibrium], PNAS March 1, 1925 vol. 11 no. 3 179-183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History of microscopic reversibility==
The idea of microscopic reversibility was born together with physical kinetics. In 1872, [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] represented kinetics of gases as statistical ensemble of elementary collisions.&lt;ref name = "Boltzmann1872"&gt;Boltzmann, L. (1964), Lectures on gas  theory, Berkeley, CA, USA: U. of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Equations of mechanics are reversible in time, hence, the reverse collisions obey the same laws. This reversibility of collisions is the first example of microreversibility. According to Boltzmann, this microreversibility implies the principle of [[detailed balance]] for collisions: at the equilibrium ensemble each collision is equilibrated by its reverse collision.&lt;ref name = "Boltzmann1872"/&gt; These ideas of Boltzmann were analyzed in detail and generalized by [[Richard C. Tolman]].&lt;ref name = "Tolman1938"&gt;[[Richard C. Tolman|Tolman, R. C.]] (1938). ''The Principles of Statistical Mechanics''. Oxford University Press, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

In chemistry, [[J. H. van't Hoff]] (1884)&lt;ref&gt;Van't Hoff, J.H. Etudes de dynamique chimique. Frederic Muller, Amsterdam, 1884.&lt;/ref&gt; came up with the idea that equilibrium has dynamical nature and is a result of the balance between the forward and backward reaction rates. He did not study reaction mechanisms with many elementary reactions and could not formulate the principle of detailed balance for complex reactions. In 1901, [[Rudolf Wegscheider]] introduced the principle of detailed balance for complex chemical reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Wegscheider, R. (1901) [http://www.springerlink.com/content/q12x76713v015316/ Über simultane Gleichgewichte und die Beziehungen zwischen Thermodynamik und Reactionskinetik homogener Systeme], Monatshefte für Chemie / Chemical Monthly 32(8), 849--906.&lt;/ref&gt; He found that for a complex reaction the principle of detailed balance implies important and non-trivial relations between reaction rate constants for different reactions. In particular, he demonstrated that the irreversible cycles of reaction are impossible and for the reversible cycles the product of constants of the forward reactions (in the "clockwise" direction) is equal to the product of constants of the reverse reactions (in the "anticlockwise" direction). [[Lars Onsager]] (1931) used these relations in his well-known work,&lt;ref name = "Onsager1931"&gt;Onsager, L. (1931), [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v37/i4/p405_1 Reciprocal relations in irreversible processes.] I, Phys. Rev. 37,  405-426.&lt;/ref&gt; without direct citation but with the following remark: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Here, however, the chemists are accustomed to impose a very interesting additional restriction, namely: when the equilibrium is reached each individual reaction must balance itself. They require that the transition &lt;math&gt;A\to B&lt;/math&gt; must take place just as frequently as the reverse transition &lt;math&gt;B\to A&lt;/math&gt; etc."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The quantum theory of emission and absorption developed by [[Albert Einstein]] (1916, 1917)&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, A. (1917). Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung [=On the quantum theory of radiation], Physikalische Zeitschrift 18 (1917), 121-128. [http://hermes.ffn.ub.es/luisnavarro/nuevo_maletin/Einstein%20(1917)_Quantum%20theory%20of%20radiation.pdf English translation]: D. ter Haar (1967): The Old Quantum Theory. Pergamon Press, pp. 167-183.&lt;/ref&gt; gives an example of application of the microreversibility and detailed balance to development of a new branch of kinetic theory.

Sometimes, the principle of detailed balance is formulated in the narrow sense, for chemical reactions only&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/380610/principle-of-microscopic-reversibility ''Principle of microscopic reversibility.''] Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but in the history of physics it has the broader use: it was invented for collisions, used for emission and absorption of quanta, for transport processes&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Nikolaevich Gorban|Gorban, A.N.]],   Sargsyan, H.P., and Wahab, H.A. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2908 Quasichemical Models of Multicomponent Nonlinear Diffusion], Mathematical Modelling of Natural Phenomena, Volume 6 / Issue 05, (2011), 184−262.&lt;/ref&gt; and for many other phenomena.

In its modern form, the principle of microreversibility was published by Lewis (1925).&lt;ref name = "Lewis2925"/&gt; In the classical textbooks&lt;ref name = "Tolman1938"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lifshitz, E. M. |author2=Pitaevskii, L. P. |last-author-amp=yes | title=Physical kinetics | year = 1981 | location= London | publisher=Pergamon | isbn = 0-08-026480-8}} Vol. 10 of the [[Course of Theoretical Physics]](3rd Ed).&lt;/ref&gt; full theory and many examples of applications are presented.

==Time-reversibility of dynamics==

The [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton]] and the [[Schrödinger equation]]s in the absence of the macroscopic [[magnetic field]]s and in the [[inertial frame of reference]] are T-invariant: if ''X(t)'' is a solution then ''X(-t)'' is also a solution (here ''X'' is the vector of all dynamic variables, including all the coordinates of particles for the Newton equations and the [[wave function]] in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] for the Schrödinger equation).

There are two sources of the violation of this rule:
* First, if dynamics depend on a [[pseudovector]] like the magnetic field or the rotation angular speed in the rotating frame then the T-symmetry does not hold.
* Second, in microphysics of [[weak interaction]] the T-symmetry may be violated and only the combined [[CPT symmetry]] holds.

==Macroscopic consequences of the time-reversibility of dynamics==

In physics and chemistry, there are two main macroscopic consequences of the time-reversibility of microscopic dynamics: the principle of [[detailed balance]] and the [[Onsager reciprocal relations]].

The statistical description of the macroscopic process as an ensemble of the elementary indivisible events (collisions) was invented by [[Ludwig Boltzmann|L. Boltzmann]] and formalised in the [[Boltzmann equation]]. He discovered that the time-reversibility of the Newtonian dynamics leads to the detailed balance for collision: in equilibrium collisions are equilibrated by their reverse collisions. This principle allowed Boltzmann to deduce simple and nice formula for entropy production and prove his famous [[H-theorem]].&lt;ref name = "Boltzmann1872"/&gt; In this way, microscopic reversibility was used to prove macroscopic irreversibility and convergence of ensembles of molecules to their thermodynamic equilibria.

Another macroscopic consequence of microscopic reversibility is the symmetry of kinetic coefficients, the so-called reciprocal relations. The reciprocal relations were discovered in the 19th century by  [[Thomson effect#Thomson effect|Thomson]] and [[Helmholtz]] for some phenomena but the general theory was proposed by [[Lars Onsager]] in 1931.&lt;ref name = "Onsager1931"/&gt; He  found also the connection between the reciprocal relations and detailed balance. For the equations of the [[law of mass action]] the reciprocal relations appear in the linear approximation near equilibrium as a consequence of the detailed balance conditions. According to the reciprocal relations, the damped oscillations in homogeneous closed systems near thermodynamic equilibria are impossible because the spectrum of symmetric operators is real. Therefore, the relaxation to equilibrium in such a system is monotone if it is sufficiently close to the equilibrium.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5367">The '''''Shōtōkan nijū kun''''' ([[Japanese language]]: {{linktext|松|濤|館|二|十|訓}}) are the "twenty instructions" of the [[Okinawan martial arts]] master [[Gichin Funakoshi]], whose [[pen name]] was Shōtō. All students of [[Shōtōkan]] [[karate]] are encouraged to live, practice, and teach the principles to others.&lt;ref name="funakoshi1"&gt;{{cite book | author = Gichin Funakoshi | title = The Twenty Guiding Principles of Karate | year = 1938 | ISBN = 978-4-7700-2796-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Funakoshi trained in [[Shuri-te]] and [[Naha-te]] from an early age. He ultimately developed [[Shotokan|his style of karate]], which he believed leveraged the benefits of these two. Gaining the attention of a larger audience, Funakoshi later ventured to disseminate his art throughout  [[Japan]],&lt;ref name="funakoshi2"&gt;{{cite book | author = Gichin Funakoshi | title = Karate-do: My Way of Life | year = 1975 | ISBN = 0-87011-463-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and created the ''nijū kun'' to assist his [[karate]]ka in their training.

== Precepts ==

While it has been suggested that the ''Shōtōkan niju kun'' were documented by around 1890,&lt;ref name="funakoshi1"/&gt; they were first actually  published  in a [[book]] in 1938 ''The Twenty Guiding Principles of Karate'' as:&lt;ref name="funakoshi1" /&gt;

A '''nurse log''' is a fallen [[tree]] which, as it decays, provides [[ecological facilitation]] to seedlings. Broader definitions include providing shade or support to other plants. Some of the advantages a nurse log offers to a seedling are: [[water]], [[moss]] thickness, [[leaf litter]], [[mycorrhizae]], disease protection, nutrients, and [[sunlight]]. Recent research into soil pathogens suggests that in some forest communities, pathogens hostile to a particular tree species appear to gather in the vicinity of that species, and to a degree inhibit seedling growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mangan |first1=Scott A. |last2=Schnitzer |first2=Stefan A. |last3=Herre |first3=Edward A. |last4=Mack |first4=Keenan M.

==Occurrence==

Various mechanical and biological processes contribute to the breakdown of [[lignin]] in fallen trees, resulting in the formation of niches of increasing size, which tend to fill with forest litter such as soil from spring floods, needles, [[moss]], mushrooms and other flora. Mosses also can cover the outside of a log, hastening its decay and supporting other species as rooting media and by retaining water. Small animals such as various [[squirrel]]s often perch or roost on nurse logs, adding to the litter by food debris and scat. The decay of this detritus contributes to the formation of a rich [[humus]] that provides a seedbed and adequate conditions for germination.
[[Image:Nursery Log at Schooner Trail.jpg|thumb|left|Nurse log harboring a young [[western hemlock]]]]

Nurse logs often provide a seedbed to conifers in a [[temperate rain forest]] ecosystem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2158">'''Optimal maintenance''' is the discipline within [[operations research]] concerned with maintaining a system in a manner that maximizes [[Profit (economics)|profit]] or minimizes [[cost]]. Cost functions depending on the [[reliability theory|reliability]], [[availability]] and [[maintainability]] characteristics of the system of interest determine the parameters to minimize. Parameters often considered are the cost of failure, the cost per time unit of "downtime" (for example: revenue losses), the cost (per time unit) of [[corrective maintenance]], the cost per time unit of [[preventive maintenance]] and the cost of [[repairable]] system replacement [Cassady and Pohl]. The foundation of any maintenance model relies on the correct description of the underlying deterioration process and failure behavior of the component, and on the relationships between maintained components in the product breakdown (system / sub-system / assembly / sub-assembly...).

Optimal Maintenance strategies are often constructed using stochastic models and focus on finding an optimal [[Planned maintenance|inspection time]] or the optimal acceptable degree of system degradation before maintenance and/or replacement. Cost considerations on an Asset scale may also lead to select a "run-to-failure" approach for specific components.

There are four main survey papers available accomplished to cover the spectrum of optimal maintenance:

* Optimal maintenance models for systems subject to failure–a review by YS Sherif, ML Smith published in Naval Research Logistics Quarterly, 1981.
* C. Valdez-Flores, R.M. Feldman, “A survey of preventive maintenance models for stochastically deteriorating single-unit systems”, Naval Research Logistics, vol 36, 1989 Aug, pp 419-446.

'''[[Packaging]] engineering''', also '''package engineering''', '''packaging technology''' and '''packaging science''', is a broad topic ranging from design conceptualization to product placement.  All steps along the manufacturing process, and more, must be taken into account in the design of the package for any given product.  Package engineering includes industry-specific aspects of [[industrial engineering]],  [[marketing]],  [[materials science]], [[industrial design]] and [[logistics]].  Packaging engineers must interact with research and development, manufacturing, marketing, graphic design, regulatory, purchasing, planning and so on.  The package must sell and protect the product, while maintaining an efficient, cost-effective process cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;).  Packaging involves [[extrusion]], [[thermoforming]], [[molding (process)|molding]] and other processing technologies.  Packages are often developed for high speed fabrication, filling, processing, and shipment.  Packaging engineers use principles of [[structural analysis]] and [[thermal analysis]] in their evaluations.

==Education==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1526">'''Phytomers''' are functional units of a plant, continually produced by root and shoot [[meristem]]s throughout a plant's vegetative life-cycle. The phytomer unit originates at the shoot (or root) apex, and a typical phytomer consists of a node to which a leaf is attached, a subtending internode, and an [[axillary bud]] at the base of the leaf. Each component of a phytomer can continue to differentiate and grow. Increases in a phytomer can be measured using the rate of [[phyllochron]] (rate of appearance of leaves on a shoot). Related to the phyllochron is the [[plastochron]], which is the rate of leaf primordia initiation. Since many more leaf primordia are initiated than leaves develop, the plastochron develops at a much faster rate (sometimes as much as twice as quickly) as the phyllochron.

Initially, a young plant will only produce phytomers at its apical meristems but later in development, secondary meristems will begin to form and phytomers will be formed on this lateral plant growth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4769">A '''project anatomy''' (also '''integration anatomy or organic integration plan''') is a tool for integration planning that visualizes dependencies between work items in development projects. It is mainly used in [[Iterative and incremental development|incremental development]] and [[Integration Driven Development]] projects.

The project anatomy has evolved from the [[system anatomy]] and in its purest form the work items (called ''work packages'') reflect the development of system capabilities. Often a more pragmatic approach is taken, though, where work packages may contain other items with important dependencies as well, e.g. HW deliveries for embedded systems.

&lt;big&gt;'''Benefits:'''&lt;/big&gt; 
* Simple
* Easy to grasp view of what to do, what is done and the dependencies between work packages
* Collaborative
* Common view for developers, project managers and sponsors
* Helps in finding and managing risks and delays
* Can be used to manage dependencies between teams and sprints in large [[Agile software development|agile development]] projects

&lt;big&gt;'''Limitations:'''&lt;/big&gt;
* Can include, but not manage, lead time aspects
* Can include, but not manage, resource aspects

== History ==
History of [[system anatomy|system anatomies]]
Project anatomies have evolved from system anatomies, mainly at Ericsson, since the late 1990s. Both the terminology and the methodology have differed between organizations and the difference between "system anatomy", "project anatomy", "delta anatomy" and "integration anatomy" is sometimes diffuse or non-existent. In 2004 FindOut Technologies presented a SW tool (Paipe) for managing anatomies with more properties. The company has, since then, worked to establish the term Project Anatomy.

== Example ==
The project anatomy below is an example showing the work packages needed to develop a simple issue management system. 

Work packages with many dependencies are called spiders and indicate a risk. The risk may be managed by splitting the work package or by moving dependants of it to later shipments (increments).

The colors indicate the current status of work packages, where green means “on track”, yellow means “at risk” and red means “off track”. Blue work packages are done.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7151">'''Sheldon Krimsky''' is Professor of Urban and Environmental Policy and Planning at [[Tufts University]], and adjunct professor in the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health at [[Tufts University School of Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.councilforresponsiblegenetics.org "Council for Responsible Genetics"], Board of Directors. Accessed June 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He is a fellow of the [[Hastings Center]], an independent [[bioethics]] research institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehastingscenter.org/About/Default.aspx?id=902 The Hastings Center] Hastings Center Fellows.

== Work ==

=== ''Science in the Private Interest'' ===
In his 2003 book ''Science in the Private Interest'', Krimsky points out that conflicts of interests are perceived and regulated very differently in public affairs and in science:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The prophylactic measures that are taken to prevent conflict of interest in public affairs are considered irrelevant in science precisely because scientists view themselves as participating in a higher calling than that of public officials—namely, the pursuit of objective knowledge. While senior public officials (elected or appointed) are prohibited from managing their portfolios during their tenure in office, scientists with patents and equity in companies that fund their research are at most simply asked to disclose their interests.{{sfn|Krimsky|Nader|2003}}{{rp|130}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Krimsky raises the concern that conflicts of interest may compromise the scientific norm of "disinterestedness", which "requires that scientists apply the methods, perform the analysis, and execute the interpretation of results without considerations of personal gain, ideology, or fidelity to any cause other than the pursuit of truth."{{sfn|Krimsky|Nader|2003}}{{rp|77}} He claims that blurred boundaries between public interest science and pursuit of private gain have severely compromised the integrity of university science:&lt;blockquote&gt;The evolving academic universe is no longer as nurturing an environment for public-interest science as it once was. To a large degree, universities have been taken over by money managers and academic entrepreneurs who are looking for financially lucrative research.{{sfn|Krimsky|Nader|2003}}{{rp|79}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Krimsky writes that the profit motive has corrupted many scientists in biomedical research. He also proposes that the relationships between corporations, universities, and government agencies have resulted in biased science that puts human health and environment at risk. He has written and commented on [[Genetically modified food|genetically modified foods]], [[water fluoridation]], [[environmental health]], [[global warming]], and other controversial topics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/23/science/a-conversation-with-sheldon-krimsky-uncoupling-campus-and-company.html A Conversation With: Sheldon Krimsky; Uncoupling Campus and Company], by Melody Petersen.

{{Rape}}

'''Sociobiological theories of rape''' explore how [[evolution]]ary adaptation influences the psychology of rapists. Such theories are highly controversial, as traditional theories typically do not consider [[rape]] to be a behavioral adaptation. Some object to such theories on ethical, religious, political, or scientific grounds. Others argue that a correct knowledge of the causes of rape is necessary to develop effective preventive measures.

== ''A Natural History of Rape'' ==
The idea that rape evolved under some circumstances as a genetically advantageous behavioral adaptation was popularized by biologist [[Randy Thornhill]] and [[anthropologist]] [[Craig T. Palmer]] in their book ''[[A Natural History of Rape]]'' (2000).

== Animal coercive sex ==
{{Further information|Sexual coercion|Sexual selection|Sexual conflict}}
It has been noted that behavior resembling [[rape]] in humans is observed in the animal kingdom, including [[Anatidae|ducks and geese]]{{ref?|date=November 2018}}, [[bottlenose dolphins]],&lt;ref&gt;Connor, Richard and Vollmer, Nicole (ed. Buss, David). 2005. Sexual Coercion in Dolphin Consortships: A comparison with Chimpanzees, pp 218.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[chimpanzees]].&lt;ref&gt;Akiko Matsumoto-Oda, Miya Hamai, Hitosige Hayaki, Kazuhiko Hosaka, Kevin D. Hunt, Eiiti Kasuya, Kenji Kawanaka, John C. Mitani, Hiroyuki Takasaki, and Yukio Takahata. 2007. Estrus Cycle Asynchrony in Wild Female Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in [[orangutans]], [[Hominidae|close human relatives]], copulations of this nature may account for up to half of all observed matings.&lt;ref&gt;Wrangham, R., &amp; Peterson, D. 1996. Demonic males. New York: Houghton Mifﬂin.&lt;/ref&gt; Such behaviors, referred to as 'forced copulations', involve an animal being approached and [[sexual intercourse|sexually penetrated]] as it struggles or attempts to escape. These observations of forced sex among animals are not controversial. What is controversial is the interpretation of these observations and the extension of theories based on them to [[human]]s. "Thornhill introduces this theory by describing the sexual behavior of scorpionflies. In which the male may gain sex from the female either by presenting a gift of food during courtship or without a nuptial offering, in which case force is necessary to restrain her."&lt;ref name=Glenn&gt;Wilson, Glenn. The Science of Sex: Glenn Wilson on Rape. The Great Sex Divide, pp. 128–131. http://www.heretical.com/wilson/rape.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human rape ==

It is hypothesized that rape is [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to similar behavior in other animals.  "Human rape appears not as an aberration but as an alternative gene-promotion strategy that is most likely to be adopted by the 'losers' in the competitive, harem-building struggle. If the means of access to legitimate, consenting sex is not available, then a male may be faced with the choice between force or genetic extinction."&lt;ref name=Glenn/&gt;

Thornhill and Palmer write that "In short, a man can have many children, with little inconvenience to himself; a woman can have only a few, and with great effort." Females therefore tend to be more choosy with partners. Rape is seen as one potential strategy for males for achieving reproductive success. They point to several other factors indicating that rape may be a reproductive strategy. It is during the potentially childbearing years that women most often are rape victims. Rapists usually do not use more force than necessary to subdue their victims which is argued to be the case since physically injuring the victims would reduce the chance of reproduction. Furthermore, "In many cultures rape is treated as a crime against the victim's husband."&lt;ref name=Thornhill2000/&gt;

Anthropologist Edward H. Hagen states in his Evolutionary Psychology FAQ from 2002 that he believes there is no clear evidence for the hypothesis that rape is adaptive. He believes the adaptivity of rape is ''possible'', but claims there is not enough evidence to be certain one way or the other. However, he encourages such evidence to be obtained: "Whether human males possess psychological adaptations for rape will only be answered by careful studies seeking evidence for such cognitive specializations. To not seek such evidence is like failing to search a suspect for a concealed weapon." He also describes some conditions in the ancestral environment during which the reproductive gains from rape may have outweighed the costs:
*"High status males may have been able to coerce matings with little fear of reprisal."
*"Low status women (e.g., orphans) may have been particularly vulnerable to being raped because males need not have feared reprisals from the woman's family."
*"During war, raping enemy women may have had few negative repercussions."
*"Men who were low status, who were likely to remain low status, and who had few opportunities to invest in kin may have realized reproductive benefits that outweighed the considerable costs (e.g., reprisal by the woman's family)."

McKibbin et al. (2008) argue that there may be several different types of rapists or rape strategies. One is rape by disadvantaged men who cannot get sex otherwise. Another is "specialized rapists" who are more sexually aroused from rape than from consensual sex. A third type is opportunistic rapists who switch between forced and consensual sex depending on circumstances. A fourth type is [[psychopathic]] rapists. A fifth type is partner rape due to [[sperm competition]] when the male suspects or knows that the female has had sex with another male. There are varying degrees of empirical support for the existence of each of these types. More generally they mention research finding that at least one-third of males "admit they would rape under specific conditions" and that other surveys find that many men{{quantify|date=January 2012}} state having coercive sexual fantasies. They, as have others, "propose that rape is a conditional strategy that may potentially be deployed by any man."&lt;ref name=McKibbin/&gt;

=== Women's defenses ===
Women may have developed several defenses against and strategies to avoid rape. One is a partner preference for men that are effective bodyguards against other men such as physically and socially dominant men (although there may also be other evolutionary reasons for such a preference). Another is great psychological pain which according to some research is greatest during the childbearing years. Other researchers{{who|date=May 2013}} have argued that the emotional pain may cause the women to focus on the social circumstances that enabled the rape with the aim to prevent future rapes.

Other research{{who|date=May 2013}} has found that during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle women perform fewer behaviors that may increase the risk of an assault. Studies have also found that sensitivity for potential coercive behaviors in males as well as handgrip strength (but only in a simulated coercive situation) increase during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle.&lt;ref name=McKibbin/&gt;  On the other hand, a 2003 study found that the frequency of [[pregnancy from rape]] is significantly higher than that of pregnancy in non-coercive intercourse, and advanced the hypothesis that male rapists disproportionately target women exhibiting biological indications of fertility.&lt;ref name=Gottschall03&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12110-003-1014-0 |title=Are per-incident rape-pregnancy rates higher than per-incident consensual pregnancy rates? |year=2003 |last1=Gottschall |first1=Jonathan A. |last2=Gottschall |first2=Tiffani A. |journal=Human Nature |volume=14 |pages=1–20|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/wp5cnp43k6byxj4d/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Naturalistic fallacy ===
Thornhill and Palmer write that "Rape is viewed as a natural, biological phenomenon that is a product of the human evolutionary heritage". They further state that by categorizing a behavior as "natural" and "biological" they do not in any way mean to imply that the behavior is justified or even inevitable. "Biological" means "of or pertaining to life," so the word applies to every human feature and behavior. But to infer from that, as many critics assert that Thornhill and Palmer do, that what is biological is somehow right or good, would be to fall into the so-called [[naturalistic fallacy]]. They make a comparison to "natural disasters as epidemics, floods and tornadoes". This shows that what can be found in nature is not always good and that measures should be and are taken against natural phenomena. They further argue that a good knowledge of the causes of rape, including evolutionary ones, are necessary in order to develop effective preventive measures.&lt;ref name=Thornhill2000&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thornhill|first1=Randy|last2=Palmer|first2=Craig T.|title=Why Men Rape|url=http://www.csus.edu/indiv/m/merlinos/thornhill.html|website=www.csus.edu|accessdate=29 May 2018|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists McKibbin et al. argue that the claim that evolutionary theories are justifying rape, is a fallacy in the same way that it would be a fallacy to accuse scientists doing research on the causes of [[cancer]], that they are justifying cancer. Instead, they say that understanding the causes of rape may help create preventive measures.&lt;ref name=McKibbin&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McKibbin | first1 = W. F. | last2 = Shackelford | first2 = T. K. | last3 = Goetz | first3 = A. T. | last4 = Starratt | first4 = V. G. | title = Why do men rape?

Wilson et al. (2003) argue that evolutionary psychologists like Thornhill and Palmer use the [[naturalistic fallacy]] inappropriately to forestall legitimate discussion about the ethical implications of their theory. According to Thornhill and Palmer, a naturalistic fallacy is to infer ethical conclusions (e.g., rape is good) from (true or false) statements of fact (e.g., rape is natural). Wilson et al. point out that combining a factual statement with an ethical statement to derive an ethical conclusion is standard ethical reasoning, not a naturalistic fallacy, because the moral judgment is not deduced ''exclusively'' from the factual statement. They further argue that if one combines Thornhill and Palmer's factual premise that rape increases the fitness of a woman's offspring with the ethical premise that it is right to increase fitness of offspring, the resulting deductively valid conclusion is that rape has also positive effects and that its ethical status is ambiguous. Wilson et al. state that Thornhill and Palmer dismiss all ethical objections with the phrase 'naturalistic fallacy' although "it is Thornhill and Palmer who are thinking fallaciously by using the naturalistic fallacy in this way."&lt;ref name="wilson2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Wilson |first1= David Sloan |last2= Dietrich |first2= Eric |last3= Clark |first3= Anne B. |year= 2003 |title= On the inappropriate use of the naturalistic fallacy in evolutionary psychology |journal= Biology and Philosophy |volume= 18 |issue= 5 |pages= 669&amp;ndash;681 |publisher=  |doi= 10.1023/A:1026380825208 |url= http://evolution.binghamton.edu/dswilson/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/DSW14.pdf |accessdate= March 23, 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160511091445/http://evolution.binghamton.edu/dswilson/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/DSW14.pdf |archivedate= 11 May 2016 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preventing rape ===
Thornhill and Palmer (2000) suggest a number of possible strategies for preventing rape. One example is explaining to males that they may have predispositions to misread the female invitation of sex. They believe that viewing rape as being due to a desire for domination, and not related to sexual desire, is generally harmful. One example being the claim that the way women dress will not affect the risk of rape. They argue that the much greater societal freedom of dating without supervision, and removal of many barriers between males and females, have created an environment that has also removed many earlier societal controls against rape. It is recommended that "men and women interact only in public places during the early stages of their relationships".&lt;ref name=Thornhill2000/&gt;

=== Victim counseling ===
Counseling of rape victims may also be improved by evolutionary considerations, according to Thornhill and Palmer, and they argue that the view that rape is due to a domination desire, cannot explain to the victim why the rapist seemed to be sexually motivated. 

Evolutionary considerations can also help explain the emotional pain felt, as well as the form it takes. They may also help the rape victim understand why the rape victim's partner may see the rape as a form of [[infidelity]]. They also argued that the victim's partner may be helped by such understanding, and be more able to change his or her reaction.&lt;ref name=Thornhill2000/&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{See also|Criticism of evolutionary psychology}}
The 2003 book ''Evolution, Gender, and Rape'', written in response to ''A Natural History of Rape'', compiles the views of twenty-eight scholars in opposition to sociobiological theories of rape. One contributor, [[Michael Kimmel]], criticizes Thornhill and Palmer's argument that female rape victims tend to be sexually attractive young women, rather than children or older women, contrary to what would be expected if rapists selected victims based on inability to resist. Kimmel argues that younger women are the least likely to be married and the most likely to be out on dates with men, and therefore are the most likely to be raped because of opportunity arising from social exposure and marital status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Evolution, Gender, and Rape |isbn= 0-262-20143-7 |publisher= MIT Press |year= 2003 |editor1-last= Travis |editor1-first= Cheryl Brown |last= Kimmel |first= Michael |authorlink1= Michael Kimmel |chapter= An Unnatural History of Rape |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=a2TTPKFUXgkC&amp;pg=PA221 |pages= 221&amp;ndash;233 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer and Thornhill responded to these critics in an article in the journal ''[[Evolutionary Psychology (journal)|Evolutionary Psychology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Palmer |first1=C. |last2=Thornhill |first2=R. |title=A posse of good citizens bring outlaw evolutionists to justice|url=http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/ep011027.pdf|publisher=Evolutionary Psychology 1 |pages= 10-27 |date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith et al. (2001) criticized Thornhill and Palmer's hypothesis that a predisposition to rape in certain circumstances is an evolved psychological adaptation. They developed a fitness cost/benefit mathematical model and populated it with estimates of certain parameters (some parameter estimates were based on studies of the [[Aché people|Aché]] in Paraguay).  Their model suggested that generally that only men with a future reproductive value of 1/10th or less of a typical 25-year-old man would have a net positive cost/benefit fitness ratio from committing rape.  On the basis of their model and parameter estimates, they suggested that this would make it unlikely that rape generally would have net fitness benefits for most men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/06/19/why-do-we-rape-kill-and-sleep-around.html Why Do We Rape, Kill and Sleep Around?], Sharon Begley, ''The Daily Beast''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEM"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Smith |first1= Eric |last2= Mulde |first2=Monique|last3=Hill|first3=Kim |year= 2001 |title= Controversies in the evolutionary social sciences: a guide for the perplexed|journal= [[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]] |volume= 16 |issue= 3 |pages= 128–135 |url= http://instruct.uwo.ca/psychology/371g/Smith2001.pdf|accessdate= July 1, 2013 |doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(00)02077-2 |pmid=11179576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While defending the evolutionary psychology theory of rape against its more vehement critics, Vandermassen (2010) provides a critique of some aspects of the view. She characterises the view of Thornhill and Palmer as "extreme" (p.&amp;nbsp;736), as they fail to allow for the influence of any non-sexual motivations in the crime of rape. Vandermassen also notes two problems with the data cited by Thornhill and Palmer regarding the psychological trauma caused by the violence associated with rape: firstly, the data is inaccurately and confusingly presented in the book, often obscuring the fact that they do not support Thornhill and Palmer's "counterintuitive hypothesis" (p.&amp;nbsp;744) that more physical violence during rape is associated with less psychological pain. Secondly, more recent research has failed to support this hypothesis. A more moderate position, integrating the evolutionary psychology and feminist theories on rape, is presented by Vandermassen, based in part on the work of feminist evolutionary researcher [[Barbara Smuts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vandermassen | first1 = G. | title = Evolution and Rape: A Feminist Darwinian Perspective | doi = 10.1007/s11199-010-9895-y | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 64 | issue = 9–10 | pages = 732–747 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamilton (2008) has criticized Thornhill and Palmer's definition of rape as the coerced vaginal penetration of women of reproductive age. He has suggested that the exclusion of [[Rape of males|male rape]], rape of women outside the reproductive age range, murderous rape, and non-vaginal forms of rape virtually guaranteed the confirmation of their hypothesis that rape is an evolved reproductive strategy and not a crime of violence. Hamilton has argued that evolutionary psychology fails to explain rape because, by evolutionary psychology's own criteria, an adaptation to rape children or men, or non-vaginal rape, would have been eliminated in the course of evolution because it did not confer reproductive advantage on our ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Hamilton |first1= Richard |year= 2008 |title= The Darwinian cage: Evolutionary psychology as moral science |journal= Theory Culture and Society |volume= 25 |issue= 2 |pages= 105&amp;ndash;125 |publisher= |doi= 10.1177/0263276407086793 |url= http://researchonline.nd.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&amp;context=phil_article&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fscholar%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3DDarwinian%2Bcage%2Bevolutionary%2Bpsychology%26btnG%3D%26as_sdt%3D1%252C5%26as_sdtp%3D#search=%22Darwinian%20cage%20evolutionary%20psychology%22 |accessdate= March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''stellar atmosphere''' is the outer region of the volume of a [[star]], lying above the [[Solar core|stellar core]], [[radiation zone]] and [[convection zone]].

==Overview==
The stellar atmosphere is divided into several regions of distinct character:

* The [[photosphere]], which is the atmosphere's lowest and coolest layer, is normally its only visible part.&lt;ref name = "BrightPS"/&gt; [[Light]] escaping from the surface of the star stems from this region and passes through the higher layers. The [[Sun]]'s photosphere has a [[effective temperature|temperature]] in the 5,770&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin|K]] to 5,780&amp;nbsp;K range.&lt;ref name = "lowTemp"&gt;{{Cite book|last1= Mariska |first1= J.T. |title= The solar transition region |series = Cambridge Astrophysics Series  |url = http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521382618&amp;ss=toc  |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]  |isbn=  978-0-521-38261-8  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "higherTemp"/&gt; [[Starspot]]s, cool regions of disrupted [[magnetic field]] lie on the photosphere.&lt;ref name = "higherTemp"&gt;{{Cite book|last1= Lang |first1= K.R. |title= Sun, earth, and sky  |edition= 2nd   |date=September 2006  |publisher= Springer  |isbn= 978-0-387-30456-4  |page= 81 |chapter= 5.1 MAGNETIC FIELDS IN THE VISIBLE PHOTOSPHERE |quote= this opaque layer is the photosphere, the level of the Sun from which we get our light and heat  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vastu shastra (''{{IAST|vāstu śāstra}}'') is a traditional Hindu system of architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quack|first1=Johannes|title=Disenchanting India: Organized Rationalism and Criticism of Religion in India|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=119|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=TNbxUwhS5RUC&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;pg=PA119#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which literally translates to "science of architecture."&lt;ref name="narlikar_CUP"/&gt; These are texts found on the Indian subcontinent that describe principles of design, layout, measurements, ground preparation, space arrangement, and spatial geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vastukarta.com/principles_of_vastu.php|title=GOLDEN PRINCIPLES OF VASTU SHASTRA Vastukarta|website=www.vastukarta.com|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pka/&gt; Vastu Shastras incorporate traditional Hindu and in some cases Buddhist beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vastushastra|first=Vijaya |last=Kumar|publisher=New Dawn/Sterling|year=2002|isbn=978-81-207-2199-9|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designs are intended to integrate architecture with nature, the relative functions of various parts of the structure, and ancient beliefs utilizing geometric patterns ([[yantra]]), symmetry, and [[Direction (geometry, geography)|directional]] alignments.&lt;ref name=stellakramrisch76/&gt;&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt;

Vastu Shastra are the textual part of ''Vastu Vidya'', the latter being the broader knowledge about architecture and design theories from ancient India.&lt;ref name=vsgt1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vibhuti Sachdev, Giles Tillotson|title=Building Jaipur: The Making of an Indian City|date=2004|isbn=978-1861891372|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vastu Vidya knowledge is a collection of ideas and concepts, with or without the support of layout diagrams, that are not rigid. Rather, these ideas and concepts are models for the organization of space and form within a building or collection of buildings, based on their functions in relation to each other, their usage and to the overall fabric of the Vastu.&lt;ref name=vsgt1/&gt; Ancient Vastu Shastra principles include those for the design of ''Mandir'' ([[Hindu temple]]s),&lt;ref&gt;George Michell (1988), The Hindu Temple: An Introduction to Its Meaning and Forms, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226532301}}, pp 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; and the principles for the design and layout of houses, towns, cities, gardens, roads, water works, shops and other public areas.&lt;ref name=pka/&gt;&lt;ref name="GD Vasudev 2001 pp 74-92"&gt;GD Vasudev (2001), Vastu, Motilal Banarsidas, {{ISBN|81-208-1605-6}}, pp 74-92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherri Silverman 2007"&gt;Sherri Silverman (2007), Vastu: Transcendental Home Design in Harmony with Nature, Gibbs Smith, Utah, {{ISBN|978-1423601326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The Sanskrit word ''vastu'' means a dwelling or house with a corresponding plot of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Latest Vastu Shastra (Some Secrets)|first=Jagdish|last= Gautum|page=17|publisher=Abhinav Publications|year=2006|isbn=978-81-7017-449-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[vrddhi]], ''vāstu'', takes the meaning of "the site or foundation of a house, site, ground, building or dwelling-place, habitation, homestead, house". The underlying root is ''vas'' "to dwell, live, stay, reside".&lt;ref&gt;Monier-Williams (1899).&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[shastra]] may loosely be translated as  "doctrine, teaching".

''Vastu-Sastras'' (literally, science of dwelling) are ancient Sanskrit manuals of architecture. These contain Vastu-Vidya (literally, knowledge of dwelling).&lt;ref name=bbdutt&gt;BB Dutt (1925), {{Google books|J3jEJFNxdy4C|Town planning in Ancient India}}, {{ISBN|978-81-8205-487-5}}; See critical review by LD Barnett, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, Vol 4, Issue 2, June 1926, pp 391&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Proposals tracing potential links of the principles of composition in ''Vastu Shastra'' and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] have been made, but [[Kapila Vatsyayan]] is reluctant to speculate on such links given the Indus Valley script remains undeciphered.&lt;ref name="Singer1991p117"&gt;{{cite book|author=Milton Singer|title=Semiotics of Cities, Selves, and Cultures: Explorations in Semiotic Anthropology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e9G6h1EfTTwC&amp;pg=PA117 |year=1991|publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-085775-7|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chakrabarti, Vastu Vidya is as old the Vedic period and linked to the ritual architecture.&lt;ref name="Chakrabarti2013p1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vibhuti Chakrabarti|title=Indian Architectural Theory and Practice: Contemporary Uses of Vastu Vidya|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XgmakH37M0UC&amp;pg=PA1|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-77882-7|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Michael W. Meister]], the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'' contains verses with mystic cosmogony which provide a paradigm for cosmic planning, but they did not represent architecture nor a developed practice.&lt;ref name="Buhnemann2003p251"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gudrun Bühnemann|title=Mandalas and Yantras in the Hindu Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQf2m8VaC_oC&amp;pg=PA251 |year=2003|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-12902-2|pages=251–254}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Varahamihira]]'s ''Brihat Samhita'' dated to the sixth century CE, states Meister, is the first known Indian text that describes "something like a ''vastupurusamandala'' to plan cities and buildings".&lt;ref name="Buhnemann2003p251"/&gt; The emergence of Vastu vidya as a specialized field of science is speculated to have occurred significantly before the 1st-century CE.&lt;ref name="Chakrabarti2013p1"/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Plan of Kandariya Mahadeva temple.jpg|thumb|360px|Ancient India produced many Sanskrit manuals of architecture, called Vastu Sastra. Many of these are about Hindu temple layout (above), design and construction, along with chapters on design principles for houses, villages, towns. The architect and artists (Silpins) were given wide latitude to experiment and express their creativity.&lt;ref name=mmgeometry/&gt;]]
There exist many Vastu-Sastras on the art of building houses, temples, towns and cities. One such Vastu Sastra is by [[Thakkura Pheru]], describing where and how temples should be built.&lt;ref name=stellakramrisch76&gt;Stella Kramrisch (1976), The Hindu Temple Volume 1 &amp; 2, {{ISBN|81-208-0223-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jack Hebner (2010), Architecture of the Vastu Sastra - According to Sacred Science, in Science of the Sacred (Editor: David Osborn), {{ISBN|978-0557277247}}, pp 85-92; N Lahiri (1996), Archaeological landscapes and textual images: a study of the sacred geography of late medieval Ballabgarh, World Archaeology, 28(2), pp 244-264&lt;/ref&gt; By 6th century AD, Sanskrit manuals for constructing palatial temples were in circulation in India.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Lewandowski (1984), Buildings and Society: Essays on the Social Development of the Built Environment, edited by Anthony D. King, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0710202345}}, Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; Vastu-Sastra manuals included chapters on home construction, town planning,&lt;ref name=bbdutt/&gt; and how efficient villages, towns and kingdoms integrated temples, water bodies and gardens within them to achieve harmony with nature.&lt;ref name="GD Vasudev 2001 pp 74-92"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherri Silverman 2007"/&gt; While it is unclear, states Barnett,&lt;ref&gt;LD Barnett, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, Vol 4, Issue 2, June 1926, pp 391&lt;/ref&gt; as to whether these temple and town planning texts were theoretical studies and if or when they were properly implemented in practice, the manuals suggest that town planning and Hindu temples were conceived as ideals of art and integral part of Hindu social and spiritual life.&lt;ref name=bbdutt/&gt;

The ''Silpa Prakasa'' of Odisha, authored by Ramachandra Bhattaraka Kaulachara sometime in ninth or tenth century CE, is another Vastu Sastra.&lt;ref name=aliceboner66&gt;Alice Boner and Sadāśiva Rath Śarmā (1966), {{Google books|itQUAAAAIAAJ|Silpa Prakasa Medieval Orissan Sanskrit Text on Temple Architecture}}, E.J. Brill (Netherlands)&lt;/ref&gt; Silpa Prakasa describes the geometric principles in every aspect of the temple and symbolism such as 16 emotions of human beings carved as 16 types of female figures. These styles were perfected in Hindu temples prevalent in eastern states of India. Other ancient texts found expand these architectural principles, suggesting that different parts of India developed, invented and added their own interpretations. For example, in ''Saurastra'' tradition of temple building found in western states of India, the feminine form, expressions and emotions are depicted in 32 types of ''Nataka-stri'' compared to 16 types described in ''Silpa Prakasa''.&lt;ref name=aliceboner66/&gt; Silpa Prakasa provides brief introduction to 12 types of Hindu temples. Other texts, such as ''Pancaratra Prasada Prasadhana'' compiled by Daniel Smith&lt;ref&gt;H. Daniel Smith (1963), Ed. Pāncarātra prasāda prasādhapam, A Pancaratra Text on Temple-Building, Syracuse: University of Rochester, {{OCLC|68138877}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Silpa Ratnakara compiled by Narmada Sankara&lt;ref&gt;Mahanti and Mahanty (1995 Reprint), Śilpa Ratnākara, Orissa Akademi, {{OCLC|42718271}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide a more extensive list of Hindu temple types.

Ancient Sanskrit manuals for temple construction discovered in Rajasthan, in northwestern region of India, include Sutradhara Mandana’s ''Prasadamandana'' (literally, manual for planning and building a temple) with chapters on town building.&lt;ref&gt;Amita Sinha (1998), Design of Settlements in the Vaastu Shastras, Journal of Cultural Geography, 17(2), pp 27-41, {{doi|10.1080/08873639809478319}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Manasara shilpa'' and ''Mayamata'', texts of South Indian origin, estimated to be in circulation by 5th to 7th century AD, is a guidebook on South Indian Vastu design and construction.&lt;ref name=stellakramrisch76/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tillotson, G.

These ancient ''Vastu Sastras'', often discuss and describe the principles of Hindu temple design, but do not limit themselves to the design of a Hindu temple.&lt;ref&gt;S Bafna, On the Idea of the Mandala as a Governing Device in Indian Architectural Tradition, Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, Vol. 59, No. 1 (Mar., 2000), pp. 26-49&lt;/ref&gt; They describe the temple as a holistic part of its community, and lay out various principles and a diversity of alternate designs for home, village and city layout along with the temple, gardens, water bodies and nature.&lt;ref name="Sherri Silverman 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name=stellakvolm1&gt;[[Stella Kramrisch]], The Hindu Temple, Vol 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-81-208-0222-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mandala types and properties==
[[File:64 grid Manduka design Hindu Temple Floor Plan Vastu Purusa Mandala Ancient Architecture.svg|thumb|220px|The 8x8 (64) grid Manduka Vastu Purusha Mandala layout for [[Hindu Temple]]s. It is one of 32 Vastu Purusha Mandala grid patterns described in Vastu sastras. In this grid structure of symmetry, each concentric layer has significance.&lt;ref name=stellakramrisch76/&gt;]]
The central area in all [[mandala]] is the [[Brahmasthana]]. Mandala "circle-circumference" or "completion", is a concentric diagram having spiritual and ritual significance in both Hinduism and Buddhism. The space occupied by it varies in different [[mandala]] – in ''Pitha'' (9) and ''Upapitha'' (25) it occupies one square module, in ''Mahaapitha'' (16), ''Ugrapitha'' (36) and ''Manduka'' (64), four square modules and in ''Sthandila'' (49) and ''Paramasaayika'' (81), nine square modules.&lt;ref name=vcm/&gt; The Pitha is an amplified Prithvimandala in which, according to some texts, the central space is occupied by earth. The Sthandila mandala is used in a concentric manner.&lt;ref name=vcm&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vibhuti Chakrabarti|title=Indian Architectural Theory: Contemporary Uses of Vastu Vidya|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0700711130|pages=86–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important [[mandala]] is the Manduka/ Chandita Mandala of 64 squares and the Paramasaayika Mandala of 81 squares. The normal position of the Vastu Purusha (head in the northeast, legs in the southwest) is as depicted in the Paramasaayika Mandala. However, in the Manduka Mandala the Vastu Purusha is depicted with the head facing east and the feet facing west. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
[[File:Vastu direction chakar.jpg|thumb|vastu directional chakara]]
It is believed that every piece of a land or a building has a soul of its own and that soul is known as Vastu Purusha.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rockingbaba.com/blog/index.php/2015/07/06/vastu-for-beginners-blog-3/&lt;/ref&gt;

A site of any shape can be divided using the Pada Vinyasa. Sites are known by the number of squares. They range from 1x1 to 32x32 (1024) square sites. Examples of mandalas with the corresponding names of sites include:&lt;ref name=stellakramrisch76/&gt;
* ''Sakala'' (1 square) corresponds to ''Eka-pada'' (single divided site)
* ''Pechaka'' (4 squares) corresponds to ''Dwi-pada'' (two divided site)
* ''Pitha'' (9 squares) corresponds to ''Tri-pada'' (three divided site)
* ''Mahaapitha'' (16 squares) corresponds to ''Chatush-pada'' (four divided site)
* ''Upapitha'' (25 squares) corresponds to ''Pancha-pada'' (five divided site)
* ''Ugrapitha'' (36 squares) corresponds to ''Shashtha-pada'' (six divided site)
* ''Sthandila'' (49 squares) corresponds to ''Sapta-pada'' (seven divided site)
* ''Manduka/ Chandita'' (64 square) corresponds to ''Ashta-pada'' (eight divided site))
* ''Paramasaayika'' (81 squares) corresponds to ''Nava-pada'' (nine divided site)
* ''Aasana'' (100 squares) corresponds to ''Dasa-pada'' (ten divided site)
* ''Bhadrmahasan'' (196 squares) corresponds to ''Chodah-pada'' (14 divided sites)

==Modern adaptations and usage==
[[File:Plan, Jawahar Kala Kendra, Jaipur, Rajasthan.JPG|thumb|Vastu Shastra-inspired plan adapted and evolved by modern architect [[Charles Correa]] in the design of Jawahar Kala Kendra, Jaipur, Rajasthan.&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt;&lt;ref name=kpg1/&gt;]]

Vastu sastra represents a body of ancient concepts and knowledge to many modern architects, a guideline but not a rigid code.&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt;&lt;ref name=vc1/&gt; The square-grid mandala is viewed as a model of organization, not as a ground plan. The ancient Vastu sastra texts describe functional relations and adaptable alternate layouts for various rooms or buildings and utilities, but do not mandate a set compulsory architecture. Sachdev and Tillotson state that the mandala is a guideline, and employing the mandala concept of Vastu sastra does not mean every room or building has to be square.&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt; The basic theme is around core elements of central space, peripheral zones, direction with respect to sunlight, and relative functions of the spaces.&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt;&lt;ref name=vc1/&gt;

The pink city [[Jaipur]] in Rajasthan was master planned by Rajput king [[Jai Singh II|Jai Singh]] and built by 1727 CE, in part around Vastu Shilpa Sastra principles.&lt;ref name=vsgt2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vibhuti Sachdev, Giles Tillotson|title=Building Jaipur: The Making of an Indian City|date=2004|isbn=978-1861891372|pages=155–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nus1&gt;[http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/gem-projects/hm/0203-1-07-jantar_mantar.pdf Jantar Mantar &amp; Jaipur - Section II] National University of Singapore, pp. 17-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nus1/&gt; Similarly, modern era projects such as the architect [[Charles Correa]]'s designed [[Gandhi Smarak Sangrahalaya]] in [[Ahmedabad]], Vidhan Bhavan in [[Bhopal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Irena Murray|title=Charles Correa: India's Greatest Architect|date=2011|publisher=RIBA Publishing|isbn=978-1859465172}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jawahar Kala Kendra]] in Jaipur, adapt and apply concepts from the Vastu Shastra Vidya.&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt;&lt;ref name=vc1&gt;{{cite book|last1=V Chakrabarti|title=Indian Architectural Theory: Contemporary Uses of Vastu Vidya|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0700711130|date=2013|pages=86–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the design of [[Chandigarh]] city, [[Le Corbusier]] incorporated modern architecture theories with those of Vastu Shastra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=SAJAH|date=2011|volume=26|issue=3|pages=45–56|author=Gerald Steyn|title=Le Corbusier’s research-based design approaches|url=http://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/20055/Steyn_LeCorbusier(2011).pdf?sequence=1|publisher=Tshwane University of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=H Saini|title=Vaastu ordains a full flowering for Chandigarh|date=1996|publisher=The Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reena Patra|title=Vaastu Shastra: Towards Sustainable Development|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2009|volume=17|pages=244–256|publisher=Wiley InterScience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the colonial rule period of India, town planning officials of the [[British Raj]] did not consider Vastu Vidya, but largely grafted Islamic Mughal era motifs and designs such as domes and arches onto Victorian-era style buildings without overall relationship layout.&lt;ref name=vsgt3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anthony D'Costa|title=A New India?: Critical Reflections in the Long Twentieth Century|pages=165–168|isbn=978-0857285041}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement, later known as the Indo-Saracenic style, is found in chaotically laid out, but externally grand structures in the form of currently used major railway stations, harbors, tax collection buildings, and other colonial offices in South Asia.&lt;ref name=vsgt3&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vibhuti Sachdev, Giles Tillotson|title=Building Jaipur: The Making of an Indian City|date=2004|isbn=978-1861891372|pages=149–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vastu sastra vidya was ignored, during colonial era construction, for several reasons. These texts were viewed by 19th and early 20th century architects as archaic, the literature was inaccessible being in an ancient language not spoken or read by the architects, and the ancient texts assumed space to be readily available.&lt;ref name=vc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=vsgt3/&gt; In contrast, public projects in the colonial era were forced into crowded spaces and local layout constraints, and the ancient Vastu sastra were viewed with prejudice as superstitious and rigid about a square grid or traditional materials of construction.&lt;ref name=vsgt3/&gt; Sachdev and Tillotson state that these prejudices were flawed, as a scholarly and complete reading of the Vastu sastra literature amply suggests the architect is free to adapt the ideas to new materials of construction, local layout constraints and into a non-square space.&lt;ref name=vsgt3/&gt;&lt;ref name=vc2&gt;{{cite book|last1=V Chakrabarti|title=Indian Architectural Theory: Contemporary Uses of Vastu Vidya|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0700711130|date=2013|pages=86–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design and completion of a new city of [[Jaipur]] in early 1700s based on Vastu sastra texts, well before any colonial era public projects, was one of many proofs.&lt;ref name=vsgt3/&gt;&lt;ref name=vc2/&gt; Other examples include modern public projects designed by [[Charles Correa]] such as Jawahar Kala Kendra in Jaipur, and Gandhi Ashram in Ahmedabad.&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt;&lt;ref name=kpg1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klaus-Peter Gast|title=Modern Traditions: Contemporary Architecture in India|page=11|isbn=978-3764377540|date=2011|publisher=Birkhäuser Architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vastu Shastra remedies have also been applied by Khushdeep Bansal in 1997 to the Parliament complex of India, when he contented that the library being built next to the building is responsible for political instability in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi/harmonising-homes-hearts/story-UR90utlqvNojXaolxBmtNN.html | title=‘Harmonising’ homes, hearts | publisher=[[Hindustan Times]] | date= 9 June 2012 | accessdate= 4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German architect Klaus-Peter Gast states that the principles of Vastu Shastras is witnessing a major revival and wide usage in the planning and design of individual homes, residential complexes, commercial and industrial campuses, and major public projects in India, along with the use of ancient iconography and mythological art work incorporated into the Vastu vidya architectures.&lt;ref name=kpg1/&gt;&lt;ref name=sm1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stephen Marshall|title=Urban Coding and Planning|pages=83–103|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415441261|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vastu and superstition ===
{{see also|Superstition in India#Vastu Shastra}}
The use of ''Vastu shastra'' and ''Vastu consultants'' in modern home and public projects is controversial.&lt;ref name=vc2/&gt; Some architects, particularly during India's colonial era, considered it arcane and superstitious.&lt;ref name=vc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=vsgt3/&gt; Other architects state that critics have not read the texts and that most of the text is about flexible design guidelines for space, sunlight, flow and function.&lt;ref name=vc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=sm1/&gt;

Vastu Shastra is considered as pseudoscience by rationalists like [[Narendra Nayak]] of [[Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations]].&lt;ref name=OUP-Johannes&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quack|first1=Johannes|title=Disenchanting India: Organized Rationalism and Criticism of Religion in India|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=170|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=TNbxUwhS5RUC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientist and astronomer [[Jayant Narlikar]] considers Vastu Shastra as pseudoscience and writes that Vastu does not have any "logical connection" to the environment.&lt;ref name="narlikar_CUP"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Narlikar|first1=Jayant V.|editor1-last=Percy|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Pasachoff|editor2-first=Jay|title=Teaching and Learning Astronomy: Effective Strategies for Educators Worldwide|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=165|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=mdzQ4uCnYfkC&amp;pg=PA165|chapter=Astronomy, pseudoscience and rational thinking}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the examples cited by Narlikar arguing the absence of logical connection is the Vastu rule, "sites shaped like a triangle ... will lead to government harassment, ... parallelogram can lead to quarrels in the family." Narlikar notes that sometimes the building plans are changed and what has already been built is demolished to accommodate for Vastu rules.&lt;ref name="narlikar_CUP"/&gt; Regarding superstitious beliefs in Vastu, Science writer [[Meera Nanda]] cites the case of [[N.T.Rama Rao]], the ex-chief minister of [[Andhra Pradesh]], who sought the help of Vastu consultants for his political problems. Rama Rao was advised that his problems would be solved if he entered his office from an east facing gate. Accordingly, a slum on the east facing side of his office was ordered to be demolished, to make way for his car's entrance.&lt;ref name=Sokal&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sokal|first1=Alan|title=Beyond the Hoax: Science, Philosophy and Culture|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=306–307|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=SjBdUTpf184C&amp;pg=PT407}}&lt;/ref&gt; The knowledge of Vastu consultants is questioned by Pramod Kumar (citation required), "Ask the Vaastu folks if they know civil engineering or architecture or the local government rules on construction or minimum standards of construction to advise people on buildings. They will get into a barrage of "ancient" texts and "science" that smack of the pseudo-science of astrology. Ask them where they were before the construction boom and if they will go to slum tenements to advise people or advise on low-cost community-housing—you draw a blank."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kumar|first1=Pramod|title=Akshaya Tritiya and the great Indian superstition industry|url=http://www.firstpost.com/business/akshaya-tritiya-and-the-great-indian-superstition-industry-781471.html|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Firstpost|date=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanskrit treatises on architecture==
Of the numerous Sanskrit treatises mentioned in ancient Indian literature, some have been translated in English. Many Agamas, Puranas and Hindu scriptures include chapters on architecture of temples, homes, villages, towns, fortifications, streets, shop layout, public wells, public bathing, public halls, gardens, river fronts among other things.&lt;ref name=pka/&gt; In some cases, the manuscripts are partially lost, some are available only in Tibetan, Nepalese or South Indian languages, while in others original Sanskrit manuscripts are available in different parts of India. Some treatises, or books with chapters on Vaastu Shastra include:&lt;ref name=pka&gt;Acharya P.K.
