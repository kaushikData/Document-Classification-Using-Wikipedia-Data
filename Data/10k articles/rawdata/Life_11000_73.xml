'''Abdullah ibn Omayr Abu Wahab al Kalbi''' was one of the [[List of casualties in Husayn's army at the Battle of Karbala|Companions]] of [[Husayn ibn Ali]], who was killed along with him in the [[battle of Karbala]].  Wahab Al Kalbi joined [[Husayn ibn Ali]] in [[Karbala]] and fought alongside him.  He belonged to Al Kalb tribe majority of whom were adherents of [[Christianity]] at that time.&lt;ref name="almujtaba"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.almujtaba.com/articles/karbala/000673.html|title= The Story of Karbala - Part 5 ABDULLAH BIN WAHB AL-KALBI |accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His mother, Umm Wahab was amongst the female [[List of casualties in Husayn's army at the Battle of Karbala|casualties in Husayn's army at the Battle of Karbala]].&lt;ref name="islamquery"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.islamquery.com/documents/companions%20of%20Imam%20Husain.pdf|title= The second phase of the battle of Karbala|accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manfarid"&gt;{{cite book|last=Manfarid | first=Ali Nazari | title= The story of Karbala, translated from Persian by Sayid Husain Alamdar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Naqvi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Naqvi | first=Sayed Mohsin| title= The tragedy of Karbala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and conversion to Islam==
Wahab was a [[Christian]] by birth and [[converted to Islam]]. He was a known businessperson of [[Kufa]].&lt;ref name="islamquery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Manfarid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Naqvi"/&gt;  Wahab discussed with his mother and wife before converting to [[Islam]] and later joining [[Husayn ibn Ali|Al Husayn ibn Ali]] in the battle against [[Yazid I|Yazid]]'s forces. Wahab was returning from [[Kufa]] after getting married.  He was still seventeen years and his wife was just twelve years old.  When Wahab was passing from [[Karbala]] he saw [[Husayn ibn Ali]] surrounded by the enemies and was along with his family and very few friends.

Wahab was inspired by [[Husayn ibn Ali|Al Husayn’s]] spiritual charisma in such a manner that he was reluctant to leave him despite of being aware about the consequences of staying with [[Husayn ibn Ali]].  Wahab was a tall and masculine man with broad shoulders, who was held with very high esteem among his people, and was known of his courage and soldierly experience.&lt;ref name="Al Muqarram190191"&gt;{{cite book|last=Al Muqarram | first=Abd al Razzaq | title= Maqtal Al Husayn: Martyrdom Epic of Imam al Husain [as]  | chapter= The First Campaign| pages=190–191  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the preceding night of [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]] the following conversion was held between Wahab and his mother:&lt;ref name="almujtaba"/&gt;

Wahab asked her: 'Mother! What should I do in this situation?' The mother asked Wahab: 'How do you feel yourself, my son?' Wahab said: 'In my opinion [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]] is on the just path and it would be [[cowardly]] and against all traditions of Arab [[chivalry]] and gallantry to leave the side of a man so isolated and surrounded by blood-thirsty enemies.' The mother said: 'But that means definite death.' Wahab replied: 'Yes I know, but my heart tells me that this is the right thing to do, in these circumstances.' The mother then said: 'If that is how you feel then we will stay with [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]].'

Wahab’s mother then pleaded on his behalf and said:&lt;ref name="almujtaba"/&gt;

"O grandson of the [[Mohammad|prophet of Islam]] ! It will be an honor for me if my son fights for you and gives his life protecting you." [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]] was still reluctant to accept Wahab as one of his soldiers and advised him not to risk his life that too in a matter which concerns [[Muslims]]. When Abu  Wahab saw this, he said:

'O grandson of the [[Mohammad|prophet of Islam]]! If that is the case then, from this moment on, I am a [[Muslim]].'
Wahab testified (Kalimah)&lt;ref name="almujtaba"/&gt; that:
“There is none worth worshiping besides [[Allah]] and [[Mohammad]] is His messenger”

==Wahab's Duel in Battle of Karbala==
After Wahab converted to [[Islam]], he was granted permission by [[Husayn ibn Ali]] to fight the [[Yazid I|Yazid]]'s forces on his side. In the first campaign of [[battle of Karbala]], Yasir, [[Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan|Ziyad's]] slave and Salim, [[Ibn Ziyad|Ibn Ziyad's]] slave set out and challenged anyone from [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn ibn Ali's]] army to have a duel with them.  At this, [[Habib ibn Muzahir|Habib ibn Mazahir]] and Burayr expressed their desire to take up the challenge nevertheless they were denied permission by [[Husayn ibn Ali]].&lt;ref name="Al Muqarram190191"/&gt;  When Wahab asked for the permission, [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]] granted him permission believing him to be match for both the challengers.&lt;ref name="Al Muqarram190191"/&gt;

Wahab stepped into the battlefield and the challengers asked his identity to which he introduced himself. However they could not recognize him and asked either [[Zuhayr ibn Qayn]], [[Habib ibn Muzahir]] or Burayr to fight them.  Yasir was standing nearby to whom Wahab said "You son of the adulteress! Do you not wish to fight me?!"&lt;ref name="Al Muqarram190191"/&gt; saying this he attacked Yasir and engaged him in a sword duel but at the same time Salim charged at him with his sword.  Wahab while protecting himself lost fingers of his left hand and in retaliatory attack he killed Salim and Yasir.  After killing both of them he moved back to Al Husayn while reciting Martial poetry.&lt;ref name="Al Muqarram190191"/&gt;

Umm Wahab was watching every thing.  After witnessing a brave combat of her son she came to Wahab and said: “May both my parents be sacrificed for you! Do defend the good ones, the offspring of [[Muhammed]], [[Allah|Allah's]] peace and blessings be upon him and his progeny!”&lt;ref name="Al Muqarram190191"/&gt;

She did not leave and wanted to die with him, however [[Husayn ibn Ali]] intervened and said: “May you be well rewarded on behalf of your Prophet's [[Ahl al-Bayt]]! Go back to the tent! Women are not required to fight!” and she followed the instructions.&lt;ref name="Al Muqarram190191"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tabari | first=Al | title= Tarikh | volume= 06| page=245 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al Athir, Ibn. 04. p. 037.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==

Wahab participated in the retaliatory attack when [[Shimr Ibn Thil-Jawshan|Al Shimr]] attacked [[Husayn ibn Ali|Al Husayn's]] right wing. Wahab in that engagement killed 31 of them, of which 19 were Horsemen and 12 were Footmen. His right hand was severed by Hani ibn thabit al Hadrami&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ashub | first=Ibn Shahr | title= Al Manaqib | volume= 02| page=217 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and left hand by Bakr ibn Hayy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al Athir | first=Ibn | title= Maqtal al Husayn | volume= 02| page=013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; having left without arms he was taken captive and killed on that spot.&lt;ref name="Al Muqarram194"&gt;{{cite book|last=Al Muqarram | first=Abd al Razzaq | title= Maqtal Al Husayn: Martyrdom Epic of Imam al Husain [as]  | chapter= The Left Wing| page=194  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wahab was then [[Decapitation|beheaded]] and his head was thrown towards [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn ibn Ali's]] camp, it was picked up by his mother, she took it, wiped the blood from it then ran in the direction of the enemy forces. [[Husayn ibn Ali]] sent her back saying, “Go back, may [[Allah]] have mercy on you, for you are exempted from participating in [[Jihad]].” She went back saying, “O [[Allah]]! Do not disappoint me!” [[Husayn ibn Ali|Al Husayn]] said to her, “May [[Allah]] never disappoint you!”&lt;ref name="Al Muqarram194"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al Qazwini | first=Radiyy Al Deen | title= Tazallum Al Zahra  | page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death of Umm Wahab at Karbala ==
Umm Wahab, wife of Abu Wahab was the daughter of Abdullah, who belonged to Al Nimr ibn Qasit, was reported to have approached [[Husayn ibn Ali]] and asked him 'Are you the rightful [[Imam]] ?' [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]] replied: 'Yes, I am.' She said: 'Then if Wahab dies protecting you, he would go to the Paradise?' [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]] said: 'Yes, he would.' Then she said:'Can you promise me that you would not let Wahab enter Paradise without me ?' [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]] said:' Yes, I promise you, you and Wahab will enter Paradise together.'&lt;ref name="almujtaba"/&gt;

When Wahab was killed, she walked towards his [[corpse]] and sat by his headless body, saying, “Congratulations for having earned Paradise! I plead to [[Allah]] Who blessed you with Paradise to make me join you.” [[Shimr Ibn Thil-Jawshan|Al Shimr]] heard her and ordered his slave Rustam to hit her head with a rod or mace, which he did. She died there.&lt;ref name="Al Muqarram194"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al Tabari | first=Al | title= Tarikh | volume= 06| page=251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahmad | first= | title= Musnad| volume= 02| page=100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23908">Normal '''aging movement control''' in humans is about the changes in the [[muscle]]s, [[motor neuron]]s, [[Nervous system|nerves]], [[Sensory neuron|sensory functions]], [[gait]], fatigue, visual and manual responses, in men and women as they get older but who do not have [[Neurological disorder|neurological]], muscular ([[muscular atrophy|atrophy]], [[muscular dystrophy|dystrophy]]...) or [[neuromuscular disease|neuromuscular]] disorder. With aging, neuromuscular movements are impaired, though with training or practice, some aspects may be prevented.

==Force production==

For voluntary force production, [[action potential]]s occur in the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]]. They propagate in the [[spinal cord]], the [[motor neuron]]s and the set of [[Skeletal striated muscle|muscle fibers]] they innervate. This results in a [[Muscle contraction|twitch]] which properties are driven by two mechanisms: [[motor unit recruitment]] and [[rate coding]]. Both mechanisms are affected with aging. For instance, the number of [[motor unit]]s may decrease, the size of the motor units, i.e. the number of muscle fibers they innervate may increase, the frequency at which the action potentials are triggered may be reduced. Consequently, force production is generally impaired in old adults.&lt;ref name="12x"&gt;Neuromechanics of human movement, chapter 6 Single-joint system function; Roger M. Enoka.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aging is associated with decreases in muscle mass and [[physical strength|strength]]. These decreases may be partially due to losses of [[alpha motor neurons]]. By the age of 70, these losses occur in both [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal and distal muscles]]. In [[Biceps brachii muscle|biceps brachii]] and [[Brachialis muscle|brachialis]], old adults show decreased strength (by 1/3) correlated with a reduction in the number of motor units (by 1/2). Old adults show evidence that remaining motor units may become larger as motor units innervate collateral muscle fibers.&lt;ref name="Doherty 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Doherty TJ, Vandervoort AA, Taylor AW, Brown WF |title=Effects of motor unit losses on strength in older men and women |journal=J. Appl. Physiol. |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=868–74 |date=February 1993 |pmid=8458808 |url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/74/2/868.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Dorsal interossei of the hand|first dorsal interosseus]], almost all motor units are recruited at moderate rate coding, leading to 30-40% of [[muscle contraction|maximal voluntary contraction]] (MVC). Motor unit [[Rate coding|discharge rates]] measured at 50% MVC are not significantly different in the young subjects from those observed in the old adults. However, for the maximal effort contractions, there is an appreciable difference in discharge rates between the two age groups. Discharge rates obtained at 100% of MVC are 64% smaller in the old adults than in the young subjects: 31.1 ± 11.8 impulses/s in the old subjects, 50.9 ± 19.5 impulses/s in the young subjects.&lt;ref name="Kamen 1995"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kamen G, Sison SV, Du CC, Patten C |title=Motor unit discharge behavior in older adults during maximal-effort contractions |journal=J. Appl. Physiol. |volume=79 |issue=6 |pages=1908–13 |date=December 1995 |pmid=8847252 |doi= |url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/79/6/1908.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muscle contraction#Isometric contraction|Isometric strength]] and [[Pennate muscle#Physiological cross sectional area .28PCSA.29|physical cross-sectional area]] of the [[elbow]] [[flexion|flexors]] and elbow [[Extension (kinesiology)|extensors]] are reduced in old compared with young men. The normalized force (maximal voluntary force to the size of the muscle producing the force) of the elbow extensors is the same for old and young people. The normalized force for the elbow flexors is reduced in the old men compared to the young men. The lower normalized force of the elbow flexors may be due to an increase in [[Agonist muscle|agonist]]-[[Antagonist muscle|antagonist]] muscles [[Coactivation (Muscular)|coactivation]].&lt;ref name="Klein 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Klein CS, Rice CL, Marsh GD |title=Normalized force, activation, and coactivation in the arm muscles of young and old men |journal=J. Appl. Physiol. |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=1341–9 |date=September 2001 |pmid=11509534 |doi= |url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/91/3/1341.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to the young group, the old group has lower [[Dorsiflexion|dorsiflexors]] isometric [[torque]] at all angles, has lower [[knee]] extensors isometric torque at angles &gt;90°. The impairment in force production is muscle specific. During [[Isometric exercise#Comparison with dynamic exercises|dynamic]] exercise, the old group requires more time to reach a target velocity and is less able to attain high velocities. The slowing of voluntary contractile speed with age seems to play a role in the loss of dynamic torque.&lt;ref name="Lanza 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lanza IR, Towse TF, Caldwell GE, Wigmore DM, Kent-Braun JA |title=Effects of age on human muscle torque, velocity, and power in two muscle groups |journal=J. Appl. Physiol. |volume=95 |issue=6 |pages=2361–9 |date=December 2003 |pmid=12923120 |doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00724.2002 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sensory function==

The detection of a [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] by a [[Sensory receptor|receptor]] in the [[Afferent nerve fiber|afferent nerve terminals]] (vs [[efferent nerve fiber|efferent nerve terminals]]) is useful to protect the body against unexpected disturbances. Studies in post-mortem subjects support that the thickness of [[muscle spindle]] capsules increases with age. There is a slight decrease in the number of [[Intrafusal muscle fiber|intrafusal fibers]] in the oldest subjects. Some spindles show changes consistent with denervation associated with grouped denervation [[atrophy]]. Age-related changes are observed in fine structure of spindle nerve [[nerve|innervation]] in the form of [[axon]]al swelling and expanded/abnormal [[joint|endplates]].&lt;ref name="Swash 1972"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Swash M, Fox KP |title=The effect of age on human skeletal muscle. Studies of the morphology and innervation of muscle spindles |journal=J. Neurol. Sci. |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=417–32 |date=August 1972 |pmid=4261815 |doi=10.1016/0022-510X(72)90048-2 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When subject to a task of [[proprioception]], the elderly show increased [[Coactivation (Transcription)|cocontraction]] of agonist-antagonist muscles, perhaps to increase [[Gamma motoneuron|gamma drive]] and spindle sensitivity. It is believed to be used for postural control. Despite a cocontraction strategy, old adults have higher reaction time and also make greater errors in estimating the position of their [[ankle]]. The elderly subjects with greater errors for the dynamic position sense also perform poorly on the single limb stance eyes closed test.&lt;ref name="Madhavan 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Madhavan S, Shields RK |title=Influence of age on dynamic position sense: evidence using a sequential movement task |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=164 |issue=1 |pages=18–28 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15776224 |doi=10.1007/s00221-004-2208-3 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Old adults sway more than young adults while maintaining upright standing posture, especially with eyes closed with a narrow base of support. Young adults show “resourcefulness” by shifting from one sensory input ([[Visual system|vision]]) to another ([[Somatosensory system|somatosensory]]) whereas old adults do not rely on the variety of sensory inputs but rather respond by stiffening their ankles across tasks (wide base of support vs narrow base of support, eyes open vs eyes closed).&lt;ref name="Benjuya 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Benjuya N, Melzer I, Kaplanski J |title=Aging-induced shifts from a reliance on sensory input to muscle cocontraction during balanced standing |journal=J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=166–71 |date=February 2004 |pmid=14999032 |doi=10.1093/gerona/59.2.M166 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sensory receptors can initiate rapid responses to perturbations thanks to short-latency connections between afferent innervations and motor units. Yet, aging results in decreases in motor conduction velocities. This may be due to losses of the fastest conducting motor units. There is also evidence of slowing of both fast and slow conducting axons which can be explained by decreases in axon diameter through [[myelin|demyelination]], by reduction of [[internodal segment|internodal length]]. Some studies suggest an overall decrease in the number of myelinated fibers.&lt;ref name="Wang 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang FC, de Pasqua V, Delwaide PJ |title=Age-related changes in fastest and slowest conducting axons of thenar motor units |journal=Muscle Nerve |volume=22 |issue=8 |pages=1022–9 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10417782 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4598(199908)22:8&lt;1022::AID-MUS3&gt;3.0.CO;2-F |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aging results in slowed reaction time in an aiming task for both [[eye]] and [[hand]] movements. Comparisons between young and old adults who have to follow a target only with their eyes or with a [[laser]] in their hand, show that parameters indicative of motor function such as velocity, duration, and amplitude of initial movement are unchanged. However the duration of corrective movement is longer for old adults. It suggests an impairment to sensory system.&lt;ref name="Warabi 1986"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Warabi T, Noda H, Kato T |title=Effect of aging on sensorimotor functions of eye and hand movements |journal=Exp. Neurol. |volume=92 |issue=3 |pages=686–97 |date=June 1986 |pmid=3709742 |doi=10.1016/0014-4886(86)90309-2 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Walking gait==

When confronted to an unexpected slip or trip during walking, compared to young adults, old adults have a less effective [[Balance (ability)|balance]] strategy: smaller and slower postural muscle responses, altered temporal and spatial organization of the postural response, agonist-antagonist muscles coactivation and greater upper trunk instability. Comparing control and slip conditions, after the perturbation, young adults have a longer stride length, a longer stride duration, and the same walk velocity whereas old adults have a shorter stride length, the same stride duration, and a lower walk velocity.&lt;ref name="Tang 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Tang | first1 = PF. | last2 = Woollacott | first2 = MH. | title = Inefficient postural responses to unexpected slips during walking in older adults. | journal = J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci | volume = 53 | issue = 6 | pages = M471-80 |date=Nov 1998 | doi =  10.1093/gerona/53A.6.M471 | PMID = 9823752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an experiment, for a single-task walking, 24% of old adults have [[gait]] speed &lt;0.8&amp;nbsp;m/s but for a [[Dual-task paradigm|dual-task]] of walking and talking, 62% of old adults have gait speed &lt;0.8&amp;nbsp;m/s. In practical terms, this means that a large proportion of healthy community-dwelling old adults may not walk fast enough to safely cross the street while simultaneously having a conversation. These findings support the assertion that generating spontaneous speech is highly demanding on [[cognition|cognitive]] resources and suggest that real world dual-task effects on gait may be underestimated by reaction time tasks.&lt;ref name="Plummer-D'Amato 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Plummer-D'Amato | first1 = P. | last2 = Altmann | first2 = LJ. | last3 = Reilly | first3 = K. | title = Dual-task effects of spontaneous speech and executive function on gait in aging: exaggerated effects in slow walkers. | journal = Gait &amp; Posture | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 233–7 |date=Feb 2011 | doi = 10.1016/j.gaitpost.2010.11.011 | PMID = 21193313 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fatigue resistance==

Compared to young adults, old adults exhibit [[muscle fatigue]] (peripheral fatigue) resistance during sustained isometric maximal voluntary contraction, but they show greater supraspinal fatigue at start of sustained task, and during recovery. The first observation reflects changes in [[Muscle fiber#Muscle fibers|fiber]] type ratio; with aging the proportion of type I muscle fibers which are adapted to long effort becomes greater. The second observation is likely a result of cumulative effects of exercise on the [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref name="Hunter 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hunter | first1 = SK. | last2 = Todd | first2 = G. | last3 = Butler | first3 = JE. | last4 = Gandevia | first4 = SC. | last5 = Taylor | first5 = JL. | title = Recovery from supraspinal fatigue is slowed in old adults after fatiguing maximal isometric contractions. | journal = J Appl Physiol | volume = 105 | issue = 4 | pages = 1199–209 |date=Oct 2008 | doi = 10.1152/japplphysiol.01246.2007 | PMID = 18687979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the knee extensors, old adults produce less torque during dynamic or isometric maximal voluntary contractions than young adults. The mechanisms controlling fatigue in the elderly during isometric contractions are not the same as those that influence fatigue during dynamic contractions, while young adults keep the same strategy. The knee extensors of healthy old adults fatigue less during isometric contractions than do those of young adults who had similar levels of habitual physical activity. In contrast, there are no differences between age groups in the fatigue during dynamic contractions.&lt;ref name="Callahan 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Callahan | first1 = DM. | last2 = Foulis | first2 = SA. | last3 = Kent-Braun | first3 = JA. | title = Age-related fatigue resistance in the knee extensor muscles is specific to contraction mode. | journal = Muscle Nerve | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 692–702 |date=May 2009 | doi = 10.1002/mus.21278 | PMID = 19347926 | pmc = 2718567 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speed, dexterity==

For old adults, the decreased [[Saccade|saccadic]] accuracy, prolonged latency, and reduced saccadic velocity may be explained by cerebral cortical degeneration with age. Old adults show reduced amplitude of primary saccades and they generally more saccades to reach fixation. Old adults show significant delay of saccades in all conditions (predictable amplitude and time target steps, unpredictable amplitude target steps, unpredictable time target steps). Age-related slowing is only evident for predictable targets; however other studies have shown otherwise but noted higher variance in speed of old adults.&lt;ref name="Sharpe 1987"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Sharpe | first1 = JA. | last2 = Zackon | first2 = DH. | title = Senescent saccades. Effects of aging on their accuracy, latency and velocity. | journal = Acta Otolaryngol | volume = 104 | issue = 5-6 | pages = 422–8   | year = 1987   | PMID = 3434263 | doi=10.3109/00016488709128270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instructed to look either toward (pro-saccade task) or away from (anti-saccade task) an eccentric target under different conditions of fixation, for young children (5±8 years of age) a long time elapses between the apparition of the target and the onset of the eye movement (Saccadic Reaction Time). Young adults (20±30 years of age) typically have the fastest SRTs. Elderly subjects (60±79 years of age) have slower SRTs and longer duration saccades than any other age groups.&lt;ref name="Munoz 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Munoz | first1 = DP. | last2 = Broughton | first2 = JR. | last3 = Goldring | first3 = JE. | last4 = Armstrong | first4 = IT. | title = Age-related performance of human subjects on saccadic eye movement tasks. | journal = Exp Brain Res | volume = 121 | issue = 4 | pages = 391–400 |date=Aug 1998 | doi = 10.1007/s002210050473 | PMID = 9746145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Old adults exhibit reductions in manual dexterity which is observed through changes in [[finger]]tip force when gripping and/or lifting. Compared to young adults, old adults show an increase in grip force and safety margins (minimum force necessary to prevent a slip). These increases can be explained by skin slipperiness or it may be the result of declining cutaneous information. Force increases are not associated with impaired capacity to modulate fingertip forces smoothly. There is no evidence that old adults were less able to program fingertips based on the memory of a preceding lift.&lt;ref name="Cole 1999"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Cole | first1 = KJ. | last2 = Rotella | first2 = DL. | last3 = Harper | first3 = JG. | title = Mechanisms for age-related changes of fingertip forces during precision gripping and lifting in adults. | journal = J Neurosci | volume = 19 | issue = 8 | pages = 3238–47 |date=Apr 1999 | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/content/19/8/3238.long  | PMID = 10191336 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prismatic grasp (4 fingers in opposition to thumb) which is common in everyday activities, involves the organization of the [[Finger|digits]] into specific tasks and the balance of force/moment production by individual digits. Old adults exhibit an impairment in finger and hand force production. They show excessive grip force which could be related to higher moments produced by antagonist fingers. Both can be viewed as energetically suboptimal but more stable performance.&lt;ref name="Shim 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Shim | first1 = JK. | last2 = Lay | first2 = BS. | last3 = Zatsiorsky | first3 = VM. | last4 = Latash | first4 = ML. | title = Age-related changes in finger coordination in static prehension tasks. | journal = J Appl Physiol | volume = 97 | issue = 1 | pages = 213–24 |date=Jul 2004 | doi = 10.1152/japplphysiol.00045.2004 | PMID = 15003998 | pmc = 2832863 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Old adults often show heightened antagonist muscle coactivation during goal directed movement. Contractions at moderate-to-high force often show activation of other [[Anatomical terms of location#Other directional terms|ipsilateral]] and [[Anatomical terms of location#Other directional terms|contralateral]] muscles. When the intensity of contralateral activity is sufficient to produce movement, this is called “mirror movement”. When asked to follow a unilateral task, young and old adults show concurrent activity in contralateral muscle but it is greater in old adults. Contralateral activity is greater for isometric than for anisometric contractions. Contralateral force is greater for [[Muscle contraction#Eccentric contraction|eccentric]] than [[Muscle contraction#Concentric contraction|concentric]] contractions.&lt;ref name="Shinohara 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Shinohara | first1 = M. | last2 = Keenan | first2 = KG. | last3 = Enoka | first3 = RM. | title = Contralateral activity in a homologous hand muscle during voluntary contractions is greater in old adults. | journal = J Appl Physiol | volume = 94 | issue = 3 | pages = 966–74 |date=Mar 2003 | doi = 10.1152/japplphysiol.00836.2002 | PMID = 12433847 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training consequences==

Type I muscle fiber characteristics (area, number of [[capillary]] contacts, fiber area/capillary contacts) of the [[vastus lateralis]] are unaffected by age. The old men normal fit or trained have smaller type II muscle fiber areas and fewer capillaries surrounding these fibers than do the young men. The capillary supply per unit type II fiber area is not affected by age but is enhanced by training. The old trained men have [[succinate dehydrogenase]] activities within their type IIa muscle fibers similar to those in young men and twofold higher than in old normal fit men.&lt;ref name="Proctor 1995"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Proctor | first1 = DN. | last2 = Sinning | first2 = WE. | last3 = Walro | first3 = JM. | last4 = Sieck | first4 = GC. | last5 = Lemon | first5 = PW. | title = Oxidative capacity of human muscle fiber types: effects of age and training status. | journal = J Appl Physiol | volume = 78 | issue = 6 | pages = 2033–8 |date=Jun 1995 | url = http://jap.physiology.org/content/78/6/2033.abstract | PMID = 7665396 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neural changes like reduced motor unit discharge rates, increased variability of motor unit discharge activity, altered recruitment and derecruitment behavior mediate modifications in muscle control. On the other hand, physiological deleterious factors including motor unit loss, increased motor unit innervation ratios also affect muscle force. Through [[strength training]], old adults can significantly improve their force control. The rapid adaptation suggests modifications in motor unit activation, increased excitability of [[Motor pool (neuroscience)|motoneuron pool]], and decreased antagonist cocontraction.&lt;ref name="Patten 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Patten | first1 = C. | last2 = Kamen | first2 = G. | title = Adaptations in motor unit discharge activity with force control training in young and older human adults. | journal = Eur J Appl Physiol | volume = 83 | issue = 2-3 | pages = 128–43 |date=Oct 2000 | doi = 10.1007/s004210000271 | PMID = 11104053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy resistance and sensorimotor trainings result in increased maximum voluntary contraction and rate force development. But sensorimotor training shows more positive adaptations in postural [[reflex]]es, which is likely due to training of sensory reception/processing, central integration of afferent information, transformation of that information into adequate efferent response. The decreased onset latency and increased magnitude of reflex response with sensorimotor training is associated with increased ankle [[joint]] stiffness during perturbations.&lt;ref name="Granacher 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Granacher | first1 = U. | last2 = Gollhofer | first2 = A. | last3 = Strass | first3 = D. | title = Training induced adaptations in characteristics of postural reflexes in elderly men. | journal = Gait &amp; Posture | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 459–66 |date=Dec 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.gaitpost.2005.12.007 | PMID = 16472525 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked to reach a given level of force at a certain moment in time without any visual feedback, old adults are less accurate than young adults. With the practice of goal-directed contractions, old adults can improve the accuracy of novel motor tasks (isometric or dynamic) though their strategy differs from the strategy used by young adults. For both age groups, the greatest improvements in accuracy occur at the beginning of practice.&lt;ref name="Christou 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Christou | first1 = EA. | last2 = Poston | first2 = B. | last3 = Enoka | first3 = JA. | last4 = Enoka | first4 = RM. | title = Different neural adjustments improve endpoint accuracy with practice in young and old adults. | journal = J Neurophysiol | volume = 97 | issue = 5 | pages = 3340–50 |date=May 2007 | doi = 10.1152/jn.01138.2006 | PMID = 17376846 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Old adults are able to improve the modulation of grasping forces after motor practice. Unexpectedly, motor practice fails to reduce grasping performance losses under the dual-task conditions but motor practice reduces the decline in cognitive performance under dual-task conditions. Therefore, motor practice seems to free up cognitive resources that were previously monitoring motor performance and old adults seemed to use these resources to improve their cognitive performance under dual-task conditions.&lt;ref name="Voelcker-Rehage 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Voelcker-Rehage | first1 = C. | last2 = Alberts | first2 = JL. | title = Effect of motor practice on dual-task performance in older adults. | journal = J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci | volume = 62 | issue = 3 | pages = P141-8 |date=May 2007 | url = http://psychsocgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/content/62/3/P141.abstract | PMID = 17507581 | doi=10.1093/geronb/62.3.p141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfonso López Michelsen''' (30 June 1913 – 11 July 2007) was the [[List of Presidents of Colombia|24th]] [[President of Colombia]] from 1974 to 1978. He was nicknamed "El Pollo" (The Chicken), a popular Colombian idiom for people with precocious careers.

==Early years==

López was the son of former two-time [[president of Colombia]], [[Alfonso López Pumarejo]]. He was born and raised in [[Bogotá]]. He studied at the [[Gimnasio Moderno|''Gimnasio Moderno'' School]] and later in other cities: [[Paris]], [[Brussels]], [[London]] and [[Santiago de Chile]]. He graduated with a degree in [[law]] from the [[Universidad del Rosario]].

During his father's presidency, López maintained a low profile in politics and instead focused on becoming a university professor at the ''Universidad del Rosario''.&lt;ref name="elespectador"&gt;http://www.elespectador.com/elespectador/Secciones/Detalles.aspx?idNoticia=12208&amp;idSeccion=21&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, López married Cecilia Caballero Blanco in Bogotá. They moved to the outskirts of [[Bogotá]] in a ''[[hacienda]]'' in the then [[municipalities of Colombia|municipality]] of [[Engativá]], [[Cundinamarca Department]] (nowadays a [[Bogotá, Capital District|Locality of Bogotá]]). Settled in this town, López had his first experience with politics becoming a town councilman. During this time, his fellow councilmen included two other politicians who went to become key political players in the country, [[Álvaro Gómez Hurtado]] and future president [[Julio César Turbay Ayala]].

==Political career==

In 1959, a group of his former college students founded the [[Liberal Revolutionary Movement]] (MRL) as a reaction against the pact between the [[Colombian Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] and the [[Colombian Conservative Party|Conservative Party]] to create the [[National Front (Colombia)|National Front]], in which the two parties took turns to govern. López Michelsen was then offered the leadership of the newly created MRL and he accepted, becoming a presidential candidate for the 1962 presidential elections. López lost the election by a large margin to Conservative candidate [[Guillermo León Valencia]].

===Governor of the Department of Cesar (1967–1968)===

In 1966, López was elected as a [[Senate of Colombia|senator]] and negotiated the return of the MRL to the Liberal Party in 1967. This same year López traveled to the city of [[Valledupar]] after being appointed by President [[Carlos Lleras Restrepo]] as the first [[governor of Cesar Department|governor]] of [[Cesar Department]], a newly created province in the northern [[Caribbean Region]] of Colombia. López was able to trace his grandmothers' family ancestors "the Pumarejos," back to this town. During those years, he was also instrumental for the creation of the [[Vallenato Legend Festival]] (nowadays, one of the most important cultural events in Colombia) along with [[vallenato]] composer [[Rafael Escalona]] and journalist [[Consuelo Araújo]]. He served as governor of Cesar from December 21, 1967, until August 14, 1968.

===Minister of Foreign Affairs===

A year later, he was appointed [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Colombia)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] until the end of the presidential term of President Carlos Lleras Restrepo in 1970.

===Presidency (1974–1978)===

In 1974, López was chosen by the Liberal Party as their candidate for president, after defeating former president Carlos Lleras Restrepo in the party presidential primaries, with the support of former candidate (and presidential successor) [[Julio César Turbay]]. He won the general election by a large margin against the Conservative Party candidate [[Álvaro Gómez Hurtado]], and the [[ANAPO]] candidate, [[María Eugenia Rojas Correa|María Eugenia Rojas]]. His 2,929,719 votes were the highest ever for any president until that time.

His inaugural presidential speech, delivered on August 7, 1974, is mostly remembered for calling the disputed border area in the [[Gulf of Venezuela]] by its native indigenous name, "Gulf of Coquibacoa" given by the [[wayuu]]s. In his speech he also promised to reduce the growing gap between farmer and urban populations and to fight poverty, messages that attracted the support of many left-wing political movements. 

As a president, López declared economic emergency in order to correct the fiscal deficit, which allowed him to implement a number of regulatory measures to control spending, and to reduce subsidies and programs like the tax credit certificate (CAT) which reimbursed partial or total taxes for exporting companies. He also introduced a tax and fiscal reform which increased national saving, and allowed an increase in public investment and exports. Crop production increased 16%, and he also created public offices devoted to the improvement of farming. Under his government, also, power grids were expanded, and infrastructure investment increased. In contrast, inflation reached under his government its highest historical values, at around 32%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://enciclopedia.banrepcultural.org/index.php/Alfonso_L%C3%B3pez_Michelsen|title=Alfonso López Michelsen - Enciclopedia {{!}} Banrepcultural|website=enciclopedia.banrepcultural.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early support for his policies soon turned to fierce opposition, as many of his campaign promises, in particular those to make deals with unions and in the improvement of potable water access, went unfulfilled, and as subsidies were eliminated and inflation rose. Unions and other leftist activists had been accumulating frustration and resentment for decades after the killing of [[Jorge Eliécer Gaitán]], and the subsequent violence, and the hope for a more open society that came with Lopez election turned into feelings of betrayal. As a result, and after three years as president the major Colombian Unions got together and managed to propose and organize a massive, general strike. The López administration took a hard approach towards the planned strike, calling it subversive and at some point threatening arrest and forbidding public meetings.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pacifista.co/asi-fue-el-paro-de-1977-el-mas-grande-y-violento-de-la-historia-de-colombia/|title=Así fue el paro de 1977, el más grande (y violento) de la historia de Colombia|work=Pacifista|access-date=2018-06-14|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; This only enraged the participants, and the major unionists were joined by teachers, students, independent workers, housewives, guerrilla leaders, and even members of the opposition conservative party. The organizing committee demanded among other things salary increases, frozen prices for essential goods and public services fees, reestablishment of the right to meet and strike, and a reduction in work hours. 

The strike, occurring on September 14, 1977, came to be known as the National Civil Strike, and it attracted such a large number of discontented participants that the organizing committee soon lost control over it. Major roads were blocked all over Bogota, and in many other cities around the country, and very soon many small skirmishes between protesters and riot police started occurring all over. The manifestations and skirmishes soon turned into riots, and protesters started pillaging on big stores and vandalizing factories and cars. By 4 pm the major declared curfew which only made protesters more enraged. Hundreds of protesters were wounded, and thousands were arrested and assembled in the city's [[Estadio El Campín|Soccer stadium]] and bullfighting arena. Riots and skirmishes continued all night and well into the next day, which devastated the city. About 20 or 30 people died in the middle of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cinep.org.co/publicaciones/PDFS/20170902d.40_paro_civico91.pdf|title=40 años del Paro Cívico Nacional de 1977|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a consequence, unions declared victory and the López Michelsen's government had to make concessions. Alternatively, the riot made his government to adopt a harshest, more repressive stance.

===Post presidency===

Upon the end of his term in 1978, he again became the leader of Liberal Party. He ran for president again in 1982, but was defeated by the Conservative Party candidate, [[Belisario Betancur]].

He continued to actively participate in the decision making of the Liberal Party until the early 1990s when he decided to withdraw from political activity. He was a regular columnist for the Colombian newspaper ''[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]'' which drew attention to many critical issues. For this reason he was called "''el hombre que pone a pensar al pais''" (Spanish for "The man who made the country think").&lt;ref name="elespectador"/&gt;

Lopez Michelsen died in Bogotá on July 11, 2007 after suffering a [[heart attack]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070714102837/http://www.eltiempo.com/politica/2007-07-11/ARTICULO-WEB-NOTA_INTERIOR-3633513.html "Alfonso López Michelsen 1913-2007", ''El Tiempo'', 14 July 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antonio Claudio Álvarez de Quiñones''' (1670s – 21 October 1736) was a Spanish-born [[prelate]] of the [[Roman Catholic church|Roman Catholic Church]] in what is now the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Colombia]].

Born in [[Alcalá de Henares]], he taught law before becoming vicar general of the [[Diocese of Sigüenza]]. He was appointed [[Archbishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] in 1717, serving until 1725, when he was appointed Archbishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bogotá|Santafé en Nueva Granada]] (now the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bogotá|Archdiocese of Bogotá]]). Due to illness, he was unable to take control of the archdiocese until 1731, and he served as archbishop after that until his death in 1736.

=== Early life and education ===
Álvarez de Quiñones was born in [[Alcalá de Henares]], Spain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Casado Arboniés|first=Manuel|year=1998|title=Dos arzobispados americanos para el estudiante de Alcalá Don Antonio Claudio Álvarez de Quiñones|url=http://dspace.uah.es/dspace/bitstream/handle/10017/6170/Dos%20Arzobispados%20Americanos%20para%20el%20Estudiante%20de%20Alcal%C3%A1%20Don%20Antonio%20Claudio%20%C3%81lvarez%20de%20Qui%C3%B1ones%201712-1736.pdf?sequence=1|journal=Estudios de historia social y económica de América|volume=|pages=268–283|issn=0214-2236|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/balqu.html|title=Archbishop Antonio Claudio Alvarez de Quiñones [Catholic-Hierarchy]|last=Cheney|first=David M.|website=www.catholic-hierarchy.org|access-date=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His exact date of birth is disputed, with different sources placing the year at 1666, 1674,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 1676,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=|title=Familias Hispanoamericanas|url=http://bagn.academiahistoria.org.do/boletines/boletin99-100/BAGN_1959_No_99-100-04.pdf|journal=Boletin del Archivo General de la Nacion|volume=|pages=44–56|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1687.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/zdom0.htm|title=Archdiocese of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic|newspaper=GCatholic|access-date=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Quiñones' Licentiate of Canon Law certificate is dated at 1700, and because most people at that time would have received that degree at age 26, 1674 is perhaps the closest estimate to his actual birth year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Álvarez de Quiñones was the son of Antonio Quiñones and Catalina García.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His father's ancestors came from Quintanilla, in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of León in Spain|Diocese of León]], and his paternal grandparents came from the villages of [[Santorcaz]] and [[Hontanar]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His mother's ancestors were "old Christians," without any [[Spanish Jews|Jewish]] or [[Moors|Moorish]] ancestry, and none were "punished by the [[Spanish Inquisition|Holy Inquisition]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Álvarez de Quiñones attended the [[Colegio Mayor de San Ildefonso]] in Alcalá de Henares, graduating on 5 June 1674 with a [[bachelor's degree]] and a [[Licentiate of Canon Law]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Priesthood ===
Following graduation, he obtained a chair of law at the college.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He remained there teaching for several years, when he was invited by his uncle [[Francisco Álvarez de Quiñones]], the [[Canon (priest)|canon priest]] of the [[Collegiate of Santa María del Mercado]] in [[Berlanga de Duero]] and the future Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sigüenza-Guadalajara|Sigüenza]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; invited him to come work with him. Álvarez de Quiñones accepted the offer, and became the [[Vicar general|Vicar General]] of the [[Diocese of Sigüenza]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8euHzFu4I0QC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=Antonio+Claudio+Alvarez+de+Qui%C3%B1ones&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IHPp9qvnQA&amp;sig=xOkhSq8y5TH6P_kOrFk_pYu8Kl0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwipw-fA3ZzSAhWExFQKHcgKCcAQ6AEISjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Antonio%20Claudio%20Alvarez%20de%20Qui%C3%B1ones&amp;f=false|title=Diccionario geográfico-historico de las Indias occidentales ó América|last=Alcedo|first=Antonio de|date=|publisher=Manuel Gonzalez|year=1789|isbn=|location=Madrid|pages=38|language=es|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archbishop of Santo Domingo ===
In September 1711, [[Francisco del Rincón]], the Archbishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]], transferred to administer the [[Archdiocese of Caracas]] in what is now Venezuela, leaving the archdiocese without an archbishop.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On 10 March 1712, by way of royal appointment, Álvarez de Quiñones was appointed [[diocesan administrator]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; arriving in November of that year.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Finally, on 12 April 1717, [[Pope Clement XI]] appointed him Archbishop of Santo Domingo.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He traveled to [[Havana]], Cuba, in April 1718,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; for his [[episcopal consecration]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which took place on 1 May 1718, with Bishop [[Jerónimo Nosti&amp;nbsp;de Valdés]], [[Basilian monks|OS Bas.]], the Bishop of&amp;nbsp;[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santiago de Cuba|Santiago de Cuba]], serving as [[consecrator]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, following his consecration, he was unable to immediately return to [[Santo Domingo]] because he was suffering from [[Herpes simplex|herpes]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As archbishop, one of Álvarez de Quiñones' notable policies was that of refusing to ordain . In 1723, he became outraged upon learning that his predecessor, Francisco del Rincón, had ordained [[pardo]]s ([[triracial]] descendants of [[Europeans]],&amp;nbsp;[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], and&amp;nbsp;[[West Africa]]ns).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yDEpBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=Antonio+Claudio+Alvarez+de+Qui%C3%B1ones&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IgLUKBPNmI&amp;sig=-cIAyBV2ij3USFlV-dXZqOTlVes&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwipw-fA3ZzSAhWExFQKHcgKCcAQ6AEIRzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Antonio%20Claudio%20Alvarez%20de%20Qui%C3%B1ones&amp;f=false|title=Purchasing Whiteness: Pardos, Mulattos, and the Quest for Social Mobility in the Spanish Indies|last=Twinam|first=Ann|date=2015-01-28|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=|isbn=9780804750936|location=Redwood City, California|pages=120|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He complained that some of the archdiocese's priests "have a good part of [[mulatto]]" and made the accusation that they had "hidden" that their "progenitors had been slaves, and descendants of blacks that were introduced into this island from [[Guinea (region)|Guinea]]."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He then ordered that in the future, all priests should have the proper "quality and qualifications."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Archbishop of Bogotá ===
On 28 June 1723, the Archbishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bogotá|Santafé en Nueva Granada]] (now the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bogotá|Archdiocese of Bogotá]]), Francisco del Rincón, died of illness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; On 29 January 1725, Álvarez de Quiñones was named his successor,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; with the appointment being communicated to him by Cardinal [[Francesco Acquaviva]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His successor as Archbishop of Santo Domingo was [[Francisco&amp;nbsp;Mendigaño Armendáriz]], one of Álvarez de Quiñones' former classmates at San Ildefonso who was previously the archdeacon of the [[Primatial Cathedral of Bogotá|Bogotá Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Álvarez de Quiñones was announced to be the next Archbishop of Santafé en Nueva Granada on 14 July 1724,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and was officially appointed Archbishop of Santafé en Nueva Granada on 29 January 1725 in a [[papal bull]] by [[Pope Benedict XIII]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, he did actually take reach the archdiocese until 1731, due to an extended illness and travels to Europe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He suffered again from herpes, and was seriously ill for over five months.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He wrote in an April 1724 letter that he could not make the trip to Bogotá because "it has been God who has served to cut me off with a grievous accident, of which I have been prostrate for five months in bed, in danger of losing my life."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He wrote that he would travel when the doctors allowed it.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He left Santo Domingo in September 1725.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Later, in July 1728, he traveled to [[Gibraltar]] on a pastoral visit, where he remained until early 1729.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Meanwhile, Francisco Menigaña Armendáriz, who had remained in Bogotá as the diocesan administrator, had fallen ill and died in September 1728, and was replaced as diocesan administrator by Nicolas de Barasorda y Larrazabal, and later by Francisco José Cabrera y Davales.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Álvarez de Quiñones finally arrived in Bogotá on 27 August 1731.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Throughout his tenure as archbishop, Álvarez de Quiñones received mixed reception from those within the diocese, and experienced opposition from some members of the clergy, who accused the archbishop of extravagant spending.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1732, several priests formally complained to [[Philip V of Spain|King Philip V of Spain]] "for the great excesses in relation to the excessive money he holds and other irregular things with the state."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, others praised Álvarez de Quiñones for his "regal magnificence" and the wealth he brought to the archdiocese, which allowed for the endowment of scholarships, increased funding for churches and shrines, and the renovation of the [[Primatial Cathedral of Bogotá|Bogotá Cathedral]], the purchase of a new [[Episcopal Palace|episcopal palace]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which was acquired in 1733.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.banrepcultural.org/museo-botero/la-casa|title=La Casa {{!}} banrepcultural.org|website=www.banrepcultural.org|language=es|access-date=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death ===
Álvarez de Quiñones died in Bogotá on 21 October 1736.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He left a large estate, including the episcopal palace and a number of black slaves, and his successor as archbishop, [[Juan de Galavís]], spent much of his short term as archbishop consolidating his [[Will and testament|will]], which had 226 pages with 452 individual sections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In his will, he left "generous donations" to a variety of institutions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In [[artificial intelligence]] and related fields, an '''argumentation framework''', or '''argumentation system''', is a way to deal with contentious information and draw conclusions from it.

In an abstract argumentation framework,&lt;ref&gt;See Dung (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; entry-level information is a set of abstract arguments that, for instance, represent data or a proposition. Conflicts between arguments are represented by a [[binary relation]] on the set of arguments. In concrete terms, you represent an argumentation framework with a [[directed graph]] such that the nodes are the arguments, and the arrows represent the attack relation.
There exist some extensions of the Dung's framework, like the logic-based argumentation frameworks&lt;ref&gt;See Besnard and Hunter (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; or the value-based argumentation frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;see Bench-Capon (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abstract argumentation frameworks ==

=== Formal framework ===
Abstract argumentation frameworks, also called argumentation frameworks ''à la Dung'', are defined formally as a pair:
* A set of abstract elements called ''arguments'', denoted &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;
* A binary relation on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, called ''attack relation'', denoted &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Argumentation Framework.svg|thumb|left|upright=1|The graph built from the system &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.]]
For instance, the argumentation system &lt;math&gt;S = \langle A, R \rangle&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A = \{ a, b, c, d\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R = \{(a,b), (b,c), (d,c) \}&lt;/math&gt; contains four arguments (&lt;math&gt;a, b, c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;) and three attacks (&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; attacks &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; attacks &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; attacks &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;).

Dung defines some notions :
* an argument &lt;math&gt;a \in A&lt;/math&gt; is acceptable with respect to &lt;math&gt;E \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; defends &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;\forall b \in A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(b,a) \in R, \exists c \in E&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(c,b) \in R&lt;/math&gt;,
* a set of arguments &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is conflict-free if there is no attack between its arguments, formally : &lt;math&gt;\forall a, b \in E, (a,b) \not\in R&lt;/math&gt;,
* a set of arguments &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is admissible if and only if it is conflict-free and all its arguments are acceptable with respect to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Different semantics of acceptance ===

==== Extensions ====
To decide if an argument can be accepted or not, or if several arguments can be accepted together, Dung defines several semantics of acceptance that allow, given an argumentation system, to compute sets of arguments, called ''extensions''. For instance, given &lt;math&gt;S = \langle A, R\rangle&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a complete extension of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; only if it is an admissible set and every acceptable argument with respect to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; belongs to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a preferred extension of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; only if it is a maximal element (with respect to the set-theoretical inclusion) among the admissible sets with respect to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a stable extension of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; only if it is a conflict-free set that attacks every argument that does not belong in &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; (formally, &lt;math&gt;\forall a \in A \backslash E, \exists b \in E&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(b,a) \in R&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the (unique) grounded extension of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; only if it is the smallest element (with respect to set inclusion) among the complete extensions of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.
There exists some inclusions between the sets of extensions built with these semantics :
* Every stable extension is preferred,
* Every preferred extension is complete,
* The grounded extension is complete,
* If the system is well-founded (there exists no infinite sequence &lt;math&gt;a_0,a_1,\dots,a_n,\dots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\forall i&gt;0, (a_{i+1},a_{i}) \in R&lt;/math&gt;), all these semantics coincide—only one extension is grounded, stable, preferred, and complete.

Some other semantics have been defined.&lt;ref&gt;For instance,
* ''Ideal'' : see Dung, Mancarella and Toni (2006)
* ''Eager'' : see Caminada (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

One introduce the notation &lt;math&gt;Ext_\sigma(S)&lt;/math&gt; to note the set of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-extensions of the system &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!--SME: what does that last sentence mean to say?--&gt;

In the case of the system &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; in the figure above, &lt;math&gt;Ext_\sigma(S) = \{\{a,d\}\}&lt;/math&gt; for every Dung's semantic—the system is well-founded. That explains why the semantics coincide, and the accepted arguments are: &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Labellings ====
Labellings are a more expressive way than extensions to express the acceptance of the arguments. Concretely, a labelling is a mapping that associates every argument with a label ''in'' (the argument is accepted), ''out'' (the argument is rejected), or ''undec'' (the argument is undefined—not accepted or refused).
One can also note a labelling as a set of pairs &lt;math&gt;(\mathit{argument}, \mathit{label})&lt;/math&gt;.

Such a mapping does not make sense without additional constraint. The notion of reinstatement labelling guarantees the sense of the mapping. &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is a reinstatement labelling on the system &lt;math&gt;S = \langle A, R \rangle&lt;/math&gt; if and only if :
* &lt;math&gt;\forall a \in A, L(a) = \mathit{in}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\forall b \in A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(b,a) \in R, L(b) = \mathit{out}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall a \in A, L(a) = \mathit{out}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\exists b \in A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(b,a) \in R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L(b) = \mathit{in}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall a \in A, L(a) = \mathit{undec}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;L(a) \neq \mathit{in}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L(a) \neq \mathit{out}&lt;/math&gt;

One can convert every extension into a reinstatement labelling: the arguments of the extension are ''in'', those attacked by an argument of the extension are ''out'', and the others are ''undec''. Conversely, one can build an extension from a reinstatement labelling just by keeping the arguments ''in''. Indeed, Caminada&lt;ref&gt;see Caminada (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; proved that the reinstatement labellings and the complete extensions can be mapped in a [[Bijection|bijective]] way. Moreover, the other Datung's semantics can be associated to some particular sets of reinstatement labellings.

Reinstatement labellings distinguish arguments not accepted because they are attacked by accepted arguments from undefined arguments—that is, those that are not defended cannot defend themselves. An argument is ''undec'' if it is attacked by at least another ''undec''. If it is attacked only  by arguments ''out'', it must be ''in'', and if it is attacked some argument ''in'', then it is ''out''.

The unique reinstatement labelling that corresponds to the system &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; above is &lt;math&gt;L = \{(a,\mathit{in}),(b,\mathit{out}),(c,\mathit{out}),(d,\mathit{in})\}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Inference from an argumentation system ===
In the general case when several extensions are computed for a given semantic &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, the agent that reasons from the system can use several mechanisms to infer information:&lt;ref&gt;see Touretzky et al.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Credulous inference'': the agent accepts an argument if it belongs to at least one of the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-extensions—in which case, the agent risks accepting some arguments that are not acceptable together (&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; attacks &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; each belongs to an extension)
* ''Skeptical inference'': the agent accepts an argument only if it belongs to every &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-extension. In this case, the agent risks deducing too little information (if the intersection of the extensions is empty or has a very small cardinal).

For these two methods to infer information, one can identify the set of accepted arguments, respectively &lt;math&gt;Cr_\sigma(S)&lt;/math&gt; the set of the arguments credulously accepted under the semantic &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Sc_\sigma(S)&lt;/math&gt; the set of arguments accepted skeptically under the semantic &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; (the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; can be missed if there is no possible ambiguity about the semantic).

Of course, when there is only one extension (for instance, when the system is well-founded), this problem is very simple: the agent accepts arguments of the unique extension and rejects others.

The same reasoning can be done with labellings that correspond to the chosen semantic : an argument can be accepted if it is ''in'' for each labelling and refused if it is ''out'' for each labelling, the others being in an undecided state (the status of the arguments can remind the epistemic states of a belief in the AGM framework for dynamic of beliefs&lt;ref&gt;see Gärdenfors (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Equivalence between argumentation frameworks ===
There exists several criteria of equivalence between argumentation frameworks. Most of those criteria concern the sets of extensions or the set of accepted arguments.
Formally, given a semantic &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; :
* &lt;math&gt;\mathit{EQ_1}&lt;/math&gt; : two argumentation frameworks are equivalent if they have the same set of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-extensions, that is &lt;math&gt;S_1 \equiv_1 S_2 \Leftrightarrow Ext_\sigma(S_1) = Ext_\sigma(S_2)&lt;/math&gt; ;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathit{EQ_2}&lt;/math&gt; : two argumentation frameworks are equivalent if they accept skeptically the same arguments, that is &lt;math&gt;S_1 \equiv_2 S_2 \Leftrightarrow Sc_\sigma(S_1) = Sc_\sigma(S_2)&lt;/math&gt; ;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathit{EQ_2}&lt;/math&gt; : two argumentation frameworks are equivalent if they accept credulously the same arguments, that is &lt;math&gt;S_1 \equiv_3 S_2 \Leftrightarrow Cr_\sigma(S_1) = Cr_\sigma(S_2)&lt;/math&gt;.

The strong equivalence&lt;ref&gt;see Oikarinen and Woltran (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; says that two systems &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent if and only if for all other system &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt;, the union of &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent (for a given criterion) with the union of &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;the union of two systems represents here the system built from the union of the sets of arguments and the union of the attack relations&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other kinds ==
The abstract framework of Dung has been instantiated to several particular cases.

=== Logic-based argumentation frameworks ===
In the case of logic-based argumentation frameworks, an argument is not an abstract entity, but a pair, where the first part is a minimal consistent set of formulae enough to prove the formula for the second part of the argument.
Formally, an argument is a pair &lt;math&gt;(\Phi,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; such that
* &lt;math&gt;\Phi \nvdash \bot&lt;/math&gt; 
* &lt;math&gt;\Phi \vdash \alpha&lt;/math&gt; 
* &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is a minimal set of &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is a set of formulae used by the agent to reason.

One calls &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; a consequence of &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; a support of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

In this case, the attack relation is not given in an explicit way, as a subset of the Cartesian product &lt;math&gt;A \times A&lt;/math&gt;, but as a property that indicates if an argument attacks another. For instance,
* Relation ''defeater'' : &lt;math&gt;(\Psi,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; attacks &lt;math&gt;(\Phi,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\beta \vdash \neg (\phi_1 \wedge \dots \wedge \phi_n)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\{\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n\} \subseteq \Phi&lt;/math&gt; 
* Relation ''undercut'' : &lt;math&gt;(\Psi,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; attacks &lt;math&gt;(\Phi,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\beta =\neg (\phi_1 \wedge \dots \wedge \phi_n)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\{\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n\} \subseteq \Phi&lt;/math&gt;
* Relation ''rebuttal'' : &lt;math&gt;(\Psi,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; attacks &lt;math&gt;(\Phi,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\beta \Leftrightarrow \neg \alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a tautology

Given a particular attack relation, one can build a graph and reason in a similar way to the abstract argumentation frameworks (use of semantics to build extension, skeptical or credulous inference), the difference is that the information inferred from a logic based argumentation framework is a set of formulae (the consequences of the accepted arguments).

=== Value-based argumentation frameworks ===
The value-based argumentation frameworks come from the idea that during an exchange of arguments, some can be ''stronger'' than others with respect to a certain value they advance, and so the success of an attack between arguments depends of the difference of these values.

Formally, a value-based argumentation framework is a tuple &lt;math&gt;VAF = \langle A, R, V, \textit{val}, \textit{valprefs} \rangle &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; similar to the standard framework (a set of arguments and a binary relation on this set), &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a non empty set of values, &lt;math&gt;\textit{val}&lt;/math&gt; is a mapping that associates each element from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to an element from &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\textit{valprefs}&lt;/math&gt; is a preference relation (transitive, irreflexive and asymmetric) on &lt;math&gt;V \times V&lt;/math&gt;.

In this framework, an argument &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; defeats another argument &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; if and only if
* &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; attacks &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; in the "standard" meaning: &lt;math&gt;(a,b) \in R&lt;/math&gt; ;
* and &lt;math&gt;(\textit{val}(b),val(a)) \not\in \textit{valprefs}&lt;/math&gt;, that is the value advanced by &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is not preferred to the one advanced by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.
One remarks that an attack succeeds if both arguments are associated to the same value, or if there is no preference between their respective values.

=== Assumption-based argumentation frameworks ===
In assumption-based argumentation frameworks, arguments are defined as a set of rules and attacks are defined in terms of assumptions and contraries.

Formally, an assumption-based argumentation framework is a tuple &lt;math&gt;\langle \mathcal{L}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{A}, \overline{\textvisiblespace} \rangle&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-98197-0_10|title=Argumentation in Artificial Intelligence|last=Dung|first=Phan Minh|last2=Kowalski|first2=Robert A.|last3=Toni|first3=Francesca|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Springer US|isbn=9780387981963|editor-last=Simari|editor-first=Guillermo|pages=199–218|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-98197-0_10|editor-last2=Rahwan|editor-first2=Iyad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bondarenko|first=A.|last2=Dung|first2=P.

*  &lt;math&gt;\langle \mathcal{L}, \mathcal{R} \rangle&lt;/math&gt;  is a deductive system, where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is the language and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of inference rules in the form of &lt;math&gt;s_0\leftarrow s_1, \dotsc, s_m&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;m &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_0, s_1, \dotsc, s_m \in \mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;;

As a consequence of defining an ABA, an argument can be represented in a [[Tree (data structure)|tree-form]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Formally, given a deductive system &lt;math&gt;\langle \mathcal{L}, \mathcal{R} \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and set of assumptions &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;, an argument&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; for claim &lt;math display="inline"&gt;c\in{\mathcal{L}}&lt;/math&gt; supported by &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, is a tree with nodes labelled by sentences in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; or by symbol &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, such that:
* The root is labelled by &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;
* For each node &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;,
** If &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is a [[leaf node]], then &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is labelled by either an assumption or by &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;
** If &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is not a leaf node, then there is an inference rule &lt;math&gt;l_N\leftarrow s_1, ... , s_m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(m \geq 0)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;l_N&lt;/math&gt;is the label of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; and
*** If &lt;math&gt;m = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the rule shall be &lt;math&gt;l_N\leftarrow \tau&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. child of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;)
*** Otherwise, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; children, labelled by &lt;math&gt;s_1, ... , s_m&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all assumptions labeling the leave nodes
An argument&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; with claim &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; supported by a set of assumption &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; can also be denoted as &lt;math&gt;S\vdash c &lt;/math&gt;

'''Beneharo''' was a [[Guanches|Guanche]] king of [[Menceyato de Anaga]] on the island of [[Tenerife]].

Beneharo made peace in 1492 with [[Lope de Salazar]], who had been sent by the governor of [[Gran Canaria]] [[Francisco Maldonado]]. After a slave rape shortly after against the Guanches of Anaga, the mencey withdrew its support to the [[Europeans]] although after the landing of [[Alonso Fernández de Lugo]] renewed the peace with the [[Castilians]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdc.ulpgc.es/cdm/singleitem/collection/MDC/id/44128/rec/1 La Conquista de Tenerife (1494-1496)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A bronze statue of Beneharo is located in [[Candelaria, Tenerife|Candelaria]] with the other menceyes Guanches of Tenerife.

Captain '''Benjamin Hornigold''' (1680–1719) was an 18th-century [[English people|English]] [[pirate]] who operated during the tail end of the [[Golden Age of Piracy]]. His career lasted from 1715 until 1718, after which he became a pirate hunter and pursued his former allies on behalf of the Governor of the [[Bahamas]]. He was killed when his ship was wrecked on a reef during the hurricane season of 1719.

== Early career ==
Hornigold's early life is unrecorded, although he is sometimes claimed to have been born in the English county of [[Norfolk]], where the surname Hornigold or Hornagold appears. If so, he might have first served at sea aboard ships whose home port was either [[King's Lynn]] or [[Great Yarmouth]].{{sfn|Konstam|2006|p=62}} His first documented acts of piracy took place in the winter of 1713–1714, when he employed [[periagua]]s (sailing canoes) and the sloop ''Happy Return'' alongside [[Daniel Stillwell]], [[John Cockram]], and [[John West (pirate)|John West]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fictum|first1=David|title=“The Strongest Man Carries the Day,” Life in New Providence, 1716-1717|url=https://csphistorical.com/2015/07/26/the-strongest-man-carries-the-day-life-in-new-providence-1716-1717/|website=Colonies, Ships, and Pirates|accessdate=4 August 2017|date=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to menace merchant vessels off the coast of [[New Providence]] and its capital [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], where he had established a 'Privateers' or '[[Pirates' republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1717, Hornigold had at his command a thirty-gun sloop he named the ''Ranger'', which was probably the most heavily armed ship in the region, and this allowed him to seize other vessels with impunity.{{sfn|Konstam|2006|p=63}}

Hornigold's second-in-command during this period was Edward Teach, who would later be better known as the pirate [[Blackbeard]].{{sfn|Konstam|2006|p=63}} When Hornigold took command of the ''Ranger'', he delegated the captaincy of his earlier sloop to Teach. In the spring of 1717 the two pirate captains seized three merchant ships in quick succession, one carrying 120 barrels of flour bound for Havana, another a Bermudian sloop with a cargo of spirits and the third a Portuguese ship travelling from [[Madeira]] with a cargo of white wine.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Captain Mathew Musson to the [[Board of Trade|Council of Trade and Plantations]], July 5, 1717&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Konstam|2006|p=64}}

In March 1717, Hornigold attacked an armed merchant vessel sent to the Bahamas by the Governor of South Carolina to hunt for pirates. The merchantman escaped by running itself aground on [[Cat Cay]], and its captain later reported that Hornigold's fleet had increased to five vessels, with a combined crew of around 350 pirates.{{sfn|Konstam|2006|p=64}} In April 1717 Hornigold is recorded as operating alongside [[Captain Napin]] (or Napping), looting several ships off [[Jamaica]], [[Puerto Bello]], and [[Cuba]] before being chased away by the warship ''HMS Winchelsea''. Hornigold had earlier forced aboard a surgeon named John Howell but released him on Nassau; when French pirate [[Jean Bonadvis]] tried to force Howell aboard his ship later in April 1717, Hornigold accepted Howell back aboard to protect him.&lt;ref name="Republic of Pirates"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodard|first1=Colin|title=The Republic of Pirates: Being the True and Surprising Story of the Caribbean Pirates and the Man Who Brought Them Down|date=2008|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|location=Orlando FL|isbn=0547415753|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W5sIuoBrFwYC&amp;printsec=frontcover|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After parting ways with Napin in June or July they sailed together sporadically until October 1717.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fictum|first1=David|title=The Firsts of Blackbeard: Exploring Edward Thatch's Early Days as a Pirate|url=https://csphistorical.com/2015/10/18/the-firsts-of-blackbeard-exploring-edward-thatchs-early-days-as-a-pirate/|website=Colonies, Ships, and Pirates|accessdate=17 July 2017|date=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hornigold is recorded as having attacked a sloop off the coast of Honduras, but as one of the passengers of the captured vessel recounted, "they did us no further injury than the taking most of our hats from us, having got drunk the night before, as they told us, and toss'd theirs overboard".{{sfn|Earle|2003|p=179}}

==Overthrow and pardon==
Despite his apparent maritime supremacy, Hornigold remained careful not to attack British-flagged ships, apparently to maintain the legal defence that he was a privateer operating against England's enemies in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].{{sfn|Konstam|2006|p=66}} This scrupulous approach was not to the liking of his lieutenants, and in November 1717 a vote was taken among the combined crews to attack any vessel they chose. Hornigold opposed the decision and was replaced as captain by [[Samuel Bellamy]], whose friend [[Paulsgrave Williams]] was elected quartermaster.{{sfn|Konstam|2006|p=67}} At the time, Edward Teach was commanding Hornigold's second ship, and he probably did not learn of the mutiny until the two ships met later in the year. It was most likely that at this time the two pirates went their separate ways, with Teach setting sail for the Caribbean once again, leaving Hornigold to limp back to New Providence in command of a single sloop and a small crew. He continued piracy operations from Nassau until December 1717, when word arrived of a general pardon for pirates offered by the King. Hornigold sailed to Jamaica in January 1718&lt;ref&gt;Note: the English had not yet accepted the Gregorian Calendar, so from their point of view, it was January 1717 with the new year of 1718 not starting until March – see British Calendar Act of 1751&lt;/ref&gt; and received a pardon from the governor there. He later became a pirate hunter for the new governor of the Bahamas, [[Woodes Rogers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==The King's Pardon of 1717 and 1718==
On 5 September 1717, King George I Issued the Proclamation of 1717 "For Suppressing Pirates in the West Indies". This document granted a pardon to all pirates who surrendered themselves to any colonial governor or governor under the domain of the British Empire safe passage and were guaranteed a "clean slate" of their record. However, word of this did not get out to the West Indies and so in December 1718 another proclamation, or more famously known as the King's Pardon of 1718, was issued for the same purpose. In both of these documents, not only were pirates granted a clean slate on their record, but they were also offered a large sum of money for the capturing of other pirates who were guilty of piracy, murder, and treason against His Majesty. More specifically, for every captain who was captured, the person responsible would receive £100, {{Inflation|UK|100|1718|fmt=eq|cursign=£|r=-3}}, and for every lieutenant and boatswain a reward of £40 (£{{Inflation|UK|40|1718|fmt=c|r=-2}}) was offered.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/royalproclamations12brigrich#page/176/mode/2up/search/176&lt;/ref&gt; Each level of member on a pirate ship had a reward placed on their heads from this point on.

==Pirate hunter and death==
Rogers granted Hornigold's request for a pardon, but he commissioned him to hunt down other pirates, including his former lieutenant, Teach ([[Blackbeard]]). Hornigold was to spend the next eighteen months cruising the Bahamas, hunting his former associates. He stalked but could not apprehend [[Charles Vane]], capturing Vane's associate [[Nicholas Woodall]] instead,&lt;ref name="A General History Vol 2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Charles|title=The history of the pyrates: containing the lives of Captain Mission.

In December 1718 Governor Rogers wrote to the [[Board of Trade]] in London commending Hornigold's efforts to remedy his reputation as a pirate by hunting his former allies.{{sfn|Konstam|2006|p=228}}

In late 1719, Hornigold's ship was caught in a hurricane somewhere between New Providence and New Spain, and was wrecked on an uncharted [[reef]]. The incident is referred to in the contemporary account ''[[A General History of the Pyrates]]'' by [[Captain Charles Johnson]], which states, "in one of which voyages ... Captain Hornigold, another of the famous pirates, was cast away upon rocks, a great way from land, and perished, but five of his men got into a canoe and were saved."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Johnson (1724), ''[http://digital.lib.ecu.edu/historyfiction/item.aspx?id=joh A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates]'', {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703062501/http://digital.lib.ecu.edu/historyfiction/item.aspx?id=joh|date=July 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Konstam|2006|p=231}} The specific location of the reef remains unknown.

'''Bilge Olgaç''' (10 January 1940 – 3 March 1994) was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] film director.

==Life==
Bilge Olgaç was born to a poor family in [[Vize]], [[ilçe]] (district)  of [[Kırklareli Province]] on 10 January 1940. While still in vocational school in [[İstanbul]], she married to Vecdi Bender in 1956. She had a son by this marriage. They divorced.&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;[http://www.biyografi.info/kisi/bilge-olgac Biography page {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, she had moved to a new house in [[Beyoğlu]], İstanbul. She died during a fire in this house on 3 March 1994.&lt;ref name=Cl &gt;[http://bianet.org/bianet/kultur/70286-kameranin-ardindaki-kadin-bilge-olgac Bianet Culture buelletin {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
She was writing short stories. Her husband, who was a former film industry employee, introduced her to [[Memduh Ün]], a film producer and a director. In 1962, Memduh Ün made a film out of one of her stories ''Kısmetin En Güzeli'' ("Best of the Fortune").&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0279179/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast IMDB page]&lt;/ref&gt; She also began working as an assistant of Memduh Ün. In 1965, she directed her first film ''Üçünüze de Mıhlarım'' ("I Shall Shoot Three of You"). She was the sole female film director at that time. She also wrote the script of many of her films.  In 1970, she directed ''Linç'' ("Lynch"), which  earned her fame and many awards. Between 1975–1984, she directed commercial films. In 1984, she returned to movie films by her new film ''Kaşık Düşmanı'' ("Ball and Chain"). In the same year, she also made ''Yavrularım'' ("My Little Ones"), which was a big success. Her later films are on women's issues in rural areas. Although she mostly made movie films in 1987, she also directed a television serial ''Elif Ana-Ayşe Kız'' ("Mommy Elif – Maid Ayşe").&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; When she died she was about to finish her last film ''Bir Yanımız Bahar Bahçe'' ("Spring Garden on One Side") &lt;ref name=Cl/&gt; The number of films directed by Bilge Olgaç is 37.

A '''blastospore''' is an [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] [[fungal]] [[spore]] produced by [[budding]]. Produced by fungi within the phylum [[Glomeromycota]] and others. It is also known as a [[blastoconidium]] (plural = blastoconidia.)

An example of a fungus that forms blastospores is ''[[Candida albicans]]''.

Brahim attended the [[University of Ottawa]] in [[Canada]] as a foreign exchange student and graduated in 2004 with a degree in [[business administration]].{{Fact|date=May 2008}} It is claimed that in 2005, President Déby held a secret meeting in which he expressed his desire to have Brahim succeed him at some point; this reportedly caused a rift in the family.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Wax, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/01/AR2006050101503.html?nav=rss_world "New First Lady Captivates Chad"], ''The Washington Post'', May 2, 2006, page A17.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24  May, 2006, Brahim Déby was arrested outside a [[Paris]] nightclub after getting involved in a brawl. During the fight, an unlicensed [[semi-automatic pistol]] fell from his pocket. Police later searched his house and found 375 grams of [[marijuana]]. On 3 June, 2006, Brahim Déby was given a six-month suspended sentence for drugs and arms possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Tocqueville Connection|title=Chadian President's Son Gets Suspended Sentence For Drugs and Arms Possession|date=2006-06-03|url=http://ttc.org/200606031947.k53jll125367.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Déby was found dead by a security guard in his apartment building's parking garage in [[Courbevoie]], a suburb of Paris, on July 2, 2007.&lt;ref name=Autopsy/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6261408.stm "Chad leader's son killed in Paris"] BBC News, 2 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the apparently violent nature of his death, French authorities began investigating it as murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/07/02/africa/chad.php "Son of Chad's leader found dead in Paris"], Associated Press (''International Herald Tribune''), July 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; An [[autopsy]] indicated that Déby, who was covered in white powder, died due to [[asphyxiation]], probably from the powder, which was thought to have been sprayed from a [[fire extinguisher]] found near his body. Déby had a wound on his head, but this was thought to be unrelated to his death.&lt;ref name=Autopsy/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

According to a lawyer for Déby's family on July 17, Déby was attacked ten days after arriving in [[France]] from Chad; his father had advised him not to return to France due to his past legal issue there. Shortly prior to the attack, Déby was said to be very worried and had received a telephone call. He was attacked by four or five men disguised as policemen who waited for him to arrive at the parking garage. The attackers [[taser]]ed Déby before killing him by spraying him with the fire extinguisher powder. They then searched his apartment for an unknown reason; it was speculated that the attackers might have been looking for money kept there by Déby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeuneafrique.com/jeune_afrique/article_depeche.asp?art_cle=PAN70027unavoecnarf0 "Un avocat déroule le film du meurtre de Brahim Déby en France"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821104416/http://www.jeuneafrique.com/jeune_afrique/article_depeche.asp?art_cle=PAN70027unavoecnarf0 |date=August 21, 2007 }}, Panapress (''[[Jeune Afrique|Jeuneafrique.com]]''), July 18, 2007 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Déby's body was returned to Chad aboard a specially chartered flight on the morning of 4 July. He was buried at midday on the same day in the [[Muslim]] cemetery in [[Lamadji]], to the north of [[N'Djamena]]. The funeral was held privately but was nevertheless widely attended, with Déby's extended family, as well as government ministers and various political figures, present.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/091/article_53662.asp "Inhumation de Brahim Deby"], rfi.fr, July 4, 2007 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Five arrests (four in Paris, one in [[Romania]]) made in connection with Déby's death were reported on November 28, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=136&amp;art_id=nw20081128135045502C949232 "Breakthrough in Chad president's son murder"], AFP, November 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Four men were convicted of crimes related to his killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-14070102|title=Jail terms over death of Chad leader's son Brahim Deby|publisher=BBC News|date=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early Buddhist thinkers emphasised the unitary nature of the mind. The ''[[Sarvastivada|Sarvastivadins]]'' in order to explain the unity of the mind described the mind as a ground or base which they called '''Cittabhumi'''. They rejected the realm of unconsciousness, ''alaya-vijnana'', postulated by the ''[[Yogacara|Yogacarins]]'' of [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhism]] who believed that from the realm of unconsciousness arose the conscious mind and the objects. But the ''Sarvastivadins'' recognised five types of ''Cittabhumi'' from which psychological phenomenon arose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Early Buddhism|author=Akira Hirakawa|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=163|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XjjwjC7rcOYC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=cittabhumi#v=onepage&amp;q=cittabhumi&amp;f=false|isbn=9788120809550|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Citta]] i.e. the mind, that alongside [[Manas (early Buddhism)|Manas]], [[Buddhi]] and [[Ahamkara]] is an internal organ, whose function is recollection, constituted by three [[Gunas]] viz [[Sattva]], [[Rajas]] and [[Tamas (philosophy)|Tamas]], reflects the self in accordance with any one of its modified states, ''[[vritti]]'', which are ''[[Pramāṇa]]'' with its three kinds of cognition – perception, inference and verbal testimony, ''[[Vikalpa]]'' which is mere verbal idea caused by meaningless words, ''[[Viparyaya]]'' which is knowledge of things as they are not, ''Nidra'' or dreamless sleep and ''[[Smrti]]'' or memory. These reflections result in the self being afflicted by ''Klesas'' – [[Avidya (Hinduism)|Avidya]] (wrong or false knowledge), ''Asmita'' (false notion or perception), ''[[Raga (Buddhism)|Raga]]'' (attachment), ''Dvea'' (aversion), and ''Abhnivesha'' (fear of death). Thus, the mind may remain in five different levels which mental levels or functions or stages, five in number, are known as Cittabhumi &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Companion Encyclopaedia of Hindu philosophy|author=Subodh Kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing (P) Ltd.|page=35|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JZWdEymxyp4C&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=cittabhumi#v=onepage&amp;q=cittabhumi&amp;f=false|isbn=9788177552034|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Systems of Indian Philosophy|publisher=Genesis Publishing (P) Ltd.|page=593|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8oEpPOKtrbkC&amp;pg=PA593&amp;dq=cittabhumi#v=onepage&amp;q=cittabhumi&amp;f=false|isbn=9788177558876}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bhagavada Gita and Jivana Yoga|author=R.N.Vyas|publisher=Abhinav Publications|page=11|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4GHl4X1wKpAC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=cittabhumi#v=onepage&amp;q=cittabhumi&amp;f=false|isbn=9788170172031|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; These five stages of the mind, as defined by Vyasa, are:-

:• ''Ksipta'' or distracted. The distracted mind being overpowered by ''Rajas'' is extremely unsteady unable to concentrate or decide, and is the source of pleasure or pain.
:• ''Mudha'' or infatuated. The infatuated mind being overpowered by ''Tamas'' succumbs to commit unrighteous acts influenced by violent emotions.
:• ''Viksipta'' or occasionally steady. The occasionally steady mind, unsteady for most part, influenced by ''Sattva'' is able to withdraw itself from painful objects and become fixed on pleasurable objects.
:• ''Ekagra'' or one-pointed. The one-pointed mind influenced by pure ''Sattva'' is able to withdraw from all objects i.e. totally introverted, to remain focussed on one object.
:• ''Niruddha'' or restrained. The restrained mind also influenced by pure ''Sattva'' arrests all mental functions i.e. there is complete suspension of all mental modes and sub-conscious dispositions.

The first three afore-mentioned stages of mind are unfit for concentration for they are attended by mental modes. [[Yoga]] is not possible in these conditions. Ordinary people live on the level of ''Ksipta'' or ''Mudha''. 

The last two mentioned stages are conducive to yoga and for [[Samadhi]]. ''Ekagra'' stage is also called ''Sampramata yoga'' in which the mind assumes the form of the object itself. ''Niruddha'' stage is known as ''Samprajnata yoga'' or ''[[Samadhi]]'' in which nothing is known or thought of by the mind. In the Yoga system ''Buddhi'' ([[intellect]]), ''Ahamkara'' ([[Ego (religion)|ego]]) and ''Indriyas'' ([[senses]]) are often called ''Citta''.

A '''composite variety''' is a [[plant]] population in which at least 70% of its [[Progeny (genetic descendant)|progeny]] result from the [[cross breeding|crossing]] of the parent lines.

A composite variety is a variety developed by mixing the seeds of various phenotypically outstanding lines possessing similarities for various characteristics like height, seed size, seed color, maturity etc. Crossing among the selected varieties is possible because the species used are open pollinated.  Consequently composite varieties are genetically heterogeneous, and an exact reconstitution of the composite variety is not possible.  

Farmers can use their own saved seed for 3 to 4 years, after that seed should be replaced as the initial performance of the composite cross variety will have drifted from the original type.

Amphora depicting the abduction of Iphigenia by Artemis
]]
[[Iphigenia]] was the daughter of [[Agamemnon]] and [[Clytemnestra]].  According to the story, Agamemnon committed a mistake and had to sacrifice Iphigenia to Artemis to appease her.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ancient-literature.com/greece_euripides_iphigenia_aulis.html|title=Ancient Literature|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are different versions of the story. According to one side of the story, before Agamemnon could sacrifice her, Artemis saved her and replaced her with a deer on the altar. In the other version, Agamemnon actually went through with the sacrifice. The different versions aid in the different depictions of Iphigenia.

The death of Iphigenia is immortalized on many different mediums. Vases are a common base for the story, but there are mosaics, paintings, and written works from every era illustrating the myth of Iphigenia. The most common scene depicted in the different visual media of Iphigenia is when she about to be offered up to Artemis on the altar.

== Descriptions of the death by Pausanias  ==
[[Pausanias (geographer)|Paisanias]] was a traveler who wrote the ''Description of Greece'' which depicted his accounts of what he has seen on mainland Greece.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ancient-literature.com/greece_euripides_iphigenia_aulis.html|title=Iphigenia at Aulis - Euripides - Ancient Greece - Classical Literature|website=www.ancient-literature.com|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recorded a few depictions of the death of Iphigenia. He mentions that the temple of Artemis was where the sacrifice was to take place. He goes on to describe the temple of Artemis after its destruction.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pausanias's Description of Greece, Volume 5|last=|author=Pausanias|publisher=Macmillan and Company|year=1913|isbn=|location=University of Michigan|pages=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pausanias then gives an example of an artistic depiction of Iphigenia that was found in Catalonia. In the mosaic, Iphigenia is being led to the altar and it is seen that Artemis is in the back waiting and holding a deer to replace Iphigenia with.

== Iphigenia in Art ==

=== Volute Krater of the Sacrifice&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=463408&amp;partId=1|title=volute krater|website=British Museum|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
[[File:Vase 2.jpg|thumb|
Volute Krater of Iphigenia's Sacrifice
|185x185px]]
There are several vases that were made and decorated with illustrations of the sacrifice of Iphigenia. The volute krater shown was made in Apulia around 370 BC-350 BC. It is in the red-figure technique. Here the sacrifice is about to take place, with the altar depicted in white. Agamemnon is also painted here with a knife in his hand, showing that he about to commit the sacrifice. Artemis and Apollo are also illustrated. Artemis is looking down upon Iphigenia and Apollo is seated on a rock to the left, looking back. Death is imminent because the offering is going to be made with an audience around.

=== Mosaic of Iphigenia ===
[[File:Mosaic Orestes Iphigenia Musei Capitolini MC4948.jpg|thumb|
A mosaic depicting Iphigenia 
|153x153px]]
Recently, a mosaic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.gr/2017/07/1800-year-old-mosaic-found-in-ancient.html#bSMLXjICdkTwhict.97|title=1,800 year old mosaic found in ancient Greek city of Perge|work=The Archaeology News Network|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; depicting Iphigenia was found in Perge, Turkey during an excavation by archeologists. It is said to be about 1,800 years old. The mosaic shows Iphigenia during the Trojan War. It was concluded that the site was a cult area founded in the basement of a shop that could have existed during the days of Ancient Greece. In this depiction, Iphigenia is replaced by a deer, harrowingly missing death.

=== ''[[Iphigenia in Aulis]]'' ===
''Iphigenia in Aulis'' is a play written by a Greek playwright [[Euripides]]. It revolves around Agamemnon's decision to sacrifice his daughter's life for Artemis. In this account of the story, Iphigenia actually dies. It is written through the eyes of Agamemnon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Euripides|last=McClure|first=Laura|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2016|isbn=9781119257516|location=Chichester, West Sussex|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0108:card=80&amp;highlight=iphigenia|title=Euripides, Iphigenia in Aulis|last=Coleridge|first=E.P.|date=1891|website=Perseus Tufts|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Death is a main theme in this play because of the Iphigenia's circumstance, but also because the Trojan war is on the cusp.

=== ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris]]'' ===
Iphigenia in Tauris is another play written by Euripides. In this telling of the tale, Iphigenia is not dead, and she meets with her brother. She is made a priestess in the temple of Artemis of the Taurians She recounts her story and tells how she arrived to the place by the hands of Artemis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0006.tlg013.perseus-eng1:1-41|title=Euripides, Iphigenia in Tauris|last=Potter|first=Robert|date=1938|website=Perseus Tufts|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iphigenia conducts rites as a priestess to Artemis. Although, Iphigenia has eluded death in this play, it is still a theme and effects the tone because of it was the beginning of a domino effect for the play.

'''The Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB)''' is a non-profit, global [[hybridoma]] bank.  The DSHB is a National Resource established by the [[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] (NICHD) to bank and distribute at cost hybridomas and cell products to the general scientific community.

==Mission==
The mission of the DSHB is four-fold:
:* Keep product prices low to facilitate research (Currently 35.00 USD per ml of supernatant)
:* Serve as a repository to relieve scientists of the time and expense of distributing hybridomas and the monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) they produce
:* Assure the scientific community that MAbs with limited demand remain available
:* Maintain the highest product quality, provide prompt customer service and knowledgeable technical assistance.

==Description==
The DSHB is directed by [[David R. Soll]] at the [[University of Iowa]]. There are currently over 3000 hybridomas in the DSHB collection.&lt;ref&gt;http://dshb.biology.uiowa.edu/Antibody-list&lt;/ref&gt; They have obtained hybridoma collections from a variety of individuals and institutions including the [[Muscular Dystrophy Association]], the [[National Cancer Institute]], the [[National Institutes of Health Common Fund|NIH Common Fund]], and the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] (EMBL) and they eagerly await new collections. The DSHB has begun developing complex monoclonal antibody microarrays for specific cancer targets.  First time customers must agree to the DSHB terms of usage that products will be used for research purposes only, and that they cannot be commercialized or distributed to a third party. Researchers also agree to acknowledge both the DSHB and the contributing investigator in publications that benefit from the use of DSHB products and provide the DSHB citations of all publications.  Individuals or institutions can deposit hybridomas for distribution and archiving at no cost, and there is no maximum or minimum deposit.  As the depositor, you have the option to allow the DSHB to distribute the hybridoma cells, or just the cell products.  All contributions to the DSHB do not preclude the depositor from licensing cell lines for commercial purposes.  The DSHB does not own any intellectual property on deposited antibodies.  The intellectual property remains that of the scientist or institution that banks the hybridomas.  As a non-profit organization, the DSHB covers the operating costs of maintaining, improving and producing products in the collection by selling the products at cost.

==History==
The DSHB was created in 1986 by the Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NIH) to bank and distribute hybridomas and the monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) they produce to the general scientific community in order to facilitate research.  The DSHB has been self-funded since 1996.  One of the first hybridomas deposited with the DSHB was MF 20 which recognizes all isoforms of skeletal myosin heavy chain.  In April 1986, Dr. Donald Fischman, [[Cornell Medical School]], deposited MF 20 with the DSHB.  Nearly 30 years later, MF 20 remains one of the top ten most requested monoclonal antibodies.

He led Philippine forces first against [[Spain]] in the latter part of the [[Philippine Revolution]] (1896–1898), and then in the [[Spanish–American War]] (1898), and finally against the [[United States]] during the [[Philippine–American War]] (1899–1901). He was captured in [[Palanan]], [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]] by American forces on March 23, 1901, which brought an end to his presidency. 

In 1935, Aguinaldo ran unsuccessfully for president of the [[Philippine Commonwealth]] against [[Manuel Quezon]].

==Early life and career==
{{anchor|earlylife}}

Emilio Famy Aguinaldo Sr. was born on March 22, 1869 {{efn|name=birthdate-note}} in Cavite el Viejo (present-day Kawit), in [[Cavite]] province, to Carlos Jamir Aguinaldo and Trinidad Famy-Aguinaldo,{{efn|name="name"}} a Tagalog [[sangley|Chinese mestizo]] couple who had eight children, the seventh of whom was Emilio Sr. The Aguinaldo family was quite well-to-do, as his father, Carlos J. Aguinaldo was the community's appointed [[gobernadorcillo]] (municipal governor) in the [[Kingdom of Spain|Spanish]] colonial administration and his grandparents Eugenio K. Aguinaldo and Maria Jamir-Aguinaldo. He studied at [[Colegio de San Juan de Letran]] but wasn't able to finish his studies due to outbreak of cholera in 1882.

Emilio became the "[[Cabeza de Barangay]]"
In 1895 the [[Maura Law]] that called for the reorganization of local governments was enacted. At the age of 25, Aguinaldo became Cavite el Viejo's first [[gobernadorcillo#Capitan municipal|"gobernadorcillo capitan municipal" (Municipal Governor-Captain)]] while on a business trip in [[Mindoro]].

===Philippine Revolution and battles===
{{Main|Philippine Revolution}}

On January 1, 1895, Aguinaldo became a [[Freemason]], joining Pilar Lodge No. 203, Imus, Cavite by the codename "Colon".  He would later say:
:"The Successful Revolution of 1896 was masonically inspired, led, and executed, and I venture to say that the first Philippine Republic of which I was its humble President, was an achievement we owe largely, to Masonry and the Masons."&lt;ref name=GrandLodgeOfThePhilippines&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 7, 1895, Santiago Alvarez whose father was a ''Capitan Municipal'' (Mayor) of [[Noveleta]] encouraged Aguinaldo to join the "[[Katipunan]]", a secret organization led by [[Andrés Bonifacio]], dedicated to the expulsion of the Spanish and independence of the Philippines through armed force.{{sfn|Kalaw|1926|p=77}} Aguinaldo joined the organization and used the [[nom de guerre]] [[Magdalo (Katipunan faction)|Magdalo]], in honor of [[Mary Magdalene]]. The local chapter of Katipunan in Cavite was established and named ''Sangguniang Magdalo'', and Aguinaldo's cousin [[Baldomero Aguinaldo]] was appointed leader.{{sfn|Agoncillo|1990|p=79}}&lt;ref name="guerrero" /&gt;

The Katipunan-led [[Philippine Revolution]] against the Spanish began in the last week of August 1896 in [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan del Monte]] (now part of [[Metro Manila]]).{{sfn|Agoncillo|1990|p=176}} However, Aguinaldo and other Cavite rebels initially refused to join in the offensive because of the lack of arms.&lt;ref name="guerrero" /&gt; While Bonifacio and other rebels were forced to resort to [[guerrilla warfare]], Aguinaldo and the Cavite rebels won major victories in carefully planned and well-timed set-piece battles, temporarily driving the Spanish out of their area.&lt;ref name="guerrero" /&gt;                       On August 31, 1896, Aguinaldo started the assault beginning as a skirmish to a full blown revolt ([[Kawit Revolt]]). He  marched with his army of bolomen to the town center of Kawit . Prior to the battle, Aguinaldo strictly ordered his men not to kill anyone in his hometown. Upon arriving at the town center, the guards armed with remingtons, unaware of events were caught completely by surprise and surrendered immediately. The guns there were captured and armed by the Katipuneros, the revolt was a major success for Aguinaldo and his men. Later that afternoon, they raised the [[Magdalo (Katipunan faction)|Magdalo]] flag at the town hall to a large crowd of people from Kawit all assembled after hearing of their city's liberation.

===Battle of Imus===
{{main|Battle of Imus}}
In August 1896, as coordinated attacks broke out and sparked the revolution beginning in Manila. Emilio Aguinaldo marched from Kawit with 600 men and launched a series of skirmishes at Imus which eventually ended in open hostilities against Spanish troops stationed there. On September 1, with the aid of Captain [[Jose Tagle]] of Imus, they laid siege against Imus Estate to draw the Spanish out. A Spanish relief column commanded by Brig. General Ernesto de Aguirre had been dispatched from Manila to aid the beleaguered Spanish defenders of Imus. Supported only by a hundred troops and by a cavalry, Aguirre gave the impression that he had been sent out to suppress a minor disturbance. Aguinaldo and his men counter-attacked but suffered heavy losses and almost cost his own life. Despite the success, Aguirre did not press the attack and felt the inadequacy of his troops and hastened back to Manila to get reinforcements. During the lull in the fighting, Aguinaldo's troops reorganized and prepared for another Spanish attack. On September 3, Aguirre came back with a much larger force of 3,000 men. When Spanish troops arrived at the [[Bridge of Isabel II|Isabel II bridge]], they were fired upon by the concealed rebels. As surprise was on the side of the revolutionaries, almost all the Spaniards that were sent there were trapped and annihilated, among them was Gen. Aguirre.

===Twin battles of Binakayan-Dalahican===
{{main| Battle of Binakayan-Dalahican}}
Alarmed by previous [[Battle of Imus|siege]], led by General Aguinaldo in [[Imus, Cavite]] in September 1896, Governor-General [[Ramón Blanco y Erenas]] ordered the 4th Battalion of Cazadores from [[Spain]] to aid him in quelling the rebellion in Cavite. On November 3, 1896, the battalion arrived carrying a squadron of 1,328 men and some 55 officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/annualreportofma03unit|title= Annual report of Major General George W. Davis, United States Army commanding Division of the Philippines from October 1, 1771 to July 26, 1903|work=U.S. War Department|year=1903|page=193|publisher=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from that, Blanco ordered about 8,000 men who recently came from [[Spanish Cuba|Cuba]] and Spain to joint in suppressing the rebellion. Prior to the land attacks, Spanish naval raids were conducted on the shores of [[Cavite]], where [[cannon]]balls were bombarded against the revolutionary fortifications in Bacoor, Noveleta, Binakayan and Cavite Viejo. The most fortified locations in Noveleta are the Dalahican and Dagatan shores defended by ''Magdiwang'' soldiers under the command of Gen. [[Santiago Alvarez (general)|Santiago Alvarez]], while the adjacent fishing village of Binakayan in Kawit was fortified by ''Magdalo'' under Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo. Spanish naval operations were determined to crush the fortifications in these areas, mainly because the lake around Dalahican was so strategic as it connects to the interior of Cavite. Apart from defending Binakayan, the ''Magdalo'' soldiers also kept the lower part of Dagatan up to Cavite's border near Morong province (now [[Rizal]] province).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alvarez|first=Santiago V.|others=Paula Carolina S. Malay (translator)|title=The Katipunan and the Revolution: Memoirs of a General|publisher=[[Ateneo de Manila University Press]]|year= 1992|isbn= 971-550-077-3|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=F3q-krDckHwC}} {{ISBN|978-971-550-077-7|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 9, 1896, Spanish forces laid simultaneous attacks on the two fortified rebel strongholds with many Spaniards losing their lives. At each advancement, more Spanish soldiers were killed, including the officers. Aguinaldo then ordered his soldiers to counterattack at the right moment with the most number of men available for the engagement, and so they did. Huge numbers of Katipuneros rushed into the fight, swarming into several enemy units until one by one, the Spaniards were destroyed piecemeal. When the surviving Spaniards saw that their officers were killed by the defense of Binakayan, they were demoralized with many retreating back to their ships while some of them headed back to Manila, thus, terminating the attack in Binakayan. The Filipinos were in hot pursuit over the enemy, killing stragglers in the process, and it resulted in an utter rout for the Spanish and scattered them apart. The attack on Filipino positions by the Spaniards at Dalahican completely failed, suffering more than 1,000 casualties in the process, and by nightfall on November 11, the battle was over. They tried to retreat back towards Manila at the end of the battle, but, now cut off from Manila due to Filipino victory at Binakayan, fell back instead to Cavite City. Alvarez's revolutionaries, including those commanded by Aguinaldo who quickly joined the fray after Binakayan as reinforcements, pursued the retreating Spanish and for a while besieged Cavite City, where many Spanish soldiers surrendered to Aguinaldo.

===Battle of Zapote Bridge===
{{main|Battle of Zapote Bridge (1897)}}
The newly appointed Governor-General [[Camilo de Polavieja]] now fully aware that the main weight of the revolution was in Cavite, decided to launch a two-pronged assault which would defeat the revolutionaries led by Aguinaldo. He ordered [[José de Lachambre|General José de Lachambre]] with a much bigger force to march against [[Silang, Cavite|Silang]] to take on the ''Katipuneros'' from the rear, while he himself will engage the Filipinos head on. On February 17, 1897, Aguinaldo ordered soldiers to plant dynamite along the bridge and place pointed bamboo sticks in the river beds below the bridge. Several hours later, 12,000 Spaniards began to cross the bridge. The trap was sprung and the dynamite was detonated, killing several Spanish troops and injuring many more. The rebels then emerged from the bushes and fought hand-to-hand, repelling consecutive waves of enemy troops charging across the river. During this fight [[Edilberto Evangelista]] was shot in the head and died. The province of Cavite gradually emerged as the Revolution's hotbed, and the Aguinaldo-led Katipuneros had a string of victories there. After the battle, the demoralized Spanish soldiers retreated towards Muntinlupa.

===Spanish Cavite offensive and the Battle of Perez Dasmariñas===
{{main|Battle of Perez Dasmariñas}}
While Gov-Gen. Polavieja was poised to strike at Zapote, another Spanish contingent is marching towards Aguinaldo's rear. On February 15, 1897 the Spaniards launched the powerful Cavite offensive to drive and crush Filipino revolutionaries under General Emilio Aguinaldo and his ''Magdalo'' forces which held numerous victories against the Spanish in the early stages of the revolution. Renewed and fully equipped with 100 cannons, 23,000 Spanish ''cazadores'' forces under Major General [[Jose de Lachambre]] have seen town after town, falling back to the Crown. Starting the offensive at Pamplona, Cavite and Bayungyungan, Batangas, Lachambre's men would later march deep into the heart of Aguinaldo's home province. 

Having just won the [[Battle of Zapote Bridge (1897)|battle of Zapote]], Aguinaldo turned his attention at the new Spanish threat determined to recapture most of Cavite. Aguinaldo decided to deploy his forces at Pasong Santol that serves as a bottleneck of Perez Dasmariñas on the way to Imus rendering the Spanish lack of mobility and serving the revolutionaries with natural defensive positions. On February 19, Silang fell to the Spanish juggernaut despite attempts by Filipino forces to defend and then later, recover it. Nine days later, Spanish forces marched into Dasmariñas to reclaim the town. The week after, Spanish troops with good use of artillery pieces they brought along were on the attack again as they moved towards Aguinaldo's capital, Imus. Meanwhile, at the Tejero's Convention, Aguinaldo was voted  ''in absentia'' as the president of the reorganized revolutionary government. Colonel Vicente Riego de Dios was sent by the assembly to fetch Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo who was then in Pasong Santol. The General refused to come, so Crispulo was then sent to talk to his brother. He greeted and talked to his brother and explained his purpose, but Emilio was hesitant to leave his post because of the pending attack of the Spanish in Dasmariñas. In March 1897, a stalemated battle between the revolutionary army of [[Crispulo Aguinaldo]], while taking over General Emilio Aguinaldo's leadership in battle, and the Spanish forces, led by José de Lachambre, occurred in this trail. The Filipinos' resistance was tenacious as ever, refusing to give ground but the far more disciplined Spaniards advanced steadily. Emilio Aguinaldo realizing the size of the enemy and the danger of the situation, sent ''Magdalo'' troops to reinforce the threatened salient but ''Supremo'' Andres Bonifacio summoned ''Magdiwang'' troops under Artemio Ricarte to intercept the ''Magdalo'' troops to [[Battle of Perez Dasmariñas|Pasong Santol]] thus preventing help to the revolutionary soldiers, citing he needed the soldiers elsewhere. The Spaniards pressed the offensive achieving tactical superiority which led to the massacre of the Filipino soldiers, including Aguinaldo's brother. The Spaniards only captured this salient after Crispulo was killed during the battle, and the rebels promptly broke off the engagement and reorganized inside the town. Exploiting the gap among the revolutionaries, the Spaniards decisively defeated the ''Magdalo'' forces.

===Tejeros Convention===
[[File:Gen Aguinaldo.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Emilio Aguinaldo as a [[Field marshal]] during the battle.]]
{{main|Tejeros Convention}}
Conflict within the ranks of the Katipunan factions—and specifically between the [[Magdalo (Katipunan faction)|Magdalo]] and [[Magdiwang (Katipunan faction)|Magdiwang]]—led to Bonifacio's intervention in the province of Cavite.{{sfn|Agoncillo|1990|pp=178–182}} The rebels of Cavite were rumored to have made overtures about establishing a revolutionary government in place of the Katipunan.{{sfn|Agoncillo|1990|p=182}}  Though Bonifacio already considered the Katipunan to be a government, he acquiesced and presided over a convention held on March 22, 1897 in Tejeros, [[Cavite]]. There The Republic of the Philippines was proclaimed, with Aguinaldo being elected as President, [[Mariano Trias]] as Vice-President, [[Artemio Ricarte]] as Captain-General, Emiliano Riego de Dios as the Director of War and [[Andres Bonifacio]] as Director of the Interior. The results were questioned by [[Daniel Tirona]] for Bonifacio's qualifications for that position, Bonifacio was insulted and declared ~ "I, as chairman of this assembly, and as President of the Supreme Council of the Katipunan, as all of you do not deny, declare this assembly dissolved, and I annul all that has been approved and resolved."{{sfn|Agoncillo|1990|p=178}}

Bonifacio refused to recognize the revolutionary government headed by Aguinaldo and reasserted his authority, accusing the Magdalo faction of treason and issued orders contravening orders issued by the Aguinaldo faction.{{sfn|Agoncillo|1990|p=188}} In April 1897, Aguinaldo ordered the arrest of Bonifacio on some information alleging Bonifacio's involvement in some events at [[Indang, Cavite|Indang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artemio Ricarte on the arrest and execution of Bonifacio|url=http://malacanang.gov.ph/3622-artemio-ricarte-on-the-arrest-and-execution-of-bonifacio/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625164313/http://malacanang.gov.ph/3622-artemio-ricarte-on-the-arrest-and-execution-of-bonifacio/|archivedate=2013-06-25|dead-url=unfit&lt;!-- as of 24 September 2016, the url http://malacanang.gov.ph/3622-artemio-ricarte-on-the-arrest-and-execution-of-bonifacio/ navigates to a webpage which fails verification and which says that it is in "Maintenance mode" --&gt;|website=Gov PH|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the trials Andrés and his brother Procopio were ordered to be executed by firing squad under the command of General [[Lazaro Macapagal]]  on May 10, 1897 in the vicinity of Mount Nagpatong, Mount Buntis, Mount Pumutok, and [[Maragondon, Cavite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cecilio D.

===Retreat to Montalban===
{{main|Retreat to Montalban}}
Having lost to the Spanish forces several weeks after the battle of Perez Dasmariñas, Aguinaldo's rear guard fought delaying action against Spanish spearheads until troops and stragglers retreated southwest of Cavite. In late May 1897, with good concealment of retreating soldiers, Aguinaldo, managed to evade the Spanish to establish a link up with Gen. [[Mamerto Natividad]]. With the revolutionaries overwhelmed in Cavite, Natividad was commissioned to look for a place of retreat. He found Biak-Na-Bato. The Spanish pursued the Katipunero forces retreating towards central Luzon, killing many of the revolutionaries. However, some of them joined General [[Manuel Tinio]]'s revolutionary army in Nueva Ecija, where they decisively won the [[Battle of Aliaga]], "The glorious Battle of the Rebellion", only a few weeks after the retreat.

===Biak-na-Bato and Exile===
{{main|Republic of Biak-na-Bato|Pact of Biak-na-Bato}}
The Spanish army launched an attack which forced the revolutionary forces under Aguinaldo into a retreat. On June 24, 1897 Aguinaldo arrived at Biak-na-Bato in [[San Miguel, Bulacan]], and established a headquarters there, located in [[Biak-na-Bato National Park]] in what is now known as ''Aguinaldo Cave''.  In late October 1897, Aguinaldo convened an assembly of generals at Biak-na-Bato, where it was decided to establish a constitutional republic. A constitution patterned closely after the Cuban Constitution was drawn up by Isabelo Artacho and Felix Ferrer. The constitution provided for the creation of a Supreme Council composed of a president, a vice president, a Secretary of War, and a Secretary of the Treasury. Aguinaldo was named president.{{sfn|Agoncillo|1990|pp=183–184}}

[[File:The Hongkong Junta.jpg|thumb|right|Emilio Aguinaldo with the other revolutionaries on the Pact of Biak-na-Bato.]]
From March 1897, [[Fernando Primo de Rivera, 1st Marquis of Estella]], the Spanish [[Governor-General of the Philippines]], had been encouraging prominent Filipinos to contact Aguinaldo for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. On August 9, Manila lawyer [[Pedro Paterno]] met with Aguinaldo at Biak-na-Bato with a proposal for peace based on reforms and amnesty. In succeeding months, Paterno conducted [[shuttle diplomacy]], acting as an intermediary between de Rivera and Aguinaldo. On December 14–15, 1897 Aguinaldo signed the [[Pact of Biak-na-Bato]], under which Aguinaldo effectively agreed to end hostilities and dissolve his government in exchange for amnesty and "₱800,000 (Mexican)" (Aguinaldo's description of the amount) as an indemnity.{{sfn|Zaide|1999|p=252}}&lt;ref name=Aguinaldo1899ch2&gt;{{Citation

While in exile, Aguinaldo reorganized his revolutionary government into the so-called "Hong Kong Junta" and enlarging it into the "Supreme Council of the Nation".{{sfn|Zaide|1999|p=253}}

===Return to the Philippines===
[[File:Philippines Aguinaldo flag (obverse).svg|thumb|The flag of the [[First Philippine Republic]] designed by Emilio Aguinaldo himself.]]
On April 25, the [[Spanish–American War]] began. While the war mostly focused on Cuba, the United States Navy's [[Asiatic Squadron]] was in [[Hong Kong]], and commanded by [[Commodore (USN)|Commodore]] [[George Dewey]], it sailed for the Philippines. On May 1, 1898, in the [[Battle of Manila Bay]], the squadron engaged attacked and destroyed the Spanish army &amp; navy's Pacific Squadron and proceeded to blockade Manila.{{sfn|Zaide|1999|pp=255–256}} Several days later, Dewey agreed to transport Aguinaldo from Hong Kong to the Philippines aboard the [[USS McCulloch (1897)|USS ''McCulloch'']], which left Hong Kong with Aguinaldo on 16 May. arriving in Cavite on 19 May.{{sfn|Agoncillo|1990|p=157}} Aguinaldo promptly resumed command of revolutionary forces and besieged Manila.{{sfn|Zaide|1999|pp=256–257}}

===Dictatorial and Revolutionary governments===
{{main|Dictatorial Government of the Philippines|Revolutionary  Government of the Philippines}}
Aguinaldo had brought with him the draft constitution of [[Mariano Ponce]] for the establishment of federal revolutionary republic upon his return to Manila, however, on May 24, 1898 in Cavite, Aguinaldo issued a proclamation, upon the advice of his war counselor [[Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista]], in which he assumed command of all Philippine forces and established a dictatorial government with himself as titular [[dictator]] on which power vested upon him to administer decrees promulgated under his sole responsibility. The dictatorial government was provisionary in character until peace have been established and unrestrained liberty was attained .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Titherington|first=Richard Handfield|title=A history of the Spanish–American War of 1898|url=https://archive.org/details/spanishamwar00tithrich|year=1900|publisher=D.

===Battle of Alapan and Declaration of Independence===
{{main|Battle of Alapan}}
On May 28, 1898, Aguinaldo gathered a force of about 18,000 troops and fought against a small garrison of Spanish troops in [[Battle of Alapan|Alapan]], Imus, Cavite. The battle lasted for five hours, from 10:00 A.M. to 3:00 P.M. After the victory at Alapan, Aguinaldo unfurled the Philippine flag for the first time, and hoisted it at the Teatro Caviteño in Cavite Nuevo (present-day Cavite City) in front of Filipino revolutionaries and more than 300 captured Spanish troops. A group of American sailors of the US Asiatic Squadron also witnessed the unfurling. [[Flag Day]] is celebrated every May 28 in honor of this battle.

On June 12, Aguinaldo promulgated the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence]] from Spain his own [[Aguinaldo Shrine|mansion house]] in Cavite El Viejo, believing that declaration would inspire the Filipino people to eagerly against the Spaniards. On June 18, he issued a decree formally establishing his dictatorial government on which he also provided the organization of the local government and the establishment and composition of the Revolutionary Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guevara|1972|p=[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/philamer/aab1246.0001.001/28 10]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 23, Aguinaldo issued a decree replacing his dictatorial government with a revolutionary government with himself as president, upon the recommendation of his adviser [[Apolinario Mabini]]. The decree defined the organization of the central government and the establishment and election of delegates to the Revolutionary Congress and to prepare the shift from a revolutionary government to a Republic&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guevara|1972|p=[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/philamer/aab1246.0001.001/53 35]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kalaw|1926}} (Appendix C)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final Plan to Defeat the Spaniards and The Arrival of Americans===
{{main|Battle of Manila (1898) }}

By May 1898, Filipino troops cleared Cavite of Spanish forces. In late June 1898, Aguinaldo with the help of American allies who are now landing in Cavite were now preparing to drive the Spaniards out of Manila. The first contingent of American troops arrived in [[Cavite]] on June 30, the second under General [[Francis V. Greene]] on 17 July, and the third under General [[Arthur MacArthur Jr.|Arthur MacArthur]] on 30 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Halstead|1898|p=[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?pageno=95&amp;fk_files=58428 95]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, some 12,000 U.S. troops had landed in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolff|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hHzvx94oiUgC&amp;pg=PA100 100]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aguinaldo had presented surrender terms to Spanish [[Governor-General of the Philippines]] [[Basilio Augustín]], who refused them initially, believing more Spanish troops will be sent to lift the siege.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolff|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hHzvx94oiUgC&amp;pg=PA108 108]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Agoncillo|1990|p=194}} As the combined forces of Filipinos and Americans are closing in, Augustín realized that his position is hopeless, he secretly continued to negotiate with Aguinaldo even offering ₱1 million, but the latter refused.  When the Spanish parliament, the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]], learned of Governor-General Augustín's attempt to negotiate the surrender of the army to Filipinos under Aguinaldo, it was furious, and relieved Augustín of his duties as Governor-General, effective July 24. Spain had learned of Augustín's intentions to surrender Manila to the Filipinos, which had been the reason he had been replaced by Jáudenes. On 16 June, warships departed Spain to lift the siege, but they altered course for Cuba where a Spanish fleet was imperiled by the U.S. Navy.{{sfn|Agoncillo|1990|p=115}}  In August 1898, life in [[Intramuros]] (the walled center of Manila), where the normal population of about ten thousand had swelled to about seventy thousand, had become unbearable. Realizing that it was only a matter of time before the city fell, and fearing vengeance and looting if the city fell to Filipino revolutionaries, Governor [[Fermin Jáudenes]], Augustín's replacement suggested to Dewey, through the Belgian consul, [[Édouard André (consul)|Édouard André]], that the city be surrendered to the Americans after a short, "mock" battle. Dewey had initially rejected the suggestion because he lacked the troops to block Filipino revolutionary forces which numbered 40 000, but when Merritt's troops became available he sent a message to Jáudenes, agreeing to the mock battle. Though a bloodless mock battle had been planned, Spanish troops had opened fire in a skirmish which left six Americans and forty-nine Spaniards dead when Filipino revolutionaries, thinking that the attack was genuine, joined advancing U.S. troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Karnow|1989|p=124}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Except for the unplanned casualties, the battle had gone according to plan; the Spanish had surrendered the city to the Americans, and it had not fallen to the Filipino revolutionaries, thus felt betrayed by the Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolff|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hHzvx94oiUgC&amp;pg=PA129 129]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of September, Aguinaldo's forces had captured over 9,000 Spanish prisoners, who were relieved of their weapons. They were generally free to move around, but remained within the control of Aguinaldo. Unbeknownst to Aguinaldo, on December 10, 1898, the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|1898 Treaty of Paris]] was signed, transferring the Philippines from Spain to the United States with a sum of $20 million.&lt;ref name=TofP&gt;{{citation|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/sp1898.asp|title=Treaty of Peace Between the United States and Spain; December 10, 1898|publisher=[[Yale]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidency of First Philippine Republic and Philippine-American War==
{{Main|First Philippine Republic}}
The [[First Philippine Republic]] was formally established with the proclamation of the [[Malolos Constitution]] on January 21, 1899 in [[Malolos]], [[Bulacan]] and endured until capture of Emilio Aguinaldo by the American forces on March 23, 1901 in [[Palanan, Isabela]], which effectively dissolved the First Republic.
[[File:Emilio Aguinaldo boarding USS Vicksburg.jpg|thumb|right|Aguinaldo boarding {{USS|Vicksburg|PG-11|6}} following his capture in 1901]]

On August 12, 1898, American forces captured Manila during the [[Battle of Manila (1898)|Battle of Manila]] and on August 14, 1898 established the [[United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands]], with Major General [[Wesley Merritt]] as the first [[Governor-General of the Philippines#United States Military Government (1898–1901)|American Military Governor]].{{sfn|Halstead|1898|pp=[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?pageno=110&amp;fk_files=58428 110-112]}} On the night of February 4, 1899, a Filipino was shot by an American sentry. This incident was considered to be the beginning of the [[Philippine–American War]], and culminated in the 1899 [[Battle of Manila (1899)|Battle of Manila]] between American and Filipino forces. Superior American technology drove Filipino troops away from the city, and Aguinaldo's government had to move from one place to another as the military situation escalated.{{sfn|Zaide|1999|pp=268–270, 273–274}}  At the [[Battle of Marilao River |battle of Marilao river]], the president himself lead his forces to prevent American crossings. The Americans gained superiority in the battle only after severe fighting and the use of gunboats in the river that "made great execution" of Filipino soldiers.&lt;ref name="V. R. Jose"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jose|first=Vicencio|title=Rise and Fall of Antonio Luna|publisher=Solar Publishing Corporation|pages=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The American official account had admitted that Aguinaldo acted with a great sense of military strategy, averting disastrous routs while succeeding to sustain heavy damage on the enemy (that is, the Americans).  On November 13, 1899, Emilio Aguinaldo disbanded the regular Filipino army and decreed that guerrilla war would henceforth be the strategy. Aguinaldo led the resistance against the Americans but retreated to Northern [[Luzon]].

On March 23, 1901, with the aid of [[Macabebe Scouts]], led by Gen. [[Frederick Funston]], [[First Philippine Republic|Aguinaldo was captured]] in his headquarters in [[Palanan, Isabela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=(F.R.G.S.)|first=John Foreman|title=The Philippine Islands: A Political, Geographical, Ethnographical, Social and Commercial History of the Philippine Archipelago, Embracing the Whole Period of Spanish Rule, with an Account of the Succeeding American Insular Government|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W2crAAAAYAAJ|year=1906|publisher=C.

forces was led by Gen. [[Macario Sakay]] who established the [[Tagalog Republic]].  On April 19, 1901, Aguinaldo took an oath of allegiance to the United States, formally ending the First Republic and recognizing the sovereignty of the United States over the Philippines.{{sfn|Zaide|1999|pp=274–275}} After the capture of Aguinaldo, some Filipino commanders continued the revolution.

During the American period, Aguinaldo supported groups that advocated for immediate independence and helped veterans of the struggle. He organized the ''Asociación de los Veteranos de la Revolución'' (Association of Veterans of the Revolution) to secure pensions for its members and made arrangements for them to buy land on installment from the government. 

Displaying the Philippine flag was declared illegal by the Sedition Act of 1907. However, the Act was amended on October 30, 1919.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/ph-hist.html#desc |title=History of the Philippines Flag |accessdate=June 6, 2007 |last=Quezon |first=Manuel L.

Aguinaldo retired from public life for many years. In 1935, when the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] was established in preparation for Philippine independence, he ran for president in the [[Philippine presidential election, 1935]], but lost by a landslide to [[Manuel L. Quezon]].{{efn|Quezon took 67.99% of the popular vote; Aguinaldo 17.54%}} The two men formally reconciled in 1941, when President Quezon moved Flag Day to June 12, to commemorate the proclamation of Philippine independence.&lt;ref name=hist /&gt;

In 1950, President [[Elpidio Quirino]] appointed Aguinaldo as a member of the [[Philippine Council of State]], where he served a full term. He returned to retirement soon after, dedicating his time and attention to veteran soldiers' "interests and welfare".

He was made an honorary Doctor of Laws, Honoris Causa, by the [[University of the Philippines]] in 1953.

On May 12, 1962, President [[Diosdado Macapagal]] changed the celebration of Independence Day from July 4 to June 12 in order to honor Aguinaldo and the Revolution of 1898 rather than the establishment of the [[Insular Government of the Philippine Islands]] by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Aguinaldo was rushed to [[Veterans Memorial Medical Center]] in Quezon City on October 5, 1962, under the care of Dr. Juana Blanco Fernandez, MD, where he stayed there for 469 days until he died of [[coronary thrombosis]] at age 94 on February 6, 1964.&lt;ref name="death"&gt;The year of birth on his death certificate was incorrectly typed as 1809.&lt;br /&gt;"Philippines, Civil Registration (Local), 1888–1983," index and images, [https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-1971-27184-32236-46?cc=1410394&amp;wc=9Z7H-JWG:25272501,114827101,25271303,25290201 FamilySearch] (accessed May 2, 2014), Metropolitan Manila &gt; Quezon City &gt; Death certificates &gt; 1964; citing National Census and Statistics Office, Manila.&lt;/ref&gt; A year before his death, he donated his lot and mansion to the government.

In 1964, he published his book, "''Mga Gunita ng Himagsikan''" ('''Memoirs of the Revolution'''). A second publication was made in 1998 during the 100th anniversary of Philippine Independence.

In 1985, [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] issued a new [[Philippine five peso bill|5-peso bill]] depicting a portrait of Aguinaldo on the front. The back features the declaration of the Philippine independence on June 12, 1898. Printing was discontinued in 1996, when it was replaced with a [[Philippine five peso coin|₱5.00 coin]] one year earlier (with the last production year was stamped in 1995), whose obverse features a portrait of Aguinaldo.

'''Fermentek Ltd.''' is a [[biotechnology|biotechnological]] company in the [[Atarot]] industrial zone of [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]]. It specializes in the research, development and manufacture of biologically active, natural products isolated from microorganisms as well as from other natural sources such as plants and algae.

The main microorganisms used are nonpathogenic [[Actinobacteria|actinomycetes]], Nocardia and [[Streptomyces|Streptomycetes]]. The [[Fungus|fungi]] used are: Penicillium, Aspergillus, Fusarium and the like. None of these is a human [[pathogen]].

Fermentek does not sell to individuals. Most of its products are marketed through major international distributors specializing in chemicals, under their own brand names. Nevertheless, Fermentek has specific impact on the biochemical market, especially in the field of mycotoxins.

[[Mycotoxin]]s are toxic compounds produced by molds in human food and farm animal feeds, thus being economically important factors. Fermentek manufactures an extensive line of pure mycotoxins used as standards in food analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irmm.jrc.ec.europa.eu/EURLs/eurl_mycotoxins/Documents/JRC%2060040_Mycotoxin%20factsheet_3rd%20edition.pdf Mycotoxin Fact-sheet, by European commission Institute for reference materials and standards 3rd]&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as Aflatoxin M2, Fermentek supplies the entire world's requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irmm.jrc.ec.europa.eu/EURLs/eurl_mycotoxins/Documents/Factsheet%20Mycotoxins.pdf Mycotoxin Fact-sheet, by European commission Institute for reference materials and standards 4th edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Fermentek announced a product family of highly standardized calibrant solutions of main mycotoxins. These are marketed under the brand name FermaSol. In 2010 it obtained [[ISO 13485]] accreditation in connection with the production of starting materials for experimental drug production, and with manufacturing of reference standards of food contaminants.

None of Fermentek's products have been invented by it. Fermentek's aim is to make known compounds affordable to the scientific community.

Fermentek was founded by Dr Yosef Behrend in 1994. It  moved in 2004 to its new building, quadrupling its working space and greatly enlarging its manufacturing capacities.

==Technology==
Fermentek operates fermentors from 10 to 15000 liters, filter presses and centrifuges of matching capacity. 

According to the company policy as declared at its official website, Fermentek uses only the "Classical" biotechnology approach. This means that only genetically unmodified natural microbial strains are employed, and no attempt is made to achieve mutants, neither random nor targeted.

[[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] '''Virgil Ivan''' "'''Gus'''" '''Grissom''' (April 3, 1926 – January 27, 1967) was one of the seven original [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]'s [[Project Mercury]] [[astronaut]]s, and the first of the [[Mercury Seven]] to die. He was also a [[Project Gemini]] and an [[Apollo program]] astronaut. Grissom was the second American to fly in space, and the first member of the [[NASA Astronaut Corps]] to fly in space twice. In addition, Grissom was a [[World War II]] and [[Korean War]] veteran, [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[test pilot]], and a [[mechanical engineer]]. He was a recipient of the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], and the [[Air Medal]] with an [[oak leaf cluster]], a two-time recipient of the [[NASA Distinguished Service Medal]], and, posthumously, the [[Congressional Space Medal of Honor]].

During [[World War II]], Grissom enlisted in the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] as an aviation cadet. After his discharge from military service, Grissom enrolled at [[Purdue University]], graduating with a bachelor's in [[mechanical engineering]] in 1950. He reenlisted in the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]], earning his pilot's wings in 1951, and flew 100 combat missions during the [[Korean War]]. After returning to the United States, Grissom was reassigned to work as a flight instructor at [[Bryan Air Force Base]] in [[Texas]]. He attended the U.S. [[Air Force Institute of Technology]] for a year, earning a bachelor's degree in aeromechanics, and received his test pilot training at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in [[California]] before his assignment as a test pilot at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] in [[Ohio]].

Selected as one of the Mercury Seven astronauts, Grissom was the pilot of Mercury-Redstone 4 (''[[Liberty Bell 7]]''), the second American suborbital flight, on July 21, 1961. At the end of the flight, the capsule's hatch blew off prematurely after it landed in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Grissom was picked up by recovery helicopters, but the blown hatch caused the craft to fill with water and sink. His next flight was in the [[Project Gemini]] program as command pilot for [[Gemini 3]] (''Molly Brown''), which was a successful three-orbit mission on March 23, 1965. Grissom, commander of ''AS-204'' ([[Apollo 1]]), along with his fellow astronauts [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]] and [[Roger B. Chaffee|Roger Chaffee]], died on January 27, 1967, during a pre-launch test for the [[Apollo 1]] mission at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Kennedy]], [[Florida]].

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Virgil Ivan Grissom was born in [[Mitchell, Indiana]], on April 3, 1926, to Dennis David Grissom, a signalman for the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]], and Cecile King Grissom, a homemaker. Virgil was the family's second child (an older sister died in infancy shortly before his birth). He was followed by three younger siblings: a sister, Wilma, and two brothers, Norman and Lowell.&lt;ref name=Scouting&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/About/FactSheets/scouting_space.aspx|accessdate=June 25, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032406/http://www.scouting.org/about/factsheets/scouting_space.aspx |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |title=Scouting and Space Exploration |publisher=Boy Scouts of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

As a youth Grissom attended the local [[Churches of Christ|Church of Christ]], where he remained a lifelong member, joined the local [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] Troop 46, earning the rank of [[Star (Boy Scouts of America)|Star Scout]],
and worked odd jobs to keep busy and earn extra money. His first jobs were delivering newspapers for the ''[[Indianapolis Star]]'' in the morning and the ''Bedford Times'' in the evening. Grissom also picked fruit in area orchards and worked at a local meat market, a service station, and a clothing store in Mitchell. Grissom attended local public schools and graduated from [[Mitchell High School (Indiana)|Mitchell High School]] in 1944. Although he excelled at mathematics, Grissom was an average high school student in other subjects.&lt;ref name=Scouting/&gt;&lt;ref name=Boomhower42-43&gt;Boomhower, pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Grissom occasionally spent time at a local airport in [[Bedford, Indiana]], where he first became interested in aviation. A local attorney who owned a small plane would take him on flights for a $1 fee and taught him the basics of flying.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and family===
Grissom met and befriended Betty Lavonne Moore (1927–2018)&lt;!-- apnews.com/d90d71139414422e94774fb83ec167ec --&gt;, his future wife, through their extracurricular activities in high school. As a member of his boy scout troop, Grissom carried the American flag at the opening ceremonies of high school basketball games, while Moore played the drum in the high school band.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;

Grissom married Moore on July 6, 1945, at the First Baptist Church in Mitchell when he was home on leave at the end of [[World War II]]. Grissom' brother, Norman, served as his best man; Moore's sister, Mary Lou Fosbrink, was her maid of honor.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Grissom and his wife, Betty, had two sons: Scott, born on May 15, 1950, and Mark, born on December 30, 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, pp. 59 and 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautmemorial.net/grissom.htm |title=In Memoriam – Lt. Col. Virgil Ivan "Gus" Grissom (USAF) |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723225211/http://astronautmemorial.net/grissom.htm |archivedate=July 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both sons graduated from [[Purdue University]] and eventually had aviation-related careers.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt;

Grissom "greatly valued being home with his family, stating that 'it sure helped to spend a quiet evening with your wife and children in your own living room'".&lt;ref name=Zornio&gt;{{cite web|title=40th Anniversary of Mercury 7: Virgil Ivan "Gus" Grissom|publisher=NASA|url=https://history.nasa.gov/40thmerc7/grissom.htm|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Grissom "refused to let work problems intrude on his time at home, and tried to complete technical reading or paperwork after the boys were asleep," while Betty Grissom "accommodated his hectic schedule by completing major chores and errands during the week so weekends would be free for family activities."&lt;ref name=Zornio/&gt; Two of Grissom's favorite pastimes were [[hunting]] and [[fishing]], to which he introduced his sons. The family also enjoyed water sports and skiing.&lt;ref name=Zornio/&gt;

===World War II military service===
[[File:Gus Grissom photo portrait head and shoulders.jpg|thumb|right|Gus Grissom in his Air Force uniform]]

[[World War II]] began while Grissom was still in high school, but he was eager to join the military upon graduation. Grissom enlisted as an [[aviation cadet]] in the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] during his senior year in high school, and completed an entrance exam in November 1943. Grissom was inducted into the U.S. Army Air Forces on August 8, 1944, at [[Fort Benjamin Harrison]], Indiana. He was sent to [[Sheppard Air Force Base|Sheppard Field]] in [[Wichita Falls, Texas]], for five weeks of basic flight training, and was later stationed at [[Brooks Air Force Base|Brooks Field]] in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]]. In January 1945 Grissom was assigned to [[Boca Raton Army Airfield]] in [[Florida]]. Although he was interested in becoming a pilot, most of Grissom's time before his discharge in 1945 was spent as a [[Clerk (position)|clerk]].&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar civilian employment===
Grissom was discharged from military service in November 1945, after the war had ended, and returned to Mitchell, where he took a job at Carpenter Body Works, a local bus manufacturing business. Grissom was determined to make his career in aviation and attend college. Using the [[G.I. Bill]] for partial payment of his school tuition, Grissom enrolled at [[Purdue University]] in September 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, pp. 50–53&lt;/ref&gt;

Due a shortage of campus housing during her husband's first semester in college in [[West Lafayette, Indiana]], Grissom's wife, Betty, stayed in Mitchell living with her parents, while Grissom lived in a rented apartment with another male student. Betty Grissom joined her husband on campus during his second semester, and the couple settled into a small, one-bedroom apartment. Grissom continued his studies at Purdue, worked part-time as a cook at a local restaurant, and took summer classes in order to finish college early, while his wife work the night shift as a long-distance operator for the Indiana Bell Telephone Company to help pay for his schooling and their living expenses. Grissom graduated from Purdue with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[mechanical engineering]] in February 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, pp. 55–57&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korean War military career===
Grissom re-enlisted in the military after he graduated from Purdue, this time in the newly formed [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]. He was accepted into the [[United States Air Force Basic Military Training|air cadet basic training program]] at [[Randolph Air Force Base]] in [[Universal City, Texas]]. Upon completion of the program, he was assigned to [[Williams Air Force Base]] in [[Mesa, Arizona]], where his wife, Betty, and infant son, Scott, joined him, but the family remained there only briefly. In March 1951 Grissom received his [[Command Pilot Wings|pilot wings]] and a commission as a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]]. Nine months later, in December 1951, Grissom and his family moved into new living quarters in [[Presque Isle, Maine]], where he was assigned to [[Presque Isle International Airport|Presque Isle Air Force Base]] and became a member of the [[75th Fighter Squadron|75th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]].&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, pp. 57–60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:North American F86-01.JPG|thumb|left|[[United States Air Force|USAF]] [[F-86 Sabre|F-86F]], similar to the aircraft Grissom flew in Korea]]
With the ongoing [[Korean War]], Grissom's squadron was dispatched to the war zone in February 1952. There he flew as an [[F-86 Sabre]] replacement pilot and was reassigned to the [[334th Fighter Squadron]] of the [[4th Fighter Wing|4th Fighter Interceptor Wing]] stationed at [[Gimpo International Airport|Kimpo Air Base]].&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; He flew one hundred [[Aerial warfare|combat missions]] during approximately six months of service in Korea, including multiple occasions when he broke up air raids from North Korean [[MiG]]s. On March 11, 1952, Grissom was promoted to [[first lieutenant]] and was cited for his "superlative airmanship" for his actions on March 23, 1952, when he flew cover for a photo reconnaissance mission.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, pp. 63–68&lt;/ref&gt; Grissom was also awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] and the [[Air Medal]] with an [[oak leaf cluster]] for his military service in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

After flying his quota of one hundred missions, Grissom asked to remain in Korea to fly another twenty-five flights, but his request was denied. Grissom returned to the United States to serve as a [[flight instructor]] at [[Bryan Air Force Base|Bryan AFB]] in [[Bryan, Texas]], where he was joined by his wife, Betty, and son, Scott. The Grissoms' second child, Mark, was born there in 1953. Grissom soon learned that flight instructors faced their own set of on-the-job risks. During a training exercise with a cadet, the trainee pilot caused a flap to break off their two-seat trainer, sending it into a roll. Grissom quickly climbed from the rear seat of the small aircraft to take over the controls and safely land it.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1955, Grissom was reassigned to the U.S. [[Air Force Institute of Technology]] at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] near [[Dayton, Ohio]]. After completing the year-long course he earned a bachelor's degree in [[aeromechanics]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1956, he entered [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School|USAF Test Pilot School]] at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in [[California]], and returned to Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio in May 1957, after attaining the rank of captain. Grissom served as a [[test pilot]] assigned to the fighter branch.&lt;ref name="GG"&gt;{{cite web|work=U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame |url=http://www.astronautscholarship.org/grissom.html |title=Astronaut Biographies: Virgil I.

===NASA career===
[[File:Project Mercury-Mercury Seven-Astronauts.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Project Mercury]] astronauts with a model of an [[SM-65 Atlas|Atlas rocket]], July 12, 1962 – Grissom is at the far left.]]

In 1959 Grissom received an official [[teletype]] message instructing him to report to an address in [[Washington, D.C.]], wearing civilian clothes. The message was classified [[Classified information|"Top Secret"]] and Grissom was ordered not to discuss its contents with anyone. Of the 508 military candidates who were considered, he was one of 110 test pilots whose credentials had earned them an invitation to learn more about the U.S. space program in general and its [[Project Mercury]]. Grissom was intrigued by the program, but knew that competition for the final spots would be fierce.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, pp. 88–91&lt;/ref&gt; 0&lt;ref name="nasabio"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/Apollo204/zorn/grissom.htm|title=Detailed Biographies of Apollo I Crew – Gus Grissom|website=NASA History Program Office|access-date=February 21, 2017|last1=White|first1=Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grissom passed the initial screening in Washington, D.C., and was among the thirty-nine candidates sent to the [[Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute|Lovelace Clinic]]  in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], and the Aeromedical Laboratory of the Wright Air Development Center in Dayton, Ohio, to undergo extensive physical and psychological testing. He was nearly disqualified when doctors discovered that he suffered from [[Allergic rhinitis|hay fever]], but was permitted to continue after he argued that his allergies would not be a problem due to the absence of ragweed pollen in space.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 13, 1959, Grissom received official notification that he had been selected as one of the seven Project Mercury astronauts. Grissom and the six other men, after taking a leave of absence from their respective branches of the military service, reported to the Special Task Group at [[Langley Air Force Base]] in [[Virginia]] on April 27, 1959, to begin their astronaut training.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ordinary Supermen"&gt;[[Discovery Channel]], [[When We Left Earth: The NASA Missions]], "Ordinary Supermen," airdate June 8, 2008 (season 1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zornio|first1=Mary C.|title=Virgil Ivan "Gus" Grissom|url=https://history.nasa.gov/40thmerc7/grissom.htm|website=NASA History Program Office|accessdate=November 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Project Mercury====
{{Main|Mercury-Redstone 4}}
[[File:Grissom prepares to enter Liberty Bell 7 61-MR4-76.jpg|thumb|left|Grissom in front of the ''[[Liberty Bell 7]]'' spacecraft]]

On July 21, 1961, Grissom was pilot of the second Project Mercury flight, Mercury-Redstone 4. Grissom's spacecraft, which he named ''Liberty Bell 7'', was launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]], a [[Sub-orbital spaceflight|sub-orbital flight]] that lasted 15 minutes and 37 seconds.&lt;ref name="jscbio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nasabio" /&gt; After [[splashdown]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the ''Liberty Bell 7''{{'}}s emergency explosive bolts unexpectedly fired, blowing off the hatch and causing water to flood into the spacecraft. Grissom quickly exited through the open hatch and into the ocean. While waiting for recovery helicopters from {{USS|Randolph|CV-15|6}} to pick him up, Grissom struggled to keep from drowning after his [[Navy Mark IV|spacesuit]] began losing buoyancy due to an open air inlet. Grissom managed to stay afloat until he was pulled from the water by a helicopter and taken to the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] ship. In the meantime another recovery helicopter tried to lift and retrieve the ''Liberty Bell 7'', but the flooding spacecraft became too heavy, forcing the recovery crew to cut it loose, and it ultimately sank.&lt;ref name="nasabio" /&gt;

When reporters at a news conference surrounded Grissom after his space flight to ask how he felt, Grissom replied, "Well, I was scared a good portion of the time; I guess that's a pretty good indication."&lt;ref name=upi-events-1961&gt;{{cite news |publisher=UPI.com |work=Year in Review |url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/Audio/Events-of-1961/U.S.-in-Space/ |title=U.S. in Space |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grissom stated he had done nothing to cause the hatch to blow, and no definitive explanation for the incident was found.&lt;ref name="nasabio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/dec/12/news/mn-43115|title=Liberty Bell 7 Yields Clues to Its Sinking|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|access-date=January 29, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327181316/http://articles.latimes.com/1999/dec/12/news/mn-43115|archivedate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert F. Thompson, Director of Mercury Operations, was dispatched to {{USS|Randolph|CV-15|6}} by [[Space Task Group]] Director Robert Gilruth and spoke with Grissom upon his arrival on the aircraft carrier. Grissom explained that he had gotten ahead in the mission timeline and had removed the detonator cap, and also pulled the safety pin. Once the pin was removed, the trigger was no longer held in place and could have inadvertently fired as a result of ocean wave action, bobbing as a result of helicopter rotor wash, or other activity. NASA officials concluded Grissom had not necessarily initiated the firing of the explosive hatch, which would have required pressing a plunger that required five pounds of force to depress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/11/with-every-splashdown-nasa-embraces-the-legacy-of-gus-grissom/|title=Gus Grissom taught NASA a hard lesson: 'You can hurt yourself in the ocean'|last1=Berger|first1=Eric|date=November 8, 2016|access-date=March 26, 2017|publisher=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initiating the explosive egress system called for pushing, or hitting, a metal trigger with the hand, which would have left an unavoidably large obvious bruise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=French, F.; Burgess, C. |title=Into That Silent Sea: Trailblazers of the Space Era, 1961–1965 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press | series = | volume = | edition = |year=2007|location=Lincoln|page=93|isbn=978-0-8032-1146-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Grissom was found not to have any of the telltale hand bruising.&lt;ref name="nasabio"/&gt;

While the debate continued about the premature detonation of ''Liberty Bell 7'''s hatch bolts, precautions were initiated for subsequent flights. Fellow Mercury astronaut [[Wally Schirra]], at the end of his [[Mercury-Atlas 8|October 3, 1962, flight]], remained inside his spacecraft until it was safely aboard the recovery ship, and made a point of deliberately blowing the hatch to get out of the spacecraft, bruising his hand.&lt;ref name="nasabio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2060/19670005605 |title=This New Ocean: A History of Project Mercury |year=1966 |author1=Alexander, C.

Grissom's spacecraft was [[Mercury-Redstone 4#Recovery of Liberty Bell 7|recovered in 1999]], but no further evidence was found that could conclusively explain how the explosive hatch release had occurred. Later, [[Guenter Wendt]], pad leader for the early American manned space launches, wrote that he believed a small cover over the external release actuator was accidentally lost sometime during the flight or splashdown. Another possible explanation was that the hatch's T-handle may have been tugged by a stray parachute suspension line, or was perhaps damaged by the heat of re-entry, and after cooling upon splashdown it contracted and caught fire.&lt;ref name="Ordinary Supermen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Banke |first=Jim |website=Space|title=Gus Grissom didn't sink the Liberty Bell 7 Mercury capsule |url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/missions/liberty_bell_000617.html |date=June 17, 2000 |accessdate=December 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Project Gemini====
{{Main|Gemini 3}}
In early 1964 [[Alan Shepard]] was grounded after being diagnosed with [[Ménière's disease]] and Grissom was designated command pilot for [[Gemini 3]], the first manned [[Project Gemini]] flight, which flew on March 23, 1965.&lt;ref name="nasabio" /&gt; This mission made Grissom the first [[NASA Astronaut Corps|NASA astronaut]] to fly into space twice.&lt;ref&gt;The first person to reach space twice was [[Joseph A. Walker]], a NASA [[test pilot]] who made two [[X-15]] flights in 1963 which exceeded {{convert|100|km|nmi|sp=us}} altitude, the internationally recognized definition of outer space.&lt;/ref&gt; The two-man flight on Gemini 3 with Grissom and [[John Young (astronaut)|John W. Young]] made three revolutions of the Earth and lasted for 4 hours, 52 minutes and 31 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautsmemorial.org/virgil-ldquogusrdquo-grissom-honored.html|title=Virgil "Gus" Grissom Honored|publisher=Astronaut Memorial Foundation|access-date=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grissom was one of the eight pilots of the NASA [[paraglider research vehicle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/Gallery/Photo/Paresev/HTML/index.html|title=Photo Paresev Contact Sheet|access-date=November 28, 2016|website=NASA Dryden Flight Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grissom, the shortest of the original seven astronauts at five feet seven inches tall, worked very closely with the engineers and technicians from [[McDonnell Aircraft]] who built the Gemini spacecraft. Because of his involvement in the design of the first three spacecraft, his fellow astronauts humorously referred to the craft as "the Gusmobile". By July 1963 NASA discovered 14 out of its 16 astronauts could not fit themselves into the cabin and the later cockpits were modified.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=On the Shoulders of Titans: A History of Project Gemini |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4203/ch10-2.htm |first=Barton C. |last=Hacker |author2=James M. Grimwood |year=1977 |accessdate=January 23, 2008 |publisher=NASA Special Publications |series=NASA History Series #4203}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time Grissom invented the multi-axis [[translation (physics)|translation]] thruster controller used to push the Gemini and Apollo spacecraft in linear directions for [[space rendezvous|rendezvous and docking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Agle  | first = D.C.  | title = Flying the Gusmobile  | journal = Air &amp; Space  | publisher = [[Smithsonian Institution]]  | volume =  | issue =  | pages =  | date = September 1, 1998  | origyear =  | language =  | url = http://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/mobile.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Naming of the ''Molly Brown''=====
In a joking nod to the sinking of his Mercury craft, Grissom named the first Gemini spacecraft ''[[Margaret Brown|Molly Brown]]'' (after the popular Broadway show, ''[[The Unsinkable Molly Brown (musical)|The Unsinkable Molly Brown]]'', about a woman who survived the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]).&lt;ref name="nasabio" /&gt; Some NASA publicity officials were unhappy with this name and asked Grissom and his pilot, [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]], to come up with a new one. When they offered ''Titanic'' as an alternate,&lt;ref name="nasabio" /&gt; NASA executives decided to allow them to use the name of ''Molly Brown'' for Gemini 3, but did not use it in official references. Much to the agency's chagrin, [[Capsule communicator|CAPCOM]] [[Gordon Cooper]] gave Gemini 3 its sendoff on launch with the remark to Grissom and Young, "You're on your way, ''Molly Brown''!" Ground controllers also used it to reference the spacecraft throughout its flight.&lt;ref name = "Shayler 2002 186"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shayler, David|title=Gemini: Steps to the Moon|location=Chichester, United Kingdom|publisher=Praxis Publishing| series = | volume = | edition = |page=186|year=2001|isbn=1-85233-405-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the safe return of Gemini 3, NASA announced new spacecraft would not be nicknamed. Hence, [[Gemini 4]] was not called ''American Eagle'' as its crew had planned. The practice of nicknaming spacecraft resumed in 1967, when managers realized that the [[Apollo Program|Apollo]] flights needed a name for each of two flight elements, the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Module]] (CSM) and the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]]. Lobbying by the astronauts and senior NASA administrators also had an effect. [[Apollo 9]] used the name ''Gumdrop'' for the Command Module and ''Spider'' for the Lunar Module.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Michael|title=Carrying the Fire: an Astronaut's Journey|isbn=978-0-8154-1028-7|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|date=2001|pages=138–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Wally Schirra was prevented from naming his [[Apollo 7]] spacecraft ''Phoenix'' in honor of the [[Apollo 1]] crew because some believed that its nickname as a metaphor for "fire" might be misunderstood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-101514a-apollo7-phoenix-mission-patch.html|title=Alternate Apollo 7: Astronaut's anniversary patch recalls 'Flight of the Phoenix'|access-date=May 31, 2017|publisher=collectSPACE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grissom was backup command pilot for [[Gemini 6A]] when he was transferred to the [[Apollo program]] and was assigned as commander of the first manned mission, [[Apollo 1|AS-204]], with Senior Pilot [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], who had flown in space on the Gemini 4 mission when he became the first American to make a spacewalk, and Pilot [[Roger B. Chaffee]].&lt;ref name="nasabio" /&gt; The three men were granted permission to refer to their flight as "Apollo 1" on their mission insignia patch.

Problems with the simulator proved extremely annoying to Grissom, who told a reporter the problems with Apollo 1 came "in bushelfuls" and that he was skeptical of its chances to complete its fourteen-day mission.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; The engineers who programmed the Apollo training simulator had a difficult time keeping the simulator in sync with the continuous changes being made to the spacecraft. According to backup astronaut Walter Cunningham, "We knew that the spacecraft was, you know, in poor shape relative to what it ought to be. We felt like we could fly it, but let's face it, it just wasn't as good as it should have been for the job of flying the first manned Apollo mission."&lt;ref name="nasabio"/&gt;

NASA pressed on. In mid-January 1967, "preparations were being made for the final pre-flight tests of Spacecraft 012."&lt;ref name="nasabio"/&gt; On January 22, 1967, before returning to [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Kennedy]] to conduct the January 27 plugs-out test that ended his life, Grissom's wife, Betty, later recalled that he took a lemon from a tree in his back yard and explained that he intended to hang it on that spacecraft, although he actually hung the lemon on the simulator (a duplicate of the Apollo spacecraft).&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chariots8-7"&gt;{{cite book|title=Chariots for Apollo|authors=Brooks, Grimwood, Swenson|year=1979|accessdate=2016-04-22|chapter=Preparations for the First Manned Apollo Mission|chapterurl = http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch8-7.html|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080209003722/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/contents.html| archivedate=February 9, 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Apollo 1's planned launch on February 21, 1967, the Command Module interior caught fire and burned on January 27, 1967, during a pre-launch test on [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34|Launch Pad 34 at Cape Kennedy]]. Astronauts Grissom, White, and Chaffee, who were working inside the Command Module,  were asphyxiated. The fire's ignition source was never determined, but their deaths were attributed to a wide range of lethal hazards in the early CSM design and conditions of the test, including a pressurized 100 percent [[oxygen]] prelaunch atmosphere, wiring and plumbing flaws, flammable materials used in the cockpit and in the astronauts' flight suits, and an inward-opening hatch that could not be opened quickly in an emergency and not at all with full internal pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=NASA |work=Report of Apollo 204 Review Board |title=Findings, Determinations And Recommendations |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Apollo204/find.html |quote=No single ignition source of the fire was conclusively identified. |date=April 5, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grissom's funeral services and burial at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] were held on January 31, 1967. Dignitaries in attendance included [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], members of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], and fellow NASA astronauts, among others.

After the accident, NASA decided to give the flight the official designation of Apollo 1 and skip to Apollo 4 for the first unmanned orbital test of the CSM, counting the two unmanned suborbital tests, [[AS-201]] and [[AS-202|202]], as part of the sequence. The Apollo spacecraft problems were corrected, with [[Apollo 7]], commanded by [[Wally Schirra]], launched on October 11, 1968, more than a year after the Apollo 1 accident. The Apollo program reached its objective of successfully landing men on the Moon on July 20, 1969, with [[Apollo 11]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo1info.html|title=The Apollo 1 Tragedy|publisher=NASA|access-date=April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Dunbar, Brian |title=Apollo 7 |publisher=NASA |date=January 9, 2018|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo7.html

At the time of his death, Grissom had attained the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] and had logged a total of 4,600 hours flying time, including 3,500 hours in [[jet airplanes]].&lt;ref name="jscbio" /&gt; Some contend that Grissom could have been selected as one of the astronauts to walk on the Moon. "Deke" Slayton wrote that he had hoped for one of the original Mercury astronauts to go to the Moon, noting: "It wasn't just a cut-and-dried decision as to who should make the first steps on the Moon. If I had to select on that basis, my first choice would have been Gus, which both [[Christopher C. Kraft, Jr.|Chris Kraft]] and [[Robert R. Gilruth|Bob Gilruth]] seconded."&lt;ref&gt;Slayton, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Alan Shepard, one of the original seven NASA astronauts, would receive the honor of commanding the [[Apollo 14]] lunar landing.&lt;ref&gt;Slayton, pp. 235–37&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame]] opened in 1990, his family lent it the [[spacesuit]] worn by Grissom during [[Mercury-Redstone 4|Mercury 4]] along with other personal artifacts belonging to the astronaut.

==Film and television==
Grissom has been noted and remembered in many film and television productions. Before he became widely known as an astronaut, the film ''[[Air Cadet (1951 film)|Air Cadet]]'' (1951) starring [[Richard Long (actor)|Richard Long]] and [[Rock Hudson]] briefly featured Grissom early in the movie as a U.S. Air Force candidate for flight school at [[Randolph Air Force Base|Randolph Field]], San Antonio, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0342628}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grissom was depicted by [[Fred Ward]] in the film ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]'' (1983) and (very briefly) in the film ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'' (1995) by [[Steve Bernie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-right-stuff-1983|title=The Right Stuff|access-date=February 23, 2017|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|website=RogerEbert.com|date=March 16, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=DC Goes to the Movies: A Unique Guide to the Reel Washington|date=February 1, 2003|last1=Rosales|first1=Jean|last2=Jobe|first2=Michael|isbn=978-0-595-26797-2|publisher=Writer's Club Press|place=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43}} He was portrayed in the 1998 [[HBO]] [[miniseries]] ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'' (1998) by [[Mark Rolston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Epic Television Miniseries: A Critical History|last1=Vito|first1=John De|last2=Tropea|first2=Frank|isbn=978-0-7864-4149-5|date=2010|publisher=McFarland and Company|place=Jefferson, N.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|195}} Actor [[Kevin McCorkle]] played Grissom in the third-season finale of the [[NBC]] television show ''[[American Dreams]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0566406|name=Kevin McCorkle}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bryan Cranston]] played Grissom as a nervous variety-show guest in the film ''[[That Thing You Do!]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/leonoraepstein/9-of-bryan-cranstons-forgotten-roles|title=9 Of Bryan Cranston's Forgotten Roles|website=Buzzfeed|date=August 26, 2013|last1=Epstein|first1=Leonora|access-date=February 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2013/09/19/showbiz/emmys-2013-bryan-cranston-man-of-the-moment/index.html|title=Emmys 2013: Bryan Cranston, man of the moment|publisher=CNN|last1=Leopold|first1=Todd|date=September 19, 2013|access-date=April 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor [[Joel Johnstone]] portrays Gus Grissom in the 2015 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] TV series ''[[The Astronaut Wives Club]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2014/04/joel-johnstone-joins-abcs-the-astronaut-wives-club-rahart-adams-in-nickelodeons-every-witch-way-719988/|title=Joel Johnstone Joins ABC's 'The Astronaut Wives Club'; Rahart Adams In Nickelodeon's 'Every Witch Way'|date=April 25, 2014|access-date=February 23, 2017|website=Deadline Hollywood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HMS ''Gladiolus''''' was a {{sclass2-|Flower|corvette}} of the [[Royal Navy]], the [[lead ship|first ship of her class]].&lt;ref name=Bbc20060128&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/95/a8923395.shtml| title=Dick Turner's Wartime memories - Part 2: Wartime service after leaving H.M.S.

She was [[Keel laying|laid down]] at [[Smiths Dock Company]] on the [[River Tees]] on 19 October 1939, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 24 January 1940, and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 6 April 1940.&lt;ref name=Bbc20060128/&gt;&lt;ref name=Colledge&gt;{{cite book |last=Colledge |title=Ships of the Royal Navy |page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Gladiolus'' was active in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] in [[World War II]] and spent most of her service career on [[convoy]] escort duty in the [[North Atlantic]]. She was lost in action on 16 October 1941.

==Service history==
After commissioning and working up, ''Gladiolus'' was assigned to the [[Western Approaches Escort Force]].
In her 18 months of service she escorted over 40 convoys, of which over a dozen were attacked; ''Gladiolus'' was involved in four major convoy battles, and participated destroying three [[U-boat]]s.

She was engaged in all the duties performed by corvettes; escorting convoys, searching for and attacking U-boats which attacked ships in convoy, and rescuing survivors.

On 28 June 1940 she picked up 35 survivors from {{SS|Llanarth}}, that had been [[torpedo]]ed and sunk by [[Fritz-Julius Lemp]]'s {{GS|U-30|1936|2}}.&lt;ref name=Gladiolus&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/4761.html |title=HMS Gladiolus (K 34)|accessdate=2008-11-14|publisher=uboat.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gladiolus'' was involved in the sinking of the [[Type I U-boat]] {{GS|U-26|1936|2}} on 1 July 1940.&lt;ref name=Bbc20060128/&gt;  This was the first U-boat kill by a corvette.&lt;ref name=Humble&gt;{{cite book |last=Humble |title=Fraser of North Cape |page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''U-26'' had been heavily damaged by eight [[depth charge]]s from ''Gladiolus'', as well as bombs from a [[Short Sunderland]] aircraft, and subsequently [[Scuttling|scuttled]] herself.&lt;ref name=Gladiolus/&gt;

As one of the early Flowers ''Gladiolus'' suffered from the drawbacks of her type; a short [[forecastle]], merchant type [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]], and poor habitability. In October 1940 she went into dock for remedial work and was re-fitted with a longer foc’s’le to improve her habitability. This necessitated ballasting, to avoid pitch problems, and a tilt test, to check stability.&lt;ref name=Bbc20060128/&gt; These were satisfactory, and she returned to action in January 1941, assigned to one of the new escort groups, 2 EG, led by {{HMS|Douglas}}.

In April 1941 ''Gladiolus'' involved in the battle for HX 121. On 28 April ''Gladiolus''  was sent with the [[destroyer]]s {{HMS|Roxborough|I07|6}} and {{HMS|Leamington|G19|2}} to re-inforce HX 121 which was under attack. During the onslaught ''Gladiolus'' and the destroyers gained contact and made a series of attacks; it was subsequently shown this was on {{GS|U-96|1940|2}}, which escaped.
''Douglas'' also gained a contact and made an attack, but saw no result. On 29 April ''Gladiolus'' rescued survivors from ''Beacon Grange'' which had been torpedoed by {{GS|U-552||2}}. Later that day she sighted a U-boat on the surface and attacked, being rewarded with a gush of air bubbles and wreckage. ''Gladiolus'' was credited with destroying {{GS|U-65|1940|2}}, but post-war re-evaluation found no U-boat attacked that day, and attributed ''U-65''{{'}}s destruction to the attack by ''Douglas'' the previous day.&lt;ref&gt;Blair p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1941 HX 133 came under attack; ''Gladiolus'' was detached from escorting OB 335 to join as reinforcement.
On 24/25 June, after midnight, she sighted {{GS|U-71|1940|2}}, and attacked. She attempted to ram, but slowed to avoid major damage, and ''U-71'' dived away. ''Gladiolus'' then launched five attacks, using 30 depth charges altogether, and was joined by {{HMS|Nasturtium|K107|6}}, which launched another six. ''U-71'' was severely damaged, and surfaced to try to escape on the surface; ''Gladiolus'' and ''Nasturtium'' opened fire, scoring hits on ''U-71''{{'}}s [[conning tower]]. ''Gladiolus'' claimed a kill for this, and was credited with sinking ''U-71'', but the boat escaped to base.&lt;ref&gt;Blair p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; On 26/27 June in early hours, {{GS|U-556||2}} attacked the convoy, and was sighted by ''Nasturtium''. She attacked and was joined by {{HMS|Celandine|K75|2}} and ''Gladiolus''. Altogether the three corvettes launched 50 depth charges; ''U-556'' was forced to the surface as ''Gladiolus'' dropped a further three depth charges; the corvettes then opened fire at point-blank range, hitting ''U-556''{{'}}s conning tower. Her captain, Wohlfarth and the crew abandoned ship, and the boat sank before she could be secured.&lt;ref&gt;Blair p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kemp p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1941 ''Gladiolus'' was involved in the battle for [[Convoy SC 42|SC 42]]. Under major attack, SC 42 lost 15 ships in two days, for the destruction of one U-boat. Numerous escorts were drafted in as reinforcement; on 11 September ''Gladiolus'' arrived with EG 2, led by ''Douglas''. SC 42 was stalked for a further five days, losing two more ships, though the destroyers of EG 2 were able to sink another U-boat. This was, after [[Convoy SC 7|SC 7]], the worst convoy loss in the North Atlantic during the war.

Following this, ''Gladiolus'' was reassigned to the [[Newfoundland Escort Force|Newfoundland Local Escort Group]], led by {{HMCS|Columbia|I49|6}}. In October 1941 she was part of the escort for [[Convoy SC 48|SC 48]], during which battle ''Gladiolus'' was lost.

==Fate==
''Gladiolus'' was lost in October 1941 whilst escorting [[Convoy SC 48|SC 48]]. At the time, she was under the command of [[Lieutenant commander (Royal Navy)|Lieutenant Commander]] H. M. C. Sanders. One source&lt;ref name=Gladiolushit&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uboat.net/allies/merchants/1157.html |title=Ships hit - HMS Gladiolus (K 34)|accessdate=2008-11-14|publisher=uboat.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;
suggests she was sunk on the night of 16/17 October by a stray torpedo from {{GS|U-553||2}}, or {{GS|U-432||2}}. However Edwards&lt;ref&gt;Edwards p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; records ''Gladiolus'' had detached from SC 48 the previous night. At 2130 the night of 15/16 ''Empire Heron'' was hit, and ''Gladiolus'' was detached to search for survivors. At 2200 she signalled she had picked up one man, and was continuing to search.&lt;ref name=Coy&gt;{{cite book |last=Coy |title=The Echo of a Fighting Flower |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was her last contact; nothing more is known of her, and there were no survivors from either vessel.

'''John Wilfred Jenkinson''' (1871–1915) was a pioneer in the field of comparative [[developmental biology]] (the forerunner of [[evolutionary developmental biology]]) and one of the first to introduce experimental [[embryology]] to the UK at the start of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=AnonObit&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anonymous|title=Obituary notice: Dr J. W. Jenkinson|journal=Nature|date=1915|volume=95|page=456|doi=10.1038/095456a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goodrich1917&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goodrich|first1=E.S.|title=Obituary notice: Captain J. W. Jenkinson MA DSc|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society|date=1917|volume=89B|page=xlii-xliii}}&lt;/ref&gt; He originally studied Classics as an undergraduate student at Oxford, before switching his attention to Zoology under the guidance of [[W. F. R. Weldon]] at University College London &lt;ref name=AnonObit /&gt;&lt;ref name=Goodrich1917 /&gt;. He also travelled to Utrecht in the Netherlands, to work with Hubrecht, and was exposed to new methods and approaches in embryology. In 1905, he was appointed the first lecturer in Embryology at the [[University of Oxford]] in [[England]], and in 1909 published the first English textbook on experimental embryology &lt;ref&gt;Jenkinson, J.W. (1909) Experimental Embryology. Oxford: Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt; in which he summarized recent work in the emerging scientific discipline and criticized neo-vitalist theories of [[Hans Driesch]] &lt;ref name=Goodrich1917 /&gt;.

At the outbreak of war in 1914, Jenkinson joined the Oxford Volunteer Training Corps  &lt;ref name=Goodrich1917 /&gt;. In January 1915 he was assigned to the 12th Battalion of the Worcestershire Regiment and was soon promoted to the rank of Captain &lt;ref&gt;Marett, R.R. (1917) Biographical note. In Jenkinson, J.W. Three Lectures on Experimental Emrbyology. Oxford: Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt;. Jenkinson left England with his Regiment in May, posted to the Dardanelles in Turkey. On 4 June 1915, just days after arriving on the Gallipoli peninsula, Jenkinson was killed &lt;ref name=Goodrich1917 /&gt;. After Jenkinson's death at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] in June 1915, the University of Oxford established the '''John Wilfred Jenkinson Lectureship''' in his memory. The original statutes required the lecturer or lecturers, appointed annually, to deliver “one or more lectures or lecture demonstrations on comparative or experimental embryology” &lt;ref name=StatutesOxford&gt;Statutes and Regulations of the University of Oxford http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/statutes/354-051a.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;.

Each year, a Board of Electors selects one or two Jenkinson Lecturers who are invited to Oxford to present a lecture in the broad area of developmental biology &lt;ref name=StatutesOxford/&gt;. The list of Jenkinson Lecturers includes many distinguished names, including [[Nobel Laureates]] (marked with *).

Refer to Talk:Jeff Bezos FAQ #Q6. If there is something in the lead not cited in the main part drop a {{not found in body}} citation needed tag and it will be addressed.  --&gt;

Bezos was born in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], and raised in [[Houston, Texas]]. He graduated from [[Princeton University]] in 1986 with degrees in electrical engineering and computer science. He worked on [[Wall Street]] in a variety of related fields from 1986 to early 1994. He founded Amazon in late 1994 on a cross-country road trip from [[New York City]] to [[Seattle]]. The company began as an online bookstore and has expanded to a variety of products and services, including video and audio streaming. It is currently the world's largest online sales company, as well as the world's largest provider of cloud infrastructure services via its [[Amazon Web Services]] arm.

Bezos added to his business interests when he founded [[aerospace]] company [[Blue Origin]] in 2000. A Blue Origin test flight successfully first reached [[Outer space|space]] in 2015, and Blue has plans to begin commercial [[Sub-orbital spaceflight|suborbital]] [[human spaceflight]] as early as late 2018. He purchased ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in 2013 for {{US$|250&amp;nbsp;million|link=yes}} in cash. Bezos manages other business investments through his venture capital fund, [[Jeff Bezos#Bezos Expeditions|Bezos Expeditions]].&lt;!-- Do not change 4th paragraph until you reference the wealth section below in the body and Talk:Jeff Bezos FAQ #Q2.  --&gt;

On July 27, 2017, he became the [[The World's Billionaires|world's wealthiest person]] when his estimated [[net worth]] increased to just over $90&amp;nbsp;billion. Bezos's wealth surpassed $100&amp;nbsp;billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, and he was formally designated the wealthiest person in the world by ''[[Forbes]]'' on March 6, 2018, with a net worth of $112&amp;nbsp;billion. The first [[Billionaire|centi-billionaire]] on the ''Forbes'' wealth index, he was named the "richest man in modern history" after his net worth increased to $150&amp;nbsp;billion in July 2018.

== Early life ==
Bezos was born Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen on January 12, 1964, in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], the son of Jacklyn Gise Jorgensen and [[Chicago]] native Ted Jorgensen.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (2010), pp. 14, 100&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his birth, his mother was a 17-year-old high school student, and his father was a bike shop owner.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (2010), pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; After Jacklyn divorced Ted, she married Cuban immigrant Miguel "Mike" Bezos in April 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (2010), p. 14, 18&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the wedding, Mike adopted four-year-old Jorgensen, whose surname was then changed to Bezos.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (2010), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to [[Houston, Texas]], where Mike worked as an engineer for [[Exxon]] after he received a degree from the [[University of New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Robinson 2010, p. 17"&gt;Robinson (2010), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Bezos attended [[River Oaks Elementary School (Houston)|River Oaks Elementary School]] in Houston from fourth to sixth grade.&lt;ref name="Robinson 2010, p. 18"&gt;Robinson (2010), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

}}Bezos used what he called a "regret-minimization framework" while he worked at [[D. E. Shaw &amp; Co.|D.&amp;nbsp;E.

No. Will I regret missing the beginning of the Internet? Yes."&lt;ref name="wired.com" /&gt; During the 1990s and early 2000s at Amazon, he was characterized as trying to quantify all aspects of running the company, often listing employees on spreadsheets and basing executive decisions on data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/50541/inside-mind-jeff-bezos-4 |title=Inside the Mind of Jeff Bezos |last=Deutschman |first=Alan |date=August 1, 2004 |work=Fast Company|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url= |accessdate=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To push Amazon forward, Bezos developed the [[mantra]] "Get Big Fast", which spoke to the company's need to [[Economies of scale|scale]] its operations and establish market dominance.&lt;ref name="Amazon.com {{!}} History &amp; Facts" /&gt; He favored diverting Amazon profits back into the company in lieu of allocating it amongst shareholders in the form of [[dividend]]s.&lt;ref name="fastcompany.com" /&gt;

'''Jeongjong of Goryeo''' (923 – 13 April 949) (r. 945–949) was the third [[monarch]] of the [[Goryeo]] dynasty of [[Korea]]. He was the third son of [[Taejo of Goryeo|King Taejo]], the founder of the kingdom, and was born more than a decade before Goryeo was formally established. His mother was the daughter of a noble from the [[Chungju]] region, [[Yu Geung-dal]].

Jeongjong rose to the throne after his half-brother [[Hyejong of Goryeo|King Hyejong]], and set to reducing the power of various royal in-laws, including [[Wang Gyu]] and [[Pak Sul-hui]]. However, lacking the support of the [[Kaesong|Gaegyeong]] elites, he was unable to substantially strengthen the throne.

In 946, he spent 70,000 sacks of grain from the royal storehouses to support [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhism]] in the country. In 947, he had the fortress of [[Pyongyang]] constructed as the country's Western Capital. He sought to move the capital from Gaegyeong to Pyongyang, but was not successful.

== Prominent species ==
There are about eighteen edible species in Laminariaceae and most of them, but not all, are called kombu. Confusingly, species of Laminariaceae have multiple names in [[biology]] and in [[fisheries science]]. In the following list, fisheries science synonyms are in parentheses, and Japanese names follow them.

== Etymology ==
Kombu is a [[loanword]] from [[Japanese language]].

In Old Japanese, edible seaweed was generically called "''me''" (cf. [[wakame]], [[arame]]) and [[kanji]] such as "軍布",&lt;ref&gt;[[Man'yōshū]] and wood strips from [[Fujiwara-kyō]]. Between late 7th and early 8th century&lt;/ref&gt; 海藻&lt;ref&gt;{{Interlanguage link multi|Shōsōin Monjo|ja|3=正倉院文書}}　(documents of [[Shōsōin]]; 8th century) and [[Fudoki]].&lt;/ref&gt; or "和布"&lt;ref&gt;色葉字類抄 ({{Interlanguage link multi|Iroha Jirui Shō|ja|3=色葉字類抄}}); the vocabulary of Japanese and Chinese. Middle or late 12th century.&lt;/ref&gt; were applied to transcribe the word. Especially, kombu was called ''hirome'' (from ''hiroi'', wide) or ''ebisume'' (from [[Emishi|''ebisu'']]).&lt;ref&gt;本草和名 ({{Interlanguage link multi|Honzō Wamyō|ja|3=本草和名}}) ; the oldest surviving dictionary of medicine in Japan. Early 10th century.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometime later the names ''konfu'' and ''kofu'' appeared respectively in two editions of Iroha Jirui Shō in 12th–13th century.&lt;ref&gt;The latter is revised and enlarged edition 伊呂波字類抄 (Iroha Jirui Shō). 13th century.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various theories have been claimed for the origin of the name kombu, with the following two predominant today.

One is that it originated from the [[Kanji#On.27yomi .28Chinese reading.29|On'yomi]] ([[Kanji|Sino-Japanese]] reading) of the Chinese name 昆布 (kūnbù).&lt;ref&gt;谷川士清 ({{Interlanguage link multi|Tanikawa Kotosuga|ja|3=谷川士清}}) et al., 和訓栞 (Wakun no Shiori). 1777–1899.&lt;/ref&gt; The kanji itself already could be seen in Shōsōin Monjo (8th century) and [[Shoku Nihongi]] (797) in Japan, and furthermore trace back in China, as early as 3rd century, to the book ''Wupu Bencao'' (around 239).&lt;ref&gt;吳普本草 (Wupu Bencao) is the Chinese materia medica work written by　Wupu.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Li Shizhen]] wrote the following in his [[Bencao Gangmu]] (1596):

{{quotation|Come to think about it, Wupu Bencao says "綸布 (gūanbù), alias 昆布 (kūnbù)." Then, what is mentioned in the [[Erya]] as "(what is pronounced) 綸 resembles 綸.  This is in the [[East China Sea]]" kūnbù.  The pronouciation of 綸 is 関 (gūan), meaning cord made by blue thread, and got corrupted to 昆 (kūn).|Li Shizhen, ''Bencao Gangmu''&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E6%9C%AC%E8%8D%89%E7%B6%B1%E7%9B%AE/%E8%8D%89%E4%B9%8B%E5%85%AB Li Shizhen, ''Bencao Gangmu'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another possibility to explain the association arises because descriptions of kūnbù in Chinese documents are vague and inconsistent, and it is impossible to identify to which seaweed the term might have applied.  For instance, Chen Cangqi (681–757) noted: "kūnbù is produced in the [[South China Sea]]; its leaf is like a hand and the size is the same as a [[Miscanthus sinensis|silver grass]] and a [[Reed (plant)|reed]], is of red purple; the thin part of leaf is seaweed",&lt;ref name="Li" /&gt; which is similar to wakame, arame, kurome, or kajime (''Ecklonia cava''). The difficulty is that, at least in that time, kombu was not produced either in the East nor in the South China Sea.  Moreover, following Zhang Yxi, Li Shizhen classified kūnbù and haidai (stands for kombu in Chinese) as different things,&lt;ref name="Li" /&gt; and this classification continues in China today.&lt;ref&gt;Wang Cheyueh 王者悅 (ed.), 中国药膳大辞典 (Chinese Medicated Diet Dictionary), Dalian, Dalian Publishing House, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second possibility of origin is that the word originated from '''''kompu''''', standing for kombu in the [[Ainu language]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ōtsuki Fumihiko]] et al., {{Interlanguage link multi|Daigenkai|ja|3=大言海}}. Tokyo, Fuzanbō, 1932–1937.&lt;/ref&gt; Kompu in Ainu quite resembles gūanbù or kūnbù in Chinese, and it is possible to speculate that one is a loanword from the other.

== History ==
"Qūan resembles 綸 (lace, cord or rope). This is in the East China Sea."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctext.org/er-ya/shi-cao#n38782 爾雅 (The Erya) 釋草(Commentaries on Grasses)]&lt;/ref&gt; from the Erya (3rd–2nd century BC) and "Gūanbù, alias kūnbù" from the Wupu Bencao (3rd century).  [[Tao Hongjing]] (456–536) noted kūnbù is edible.&lt;ref name="Li" /&gt;  As previously mentioned, however, kūnbù can not be identified with kombu. Zhang Yuxi referred to haidai in the book 嘉祐補註神農本草 (1060).&lt;ref name="Li" /&gt;

Although archaeological evidence of seaweed is hard to find because of its easy decomposition, some plant remains of wakame seaweed are found in some ruins of the [[Jōmon Period]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hijiki.org/html/content02.htm 日本ひじき協議会 (Japan Hijiki Council)]&lt;/ref&gt; which leads to the supposition that kombu was also eaten at that time. As to surviving documents, the letters 軍布 (In Sino-Japanese reading 軍 is gun/kun ; 布 is fu/pu/bu) appeared in Man'yōshū and wood strips from Fujiwara-kyō,  and may have indicated kombu. The Shoku Nihongi(797) reports: in 797 {{Interlanguage link multi|Suga no Komahiru|ja|3=須賀古麻比留}} of [[Emishi]] (Ainu or Tohoku region people) stated they had been offering up kombu, which grew there, as tribute to the [[Yamato period#The Yamato state|Yamato court]] every year without fail. The [[Engishiki]] (927) also reports that kombu had been offered up by [[Mutsu Province|Mutsu]].

During the [[Muromachi period]], a newly developed drying technique allowed kombu to be stored for more than a few days, and it became an important export from the Tohoku area.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  By the [[Edo period]], as Hokkaidō was colonized and shipment routes were organized, the use of ''kombu'' became widespread throughout Japan.  Traditional [[Okinawan cuisine]] relies heavily on ''kombu'' as a part of the diet; this practice began in the Edo period.  Okinawa uses more ''kombu'' per household than any other prefecture. In the 20th century, a way to cultivate kombu was discovered and it became cheap and readily available.

In 1867, the word "kombu" first appeared in an English-language publication—''A Japanese and English Dictionary'' by [[James Curtis Hepburn]].

Since the 1960s, dried ''kombu'' has been exported from Japan to many countries. It was available initially at Asian, and especially Japanese, food shops and restaurants, and can be found in supermarkets, health-food stores, and other nonspecializing suppliers.

== Cooking ==

=== Japan ===
Kombu is sold dried (''dashi konbu'') or pickled in vinegar (''su konbu'') or as a dried shred (''oboro konbu'',''tororo konbu'' or ''shiraga konbu''). It may also be eaten fresh in ''[[sashimi]]''.

Kombu is used extensively in [[Japanese cuisine]]s as one of the three main ingredients needed to make ''[[dashi]]'', a soup stock. ''Konbu dashi'' is made by putting either whole dried or powdered kombu in cold water and heating it to near-boiling. The softened kombu is commonly eaten after cooking or is sliced and used to make ''[[tsukudani]]'', a dish that is simmered in soy sauce and ''[[mirin]]''.

Kombu may be pickled with sweet-and-sour flavoring, cut into small strips about 5 or 6&amp;nbsp;cm long and 2&amp;nbsp;cm wide. These are often eaten as a snack with [[green tea]]. It is often included when cooking beans, putatively to add nutrients and improve their digestibility.

''[[Konbu-cha]]'' or ''kobu-cha'' ({{lang|ja-Hani|昆布茶}}) is a tea made by infusing kombu in hot water.  What Americans call [[kombucha]] is called "kocha kinoko" in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wong |first=Crystal |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2007/07/12/national/u-s-kombucha-smelly-and-no-kelp/ |title=U.S. 'kombucha': Smelly and No Kelp |work=Japan Times |date=12 July 2007 |accessdate=14 June 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kombu is also used to prepare a seasoning for rice to be made into [[sushi]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Nutrition and health effects ==
''Kombu'' is a good source of [[glutamic acid]], an amino acid responsible for [[umami]] (the Japanese word used for a [[taste#Basic tastes|basic taste]] identified in 1908). Several foodstuffs in addition to ''kombu'' provide glutamic acid or [[glutamate]]s.

''Kombu'' contains extremely high levels of [[iodine]]. While this mineral is essential for normal growth and development, the levels in kombu can cause overdoses; it has been blamed for thyroid problems after drinking large amounts of soy milk in which ''kombu'' was an additive.&lt;ref name="RACGP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racgp.org.au/healthalerts/35472 |title=RACGP Health alert – high levels of iodine in BonSoy soy milk |author= |date=24 December 2009 |website= |publisher=Royal Australian College of General Practitioners |accessdate=3 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818205757/http://www.racgp.org.au/healthalerts/35472 |archivedate=August 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is also a source of [[dietary fiber]].  Algae including kombu also contain entire families&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X14000815 | doi=10.1016/j.sbi.2014.07.009 | volume=28 | title=A sweet new wave: structures and mechanisms of enzymes that digest polysaccharides from marine algae | journal=Current Opinion in Structural Biology | pages=77–86 | pmid=25136767 | last1 = Hehemann | first1 = JH | last2 = Boraston | first2 = AB | last3 = Czjzek | first3 = M| year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of obscure enzymes that break down complex sugars that are normally indigestible to the human gut (thus gas-causing), including the well-studied [[alpha-galactosidase]] and [[beta-galactosidase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1134/S0026261712060033 | volume=81 | issue=6 | title=Diversity of glycosidase activities in the bacteria of the phylum Bacteroidetes isolated from marine algae | journal=Microbiology | pages=688–695| year=2012 | last1=Bakunina | first1=I.

'''Mereological essentialism''' is a philosophical thesis about the relationship between wholes, their parts, and the conditions of their persistence. According to mereological essentialism, objects have their parts necessarily. If an object were to lose or gain a part, it would cease to exist; it would no longer be the original object but a new and different one.

== Definition ==
Mereological essentialism requires elaboration. To what types of objects (abstract or concrete) does mereological essentialism apply? Usually, mereological essentialism is taken to be a thesis about concrete material objects, but it may also be applied to a [[set (mathematics)|set]] or  proposition. If mereological essentialism is correct, a [[proposition]], or thought, has its parts essentially; the concepts that make up the proposition are essential to it.

In the case of material concrete objects, mereological essentialism can be true in different senses depending on how objects are thought to persist through time. The two prominent, competing models are [[endurantism]] and [[perdurantism]]. It is important to note that neither endurantism nor perdurantism imply mereological essentialism.  One can be an advocate for either model without being committed to accepting mereological essentialism.  Within an endurantist framework, objects are extended within space; they are collections of spatial parts.  Objects persist through change (or endure) by being wholly present at every instant of time. According to mereological essentialism, enduring objects have only their spatial parts essentially. Within a perdurantist framework, objects are extended through space-time; they have parts in both space and time. Under a framework that combines mereological essentialism and perdurantism, objects have both their [[temporal parts]] and spatial parts essentially.

What does it mean for an object to have something essentially? Essentiality can be explained by referencing necessity and/or possible worlds. Mereological essentialism is then the thesis that objects have their parts necessarily or objects have their parts in every possible world in which the object exists.  In other words, an object X composed of parts a, b, c and d ceases to exist if it loses part d.  Additionally, X ceases to exist if it gains a new part e.

== Contenders ==
Mereological essentialism is a position defended in the debate regarding material constitution. What is the relationship between a statue and the lump of clay from which it is made? Several different answers have been proposed. Coincidentalism is the view that the statue and the lump of clay are two objects located at the same place. The lump of clay should be distinguished from the statue because they have different persistence conditions. The lump would not survive the loss of a bit of clay, but the statue would. The statue would not survive being squashed into a ball, but the lump of clay would.

== Defenders ==
The following philosophers have thought mereological essentialism to be true:

Pre-20th century: [[Peter Abelard]]; [[Gottfried Leibniz]]

20th century: [[G.E. Moore]]; [[Roderick Chisholm]]; James Van Cleve

21st century: Michael Jubien; Mark Heller

Chrisholm and van Cleve consider objects as enduring. Michael Jubien and Mark Heller defend mereological essentialism for perduring objects.

== Arguments for ==
There are several arguments for mereological essentialism. Some are more formal; others use mereological essentialism as a solution to various philosophical puzzles or paradoxes. (This approach is mentioned in Olson (2006).)

=== The argument from bad alternatives ===
What would be the opposite of mereological essentialism? It would be that objects would survive the loss of any part.  We can call this mereological inessentialism. But mereological inessentialism means that a table would survive replacement or loss of any of its parts. By successive replacement we could change the parts of the table so in the end it would look like a chair. This is a version of a [[Sorites paradox]]. Because it is difficult to justify a clearly defined point at which the table is destroyed and replaced by the chair, the best solution to this puzzle may be mereological essentialism (Chisholm 1973).

=== "Deon and Theon" argument ===
Imagine a person called Deon. He has a proper part, his foot. One day he loses his foot. The resulting entity is then known as Theon.  But it seems that Theon existed when Deon existed by being a proper part of Deon. Did Deon survive? If he did, then Deon and Theon must be identical.  But Theon is a proper part of Deon. This is paradoxical.

One way to solve this puzzle is to deny that Deon has any proper parts. Defending this view is rejecting the principle of arbitrary undetached parts (Van Inwagen 1981). It means that a cup in front of you doesn't have a left part, a right part, a part where the ear of the cup is or a part where the coffee is stored (if the hole of the cup is a part of the cup).

=== A world made only of stuff ===
Some philosophers reject the existence of individual objects. The world does not contain single, individuable objects which we can use logic to quantify. Instead the world only contains stuff, or masses of [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]] which come in different quantities. We have for instance a gram of gold. There is a grammatical difference between stuff and things. We cannot say, take a gold, but must say a lump of gold (Simons 1987). Our standard way of quantifying is at most a way for the mind to project thinghood onto the world. If the world is made only of stuff, mereological essentialism must be true.

The argument from a world made only of stuff was first noted by van Cleve (1986). Defenders of a stuff ontology are Michael Jubien (1993) and Mark Heller (1990).

== Arguments against ==
Because mereology is a new branch of [[formal system]]s, clear arguments against mereological essentialism have not yet been raised. The most common counterargument is that mereological essentialism [[logical consequence|entails]] that an object which undergoes a subtle change is not the same object. This seems to be directly contrary to common sense. For example, if my car gets a flat tire and I then replace the tire, mereological essentialism entails that it is not the same car.

=== The argument from a paradigmatic example ===
The most common argument against mereological essentialism is the view that it cannot be universally true. Take us, for example. As [[humans]], which are [[living organisms]], we survive by having our parts replaced by [[metabolism|metabolic processes]] or even [[organ transplantation]]. We might have our hair or fingernails cut. All of these procedures do not seem to cause the nonexistence of the person or, for that matter, the nonexistence of any living organism. Therefore, mereological essentialism cannot be universally true (Plantinga 1975).

This argument may fail if the mereological essentialist believes in [[presentism (philosophy of time)|presentism]], that the present is the only relevantly true world. This view is a response to the problem of Qualitative Change.

'''Monica Zetterlund''' (born '''Eva Monica Nilsson'''; 20 September 1937&amp;nbsp;– 12 May 2005) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] singer and actress.

==Biography==
Zetterlund began by learning the classic jazz songs from radio and records, initially not knowing the language and what they sang about in English. Her hit songs included "Sakta vi gå genom stan" (Swedish cover of "[[Walkin' My Baby Back Home (song)|Walking My Baby Back Home]]"; in Swedish a tribute to [[Stockholm]] town), "[[Visa från Utanmyra]]", "Sista jäntan", "Trubbel", "Gröna små äpplen" ("[[Little Green Apples]]"), "Monicas vals" ("[[Waltz for Debby (song)|Waltz for Debby]]"), "Stick iväg, Jack!" ("[[Hit the Road Jack]]"), "Att angöra en brygga", "Var blev ni av", "Måne över Stureplan" (cover of [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]'s "Moon Over Bourbon Street") and "Under vinrankan!", among many, many others.

She also interpreted the works of such Swedish singer-songwriters as [[Evert Taube]], [[Olle Adolphson]] and [[Povel Ramel]], and all through her life interpreted the works of international and American jazz musicians/songwriters. She worked with some of the greatest international jazz names including [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Bill Evans]], [[Stan Getz]], [[Steve Kuhn]] and [[Quincy Jones]], and in the [[Scandinavia]]n jazz world with people like [[Georg Riedel (Swedish jazz musician)|Georg Riedel]], [[Egil Johansen (musician)|Egil Johansen]], [[Arne Domnérus]], [[Svend Asmussen]] and [[Jan Johansson (jazz musician)|Jan Johansson]].&lt;ref name="NYT2005"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/14/arts/music/14zetterlund.html|title=Monica Zetterlund, 67, Singer and Actress, Dies|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=14 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, she recorded the critically acclaimed jazz album ''[[Waltz for Debby (1964 album)|Waltz for Debby]]'' with [[Bill Evans]], a record she herself described as "the best I've done"{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} and was the most proud of. Her professional skill was amply demonstrated in this album in performing the challenging Harold Arlen song, "So Long, Big Time". 

Her long career also included the song "[[En gång i Stockholm]]" ("Winter City"); a jazz ballad with which she represented Sweden in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1963|1963 Eurovision Song Contest]]. She finished last, however (mainly because the song genre was not suitable for the competition){{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} and scored the infamous ''nul points'', but still managed to remain successful in Sweden. Her collaboration with the comic duo [[Hasse &amp; Tage]] (in the 1960s and 1970s) eventually led to a stage career in revues and films. Memorable are her parts in films ''[[Att angöra en brygga]]'' and ''[[Äppelkriget]]'', with her most memorable role being in [[Jan Troell]]'s ''Utvandrarna'' (aka ''[[The Emigrants (film)|The Emigrants]]''; with [[Liv Ullmann]] and [[Max von Sydow]] in the leads) as Ulrika, a former prostitute who together with her teenage daughter Elin (portrayed by Zetterlund's daughter, Eva Lena Zetterlund) join the main characters in their emigration to America in the 1850s, a role for which Zetterlund received a [[Guldbagge Award]] for Best Supporting Actress.&lt;ref name="8thGuldbagge"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfi.se/en-GB/Swedish-film-database/Item/?type=MOVIE&amp;itemid=4883&amp;iv=Awards |title=Äppelkriget (1971) |publisher=Swedish Film Institute |date=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared in more than 20 films and television series throughout her life.&lt;ref name="NYT2005" /&gt;

==Health and death==
She suffered from severe [[scoliosis]] which began after a childhood accident, and as a result was forced to retire from performing in 1999.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

On 12 May 2005, she died following an accidental fire in her [[apartment]] in [[Stockholm]], probably due to her habit of smoking in bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article10595268.ab|title=Sångerskan Monica Zetterlund död|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressen.se/noje/monica-zetterlund-dog-isolerad-i-sitt-hem/|title=Monica Zetterlund dog isolerad i sitt hem|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Natalia Alexeievna, Tsarevna of Russia''' (25 June 1755 – 15 April 1776) was the first wife of [[Paul I of Russia|Paul Petrovich, Tsarevich of Russia]] (future Tsar Paul I), son of the [[Empress Catherine II]]. She was born as '''Princess Wilhelmina Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt''' in [[Prenzlau]], [[Uckermark]], [[Brandenburg]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] as the fifth child of [[Louis IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt]] and his spouse [[Countess Palatine Caroline of Zweibrücken]].

==Journey to Russia==
In 1773, the Empress Catherine II of Russia was looking for a suitable wife for her son Paul and turned to King [[Frederick II of Prussia]] for "recommendations". The King thought about the remaining three unmarried daughters of the Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt. Their eldest sister [[Frederika Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt|Frederica]] was married to the heir to Prussian throne and so, an alliance to Prussia would be a beneficial outcome. Unable to decide which one was worthy, the Empress sent an invitation to Wilhelmine, her sisters [[Landgravine Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt|Amalie]] and [[Luise Auguste of Hesse-Darmstadt|Louise]], and their mother to visit Russia. Hurriedly, the three Princesses studied to perfect their French, worked on their dancing, practiced dropping deep curtseys, and completed their wardrobes. Their first stop was in Berlin where from there a flotilla of four ships, sent by the Empress Catherine, took them to Russia. It was the Grand Duke Paul's best friend, young [[Andrei Razumovsky]], who commanded the frigate that carried the young ladies and their mother. He was immediately captivated by these charming passengers, and was particularly taken with Wilhelmine. She was not insensible to the admiration of Andrei.

[[File:Natalia_Alexeievna_by_anonimous_%281770s%2C_Lugansk%29.jpg|thumb|left| An anonymous portrait of Wilhelmine Louise of Hesse-Darmstadt, soon to be the Tsesarevna of Russia.]]

Two days after arriving in Russia, the Grand Duke Paul chose Wilhelmine to be his wife. Wilhelmine was very pretty, gay and exuberant, and Paul was very delighted with her. Their betrothal was celebrated with great ostentation and Wilhelmine changed her religion and her given name: she became Natalia Alexeievna. On 29 September 1773, the wedding took place in the church of the Nativity of the Mother of God.

== Tsesarevna ==
During the first few months of her marriage, Natalia's gaiety and spontaneity animated the whole court. The Empress was delighted with her initially, but as time passed difficulties started to appear. Paul and Natalia's marriage was a failure. Paul's mother wrote that Natalia "loves extremes in all things. She will listen to no advice, and I see in her neither charm, nor wit, nor reason." Natalia refused to learn Russian and schemed to help Paul win the throne. She felt such a need to accede to power because of her disappointment in her life as a woman, and also disappointment with her husband. She fell in love with the charming Andrei Razumovsky and the two started an affair. Unfortunately for Natalia, the whole court knew of her infidelities. Andrei was supposed to be sent away from the palace but Paul, who knew nothing of the situation, protested against his best friend's departure. At the same time, Natalia was pregnant, and Catherine didn't seem to care if the child was Paul's or Andrei's. Natalia was carrying the heir to the Russian throne, and for Catherine, that was all that mattered.

[[File:Natalia_Alexeievna_by_A.Roslin_%281776%2C_Hermitage%29.jpg|thumb|left| Grand Duchess Natalia portrayed the year of her death, by [[Alexander Roslin]]]]

==Death==
Natalia finally delivered a stillborn son, after a long and painful labour, on 15 April 1776. The infant was enormous and although it was impossible for Natalia to safely deliver the child, the court doctors did not perform a Caesarian. Shortly after the delivery, Natalia died. Her husband, Paul, was mad with grief and insisted on keeping her with him. The Chevalier de Corberon questioned the surgeon Moreau during a dinner, and he wrote, ''"He [Moreau] told me privately that in his opinion, the surgeons and doctors of the court were asses. The Grand Duchess should never have died. In truth, it is very surprising that greater care is not taken in advance with a Grand Duchess. The people are very angry, weeping and bitter. Yesterday and today, people in shops were heard to say, 'The young ladies die; the old babas never die.'"'' 'Old babas' (old women) was an allusion to Empress Catherine II.

Father '''Nicholas Sheehy''' (1728–1766) was an 18th-century [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Roman Catholic]] priest who was executed on charge of accessory to murder. Father Sheehy was a prominent and vocal opponent of the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]], which disenfranchised and persecuted Catholics in Ireland. His conviction is widely regarded as an act of [[judicial murder]] amongst supporters of Irish rebellion.

== Family ==
His birthplace is the subject of debate but there a belief that Nicholas Sheehy was born in [[Fethard, County Tipperary|Fethard]], Ireland, near [[Clonmel]] and grew up in a house near Newcastle on the [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] and [[Waterford]] border. His father was Francis, son of John of Drumcollogher.

Nicholas Sheehy had a sister, Catherine (married as Catherine Burke), who later erected his gravestone. He also had a sister, Mrs Green.&lt;ref&gt;Madden, R.R., ''The United Irishmen - Their Lives and Times,'' 1843&lt;/ref&gt;   Nicholas had a cousin (Edmund Buck), who was hanged in 1776 at Clogheen on the same charges.

== Education, career and opposition to Penal Laws ==
Nicholas Sheehy was possibly educated in France. His training for the priesthood was at the Irish College in Salamanca.&lt;ref&gt;Irish College Archives, Salamanca&lt;/ref&gt; and, following a time as curate at Newcastle, County Tipperary,  became the parish priest for Shanrahan, Ballysheehan, and Templetenny, County Tipperary.

During this time, [[famine]] caused much suffering and death in Ireland. It is estimated that over 400,000 perished from malnutrition.&lt;ref name="waterfordcountymuseum.org"&gt;[http://www.waterfordcountymuseum.org/exhibit/web/Display/article/194/7/?lang=en The Roman Catholic Church – Waterford County Museum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720183255/http://www.waterfordcountymuseum.org/exhibit/web/Display/article/194/7/?lang=en |date=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Adding to the social unrest was a rumour that the Catholic French would invade Ireland.&lt;ref name=Cusack&gt;[http://www.libraryireland.com/HistoryIreland/Father-Nicholas-Sheehy.php Cusack, Margaret Anne. "Father Nicholas Sheehy", ''An Illustrated History of Ireland'', 1868]&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this concern stemmed from the emigration of Irish soldiers who had left for France after the [[Treaty of Limerick]] known as the [[Flight of the Wild Geese]]. The concern was that these Irish would lobby the French monarch to support the Catholics in Ireland. This led to new persecutions of Catholic Irish and their priests.

Sheehy spoke out against the [[Penal Laws]], the [[eviction]] of poor [[tenants]] by [[Anglo-Irish]] [[landlords]], the elimination of [[common land]] by enclosure, and compulsory [[tithe]]s. These tithes were due to the [[Protestant]] [[Church of Ireland]] and its clergy. To anyone who would not or could not pay, the tithes were often seized by force and given to the local Protestant minister. Father Sheehy believed that this practice was unjust since they were levied on impoverished Catholics to benefit the wealthiest.

== Accusations and trials ==
[[File:MADDEN(1888) p103 LIBERLIP, THE PRIEST KILLER.jpg|thumb|right|On 2 April 1761 a force of 50 militia men and 40 soldiers set out for Tallow ...]]

=== First trial (conspiracy against the State) ===
Sheehy's beliefs led him into conflict with local Protestant leaders around Clonmel. In time, he was accused of conspiracy against the State (for involvement in a [[Whiteboys]] riot that destroyed a wall that prevented access to [[common land]] near Clogheen). After a trial in Dublin the accused was acquitted.&lt;ref name=Cusack/&gt;

=== New allegations ===
Following his acquittal, Sheehy was accused of involvement in the disappearance or murder of an informer. A reward of £50 was offered by the government for allegations that led to conviction in this case. Father Sheehy went into hiding at this time.

=== Second trial (High Treason) ===

In 1764, the government issued a Proclamation and offered £300 reward for the capture of Sheehy. When he read the Proclamation, Sheehy wrote from one of his hiding places to [[Thomas Waite (Under-Secretary for Ireland)]] and offered to surrender only if he would be tried in Dublin. The offer was accepted and the trial took place on 10 February 1766, when he was acquitted of [[High Treason]].

Immediately after his acquittal, Sheehy was charged with murder.

=== Third trial (accessory to murder) and death sentence ===

On 12 March 1766, Sheehy was tried at [[Main Guard (Clonmel)|Clonmel Main Guard]] for being an [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory]] in the murder of John Bridge. The judge [[Richard Clayton (Irish judge)]] had the reputation of an honest and humane man, but he had arrived in Ireland only the previous year and seems to have been quite unaware of the political background to the trial.

Many of the witnesses who had previously testified against Sheehy also testified in this trial, in addition to Mrs. Mary Brady (Moll Dunlea), an "abandoned character".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-1ICAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PR27&amp;dq=Moll+Dunlea+%22abandoned+character%22 Introduction xxvii ''The United Irishmen, Their Lives and Times'' By Richard Robert Madden]&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence was widely considered as fabricated by local [[Anglo-Irish]] landowners and the [[Anglican]] [[Vicar]] of Clogheen in south County Tipperary.

Evidence was presented in favour of Sheehy, that he was "a respectable man and a man of property" by a Mr Keating, who said that Father Sheehy was in his house at the time of the murder. Mr Keating's testimony was dismissed in court by a Protestant clergyman (Mr Hewitson), who declared Keating was unreliable. Mr Keating was then arrested and sent to Kilkenny Gaol based on Mr Hewitson's allegations to frustrate his giving evidence. Although the judge was later much criticised for his conduct of the trial, it has been argued that his summing up was actually favourable to the accused.

Sheehy was convicted and sentenced to be [[hanged, drawn and quartered]]. He asserted his innocence before his death of all the charges made against him. He said in his final speech, after sentenced to death, that he was being put to death for a crime which had never been committed; the murder victim (John Bridge) was alleged to be in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] after the date of the "crime" and it is thought that he emigrated to [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]].

Sheehy's attorney, on hearing the sentence of death, said to the judge, magistrates and jurors, "If there is any justice in heaven, you will die roaring.".&lt;ref name="waterfordcountymuseum.org"/&gt;

== Execution ==
In 1766, Father Sheehy was [[Hanged drawn and quartered|hanged, drawn and quartered]] at [[Clonmel]] on 15 March 1766.

Others accused were also convicted for the murder of John Bridge and executed (3 May 1766), including Edmond Sheehy, cousin to the priest.

Father Sheehy was hanged on a scaffold in Clonmel opposite St. Peters and Paul's Church, where there was a plaque to commemorate his death. His head was severed and stuck on a spike over [[Clonmel Gaol]] as a warning against agrarian violence. His head remained above the porch at Clonmel jail for ten or twenty&lt;ref name="waterfordcountymuseum.org"/&gt; years.

His sister Catherine regularly visited the jail and was eventually given the head. She took it home in a bag under her arm and had it buried with the rest of his body beside the ruins of the old church of [[Shanrahan]].

== Legacy ==
To this day, Father Sheehy is regarded as a martyr. In the late 19th century and early 20th century there was an effort to have him canonised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/CoTipperary/2002-11/1036801889 RootsWeb: CoTipperary-L Edward Meehan, companion of Fr. Nicholas Sheehy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

His trial and execution inflamed and polarised nationalist opinion, and had a great effect on his cousin [[Edmund Burke]].

People visited his grave at Shanrahan cemetery near Clogheen to take clay, because it was rumoured to have healing powers. It is claimed that out of respect, birds didn't peck his head for the twenty years it was left on the spike.

[[File:Plot "E", Oise-Aisne American Cemetery.jpg|thumb|right|View across Plot "E", [[Oise-Aisne American Cemetery and Memorial|Oise-Aisne American Cemetery]], France]]

The '''Oise-Aisne American Cemetery Plot E''' is the fifth plot at the [[Oise-Aisne American Cemetery and Memorial]], an American military cemetery in northern France that comprises four main burial plots (i.e., A, B, C and D) containing the remains of 6,012 service personnel, all of whom died during [[World War I]].&lt;!--ALL GRAVES IN THE MAIN CEMETERY DATE FROM WORLD WAR 1. ONLY GRAVES IN PLOT E ARE FROM WW2.!--&gt;&lt;ref name="oasource"&gt;[http://www.abmc.gov/cemeteries-memorials/europe/oise-aisne-american-cemetery American Battle Monuments Commission: Oise-Aisne American Cemetery Official Website] As of June 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Plot E is approximately 100&amp;nbsp;metres away from the main cemetery and is a separate, hidden section which currently contains the remains of 96 American military prisoners, all of whom were [[death penalty|executed]] by [[hanging]] or [[firing squad]] under military authority for crimes committed during or shortly after [[World War II]]. Their victims were 26 fellow American soldiers (all murdered) and 71 [[UK|British]], [[France|French]], [[Germany|German]], [[Italy|Italian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcall.com/news/local/mc-schmiedel-war-deserter-gangster-20150711-story.html|title=Lehigh County soldier was hanged for murder in World War II|first=David|last=Venditta|publisher=|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poland|Polish]] and [[Algeria]]n civilians (both male and female) who were raped or murdered.

In total, the [[US Army]] executed 98 servicemen following General Courts Martial (GCM) for murder and/or rape in the European Theatre of Operations during the [[Second World War]]. The remains of these servicemen were originally buried near the site of their executions, which took place in countries as far apart as England, France, Belgium, Germany, Italy and Algeria. In 1949, the remains of these men were re-interred in Plot E, a private section specifically built to hold what the Graves Registration referred to as "the dishonored dead"; per standard practice, all had been [[Military discharge#Dishonorable|dishonorably discharged]] from the US Army the day before their executions.

Plot E is detached from the main four cemetery plots for the honored dead of World War I. It is located across the road and deliberately hidden from view, inside a 100×50&amp;nbsp;feet oval-shaped clearing surrounded by hedges and hidden in thick forest. Officially, Plot E does not exist: it is not mentioned on the [[American Battle Monuments Commission|ABMC]] website or in any guide pamphlets or maps. The plot is accessible only through the back door of the superintendent's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://binged.it/KmEdbX |title=Bing Maps - Driving Directions, Traffic and Road Conditions |publisher=Binged.it |date=2015-03-04 |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access is difficult and visitors are not encouraged, though the section is maintained by cemetery caretakers who periodically mow the lawn area and trim the hedges. One cemetery employee described Plot E as a "house of shame" and a "perfect anti-memorial".&lt;ref name=interpreter&gt;Kaplan, Alice. ''The Interpreter''. Free Press: New York, 2005. 172–3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unlike the marble monuments and inscribed standing headstones of the regular plots, Plot E contains nothing but 96 flat stone markers (arranged in four rows) and a single small granite cross. The white grave markers are the size of [[index card]]s and have nothing on them except sequential numbers engraved in black. The intention was that individual graves would be impossible to identify.

No US flag is permitted to fly over the section, and the numbered graves literally lie with their backs turned to the main cemetery on the other side of the road.{{clarify|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref name=slovik&gt;Huie, William Bradford.''The Execution of Private Slovik.'' Westholme: Yardley, 1954. 4–7.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The only individual buried in Plot E who had not been convicted of rape or murder was [[Eddie Slovik]], who was executed for desertion on 31 January 1945. In 1987, President [[Ronald Reagan]] gave permission for Slovik's remains to be exhumed and returned to the United States for reburial.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/eddie-slovik Jewish Virtual Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/galleries/Moving-war-memorials-around-the-world/war--plot--e--ois/ ''The Telegraph'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Burials at Plot E ==
All individuals currently interred in Plot E were found guilty at [[general court martial]] of the [[capital crime]]s of rape and/or murder, and a number of the female victims were raped ''and'' murdered. 

Furthermore, some victims were children: e.g. 15-year-old Elizabeth Green, who was raped and strangled by Corporal Ernest Lee Clarke (grave 68) and Private Augustine M. Guerra (grave 44) at [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]] on 22 August 1944, and 7-year-old Patricia Wylie, who was raped and strangled by Private William Harrison (grave 62) in [[Northern Ireland]] on 25 September 1944. 

Other rape and murder victims were adults, e.g., 75-year-old Agnes Cope who was raped by Private Aniceto Martinez (grave 39) on 6 August 1944, or Joyce Brown, who was raped by Corporal Robert L. Pearson (grave 22) and Private Parson [aka Cubia] Jones (grave 15) on 3 December 1944 while pregnant. 

Another case involved Private Lee A. Davis  (grave 61), who raped Muriel Fawden after fatally shooting her friend, 19-year-old Cynthia June Lay near Savernake Hospital, [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]] on 28 September 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/sheptonm.html |title=Shepton Mallet prison history |publisher=Capitalpunishmentuk.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private Madison Thomas (grave 76) was convicted by a court martial in [[Plymouth]] of raping Beatrice Maud Reynolds in a field at Albaston (near [[Gunnislake]], [[Cornwall]]) on 26 July 1944, and was hanged at [[HMP Shepton Mallet]] on 12 October 1944.

James E. Hendricks (grave 13) was hanged near [[Plumaudan]] on 24 November 1944 for the murder of Victor Bignon and the attempted rape of his wife Noémie. The cases of [[Louis Till]] (grave 73) and the murder of Sir [[Eric Teichman]] by George E. Smith (grave 52) on 3 December 1944 are other examples. 

Similarly, on 10 February 1945, Privates Yancy Waiters (grave 31) and Robert L. Skinner (grave 64) were hanged simultaneously in the village of Hameau au Pigeon in [[Quettetot]] on the [[Cherbourg peninsula]] after being convicted of murder and rape. Among spectators at their execution were twenty French witnesses, including nineteen-year-old Marie Osouf, the girl who was raped, and the family of Auguste Lebarillier (Marie's boyfriend), who was murdered.

Private Blake W. Mariano (grave 12), a 29-year-old gunner with the 191st Tank Battalion, was hanged at Loire Disciplinary Training Center in [[Le Mans]], [[France]] on 10 October 1945 for an incident which took place in [[Lauf (Baden)|Lauf]], [[Germany]] on 15 April 1945; he raped two women aged 21 and 54, and shot dead their 41-year-old companion.

The following table provides names, serial numbers, locations, and associated grave numbers of deceased interred in Plot E of the Oise-Aisne American Cemetery. This list only became available in 2009, following a [[Freedom of Information Act]] request. Prior to that, it was impossible to determine who was buried in a particular grave, because the graves are only marked with numbers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2435">'''Privacy-preserving computational geometry''' is the research area on the intersection of the domains of [[secure multi-party computation]] (SMC) and [[computational geometry]]. Classical problems of computational geometry reconsidered from the point of view of SMC include shape intersection, private point inclusion problem, [[range searching]], [[convex hull]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joics.com/publishedpapers/2012_9_4_915_929.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and more.&lt;ref name=lyhz&gt;Kaitai LIANG, Bo YANG, Dake HE, Min ZHOU, [http://www.jofcis.com/publishedpapers/2011_7_6_1910_1923.pdf Privacy-Preserving Computational Geometry Problems on Conic Sections], Journal of Computational Information Systems 7: 6 (2011) 1910–1923 &lt;/ref&gt;

A pioneering work in this area was a 2001 paper by Atallah and Du, &lt;ref name=ad&gt;[[Mikhail Atallah|Atallah M J]], Du W. [https://www.cerias.purdue.edu/assets/pdf/bibtex_archive/mja1.pdf Secure Multiparty Computational Geometry]. In Proc. Algorithms and Data Structures: 7th  International Workshop, WADS 2001, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, LNCS 2125, Providence, RI, USA, pages 165–179, August, 8–10, 2001. (As cited by Liang et al. 2011) &lt;/ref&gt; in which the secure [[point in polygon]] inclusion and polygonal intersection problems were considered. 

Other problems are computation of the distance between two private points&lt;ref&gt;Li S D, Dai Y Q. Secure two-party computational geometry. Journal of Computer Science and Technology, 20(2): pages 258–263, 2005. &lt;/ref&gt; and secure two-party point-circle inclusion problem.&lt;ref&gt;Luo Y L, Huang L S, Zhong H. Secure two-party point-circle inclusion problem. Journal of Computer Science and Technology, 22(1): pages 88–91, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problem statements==
The problems use the conventional "[[Alice and Bob]]" terminology. In all problems the required solution is a protocol of information exchange during which no additional information is revealed beyond what may be inferred from the answer to the required question.

*'''Point-in-polygon:'''  Alice has a point ''a'', and Bob has a polygon ''B''. They need to determine whether ''a'' is inside ''B''. &lt;ref name=ad/&gt;
*'''Polygon pair intersection:''' Alice has a polygon ''A'', and Bob has a polygon ''B''. They need to determine whether A intersects B. &lt;ref name=ad/&gt;

'''Rapido (Roussel Dupont)''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Dan Abnett]], [[Andy Lanning]], and [[Doug Braithwaite]], the character made his first appearance in ''[[The Punisher (1987 series)|The Punisher]]'' Vol. 2, #65 (June 1992). He is an enemy of the [[Punisher]].&lt;ref name ="Outhousers"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.theouthousers.com/index.php/features/15490-super-reads-149.html|title = Super Reads 149|last = X|first = Superginrai|publisher = The Outhousers|date = 31 August 2011|website = theouthousers.com|accessdate = 1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication history ==

Rapido was introduced in the "Eurohit" story-arc that ran through ''[[The Punisher (1987 series)|The Punisher]]'' Vol. 2, #64-70,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.supermegamonkey.net/chronocomic/entries/punisher_64-70.shtml|title = ''Punisher'' #64-70|last = |first = |publisher = Super Mega Monkey's Marvel Comics Chronology|date = |website = supermegamonkey.net|accessdate = 1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and returned in the "Suicide Run" installments ''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' Vol. 1, #61 and ''[[The Punisher War Zone]]'' Vol. 1, #23,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.multiversitycomics.com/columns/crossed-out-crossovers-suicide-run/|title = Crossed-Out Crossovers: Suicide Run|last = Tobin|first = Patrick|publisher = Multiversity Comics|date = 20 April 2011|website = multiversitycomics.com|accessdate = 1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the "Eurohit" sequel contained within ''The Punisher Annual'' Vol. 2, #7. After an absence of seventeen years, the character reappeared in the [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]: The [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]]'', and a storyline that occurred in ''[[Captain America]] and [[Iron Man]]'' #633-635.

Rapido also received entries in the [[handbook]]s ''Marvel Encyclopedia'' #5 (which revealed his real name) and ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]: Battle Damage Report''.

== Fictional character biography ==
A former member of the [[French Foreign Legion]], Rapido at some point left the service, became a mercenary, and had his right arm replaced with a mechanical one that has a [[chain gun]] in place of a hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning|penciller = Andrew Currie|inker = Art Nichols|colorist = Joe Andreani|letterer = Bill Oakley|editor = Don Daley|story = Unfinished Business|title = The Punisher Annual|volume = 2|issue = #7|date = 1994|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] enacts a plot to use the [[Channel Tunnel]] as a means of establishing an international crime network, he hires Rapido to assist him, along with fellow assassins Snakebite, Chauffard, and [[Batroc the Leaper]]. When the Punisher travels to Europe and begins investigating the Chunnel plan, Rapido and the other mercenaries ambush him and his companion, Morgan Sinclair, and shoot their helicopter down over the [[Vosges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning|penciller = Doug Braithwaite|inker = Al Williamson|colorist = Ian Laughlin|letterer = Ken Lopez|editor = Don Daley|story = Eurohit 2 of 7: French Connections|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #65|date = July 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning|penciller = Doug Braithwaite|inker = Al Williamson|colorist = Christie Scheele|letterer = Ken Lopez|editor = Don Daley|story = Eurohit 3 of 7: Black Forest, Black Bear|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #66|date = July 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapido and the other hitmen then go after a group of Swiss and Italian mobsters in [[Geneva]], but their attempt to kill all of them is foiled by the Punisher and Sinclair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning|penciller = Doug Braithwaite|inker = Al Williamson|colorist = Christie Scheele|letterer = Ken Lopez|editor = Don Daley|story = Eurohit 4 of 7: Swiss Timing|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #67|date = August 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapido and his allies track the Punisher and Sinclair down to [[Spain]], but the duo escapes them again, so Rapido and the others reconvene in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning|penciller = Doug Braithwaite|inker = Al Williamson|colorist = Christie Scheele|letterer = Ken Lopez|editor = Don Daley|story = Eurohit 5 of 7: Seeing Red|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #68|date = August 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Kingpin arranges a meeting of the heads of various European crime syndicates in central London, Rapido and the other killers in his employ are instructed to assassinate them, so that their organizations can be taken over by the Kingpin. After the Punisher breaks into the building that the sit down is taking place in, Rapido battles one of the vigilante's colleagues, Outlaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning|penciller = Doug Braithwaite|inker = Al Williamson|colorist = Christie Scheele|letterer = Ken Lopez|editor = Don Daley|story = Eurohit 6 of 7: Capital Punishment|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #69|date = September 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapido pursues the vigilante through the edifice, and is incapacitated when Outlaw tricks him into falling through a weakened floor and leaves him to be arrested by the [[Special Air Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning|penciller = Doug Braithwaite|inker = Al Williamson|colorist = Christie Scheele|letterer = Ken Lopez|editor = Don Daley|story = Eurohit 7 of 7: Tunnel Vision|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #70|date = September 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapido subsequently travels to the United States to attend a crime lord summit that is being held in Manhattan Tower. When the Punisher infiltrates the building, Rapido and the other criminals attempt to ambush him, only for the Punisher to reveal that he has a [[dead man's switch]] that can activate a [[semtex]] bomb that will demolish Manhattan Tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Chuck Dixon|penciller = Gary Kwapisz|inker = Gary Kwapisz|colorist = Joe Andreani|letterer = Janice Chiang|editor = Don Daley|story = Terminal Objectives Pt. 1|title = The Punisher War Journal|volume = 1|issue = #61|date = 1 December 1993|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the chaotic scrimmage that follows, the Punisher headlocks Rapido, jams a handgun into his mouth, and orders him to open fire on the other criminals, who are forced to shoot Rapido.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Larry Hama|penciller = John Buscema|inker = Art Nichols, Val Mayerik, and Jimmy Palmiotti|colorist = Ericka Moran and Kevin Tinsley|letterer = Michael Higgins|editor = Don Daley|story = Bringing Down the House Pt. 2|title = The Punisher War Zone|volume = 1|issue = #23|date = January 1994|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapido survived the gunfire and the Punisher blowing up Manhattan Tower, dug himself out of the rubble, and re-allied with Chauffard. With the help of the Architect, Chauffard attempts to reestablish the Chunnel plan, and instructs Rapido to assassinate Morgan Sinclair, Jack Oonuk, and Outlaw, who fake their deaths with the assistance of the Punisher. When the Punisher and his accomplices attack the Chunnel operation, Rapido is left bedridden with numerous broken bones after being hit by a train while fighting the Punisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning|penciller = Doug Braithwaite|inker = Al Williamson and Fred Fredericks|colorist = Art Nichols and Christie Scheele|letterer = Ken Lopez|editor = Don Daley|story = Eurohit '94|title = The Punisher Annual|volume = 2|issue = #7|date = 1994|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, Rapido is reluctantly hired by the French government to help patrol France's borders, the country having become a hotspot destination for super powered American immigrants in light of the events of ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Ronald Byrd and Anthony Flamini|penciller = Scott Kolins|inker = Scott Kolins|editor = Jeff Youngquist, Jennifer Grunwald, Mark D. Beazley, and Tom Brevoort|story = International Reaction|title = Civil War: Battle Damage Report|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = 21 March 2007|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, terrorists hire Rapido to obtain information pertaining to France's nuclear weapons arsenal through an ancillary [[Minister of Defence (France)|Ministry of Defense]] ops room that is hidden beneath a [[Marseille]] cathedral. Rapido obtains the intel, sends it to his employers, and is then defeated by [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] and [[Peregrine (comics)|Peregrine]].&lt;ref name ="Outhousers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Cullen Bunn|penciller = Peter Nguyen|inker = Peter Nguyen|colorist = Veronica Gandini|letterer = VC's Clayton Cowles|editor = Charlie Beckerman|title = Fear Itself: The Black Widow|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = 29 June 2011|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapido next appears antagonizing [[Captain America]] and [[Iron Man]] as a member of the latest incarnation of Batroc's Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Cullen Bunn|penciller = Barry Kitson|inker = Barry Kitson|colorist = Javier Tartaglia|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Lauren Sankovitch|story = One Night in Madripoor...!|title = Captain America and Iron Man|volume = 1|issue = #633|date = 27 June 2012|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Cullen Bunn|penciller = Jay Leisten and Barry Kitson|inker = Jay Leistein and Barry Kitson|colorist = Javier Tartaglia|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Lauren Sankovitch|story = Battle Royale!|title = Captain America and Iron Man|volume = 1|issue = #634|date = 25 July 2012|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Cullen Bunn|penciller = Barry Kitson|inker = Barry Kitson|colorist = Javier Tartaglia|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Lauren Sankovitch|story = M.A.D.A.K.

A Rapido [[Life Model Decoy]] is later shown among an army of hero and villain-based LMDs that the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] had created using an abandoned [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] program called Project: Doppelganger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Robbie Thompson|penciller = Matt Horak, Elmo Bóndoc and Flaviano|inker = Matt Horak, Elmo Bóndoc and Flaviano|colorist = Brian Reber|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Jordan D.

== Powers and abilities ==
Along with the training he received while apart of the [[French Foreign Legion]], Rapido also has a [[chain gun]] in place of a right arm. The gun is capable of firing bullets, grenades and lasers, and can be used as both a bludgeoning weapon and a [[battering ram]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37447">'''Regeneration in humans''' is the regrowth of lost tissues or organs in response to injury. This is in contrast to [[wound healing]], which involves closing up the injury site with a [[scar]]. Some tissues such as skin and large organs including the liver regrow quite readily, while others have been thought to have little or no capacity for regeneration. However ongoing research, particularly in the heart and lungs, suggests that there is hope for a variety of tissues and organs to eventually become regeneration-capable.

==History of human tissue regeneration==

In humans with non-injured tissues, the tissue is naturally regenerated over time; by default these tissues have new cells available to replace expended cells. For example, the body regenerates a full bone within 10 years, while non-injured skin tissue is regenerated within two weeks.&lt;ref name=tedOrgans2009/&gt; With injured tissue, the body usually has a different response – this emergency response usually involves building a degree of scar tissue over a time period longer than a regenerative response, as has been proven clinically&lt;ref name=Cubison2006&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cubison TC, Pape SA, Parkhouse N |title=Evidence for the link between healing time and the development of hypertrophic scars (HTS) in paediatric burns due to scald injury |journal=Burns |volume=32 |issue=8 |pages=992–9 |date=December 2006  |pmid=16901651 |doi=10.1016/j.burns.2006.02.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and via observation. There are many more historical and nuanced understandings about regeneration processes. In full thickness wounds that are under 2mm, regeneration generally occurs before scarring.&lt;ref name=noScar2mm&gt;{{Cite web|author=Traci A.

There are some human organs and tissues that regenerate rather than simply scar, as a result of injury. These include the liver, fingertips, and endometrium. More information is now known regarding the passive replacement of tissues in the human body, as well as the mechanics of [[stem cell]]s. Advances in research have enabled the induced regeneration of many more tissues and organs than previously thought possible. The aim for these techniques is to use these techniques in the near future for the purpose of regenerating any tissue type in the human body.

=== Regeneration with materials ===
Generally humans, in vivo, can regenerate injured tissues for limited distances of up to 2mm. The further the wound distance is from 2mm the more the wound regeneration will need inducement. By 2009, via the use of materials, a max induced regeneration could be achieved inside a 1&amp;nbsp;cm tissue rupture.&lt;ref name=tedOrgans2009/&gt; Bridging the wound, the material allowed cells to cross the wound gap; the material then degraded. This technology was first used inside a broken urethra in 1996.&lt;ref name=tedOrgans2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=organRegen2012/&gt;  In 2012, using materials, a full urethra was restored in vivo.&lt;ref name=organRegen2012/&gt;

=== Regeneration by 3D printing ===
In 2009, the regeneration of hollow organs and tissues with a long diffusion distance, was a little more challenging. Therefore, to regenerate hollow organs and tissues with a long diffusion distance, the tissue had to be regenerated inside the lab, via the use of a 3D printer.&lt;ref name=tedOrgans2009&gt;{{cite web | last = Atala | first = Anthony| title = Growing new organs| publisher = ted.com | date = October 2009| url = http://www.ted.com/talks/anthony_atala_growing_organs_engineering_tissue?language=en#t-541083 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With printing tissues, by 2012, there were four accepted standard levels of regenerative complexity that were acknowledged in various academic institutions: 
* Level one, ''flat tissue'' like skin was the simplest to recreate;&lt;ref name=organRegen2012/&gt; 
* Level two was ''tubular structures'' such as blood vessels;&lt;ref name=organRegen2012/&gt; 
* Level three was ''hollow non-tubular structures'';&lt;ref name=organRegen2012/&gt; 
* Level four was ''solid organs'', which were by far the most complex to recreate due to the vascularity.&lt;ref name=organRegen2012/&gt;

|}

In 2012, within 60 days it was possible, inside the lab, to grow tissue the size of half a postage stamp to the size of a football field; and most cell types could be grown and expanded outside of the body, with the exception of the liver, nerve and pancreas, as these tissue types need stem cell populations.&lt;ref name=organRegen2012&gt;{{cite web | last = McManus| first = Rich | title = Atala Surveys Successes of Regenerative Medicine | website = nihrecord.nih.gov | date = 2 March 2012 | url = http://nihrecord.nih.gov/newsletters/2012/03_02_2012/story1.htm | accessdate = 7 April 2015 | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20141121112209/http://nihrecord.nih.gov/newsletters/2012/03_02_2012/story1.htm| dead-url = yes| archivedate =2014-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first organ ever induced and made in the lab was the bladder, which was created in 1999. In 2014, organs that have been various tissues regenerated by the printer; these tissues include the bladder, muscle, vagina, penis and the thymus.

In 2015 researchers developed a proof of principle biolimb inside a laboratory; they also estimated that it would be at least a decade for any testing of limbs in humans. The limb demonstrated, fully functioning skin, muscles, blood vessels and bones.&lt;ref name=limb2015&gt;{{cite web | last = Plaugic | first = Lizzie | title = Researchers have grown a partially functioning rat limb in a lab | website = theverge.com | publisher = washingtonpost.com | date = 4 June 2015 | url = https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/4/8730453/rat-limb-biolimb-regeneration-decellularization | accessdate = 8 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regeneration with drugs ===
In 2016 scientists could transform a skin cell into any other tissue type via the use of drugs.&lt;ref name="skinStemSept2016"&gt;{{cite web

==Naturally regenerating appendages and organs==

===Heart===
Cardiomyocyte necrosis activates an inflammatory response that serves to clear the injured myocardium from dead cells, and stimulates repair, but may also extend injury. Research suggests that the cell types involved in the process play an important role. Namely monocyte-derived macrophages tend to induce inflammation while inhibiting cardiac regeneration, while tissue resident macrophages may help restoration of tissue structure and function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frangogiannis |first=N.G.|title=Inflammation in cardiac injury, repair and regeneration. |journal=Curr Opin Cardiol|date=May 2015|pages=240–245 |pmid=25807226|pmc=4401066|volume=30|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endometrium===
The [[endometrium]] after the process of breakdown via the menstruation cycle, re-epithelializes swiftly and regenerates.&lt;ref name=CompleteRegen2&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Min | first1 = Su | last2 = Wang | first2 = Song W. | last3 = Orr | first3 = William | title = Graphic general pathology: 2.2 complete regeneration: | work = Pathology | publisher = pathol.med.stu.edu.cn | year = 2006 | quote = After the repair process has been completed, the structure and function of the injured tissue are completely normal.

===Fingers===
In May 1932, L.H. McKim published a report in ''The Canadian Medical Association Journal'', that described the regeneration of an adult digit-tip following amputation.  A house surgeon in the [[Montreal General Hospital]] underwent amputation of the [[Phalanx bones|distal phalanx]] to stop the spread of an infection.  In less than one month following surgery, x-ray analysis showed the regrowth of bone while macroscopic observation showed the regrowth of nail and skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKim |first=L.H.|title=Regeneration Of The Distal Phalanx |journal=The Canadian Medical Association Journal|date=May 1932|pages=549–550 |pmid=20318716|pmc=402335|volume=26|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the earliest recorded examples of adult human digit-tip regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wicker |first=Jordan |author2=Kenneth Kamler |title=Current concepts in limb regeneration: A hand surgeon's perspective |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |date=August 2009|volume=1172|issue=1 |pages=95–109 |pmid=19735243 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04413.x |bibcode=2009NYASA1172...95W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in the 1970s showed that children up to the age of 10 or so who lose fingertips in accidents can regrow the tip of the digit within a month provided their wounds are not sealed up with flaps of skin &amp;ndash; the de facto treatment in such emergencies. They normally won't have a [[fingerprint]], and if there is any piece of the finger nail left it will grow back as well, usually in a square shape rather than round.&lt;ref name="weintraub"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Weintraub, Arlene |title= The Geniuses Of Regeneration|date=May 24, 2004 |journal=BusinessWeek|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_21/b3884008_mz001.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Illingworth"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Illingworth Cynthia M | year = 1974 | title = Trapped fingers and amputated fingertips in children | journal = Journal of Pediatric Surgery | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 853–858 | doi=10.1016/s0022-3468(74)80220-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, Lee Spievack, then in his early sixties, accidentally sliced off the tip of his right middle finger just above the [[Phalanx bones|first phalanx]]. His brother, Dr. Alan Spievack, was researching regeneration and provided him with powdered [[extracellular matrix]], developed by Dr. Stephen Badylak of the [http://www.mirm.pitt.edu/ McGowan Institute] of [[Regenerative medicine|Regenerative Medicine]]. Mr. Spievack covered the wound with the powder, and the tip of his finger re-grew in four weeks.&lt;ref name=MSNBC_20070219&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=October 24, 2008 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17171083/ |title=Regeneration recipe: Pinch of pig, cell of lizard |agency=Associated Press |publisher=MSNBC |date=February 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news was released in 2007. [[Ben Goldacre]] has described this as "the missing finger that never was", claiming that fingertips regrow and quoted [[Simon Kay]], professor of [[hand surgery]] at the [[University of Leeds]], who from the picture provided by Goldacre described the case as seemingly "an ordinary fingertip injury with quite unremarkable healing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/03/medicalresearch.health |date=May 3, 2008 |work=The Guardian |title=The missing finger that never was |author=Goldacre, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar story was reported by CNN. A woman named [[Deepa Kulkarni]] lost the tip of her little finger and was initially told by doctors that nothing could be done. Her personal research and consultation with several specialists including Badylak eventually resulted in her undergoing regenerative therapy and regaining her fingertip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/09/09/pinky.regeneration.surgery/index.html Woman's persistence pays off in regenerated fingertip] by Elizabeth Cohen.

===Kidney===
Regenerative capacity of the [[kidney]] has been recently explored.&lt;ref&gt;Regeneration and Experimental Orthotopic Transplantation of a Bioengineered Kidney, Nat Med. 2013 May ; 19(5): 646–651 by Jeremy J Song; Jacques Guyette; Sarah Gilpin; Gabriel Gonzalez; Joseph P Vacanti; and Harald C Ott. Harvard Medical School. {{DOI|10.1038/nm.3154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic functional and structural unit of the kidney is [[nephron]], which is mainly composed of four components: the glomerulus, tubules, the collecting duct and peritubular capillaries. The regenerative capacity of the mammalian kidney is limited compared to that of lower vertebrates.

In the mammalian kidney, the regeneration of the tubular component following an acute injury is well known. Recently regeneration of the [[glomerulus]] has also been documented. Following an acute injury, the proximal tubule is damaged more, and the injured epithelial cells slough off the basement membrane of the nephron. The surviving epithelial cells, however, undergo migration, dedifferentiation, proliferation, and redifferentiation to replenish the epithelial lining of the proximal tubule after injury. Recently, the presence and participation of kidney [[stem cell]]s in the tubular regeneration has been shown. However, the concept of kidney stem cells is currently emerging. In addition to the surviving tubular epithelial cells and kidney stem cells, the bone marrow stem cells have also been shown to participate in regeneration of the proximal tubule, however, the mechanisms remain controversial. Recently, studies examining the capacity of bone marrow stem cells to differentiate into renal cells are emerging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kurinji | year = 2009 | title = In Vitro Differentiation of MSC into Cells with a Renal Tubular Epithelial-Like Phenotype | url = http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a913452182~db=all~jumptype=rss | journal = Renal Failure | volume = 31 | issue = 6| pages = 492–502 |display-authors=etal | doi=10.1080/08860220902928981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other organs, the kidney is also known to regenerate completely in lower vertebrates such as fish. Some of the known fish that show remarkable capacity of kidney regeneration are goldfish, skates, rays, and sharks. In these fish, the entire nephron regenerates following injury or partial removal of the kidney.

===Liver===
The human [[liver]] is particularly known for its ability to regenerate, and is capable of doing so from only one quarter of its tissue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2007-04-17 |url=http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news/Liver-Regeneration-Unplugged-19988-1/ |title=Liver Regeneration Unplugged |date=2007-04-17 |publisher=Bio-Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; due chiefly to the [[cell potency|unipotency]] of [[hepatocyte]]s.&lt;ref name=AAAAM_Michael_2007&gt;{{cite journal |accessdate=October 24, 2008 |url=http://eesystem.com/docs/AAAAM%202007%20long%20biography%20abstr_.pdf |format=PDF |title=Bio-Scalar Technology: Regeneration and Optimization of the Body-Mind Homeostasis |author=Michael, Sandra Rose |page=2 |journal=15th Annual AAAAM Conference |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120002706/http://eesystem.com/docs/AAAAM%202007%20long%20biography%20abstr_.pdf |archivedate=November 20, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Resection of liver can induce the proliferation of the remaining hepatocytes until the lost mass is restored, where the intensity of the liver’s response is directly proportional to the mass resected.

There are now several human tissues that have been successfully or partially induced to regenerate. Many of these examples fall under the topic of [[regenerative medicine]], which includes the methods and research conducted with the aim of regenerating the organs and tissues of humans as a result of injury. The major strategies of regenerative medicine include dedifferentiating injury site cells, transplanting stem cells, implanting lab-grown tissues and organs, and implanting bioartificial tissues.

===Bladder===
In 1999 the bladder was the first regenerated organ to be given to seven patients; as of 2014, these regenerated bladders are still functioning inside the beneficiaries.&lt;ref name=regen2014104&gt;{{cite web | last =Mohammadi | first = Dara| title = Bioengineered organs: The story so far… | publisher = theguardian.com | date = 4 October 2014 | url =https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/oct/04/penis-transplants-anthony-atala-interview| accessdate = 9 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heart===
[[Cardiovascular disease]]s are the leading cause of death worldwide, and have increased proportionally from 25.8% of global deaths in 1990, to 31.5% of deaths in 2013.&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; This is true in all areas of the world except Africa.&lt;ref name=WHO2011&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mendis|first1=Shanthi|last2=Puska,|first2=Pekka|last3=Norrving|first3=Bo|title=Global atlas on cardiovascular disease prevention and control|date=2011|publisher=World Health Organization in collaboration with the World Heart Federation and the World Stroke Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9789241564373|pages=3–18|edition=1st|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241564373_eng.pdf?ua=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GDB2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.|journal=Lancet|date=17 December 2014|pmid=25530442|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–71|pmc=4340604}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In addition, during a typical [[myocardial infarction]] or heart attack, an estimated one billion cardiac cells are lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Laflamme|first1=MA|last2=Murry|first2=CE|title=Regenerating the heart|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=23|issue=7|pages=845–56|date=July 2005|pmid=16003373|doi=10.1038/nbt1117}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The scarring that results is then responsible for greatly increasing the risk of life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms or [[cardiac arrhythmia|arrhythmias]]. Therefore, the ability to naturally regenerate the heart would have an enormous impact of modern healthcare. However, while several animals can regenerate heart damage (e.g. the [[axolotl]]), mammalian [[cardiac muscle cell|cardiomyocytes]] (heart muscle cells) cannot proliferate (multiply) and heart damage causes scarring and [[fibrosis]].

Despite the earlier belief that human cardiomyocytes are not generated later in life, a recent study has found that this is not the case. This study took advantage of the nuclear bomb testing during the [[Cold War]], which introduced carbon-14 into the atmosphere and therefore into the cells of nearby inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Bergmann2009"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Bergmann O, etal | title=Evidence for Cariomyocyte Renewal in Humans |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=324 | year=2009 | pages=98–102| doi=10.1126/science.1164680 | pmid=19342590 | pmc=2991140}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  They extracted DNA from the myocardium of these research subjects and found that cardiomyocytes do in fact renew at a slowing rate of 1% per year from the age of 25, to 0.45% per year at the age of 75.&lt;ref name="Bergmann2009" /&gt;  This amounts to less than half of the original cardiomyocytes being replaced during the average lifespan. However, serious doubts have been placed on the validity of this research, including the appropriateness of the samples as representative of normally aging hearts.&lt;ref name="Kajstura2012"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless, further research has been conducted that supports the potential for human cardiac regeneration. Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase was found to induce mitosis in adult mammalian cardiomyocytes.&lt;ref&gt;http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/19/10/1175.full&lt;/ref&gt;  While treatment with FGF1 and [[p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases|p38 MAP kinase]] inhibitors was found to regenerate the heart, reduce scarring, and improve cardiac function in rats with cardiac injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=October 2006 |volume=103 |issue=42 |pmid=17032753 |title=FGF1/p38 MAP kinase inhibitor therapy induces cardiomyocyte mitosis, reduces scarring, and rescues function after myocardial infarction|pmc=1622860 |author=Felix B.

One of the most promising sources of heart regeneration is the use of stem cells. It was demonstrated in mice that there is a resident population of stem cells or cardiac progenitors in the adult heart – this population of stem cells was shown to be reprogrammed to differentiate into cardiomyocytes that replaced those lost during a heart tissue death.&lt;ref name="Smart2011"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Smart N, etal | title=De novo cardiomyocytes from within the activated dult heart after injury | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=474 | year=2011 | pages=640–644| doi=10.1038/nature10188 | pmid=21654746 | pmc=3696525}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In humans specifically, a “cardiac mesenchymal feeder layer” was found in the myocardium that renewed the cells with progenitors that differentiated into mature cardiac cells.&lt;ref name="Laugwitz2005"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Laugwitz KL, etal | title=Postnatal isl1+carioblasts enter fully differentiated cardiomyocyte lineages | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=433 | year=2005 | pages=647–653| doi=10.1038/nature03215 | pmid=15703750}}
&lt;/ref&gt; What these studies show is that the human heart contains stem cells that could potentially be induced into regenerating the heart when needed, rather than just being used to replace expended cells.

Loss of the myocardium due to disease often leads to heart failure; therefore, it would be useful to be able to take cells from elsewhere in the heart to replenish those lost. This was achieved in 2010 when mature cardiac [[fibroblasts]] were reprogrammed directly into cardiomyocyte-like cells. This was done using three [[transcription factors]]: [[GATA4]], [[Mef2c]], and [[TBX5 (gene)|Tbx5]].&lt;ref name="Ieda2010"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Ieda M, etal | title=Direct Reprogramming of Fibroblasts into Functional Cardiomyocytes by Defined Factors | journal=[[Cell (journal)|Cell]] | volume=142 | year=2010 | pages=375–386| doi=10.1016/j.cell.2010.07.002 | pmid=20691899 | pmc=2919844}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Cardiac fibroblasts make up more than half of all heart cells and are usually not able to conduct contractions (are not cardiogenic), but those reprogrammed were able to contract spontaneously.&lt;ref name="Ieda2010" /&gt; The significance is that fibroblasts from the damaged heart or from elsewhere, may be a source of functional cardiomyocytes for regeneration.

Simply injecting functioning cardiac cells into a damaged heart is only partially effective. In order to achieve more reliable results, structures composed of the cells need to be produced and then transplanted. Masumoto and his team designed a method of producing sheets of cardiomyocytes and vascular cells from human [[induced pluripotent stem cell|iPSCs]]. These sheets were then transplanted onto infarcted hearts of rats, leading to significantly improved cardiac function.&lt;ref name="Masumoto2014"&gt;

===Lung===

[[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) is one of the most widespread health threats today. It affects 329 million people worldwide, which makes up nearly 5% of the global population. Having killed over 3 million people in 2012, COPD was the third greatest cause of death.&lt;ref name="WHOTTCD"&gt;{{cite web |title=The 10 leading causes of death in the world, 2000 and 2011 |date=July 2013 |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/ |accessdate=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worse still is that due to increasing smoking rates and the aging populations in many countries, the number of deaths as a result of COPD and other chronic [[lung]] diseases is predicted to continue increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mathers CD, Loncar D |title=Projections of Global Mortality and Burden of Disease from 2002 to 2030 |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=3 |issue=11 |pages=e442 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17132052 |pmc=1664601 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030442 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030442}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, developments in the lung’s capacity for regeneration is in high demand.

It has been shown that bone marrow-derived cells could be the source of progenitor cells of multiple cell lineages, and a 2004 study suggested that one of these cell types was involved in lung regeneration.&lt;ref name="Ishizawa2004"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Ishizawa K, etal | title=Bone marrow-derived cells contribute to lung regeneration after elastase-induced pulmonary emphysemal | journal=[[FEBS]] | volume=556 | year=2004 | pages=249–252 | doi=10.1016/s0014-5793(03)01399-1}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a potential source of cells for lung regeneration has been found; however, due to advances in inducing stem cells and directing their differentiation, major progress in lung regeneration has consistently featured the use of patient-derived iPSCs and bioscaffolds.
The [[extracellular matrix]] is the key to generating entire organs in vitro. It was found that by carefully removing the cells of an entire lung, a “footprint” is left behind that can guide cellular adhesion and differentiation if a population of lung epithelial cells and [[chondrocytes]] are added.&lt;ref name="Balestrini2015"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Balestrini JL, etal | title=Extracellular Matrix as a Driver for Lung Regeneration | journal=Annals of Biomedical Engineering | volume=43 | year=2015 | pages=568–576 | doi=10.1007/s10439-014-1167-5| pmc=4380778 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; This has serious applications in regenerative medicine, particularly as a 2012 study successfully purified a population of lung progenitor cells that were derived from embryonic stem cells. These can then be used to re-cellularise a three-dimensional lung tissue scaffold.&lt;ref name="Longmire2012"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Longmire TA, etal | title=Efficient Derivation of Purified Lung and Thyroid Progenitors from Embryonic Stem Cells | journal=[[Cell Stem Cell]] | volume=10 | year=2012 |  pages=398–411 | doi=10.1016/j.stem.2012.01.019}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, in 2008, there was a successful clinical transplantation of a tissue-engineered [[trachea]] in a 30-year-old woman with end-stage [[bronchomalacia]]. An ECM scaffold was created by removing the cells and [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] antigens from a human donated trachea, which was then colonised by epithelial cells and mesenchymal stem cell-derived chondrocytes cultured from cells of the recipient.&lt;ref name="Macchiarini2008"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Macchiarini P, etal | title=Clinical transplantation of a tissue-engineered airway | journal=[[The Lancet]] | volume=372 | year=2008 |  pages=2023–2030 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61598-6 | pmid=19022496}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The graft replaced her left main bronchus, immediately providing a functional airway, and retained its normal appearance and mechanical function after four months.&lt;ref name="Macchiarini2008" /&gt;  Because the graft was generated from cells cultured from the recipient, no anti-donor antibodies or [[immunosuppressive drug]]s were needed – a huge step towards personalised lung regeneration.

A 2010 investigation took this one step further by using the ECM scaffold to produce entire lungs in vitro to be transplanted into living rats.&lt;ref name="Petersen2010"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Petersen TH, etal | title=Tissue-Engineered Lungs for in Vivo Implantation |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=329 | year=2010 |  pages=538–541 |doi= 10.1126/science.1189345|pmc=3640463 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; These successfully enabled [[gas exchange]] but for short time intervals only.&lt;ref name="Petersen2010" /&gt; Nevertheless, this was a huge leap towards whole lung regeneration and transplants for humans, which has already taken another step forward with the lung regeneration of a non-human primate.&lt;ref name="Bonvillain2012"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Bonvillain RW, etal | title=A Nonhuman Primate Model of Lung Regeneration: Detergent-Mediated Decellurization and Initial In Vitro Recellularization with Mesenchymal Stem Cells | journal=Tissue Engineering Part A | volume=18 | year=2012 |  pages=23–24 |doi=10.1089/ten.tea.2011.0594 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cystic fibrosis]] is another disease of the lungs, which is highly fatal and genetically linked to a mutation in the [[Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator|CFTR gene]]. Through growing patient-specific lung epithelium in vitro, lung tissue expressing the cystic fibrosis phenotype has been achieved.&lt;ref name="Wong2012"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Wong AP, etal | title=Directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into mature airway epithelia expressing functional CFTR protein| journal=[[Nature Biotechnology]] | volume=30 | year=2012 |  pages=876–882 | doi=10.1038/nbt.2328}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This is so that modelling and drug testing of the disease pathology can be carried out with the hope of regenerative medical applications.

===Penis===
The penis has been successfully regenerated in the lab.&lt;ref name=regen2014104/&gt; The penis is a harder organ to regenerate than skin, the bladder and vagina, due to the structural complexity.&lt;ref name=regen2014104/&gt;

===Spinal nerves===
A goal of [[spinal cord injury research]] is to promote [[neuroregeneration]], reconnection of damaged neural circuits.&lt;ref name="Kabu15"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kabu, S.; Gao, Y.; Kwon, B.K.; Labhasetwar, V. |title=Drug delivery, cell-based therapies, and tissue engineering approaches for spinal cord injury |journal=Journal of Controlled Release |volume=219 |issue= |pages=141–54 |year=2015 |pmid=26343846 |doi=10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.08.060 |pmc=4656085}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The nerves in the spine are a tissue that requires a stem cell population to regenerate. In 2012 a Polish fireman [[Darek Fidyka]], with [[Paraplegia#Regeneration of the spinal cord|paraplegia]] of the spinal cord, underwent a procedure, which involved extracting [[olfactory ensheathing cell]]s (OECs) from Fidyka's [[olfactory bulb]]s, and injecting these stem cells, in vivo, into the site of the previous injury. Fidyka eventually gained feeling, movement and sensation in his limbs, especially on the side where the stem cells were injected; he also reported gaining sexual function. Fidyka can now drive and can now walk some distance aided by a frame. He is believed to be the first person in the world to recover sensory function from a complete severing of the spinal nerves.&lt;ref name=SpinalReg2014-10-21&gt;{{cite web | last = Quinn | first = Ben | title = Paralysed man Darek Fidyka walks again after pioneering surgery | quote = The 38-year-old, who is believed to be the first person in the world to recover from complete severing of the spinal nerves, can now walk with a frame and has been able to resume an independent life, even to the extent of driving a car, while sensation has returned to his lower limbs. | publisher = theguardian.com | date = 21 October 2014 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/oct/21/paralysed-darek-fidyka-pioneering-surgery| accessdate = 26 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SpinalReg2014-10-21-2&gt;{{cite web | last = Walsh | first = Fergus| title = Paralysed man walks again after cell transplant| publisher = bbc.co.uk | date = 21 October 2014 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-29645760| accessdate = 26 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thymus===
Researchers, from University of Edinburgh, have succeeded in regenerating a living organ. Regenerated organ is closely resembled with juvenile [[thymus]] in terms of architecture and gene expression profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blackburn |first=CC |title=Regeneration of the aged thymus by a single transcription factor |journal=Development|date=April 2014 |volume=141 |pages=1627–1637 |url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/141/8/1627.full |doi=10.1242/dev.103614 |pmid=24715454 |pmc=3978836}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thymus gland is one of the first organs to degenerate in normal healthy individuals.

===Vagina===
Between the years 2005 and 2008 four women with [[vaginal hypoplasia]] due to [[Müllerian agenesis]] were given regenerated vaginas.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/apr/11/vagina-grown-lab-implant-girls-disorder&lt;/ref&gt;  Up to eight years after the transplants all organs have normal function and structure.&lt;ref name=regen2014104/&gt;

[[Image:Harlan Richard 1796-1843.png|thumb|200px|Richard Harlan.]]
'''Richard Harlan''' (September 19, 1796 &amp;ndash; September 30, 1843) was an [[United States|American]] [[natural history|naturalist]], [[zoologist]], [[Herpetology|herpetologist]], [[physicist]], and [[paleontologist]]. He was the author of [http://resource.nlm.nih.gov/60930050R ''Fauna Americana'' (1825)] and ''American Herpetology''.&lt;ref name="Kelly1920"&gt;{{cite book|author=Howard Atwood Kelly|title=A Cyclopedia of American Medical Biography: Comprising the Lives of Eminent Deceased Physicians and Surgeons from 1610 to 1910|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GPssAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=6 May 2012|year=1920|publisher=W.B. Saunders Company|page=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harlan was born in [[Philadelphia]], to Joshua Harlan, a wealthy [[Quaker]] merchant, and his wife Sarah, one of their ten children. He was three years older than his brother [[Josiah Harlan]], who would become the first American to visit [[Afghanistan]] and who was the presumed inspiration for [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s story [[The Man Who Would Be King]]. He graduated in [[medicine]] from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] taking time off during his studies to spend a year at sea as a [[ship's surgeon]] for the [[British East India Company]]. In 1821 he was elected professor of [[comparative anatomy]] in the Philadelphia museum. One of his passions was the collection and study of human skulls. At its peak, his collection contained 275 skulls, the largest such collection in America.&lt;ref name="MacIntyre2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Ben MacIntyre]]|title=The Man Who Would Be King: The First American in Afghanistan|year=2004|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died of apoplexy in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref name="Kelly1920"/&gt;

In 1834, Harlan described and named ''[[Basilosaurus]]'' ("king lizard"), a genus of [[Archaeoceti|early whale]], erroneously assuming he had found a ''[[Plesiosaurus]]''-like dinosaur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS}} (5 February 1788{{spaced ndash}}2 July 1850) was a British statesman of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] who served twice as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] (1834–35 and 1841–46) and twice as [[Home Secretary]] (1822–27 and 1828–30). He is regarded as the father of modern [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|British policing]] and as one of the founders of the modern Conservative Party.

The son of wealthy textile-manufacturer and politician [[Sir Robert Peel, 1st Baronet]], making Robert the first future prime minister from an industrial business background, he was educated at [[Bury Grammar School]], [[Hipperholme Grammar School]] and [[Harrow School]], subsequently earning a [[double first]] in classics and mathematics from [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. He entered the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in 1809 under the tutelage of his father and of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Sir Arthur Wellesley]], the future Duke of Wellington. Peel was widely seen as a "rising star" in the Conservative Party and served in various junior ministerial offices, becoming (for example) [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]] (1812–1818) and Chairman of the [[Bullion Committee]].

Peel entered [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|the Cabinet]] for the first time as Home Secretary (1822–1827), where he reformed and liberalised the criminal law and created the modern police force, leading to a new type of officer known in tribute to him as "bobbies" and "peelers". After the resignation of Prime Minister Robert Jenkinson, [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|the Earl of Liverpool]], Peel resigned as Home Secretary, but after a brief period out of office he returned as Home Secretary under his political mentor the Duke of Wellington (1828–1830), also serving as [[Leader of the House of Commons]]. Initially a supporter of [[Catholic emancipation|legal discrimination against Catholics]], Peel eventually supported the repeal of the [[Test Act]] (1828) and the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]], claiming that "though emancipation was a great danger, civil strife was a greater danger".{{cn|date=June 2018}}

In 1830 the Whigs finally returned to power and Peel became a member of [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|the Opposition]] for the first time. After successive election defeats, leadership of the Conservative Party gradually passed from Wellington to Peel, and when King [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] asked Wellington to become Prime Minister in November 1834, he declined and Peel was selected instead, with Wellington serving as caretaker until Peel took office. Peel then issued the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] (December 1834), laying down the principles upon which the modern British Conservative Party is based. His [[First Peel ministry|first ministry]] was a minority government, dependent on Whig support and with Peel serving as his own [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. After only four months, his government collapsed and he served as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] during the [[Second Melbourne ministry|second government]] of [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|the Viscount Melbourne]] (1835–1841). Peel declined to head another minority government in May 1839, prompting the [[Bedchamber crisis]]. He finally became Prime Minister again after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1841|1841 general election]]. His [[Second Peel ministry|second government]] ruled for five years. He cut tariffs to stimulate trade; to replace the lost revenue he pushed through a 3% income tax. He played a central role in making [[free trade]] a reality and set up a modern banking system. His government's major legislation included the [[Mines and Collieries Act 1842]], the [[Income Tax Act 1842]], the [[Factory Acts#Factories Act 1844 (Graham's factory act)|Factories Act 1844]] and the [[Railway Regulation Act 1844]].

Peel's government was weakened by anti-Irish and anti-Catholic sentiment following the controversial [[Maynooth Grant]] of 1845. After the outbreak of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Potato Famine]], his decision to join with Whigs and [[Radicals (UK)|Radicals]] to repeal the [[Corn Laws]] led to his resignation as Prime Minister in 1846. Peel remained an influential [[backbench]] MP and leader of the [[Peelite]] faction until his death in 1850.

Peel often started from a traditional Tory position in opposition to a measure, then reversed his stance and became the leader in supporting liberal legislation. This happened with the Test Act, Catholic Emancipation, the Reform Act, income tax and, most notably, the repeal of the Corn Laws as the first two years of the Irish famine forced this resolution because of the urgent need for new food supplies. Peel, a Conservative, achieved repeal with the support of the Whigs in Parliament, overcoming the opposition of most of his own party. Many critics accordingly saw him as a traitor to the Tory cause, or as "a Liberal wolf in sheep's clothing", because his final position reflected liberal ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Richard A.

Taylor]] says: "Peel was in the first rank of 19th century statesmen. He carried Catholic Emancipation; he repealed the Corn Laws; he created the modern Conservative Party on the ruins of the [[Tory (British political party)|old Toryism]]."&lt;ref&gt;A.J.P. Taylor, ''Politicians, Socialism and Historians'' (1980) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Peel was born at Chamber Hall, [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury, Lancashire]], to the industrialist and parliamentarian [[Sir Robert Peel, 1st Baronet]] and his wife Ellen Yates. His father was one of the richest textile manufacturers of the early [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 2–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Peel was educated briefly at [[Bury Grammar School]], at [[Hipperholme Grammar School]], then at [[Harrow School]] and finally [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where he took a double first in Classics and Mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a law student at [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1809 before entering Parliament.&lt;ref name=hop&gt;[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1790-1820/member-peel-robert-ii-1788-1850 ]{{dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hipperholme Grammar School.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Peel was educated briefly at [[Hipperholme Grammar School]] (pictured)]]

Peel saw part-time military service as a captain in the Manchester Regiment of [[Militia]] in 1808, and later as lieutenant in the [[Staffordshire Yeomanry|Staffordshire Yeomanry Cavalry]] in 1820.&lt;ref name=hop /&gt;

Peel entered politics in 1809 at the age of 21, as MP for the Irish [[rotten borough]] of [[Cashel (UK Parliament constituency)|Cashel]], [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]].&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, ''Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830–1850'', 1; Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 13; 376.&lt;/ref&gt; With a scant 24 electors on the rolls, he was elected unopposed. His sponsor for the election (besides his father) was the [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Sir Arthur Wellesley]], the future Duke of Wellington, with whom Peel's political career would be entwined for the next 25 years. Peel made his [[maiden speech]] at the start of the 1810 session, when he was chosen by Prime Minister [[Spencer Perceval]] to second the reply to the [[Speech from the Throne|king's speech]].&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 18.&lt;/ref&gt; His speech was a sensation, famously described by the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker]], [[Charles Abbot, 1st Baron Colchester|Charles Abbot]], as "the best first speech since that of [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]]."&lt;ref&gt;Gash, ''Mr. Secretary Peel'', 59–61, 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

As chief secretary in [[Dublin]] in 1813, he proposed the setting up of a specialist police force, later called "peelers".&lt;ref&gt;OED entry at peeler (3)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1814 the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] was founded under Peel.

For the next decade he occupied a series of relatively minor positions in the [[Tory]] governments: Undersecretary for War, Chief Secretary for Ireland, and chairman of the [[Bullion Committee]] (charged with stabilising British finances after the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]).&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832–1841'', 6–12; Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 18–65, 376.&lt;/ref&gt; He also changed constituency twice: first picking up another constituency, [[Chippenham]], then becoming MP for [[Oxford University (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxford University]] in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832–1841'', 12, 18, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

He later became an MP for [[Tamworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Tamworth]] from 1830 until his death. His home of [[Drayton Manor]] has since been demolished.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832–1841'', 490; Read, ''Peel and the Victorians'', 4, 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home Secretary==
[[File:The Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel 1844.jpg|thumb|upright|The Duke of Wellington, Prime Minister 1828–1830, with Peel]]

Peel was considered one of the rising stars of the Tory party, first entering the cabinet in 1822 as [[Home Secretary]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832–1841'', 3, 9, 13; Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 66, 68; Read, ''Peel and the Victorians'', 65.&lt;/ref&gt; As Home Secretary, he introduced a number of important reforms of British criminal law.&lt;ref&gt;Gash, 1:477–88.&lt;/ref&gt; He reduced the number of crimes punishable by death, and simplified it by repealing a large number of criminal statutes and consolidating their provisions into what are known as [[Peel's Acts]]. He reformed the gaol system, introducing payment for gaolers and education for the inmates.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 68–71; 122; Read, ''Peel and the Victorians'', 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

He resigned as home secretary after the Prime Minister [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] became incapacitated and was replaced by [[George Canning]].&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, ''Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830–1850'', 4, 96–97; Clark, ''Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832–1841'', 26–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

He helped in the repeal of the [[Test Act|Test and Corporation Acts]] in May 1828. They required many officials to be communicants in the Anglican Church and penalised both nonconformists and Catholics. They were no longer enforced but were a matter of humiliation. Peel at first opposed the repeal but reversed himself and led the repeal, after consultation with Anglican Church leaders. In future religious issues he made it a point to consult with church leaders from the major denominations.&lt;ref&gt;Gash, 1:460–65; Richard A. Gaunt, "Peel's Other Repeal: The Test and Corporation Acts, 1828," ''Parliamentary History'' (2014) 33#1 pp. 243–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Canning favoured [[Catholic Emancipation]], while Peel had been one of its most outspoken opponents (earning the nickname "Orange Peel", with Orange the colour of the anti-Catholic Irish Unionists).&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 21–48, 91–100.&lt;/ref&gt; George Canning himself died less than four months later and, after the brief premiership of [[Frederick John Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich|Lord Goderich]], Peel returned to the post of Home Secretary under the premiership of his long-time ally the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832–1841'', 28–30; Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 103–04; Read, ''Peel and the Victorians'', 18.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he was widely perceived as the number-two in the Tory Party, after Wellington himself.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the pressure on the new ministry from advocates of Catholic Emancipation was too great and an Emancipation [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] was passed the next year. The government threatened to resign if the king opposed the bill; he finally relented. Peel reversed himself and took charge of passing Catholic Emancipation. However his action caused many Tories to have doubts about his sincerity; they never fully trusted him again.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832–1841'', 37–39; Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 114–21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gash, 1:545–98&lt;/ref&gt;

Peel felt compelled to stand for re-election of his seat in Oxford, as he was representing the graduates of Oxford University (many of whom were Anglican clergymen), and had previously stood on a platform of opposition to Catholic Emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832–1841'', 35–40; Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 46–47, 110, 376.&lt;/ref&gt; Peel lost his seat, but soon found another, moving to a [[rotten borough]], [[Westbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Westbury]], retaining his Cabinet position.&lt;ref&gt;Gash, 1:564–65&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police reform===
{{Further|Victorian morality#Crime and police}}
It was in 1829 that Peel established the [[Metropolitan Police Force]] for London based at [[Scotland Yard]].&lt;ref&gt;Gash, 1:488-98.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1,000 constables employed were affectionately nicknamed 'bobbies' or, somewhat less affectionately, 'peelers'. Although unpopular at first, they proved very successful in cutting crime in London, and by 1857 all cities in Britain were obliged to form their own police forces.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 87–90.&lt;/ref&gt; Known as the father of modern policing, Peel developed the [[Peelian Principles]] which defined the ethical requirements police officers must follow to be effective. In 1829, when setting forth the principles of policing a democracy, Sir Robert Peel declared: "The police are the public and the public are the police."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Couper |first=David C. |url=http://www.progressive.org/news/2015/05/188132/police-chiefs-call-reform |title=A Police Chief's Call for Reform |website=Progressive.org |date=2015-05-13 |accessdate=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Whigs in power (1830–1834)==
The middle and working classes in England at that time, however, were clamouring for reform, and Catholic Emancipation was only one of the ideas in the air.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 123–40.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tory ministry refused to bend on other issues and were swept out of office in 1830 in favour of the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832–1841'', 45–50; Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 136–41.&lt;/ref&gt; The following few years were extremely turbulent, but eventually [[Reform Act 1832|enough reforms]] were passed that [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]] felt confident enough to invite the Tories to form a ministry again in succession to those of [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]] and [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]] in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832–1841'', 51–62, 64–90, 129–43, 146–77, 193–201; Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 179; Read, ''Peel and the Victorians'', 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Peel was selected as prime minister but was in Italy at the time, so Wellington acted as a caretaker for three weeks until Peel's return.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832–1841'', 196–97, 199; Read, ''Peel and the Victorians'', 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|First Peel ministry}}
The Tory Ministry was a minority government and depended on Whig goodwill for its continued existence. Parliament was dissolved in December 1834 and a general election called. Voting took place in January and February 1835 and Peel's supporters gained around 100 seats, but this was not enough to give them a majority.&lt;ref&gt;The Routledge Dictionary of Modern British History,
John Plowright, Routledge, Abingdon, 2006. p235&lt;/ref&gt;

As his statement of policy at the general election of January 1835, Peel issued the [[Tamworth Manifesto]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832–1841'', 210–15; Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 184; Read, ''Peel and the Victorians'', 12; 69–72.&lt;/ref&gt; This document was the basis on which the modern [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] was founded.  In it Peel pledged that the Conservatives would endorse {{em|modest}} reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Norman Lowe|title=Mastering Modern British History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kzgoDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59|year=2017|publisher=Macmillan Education UK|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Whigs formed a compact with [[Daniel O'Connell]]'s Irish Radical members to repeatedly defeat the government on various bills.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832–1841'', 227; 229–35; Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 185–87; Read, ''Peel and the Victorians'', 71–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually after only about 100 days in government Peel's ministry resigned out of frustration and the Whigs under Lord Melbourne returned to power.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832–1841'', 250–54, 257–61; Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 188–92; Read, ''Peel and the Victorians'', 74–76.&lt;/ref&gt; The only real achievement of Peel's first administration was a commission to review the governance of the [[Church of England]]. This ecclesiastical commission was the forerunner of the [[Church Commissioners]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832–1841'', 224–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leader of the Opposition (1835–1841)==
In May 1839 he was offered another chance to form a government, this time by the new monarch, [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832–1841'', 417–18; Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 206.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this too would have been a minority government, and Peel felt he needed a further sign of confidence from his Queen. Lord Melbourne had been Victoria's confidant since her accession in 1837, and many of the higher posts in Victoria's household were held by the wives and female relatives of Whigs;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832–1841'', 416–17; Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 206–07.&lt;/ref&gt; there was some feeling that Victoria had allowed herself to be too closely associated with the Whig party. Peel therefore asked that some of this entourage be dismissed and replaced with their Conservative counterparts, provoking the so-called [[Bedchamber Crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 207–208; Read, ''Peel and the Victorians'', 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria refused to change her household, and despite pleadings from the Duke of Wellington, relied on assurances of support from Whig leaders. Peel refused to form a government, and the Whigs returned to power.&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, ''Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830–1850'', 23; Clark, ''Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832–1841'', 419–26; 448; Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 208–09; Read, ''Peel and the Victorians'', 89–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic and financial reforms===
Peel came to office during an economic recession which had seen a slump in world trade and a budget deficit of £7.5&amp;nbsp;million run up by the [[Whig (British political faction)|Whigs]]. Confidence in banks and businesses was low, and a trade deficit existed.

To raise revenue Peel's 1842 budget saw the re-introduction of the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom#History|income tax]],&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, ''Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830–1850'', 35–36; Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 227; Read, ''Peel and the Victorians'', 112.&lt;/ref&gt; removed previously at the end of the [[Napoleonic War]]. The rate was 7d in the pound, or just under 3 per cent. The money raised was more than expected and allowed for the removal and reduction of over 1,200 tariffs on imports including the controversial [[sugar duties]].&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, ''Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830–1850'', 37; Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 235; Read, ''Peel and the Victorians'', 113–14.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also in the 1842 budget that the repeal of the [[corn laws]] was first proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, ''Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830–1850'', 35–36; Read, ''Peel and the Victorians'', 112–13.&lt;/ref&gt; It was defeated in a Commons vote by a margin of 4:1.

===Factory Act===
Peel finally had a chance to head a majority government following the election of July 1841.&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, ''Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830–1850'', 24.&lt;/ref&gt; His promise of modest reform was held to, and the second most famous bill of this ministry, while "reforming" in 21st-century eyes, was in fact aimed at the reformers themselves, with their constituency among the new industrial rich. The [[Factory Act 1844]] acted more against these industrialists than it did against the traditional stronghold of the Conservatives, the [[landed gentry]], by restricting the number of hours that children and women could work in a factory and setting rudimentary safety standards for machinery.&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, ''Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830–1850'', 40–42; Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 302–05; Read, ''Peel and the Victorians'', 125; 129.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a continuation of his own father's work as an MP, as the elder Robert Peel was most noted for reform of working conditions during the first part of the 19th century. Helping him was [[Lord Shaftesbury]], a British MP who also established the [[Mines and Collieries Act 1842|coal mines act]].

===Assassination attempt===
In 1843 Peel was the target of a failed assassination attempt; a criminally-insane Scottish wood turner named [[Daniel M'Naghten]] stalked him for several days before killing Peel's personal secretary [[Edward Drummond]] thinking he was Peel&lt;ref&gt;Read, ''Peel and the Victorians'', 121–22.&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the formation of the criminal defense of [[Insanity in English law|insanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/|title=Old Bailey Online – The Proceedings of the Old Bailey, 1674–1913 – Central Criminal Court|website=www.oldbaileyonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corn Laws and after===
The most notable act of Peel's second ministry, however, was the one that would bring it down.&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, ''Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830–1850'', 113–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Peel moved against the landholders by repealing the [[Corn Laws]], which supported agricultural revenues by restricting grain imports.&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, ''Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830–1850'', vi.&lt;/ref&gt; This radical break with Conservative protectionism was triggered by the [[Great Irish Famine|Great Irish Famine (1845–1849)]].&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, ''Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830–1850'', 66; Ramsay; ''Sir Robert Peel'', 332–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Tory agriculturalists were sceptical of the extent of the problem,&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, ''Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830–1850'', 72.&lt;/ref&gt; and Peel reacted slowly to the famine, famously stating in October 1846 (already in opposition): "There is such a tendency to exaggeration and inaccuracy in Irish reports that delay in acting on them is always desirable".

His own party failed to support the bill, but it passed with Whig and Radical support. On the [[Reading (legislature)|third reading]] of Peel's Bill of Repeal (Importation Act 1846) on 15 May, [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] voted 327 votes to 229 (a majority of 98) to repeal the Corn Laws. On 25 June the Duke of Wellington persuaded the [[House of Lords]] to pass it. On that same night Peel's [[Irish Coercion Bill]] was defeated in the Commons by 292 to 219 by "a combination of Whigs, [[Radicals (UK)|Radicals]], and Tory protectionists".&lt;ref&gt;Schonhardt-Bailey, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, on 29 June 1846, Peel resigned as prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, ''Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830–1850'', 68–69, 70, 72; Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 347; Read, ''Peel and the Victorians'', 230–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he knew repealing the laws would mean the end of his ministry, Peel decided to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, ''Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830–1850'', 67–69.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Peel merely used the Irish Famine as an excuse to repeal the Corn Laws as he had been an intellectual convert to free trade since the 1820s. Blake points out that if Peel were convinced that total repeal was necessary to stave off the famine, he would have enacted a bill that brought about immediate temporary repeal, not permanent repeal over a three-year period of gradual tapering-off of duties.

The historian [[Boyd Hilton]] argues Peel knew from 1844 he was going to be deposed as the Conservative leader. Many of his MPs had taken to voting against him, and the rupture within the party between liberals and paternalists which had been so damaging in the 1820s, but masked by the issue of parliamentary reform in the 1830s, was brought to the surface over the Corn Laws. Hilton's hypothesis is that Peel wished to actually be deposed on a liberal issue so that he might later lead a Peelite/Whig/Liberal alliance.

As an aside in reference to the repeal of the Corn Laws, Peel did make some moves to subsidise the purchase of food for the Irish, but this attempt was small and had little tangible effect. In the age of [[laissez-faire]],&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, ''Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830–1850'', 70.&lt;/ref&gt; government taxes were small, and subsidies or direct economic interference were almost nonexistent. That subsidies were actually given was very much out of character for the political times; Peel's successor, [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], received more criticism than Peel on Irish policy. The repeal of the Corn Laws was more political than humanitarian.&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, ''Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830–1850'', 69–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Peel's support for free trade could already be seen in his 1842 and 1845 budgets;&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, ''Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830–1850'', pp. 35–37, 59.&lt;/ref&gt; in late 1842 [[Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet|Graham]] wrote to Peel that "the next change in the Corn Laws must be to an open trade" while arguing that the government should not tackle the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gash, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 362.&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to the cabinet in 1844, Peel argued that the choice was maintenance of the 1842 Corn Law or total repeal.&lt;ref&gt;Gash, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 429.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all of Peel's efforts, his reform programs had little effect on the situation in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, ''Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830–1850'', pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career and death==
Peel did retain a hard core of supporters however, known as [[Peelite]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, ''Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830–1850'', 78–80; Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 353–55.&lt;/ref&gt; and at one point in 1849 was actively courted by the Whig/Radical coalition. He continued to stand on his conservative principles, however, and refused. Nevertheless, he was influential on several important issues, including the furtherance of British free trade with the repeal of the [[Navigation Acts]].&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, ''Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830–1850'', 78; Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 377; Read, ''Peel and the Victorians'', 257.&lt;/ref&gt; Peel was a member of the committee which controlled the [[House of Commons Library]], and on 16 April 1850 was responsible for passing the motion that controlled its scope and collection policy for the rest of the century.

Peel was thrown from his horse while riding on [[Constitution Hill, London|Constitution Hill]] in London on 29 June 1850. The horse stumbled on top of him, and he died three days later on 2 July at the age of 62 due to a [[clavicle fracture|clavicular fracture]] rupturing his subclavian vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, ''Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830–1850'', 80; Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 361–63; Read, ''Peel and the Victorians'', 1; 266–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

His Peelite followers, led by [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]] and [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]], went on to fuse with the Whigs as the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, ''Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830–1850'', 86–87; Ramsay, ''Sir Robert Peel'', 364.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memory and legacy==
[[Image:Robert Peel Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Peel]]
The consensus view of scholars for much of the 20th century idealised Peel in heroic terms. Historian [[Boyd Hilton]] says it portrayed him as:
{{quote|The great Conservative patriot: a pragmatic gradualist, as superb in his grasp of fundamental issues as he was adroit in handling administrative detail, intelligent enough to see through abstract theories, a conciliator who put nation before party and established consensus politics.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd Hilton, "Peel: A Reappraisal," ''Historical Journal'' 22#3 (1979) pp. 585–614 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2638656 quote p 587]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Biographer [[Norman Gash]] said, Peel "looked first, not to party, but to the state; not to programmes, but to national expediency." &lt;ref&gt;Gash,  vol 1, pp 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gash added that among his personal qualities were, "administrative skill, capacity for work, personal integrity, high standards, a sense of duty [and] an outstanding intellect."&lt;ref&gt;Gash, vol 2, pg 712.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gash has emphasised the role of personality on Peel's political career:{{quote|Peel was endowed with great intelligence and integrity, and an immense capacity for hard work. A proud, stubborn, and quick-tempered man he had a passion for creative achievement; and the latter part of his life was dominated by his deep concern for the social condition of the country. Though his great debating and administrative talents secured him an outstanding position in Parliament, his abnormal sensitivity and coldness of manner debarred him from popularity among his political followers, except for the small circle of his intimate friends. As an administrator he was one of the greatest public servants in British history; in politics he was a principal architect of the modern conservative tradition. By insisting on changes unpalatable to many of his party, he helped to preserve the flexibility of the parliamentary system and the survival of aristocratic influence. The repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 won him immense prestige in the country, and his death in 1850 caused a national demonstration of sorrow unprecedented since the death of William Pitt in 1806.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Gash, "Peel, Sir Robert" ''Collier Encyclopedia'' (1996) v 15 p 528.&lt;/ref&gt;}}Peel was the first serving British Prime Minister to have his photograph taken.&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, ''Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830–1850'', 86–87; Ramsay,'' 365.&lt;/ref&gt; Peel is also featured on the cover of [[The Beatles]]' [[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (album)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]] album.

'''Simone Boccanegra''' ({{lang-lij|Scimon Boccaneigra}}, {{lang-it|Simone Boccanegra}}; died 1363) was the first [[Doge of Genoa]]. He became doge in 1339, but was ousted from power six years later. He regained the position in 1356, retaining it until his death in 1363.

His story was popularized by [[Antonio García Gutiérrez]]'s 1843 play ''Simón Bocanegra'' and [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s 1857 opera ''[[Simon Boccanegra]]''. Note the spellings. 
 
==Doge==
Boccanegra was elected doge for life on September 24, 1339, as the candidate of the "popular" [[Ghibelline]] faction. Boccanegra was opposed by the aristocratic [[Guelf]] faction, representing the old mercantile patriciate, which his first actions excluded from public life. With the old patriciate excluded from power, a new class of mercantile houses arose: [[Adorno (family)|Adorno]], [[Guarco]], [[Fregoso]], and [[Montaldo family|Montaldo]].

During Boccanegra's dogate, Genoese control was extended the length of both the [[French Riviera|French]] and [[Italian Riviera|Italian]] Rivieras, with the exception of the [[House of Grimaldi|Grimaldi]] holdings in Monaco and Ventimiglia, and Genoese [[galley]]s went to the aid of [[Alfonso XI of Castile]] in his struggles against the [[Saracen]]s.

There were constant conspiracies and attempts against Boccanegra's life from the outset. (The first conspirator's head rolled on December 20, 1339.) This led to the establishment of a bodyguard of 103 mounted soldiers. For Boccanegra's security these were drawn from [[Pisa]], the inveterate enemy of Genoa, where, however, Simone's brother Niccolò was "captain of the people", their mother having been a Pisan aristocrat.

==Resignation and death==
[[Image:Genova grosso2.jpg|thumb|left|A [[groschen|''denaro grosso'' ("thick penny")]] from the time of Simone Boccanegra]]
Boccanegra was forced to resign his office at a public meeting he had called, December 23, 1344. He was succeeded by [[Giovanni I di Murta]], who died in early January 1350 and then by [[Giovanni II Valente]], who ruled as chief magistrate, until Boccanegra regained power in 1356.

Boccanegra died in 1363, possibly having been poisoned by agents of his enemies.

==In culture==
[[Image:Genova-Palazzo San Giorgio-DSCF7709.JPG|thumb|19th century fresco probably intended to depict Simone Boccanegra, at [[Palazzo San Giorgio]] ([[Genoa]]).]]
The [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] poet [[Petrarch]] wrote letters to the people of Genoa and to the [[doge of Venice]]  appealing to them to end their fratricidal wars and find a common aim. These letters were among Verdi's inspirations for the revision of the opera in 1881.

Simone Boccanegra's tomb in the no longer extant church of San Francesco in [[Castelletto (Genoa)|Castelletto]] was decorated with a remarkable funeral sculpture, depicting him as if [[lying in state]] with extraordinary realism in his features. This sculpture is now in the Museum of Sant'Agostino.

'''Sonia Arrison''' (born September 8, 1972) is an American author of books and articles relating to the impact of [[technology]] on human life,&lt;ref name="SJMN"&gt;"[http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_26533364/silicon-valley-launches-another-bid-hack-aging-cheat Silicon Valley launches another bid to 'hack' aging, cheat death]", ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' (September 14, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; including national bestseller ''100 Plus: How the Coming Age of Longevity Will Change Everything, From Careers and Relationships to Family and Faith'', a book on research into [[life extension]].&lt;ref name="Cha"&gt;Ariana Eunjung Cha, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2015/04/04/tech-titans-latest-project-defy-death/ Tech Titans' Latest Project: Defy Death]", ''[[The Washington Post]]'' (Apr 4, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;"[http://www.pittsburghhealthcarereport.com/march-book-review/ The Bookworm Sez: “100+: How the Coming Age of Longevity Will Change Everything, From Careers and Relationships to Family and Faith” by Sonia Arrison]", ''Health Care Report (Pittsburgh)'' (March 31, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pacific Research Institute==
Born in [[Alberta, Canada]] to a pharmacist mother and a chemical engineer father, Arrison studied political science at the [https://www.ucalgary.ca/ University of Calgary] in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="Sulek"&gt;Julia Prodis Sulek, "[http://scenebayarea.com/2011/04/a-radical-idea/ For Sonia Arrison, longer living through science is inevitable, so we might as well prepare for it]", ''Bay Area Scene'' (April 8, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; She became interested in the political impact of the Internet,&lt;ref name="Sulek"/&gt; which eventually led to her becoming director of technology studies at the [[Pacific Research Institute]], a [[libertarian]] [[think tank]] headquartered in [[San Francisco]], in the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Fairley Raney, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/04/technology/government-watchdog-software-that-sniffs.html Government Watchdog: Software That Sniffs]", ''[[The New York Times]]'' (July 4, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Arrison published a column in the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' opposing San Francisco's adoption of an "open access" policy for cable operators.&lt;ref&gt;Sonia Arrison, "[http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/Let-Market-Decide-Internet-Access-Debate-2780153.php Let Market Decide Internet Access Debate]", ''San Francisco Gateway'' (January 28, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; She also criticized San Francisco's 2006 decision to provide free wireless telecommunications access throughout the city, writing that "[a] city administration that cannot fix our streets, run an effective public transport system, address the tragedy of the homeless and reduce taxes has no business monopolizing the Internet."&lt;ref&gt;Beth Winegarner, "[http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/foster-city-seals-deal-for-free-wi-fi-internet-access/Content?oid=2159424 Foster City seals deal for free Wi-Fi Internet access]", ''San Francisco Examiner'' (June 20, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Arrison described the transparency in pledge and donation amounts to be an important [[open-source]] element of moneybomb success, stating that "[t]hose revelations stand in direct contrast to traditional campaigns, which tend to be silent and proprietary about who is donating."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/Considering-an-Open-Future-60322.html|title=Considering an Open Future|author=Arrison, Sonia|date=2007-11-16|accessdate=2007-12-12|work=TechNewsWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrison was also Chairman of the Board of Governors of [[Lead21]], through which she met her husband, Aydin Senkut,&lt;ref name="Sulek"/&gt; who was "one of Google's first employees".&lt;ref name="Vance"&gt;Ashlee Vacne, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/business/13sing.html?_r=0&amp;pagewanted=all Merely Human? That’s So Yesterday]", ''[[The New York Times]]'' (June 12, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Singularity"&gt;[http://singularityu.org/community/founders/ Singularity University Founders page].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Longevity research and ''100 Plus''==
Arrison was an Associate Founder of [[Singularity University]].&lt;ref name="Vance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Singularity"/&gt; In a 2010 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' interview, she described her motivation for writing ''100 Plus'', which was then a work in progress, and which was described along with Singularity University as "her attempts to ready people for the inevitable".&lt;ref name="Vance"/&gt; "One day we will wake up and say, 'Wow, we can regenerate a new liver'", Ms. Arrison says. "It will happen so fast, and the role of Singularity University is to prepare people in advance".&lt;ref name="Vance"/&gt; ''100 Plus'' "outlines changes that people can expect as life expectancies increase, like 20-year marriages with sunset clauses".&lt;ref name="Vance"/&gt;

''100 Plus'' was published in 2011, with a foreword by [[Peter Thiel]], a longtime friend whom Arrison had introduced to leading life extension researchers.&lt;ref name="Cha"/&gt; Arrison was a speaker at the October 2011 [[Singularity Summit#2011|Singularity Summit]] in New York, and appeared as a guest on ''[[Stossel (TV series)|Stossel]]'' on December 22, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Stossel (TV series)|Stossel]]'', "What a Wonderful World", December 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2012 ''CBS News'' interview, Arrison stated that she was inspired to write ''100 Plus'' after viewing an episode of the U.S. reality TV series, ''[[The Swan (TV series)|The Swan]]'', in which participants were overjoyed to receive a makeover involving relatively minor [[plastic surgery]] procedures. Arrison stated that this got her to thinking about the possible societal changes accompanying the much more substantial changes becoming possible through new medical advances.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Glor, "[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/could-babies-born-today-live-to-150/ Could babies born today live to 150?]", ''[[CBS News]]'' (February 9, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interview noted that while critics worry that increased longevity will spur [[overpopulation]], "[[Aubrey de Grey]] and Sonia Arrison, two leading advocates of life extension and advisers to the Palo Alto Prize, brush these concerns aside".&lt;ref name="SJMN"/&gt; The piece continues, "Arrison notes that the rate of global population expansion is slowing", but "claims that increasing the healthy life span, by extending the sweet spot of adulthood that combines vigor with the wisdom of experience, will give the world's best minds more time to innovate solutions to humanity's problems".&lt;ref name="SJMN"/&gt;

== The Author: Mary Roach ==
Born and raised in New Hampshire, Mary Roach partook in wild activities such as riding a ski-doo and using a rifle. She graduated from Wesleyan University in Connecticut with a degree in psychology, and decided to move after graduating to the opposite side of the country: San Francisco, California. 

After writing updates about the animals and their ailments (she writes “denying rumors the cheetahs had been sucked dry by fleas”) for the San Francisco Zoo, she discovered her passion and dedicated her time to making posts for the Sunday paper. Her talent was recognized and she had posts in multiple top newspapers such as National Geographic, The New York Times, and Vogue. Her first published novel was ''Stiff'', which was made as comedy for readers on a website called Salon.com. Although most of her works focus on science, she admits she does not have formal education in the sciences but enjoys it most. 

==Topics covered==
The book covers 12 topics:

* Practicing [[cosmetic surgery]] on [[cadaver]] heads
* [[Body snatching]] and the early years of human dissection
* The nature of [[decomposition]]
* Cadavers for use as [[crash test dummy|crash test dummies]]
* Using cadavers to analyze a crash site
* Army tests on cadavers
* [[Crucifixion]] experiments
* [[Beating heart cadaver]]s, the [[soul]], and being [[buried alive]]
* [[Decapitation]] and human [[head transplant]]
* [[Cannibalism]] in the name of medicine
* New alternatives to burial and [[cremation]]
* The author's views on her own remains

'''Stop Abuse For Everyone''' ('''SAFE''') is a [[domestic violence]] and conservative lobbying organization started in 1996. It was formed in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] and now is based out of [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], [[California]]. Stop Abuse For Everyone advocates for what they term an "inclusive" model of domestic violence. They state that their focus is on groups that are "lacking in services", such as men, gay, lesbian, and transgender victims, and the elderly.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.safe4all.org Stop Abuse For Everyone]&lt;/ref&gt;

SAFE claims that men are more victimized by physical abuse than women and "men were also the victims of psychological aggression and control over sexual or reproductive health more often than women."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stopabuseforeveryone.org/finding-help/research.html|title=Stop Abuse for Everyone - Research|last=Perwin|first=Jeff|website=www.stopabuseforeveryone.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relevancy ==
Stop Abuse For Everyone is an organization that professes to advocate for the plight of abused men and other "underserved" domestic violence groups, such as LGBT victims.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

SAFE has made appearances at national conferences on domestic violence, media coverage, and lobbies to government entities in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safe4all.org/news/ SAFE News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

SAFE was founded by Jade Rubick in 1996, and became a non-profit organization in 2001 with co-founders Phil Cook and Stanley Green.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.safe4all.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community Organizations ==
SAFE is a national organization. One of the many community organizations working to extend SAFE to the community is [[Women in Distress]] (WID), a nationally accredited, state-certified, full service domestic violence center in [[Broward County, Florida]].

The '''Klyntar''' ([[colloquial]]: '''Symbiotes''') are a fictional species of inorganic, amorphous, multicellular, [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] [[Symbiosis|symbiotes]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The Klyntar bond with their hosts, creating a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] bond through which a single entity is created. They also are able to slightly alter their hosts personalities, by influencing their darkest desires and wants, along with amplifying their physical and emotional traits and personality, granting them super-human abilities.

The first appearance(s) of a symbiote occurs in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #252, ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #90, and ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #141 (released concurrently in May 1984), in which [[Spider-Man]] brings one home to Earth after the [[Secret Wars]] (''Secret Wars'' #8, which was released months later, details his first encounter with it). The concept was created by a Marvel Comics reader,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/05/16/randy-schuellers-brush-with-comic-history/ |title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed Extra: Randy Schueller’s Brush With Comic History &amp;#124; Comics Should Be Good! | publisher=ComicBookResources.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the publisher purchasing the idea for $220.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Shooter|Shooter, Jim]]. [http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/Spidey_005.JPG Offer letter from Marvel Comics], ComicBookResources.com&lt;/ref&gt; The original design was then modified by [[Mike Zeck]], becoming the Venom symbiote. The concept would be explored and used throughout multiple storylines, spin-off comics, and derivative projects.

== Fictional history ==
{{See also|Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Carnage (comics)|Scream (comics)}}

Symbiotes were originally created by an ancient malevolent primordial deity named '''Knull, Lord of the Abyss'''. When the [[Celestials]] began their vast plan to evolve the universe, Knull seeing that his "Kingdom" was being touched, he retaliated by constructing All-Black, the first symbiote, and decapitated a Celestial. Then, the other Celestials banished Knull along with the severed Celestial head in the Void. After that, he started using the blood and the head as a Forge for the symbiotes, where they got the weaknesses of sound and fire (The head would later become [[Knowhere]]). He then went embarking on a genocide against the other gods.&lt;ref&gt;''Venom'' (vol. 4) #4&lt;/ref&gt; When battling the other gods he, crashes on a desolate planet where All-Black left him and went to [[Gorr (comics)#Gorr The Godbutcher|Gorr]], since Gorr was full with hate and tried to kill the other god and Knull.&lt;ref&gt;''Thor: God of Thunder'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; Knull then reawakens and created an army of symbiotes that he used to conquer planets and devour entire civilizations, establishing in the process the Symbiote Imperium.&lt;ref&gt;''Venom'' (vol. 4) #2&lt;/ref&gt; However,when a dragon-like composite went to the medieval Earth, [[Thor (comics)|Thor]] defeated it and destroyed the connection between Knull and the symbiotes. Upon Knull's severed connection to the symbiotes, the symbiote hive-mind began to explore notions of honor and nobility as they bonded to benevolent hosts. The symbiotes subsequently rebelled against their god, imprisoning him at the heart of an artificial planet in the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] they called Klyntar, which is their word for "cage".  Ashamed of their dark past, the symbiotes of Klyntar desired to spread and maintain peace throughout the Cosmos by seeking out worthy hosts from various species in order to create an organization of noble warriors.&lt;ref&gt;''Venom'' (vol. 4) #4&lt;/ref&gt; However, these [[Altruism|altruistic]] goals were imperfect, as the Klyntar symbiotes could be corrupted by hosts with harmful chemical imbalances or problematic personality attributes, turning them into destructive parasites who would spread lies and disinformation about their own kind in order to make other peoples fear and hate the symbiote species as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Brian Michael Bendis|penciller = Valerio Schiti|inker = Valerio Schiti|title = Guardians of the Galaxy|volume = 3|issue = #23|date = 21 January 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The corrupted Klyntar became more widespread than their benevolent counterparts, establishing a spacefaring culture dedicated to infecting and overtaking whole planets. The corrupted Klyntar forced their hosts to perform death-defying feats in order to feed off of the resulting surges of hormones like adrenaline and phenethylamine. These host beings would die quickly, either because of the wear from constant stress and exertion or as a result of the inherent danger in the stunts performed.&lt;ref&gt;''Venom Super Special'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point, a symbiote-run planet was devoured by [[Galactus]]. Due to their [[Genetic memory (biology)|genetic memory]], all symbiotes now loathe both Galactus and his former herald, the [[Silver Surfer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Tom DeFalco|penciller = Joe Bennett|inker = Bud LaRosa|story = Savage Rebirth!/The Carnage Cosmic|title = The Amazing Spider-Man|volume = 1|issue = #430-431|date = 1998 January–February|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; ZZZXX, a symbiote with a predilection for eating brains, was also captured by the [[Shi'ar]], and imprisoned and studied for years until it was released and employed as a [[List of Imperial Guard members#Praetorian|Praetorian Guard]] by [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Gabriel Summers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Chris Yost|penciller = Dustin Weaver|inker = Victor Olazaba and Jaime Mendoza|title = X-Men: Kingbreaker|volume = 1|issue = #2|date = 2009 March|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Secret Wars 8.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The cover of ''[[Secret Wars]]'' #8, which details [[Spider-Man]]'s first encounter with the black costume. Pencil art by Mike Zeck.]]

The [[Kree]] wanting to replicate the [[Skrull]]'s shapeshifting abilities, they got a newborn symbiote which had been outcast from the other symbiotes. They recruited [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)#Tel-Kar|Tel-Kar]] to be bonded to the young symbiote. They modified both Tel-Kar and the symbiote so Tel-Kar could have full control over it. He infiltrated into the Skrulls using the symbiote's shapeshifting ability, but got discovered when he stopped some Skrulls from killing some defenseless Kree refugees. He then deleted the symbiote's memories and separated himself  from it.&lt;ref&gt; ''Venom First Host'' #1-3 &lt;/ref&gt; The symbiote then got trapped in the ship which landed on a planet that would later become part of [[Beyonder]]'s Battleworld where it bonded with [[Spider-Man]].&lt;ref&gt; ''Spider-Man Annual'' #1 (2018) &lt;/ref&gt; Spider-Man returned with the symbiote, where it later bonded with [[Eddie Brock]] in a [[church (building)|church]] calling themselves [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]; during this time, it spawned seven children and a clone, its first child later having three of its own. 
The Venom symbiote gradually grew more and more monstrous and psychotic, that Eddie at some point separated himself from the symbiote causing it to release a telepathic scream, making the other corrupted symbiotes to come to invade the Earth. Then Eddie, Spider-Man and [[Scarlet Spider]] teamed up to fight the invasion and in the end, Eddie rebonded to Venom and released another powerful scream that made the symbiotes commit suicide. 

When bonded to [[Flash Thompson]], who originally struggled to control it, the symbiote developed some slight affection for him.&lt;ref&gt;''Venom'' vol. 2 #4&lt;/ref&gt; It is later established that the host's mental state affects the symbiote just as much as the other way around,&lt;ref&gt;''Venom: Space Knight'' vol. 1 #8&lt;/ref&gt; as Venom's first child, the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] symbiote is as psychotic as its host [[Cletus Kasady]] and the Venom suit's explosiveness got worse after bonding with Angelo Fortunato and [[Mac Gargan]] after Brock, both of which were career criminals. Likewise, the various symbiotes bonded to heroes are not shown to be as twisted, though they occasionally struggle with aggression.

A swarm of [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] that had been overtaken by symbiotes later invade the [[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|S.W.O.R.D.]] satellite and possess all of its inhabitants, but Spider-Man and the [[X-Men]] defeats the symbiotes infected Broods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Elliott Kalan|penciller = Marco Failla|inker = Marco Failla|colorist = Ian Herring|letterer = VC's Clayton Cowles|editor = Katie Kubert|title = Spider-Man and the X-Men|volume = 1|issue = #5|date = 15 April 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Klyntar were later raided by the Poisons with help from Haze Mancer – a symbiote poacher – resulting in the apparent death of the Agents of the Cosmos and the abduction of all the symbiotes.&lt;ref&gt;''Venom'' #163&lt;/ref&gt; The abducted symbiotes were later modified by the Poisons so they could use on the superheroes on Earth in order for the Poisons to consume. After the defeat of the Poisons, the surviving symbiotes were returned to Klyntar.&lt;ref&gt;''Venomized'' #1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

When the body of Grendel, a dragon-like composite symbiote is discovered on Earth,&lt;ref&gt; ''Web of Venom'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; this reawakens Knull enough to allow him to control the creature before being stopped by the combined efforts of Venom and [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)]].&lt;ref&gt;''Venom'' (vol. 4) #3&lt;/ref&gt; And later incinerated by Eddie denying Knull the chance to escape Klyntar.&lt;ref&gt;''Venom'' (vol. 4) #5&lt;/ref&gt;

After some months, a Cult got hold of Cletus's skinless body (after being free from the Poison shell and falling through the atmosphere) inside a chamber and are planning to revive him by using the Grendel's remnants which they stole from [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Maker]].&lt;ref&gt;''Venom #8''. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;
This cult who worships Knull and Carnage as Knull's messenger was led by Scorn. They implanted the remnants inside Cletus reviving him and at first he resembled the possessed Venom, until the Carnage pieces absorbed the ancient symbiote and got Scorn's remnants by killing her. When Cletus came in contact with Knull, he got a new purpose and that was to free Knull and the only way left was to get every single symbiote remnant ('''Codex''') left inside the bodies of every single person, dead or alive who came in contact with the symbiotes on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;''Web of Venom: Carnage Born''. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Powers and abilities ==
[[File:Symbiote Marvel.JPG|thumb|right|The symbiote bonding with a host, which it needs to survive]]
Symbiotes empower a host's natural abilities to the point where they far exceed that of normal members of the host's species. These abilities include the following:
* Superhuman strength (strong enough to lift 50 tons or more), speed, endurance, agility, healing factor, and intelligence.
* Genetic memory, recalling information from previous hosts.
* The ability to negate damage caused by [[terminal illness]]es and permanent injuries. While symbiotes can somewhat heal their hosts, they generally seek to force their hosts to depend on them and thus ensure the symbiotes' survival. For example, Eddie Brock was able to survive indefinitely with terminal cancer, and [[Hybrid (Scott Washington)|Scott Washington]] was able to walk despite being paraplegic. Similarly, [[Flash Thompson]] had received "legs" after bonding with the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote when he lost his legs in a war. 
* Senses that extend over its entire surface, enabling hosts to "see" what is behind or otherwise not in their line of sight.
* Able to change shape and size at will. This ability functions regardless of the host's actual stature and bodily dimensions, as the symbiotes are living tesseracts. This includes expanding to any size as long as they have something to grow on, such as a host or an object. Symbiotes can also get inside of small areas, such as electric wires and the insides of cars to completely disable them. This shapeshifting allows the symbiote to change its color and texture to allow it to blend into the environment as a form of camouflage or change the host's outward appearance (including mimicking clothes).
* Able to sense the thoughts and will of the host. When Spider-Man was originally selected, he had been thinking about [[Julia Carpenter|Spider-Woman's]] costume in the Secret Wars. The symbiote acted on this and formed a similar costume, which is the one seen on him and Venom. 
*Venom and all its descendants possess the ability to bypass Spider-Man's Spider-Sense; because the original symbiote was attached to Peter Parker (Spider-Man) first, it took his genetic information and spider-powers. This means that the symbiote attacking Peter would essentially be Peter attacking himself, which wouldn't set off his Spider-Sense (during the ''Clone Saga'', this became complicated, as Venom and Carnage did set off [[Ben Reilly]]'s Spider-Sense, however this has been attributed to Ben being cloned from Peter prior to his first encounter with the Venom Symbiote).

There are also additional powers that have been demonstrated, but are not necessarily universal to all symbiotes:
* Block part of the host's mind.
* Form fangs or simple bladed weapons out of their limbs. The First appearance of this was the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] symbiote.
* Form tendrils and tentacles of various lengths from their body.
* Form wings, as shown when Venom came in contact with Knull and grew a pair of web-like wings.
* Project the surface of the symbiote to attack at a distance.
* Stick to walls (adapted from [[Spider-Man]]).
* Produce acid, toxins, and venoms, such as in the venomous bite Venom delivered to Sandman (Shown with Venom, Agony and Venom 2099).
* Produce webbing from its own mass (adapted from Spider-Man).
* Sense the presence of other beings within a certain distance.
* Protect hosts from [[Ghost Rider]]'s penance stare.
* Create storage portals inside of them (this allowed Peter Parker to stow and access his camera).
* Filter breathable air for its host, allowing them to breathe underwater (seen in ''Vengeance of Venom''), inhale poisonous fumes, and even survive in the vacuum of space.
* Transfer symbiote traits to its host, such as when Carnage ate Karl Malus and then he became a symbiote-human hybrid.
* The Venom symbiote also has empathic abilities, and is able to project desires and needs into the thoughts of its host or potential hosts; this ability can also aid Venom in detecting the truth from those he interrogates.
* In some realities, the symbiote feeds on the baser emotions of its host, creating an increasingly hostile personality. The longer the host is exposed to the symbiote, the more overpowering this state of mind becomes.
* Each symbiote has its own abilities: such as Venom's venomous bite, and [[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]]'s ability to change his shape and form into a Spiderman-like build (slim, but strong) and Venom-like build (big and muscular) depending on its mood, Scream can use its web-like hair as a weapon, Agony can spit acid and manipulate matter, Phage creates bladed weapons, Lasher uses tendrils on its back, Riot is particular to bludgeoning weapons, Scorn can fuse itself with technology and Sleeper can manipulate chemicals, providing limited telepathy and excelled cloaking abilities through pheromones.
* Some symbiotes have shown to be immune to sonic and fire through modification as shown with Anti-Venom, [[Carnage (comics)#Red Goblin|Red Goblin]] and [[Symbiote (comics)#MC2|Mayhem]]
* It can change the mood of its host by manipulating the brain chemicals.

== Weaknesses ==
*Symbiotes have a natural weakness to sonic-based and heat-based attacks. However, symbiotes have a growing resistance to sound and fire. Still, there has not been an invulnerable symbiote in mainstream continuity, because the newest breeds can be harmed by incredible amounts of sonic waves and heat. Symbiotes in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] are also vulnerable to the heat produced by high voltage electricity.
* Symbiotes have shown vulnerability to chemical and biological attacks, such as when [[Iron Man]] created a virus-like bio-weapon based on the Venom symbiote that could destroy a symbiote. Venom and Carnage, have shown susceptibility to chemical inhibitors. The criminal [[Styx and Stone|Styx]] nearly killed the Venom symbiote with his lethal touch. Whether a symbiote can mutate and reduce the effect of these weaknesses is unknown. 
* Potential hosts with advanced healing factors, such as [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], have shown resistance to symbiosis.
*In some incarnations, the symbiote is depicted as requiring a certain chemical (most likely [[phenethylamine]]) to stay sane and healthy, which has been said to be found abundantly in two sources: chocolate and human brain tissue. Thus, the host is forced to either consume large amounts of chocolate or become a cannibal who devours the brains of those they kill. This peculiar trait has only been witnessed in the Venom symbiote. However, both [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] and [[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]] have threatened their enemies with aspirations to "eating their brains", as well as various other body parts. When Toxin teamed up with Spider-Man and [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], he struggled to keep himself together, telling Spider-Man that he was only "joking" about eating the robbers' brains.
*On at least one occasion, Spider-Man was able to exhaust the Venom symbiote by taking advantage of the fact that it made its webbing out of itself; after the symbiote had already used a great deal of webbing to bind him to a bell, Spider-Man forced Venom to use further webbing so that it would exhaust itself, like blood dripping from a wound (although the sheer amount of webbing that the symbiotes would need to use for this weakness to be exploited makes its use in a fight limited).
*Another weakness that they have is their hunger for feelings. In the storyline Planet of the Symbiotes, [[Eddie Brock]] releases a cry of pain and agony so great that the entire symbiote race commits mass suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Web of Spider-Man Super Special (Vol 1) #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; However, how they kill themselves is not clear.
*The Xenophages, a race of extraterrestrial [[shapeshifters]] which prey on symbiotes, possess the ability to spew an unknown incendiary chemical that can paralyze symbiotes and enhance their taste.&lt;ref&gt;''Venom: The Hunted'' #1-3. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;
* When Eddie Brock was diagnosed with cancer, [[Mister Negative|Martin Lee]] used his healing ability to cure Eddie from his cancer and accidentally making the Venom symbiote's cells in Eddie's blood to fuse with the white blood cells creating a new non-sentient Symbiote called [[Anti-Venom (symbiote)|Anti-Venom]]. This symbiote had the ability to cure every sickness and also it's was [[corrosive]] to the symbiotes as shown when Eddie and Flash nearly killed Venom,&lt;ref&gt;Amazing Spider-Man New Ways to Die&lt;/ref&gt; the Poisons&lt;ref&gt;Venomized&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Carnage (comics)#Red Goblin|Red Goblin]].&lt;ref&gt;Amazing Spider-Man #799&lt;/ref&gt; There have been no symbiotes shown to be immune to Anti-Venom.
*A new and still mysteriously extraterrestrial race known as '''Poisons''', apparently nature's answer to the symbiotes, prey on them through direct contact infection, which forms an unstoppable one-sided union that the symbiote wants no part of.&lt;ref&gt;''Venomverse'' #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

| '''[[Scream (comics)|Scream]]'''
|rowspan="5"| ''[[Venom: Lethal Protector]]'' #4 (May 1993)
|rowspan="5"|  In an attempt to create "super-cops" to police their new Utopia, the [[Life Foundation]] probed the Venom symbiote and extracted the last five of its "seeds" – the materials used to create its spawn. These were cultured and bonded to five of the Life Foundation's best security personnel to form the Guardians: Donna Diego (Scream), Carl Mach (Phage), Leslie Gesneria (Agony), Trevor Cole (Riot), and Ramon Hernandez (Lasher).

In the comics none of the five symbiotes were originally given names. However, in the ''Venom: Planet of the Symbiotes'' toy line, the yellow symbiote was named Scream and the green symbiote was named Lasher. The name Scream was eventually used in ''Marvel Super Hero Island Adventures'' #1 and the ''Spider-Man Back in Black Handbook''. The toyline also featured a four armed symbiote named Riot that was loosely based on the unnamed symbiote in the comic ''What if Scarlet Spider killed Spider-Man?''. The name Phage comes from an unrelated character from the comic ''Venom The Hunted'' and ''Venom: Along Came A Spider'' toyline.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Vandal. [http://archive.li/b0cog ComixFan Forum – "Things people keep getting wrong", p. 5], ''http://www.comixfan.net/ X-World Comics Presents . . . Comixfan, the #1 Online Comics Resource!''

Accessed November 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The other symbiote names became popular among fans but did not appear in an official Marvel work until the 2011 ''Carnage U.S.A.'' mini-series.

Mach, Cole, Hernandez, and Gesneria were all murdered by Diego after she decided that symbiotes were "evil"; the murdered guards' symbiotes fused to create Hybrid.&lt;ref name="Carnage U.S.A. #2"&gt;''Carnage U.S.A.'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; Diego would later herself be killed by a powerless Eddie Brock, when the latter was also eliminating the "evil" of the symbiotes from the Earth.

== Other versions ==
=== Ultimate Marvel ===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, the Venom suit is a man-made creation born of an experiment by [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker]] and [[Eddie Brock|Edward Brock, Sr.]] to develop a protoplasmic cure for [[cancer]]. It used Richard's DNA as the starting base for it, thus himself and Peter are "related" to it. The suit when bonds to a host, it hardens it's surface and the emerges from the "shell" like a [[pupa]] and enhances the wearer's strength and natural abilities, but also attempts to permanently bond even more with the host and can affect their mind. The Ultimate symbiote is seemingly weak only to electricity. When worn by a host other than Richard's son Peter, the Ultimate Spider-Man, the host is compelled to devour the life energy of other human beings or else have their own be consumed by the suit instead. &lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #33-36&lt;/ref&gt;

It is hinted in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' video game that the plane crash that killed Peter's parents was caused by Eddie Sr. with Venom. 

The Carnage symbiote also appears in the Ultimate universe as a parasite genetically engineered by [[Lizard (comics)|Curt Conners]] from Peter's DNA based on Richard's research. Traces of the Venom suit remaining in Peter's blood give Carnage similar properties to the Venom suit. It also devours people, but does not require a host. It is killed after being consumed by fire following its attempt to absorb Peter to become whole. It later reappears in the form of Gwen Stacy, and during an encounter with Venom, the latter absorbs the Carnage suit into itself, making Venom "complete" though more monstrous than ever before and getting a white spider symbol.&lt;ref name="USM 128"&gt;''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #128&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spider-Gwen ===
In [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Gwen]]'s universe, Dr. Elsa Brock created a cure to [[Harry Osborn]]'s Lizard DNA by using Spider-Gwen's radioactive isotopes. When Gwen injected the isotopes in Harry, the Lizard serum combined with the Spider isotopes and transformed into Venom which bonded to Spider-Gwen giving her powers back and becoming ''Gwenom''. This symbiote is weak to sonic only when bonded to a host, otherwise is not affected by sonic when without a host.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Gwen'' (vol)2 #24&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amalgam Comics ===
In this universe, the facility which created [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#Amalgam Comics|Spider-Boy]], started experimenting on a substance which they got from an alien spaceship. Accidentally, they created a crystalline symbiote named '''Bizarrnage''' (amalgamation of Carnage and [[Bizarro (comics)|Bizarro]]). It had the powers of Spider-Boy and started attacking everyone until Spider-Boy defeated it.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Boy'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MC2 ===
In an alternate universe, [[Norman Osborn]] got Eddie's blood, who was still bonded to Venom at the time, and extracted the symbiote cells from the blood. Then, Norman combined the cells with May's DNA and created a symbiote/human hybrid clone of [[Mayday Parker]]. The clone stayed in stasis inside a chamber, until Peter with Norman's mind became Goblin God and awakens the hybrid. When Peter got back to normal, the hybrid under the alias of '''Mayhem/Spider-Girl''' went to live with the Parker's family, naming herself April Parker.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Girl'' #20&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later timeline, [[Alternative versions of Venom#MC2|Mayhem]] accidentally kills the real Spider-Girl and became a murderous vigilante after killing [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]]. The government in an attempt to stop her, they used pieces of the dead Carnage symbiote (after being killed by Mayday) to create living weapons dubbed '''Biopreds'''. The [[Carnage (comics)#MC2|Biopreds]] run wild, however, decimating the world and its defenders. Mayhem, seeing the error of her ways, goes back in time and sacrifices herself to stop her past self from killing Spider-Girl, ensuring the events that led to the Biopreds' creation never occurred, even though she may have survived.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Girl: The End''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spider-Verse ===
During [[Spider-Verse]], in Spider-Punk's universe, V.E.N.O.M also known as '''Variable Engagement Neuro-sensitive Organic Mesh''' is  created by [[Oscorp]] and is worn by the Thunderbolt Department, the police and fire department of President Osborn so he could control the city better, but they are later defeated by Spider-Punk using his guitar.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Verse'' #2 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spider-Geddon ===
During [[Spider-Geddon]], in the universe of Peni Parker, aka [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#SP//dr|SP//dr]], ''Ven#m'' is a giant mech-suit, powered by a '''Sym Engine''', created to serve as back-up in case the SP//dr failed. It was piloted by ''Addy Brock'' until in a battle against a technological monster named [[Morbius the Living Vampire#Spider-Geddon|M.O.R.B.I.U.S.]], the suit gained a conscience and went rogue. Though SP//dr was able to defeat Ven#m, she was too late to stop it from consuming Addy as well as her version of [[Aunt May]], who flew in to fix the problem manually.&lt;ref&gt;''Edge of Spider-Geddon'' #2 (2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

===What If...===
====...Spider-Man had rejected the Spider? ====
This one-shot issue presents a different approach to the events of ''[[Spider-Man: The Other]]'', where after battling [[Morlun]], Peter Parker dies and is resurrected with greater spider powers. Instead, Peter rejects the chance to rise again and leaves his body and spirit separated. This leaves his body open to a complete takeover by the Venom symbiote. The suit quickly abandons its latest host, Mac Gargan, as soon as it senses Peter's vulnerable state and rushes to once again unite with its first human host. After entering a [[cocoon (silk)|cocoon]] which contained Peter's body, the symbiote fully bonds with Peter, turning him into a violent hybrid monster called [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#What If...|Poison]] (not the white [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#P|Poisons]]) with the powers of the Other. Poison now calling himself "I", chooses Mary Jane to be his companion, not caring if she would come dead or alive, since he has power to bring people to life. After dispatching the Avengers who rush to her aid, Watson offers herself willingly to prevent any further harm to the people protecting and promises Poison that she will give her body but not her soul and make Poison's life miserable. This seems to leave Poison heartbroken or disappointed and he flees. Instead, he digs up the grave of [[Gwen Stacy]]. The last images reveals Poison watching over a new cocoon like his own, but crimson colored, as it bursts forth showing a hand similar to Carnage's, even though the normal symbiotes are unable to bond with dead hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| writer=[[David, Peter]] | penciller=Pham, Khoi|inker=[[Florea, Sandu]] | story=What if Spider-Man had rejected the Spider? - Poison Selves|title=What If| volume=3| issue=2|date=November 2006|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] | page=| panel=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Age of Apocalypse ====
In a "What if?" [[Age of Apocalypse]] reality, in which both [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] and [[Magneto (comics)|Eric Lensherr]] were killed, Apocalypse is served by clones of a symbiote Spider-Man, although the clones seem to be more symbiote than man.&lt;ref&gt;''[[What If (comics)#Volume 5|What if?: Age of Apocalypse]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

June 2017, [[Amy Pascal]] revealed in an interview that the film would have connections to ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' and the rest of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] as an "adjunct" film, with [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] possibly reprising his role as Spider-Man in ''Venom'' as well as future spin-off films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://screenrant.com/venom-silver-sable-spider-man-homecoming-movies-connections/|title=Venom &amp; Black Cat Movies Will Be 'Adjuncts' to the MCU's Spider-Man|date=2017-06-18|work=Screen Rant|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the international teaser trailer, the Venom symbiote was seen in a glass capsule, before Venom himself is revealed at the end of the first trailer. [[Riot (comics)|Riot]] appeared as the film's main antagonist, played by [[Riz Ahmed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/venom-villain-will-be-riot-tom-hardy-reveals-at-comic-con-1128276|title='Venom' Unveils Villain at Comic-Con|last=Couch|first=Aaron|date=July 20, 2018|website=hollywoodreporter|accessdate=July 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the context of the storyline, Venom, Riot and two other unnamed symbiotes labeled as "Blue" and "Yellow" were discovered by a Life Foundation shuttle when they detected signs of life on a comet they passed during a deep-space mission. The shuttle retrieved the four symbiotes to bring back to Earth, only for one to escape capture when the shuttle crashes, allowing it to escape by continuously entering into different hosts. Life Foundation head Carlton Drake attempts to experiment with the remaining symbiotes in the belief that linking man and symbiote will allow humanity to survive on other worlds. Months later one of his scientists reveals the truth to Eddie Brock, whose career as a journalist was ruined when he tried to confront Drake about allegations of possible deaths related to Drake's tests. While investigating Drake's facility, Eddie bonds with the Venom symbiote, becoming the first to achieve true symbiosis, becoming more important to Drake's plans after the other two symbiotes die during the experiment. The fourth symbiote, identified by Venom as Riot, reaches the Life Foundation and possesses Drake with the goal of bringing more symbiotes to Earth to conquer the planet. Meanwhile, Brock's ex-fiancé, [[Anne Weying]], and her boyfriend use high frequencies to disconnect Brock from Venom after they discover that it is rotting his internal organs, slowly killing him. After Brock is captured by Drake's men to retrieve Venom, Weying dons the symbiote and uses it to rescue Brock, transferring it back to him. Venom reveals that he wants to stay on Earth to protect it because on his home planet he is seen as "kind of a loser", and that Brock has helped him see the worth of humanity. Venom and Brock manage to defeat Riot by cutting a large tear in the rocket which Riot and Drake were using to retrieve the other symbiotes, causing it to explode, killing them both and seemingly killing Venom in the process. Months later, Brock and Venom (who had somehow survived in Brock) have come to an agreement that Venom would only ever harm "bad guys" and the two kill a local gang member threatening Mrs. Chen (a shop owner who is a friend of Brock's) for protection money.

At the end of the film, Brock is sent to interview an incarcerated serial killer named Cletus Kasady, who states that if (and when) he escapes, "there's gonna be Carnage."

{{Citation needed section|date=August 2017}}
* In the arcade title ''[[Spider-Man: The Video Game]]'' after the defeat of [[Dr. Doom]], the final boss fight consists of a battle against an infinite number of Doom-created symbiote clones. All the clones can be killed, but there is one "prime clone" with much more life. Defeating this clone is the only way to win.
* In the N64/PlayStation title ''[[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|Spider-Man]]'', the symbiotes become the more common enemy after the player rescues Mary Jane and heads back to the ''Daily Bugle''. The fastest way to kill these symbiotes is to find a fire-imbued web cartridge. It is revealed that [[Doctor Octopus]] and Carnage plan to unleash the symbiotes on all of humanity and rule a new world order.
* The symbiote family are major characters in the video game ''[[Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety]]''.
* Venom appears as the final boss in ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series (video game)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''.
* Venom appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' video game (for Game Boy Advance) as a playable character. Carnage appears too, but as a boss, Venom also appears as a boss a few times when playing as Spider-Man.
* Venom is a playable character in ''[[Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects]]''.
* In the ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]'' video game, Shriek appears. Shriek's powers come from a symbiote in this game which is also black in color. However, the symbiote only covers half of her body. This is only found on the [[Wii]]/[[PlayStation 2|PS2]] versions of the game.
* In ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]'', Venom returns to New York. During a fight with Venom, the Symbiote suddenly reproduces and the spawn bonds with Spider-Man creating a replica of the Black Suit, but with considerably more Carnage-like abilities such as projecting bladed tentacles. Over the course of the game, Venom creates symbiote "seed-pods" in various locations around the city which absorb passing civilians and infect them with various types of symbiote ranging from '''Snatcher Symbiotes''' (the small black Symbiotes that drag unsuspecting victims to the "seed-pods"), '''Zombie Symbiotes''' (the weak white Symbiotes), '''Berserker Symbiotes''' (the red shiny Symbiotes), '''Grappler Symbiotes''' (black and red versions of the Berserkers), and '''Slasher Symbiotes''' (the white and pink Symbiotes). The Symbiotes even manage to infect [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. Symbiote-Electro and Symbiote-Vulture go on to spawn other symbiotes with powers similar to their hosts resulting in '''Electrolings''' and '''Vulturelings'''. All are eventually defeated by Spider-Man and the symbiotes are separated from them.
* In ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'', the Ultimate Marvel version of Spider-Man in his symbiote suit is a playable character. [[Madame Web]] had restored the black suit as it provides this world's Peter Parker with additional abilities that he will require to succeed in his mission, while she uses her psychic abilities to prevent the suit attempting to take over his mind. However, Madame Web's abilities do not seem to be absolute, as Ultimate Spider-Man experiences occasional bouts of anger. Also, the Ultimate version of Carnage appears as the final boss in the Ultimate levels where it was granted the ability to reanimate its victims into symbiotic zombie-like creatures thanks to the powers of a fragment of the Tablet of Order and Chaos when S.H.I.E.L.D. are foolishly mixing the fragment with Carnage.
* In ''[[Spider-Man: Edge of Time]]'', it is revealed that the brainwashed Anti-Venom is responsible for killing present day [[Spider-Man]], altering the future of the ''[[Marvel 2099]]'' timeline and prompting [[Spider-Man 2099]] to tamper with the timeline further in order to save his predecessor's life and repair the timestream. In one of their battles, Anti-Venom, Doctor Octopus (who in the new timeline was never a villain, but still uses his trademark arms) and game exclusive villain Dr. Walker Sloan (the man from 2099 who tried to alter the timeline) are knocked into a portal and become '''Atrocity''' (vocal effects provided by [[Fred Tatasciore]]), a bloated version of Anti-Venom with tentacles. Both Atrocity and the future Peter Parker are defeated with the time resetting presumably separating Atrocity back into Walker Sloan, Anti-Venom, and Doctor Octopus.
* Two versions of the black suit appear as an optional costume in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' video game, based on its appearance in the ''Spider-Man 3'' film, and a modified version of Spider-Man's costume from ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' film. Backstory for the game also reveals that the game version of the Symbiote is based on a "black goo" recovered from space and that it is bonded with the game's version of the Scorpion. This is an allusion to the comics, where Mac Gargan briefly assumed the role of Venom.
* Symbiote Scientists appear in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]''.
* Various Symbiote characters such are featured in the mobile game ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (video game)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' with the Symbiote World featured as a level.
* The Symbiote family appeared in the [[Facebook]] game ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]'', it featured [[Mac Gargan|Venom]], [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]], [[Eddie Brock|Anti-Venom]], [[Scream (comics)|Scream]], and [[Hybrid (Scott Washington)|Hybrid]].
* Symbiotes "connect together" in a ''[[Marvel Puzzle Quest]]'' storyline. Besides Mac Gargan and Eddie Brock as Venom and Cletus Kasady's Carnage, there are four new Symbiotes: A green male named '''Carrier''', an orange female named '''Horror''', a teal teethy creature named '''Demolisher''', and a magenta dog-like creature named '''Mutation'''.
* A Symbiote creature appears in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite]]''. In the game's story, [[Jedah Dohma]] uses the [[Infinity Gems|Soul Stone]] to steal a million souls from Earth and feed them to a Giant Symbiote, planning to strengthen it and use it as a weapon against [[Ultron]] [[Sigma (Mega Man X)|Sigma]]. When [[Chris Redfield]] tries attacking it, he accidentally causes part of the symbiote to bond to Spider-Man, forcing the latter to fight against [[Frank West (Dead Rising)|Frank West]] and [[Mike Haggar]] against his will (though the symbiote is removed after Frank causes some car alarms to go off). The creature is unleashed on New Metro City, but is destroyed by the heroes using three of the Infinity Stones. Venom also appears as a playable character via [[downloadable content]].
* In ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]]'', during a conversation between Spider-Man and [[Yuri Watanabe]], she quickly ask Spider-Man as a joke if he has a black and white suit indicating that Spider-Man at some point had a black suit but he got rid of it. In the post credit scene [[Norman Osborn]] goes into a secret lab inside his house where it shows his son [[Harry Osborn]], inside a chamber labeled G-35 with black web-like substance attached to his body. When Spider-Man looks through certain windows there is a few collectibles on a shelf, including a black suit Spider-Man figure.
* In ''[[Marvel: Contest of Champions]]'', [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] and [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] appears as a playable characters.

'''Waterfowl hunting''' (also called '''wildfowling''' or '''waterfowl shooting''' in the UK) is the practice of [[hunting]] [[duck]]s, [[geese]], or other [[waterfowl]] for [[Game (food)|food]] and [[sport]]. In many western countries, commercial waterfowl hunting is prohibited, and duck hunting is primarily an [[Outdoor activity|outdoor sporting activity]].

Many types of ducks and geese share the same habitat, have overlapping or identical [[hunting season]]s, and are hunted using the same methods. Thus it is possible to take different species of waterfowl in the same outing. Waterfowl can be hunted in crop fields where they feed, or, more frequently, on or near bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, ponds, swamps, sloughs, or oceanic coastlines.

==History==

===Prehistoric waterfowl hunting===
Wild [[waterfowl]] have been hunted for food, [[Down feathers|down]], and [[feather]]s worldwide since prehistoric times. Ducks, geese, and [[swan]]s appear in European cave paintings from the last [[Ice Age]], and a mural in the [[Ancient Egyptian]] tomb of [[Khum-Hotpe]] (c. 1900 BC) shows a man in a [[hunting blind]] capturing swimming ducks in a trap. [[Muscovy duck]]s were depicted in the art of the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] culture of ancient [[Peru]] by 200 BC, and were likely hunted by many people of the [[Americas]] before then.&lt;ref&gt;''Waterfowl Ecology and Management'' (1994) by Guy A. Baldassarre, Eric G. Bolen, D. Andrew Saunders, Pp. 3-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rise of modern waterfowl hunting===
Hunting with shotguns began in the 17th century with the matchlock shotgun. Later flintlock shotguns and percussion cap guns were used.  Shotguns were loaded with black powder and lead shot through the muzzle in the 17th century to the late 19th century.  The transition from flint to "detonating" or [[Caplock mechanism|percussion lock]] firearms and from muzzle to breech loading guns was largely driven by innovations made by English gun makers such as [[Joseph Manton]], at which time  wildfowling was extremely popular in England both as a pastime and as a means of earning a living, as described by [[Colonel Peter Hawker|Peter Hawker]] in his diaries.&lt;ref&gt;The diary of Colonel Peter Hawker, (Volume I) 1802-1853&lt;/ref&gt; Damascus barrels are safe to shoot (where proofed) only with black powder charges.  When smokeless powder was invented in the late 19th century, steel barrels were made.  Damascus barrels which were made of a twisted steel could not take the high pressure of smokeless powder. Fred Kimble, Tanner, and Adam, duck hunters from Illinois, invented the shotgun [[Choke (firearms)|choke]] in 1886. This is a  constriction at the end of the barrel.  This allowed for longer range shooting with the shotgun and kept the pattern of shot tighter or looser according to which type of choke is being used. Until 1886, shotguns had cylinder bore barrels which could only shoot up to 25 yards, so duck hunting was done at close range. After 1886, [[market hunters]] could shoot at longer ranges up to forty five yards with a full choke barrel and harvest more waterfowl.  Shotguns became bigger and more powerful as steel barrels were being used, so the range was extended to sixty yards.
[[File:Franc Anton Steinberg - Lov na race; čakališče na jezeru pri jami Lisišče.jpg|thumb|300px|''Lov na race; čakališče na jezeru pri jami Lisišče'' (1759) by [[Franz Anton von Steinberg]] which depicts waterfowl hunting.]]

Pump shotguns were invented in the late 19th century, and the semi automatic 12 ga. shotgun was developed by John Browning in the very early 20th century, which allowed commercial hunters to use a four-shell magazine (five including the one in the chamber) to rake rafts of ducks on the water or kill them at night, in order to kill larger numbers of waterfowl for the commercial markets. Even during the Great Depression years, a brace of canvasbacks could be sold to restaurants before legislation and hunting organizations pushed for greater enforcement.  Once waterfowlers had access to these guns, this made these men more proficient  market hunters.  These guns could fire five to seven shots, therefore hunters were having bigger harvests.

Early European settlers in America hunted waterfowl with great zeal, as the supply of waterfowl seemed unlimited in the coastal Atlantic regions.  During the fall migrations, the skies were filled with waterfowl.  Places such as Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay, and Barnaget Bay were hunted extensively.

As more immigrants came to America in the late 18th and 19th centuries, the need for more food became greater.  Market hunting started to take form, to supply the local population living along the Atlantic coast with fresh ducks and geese.  Men would go into wooden boats and go out into the bays hunting, sometimes with large shotguns.  They would bring back a wooden  barrel or two of ducks each day. Live ducks were used as decoys as well as bait such as corn or other grain to attract waterfowl.

The rise of modern waterfowl hunting is tied to the history of the [[shotgun]], which shoots a pattern of round pellets making it easier to hit a moving target. In the 19th century, the seemingly limitless flocks of ducks and geese in the [[Atlantic Flyway|Atlantic]] and [[Mississippi Flyway]]s of [[North America]] were the basis for a thriving commercial waterfowl hunting industry. With the advent of [[punt gun]]s&amp;nbsp;– massive, boat-mounted shotguns that could fire a half-pound of lead shot at a time&amp;nbsp;– hunters could kill dozens of birds with a single blast. This was the four and six gauge shotgun. This period of intense commercial waterfowl hunting is vividly depicted in [[James Michener]]'s [[historical novel]] ''[[Chesapeake (novel)|Chesapeake]]''.

Although edible, swans are not hunted in many Western cultures due to hunting regulations, and swans were historically a [[Swan Upping|royal prerogative]].  Swans are hunted in the Arctic regions.

===Conservation and the Duck Stamp Act===
{{Globalize/US|date=December 2010}}

Around the start of the 20th century, commercial hunting  and loss of habitat due to agriculture led to a decline in duck and goose populations in North America, along with many other species of wildlife. The [[Lacey Act]] of 1900, which outlawed transport of [[poaching|poached]] [[Game (meat)|game]] across state lines, and the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]], which prohibited the possession of [[migratory bird]]s without permission (such as a [[hunting license]]), marked the dawn of the modern [[conservation movement]].

In 1934, at the urging of [[editorial cartoonist]] and [[conservation movement|conservationist]] [[Jay Norwood Darling|J.N. "Ding" Darling]], the United States government passed the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act, better known as the [[Federal Duck Stamp]] Act. This program required hunters to purchase a special stamp, in addition to a regular hunting license, to hunt migratory waterfowl. This stamp cost two dollars in 1934 but today the price is twenty-five dollars. As of 2007 there is also an "E-duck" stamp available for seventeen dollars where duck hunting is immediately authorized and the physical stamp is mailed later.[http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/newsmedia/releases/?req=20070810c] The stamp is valid from July 1 to June 30 of each year.  The stamp may be raised to twenty dollars in the near future.
Revenues from the stamp program provided the majority of funding for conservation for many decades.  The stamp funded the purchase of 4.5 million acres (18,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of [[National Wildlife Refuge]] land for waterfowl habitat since the program's inception in 1934.  The Duck Stamp act has been described as "one of the most successful conservation programs ever devised."&lt;ref&gt;"Artistic License- The Duck Stamp Story." [[Smithsonian]] [[National Postal Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt; Duck stamps have also become collectible items in their own right.  Stamps must not be signed to be of value.[http://www.hwcn.org/link/ndscs/]

England sold its first duck stamp in 1991, featuring ten pintails flying along the coast of England.  The stamp cost five English pounds.

==Species of waterfowl hunted==
In North America a variety of ducks and geese are hunted, the most common being [[mallard]]s, [[Canada geese]],  [[snow geese]], [[canvasback]], [[Redhead (duck)|redhead]], [[Northern pintail|pintail]], [[gadwall]], [[ruddy duck]], [[harlequin duck|harlequin]], common, hooded and red-breasted [[merganser]] (often avoided because of its reputation as a poor-eating bird with a strong flavor). Also hunted are [[American black duck|black duck]], [[wood duck]], blue wing [[teal]], green wing teal, [[bufflehead]], [[shoveler]], [[widgeon]], and [[Goldeneye (duck)|goldeneye]]. Ocean ducks include [[oldsquaw]], [[eider duck]], and [[scoter]].

[[Swan]]s are hunted in only a few states in the United States, and in the UK (where they are historically considered a [[Swan upping|royal prerogative]]), but are hunted along with other wildfowl in many other countries.

In the Australian states of Tasmaina, Victoria, South Australia and the Northern Territory, species hunted under permit include the [[Pacific black duck]], [[Australian wood duck]], [[chestnut teal]], [[grey teal]], [[pink-eared duck]] and [[Australian shelduck|mountain duck]].

Since 1990, recreational duck hunting on public land has been banned in Western Australia but it still allows Australian wood ducks to be shot on private property throughout the year with few restrictions.

==Modern hunting techniques==
[[File:Group of duck hunters on lake.jpg|thumb|250px|Three waterfowl hunters donned in [[camouflage]] and armed with shotguns.]] 
The waterfowl hunting season is generally in the autumn and winter. Hunting seasons are set by the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] in the United States.  In the autumn, the ducks and geese have finished raising their young and are migrating to warmer areas to feed. The hunting seasons usually begin in October and end in January.  Extended goose seasons can go into April, the Conservation Order by the U.S.F.W.S.

There are four large flyways in the United States that the waterfowl follow: the Atlantic, Mississippi, Central and Pacific Flyways.

There are several items used by almost all waterfowl hunters: a shotgun, ammunition, a [[hunting blind]], [[decoy]]s, a boat, and a duck or goose call. The decoys are used to lure the birds within range, and the blind conceals the hunter. When a hunter or hunters sees the waterfowl, he or she begins calling with the duck or goose call. Once the birds are within range, the hunters rise  from the blind and quickly shoot the birds before they are frightened off and out of shooting range.  Duck or goose calls are often used to attract birds; sometimes calls of other birds will also be simulated to convince the birds that there is no danger.

Hunters position themselves in blinds near rivers, lakes, ponds or in agriculture fields planted with corn, barley, wheat or millet. Hunters build blinds to conceal themselves from waterfowl, as waterfowl have sharp eyes and can see colors.  That is why hunters use [[camouflage]]. Waterfowl hunters also often use dogs to retrieve dead or injured birds in the water. There are many [[retriever]] breeds, such as [[Labrador Retriever]]s and [[Chesapeake Bay Retriever]]s, specifically bred for the task.  Hunters also may use a boat to get downed birds.
Some hunters use boats as blinds or float rivers in search of waterfowl.  When the ducks see the hunters in the boat, ducks flush off the water and hunters shoot.  Then birds are collected and placed in the boat.

Each hunter prefers a certain type of weather condition, depending on the type of hunting setting.  Some hunters prefer sunny days vs cloudy or rainy days.  However, ducks and geese fly more extensively and actively on cloudy days, rain or snow.  There is an old hunters tale that if you see swans flying, ducks will be close behind.

===Shotguns===
[[File:Firing a shot from punt YORYM-S238.jpg|thumb|Firing a shot from a boat-mounted [[punt gun]] in [[Yorkshire]], UK {{circa|1910}} ]]
In the days of market hunting, [[punt gun]]s, four (4) gauge, six (6) gauge, eight (8) gauge and ten (10) gauge shotguns were used in hunting. Modern sport hunters are more likely to use ten (10), twelve (12), sixteen (16), or twenty (20) gauge shotguns. Punt guns, along with both the four and six gauge were mounted to small boats due to their weight and recoil. The eight gauge was hand held at about fourteen pounds in weight with approximately 2.5 ounces of shot. The largest gun used today in the United States is the 10 gauge shotgun, shooting a 3.5 inch shell that holds up to 2.5 ounces of shot. These shotguns can kill ducks at up to 60 yards. By far the most common modern shotgun used for waterfowl hunting is the twelve gauge. With the development of higher-pressure 3.5 inch shells, [[Gauge (bore diameter)|12 gauge]] shotguns can deliver close to the power and shot load of a ten gauge out of a lighter gun with less recoil. Modern sixteen gauge shotguns are rare, with more people choosing the higher power twelve gauge or lower recoil of the twenty gauge. [[20-gauge shotgun|20 gauge]] shotguns are less commonly used for long-range waterfowl hunting, but are preferred by hunters who do not like the weight of the twelve gauge. 28 gauge and [[.410 bore]] shotguns are rarely used due to the gun's inability to ensure clean kills at ranges of 40 to 50 yards. Some hunting guns have camouflage-patterned stocks and low-gloss finishes on the metal to reduce their visibility to waterfowl.

Although it is legal to use a [[archery|bow]] to take migratory waterfowl in many areas, most hunters prefer taking migratory birds with a shotgun because of the great difficulty of striking a moving bird with an arrow.  Taking migratory birds with a handgun, carbine, or rifle is illegal due to the great distances that bullets travel, making them unsafe.

===Shotgun ammunition===

Since the 16th century, lead shot has been used in waterfowl hunting. Lead shot was originally poured down the barrel. Later, shells were made of paper and brass in the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century.  In the early 1960s, manufacturers began making shotshells of plastic. In the late 1960s, it was determined that lead shot poisoned waterfowl eating in shallow water areas where there was heavy hunting.  In 1974, steel shot shells were offered for sale to hunters at the Brigantine Waterfowl Refuge in southern New Jersey, and at Union County State Fish &amp; Wildlife area in Union County, Illinois, by Winchester at five dollars a box.  These shells were marked "Experimental" and were orange in color.

Waterfowl hunting with lead shot, along with the use of lead sinkers in [[angling]], has been identified as a major cause of [[lead poisoning]] in waterfowl, which often feed off the bottom of lakes and wetlands where lead shot collects.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Glen C. and Frank C. Bellrose.  1986.  A Review of the Problem of Lead Poisoning in Waterfowl. Illinois Natural History Survey, Champaign, Illinois. Special Publication 4. 34pp. [https://web.archive.org/web/19990422091004/http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/othrdata/pbpoison/pbpoison.htm full report from scholar.google.com (cache)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.M. Scheuhammer and S. L. Norris. 1996. "The ecotoxicology of lead shot and lead fishing weights" ''[[Ecotoxicology]]'' Vol. 5 Number 5 pp. 279-295&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, UK, Canada, and many western European countries (France as of 2006), all shot used for [[waterfowl]] must now be non-toxic, and therefore may not contain any [[lead]]. [[Steel]] is the cheapest alternative to lead. However, some hunters do not like its shooting properties, as steel is significantly less dense than lead.  Therefore, its effective range is decreased due to rapidly decreasing velocity of the shot: thirty to forty yards is considered its maximum effective range for duck hunting.  Many companies have improved steel shot by increasing muzzle-velocity, by using fast burning powder such as rifle powder thus making more consistent 'shot' or pellet patterns. Steel shot now travels at 1400 to 1500 feet per second. However, any use of steel shot requires a shotgun barrel with thicker walls and a specially-hardened bore, resulting in a heavier gun.

Within recent years, several companies have created "heavier than lead" non-toxic shot out of [[tungsten]], [[bismuth]], or other elements with a density similar to or greater than lead. These shells have more consistent patterns and greater range than steel shot. The increase in performance comes at a higher cost. Shell boxes can cost up to thirty dollars a box for twenty five shells.

Hunters use pellet sizes 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, or BB for ducks, and 2, BB, BBB or T shot for geese.  [[Buckshot]] is legal.

===Blinds===
[[Image:Bgforhunting.jpg|thumb|250px|Duck hunters in a [[hunting blind]]. Decoys are visible in the water to the right.]]
A hunting blind is a structure intended to conceal hunters, dogs, and equipment from the intended prey.  Blinds can be temporary or permanent.

A blind may be constructed out of plywood, lumber, large logs or branches, burlap fiber, plastic or cotton camouflage, or natural vegetation.  Many of these permanent blinds look like a small shack with an opening that faces the water and a portion of the sky. Blinds can be as simple as natural vegetation piled onto branches, or they can be small outbuildings with benches, tables, heaters, and other conveniences.

Temporary blinds are common in protected and public areas where permanent fixture blinds are forbidden. Many are tent-like "pop-up" blinds which are quick and easy to erect. Boat blinds are used to conceal a hunter while hunting from a boat. Boat blinds can be handmade or are available from manufacturers.

There are two common types of blinds for land and field-based waterfowl hunting: pit blinds and layout blinds. The pit blind can be a solid structure that is placed into a hole in the ground or on the bank of a waterbody. Since pit blinds rest below the top of the surrounding soil, some structural strength is required to prevent the soil from collapsing into the blind.  Commercially available blinds can be made from fiberglass, polyethylene or even lightweight metals.  Homemade blinds can also be constructed of wood, but typically cannot withstand the moisture of an underground habitat.  Concrete walls are also constructed to form pit blinds typically on land owned or controlled by hunt clubs since this creates a permanent structure.  
[[File:Wooden shooting butt overlooking a tarn - geograph.org.uk - 583457.jpg|thumb|left|A wooden blind in [[North Yorkshire]]]]

Pit blind amenities can vary greatly from a basic blind with sticks or other temporary camouflage to elaborate multi-level blinds with small quarters for sleeping or cooking.  Most pit blinds will have some form of movable door or slide that can be opened quickly when waterfowl are approaching while still allowing the hunters a good view while closed.  Camouflage netting or screens are common materials for the movable top.  One common drawback to pit blinds is their propensity to accumulate water.  Especially in marsh or wetland areas, the soil can hold a large amount of moisture.  Pit blinds are sometimes fitted with sump pumps or even hand operated pumps to assist the hunters in draining any water that has invaded the blind.

Layout blinds allow a hunter to have a low profile in a field without digging a hole. They are made of an aluminum metal frame and a canvas cover. Most modern commercial layout blinds are fitted with spring-loaded flaps on top that retract when the hunter is ready to fire.  The layout blind allows the hunter to lie prone in the blind with only the head or face exposed to allow good visibility. Newer blinds also have a screen that provides a one-way view outside the blind to conceal the hunter, but allow him/her to observe the waterfowl.  When birds are in range the hunter can open the flaps and quickly sit up to a shooting position.  Layout blinds come in many different colors and patterns from plain brown to new camouflage patterns that simulate forage found in typical hunting locations.  A favorite trick of savvy hunters is to use loose forage found in the specific field being hunted to camouflage the layout blind. Most blinds are fitted with canvas loops designed to hold stalks, grass or other material.

Blinds are known by different names in different countries. In New Zealand, for instance, the term ''maimai'' (possibly from the Australian term "mia-mia" for a temporary shelter) is used for a permanent or semi-permanent hide or blind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nicaraguabirdhunting.com/guidelines-for-maimai-construction-on-public-waters/]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decoys ===
[[File:Feathered game of the Northeast (1907) (14755150402).jpg|thumb|An illustration entitled "Sea Duck Shooting Over Decoys" from ''Feathered game of the Northeast'' (1907).]] 
Decoys are replica waterfowl that are used to attract birds to a location near the hunters; an important piece of equipment for the waterfowler.  Using a good spread of decoys and calling, an experienced waterfowl hunter can successfully [[bag (fishing &amp; hunting)|bag]] ducks or geese if waterfowl are flying that day. The first waterfowl decoys were made from vegetation such as cattails by Native Americans.  In the 18th century, duck decoys were carved from soft wood such as pine. Many decoys were not painted. Live birds were also used as decoys.  They were placed in the water and had a rope and a weight at the end of the rope so the duck could not swim or fly away.  This method of hunting became illegal in the 1930s.  By end of the 20th century, collectors started to search for high quality wooden duck decoys that were used by market hunters in the late 19th century or early 20th century. Decoys used in Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay, Barnegat Bay, and North Carolina's Core Sound, and the famous Outerbanks (OBX) are highly sought after.  Most decoys were carved from various types of wood that would withstand the rigors of many seasons of hunting.  Highly detailed paint and decoy carvings that even included the outlines of tail or wing feathers turned the duck decoy into a work of art.  Today, many collectors search estate sales, auctions, trade shows, or other venues for vintage duck decoys. In the historic Atlantic Flyway, North Carolina's "Core Sound Decoy Festival" draws in excess of 40,000 visitors to the little community of Harker's Island, NC the first weekend in December each year, and Easton, MD with their Wildfowl Festival in the month of November draws a great many people to that old goose hunting community on the Eastern Shore.

Modern decoys are typically made from molded plastic; that began in the 1960s. Making decoys of plastic, decoys can be made many times faster than carving from wood. The plastic allows a high level of detail, a resilient product and reasonable cost.  Most are still hand painted. Most modern decoys are fitted with a "water keel" which fills with water once the decoy is immersed in water or a "weighted keel" filled with lead.  Both types of keel help the decoy stay upright in wind or high waves.  Weighted keel decoys look more realistic by sitting lower in the water.
This also allows for decoys to be thrown into the water and the decoy to float upright.  The obvious drawback to weighted keels are the added weight when carrying decoys for long distances.  Decoys are held in place by some type of sinker or weight and attached via line to the decoy.  Various weight designs allow the line to be wrapped around the decoy when not in use and secured by folding or attaching the lead weight to the decoy.

Decoys are placed in the water about 30 to 35 yards from the hunters.  Usually a gap is in the decoy spread to entice live ducks to land in the gap.

Recently, decoys have been introduced that provide lifelike movement that adds to the attraction for waterfowl.  Shakers are decoys with a small electric motor and an offset weighted wheel.  As the wheel turns it causes the decoy to "shake" in the water and create realistic wave rings throughout the decoy spread.  Spinning wing decoys are also fitted with an electric motor and have wings made of various materials.  As the wings spin an optical illusion is created simulating the wing beats for landing birds.  These decoys can be quite effective when hunting waterfowl and have been banned in some states.  Other types of movement decoys include swimming decoys and even kites formed like geese or ducks.  The use of UV paint has also been suggested for decoys.  Unlike humans, it is possible for wildlife to see UV colors and decoys so patterned may appear more authentic.

===Boats===
[[File:Sydney Harold Smith boarding gun punt YORYM-S234.jpg|thumb|A photograph of a waterfowl hunter launching his boat, circa 1900–1912]]
Boats are used to set up decoys, pick up birds, and travel sometimes long distances to hunting areas.  They can also be covered and used as a blind.  Some hunters use grass and others use burlap or other material to camouflage their boats. Often painted brown, tan, green, and black, some boats are motor powered while others have oars.  Most popular are flat bottomed to increase stability with keels made of wood or aluminum between {{Convert|10|and|16|ft|m}} long. Painted kayaks or canoes made of aluminum or fiberglass reinforced with Kevlar are also used; these can navigate shallow streams or small narrow rivers in search of waterfowl. Care must be taken when shooting from boats, canoes or kayaks as hunters have in the past fallen out of such craft due to loss of balance when shooting at waterfowl. Pursuing diving ducks in lakes, bays or sounds in the United States requires larger boats with higher sides and larger engines, and small boats have been known to capsize, tipping all hunters into the water who can drown by hypothermia.  Sink boxes, boats that conceal the hunter under the water surface, are now illegal to use.

=== Clothing ===
Duck season takes place in the fall and winter where the weather can be harsh. Waterproof clothing is critical to duck hunting. Most duck hunters hunt over water, and they stand in water or in a boat. In order to stand in the water and stay dry the hunter must wear [[Waders (footwear)|waders]]. [[Waders (footwear)|Waders]] are waterproof pants (usually made of a neoprene-like material) that have attached boots and are completely waterproof. Typical waders are chest-high, but waist-high and knee-high waders are sometimes used in shallow water. Duck hunting is a cold sport and the hunter must be well insulated from the cold. Ducks also have superior vision and can see color, which is why hunters must wear clothing that is well camouflaged. Camouflage clothing is various shades of brown or green or brown and green combined. Therefore, hunters wear camouflage similar to the area they are hunting so the ducks do not see the hunters. Face masks are often worn so the ducks do not see the hunters' faces, and camouflage gloves are also worn.

===Dogs===
[[Image:Waterfowl hunting.jpg|thumb|A duck hunter with two [[mallard]]s and one [[redhead (bird)|redhead]]. A [[Labrador Retriever]] and duck decoys are visible in the background.]]
Duck hunters quite often employ a [[dog]] to retrieve downed birds.  Most often hunters use a [[Labrador Retriever]], [[Golden Retriever]] or [[Chesapeake Bay Retriever]] to retrieve waterfowl.  The use of a dog provides a number of advantages.  As duck hunting often takes place in cold wet locations, the use of a dog frees the hunter from potentially dangerous forays into cold water to retrieve the bird.  Such efforts can be dangerous for the hunter, but are managed by a dog quite easily.  It also allows for the recovery of wounded birds that might otherwise escape. A dog's acute sense of smell allows them to find the wounded birds in swamps or marshes where weeds can allow a duck to hide. The use of a dog ensures that a higher percentage of the birds shot end up on the table.
A disadvantage of having dogs in the duck blind, is that some dogs are not well-trained to sit still and can potentially ruin a good hunt. Dogs that run into the water looking for birds when guns are fired, rather than waiting until sent or released create a hazard to the dog and hunters.  Nevertheless, dogs are considered the greatest conservation tool known to waterfowlers.

===Hunting guides===
In the United States, professional hunting guides are used by water fowlers who do not know a local area. They are paid to take clients to hunt on leased, or private property, or hunting in local areas in which these professional guides know where to hunt in  large public waterfowl hunting areas. If they use an outboard engine  on their boat, they must be registered by the USCG as an OUPV operator in all fifty states, and have that license in their boat during the time of operation, and many states require all waterfowl guides to be registered via the state DNR hunting license. Waterfowlers normally employ a guide for a half day or a whole day of hunting. The cost of hiring a guide varies from one hundred fifty dollars for a half day to four hundred dollars for a day.  Guides have boats, blinds, decoys, and dogs for retrieving ducks or geese.  They know flight patterns of game and know how to call ducks or geese in.  They know how to set up decoys.  Some guides specialize in certain types of waterfowl while others will be more generalists.  Some guides specialize in sea hunting while others will specialize in bay hunting, river hunting, lake hunting or swamp hunting.  Guides may have houses for hunters to sleep for the night.  They may provide the service of cleaning the game and keeping it on ice in coolers or refrigerators.   Guides may have coffin blinds or more fancy house blinds, that provide seats and heating.  Guides are usually registered with the state that they guide in.

==Wildfowling in the UK==
In England, the term "hunting" is generally reserved for the pursuit of game on land with hounds, so the sport is generally known as "wildfowl shooting" or "wildfowling" rather than "hunting."

Wild ducks and geese are shot over foreshores and inland and coastal marshes in Europe. Birds are shot with a [[shotgun]], and less commonly, a large single barreled gun mounted on a small boat, known as a ''punt''. Due the ban of use of lead shot for hunting wildfowl or over wetlands, many wildfowlers are switching to modern guns with stronger engineering to allow the use of non-toxic ammunition such as steel or tungsten based cartridges. The most popular bore is the 12-gauge.
[[File:Snowden Slights, front view YORYM-S13.jpg|thumb|left|Snowden Slights 'the last of Yorkshire's Wildfowlers'&lt;ref name=Blast&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ratcliffe|first1=Roger|title=Blast from the past|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/main-topics/local-stories/blast-from-the-past-1-2393138|accessdate=17 March 2015|work=The Yorkshire Post|publisher=Johnston Publishing Ltd.|date=6 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Only certain 'quarry' species of wildfowl may legally be shot in the UK, and are protected under the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981]]. These are [[mallard]], [[wigeon]], [[Common teal|teal]], [[Common pochard|pochard]], [[Northern shoveller|shoveller]], [[Northern pintail|pintail]], [[gadwall]], [[Common goldeneye|goldeneye]], [[tufted duck]], [[Canada goose]], [[white-fronted goose]] (England and Wales only), [[greylag goose]] and [[pink-footed goose]]. Other common quarry targets for the wildfowler include the [[common snipe]].

An intimate knowledge of the quarry and its habitat is required by the successful wildfowler. Shooting will normally occur during the early morning and late afternoon 'flights', when the birds move to and from feeding and roosting sites. The wildfowler is not looking for a large bag of quarry, and his many hours of effort are rewarded by even a single bird. It is recommended that wildfowlers always shoot with a dog, or someone with a dog, to retrieve shot birds on difficult estuarine terrain. When a bird is in hand, wild ducks and geese make fabulous eating, but not all are available to buy. You cannot sell wild geese, for example, and ducks other than mallard are difficult to find; but try farmers' markets. The favourites on the table are mallard, wigeon and teal.

Wildfowling has come under threat in recent years through legislation. Destruction of habitat also has played a large part in the decline of shooting areas, and recently in the UK "[[Freedom to roam|right to roam]]" policies mean that wildfowlers' conservation areas are at risk. However, in most regions, good relationships exist between wildfowlers, conservationists, ramblers and other coastal area users.

In the UK wildfowling is largely self-regulated. Their representative body, WAGBI ([[Wildfowlers Association of Great Britain and Ireland]]), was founded in 1908 by Stanley Duncan in Hull. This Association changed its name in 1981 to become the [[British Association for Shooting and Conservation]] (BASC) and now represents all forms of live quarry shooting at European, national and local levels. There are also many wildfowling clubs around the coast of [[Great Britain]], often covering certain estuary areas where wildfowl are found in large numbers.

Anyone wishing to try wildfowling is recommended to contact a local club or try the wildfowling permit scheme run by the [[British Association for Shooting and Conservation]] (BASC).

==Regulations, sportsmanship, and safety==
Waterfowl hunting is highly regulated in most western countries. Hunters are required to obtain a hunting license and face strict limits on the number of birds that can be taken in a day ([[bag limits]]), and the total number of birds a hunter can possess (possession limits). 

There were no regulations on waterfowl hunting from when the Paleo Indians arrived in North America to the early 20th century. In the early 20th century large bore shotguns and rifles were used. Traps were used.  Live decoys were used in front of blinds, as well as shotguns holding many shells.  Hunting was done throughout the year.  In 1913 the United States Congress passed the [[Weeks–McLean Act]] regulating waterfowl hunting, however the states were successful in arguing that the constitution gave no such regulatory power to the federal government, and the statute was struck down.  In response, the United States negotiated the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]] with the United Kingdom (which at the time was largely responsible for Canada's foreign affairs) covering the same substance, but would be constitutional because of the [[Supremacy Clause]].  The treaty was upheld by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Missouri v. Holland]]''.
[[File:FMIB 34651 Ducks Illegally Netted in Lake Ontario.jpeg|thumb|300px|Ducks are illegally netted in this photograph taken in 1916 which was presented to the [[Canada|Canadian]] Conservation of Fish, Birds and Game Committee.]]

In the United States, hunters must also purchase a federal duck stamp and often a state stamp. It is illegal to shoot ducks from a motor vehicle or a moving boat. Shooting sitting or swimming ducks is considered unsportsmanlike by some and possibly unsafe. Many practices that were once common in commercial duck hunting before the start of the 20th century, including laying [[bait (luring substance)|bait]]s such as corn, use of live ducks as "decoys," and use of guns larger than a 10-gauge, are now prohibited.&lt;ref name="fgc.ca.gov"&gt;[http://www.fgc.ca.gov/2006/waterfowlregs06.html#507 State of California. "Selected 2006 Waterfowl Hunting Regulations."]&lt;/ref&gt; In most areas, shotguns that can hold more than three shells must be modified to reduce their magazine size.  A wooden plug is installed in the hollow magazine of the shotgun.  Legal hunting is limited to a set time period (or "season"), which generally extends from fall to early winter, while birds are migrating south.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/huntwild/hunt/season/animal_listing/ TPWD:2006 2006-2007 Texas Hunting Season Dates, Grouped by Animal]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservation Order established by the USF&amp;WS allows for hunting snow geese in March and April. The reason for this is that snow geese populations have become so large that more hunting is needed to control their populations, as they are destroying their habitat. Shotguns can be loaded to full capacity for hunting these geese.

It is also considered good sportsmanship to make every possible attempt to retrieve dead or injured waterfowl the hunter has shot(In the Australian state of Victoria it is required by law). Birds are shot within range to prevent cripples. Shooting before birds are within range is also considered poor sportsmanship, as this often merely injures the birds and may drive them away before other hunters can fire.

Many provinces in Canada and all states require hunters, including waterfowl hunters, to complete hunter safety courses before they can obtain a license.[http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/learning/hunter_education/ostates.phtml#canada]
Waterfowl hunters fire short-range shotgun rounds into the air over often deserted bodies of water, so accidental injuries are rarer than in other hunting activities such as [[Big game hunting|big game]] or [[deer hunting]].

==Hunting areas==
All states except Hawaii have public land for waterfowl hunting.  Some states might refer to them as fish and game lands or Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs). Every state's DNR has a website, and each has a link to their licenses and regulations and WMAs, as well as information on various draw and public hunts. Some states call them fish and wildlife management areas.  These are lands purchased from hunting license revenue.  Water in bays or ocean are open area to hunting, as no one can own these areas, although some counties in North Carolina and Virginia still allow a limited number of Registered Blinds in public waters of certain coastal counties. The Mississippi Flyway is a very famous waterfowling community, although Arkansas is not getting the amount of mallards due to short stopping by more and more private impoundments and warmer weather. The Central Flyway has the highest numbers of waterfowl migrating south from Canada in the Great Southern Migration. The Pacific Flyway is an exceptional hunting area for migratory waterfowl today, although their WMAs can be quite crowded from Washington State all the way south to California rice fields which used to see Hollywood's great hunters flock to Tulle Lake, and Sacramento private duck hunting clubs.

The problem for the average waterfowler is getting access to the ocean, bay, marsh, or lake to hunt public access waters.  Hunters usually need large boats, and motors to travel safely to and in these areas. Many people will set up hunting blinds on the shoreline of water unless it is private property. Many states across the United States are not allowing the building of hunting blinds on any public waters. Such action therefore allows more use of boat blinds, and therefore no permanent water hazards of blinds in public waters such as lakes, bays or sounds allows all waterfowl hunters to hunt all public waters.  This can be very successful if they know how to use a duck call, and proper use of decoy placement and wind direction, and can call ducks in towards their decoys. Most sportsmen know to stay at least 500 yards from anyone else that may be hunting nearby them in public waters. More waterfowlers today should learn from their elders the importance of "ethical sportsmanship", whenever gunning on public waters hunting ducks and geese today and in the future.

==Flyways==
[[Image:Waterfowlflywaysmap.png|thumb|400px|Waterfowl flyways of North America]]
In North America, the routes used by migratory waterfowl are generally divided into four broad geographical paths known as flyways. Each flyway is characterized by a different composition of species and habitat.

===Mississippi flyway===
{{main article|Mississippi Flyway}}
The Mississippi flyway is a migration route used by waterfowl to travel from central Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, flying along the route of the Mississippi River and its tributaries.
In the [[Midwest]] and central [[United States]], wildfowl hunting generally occurs on lakes, marshes, swamps, or rivers where ducks and geese land during their migration. [[Maize|Cornfields]] and [[rice paddy|rice paddies]] are also common hunting grounds, since geese and ducks often feed on the grain that remains in the field after harvest. In some areas, farmers rent or lease hunting rights. Some farmers or hunters form [[hunting|hunt]] [[club (organization)|club]]s, which can cover thousands of acres and have [[resort]]-like amenities, or be as simple as a shallow pit blind dug into a field. On the East and West Coast of America and many parts of Europe, waterfowl hunters often focus on the seashore.

The United States [[Fish and Wildlife Service]] maintains millions of acres as [[National Wildlife Refuge]]s open to public hunting.  All states have public hunting and fishing areas.  States publish maps of these areas.

===Atlantic flyway===
{{originalresearch|section|date=January 2018}}
{{main article|Atlantic Flyway}}
The Atlantic Flyway is a migration route used by waterfowl flying from northern [[Quebec]] to [[Florida]] in the autumn and back in the springtime. This is where duck hunting first started some of the largest and grandest waterfowl hunting clubs and clubhouses in North America. Look at photos of the "Whalehead Club in the Outer Banks of North Carolina" which is no longer a hunting club, but is a historical building today, built in the grand style of the gilded age of waterfowling. North Carolina waterfowl guide and writer Joe Guide states, "some of the greatest and grandest of Waterfowl Clubs along the famous Atlantic flyway developed following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] era, and the largest ones were financed by Northerners loaded with money due to the great industrial revolution period beginning around the mid 1870s—and most of the grand waterfowl clubs ended due to the great depression years due to economic conditions. It might surprise you that a majority of the grand Atlantic Seaboard Waterfowl Hunt Clubs did not have southerners as "members" until well into the 1950s, however, they all used locals as caretakers, guides, paddlers, and cooks". Diver hunting is the major waterfowl activity along the coastal regions of the Atlantic, however, local populations of greater snow geese seem to be increasing in number, as they have started breeding with lesser snow geese and their migration range is ever increasing.

Ducks and geese are born in the tundra of Quebec, and fly south in autumn to [[Chesapeake Bay]] and [[Virginia]]'s famous [[Back Bay]], and the [[James River]], and then move southward through [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and Florida for the winter. Northeast and northwest Florida get a great number of teal and divers as the winter progresses. In the northeastern states the [[Saint Lawrence River]], the coast of [[Maine]], Long island harbors, [[Barnegat Bay]], [[Great Egg Harbor]], [[Little Egg Harbor]], [[Absecon Bay]], [[Delaware Bay]], Chesapeake Bay, [[Virginia's Eastern Shore]] and Back Bays saw presidents and captains of great industry spend part of their winters at their wildfowling clubs. North Carolina's Outer Banks, and the Core and Pamlico Sounds have been known for centuries for great waterfowl hunting drawing people from throughout the big cities of the northeastern states. In South Carolina there was [[Georgetown, South Carolina|Georgetown's]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston's]] old [[rice field]]s, and backcountry marshes and freshwater rivers and lakes that continued to draw ducks in great numbers until the [[Santee National Wildlife Refuge]] stopped feeding the ducks in the winter months of the 1980s due to the economy and changes in National Wildlife Refuge policy across the nation. In the 1960s to the mid 1980s the upper Santee swamp's upper [[Lake Marion (South Carolina)|Lake Marion]] region used to winter over 150,000 mallards each and every winter's duck count.

In the Chesapeake Bay area well into the 1930s one of the biggest threats to waterfowl was "local [[poacher]]s" using flat boat boats, mounting huge 12 foot black powder swivel guns. Most of these ancient weapons have been confiscated and are in museums, although a few families have hidden theirs as family keepsakes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6CcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=motor+gun+boat&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6AXqTIOfAsienAf959ngDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=motor%20gun%20boat&amp;f=true "Poaching Made Big Business", October 1933, ''Popular Science''] middle of page&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mountain(Central) Flyway===
{{main article|Central Flyway}}
The Rocky Mountain Flyway is used by waterfowl of that region to fly from Alberta and Saskatchewan Canada to Texas, the Gulf Coast, and western Mexico.

===Pacific flyway===
{{main article|Pacific Flyway}}
The Pacific flyway is a migration route from central Alaska to southern Mexico.  It is used by nearly all waterfowl species in that region.

==Waterfowl conservation==

Due to extensive market hunting from the 18th century to the early 20th century, waterfowl populations dropped drastically.  In the 1930s there was a severe drought,{{where|date=February 2016}} in which waterfowl populations declined severely.

Waterfowl are indigenous to marsh and wetland areas, which are shrinking at alarming rates due to the drought and farmers draining wetland areas to plant crops.  Wetland conservation and restoration is critical for the continuance of waterfowl hunting.  Organizations such as [[Ducks Unlimited]] are making a concerted effort to maintain and expand waterfowl and marshland [[Habitat conservation|conservation]] to ensure safety and expansion of the sport. Ducks Unlimited buys land or converts land into waterfowl habitat. Ducks Unlimited started in 1937 in Sullivan County, New York when a hunter went hunting along a river and could not find any wood ducks. This hunter and others formed Ducks Unlimited. Now Ducks Unlimited has thousands of members that donate millions of dollars for buying waterfowl habitat in the United States, Canada and Mexico.  Ducks Unlimited has many dinners and other fund raisers throughout the year in each state.

'''''Wild New World''''' (also known as '''''Prehistoric America''''') is a six-part BBC documentary series about Ice Age America that describes the prehistory, landscape and wildlife of the continent from the arrival of humans to the end of the Ice Age. It was first transmitted in the UK on BBC Two from 3 October to 7 November 2002. Like several other BBC programmes, it contains both computer graphics and real-life animals. Occasionally, footage of non-American counterparts of the extinct North American beasts (like the American lion and the American cheetah) are used in juxtaposition with footage of native American animals, like the [[pronghorn]].

Wild New World was co-produced by the [[BBC Natural History Unit]] and [[Discovery Channel]]. The music was composed by Barnaby Taylor and performed by the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]]. The series was narrated by Jack Fortune and produced by Miles Barton.

The series forms part of the Natural History Unit's ''Continents'' strand. It was preceded by ''[[Wild Africa]]'' in 2001 and followed  by ''[[Wild Down Under]]'' in 2003.

==Production==
The series was announced by the BBC with the working title ''All American Animals'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.c21media.net/three-new-shows-from-bbc-discovery-renewal/ | title=Three new shows from BBC-Discovery renewal |publisher=C21 Media |accessdate=13 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.c21media.net/bbc-and-discovery-explore-wild-new-world/ | title=BBC and Discovery explore Wild New World |publisher=C21 Media |accessdate=16 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was later changed to ''Wild New World''.

==Episodes==
''All episode names were given from BBC website. All broadcast dates refer to the original UK transmission.''

Each of the episode consists with the prehistory and wildlife of a particular region in the United States, except for final episode which is about various modern American animals.

:Filming location: [[Alaska]], [[Yukon]] (Canada)

Preserved in the frozen soil of Alaska are clues to an unknown land, where muskoxen and wild horses roarmed alongside woolly mammoths. Enormous [[American lion]]s harried the families of mammoths, formidable in the defence of their young. The lion were more successful at hunting at bison in the snow but they were no match for the giant short-faced bear.

:Filming location: [[Nevada]] , [[Grand Canyon]] (Southwest USA)

The first people to experience the splendours of the Grand Canyon would have seen a much greener, richer land. Today it is cougar country but then bizarre [[ground sloth]]s sheltered in the caves and browsed in the canyons alongside [[Columbian mammoth]]s. Camels were on the menu for both the first people and the impressive sabre-tooth cat (''[[Smilodon]]'').

 |ShortSummary    = :13,000 years ago
:Filming location: [[Florida]] (Southeast USA)

America's Deep South is today a haven for the manatees, alligators and waterbirds which abound in its clear, turquoise springs. But when the Ice Age gripped much of the continent, the south was a warm paradise for the earliest human hunters as well as warmth loving wildlife. Tapirs and capybaras grazed in the swamps, dwarfed by the giant ground sloths which towered above them. Sabre-tooth cats came to face to face with skunks and jaguars stalked armoured glyptodons (''[[Glyptotherium]]'').

:Filming location: [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]] (Northwest USA)

The towering rainforests of the Northwest have a timeless quality, yet when the first humans reached this coast, they witnessed a very different landscape. Open woodlands and Arctic [[tundra]] were home to caribou and strange elephant-like mastodons - all potential prey for the scimitar-toothed cat (''[[Homotherium]]'').

:Filming location: [[Colorado]] (Midlands)

The vast seas of grass on the Great Plains are home to bison, coyotes and prairie dogs today. But previously the area was an American [[Serengeti]], populated by Columbian mammoths (the largest of all mammoths). Here cheetah hunted pronghorn antelope and lions stalked horses and bison. But the most impressive of all the carnivores was the giant short-faced bear.

:Filming location: [[Manhattan]]

The final episode shows how the megafauna become extinct, and about how modern animals living on the continent have adapted to the increasing human population and development in North America.

The meeting between human and megafauna in North America was a deadly one - most of the large land animals, including all the mammoths and mastodons, horses, camels, giant ground sloths, short-faced bear, and all the big cats (except the cougar) disappeared and the landscape changed dramatically. But some animals learned to flourish in human's environment. Today chimney swifts roost in the towering smokestacks of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], kit foxes den in [[Los Angeles]] suburbs, moose trample the gardens of [[Anchorage]] and red tailed hawks nest in Manhattan.

==Themes==
The show's episodes offer several common themes, the main one being the coming of humans to America via the Ice Age's [[land bridge]] and causing the extinction of the North American megafauna featured in the episodes. Another BBC programme, ''[[Monsters We Met]]'' picks up and elaborates on this topic in greater detail. A more recent [[Discovery channel|Discovery]] show, ''[[Prehistoric (2009/10 show)]]'', also features scenic elements of ''Prehistoric America'', such as the present melting away to reveal the past, as well as creatures already shown by the show, like the American mastodon, ''[[Arctodus]]'' and Columbian mammoth.
