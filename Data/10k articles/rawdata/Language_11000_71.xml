[[File:SeacroftBoarded.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Abandoned houses in [[Seacroft]], [[Leeds]], England, UK.]]
In law, '''abandonment'''  is the relinquishment, giving up or renunciation of an [[Interest (finance)|interest]], [[Cause of action|claim]], [[civil proceedings]], [[Appeal (law)|appeal]], [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]], [[Possession (law)|possession]], or [[right (legal)|right]], especially with the intent of never again resuming or reasserting it. Such intentional action may take the form of a discontinuance or a [[waiver]]. This broad meaning has a number of applications in different branches of law. In [[common law]] jurisdictions, both ''common law abandonment'' and ''statutory abandonment'' of [[Property (ownership right)|property]] may be recognized.

Common law abandonment is "the relinquishment of a right [in property] by the owner thereof without any regard to future possession by himself or any other person, and with the intention to {{sic|foresake}} or desert the right...."&lt;ref name=cjs&gt;{{harvnb|Ginnow|Nikolic|1985|loc = § 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the voluntary relinquishment of a thing by its owner with the intention of terminating his ownership, and without [the intention of] vesting ownership in any other person; the giving up of a thing absolutely, without reference to any particular person or purpose...."&lt;ref name=cjs/&gt; By contrast, an example of statutory abandonment (albeit in a common law jurisdiction) is the abandonment by a [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy trustee]] under {{usc|11|554}}.

In [[Scots law]], failure to assert a legal right in a way that implies abandonment of that property is called "taciturnity", while the term "abandonment" in Scots law refers specifically to a procedure by which a party gives up [[Scottish civil proceedings|civil proceedings]] or an appeal.

==Giving up an interest==

===Abandonment of property===
[[File:Abandoned house in White Marsh, Virginia.jpg|thumb|An abandoned house in White Marsh, Virginia]]
[[File:Ljungdalen October 2015 05.jpg|thumb|Abandoned farmhouses in Sweden circa 2015]]
Intentional abandonment is also referred to as ''dereliction'', and something voluntarily abandoned by its owner with the intention of not retaking it is a ''derelict''. Someone that holds the property or to whom property rights have been relinquished is an abandonee.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garner|1999|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An item that has been abandoned is termed an abandum.&lt;ref name=gar2&gt;{{harvnb|Garner|1999|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[res nullius]] abandoned by its owner, leaving it [[occupancy|vacant]], belongs to no one.

===Abandonment of easement===
The relinquishment by a nonuser, for a specified period, of some accommodation or right in another's land, such as [[right of way (public throughway)|right-of-way]] or free access of light and air.

===Abandonment of domicile===
Occurs when one ceases to reside permanently in a former [[Domicile (law)|domicile]], coupled with the intention of choosing a new domicile. The presumptions which will guide the court in deciding whether a former domicile has been abandoned or not must be inferred from the facts of each case. In the United States, a tenant is generally understood to have abandoned a property if he or she has fallen behind in [[renting|rent]] and shown a lack of interest in continuing to live there. The landlord must then send notice of the intent to seize the property and wait a certain number of days to take action on it. How long the landlord has to wait depends on the value of the property. The landlord can keep the money up to the costs incurred as a result of the abandonment; the rest must be set aside for the former tenant, should she or he eventually return.

===Abandonment of insurance===
Abandonment occurs when the [[insurance|insured]] surrenders to the insurer all rights to damaged or lost property and claims payment for a total loss. Sometimes, this is permitted only when damage constitutes [[Marine insurance#Actual total loss and constructive total loss|constructive total loss]].&lt;ref name=gar2/&gt; In [[marine insurance]] parlance, abandonment involves the surrender of a ship or goods to the insurer, who becomes the abandonee. Abandonment can also mean refusal to accept from a delivering carrier a shipment so damaged in transit as to be worthless.

===Abandonment of copyright===
Abandonment is recognized as the explicit release of material by a [[copyright]] holder into the [[public domain]]. However, statutory abandonment is legally a tricky issue which has little relevant case precedent to establish how an artist can abandon their copyright during their lifetime. The more common approach is to license work under a scheme that provides for public use rather than strictly abandoning copyright.

[[Copyright]] protection attaches to a work as soon as it is fixed in a tangible medium, whether the copyright holder desires this protection or not. Before the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] an artist could abandon or forfeit their copyright by neglecting to comply with the relevant  [[copyright formalities|formalities]]. Difficulty arises when one tries to apply the doctrine of abandonment to present-day concerns regarding the abandonment or gifting of a digitized work to the public domain. The abandonment of a work is difficult to prove in court, though Learned Hand proposed a test which parallels other forms of abandonment law wherein an author or copyright holder could abandon their work if they intend to abandon it and commit an overt act to make public that intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013|loc=¶ 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{see also|Abandonware}}

===Abandonment of trademark===
Abandonment of [[trademark]] is understood to happen when a trademark is not used for three or more years,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elias|Stim|2010|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; or when it is deliberately discontinued;&lt;ref name=gar2/&gt; trademark law protects only trademarks being actively used and defended.

===Abandonment of patent===
Abandonment is relinquishment by an inventor of the right to secure a [[patent]], in such a way as to constitute a dedication of the invention to public use. Under [[United States patent law]], abandonment of a [[patent application]] occurs when either the required reply is not filed within the required time period or an express abandonment is filed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s711.html MPEP § 711 Abandonment of Patent Application]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abandonment of public transportation systems===
Abandonment is permission sought by or granted to a carrier by a state or federal agency to cease operation of all or part of a [[public transportation system|route or service]].  This has a legal signification in England recognized by statute, by authority of which the [[Board of Trade]] may, under certain circumstances, grant a warrant to a [[railway]] authorizing the abandonment of its line or part of it.  Likewise, in the United States, the [[Surface Transportation Board]] grants permission to abandon railway lines.

==Failure to fulfill a responsibility==

===Abandonment rules in the military===
The abandonment of a [[military unit]] by a soldier, a Marine, or an airman; or of a ship or a naval base by a sailor; can be called [[desertion]]; and being away from one's assigned location for a significant length of time can be called ''"[[Desertion#AWOL: Away WithOut Leave|Away Without Leave]]"'', ''"[[Desertion#AWOL: Away WithOut Leave|Absent Without Leave]]"'', or ''"[[Dereliction of duty]]"''. However, the term "Dereliction of Duty" also includes the offenses of being present but not carrying out one's assigned duties and responsibilities with the expected amount of effort, alertness, carefulness, ingenuity, and sense of duty.

===Abandonment of contract===
Abandonment of contract means failure to fulfil a contractual obligation, which will affect the abandoner's entitlement to the contractually agreed [[Consideration (law)|consideration]], for example in the case of [[Sumpter v Hedges|''Sumpter v Hedges'' (1898)]].

===Abandonment of family===
Desertion refers to intentional and substantial abandonment, permanently or for a period of time stated by law, without legal excuse and without consent, of one's duties arising out of a status such as that of husband and wife or parent and child. It can involve desertion of a spouse with the intention of creating a permanent separation. Desertion of one spouse by the other without just cause is called malicious abandonment.&lt;ref name=gar2/&gt; [[Child abandonment]] is often recognized as a crime, in which case the child is usually not physically harmed directly as part of the abandonment. Child abandonment is also called ''exposure'' or ''exposition'', especially when an infant is left in the open.
&lt;!--Abandonment of wife and children is sometimes called ''[[desertion]],'' and is somewhat difficult to prove in court. The plaintiff must generally show his or spouse to have left for over a year and failed to pay support, as well as proving that the departure was not agreed upon and also not caused by the plaintiff. Because abandonment by a husband often left his wife and children destitute (and hence a burden upon the public purse), it used to be a [[felony]] in most [[U.S. state|American states]].  At present, nearly all states have abolished the felony of abandonment, but it remains in place in a few states like [[Massachusetts]]. The abandonment or exposure of a young child under the age of two, which is an indictable [[misdemeanor]], is commonly called ''cruelty to children.''--&gt;

===Abandonment of a patient===
In [[medicine]], abandonment occurs when a [[health care professional]] (usually a physician, nurse, dentist, or paramedic) has already begun emergency treatment of a [[patient]], and then suddenly walks away while the patient is still in need, without securing the services of an adequate substitute or giving the patient adequate opportunity to find one. It is a [[crime]] in many countries and can result in the loss of one's license to practice. Also, because of the [[public policy (law)|public policy]] in favor of keeping people alive, the professional cannot defend himself or herself by pointing to the patient's inability to pay for services; this opens the medical professional to the possibility of exposure to [[malpractice]] liability beyond one's insurance coverage.

In [[linguistics]], an '''alternation''' is the phenomenon of a [[morpheme]] exhibiting variation in its [[phonology|phonological]] realization. Each of the various realizations is called an '''alternant'''. The variation may be conditioned by the phonological, [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], and/or [[syntax|syntactic]] environment in which the morpheme finds itself.

Alternations provide linguists with data that allow them to determine the [[allophone]]s and [[allomorph]]s of a language's phonemes and morphemes and to develop analyses determining the distribution of those allophones and allomorphs.

==Phonologically conditioned alternation==
{{Seealso|Allomorph}}

An example of a phonologically conditioned alternation is the [[English language|English]] [[plural]] marker commonly spelled ''s'' or ''es''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohn |first=Abigail |chapter=Phonology |pages=202–203 |title=The Handbook of Linguistics |editor1=Mark Aronoff|editor2=Janie Rees-Miller |year=2001 |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |location=Oxford |isbn=0-631-20497-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This morpheme is pronounced {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/z/}}, or {{IPA|/ᵻz/}},&lt;ref group=note&gt;The vowel of the inflectional suffix -{{angbr|es}} may belong to the phoneme of either {{IPA|/ɪ/}} or {{IPA|/ə/}} depending on dialect, and {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ᵻ}}}} is a shorthand for "either {{IPA|/ɪ/}} or {{IPA|/ə/}}". This usage of the symbol is borrowed from the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the nature of the preceding sound.

# If the preceding sound is a [[sibilant consonant]] (one of {{IPA|/s/, /z/, /ʃ/, /ʒ/, /tʃ/}}, or {{IPA|/dʒ/}}), the plural marker takes the form {{IPA|/ᵻz/}}. Examples:
#*''mass'' {{IPA|/ˈmæs/}}, plural ''masses'' {{IPA|/ˈmæs'''ᵻz'''/}}
#*''fez'' {{IPA|/ˈfɛz/}}, plural ''fezzes'' {{IPA|/ˈfɛz'''ᵻz'''/}}
#*''mesh'' {{IPA|/ˈmɛʃ/}}, plural ''meshes'' {{IPA|/ˈmɛʃ'''ᵻz'''/}}
#*''mirage'' {{IPA|/mɪˈrɑːʒ/}}, plural ''mirages'' {{IPA|/mɪˈrɑːʒ'''ᵻz'''/}}
#*''church'' {{IPA|/ˈtʃɜːrtʃ/}}, plural ''churches'' {{IPA|/ˈtʃɜːrtʃ'''ᵻz'''/}}
#*''bridge'' {{IPA|/ˈbrɪdʒ/}}, plural ''bridges'' {{IPA|/ˈbrɪdʒ'''ᵻz'''/}}
# Otherwise, if the preceding sound is [[voice (phonetics)|voiceless]], the plural marker takes the likewise voiceless form {{IPA|/s/}}. Examples:
#*''mop'' {{IPA|/ˈmɒp/}}, plural ''mops'' {{IPA|/ˈmɒp'''s'''/}}
#*''mat'' {{IPA|/ˈmæt/}}, plural ''mats'' {{IPA|/ˈmæt'''s'''/}}
#*''pack'' {{IPA|/ˈpæk/}}, plural ''packs'' {{IPA|/ˈpæk'''s'''/}}
#*''cough'' {{IPA|/ˈkɒf/}}, plural ''coughs'' {{IPA|/ˈkɒf'''s'''/}}
#*''myth'' {{IPA|/ˈmɪθ/}}, plural ''myths'' {{IPA|/ˈmɪθ'''s'''/}}
# Otherwise, the preceding sound is voiced, and the plural marker takes the likewise voiced form {{IPA|/z/}}.
#*''dog'' {{IPA|/ˈdɒɡ/}}, plural ''dogs'' {{IPA|/ˈdɒɡ'''z'''/}}
#*''glove'' {{IPA|/ˈɡlʌv/}}, plural ''gloves'' {{IPA|/ˈɡlʌv'''z'''/}}
#*''ram'' {{IPA|/ˈræm/}}, plural ''rams'' {{IPA|/ˈræm'''z'''/}}
#*''doll'' {{IPA|/ˈdɒl/}}, plural ''dolls'' {{IPA|/ˈdɒl'''z'''/}}
#*''toe'' {{IPA|/ˈtoʊ/}}, plural ''toes'' {{IPA|/ˈtoʊ'''z'''/}}

==Alternation related to meaning==
{{main|Apophony}}

===Morphologically conditioned alternation===
[[French language|French]] has an example of morphologically conditioned alternation. The [[grammatical gender|feminine form]] of many [[adjective]]s ends in a [[consonant]] sound that is missing in the masculine form. In spelling, the feminine ends in a [[French phonology#Schwa|silent e]], while the masculine ends in a silent consonant letter:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Steriade |first=Donca |year=1999 |chapter=Lexical conservatism in French adjectival liaison |editor1=Jean-Marc Authier|editor2=Barbara E. Bullock|editor3=Lisa A. Reed |title=Formal Perspectives in Romance Linguistics |publisher=John Benjamins |pages=243–70 |chapterurl=http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/steriade/papers/FrenchLiaison.pdf |location=Amsterdam |isbn=90-272-3691-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*masculine ''petit'' {{IPA|[pəti]}}, feminine ''petite'' {{IPA|[pəti'''t''']}} "small"
*masculine ''grand'' {{IPA|[ɡʁɑ̃]}}, feminine ''grande'' {{IPA|[ɡʁɑ̃'''d''']}} "tall"
*masculine ''gros'' {{IPA|[ɡʁo]}}, feminine ''grosse'' {{IPA|[ɡʁo'''s''']}} "big"
*masculine ''joyeux'' {{IPA|[ʒwajø]}}, feminine ''joyeuse'' {{IPA|[ʒwajø'''z''']}} "merry"
*masculine ''franc'' {{IPA|[fʁɑ̃]}}, feminine ''franche'' {{IPA|[fʁɑ̃'''ʃ''']}} "sincere"
*masculine ''bon'' {{IPA|[bɔ̃]}}, feminine ''bonne'' {{IPA|[bɔ'''n''']}} "good"

===Syntactically conditioned alternation===
Syntactically conditioned alternations can be found in the [[Insular Celtic languages]], where words undergo various initial [[consonant mutation]]s depending on their syntactic position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Green |first=Antony D. |year=2006 |title=The independence of phonology and morphology: The Celtic mutations |journal=Lingua |volume=116 |pages=1946–1985 |url=http://roa.rutgers.edu/files/652-0404/652-GREEN-0-0.PDF |doi=10.1016/j.lingua.2004.09.002 |issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Irish language|Irish]], an adjective undergoes [[Irish initial mutations#Lenition|lenition]] after a feminine singular noun:
*unmutated ''mór'' {{IPA|['''mˠ'''oːɾˠ]}} "big", mutated in ''bean mhór'' {{IPA|[bʲan '''w'''oːɾˠ]}} "a big woman"
In [[Welsh language|Welsh]], a [[noun]] undergoes [[Welsh morphology#Soft mutation|soft mutation]] when it is the direct [[object (grammar)|object]] of a [[finite verb]]:
*unmutated ''beic'' {{IPA|['''b'''əik]}} "bike", mutated in ''Prynodd y ddynes feic'' {{IPA|[ˈprənoð ə ˈðənɛs '''v'''əik]}} "The woman bought a bike"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9502">The first portion of the Bible, the [[Gospel of John]], in a [[Tibetic language]] was translated by [[Moravian Church]] missionaries William Heyde, Edward Pagel, and [[Heinrich August Jäschke]], and later Dr. [[August Hermann Francke (Tibetologist)|August Francke]]. It was printed in 1862 at [[Keylong|Kyelang]] capital of [[Lahaul|Lahul]] in Kashmir. The whole New Testament was printed in 1885 in [[Ladakh]]. Another version was translated in 1903. So as not to have the problem of various dialectal differences it was translated into classical Tibetan, but this was not understood by most people. [[Yoseb Gergen]] (aka Sonam Gergen), a Tibetan Christian translated the entire Bible, complete in 1935. This version was translated into a dialect of Tibetan Gergen had accidentally stumbled across, and which was understandable by all Tibetans. It was finally published in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;''God Spoke Tibetan'', by Alan Maberly, http://www.nwtv.co.uk/pages/arts/books/books/tibet/chap01.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This is known in India as the Tibetan OV Bible.&lt;ref&gt;(Tibetan Edition) (9788122115451)&lt;/ref&gt; Eliya Tsetan Phuntshog published a New Testament in 1970. There is currently a project going on to translate the Bible into the East Tibetan dialect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gsungrab.org/ Tibetan Bible Website&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Language and location ==
[[File:Tibetan Languages in India and Pakistan minor correction.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Western Tibetan languages]]
Recent research has shown there are approximately 50 Tibetan languages and over 200 varieties of Tibetan.&lt;ref name="Tournadre"&gt;Nicolas Tournadre, 2014 "The Tibetic Languages and their classification" In Nathan W. HIll and Thomas Owen-Smith (eds.) Trans-Himalayan Linguistics, Historical and descriptive Linguistics of the Himalayan area, 105-129. Mouton de Gruyter&lt;/ref&gt;

== Register ==
The complex task of translating the Scriptures into the different varieties of Tibetan is made more difficult by the need to choose between different linguistic [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]]. These are: the high literary register (the language used for the Tibetan Buddhist scriptures, also known as chos skad); the mid literary register (a mixture of high literary and some known common spoken and non-spoken words); and one of many varieties of the low register (the vernacular/spoken language), which are specific to particular regions.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sil.org/system/files/reapdata/25/97/22/25972228094121828277416194632503321089/silesr2012_019.pdf|title= R.Jeffery Green, 2012, "Amdo Tibetan Media Intelligibility" by  Electronic Survey Report 2012-019, SIL International DigitalResources |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

There are advantages and disadvantages of translating into each different register. A translation into one of the varieties of the low register will be easily understood in one specific region but its geographical reach will be limited,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Heinrich August Jaeschke: Pioneer Tibetan Scholar, by John Bray, The Tibet Journal, Vol. 8, No. 1 (Spring 1983), pp. 50-55, Published by: Library of Tibetan Works and Archives&lt;/ref&gt; and it will be seen as less prestigious than the high and mid registers. Mid Literary is more difficult to understand than the spoken language but has a wider geographical reach. The high literary register can reach even further geographically but it requires people first to learn a literary language in order to understand what is written in it.&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== History of translations into Mid and High Literary registers ==
The [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] missionary [[Heinrich August Jäschke|H. A. Jäschke]] (1817–1883) spent three months in [[Ladakh]] in 1857, and subsequently worked in [[Keylong]] (Lahul) until 1868. He studied the spoken languages of the region. However, he decided to translate the [[New Testament]] into [[Classical Tibetan]], drawing on the assistance and advice of speakers and scholars of different forms of Tibetan in both the [[Western Himalaya]]n region and [[Darjeeling]]. He hoped that his choice of language would ensure that the written text would be widely understood across Tibet and the Himalayan border regions.&lt;ref name="ladakhstudies.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladakhstudies.org/ialsresources/downloads/rrol3download_files/7RROL3bray.pdf|title=  A History of the Moravian Church's Tibetan Bible Translations by John Bray|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jäschke’s successor F. A. Redslob (1838–1891) completed the translation of the New Testament in 1885. Between 1898 and 1902, a committee chaired by another Moravian missionary A. W. Heyde (1825–1907) prepared a revised version of the Tibetan New Testament under the sponsorship of the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]].&lt;ref name="ladakhstudies.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladakhstudies.org/ialsresources/downloads/rrol3download_files/7RROL3bray.pdf|title=  A History of the Moravian Church's Tibetan Bible Translations by John Bray|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[August Hermann Francke (Tibetologist)|Dr A. H. Francke]] (1870–1930) and his Ladakhi colleague Yoseb Gergan (1878–1946) translated the [[Old Testament]] into Classical Tibetan. The draft translation of the Old Testament was completed by 1935, but the full Tibetan Bible was not published until 1948.&lt;ref name="ladakhstudies.org"/&gt;

In 1959, Eliyah Tsetan Phuntsog (son-in-law of Yoseb Gergan) &lt;ref name="ladakhstudies.org"/&gt; started to revise the New Testament with Pierre Vittoz (a Swiss missionary). They translated it into a Mid Literary register, hoping that this would be accessible to the various Tibetan-speaking peoples in both India and Tibet. This version was published in 1970.&lt;ref name="ladakhstudies.org"/&gt; However, most of the Ladakhis who were not trained in the Literary register found all these versions difficult to understand.&lt;ref name="ladakhstudies.org"/&gt;

==Ladakhi==
[[Ladakhi language|Ladakhi]] is a language spoken in India in regions bordering both [[China]] and [[Pakistan]]; its neighbouring languages are [[Purik language|Purik]], [[Balti language|Balti]], [[Zangskari dialect|Zanskari]], Nubra, and the more divergent [[Changthang language|Changthang]] (see map). All these languages are part of the Western Tibetan language grouping&lt;ref name="Tournadre"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/lbj/|title=Ethnologue: Ladakhi language|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bettina Zeisler, 2007 "On the position of Ladakhi and Balti in the Tibetan language family" In: John Bray and Nawang Tsering Shakspo (eds.) Recent research on Ladakh 2007. Leh: J &amp; K Academy for Art, Culture &amp; Science, International Association for Ladakh Studies: 27-33.&lt;/ref&gt; and quite distinct from the [[Central Tibetan language|Central]], [[Amdo Tibetan|Amdo]] and [[Khams Tibetan]] spoken varieties. 

Alongside his main Tibetan translation work, Jäschke translated the ''Harmony of the Gospels'', a selection of texts used by the Moravian church in Easter Week, into vernacular Ladakhi. He noticed that the Ladakhi Christians were more attentive when listening to the Harmony, than they were when they heard texts written in the High Register of Classical Tibetan.&lt;ref name="ladakhstudies.org"/&gt;

Like Jäschke, Francke put his main efforts into Bible translation into literary Tibetan. However, he also emphasised the need to translate at least some portions of the Bible into the spoken languages of the region.&lt;ref name="Francke"&gt;Francke, A.H. 1910. “Die Sprachenfrage in der west-tibetischen Mission der Brüdergemeine.” Allgemeine Missions-Zeitschrift 37, pp. 412-420; pp. 448-454. Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, he printed a revised version of Jäschke’s ''Harmony''. He also prepared a Ladakhi ''Life of Christ'', and in 1908, he published a Ladakhi version of [[Mark's Gospel]].&lt;ref name="Francke"/&gt; Yoseb Gergan produced a revised version of the Ladakhi St Mark, and this was published at [[Lahore]] in 1919.&lt;ref name="ladakhstudies.org"/&gt;

These early vernacular translations adapted the classical literary spelling system rather than using a phonetic transcription of spoken Ladakhi.  In the early 1950s, E. T. Phuntsog experimented with a greatly simplified spelling system for writing Ladakhi.&lt;ref name="Bray 2"&gt; John Bray "Towards a Tibetan Christianity? The Lives of Joseph Gergan and Eliyah Tsetan Phuntsog. In Tibetan Studies Vol. 1, pp 68-80, Edited by Per Kvaerne. Oslo: Institute for Comparative Research in Human Culture, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; However, he ran into opposition from a segment of the Ladakhi community who wanted to preserve the classical spelling system of the Buddhist Scriptures. Phuntsog translated excerpts from the Gospels of St Mark and St Luke using this script. However, his proposals were never accepted outside the small Christian community, and he was forced to put them on one side.&lt;ref name="Bray 2"/&gt;

Today there is an ongoing project to translate the complete Bible into the low register of spoken Ladakhi (Zhung/Leh dialect)&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com" /&gt; using a more phonemic spelling structure.&lt;ref name="LadakhiBible"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladakhibible.org/en/news/|title=Ladakhi Bible Translation News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the New Testament and Genesis 1-16 have been completed.&lt;ref name="LadakhiBible"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8196">'''The campaign rhetoric of Barack Obama''' is the [[rhetoric]] in the campaign speeches given by [[President of the United States]], [[Barack Obama]], between February 10, 2007 and November 5, 2008 for the [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]].  Obama became the 44th president after [[George W. Bush]] with running mate [[Joe Biden]].  In his campaign rhetoric, Obama used three main devices: motifs, American exceptionalism, and voicing.

==List of Notable Speeches==
* July 27, 2004, Boston, MA: [[2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address]]
* March 18, 2008, Philadelphia, PA: [[A More Perfect Union (speech)|A More Perfect Union]]
* November 5, 2008, Chicago, IL: [[Barack Obama election victory speech, 2008]]

==Motifs==
A [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] is a rhetorical device that involves the repeated presence of a concept, which heightens its importance in a speech and draws attention to the idea.  Obama's motifs became so recognizable that the main motifs, change and hope, became the themes for the 2008 presidential campaign of every candidate, from Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] and Senator [[John McCain]].&lt;ref name="Ivie"/&gt;

===Change===
Change was Obama's fundamental motif in his campaign for Republican, Democratic, and undecided audiences.&lt;ref name="Ivie"/&gt;  In addition to inspiring his [[Yes We Can (slogan)|Yes We Can]] campaign slogan, the [[ideology]] of change separated Obama from his opponents.&lt;ref name="Ivie"/&gt;  During his campaign, change was the second most stated concept in Obama's speeches, falling behind the economy.&lt;ref name="Coe &amp; Reitzes"/&gt;  Change also became a part of Obama's slogan, "Change we can believe in," which appeared on banners, podiums, and posters.

===Hope===
Hope supported the idea that change was possible and symbolized the hope that Obama could become the first African American president of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Atwater, D. F. (2007). Senator Barack Obama: the rhetoric of hope and the American dream. Journal of Black Studies, 38(2), doi: 27130620&lt;/ref&gt;  Hope became another repeated topic and theme in the campaign, being the fourth most stated concept behind the economy, change, and security.&lt;ref name="Coe &amp; Reitzes"&gt;Coe, K., &amp; Reitzes, M. (2010). Obama on the stump: features and determinants of a rhetorical approach. Presidential Studies Quarterly, 40(3), {{doi|10.1111/j.1741-5705.2010.03777.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below is an example of hope as a motif from Obama's 2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address:

"Hope in the face of difficulty. Hope in the face of uncertainty. The audacity of hope!" &lt;ref name="Obama"/&gt;

==American Exceptionalism==

American exceptionalism is a [[rhetorical device]] that elicits support from the audience and convinces listeners that the speaker can restore the United States to greatness.&lt;ref name="Ivie"/&gt;  Using American exceptionalism promoted confidence in Obama, his campaign, and the national identity of the United States.  American exceptionalism helped Obama establish a separation between the old administration and his new leadership.&lt;ref name="Ivie"/&gt;

[[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Bill Clinton]], and [[Ronald Reagan]] are other politicians known for their use of American exceptionalism to further the ideal that the United States is the hegemon of the world.&lt;ref name="Ivie"&gt;Ivie, R. L., &amp; Giner, O. (2009). American exceptionalism in a democratic idiom: transacting the mythos of change in the 2008 presidential campaign. Communication Studies, 60(4), {{doi|10.1080/10510970903109961}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although related to [[patriotism]], [[exceptionalism]] is a stronger belief that the United States is the exception to the rules of history.&lt;ref name="Ivie"/&gt;

===Praise===
Speakers can praise the United States and its greatness to draw pride from the audience.&lt;ref name="Ivie"/&gt; Below is an example of American exceptionalism from Obama on a campaign stop in Toledo, Ohio on October 13, 2008:

"I know these are difficult times. I know folks are worried. But I also know this - we can steer ourselves out of this crisis. Because we are the United States of America. We are the country that has faced down war and depression; great challenges and great threats. And at each and every moment, we have risen to meet these challenges - not as Democrats, not as Republicans, but as Americans.  We still have the most talented, most productive workers of any country on Earth. We're still home to innovation and technology, colleges and universities that are the envy of the world. Some of the biggest ideas in history have come from our small businesses and our research facilities. It won't be easy, but there's no reason we can't make this century another American century." &lt;ref name="Obama"/&gt;

This quote praises America's ability to rise against the odds.  Obama's use of exceptionalism became symbolic of a fight to restore and renew America back to its glory days and avoid the status quo.&lt;ref name="Ivie"/&gt;

===Negation===
American exceptionalism is also used in the form of [[negation]], where the speaker describes what the United States is not.  Negation exceptionalism promotes the greatness of the country by describing negative qualities the country does not embody.  Obama used negation exceptionalism in a health care speech delivered in Newport News, Virginia on October 4, 2008:

"We are not a country that rewards hard work and perseverance with debt and worry. We've never been a country that lets major challenges go unsolved and unaddressed. And we are tired of watching as year after year, candidates offer up detailed health care plans with great fanfare and promise, only to see them crushed under the weight of Washington politics and drug and insurance lobbying once the campaign is over. That is not who we are. And that is not who we have to be." &lt;ref name="Obama"&gt;Organizing for America, Initials. (2009). Obama speeches. Retrieved from http://www.barackobama.com/speeches/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206054036/http://www.barackobama.com/speeches/# |date=2010-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This passage presents ideas that are contrary to the superiority and [[national autonomy]] of the United States of America, but by negating them, shows what the United States can hope to accomplish.

==Voicing==
Voicing is using the voice of another within a speech to create proximity and credibility.&lt;ref name="Capone"/&gt; Obama quoted famous Americans, such as [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and personal stories from everyday Americans, which helps the audience connect emotionally with the speech.&lt;ref name="Capone"&gt;Capone, A. (2010). Barack Obama's South Carolina speech. Journal of Pragmatics, 42(11), {{doi|10.1016/j.pragma.2010.06.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voicing is a powerful rhetorical device because the audience can engage in the speech by reacting through chants, cheers, and vocalizations &lt;ref name="Capone"/&gt; Voicing changes the definitions of roles so that the speaker is not the only active participant.&lt;ref name="Capone"/&gt;

In a January 26, 2008 speech in South Carolina, Obama told three stories of a woman struggling to make ends meet, a man who cannot find work, and a woman who is waiting for her son to return from Iraq.&lt;ref name="Capone"/&gt; Obama was able to borrow the voices of these Americans in his speeches, making himself the speaker of and an audience member to these stories.&lt;ref name="Capone"/&gt;

Other rhetorical devices Obama used in his campaign speeches were [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|repetition]], [[metaphor]], [[personification]], [[Climax (figure of speech)|climax]], and [[allusion]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6228">The '''chain of survival''' refers to a series of actions that, properly executed, reduce the mortality associated with [[cardiac arrest]].&lt;ref name="ECC_2000_P12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bossaert_BJA"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bossaert LL |title=Fibrillation and defibrillation of the heart |journal=British Journal of Anaesthesia |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=203–13 |year=1997 |pmid=9349131 |doi=10.1093/bja/79.2.203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like any chain, the chain of survival is only as strong as its weakest link.&lt;ref name="ECC_2000_P12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bossaert_BJA"/&gt; The four interdependent links in the chain of survival are early access, early [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]], early defibrillation, and early [[advanced cardiac life support]]

== Background ==
The "chain of survival" metaphor was first published in the March 1981 newsletter of CPR for Citizens in Orlando, Florida. It was further developed by Mary M. Newman of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation, and used as a slogan for the 1988 Conference on Citizen CPR, and described in an article she wrote for the Journal of Emergency Medical Services in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Newman M | title=The chain of survival concept takes hold | journal=JEMS | year=1989 | volume=14 | pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in an editorial she wrote for the first issue of Currents in Emergency Cardiac Care in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Newman MM | title=The Chain of Survival: Converting a Nation | journal=Currents in Emergency Cardiac Care | year=1990 | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Heart Association adopted the concept and elaborated on it in its 1992 guidelines for [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] and emergency cardiac care,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cummins RO, Ornato JP, Thies WH, Pepe PE |title=Improving survival from sudden cardiac arrest: the "chain of survival" concept. A statement for health professionals from the Advanced Cardiac Life Support Subcommittee and the Emergency Cardiac Care Committee, American Heart Association |journal=Circulation |volume=83 |issue=5 |pages=1832–47 |year=1991 |pmid=2022039 |doi=10.1161/01.cir.83.5.1832}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiac care. Emergency Cardiac Care Committee and Subcommittees, American Heart Association. Part I. Introduction |journal=JAMA |volume=268 |issue=16 |pages=2171–83 |year=1992 |pmid=1404767 |doi=10.1001/jama.268.16.2171}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) echoed the concept in 1997.&lt;ref name="ECC_2000_P12"&gt;[http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/102/suppl_1/I-358 "Part 12: From Science to Survival - Strengthening the Chain of Survival in Every Community,"] ''Circulation'' 2000;102:I-358&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early access ==
Ideally, someone must recognize an impending cardiac arrest or otherwise witness the cardiac arrest and activate the [[Emergency Medical Services|EMS system]] as early as possible&lt;ref name="ECC_2000_P12"/&gt; with an immediate call to the emergency services.&lt;ref name="AHA_SCOS"&gt;[http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3010774 "Strengthening Each Link in the Chain of Survival,"] ''[[American Heart Association]]'', Accessed July 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, many persons experiencing symptoms (for example, angina) that may lead to a cardiac arrest ignore these warning symptoms or, recognizing these warning symptoms correctly, fail to activate the EMS system, preferring to contact relatives instead (the elderly often contact their adult offspring rather than contact emergency services).

== Early CPR ==
To be most effective, bystanders should provide CPR immediately after a patient collapses.&lt;ref name="ECC_2000_P12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eisenberg MS, Bergner L, Hallstrom A |title=Cardiac resuscitation in the community. Importance of rapid provision and implications for program planning |journal=JAMA |volume=241 |issue=18 |pages=1905–7 |year=1979 |pmid=430772 |doi=10.1001/jama.241.18.1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; Properly performed CPR can keep the heart in a shockable [[ventricular fibrillation]] for 10–12 minutes longer.&lt;ref name="Bossaert_BJA"/&gt;

== Early defibrillation ==
Most adults who can be saved from cardiac arrest are in [[ventricular fibrillation]] or pulseless [[ventricular tachycardia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/95/8/2183 "Early Defibrillation,"] ''Circulation'' 1997;95:2183-2184.&lt;/ref&gt; Early defibrillation is the link in the chain most likely to improve survival.&lt;ref name="ECC_2000_P12"/&gt; Public access defibillation may be the key to improving survival rates in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,&lt;ref name="ECC_2000_P12"/&gt; but is of the greatest value when the other links in the chain do not fail.&lt;ref name="Bossaert_BJA"/&gt;

== Early advanced care ==
Early [[advanced cardiac life support]] by paramedics is another critical link in the chain of survival.&lt;ref name="ECC_2000_P12"/&gt; In communities with survival rates &gt; 20%, a minimum of two of the rescuers are trained to the advanced level.&lt;ref name="ECC_2000_P12"/&gt; In some countries, EMS delivery may be performed by ambulance officers, paramedics, nurses, or doctors.&lt;ref name="Bossaert_BJA"/&gt;

'''Cumulative environmental effects''' can be defined as effects on the environment which are caused by the combined results of past, current and future activities.&lt;ref name="Elvin and Fraser"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elvin|first1=Sandra S.|last2=Fraser|first2=Gail S.|title=Advancing A National Strategic Environmental Assessment For The Canadian Offshore Oil And Gas Industry With Special Emphasis On Cumulative Effects.|journal=Journal of Environmental Assessment Policy &amp; Management|date=March 14, 2012|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the  precise definition of a cumulative effect varies from nation-to-nation, most use a definition similar to that defined under the US National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations. The NEPA regulations define a cumulative effect (AKA cumulative impact) as:

{{block quote|Cumulative impact is the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such other actions. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cumulative Impacts|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/environ_policy_guidance/policy/faa_nepa_order/desk_ref/media/15-cumulative-impacts.pdf|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Over time, direct and indirect [[Human impact on the environment|human activities]] combine to collectively impact the environment. These effects may differ from the original, individual activities. For example, ecosystems can be damaged by the combined effects of human activities, such as [[Air pollution|air]], [[Pollution|land]], and/or [[water pollution]], improper handling of [[industrial waste]], and other human development activities. [[Global warming]] is the cumulative effect caused by too much [[greenhouse gas]], and it may then cause a loss in [[biodiversity]] and [[acid rain]].&lt;br /&gt; &lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Greenhouse gases.png|thumbnail|These charts show greenhouse gases from eight different categories of sources. The top chart shows each sources contribution to the overall amount of greenhouse gases that are emitted annually. The bottom shows three primary greenhouse gases and their origins.]] --&gt; North America has contributed to creating various cumulative effects on the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Many states in the United States have inadequate or no formal environmental review requirements in order to assess the cumulative effects on the environment from harmful practices. The extent to which cumulative effects in each state are evaluated varies greatly. For example, some programs only require an assessment on specific natural resource issues and others require comprehensive examination of cumulative effects on the environment.&lt;ref name="Ma, Becker, and Kilgore"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ma|first1=Zhao|last2=Becker|first2=Dennis R.|last3=Kilgore|first3=Michael A.|title=Barriers To And Opportunities For Effective Cumulative Impact Assessment Within State-Level Environmental Review Frameworks In The United States.|journal=Journal of Environmental Planning &amp; Management|pages=17|accessdate=November 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Environmental impact assessment|Environmental assessments]] are a necessity to ensure the further advancement of healthy [[ecosystem]]s, [[habitat]]s, and [[wildlife]].

== Contributors and types ==
The concept of cumulative effects is based on the fact that little things, when combined together, form a larger result. For example, "a single automobile, a small clear- cut in a forest, or a single septic tank is unlikely to have a measurable effect on air quality, [[Surface runoff|runoff]], or [[water quality]], respectively. However, with increasing numbers of cars, clear-cuts, or septic tanks, the likelihood of a detectable change increases. This change results from multiple activities at different locations, this type of cumulative effect occurs either off-site or across a large area, such as an [[Atmosphere of Earth|airshed]]".&lt;ref name=MacDonald /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Human disturbances in the environment create cumulative effects. The human "footprint" is a major driver of biodiversity change and cumulative effects over time, some examples are physical disturbances from activities such as [[energy development]], cultivation, [[Deforestation|forest harvesting]], and [[Transport#Infrastructure|transportation infrastructure]].&lt;ref name=Burton&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burton|first1=A. Cole|title=A Framework For Adaptive Monitoring Of The Cumulative Effects Of Human Footprint On Biodiversity.|journal=Environmental Monitoring And Assessment|pages=13|accessdate=November 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oil and gas ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bird in Oil Spill.jpg|thumbnail|A bird covered in oil from an oil spill.]] --&gt;
Canada’s offshore [[Petroleum industry|oil and gas industry]] creates cumulative environmental effects, such as [[noise pollution]], which can affect whales, and [[Oil spill|oil pollution]], which if exposed to seabirds can kill them. Oil and gas activities are usually only thought to be affecting one region of an [[ecosystem]], but it is important to realize the connective nature of populations in different regions. Oil and gas activities can even disrupt the population of a species that is in more than one region of Canada. These effects may harm [[Animal migration|migrating populations]], so every aspect must be considered in the management of offshore oil and gas activities in Canada.&lt;ref name="Elvin and Fraser" /&gt;

=== Air pollution ===
[[Air pollution]] is caused by [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[nitrous oxide]] human emissions, such as [[electricity generation]], [[Factory|factories]], and [[vehicle]]s. "Electrical power complexes using coal are among the greatest contributors to gaseous pollutions that are responsible for [[Acid rain|acidic rain]]. The gases can be carried hundreds of kilometers in the atmosphere before they are converted to acids and deposited," which can then cause widespread ecological damage.

=== Global warming ===
[[Global warming]] is caused primarily by [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]], human caused, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions [[greenhouse gases]]. Other cumulative effects include [[ocean acidification]], caused by increasing amounts of [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere, resulting from human actions. Also the long-term melting of [[ice sheets]], from global temperature increases, contributes to [[sea level]] rising.

=== Not recycling ===
If we do not [[Recycling|recycle]] recyclable materials it will increase [[air pollution]] (from [[incineration]]) and [[water pollution]] (from [[landfill]]ing), and increase [[greenhouse gas]] emissions caused by plastic production. These are negative contributors to cumulative environmental effects that can cause [[global warming]].

== Policies ==
The United States uses a cumulative impact assessment (CIA), also referred to as cumulative effects assessment (CEA), which is a process that identifies additive or interactive environmental effects occurring from [[Human impact on the environment|human activities]] over time in order to then avoid cumulative environmental effects.&lt;ref name="Ma, Becker, and Kilgore" /&gt; This is an effective potential policy that can also help in productive [[environmental planning]] and management. Most development activities have individually minor impacts but collectively over time their impact on the environment is more substantial. In many countries, CIA is undertaken as part of the [[environmental impact assessment]] (EIA) process.&lt;ref name="Ma, Becker, and Kilgore" /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Landscape management, such as creating [[Nature reserve|wildlife reserves]] will help to ensure human development can not occur there and therefore reduce cumulative effects in that area.
In many cases in the United States the government will not fund these environmental assessments because it requires great funding over a long term.

== Solutions ==
A strategic [[environmental impact assessment|environmental assessment]] is necessary to generate safer policies and programs for future industrial activities, while also being aware of environmental concerns from all potential sources.&lt;ref name="Elvin and Fraser" /&gt; The large number of resources and the many ways by which these resources can be affected make cumulative effect assessments problematic.&lt;ref name=MacDonald /&gt;

Two ideas for improvement on United States' environmental review programs with CIA requirements are, creating detailed guidelines to specify what to include in a CIA and implementing better coordination between the agency responsible for carrying out CIA (the permitting and/or funding agency) and other relevant state agencies. Both ideas suggest that future effort to improve CIA practices should focus on strengthening the state’s environmental review programs ability to carry out CIA implementation. Also, including detailed guidelines will support the development of a definition of CI, clarify the steps required to conduct an assessment and specify content to be included in the write-up.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Three major problems were identified by administrators of environmental review programs with CIA requirements, they are a lack of specific procedures, unavailable data, and unclear definitions of cumulative effects. These are imperative problems to solve to then be able to properly manage activities contributing to cumulative effects.&lt;ref name="Ma, Becker, and Kilgore" /&gt; There is a reluctance{{by whom|date=November 2014}} to start a cumulative effect analysis in some cases due to the cost of the analysis, as well as the problems of uncertainty and complexity.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Annual carbon emissions.jpg|thumbnail|Chart of annual carbon emissions by continent.]] --&gt;

In order to stabilize the global average temperature, to decrease the cumulative effects of [[global warming]], the world would need to reduce [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions]], and also [[methane]] and [[nitrous oxide]] emissions. "For CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] emissions would need to be reduced by more than 80% relative to their peak level" to reduce the effect of global warming.

== Impacts and significance ==
The lack of [[Environmental impact assessment|environmental assessments]] can cause harm to [[wildlife]] populations and the [[habitat]]s that are dependent on [[Marine ecosystem|ocean ecosystems]] (specifically in the problem with offshore [[Petroleum industry|oil and gas industries]]), especially as these effects become additive, exponentially larger, and more harmful.&lt;ref name="Elvin and Fraser" /&gt;

[[Environmental planning]] and management need to include cumulative effects as their top priority. Our ability to assess cumulative effects is hindered by the lack of information on past management activities and the uncertainty of future events. Secondary and interacting effects make it even more complex to assess current and potential cumulative effects.&lt;ref name=MacDonald&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacDonald|first1=Lee H.|title=Evaluating And Managing Cumulative Effects: Process And Constraints.|journal=Environmental Management|pages=16|doi=10.1007/s002670010088|volume=26}}&lt;!--|accessdate=November 8, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cumulative Impact Paradox ==
The very definition of a "cumulative effect" and its assessment in terms of cumulative significance" can result in a paradox. As defined pursuant to the US [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA), a strict interpretation of a cumulative Impact implies that a categorical exclusion (CATX) or [[National Environmental Policy Act|environmental assessment]]/[[Finding Of No Significant Impact|Finding of no significant impact]] (EA/FONSI) cannot be applied to any proposal that adds any contribution to a cumulative impact that has already breached the threshold of significance. Thus, if an environmental resource has already sustained a cumulatively significant impact, a decision-maker cannot declare that a proposed action contributing any incremental impact (however small) is eligible for a CATX or EA/FONSI? Yet, CATXs and EA/FONSIs are routinely (i.e., incorrectly) applied for virtually all Federal proposed actions that have already sustained cumulatively significant impacts.

Considering NEPA’s regulatory definitions and requirements, many (if not most) activities for which EAs (and CATXs) are currently prepared should actually be ineligible for a FONSI, therefore requiring preparation of an [[environmental impact statement]] (EIS); yet, strict compliance with NEPA’s regulatory provisions would result in an unreasonable and voluminous increase in the number of required EISs (even where the incremental impacts would be relatively small) and, in many areas, might render the concept of a CATX/FONSI next to useless.

For instance, in the example of the downtown area described above, a strict interpretation of cumulative significance could lead to the conclusion that a Federal agency would have to prepare an EIS to construct something as mundane as a stoplight, walkway, or small parking lot if an environmental resource such as air quality or noise is already cumulatively significant. Clearly, a strict interpretation of NEPA’s regulatory requirements can lead to absurd, unreasonable, and politically unacceptable results. ''Eccleston’s Paradox'' refers to:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Eccleston, Charles H. (2008). NEPA and Environmental Planning: Tools, Techniques, and Approaches for Practitioners. Chapter 9. CRC Press. ISBN 9780849375590.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Preparing-NEPA-Environmental-Assessments-Professional/dp/1439808821/ref=sr_1_11?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1502147237&amp;sr=1-11&amp;keywords=nepa]

''The illogical, unreasonable, or absurd situation in which CATXs or EA/FONSIs are routinely applied to relatively mundane actions in areas that have sustained cumulatively significant impacts, yet the application of these streamlining provisions violates the cumulative impact regulatory constraints placed on their very use.''&lt;ref name="Eccleston, Charles H. 2011"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Impact Assessment: A Guide to Best Professional Practices. Chapter 1|isbn=978-1439828731|last=Eccleston|first=Charles H.|publisher=|year=2011|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other nations are also confronted with the similar paradoxes. To resolve this paradox, Eccleston developed a technique known as the ''Significant Departure Principle'' (SDP).&lt;ref name="Eccleston, Charles H. 2011"/&gt; The SDP provides a practical solution for resolving this Paradox.

==Early life==

Laxmi Nani was born at Dhyākwachhen, [[Asan, Kathmandu|Asan]], a historical neighborhood in central Kathmandu. She was the fourth among seven siblings. Her father was Man Kaji and mother Ratna Maya [[Tuladhar]]. During Laxmi Nani's early years, it was difficult to receive an education, and for girls even more so. However, encouraged by a neighbourhood shopkeeper and her mother, she taught herself to read and write.

In 1909, Laxmi Nani was married to Sete Kaji [[Bania (Newar caste)|Bania]] of Itum Bahal who belonged to a family of hereditary herbalists. A son was born to her in 1916 who died in infancy. In 1919, her husband died when she was seven-months pregnant with their daughter. In 1927, her daughter died too. The loss of her entire family in a few years made her become more deeply involved in religious activities.&lt;ref name="LeVine 2005 Page 46"&gt;LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N. (2005).

Page 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tuladhar 2007 67"&gt;{{cite book |last= Tuladhar |first= Soongma |editor-first=Lochan Tara |editor-last=Tuladhar |title= Dharmachari Guruma |publisher= Kathmandu: Nirvana Murti Vihara |year=2007|page=67 |chapter= Following the Footprints of Dharmachari Guruma |isbn=978-99946-2-982-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dharma teacher==

As Laxmi Nani (alternative names: Laxmi Nāni Upāsikā, Laxmi Nāni Baniā) was literate and skilled in mixing herbal medicines, she was a respected member of the household. She fulfilled her responsibilities in the extended family even as she studied Buddhist books. She taught what she learned to a group of women students who met at [[Kindo Baha]], a 17th-century monastic courtyard at the foot of [[Swayambhu]]. The dilapidated monastery had been restored in 1926 by the efforts of Buddhist scholar [[Dharmaditya Dharmacharya]] and benefactor [[Dharma Man Tuladhar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=LeVine |first1=Sarah |last2=Gellner |first2=David N. |year=2005 |title=Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-01908-3}} Page 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gatherings at Kindo Baha attracted the attention of a suspicious government, and the women were hauled before the prime minister. He told them that studying religious books and speaking in front of a crowd was not for women, and that they should go home and look after their families. However, they continued to study in secret.&lt;ref name="LeVine 2005 Page 46"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tuladhar 2007 67"/&gt;

Laxmi Nani also composed hymns in the [[Newar language]]. Her composition was first printed in 1929 in the magazine ''[[Buddha Dharma wa Nepal Bhasa (magazine)|Buddha Dharma wa Nepal Bhasa]]'' published from [[Kolkata]]. The songs urged women to acquire an education and exposed social evils of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Tuladhar, Lochan Tara (2007). ''Dharmachari Guruma.'' Kathmandu: Nirvana Murti Vihara. {{ISBN|978-99946-2-982-4}}. Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ordination in Burma==

In 1930, the return to Nepal of [[Pragyananda Mahasthavir]], the first yellow-robed monk in the country since the 14th century, propelled the Theravada Buddhist movement further. Laxmi Nani and five of her companions decided to renounce lay life and be ordained as nuns. In 1934, she led her friends to [[Kushinagar]], India and then to a nunnery in Arakan, [[Burma]] where they received ordination. Laxmi Nani was given the dharma name Dharmachari. They returned to Kathmandu and continued their work at Kindo Baha.&lt;ref&gt;LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N. (2005). ''Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal.''

==Into exile==

Kindo Baha was turned into a center of Theravada Buddhism by the monks and nuns who were trained abroad. They conducted regular prayer meets, and the number of devotees coming to listen to their sermons kept increasing. As the crowds became larger, an intolerant government turned hostile. Spies hovered around Kindo Baha, and devotees had to face repeated police harassment. In 1944, the government took the extreme step of expelling all the monks in Kathmandu. A year later, the nuns were also banished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dietrich|first=Angela|title=Buddhist Monks and Rana Rulers: A History of Persecution|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BH/bh117536.htm|accessdate=19 August 2012|newspaper=Buddhist Himalaya: A Journal of Nagarjuna Institute of Exact Methods|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the monks had to leave Nepal, the women were sent to Trishuli, a day's journey to the north of Kathmandu on the way to [[Tibet]]. Here too, the nuns gave sermons and taught the [[Dharma]]. Their activities were reported to the prime minister; and barely a month after their arrival in Trishuli, the police came and marched them back to Kathmandu. They were kept at the police station at [[Durbar Square]] where they were questioned. They were freed the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Tuladhar, Lochan Tara (2007). ''Dharmachari Guruma.'' Kathmandu: Nirvana Murti Vihara. {{ISBN|978-99946-2-982-4}}. Pages 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, a [[Sri Lanka]]n goodwill mission visited Nepal and pleaded with the government on behalf of the banished monks. They were thus allowed to return and continue their activities unhindered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= LeVine |first=Sarah|title= The Finances of a Twentieth Century Buddhist Mission: Building Support for the Theravada Nuns' Order of Nepal |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:FDABnk6V4QAJ:archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/ojs/index.php/jiabs/article/download/8920/2813+laxmi+nani+tuladhar&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=np&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgY7G4anYCQtbUfDWd1e4VMsw2HOJYZMOpLn9bZoB0CmVSuDi5MjOdlceLrnR-wDFisl1PyzGSKF-Rmkpzk1Tk3zTj0BKSmyTK44d4dT0OzvRyQvcQ2WC18KId8XdPl-bkFZ9Te&amp;sig=AHIEtbTU0Ak2gzUFU3-oANoil9EKYqyy0A|accessdate=19 August 2012|newspaper= Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies |year=2001}} Page 224-225.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nirvana Murti Vihara==

Considering the crowded conditions at Kindo Baha, Dharmachari began work to establish a separate nunnery. She bought a piece of land nearby and raised funds to build a prayer hall and living quarters. In 1952, the nunnery with its centerpiece, a great statue of the reclining Buddha, was inaugurated. It is now known as Nirvana Murti Vihara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= LeVine |first=Sarah|title= The Finances of a Twentieth Century Buddhist Mission: Building Support for the Theravada Nuns' Order of Nepal |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:FDABnk6V4QAJ:archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/ojs/index.php/jiabs/article/download/8920/2813+laxmi+nani+tuladhar&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=np&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgY7G4anYCQtbUfDWd1e4VMsw2HOJYZMOpLn9bZoB0CmVSuDi5MjOdlceLrnR-wDFisl1PyzGSKF-Rmkpzk1Tk3zTj0BKSmyTK44d4dT0OzvRyQvcQ2WC18KId8XdPl-bkFZ9Te&amp;sig=AHIEtbTU0Ak2gzUFU3-oANoil9EKYqyy0A|accessdate=19 August 2012|newspaper= Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies |year=2001}} Page 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3010">A '''distributive pronoun''' considers members of a group separately, rather than collectively.

They include ''each, any, either, neither'' and others.

* "to each his own" — [http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/each 'each2,(pronoun)'] ''Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary'' (2007)
* "Men take each other's measure when they react." — [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]&lt;ref&gt;
[[William Malone Baskervill]] and [[James Witt Sewell]],
[http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/wmbaskervill/bl-wmbaskervill-grammar-syntax-pronouns.htm ''An English Grammar''], 1896.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides distributive [[pronoun]]s, there are also distributive [[determiner]]s (also called distributive adjectives). The pronouns and determiners often have the same form:
* '''''Each''' went his own way'' (''each'' used as a pronoun, without an accompanying noun)
* '''''Each''' man went his own way'' (''each'' used as a determiner, accompanying the noun ''man'')

==Languages other than English==

===Biblical Hebrew===
A common distributive idiom in [[Biblical Hebrew]] used an ordinary word for man, '''ish'' ({{Hebrew|איש}}). [[Brown Driver Briggs]] only provides four representative examples — Gn 9:5; 10:5; 40:5; Ex 12:3.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Brown Driver Briggs]]: 36.&lt;/ref&gt;
Of the many other examples of the idiom in the [[Hebrew Bible]], the best known is a common phrase used to describe everyone returning to their own homes. It is found in 1 Samuel 10:25 among other places.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{Hebrew|איש לביתו}}
*... '''ish l'beyto''.
*... a man to his house. [literal]
*... each went home. [sense]
This word, '''ish'', was often used to distinguish men from women. "She shall be called Woman ({{Hebrew|אשה}}) because she was taken out of Man ({{Hebrew|איש}}),"  is well known,&lt;ref&gt;[[King James Version of the Bible]]&lt;/ref&gt; but the distinction is also clear in Gn 19:8; 24:16 and 38:25 (see note for further references).&lt;ref&gt;Also Ex 22:15; Lv 15:16, 18; 20:10f; Nu 5:13f; Dt 22:22f; Is 4:1; and others. [[Brown Driver Briggs]]:35.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it could also be used [[Generic antecedents|generically]] in this distributive idiom (Jb 42:11; I Ch 16:3).&lt;ref&gt;[[Brown Driver Briggs]]:36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek===
The most common distributive pronoun in classical [[Greek language|Greek]] was ''hekastos'' ({{lang|grc|ἕκαστος}}, each).

The '''ethnography of communication''' (EOC), formerly called the '''ethnography of speaking''', is the analysis of [[communication]] within the wider context of the social and cultural practices and beliefs of the members of a particular culture or [[speech community]].&lt;ref name="Hymes 1964"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cameron"/&gt; It is a method of [[discourse analysis]] in [[linguistics]] that draws on the [[anthropology|anthropological]] field of [[ethnography]]. Unlike ethnography proper, though, EOC takes into account both the communicative form, which may include but is not limited to spoken language, and its function within the given culture.&lt;ref name="Cameron"/&gt;

General aims of this qualitative research method include being able to discern which communication acts and/or [[code (semiotics)|codes]] are important to different groups, what types of meanings groups apply to different communication events, and how group members learn these codes, in order to provide insight into particular communities.  This additional insight may be used to enhance communication with group members, make sense of group members’ decisions, and distinguish groups from one another, among other things.

==Origins==

[[Dell Hymes]] proposed the ethnography of communication as an approach towards analyzing patterns of language use within speech communities, in order to provide support for his idea of [[communicative competence]], which itself was a reaction to [[Noam Chomsky|Noam Chomsky's]] distinction between [[linguistic competence]] and [[linguistic performance]].&lt;ref name="Hymes 1976"/&gt;

Originally coined "''ethnography of speaking''" in [[Dell Hymes|Dell Hymes']] [[eponymous]] 1962 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hymes|first=Dell|chapter=The ethnography of speaking|editor1-last=Gladwin|editor1-first=Thomas|editor2-last=Sturtevant|editor2-first=William C.|title=Anthropology and Human Behavior|date=1962|publisher=Anthropology Society of Washington|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was redefined in his 1964 paper, ''Introduction: Toward Ethnographies of Communication'' to accommodate for the non-[[vocal]] and non-[[Words|verbal]] characteristics of communication,&lt;ref name = "Hymes 1964"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hymes|first1=Dell|title=Introduction: Toward Ethnographies of Communication|journal=American Anthropologist|date=1964|volume=66|issue=6|pages=1–34|doi=10.1525/aa.1964.66.suppl_3.02a00010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although most EOC researchers still tend to focus upon speaking as it is generally considered "to be a prominent - even primordial - means of communication."&lt;ref name="Lindlof"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindlof|first1=Thomas R.|last2=Taylor|first2=Bryan C.|title=Qualitative Communication Research Methods|date=2002|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks|isbn=0761924949|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "ethnography of communication" is meant to be descriptive of the characteristics that an approach towards language from an anthropological standpoint must take. Namely, according to Dell Hymes, it must 1) "investigate directly the use of language in contexts of situations so as to discern patterns proper to speech activity" and 2) "take as context a community, investigating its communicative habits as a whole."&lt;ref name="Hymes 1964"/&gt; In other words, rather than divorcing linguistic form from its function, the analysis of a culture's or community's communication, linguistic and otherwise, must occur with respect to the sociocultural context of its use and the functions of the meanings conveyed. As [[Deborah Cameron (linguist)|Deborah Cameron]] puts it, "If you are mainly concerned with the way a certain speech event fits into a whole network of cultural beliefs and practices, you will spend more time describing things that are external to the talk itself: who the speakers are, where they are, what beliefs and customs are important in their lives."&lt;ref name = "Cameron"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Deborah|title=Working with spoken discourse|date=2001|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|isbn=978-0761957737|pages=53–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

In their book ''Qualitative Communication Research Methods'', communications scholars Thomas R. Lindlof and Bryan C. Taylor explain, "Ethnography of communication conceptualizes communication as a continuous flow of information, rather than as a segmented exchange of messages."&lt;ref name="Lindlof"/&gt; According to Deborah Cameron, EOC can be thought of as the application of ethnographic methods to the communication patterns of a group.&lt;ref name = "Cameron"/&gt; Littlejohn and Foss recall that Dell Hymes suggests that "cultures communicate in different ways, but all forms of communication require a shared code, communicators who know and use the code, a channel, a setting, a message form, a topic, and an event created by transmission of the message."&lt;ref name="Littlejohn"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Littlejohn|first1=Stephen W.|last2=Foss|first2=Karen A.|title=Theories of Human Communication|date=2011|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Long Grove, Ill.|isbn=978-1577667063|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt; "EOC studies," according to Lindlof and Taylor, "produce highly detailed analysis of communication codes and their moment-to-moment functions in various contexts. In these analyses, speech communities are constituted in local and continuous performances of cultural and moral matters."&lt;ref name="Lindlof"/&gt;

EOC can be used as a means by which to study the interactions among members of a specific culture or "speech community,"  which is any group of people that creates and establishes its own speaking codes and norms.  [[Gerry Philipsen]] explained, "Each community has its own cultural values about speaking and these are linked to judgments of situational appropriateness."&lt;ref name="Philipsen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Philipsen|first1=Gerry|title=Speaking "like a man" in Teamsterville: Culture patterns of role enactment in an urban neighborhood|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|volume=61|issue=1|pages=13–22|doi=10.1080/00335637509383264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning and the understanding of the presence or absence of speech within different communities will vary. LLocal cultural patterns and norms must be understood to analyze and interpret the appropriateness of [[speech acts|speech act]] within specific communities. Thus, "the statement that talk is not anywhere valued equally in all social contexts suggests a research strategy for discovering and describing cultural or subcultural differences in the value of speaking. Speaking is one among other symbolic resources which are allocated and distributed in social situations according to distinctive culture patterns."&lt;ref name="Philipsen"/&gt;

Hymes also used EOC to argue against the strong view of the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]], the idea that one's language determines one's cognitive ability. While Hymes believed that one's language affected one's [[world view]], he argued that the extent of that effect depended "on the circumstances of its [[language acquisition|acquisition]], and its place in the linguistic repertoire of a person and a community."&lt;ref name="Hymes 1976"/&gt;

==The SPEAKING model==
{{main|Dell Hymes#The "S-P-E-A-K-I-N-G" model}}
A model that Hymes developed as a framework for the analysis of a speech event within its cultural context is the [[mnemonic]] SPEAKING model. The model consists of sixteen components, which Hymes believed were necessary to consider in order to accurately and satisfactorily describe any particular speech event: message form, message content, setting, scene, speaker/sender, addressor, hearer/receiver/audience, addressee, purposes (outcomes), purposes (goals), key, channels, forms of speech, norms of interaction, norms of interpretation, and [[Genre#Linguistics|genres]]. These sixteen components are organized into eight divisions to form the [[acronym]] SPEAKING.&lt;ref name="Hymes 1976"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hymes|first1=Dell|title=Foundations in sociolinguistics: An ethnographic approach|date=1976|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0812210651|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''S''' - ''setting and scene'': where the speech event is located in time and space
* '''P''' - ''participants'': who takes part in the speech event, and in what role (e.g. speaker, addressee, audience, eavesdropper)
* '''E''' - ''ends'': what the purpose of the speech event is, and what its outcome is meant to be
* '''A''' - ''act sequence'': what speech acts make up the speech event, and what order they are performed in
* '''K''' - ''key'': the tone or manner of performance (serious or joking, sincere or ironic, etc.)
* '''I''' - ''instrumentalities'': what channel or medium of communication is used (e.g. speaking, signing, writing, drumming, whistling), and what language/variety is selected from the participants' repertoire
* '''N''' - ''norms of interaction'': what the rules are for producing and interpreting speech acts
* '''G''' - ''genres'': what 'type' does a speech event belong to (e.g. interview, gossip), and what other pre-existing conventional forms of speech are drawn on or 'cited' in producing appropriate contributions to talk (e.g. do people quote from mythology or poetry or scripture?)&lt;ref name="Cameron"/&gt;

While the SPEAKING model is a valuable model to EOC, as well as the descriptive framework most commonly used in ethnography of communication, Cameron cautions that Hymes' model should be used more as a guide than a template, because adhering to it too narrowly may create a limiting view of the subject of its study. Ethnography of communication, according to Cameron, should strive not only to "address such 'descriptive' questions as 'what speech events occur in such-and-such a community?' and 'what are the components of speech events X, Y, and Z?'", but also to explain "why particular events occur and why they have particular characteristics."&lt;ref name="Cameron"/&gt;

==Notable studies==

Several research studies have used ethnography of communication as a methodological tool when conducting empirical research. Examples of this work include Philipsen’s study, which examined the ways in which blue-collar men living near Chicago spoke or did not speak based on communication context and personal identity relationship status (i.e. whether they were considered to be of symmetrical or asymmetrical social status).&lt;ref name="Philipsen"/&gt;  Other examples include Katriel’s study of Israeli communication acts involving griping and joking about national and public problems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katriel|first=T.|chapter='Griping’ as a verbal ritual in some Israeli discourse|editor1-last=Carbaugh|editor1-first=D.|title=Cultural Communication and Intercultural Contact|date=1990|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, NJ|pages=99–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Carbaugh's comparative studies of communication in a variety of intercultural contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carbaugh|first1=Donal|title=Cultures in conversation|date=2005|publisher=L. Erlbaum Assiociates|location=Mahwah N.J.|isbn=0-8058-5234-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies not only identify communication acts, codes, rules, functions, and norms, but they also offer different ways in which the method can be applied. Joel Sherzer's ''Kuna Ways of Speaking'' investigates the ways of speaking among the [[Kuna (people)|Kuna]] of Panama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sherzer|first1=Joel|title=Kuna ways of speaking: An ethnographic perspective|date=1983|publisher=The University of Texas Press|location=Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a landmark study that focuses on curing ways, everyday speaking, puberty rites, and gathering house speech-making. It was the first monograph that explicitly took an ethnography of speaking perspective to the whole range of verbal practices among a group of people.

The '''Garawan languages''' (Garrwan), or '''Yanyi''', are a small  [[language family]] of [[Australian Aboriginal languages]] currently spoken in northern Australia.

The languages are:
*[[Garawa language|Garawa]] (Garrwa, north)
*[[Waanyi language|Waanyi]] † (Wanji, south)
*[[Gunindiri language|Gunindiri]] † (Kurnindirri, southwest)
Gunindiri is almost entirely unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{AIATSIS|C23|Gunindiri}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garawan may be related to the [[Pama–Nyungan languages]], though this is not accepted in Bowern 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Bowern, Claire. 2011. "[http://anggarrgoon.wordpress.com/2011/12/23/how-many-languages-were-spoken-in-australia/ How Many Languages Were Spoken in Australia?]", ''Anggarrgoon: Australian languages on the web'', December 23, 2011 ([http://pamanyungan.sites.yale.edu/master-list-australian-languages-v12 corrected] February 6, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The languages are close: Dixon (2002) says that it should be straightforward to reconstruct proto-Garawa–Wanji.

'''Globish''' is a trademarked name for a subset of the English language formalized by Jean-Paul Nerrière.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20912132-29677,00.html "Globish now the lingua franca of world travellers"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414064151/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20912132-29677,00.html# |date=2009-04-14 }} ''The Australian'', December 12, 2006. &lt;!-- retrieved April 13, 2009 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It uses a subset of standard English grammar, and a list of 1500 English words. Nerrière claims it is "not a language" in and of itself,&lt;ref name="torontostar"&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/article/598048 "Parlez vous Globish? Probably, even if you don't know it"], ''Toronto Star'', March 7, 2009. &lt;!-- retrieved April 13, 2009 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but rather it is the common ground that non-native English speakers adopt in the context of international business.

== Origin and development of Globish ==
Jean-Paul Nerrière, the author of Globish presents it as a [[natural language]] as opposed to an artificial or [[constructed language]], claiming that it is a codification of a reduced set of English patterns as used by non-native speakers of the language.

The name ''Globish'' is a [[portmanteau]] of "global" and "English".  The first attested reference to the term to refer to a set of dialects of English spoken outside of traditional English speaking areas was in an issue of ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' in 1997:&lt;ref name=AmongTheNewWords&gt;''Among the New Words, 2007, American Speech 82.1 [[Georgia College &amp; State University]].&lt;/ref&gt;
: Indeed, the "globish" of world youth culture is more and more interactive. Non-Western forms of English now are as creative and lively as Chaucerian or Shakespearean or Dickensian English once were.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/1997/1229/122997.opin.opin.2.html 'Cultural Imperialism Aside, English Spans Linguistic Gulfs'], Nigel Young, professor of sociology, Colgate University in Hamilton, N.Y., ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', 29 December 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was then used in another context by [[Madhukar Gogate]] to describe his proposed [[Globish (Gogate)|artificial dialect based on English]] that he presented in 1998 to improve English spelling.

Nerrière's use of the term Globish is related to his claim that the language described in his books is naturally occurring. He has marked his codification of that language by taking out trademark protection on the term, as did [[I.A. Richards]] who trademarked ''[[Basic English]]'' in order to prevent dilution and misrepresentation of his work.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Basic English and Its Uses, W.W. Norton, 1943&lt;/ref&gt; Instances of attested prior usage, it can be seen, were incidental or not intended for the same purpose.

===Jean-Paul Nerrière===
Jean-Paul Nerrière, creator of Globish is a French computer engineer. Nerrière graduated with a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from École Centrale de Paris in 1963. 
Then he entered the French Naval Academy, with further specialization in law, accounting and administrator while serving as Supply Officer in the French Navy. He graduated from the
French Advanced Defence College and advancing to the rank of commander. He joined IBM France in 1965 in the Data Processing Division. In IBM, he spent almost three decades with responsibilities in sales, marketing, and management in France as well as in international headquarters.&lt;ref name=atlantico&gt;[http://www.atlantico.fr/fiche/jean-paul-nerriere-1666141 Atlantico.fr: Jean-Paul Nerrière Biography of Jean-Paul Nerrière]&lt;/ref&gt; He became an Assistant to Corporate President John Opel, later on the Operations General Manager of IBM France, then a Vice President at IBM Europe, and eventually the IBM USA Vice President in charge of International Marketing. In 1992, Nerriere moved to Automobiles Peugeot as their Commercial Director and as Senior Vice President of sales, marketing, and services and a member of Peugeot's Council of Directors Council. Then he was appointed CEO of Digital Equipment France (DEC), and soon thereafter was promoted to Vice President of Digital Equipment Europe. Jean-Paul Nerrière was knighted in Légion d'honneur, the highest official award available in France.

As an IBM executive and as a result of his vast travels, Jean-Paul Nerrière realized that a new global language was becoming more and more important.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; While serving as vice president of international marketing at IBM, Jean-Paul Nerriere first observed patterns of English that non-native English speakers used to communicate with each other in international conferences.&lt;ref name="torontostar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="observer"&gt;McCrum, Robert: [https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2006/dec/03/features.review37 "So, what's this Globish revolution?"] ''The Observer'', December 3, 2006. &lt;!-- retrieved April 13, 2009 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, he proposed Globish as an international language focussing most of his efforts to its promotion. He developed rules and training in the form of various publications to help non-native English speakers better communicate with each other by using Globish as a [[lingua franca]].&lt;ref name= "NLFupsetsFrench"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/7844192.stm "New lingua franca upsets French"] ''BBC News'', January 23, 2009. &lt;!-- retrieved April 13, 2009 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He conducted dozens of interviews and wrote or co-authored 6 books about Globish in four different languages.

===Promotion and publications===
Nerrière formulated his ideas in two books he authored, ''Decouvrez le globish'' (meaning Discover the Globish) and ''Do Not Speak English, Parlez Globish''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://public.oed.com/aspects-of-english/shapers-of-english/the-rise-of-global-english/ Oxford English Dictionary: The rise of global English]&lt;/ref&gt; Both books have been translated into a number of international languages. In French, he has published ''Parlez globish!: l'anglais planétaire du troisième millénaire'' and co-authored with Philippe Dufresne and Jacques Bourgon, the instruction book ''Découvrez le globish: l'anglais allégé en 26 étapes''.

Nerrière's 2004 codification work began to legitimize the language purpose to the extent it drew some press attention. Clearly, and with much subsequent reference, the term ''Globish'' has  grown increasingly as a generic term since the date of his first publications. Nerrière trademarked Globish as a subset of the English language formalized by him.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/frederickallen/2012/03/01/a-new-international-business-language-globish/#3aed811c52c2|author=Frederick E. Allen|title=A New International Business Language: Globish|publisher=''[[Forbes]]''|date=March 1, 2012|accessdate=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20912132-29677,00.html "Globish now the lingua franca of world travellers"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414064151/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20912132-29677,00.html# |date=2009-04-14 }} ''The Australian'', December 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He also launched the website globish.com to promote his ideas.

In 2009, intending to demonstrate that "Good Globish is correct English", Nerriere and David Hon published ''Globish the World Over'', the first book written entirely in Globish-English. [[Robert McCrum]], literary editor of ''[[The Observer]]'', is quoted as supporting the efficacy of the language.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globish.com&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, ''Globish the World Over'' had been translated into 12 languages including French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Chinese, Polish, Hungarian, Slovakian, Uzbek etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globish.com/ Globish official website]&lt;/ref&gt; It was a best seller in Japan.

In 2011, the Globish Foundation was formed as a non-profit organization in Australia, for the purpose of maintaining and promulgating the standards of Globish. By 2013, the Globish Foundation had 8 national affiliates and an online Globish Communications Test available 24/7.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globishfoundation.org&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Cassin]] claims that Globish is not a language of culture, but a language of service.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://conversations.e-flux.com/t/the-power-of-bilingualism-interview-with-barbara-cassin-french-philosopher-and-philologist/6252|title=The power of bilingualism: Interview with Barbara Cassin, e-flux.com|last=|first=|date=|website=e-flux.com|access-date=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert McCrum wrote the book ''Globish: How the English Language Became the World's Language'' ({{ISBN|9780393062557}}), describing Globish as an economic phenomenon, unlike "[[global English]]" whose uses are much more diverse than just business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/05/31/100531crbo_books_chotiner?currentPage=all |work=The New Yorker |author=Isaac Chotiner |title=Globish for Beginners |date=2010-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related systems==
[[Special English]] is also a controlled subset of the English language with about 1500 words, short sentences, and slower delivery than traditional English.  Special English was first used on October 19, 1959, and is still presented daily by the United States broadcasting service [[Voice of America]].

[[Specialized English]] is a controlled subset of the English language derived from Special English by [[Feba Radio]].  It also has about 1500 words, with some differences in the word list from Special English.

==Criticism ==
Critics of ''Globish'' either feel that its codifications are not sufficiently clearly rendered, or that an [[Constructed language|artificial language]] is preferable to any natural one.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}
* Although Nerrière claims that the Globish described in his book is a natural language, he has never published any statistical evidence of his observations. [[Joachim Grzega]], a German linguist, has even gone as far as to state "Obviously, it is not based on any empirical observations, neither on native-nonnative nor on nonnative-nonnative discourse."&lt;ref name="GrzegaGlobishAndBGE"&gt;[http://www1.ku-eichstaett.de/SLF/EngluVglSW/ELiX/grzega-061.pdf Globish and Basic Global English (BGE): Two Alternatives for a Rapid Acquisition of Communicative Competence in a Globalized World?] by Dr Joaquin Grzega, a German linguist.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Globish is suspected of [[cultural imperialism]], because it spreads only one language from which the subset of words is taken: this criticism is often by the speakers of other "neutral" languages, meant as languages not spoken in any nation. Clearly, derivative forms which have "English" in their titles are doubly suspect.  According to [[CIA]]'s ''[[The World Factbook]]'', native English speakers represent only 4.68% of the world population,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cilalp.org/?article43#nh2 english version] reported by the International Liaison Committee of Atheists and Freethinkers and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20061209125549/http://www.esperanto-sat.info/article662.html original French version] of the same article, with sources&lt;/ref&gt; including native and non-native speakers the total proportion of all English speakers is estimated to be 10-15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/eng|title=English|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Globish is criticized for having an ulterior economic motive.  It is a registered trademark and some marketing is done with it, since its owner did not renounce his rights to it (as for example [[L.L. Zamenhof]] did for [[Esperanto]]; on the other hand, I.A. Richards discussed why he trademarked Basic English, in order to prevent dilution and misrepresentation&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;).

'''Grand National Speech and Debate Tournament''' is the premier [[public speaking]] event of the [[National Catholic Forensic League]]. It is held annually in the [[United States]] over [[Memorial Day]] weekend. One can qualify for the tournament by performing sufficiently well in a local qualifying tournament.

== Description ==
The '''Grand National Speech and Debate Tournament''' is the premier public speaking event of the [[National Catholic Forensic League]].  The event is held annually in the United States of America over [[Memorial Day]] weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Justin |url=http://www.cbs58.com/story/31711824/35-mps-students-to-compete-in-national-speech-and-debate-tournaments |title=35 MPS Students to Compete in National Speech and Debate Tournaments |publisher=Cbs58.com |date=2016-04-13 |accessdate=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ridgeforensics.com/about-the-team.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109184223/http://www.ridgeforensics.com/about-the-team.html |archive-date=2017-01-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students can qualify for the tournament by performing sufficiently well in a local qualifying tournament. There are a number of [[National Catholic Forensic League#Events|events]] in which the participants may compete.

== Events ==

=== Declamation ===
'''Grand National Tournament in [[Declamation]]''' (also known as Oratorical Declamation or Oratorical Interpretation, commonly abbreviated to "DEC") is a public speaking event of the [[National Catholic Forensic League]]. The category is almost always open to [[High school freshman|high school freshmen]] and [[High school sophomore|sophomores]] only. It is often used as a "starter" event to get underclassmen used to the speech and debate activity in general and to prepare them for other categories such as Dramatic Performance or [[Original Oratory]].

==== Rules ====
In simplest terms, Declamation is delivering a speech that was already written and delivered by another person.  A competitor may choose any speech that has been delivered in public before. NCFL rules call for specific introductory material and a ten-minute time limit. The NCFL is the largest league in the United States that offers Declamation as a category for competition. Most local and state leagues adhere to NCFL rules or slight variations on them.

From the official NCFL [[critique]] sheet:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncfl.org/ballots/newballots/DecBallot.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830165804/http://www.ncfl.org/ballots/newballots/DecBallot.pdf |archivedate=2005-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''"The speaker should convey the message in a sincere, honest and realistic attempt to recreate the spirit of the original presentation. Although the style of delivery chosen by the speaker should be judged in light of the purpose of the speech, artificiality is to be discredited. The message should be conveyed credibly and convincingly as if the words were the speaker’s own. This event is an interpretation, not an impersonation."''

Therefore, the purpose of the category is '''not''' to give an [[Impersonator|impersonation]] of the original speaker; it is to [[Oral interpretation|interpret]] their words in an interesting and convincing manner that fits the individual competitor.  The competitor is only required to recreate the general "feel" of the original delivery, not mimic it.

:''"The introduction must name the work and author, provide necessary background ''information and establish the mood."''

:''"The speaker should be physically open to the audience and use body language which''
:''invites the audience into the world of the declaimer. The speaker should vary facial expression''
:''accentuate the natural flow of thoughts and feelings. The speaker should make eye contact with the audience. The speaker’s stance should be erect and controlled, without distracting movements.''
:''If used, movement should be motivated by transitions in thought or mood. Gestures should be visible, effectively
:''used for emphasis, and varied."''

=== The Theodore Gibson Oratorical, Declamation and Advocacy Project ===
{{Importance section}}
A joint venture of [[Miami Dade College]] and [[Miami-Dade County Public Schools|Miami Dade County Public Schools]] in [[Miami|Miami, Florida]], the Project began in 1977, and is dedicated to exposing school children to the wide breadth of writings about the Black experience throughout the Diaspora. The Project seeks to provide an opportunity for school children in grades Pre-K through high school to discover and refine public speaking skills through a comprehensive and challenging level of learning and competition.

The Project is an in-person oratory, declamation and advocacy oral presentation of persuasive or inspirational material of literary merit prepared by another person; the advocacy component being a researched problem, identified solution, and the extolled benefits or burdens of an issue in an effectively, compelling speech.  The speech is memorized and each speaker is allowed a minimum of 3 minutes to present.  Judging is based primarily on the quality of the presentation as represented by the following evaluation criteria:

==== Selection ====

** Intellectual Understanding:  Is the structure of the selection conducive to interpretation?  Does the speaker demonstrate emotional and aesthetic merit?
** Historical/Creative Significance: Does the selection represent a thoughtful review of the breadth of African-American, Afro-Caribbean, African, human/civil rights experience, or creativity.

==== Diction ====

** Vocal Variety/Contrast: Does the voice show variations in rate, speed mood?  Were transitions smooth and in keeping with the total message?
** Tempo:  Were time, pauses and hesitations used properly?  Were emphasis and subclimaxes acknowledged with associated rapid speech?  Was the pace set in keeping with the author's intent?

==== Articulation ====

** Voice:  Was their clearness, correctness, and effectiveness in choice and expression of words?
** Vocabulary:  Did speaker demonstrate a full command of the language of the piece and master complexities of vocabulary, pronunciation and context?

==== Projection Presentation ====

** Stage Presence:  Does speaker manipulate floor space appropriately to dispense the full effect of the selection?  Does speaker appear  comfortable and well adapted to the space?
** Animation:  Is the presentation performed  appropriately to the tone of the selection?  Is animation appropriate or overdramatized?
** Bodily Actions:  Do gestures, stance and facial expression support and emphasize the verbal content of the speech, or do they detract and call forth undue attention?

==== Final Evaluation ====

** Overall Effectiveness:  Overall presentation of piece, effectiveness, articulation and stage presence.
The Project's namesake, the Reverend Canon Theodore R. Gibson, a Miami [[city commissioner]] known for his oration and vision, made the remark that is the Project's theme:  "Help the Children to Communicate...That is the Key".

=== The Original Oratory Controversy ===
The use of former [[Original Oratory]] speeches in Declamation has become quite widespread in recent years. Some see this practice as unfair or undermining the category's original purpose, as these speeches were originally written for the purpose of winning in forensic competition, and not necessarily conveying an important message. At the beginning of 2003–2004 season, the NCFL enacted a ban on all former high school competitive oratories, effective as of the 2005 Grand National Tournament. However, at the beginning of the 2004–2005 season, the restriction was removed, and thus, the ban never truly came into effect. State and local leagues may choose to ban or allow material as they wish.

In [[ISO/IEC 646]] (commonly known as [[ASCII]]) and related standards including [[ISO 8859]] and [[Unicode]], a '''graphic character''' is any character intended to be written, printed, or otherwise displayed in a form that can be read by humans. In other words, it is any [[character encoding|encoded character]] that is associated with one or more [[glyph]]s.

==ISO/IEC 646==
In ISO 646, graphic characters are contained in rows 2 through 7 of the [[code]] table. However, two of the characters in these rows, namely the [[space character]] SP at row 2 column 0 and the [[delete character]]&amp;nbsp;DEL (also called the rubout character) at row 7 column 15, require special mention.

The space is considered to be ''both'' a graphic character and a control character in ISO 646. It can have a visible form, and also a control function (moving the print head).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=L.R. Henderson|author2=A.M. Mumford|title=The Computer Graphics Metafile: Butterworth Series in Computer Graphics Standards|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0KeBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102|date=20 May 2014|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-1-4831-4484-9|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The delete character is strictly a control character, not a graphic character. This is true not only in ISO 646, but also in all related{{clarification needed|date=February 2012}} standards including Unicode. However, many modern character sets deviate from ISO 646, and as a result a graphic character might{{where|date=February 2012}} occupy the position originally reserved for the delete character.

==Unicode==
In Unicode, Graphic characters are those with [[Unicode character properties#General Category|General Category]] Letter, Mark, Number, Punctuation, Symbol or Zs=space. Other code points (General categories Control, Zl=line separator, Zp=paragraph separator) are Format, Control, Private Use, Surrogate, Noncharacter or Reserved (unassigned).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.2.0/ch02.pdf#G25564 Chapter 2, table 2.3&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Spacing character|Non-spacing character}}Spacing and non-spacing characters ==
Most graphic characters are '''spacing characters''', which means that each instance of a spacing character has to occupy some [[area]] in a graphic representation. For a [[teletype]] or a [[typewriter]] this implies moving of the carriage after typing of a character. In the context of [[text mode]] display, each spacing character occupies one rectangular character box of equal sizes. Or maybe two adjacent ones, for non-alphabetic [[CJK characters|characters of East Asian languages]]. If a text is [[font rendering|rendered]] using [[proportional font]]s, widths of character boxes are not equal, but are [[positive number|positive]].

There exists also ''non-spacing'' graphic characters. Most of [[non-spacing character]]s are ''[[wikt:modifier|modifiers]]'', also called [[combining character]]s in Unicode, such as [[diacritic]]al marks. Although non-spacing graphic characters are uncommon in traditional [[code page]]s, there are many such in Unicode. A combining character has its distinct glyph, but it applies to a character box of another character, a spacing one. In some historical systems such as [[line printer]]s this was implemented as [[overstrike]].

Note that not all modifiers are non-spacing&amp;nbsp;– there exists [[Spacing Modifier Letters]] Unicode block.

'''Henry Lion Oldie''' or '''H. L. Oldie''' ({{lang-ru|Генри Лайон Олди, Г. Л. Олди}}) is the [[pen name]] of Ukrainian science-fantasy fiction writers '''Dmitry Gromov''' and '''Oleg Ladyzhensky'''. Both authors reside in [[Kharkiv]], Ukraine, and write in [[Russian language|Russian]]. At [[Eurocon]] 2006 in [[Kyiv]], the [[European Science Fiction Society]] named them Europe's best writers of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esfs.info/esfs-awards-2000.html#2006&lt;/ref&gt; Oldie collaborated with other [[Russian language in Ukraine|Russophone Ukrainian]] writers, such as [[Andrey Valentinov]], [[Marina and Sergey Dyachenko]].

The "H. L. Oldie" pen name was invented as a merger of their names, Oleg and Dmitry, respectively, and the initials are derived from their family names in Cyrillic (Громов and Ладыженский). They eventually decided that H. L. should stay for "Henry Lion". Choice of a "western" pseudonym was common during the early post-Soviet era, when Russian and Ukrainian publishers and readers preferred foreign science fiction and fantasy to Russian.

==Dmitry Gromov bio==
'''Dmitry Yevgenyevich Gromov''' ({{lang-uk|Дмитро Євгенович Громов}}, {{lang-ru|Дмитрий Евгеньевич Громов}}) was born March 30, 1963, in [[Simferopol]], Crimea, Soviet Union. His family moved to Kharkiv when he was 11. There he graduated from [[Kharkiv Polytechnical Institute]] in 1986 and worked as chemistry engineer. Married, he has a son (born 1989). Since 1991 he has been pursuing a full-time writer career.

==Oleg Ladyzhensky bio==
'''Oleg Semenovych Ladyzhensky''' ({{lang-uk|Олег Семенович Ладиженський}}, {{lang-ru|Олег Семёнович Ладыженский}}) was born March 23, 1963, in Kharkiv, Soviet Ukraine. He graduated from Kharkiv institute of culture in 1984. After that he became a theatre director. It is Ladyzhensky who's responsible for H. L. Oldie's poetry, he publishes his verse separately from Oldie books as well, under his real name.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2839">A '''leading name''' (German ''Leitname'', plural ''Leitnamen'') is a [[given name]] that is used repeatedly over several generations in a [[lineage (anthropology)|lineage]] or broader [[kin group]]. Usually the entire name is used again and again, but sometimes a [[Root (linguistics)|root]] of a name may be reused in several different forms.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|p=81}}{{sfn|Bouchard|1981|pp=504–08}}

A leading name could function as a sort of "moral property", where only those of the lineage had a right to use it and it was expected that nobody else would do so. Both the [[Merovingian]] and [[Carolingian]] dynasties of Frankish kings drew from a repertoire of names that were rarely or never used by other families.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|p=81}}

Names could be passed on from the paternal or maternal side, often depending on which ancestors were more prominent.{{sfn|Wilson|1998|p=83}}

The idea of tracing lineages and proposing genealogies based on analysis of leading names is old. In 1043, when Abbot [[Poppo of Stavelot]] opposed the marriage of the [[Emperor Henry III]] to [[Agnes of Poitou]] on grounds of consanguinity, he traced the ancestry of Henry's mother: "the descent of the genealogy is achieved through Mathildas and Gerbergas, in such a way that Mathilda, the daughter of Gerberga (with the same name as her grandmother) called her daughter by her mother's name, and she left her own name as an inheritance to her granddaughter."{{sfn|Wilson|1998|p=84}}
&lt;!--
Count Teutbert came to the abbot to ask heaven for a son. The abbot promised that the count would have a son but claimed him for the Church, imposing on the chid in advance the monastic name of Benedict. When the child was born, therefore, the count took him secretly to Gorze where the abbot baptized and named him. At the end of the mother's confinement, she reminded the count, her husband, that it was time to christen the child and "to give him a name of his ancestors". When the count confessed that he had already had this done and that the child had been named Benedict on the orders of the abbot, she was upset and lamented "the great insult done thereby to our kindred".{{sfn|Wilson|1998|pp=81–82}}

'''Lehmer's conjecture''', also known as the '''Lehmer's Mahler measure problem,''' is a problem in [[number theory]] raised by [[Derrick Henry Lehmer]].&lt;ref name=lmr&gt;{{cite journal | zbl=0007.19904 | last=Lehmer | first=D.H. | authorlink=Derrick Henry Lehmer | title=Factorization of certain cyclotomic functions | journal=Ann. Math. |series=2 | volume=34 | pages=461–479 | year=1933 | issn=0003-486X | doi=10.2307/1968172}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The conjecture asserts that there is an absolute constant &lt;math&gt;\mu&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; such that every [[polynomial]] with integer coefficients &lt;math&gt;P(x)\in\mathbb{Z}[x]&lt;/math&gt; satisfies one of the following properties:

* The [[Mahler measure]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}(P(x))&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; is greater than or equal to &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; is an integral multiple of a product of cyclotomic polynomials or the monomial &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, in which case &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}(P(x))=1&lt;/math&gt;. (Equivalently, every complex root of &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a root of unity or zero.)

There are a number of definitions of the Mahler measure, one of which is to factor &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;P(x)=a_0 (x-\alpha_1)(x-\alpha_2)\cdots(x-\alpha_D),&lt;/math&gt;

and then set

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}(P(x)) = |a_0| \prod_{i=1}^{D} \max(1,|\alpha_i|).&lt;/math&gt;

The smallest known Mahler measure (greater than 1) is for "Lehmer's polynomial"

:&lt;math&gt;P(x)= x^{10}+x^9-x^7-x^6-x^5-x^4-x^3+x+1 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

for which the Mahler measure is the [[Salem number]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Borwein | first=Peter | authorlink=Peter Borwein | title=Computational Excursions in Analysis and Number Theory | series=CMS Books in Mathematics | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=2002 | isbn=0-387-95444-9 | zbl=1020.12001 | page=16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}(P(x))=1.176280818\dots \ .&lt;/math&gt;

It is widely believed that this example represents the true minimal value: that is, &lt;math&gt;\mu=1.176280818\dots&lt;/math&gt; in Lehmer's conjecture.&lt;ref name=S234&gt;Smyth (2008) p.324&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EPSW30&gt;{{cite book | last1=Everest | first1=Graham | last2=van der Poorten | first2=Alf | author2-link=Alfred van der Poorten | last3=Shparlinski | first3=Igor | last4=Ward | first4=Thomas | title=Recurrence sequences | series=Mathematical Surveys and Monographs | volume=104 | location=[[Providence, RI]] | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | year=2003 | isbn=0-8218-3387-1 | zbl=1033.11006 | page=30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivation ==
Consider Mahler measure for one variable and [[Jensen's formula]] shows that if &lt;math&gt;P(x)=a_0 (x-\alpha_1)(x-\alpha_2)\cdots(x-\alpha_D)&lt;/math&gt; then  
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}(P(x)) = |a_0| \prod_{i=1}^{D} \max(1,|\alpha_i|).&lt;/math&gt;
In this paragraph denote　&lt;math&gt;m(P)=\log(\mathcal{M}(P(x))&lt;/math&gt; , which is also called [[Mahler measure]].

If &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; has integer coefficients, this shows that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}(P)&lt;/math&gt; is an [[algebraic number]] so &lt;math&gt;m(P)&lt;/math&gt; is the logarithm of an algebraic integer. It also shows that &lt;math&gt;m(P)\ge0&lt;/math&gt; and that if &lt;math&gt;m(P)=0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a product of [[cyclotomic polynomial]]s i.e. monic polynomials whose all roots are roots of unity, or a monomial polynomial of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; i.e. a power &lt;math&gt;x^n&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; .

Lehmer noticed&lt;ref name=lmr /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Boyd (1981). "Speculations concerning the range of Mahler's measure" Canad. Math. Bull. Vol. 24(4)&lt;/ref&gt; that &lt;math&gt;m(P)=0&lt;/math&gt; is an important value in the study of the integer sequences &lt;math&gt;\Delta_n=\text{Res}(P(x), x^n-1)=\prod^D_{i=1}(\alpha_i^n-1)&lt;/math&gt; for monic &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; . If &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; does not vanish on the circle then &lt;math&gt;\lim|\Delta_n|^{1/n}=\mathcal{M}(P)&lt;/math&gt; and this statement might be true even if  &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; does vanish on the circle. By this he was led to ask
:whether there is a constant &lt;math&gt;c&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;m(P)&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; provided &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is not cyclotomic?,
or
:given &lt;math&gt;c&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, are there &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; with integer coefficients for which &lt;math&gt; 0&lt;m(P)&lt;c &lt;/math&gt;?
Some positive answers have been provided as follows, but Lehmer's conjecture is not yet completely proved and is still a question of much interest.

==Partial results==

Let &lt;math&gt;P(x)\in\mathbb{Z}[x]&lt;/math&gt; be an irreducible monic polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;.

Blanksby and [[Hugh Montgomery (mathematician)|Montgomery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=P. E. | last1=Blanksby | first2=H. L. | last2=Montgomery | author2-link=Hugh Montgomery (mathematician) | title=Algebraic integers near the unit circle | journal=Acta Arith. | volume=18 | year=1971 | pages=355–369 | zbl=0221.12003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Stewart&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=C.

:&lt;math&gt;\log\mathcal{M}(P(x))\ge \frac{C}{D\log D}. &lt;/math&gt;

Dobrowolski &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=E. | last=Dobrowolski | title=On a question of Lehmer and the number of irreducible factors of a polynomial | journal=Acta Arith. | volume=34 | year=1979 | pages=391–401 }}&lt;/ref&gt; improved this to

:&lt;math&gt;\log\mathcal{M}(P(x))\ge C\left(\frac{\log\log D}{\log D}\right)^3.&lt;/math&gt;

Dobrowolski obtained the value ''C'' ≥ 1/1200 and asymptotically C &gt; 1-ε for all sufficiently large ''D''.  Voutier in 1996 obtained ''C'' ≥ 1/4 for ''D'' ≥ 2.&lt;ref&gt;P. Voutier, [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.3110v1.pdf An effective lower bound for the height of algebraic numbers], Acta Arith. 74 (1996), 81–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elliptic analogues==

Let &lt;math&gt;E/K&lt;/math&gt; be an [[elliptic curve]] defined over a number field &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;\hat{h}_E:E(\bar{K})\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be the [[canonical height]] function. The canonical height is the analogue for elliptic curves of the function &lt;math&gt;(\deg P)^{-1}\log\mathcal{M}(P(x))&lt;/math&gt;. It has the property that &lt;math&gt;\hat{h}_E(Q)=0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is a [[torsion point]] in &lt;math&gt;E(\bar{K})&lt;/math&gt;. The '''elliptic Lehmer conjecture''' asserts that there is a constant &lt;math&gt;C(E/K)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{h}_E(Q) \ge \frac{C(E/K)}{D}&lt;/math&gt; for all non-torsion points &lt;math&gt;Q\in E(\bar{K})&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;D=[K(Q):K]&lt;/math&gt;. If the elliptic curve ''E'' has [[complex multiplication]], then the analogue of Dobrowolski's result holds:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{h}_E(Q) \ge  \frac{C(E/K)}{D} \left(\frac{\log\log D}{\log D}\right)^3 ,&lt;/math&gt;

due to Laurent.&lt;ref name=S327&gt;Smyth (2008) p.327&lt;/ref&gt; For arbitrary elliptic curves, the best known result is

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{h}_E(Q) \ge  \frac{C(E/K)}{D^3(\log D)^2},&lt;/math&gt;

due to [[David Masser|Masser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | zbl=0723.14026 | last=Masser | first=D.W. | authorlink=David Masser | title=Counting points of small height on elliptic curves | journal=Bull. Soc. Math. Fr. | volume=117 | number=2 | pages=247–265 | year=1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For elliptic curves with non-integral [[j-invariant]], this has been improved to

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{h}_E(Q) \ge  \frac{C(E/K)}{D^2(\log D)^2},&lt;/math&gt;

by Hindry and [[Joseph H. Silverman|Silverman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | zbl=0741.14013 | last1=Hindry | first1=Marc | last2=Silverman | first2=Joseph H. | author2-link=Joseph_H._Silverman | chapter=On Lehmer's conjecture for elliptic curves | title=Sémin.

==Restricted results==
Stronger results are known for restricted classes of polynomials or algebraic numbers.

If ''P''(''x'') is not reciprocal then

:&lt;math&gt;M(P) \ge M(x^3 -x - 1) \approx 1.3247 &lt;/math&gt;

and this is clearly best possible.&lt;ref name=S328&gt;Smyth (2008) p.328&lt;/ref&gt;  If further all the coefficients of ''P'' are odd then&lt;ref name=S329/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M(P) \ge M(x^2 -x - 1) \approx 1.618 . &lt;/math&gt;

For any algebraic number ''α'', let &lt;math&gt;M(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; be the Mahler measure of the minimal polynomial &lt;math&gt;P_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of ''α''. If the field '''Q'''(''α'') is a [[Galois extension]] of '''Q''', then Lehmer's conjecture holds for &lt;math&gt;P_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=S329&gt;Smyth (2008) p.329&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Lexalytics spun into existence in January 2003 out of a content management startup called Lightspeed.&lt;ref name="Huang"&gt;{{cite web

Jeff Catlin, a Lightspeed General Manager, and Mike Marshall, a Lighstpeed Principle Engineer, convinced investors to give them the East Coast company so as to avoid shutdown costs.&lt;ref name="Roush"&gt;{{cite web

Catlin took on the role of Chief Executive Officer with Marshall working as Chief Technology Officer.&lt;ref name="Roush"/&gt;  Lexalytics opted to not accept venture cash.  Instead, the company initially shared sales and marketing expenses with U.K. based document management company Infonic.  The partner companies soon formed a joint venture in July 2008, which was later dissolved. Since then, Lexalytics has worked with many other companies, like [[Bottlenose (company)|Bottlenose]],&lt;ref name="Dataversity"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3800">'''Liam Ó Briain''' (16 September 1888 &amp;ndash; 12 August 1974) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] language expert and political activist.

Born in [[North Wall, Dublin]] as '''William O'Brien''', he took an interest in the [[Irish language]] from an early age and while still at the [[O'Connell School]] started using the Irish version of his name.  He also attended meetings of the [[Gaelic League]], then attended [[University College Dublin]] (UCD) on a scholarship, where he studied French, English and Irish, receiving a BA and an MA.&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;Paul Rouse, "Ó Briain, Liam", ''Dictionary of Irish Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;

UCD decided to start awarding one annual scholarship for overseas travel in 1911, and Ó Briain won the first one, using it to visit Germany and study under [[Kuno Meyer]] and [[Rudolf Thurneysen]].  After three years, he returned home, where he rejoined the Gaelic League and began teaching French at UCD.  He also joined the [[Irish Volunteers]] then, the following year, [[Seán T. O'Kelly]] convinced him to join the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]].&lt;ref name="biography" /&gt;

During the [[Easter Rising]], Ó Briain saw action with the [[Irish Citizen Army]].&lt;ref name="biography" /&gt;  He came into conflict with his commander, [[Michael Mallin]], as he wanted to pursue a strategy without the Dublin brigade being "cooped up in the city".  However, Mallin overruled him and insisted they should focus on taking [[Dublin Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Townshend, "Easter 1916: The Irish Rebellion", p.93&lt;/ref&gt;  He spent two months in prison and six at an internment camp before being released to discover that he had been fired from his job, but quickly obtained a professorship in Romance languages at [[University College Galway]] (UCG).&lt;ref name="biography" /&gt;

Around this time, Ó Briain joined [[Sinn Féin]], and he stood unsuccessfully for the party in [[Mid Armagh (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Armagh]] at the [[Irish general election, 1918]], taking 5,689 votes.  His campaign led, indirectly, to another prison sentence.  On release, he was appointed as a judge in the then-illegal republican court system, and visited both France and Italy to try to source weapons for the [[Irish Republican Army]].  In November 1920, he was again arrested and interned for just over a year, thereby missing the conclusion of the [[Irish War of Independence]].  By the time he was released, the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] had been signed; he supported this, and took no further part in militant activity.&lt;ref name="biography" /&gt;

In the newly independent Ireland, Ó Briain remained a professor at Galway.  He also stood in the [[Irish Seanad election, 1925]], although he was not successful.  He was the founding secretary of the [[Taibhdhearc na Gaillimhe]] theatre, also acting in many of its productions, and spent much time translating works from English and the Romance languages into Irish.  He stood to become president of UCG in 1945, but was not elected, and in the 1940s and 1950s was best known for his many appearances on television and radio.&lt;ref name="biography" /&gt;

On 1 September 1921 he married Helen Lawlor. The couple's only child was the journalist [[Eibhlín Ní Bhriain]].&lt;ref name="biography" /&gt;

'''Macro-Andean''' is a speculative proposal by [[Terrence Kaufman|Kaufman]] (2007) linking languages of the northern Andes. 

Kaufman (1990) found lexical support for proposals linking the [[Macro-Jibaro languages|Jivaro–Cahuapanan]] families as suggested by Swadesh and others. By 2007 he had tentatively added [[Saparo–Yawan languages|Saparo–Yawan]], which is itself provisional, and [[Bora–Witoto languages|Bora–Witoto]].

==Languages==
Kaufman (2007) posits the following membership. The unclassified languages [[Urarina language|Urarina]], [[Puelche language|Puelche]], [[Huaorani language|Sabela]], [[Taushiro language|Taushiro]], [[Omurano language|Omurano]] are included in the Kawapanan and Yawan branches.

'''Malawi Lomwe''', known as ''Elhomwe'', is a dialect of the [[Lomwe language]] spoken in southeastern [[Malawi]].

==Background==
The Lomwe are one of the four largest ethnic groups living in Malawi and have history of migration across the Mozambique–Malawi border. Many Lomwe moved into Malawi, where they mixed with the [[Chewa people|Chewa]], in the 1930s due to tribal wars in Mozambique. The Elhomwe language spoken in Malawi is to a large extent a Mihavane dialect while in some districts like Thyolo there are traces of Kokholha dialect.

The Malawian government has taken a step in preserving the language by broadcasting news in Elhomwe language on its MBC radio 1. The establishment of the cultural organisation Mulhako Wa Alhomwe by the late President of Malawi, [[Bingu wa Mutharika]], on 25 October, 2008, was another milestone. The Mulhako Wa Alhomwe has its headquarters at Chonde in [[Mulanje District]]. It was set up to preserve Lhomwe customs, beliefs and language. It has a library and a school of Elhomwe.

Although the Elhomwe dialect spoken in [[Malawi]] is not mutually intelligible with other dialects of Lomwe spoken in Mozambique it shares many similarities including vocabulary. For instance one could note the similarities in the following word forms: ''otchuna'' (Emakhuwa), ''onthuna'' (Lmeetto), and ''ohuna'' (Elhomwe) meaning "to want". Similarly the word for "women" is ''anamwaani'' (Emakhuwa and Elhomwe), ''anumwane'' (Lmeetto).{{cn|date=February 2013}}

'''Kod Tangan Bahasa Malaysia''' ('''KTBM'''), or '''Manually Coded Malay''', is the only form of sign language recognized by the government in [[Malaysia]] as the language of communication for the Deaf. It is not itself a language, but a [[manually coded language]], a signed form of oral [[Malay language|Malay]]. It is adapted from [[American Sign Language]] (or perhaps [[Manually Coded English]]), with the addition of some local signs, and grammatical signs representing affixation of nouns and verbs as used in Malay. It is used in Deaf schools for the purpose of teaching the Malay language.

'''Michael Madhusudan Dutt,''' or '''Michael Madhusudan Dutta''' ({{lang-bn|মাইকেল মধুসূদন দত্ত}} ({{audio|Madhusudan.ogg|''Maikel Modhushudôn Dôtto''}}); 25 January 1824&amp;nbsp;– 29 June 1873) was a popular 19th-century [[Bengali language|Bengali]] poet and dramatist. He was a pioneer of Bengali drama.&lt;ref name="EBuckland1999"&gt;{{cite book |author=Charles E. Buckland |date=1999 |title=Dictionary of Indian Biography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8kH3F664k_gC&amp;pg=PA128 |publisher=Cosmo Publication |pages=128– |isbn=978-81-7020-897-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; His famous work ''[[Meghnad Bodh Kavya]]'', is a tragic [[Epic poetry|epic]]. It consists of nine [[canto]]s and is exceptional in Bengali literature both in terms of style and content. He also wrote poems about the sorrows and afflictions of love as spoken by women.

Dutta is widely considered to be one of the greatest poets in [[Bengali literature]] and the father of the Bengali [[sonnet]]. He pioneered what came to be called A''mitrakshar chhanda'' ([[blank verse]]). Although his first love remained poetry, Dutt showed prodigious skill as a playwright. He was the first to write Bengali plays in the English style, segregating the play into acts and scenes. He was also the pioneer of the first satirical plays in Bengali – ''Buro Shaliker Ghare Rnow'' (Bengali - বুড়ো শালিকের ঘাড়ে রো) and ''Ekei Ki Boley Sabyota'' (Bengali - একেই কি বলে সভ্যতা?)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.calcuttaweb.com/about/people-2/literature/michael-madhusudan-dutta/ |title=Michael Madhusudan Dutta |website=Calcuttaweb}}{{self-published source|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
He was born in Sagordari, a village in [[Keshabpur Upazila]], [[Jessore District]] of [[Bengal|Undivided Bengal]] (now [[Bangladesh]]). His father was Rajnarayan Dutt, a pleader in the [[Sadr Diwani Adalat|Sudder court]],&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and his mother was Jahnabi Devi.He was an exceptionally talented student. Since his childhood, Dutt was recognised by his teachers and professors as being a precocious child with a gift of literary expression. He was very imaginative. Early exposure to English education and European literature at home and in [[Kolkata]] inspired him to emulate the English in taste, manners and intellect. An early influence was his teacher at [[Hindu College, Calcutta]], [[David Lester Richardson]]. Richardson was a poet and inspired in Dutt a love of English poetry, particularly [[Lord Byron|Byron]].

Dutt began writing English poetry aged around 17 years, sending his works to publications in England, including ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' and ''[[Bentley's Miscellany]]''. They were, however, never published.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; It was also the time he began correspondence with his friend, [[Gour Das Bysack]], which today form the bulk of the source on his life.

As a young student, Dutt was influenced by the thoughts and actions of the [[Young Bengal]] - a movement by a group of illustrious former students of the [[Hindu College, Calcutta|Hindu College]] (now [[Presidency University, Kolkata|Presidency College]]) in [[Calcutta]] (now Kolkata) against the atrocities, blind beliefs and customs they held as illogical, prevalent in the Hindu society of 19th century Bengal. Dutta, a student of [[Hindu College, Kolkata|Hindu College]] himself, aspired to be an English poet and longed to travel to England to gain fame. When his father, concerned by these trends, arranged his marriage, he rebelled. One aspect of his rebellion involved conversion to Christianity.

===In his own words===
&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
Where man in all his truest glory lives,
And nature's face is exquisitely sweet;
For those fair climes I heave impatient sigh,
There let me live and there let me die.&lt;ref name="Chakrabarty2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dipesh Chakrabarty|title=Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial Thought and Historical Difference (New Edition)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqDa4tGENvYC&amp;pg=PA33|accessdate=9 October 2012|date=15 February 2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13001-9|pages=33–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Madhusudan embraced Christianity&lt;ref name=bpedia&gt;{{cite book |last=Bhowmik |first=Dulal |year=2012 |chapter=Dutt, Michael Madhusudan |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Dutt,_Michael_Madhusudan |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Old Mission Church in spite of the objections of his parents and relatives on 9 February 1843. He did not take the name Michael until his marriage in 1848.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

He describes the day as:
&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
Long sunk in superstition's night,
By Sin and Satan driven,
I saw not, cared not for the light
That leads the blind to Heaven.
But now, at length thy grace, O Lord!
Birds all around me shine;
I drink thy sweet, thy precious word,
I kneel before thy shrine!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Mitra |editor1-first=Zinia |date=2012 |title=Indian Poetry in English: Critical Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5YmPaDMuHYYC&amp;pg=PA32 |publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd |page=32 |isbn=8120345711}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

He had to leave [[Hindu College, Calcutta|Hindu College]] on account of being a convert. In 1844, he resumed his education at [[Bishop’s College, Calcutta|Bishop's College]], where he stayed for three years.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?isbn=0195167996|title=The Slaying of Meghanada: A Ramayana from Colonial Bengal|last=Dutt|first=Michael Madhusudhan|last2=Seely|first2=Clinton B.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2004|isbn=9780195167993|location=New York City|pages=16, 22–23|via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1847, he moved to [[Madras]] (Chennai) due to severe family tensions and economic hardship, having been disinherited by his father.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While in Madras, he stayed in the [[George Town, Chennai|Black Town]] neighbourhood,&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; and began working as an "usher" at the Madras Male Orphan Asylum. Four years later, in 1851, he became a Second Tutor in the Madras University High School.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In addition, he edited and assisted in editing the periodicals, ''Madras Circulator and General Chronicle, Athenaeum, [[Spectator (1828)|Spectator]]'' and ''Hindoo Chronicle.''&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

==Literary life==

=== Early works (1849-1855)&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ===
Dutt was greatly influenced by the works of [[William Wordsworth]] and [[John Milton]]. Dutt was a spirited [[bohemian]] and [[Romanticism|Romantic]].

During his stay in Madras, he published such works as ''King Porus'', ''The Captive Ladie'' (1849) - centered around [[Prithviraj Chauhan|King Prithviraj]]'s elopement with the princess of [[Kannauj|Kannuaj]]- and ''Visions of the Past.'' The Hurkaru, a prominent periodical at the time gave the self-published ''The Captive Ladie'' unfavourable reviews, and was in Madhusudan's own words, "''was somewhat severe''". [[John Elliot Drinkwater Bethune]], the then President of the Council of Education, was full of praise for the octosyllabic in his letter to [[Gour Das Bysack|Bysack]], and advised Dutt to "employ the taste and talents, which he has cultivated by the study of English, in improving the standard, and adding to the stock of the poetry of his own language."

Under the [[pseudonym]], Timothy Penpoem, he published his poems in the periodicals he edited.

=== Calcutta Years (1858-1862)&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ===
The period during which he worked as a head clerk and later as the Chief Interpreter in the court, marked his transition to writing in his native Bengali, following the advice of [[John Elliot Drinkwater Bethune|Bethune]] and [[Gour Das Bysack|Bysack]]. He wrote 5 plays:  ''Sermista'' (1859)'', Padmavati'' (1859)'', Ekei Ki Boley Sabyata'' (1860), ''Krishna Kumari'' (1860) ''and Buro Shaliker Ghare Ron'' (1860). Then followed the narrative poems: ''Tilottama Sambhava Kavya'' (1861), ''Meghnad Badh Kavya'' (1861), ''Brajagana Kavya'' (1861) and ''Veerangana Kavya'' (1861). He also translated three plays from Bangla to English, including his own ''Sermista.''

''[[Meghnad Badh Kavya]], The Slaying of Meghnad,'' the story of the final fight and demise of [[Meghnad Indrajit|Meghnad]], the eldest son of [[Ravana]], is unanimously hailed as his magnum opus, although his journey to publication and recognition was far from smooth. However, with its publication, he distinguished himself as a serious composer of an entirely new genre of heroic poetry, that was [[Homeric]] and [[Dante]]sque in technique and style, and yet so fundamentally native in theme. To cite the poet himself: "''I awoke one morning and found myself famous''."  Nevertheless, it took a few years for this epic to win recognition all over the country.

=== Final years (1866-1873)&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ===
A volume of his Bangla sonnets was published in 1866. His final play, ''Maya Kannan'', was written in 1872. ''The Slaying of Hector'', his prose version of the ''[[Iliad]]'' remains incomplete.

=== Linguistic abilities ===
Madhusudan was a gifted [[linguistics|linguist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Ray |editor-first=Mohit K. |date=2007 |title=The Atlantic Companion to Literature in English |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A_YatfLrgnMC&amp;pg=PA154 |publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist |pages=154– |isbn=978-81-269-0832-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Polyglot (person)|polyglot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ghose |first=Subhas Chandra |date=1996 |title=Socio-Political Dynamics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNYL20IU20sC&amp;pg=PA178 |publisher=Northern Book Centre |page=178 |isbn=978-81-7211-070-3}}

===Work with the sonnet===
He dedicated his first [[sonnet]] to his friend [[Rajnarayan Basu]], which he accompanied with a letter: "What say you to this, my good friend? In my humble opinion, if cultivated by men of genius, our sonnet in time would rival the Italian."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sri Aurobindo Ashram|title=Mother India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zy0PAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=9 October 2012|date=February 1961|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most famous sonnet is ''Kapatakkha River''.
&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
Always, o river, you peep in my mind.
Always I think you in this loneliness.
Always I soothe my ears with the murmur
Of your waters in illusion, the way
Men hear songs of illusion in a dream.
Many a river I have seen on earth;
But which can quench my thirst the way you do?
You’re the flow of milk in my homeland’s breasts.
Will I meet you ever? As long as you
Go to kinglike ocean to pay the tax
Of water, I beg to you, sing my name
Into the ears of people of Bengal,
Sing his name, o dear, who in this far land
Sings your name in all his songs for Bengal.
&lt;/poem&gt;

When Dutt later stayed in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], the sixth centenary of the Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri]] was being celebrated all over Europe. He composed a poem in honour of the poet, translated it into French and Italian, and sent it to the king of Italy. [[Victor Emmanuel II]], then monarch, liked the poem and wrote to Dutt, saying, "It will be a ring which will connect the Orient with the Occident."&lt;ref name="Yajnik1933"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ramanial Kanaiyaial Yajnik|title=The Indian Theatre: Its Origins and Its Later Developments Under European Influence, with Special Reference to Western India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8r5ycUQEl-wC&amp;pg=PA219|accessdate=9 October 2012|year=1933|publisher=Ardent Media|pages=219–|id=GGKEY:WYN7QH8HYJB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work in blank verse===
''Sharmistha'' (spelt as ''Sermista'' in English) was Dutt's first attempt at blank verse in Bengali literature. [[Kaliprasanna Singha]] organised a felicitation ceremony to Madhusudan to mark the introduction of blank verse in Bengali poetry.

Praising Dutt's blank verse, Sir [[Ashutosh Mukherjee]], observed: "As long as the Bengali race and Bengali literature would exist, the sweet lyre of Madhusudan would never cease playing."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mother India: Monthly Review of Culture|last = |first = |publisher = |year = 1961|isbn = |location = |pages = 57|url = https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=Zy0PAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Ordinarily,+reading+of+poetry+causes+a+soporific+effect,+but+the+intoxicating+vigour+of+Madhusudan+poems+makes+even+a+sick+man+sit+up+on+his+bed&amp;dq=Ordinarily,+reading+of+poetry+causes+a+soporific+effect,+but+the+intoxicating+vigour+of+Madhusudan+poems+makes+even+a+sick+man+sit+up+on+his+bed&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iuUnVbe_F5W1uQTkt4CQDw&amp;redir_esc=y|volume = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added: "Ordinarily, reading of poetry causes a soporific effect, but the intoxicating vigour of Madhusudan's poems makes even a sick man sit up on his bed."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In his ''[[The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian]],'' [[Nirad C. Chaudhuri]] has remarked that during his childhood days in Kishoreganj, a common standard for testing guests' erudition in the Bengali language during family gatherings was to require them to recite the poetry of Dutt, without an accent.[[File:"Rue Des Chantiers" Street.jpg|thumb|The street where M Dutt used to live in Versailles, France]]

== Barrister-at-Law ==

[[Image:Residence_of_Micheal_Madhusudhan_Dutt_in_Khidirpur.JPG|right|thumb|Dutt 's residence in Khidirpur, [[Kolkata]], [[India]]]]
Dutt went to England in 1862 to become a [[Barrister-at-Law]], and enrolled at the [[Gray's Inn]].&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

On the eve of his departure to England:&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
Forget me not, O Mother,
Should I fail to return
To thy hallowed bosom.
Make not the lotus of thy memory
Void of its nectar Madhu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sri Aurobindo Ashram|title=Mother India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zy0PAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=9 October 2012|date=February 1961|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(Translated from the original Bengali by the poet.)
&lt;/poem&gt;

His family joined him in 1863, and thereafter they shifted to the much cheaper [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], due to the miserable state of their finances. Funds were not arriving from India according to his plans. He was only able to relocate to England in 1865 and study for the bar due to the munificent generosity of [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]]. For this, Dutt was to regard Vidyasagar as ''Dayar Sagar'' (meaning ''the ocean of kindness'') for as long as he lived. He was admitted to the High Court in Calcutta on his return in February 1867.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?isbn=940074661X|title=Making India: Colonialism, National Culture, and the Afterlife of Indian English Authority|last=Paranjape|first=Makarand R.|publisher=[[Springer Publishing|Springer]]|year=2012|isbn=9789400746602|location=|pages=76–78|via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family followed him in 1869.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

His stay in England had left him disillusioned with European culture. He wrote to his friend [[Gour Das Bysack|Bysack]] from France: {{quote|If there be any one among us anxious to leave a name behind him, and not pass away into oblivion like a brute, let him devote himself to his mother-tongue. That is his legitimate sphere his proper element.&lt;ref name="Poddāra1970"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arabinda Poddāra|title=Renaissance in Bengal: quests and confrontations, 1800–1860|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Msd4rdQoHE8C|accessdate=23 July 2012|year=1970|publisher=Indian Institute of Advanced Study|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Marriage and family==
Dutt had refused to enter into an [[arranged marriage]] which his father had decided for him. He had no respect for that tradition and wanted to break free from the confines of [[caste]]-based [[endogamous]] marriage. His knowledge of the European tradition convinced him of the superiority of marriages made by mutual consent (or [[love marriage]]s).

He was the first Indian to marry a European or Anglo-Indian woman.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moreno|first=H. W.

They had four children together.  He wrote to [[Gour Das Bysack|Bysack]] in December 1855:{{quote|Yes, dearest Gour, I have a fine English Wife and four children.&lt;ref name="MurshidMajumdar2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ghulam Murshid|author2=Gopa Majumdar|title=Lured by hope: a biography of Michael Madhusudan Dutt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7KZjAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=9 October 2012|date=30 October 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-565362-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dutt returned from Madras to Calcutta in February 1856, after his father's death (in 1855), abandoning his wife and four children in Madras. No records of his divorce from Rebecca or remarriage have been found.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; In 1858, he was joined there by a 22 year old of French extraction,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Emelia Henrietta Sophie White, the daughter of his colleague at the Madras Male Orphan Asylum.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They had two sons, Frederick Michael Milton (23 July 1861 - 11 June 1875)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?isbn=0821443585|title=Indian Angles: English Verse in Colonial India from Jones to Tagore|last=Gibson|first=Mary Ellis|publisher=Ohio University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0821419410|location=|pages=166|via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Makers Of Indian Literature: Michael Madhusudan Dutt|last=Bose|first=Amalendu|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|year=1979|location=New Delhi|pages=49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Albert Napoleon (1869 - 22 August 1909),&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and a daughter, Henrietta Elizabeth Sermista&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; (1859 - 15 February 1879).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A fourth child was stillborn.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Their relationship lasted until the end of his life, Henrietta pre-deceasing him by three days, on 26 June 1873.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Rebecca died in Madras in July 1892. Only a daughter and a son survived her. The son, McTavish-Dutt, parctised as a pleader in the Court of Small Causes in Madras.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Death==
Madhusudan died in Calcutta General Hospital on 29 June 1873.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Just three days prior to his death, Madhusudan recited a passage from Shakespeare's Macbeth to his dear friend [[Gour Das Bysack|Bysack]], to express his deepest conviction of life:
&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
...out, out, brief candle!
Life's but a walking shadow; a poor player,
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
And then is heard no more; it is a tale Told by an idiot,
full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Legacy and honours==
Dutt was largely ignored for 15 years after his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parabaas.com/translation/database/reviews/brLured1.html "A Review": Ghulam Murshid, ''Lured by Hope: A Biography of Michael Madhusudan Dutt''], translated from Bengali by Gopa Majumdar, Oxford University Press, New Delhi, 2003. {{ISBN|0-19-565362-9}}. Pp 238 + xvi, at Parabaas&lt;/ref&gt; The belated tribute was a tomb erected at his gravesite.

His epitaph, a verse of his own, reads:
&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
Stop a while, traveller!
Should Mother Bengal claim thee for her son.
As a child takes repose on his mother's elysian lap,
Even so here in the Long Home,
On the bosom of the earth,
Enjoys the sweet eternal sleep

The use of naval drifters is paralleled by the use of [[naval trawler]]s.

[[Fishing trawler]]s were designed to tow heavy trawls, so they were easily adapted to tow minesweepers, with the crew and layout already suited to the task. Drifters were robust boats built, like trawlers, to work in most weather conditions, but designed to deploy and retrieve [[drift net]]s. They were generally smaller and slower than trawlers. If requisitioned by navies, they were typically armed with an anti-submarine gun and depth charges and used to maintain and patrol anti-submarine nets.
__NOTOC__
==World War I==

}}

Like fishing trawlers, the [[Royal Navy]] requisitioned many fishing drifters for conversion to naval use during [[World War I]].

In addition, 362 naval drifters were ordered to [[Admiralty]] specifications (and thus are often referred to as "Admiralty drifters").&lt;ref name="Conway"&gt;Gardiner et al., p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Shipyards used to building fishing trawlers or drifters could easily switch to constructing naval versions. As a bonus these drifters could be sold to commercial fishing interests when the war ended.

There were two basic types of Admiralty-built drifters, wooden hulled and steel hulled.

* The wooden hull vessels displaced 175 tons, were 86&amp;nbsp;ft (26.2 m) long, with a beam of 19&amp;nbsp;ft (5.8 m). They had a speed of 9 knots and carried one [[6 pounder gun]]. 91 wooden hull vessels were launched 1918–20, and 100 similar Canadian-built craft were ordered in January 1917.&lt;ref name="Conway"/&gt;
* The steel hull vessels displaced 199 tons, were 86&amp;nbsp;ft (26.2 m) long, with a beam of 18&amp;nbsp;ft 6in (5.6 m). They also had a speed of 9 knots and carried a 6 pounder gun. 123 steel-hulled vessels were launched 1917–1920, and 48 others were cancelled.&lt;ref name="Conway"/&gt;

Royal Navy drifters were named like the trawlers were, except for the Canadian-built vessels which were numbered CD 1 to CD 100.&lt;ref name="Conway"/&gt;

During 1917, a fleet of British drifters, escorted by destroyers and light cruisers,  maintained a blockade of the {{convert|72|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide [[Strait of Otranto]], denying the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] access to the Mediterranean. On 15 May 1917, the Austro-Hungarian Navy [[Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1917)|raided the barrage]].&lt;ref name="Halpern162/3"&gt;Halpern, p. 162&amp;ndash;163&lt;/ref&gt; The Austro-Hungarians gave most drifter crews warning to abandon ship before opening fire.&lt;ref name="Halpern162/3"/&gt; Some drifter crews chose to fight, and the ''Gowan Lee'' returned fire on the Austro-Hungarian ships. The drifter was heavily damaged, but remained afloat. [[Skipper (boating)|Skipper]] [[Joseph Watt]] was later awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for his actions during the battle.&lt;ref name="Halpern163"&gt;Halpern, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 47 drifters in the barrage at the time, 14 were sunk and 4 were damaged.&lt;ref name="Halpern163" /&gt; The lack of sufficient Allied escorts forced the withdrawal of the remaining blockading ships, although only for a short time.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p. 1357&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nepali language|Nepali]] is the national language of [[Nepal]]. Besides being spoken  as a mother tongue by more than 48% of the population of Nepal, it is also spoken in Bhutan and India. The language is recognized in the Nepali constitution as an official language of Nepal.

The variety presented here is standard Nepali as spoken in Nepal. There are three major dialects: eastern, central, and western. Though many dialects can be distinguished in Nepal and other South Asian countries, there is reported to be little variation in phonology from one to another.&lt;ref name="Bandhu et al. 1971"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bandhu|Dahal|Holzhausen|Hale|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vowels==
Nepali has 11 phonologically distinctive vowels, including 6 oral vowels and 5 [[nasal vowels]] (indicated in the IPA with tildes &lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt;). In addition, due to a process of h-deletion, there are words in which some speakers produce long vowels, such as {{IPA|[paaɽ]}} ('mountain'), analyzed phonemically as {{IPA|/pʌɦaɖ/}}.&lt;ref name="Pokharel 1989"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pokharel|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{|class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|+Nepali vowel phonemes&lt;ref name="Pokharel 1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Khatiwada 2009 377"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Khatiwada|2009|p=377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-

|-
! [[Open-mid vowel|Open-mid]]
|
|
| {{IPA|ʌ ʌ̃}}
|-
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
|
| {{IPA|a ã}}
|
|}

As the above list shows, there are five nasal vowels. The high mid back vowel {{IPA|/o/}} does not have a nasal counterpart at the phonological level; although the vowel {{IPA|[õ]}} does exist phonetically in the language, it is  often in free variation with its oral counterpart, as in {{IPA|[hotso]}} ~ {{IPA|[hõtso]}} 'short', {{IPA|[bʱeɽaa]}} ~ {{IPA|[bʱẽɽaa]}} 'sheep'. Nasal vowels are not frequent in the Nepali lexicon, compared to a language such as French in which the number of nasal vowels is large. They occur mostly in verbs.

According to {{Harvcoltxt|Bandhu|Dahal|Holzhausen|Hale|1971}}, the evidence for the distinctiveness of vowel nasalization is not nearly as strong as that for the distinctiveness of the six oral vowels. They state that minimal pairs are easily obtainable only for the vowel {{IPA|/a/}}.  Examples are shown below:

* {{IPA|/kap/}} 'inside corner', {{IPA|/kãp/}} 'tremble!' (2nd p. sg. imperative)
* {{IPA|/bas/}} ('shelter'), {{IPA|/bãs/}} ('bamboo')
* {{IPA|/bʱaɽa/}} ('rent'),  {{IPA|/bʱãɽa/}} ('pots')
* {{IPA|/tat/}} ('be heated!'), {{IPA|/tãt/}} ('row')
* {{IPA|/tsap/}} ('pressure'), {{IPA|/tsãp/}} ('magnolia wood')

Other minimal pairs include {{IPA|/naũ/}} ('name') vs. {{IPA|/nau/}} ('barber') and {{IPA|/ɡaũ/}} ('village') vs. {{IPA|/ɡau/}} ('sing' 2nd p. sg. imperative). At the phonetic level, oral vowels can be nasalized when following a nasal consonant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Khatiwada|2009|p=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diphthongs===
{{Harvcoltxt|Pokharel|1989|pp=37–38}} followed   two diphthongs first elaborated by  Shivaraja Acharya in वर्णोच्चारण शिक्षा in 1974.

==Consonants==
Spoken Nepali has 33 consonants in its native system though some have tried to limit the number to 27.

| colspan="2" |

|}

The glides {{IPA|[j]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} are nonsyllabic variants of {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}, respectively.&lt;ref name="Khatiwada 2009 373"/&gt;  All consonants but these two, {{IPA|/l/}}, and {{IPA|/ɦ/}} may also occur as [[gemination|geminates]] between vowels.&lt;ref name="Khatiwada 2009 376"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Khatiwada|2009|p=376}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from forming lexically distinctive words, as in {{IPA|/tsʌpʌl/}} {{lang|ne|चपल}}  ('unstable') and {{IPA|/tsʌppʌl/}} {{lang|ne|चप्पल}}  ('slipper'), gemination also forms the intensive degree of adjectives, as in {{IPA|/miʈʈʰo/}} ('very delicious'), compare {{IPA|/miʈʰo/}} ('delicious').

The [[murmured voice|murmured]] stops may lose their breathy-voice between vowels and word-finally.&lt;ref name="Khatiwada 2009 376"/&gt; Non-geminate [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] and murmured stops may also become fricatives (e.g. {{IPA|/sʌpʰa/}} 'clean' → {{IPA|[sʌɸa]}}; {{IPA|/ʌɡʱaɖi/}} 'before' → {{IPA|[ʌɣaɽi]}}).&lt;ref name="Khatiwada 2009 376"/&gt;

{{IPA|/ɖ ɖʱ/}} are flapped ({{IPAblink|ɽ}}) in postvocalic position. {{IPA|/r/}} is always a trill.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Acharya|1991|pp=16, 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, sounds transcribed with the retroflex symbols {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ʈ, ʈʰ, ɖ, ɖʱ, ɽ, ɳ, ɽ̃}}}} are not purely retroflex {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ʈ}}, ʈʰ, {{IPA link|ɖ}}, ɖʱ, {{IPA link|ɽ}}, {{IPA link|ɳ}}, ɽ̃]}} but apical postalveolar {{IPA|[{{IPA link|t̠}}, t̠ʰ, {{IPA link|d̠}}, d̠ʱ, {{IPA link|ɾ̠}}, {{IPA link|n̠}}, ɾ̠̃]}}. Some speakers may use purely retroflex sounds after {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/a/}}, but other speakers use the apical articulation in all positions.&lt;ref name="Khatiwada 2009 374"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Khatiwada|2009|p=374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debated consonants===
Mostly words from Sanskrit have consonants that are not very common in inventory of the spoken language,&lt;ref name="Khatiwada 2009 374"/&gt; occurring in borrowed words where they are prescriptively pronounced as described in Sanskrit grammars. The retroflex nasal {{IPA|[ɳ]}} occurs in the speech of some speakers, in words such as {{IPA|/baɳ/}} {{lang|ne|बाण}} ('arrow'). It is flapped {{IPA|[ɽ̃]}} before other retroflex consonants and in spelling pronunciations of some loanwords in Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="Khatiwada 2009 377"/&gt; A posterior sibilant {{IPA|[ʃ]}} occurs in such words as {{IPA|/nareʃ/}} {{lang|ne|नरेश}} ('king'). The language does not have any minimal pairs opposing {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, and speakers sometimes use these sounds interchangeably.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5072">'''Olav Nygard''' (July 10, 1884, [[Modalen]] – February 11, 1924) was a Norwegian poet from [[Modalen]] in [[Hordaland]]. Nygard is now considered one of the most important Norwegian authors of his time, but was, however, not especially acknowledged while alive.

== Life and background ==
Nygard was born in an isolated farm in the rural district of Modalen, [[Norway]], being the second youngest of altogether ten siblings. He started writing relatively early, mainly poems, and was soon determined to become a full-time writer. His childhood, however, was not easy, losing his mother at the age of ten, and having to work at his father's farm after finishing elementary school. He was a very gifted wood carver, creating, among other things, his own [[fiddle]], which he would use playing at local dancing arrangements. He had a special interest in the local dialect, collecting tales and words told by his father. Finally, during his 1904-1905 stay at Møre Folkehøgskule in [[Ørsta]], Nygard came in touch with a more academic group of people. He met Petra Krøvel, his first wife, who died of [[tuberculosis]] shortly afterwards. From 1909-1910 he lived in [[Oslo]], partially at Labråten, the [[Asker]] residence of [[Arne Garborg]]. The advice and support of him and his wife [[Hulda Garborg]] were of great importance for Nygard, even later on in life. Nygard made his living in several different professions, but mostly as a self-dependent farmer. In 1912 he married Rakel Tvedt, with whom he had a son in 1916. The little family had money problems almost constantly, making Nygard's artistic work difficult. As his first wife, Nygard suffered from tubercolosis. He seemed for a while to be recovering, but eventually died in 1924.

== Poetry ==
Nygard almost exclusively wrote poetry. He was not notably influenced by other Norwegian authors at his time, wrtiting in a fashion quite different from the trend. [[Henrik Wergeland]], though, was a major source of inspiration. So was also British authors like [[William Shakespeare]] and [[John Keats]], not to mention [[Robert Burns]], of whom Nygard translated several poems.

Nygard is himself within a clearly romantic tradition, but with a very distinctive tone. What most obviously separates him from the increasingly modernistic authors of his own time, is the archaic language he always uses. It is [[Nynorsk]], but shaped by his own dialect and with a vast variety of words, many of them endemic to his own poetic production. He frequently puts words together in unexpected ways, thus creating several hundred new words found only in these poems. Sadly, it is also Nygard's rich language that has become the biggest obstacle for new readers, having sometimes difficulties understanding the content. If one, however, gets to the bottom of possible language barriers, one comes to discover a poetry dealing with many of life's greatest issues. Nygard is said, possibly because of his early death and rather sorrowfull life, to be concerned very much with death in his poems. To some extent, this is indeed true. But it is also a vibrant poetry, using powerful images and connecting the forces of life, death and nature in a vital, ambitious way. Nature is often represented in metaphores, sometimes with a mystic and even erotic use of images. Some modernistic patterns can be found especially in his later poetry, such as the occurrence of a "[[meta]]"-perspective on his own role as a poet. But while many authors of his time wrote in a more realistic and concrete fashion, Nygard held on to an almost cosmological style.

Although rarely read by most, Nygard is considered an important author in the change from late romantic to modernistic Norwegian literature, and a major poetic talent. Norwegian author [[Claes Gill]] is known to have stated about Nygard, that he, "[...] if writing in a World language, would have been among the greatest poets in international literature."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bergen.folkebibl.no/vestlandsforfattere/forfat/nygard2.html Nettbiblioteket - Vestlandsforfattere - Olav Nygard - Saknad heiter livet mitt&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.bergen.folkebibl.no&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oscar Vladislas de Lubicz Milosz''' ({{lang-lt|'''Oskaras Milašius'''}}; Polish: '''''Oskar Władysław Miłosz''''') (28 May 1877 &amp;ndash; 2 March 1939) was a French language&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/nov/10/poetry.artsandhumanities A century's witness].

Czesław Miłosz. 2006p.203&lt;/ref&gt; His literary career began at the end of the nineteenth century during ''la Belle Époque'' and reached its high point in the mid-1920s with the books ''Ars Magna'' and ''Les Arcanes'', in which he developed a highly personal and dense Christian cosmogony comparable to that of Dante in ''The Divine Comedy'' and John Milton in ''Paradise Lost''.

Oscar Milosz was born in Čareja, [[Minsk Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]] those times, now territory of [[Belarus]], where he also spent his childhood.  His father, Vladislas de Lubicz Milosz, was ethnically Lithuanian, nominally Catholic, and for a time an officer in the Russian army. His mother, Marie Rosalie Rosenthal, was Jewish, the daughter of a Hebrew professor at the University of Warsaw. The family spoke Polish at home. Oscar was baptized a Catholic on 2 July 1886, at [[St. Alexander's Church, Warsaw|St. Alexander's Church]] in [[Warsaw]]. In 1889, when he was 12, his parents placed him at the [[Lycée Janson de Sailly]] in [[Paris]]. He began writing poems in 1894 and started to frequent artistic circles, meeting [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Jean Moréas]]. After finishing at the Lycée, he enrolled at the [[École des langues orientales]], where he studied [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].

[[File:Lietuvos atstovybe Paryziuje. Representation of Lithuania in Paris.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Oscar Milosz with the personnel of Representation of Lithuania in Paris]]

His first book of verse, ''Le Poème des Décadences'', appeared in 1899. In the first years of the twentieth century, Milosz travelled widely in Europe and [[North Africa]] and explored many foreign literatures. A European poet of the French language, Milosz was an excellent linguist and was fluent in French, [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], English, German, Italian, and Spanish as well as being able to read [[Latin language|Latin]] and Hebrew. Later in life, he would also learn Lithuanian and [[Basque language|Basque]].

Milosz published his second poetry collection, the more accomplished ''Les Sept Solitudes'', in 1906. He then entered into a phase of literary experimentation during which he tried his hand at a novel, ''L'Amoureuse Initiation,'' published in 1910, and three "mystery dramas," the most popular of these plays being ''Miguel Mañara'' (1913), a reworking of the Don Juan myth. During this time he also composed his third poetry collection, ''Les'' ''Éléments'' (1911).

On 14 December 1914, while praying at the end of an evening of intensive reading of the Bible and [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], Milosz experienced an illumination, a divine vision that led him to proclaim the next day to one of his friends: "I have seen the spiritual sun."&lt;ref&gt;Bamford (ed.), 1985, p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of this vision, his poetry became more profound. He began to study the [[Kabbalah]], and Renaissance and Baroque alchemists and mystics like [[Paracelsus]] and [[Jacob Boehme]]. After 1916, as the development of his metaphysics became his major poetic preoccupation, Milosz convinced himself that his cosmogonic system was supported by Einstein's theory of relativity. Then, turning his back on "occult" reading and friends, like the numerologist René Schwaller de Lubicz, he began to study medieval science and thinkers like the English scholastic Robert Grosseteste. Finally, in 1927 he took a Father Confessor and became a practicing Roman Catholic, which he remained for the last twelve years of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Buzaite, Saule, ″Psychobiography: Oskaras Milašius″, ''Lituanus'' (Lithuanian Quarterly Journal of Arts and Sciences), vol. 46, no. 4, Winter 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, during [[World War I]], Milosz was conscripted to the Russian division of the [[French army]] and was assigned to the press corps. After the [[Russian revolution|Russian Revolution]] of October 1917, Čareja was seized by the Soviets. Suddenly, access to his family fortune was cut off and Milosz needed to earn a living. Around this time he learned about the growing movement for [[Act of Independence of Lithuania|Lithuanian independence]]. By the end of the war when both [[Lithuania]] and Poland were effectively independent again, Milosz chose to identify with Lithuania - even though he did not yet speak Lithuanian &amp;mdash; because he believed that it had been the original homeland of his ancestors in the 13th century. In 1920 when France recognized the independence of Lithuania, he was officially appointed [[Chargé d'Affaires]] for the new state. Milosz's diplomatic career remains one of the more fascinating aspects of his legacy; his articles and correspondence in the service of the reborn Lithuanian state show a high level of nuance and rigor. In 1931 he became a French citizen and was awarded the [[Légion d'honneur]].

Shortly after retiring from his diplomatic post and ill with cancer, he died of a heart attack in 1939 at a house he had recently purchased in [[Fontainebleau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://milosz.ifrance.com/milosz/Biographie%20Milosz.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001012144733/http://milosz.ifrance.com/milosz/Biographie%20Milosz.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2000-10-12 |title=Biography of Oscar Milosz |accessdate=2008-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Milosz was largely neglected during his lifetime. He has increasingly, however, come to be considered an important figure in French poetry. In a 1926 letter to James Chouvet, he writes:  "... [my] studies have taught me the only thing they could. Namely, that the truth is one, and that some respect and love are enough to discover it in the depths of our consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Buzaite, S., ″Psychobiography″.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as being a writer of great erudition and breadth, Milosz edited three books of Lithuanian folk tales and songs.

'''Photoperiodism''' is the physiological reaction of organisms to the length of day or night. It occurs in [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s. Photoperiodism can also be defined as the developmental responses of plants to the relative lengths of light and dark periods.
They are classified under three groups according to the photoperiods,they are:
1. Short-day plants
2. Long-day plants
3. Day-neutral plants.

Many [[flowering plant]]s (angiosperms) use a [[photoreceptor protein]], such as [[phytochrome]] or [[cryptochrome]],&lt;ref name=mauseth&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last= Mauseth|first= James D.|title=Botany : An Introduction to Plant Biology |edition=3rd|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7637-2134-3|publisher= Jones and Bartlett Learning|location=Sudbury, MA|pages=422–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; to sense seasonal changes in night length, or photoperiod, which they take as signals to flower. In a further subdivision, ''obligate'' photoperiodic plants absolutely require a long or short enough night before flowering, whereas ''facultative'' photoperiodic plants are more likely to flower under one condition.

Phytochrome comes in two forms: pr and pfr. Red light (which is present during the day) converts phytochrome to its active form (pfr). This then triggers the plant to grow. In turn, far-red light is present in the shade or in the dark and this converts phytochrome from pfr to pr. Pr is the inactive form of phytochrome and will not allow for plant growth. This system of pfr to pr conversion allows the plant to sense when it is night and when it is day.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Pfr can also be convereted back to Pr by a process known as dark reversion, where long periods of darkness trigger the conversion of Pfr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Casal|first=J.J.|date=2014|title=Light perception and signalling by phytochrome A|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=65 (11).|issue=11|pages=2835–2845|doi=10.1093/jxb/ert379}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important in regards to plant flowering. Experiments by Halliday et al. showed that manipulations of the red-to far-red ratio in Arabidopsis can alter flowering. They discovered that plants tend to flower later when exposed to more red light, proving that red light is inhibitory to flowering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Chentao|date=2000|title=Photoreceptors and Regulation of Flowering Time|url=|journal=Plant Physiology|volume=123|issue=1|pages=39–50|doi=10.1104/pp.123.1.39|pmid=10806223|pmc=1539253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other experiments have proven this  by exposing plants to extra red-light in the middle of the night. A short-day plant will not flower if light is turned on for a few minutes in the middle of the night and a long-day plant can flower if exposed to more red-light in the middle of the night.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Cryptochromes are another type of photoreceptor that is important in photoperiodism. Cryptochromes absorb blue light and UV-A. Cryptochromes entrain the circadian clock to light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Chentao|date=2005|title=The cryptochromes|url=|journal= Genome Biology|volume=6|issue=5|pages=220|doi=10.1186/gb-2005-6-5-220|pmid=15892880|pmc=1175950}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that both cryptochrome and phytochrome abundance relies on light and the amount of cryptochrome can change depending on day-length. This shows how important both of the photoreceptors are in regards to determining day-length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mockler|first=Todd|date=2003|title=Regulation of photoperiodic flowering by Arabidopsis photoreceptors|url=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=100 | issue = 4 |pages=2140–2145|doi=10.1073/pnas.0437826100|pmc=149972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, W. W. Garner and H. A. Allard published their discoveries on photoperiodism and felt it was the length of daylight that was critical,&lt;ref name=mauseth /&gt;&lt;ref name=GA&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Capon|first=Brian|title=Botany for Gardeners|year=2005|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0-88192-655-2|publisher=Timber Publishing|location=Portland, OR|pages=148–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was later discovered that the length of the night was the controlling factor.&lt;ref name=h1&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hamner, K.C. |author2=Bonner, J. |year=1938|title=Photoperiodism in relation to hormones as factors in floral initiation and development|journal=Botanical Gazette|volume=100|issue=2|pages=388–431|jstor=2471641|doi=10.1086/334793}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h2&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hamner, K.C.|year=1940|title=Interrelation of light and darkness in photoperiodic induction|journal=Botanical Gazette|volume=101|issue=3|pages=658–87|jstor=2472399|doi=10.1086/334903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photoperiodic flowering plants are classified as ''long-day plants'' or ''short-day plants'' even though night is the critical factor because of the initial misunderstanding about daylight being the controlling factor. Along with long-day plants and short-day plants, there are plants that fall into a "dual-day length category". These plants are either long-short-day plants (LSDP) or short-long-day plants (SLDP). LSDPs flower after a series of long days followed by short days whereas SLDPs flower after a series of short days followed by long days.&lt;ref name="Taiz"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taiz|first1=Lincoln|last2=Zeiger|first2=Eduardo|last3=Møller|first3=Ian|last4=Murphy|first4=Angus|title=Plant Physiology and Development|date=2015|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc.|location=Sunderland, MA|isbn=978-1-60535-353-1|edition=Sixth}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Each plant has a different length critical photoperiod, or critical night length.&lt;ref name=mauseth /&gt;

Modern biologists believe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Andrés |first=Fernando |last2=Galbraith |first2=David W. |last3=Talón |first3=Manuel |last4=Domingo |first4=Concha |date=2009-08-12 |title=Analysis of PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 Sheds Light on the Role of Phytochromes in Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice |journal=Plant Physiology |volume=151 |issue=2 |pages=681–690 |doi=10.1104/pp.109.139097|pmc=2754645 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that it is the coincidence of the active forms of phytochrome or cryptochrome, created by light during the daytime, with the rhythms of the [[circadian clock]] that allows plants to measure the length of the night. Other than flowering, photoperiodism in plants includes the growth of stems or roots during certain seasons and the loss of leaves. Artificial lighting can be used to induce extra-long days.&lt;ref name=mauseth /&gt;

=== Long-day plants ===
Long-day plants flower when the night length falls below their critical photoperiod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=517|title=Plant Structure and Function|last1=Starr|first1=Cecie|last2=Taggart|first2=Ralph|last3=Evers|first3=Christine|last4=Starr|first4=Lisa|volume=4|edition=13th|publisher=Brooks/Cole|isbn=978-1-111-58068-1|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plants typically flower in the [[northern hemisphere]] during late spring or early summer as days are getting longer. In the northern hemisphere, the longest day of the year (summer solstice) is on or about 21 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gooley|first=Tristan|title=The Natural Navigator|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-7535-2311-7|date=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that date, days grow shorter (i.e. nights grow longer) until 21 December (the winter solstice). This situation is reversed in the southern hemisphere (i.e., longest day is 21 December and shortest day is 21 June).&lt;ref name=mauseth /&gt;&lt;ref name=GA /&gt;

Some long-day obligate plants are:
* [[Dianthus caryophyllus|Carnation]] (''Dianthus'')
* [[Hyoscyamus niger|Henbane]] (''Hyoscyamus'')
* [[Oat]] (''Avena'')

Some long-day facultative plants are:
* [[Pea]] (''Pisum sativum)
* [[Barley]] (''Hordeum vulgare'')
* [[Lettuce]] (''Lactuca sativa'')
* [[Wheat]] (''Triticum aestivum'')

=== Short-day plants ===
Short-day plants flower when the night lengths exceed their critical photoperiod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=BSCS Biology|publisher=BSCS|edition=9|page=519|isbn=978-0-7872-9008-5|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; They cannot flower under short nights or if a pulse of artificial light is shone on the plant for several minutes during the night; they require a continuous period of darkness before floral development can begin. Natural nighttime light, such as moonlight or lightning, is not of sufficient brightness or duration to interrupt flowering.&lt;ref name=mauseth /&gt;&lt;ref name=GA /&gt;

In general, short-day (i.e.long-night) plants flower as days grow shorter (and nights grow longer) after 21 June in the northern hemisphere, which is during summer or fall. The length of the dark period required to induce flowering differs among species and varieties of a species.

Photoperiodism affects flowering by inducing the shoot to produce floral buds instead of leaves and lateral buds.

Some short-day facultative plants are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Hamlyn G.|title=Plants and Microclimate: A Quantitative Approach to Environmental Plant Physiology|page=225|isbn=978-0-521-42524-7|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Day-neutral plants ===
Day-neutral plants, such as [[cucumber]]s, [[rose]]s, and [[tomato]]es, do not initiate flowering based on photoperiodism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meneely|first=Philip|title=Genetic Analysis: Genes, Genomes, and Networks in Eukaryotes|page=373|edition=2|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-968126-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they may initiate flowering after attaining a certain overall developmental stage or age, or in response to alternative environmental stimuli, such as [[vernalisation]] (a period of low temperature).&lt;ref name=mauseth /&gt;&lt;ref name=GA /&gt;

== Animal ==
{{anchor|In animals}}
Daylength, and thus knowledge of the season of the year, is vital to many animals. A number of biological and behavioural changes are dependent on this knowledge. Together with temperature changes, photoperiod provokes changes in the color of fur and feathers, migration, entry into [[hibernation]], [[animal sexual behavior|sexual behaviour]], and even the resizing of sexual organs.

The singing frequency of birds such as the [[Domestic Canary|canary]] depends on the photoperiod. In the spring, when the photoperiod increases (more daylight), the male canary's testes grow. As the testes grow, more androgens are secreted and song frequency increases. During autumn, when the photoperiod decreases (less daylight), the male canary's testes regress and androgen levels drop dramatically, resulting in decreased singing frequency. Not only is singing frequency dependent on the photoperiod but the song repertoire is also. The long photoperiod of spring results in a greater song repertoire. Autumn's shorter photoperiod results in a reduction in song repertoire. These behavioral photoperiod changes in male canaries are caused by changes in the song center of the brain. As the photoperiod increases, the [[high vocal center]] (HVC) and the robust nucleus of the [[archistriatum]] (RA) increase in size. When the photoperiod decreases, these areas of the brain regress.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Randy J. (2005) An Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology (p.189). Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mammals, daylength is registered in the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), which is informed by [[photosensitive ganglion cell|retinal light-sensitive ganglion cells]], which are not involved in vision. The information travels through the [[retinohypothalamic tract]] (RHT). Some mammals are highly seasonal, while humans' seasonality is largely believed to be [[evolutionary baggage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/scienceshow/stories/2009/2762261.htm |title=Extra-retinal photo receptors |accessdate=2010-05-28 |last=Foster |first=Russell |author2=Williams, Robyn |date=5 December 2009 |format=Interview |work=Science Show |publisher=ABC Radio National |quote=...we have the evolutionary baggage of showing seasonality but we're not entirely sure what the mechanism is.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{relevance inline|date=April 2018}}

'''Pilagá''' is a [[Guaicuruan languages|Guaicuruan]] language spoken by 4,000 people in the [[Bermejo River|Bermejo]] and [[Pilcomayo River]] valleys, western [[Formosa Province]], in northeastern [[Argentina]].

==Sociocultural context==
The geographical distribution into communities is permeated by pan-Chacoan social organization of people into bands.      	

According to Braunstein (1983), among the Chaco groups several bands constitute a ‘tribe’, identified by a common name and associated by marriage and exchange. He states that tribes have been preferably endogamous, with uxirolocal  postmarital residence. Among the Pilagá, tribes have identified with names of  regional animals and these traditional denominations persist in present times.

As many anthropologists have noted, the Chaco groups, including the Pilagá, have been hunter-gatherers. Hunting includes fishing and collection of honey. Hunting is exclusively the domain of  men, while gathering of  wild fruits, palm hearts, mesquite (prosopis sp.) and firewood is done regularly by women. The major animals hunted are species of deers and armadillos. Among the fish specimens are surubí (Pseudoplatysoma coruscans), pacú (colossoma mitrei) and dorado (salminus maxillosus).

With the advancement of European contact since the conquest, and with the establishment at different times of colonies, farms and missions, Chaco groups, including the Pilagá, began losing their territories. They became  confined to smaller portions of lands, and as a consequence, they discontinued their hunter-gathering activities.  Today, with sedentarization, Pilagá people combine traditional practices with land-cultivation and cattle-raising  at a small scale, and the commerce of basketery, tapestry and wooden artifacts.

==Genetic Language Affiliation==
Pilagá belongs to the grouping of Guaykuruan (also spelled ‘Waikuruan’ or ‘Guaicuruan’) languages spoken in the Gran Chaco of South America. The word  Chaco, of  Quichua origin, means ‘territory of hunting’ (Cordeu and Siffredi 1971:5). The Gran Chaco covers an area of  about 1 million square kilometers, of which 50% is on Argentinean land, and the other half distributed between Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil (Karlin et alt. 1994).   
Out of the six languages that have been claimed to belong to this family, only four  i.e., Kadiwéu (or Caduveo), Mocoví, Pilagá and Toba are currently spoken. The other two, Abipón and Mbayá became extinct more than a century ago.

==Degree of Endangerment==
Pilagá enjoys a good level of vitality, being the first language children acquire before starting school. 
However, Formosa’s Ministry of Education has not developed key bilingual educational programs or curriculum for the Pilagá. Moreover, only a few schools (six of  a total of sixteen) have Pilagá-speaking aides working together with certified teachers as translators. However, the program is rather ineffective for lack of scope or sequence for Pilagá instruction and few didactic materials.
     
Even though Pilagá use in daily communication between adults connotes solidarity, younger speakers use code-switching apparently to fill gaps in their knowledge of the vernacular language. 
Those areas where Pilagá language  and traditions are best preserved are the rural communities. However, the lack of native-language schooling to Pilagá children makes the future of the language bleak.

==Sounds and Writing System==
The inventory includes obstruents and sonorants, totalizing eighteen consonant phonemes, and four vowels. In 1996 the Pilagá designed the orthographic system currently used.

*Consonants: p,  t, ch, k,q, ʔ,  d, g, ʕ, h, l, ll, m, n, ñ, w, y
*Vowels: a, e, o, i

In [[religion]] and [[theology]], '''revelation''' is the revealing or disclosing of some form of [[Religious views on truth|truth]] or [[Knowledge#Religious meaning of knowledge|knowledge]] through communication with a [[deity]] or other [[supernatural]] entity or entities.

==Description==
Some religions have [[religious texts]] which they view as divinely or supernaturally revealed or inspired. For instance, [[Orthodox Jews]], [[Christian]]s and [[Muslims]] believe that the ''[[Torah]]'' was received from [[Yahweh]] on [[biblical Mount Sinai]].&lt;ref&gt;Beale G.K., The Book of Revelation, NIGTC, Grand Rapids – Cambridge 1999. = {{ISBN|0-8028-2174-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, John L. ''What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002), pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Christians believe that both the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]] were [[Biblical inspiration|inspired]] by God. Muslims believe the [[Quran]] was revealed by God to [[Muhammad]] word by word through the angel [[Gabriel]] (''Jibril'').&lt;ref name=Lambert&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lambert|first1=Gray|title=The Leaders Are Coming!|date=2013|publisher=WestBow Press|isbn=9781449760137|page=287|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sV0mAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA287&amp;dq=%22Muslims+believe+that+the+Quran+was+verbally+revealed%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=e8lCVMimDZS2yASeuYHgDg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Muslims%20believe%20that%20the%20Quran%20was%20verbally%20revealed%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams &amp; Drew"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roy H.

The 15,000 handwritten pages produced by the mystic [[Maria Valtorta]] were represented as direct dictations from [[Jesus]], while she attributed ''[[The Book of Azariah]]'' to her [[guardian angel]].&lt;ref&gt;Maria Valtorta, ''The Poem of the Man God'', {{ISBN|99926-45-57-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aleister Crowley]] stated that ''[[The Book of the Law]]'' had been revealed to him through a higher being that called itself ''[[Aiwass]]''.

A revelation communicated by a supernatural entity reported as being present during the event is called a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]. Direct conversations between the recipient and the supernatural entity,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Freze, 1993, ''Voices, Visions, and Apparitions'', OSV Publishing {{ISBN|0-87973-454-X}} p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; or physical marks such as [[stigmata]], have been reported. In rare cases, such as that of Saint [[Juan Diego]], physical artifacts accompany the revelation.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Freze, 1989 ''They Bore the Wounds of Christ'' {{ISBN|0-87973-422-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Catholic]] concept of [[interior locution]] includes just an inner voice heard by the recipient.

In the [[Abrahamic religions]], the term is used to refer to the process by which [[God]] reveals knowledge of himself, his [[Will of God|will]], and his [[divine providence]] to the world of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/revelation |title=Revelation &amp;#124; Define Revelation at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In secondary usage, revelation refers to the resulting human knowledge about God, [[prophecy]], and other [[divine]] things. Revelation from a supernatural source plays a less important role in some other religious traditions such as [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]].

==Background==
Revelation may be defined as the communication of some truth by God to a rational creature through means which are beyond the ordinary course of nature. George Joyce draws a distinction between revelation and inspiration. Inspiration – such as that bestowed by God on the author of a sacred book – involves a special illumination of the mind, in virtue of which the recipient conceives such thoughts as God desires him to commit to writing, and does not necessarily involve supernatural communication.&lt;ref name=joyce&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13001a.htm |title=Joyce, George. "Revelation." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 3 May 2014 |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in Europe, beginning about the mid-17th century, the development of [[rationalism]], [[materialism]] and [[history of atheism|atheism]], the concept of supernatural revelation itself faced skepticism. In  ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' (1794&amp;ndash;1809), [[Thomas Paine]] develops the theology of [[deism]], rejecting the possibility of [[miracle]]s and arguing that a revelation can be considered valid only for the original recipient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Types==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}

===Individual revelation===
[[Thomas Aquinas]] believed in two types of individual revelation from [[God in Christianity|God]], ''[[general revelation]]'' and ''[[special revelation]]''. In [[general revelation]], God reveals himself through his creation, such that at least some truths about God can be learned by the [[empiricism|empirical]] study of nature, [[physics]], [[cosmology]], etc., to an individual. Special revelation is the knowledge of God and spiritual matters which can be discovered through [[supernatural]] means, such as scripture or miracles, by individuals. [[Direct revelation]] refers to communication from God to someone in particular.

Though one may deduce the existence of God and some of God's attributes through general revelation, certain specifics may be known only through special revelation. Aquinas believed that special revelation is equivalent to the revelation of God in Jesus. The major theological components of Christianity, such as the [[Trinity]] and the [[Incarnation]], are revealed in the teachings of the church and the scriptures and may not otherwise be deduced. Special revelation and natural revelation are complementary rather than contradictory in nature.

"[[Continuous revelation]]" is a term for the theological position that God continues to reveal divine principles or commandments to humanity.

In the 20th century, religious [[existentialist]]s proposed that revelation held no content in and of itself but rather that God inspired people with his presence by coming into contact with them. Revelation is a human response that records how we respond to God.

===Public revelation===
[[File:The Ten Commandments (Bible Card).jpg|thumb|right|upright|100px|The mass-revelation at the [[Mount Horeb]] in an illustration from a Christian Bible card published by the Providence Lithograph Company, 1907]]
Some religious groups believe a deity has been revealed or spoken to a large group of people or have legends to a similar effect. In the [[Book of Deuteronomy]], [[Yahweh]] is said to have been revealed upon giving the [[Ten Commandments]] to the [[Israelites]] at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. In [[Christianity]], the [[Book of Acts]] describes the [[Pentecost|Day of Pentecost]] wherein a large group of the followers of [[Jesus]] experienced mass revelation. The [[Lakota people]] believe [[White Buffalo Calf Woman|Ptesáŋwiŋ]] spoke directly to the people in the establishment of Lakota religious traditions. Some versions of an [[Aztec mythology|Aztec legend]] tell of [[Huitzilopochtli]] speaking directly to the Aztec people upon their arrival at [[Anahuac (Aztec)|Anåhuac]]. Historically, some [[List of people who have been considered deities|emperors, cult leaders, and other figures]] have also been deified and treated as though their words are themselves revelations.

==Methods==
===Verbal===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
Some people hold that God can communicate with man in a way that gives direct, [[propositional]] content: This is termed ''verbal revelation''. [[Orthodox Judaism]] and some forms of Christianity hold that the first five books of [[Moses]] were dictated by God in such a fashion.

===Non-verbal propositional===
One school of thought holds that revelation is non-verbal and non-literal, yet it may have propositional content. People were divinely inspired by God with a message, but not in a verbal-like fashion.

[[Rabbi]] [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] has written, "To convey what the prophets experienced, the Bible could either use terms of descriptions or terms of indication.  Any description of the act of revelation in empirical categories would have produced a caricature.  That is why all the Bible does is to state that revelation happened; how it happened is something they could only convey in words that are evocative and suggestive."&lt;ref&gt;God in Search of Man&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaiah]] writes that he received his message through visions, where he would see [[YHWH]], the God of Israel, speaking to angelic beings that surrounded him. Isaiah would then write down the dialogue exchanged between YHWH and the angels. This form of revelation constitutes the major part of the text of the [[Book of Isaiah]]. The same formula of divine revelation is used by other prophets throughout the [[Tanakh]], such as Micaiah in [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20kings%2022:19-22&amp;version=HCSB 1 Kings 22:19–22].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09a22.htm |title=1 Kings 22 / Hebrew – English Bible / Mechon-Mamre |publisher=Mechon-mamre.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=November 2010}}

==Epistemology==
Members of [[Abrahamic religions]], including Judaism, Christianity and Islam, believe that God exists and can in some way reveal his will to people. Members of those religions distinguish between true [[prophet]]s and [[false prophet]]s, and there are documents offering criteria by which to distinguish true from false prophets. The question of [[epistemology]] then arises: how to know?

Some believe that revelation can originate directly from a [[deity]] or through an agent such as an [[angel]]. One who has experienced such contact with, or communication from, the divine is often called a prophet. An article (p.&amp;nbsp;555) under the heading "mysticism," and contributed by Ninian Smart, J.&amp;nbsp;F. Rowny Professor of Comparative Religion, University of California, and President of the American Academy of Religion, writing in the 1999 edition of "The Norton Dictionary of Modern Thought," (W.&amp;nbsp;W. Norton &amp; Co. Inc.), suggests that the more proper and wider term for such an encounter would be mystical, making such a person a [[mysticism|mystic]]. All prophets would be mystics, but not all mystics would be prophets.

Revelation from a supernatural source is of lesser importance in some other religious traditions, such as [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]].

==In various religions==

===Bahá'í===
{{Main|Bahá'í literature|Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|}}
[[File:Revelation-writing.jpg|thumb|'Revelation writing': The first draft of a tablet of [[Bahá'u'lláh]]]]
[[Báb|The Báb]], [[Bahá'u'lláh]] and [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] received thousands of written enquiries, and wrote thousands of responses, hundreds of which amount to whole and proper books, while many are shorter texts, such as letters. In addition, the Bahá'í faith has large works which were divinely revealed in a very short time, as in a night, or a few days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Bahá'u'lláh would occasionally write the words of revelation down himself, but normally the revelation was dictated to his amanuensis, who sometimes recorded it in what has been called ''revelation writing'', a shorthand script written with extreme speed owing to the rapidity of the utterance of the words. Afterwards, Bahá'u'lláh revised and approved these drafts. These ''revelation drafts'' and many other transcriptions of Bahá'u'lláh's writings, around 15,000 items, some of which are in his own handwriting, are kept in the [[International Archives|International Bahá'í Archives]] in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A new volume of Bahá'í sacred writings, recently translated and comprising Bahá'u'lláh's call to world leaders, is published | publisher= Bahá'í World Centre | url = http://www.bahaiworldnews.org/story.cfm?storyid=163 | accessdate = 2007-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Taherzadeh |first = A. |year = 1976 |title = The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, Volume 1: Baghdad 1853–63 |publisher = George Ronald |location = Oxford, UK |isbn = 0-85398-270-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For extended comments on the divine revelation of the [[Báb]], [[Bahá'u'lláh]], and [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] see [http://bahai-library.com/number_tablets_bahaullah Number of tablets revealed by Bahá'u'lláh] by Robert Stockman and Juan Cole, [http://bahai-library.com/uhj_numbers_sacred_writings Numbers and Classifications of Sacred Writings texts] by the [[Universal House of Justice]], and Horace Holley's preface of [http://bahai-library.com/compilation_bahai_revelation The Bahá'í Revelation, including Selections from the Bahá'í Holy Writings and Talks by `Abdu'l-Bahá].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{Main|Biblical inspiration|Christian mystics|Visions of Jesus and Mary}}
Many Christians believe in the possibility and even reality of [[private revelation]]s, messages from God for individuals, which can come in a variety of ways. [[Montanism]] is an example in [[early Christianity]] and there are alleged cases today also.&lt;ref name="vatican1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a1.htm#66 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, 67 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Christians see as of a much higher level the revelation recorded in the [[Biblical canon|collection of books]] known as the [[Bible]]. They consider these books to be written by human authors under the inspiration of the [[Holy Spirit]]. They regard Jesus as the supreme revelation of God, with the Bible being a revelation in the sense of a witness to him.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, 426, 516.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' states that "the Christian faith is not a 'religion of the book.' Christianity is the religion of the [[Logos (Christianity)|'Word of God']], a word which is 'not a written and mute word, but the Word which is incarnate and living".&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2nd ed., para. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory and Nix speak of [[Biblical inerrancy]] as meaning that, in its original form, the Bible is totally without error, and free from all contradiction, including the historical and scientific parts.&lt;ref name="inerrancy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Geisler &amp; Nix|publisher=Moody Press, Chicago|year=1986|title=A General Introduction to the Bible|isbn= 0-8024-2916-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coleman speaks of [[Biblical infallibility]] as meaning that the Bible is inerrant on issues of faith and practice but not history or science.&lt;ref name="infallible"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coleman|journal=Theology Today| volume = 31 |issue =  4|year=1975|title=Biblical Inerrancy: Are We Going Anywhere?|doi=10.1177/004057367503100404|first1=R. J.|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic Church]] speaks not about infallibility of Scripture but about its freedom from error, holding "the doctrine of the inerrancy of Scripture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotthahn.com/download/attachment/2516 |title=Cardinal Augustin Bea, "Vatican II and the Truth of Sacred Scripture" |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508175506/http://www.scotthahn.com/download/attachment/2516 |archivedate=2012-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Vatican Council]], citing earlier declarations, stated: "Since everything asserted by the inspired authors or sacred writers must be held to be asserted by the Holy Spirit, it follows that the books of Scripture must be acknowledged as teaching solidly, faithfully and without error that truth which God wanted put into sacred writings for the sake of salvation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html |title=Second Vatican Council, '&amp;#39;Dei Verbum'&amp;#39; (Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation), 11 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PP.HTM |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, 105-108 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It added: "Since God speaks in Sacred Scripture through men in human fashion, the interpreter of Sacred Scripture, in order to see clearly what God wanted to communicate to us, should carefully investigate what meaning the sacred writers really intended, and what God wanted to manifest by means of their words."&lt;ref&gt;''Dei Verbum'', 12&lt;/ref&gt; The Reformed Churches believe in the Bible is inerrant in the sense spoken of by Gregory and Nix and "deny that Biblical infallibility and inerrancy are limited to spiritual, religious, or redemptive themes, exclusive of assertions in the fields of history and science".&lt;ref&gt;Second Helvetic Confession, [http://www.creeds.net/reformed/helvetic/c01.htm ''Of the Holy Scripture Being the True Word of God'']; Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy, [http://www.reformed.org/documents/icbi.html Online text]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] speaks of "the infallible truth and divine authority" of the Scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Confession of Faith Ratification Act 1690]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] treats the [[Old Testament]] as authoritative and says it "cannot be broken" ({{bibleverse||John|10:34–36|ESV}}). [[2 Timothy]] {{bibleverse-nb|2|Timothy|3:16|ESV}} says: "All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness". The [[Second Epistle of Peter]] claims that "no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation. For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the [[Holy Spirit]]" ({{bibleverse|2|Peter|1:20–21|ESV}}). It also speaks of Paul's letters as containing some things "hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures".&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2|Peter|3:15–16|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This letter does not specify "the other Scriptures", nor does the term "all Scripture" in 2 Timothy indicate which writings were or would be breathed out by God and useful for teaching, since it does not preclude later works, such as the [[Book of Revelation]] and the [[Epistles of John]] may have been. The Catholic Church recognizes 73 books as inspired and forming the Bible (46 books of the [[Development of the Old Testament canon|Old Testament]] and 27 books of the [[Development of the New Testament canon|New Testament]]). The most common versions of the Bible that [[Protestant]]s have today consist of 66 of these books. None of the 66 or 73 books gives a list of revealed books.

Theologian and Christian existentialist philosopher [[Paul Johannes Tillich]] (1886–1965), who sought to correlate culture and faith so that "faith need not be unacceptable to contemporary culture and contemporary culture need not be unacceptable to faith", argued that revelation never runs counter to reason (affirming [[Thomas Aquinas]] who said that faith is eminently rational), and that both poles of the subjective human experience are complementary.&lt;ref&gt;Systematic Theology I, by Paul Tillich, University of Chicago Press, 205. 0-226803-37-6. {{cite book|title=Systematic Theology|author=Paul Tillich|page=307|isbn=0-226-80336-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Barth]] argued that God is the object of God’s own self-knowledge, and revelation in the Bible means the self-unveiling to humanity of the God who cannot be discovered by humanity simply through its own efforts. For him, the Bible is not ''The Revelation''; rather, it points to revelation. Human concepts can never be considered as identical to God's revelation, and Scripture is written in human language, expressing human concepts. It cannot be considered identical with God's revelation. However, God does reveal himself through human language and concepts, and thus Christ is truly presented in scripture and the preaching of the church.

====Latter Day Saint movement====
{{Main|Revelation (Latter Day Saints)|Joseph Smith|Prophet, seer, and revelator}}
[[File:Joseph Smith receiving golden plates.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Engraving|An 1893 engraving of [[Joseph Smith]] receiving the [[golden plates]] and other artifacts from the [[angel Moroni]].]]
This denomination believes that the president of the church receives revelation directly from God for the direction of the church. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) and some other [[Latter Day Saint|Latter Day Saint denominations]] claim to be led by revelation from God to a [[prophet, seer, and revelator|living prophet]], who receives God’s word, just as [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], other ancient [[prophet]]s and [[twelve apostles|apostles]] did.

Latter-day Saints believe in an open scriptural canon, and in addition to the [[Bible]] and the [[Book of Mormon]], have books of scripture containing the revelations of modern-day prophets such as the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]. LDS Church leaders (from the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]]) have taught during the church's [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conferences]] that conference talks which are "…[spoken as] moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be scripture…".&lt;ref&gt;Doctrine and Covenants 68:4&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many Mormons believe that ancient prophets in other regions of the world received revelations that resulted in additional scriptures that have been lost and may, one day, be forthcoming. Hence, the belief in [[continuing revelation]]. Latter Day Saints also believe that the [[United States Constitution]] is a divinely inspired document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/ensign/1992/02/the-divinely-inspired-constitution?lang=eng |title=The Divinely Inspired Constitution |author=Dallin H. Oaks |date=Feb 1992 |publisher=''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See'' D&amp;C 101:77–80&lt;/ref&gt;

Mormons sustain the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints as prophet, seer, and revelator—the only person on earth who receives revelation to guide the entire church. They also sustain the two counselors in the First Presidency, as well as the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, as prophets, seers, and revelators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/topics/prophets?lang=eng |title=Prophets |publisher=Lds.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that God has followed a pattern of continued revelation to prophets throughout the history of mankind (KJV Luke 1:70)--both to establish doctrine and maintain its integrity, as well as to guide the church under changing world conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bd/revelation?lang=eng |title=Revelation |publisher=Lds.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this pattern of revelation was broken, it was because the receivers of revelation had been rejected and often killed (Matt 23:31–37, Luke 11:47–51). In the meridian of time, Paul described prophets and apostles in terms of a foundation, with Christ as the cornerstone, which was built to prevent doctrinal shift—"that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about by every wind of doctrine" (Eph 2:20 and 4:11–14, see also Matt 16:17–18). To maintain this foundation, new apostles were chosen and ordained to replace those lost to death or transgression, as when Matthias was called by revelation to replace Judas (Acts 1:15–26). However, as intensifying persecution led to the imprisonment and martyrdom of the apostles, it eventually became impossible to continue the apostolic succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-16-the-church-of-jesus-christ-in-former-times?lang=eng |title=Gospel Principles Chapter 16: The Church of Jesus Christ in Former Times |publisher=Lds.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the foundation of apostles and prophets was lost, the integrity of Christian doctrine as established by Christ and the apostles began to be compromised by those who continued to develop doctrine despite not being called or authorized to receive revelation for the body of the church. In the absence of revelation, these post-apostolic theologians couldn’t help but introduce elements of human reasoning, speculation, and personal interpretation of scripture (2 Pet 1:19–20)—which over time led to the loss or corruption of various doctrinal truths, as well as the addition of new man-made doctrines. This naturally led to much disagreement and schism, which over the centuries culminated in the large number of Christian churches on the earth today. Mormons believe that God resumed his pattern of revelation when the world was again ready, by calling the Prophet Joseph Smith to restore the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-17-the-church-of-jesus-christ-today?lang=eng |title=Gospel Principles Chapter 17: The Church of Jesus Christ Today |publisher=Lds.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time there has been a consistent succession of prophets and apostles, which God has promised will not be broken before the Second Coming of Christ (Dan 2:44).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/topics/church-organization/the-church-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng |title=The Church of Jesus Christ |publisher=Lds.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each member of the LDS Church is also confirmed a member of the church following baptism and given the "gift of the Holy Ghost" by which each member is encouraged to develop a personal relationship with that divine being and receive personal revelation for their own direction and that of their family. The [[Latter Day Saint]] concept of revelation includes the belief that revelation from God is available to all those who earnestly seek it with the intent of doing good. It also teaches that everyone is entitled to ''personal'' revelation with respect to his or her [[stewardship]] (leadership responsibility). Thus, parents may receive inspiration from God in raising their families, individuals can receive divine inspiration to help them meet personal challenges, church officers may receive revelation for those whom they serve, and so forth.

The important consequence of this is that each person may receive confirmation that particular doctrines taught by a prophet are true, as well as gain divine insight in using those truths for their own benefit and eternal progress. In the church, personal revelation is expected and encouraged, and many converts believe that personal revelation from God was instrumental in their conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Continuing Revelation | work=Mormon.org | url=http://www.mormon.org/learn/0,8672,1084-1,00.html | accessdate=August 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph F.

The Qur'an claims to have been revealed word by word and letter by letter.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Muslims hold that the message of Islam is the same as the message preached by all the messengers sent by God to humanity since [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]]. Muslims believe that Islam is the oldest of the monotheistic religions because it represents both the original and the final revelation of God to [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[David]], [[Jesus]], and Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (2002b), pp.4–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|42|13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Muslims believe that every [[prophet]] received revelation in their lives, as each prophet was sent by God to guide mankind. [[Jesus]] is significant in this aspect as he received revelation in a twofold aspect, as Muslims believe he preached the [[Injil|Gospel]] while also having been taught the [[Torah]].

According to Islamic traditions, Muhammad began receiving revelations from the age of 40, delivered through the angel Gabriel over the last 23 years of his life. The content of these revelations, known as the Qur'an,&lt;ref&gt;The term ''Qur'an'' was first used in the Qur'an itself. There are two different theories about this term and its formation that are discussed in [[Quran#Etymology]]&lt;/ref&gt; was memorized and recorded by his followers and compiled from dozens of [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|hafiz]] as well as other various parchments or hides into a single volume shortly after his death. In [[Muslim theology]], Muhammad is considered equal in importance to all other [[Prophets in Islam|prophets of God]] and to make distinction among the prophets is a [[sin]], as the Qur'an itself promulgates equality between God's prophets.(Qur'an 3:84)

Many [[scholar]]s have made the distinction between revelation and [[Biblical inspiration|inspiration]], which according to Muslim theology, all righteous people can receive. Inspiration refers to God inspiring a person to commit some action, as opposed to revelation, which only the prophets received. Moses's mother, [[Jochebed]], being inspired to send the infant Moses in a cradle down the [[Nile river]] is a frequently cited example of inspiration, as is [[Hagar]] searching for water for the infant [[Ishmael]].

===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish principles of faith}}
{{Redirect|Mattan Torah|text=Mattan Torah is "the gift of Torah". For [[Z'man Mattan Torah]] ("the time of the giving of the Torah"), see [[Shavuot]]}}

The term "revelation" is used in two senses in Jewish theology; it either denotes (1) what in rabbinical language is called "Gilluy Shekinah," a manifestation of God by some wondrous act of His which overawes man and impresses him with what he sees, hears, or otherwise perceives of His glorious presence; or it denotes (2) a manifestation of His will through oracular words, signs, statutes, or laws.&lt;ref name=je&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12713-revelation |title="Revelation", Jewish Encyclopedia |publisher=Jewishencyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Judaism]], issues of epistemology have been addressed by [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosophers]] such as [[Saadiah Gaon]] (882–942) in his [[Emunoth ve-Deoth|Book of Beliefs and Opinions]]; [[Maimonides]] (1135–1204) in his [[Guide for the Perplexed]]; [[Hugo Bergmann|Samuel Hugo Berman]], professor of philosophy at the Hebrew University; [[Joseph Dov Soloveitchik]] (1903–1993), talmudic scholar and philosopher; [[Neil Gillman]], professor of philosophy at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], and [[Elliot N. Dorff]], professor of philosophy at the [[American Jewish University]].

One of the major trends in modern Jewish philosophy was the attempt to develop a theory of Judaism through existentialism. One of the primary players in this field was [[Franz Rosenzweig]]. His major work, ''Star of Redemption'', expounds a philosophy in which he portrays the relationships between God, humanity and world as they are connected by creation, revelation and redemption.
Conservative Jewish philosophers [[Elliot N. Dorff]] and [[Neil Gillman]] take the existentialist philosophy of Rosenzweig as one of their starting points for understanding [[Jewish philosophy]]. (They come to different conclusions, however.)

Rabbinic Judaism, and contemporary [[Orthodox Judaism]], hold that the [[Torah]] (Pentateuch) extant today is essentially the same one that the whole of the Jewish people received on [[Mount Sinai]], from God, upon their Exodus from Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Nechemia Coopersmith and Rabbi Moshe Zeldman: [http://www.aish.com/shavuotsinai/shavuotsinaidefault/Did_God_Speak_at_Sinai$_.asp "Did God Speak at Sinai"], Aish HaTorah&lt;/ref&gt; Beliefs that God gave a "Torah of truth" to Moses (and the rest of the people), that Moses was the greatest of the prophets, and that the Law given to Moses will never be changed, are three of the [[Thirteen Principles of Faith]] of Orthodox Judaism according to [[Maimonides]].

Orthodox Judaism believes that in addition to the written Torah, God also revealed to Moses a set of oral teachings, called the [[Oral Torah]]. In addition to this revealed law, [[Halakha|Jewish law]] contains decrees and enactments made by prophets, rabbis, and sages over the course of Jewish history. [[Haredi Judaism]] tends to regard even rabbinic decrees as being of divine origin or divinely inspired, while [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] tends to regard them as being more potentially subject to human error, although due to the Biblical verse "Do not stray from their words" ("Deuteronomy 17:11) it is still accepted as binding law.

[[Conservative Judaism]] tends to regard both the Torah and the Oral law as not verbally revealed. The Conservative approach tends to regard the Torah as compiled by redactors in a manner similar to the [[Documentary Hypothesis]]. However, Conservative Jews also regard the authors of the Torah as divinely inspired, and many regard at least portions of it as originating with Moses. Positions can vary from the position of [[Joel Roth]], following [[David Weiss HaLivni]], that while the Torah originally given to Moses on Mount Sinai became corrupted or lost and had to be recompiled later by redactors, the recompiled Torah is nonetheless regarded as fully Divine and legally authoritative, to the position of [[Gordon Tucker]] that the Torah, while Divinely inspired, is a largely human document containing significant elements of human error, and should be regarded as the beginning of an ongoing process which is continuing today.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Conservative Judaism regards the Oral Law as divinely inspired, but nonetheless subject to human error.

Reform and Reconstructionist Jews also accept the Documentary Hypothesis for the origin of the Torah, and tend to view all of the Oral law as an entirely human creation. [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] believe that the Torah is not a [[direct revelation]] from God, but is a document written by human ancestors, carrying human understanding and experience, and seeking to answer the question: 'What does God require of us?'. They believe that, though it contains many 'core-truths' about God and humanity, it is also time bound. They believe that God's will is revealed through the interaction of humanity and God throughout history, and so, in that sense, Torah is a product of an ongoing revelation. [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] denies the notion of revelation entirely.

====Prophets====
Although the [[Nevi'im]] (the books of the Prophets) are considered divine and true, this does not imply that the books of the prophets are always read literally. Jewish tradition has always held that prophets used metaphors and analogies. There exists a wide range of commentaries explaining and elucidating those verses consisting of metaphor. [[Rabbinic Judaism]] regards Moses as the greatest of the prophets, and this view is one of the [[Thirteen Principles of Faith]] of traditional Judaism. Consistent with the view that revelation to Moses was generally clearer than revelation to other prophets, Orthodox views of revelation to prophets other than Moses have included a range of perspectives as to directness. For example, [[Maimonides]] in ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' said that accounts of revelation in the Nevi'im were not always as literal as in the [[Torah]] and that some prophetic accounts reflect allegories rather than literal commands or predictions.

[[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] [[Rabbi]] and [[Jewish philosophy|philosopher]] [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] (1907–1972), author of a number of works on prophecy, said that, "Prophetic inspiration must be understood ''as an event'', not as ''a process''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Heschel, Abraham Joshua | title=God in Search of Man: A Philosophy of Judaism | publisher=Noonday | year=1955 | isbn=0-374-51331-7 | page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his work ''[[God in Search of Man]]'', he discussed the experience of being a prophet. In his book ''Prophetic Inspiration After the Prophets: Maimonides and Others'', Heschel references to continued prophetic inspiration in Jewish [[rabbinic literature]] following the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] and into medieval and even Modern times. He wrote that

:"To convey what the prophets experienced, the Bible could either use terms of descriptions or terms of indication. Any description of the act of revelation in empirical categories would have produced a caricature. That is why all the Bible does is to state that revelation happened. How it happened is something they could only convey in words that are evocative and suggestive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Heschel, Abraham Joshua | title=God in Search of Man: A Philosophy of Judaism | publisher=ason Aronson Inc. | year=1987 | editor= | isbn=0-87668-955-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent revelations==
[[Miracle of the Sun|The miracle of the Sun]] is probably the best-known revelation of recent times, but while some still consider it to be a genuine miracle, others regard it as a natural phenomenon with a natural explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Lady of Fátima &amp; the Miracle of the Sun|url = http://www.livescience.com/29290-fatima-miracle.html|website = LiveScience.com|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1945 Chicago businessman [[Milton Reynolds]] was in Buenos Aires, Argentina when he came across the first commercialized ballpoint, the [[László Bíró| Biro pen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/ballpoint-pens-laszlo-biro-4078959|title=How Inventor Laszlo Biro Started the Ballpoint Pens Revolution|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1945, Milton Reynolds was able to reverse engineer the Biro pen and was the first to manufacture and sell ballpoint pens into the US market.  "Reynolds Rocket" pen was introduced at Gimbel’s department store in New York City, selling $100,000 worth of pens on the first day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/ballpoint-pens-laszlo-biro-4078959|title=How Inventor Laszlo Biro Started the Ballpoint Pens Revolution|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demand in 1945 was running 30,000 pens per day, making it America's #1 ballpoint pen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/64958/origin-story-ballpoint-pen|title=The Origin Story of the Ballpoint Pen|date=2015-06-10|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, within three years the price of the pen went from $12.50 to 50¢.

The Reynold's Rocket Pen had a tiny ball bearing that only let ink out when pressed against the item you were writing on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4083274/ballpoint-pen/|title=Why the Invention of the Ballpoint Pen Was Such a Big Deal|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In advertisements Reynolds claimed it had enough ink to 15 years without refilling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bittner.com/blog/category/pens/|title=Pens Archives - Bittner Press|website=Bittner Press|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947 in a publicity stunt to promote Reynolds' pens Milton Reynolds and William Odom announced they would beat Howard Hughes' around the world record. They set a new record time of under 79 hours by flying the "Reynolds Bombshell" around the world while managing to pass our thousands of pens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/01/25/archives/saw-pens-potential-hailed-by-truman.html|title=Saw Pen's Potential|last=Saxon|first=Wolfgang|date=1976|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948 Reynolds expanded overseas and opened Reynolds European, and later in 1959 spun out Reynolds European SA as an independent company focused on non-ferrous metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://reynolds-european.fr/EN/?page_id=22|title=History - Reynolds European|work=Reynolds European|access-date=2018-04-02|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicago-based Reynolds Pen company closed with Milton Reynolds moving to Mexico . The French subsidiary survived as did their India licensee. Later the French subsidiary would be purchased.

In 2000 Newell Rubbermaid acquired [[:fr:Reynolds International Pen Company|Reynold Pens France]] and in 2007 announced they would be closing the French manufacturing plants, causing huge labor union protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=reynoldsfrance|title=REYNOLDS  writing instruments France. Delocalization|date=2007-01-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fq_9PYe-wQ|accessdate=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016 Reynold's license GM Pens International in India decided to end their exclusive contract and stopped making Reynold branded pens, instead choosing to make their own Rorito brand pen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/business-of-brands/reynolds-pens-indian-licensee-to-go-solo-with-launch-of-rorito-brand/52182932|title=Reynolds Pens' Indian licensee to go solo with launch of Rorito brand - ET BrandEquity|last=www.ETBrandEquity.com|website=ETBrandEquity.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reynold Pens, along with Paper Mate and Parker are brands owned by US based [[Newell Brands]] and are sold in more than 70 countries.

It is being created by the Institute of Russian language, [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].

It currently contains more than 600 million word forms&lt;ref&gt;http://ruscorpora.ru/&lt;/ref&gt; that are automatically lemmatized and [[Part of speech|POS]]-/grammeme-tagged, i. e. all the possible morphological analyses for each orthographic form are ascribed to it. Lemmata, POS, grammatical items and their combinations are searchable. Additionally, 6 million word forms are in the subcorpus with manually resolved [[homonymy]]. &lt;!---A statistical program that resolves homonymy using the manually tagged corpus as a [[machine-learning tool]] is already constructed and the results will be made available online soon.---&gt;

The subcorpus with resolved morphological [[homonymy]] is also automatically [[stress (linguistics)|accent]]uated. The whole corpus has a searchable tagging concerning [[lexical semantics]] (LS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Apresjan | first1 = Ju. | last2 = Boguslavsky | first2 = I. | last3 = Iomdin | first3 = B. | last4 = Iomdin | first4 = L. | last5 = Sannikov | first5 = A. | last6 = Sizov | first6 = V. | year = 2006 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.111.8165 | title = A Syntactically and Semantically Tagged Corpus of Russian: State of the Art and Prospects | conference = Proceedings of LREC | location = Genova, Italy | pages = 1378–1381 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including morphosemantic POS subclasses (proper noun, reflexive pronoun etc.), LS characteristics proper (thematic class, causativity, evaluation), derivation (diminutive, adverb formed from adjective etc.).

The  RNC includes also the following subcorpora:
*a [[treebank]] of [[syntax|syntactical]] dependencies (largely based on the [[Igor Mel'čuk]]'s [[Meaning-Text Theory]])
*English⇔Russian, German⇒Russian, Ukrainian⇔Russian and Belorussian⇔Russian [[parallel corpus|parallel corpora]];
*a large (100+ million words) separate corpus of modern newspapers (2001–2011);
*a corpus of Russian [[poetry]], where the rhyming words and poetic [[Prosody (poetry)|prosody]] (including meter, stanzas etc.) is additionally tagged;
*a corpus of Russian [[dialect]]s with specific dialect grammar tagging;
*a multimedia corpus with searchable tagged fragments of Russian-language movies;
*a corpus showing the history of Russian [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]]
*an educational subcorpus reflecting school standards.

All the texts have tags bearing metatextual information - the author, his/her birth date, creation date, text size, text genres (general fiction, detective story, newspaper article etc.); all these categories are browsable and searchable separately. It is possible to define a user's subcorpus to search  lemmata/POS-grammeme/semantic tags combinations only within this subset.

'''Sallaans''' ([[Standard Dutch|Dutch]]: ''Sallands'') is a collective term for the [[Dutch Low Saxon]] [[dialect]]s of the region [[Salland]], in the eastern [[Netherlands]]. A common term used by native speakers for their dialect, which is also used by Low Saxon speakers from other regions for their respective dialects, is ''plat'' or simply ''dialect''. Yet another common usage is to refer to the language by the name of the local variety, where for instance ''Dal(f)sens'' would be the name for the Sallaans variety spoken in the village of [[Dalfsen]]. Sallands is more influenced by the Hollandse dialects than [[Twents]] or [[Achterhoeks]]. This influence is called the [[Hollandse expansie]]. For example, house is in [[Twente]] hoes but in Salland it is huus. The Hollandse dialects of the 17th century still had uu sounds in their vocabulary, and this uu sounds came in Sallands.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2014">'''Scyphate''' is a term frequently used in [[numismatics]] to refer to the [[wikt:concave|concave]] or "cup-shaped" [[Byzantine coins]] of the 11th–14th centuries. 

This usage emerged in the 19th century, when the term ''scyphatus'', attested in [[Southern Italy|south Italian]] documents of the 11th and 12th centuries, was erroneously interpreted as deriving from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''skyphos'' (σκύφος, "cup"). In reality, the term probably derives from the [[Arabic]] word ''shafah'', "edge, rim", and refers to the distinctive and conspicuous border of the early ''[[histamenon|histamena]]'' gold coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grierson|1999|p=59}}; {{harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|p=1857}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this misunderstanding, the term "scyphate" has been widely applied to the concave [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[copper]] coins of the late [[Byzantine Empire]] and the foreign issues imitating it. These coins are more properly designated as ''trachea'' (singular: ''trachy'', from Greek τραχύ, "rough, uneven").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|pp=1857, 2101}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual slang''' is a set of [[linguistics|linguistic]] terms and phrases used to refer to sexual organs, processes, and activities;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=421|author1=Richard Guy Parker |author2=Peter Aggleton |title=Culture, Society and Sexuality: A Reader |isbn=978-1-85728-811-7|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are generally considered [[colloquialism|colloquial]] rather than formal or medical, and some may be seen as impolite or improper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=176–177|author=Timothy Jay|title=Why We Curse: A Neuro-Psycho-Social Theory of Speech|publisher=[[John Benjamins Publishing Company]]|year=2000|isbn=978-1-55619-758-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to sexual slang is slang related to [[defecation]] and [[flatulence]] ([[toilet humor]], [[scatolinguistics]]). References to the [[anal tract]] are often given a sexual connotation in the context of [[anal sex]] (in particular, in a context of male homosexuality).

While popular usage is incredibly versatile in coining ever new short-lived synonyms, old terms with originally no pejorative colouring may come to be considered inappropriate over time. Thus, terms like ''[[Buttocks|arse]]/[[wikt:ass|ass]]'', ''[[cunt]],'' ''[[wikt:cock|cock]]'' and ''[[fuck]]'' should not be considered "[[slang]]," since they are the inherited common English terms for their referents, but they are often considered [[vulgarism]]s and are replaced by [[euphemism]]s or scientific terminology in "polite" language.

==Pejorative usage==
{{main|Sexual slur}}
[[Term of disparagement|Terms of disparagement]] are used to refer to members of a given [[minority group|sexual minority]], [[gender]], [[sex]], or [[sexual orientation]] in a derogatory or pejorative manner. They are used as insults by persons who are not or do not wish to be associated with the group being disparaged. For example, ''[[queer]]'' can be used as an insult by those seeking to deprecate [[homosexual]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] or [[transsexual]] people, but the word has also undergone [[reclaiming]], such that it can be used positively within that community. Which terms are used as slurs is determined by a society's or subculture's set of values, especially its biases against genders ([[sexism]]). For example, words such as ''[[whore]]'' and ''[[slut]]'' are typically used to refer to [[Female promiscuity|sexually promiscuous women]].
 
[[Sexual slur]]s are common across many cultures and historical periods. The most common slurs directed against men historically include accusations of being a passive homosexual ([[Aristophanes]] notably enjoyed using such allusions) or of being [[effeminate]]; for example, in the [[Hittite military oath]], oath-breakers are threatened with being made into women (a promise of either actual [[castration]], or of divine revenge on the traitors' manhood).
The pejorative term [[Prick (slang)|prick]] for a contemptible person is  also usually used for men. &lt;ref&gt;Terry Victor, Tom Dalzell, ''The Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English'',  Routledge, Nov 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual slang and humor ==
In the popular [[wikt:jargon|jargon]] of many [[culture]]s, the use of sexual slang is a form of [[humor]] or [[euphemism]] that often creates controversy over its public use. Sexual humor has been seen in many circles as crude and unsophisticated, as well as insulting towards the subject it describes. Sexual slang has a long history in literature and comedy: examples from Shakespeare are well-known. The popularity of contemporary [[comedian]]s who indulge in sexual humor, from [[George Carlin]] to [[Andrew Dice Clay]], reflects the appeal of this form of speech. It is often seen as a form of [[taboo]], in which much of the appeal lies in the shock value of daring to speak "forbidden" words in public.

Smt. '''Sundri Uttamchandani''' (28 September 1924 – 8 July 2013) was a noted Indian writer. She wrote mostly in [[Sindhi language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tunio |first=Hafeez |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/574401/sundri-uttamchandani-noted-sindhi-fiction-writer-passes-away/ |title=Sundri Uttamchandani: Noted Sindhi fiction writer passes away – The Express Tribune |publisher=Tribune.com.pk |accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was married to progressive writer A. J. Uttam.

In 1986 she was awarded the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] by [[Sahitya Akademi]] in Sindhi for her Book ''Vichhoro'', a compilation of nine short stories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesindhuworld.com/academy_awards.html Sahitya Academy Awards in Sindhi] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717030858/http://www.thesindhuworld.com/academy_awards.html |date=17 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lal |first= Mohan |author2=Amaresh Datta |title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: Sasay-Zorgot (Volume 5)|year=1992|publisher=[[Sahitya Akademi]]|page=4558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Sundri Uttamchandani was born on 28 September 1924 at [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] [[Sindh]] (now in Pakistan). Hydrabad was the capital of Sindh before the conquest of Sindh by the British. Though it lost its position as a capital city but, it continued to be a thriving centre of education literature and culture. All reform movements were rooted in its soil. At the very young age, Sundri was exposed to a vast repertoire of folk and mythological tales which were narrated by her parents to her and other children of the extended joint family. During her youth the freedom movement was sweeping across the country and she could not but be drawn to it. While still in college she translated a story "Bhadur Maao Ji Bahadur Deeah" (A brave daughter of a brave mother). This was her initiation in the literary field.

She married Assandas Uttamchandani (A.J.Uttam), a Freedom fighter, with a keen interest in Sindhi Literature with clear leanings toward Marxist Philosophy and, who become in the later years one of the leading writers of Sindhi progressive literary movement, A J Uttam, was one of the founders of Sindhi Sahit Mandal in Bombay. Sundri accompanied him to weekly literary meetings which were presided over by a fatherly figure, Prof M U Malkani, who was a fountain head of encouragement to new and upcoming writers. &lt;br /&gt;This exposure to Sindhi writers and their creative works were to become source of inspiration for her and in the year 1953 she produced her first novel "Kirandar Deewaroon" (Crumbling walls). This proved to be path breaking. She shattered the near monopoly of male domination in literature by her one feat, while on the one hand, she won the accolades and acclaim of all senior writers for use of 'homely' language, a folksy- idiomatic language used by women folk in their household and thus brought in a new literary flavour in Sindhi literature. The theme and structure of the novel was mature and it has distinction of being reprinted many times over. This Novel was translated into many Indian languages and brought her acclaim by literary critics of those languages, thus elevating her from a writer of a regional language to a writer of All India fame. Her Second Novel "Preet Purani Reet Niraali" came in the year 1956, which has run into 5 reprints, which amply speaks of its merit and popularity.

Apart from her path breaking novels, it is in short story form in which she found herself more comfortable.  She has collections of short stories to her credit some of which have gone into various reprints. Some of her short stories have become water mark in this genre and are often cited as outstanding examples.

Her Story" Bhoori" (A doll) brings out in stark relief the beauty of yester years, who due to ravages of partition of the country has lost her enchanting looks but is radiant with inner beauty born out of [[dignity of labour]] and assured demeanor to shoulder economic responsibilities to feed her family, thus standing shoulder to shoulder with her husband, ushering in gender equality without being sounding stirringly feminist.Her first story 'Mamta' against the war won her first prize in 1952 in a short story competition. 'Koshan' was another story which also appreciated and received first prize in 1954 from Kahani Magazine.In early sixties a Publisher of 'KAHANI' magazine had organised a short story competition in which many stalwarts of the time participated and Sundri's short story "KHEER BARIYA HATHRA" won the first prize. This was story published in a book titled as "KHEER BARIYA HATHRA" 1960 by KAHANI. Her story "HI SHAHAR" (This City) is everlasting portrayal of a meek Nepali watchman in a lower middle class apartment building in this city as a vast ruthless and soul less machine, unmindful of the personal loss or tragedy. 
Sundri has tried her hand at traditional poetry with proper meter but it is in free verse where she has found her niche. She has four poetry collections to her credit. Her poems delve deep into subtle and delicate gamut of emotions and find artistic and imaginative articulation with her individual stamp.

Apart from winning many awards throughout her vast and eventful literary career, she was bestowed prestigious [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] for her Book "Vichhoro" in the year 1986.

As a part of Progressive Writers' movement she has written on erstwhile Soviet Union, "NAEEN SABHYATA Jo DARSHAN' and Bharat Roos ba Banh Beli (India Russia two comrades in arms) for which she won '''The coveted Soviet Land Award'''.  She has inspired many women writers to contribute to Sindhi literature and will continue to inspire future generations.

==Literary career==
Started writing in the year 1946. She has written 200 Short Stories, 2 Novels, 12 one act plays, Approx. 500 essays 200 poems. Has translated many novels, short stories and poems of renowned writers viz. Amrita Pritam, Maxim Gorky, Krishanchandra, Sholokhav etc.

==Noun classes {{anchor|Noun classes}}==
Like other [[Bantu languages]], Tetela [[grammar]] arranges nouns into a number of [[noun class|classes]]. The ancestral system had 22 classes (counting singular and plural as distinct according to the [[Carl Meinhof|Meinhof system]]), with most Bantu languages sharing at least ten of them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30968">A '''translation memory''' ('''TM''') is a database that stores "segments", which can be sentences, paragraphs or sentence-like units (headings, titles or elements in a list) that have previously been translated, in order to aid human [[Translation|translators]]. The translation memory stores the [[source text]] and its corresponding translation in language pairs called “translation units”. Individual words are handled by terminology bases and are not within the domain of TM.

Software programs that use translation memories are sometimes known as '''translation memory managers''' ('''TMM''') or '''translation memory systems''' ('''TM systems''', not to be confused with a [[Translation management system]] ('''TMS'''), which is another type of software focused on managing process of translation).

Translation memories are typically used in conjunction with a dedicated [[computer assisted translation]] (CAT) tool, [[wordprocessor|word processing]] program, [[terminology management systems]], multilingual dictionary, or even raw [[machine translation]] output.

Research indicates that many [[language industry|companies producing multilingual documentation]] are using translation memory systems. In a survey of language professionals in 2006, 82.5% out of 874 replies confirmed the use of a TM.&lt;ref name="survey"/&gt; Usage of TM correlated with text type characterised by technical terms and simple sentence structure (technical, to a lesser degree marketing and financial), computing skills, and repetitiveness of content.&lt;ref name="survey"&gt;Elina Lagoudaki (2006), "Translation Memory systems: Enlightening users' perspective. Key finding of the TM Survey 2006 carried out during July and August 2006. (Imperial College London, Translation Memories Survey 2006), p.16 {{cite web |url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/portal/pls/portallive/docs/1/7307707.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325114619/http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/portal/pls/portallive/docs/1/7307707.PDF |archivedate=2007-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Using translation memories ==
The program breaks the '''[[source text]]''' (the text to be translated) into segments, looks for matches between segments and the source half of previously translated source-target pairs stored in a '''translation memory''', and presents such matching pairs as translation '''candidates'''. The translator can accept a candidate, replace it with a fresh translation, or modify it to match the source. In the last two cases, the new or modified translation goes into the database.

Some translation memory systems search for 100% matches only, that is to say that they can only retrieve segments of text that match entries in the database exactly, while others employ [[Fuzzy string searching|fuzzy matching]] algorithms to retrieve similar segments, which are presented to the translator with differences flagged. It is important to note that typical translation memory systems only search for text in the source segment.

The flexibility and robustness of the matching algorithm largely determine the performance of the translation memory, although for some applications the recall rate of exact matches can be high enough to justify the 100%-match approach.

Segments where no match is found will have to be translated by the translator manually. These newly translated segments are stored in the database where they can be used for future translations as well as repetitions of that segment in the current text.

Translation memories work best on texts which are highly repetitive, such as technical manuals. They are also helpful for translating incremental changes in a previously translated document, corresponding, for example, to minor changes in a new version of a user manual. Traditionally, translation memories have not been considered appropriate for literary or creative texts, for the simple reason that there is so little repetition in the language used. However, others find them of value even for non-repetitive texts, because the database resources created have value for concordance searches to determine appropriate usage of terms, for quality assurance (no empty segments), and the simplification of the review process (source and target segment are always displayed together while translators have to work with two documents in a traditional review environment).

If a translation memory system is used consistently on appropriate texts over a period of time, it can save translators considerable work. Enterprises that employ translators to work on corporate translations can also save significant resources as a result of using a translation memory system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=15 Best Translation Management System Features |url=https://www.pairaphrase.com/15-best-translation-management-system-features/ |website=Pairaphrase |publisher=Cloud Translation Blog |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Main benefits ===
Translation memory managers are most suitable for translating technical documentation and documents containing specialized vocabularies. Their benefits include:

* Ensuring that the document is completely translated (translation memories do not accept empty target segments)
* Ensuring that the translated documents are consistent, including common definitions, phrasings and terminology. This is important when different translators are working on a single project.
* Enabling translators to translate documents in a wide variety of formats without having to own the software typically required to process these formats.
* Accelerating the overall translation process; since translation memories "remember" previously translated material, translators have to translate it only once.
* Reducing costs of long-term translation projects; for example the text of manuals, warning messages or series of documents needs to be translated only once and can be used several times.
* For large documentation projects, savings (in time or money) thanks to the use of a TM package may already be apparent even for the first translation of a new project, but normally such savings are only apparent when translating subsequent versions of a project that was translated before using translation memory.

=== Main obstacles ===
{{cite-section|date=April 2018}}
The main problems hindering wider use of translation memory managers include:

* The concept of "translation memories" is based on the premise that sentences used in previous translations can be "recycled". However, a guiding principle of translation is that the translator must translate the ''message'' of the text, and not its component ''[[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]]''.
* Translation memory managers do not easily fit into existing translation or localization processes. In order to take advantage of TM technology, the [[translation process]]es must be redesigned.
* Translation memory managers do not presently support all documentation formats, and filters may not exist to support all file types.
* There is a learning curve associated with using translation memory managers, and the programs must be customized for greatest effectiveness.
* In cases where all or part of the translation process is outsourced or handled by freelance translators working off-site, the off-site workers require special tools to be able to work with the texts generated by the translation memory manager.
* Full versions of many translation memory managers can cost from [[US dollar|US$]]500 to US$2,500 per seat, which can represent a considerable investment (although lower cost programs are also available). However, some developers produce free or low-cost versions of their tools with reduced feature sets that individual translators can use to work on projects set up with full versions of those tools. (Note that there are freeware and shareware TM packages available, but none of these has yet gained a large market share.)
* The costs involved in importing the user's past translations into the translation memory database, training, as well as any add-on products may also represent a considerable investment.
* Maintenance of translation memory databases still tends to be a manual process in most cases, and failure to maintain them can result in significantly decreased usability and quality of TM matches.
* As stated previously, translation memory managers may not be suitable for text that lacks internal repetition or which does not contain unchanged portions between revisions. Technical text is generally best suited for translation memory, while marketing or creative texts will be less suitable.

=== Effects on quality ===
The use of TM systems might have an effect on the quality of the texts translated. Its main effect is clearly related to the so-called "error propagation": if the translation for a particular segment is incorrect, it is in fact more likely that the incorrect translation will be reused the next time the same [[source text]], or a similar [[source text]], is translated, thereby perpetuating the error.Traditionally, two main effects on the quality of translated texts have been described: the "sentence-salad" effect (Bédard 2000; cited in O’Hagan 2009: 50) and the "peep-hole" effect (Heyn 1998). The first refers to a lack of coherence at the text level when a text is translated using sentences from a TM which have been translated by different translators with different styles. According to the latter, translators may adapt their style to the use of TM system in order for these not to contain intratextual references, so that the segments can be better reused in future texts, thus affecting cohesion and readability (O'Hagan 2009).

There is a potential, and, if present, probably an unconscious effect on the translated text. Different languages use different sequences for the logical elements within a sentence and a translator presented with a multiple clause sentence that is half translated is less likely to completely rebuild a sentence. Consistent empirical evidences (Martín-Mor 2011) show that translators will most likely modify the structure of a multiple clause sentence when working with a text processor rather than with a TM system.

There is also a potential for the translator to deal with the text mechanically sentence-by-sentence, instead of focusing on how each sentence relates to those around it and to the text as a whole. Researchers (Dragsted 2004) have identified this effect, which relates to the Automatic Segmentation feature of these programs, but it does not necessarily have a negative effect on the quality of translations.

Note that these effects are closely related to training rather than inherent to the tool. According to Martín-Mor (2011), the use of TM systems does have an effect on the quality of the translated texts, especially on novices, but experienced translators are able to avoid it. Pym (2013) reminds that "translators using TM/MT tend to revise each segment as they go along, allowing little time for a final revision of the whole text at the end", which might in fact be the ultimate cause of some of the effects described here.

==Types of translation-memory systems==
* '''Desktop:''' Desktop translation memory tools are typically what individual translators use to complete translations. They are programs that a freelance translator downloads and installs on his/her desktop computer.
* '''Server-based or Centralised:''' Centralized translation memory systems store TM on a central server. They work together with desktop TM and can increase TM match rates by 30–60% more than the TM leverage attained by desktop TM alone.

==Functions==
The following is a summary of the main functions of a translation memory.

=== Off-line functions ===

==== Import ====
This function is used to transfer a text and its translation from a text file to the TM. [[Data transformation|Import]] can be done from a ''raw format'', in which an external [[source text]] is available for importing into a TM along with its translation. Sometimes the texts have to be reprocessed by the user. There is another format that can be used to import: the ''native format''. This format is the one that uses the TM to save translation memories in a file.

==== Analysis ====
The process of analysis involves the following steps:
;Textual parsing
: It is very important to recognize punctuation correctly in order to distinguish between for example a full stop at the end of a sentence and a full stop in an abbreviation. Thus, mark-up is a kind of pre-editing. Usually, materials which have been processed through translators' aid programs contain mark-up, as the translation stage is embedded in a multilingual document production line. Other special text elements may be set off by mark-up. There are special elements which do not need to be translated, such as proper names and codes, while others may need to be converted to native format.
;Linguistic parsing
: The base form reduction is used to prepare lists of words and a text for automatic retrieval of terms from a term bank. On the other hand, syntactic parsing may be used to extract multi-word terms or phraseology from a [[source text]]. So parsing is used to normalise word order variation of phraseology, this is which words can form a phrase.
;Segmentation
: Its purpose is to choose the most useful translation units. Segmentation is like a type of parsing. It is done monolingually using superficial parsing and alignment is based on segmentation. If the translators correct the segmentations manually, later versions of the document will not find matches against the TM based on the corrected segmentation because the program will repeat its own errors. Translators usually proceed sentence by sentence, although the translation of one sentence may depend on the translation of the surrounding ones.
;Alignment
: It is the task of defining translation correspondences between source and target texts. There should be feedback from alignment to segmentation and a good alignment algorithm should be able to correct initial segmentation.
;[[Term extraction]]
: It can have as input a previous dictionary. Moreover, when extracting unknown terms, it can use parsing based on text statistics. These are used to estimate the amount of work involved in a translation job. This is very useful for planning and scheduling the work. Translation statistics usually count the words and estimate the amount of repetition in the text.

==== Export ====
Export transfers the text from the TM into an external text file. Import and export should be inverses.

=== Online functions ===
When translating, one of the main purposes of the TM is to retrieve the most useful matches in the memory so that the translator can choose the best one. The TM must show both the source and target text pointing out the identities and differences.

==== Retrieval ====
Several different types of matches can be retrieved from a TM.

;Exact match: Exact matches appear when the match between the current source segment and the stored one is a character by character match. When translating a sentence, an exact match means the same sentence has been translated before. Exact matches are also called "100 % matches".
;In-Context Exact (ICE) match or Guaranteed Match: An ICE match is an exact match that occurs in exactly the same context, that is, the same location in a paragraph. Context is often defined by the surrounding sentences and attributes such as document file name, date, and permissions.
;Fuzzy match: When the match is not exact, it is a "fuzzy" match. Some systems assign percentages to these kinds of matches, in which case a fuzzy match is greater than 0% and less than 100%. Those figures are not comparable across systems unless the method of scoring is specified.
;Concordance: When the translator selects one or more words in the source segment, the system retrieves segment pairs that match the search criteria. This feature is helpful for finding translations of terms and idioms in the absence of a [[terminology database]].

==== Updating ====
A TM is updated with a new translation when it has been accepted by the translator. As always in updating a database, there is the question what to do with the previous contents of the database. A TM can be modified by changing or deleting entries in the TM. Some systems allow translators to save multiple translations of the same source segment.

==== Automatic translation ====
Translation memory tools often provide automatic retrieval and substitution.

;Automatic retrieval: TM systems are searched and their results displayed automatically as a translator moves through a document.
;Automatic substitution: With automatic substitution, if an exact match comes up in translating a new version of a document, the software will repeat the old translation. If the translator does not check the translation against the source, a mistake in the previous translation will be repeated.

==== Networking ====
Networking enables a group of translators to translate a text together faster than if each was working in isolation, because sentences and phrases translated by one translator are available to the others. Moreover, if translation memories are shared before the final translation, there is an opportunity for mistakes by one translator to be corrected by other team members.

=== Text memory ===
"Text memory" is the basis of the proposed Lisa OSCAR xml:tm standard.  Text memory comprises author memory and translation memory.

==== Translation memory ====

The unique identifiers are remembered during translation so that the target language document is 'exactly' aligned at the text unit level. If the source document is subsequently modified, then those text units that have not changed can be directly transferred to the new target version of the document without the need for any translator interaction. This is the concept of 'exact' or 'perfect' matching to the translation memory.  xml:tm can also provide mechanisms for in-document leveraged and fuzzy matching.

==History==
1970s is the infancy stage for TM systems in which scholars carried on a preliminary round of exploratory discussions. The original idea for TM systems is often attributed{{whom|date=April 2018}} to Martin Kay's "Proper Place" paper{{citation-needed|date=April 2018}}, but the details of it are not fully given. In this paper, it has shown the basic concept of the storing system: "The translator might start by issuing a command causing the system to display anything in the store that might be relevant to .... Before going on, he can examine past and future fragments of text that contain similar material". This observation from Kay was actually influenced by the suggestion of Peter Arthern that translators can use similar, already translated documents online. In his 1978 article{{citation-needed|date=April 2018}} he gave fully demonstration of what we call TM systems today: Any new text would be typed into a word processing station, and as it was being typed, the system would check this text against the earlier texts stored in its memory, together with its translation into all the other official languages [of the European Community]. ... One advantage over machine translation proper would be that all the passages so retrieved would be grammatically correct. In effect, we should be operating an electronic 'cut and stick' process which would, according to my calculations, save at least 15 per cent of the time which translators now employ in effectively producing translations.

The idea was incorporated from ALPS(Automated Language Processing Systems) Tools first developed by researcher from Brigham Young University, and at that time the idea of TM systems was mixed with a tool call "Repetitions Processing" which only aimed to find matched strings. Only after a long time, did the concept of so-called translation memory come into being.

The real exploratory stage of TM systems would be 1980s. One of the first implementation of TM system appeared in Sadler and Vendelmans' Bilingual Knowledge Bank. A Bilingual Knowledge Bank is a syntactically and referentially structured  pair of corpora, one being a translation of the other, in which translation units are  cross-coded between the corpora. The aim of Bilingual Knowledge Bank is to develop a corpus-based general-purpose knowledge source for applications in  machine translation and computer-aided translation (Sadler &amp; Vendelman, 1987). Another important step was made by Brian Harris with his "Bi-text". He has defined the bi-text as "a single text in two dimensions" (1988), the source and target texts related by the activity of the translator through translation units which made a similar echoes with Sadler's Bilingual Knowledge Bank. And in Harris's work he proposed something like TM system without using this name: a database of paired translations, searchable either by individual word, or by "whole translation unit", in the latter case the search being allowed to retrieve similar rather than identical units.

TM technology only became commercially available on a wide scale in the late 1990s, so the efforts made by several engineers and translators. Of note is the first TM tool called Trados ([[Trados|SDL Trados]] nowadays). In this tool, when opening the source file and applying the translation memory so that any "100% matches" (identical matches) or "fuzzy matches" (similar, but not identical matches) within the text are instantly extracted and placed within the target file. Then, the "matches" suggested by the translation memory can be either accepted or overridden with new alternatives. If a translation unit is manually updated, then it is stored within the translation memory for future use as well as for repetition in the current text. In a similar way, all segments in the target file without a "match" would be translated manually and then automatically added to the translation memory. 

In the 2000s, online translation services began incorporating TM. Machine translation services like [[Google Translate]], as well as professional and "hybrid" translation services provided by sites like [[Gengo]] and [[Translation Cloud#Ackuna|Ackuna]], incorporate databases of TM data supplied by translators and volunteers to make more efficient connections between languages provide faster translation services to end-users.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/22/googles-ai-translation-tool-seems-to-have-invented-its-own-secret-internal-language/ Google's AI translation tool seems to have invented its own secret internal language] Devin Coldewey, TechCrunch, November 22, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent trends==
One recent development is the concept of 'text memory' in contrast to translation memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/01/07/xmltm.html Translating XML Documents with xml:tm]&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the basis of the proposed LISA OSCAR standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/01/07/xmltm.html xml:tm]&lt;/ref&gt; Text memory within xml:tm comprises 'author memory' and 'translation memory'. Author memory is used to keep track of changes during the authoring cycle. Translation memory uses the information from author memory to implement translation memory matching. Although primarily targeted at XML documents, xml:tm can be used on any document that can be converted to XLIFF&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=xliff XLIFF]&lt;/ref&gt; format.

===Second-generation translation memories===
Much more powerful than first-generation TM systems, they include a [[linguistic analysis]] engine, use chunk technology to break down segments into intelligent terminological groups, and automatically generate specific glossaries.

==Related standards==

===TMX===
'''[[Translation Memory eXchange]]''' (TMX) is a standard that enables the interchange of translation memories between translation suppliers. TMX has been adopted by the translation community as the best way of importing and exporting translation memories{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. The current version is 1.4b - it allows for the recreation of the original source and target documents from the TMX data.

===TBX===
'''[[TermBase eXchange]]'''. This [[Localization Industry Standards Association|LISA]] standard, which was revised and republished as ISO 30042, allows for the interchange of terminology data including detailed lexical information. The framework for TBX is provided by three ISO standards: [[ISO 12620]], ISO 12200 and ISO 16642. [[ISO 12620]] provides an inventory of well-defined “data categories” with standardized names that function as data element types or as predefined values. ISO 12200 (also known as MARTIF) provides the basis for the core structure of TBX. ISO 16642 (also known as Terminological Markup Framework) includes a structural meta-model for Terminology Markup Languages in general.

===UTX===
'''[[Universal Terminology eXchange]]''' (UTX) format is a standard specifically designed to be used for user dictionaries of [[machine translation]], but it can be used for general, human-readable glossaries. The purpose of UTX is to accelerate dictionary sharing and reuse by its extremely simple and practical specification.

===SRX===
'''[[Segmentation Rules eXchange]]''' (SRX) is intended to enhance the TMX standard so that translation memory data that is exchanged between applications can be used more effectively. The ability to specify the segmentation rules that were used in the previous translation may increase the leveraging that can be achieved.

===GMX===
'''GILT Metrics'''. GILT stands for (Globalization, Internationalization, Localization, and Translation). The GILT Metrics standard comprises three parts: GMX-V for volume metrics, GMX-C for complexity metrics and GMX-Q for quality metrics. The proposed GILT Metrics standard is tasked with quantifying the workload and quality requirements for any given GILT task.

===OLIF===
'''Open Lexicon Interchange Format'''. OLIF is an open, XML-compliant standard for the exchange of terminological and lexical data. Although originally intended as a means for the exchange of lexical data between proprietary machine translation lexicons, it has evolved into a more general standard for terminology exchange.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olif.net/ Open Lexicon Interchange Format]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;span id="anchor_xliff"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

===XLIFF===
'''[[XLIFF|XML Localisation Interchange File Format]]''' (XLIFF) is intended to provide a single interchange file format that can be understood by any localization provider. [[XLIFF]] is the preferred way{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} of exchanging data in XML format in the translation industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=xliff XML Localisation Interchange File Format]
&lt;/ref&gt;

===TransWS===
'''Translation Web Services'''. TransWS specifies the calls needed to use Web services for the submission and retrieval of files and messages relating to localization projects. It is intended as a detailed framework for the automation of much of the current localization process by the use of Web Services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=trans-ws Translation Web Services]&lt;/ref&gt;

===xml:tm===
{{Main article|xml:tm}}
The xml:tm (XML-based Text Memory) approach to translation memory is based on the concept of text memory which comprises author and translation memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OAXAL—What is it and why should I care|url=http://www.infomanagementcenter.com/enewsletter/200808/second.htm|work=CIDM Information Management News|accessdate=March 30, 2013|author=Andrzej Zydroń|date=August 2008|quote=At the core of xml:tm are the following concepts which together make up 'Text Memory': Author Memory and Translation Memory.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517222230/http://www.infomanagementcenter.com/enewsletter/200808/second.htm|archive-date=May 17, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;   xml:tm has been donated to Lisa OSCAR by XML-INTL.

===PO===
[[Gettext| Gettext Portable Object format]]. Though often not regarded as a translation memory format, Gettext PO files are bilingual files that are also used in translation memory processes in the same way translation memories are used.  Typically, a PO translation memory system will consist of various separate files in a directory tree structure.  Common tools that work with PO files include the [[GNU Gettext]] Tools and the [[Translate Toolkit]].  Several tools and programs also exist that edit PO files as if they are mere [[source text]] files.

{{Sociolinguistics}}
In [[sociolinguistics]] a '''variety''', also called a '''lect''', is a specific form of a [[language]] or [[language cluster]]. This may include [[language]]s, [[dialect]]s, [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]], [[Stylistics (linguistics)|styles]], or other forms of language, as well as a [[standard language|standard]] variety.&lt;ref name=MeechamReesMiller&gt;Meecham, Marjorie and Janie Rees-Miller. (2001) "Language in social contexts." In W. O'Grady, J. Archibald, M. Aronoff and J. Rees-Miller (eds) ''Contemporary Linguistics''. pp. 537-590. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the word "variety" to refer to the different forms avoids the use of the term ''language'', which many people associate only with the standard language, and the term ''dialect'', which is often associated with non-standard varieties thought of as less prestigious or "correct" than the standard.&lt;ref name=Schilling-Estes&gt;Schilling-Estes, Natalies. (2006) "Dialect variation." In R.W. Fasold and J. Connor-Linton (eds) ''An Introduction to Language and Linguistics''. pp. 311-341. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguists speak of both standard and non-standard varieties. "Lect" avoids the problem in ambiguous cases of deciding whether two varieties are distinct languages or dialects of a single language.

Variation at the level of the [[lexicon]], such as [[slang]] and [[argot]], is often considered in relation to particular styles or levels of formality (also called registers), but such uses are sometimes discussed as varieties as well.&lt;ref name=MeechamReesMiller/&gt;

==Dialects==
{{main|Dialect}}
O'Grady et al. define ''dialect'': "A regional or social variety of a language characterized by its own [[Phonology|phonological]], [[Syntax|syntactic]], and [[Lexicon|lexical]] properties."&lt;ref name=ContempLx&gt;O'Grady, William, John Archibald, Mark Aronoff, and Jane Rees-Miller. eds. (2001) ''Contemporary Linguistics''. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety spoken in a particular region is called a regional dialect; some regional varieties are called topolects, especially to discuss [[varieties of Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2010 |title =topolect |encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |location=Boston |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are dialect varieties associated with particular ethnic groups (sometimes called [[ethnolect]]s), [[Social class|socioeconomic classes]] (sometimes called [[sociolect]]s), or other social or cultural groups.

[[Dialectology]] is the study of dialects and their geographic or social distribution.&lt;ref name=ContempLx/&gt; Traditionally, dialectologists study the variety of language used within a particular [[speech community]], a group of people who share a set of norms or conventions for language use.&lt;ref name=MeechamReesMiller/&gt; More recently, [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguists]] have adopted the concept of the [[community of practice]], a group of people who develop shared knowledge and shared norms of interaction, as the social group within which dialects develop and change.&lt;ref name=LaveWenger&gt;Lave, Jean &amp; Etienne Wenger. (1991) ''Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociolinguists [[Penelope Eckert]] and [[Sally McConnell-Ginet]] explain: "Some communities of practice may develop more distinctive ways of speaking than others. Thus, it is within communities of practice that linguistic influence may spread within and among speech communities."&lt;ref name=EckertMcConnellGinet&gt;Eckert, Penelope &amp; Sally McConnell-Ginet. (2003) ''Language and Gender''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The words ''dialect'' and ''accent'' are sometimes used interchangeably in everyday English speech, but linguists and scholars define the two terms differently. [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|Accent]] is used to refer only to differences in [[pronunciation]], especially those that are associated with geographic or social differences. Dialect, which refers to differences in syntax, [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and vocabulary as well as pronunciation, is the broader term.

==Standard varieties==
{{main|Standard language}}
Most languages have a ''standard variety'', some variety that is selected and promoted by either quasi-legal authorities or other social institutions, such as schools or media. Standard varieties are more prestigious than other, nonstandard varieties and are generally thought of as "correct" by speakers of the language. Since the selection is an [[arbitrariness|arbitrary standard]], standard varieties are "correct" only in the sense that they are highly valued by large numbers of individuals of medium and higher socio-economic status, those with the power to control language use, such as writers, publishers, public speakers and the ruling class, within the society that uses the language. As Ralph Harold Fasold puts it, "The standard language may not even be the best possible constellation of linguistic features available. It is general social acceptance that gives us a workable arbitrary standard, not any inherent superiority of the characteristics it specifies."&lt;ref name=Fasold&gt;Fasold, Ralph. (2006) "The politics of language." In R.W. Fasold and J. Connor-Linton (eds) ''An Introduction to Language and Linguistics''. pp. 371-400. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociolinguists generally recognize the standard variety of a language as one of the dialects of that language.&lt;ref name=Trudgill&gt;{{cite book |last=Trudgill |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Trudgill |year=1999 |url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/dick/SEtrudgill.htm |chapter=Standard English: what it isn't |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321091659/http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/dick/SEtrudgill.htm |archive-date=21 March 2009 |editor-first=T. |editor-last=Bex |editor2-first=R.J. |editor2-last=Watts |title=Standard English: The Widening Debate |pages=117-128 |location=London |publisher=[[Routledge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, an official body, such as the [[Académie française]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Dictionnaire |url=http://www.academie-francaise.fr/le-dictionnaire/la-9e-edition |website=Académie française |language=French |accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the [[grammar]] and usage of a standard variety. More often, though, standard varieties are understood only implicitly. Writing of Standard English, John Algeo suggests that the standard variety "is simply what English speakers agree to regard as good".&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, John. (1993) "What Makes Good English Good?" In L. Miller Cleary and M.D. Lin (eds) ''Linguistics for Teachers''. pp. 473-82. New York: McGraw.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Registers and styles==
{{main|Register (sociolinguistics)|Style-shifting}}
A ''register'' (sometimes called a ''style'') is a variety of language used in a particular social setting.&lt;ref name=Ottenheimer&gt;Ottenheimer, Harriet Joseph. (2006) ''The Anthropology of Language''. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Cenage.&lt;/ref&gt; Settings may be defined in terms of greater or lesser formality,&lt;ref&gt;Joos, Martin. (1961) ''The Five Clocks.'' New York: Harcourt, Brace and World.&lt;/ref&gt; or in terms of socially-recognized events, such as [[child-directed speech|baby talk]], which is used in many western cultures to talk to small children or as a joking register used in [[teasing]] or playing [[The Dozens]].&lt;ref name=Ottenheimer/&gt; There are also registers associated with particular professions or interest groups; [[jargon]] refers specifically to the vocabulary associated with such registers.

Unlike dialects, which are used by particular speech communities and associated with geographical settings or social groupings, registers are associated with particular situations, purposes, or levels of formality. Dialect and register may be thought of as different dimensions of variation. For example, Trudgill suggests the following sentence as an example of a nonstandard dialect that is used with the technical register of physical geography:
{{as written|
{{quote|There was two eskers what we saw in them U-shaped valleys.&lt;ref name=Trudgill/&gt;}}
}}&lt;!-- Example sentence - do not correct usage or style --&gt;

Most speakers command a range of registers, which they use in different situations. The choice of register is affected by the setting and topic of speech, as well as the relationship that exists between the speakers.&lt;ref name=MST&gt;Saville-Troike, Muriel. (1982) ''The Ethnography of Communication: An Introduction''. Oxford and Cambridge, Massachusetts: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The appropriate form of language may also change during the course of a communicative event as the relationship between speakers changes, or different social facts become relevant. Speakers may shift styles, as their perception of an event in progress changes. Consider the following telephone call to the [[Embassy of Cuba in Washington, D.C.|Embassy of Cuba]] in [[Washington, DC]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Caller: ¿Es la embajada de Cuba? (''Is this the Cuban embassy?'')&lt;br&gt;
Receptionist: Sí. Dígame. (''Yes, may I help you?'')&lt;br&gt;
Caller: Es Rosa. (''It's Rosa.'')&lt;br&gt;
Receptionist: ¡Ah Rosa! {{as written|¿Cóm|a anda eso?}} (''Oh, Rosa! How's it going?'')
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- Example sentence - do not correct usage or style --&gt;

At first, the receptionist uses a relatively formal register, as befits her professional role. After the caller identifies herself, the receptionist recognizes that she is speaking to a friend, and she shifts to an informal register of [[colloquialism|colloquial]] [[Cuban Spanish]].&lt;ref name=MST/&gt; The shift is similar to metaphorical [[code-switching]], but since it involves styles or registers, it is considered an example of style-shifting.

==Idiolect==
An [[idiolect]] is defined as "the language use typical of an individual person".&lt;ref&gt;Freeborn, Dennis, Peter French &amp; David Langford. (1993) ''Varieties of English''. Houndsmill and London: MacMillan Press.&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's idiolect may be affected by contact with various regional or social dialects, professional registers and, in the case of [[multilingual]]s, various languages.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Michael and Susanne Carroll. (1978) ''Language and situation: language varieties and their social contexts''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

For scholars who view language from the perspective of [[linguistic competence]], essentially the knowledge of language and grammar that exists in the mind of an individual language user, the idiolect is a way of referring to the specific knowledge. For scholars who regard language as a shared social practice, the idiolect is more like a dialect with a speech community of one individual.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Alex. (2004) "Idiolects." ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/idiolects/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]''. Retrieved 07-01-2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vibhuti Narain Rai''' (born 28 November 1951) is a police officer and author from India. He obtained an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in English literature from [[Allahabad University]] in 1971 and joined the [[Indian Police Service]] in 1975 as a part of the [[Uttar Pradesh]] cadre. He served many sensitive districts as a [[superintendent of police]].

Between 1992–2001, Rai was seconded to the [[Government of India]], during which time his postings included anti-insurgency operations in the [[Kashmir Valley]] (1993–94). Subsequently, Rai has been posted as Additional [[Director General of Police]] in Uttar Pradesh. He has been awarded President's Police Medal for Distinguished Services and Police Medal for Meritorious Services.

Rai has also written five works of [[Hindi literature]], being the novels ''Ghar'', ''Shahar Mein Curfew'', ''Kissa Loktantra'', ''Tabadla'' and ''Prem Ki Bhoot Katha''. Some of these have been translated into other languages. He has also written satires, including the collection titled  ''Ek Chhatra Neta Ka Rojnamcha''. He has authored the chapter ''An Open Letter to My Fellow Police Officers'' in the book [[Gujarat The making of a tragedy|Gujarat:The making of a tragedy]] which is about the [[2002 Gujarat riots]]. The book was edited by [[Siddharth Varadarajan]] and published by Penguin({{ISBN|978-0143029014}}).

On 4 March 2016 on the occasion of completing 200 years of [[Treaty of Sugauli]], Mr. Rai got [[Ramesh Chandra Jha]] Smriti Samman 2016 for his contribution in Hindi literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outlookhindi.com/art-and-culture/diary/bhor-literature-festival-6993/ Outlook Hindi, MAR 12 , 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Shahar Mein'' curfew==
In 1988, Rai published a [[Hindi]] novel entitled ''Shahar Mein Curfew'' (Curfew in the City).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| first = Martin E.
| last = Marty &amp; others
| title = Fundamentalisms Comprehended (The Fundamentalism Project) (Paperback)
| publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]]
| year = 2004
| isbn = 978-0-226-50888-7
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its theme was a 1980 Hindu-Muslim riot in the city of [[Allahabad]], and Rai wrote freely about how religious prejudice in the Hindu dominated police force and provincial administration led to Muslim citizens' being viewed as enemies and thus becoming easy targets of brutality and murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| first = Martin E.
| last = Marty &amp; others
| title = Fundamentalisms Comprehended (The Fundamentalism Project) (Paperback)
| publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]]
| year = 2004
| isbn = 978-0-226-50888-7
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] readily took offense and denounced the novel for being ''anti-Hindu''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| first = Martin E.
| last = Marty &amp; others
| title = Fundamentalisms Comprehended (The Fundamentalism Project) (Paperback)
| publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]]

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It now wants a ban imposed on the novel, and when [[Ashok Singhal]], secretary general of the [[Vishva Hindu Parishad|V.H.P.]], was told of a producer wanting to turn the story into a film, he threatened to burn down theatres that dared to screen the planned film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| year = 2004
| isbn = 978-0-226-50888-7
}}&lt;/ref&gt; All this ire surrounds a project that has still not begun and a work of fiction that at no point directly criticizes any [[Hindu]] organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| first = Martin E.
| last = Marty &amp; others
| title = Fundamentalisms Comprehended (The Fundamentalism Project) (Paperback)

| isbn = 978-0-226-50888-7
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is worthwhile to quote here from a recent interview given by the author: ''"The intolerance of dissent is increasing in our society and the [[Ayodhya]] mobilization has largely contributed to this disturbing trend. The attacks on inconvenient writers and dissenting journalists are in fact motivated by a desire to silence all criticism and all reason, thereby making the very existence of rationally-thinking people redundant to the social and political process. This is extremely distressing."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rai is the founder-editor of ''Vartman Sahitya'', a Hindi literary magazine that has been published for over twenty years. He has written regular columns in various Hindi magazines and has campaigned against alleged [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] and [[Obscurantism|obscurantist]] forces in his country.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy]], [[Hyderabad]] awarded him a fellowship to study police neutrality during communal strife. This resulted in ''Combating Communal Conflict'', a book that was published in [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]].

As an activist he has established a library in his native village in a backward area of Eastern Uttar Pradesh. This library ''Sri Ramanand Saraswati Pustakalaya'', [[Azamgarh]] was established to encourage reading and has developed relationships with institutions such as [[Sahitya Akademi]], the [[National Book Trust]] and the [[National School of Drama]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

He is the President of NGO ''Saajhi Duniya'' which is involved in various activities including research work to create a better world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The '''Vietnamese Wikipedia''' ({{lang-vi|{{#property:P1448}}}}) is the [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese-language]] edition of [[Wikipedia]], a free, publicly editable, online [[encyclopedia]] supported by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. As with other language editions of Wikipedia, the project's content is both created and accessed using the [[MediaWiki]] [[wiki]] software. The Vietnamese Wikipedia's primary competitor is the ''[[Từ điển Bách khoa toàn thư Việt Nam|Encyclopedic Dictionary of Vietnam]]'' (''Từ điển Bách khoa toàn thư Việt Nam''), a state-funded [[encyclopedic dictionary]] also available online.

==Content==
As of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}, it has about [[:vi:Special:Statistics|{{formatnum:{{#expr:{{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|vi}} round -3}}}}]] articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vi.wikipedia.org/ |title=Vietnamese Wikipedia |language=Vietnamese |publisher=vi.wikipedia.org |date=2014-07-28 |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest Wikipedia in a non-European language, as well as the largest for a language which is [[official language|official]] in only one country. However, it has only 375,000 articles manually created, 67% of its articles having been made by bots, and thus ranks 3rd among non-European language Wikipedias after the Japanese and Chinese ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/BotActivityMatrixCreates.htm |title=Wikipedia Statistics - Bot article creations only |publisher=Stats.wikimedia.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Vietnamese Wikipedia initially went online in November 2002, with a front page and an article about the [[Internet Society]]. The project received little attention and did not begin to receive significant contributions until it was "restarted" in October 2003&lt;ref name="Stats"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikipedia Statistics Vietnamese|first=Erik|last=Zachte|work=Wikimedia Statistics|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=2008-10-28|url=http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesWikipediaVI.htm|date=2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the newer, [[Unicode]]-capable MediaWiki software was installed soon after.

By August 2008, the Vietnamese Wikipedia had grown to more than 50,000 articles&amp;nbsp;– a milestone it achieved on August 26&amp;nbsp;– approximately 432 of which were created by [[Internet bot|bot]]s.&lt;ref name="Escaladix"&gt;Data compiled using [[tools:~escaladix/larticles/|Escaladix's created articles list]] and [[:vi:Thể loại:Robot Wikipedia|a list of bots]] at the Vietnamese Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the project reached the 100,000-article milestone on September 12, 2009, bot-generated articles made up around 5% of its corpus.&lt;ref name="Robots"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikipedia:Robot|work=Bách khoa toàn thư mở Wikipedia|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|date=2009-09-14|accessdate=2009-09-14|url=http://vi.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Robot&amp;oldid=2263408|language=Vietnamese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Short articles are designated "stubs"; such articles number in the tens of thousands and include most of the bot-generated articles.&lt;ref name="Stubs"&gt;[[:vi:Wikipedia:Bài sơ khai|Wikipedia:Bài sơ khai]] at the Vietnamese Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

An experimental Wikipedia edition in the obsolete [[chữ Nôm]] script began in October 2006 at the [[Wikimedia Incubator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Wp/vi-nom|work=Wikimedia Incubator|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=August 28, 2016|url=https://incubator.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wp/vi-nom&amp;action=history}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was deleted in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Incubator:Requests for deletions/Archive|work=Wikimedia Incubator|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=August 28, 2016|url=https://incubator.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Incubator:Requests_for_deletions/Archive&amp;oldid=3683111#DELETE_Wp.2Fvi-nom_test_wiki_.28moved_here_from_I:AN.29}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unrelated wiki encyclopedia project, VinaWiki, transliterates Vietnamese Wikipedia articles into chữ Nôm as part of a project to revive the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=張正|trans-title=Main Page|work=VinaWiki|publisher=Han-Nom Revival Committee of Vietnam|date=August 23, 2016|accessdate=August 28, 2016|url=http://www.hannom-rcv.org/wi/index.php?title=張正|language=vi-Hani|archive-url=https://archive.is/20141219051734/http://www.hannom-rcv.org/wi/index.php?title=%E5%BC%B5%E6%AD%A3|archive-date=December 19, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The volunteer-led Vietnam Wikimedians User Group supports the development of the Vietnamese Wikipedia and other Vietnamese-language Wikimedia projects. It gained formal recognition as a Wikimedia user group on 28 August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recognition Wikimedians of Vietnam Wikimedians User Group|work=Wikimedia Meta-Wiki|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|date=28 August 2018|accessdate=9 September 2018|url=https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Affiliations_Committee/Resolutions/Recognition_Wikimedians_of_Vietnam_Wikimedians_User_Group?oldid=18352772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Vietnamese Wikipedia's article count reached 500,000 on 28 September 2012 and 1,000,000 on 15 June 2014.

==Software==
The Vietnamese Wikipedia uses AVIM, a [[JavaScript]]-based [[input method]] that allows the user to type accented Vietnamese text in popular input methods, such as [[Telex (IME)|Telex]], [[VNI (IME)|VNI]] and [[Vietnamese Quoted-Readable|VIQR]]. (See [[Vietnamese language and computers]].) The preferred input system can be selected using a box under the sidebar.&lt;ref&gt;[[:vi:Wikipedia:Gõ tiếng Việt/Tiếng Anh|Wikipedia:Gõ tiếng Việt/Tiếng Anh]], Vietnamese Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''vineyard designated wine''' is a [[wine]] produced from the product of a single [[vineyard]] with that vineyard's name appearing on the [[wine label]]. 

Throughout the [[history of winemaking]] and [[viticulture]], the differences in quality between one plot of land and another have been observed with the boundaries of these vineyard generally well demarcated. In [[Burgundy (wine)|Burgundy]], the vineyards of the area are classified with the highest quality vineyards receiving the ranking of [[Grand cru (Burgundy)|Grand cru]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Giliberti ''"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/30/AR2005083000341_pf.html Variations in Vineyards]"'' Washington Post, August 31st 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The names of these vineyards, such as [[Montrachet]], will often appear on the wine label of Burgundy wines in bolder, more prominent print than even the name of the producer.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 194-196"&gt;K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 194-196 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States (wine)|United States]], the appearance of vineyards name on wine labels is a relatively recent phenomenon with one of the first vineyard designated premium wines in [[California (wine)|California]] being the 1966 vintage [[Heitz Wine Cellars|Heitz]] Martha's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon.&lt;ref&gt;Gerien, J.
