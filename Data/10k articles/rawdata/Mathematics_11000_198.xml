      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1931">The adjective ''abstract'' has often been applied to [[differential geometry]] before, but the '''abstract differential geometry (ADG)''' of this article is a form of differential geometry without the [[calculus]] notion of smoothness, developed by [[Anastasios Mallios]] and [[Ioannis Raptis]] from 1998 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;"Geometry of Vector Sheaves: An Axiomatic Approach to Differential Geometry", Anastasios Mallios, Springer, 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-7923-5005-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of calculus, an axiomatic treatment of differential geometry is built via [[sheaf theory]] and [[sheaf cohomology]] using [[Euclidean vector|vector]] [[sheaf theory|sheaves]] in place of [[Fiber bundle|bundles]] based on arbitrary [[topological space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Modern Differential Geometry in Gauge Theories: Maxwell fields", Anastasios Mallios, Springer, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-8176-4378-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mallios says [[noncommutative geometry]] can be considered a special case of ADG, and that ADG is similar to [[synthetic differential geometry]].

==Applications==
===ADG Gravity===
Mallios and Raptis use ADG to avoid the singularities in [[general relativity]] and propose this as a route to [[quantum gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint = gr-qc/0411121|last1 = Mallios|first1 = Anastasios|title = Smooth Singularities Exposed: Chimeras of the Differential Spacetime Manifold|last2 = Raptis|first2 = Ioannis|year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Aequationes Mathematicae''''' is a [[mathematical journal]]. It is primarily devoted to [[functional equation]]s, but also publishes papers in [[dynamical system]]s, [[combinatorics]], and [[geometry]].&lt;ref name=scimago/&gt; As well as publishing regular journal submissions on these topics, it also regularly reports on international symposia on functional equations and produces bibliographies on the subject.&lt;ref name=pk&gt;{{citation|title=Functional Equations and Inequalities with Applications|series=Springer Monographs in Mathematics|first=Palaniappan|last=Kannappan|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|year=2009|isbn=9780387894928|page=xi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SdZoCM2OeuIC&amp;pg=PR11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[János Aczél (mathematician)|János Aczél]] founded the journal in 1968 at the [[University of Waterloo]], in part because of the long publication delays of up to four years in other journals at the time of its founding.&lt;ref name=pk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=In Celebration of Canadian Scientists: A Decade of Killam Laureates|editor1-first=Geraldine A.|editor1-last=Kenney-Wallace|editor1-link=Geraldine A.

It is currently published by [[Springer Science+Business Media]], with Zsolt Páles of the [[University of Debrecen]] as its editor in chief.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1966">'''Alexander Ivanovich Skopin''' (Александр Иванович Скопин) (1927–2003) was a [[Russia]]n [[mathematician]] known for his contributions to [[abstract algebra]].

==Biography==
Skopin was born on October 22, 1927, in [[Leningrad]], the son of Ivan Alexandrovich Skopin, who was himself also a [[number theory|number theorist]] and a student of [[Ivan Matveyevich Vinogradov]], and who died in the [[Siege of Leningrad]].&lt;ref name=mactutor&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id= Skopin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the war, Alexander Skopin studied at [[Leningrad University]], where he was a student of Dmitry Faddeev;&lt;ref&gt;{{mathgenealogy|name=Alexander Ivanovich Skopin|id=85201}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From that point to the end of his life, he worked as a researcher at the [[Steklov Mathematical Institute]] (where he was scientific secretary from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s) and taught algebra at the [[St. Petersburg University]]. He died on September 15, 2003, in St. Petersburg.

==Research==
Skopin's student work was in [[abstract algebra]], and concerned [[Central series#Upper central series|upper central series]] of [[Group (mathematics)|groups]] and [[Field extension|extensions of fields]]. In the 1970s, Skopin received a second doctorate concerning the application of [[computer algebra system]]s to [[group theory]]. From that point onward he used computational methods extensively in his research, which focussed on [[Central series#Lower central series|lower central series]] of [[Burnside group]]s. He related this problem to problems in other areas of mathematics including [[linear algebra]] and [[topological sorting]] of [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]].&lt;ref name=mactutor/&gt;

Biopython development began in 1999 and it was first released in July 2000.&lt;ref name="Chapman2004"&gt;{{Citation | first = Brad | last = Chapman |title=The Biopython Project: Philosophy, functionality and facts |url=http://www.biopython.org/DIST/docs/presentations/biopython_exelixis.pdf |date=11 March 2004 |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed during a similar time frame and with analogous goals to other projects that added bioinformatics capabilities to their respective programming languages, including [[BioPerl]], [[BioRuby]] and [[BioJava]]. Early developers on the project included Jeff Chang, Andrew Dalke and Brad Chapman, though over 100 people have made contributions to date.&lt;ref name="Contributors"&gt;{{Citation |title=List of Biopython contributors |url=http://biopython.org/SRC/biopython/CONTRIB |accessdate=11 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140911121354/http://biopython.org/SRC/biopython/CONTRIB |archivedate=11 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a similar [[Python (programming language)|Python]] project, namely '''PyCogent''', was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The initial scope of Biopython involved accessing, indexing and processing biological sequence files. While this is still a major focus, over the following years added modules have extended its functionality to cover additional areas of biology (see [[#Key features and examples|Key features and examples]]).

As of version 1.62, Biopython supports running on Python 3 as well as Python 2.&lt;ref name="Installation"&gt;{{Citation | first = Brad | last = Chapman |title=Biopython Installation |url=http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/install/Installation.html |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
Wherever possible, Biopython follows the conventions used by the Python programming language to make it easier for users familiar with Python. For example, &lt;code&gt;Seq&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SeqRecord&lt;/code&gt; objects can be manipulated via [[Array slicing#1991: Python|slicing]], in a manner similar to Python’s strings and lists. It is also designed to be functionally similar to other Bio* projects, such as BioPerl.&lt;ref name="Chapman2004"/&gt;

Biopython is able to read and write most common file formats for each of its functional areas, and its license is permissive and compatible with most other software licenses, which allow Biopython to be used in a variety of software projects.&lt;ref name="lists"/&gt;

== Key features and examples ==

=== Sequences ===
A core concept in Biopython is the biological sequence, and this is represented by the &lt;code&gt;Seq&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;ref name="Tutorial"&gt;{{Citation |last=Chang |first=Jeff |last2=Chapman |first2=Brad |last3=Friedberg |first3=Iddo |last4=Hamelryck |first4=Thomas |last5=de Hoon |first5=Michiel |last6=Cock |first6=Peter |last7=Antao |first7=Tiago |last8=Talevich |first8=Eric |last9=Wilczynski |first9=Bartek  |title=Biopython Tutorial and Cookbook |url=http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html |date=29 May 2014 |accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A Biopython &lt;code&gt;Seq&lt;/code&gt; object is similar to a Python string in many respects: it supports the Python slice notation, can be concatenated with other sequences and is immutable. In addition, it includes sequence-specific methods and specifies the particular biological alphabet used.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pycon"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # This script creates a DNA sequence and performs some typical manipulations
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio.Seq import Seq
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio.Alphabet import IUPAC
&gt;&gt;&gt; dna_sequence = Seq('AGGCTTCTCGTA', IUPAC.unambiguous_dna)
&gt;&gt;&gt; dna_sequence
Seq('AGGCTTCTCGTA', IUPACUnambiguousDNA())
&gt;&gt;&gt; dna_sequence[2:7]
Seq('GCTTC', IUPACUnambiguousDNA())
&gt;&gt;&gt; dna_sequence.reverse_complement()
Seq('TACGAGAAGCCT', IUPACUnambiguousDNA())
&gt;&gt;&gt; rna_sequence = dna_sequence.transcribe()
&gt;&gt;&gt; rna_sequence
Seq('AGGCUUCUCGUA', IUPACUnambiguousRNA())
&gt;&gt;&gt; rna_sequence.translate()
Seq('RLLV', IUPACProtein())
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Sequence annotation ===
The &lt;code&gt;SeqRecord&lt;/code&gt; class describes sequences, along with information such as name, description and features in the form of &lt;code&gt;SeqFeature&lt;/code&gt; objects.  Each &lt;code&gt;SeqFeature&lt;/code&gt; object specifies the type of the feature and its location. Feature types can be ‘gene’, ‘CDS’ (coding sequence), ‘repeat_region’, ‘mobile_element’ or others, and the position of features in the sequence can be exact or approximate.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pycon"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # This script loads an annotated sequence from file and views some of its contents.
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio import SeqIO
&gt;&gt;&gt; seq_record = SeqIO.read('pTC2.gb', 'genbank')
&gt;&gt;&gt; seq_record.name
'NC_019375'
&gt;&gt;&gt; seq_record.description
'Providencia stuartii plasmid pTC2, complete sequence.'
&gt;&gt;&gt; seq_record.features[14]
SeqFeature(FeatureLocation(ExactPosition(4516), ExactPosition(5336), strand=1), type='mobile_element')
&gt;&gt;&gt; seq_record.seq
Seq('GGATTGAATATAACCGACGTGACTGTTACATTTAGGTGGCTAAACCCGTCAAGC...GCC', IUPACAmbiguousDNA())
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Input and output ===
Biopython can read and write to a number of common sequence formats, including [[FASTA format|FASTA]], [[FASTQ format|FASTQ]], GenBank, Clustal, PHYLIP and [[Nexus file|NEXUS]].  When reading files, descriptive information in the file is used to populate the members of Biopython classes, such as &lt;code&gt;SeqRecord&lt;/code&gt;.  This allows records of one file format to be converted into others.

Very large sequence files can exceed a computer's memory resources, so Biopython provides various options for accessing records in large files.  They can be loaded entirely into memory in Python data structures, such as lists or [[Associative array|dictionaries]], providing fast access at the cost of memory usage.  Alternatively, the files can be read from disk as needed, with slower performance but lower memory requirements.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pycon"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # This script loads a file containing multiple sequences and saves each one in a different format.
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio import SeqIO
&gt;&gt;&gt; genomes = SeqIO.parse('salmonella.gb', 'genbank')
&gt;&gt;&gt; for genome in genomes:
...     SeqIO.write(genome, genome.id + '.fasta', 'fasta')
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Accessing online databases ===

Through the Bio.Entrez module, users of Biopython can download biological data from NCBI databases.  Each of the functions provided by the [[Entrez]] search engine is available through functions in this module, including searching for and downloading records.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pycon"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # This script downloads genomes from the NCBI Nucleotide database and saves them in a FASTA file.
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio import Entrez
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio import SeqIO
&gt;&gt;&gt; output_file = open('all_records.fasta', "w")
&gt;&gt;&gt; Entrez.email = 'my_email@example.com'
&gt;&gt;&gt; records_to_download = ['FO834906.1', 'FO203501.1']
&gt;&gt;&gt; for record_id in records_to_download:
...     handle = Entrez.efetch(db='nucleotide', id=record_id, rettype='gb')
...     seqRecord = SeqIO.read(handle, format='gb')
...     handle.close()
...     output_file.write(seqRecord.format('fasta'))
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Phylogeny ===

[[File:Phylo.draw.png|thumb|300px|Figure 1: A rooted phylogenetic tree created by Bio.Phylo showing the relationship between different organisms' Apaf-1 homologs&lt;ref name="Zmasek2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zmasek |first=Christian M |last2=Zhang |first2=Qing |last3=Ye |first3=Yuzhen |last4=Godzik |first4=Adam |date=24 October 2007 |title=Surprising complexity of the ancestral apoptosis network |url=http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/10/R226 |journal=Genome Biology |publisher= |volume=8 |issue=10 |accessdate=9 September 2014 |doi=10.1186/gb-2007-8-10-r226 |pages=R226 |pmid=17958905 |pmc=2246300}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[File:Phylo.draw graphviz.png|thumb|Figure 2: The same tree as above, drawn unrooted using Graphviz via Bio.Phylo]]

The Bio.Phylo module provides tools for working with and visualising [[phylogenetic tree]]s.  A variety of file formats are supported for reading and writing, including [[Newick format|Newick]], [[Nexus file|NEXUS]] and [[phyloXML]].  Common tree manipulations and traversals are supported via the &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Clade&lt;/code&gt; objects.  Examples include converting and collating tree files, extracting subsets from a tree, changing a tree's root, and analysing branch features such as length or score.&lt;ref name="Talevich2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Talevich |first=Eric |last2=Invergo |first2=Brandon M |last3=Cock |first3=Peter JA |last4=Chapman |first4=Brad A |date=21 August 2012 |title=Bio.Phylo: A unified toolkit for processing, analyzing and visualizing phylogenetic trees in Biopython |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/13/209 |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |publisher= |volume=13 |issue=209 |accessdate=9 September 2014 |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-13-209 |pmid=22909249 |pmc=3468381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rooted trees can be drawn in [[ASCII art|ASCII]] or using [[matplotlib]] (see Figure 1), and the [[Graphviz]] library can be used to create unrooted layouts (see Figure 2).

=== Genome diagrams ===

[[File:PKPS77.png|thumb|300px|Figure 3: A diagram of the genes on the pKPS77 plasmid,&lt;ref name="NC_023330.1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_023330.1 |title=Klebsiella pneumoniae strain KPS77 plasmid pKPS77, complete sequence |date= |website= |publisher=NCBI |accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; visualised using the GenomeDiagram module in Biopython]]

The GenomeDiagram module provides methods of visualising sequences within Biopython.&lt;ref name="Pritchard2006"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pritchard |first=Leighton |last2=White |first2=Jennifer A |last3=Birch |first3=Paul RJ |last4=Toth |first4=Ian K |title=GenomeDiagram: a python package for the visualization of large-scale genomic data |journal=Bioinformatics |date=March 2006 |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=616–617 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btk021 |pmid=16377612}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sequences can be drawn in a linear or circular form (see Figure 3), and many output formats are supported, including [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] and [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]].  Diagrams are created by making tracks and then adding sequence features to those tracks.  By looping over a sequence's features and using their attributes to decide if and how they are added to the diagram's tracks, one can exercise much control over the appearance of the final diagram.  Cross-links can be drawn between different tracks, allowing one to compare multiple sequences in a single diagram.

=== Macromolecular structure ===

The Bio.PDB module can load molecular structures from [[Protein Data Bank (file format)|PDB]] and [[Crystallographic Information File|mmCIF]] files, and was added to Biopython in 2003.&lt;ref name="Hamelryck2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamelryck |first=Thomas |last2=Manderick |first2=Bernard |date=10 May 2003 |title=PDB file parser and structure class implemented in Python |url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/17/2308 |journal=Bioinformatics |publisher= |volume=19 |issue=17 |accessdate=10 September 2014 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btg299 |pages=2308–2310}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The &lt;code&gt;Structure&lt;/code&gt; object is central to this module, and it organises macromolecular structure in a hierarchical fashion: &lt;code&gt;Structure&lt;/code&gt; objects contain &lt;code&gt;Model&lt;/code&gt; objects which contain &lt;code&gt;Chain&lt;/code&gt; objects which contain &lt;code&gt;Residue&lt;/code&gt; objects which contain &lt;code&gt;Atom&lt;/code&gt; objects.  Disordered residues and atoms get their own classes, &lt;code&gt;DisorderedResidue&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DisorderedAtom&lt;/code&gt;, that describe their uncertain positions.

Using Bio.PDB, one can navigate through individual components of a macromolecular structure file, such as examining each atom in a protein.  Common analyses can be carried out, such as measuring distances or angles, comparing residues and calculating residue depth.

=== Population genetics ===

The Bio.PopGen module adds support to Biopython for Genepop, a software package for statistical analysis of population genetics.&lt;ref name="Rousset2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rousset |first=François |date=January 2008 |title=GENEPOP'007: a complete re-implementation of the GENEPOP software for Windows and Linux |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-8286.2007.01931.x/abstract |journal=Molecular Ecology Resources |publisher= |volume=8 |accessdate=11 September 2014 |doi=10.1111/j.1471-8286.2007.01931.x |pages=103–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows for analyses of [[Hardy–Weinberg principle|Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium]], [[linkage disequilibrium]] and other features of a population's [[Allele frequency|allele frequencies]].

This module can also carry out population genetic simulations using [[coalescent theory]] with the fastsimcoal2 program.&lt;ref name="Excoffier2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Excoffier |first=Laurent |last2=Foll |first2=Matthieu |date=1 March 2011 |title=fastsimcoal: a continuous-time coalescent simulator of genomic diversity under arbitrarily complex evolutionary scenarios |url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/9/1332 |journal=Bioinformatics |publisher= |volume=27 |issue=9 |accessdate=11 September 2014 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btr124 |pages=1332–1334 |pmid=21398675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wrappers for command line tools ===

Many of Biopython's modules contain command line wrappers for commonly used tools, allowing these tools to be used from within Biopython.  These wrappers include [[BLAST]], [[Clustal]], PhyML, [[EMBOSS]] and [[SAMtools]].  Users can subclass a generic wrapper class to add support for any other command line tool.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Chart animation.gif|thumb|379px|Charts showing the change of cell count per generation of the four different breeder types. A polynomial trend line demonstrates the quadratic growth rate.
{{ifdc|Chart animation.gif|log=2014 March 22}}]] --&gt;

In [[cellular automaton|cellular automata]] such as [[Conway's Game of Life]], a '''breeder''' is a pattern that exhibits [[quadratic growth]], by generating multiple copies of a secondary pattern, each of which then generates multiple copies of a tertiary pattern.&lt;ref name="weisstein"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ericweisstein.com/encyclopedias/life/Breeder.html |accessdate=2008-11-01| title = Breeder – from Eric Weisstein's Treasure Trove of Life C.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Breeders can be classed by the relative motion of the patterns.  The classes are denoted by three-letter codes, which denote whether the primary, secondary and tertiary elements respectively are moving (M) or stationary (S).  The four basic types are:&lt;ref name="weisstein" /&gt;
* SMM – A [[Gun (cellular automaton)|gun]] that fires out [[Rake (cellular automaton)|rakes]].
* MSM – A [[Puffer train|puffer]] that leaves [[Gun (cellular automaton)|guns]] in its wake.
* MMS – A [[Rake (cellular automaton)|rake]] that fires out [[Puffer train (cellular automaton)|puffers]].
* MMM – A [[Rake (cellular automaton)|rake]] that fires out more [[Rake (cellular automaton)|rakes]], such that there are no stationary elements.

A [[spacefiller]] (which also undergoes quadratic growth) may be thought of as a fifth class of breeder.  However it differs from a true breeder in that it expands a single island of cells, rather than creating independent objects.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sensor network does this by exchanging the measured value and accuracy value at every node with every other node,  and computes the accuracy range and a measured value for the whole network from all of the values collected.  Even if some of the data from some of the sensors is faulty, the sensor network will not malfunction. The algorithm is fault-tolerant and distributed. It could also be used as a sensor fusion method. The precision and accuracy bound of this algorithm have been proved in 2016.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ao|first=Buke|last2=Wang|first2=Yongcai|last3=Yu|first3=Lu|last4=Brooks|first4=Richard R.|last5=Iyengar|first5=S.

The algorithm assumes ''N'' processing elements (PEs), ''t'' of which are faulty and can behave maliciously. It takes as input either real values with inherent inaccuracy or noise (which can be unknown), or a real value with apriori defined uncertainty, or an interval. The output of the algorithm is a real value with an explicitly specified accuracy. The algorithm runs in O(''N''log''N'') where ''N'' is the number of PEs: see [[Big O notation]].

==Algorithm==

The Brooks–Iyengar algorithm is executed in every processing element (PE) of a distributed sensor network.  Each PE exchanges their measured interval with all other PEs in the network. The "fused" measurement is a weighted average of the midpoints of the regions found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~sahni/papers/sensors.pdf
 |title=Algorithms For Wireless Sensor Networks
 |author=[[Sartaj Sahni]] and Xiaochun Xu
 |publisher=University of Florida, Gainesville
 |date=September 7, 2004
 |accessdate=2010-03-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concrete steps of Brooks–Iyengar algorithm are shown in this section. Each PE performs the algorithm separately:

'''Input:'''

The measurement sent by PE ''k'' to PE ''i'' is a closed interval &lt;math&gt;[l_{k,i}, h_{k,i}]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;1 \leq k \leq N&lt;/math&gt;

'''Output:'''

The output of PE ''i'' includes a point estimate and an interval estimate
# PE ''i'' receives measurements from all the other PEs.
# Divide the union of collected measurements into mutually exclusive intervals based on the number of measurements that intersect, which is known as the weight of the interval.
# Remove intervals with weight less than &lt;math&gt;N-\tau&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the number of faulty PEs
# If there are ''L'' intervals left, let &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of the remaining intervals. We have &lt;math&gt;A_i = \{(I_1^i, w_1^i), \dots, (I_L^i, w_L^i)\}&lt;/math&gt;, where interval &lt;math&gt;I_l^i = [l_{I_l^i}, h_{I_l^i}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_l^i&lt;/math&gt;is the weight associated with interval &lt;math&gt;I_l^i&lt;/math&gt; . We also assume &lt;math&gt;h_{I_l^i} \leq h_{I_{l+1}^i}&lt;/math&gt;.
# Calculate the point estimate &lt;math&gt;v_i'&lt;/math&gt; of PE ''i'' as  &lt;math&gt;v_i' = \frac{\sum_l \frac{(l_{I_l^i}+h_{I_l^i})\cdot w_l^i}{2}}{\sum_l w_l^i}&lt;/math&gt; and the interval estimate is &lt;math&gt;[l_{I_1^i}, h_{I_L^i}]&lt;/math&gt;
'''Example:'''

Consider an example of 5 PEs, in which PE 5 (&lt;math&gt;S_5&lt;/math&gt;) is sending wrong values to other PEs and they all exchange the values.

The values received by &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; are in the next Table.

We draw a Weighted Region Diagram (WRD) of these intervals, then we can determine &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; for PE 1 according to the Algorithm:

&lt;math&gt;A_1 = \{([1.5, 2.7], 4), ([2.7, 2.8], 5), ( [2.8, 3.2], 4) \}&lt;/math&gt;

which consists of intervals where at least 4(= &lt;math&gt;N-\tau&lt;/math&gt; = 5−1) measurements intersect. The output of PE 1 is equal to

&lt;math&gt;\frac{4*\frac{1.5+2.7}{2} + 5* \frac{2.7+2.8}{2} + 4*\frac{2.8+3.2}{2}} {13} = 2.625&lt;/math&gt;

and the interval estimate is &lt;math&gt;[1.5, 3.2]&lt;/math&gt;

Similar, we could obtain all the inputs and results of the 5 PEs:

We could use Approximate Consensus (scalar-based), Brooks-Iyengar Algorithm (interval-based) and Byzantine Vector Consensus (vector-based) to deal with interval inputs, and the paper &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; proved that Brooks–Iyengar algorithm is the best here.

== Application ==
Brooks–Iyengar algorithm is a seminal work and a major milestone in distributed sensing, and could be used as a fault tolerant solution for many redundancy scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Vijay|year=2012|title=Computational and Compressed Sensing Optimizations for Information Processing in Sensor Network|url=|journal=International Journal of Next-Generation Computing|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it is easy to implement and embed in any networking systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ao|first=Buke|date=July 2017|title=Robust Fault Tolerant Rail Door State Monitoring Systems: Applying the Brooks-Iyengar Sensing Algorithm to Transportation Applications|url=|journal=International Journal of Next-Generation Computing |volume=8|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the algorithm was used in MINIX to provide more accuracy and precision, which leads to the development of the first version of RT-Linux.

In 2000, the algorithm was also central to the DARPA SensIT program’s distributed tracking program. Acoustic, seismic and motion detection readings from multiple sensors are combined and fed into a distributed tracking system. Besides, it was used to combine heterogeneous sensor feeds in the application fielded by BBN Technologies, BAE systems, Penn State Applied Research Lab(ARL), and USC/ISI.

Besides, the Thales Group, a UK Defense Manufacturer, used this work in its Global Operational Analysis Laboratory. It is applied to Raytheon’s programs where many systems need extract reliable data from unreliable sensor network, this exempts the increasing investment in improving sensor reliability. Also, the research in developing this algorithm results in the tools used by the US Nav in its maritime domain awareness software.

In education, Brooks–Iyengar algorithm has been widely used in teaching classes such as University of Wisconsin, Purdue, Georgia Tech, Clemson University, University of Maryland, etc.

In addition to the area of sensor network, other fields such as time-triggered architecture, safety of cyber-physical systems, data fusion, robot convergence, high-performance computing, software/hardware reliability, ensemble learning in artificial intelligence systems could also benefit from Brooks–Iyengar algorithm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1196">A '''calendrical calculation''' is a [[calculation]] concerning [[calendar date]]s. Calendrical calculations can be considered an area of [[applied mathematics]]. Calendrical calculation is one of the five major [[Savant syndrome]] characteristics.
Some examples of calendrical calculations:

* Converting a [[Julian calendar|Julian]] or [[Gregorian calendar]] date to its [[Julian day]] number and vice versa (see [[Julian day#Calculation|the section on calculation in that article]] for details).
* The number of days between two dates, which is simply the difference in their Julian day numbers.
* The date of a religious holiday, like [[Easter]] (the calculation is known as [[Computus]]) or [[Passover]], for a given year.
* Converting a date between different calendars. For instance, dates in the [[Gregorian calendar]] can be converted to dates in the [[Islamic calendar]] with the [[Kuwaiti algorithm]].
* [[Calculating the day of the week]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1491">'''Carathéodory's criterion''' is a result in [[measure theory]] that was formulated by Greek [[mathematician]] [[Constantin Carathéodory]]. Its statement is as follows: Let &lt;math&gt;\lambda^*&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue]] [[outer measure]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;E\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is [[Lebesgue measurable]] if and only if &lt;math&gt;\lambda^* (A) = \lambda^* (A \cap E) + \lambda^* (A \cap E^\mathrm{c})&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.
Notice that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is not required to be a measurable set.  

The Carathéodory criterion is of considerable importance because, in contrast to Lebesgue's original formulation of measurability, which relies on certain topological properties of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;,  this criterion readily generalizes to a characterization of measurability in abstract spaces.  Indeed, in the generalization to abstract measures, this theorem is sometimes extended to a ''definition'' of measurability.  Thus, we have the following definition:  Let &lt;math&gt;\mu^*&lt;/math&gt; be an [[outer measure]] on a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;E\subset X&lt;/math&gt; is called &lt;math&gt;\mu^*&lt;/math&gt;–''measurable'' if for every &lt;math&gt;A\subset X&lt;/math&gt;, the equality &lt;math&gt;\mu^*(A)=\mu^*(A\cap E)+\mu^*(A\cap E^\mathrm{c})&lt;/math&gt; holds.

In the mathematical field of [[set theory]], the '''continuum''' means the [[real numbers]], or the corresponding (infinite) [[cardinal number]], &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}&lt;/math&gt;. [[Georg Cantor]] proved that the cardinality &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}&lt;/math&gt; is larger than the smallest infinity, namely, &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;. He also proved that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt; 2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;, the cardinality of the [[power set]] of the [[natural numbers]].

The ''[[cardinality of the continuum]]'' is the [[cardinality|size]] of the set of real numbers. The [[continuum hypothesis]] is sometimes stated by saying that no [[cardinality]] lies between that of the continuum and that of the [[natural numbers]], &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Linear continuum == 
{{Main|Linear continuum}}
According to [[Raymond Wilder]] (1965) there are four axioms that make a set ''C'' and the relation &lt; into a '''linear continuum''':
* ''C'' is [[simply ordered set|simply ordered]] with respect to &lt;.
* If [''A,B''] is a cut of ''C'', then either ''A'' has a last element or ''B'' has a first element. (compare [[Dedekind cut]])
* There exists a non-empty, [[countable]] subset ''S'' of ''C'' such that, if ''x,y'' &amp;isin; ''C'' such that ''x'' &lt; ''y'', then there exists ''z'' &amp;isin; ''S'' such that ''x'' &lt; ''z'' &lt; ''y''. ([[separable space|separability axiom]])
* ''C'' has no first element and no last element. ([[Bounded set|Unboundedness axiom]])
These axioms characterize the [[order type]] of the [[real number line]].

'''''Cypherpunks: Freedom and the Future of the Internet''''' is a 2012 book by [[Julian Assange]], in discussion with [[Internet activist]]s and [[cypherpunk]]s [[Jacob Appelbaum]], [[Andy Müller-Maguhn]] and [[Jérémie Zimmermann]]. Its primary topic is society's relationship with [[information security]]. In the book, the authors warn that the Internet has become a tool of the [[police state]], and that the world is inadvertently heading toward a form of [[totalitarianism]]. They promote the use of [[cryptography]] to protect against state surveillance.&lt;ref name=Aitkenhead/&gt;

In the introduction, Assange says that the book is "not a [[manifesto]]... [but] a warning."&lt;ref name="cryptome_beginning"&gt;{{cite web

 | date = 1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told ''Guardian'' journalist [[Decca Aitkenhead]]:

{{quotation|A well-defined mathematical [[algorithm]] can [[encrypt]] something quickly, but to [[decrypt]] it would take billions of years–or trillions of dollars' worth of electricity to drive the computer. So [[cryptography]] is the essential building block of independence for organisations on the Internet, just like armies are the essential building blocks of [[Sovereign state|states]], because otherwise one state just takes over another. There is no other way for our intellectual life to gain proper independence from the security guards of the world, the people who control physical reality.&lt;ref name=Aitkenhead&gt;Aitkenhead, Decca. [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/dec/07/julian-assange-fugitive-interview "Julian Assange: the fugitive"], ''The Guardian'', 7 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Assange later wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'': "Strong cryptography is a vital tool in fighting state oppression." saying that was the message of his book, ''Cypherpunks''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/09/cryptography-weapon-fight-empire-states-julian-assange ''How cryptography is a key weapon in the fight against empire states''], Julian Assange, ''The Guardian'', 9 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''decentralized autonomous organization''' ('''DAO'''), sometimes labeled a '''decentralized autonomous corporation''' ('''DAC'''), is an [[organization]] represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by shareholders and not influenced by a central government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Prusty |first=Narayan |date=27 Apr 2017 |title=Building Blockchain Projects |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=80EwDwAAQBAJ |location=Birmingham, UK |publisher=Packt |page=9 |isbn=9781787125339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3082055 The Decentralized Autonomous Organization and Governance Issues] ''Regulation of Financial Institutions Journal'': Social Science Research Network (SSRN). 5 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; A DAO's financial transaction record and program rules are maintained on a [[Blockchain (database)|blockchain]].&lt;ref name=Vigna20150127/&gt;{{rp|229}}&lt;ref name=Hodson20131120/&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist20160521/&gt; The precise legal status of this type of business organization is unclear.&lt;ref name=Popper20160521/&gt;

A well-known example, intended for venture capital funding, was [[The DAO (organization)|The DAO]], which launched with $150 million in crowdfunding in June 2016, and was immediately hacked and drained of {{USD|50 million}}&lt;!-- approximate US dollar value of the drained Ether --&gt; in [[cryptocurrency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital currency Ethereum is cratering amid claims of a $50 million hack|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/dao-hacked-ethereum-crashing-in-value-tens-of-millions-allegedly-stolen-2016-6|first=Rob|last=Price|date=17 June 2016|accessdate=17 June 2016|work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hack was reversed in the following weeks, and the money restored, via a hard fork of the [[Ethereum]] blockchain. This bailout was made possible by the Ethereum miners and clients switching to the new fork.&lt;ref name=daobail /&gt;

== Background ==
Decentralized autonomous organizations are typified by the use of blockchain technology to provide a secure digital [[ledger]] to track financial interactions across the internet, hardened against forgery by [[trusted timestamp]]ing and dissemination of a [[distributed database]].&lt;ref name=Vigna20150127/&gt;{{rp|229}}&lt;ref name=Hodson20131120/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wright2015/&gt; This approach eliminates the need to involve a mutually acceptable [[trusted third party]] in a financial transaction, thus simplifying the transaction.&lt;ref name=Hodson20131120/&gt; The costs of a blockchain-enabled transaction and of the associated data reporting may be substantially offset by the elimination of both the trusted third party and of the need for repetitive recording of contract exchanges in different records. For example, the blockchain data could, in principle and if regulatory structures permit it, replace public documents such as [[deed]]s and [[Title (property)|title]]s.&lt;ref name=Vigna20150127/&gt;{{rp|42}}&lt;ref name=Hodson20131120/&gt; In theory, a blockchain approach allows multiple [[cloud computing]] users to enter a loosely coupled [[peer-to-peer]] [[smart contract]] collaboration.&lt;ref name=Vigna20150127/&gt;{{rp|42}}&lt;ref name=Norta2015/&gt;

[[Daniel Larimer]] first proposed the concept of a "Decentralized Organized Company" in an article published on September 7, 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://letstalkbitcoin.com/is-bitcoin-overpaying-for-false-security|title=Over Paying for Security|work=Let's Talk Bitcoin}}&lt;/ref&gt; and implemented in Bitshares in 2014.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.is/WpMpu|title=What Is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization? - NullTX|date=2018-11-09|work=archive.is|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Vitalik Buterin]] proposed that after a DAO was launched, it might be organized to run without human managerial interactivity, provided the [[smart contract]]s were supported by a [[Turing completeness|Turing complete]] platform.&lt;ref name=Buterin201309/&gt; [[Ethereum]], built on a blockchain and launched in 2015, has been described as meeting that Turing threshold, thus enabling such DAOs.&lt;ref name=Vigna20150127/&gt;{{rp|229}}&lt;ref name=Pangburn2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Evans2015/&gt; Decentralized autonomous organizations aim to be open platforms where individuals control their identities and their personal data.&lt;ref name=Deegan2014/&gt;

== Issues ==
It can be difficult for a DAO to retain an attorney, or enter any kind of written contract because nobody in the company is interested in putting their personal name on agreements.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Social===
Shareholder participation in DAOs can be problematic. For example, ''BitShares'' has seen a lack of voting participation, because it takes time and energy to consider proposals.&lt;ref name=Economist20160521/&gt;

=== Legal liability ===
The precise legal status of this type of business organization is unclear;&lt;ref name=Wright2015/&gt;  some similar approaches have been regarded by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] as illegal offers of unregistered [[Security (finance)|securities]].&lt;ref name=Popper20160521/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEC20140603/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hinkes20160519/&gt; Although unclear, a DAO may functionally be a corporation without legal status as a corporation: a [[general partnership]].&lt;ref name=Levine20160517/&gt; This means potentially [[limited liability|unlimited legal liability]] for participants, even if the smart contract code or the DAO's promoters say otherwise.&lt;ref name=Levine20160517/&gt; Known participants, or those at the interface between a DAO and regulated financial systems, may be targets for regulatory enforcement or civil actions.&lt;ref name=Levine20160517/&gt;&lt;!--=== Regulation and enforcement === probably should add something about state/less etc--&gt;

=== Security ===
The code of a given DAO will be difficult to alter once the system is up and running, including bug fixes that would be otherwise trivial in centralised code. Corrections for a DAO would require writing new code and agreement to migrate all the funds. Although the code is visible to all, it is hard to repair, thus leaving known security holes open to exploitation unless a moratorium is called to enable bug fixing.&lt;ref name=Peck20160528/&gt;

In 2016, a specific DAO, "[[The DAO (organization)|The DAO]]", set a record for the largest [[crowdfunding]] campaign to date.&lt;ref name=Castillo20160512/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vigna20160516/&gt;&lt;ref name=Waters20160517/&gt; Researchers pointed out multiple issues in the code of The DAO. The operational procedure for The DAO allowed investors to withdraw at will any money that had not yet been committed to a project; the funds could thus deplete quickly.&lt;ref name=Economist20160521/&gt; Although safeguards aimed to prevent gaming the voting of shareholders to win investments,&lt;ref name=Popper20160521/&gt; there were a "number of security vulnerabilities".&lt;ref name=Popper20160527/&gt; These enabled an attempted large withdrawal of funds from The DAO to be initiated in mid-June 2016.&lt;ref name=Popper20160617/&gt;&lt;ref name=Price20160617/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cimpanu20160618/&gt; On the 20th of July 2016, the [[Ethereum]] community arrived at a consensus decision to hard fork the Ethereum blockchain to [[bailout|bail out]] the original contract.&lt;ref name="daobail"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Vitalik Buterin |authorlink1=Vitalik Buterin |title=Hard Fork Completed |url=https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/20/hard-fork-completed |website=blog.ethereum.org |publisher=Ehereum Foundation |accessdate=27 September 2018 |language=en |date=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1545">In [[graph theory]], the '''Edmonds matrix''' &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of a balanced [[bipartite graph]] &lt;math&gt;G(U, V, E)&lt;/math&gt; with [[Set (mathematics)|set]]s of vertices &lt;math&gt;U = \{u_1, u_2, \dots , u_n \}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V = \{v_1, v_2, \dots , v_n\}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by 

:&lt;math&gt; A_{ij} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
   x_{ij} &amp; (u_i, v_j) \in E \\
   0 &amp; (u_i, v_j) \notin E
 \end{array}\right.&lt;/math&gt; 

where the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; are [[Indeterminate (variable)|indeterminates]].  One application of the Edmonds matrix of a bipartite graph is that the graph admits a [[perfect matching]] if and only if the polynomial det(''A''&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;) in the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; is not identically zero. Furthermore, the number of perfect matchings is equal to the number of [[monomials]] in the polynomial det(''A''), and is also equal to the [[Permanent (mathematics)|permanent]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. In addition, [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the [[maximum matching]] size of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

The Edmonds matrix is named after [[Jack Edmonds]]. The [[Tutte matrix]] is a generalisation to non-bipartite graphs.

In [[mathematics]], especially [[real analysis]], a '''flat function''' is a [[smooth function]] ƒ&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;ℝ&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;ℝ all of whose [[derivative]]s vanish at a given point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;ℝ. The flat functions are, in some sense, the [[antithesis|antitheses]] of the [[analytic function]]s. An analytic function ƒ&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;ℝ&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;ℝ is given by a [[convergent series|convergent]] [[power series]] close to some point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;ℝ:
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) \sim \lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=0}^n\frac{f^{(k)}(x_0)}{k!}(x-x_0)^k . &lt;/math&gt;
In the case of a flat function we see that all derivatives vanish at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;ℝ, i.e. ƒ&lt;sup&gt;(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for all ''k''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;ℕ. This means that a meaningful [[Taylor series]] expansion in a neighbourhood of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is impossible. In the language of [[Taylor's_theorem#Statement|Taylor's theorem]], the non-constant part of the function always lies in the remainder ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') for all ''n''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;ℕ.

The function need not be flat at just one point. Trivially, [[constant function]]s on ℝ are flat everywhere. But there are other, less trivial, examples.

==Example==

The function defined by

: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases} e^{-1/x^2} &amp; \text{if }x\neq 0 \\
0 &amp; \text{if }x = 0 \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

is flat at&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. Thus, this is an example of a [[non-analytic smooth function]].

In [[science]], a '''formula''' is a concise way of expressing information symbolically, as in a mathematical formula or a [[chemical formula]]. The informal use of the term ''formula'' in science refers to the [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|general construct of a relationship between given quantities]].  

The plural of ''formula'' can be spelled either as ''formulas'' (from the most common [[English plurals#Regular plurals|English plural noun form]]) or, under the influence of [[scientific Latin]], ''formulae'' (from the [[Latin influence in English|original Latin]]).&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{OED|formula}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a formula is an entity constructed using the symbols and formation rules of a given [[formal language|logical language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, having done this once in terms of some [[parameter]] (the [[radius]] for example), mathematicians have produced a formula to describe the volume:

: &lt;math&gt;V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3&lt;/math&gt;.

Having obtained this result, the volume of any sphere can be computed as long as its radius is known. Note that the volume ''V'' and the radius ''r'' are expressed as single letters instead of words or phrases. This convention, while less important in a relatively simple formula, means that mathematicians can more quickly manipulate larger and more complex formulas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; are often [[algebraic expression|algebraic]], [[closed-form expression|closed form]], and/or [[analytical expression|analytical]].

In [[Chemistry#Principles of modern chemistry|modern chemistry]], a [[chemical formula]] is a way of expressing information about the proportions of [[atom]]s that constitute a particular [[chemical compound]], using a single line of chemical [[chemical symbols|element symbols]], numbers, and sometimes other symbols, such as parentheses, brackets, and plus (+) and minus (−) signs.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, P.W., Overton, T., Rourke, J., Weller, M. and Armstrong, F. ''Shriver and Atkins inorganic chemistry'' (4th edition) 2006 ([[Oxford University Press]]) {{isbn|0-19-926463-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is the chemical formula for [[water]], specifying that each [[molecule]] consists of two [[hydrogen]] (H) atoms and one [[oxygen]] (O) atom. Similarly, O{{sup sub|−|3}} denotes an [[ozone]] molecule consisting of three oxygen atoms and having a net [[negative charge]].

In a general context, formulas are applied to provide a mathematical solution for real world problems. Some may be general: for example,

: {{math|1='''F''' = ''m'''''a'''}}

This is one expression of [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]], is applicable to a wide range of physical situations. Other formulas may be created to solve a particular problem: for example, using the [[equation]] of a [[sine curve]] to model the [[Tidal movement|movement of the tides]] in a [[bay]]. In all cases, however, formulas form the basis for calculations.

[[Expression (mathematics)|Expression]]s are distinct from formulas in that they cannot contain an equals sign (=).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

There are three common non-pictorial types of chemical formulas for this molecule:{{unordered list

 | the '''molecular formula''' C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and
 | the '''condensed formula''' (or ''semi-structural formula'') CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.}}
|alt=A diagram showing one line of four connected Cs (carbon atoms) branching out to ten Hs (hydrogen atoms)}}

A [[chemical formula]] identifies each constituent [[chemical element|element]] by its [[chemical symbol]] and indicates the proportionate number of atoms of each element.

In [[empirical formula]]s, these proportions begin with a key element and then assign numbers of atoms of the other elements in the compound, as ratios to the key element. For molecular compounds, these ratio numbers can all be expressed as whole numbers. For example, the empirical formula of [[ethanol]] may be written C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O because the molecules of ethanol all contain two carbon atoms, six hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom. Some types of ionic compounds, however, cannot be written with entirely whole-number empirical formulas. An example is [[boron carbide]], whose formula of CB&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is a variable non-whole number ratio with n ranging from over 4 to more than 6.5.

When the chemical compound of the formula consists of simple [[molecule]]s, chemical formulas often employ ways to suggest the structure of the molecule. There are several types of these formulas, including '''[[molecular formula]]s''' and '''[[condensed formula]]s'''. A molecular formula enumerates the number of atoms to reflect those in the molecule, so that the molecular formula for [[glucose]] is C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; rather than the glucose empirical formula, which is CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Except for very simple substances, molecular chemical formulas lack needed structural information, and are ambiguous.

A [[structural formula]] is a drawing that shows the location of each atom, and which atoms it binds to.

==In computing==
In [[computing]], a formula typically describes a [[calculation]], such as addition, to be performed on one or more variables. A formula is often implicitly provided in the form of a [[computer]] [[Instruction (computer science)|instruction]] such as.

: ''Degrees Celsius'' = (5/9)*(''Degrees Fahrenheit''&amp;nbsp; - 32)

In computer [[spreadsheet]] software, a formula indicating  how to compute the value of a [[cell reference|cell]], say ''A3'', would be written as

: ''=A1+A2''

where ''A1'' and ''A2'' refer to other cells (column A, row 1 or 2) within the spreadsheet. This is a shortcut for the "paper" form ''A3 = A1+A2'' where ''A3'' is, by convention, omitted because the result is always stored in the cell itself and stating its name would be redundant.

==Formulas with prescribed units==
{{Clarify section|date=March 2017}}
A [[physical quantity]] can be expressed as the product of a number and a [[Units of measurement|physical unit]].  A formula expresses a relationship between  physical quantities. A necessary condition for a formula to be valid is that all terms [[Dimensional analysis#Commensurability|have the same dimension]], meaning every term in the formula could be potentially converted to contain the identical unit (or product of identical units).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 159126099X | title = Engineering Unit Conversions, Fourth Edition | last1 = Lindeburg | first1 = Michael R. | year = 1998 | publisher = Professional Publications  | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the example of the volume of a sphere ({{math|''V'' {{=}} {{sfrac|4|3}} &amp;pi; ''r''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}) we may wish to compute with ''r'' = 2.0&amp;nbsp;cm, which yields

:&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{4}{3}\pi(2.0 \mbox{ cm})^3 \approx 33.51 \mbox{ cm}^{3}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
   To derive ''V'' ~= {{convert|33.51|cm3|cuin|abbr=on}},
   then calculate the formula for volume: 4/3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;
   3.1415926535897&amp;nbsp;&amp;times; 2.0&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
   or&amp;nbsp;~= 33.51032163829 and round to 2 decimal digits.
&lt;/ref&gt;

There is vast educational training about retaining units in computations, and converting units to a desirable form, such as in [[units conversion by factor-label]].

The vast majority of computations with measurements are done in computer programs with no facility for retaining a symbolic computation of the units.  Only the numerical quantity is used in the computation.  This requires that the universal formula be converted to a formula that is intended to be used only with prescribed units, meaning the numerical quantity is implicitly assumed to be multiplying a particular unit. The requirements about the prescribed units must be given to users of the input and the output of the formula.

For example, suppose the formula is to require that &lt;math&gt; V \equiv \mathrm{VOL}~\mathbf{tbsp}&lt;/math&gt;, where '''tbsp''' is the [[Tablespoon#Traditional definitions|US tablespoon]] and VOL is the name for the number used by the computer.  Similarly, the formula is to require
&lt;math&gt; r \equiv \mathrm{RAD}~\mathbf{cm}&lt;/math&gt;. The derivation of the formula proceeds as:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{VOL}~\mathbf{tbsp} = \frac{4}{3} \pi \mathrm{RAD}^3~ \mathbf{cm}^3.&lt;/math&gt;

Given that &lt;math&gt;1~\mathbf{tbsp} = 14.787~\mathbf{cm}^3 &lt;/math&gt;,
the formula with prescribed units is

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{VOL} \approx 0.2833~\mathrm{RAD}^3.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
   To derive VOL ~= 0.2833 RAD&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the '''tbsp''' is
   divided out as: 4/3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times; 3.1415926535897&amp;nbsp;/
   14.787 ~= 0.2832751879885 and rounded to 4 decimal digits.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The formula is not complete without words such as:
"VOL is volume in '''tbsp''' and RAD is radius in '''cm'''".
Other possible words are "VOL is the ratio of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; to '''tbsp''' and RAD is the ratio of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to '''cm'''."

The formula with prescribed units could also appear with simple symbols,
perhaps even the identical symbols as in the original dimensional formula:
: &lt;math&gt; V = 0.2833~r^3.&lt;/math&gt;
and the accompanying words could be: "where V is volume ('''tbsp''') and r is radius ('''cm''')".

If the physical formula is not dimensionally homogeneous, and therefore erroneous,
the falsehood becomes apparent in the impossibility
to derive a formula with prescribed units.  It would not be possible to
derive a formula consisting only of numbers and dimensionless ratios.

===In science===
Formulas used in science almost always require a choice of units.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 1466571144 | title = CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 94th Edition | editor1-last = Haynes | editor1-first= William M. | year = 2013 | origyear = 1914 | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton  | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Formulas are used to express relationships between various quantities, such as temperature, mass, or charge in physics; supply, profit, or demand in economics; or a wide range of other quantities in other disciplines.

An example of a formula used in science is [[Boltzmann's entropy formula]]. In [[statistical thermodynamics]], it is a probability equation relating the [[entropy]] ''S'' of an ideal gas to the quantity ''W'', which is the number of [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]] corresponding to a given [[macrostate]]:

:&lt;math&gt;S = k \cdot \log W &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (1) S= k ln W

where ''k'' is [[Boltzmann constant|Boltzmann's constant]] equal to 1.38062 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt; joule/kelvin and ''W'' is the number of [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]]s consistent with the given [[macrostate]].

'''''Formulario Mathematico''''' ([[Latino sine flexione]]:&lt;ref&gt;While Latino sine Flexione was sometimes called Interlingua, it should not be confused with modern [[Interlingua]], developed between 1924 and 1951 by the [[International Auxiliary Language Association]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Formulation of mathematics'') is a book&lt;ref&gt;
There are many editions. Here are two:
* (French) Published 1901 by Gauthier-Villars, Paris.  230p.  [https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15255022W/Formulaire_des_mathematiques OpenLibrary OL15255022W], [https://archive.org/details/formulairedesmat00pean PDF].
* (Italian) Published 1960 by Edizione cremonese, Roma. 463p.  [https://openlibrary.org/books/OL16587658M/Formulario_mathematico OpenLibrary OL16587658M].&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Giuseppe Peano]] which expresses fundamental theorems of mathematics in a symbolic language developed by Peano. The author was assisted by [[Giovanni Vailati]], [[Mario Pieri]], [[Alessandro Padoa]], [[Giovanni Vacca (mathematician)|Giovanni Vacca]], [[Vincenzo Vivanti]], [[Gino Fano]] and [[Cesare Burali-Forti]].

The ''Formulario'' was first published in 1895. The fifth and last edition was published in 1908. 

Kennedy&lt;ref name=HCK&gt;H.C. Kennedy (1980) ''Peano, Life and Works of Giuseppe Peano'', Chapter 6: The ''Formulario Project'', pages 44&amp;ndash;50, Chapter 17: Completion of the ''Formulario'', page 118&amp;ndash;24, [[D. Reidel]] {{ISBN|90-277-1067-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote "the development and use of [[mathematical logic]] is the guiding motif of the project". He also explains the variety of Peano's publication under the title:
:the five editions of the ''Formulario'' [are not] editions in the usual sense of the word. Each is essentially a new elaboration, although much material is repeated. Moreover, the title and language varied: the first three, titled ''Formulaire de Mathématiques'', and the fourth, titled, ''Formulaire Mathématique'', were written in French, while [[Latino sine flexione]], Peano's own invention, was used for the fifth edition, titled ''Formulario Mathematico''. ... Ugo Cassina lists no less than twenty separately published items as being parts of the 'complete' ''Formulario''!&lt;ref name=HCK/&gt;{{rp|45}}

Peano believed that students needed only precise statement of their lessons. He wrote:
:Each professor will be able to adopt this ''Formulario'' as a [[textbook]], for it ought to contain all theorems and all methods. His teaching will be reduced to showing how to read the formulas, and to indicating to the students the theorems that he wishes to explain in his course.&lt;ref name=HCK/&gt;{{rp|66}}
Such a dismissal of the [[oral tradition]] in lectures at universities was the undoing of Peano's own teaching career.&lt;ref name=HCK/&gt;{{rp|chapter 14}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4395">In [[proof complexity]], a '''Frege system''' is a [[propositional proof system]] whose proofs are sequences of [[propositional formula|formulas]] derived using a finite set of [[soundness|sound]] and implicationally complete [[inference rules]]. Frege systems (more often known as [[Hilbert system]]s in general [[proof theory]]) are named after [[Gottlob Frege]].

==Formal definition==
Let ''K'' be a finite [[functional completeness|functionally complete]] set of Boolean connectives, and consider [[propositional formula]]s built from variables ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... using ''K''-connectives. A Frege rule is an inference rule of the form
:&lt;math&gt;r=\frac{B_1,\dots,B_n}B,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''B'' are formulas. If ''R'' is a finite set of Frege rules, then ''F'' = (''K'',''R'') defines a derivation system in the following way. If ''X'' is a set of formulas, and ''A'' is a formula, then an ''F''-derivation of ''A'' from axioms ''X'' is a sequence of formulas ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that ''A&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''A'', and every ''A&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a member of ''X'', or it is derived from some of the formulas ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''i''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''k'', by a substitution instance of a rule from ''R''. An ''F''-proof of a formula ''A'' is an ''F''-derivation of ''A'' from the empty set of axioms (X=∅). ''F'' is called a Frege system if
*''F'' is sound: every ''F''-provable formula is a tautology.
*''F'' is implicationally complete: for every formula ''A'' and a set of formulas ''X'', if ''X'' entails ''A'', then there is an ''F''-derivation of ''A'' from ''X''.
The length (number of lines) in a proof ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''m''. The size of the proof is the total number of symbols.

A derivation system ''F'' as above is refutationally complete, if for every inconsistent set of formulas ''X'', there is an ''F''-derivation of a fixed contradiction from ''X''.

== Examples ==
* [[Frege's propositional calculus]] is a Frege system.
* There are many examples of sound Frege rules on the [[Propositional calculus]] page.
* [[Resolution (logic)|Resolution]] is not a Frege system because it only operates on clauses, not on formulas built in an arbitrary way by a functionally complete set of connectives. Moreover, it is not implicationally complete, i.e. we cannot conclude &lt;math&gt;A \lor B&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. However, adding the ''weakening'' rule: &lt;math&gt;\frac{A}{A \lor B}&lt;/math&gt; makes it implicationally complete.  Resolution is also refutationally complete.

== Properties ==
*Reckhow's theorem (1979) states that all Frege systems are [[propositional proof system#Relation with computational complexity theory|p-equivalent]].
* [[Natural deduction]] and [[sequent calculus]] (Gentzen system with cut) are also p-equivalent to Frege systems.
* There are polynomial-size Frege proofs of the [[pigeonhole principle]] (Buss 1987).
* Frege systems are considered to be fairly strong systems. Unlike, say, resolution, there are no known superlinear lower bounds on the number of lines in Frege proofs, and the best known lower bounds on the size of the proofs are quadratic.
* The minimal number of rounds in the ''prover-adversary'' game needed to prove a tautology &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the logarithm of the minimal number of steps in a Frege proof of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1961">In [[cryptography]], the '''Full Domain Hash''' ('''FDH''') is an [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]]-based [[digital signature|signature]] scheme that follows the ''hash-and-sign'' paradigm. It is [[provable security|provably secure]] (i.e., is [[existential forgery|existentially unforgeable]] under [[adaptive chosen-message attack]]s) in the [[random oracle model]]. FDH involves hashing a message using a function whose image size equals the size of the RSA modulus, and then raising the result to the secret RSA exponent.

==Exact security of full domain hash==
In the random oracle model, if RSA is &lt;math&gt;(t', \epsilon')&lt;/math&gt;-secure, then the full domain hash RSA signature scheme is &lt;math&gt;(t, \epsilon)&lt;/math&gt;-secure where,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
         t &amp;= t' - (q_\text{hash} + q_\text{sig} + 1) \cdot \mathcal{O}\left(k^3\right) \\
  \epsilon &amp;= \left(1 + \frac{1}{q_\text{sig}}\right)^{q_\text{sig} + 1} \cdot q_\text{sig} \cdot \epsilon'
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;.

For large &lt;math&gt;q_\text{sig}&lt;/math&gt; this reduces to &lt;math&gt;\epsilon \sim \exp(1)\cdot q_\text{sig} \cdot \epsilon'&lt;/math&gt;.

This means that if there exists an algorithm that can forge a new FDH signature that runs in time ''t'', computes at most &lt;math&gt;q_\text{hash}&lt;/math&gt; hashes, asks for at most &lt;math&gt;q_\text{sig}&lt;/math&gt; signatures and succeeds with probability &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, then there must also exist an algorithm that breaks RSA with probability &lt;math&gt;\epsilon'&lt;/math&gt; in time &lt;math&gt;t'&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Functional integration''' is a collection of results in [[mathematics]] and [[physics]] where the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of an [[integral]] is no longer a [[manifold|region of space]], but a [[Function space|space of functions]]. Functional integrals arise in [[probability]], in the study of [[partial differential equations]], and in the [[path integral formulation|path integral approach]] to the [[quantum mechanics]] of particles and fields.

In an [[Lebesgue integration|ordinary integral]] there is a function to be integrated (the integrand) and a region of space over which to integrate the function (the domain of integration). The process of integration consists of adding up the values of the integrand for each point of the domain of integration.  Making this procedure rigorous requires a limiting procedure, where the domain of integration is divided into smaller and smaller regions.  For each small region, the value of the integrand cannot vary much, so it may be replaced by a single value. In a functional integral the domain of integration is a space of functions.  For each function, the integrand returns a value to add up.  Making this procedure rigorous poses challenges that continue to be topics of current research.

Functional integration was developed by [[Percy John Daniell]] in an article of 1919&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Norbert Wiener]] in a series of studies culminating in his articles of 1921 on [[Brownian motion]].  They developed a rigorous method (now known as the [[Wiener measure]]) for assigning a probability to a particle's random path.  [[Richard Feynman]] developed another functional integral, the [[path integral formulation|path integral]], useful for computing the quantum properties of systems.  In Feynman's path integral, the classical notion of a unique trajectory for a particle is replaced by an infinite sum of classical paths, each weighted differently according to its classical properties.

Functional integration is central to quantization techniques in theoretical physics.  The algebraic properties of functional integrals are used to develop series used to calculate properties in [[quantum electrodynamics]] and the [[standard model]] of particle physics.

==Functional Integration==
{{Confusing|section|date=January 2014}}
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
Whereas standard Riemann integration sums a function ''f''(''x'') over a continuous range of values of ''x'', functional integration sums a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] ''G''[''f''], which can be thought of as a "function of a function" over a continuous range (or space) of functions ''f''. Most functional integrals cannot be evaluated exactly but must be evaluated using [[perturbation methods]]. The formal definition of a functional integral is

:&lt;math&gt;
\int G[f] [Df] \equiv \int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty \cdots \int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty G[f] \prod_x df(x).
&lt;/math&gt;

However, in most cases the functions ''f''(''x'') can be written in terms of an infinite series of [[orthogonal functions]] such as &lt;math&gt;f(x) = f_n H_n(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and then the definition becomes

:&lt;math&gt;
\int G[f] [Df] \equiv \int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty \cdots \int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty G(f_1, f_2, \ldots) \prod_n df_n,
&lt;/math&gt;

which is slightly more understandable. The integral is shown to be a functional integral with a capital ''D''. Sometimes it is written in square brackets: [''Df''] or ''D''[''f''], to indicate that ''f'' is a function.

==Examples==
Most functional integrals are actually infinite, but the [[quotient]] of two functional integrals can be finite.{{clarify|date=March 2017}} The functional integrals that can be solved exactly usually start with the following [[Gaussian integral]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\int e^{i \int -\frac{1}{2}f(x) \cdot K(x,y) \cdot f(y) \,dx\,dy + \int J(x) \cdot f(x) \,dx} [Df]}
     {\int e^{i \int -\frac{1}{2}f(x) \cdot K(x,y) \cdot f(y) \,dx\,dy} [Df]} =
 e^{i \frac{1}{2}\int J(x) \cdot K^{-1}(x,y) \cdot J(y) \,dx\,dy}.
&lt;/math&gt;

By functionally differentiating this with respect to ''J''(''x'') and then setting ''J'' to 0 this becomes an exponential multiplied by a polynomial in ''f''. For example, setting &lt;math&gt;K(x, y) = \Box\delta(x - y)&lt;/math&gt;, we find:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\int f(a) f(b) e^{i \int f(x) \Box f(x) \,dx^4} [Df]}
     {\int e^{i \int f(x) \Box f(x) \,dx^4} [Df]} =
 K^{-1}(a, b) = \frac{1}{|a - b|^2},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'', ''b'' and ''x'' are 4-dimensional vectors. This comes from the formula for the propagation of a photon in quantum electrodynamics. Another useful integral is the functional [[delta function]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\int e^{i \int f(x) g(x) \,dx} [Df] = \delta[g] = \prod_x\delta\big(g(x)\big),
&lt;/math&gt;

which is useful to specify constraints. Functional integrals can also be done over [[Grassmann number|Grassmann-valued]] functions &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\psi(x) \psi(y) = -\psi(y) \psi(x)&lt;/math&gt;, which is useful in quantum electrodynamics for calculations involving [[fermions]].

==Approaches to path integrals==
{{expand section|date=October 2009}}
Functional integrals where the space of integration consists of paths (''ν'' = 1) can be defined in many different ways.  The definitions fall in two different classes: the constructions derived from [[Wiener process|Wiener's theory]] yield an integral based on a [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]], whereas the constructions following Feynman's path integral do not.  Even within these two broad divisions, the integrals are not identical, that is, they are defined differently for different classes of functions.

===The Wiener integral===

In the [[Wiener process|Wiener integral]], a probability is assigned to a class of [[Brownian motion]] paths.  The class consists of the paths ''w'' that are known to go through a small region of space at a given time.  The passage through different regions of space is assumed independent of each other, and the distance between any two points of the Brownian path is assumed to be [[Normal distribution|Gaussian-distributed]] with a [[variance]] that depends on the time ''t'' and on a diffusion constant ''D'':

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr\big(w(s + t), t \,\big|\, w(s), s\big) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi D t}} \exp\left(-\frac{\|w(s+t) - w(s)\|^2}{2Dt}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The probability for the class of paths can be found by multiplying the probabilities of starting in one region and then being at the next.  The Wiener measure can be developed by considering the limit of many small regions.

'''Gregory John Chaitin''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|aɪ|t|ɪ|n}} {{respell|CHY|tin}}; born 15 November 1947) &lt;!-- Could we get a more specific place and time? --&gt; is an [[Argentina|Argentine]]-[[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] and [[computer scientist]]. Beginning in the late 1960s, Chaitin made contributions to [[algorithmic information theory]] and [[metamathematics]], in particular a computer-theoretic result equivalent to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]. He is considered to be one of the founders of what is today known as Kolmogorov (or Kolmogorov-Chaitin) complexity together with [[Andrei Kolmogorov]] and [[Ray Solomonoff]]. Today, [[algorithmic information theory]] is a common subject in any computer science curriculum. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

He attended the [[Bronx High School of Science]] and [[City College of New York]], where he (still in his teens) developed the theory that led to his independent discovery of [[Kolmogorov complexity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Li |last2=Vitanyi |title=An Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications |publisher=Springer |year=1997 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LKEmB_GQ53QC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAg#v=snippet&amp;f=false |page=92 |quote=G.J.Chaitin had finished the Bronx High School of Science, and was an 18-year-old undergraduate student at City College of the City University of New York, when he submitted two papers....

J. |title=On the Length of Programs for Computing Finite Binary Sequences |journal=Journal of the ACM |volume=13 |issue=4 |date=October 1966 |pages=547–569 |doi=10.1145/321356.321363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaitin has defined [[Chaitin's constant]] Ω, a [[real number]] whose digits are [[normal number|equidistributed]] and which is sometimes informally described as an expression of the probability that a random program will halt. Ω has the mathematical property that it is [[Definable number|definable]] but not [[computability theory (computation)|computable]].

Chaitin's early work on algorithmic information theory followed after the work of [[Solomonoff]], [[Kolmogorov]], and [[Per Martin-Löf|Martin-Löf]].

Chaitin is also the originator of using [[graph coloring]] to do [[register allocation]] in compiling, a process known as [[Chaitin's algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;G.J. Chaitin, ''Register Allocation and Spilling via Graph Coloring'', [http://www.google.com/patents/US4571678 US Patent 4,571,678] (1986) [cited from [http://ssw.jku.at/Teaching/PhDTheses/Hoflehner/index.html ''Register Allocation on the Intel® Itanium® Architecture''], p.155]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was formerly a researcher at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in New York and remains an emeritus researcher. He has written more than 10 books that have been translated to about 15 languages. He is today interested in questions of [[metabiology]] and information-theoretic formalizations of the theory of evolution.

==Other scholarly contributions==
Chaitin also writes about [[philosophy]], especially [[metaphysics]] and [[philosophy of mathematics]] (particularly about epistemological matters in mathematics). In metaphysics, Chaitin claims that [[algorithmic information theory]] is the key to solving problems in the field of [[biology]] (obtaining a formal definition of 'life', its origin and [[evolution]]) and  [[neuroscience]] (the problem of [[consciousness]] and the study of the mind).

In recent writings, he defends a position known as [[digital philosophy]]. In the [[epistemology]] of mathematics, he claims that his findings in [[mathematical logic]] and algorithmic information theory show there are "mathematical facts that are true for no reason, they're true by accident. They are random mathematical facts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ithistory.org/honor-roll/professor-gregory-john-chaitin|title=Professor Gregory John Chaitin|publisher=[[IT History Society]]|accessdate=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaitin proposes that mathematicians must abandon any hope of proving those mathematical facts and adopt a [[quasi-empirical]] methodology.

==Honors==
In 1995 he was given the degree of doctor of science ''[[honoris causa]]'' by the [[University of Maine]]. In 2002 he was given the title of honorary professor by the [[University of Buenos Aires]] in Argentina, where his parents were born and where Chaitin spent part of his youth. In 2007 he was given a [[Leibniz Medal (Wolfram Research)|Leibniz Medal]]&lt;ref&gt;Zenil, Hector "Leibniz medallion comes to life after 300 years"
[http://www.mathrix.org/liquid/archives/the-history-of-the-chaitin-leibniz-medallion ''Anima Ex Machina'', The Blog of Hector Zenil], November 3rd, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Wolfram Research]]. In 2009 he was given the degree of doctor of philosophy ''honoris causa'' by the [[National University of Córdoba]]. He was formerly a researcher at [[IBM]]'s [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]] and is now a professor at the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]].

==Criticism==
{{criticism section|date=July 2016}}&lt;!--See talk--&gt;
Some philosophers and logicians disagree with the philosophical conclusions that Chaitin has drawn from his theorems related to what Chaitin thinks is a kind of fundamental arithmetic randomness.&lt;ref&gt;Panu Raatikainen, "Exploring Randomness and The Unknowable"
[http://www.ams.org/notices/200109/rev-panu.pdf ''Notices'' of the American Mathematical Society] Book Review October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
The logician [[Torkel Franzén]] criticized Chaitin’s interpretation of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] and the alleged explanation for it that Chaitin’s work represents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Torkel |last=Franzén |authorlink=Torkel Franzén |title=Gödel's Theorem: An Incomplete Guide to its Use and Abuse |location=Wellesley, Massachusetts |publisher=[[A K Peters, Ltd.]] |year=2005 |isbn=1-56881-238-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2149">In [[non-standard analysis]], a '''hyperinteger''' ''n'' is a [[hyperreal number]] that is equal to its own integer part.  A hyperinteger may be either finite or infinite.  A finite hyperinteger is an ordinary integer.  An example of an infinite hyperinteger is given by the class of the sequence {{nowrap|(1, 2, 3, ...)}} in the [[ultrapower]] construction of the hyperreals.

==Discussion==
The standard [[integer part]] function: 
:&lt;math&gt;\lfloor x \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;
is defined for all real ''x'' and equals the greatest integer not exceeding ''x''.  By the [[transfer principle]] of non-standard analysis, there exists a natural extension: 
:&lt;math&gt;{}^*\! \lfloor \,\cdot\, \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;
defined for all hyperreal ''x'', and we say that ''x'' is a hyperinteger if: 
:&lt;math&gt; x = {}^*\! \lfloor x \rfloor .&lt;/math&gt;
Thus the hyperintegers are the image of the integer part function on the hyperreals.

==Internal sets==
The set &lt;math&gt;^*\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; of all hyperintegers is an [[internal set|internal subset]] of the hyperreal line &lt;math&gt;^*\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.  The set of all finite hyperintegers (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; itself) is not an internal subset.  Elements of the complement

:&lt;math&gt;^*\mathbb{Z}\setminus\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;

are called, depending on the author, ''non-standard'', ''unlimited'', or ''infinite'' hyperintegers. The reciprocal of an infinite hyperinteger is always an [[infinitesimal]].

Nonnegative hyperintegers are sometimes called ''hypernatural'' numbers.  Similar remarks apply to the sets &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;^*\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that the latter gives a [[non-standard model of arithmetic]] in the sense of [[Skolem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11359">In mathematics, a '''Janet basis''' is a [[canonical form|normal form]] for systems of linear homogeneous [[partial differential equation]]s (PDEs) that removes the inherent arbitrariness of any such system.  It was introduced in 1920 by [[Maurice Janet]].&lt;ref name="Janet"&gt;M. Janet, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101080166299;view=1up;seq=75 Les systèmes d'équations aux dérivées partielles], Journal de mathématiques pures et appliquées  '''8 ser., t. 3''' (1920), pages 65–123.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was first called the Janet basis by Fritz Schwarz in 1998.&lt;ref name="Schwarz1998"&gt;F. Schwarz, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=tfa7dpQf1OIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA221 "Janet Bases for Symmetry Groups"], in: ''Gröbner Bases and Applications; Lecture Notes Series'' '''251''', London Mathematical Society, pages 221–234 (1998); B. Buchberger and F. Winkler, Edts.&lt;/ref&gt;

The left hand sides of such systems of equations may be considered as differential polynomials of a ring, and Janet's normal form as a special basis of the ideal that they generate. By abuse of language, this terminology will be applied both to the original system and the ideal of differential polynomials generated by the left hand sides. A Janet basis is the predecessor of a [[Gröbner basis]] introduced by [[Bruno Buchberger]]&lt;ref name="Buchberger"&gt;B. Buchberger, Ein algorithmisches Kriterium fuer die Loesbarkeit eines algebraischen Gleichungssystems, Aequ. Math. '''4''', 374–383(1970).&lt;/ref&gt; for polynomial ideals. In order to generate a Janet basis for any given system of linear pde's a ranking of its derivatives must be provided; then the corresponding Janet basis is unique. If a system of linear pde's is given in terms of a Janet basis its differential dimension may easily be determined; it is a measure for the degree of indeterminacy of its general solution. In order to generate a [[Loewy decomposition]] of a system of linear pde's its Janet basis must be determined first.

== Generating a Janet basis ==

Any system of linear homogeneous pde's is highly non-unique, e.g. an arbitrary linear combination of its elements may be added to the system without changing its solution set. A priori it is not known whether it has any nontrivial solutions. More generally, the degree of arbitrariness of its general solution is not known, i.e. how many undetermined constants or functions it may contain. These questions were the starting point of Janet's work; he considered systems of linear pde's in any number of dependent and independent variables and generated a normal form for them. Here mainly linear pde's in the plane with the coordinates &lt;math&gt; x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; y&lt;/math&gt; will be considered; the number of unknown functions is one or two. Most results described here may be generalized in an obvious way to any number of variables or functions.&lt;ref name="Schwarz2007"&gt;F. Schwarz, Algorithmic Lie Theory for Solving Linear Ordinary Differential Equations, Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC, 2007 Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PleskenRobertz"&gt;W. Plesken, D. Robertz, Janet's approach to presentations and resolutions for polynomials and linear pdes, Archiv der Mathematik '''84''', pages 22–37, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oaku"&gt;T. Oaku, T. Shimoyama, A Gröbner Basis Method for Modules over Rings of Differential Operators, Journal of Symbolic Computation '''18''', pages 223–248, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to generate a unique representation for a given system of linear pde's, at first a ranking of its derivatives must be defined.

'''Definition'''
A ranking of derivatives is a total ordering such that for any two derivatives &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\delta_1&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;\delta_2&lt;/math&gt;, and any derivation operator &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; the relations &lt;math&gt;\delta\leq\theta\delta&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;\delta_1\leq\delta_2\rightarrow\delta\delta_1\leq\delta\delta_2&lt;/math&gt; are valid.

A derivative &lt;math&gt;\delta_2&lt;/math&gt; is called ''higher'' than &lt;math&gt;\delta_1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\delta_2&gt;\delta_1&lt;/math&gt;. The highest
derivative in an equation is called its ''leading derivative''. For the derivatives up to order two of a single function &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; depending on &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; two possible order are
: the &lt;math&gt;LEX&lt;/math&gt; order &lt;math&gt; z_{xx}&gt;z_{xy}&gt;z_x&gt;z_{yy}&gt;z_y&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;GRLEX&lt;/math&gt; order &lt;math&gt;z_{xx}&gt;z_{xy}&gt;z_{yy}&gt;z_x&gt;z_y&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;.

Here the usual notation &lt;math&gt;\partial_xz=z_x, \partial_yz=z_y,\ldots &lt;/math&gt; is used. If the number of functions is higher than one, these orderings have to be generalized appropriately, e.g. the orderings &lt;math&gt;TOP&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;POT&lt;/math&gt; may be applied.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;W. Adams, P. Loustaunau, An introduction to Gröbner bases, [[American Mathematical Society]], Providence, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first basic operation to be applied in generating a Janet basis is the ''reduction'' of an equation &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; [[wikt:WRT|w.r.t.]] another one &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt;. In colloquial terms this means the following: Whenever a derivative of &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; may be
obtained from the leading derivative of &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt; by suitable differentiation, this differentiation is performed and the
result is subtracted from &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt;. Reduction w.r.t. a system of pde's means reduction w.r.t. all elements of the system. A system of linear pde's is called ''autoreduced'' if all possible reductions have been performed.

The second basic operation for generating a Janet basis is the inclusion  of ''integrability conditions''. They are obtained
as follows: If two equations &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt; are such that by suitable differentiations two new equations
may be obtained with like leading derivatives, by cross-multiplication with its leading coefficients and subtraction of the resulting equations a new equation is obtained, it is called an integrability condition. If by reduction w.r.t. the remaining equations of the system it does not vanish it is included as a new equation to the system.

It may be shown that repeating these operations always terminates after a finite number of steps with a unique answer which is called the Janet basis for the input system. Janet has organized them in terms of the following algorithm.

'''Janet's Algorithm''' Given a system of linear differential polynomials  &lt;math&gt;S\equiv\{e_1,e_2,\ldots \}&lt;/math&gt;, the Janet basis corresponding to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is returned.

: S1: (''Autoreduction'') Assign &lt;math&gt;S:=\operatorname{Autoreduce}(S)&lt;/math&gt;

: S2: (''Completion'') Assign &lt;math&gt; S:=\operatorname{CompleteSystem}(S)&lt;/math&gt;

: S3: (''Integrability conditions'') Find all pairs of leading terms &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_j&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;e_j&lt;/math&gt; such that differentiation w.r.t. a nonmultiplier &lt;math&gt;x_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; and multipliers  &lt;math&gt;x_{j_1},\ldots,x_{j_l}&lt;/math&gt; leads to

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial v_i}{\partial x_{i_k}}=\frac{\partial^{p_1+\cdots+p_l}v_j}
 {\partial x_{j_1}^{p_1}\cdots \partial x_{j_l}^{p_l}}&lt;/math&gt;

and determine the integrability conditions

::&lt;math&gt;c_{i,j} =\operatorname{Lcoef}(e_j)\cdot
    \frac{\partial e_i}{\partial x_{i_k}}-\operatorname{Lcoef}(e_i)\cdot
   \frac{\partial^{p_1+\cdots+p_l}e_j}
 {\partial x_{j_1}^{p_1}\cdots \partial x_{j_l}^{p_l}}&lt;/math&gt;

: S4: (''Reduction of integrability conditions''). For all &lt;math&gt;c_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; assign &lt;math&gt;c_{i,j}:=\operatorname{Reduce}(c_{i,j},S)&lt;/math&gt;

: S5: (''Termination?'') If all &lt;math&gt;c_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; are zero return &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, otherwise make the assignment &lt;math&gt;S:=S\cup\{c_{i,j}\mid c_{i,j}\neq 0\}&lt;/math&gt;, reorder &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; properly and goto S1

Here &lt;math&gt;Autoreduce&lt;/math&gt; is a subalgorithm that returns its argument with all possible reductions performed, &lt;math&gt;Completion&lt;/math&gt; adds certain equations to the system in order to facilitate determining the integrability conditions. To this
end the variables are divides into ''multipliers'' and ''non-multipliers''; details may be found in the above references. Upon successful termination a Janet basis for the input system will be returned.

'''Example 1''' Let the system &lt;math&gt;\left\{e_1\equiv z_{xy}-\frac{x^2}{y^2}z_x-\frac{x-y}{y^2}z=0, e_2\equiv z_x+\frac{1}{x}z_y+xz=0\right\}&lt;/math&gt; be given with ordering &lt;math&gt; GRLEX&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.  Step S1 returns the autoreduced system

: &lt;math&gt; \left\{e_3\equiv z_{yy}+\frac 1 {y^2}(xy^3-x^2-y)z_y-\frac 1 y (x^3-x+y)z=0, e_2=z_x+\frac 1 y z_y+xz=0\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Steps S3 and S4 generate the integrability condition &lt;math&gt;c_{3,2}\equiv\frac{\partial e_3}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial^2e_2}{\partial y^2}&lt;/math&gt; and reduces it to &lt;math&gt;z=0&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the Janet basis for the originally given system is &lt;math&gt;\{z=0\}&lt;/math&gt; with the trivial solution &lt;math&gt;z=0&lt;/math&gt;.

The next example involves two unknown functions &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, both depending on &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example 2''' Consider the system

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Big\{ &amp; f_1 \equiv w_{xx}-2z_{xy}-\frac{1}{2x}w_x+\frac{1}{2x^2}w=0, f_2\equiv w_{xy}-\frac{1}{2}z_{yy}-\frac{1}{2x}w_y-6x^2z_x, \\[5pt]
&amp; f_3\equiv w_{yy}+4x^2w_x-8x^2z_y-8xw=0, f_4\equiv z_{xx}+\frac{1}{2x}z_x=0\Big\}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

in &lt;math&gt;GRLEX, w&gt;z,x&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; ordering. The system is already autoreduced, i.e. step S1 returns it unchanged. Step S3 generates the two integrability conditions

::&lt;math&gt;c_{1,2}\equiv\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x}\text{ and }c_{2,3}\equiv\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial f_3}{\partial x}.&lt;/math&gt;

Upon reduction in step S4 they are

::&lt;math&gt;c_{1,2}=z_{xyy}-6xz_x=0, c_{2,3}=z_{yyy}+3x^2z_{xy}-24xz_y-12w=0.&lt;/math&gt;

In step S5 they are included into the system and the algorithms starts again with step S1 with the extended system. After a few more iterations finally the Janet basis

::&lt;math&gt;\left\{z_y+\frac 1 {2x}w=0,z_x=0,w_y=0,w_x-\frac 1 x w=0\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

is obtained. It yields the general solution &lt;math&gt;z=C_1-C_2x, w=2C_2y&lt;/math&gt; with two undetermined constants &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;.

== Application of Janet bases ==

The most important application of a Janet basis is its use for deciding the degree of indeterminacy of a system of linear homogeneous partial differential equations. The answer in the above Example 1 is that the system under consideration allows only the trivial solution. In the second Example 2 a two-dimensional solution space is obtained. In general, the answer may be more involved, there may be infinitely many free constants in the general solution; they may be obtained from the Loewy decomposition of the respective Janet basis.&lt;ref name="Schwarz2013"&gt;F. Schwarz, Loewy Decomposition of Linear Differential Equations, Springer, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Janet basis of a module allows to read off a Janet basis for the syzygy module.&lt;ref name="PleskenRobertz" /&gt;

Janet's algorithm has been implemented in Maple.&lt;ref name="ZhangLi"&gt;S. Zhang, Z. Li, An Implementation for the Algorithm of Janet bases of Linear Differential Ideals in the Maple System, Acta Mathematicae Applicatae Sinica, English Series, '''20''', pages 605–616 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and early life==
Conway was born in [[Liverpool]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/680/000082434/ |title=John Conway |publisher=www.nndb.com |accessdate=10 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Cyril Horton Conway and Agnes Boyce.&lt;ref name=mactutor/&gt; He became interested in mathematics at a very early age; his mother has recalled that he could recite the powers of two when he was four years old.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} By the age of eleven his ambition was to become a mathematician.

After leaving sixth form, Conway entered [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]]&lt;ref name="whoswho"/&gt; to study mathematics. Conway, who was a "terribly introverted adolescent" in school, interpreted his admission to Cambridge as an opportunity to transform himself into a new person: an "extrovert".&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Siobhan|authorlink=Siobhan Roberts|title=John Horton Conway: the world's most charismatic mathematician|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/23/john-horton-conway-the-most-charismatic-mathematician-in-the-world|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ronan2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Mark Ronan]]|title=Symmetry and the Monster: One of the greatest quests of mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wDjD0PowhIwC&amp;pg=PT163|date=18 May 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|isbn=978-0-19-157938-7|pages=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1959 and began to undertake research in number theory supervised by [[Harold Davenport]]. Having solved the open problem posed by Davenport on [[Waring's problem|writing numbers as the sums of fifth powers]], Conway began to become interested in infinite ordinals. It appears that his interest in games began during his years studying the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos]], where he became an avid [[backgammon]] player, spending hours playing the game in the common room. He was awarded his doctorate in 1964 and was appointed as College Fellow and Lecturer in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.

After leaving Cambridge in 1986, he took up the appointment to the [[John von Neumann]] Chair of Mathematics at Princeton University.

==Conway's Game of Life==
{{Main|Conway's Game of Life}}
[[File:Gospers glider gun.gif|thumb|right|A single [[Bill Gosper|Gosper]]'s [[Gun (cellular automaton)|Glider Gun]] creating "[[Glider (Conway's Life)|gliders]]" in [[Conway's Game of Life]]]]
Conway is especially known for the invention of the Game of Life, one of the early examples of a [[cellular automaton]]. His initial experiments in that field were done with pen and paper, long before personal computers existed.

Since the game was introduced by Martin Gardner in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=Mathematical Games: The fantastic combinations of John Conway's new solitaire game "Life"|first=Martin|last=Gardner|magazine=Scientific American|volume=223|date=October 1970|pages=120–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has spawned hundreds of computer programs, web sites, and articles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Artificial_Life/Cellular_Automata/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life DMOZ: Conway's Game of Life: Sites]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a staple of recreational mathematics. There is an extensive [[wiki]] devoted to curating and cataloging the various aspects of the game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Main_Page LifeWiki]&lt;/ref&gt; From the earliest days it has been a favorite in computer labs, both for its theoretical interest and as a practical exercise in programming and data display. At times Conway has said he hates the Game of Life–largely because it has come to overshadow some of the other deeper and more important things he has done.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8kUJL04ELA Does John Conway hate his Game of Life?] (video)&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the game did help launch a new branch of mathematics, the field of [[cellular automata]].&lt;ref&gt;MacTutor History: The game made Conway instantly famous, but it also opened up a whole new field of mathematical research, the field of cellular automata.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Game of Life is now known to be [[Turing completeness|Turing complete]].&lt;ref&gt;Rendell (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=case&gt;Case (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conway and Martin Gardner==
Conway's career is intertwined with mathematics popularizer and ''[[Scientific American]]'' columnist [[Martin Gardner]]. When Gardner featured Conway's Game of Life in his [[Mathematical Games column]] in October 1970, it became the most widely read of all his columns and made Conway an instant celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29688355 Martin Gardner, puzzle master extraordinaire]'' by [[Colm Mulcahy]], [[BBC News Magazine]], 21 October 2014: "The Game of Life appeared in Scientific American in 1970, and was by far the most successful of Gardner's columns, in terms of reader response."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-top-10-martin-gardner-scientific-american-articles/ The Top 10 Martin Gardner Scientific American Articles]&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner and Conway had first corresponded in the late 1950s, and over the years Gardner had frequently written about recreational aspects of Conway's work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathfactor.uark.edu/2010/06/ha-conway-on-gardner/ The Math Factor Podcast Website] John H. Conway reminisces on his long friendship and collaboration with Martin Gardner.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, he discussed Conway's game of [[Sprouts (game)|Sprouts]] (Jul 1967), [[Hackenbush]] (Jan 1972), and his [[Angel problem|angel and devil problem]] (Feb 1974). In the September 1976 column he reviewed Conway's book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' and introduced the public to Conway's [[surreal numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gardner, ''Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor Ciphers'', W. H. Freeman &amp; Co., 1989, {{ISBN|0-7167-1987-8}}, Chapter 4. A non-technical overview; reprint of the 1976 Scientific American article.&lt;/ref&gt; Conferences called [[Gathering 4 Gardner]] are held every two years to celebrate the legacy of Martin Gardner, and Conway himself has often been a featured speaker at these events, discussing various aspects of recreational mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html Presentation Videos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809042801/http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html |date=9 August 2016 }} from 2014 Gathering 4 Gardner&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= bellos&gt;Bellos, Alex (2008).

==Major areas of research==

===Combinatorial game theory===
Conway is widely known for his contributions to [[combinatorial game theory]] (CGT), a theory of [[partisan game]]s. This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.

He is also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.

He invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novel by [[Donald Knuth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995&lt;/ref&gt; He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.

===Geometry===
In the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], son of [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]]. Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].

In the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.&lt;ref name=rhoads&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377042704002195 | doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329–353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].

===Geometric topology===
In knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]&lt;/ref&gt; After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings [Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118].

===Group theory===
He was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].&lt;ref name=harris&gt;Harris (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].

Based on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics–[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science&lt;/ref&gt;

Conway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]] to 13 points.

===Number theory===
As a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that in which every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers, each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before the work could be published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Algebra===
Conway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Conway and Smith (2003): "Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions."&lt;/ref&gt;  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis===
He invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].

===Algorithmics===
For [[calculating the day of the week]], he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway can usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practices his calendrical calculations on his computer, which is programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logs on. One of his early books was on [[finite state machine]]s.

===Theoretical physics===
In 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the '[[Hidden variable theory|no hidden variables]]' principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: "if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem]'' by Jasvir Nagra&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==
Conway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),&lt;ref name="LMS Prizewinners"&gt;
[https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners London Mathematical Society Prizewinners]&lt;/ref&gt; was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),&lt;ref name=royal/&gt; was the first recipient of the [[Pólya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),&lt;ref name="LMS Prizewinners"/&gt; won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P. Steele Prize]] for Mathematical Exposition (2000) of the [[American Mathematical Society]].
His nomination, in 1981, reads: {{quote|A versatile mathematician who combines a deep combinatorial insight with algebraic virtuosity, particularly in the construction and manipulation of "off-beat" algebraic structures which illuminate a wide variety of problems in completely unexpected ways. He has made distinguished contributions to the theory of finite groups, to the theory of knots, to mathematical logic (both set theory and automata theory) and to the theory of games (as also to its practice).&lt;ref name=royal/&gt;}}

In 2017 Conway was given honorary membership of the (British) [[Mathematical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.m-a.org.uk/honorary-members]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karl Wilhelm von Feuerbach''' (30 May 1800 &amp;ndash; 12 March 1834) was a German [[geometer]] and the son of legal scholar [[Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach]], and the brother of philosopher [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]. After receiving his doctorate at age 22, he became a professor of [[mathematics]] at the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] at [[Erlangen]]. In 1822 he wrote a small book on mathematics noted mainly for a theorem on the [[nine-point circle]], which is now known as [[Feuerbach's theorem]]. In 1827 he introduced [[homogeneous coordinates]], independently of [[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sfabel.tripod.com/mathematik/database/Feuerbach.html M20 Mathematik LK Facharbeit: Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15737">In the mathematical theory of [[matroid]]s, a '''minor''' of a matroid ''M'' is another matroid ''N'' that is obtained from ''M'' by a sequence of restriction and contraction operations. Matroid minors are closely related to [[graph minor]]s, and the restriction and contraction operations by which they are formed correspond to edge deletion and edge contraction operations in graphs. The theory of matroid minors leads to structural decompositions of matroids, and characterizations of matroid families by forbidden minors, analogous to the corresponding theory in graphs.

==Definitions==
If ''M'' is a matroid on the set ''E'' and ''S'' is a subset of ''E'', then the restriction of ''M'' to ''S'', written ''M''&amp;nbsp;|''S'', is the matroid on the set ''S'' whose independent sets are the independent sets of ''M'' that are contained in ''S''.  Its circuits are the circuits of ''M'' that are contained in ''S'' and its [[matroid rank|rank function]] is that of ''M'' restricted to subsets of ''S''.

If ''T'' is an independent subset of ''E'', the contraction of ''M'' by ''T'', written ''M''/''T'', is the matroid on the underlying set ''E &amp;minus; T'' whose independent sets are the sets whose union with ''T'' is independent in ''M''. This definition may be extended to arbitrary ''T'' by choosing a basis for ''T'' and defining a set to be independent in the contraction if its union with this basis remains independent in ''M''. The rank function of the contraction is &lt;math&gt;r'(A) = r(A \cup T) - r(T).&lt;/math&gt;

A matroid ''N'' is a minor of a matroid ''M'' if it can be constructed from ''M'' by restriction and contraction operations.

In terms of the [[geometric lattice]] formed by the flats of a matroid, taking a minor of a matroid corresponds to taking an interval of the lattice, the part of the lattice lying between a given lower bound and upper bound element.{{sfnp|Welsh|2010}}

==Forbidden matroid characterizations==
Many important families of matroids are closed under the operation of taking minors: if a matroid ''M'' belongs to the family, then every minor of ''M'' also belongs to the family. In this case, the family may be characterized by its set of "forbidden matroids", the minor-minimal matroids that do not belong to the family. A matroid belongs to the family if and only if it does not have a forbidden matroid as a minor. Often, but not always, the set of forbidden matroids is finite, paralleling the [[Robertson–Seymour theorem]] which states that the set of forbidden minors of a minor-closed graph family is always finite.

An example of this phenomenon is given by the [[regular matroid]]s, matroids that are representable over all fields. Equivalently a matroid is regular if it can be represented by a [[totally unimodular matrix]] (a matrix whose square submatrices all have determinants equal to 0, 1, or &amp;minus;1). {{harvtxt|Tutte|1958}} proved that a matroid is regular if and only if it does not have one of three forbidden minors: the [[uniform matroid]] &lt;math&gt;U{}^2_4&lt;/math&gt; (the four-point line), the [[Fano plane]], or the [[dual matroid]] of the Fano plane. For this he used his difficult [[Tutte homotopy theorem|homotopy theorem]].  Simpler proofs have since been found.

The [[graphic matroid]]s, matroids whose independent sets are the forest subgraphs of a graph, have five forbidden minors: the three for the regular matroids, and the two duals of the graphic matroids for the graphs ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt; that by [[Wagner's theorem]] are forbidden minors for the [[planar graph]]s.

The [[binary matroid]]s, matroids representable over the two-element [[finite field]], include both graphic and regular matroids. Tutte again showed that these matroids have a forbidden minor characterization: they are the matroids that do not have the four-point line as a minor. [[Rota's conjecture|Rota conjectured]] that, for any finite field, the matroids representable over that field have finitely many forbidden minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rota|1971}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A full proof of this conjecture has been announced by Geelen, Gerards, and Whittle;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Solving Rota's conjecture|journal=Notices of the American Mathematical Society|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201407/rnoti-p736.pdf|date=Aug 17, 2014|pages=736–743}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2015|lc=y}} it has not appeared.  However, the matroids that can be represented over the [[real number]]s have infinitely many forbidden minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Vámos|1978}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Branchwidth==
[[Branch-decomposition]]s of matroids may be defined analogously to their definition for graphs.
A branch-decomposition of a matroid is a [[hierarchical clustering]] of the matroid elements, represented as an unrooted binary tree with the elements of the matroid at its leaves. Removing any edge of this tree partitions the matroids into two disjoint subsets; such a partition is called an e-separation. If ''r'' denotes the rank function of the matroid, then the width of an e-separation is defined as {{nowrap|''r''(''A'') + ''r''(''B'') &amp;minus; ''r''(''M'') + 1}}. The width of a decomposition is the maximum width of any of its e-separations, and the branchwidth of a matroid is the minimum width of any of its branch-decompositions.

The branchwidth of a graph and the branchwidth of the corresponding [[graphic matroid]] may differ: for instance, the three-edge [[path graph]] and the three-edge [[star (graph theory)|star]] have different branchwidths, 2 and 1 respectively, but they both induce the same graphic matroid with branchwidth 1.&lt;ref name="mt07"/&gt; However, for graphs that are not trees, the branchwidth of the graph is equal to the branchwidth of its associated graphic matroid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mazoit|Thomassé|2007}}; {{harvtxt|Hicks|McMurray|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The branchwidth of a matroid always equals the branchwidth of its dual.&lt;ref name="mt07"&gt;{{harvtxt|Mazoit|Thomassé|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Branchwidth is an important component of attempts to extend the theory of graph minors to matroids: although [[treewidth]] can also be generalized to matroids,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hliněný|Whittle|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and plays a bigger role than branchwidth in the theory of graph minors, branchwidth has more convenient properties in the matroid setting.&lt;ref name="ggw06"&gt;{{harvtxt|Geelen|Gerards|Whittle|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
If a minor-closed family of matroids representable over a finite field does not include the graphic matroids of all planar graphs, then there is a constant bound on the branchwidth of the matroids in the family, generalizing similar results for minor-closed graph families.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Geelen|Gerards|Whittle|2006}}; {{harvtxt|Geelen|Gerards|Whittle|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Well-quasi-ordering==
The [[Robertson–Seymour theorem]] implies that every matroid property of ''graphic'' matroids characterized by a list of forbidden minors can be characterized by a finite list. Another way of saying the same thing is that the [[partial order]] on graphic matroids formed by the minor operation is a [[well-quasi-ordering]]. However, the example of the real-representable matroids, which have infinitely many forbidden minors, shows that the minor ordering is not a well-quasi-ordering on all matroids.

Robertson and Seymour conjectured that the matroids representable over any particular [[finite field]] are well-quasi-ordered. So far this has been proven only for the matroids of bounded branchwidth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Geelen|Gerards|Whittle|2002}}; {{harvtxt|Geelen|Gerards|Whittle|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Matroid decompositions==
The [[graph structure theorem]] is an important tool in the theory of graph minors, according to which the graphs in any minor-closed family can be built up from simpler graphs by [[clique-sum]] operations. Some analogous results are also known in matroid theory. In particular, [[Seymour's decomposition theorem]] states that all regular matroids can be built up in a simple way as the clique-sum of graphic matroids, their duals, and one special 10-element matroid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Seymour|1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a consequence, [[linear program]]s defined by totally unimodular matrices may be solved combinatorially by combining the solutions to a set of [[minimum spanning tree]] problems corresponding to the graphic and co-graphic parts of this decomposition.

==Algorithms and complexity==
One of the important components of graph minor theory is the existence of an algorithm for testing whether a graph ''H'' is a minor of another graph ''G'', taking an amount of time that is polynomial in ''G'' for any fixed choice of ''H'' (and more strongly [[parameterized complexity#FPT|fixed-parameter tractable]] if the size of ''H'' is allowed to vary). By combining this result with the Robertson–Seymour theorem, it is possible to recognize the members of any minor-closed graph family in [[polynomial time]]. Correspondingly, in matroid theory, it would be desirable to develop efficient algorithms for recognizing whether a given fixed matroid is a minor of an input matroid. Unfortunately, such a strong result is not possible: in the [[matroid oracle]] model, the only minors that can be recognized in polynomial time are the [[uniform matroid]]s with rank or corank one.{{sfnp|Seymour|Walton|1981}} However, if the problem is restricted to the matroids that are representable over some fixed finite field (and represented as a matrix over that field) then, as in the graph case, it is conjectured to be possible to recognize the matroids that contain any fixed minor in polynomial time.&lt;ref name="ggw06"/&gt;

In [[computer science]], and more specifically in [[computability theory (computer science)|computability theory]] and [[computational complexity theory]], a '''model of computation''' is a model which describes how a set of outputs are computed given a set of inputs. This model describes how units of computations, memories, and communications are organized. The [[computational complexity]] of an [[algorithm]] can be measured given a model of computation. Using a model allows studying the performance of algorithms independently of the variations that are specific to particular [[implementation]]s and specific technology.

==Models==
Models of computation can be classified in three categories: sequential models, functional models, and concurrent models.

Sequential models include:
* [[Finite state machine]]s
* [[Pushdown automata]]
* [[Turing Machine]]

Functional models include:
* [[Lambda calculus]]
* [[μ-recursive function|Recursive functions]]
* [[Combinatory logic]]
* [[Cellular automaton]]
* [[Abstract rewriting system]]s

Concurrent models include:
* [[Kahn process networks]]
* [[Petri nets]]
* [[Synchronous Data Flow]]
* [[Interaction nets]]
* [[Actor model]]

==Uses==
In the field of runtime [[analysis of algorithms]], it is common to specify a  computational model in terms of ''primitive operations'' allowed which have unit cost, or simply '''unit-cost operations'''. A commonly used example is the [[random access machine]], which has unit cost for read and write access to all of its memory cells. In this respect, it differs from the above-mentioned Turing machine model.

In ''[[model-driven engineering]]'', the model of computation explains how the behaviour of the whole system is the result of the behaviour of each of its components.

A key point which is often overlooked is that published lower bounds for problems are often given for a model of computation that is more restricted than the set of operations that one could use in practice and therefore there may be algorithms that are faster than what would naïvely be thought possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/608/examples-of-the-price-of-abstraction Examples of the price of abstraction?], cstheory.stackexchange.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
There are many models of computation, differing in the set of admissible operations and their computations cost. They fall into the following broad categories: [[abstract machine]] and models equivalent to it (e.g. [[lambda calculus]] is equivalent to the [[Turing machine]]), used in proofs of computability and upper bounds on computational complexity of algorithms, and [[decision tree model]]s, used in proofs of lower bounds on computational complexity of algorithmic problems.

'''Nachman Aronszajn''' (26 July 1907 – 5 February 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2004 |title=Biographisch-literarisches Handwörterbuch der exakten Naturwissenschaften |location= |publisher=Wiley |isbn=3-527-40330-2 |page=32 |editor-first=Heidi |editor-last=Kühn }}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Polish American]] [[mathematician]]. Aronszajn's main field of study was [[mathematical analysis]]. He also contributed to [[mathematical logic]].

==Life==
An [[Ashkenazi Jew]], Aronszajn received his Ph.D. from the [[University of Warsaw]], in 1930, in [[Poland]]. [[Stefan Mazurkiewicz]] was his thesis advisor. He also received a Ph.D. from [[Paris University]], in 1935; this time [[Maurice Fréchet]] was his thesis advisor. He joined the [[Oklahoma State University–Stillwater|Oklahoma A&amp;M]] faculty, but moved to the [[University of Kansas]] in 1951 with his colleague Ainsley Diamond after Diamond, a [[Quaker]], was fired for refusing to sign a newly instituted loyalty oath.&lt;ref name="magill"&gt;{{citation|first=K.

He was a Summerfield Distinguished Scholar from 1964 to his death.

==Work==
He introduced, together with [[Prom Panitchpakdi]], the [[injective metric space]]s under the name of "hyperconvex metric spaces". Together with Kennan T. Smith, Aronszajn offered proof of the [[Aronszajn–Smith theorem]]. Also, the existence of [[Aronszajn trees]] was proven by Aronszajn; [[Aronszajn line]]s, also named after him, are the lexicographic orderings of Aronszajn trees.

He also made a contribution to the theory of [[reproducing kernel Hilbert space]]. The [[Reproducing kernel Hilbert space#Moore-Aronszajn Theorem|Moore–Aronszajn theorem]] is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Nachman |last=Aronszajn |title=Theory of Reproducing Kernels |journal=Transactions of the American Mathematical Society |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=337–404 |year=1950 |doi=10.2307/1990404|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA296533 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7029">In [[theoretical computer science]], '''nondeterministic constraint logic''' is a combinatorial system in which an [[orientation (graph theory)|orientation]] is given to the edges of a weighted [[undirected graph]], subject to certain constraints. One can change this orientation by steps in which a single edge is reversed, subject to the same constraints. It is [[PSPACE-complete]] to determine whether there exists a sequence of moves that reverses a specified edge.

This is a form of [[reversible computing|reversible logic]] in that each sequence of edge orientation changes can be undone. The hardness of this problem has been used to prove that many games and puzzles have high [[game complexity]].

==Constraint graphs==
[[File:Constraint logic and gate.gif|thumb|An AND gate in constraint logic. As the minimum in-degree of the node is 2, the top edge can be out if and only if the two bottom edges are in.]]
In the simplest version of nondeterministic constraint logic, each edge of an undirected graph has weight either one or two. (The weights may also be represented graphically by drawing edges of weight one as red and edges of weight two as blue.) The graph is required to be a [[cubic graph]]: each vertex is incident to three edges, and additionally each vertex should be incident to an even number of red edges.&lt;ref name="hd05"&gt;{{citation

The edges are required to be oriented in such a way that at least two units of weight are oriented towards each vertex: there must be either at least one incoming blue edge, or at least two incoming red edges. An orientation can change by steps in which a single edge is reversed, respecting these constraints.&lt;ref name="hd05"/&gt;

More general forms of nondeterministic constraint logic allow a greater variety of edge weights, more edges per vertex, and different thresholds for how much incoming weight each vertex must have.
A graph with a system of edge weights and vertex thresholds is called a ''constraint graph''. The restricted case where the edge weights are all one or two, the vertices require two units of incoming weight, and the vertices all have three incident edges with an even number of red edges, are called ''and/or constraint graphs''.&lt;ref name="hd05"/&gt;

The reason for the name ''and/or constraint graphs'' is that the two possible types of vertex in an and/or constraint graph behave in some ways like an [[AND gate]] and [[OR gate]] in [[Boolean logic]]. A vertex with two red edges and one blue edge behaves like an AND gate in that it requires both red edges to point inwards before the blue edge can be made to point outwards. A vertex with three blue edges behaves like an OR gate, with two of its edges designated as inputs and the third as an output, in that it requires at least one input edge to point inwards before the output edge can be made to point outwards.&lt;ref name="hd05"/&gt;

==Hard problems==
The following problems, on and/or constraint graphs and their orientations, are PSPACE-complete:&lt;ref name="hd05"/&gt;
*Given an orientation and a specified edge {{mvar|e}}, testing whether there is a sequence of steps from the given orientation that eventually reverses edge&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|e}}.
*Testing whether one orientation can be changed into another one by a sequence of steps.
*Given two edges {{mvar|e}} and {{mvar|f}} with specified directions, testing whether there are two orientations for the whole graph, one having the specified direction on {{mvar|e}} and the other having the specified direction on {{mvar|f}}, that can be transformed into each other by a sequence of steps.
The proof that these problems are hard involves a [[Reduction (complexity)|reduction]] from [[True quantified Boolean formula|quantified Boolean formula]]s, based on the logical interpretation of and/or constraint graphs. It requires additional [[Gadget (computer science)|gadget]]s for simulating [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s and for converting signals carried on red edges into signals carried on blue edges (or vice versa), which can all be accomplished by combinations of and-vertices and or-vertices.&lt;ref name="hd05"/&gt;

These problems remain PSPACE-complete even for and/or constraint graphs that form [[planar graph]]s. The proof of this involves the construction of crossover gadgets that allow two independent signals to cross each other. It is also possible to impose an additional restriction, while preserving the hardness of these problems: each vertex with three blue edges can be required to be part of a triangle with a red edge. Such a vertex is called a ''protected or'', and it has the property that (in any valid orientation of the whole graph) it is not possible for both of the blue edges in the triangle to be directed inwards. This restriction makes it easier to simulate these vertices in hardness reductions for other problems.&lt;ref name="hd05"/&gt; Additionally, the contraint graphs can be required to have bounded [[Graph bandwidth|bandwidth]], and the problems on them will still remain PSPACE-complete.&lt;ref name="vdz"&gt;{{citation

 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The original applications of nondeterministic constraint logic used it to prove the PSPACE-completeness of [[sliding block puzzle]]s such as [[Rush Hour (board game)|Rush Hour]] and [[Sokoban]]. To do so, one needs only to show how to simulate edges and edge orientations, and vertices, and protected or vertices in these puzzles.&lt;ref name="hd05"/&gt;

Nondeterministic constraint logic has also been used to prove the hardness of reconfiguration versions of classical graph optimization problems including the [[independent set (graph theory)|independent set]], [[vertex cover]], and [[dominating set]], on planar graphs of bounded bandwidth. In these problems, one must change one solution to the given problem into another, by moving one vertex at a time into or out of the solution set while maintaining the property that at all times the remaining vertices form a solution.&lt;ref name="vdz"/&gt;

In [[mathematics]], in particular [[algebraic topology]], a ''p''-'''compact group''' is (roughly speaking) a space that is a [[homotopical]] version of a [[compact Lie group]], but with all the structure concentrated at a single [[prime number|prime]] ''p''. This concept was introduced by Dwyer and Wilkerson.&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Dwyer and C. W. Wilkerson, Homotopy fixed-point methods for Lie groups and finite loop spaces, Ann. of Math. (2) 139 (1994), no. 2, 395–442.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently the name '''homotopy Lie group''' has also been used.

==Examples==

Examples include the [[p-completion]] of a compact and connected Lie group, and the [[Sullivan sphere]]s, i.e. the ''p''-completion of a [[sphere]] of dimension

:2''n'' &amp;minus; 1,

if ''n'' divides ''p'' &amp;minus; 1.

==Classification==

The classification of p-compact groups states that there is a 1-1 correspondence between connected p-compact groups, and [[root data]] over the [[p-adic integers]]. This is analogous to the classical classification of connected compact Lie groups, with the p-adic integers replacing the [[rational integer]]s.

A '''P system''' is a computational [[Model (abstract)|model]] in the field of [[computer science]] that performs [[calculation]]s using a biologically-inspired process. They are based upon the structure of biological [[cell (biology)|cells]], abstracting from the way in which [[chemical substance|chemicals]] interact and cross [[cell membranes]]. The concept was first introduced in a 1998 report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Păun |first=Gheorghe|authorlink=Gheorghe Paun|title=Computing with Membranes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lyzoAAAACAAJ|accessdate=16 December 2012|series=TUCS Report 208|year=1998|publisher=Turku Centre for Computer Science|isbn=978-952-12-0303-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the computer scientist [[Gheorghe Paun|Gheorghe Păun]], whose last name is the origin of the letter [[P]] in 'P Systems'. Variations on the P system model led to the formation of a branch of research known as '[[membrane computing]].'

Although inspired by biology, the primary research interest in P systems is concerned with their use as a computational model, rather than for [[Mathematical biology|biological modeling]],&lt;ref name="paun2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Păun |first=Gheorghe |authorlink=Gheorghe Paun |author2=Grzegorz Rozenberg |year=2002 |title=A guide to membrane computing |journal=Theoretical Computer Science |volume=287 |issue=1 |pages=73–100 |doi=10.1016/S0304-3975(02)00136-6 |issn=0304-3975 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although this is also being investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ardelean |first=Ioan |author2=Matteo Cavaliere |date=June 2003|title=Modelling biological processes by using a probabilistic p system software |journal=Natural Computing |volume=2|issue=2 |pages=173–197 |doi=10.1023/A:1024943605864 |issn=1567-7818}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paun2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Păun|first=Gheorghe|title=Applications of Membrane Computing|year=2006|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-540-29937-0|pages=1–42|chapter=Introduction to Membrane Computing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Informal description==
A P system is defined as a series of membranes containing chemicals (in [[Wikt:finite|finite]] quantities), [[catalysts]] and rules which determine possible ways in which chemicals may react with one another to form products. Rules may also cause chemicals to pass through membranes or even cause membranes to [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolve]].

Just as in a biological cell, where a chemical reaction may only take place upon the chance event that the required chemical [[molecule]]s collide and interact (possibly also with a catalyst), the rules in a P system are applied at random. This causes the computation to proceed in a [[Nondeterministic algorithm|non-deterministic]] manner, often resulting in multiple solutions being encountered if the computation is repeated.

A P system continues until it reaches a state where no further reactions are possible. At this point the result of the computation is all those chemicals that have been passed outside of the outermost membrane, or otherwise those passed into a designated 'result' membrane.&lt;ref name="paun2006" /&gt;

==Components of a P system==
Although many varieties of P system exist, most share the same basic components. Each element has a specific role to play, and each has a founding in the biological  cell architecture upon which P systems are based.

===The environment===
The environment is the surroundings of the P system. In the initial state of a P system it contains only the container-membrane, and while the environment can never hold rules, it may have objects passed into it during the computation. The objects found within the environment at the end of the computation constitute all or part of its “result.”

===Membranes===
Membranes are the main “structures” within a P system. A membrane is a discrete unit which can contain a set of objects (symbols/catalysts), a set of rules, and a set of other membranes contained within. The outermost membrane, held within the environment, is often referred to as the 'container membrane' or 'skin membrane'. As implied to by their namesake, membranes are [[Semipermeable membrane|permeable]] and symbols resulting from a rule may cross them. A membrane (but not the container membrane) may also “dissolve”, in which case its content, except for rules (which are lost), migrate into the membrane in which it was contained.&lt;ref name=paun2002 /&gt;

Some P system variants allow for a membrane to divide, possess a [[Electric charge|charge]] or have varying [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]] by changing membrane thickness.&lt;ref name=paun2002 /&gt;

===Symbols===
Symbols represent chemicals which may react with other chemicals to form some product. In a P system each type of symbol is typically represented by a different 
letter. The symbol content of a membrane is therefore represented by a string of letters. Because the [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] of symbols in a region matters, [[multisets]] are commonly used to represent the symbol content of a region.

Special case symbols exist, for example a lower case [[Delta (letter)|delta]] (δ) is often used to initiate the dissolving of a membrane, and this will only ever be found in the output of a rule: upon being encountered it invokes a reaction, and is used in the process.

====Catalysts====
Catalysts are similar to their namesakes in chemistry. They are represented and used in the same way as symbols, but are never consumed during a “[[chemical reaction|reaction]],” they are simply a requirement for it to occur.

===Rules===
Rules represent a possible chemical reaction within a membrane, causing it to evolve to a new state. A rule has a required set of input objects (symbols or catalysts) which must be present in order for it to be applied. If the required objects are present, it consumes them and produces a set of output objects. A rule may also be specified to have a priority over other rules, in which case less dominant rules will only be applied when it is not possible to apply a more dominant rule (i.e. the required inputs are not present).

There are three (in the basic P system model) distinct ways in a rule may handle its output objects. Usually the output objects are passed into the current membrane (the same membrane in which the rule and the inputs reside), known as a ''here'' rule. However there are two modifiers which can be specified upon output objects when rules are defined, ''in'' and ''out''. The ''in'' modifier causes the object to be passed to one of the current membrane’s children (travelling inwards relative to the structure of the P system), chosen at [[Randomness|random]] during the computation. The ''out'' modifier causes the object to be passed out of the current membrane and into either its parent membrane or to a sibling membrane, specified during specification of the P system.

==Computation process==
A computation works from an initial starting state towards an end state through a number of [[wiktionary:Discrete|discrete]] steps. Each step involves iterating through all membranes in the P system and the application of rules, which occurs in both a [[maximally parallel]] and [[Nondeterministic algorithm|non-deterministic]] manner.&lt;ref name="paun2006" /&gt;

Working through step-by-step, a computation halts when no further evolution can take place (i.e. when no rules are able to be applied). At this point whatever objects have been passed to the environment, or into a designated 'result' membrane, are counted as the result of the computation.&lt;ref name=paun2006 /&gt;

===Rule application===
At each step of a computation an object may only be used once, as they are consumed by rules when applied. The method of applying a rule within a membrane is as follows: 
#Assign symbols from a membrane’s content to the rule’s inputs
#If all inputs are satisfied, remove all assigned symbols from membrane 
#Create output symbols and hold until all rule assignment, for all membranes, has taken place. 
#Add output symbols to targeted membranes. 
#Dissolve membranes as necessary 
Outputs are not passed immediately into membranes because this would contravene the maximally parallel nature of rule application, instead they are distributed after all possible rules have been applied.

====Non-deterministic application====
The order of rule application is chosen at random. Rule application order can have a significant effect on which rules may be applied at any given time, and the outcome of a step of execution.

Consider a membrane containing only a single "a" symbol, and the two rules a → ab and a → aδ. As both rules rely on an “a” symbol being present, of which there is only one, the first step of computation will allow either the first or second rule to be applied, but not both. The two possible results of this step are very different:
#The membrane carries over to the next step of the computation with both an "a" symbol and a "b" symbol present, and again one of the two rules is randomly assigned to the "a" symbol.
#The membrane dissolves and a single "a" symbol is passed out to the containing membrane.

====Maximally parallel application====
This is a property of rule application whereby all possible rule assignments must take place during every step of the computation. In essence this means that the rule a → aa has the effect of doubling the number of "a" symbols in its containing membrane each step, because the rule is applied to every occurrence of an "a" symbol present.

==As a computational model==
Most P systems variants are [[computationally universal]].&lt;ref name=paun2006 /&gt; This extends even to include variants that do not use rule priorities, usually a fundamental aspect of P systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Freund |first1=Rudolf |last2=Kari |first2=Lila |last3=Oswald |first3=Marion |last4=Sosík |first4=Petr |year=2005 |title=Computationally universal P systems without priorities: two catalysts are sufficient |journal=Theoretical Computer Science |volume=330 |issue=2 |pages=251–266 |doi=10.1016/j.tcs.2004.06.029 |issn=0304-3975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a model for computation, P systems offer the attractive possibility of solving [[NP-complete]] problems in less-than [[exponential time]].&lt;ref name=paun2006 /&gt; Some P system variants are known to be capable of solving the [[Boolean satisfiability problem|SAT]] (boolean satisfiability) problem in [[linear time]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Păun |first=Gheorghe |authorlink=Gheorghe Paun |year=2001 |title=P systems with active membranes: attacking NP-complete problems |journal=Automata, Languages and Combinatorics |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=75–90 |url=http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/CDMTCS/researchreports/102paun.pdf |accessdate=2008-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, owing to all NP-complete problems being [[Logical equivalence|equivalent]], this capability then applies to all such problems. As there is no current method of directly implementing a P system in its own right, their functionality is instead emulated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Claudio |last=Zandron |author2=Claudio Ferretti |author3=Giancarlo Mauri |title=Solving NP-Complete Problems Using P Systems with Active Membranes |booktitle=Unconventional Models of Computation |pages=289–301 |publisher= |date=2000  |isbn=1-85233-415-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore solving NP-complete problems in linear time remains theoretical. However, it has also been proven that any deterministic P system may be [[simulated]] on a [[Turing Machine]] in [[polynomial time]].&lt;ref name="paun2002" /&gt;

==Example computation==
[[Image:P-system-example.svg|frame|right|The graphical representation of a P system which outputs square numbers]]
The image shown depicts the initial state of a P system with three membranes. Because of their hierarchical nature, P systems are often depicted graphically with drawings that resemble [[Venn diagram]]s or [[David Harel]]'s [[Higraph]] (see [[Statechart]]).

The outermost membrane, 1, is the container membrane for this P system and contains a single ''out'' rule. Membrane 2 contains four ''here'' rules, with two in a priority relationship: cc → c will always be applied in preference to c → δ. The delta symbol represents the special “dissolve” symbol. The innermost membrane, 3, contains a set of symbols (“ac”) and three rules, of type ''here''. In this initial state no rules outside of membrane 3 are applicable: there are no 
symbols outside of that membrane. However, during evolution of the system, as objects are passed between membranes, the rules in other membranes will become active.

===Computation===
Because of the non-deterministic nature of P systems, there are many different paths of computation a single P system is capable of, leading to different results. The following is one possible path of computation for the P system depicted.

====Step 1====
From the initial configuration only membrane 3 has any object content: "ac"
*"c" is assigned to c → cc 
*"a" is assigned to a → ab

====Step 2====
Membrane 3 now contains: "abcc" 
*"a" is assigned to a → bδ 
*"c" is assigned to c → cc 
*"c" is assigned to c → cc
Notice the maximally parallel behaviour of rule application leading to the same rule being applied twice during one step.

Notice also that the application of the second rule (a → bδ) as opposed to the first (a → ab) is non-deterministic and can be presumed random. The system could just as well have continued applying the first rule (and at the same time doubling the c particles) indefinitely.

Membrane 3 now dissolves, as the dissolve symbol (δ) has been encountered and all object content from this membrane passes into membrane 2.

====Step 3====
Membrane 2 now contains: "{{not a typo|bbcccc}}" 
*"b" is assigned to b → d 
*"b" is assigned to b → d 
*"cc" is assigned to cc → c 
*"cc" is assigned to cc → c

====Step 4====
Membrane 2 now contains: "{{not a typo|ddcc}}" 
*"d" is assigned to d → de 
*"d" is assigned to d → de 
*"cc" is assigned to cc → c

====Step 5====
Membrane 2 now contains: "{{not a typo|dedec}}" 
*"d" is assigned to d → de 
*"d" is assigned to d → de 
*"c" is assigned to c → δ

Notice that the priority over c → δ has been lifted now the required inputs for cc→ c no longer exist. Membrane 2 now dissolves, and all object content passes 
to membrane 1.

====Step 6====
Membrane 1 now contains: "{{not a typo|deedee}}" 
*"e” is assigned to e → e&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; 
*"e” is assigned to e → e&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; 
*"e” is assigned to e → e&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; 
*"e” is assigned to e → e&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;

====Computation halts====
Membrane 1 now contains: "dd" and, due to the out rule e → e&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;, the environment contains: "eeee." At this point the computation halts as no further 
assignments of objects to rules is possible. The result of the computation is four "e" symbols.

The only non-deterministic choices occurred during steps 1 and 2, when choosing where to assign the solitary "a" symbol. Consider the case where "a" is assigned to a → bδ during step 1: upon membrane 3 dissolving only a single "b" and two "c" objects would exist, leading to the creation of only a single "e" object to eventually be passed out as the computation’s result.

The '''Padovan sequence''' is the [[sequence]] of [[integer]]s ''P''(''n'') defined by the initial values

:&lt;math&gt;P(0)=P(1)=P(2)=1,&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[recurrence relation]]

:&lt;math&gt;P(n)=P(n-2)+P(n-3).&lt;/math&gt;

The first few values of ''P''(''n'') are

:1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 16, 21, 28, 37, 49, 65, 86, 114, 151, 200, 265, ... {{OEIS|id=A000931}}

[[Image:Padovan triangles (1).png|thumb|350px|Spiral of equilateral triangles with side lengths which follow the Padovan sequence.]]
The Padovan sequence is named after [[Richard Padovan]] who attributed its discovery to [[Netherlands|Dutch]] architect [[Hans van der Laan]] in his 1994 essay ''Dom. Hans van der Laan : Modern Primitive''. The sequence was described by [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] in his [[Scientific American]] column ''Mathematical Recreations'' in June 1996. He also writes about it in one of his books, "Math Hysteria: Fun Games With Mathematics".

''The above definition is the one given by Ian Stewart and by [[MathWorld]]. Other sources may start the sequence at a different place, in which case some of the identities in this article must be adjusted with appropriate offsets.''

==Recurrence relations==
In the spiral, each triangle shares a side with two others giving a visual proof that 
the Padovan sequence also satisfies the recurrence relation
:&lt;math&gt;P(n)=P(n-1)+P(n-5)&lt;/math&gt;

Starting from this, the defining recurrence and other recurrences as they are discovered,
one can create an infinite number of further recurrences by repeatedly replacing &lt;math&gt;P(m)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;P(m - 2) + P(m - 3)&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Perrin pseudoprime|Perrin sequence]] satisfies the same recurrence relations as the Padovan sequence, although it has different initial values. This is a property of recurrence relations.

The Perrin sequence can be obtained from the Padovan sequence by the 
following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Perrin}(n)=P(n+1)+P(n-10).\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Extension to negative parameters==
As with any sequence defined by a recurrence relation, Padovan numbers ''P''(''m'') for ''m&lt;0'' can be defined by rewriting the recurrence relation as

:&lt;math&gt;P(m) = P(m+3) - P(m+1),&lt;/math&gt;

Starting with ''m'' = −1 and working backwards, we extend ''P''(''m'') to negative indices:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:right"
|-
| ''P''&lt;sub&gt;−20&lt;/sub&gt;
| ''P''&lt;sub&gt;−19&lt;/sub&gt;
| ''P''&lt;sub&gt;−18&lt;/sub&gt;
| ''P''&lt;sub&gt;−17&lt;/sub&gt;
| ''P''&lt;sub&gt;−16&lt;/sub&gt; 
| ''P''&lt;sub&gt;−15&lt;/sub&gt;
| ''P''&lt;sub&gt;−14&lt;/sub&gt;
| ''P''&lt;sub&gt;−13&lt;/sub&gt;
| ''P''&lt;sub&gt;−12&lt;/sub&gt;
| ''P''&lt;sub&gt;−11&lt;/sub&gt;
| ''P''&lt;sub&gt;−10&lt;/sub&gt;

==Sums of terms==
The sum of the first ''n'' terms in the Padovan sequence is 2 less than ''P''(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5) i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^n P(m)=P(n+5)-2.&lt;/math&gt;

Sums of alternate terms, sums of every third term and sums of every fifth term are also related to other terms in the sequence:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^n P(2m)=P(2n+3)-1&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS2C|A077855}}

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^n P(2m+1)=P(2n+4)-1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^n P(3m)=P(3n+2)&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS2C|A034943}}

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^n P(3m+1)=P(3n+3)-1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^n P(3m+2)=P(3n+4)-1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^n P(5m)=P(5n+1).&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS2C|A012772}}

Sums involving products of terms in the Padovan sequence satisfy the following identities:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^n P(m)^2=P(n+2)^2-P(n-1)^2-P(n-3)^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^n P(m)^2P(m+1)=P(n)P(n+1)P(n+2)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^n P(m)P(m+2)=P(n+2)P(n+3)-1.&lt;/math&gt;

==Other identities==
The Padovan sequence also satisfies the identity

:&lt;math&gt;P(n)^2-P(n+1)P(n-1)=P(-n-7).\,&lt;/math&gt;

The Padovan sequence is related to sums of [[binomial coefficient]]s by the following identity:

:&lt;math&gt;P(k-2)=\sum_{2m+n=k}{m \choose n}=\sum_{m=\lceil k/3\rceil}^{\lfloor k/2\rfloor}{m \choose k-2m}.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, for ''k'' = 12, the values for the pair (''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n'') with 2''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n'' = 12 which give non-zero binomial coefficients are (6,&amp;nbsp;0), (5,&amp;nbsp;2) and (4,&amp;nbsp;4), and:

:&lt;math&gt;{6 \choose 0}+{5 \choose 2}+{4 \choose 4}=1+10+1=12=P(10).\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Binet-like formula==

The Padovan sequence numbers can be written in terms of powers of the roots of the equation

:&lt;math&gt; x^3 -x -1 = 0.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This equation has 3 roots;  one real root ''p'' (known as the [[plastic number]]) and two complex conjugate roots ''q'' and ''r''. Given these three roots, the Padovan sequence can be expressed by a formula involving ''p'', ''q'' and ''r'':

:&lt;math&gt;P\left(n\right) = a p^n + b q^n + c r^n&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are constants.

Since the magnitudes of the complex roots ''q'' and ''r'' are both less than 1 (and hence ''p'' is a [[Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number]]), the powers of these roots approach 0 for large ''n'', and &lt;math&gt;P\left(n\right) - a {p^n}&lt;/math&gt; tends to zero.

&lt;!-- it would be nice to use a p^n below instead of p^(n-1)/s, but it would be nice to express that a as a cubic root as well. Failing that, I prefer the older formula. ~~~~ --&gt;
For all &lt;math&gt;n \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;, P(n) is the integer closest to &lt;math&gt;  \frac {p^{n-1}} {s}&lt;/math&gt;, 
where ''s'' = ''p''/''a'' = 1.0453567932525329623... is the only real root of ''s''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;23''s''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;23&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.   The ratio of successive terms in the Padovan sequence approaches ''p'', which has a value of approximately 1.324718. This constant bears the same relationship to the Padovan sequence and the [[Perrin sequence]] as the [[golden ratio]] does to the Fibonacci sequence.
&lt;!-- ... and to all Fibonacci-type sequences. --&gt;

==Combinatorial interpretations==
* ''P''(''n'') is the number of ways of writing ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 as an ordered sum in which each term is either 2 or 3 (i.e. the number of [[composition (number theory)|compositions]] of ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 in which each term is either 2 or 3). For example, ''P''(6) = 4, and there are 4 ways to write 8 as an ordered sum of 2s and 3s:

::2 + 2 + 2 + 2  ;  2 + 3 + 3  ;  3 + 2 + 3  ;  3 + 3 + 2

* The number of ways of writing ''n'' as an ordered sum in which no term is 2 is ''P''(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2). For example, ''P''(6) = 4, and there are 4 ways to write 4 as an ordered sum in which no term is 2:

::4  ;  1 + 3  ;  3 + 1  ;  1 + 1 + 1 + 1

* The number of ways of writing ''n'' as a palindromic ordered sum in which no term is 2 is ''P''(''n''). For example, ''P''(6) = 4, and there are 4 ways to write 6 as a palindromic ordered sum in which no term is 2:

::6  ;  3 + 3  ;  1 + 4 + 1  ;  1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1

* The number of ways of writing ''n'' as an ordered sum in which each term is odd and greater than 1 is equal to ''P''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;5). For example, ''P''(6) = 4, and there are 4 ways to write 11 as an ordered sum in which each term is odd and greater than 1:

::11 ; 5 + 3 + 3 ; 3 + 5 + 3 ; 3 + 3 + 5

* The number of ways of writing ''n'' as an ordered sum in which each term is congruent to 2 mod 3 is equal to ''P''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;4). For example, ''P''(6) = 4, and there are 4 ways to write 10 as an ordered sum in which each term is congruent to 2 mod 3:

::8 + 2  ;  2 + 8  ;  5 + 5  ;  2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2

==Generating function==
The [[generating function]] of the Padovan sequence is

:&lt;math&gt;G(P(n);x)=\frac{1+x}{1-x^2-x^3}.&lt;/math&gt;

This can be used to prove identities involving products of the Padovan sequence with geometric terms, such as:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{P(n)}{2^n} = \frac{12}{5}.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{P(n)}{\alpha^n} = \frac{\alpha^2(\alpha+1)}{\alpha^3-\alpha-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Generalizations ==

In a similar way to the [[Fibonacci numbers]] that can be generalized to a set of polynomials
called the [[Fibonacci polynomials]], the Padovan sequence numbers can be generalized to
yield the [[Padovan polynomials]].

== Padovan L-system ==

If we define the following simple grammar:

:     '''variables''' :   A  B  C
:     '''constants''' :   none
:     '''start'''     :   A
:     '''rules'''     :   (A &amp;rarr; B), (B &amp;rarr; C), (C &amp;rarr; AB)

then this Lindenmayer system or [[L-system]] produces the following sequence of strings:

:     ''n'' = 0 : A
:     ''n'' = 1 : B
:     ''n'' = 2 : C
:     ''n'' = 3 : AB
:     ''n'' = 4 : BC
:     ''n'' = 5 : CAB
:     ''n'' = 6 : ABBC
:     ''n'' = 7 : BCCAB 
:     ''n'' = 8 : CABABBC

and if we count the length of each string, we obtain the Padovan sequence of numbers:

:    1  1  1 2 2 3 4 5  ...

Also, if you count the number of ''A''s, ''B''s and ''C''s in each string, then for the ''n''th
string, you have ''P''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;5) ''A''s, ''P''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;3) ''B''s and ''P''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;4) ''C''s.  The count of ''BB'' pairs, ''AA'' pairs
and ''CC'' pairs are also Padovan numbers.

== Cuboid spiral ==
{{main|Padovan cuboid spiral}}
A spiral can be formed based on connecting the corners of a set of 3-dimensional cuboids.
This is the [[Padovan cuboid spiral]]. Successive sides of this spiral have lengths that are
the Padovan sequence numbers multiplied by the [[square root of 2]].

== Pascal's triangle ==
[[Erv Wilson]] in his paper ''The Scales of Mt. Meru'' discovered the Padovan sequence in Pascal's Triangle by summing the diagonal numbers (see diagram). Correction, Erv Wilson noticed these diagonals and drew them on paper in 1993,  yet the Padovan numbers were not discovered until 1994. Paul Barry (2004) actually defined these diagonals as being related to the Padovan sequence. Below is the image.

===Generating function===
The [[generating function]] of the Perrin sequence is

:&lt;math&gt;G(P(n);x)=\frac{3-x^2}{1-x^2-x^3}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Matrix formula===
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}^n
  \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} =
  \begin{pmatrix} P\left(n\right) \\ P\left(n+1\right) \\ P\left(n+2\right) \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Binet-like formula===

The Perrin sequence numbers can be written in terms of powers of the roots of the equation

:&lt;math&gt; x^3 -x -1 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation has 3 roots;  one real root ''p'' (known as the [[plastic number]]) and two complex conjugate roots ''q'' and ''r''. Given these three roots, the Perrin sequence analogue of the [[Lucas sequence]] Binet formula is

:&lt;math&gt;P\left(n\right) = {p^n} + {q^n} + {r^n}. &lt;/math&gt;

Since the magnitudes of the complex roots ''q'' and ''r'' are both less than 1, the powers of these roots approach 0 for large ''n''. For large ''n'' the formula reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;P\left(n\right) \approx {p^n} &lt;/math&gt;

This formula can be used to quickly calculate values of the Perrin sequence for large n. The ratio of successive terms in the Perrin sequence approaches ''p'', a.k.a. the [[plastic number]], which has a value of approximately 1.324718. This constant bears the same relationship to the Perrin sequence as the [[golden ratio]] does to the [[Lucas number|Lucas sequence]].  Similar connections exist also between ''p'' and the [[Padovan sequence]], between the [[golden ratio]] and Fibonacci numbers, and between the [[silver ratio]] and [[Pell number]]s.

===Multiplication formula===

From the Binet formula, we can obtain a formula for ''G''(''kn'') in terms of ''G''(''n''−1), ''G''(''n'') and ''G''(''n''+1); we know
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
G(n-1) &amp; = &amp;p^{-1}p^n + &amp;q^{-1}q^n +&amp; r^{-1} r^n\\
G(n) &amp; =&amp; p^n+&amp;q^n+&amp;r^n\\
G(n+1) &amp;=&amp; pp^n +&amp; qq^n +&amp; rr^n\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

which gives us three linear equations with coefficients over the [[splitting field]] of &lt;math&gt; x^3 -x -1 &lt;/math&gt;; by inverting a matrix we can solve for &lt;math&gt;p^n, q^n, r^n&lt;/math&gt; and then we can raise them to the ''k''th power and compute the sum.

Example [[Magma computer algebra system|magma]] code:

 P&amp;lt;x&amp;gt; := PolynomialRing(Rationals());
 S&amp;lt;t&amp;gt; := SplittingField(x^3-x-1);
 P2&amp;lt;y&amp;gt; := PolynomialRing(S);
 p,q,r := Explode(&amp;#91;r&amp;#91;1&amp;#93; : r in Roots(y^3-y-1)&amp;#93;);
 Mi:=Matrix(&amp;#91;&amp;#91;1/p,1/q,1/r&amp;#93;,&amp;#91;1,1,1&amp;#93;,&amp;#91;p,q,r&amp;#93;&amp;#93;)^(-1);
 T&amp;lt;u,v,w&amp;gt; := PolynomialRing(S,3);
 v1 := ChangeRing(Mi,T) *Matrix(&amp;#91;&amp;#91;u&amp;#93;,&amp;#91;v&amp;#93;,&amp;#91;w&amp;#93;&amp;#93;);
 &amp;#91;p^i*v1&amp;#91;1,1&amp;#93;^3 + q^i*v1&amp;#91;2,1&amp;#93;^3 + r^i*v1&amp;#91;3,1&amp;#93;^3 : i in &amp;#91;-1..1&amp;#93;&amp;#93;;

with the result that, if we have &lt;math&gt;u = G(n-1), v = G(n), w = G(n+1)&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;

\begin{matrix}
23G(2n-1) &amp;=&amp; 4u^2 + 3v^2 + 9w^2 + 18uv - 12uw - 4vw \\
23G(2n) &amp;=&amp; - 6u^2 + 7v^2 - 2w^2 - 4uv + 18uw + 6vw\\
23G(2n+1) &amp;=&amp; 9u^2 + v^2 + 3w^2 + 6uv - 4uw + 14vw \\
23G(3n-1)&amp; = &amp;\left(-4u^3 + 2v^3 -w^3 + 9(uv^2+vw^2+wu^2) + 3v^2w+6uvw\right)\\
23G(3n)&amp; = &amp;\left(3u^3 + 2v^3 + 3w^3 - 3(uv^2 + uw^2 + vw^2 + vu^2) + 6v^2w + 18uvw\right) \\
23G(3n+1)&amp; = &amp;\left(v^3-w^3+6uv^2+9uw^2+6vw^2+9vu^2-3wu^2+6wv^2-6uvw\right) \end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The number 23 here arises from the discriminant of the defining polynomial of the sequence.

This allows computation of the nth Perrin number using integer arithmetic in &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt; multiplies.

==Primes and divisibility==

===Perrin pseudoprimes===

It has been proven that for all primes ''p'', ''p'' divides ''P''(''p''). However, the converse is not true: for some [[composite number]]s ''n'', ''n'' may still divide ''P''(''n''). If ''n'' has this property, it is called a "Perrin [[pseudoprime]]".

The first few Perrin pseudoprimes are
:271441, 904631, 16532714, 24658561, 27422714, 27664033, 46672291, 102690901, 130944133, 196075949, 214038533, 517697641, 545670533, 801123451, 855073301, 903136901, 970355431, ... {{OEIS|id=A013998}}

The question of the existence of Perrin pseudoprimes was considered by Perrin himself, but it was not known whether they existed until Adams and Shanks (1982) discovered the smallest one, 271441 = 521&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; the next-smallest is 904631 = 7 x 13 x 9941. There are seventeen of them less than a billion;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEIS|id=A013998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Grantham has proved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Jon Grantham]] |title=There are infinitely many Perrin pseudoprimes |journal=[[Journal of Number Theory]] |year=2010 |volume=130 |issue=5 |pages=1117–1128 |doi=10.1016/j.jnt.2009.11.008 |url=http://www.pseudoprime.com/pseudo3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; that there are infinitely many Perrin pseudoprimes.

Adams and Shanks (1982) noted that primes also meet the condition that ''P''(''-p'') = ''-1'' mod ''p''.  Composites where both properties hold are called "restricted Perrin pseudoprimes" {{OEIS|id=A018187}}.  Further conditions can be applied using the six element signature of ''n'' which must be one of three forms (e.g. {{OEIS2C|A275612}} and {{OEIS2C|A275613}}).

While Perrin pseudoprimes are rare, they have significant overlap with [[Fermat pseudoprime]]s.  This contrasts with the [[Lucas pseudoprime]]s which are anti-correlated.  The latter condition is exploited to yield the popular, efficient, and more effective [[Baillie–PSW_primality_test|BPSW test]] which has no known pseudoprimes, and the smallest is known to be greater than 2&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Perrin primes===

A '''Perrin prime''' is a Perrin number that is [[prime number|prime]].  The first few Perrin primes are:

:2, 3, 5, 7, 17, 29, 277, 367, 853, 14197, 43721, 1442968193, 792606555396977, 187278659180417234321, 66241160488780141071579864797, ... {{OEIS|id=A074788}}

For these Perrin primes, the index {{math|''n''}} of {{math|''P''(''n'')}} is
:2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 20, 21, 24, 34, 38, 75, 122, 166, 236, 355, 356, 930, 1042, 1214, 1461, 1622, 4430, 5802, 9092, ... {{OEIS|id=A112881}}

Generating P(n) where n is a negative integer yields a similar property regarding primality: if n is a negative, then P(n) is prime when P(n) mod -n = -n - 1. The following sequence represents P(n) for all n that are negative integers:
:-1, 1, 2, -3, 4, -2, -1, 5, -7, 6, -1, -6, 12, -13, 7, 5, -18, 25, -20, 2, 23, -43, 45, -22, -21, 66, -88, 67, -1, ... {{OEIS|id=A078712}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6758">In physics, the '''phase problem''' is the problem of loss of information concerning the [[phase (waves)|phase]] that can occur when making a physical measurement. The name comes from the field of [[X-ray crystallography]], where the phase problem has to be solved for the determination of a structure from [[diffraction]] data. The phase problem is also met in the fields of [[imaging science|imaging]] and [[signal processing]]. Various approaches have been developed over the years that attempt to solve it.

==Overview==

Light detectors, such as [[photographic plate]]s or [[charge-coupled device|CCD]]s, measure only the intensity of the light that hits them. This measurement is incomplete (even when neglecting other [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] such as [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] and [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]]) because a light wave has not only an amplitude (related to the intensity), but also a phase, which is systematically lost in a measurement. In diffraction or [[microscopy]] experiments, the phase part of the wave often contains valuable information on the studied specimen. The phase problem constitutes a fundamental limitation ultimately related to the nature of [[measurement in quantum mechanics]].

In X-ray crystallography, the diffraction data when properly assembled gives the amplitude of the 3D [[Fourier transform]] of the molecule's [[electron density]] in the [[unit cell]]. If the phases are known, the electron density can be simply obtained by [[Fourier synthesis]]. This Fourier transform relation also holds for two-dimensional far-field [[diffraction]] patterns (also called [[Fraunhofer diffraction]]) giving rise to a similar type of phase problem.

==Solutions in X-ray crystallography==

In [[X-ray crystallography]], there are several ways to recover the lost phases. A powerful solution is the ''[[multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion|Multi-wavelength Anomalous Diffraction]]'' (MAD) method. In this technique, atoms' inner electrons{{clarify|reason=Which atoms? Special new atoms that are introduced?|date=July 2016}} absorb X-rays of particular wavelengths, and reemit the X-rays after a delay, inducing a phase shift in all of the reflections, known as the ''[[anomalous dispersion]] effect''. Analysis of this phase shift (which may be different for individual reflections) results in a solution for the phases. Since X-ray fluorescence techniques (like this one) require excitation at very specific wavelengths, it is necessary to use [[synchrotron radiation]] when using the MAD method.

Other methods of experimental phase determination include ''[[multiple isomorphous replacement|Multiple Isomorphous Replacement]]'' (MIR), where heavy atoms are inserted into structure (usually by synthesizing proteins with analogs or by soaking), ''[[molecular replacement]]'' (MR) and ''[[single-wavelength anomalous dispersion|Single-wavelength Anomalous Dispersion]]'' (SAD).

Phases can also be inferred by using a process called [[molecular replacement]], where a similar molecule's already-known phases are grafted onto the intensities of the molecule at hand, which are observationally determined.  These phases can be obtained experimentally from a homologous molecule or if the phases are known for the same molecule but in a different crystal, by simulating the molecule's packing in the crystal and obtaining theoretical phases.  Generally, these techniques are less desirable since they can severely bias the solution of the structure.  They are useful, however, for ligand binding studies, or between molecules with small differences and relatively rigid structures (for example derivatizing a small molecule).

There are two major processes for recovering the phases using the data obtained by regular equipment.  One is the direct method, which estimates the initial phases and expanding phases using a triple relation. (A trio of reflections in which the intensity and phase of one reflection can be explained by the other two has a triple relation.)  A number of initial phases are tested and selected by this method. The other is the Patterson method, which directly determines the positions of heavy atoms.  The [[Patterson function]] gives a large value in a position which corresponds to interatomic vectors. This method can be applied only when the crystal contains heavy atoms or when a significant fraction of the structure is already known.  Because of the development of computers, the direct method is now the most useful technique for solving the phase problem.

For molecules whose crystals provide reflections in the sub-Ångström range, it is possible to determine phases by [[brute-force search|brute force]] methods, testing a series of phase values until spherical structures are observed in the resultant electron density map.  This works because atoms have a characteristic structure when viewed in the sub-Ångström range.  The technique is limited by processing power and data quality.  For practical purposes, it is limited to "small molecules" because they consistently provide high-quality diffraction with very few reflections.

In many cases, an initial set of phases are determined, and the electron density map for the diffraction pattern is calculated.  Then the map is used to determine portions of the structure, which portions are used to simulate a new set of phases.  This new set of phases is known as a ''refinement''. These phases are reapplied to the original amplitudes, and an improved electron density map is derived, from which the structure is corrected.  This process is repeated until an error term (usually Rfree) has stabilized to a satisfactory value. Because of the phenomenon of [[phase bias]], it is possible for an incorrect initial assignment to propagate through successive refinements, so satisfactory conditions for a structure assignment are still a matter of debate. Indeed, some spectacular incorrect assignments have been reported, including a protein where the entire sequence was threaded backwards.&lt;ref name="Kleywegt2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kleywegt|first1=Gerard J.|title=Validation of protein crystal structures|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section D|volume=56|issue=3|year=2000|pages=249–265|issn=0907-4449|doi=10.1107/S0907444999016364|pmid=10713511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], particularly in [[dynamical systems]], a '''first recurrence map''' or '''Poincaré map''', named after [[Henri Poincaré]], is the intersection of a [[periodic orbit]] in the [[state space]] of a [[continuous dynamical system]] with a certain lower-dimensional subspace, called the '''Poincaré section''', [[Transversality (mathematics)|transversal]] to the [[Flow (mathematics)|flow]] of the system. More precisely, one considers a periodic orbit with initial conditions within a section of the space, which leaves that section afterwards, and observes the point at which this orbit first returns to the section. One then creates a [[map (mathematics)|map]] to send the first point to the second, hence the name ''first recurrence map''. The transversality of the Poincaré section means that periodic orbits starting on the subspace flow through it and not parallel to it.

A Poincaré map can be interpreted as a [[discrete dynamical system]] with a state space that is one dimension smaller than the original continuous dynamical system. Because it preserves many properties of periodic and quasiperiodic orbits of the original system and has a lower-dimensional state space, it is often used for analyzing the original system in a simpler way. In practice this is not always possible as there is no general method to construct a Poincaré map.

A Poincaré map differs from a [[recurrence plot]] in that space, not time, determines when to plot a point. For instance, the locus of the Moon when the Earth is at [[perihelion]] is a recurrence plot; the locus of the Moon when it passes through the plane perpendicular to the Earth's orbit and passing through the Sun and the Earth at perihelion is a Poincaré map. It was used by [[Michel Hénon]] to study the motion of stars in a [[galaxy]], because the path of a star projected onto a plane looks like a tangled mess, while the Poincaré map shows the structure more clearly.

== Definition ==

[[Image:Poincare map.svg|thumb|230px|In Poincaré section ''S'', the Poincaré map ''P'' projects point ''x'' onto point ''P''(''x'').]]
Let ('''R''', ''M'', ''φ'') be a [[global dynamical system]], with '''R''' the [[real number]]s, ''M'' the [[phase space]] and ''φ'' the [[evolution function]]. Let γ be a [[periodic orbit]] through a point ''p'' and ''S'' be a local differentiable and transversal section of ''φ'' through ''p'', called a '''Poincaré section''' through ''p''.

Given an open and connected [[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] &lt;math&gt;U \subset S&lt;/math&gt; of ''p'', a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] 
:&lt;math&gt;P: U \to S&lt;/math&gt;
is called '''Poincaré map''' for the orbit γ on the '''Poincaré section''' ''S'' through the point ''p'' if
* ''P''(''p'') = ''p''
* ''P''(''U'') is a neighborhood of ''p'' and ''P'':''U'' → ''P''(''U'') is a [[diffeomorphism]]
* for every point ''x'' in ''U'', the [[positive semi-orbit]] of ''x'' intersects ''S'' for the first time at ''P''(''x'')

== Poincaré maps and stability analysis ==

Poincaré maps can be interpreted as a [[discrete dynamical system]]. The [[stability theory|stability]] of a periodic orbit of the original system is closely related to the stability of the fixed point of the corresponding Poincaré map.

Let ('''R''', ''M'', ''φ'') be a [[differentiable dynamical system]] with periodic orbit γ through ''p''. Let
:&lt;math&gt;P: U \to S&lt;/math&gt;
be the corresponding Poincaré map through ''p''. We define

:&lt;math&gt;P^{0} := \operatorname{id}_{U}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P^{n+1} := P \circ P^n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P^{-n-1} := P^{-1} \circ P^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt;P(n, x) := P^n(x)&lt;/math&gt;

then ('''Z''', ''U'', ''P'') is a discrete dynamical system with state space ''U'' and evolution function

:&lt;math&gt;P: \mathbb{Z} \times U \to U.&lt;/math&gt;

Per definition this system has a fixed point at ''p''.

The periodic orbit γ of the continuous dynamical system is [[Stability theory|stable]] if and only if the fixed point ''p'' of the discrete dynamical system is stable.

The periodic orbit γ of the continuous dynamical system is [[asymptotically stable]] if and only if the fixed point ''p'' of the discrete dynamical system is asymptotically stable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8079">In [[geometry]], a '''position''' or '''position vector''', also known as '''location vector''' or '''radius vector''', is a [[Euclidean vector]] that represents the position of a point ''P'' in [[space#Classical mechanics|space]] in relation to an arbitrary reference [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] ''O''.

==Definition==

===Three dimensions===

[[File:Space curve.svg|thumb|[[Space curve]] in 3D. The [[position vector]] '''r''' is parameterized by a scalar ''t''. At '''r''' = '''a''' the red line is the tangent to the curve, and the blue plane is normal to the curve.]]

In [[three dimensions]], any set of three-dimensional coordinates and their corresponding basis vectors can be used to define the location of a point in space—whichever is the simplest for the task at hand may be used.

Commonly, one uses the familiar [[Cartesian coordinate system]], or sometimes [[spherical polar coordinates]], or [[cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical coordinates]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} 
 \mathbf{r}(t) 
 &amp; \equiv \mathbf{r}(x,y,z) \equiv x(t)\mathbf{\hat{e}}_x + y(t)\mathbf{\hat{e}}_y + z(t)\mathbf{\hat{e}}_z  \\
 &amp; \equiv \mathbf{r}(r,\theta,\phi) \equiv r(t)\mathbf{\hat{e}}_r\big(\theta(t), \phi(t)\big) \\
 &amp; \equiv \mathbf{r}(r,\theta,z) \equiv r(t)\mathbf{\hat{e}}_r\big(\theta(t)\big) + z(t)\mathbf{\hat{e}}_z, \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' is a [[parametric equation|parameter]], owing to their rectangular or circular symmetry. These different coordinates and corresponding basis vectors represent the same position vector. More general [[curvilinear coordinates]] could be used instead and are in contexts like [[continuum mechanics]] and [[general relativity]] (in the latter case one needs an additional time coordinate).

===''n'' dimensions===

[[Linear algebra]] allows for the abstraction of an ''n''-dimensional position vector. A position vector can be expressed as a linear combination of [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] vectors:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mathematical methods for physics and engineering |first1=K. F. |last1=Riley |first2=M. P.|last2=Hobson |first3=S. J. |last3=Bence | publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-521-86153-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Linear Algebra|first1=S. |last1=Lipschutz|first2=M.|last2=Lipson| publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2009|isbn=978-0-07-154352-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \mathbf{e}_i = x_1 \mathbf{e}_1 + x_2 \mathbf{e}_2 + \dotsb + x_n \mathbf{e}_n. &lt;/math&gt;

The [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all position vectors forms [[position space]] (a [[vector space]] whose elements are the position vectors), since positions can be added ([[vector addition]]) and scaled in length ([[scalar multiplication]]) to obtain another position vector in the space. The notion of "space" is intuitive, since each ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (''i'' = 1, 2, …, ''n'') can have any value, the collection of values defines a point in space.

The ''[[dimension (linear algebra)|dimension]]'' of the position space is ''n'' (also denoted dim(''R'') = ''n''). The ''[[coordinates]]'' of the vector '''r''' with respect to the basis vectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. The vector of coordinates forms the [[coordinate vector]] or ''n''-[[tuple]] (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'').

Each coordinate ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' may be [[parametric equation|parameterized]] a number of [[parameter]]s ''t''. One parameter ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'') would describe a curved 1D path, two parameters ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) describes a curved 2D surface, three ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) describes a curved 3D volume of space, and so on.

The [[linear span]] of a basis set ''B'' = {'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,  …, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} equals the position space ''R'', denoted span(''B'') = ''R''.

==Applications==

===Differential geometry===

{{main|Differential geometry}}

Position vector fields are used to describe continuous and differentiable space curves, in which case the independent parameter needs not be time, but can be (e.g.) arc length of the curve.

===Mechanics===

{{main|Newtonian mechanics|Analytical mechanics|Equation of motion}}

In any [[equation of motion]], the position vector '''r'''(''t'') is usually the most sought-after quantity because this function defines the motion of a particle (i.e. a [[point mass]]) – its location relative to a given [[coordinate system]] at some time ''t''.

To define motion in terms of position, each coordinate may be [[parameter|parametrized]] by time; since each successive value of time corresponds to a sequence of successive spatial locations given by the coordinates, the continuum limit of many successive locations is a path the particle traces.

In the case of one dimension, the position has only one component, so it effectively degenerates to a scalar coordinate. It could be, say, a vector in the ''x'' direction, or the radial ''r'' direction. Equivalent notations include

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x} \equiv x \equiv x(t), \quad r \equiv r(t), \quad s \equiv s(t).&lt;/math&gt;

==Derivatives of position==

[[File:Kinematics.svg|thumb|Kinematic quantities of a classical particle: mass&amp;nbsp;''m'', position&amp;nbsp;'''r''', velocity&amp;nbsp;'''v''', acceleration&amp;nbsp;'''a''']]

For a position vector '''r''' that is a function of time ''t'', the [[time derivative]]s can be computed with respect to ''t''. These derivatives have common utility in the study of [[kinematics]], [[control theory]], [[engineering]] and other sciences.

;[[Velocity]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}t},&lt;/math&gt;
where d'''r''' is an [[Differential (infinitesimal)|infinitesimally]] small [[displacement (vector)]].

;[[Acceleration]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}t^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Jerk (physics)|Jerk]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{j} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{a}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t^2} = \frac{\mathrm{d}^3\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}t^3}.&lt;/math&gt;

These names for the first, second and third derivative of position are commonly used in basic kinematics.&lt;ref name='stewart'&gt;{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; By extension, the higher-order derivatives can be computed in a similar fashion. Study of these higher-order derivatives can improve approximations of the original displacement function. Such higher-order terms are required in order to accurately represent the displacement function as [[Taylor series|a sum of an infinite sequence]], enabling several analytical techniques in engineering and physics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1505">In [[graph theory]], '''precoloring extension''' is the problem of extending a [[graph coloring]] of a subset of the vertices of a graph, with a given set of colors, to a coloring of the whole graph that does not assign the same color to any two adjacent vertices.
It has the usual graph coloring problem as a special case, in which the initially colored subset of vertices is empty; therefore, it is [[NP-complete]].
However, it is also NP-complete for some other classes of graphs on which the usual graph coloring problem is easier, such as the [[rook's graph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Precoloring extension may be seen as a special case of [[list coloring]], the problem of coloring a graph in which no vertices have been colored, but each vertex has an assigned list of available colors.
To transform a precoloring extension problem into a list coloring problem, assign each uncolored vertex in the precoloring extension problem a list of the colors not yet used by its initially-colored neighbors,
and then remove the colored vertices from the graph.

'''Richard Ewen Borcherds''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɔr|tʃ|ər|d|z}}; born 29 November 1959)&lt;ref name="whoswho"/&gt; is a [[British-American]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/members/20033092.html&lt;/ref&gt; mathematician currently working in [[quantum field theory]]. He is known for his work in [[lattice (group)|lattices]], [[number theory]], [[group theory]], and infinite-dimensional [[algebra over a field|algebra]]s,&lt;ref&gt;James Lepowsky, [http://www.ams.org/notices/199901/fields.pdf "The Work of Richard Borcherds"], ''Notices of the American Mathematical Society'', Volume 46, Number 1 (January 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; for which he was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in 1998.

== Early life ==
Borcherds was born in [[Cape Town]], but the family moved to [[Birmingham]] in the [[United Kingdom]] when he was six months old.&lt;ref name=singh/&gt; His father is a physicist and he has three brothers, two of whom are mathematics teachers. He was a promising mathematician and chess player as a child, winning several national mathematics championships and "was in line for becoming a [[chess master]]" before giving up chess after coming to believe that the higher levels of competitive chess are merely about the competition rather than the fun of playing.

== Education ==
He was educated at [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref name="ub"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/98legacy/08-19-1998a.html|title=UC Berkeley professor wins highest honor in mathematics, the prestigious Fields Medal|date=19 August 1998|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he studied under [[John Horton Conway]].&lt;ref name="ams"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Allyn|last=Jackson|date=November 1998|title=Borcherds, Gowers, Kontsevich, and McMullen Receive Fields Medals|journal=Notices of the American Mathematical Society|publisher=American Mathematical Society|volume=45|issue=10|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/199810/comm-fields.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
After receiving his doctorate in 1985 he has held various alternating positions at Cambridge and the [[University of California, Berkeley]], serving as Morrey Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Berkeley from 1987 to 1988. He was a [[Royal Society University Research Fellow]].&lt;ref name=urfrs&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cook|first1=Alan|authorlink1=Alan Cook|title=URFs become FRS: Frances Ashcroft, Athene Donald, and John Pethica|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society|publisher=[[Royal Society]]|location=London|volume=54|issue=3|year=2000|pages=409–411|doi=10.1098/rsnr.2000.0181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ub"/&gt; From 1996 he held a [[Royal Society]] Research Professorship at Cambridge before returning to Berkeley in 1999 as Professor of mathematics.&lt;ref name="ub"/&gt; At Berkeley, he held a [[Miller Institute|Miller Research Professorship]] from 2000 to 2001. 

Borcherds's early work included pioneering results on classification of unimodular lattices, and the introduction of new algebraic objects, most notably [[Vertex operator algebra|vertex algebra]]s and [[Borcherds-Kac-Moody algebra]]s.  These ideas came together in his vertex-algebraic construction and analysis of the fake monster Lie algebra (called the monster Lie algebra at the time).  

Borcherds is best known for his resolution of the Conway-Norton [[monstrous moonshine|monstrous moonshine conjecture]], which describes an intricate relation between the [[monster group]] and [[modular function]]s on the complex upper half-plane.  To prove this conjecture, he drew upon theories that he had previously introduced, namely those of vertex algebras and Borcherds-Kac-Moody algebras, together with techniques of [[string theory]], and applied them to the "moonshine module", a vertex operator algebra with monster symmetry constructed by [[Igor Frenkel]], [[James Lepowsky]], and [[Arne Meurman]].  Additional work in moonshine concerned mod p variants of this conjecture, and were known as modular moonshine.

Later contributions include the theory of Borcherds products, which are holomorphic [[automorphic forms]] on ''O''(''n'',2) that have well-behaved infinite product expansions at cusps.  Borcherds used this theory to resolve some long-standing conjectures concerning quasi-affineness of certain [[moduli space]]s of [[algebraic surface]]s.  More recently, Borcherds has rendered perturbative renormalization, in particular the 't Hooft-Veltman proof of perturbative renormalizability of gauge theory, into rigorous mathematical language.

An interview with [[Simon Singh]] for ''[[The Guardian]]'', in which Borcherds suggested he might have some traits associated with [[Asperger syndrome]],&lt;ref name=singh&gt;Simon Singh, [http://simonsingh.net/media/articles/maths-and-science/interview-with-richard-borcherds/ "Interview with Richard Borcherds"], ''The Guardian'' (28 August 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently led to a chapter about him in a book on autism by [[Simon Baron-Cohen]].&lt;ref name=sbc&gt;{{Cite book|first=Simon|last=Baron-Cohen|authorlink=Simon Baron-Cohen|title=The Essential Difference: Male and Female Brains and the Truth about Autism|chapter=A Professor of Mathematics|publisher= Basic Books|year=2004|isbn=0-465-00556-X}} (see external links) records conversations with Richard Borcherds and his family.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4103969,00.html High flying obsessives], ''The Guardian'', December 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Baron-Cohen concluded that while Borcherds had many autistic traits, he did not merit a formal diagnosis of Asperger syndrome.&lt;ref name=sbc/&gt;

== Awards and honours ==
In 1992 he was one of the first recipients of the [[European Mathematical Society|EMS prizes]] awarded at the first [[European Congress of Mathematics]] in Paris, and in 1994 he was an [[list of International Congresses of Mathematicians Plenary and Invited Speakers|invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians]] in Zurich.&lt;ref name="ams"/&gt; In 1994, he was elected to the Royal Society of Fellows.&lt;ref name="royal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqCmd=show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=(RefNo==%27EC%2F1994%2F05%27) |title=EC/1994/05: Borcherds, Richard Ewen |publisher=The Royal Society |archivedate=27 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PsbbMmJK?url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqCmd=show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%3D%27EC%2F1994%2F05%27%29 |location=London |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 at the 23rd [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in Berlin, Germany he received the [[Fields Medal]] together with [[Maxim Kontsevich]], [[William Timothy Gowers]] and [[Curtis T.

In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society].

In [[financial mathematics]], a '''risk measure''' is used to determine the amount of an [[asset]] or set of assets (traditionally [[currency]]) to be kept in reserve.  The purpose of this reserve is to make the [[downside risk|risks]] taken by [[financial institutions]], such as banks and insurance companies, acceptable to the [[regulator (economics)|regulator]].  In recent years attention has turned towards [[coherent risk measure|convex and coherent risk measurement]].

==Mathematically==
A risk measure is defined as a mapping from a set of random variables to the real numbers. This set of random variables represents portfolio returns. The common notation for a risk measure associated with a random variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\rho(X)&lt;/math&gt;.  A risk measure &lt;math&gt;\rho: \mathcal{L} \to \mathbb{R} \cup \{+\infty\}&lt;/math&gt; should have certain properties:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Artzner|first=Philippe|last2=Delbaen|first2=Freddy|last3=Eber|first3=Jean-Marc|last4=Heath|first4=David|year=1999|title=Coherent Measures of Risk|journal=Mathematical Finance|volume=9|issue=3|pages=203–228|url=http://www.math.ethz.ch/~delbaen/ftp/preprints/CoherentMF.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=February 3, 2011|doi=10.1111/1467-9965.00068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Normalized
: &lt;math&gt;\rho(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

; Translative
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{If}\; a \in \mathbb{R} \; \mathrm{and} \; Z \in \mathcal{L} ,\;\mathrm{then}\; \rho(Z + a) = \rho(Z) - a&lt;/math&gt;

; Monotone
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{If}\; Z_1,Z_2 \in \mathcal{L} \;\mathrm{and}\; Z_1 \leq Z_2 ,\; \mathrm{then} \; \rho(Z_2) \leq \rho(Z_1)&lt;/math&gt;

==Set-valued==
In a situation with &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt;-valued portfolios such that risk can be measured in &lt;math&gt;m \leq d&lt;/math&gt; of the assets, then a set of portfolios is the proper way to depict risk.  Set-valued risk measures are useful for markets with [[transaction cost]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jouini|first=Elyes|last2=Meddeb|first2=Moncef|last3=Touzi|first3=Nizar|year=2004|title=Vector–valued coherent risk measures|journal=Finance and Stochastics|volume=8|issue=4|pages=531–552|doi=10.1007/s00780-004-0127-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematically===
A set-valued risk measure is a function &lt;math&gt;R: L_d^p \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_M&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L_d^p&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Lp space]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_M = \{D \subseteq M: D = cl (D + K_M)\}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;K_M = K \cap M&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a constant [[solvency cone]] and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the set of portfolios of the &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; reference assets.  &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; must have the following properties:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hamel | first1 = A.

; Normalized
: &lt;math&gt;K_M \subseteq R(0) \; \mathrm{and} \; R(0) \cap -\mathrm{int}K_M = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;

; Translative in M
: &lt;math&gt;\forall X \in L_d^p, \forall u \in M: R(X + u1) = R(X) - u&lt;/math&gt;

; Monotone
: &lt;math&gt;\forall X_2 - X_1 \in L_d^p(K) \Rightarrow R(X_2) \supseteq R(X_1)&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==

* [[Value at risk]]
* [[Expected shortfall]]
* [[Entropic value at risk]]
* [[Tail conditional expectation]]
* [[Entropic risk measure]]
* [[Superhedging price]]
* [[Expectile]]

===Variance===
[[Variance]] (or [[standard deviation]]) is '''not''' a risk measure in the above sense. This can be seen since it has neither the translation property nor monotonicity.  That is, &lt;math&gt;Var(X + a) = Var(X) \neq Var(X) - a&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, and a simple counterexample for monotonicity can be found.  The standard deviation is a [[deviation risk measure]]. To avoid any confusion, note that deviation risk measures, such as [[variance]] and [[standard deviation]] are sometimes called risk measures in different fields.

==Relation to acceptance set==
There is a [[bijection|one-to-one]] correspondence between an [[acceptance set]] and a corresponding risk measure.  As defined below it can be shown that &lt;math&gt;R_{A_R}(X) = R(X)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_{R_A} = A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Andreas H.

===Risk measure to acceptance set===
* If &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is a (scalar) risk measure then &lt;math&gt;A_{\rho} = \{X \in L^p: \rho(X) \leq 0\}&lt;/math&gt; is an acceptance set.
* If &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a set-valued risk measure then &lt;math&gt;A_R = \{X \in L^p_d: 0 \in R(X)\}&lt;/math&gt; is an acceptance set.

===Acceptance set to risk measure===
* If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an acceptance set (in 1-d) then &lt;math&gt;\rho_A(X) = \inf\{u \in \mathbb{R}: X + u1 \in A\}&lt;/math&gt; defines a (scalar) risk measure.
* If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an acceptance set then &lt;math&gt;R_A(X) = \{u \in M: X + u1 \in A\}&lt;/math&gt; is a set-valued risk measure.

==Relation with deviation risk measure==
There is a [[bijection|one-to-one]] relationship between a [[deviation risk measure]] ''D'' and an expectation-bounded risk measure &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; where for any &lt;math&gt;X \in \mathcal{L}^2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;D(X) = \rho(X - \mathbb{E}[X])&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\rho(X) = D(X) - \mathbb{E}[X]&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is called expectation bounded if it satisfies &lt;math&gt;\rho(X) &gt; \mathbb{E}[-X]&lt;/math&gt; for any nonconstant ''X'' and &lt;math&gt;\rho(X) = \mathbb{E}[-X]&lt;/math&gt; for any constant ''X''.&lt;ref name="Rockafellar"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Deviation Measures in Risk Analysis and Optimization|first1=Tyrrell|last1=Rockafellar|first2=Stanislav|last2=Uryasev|first3=Michael|last3=Zabarankin|year=2002|url=http://www.ise.ufl.edu/uryasev/Deviation_measures_wp.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=October 13, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916144136/http://www.ise.ufl.edu/uryasev/DEVIATION_MEASURES_WP.pdf|archivedate=September 16, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rooted graphs may also be known (depending on their application) as '''pointed graphs''' or '''flow graphs'''. In some of the applications of these graphs, there is an additional requirement that the whole graph be [[Reachability|reachable]] from the root vertex.

==Variations==
In [[topological graph theory]], the notion of a rooted graph may be extended to consider multiple vertices or multiple edges as roots. The former are sometimes called vertex-rooted graphs in order to distinguish them from edge-rooted graphs in this context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=Jonathan L.|last1=Gross|first2=Jay|last2=Yellen|first3=Ping|last3=Zhang|author3-link=Ping Zhang (graph theorist)|title=Handbook of Graph Theory|edition=2nd|year=2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-8018-0|pages=764–765}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graphs with multiple nodes designated as roots are also of some interest in [[combinatorics]], in the area of [[random graphs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Joel|last=Spencer|authorlink=Joel Spencer|title=The Strange Logic of Random Graphs|year=2001|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-41654-8|at=chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These graphs are also called '''multiply rooted graphs'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Harary|1955|page=455}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms '''rooted [[directed graph]]''' or '''rooted digraph''' also see variation in definitions. The obvious transplant is to consider a digraph rooted by identifying a particular node as root.&lt;ref name="greedintro"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Björner|first1=Anders|last2=Ziegler|first2=Günter M.|authorlink2=Günter M.

''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'' defines rooted digraphs slightly more broadly, namely a directed graph is called rooted if it has ''at least one'' node that can reach all the other nodes; Knuth notes that the notion thus defined is a sort of intermediate between the notions of [[strongly connected]] and [[Digraph (mathematics)#Digraph_connectivity|connected digraph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Knuth|first=Donald|authorlink=Donald Knuth|title=The Art Of Computer Programming, Volume 1, 3/E|year=1997|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=0-201-89683-4|page=372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
===Flow graphs===
In [[computer science]], rooted graphs in which the root vertex can reach all other vertices are called '''flow graphs''' or '''flowgraphs'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gross|Yellen|Zhang|2013|page=1372}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes an additional restriction is added specifying that a flow graph must have a single exit ([[sink (graph theory)|sink]]) vertex as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Norman Elliott|last1=Fenton|first2=Gillian A.|last2=Hill|title=Systems Construction and Analysis: A Mathematical and Logical Framework|year=1993|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-707431-9|page=319}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flow graphs may be viewed as [[abstraction]]s of [[flow chart]]s, with the non-structural elements (node contents and types) removed.&lt;ref name="Zuse1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Angelina|last1=Samaroo|first2=Geoff|last2=Thompson|first3=Peter|last3=Williams|title=Software Testing: An ISTQB-ISEB Foundation Guide|year=2010|publisher=BCS, The Chartered Institute|isbn=978-1-906124-76-2|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the best known sub-class of flow graphs are [[control flow graph]]s, used in [[compiler]]s and [[program analysis]]. An arbitrary flow graph may converted to a control flow graph by performing an [[edge contraction]] on every edge that is the only outgoing edge from its source and the only incoming edge into its target.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Peri L.|last1=Tarr|first2=Alexander L.|last2=Wolf|title=Engineering of Software: The Continuing Contributions of Leon J. Osterweil|year=2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-19823-6|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another type of flow graph commonly used is the [[call graph]], in which nodes correspond to entire [[subroutine]]s.&lt;ref name="Jalote1997"/&gt;

The general notion of flow graph has been called '''program graph''',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=K.|last1=Thulasiraman|first2=M. N.

When required to have a single exit, flow graphs have two properties not shared with directed graphs in general. Flow graphs can be nested, which is the equivalent of a subroutine call (although there is no notion of passing parameters), and flow graphs can also be sequenced, which is the equivalent of sequential execution of two pieces of code.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fenton|Hill|1993|page=323}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Prime flow graphs'' are defined as flow graphs that cannot be decomposed via nesting or sequencing using a chosen pattern of subgraphs, for example the primitives of [[structured programming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fenton|Hill|1993|page=339}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical research has been done on determining, for example, the proportion of prime flow graphs given a chosen set of graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | doi = 10.1017/S0963548300001991| title = Asymptotic Enumeration of Predicate-Junction Flowgraphs| journal = [[Combinatorics, Probability and Computing]]| volume = 5| issue = 3| pages = 215| year = 2008| last1 = Cooper | first1 = C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Set theory===
[[Peter Aczel]] has used rooted directed graphs in which the whole graph is reachable from the root (which he calls '''accessible pointed graphs''') to formulate [[Aczel's anti-foundation axiom]] in [[non-well-founded set theory]]. In this context, the vertices of a graph model sets within the set theory, and their adjacency relation models the relation of one set belonging to another. The anti-foundation axiom states that every accessible pointed graph models a family of sets in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|mr= 0940014|authorlink= Peter Aczel|last= Aczel|first= Peter|title= Non-well-founded sets.|series= CSLI Lecture Notes|volume= 14|publisher= Stanford University, Center for the Study of Language and Information|place= Stanford, CA|year= 1988|isbn= 0-937073-22-9|url= http://standish.stanford.edu/pdf/00000056.pdf|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161017184455/http://standish.stanford.edu/pdf/00000056.pdf|archivedate= 2016-10-17|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combinatorial enumeration==
The number of rooted undirected graphs for 1, 2, ... nodes is 1, 2, 6, 20, 90, 544, ... {{OEIS|id=A000666}}

==Related concepts==
A special case of interest are [[rooted tree]]s, the [[Tree (graph theory)|trees]] with a distinguished root vertex. If the directed paths from the root in the rooted digraph are additionally restricted to be unique, then the notion obtained is that of (rooted) [[Arborescence (graph theory)|arborescence]]—the directed-graph equivalent of a rooted tree.&lt;ref name="poly"/&gt; A rooted graph contains an arborescence with the same root if and only if the whole graph can be reached from the root, and computer scientists have studied algorithmic problems of finding optimal arborescences.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Semantic analysis (computational)''' is a composite of the "[[Semantic analysis (linguistics)|semantic analysis]]" and the "computational" components.

"Semantic analysis" refers to a formal analysis of meaning, and "computational" refer to approaches that in principle support effective implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, P., and Bos, J. (2005), [https://philpapers.org/rec/BLARAI Representation and Inference for Natural Language : A First Course in Computational Semantics], CSLI Publications. {{ISBN|1-57586-496-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The teaching dimension of a finite concept class can be used to give a lower and an upper bound on the [[membership query cost]] of the concept class.

In [[Stasys Jukna]]'s book "Extremal Combinatorics", a lower bound is given for the teaching dimension:

Let ''C'' be a concept class over a finite domain ''X''. If the size of ''C'' is greater than 
:&lt;math&gt;2^k{|X|\choose k},&lt;/math&gt;
then the teaching dimension of ''C'' is greater than ''k''.

In the theory of [[dynamical system]]s, an '''unbounded system''' is a [[system]] that has no [[Upper and lower bounds|bound]]; i.e., one that can expand forever with no limit.

'''Yves Gaucher''' (January 3, 1934&amp;nbsp;– September 8, 2000)&lt;ref name="canadian encyclopedia"/&gt; was a [[Canadian]] [[abstract (art)|abstract]] [[painter]] and [[printmaker]].&lt;ref name="national gallery"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artist.php?iartistid=1967 | title=Yves Gaucher | publisher=National Gallery of Canada | work=Artists A to Z | accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a member of the [[Order of Canada]] in 1981, and is considered the leader amongst [[Quebec]]'s printmakers in the 1950s and 60s.&lt;ref name="national gallery" /&gt; His work has been featured in multiple important galleries, including the [[National Gallery of Canada]] in [[Ottawa]], the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]], and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name="godard"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.godardgallery.com/gaucher.htm | title=Yves Gaucher | publisher=Mira Godard Gallery | accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Yves Gaucher was born on January 3, 1934 in [[Montreal]]&lt;ref name="canadian encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/yves-gaucher | title=Yves Gaucher | publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] | work=Artists | accessdate=8 July 2013 | author=Nasgaard, Roald}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Tancrède Gaucher, a pharmacist and optician, and Laura Élie Gaucher, as the sixth of eight children.&lt;ref name="macm"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://media.macm.org/biobiblio/gaucher_y/pdf/ChronoYvesGaucherE.pdf | title=Chronology | accessdate=8 July 2013 | author=Perreault, Martine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended the [[Collège Brébeuf]] in Montreal in 1948, but was expelled for drawing immoral pictures.&lt;ref name="macm" /&gt; These pictures were in fact copied from his textbooks on Ancient Greek and Egyptian art.&lt;ref name="macm" /&gt; A year after his expulsion he switched to an English-language Protestant school, [[Sir George Williams College]] and it was there that he took his first art course.&lt;ref name="Art Canada Institute"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.aci-iac.ca/yves-gaucher/biography | title=Yves Gaucher: Life &amp; Work | publisher= Art Canada Institute | work=Biography | accessdate=2 October 2015 | author=Nasgaard, Roald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music was very important to Gaucher. Raised in a musical home, where everyone played an instrument, Gaucher took up the trumpet at age twelve. His first full-time job was with the CBC, where he started in the mailroom. His ambition, however, was to become a radio announcer with his own jazz program. In the meantime he played gigs at night, and also organized a few jam sessions in 1955–56 at Galerie L'Actuelle, founded by [[Guido Molinari]].&lt;ref name="Art Canada Institute"/&gt;

After the CBC he then went on to become an employee of the Canadian Pacific Steamship Line, working in its Montreal and [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] offices.&lt;ref name="macm" /&gt;

After meeting [[Arthur Lismer]], a [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] artist, Gaucher decided to study art seriously. He enrolled at the École des Beaux-Arts in Montreal in 1954, but was expelled in 1956 for taking only the courses he was interested in. After his expulsion, he continued to study art on his own, while earning an income through various jobs.&lt;ref name="macm" /&gt; Gaucher then returned to the École to study printmaking with [[Albert Dumouchel]], where he created a controversial technique of heavy embossing. When met with criticism, he described his technique as a way of challenging the traditional "taboos".&lt;ref name="national gallery" /&gt;

==Art career==
===Early printmaking success===
Gaucher's art career began when he set up an exhibition at the Galerie d'Échange in Montreal in 1957. He enjoyed success afterwards, and as a result became the founding president of Associations des Peintures-Gravures de Montreal in 1960.&lt;ref name="national gallery" /&gt;

In 1962, Gaucher travelled to Europe on a grant from the [[Canada Council]]. There, in [[Paris]], he encountered the music of [[Anton Webern]], which became a major influence on him. In his artworks, he began to incorporate more irregular geometries as opposed to strictly geometric forms, as well as greater contrasts of colour. This, he felt, would better represent the [[atonality]] of Webern's music.&lt;ref name="national gallery" /&gt;

Gaucher's prints of the late 1950s and early 1960s were technically innovative and demonstrated extensive experimentation with relief and lamination, and have been described as delighting in "material physicality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.aci-iac.ca/yves-gaucher/technique-and-style#Printmaking | title=Yves Gaucher: Life &amp; Work | publisher= Art Canada Institute | work=Technique &amp; Style: Printmaking | accessdate=2 October 2015 | author=Nasgaard, Roald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modernism===
By 1964, however, Gaucher began to focus on painting instead of printmaking. A major influence in his early paintings was the style of artists such as [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Mark Rothko]], part of an art school known as the New York Modernists. This led him to create similar works which emulated the structure of [[modernist]] art. Some of the characteristics of the artwork he produced in this period include the use of regular geometric objects and flat panels of colour on unusually large canvases. He also created art using mathematical relationships, including [[symmetry]], patterning, and spatial relationships, which eventually led to monochromatic works.&lt;ref name="national gallery" /&gt;

In 1966, works by Gaucher along with those of [[Alex Colville]] and [[Sorel Etrog]] represented Canada at the [[Venice Biennale]].&lt;ref name=NGC_Venice&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Canadian Exhibitions |work=National Gallery of Canada at the Venice Biennale |url=http://www.gallery.ca/venice/80.htm |publisher=National Gallery of Canada |accessdate=12 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013125245/http://www.gallery.ca/venice/80.htm |archivedate=October 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1967 to 1969, Gaucher created a series of "Grey on Grey" paintings. These works, amongst his most important, were meant to be interpreted in two different ways. As individual paintings, they would be seen based on their linear movement; as a whole, they were an environment, based on colour.&lt;ref name="molinas"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.galeriemolinas.com/artist.php?id=426 | title=Yves Gaucher | publisher=Galerie Molinas | accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaucher was crucial in the development of the colour band style of art, which was first created in 1970. This form of painting consists of wide stripes of uniform colours. Gaucher also extended  colour band painting to include works of  horizontal planes of contrasting colour. Gaucher's interest in mathematical art persisted, as he created works based on chaos theory  and the diagonal line.&lt;ref name="national gallery" /&gt;

In 1980, Gaucher was nominated for the [[Order of Canada]], and was named a member in 1981.&lt;ref name="macm" /&gt; In this period he taught at [[Concordia University]] in Montreal,&lt;ref name="national gallery" /&gt; where among his pupils was [[Joan Rankin]].&lt;ref name="HellerHeller2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jules Heller|author2=Nancy G. Heller|title=North American Women Artists of the Twentieth Century: A Biographical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYxmAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR11|date=19 December 2013|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1-135-63882-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a shoulder injury and other health problems would force him to paint on smaller surfaces, and he returned to creating collages, one of his earlier practices.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/713649/Yves-Gaucher | title=Yves Gaucher | publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]]&lt;ref name=RCA1880&gt;{{cite web|title=Members since 1880 |url=http://www.rca-arc.ca/en/about_members/since1880.asp |publisher=Royal Canadian Academy of Arts |accessdate=11 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526215339/http://www.rca-arc.ca/en/about_members/since1880.asp |archivedate=May 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Montreal on September 8, 2000.&lt;ref name="canadian encyclopedia" /&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1964, he married Germaine Chaussé. They had two sons; Benoit Gaucher was born in 1968, and Denis Gaucher in 1970.&lt;ref name="macm" /&gt;

The [[Character (symbol)|character]] '''∂''' ([[HTML element]]: '''&amp;amp;#8706;''' or '''&amp;amp;part;''', [[Unicode]]: U+2202) or '''&lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt;''' is a stylized ''[[d]]'' mainly used as a [[Table of mathematical symbols|mathematical symbol]] to denote a [[partial derivative]] such as &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt; (read as "the partial derivative of ''z'' with respect to ''x''").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/872345701|title=Calculus : a complete course|last=Christopher|first=Essex|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=9780321781079|location=|pages=682|oclc=872345701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The symbol was originally introduced by [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] in 1786, but gained popularity when it was used by [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi]] in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;Adrien-Marie Legendre, "Memoire sur la manière de distinguer les maxima des minima dans le Calcul des Variations," ''Histoire de l'Academie Royale des Sciences'' (1786), pp. 7–37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, "De determinantibus Functionalibus," ''[[Crelle's Journal]]'' '''22''' (1841), pp. 319–352.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/calculus.html|author=Aldrich, John|title=Earliest Uses of Symbols of Calculus|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''∂''' is also used to denote the following:
* The [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial(x, y, z)}{\partial(u, v, w)}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] of a set in topology.
* The boundary operator on a [[chain complex]] in [[homological algebra]].
* The boundary operator of a [[differential graded algebra]].
* The [[Dolbeault operator]] on [[complex differential form]]s.

The symbol is referred to as "del"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=R.S. |last=Bhardwaj |year=2005 |title=Mathematics for Economics &amp; Business |edition=2nd |page=6.4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qSlGMwpNueoC&amp;lpg=SA6-PA4&amp;pg=SA6-PA4}}&lt;/ref&gt; (not to be confused with [[Del|∇]], also known as "del"), "dee",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Richard A. |last=Silverman |year=1989 |title=Essential Calculus: With Applications |page=216 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CQ-kqE9Yo9YC&amp;lpg=PA216&amp;pg=PA216}}&lt;/ref&gt; "partial dee",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Malcolm |last=Pemberton |first2=Nicholas |last2=Rau |year=2011 |title=Mathematics for Economists: An Introductory Textbook |page=271 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H92Z6yfhxk8C&amp;lpg=PA271&amp;pg=PA271}}&lt;/ref&gt; "partial" (especially in [[LaTeX]]), "round d",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Munem|first1=Mustafa|last2=Foulis|first2=David|title=Calculus with Analytic Geometry|date=1978|publisher=Worth Publishers, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-87901-087-8|page=828}}&lt;/ref&gt; "curly dee", "doh",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Elizabeth |last=Bowman |year=2014 |title=Video Lecture for University of Alabama in Huntsville |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0AVgBgHhUg }}&lt;/ref&gt; "die"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/872345701|title=Calculus : a complete course|last=Christopher|first=Essex|last2=Adams|first2=Robert Alexander|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=9780321781079|edition=Eighth|location=|pages=682|oclc=872345701}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "dabba".&lt;ref&gt;Gokhale, Mujumdar, Kulkarni, Singh, Atal, ''Engineering Mathematics I'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CbIqX6TxJVMC&amp;pg=SA10-PA2 p. 10.2], Nirali Prakashan {{ISBN|8190693549}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
