'''Air Albania''' is the national [[flag carrier]] [[airline]] of Albania,&lt;ref name="Worldbulletin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/headlines/205263/air-albania-to-launch-flights-in-september |title=Air Albania to launch flights in September |publisher=Worldbulletin News |date=24 August 2018 |access-date=24 August 2018 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TopChannel"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://top-channel.tv/2018/09/14/avioni-i-pare-i-air-albania-ulet-ne-rinas-rama-nisi-nje-epoke-e-re/ |title= Avioni i parë i “Air Albania” ulet në Rinas, Rama: Nisi një epokë e re |publisher=[[Top Channel]] |date=14 September 2018 |access-date=14 September 2018 |language=Albanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; headquartered in [[Rinas]], [[Albania]]. The airline's [[airline hub|hub]] is at [[Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza]], where the airline's corporate headquarters are also located. 

Air Albania was founded on 16 May 2018 by a consortium led by the Albanian and Turkish governments under a [[public–private partnership]]. [[Turkish Airlines]], a founding partner, owns 49.12% of Air Albania.&lt;ref name="Exit.al"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://exit.al/en/2018/08/03/air-albania-deal-also-violated-stabilization-and-association-agreement-with-eu/ |title=Air Albania Deal Also Violated Stabilization and Association Agreement with EU |publisher=Exit.al |date=8 August 2018 |access-date=26 August 2018 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining 50.88% is publicly traded,&lt;ref name="Exit.al" /&gt; currently split between [[Albcontrol]], a corporation owned by the Albanian government, with roughly 10% and MDN Investment, a privately-held company in Albania, with roughly 41% of shares.&lt;ref name="TopChannel" /&gt;

==History==
Albania's previous national flag carrier airline, [[Albanian Airlines]] was rendered defunct when the Albanian government had revoked its license to operate in Albania on 11 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/airline-owned-by-suspected-mubarak-money-man-grounded|title=Albania to Ground Airline Owned by Arrested Businessman|publisher=Balkan Insight|date=14 November 2011|accessdate=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albanian Prime Minister [[Edi Rama]] had announced in an interview with Enver Robelli on 30 March 2017 that the Albanian government was planning to create an "airline in Albania with cooperation from Turkish Airlines and [[AtlasGlobal]]". On 8 May 2017, Rama and [[M. İlker Aycı|İlker Aycı]], executive director of Turkish Airlines, released a joint press statement, declaring that an Albania-based airline was in the works, with support from Turkish president [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]. It was later revealed that Air Albania's foundation was also tied to the creation of an international airport in [[Vlorë]], also planned in cooperation with the Turkish government. Rama had unveiled the name of the new airline, Air Albania, on 21 November 2017.&lt;ref name="Exit.al-Alt"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://exit.al/en/2018/06/19/who-is-paying-for-air-albania-exit-explains/ |title=Who Is Paying for Air Albania? – Exit Explains |publisher=Exit.al |date=19 June 2018 |access-date=26 August 2018 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Air Albania was officially founded on 16 May 2018 by Turkish Airlines, Albcontrol and MDN Investment.

===Controversy===
Controversy behind the airline's founding erupted when it was discovered that founding partner MDN Investment had been founded 9 days prior, on 7 May 2018. [[Turkish Airlines]] contributed 30 million dollars in their start-up.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kokpit.aero/30-milyon-dolara-resmen-ortak&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, on 16 May 2018, the Albanian government had given control of the land on which the [[Tirana International Airport]] was built to [[Albcontrol]] in order to participate in the public-private partnership. Due to lack of public comment, Albania may have violated the [[Stabilisation and Association Process|Stabilisation and Association Agreement]] it had signed during its [[Accession of Albania to the European Union|accession process]] to the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="Exit.al" /&gt;

==Destinations==
The first flights of Air Albania will be first from Tirana to Istanbul. The airline will then expand its destinations to other countries in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]]. On 20 August 2018, it was confirmed that the first flight will depart in early September 2018. The first destination will be [[Istanbul]], operated by an [[Airbus A319]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://americaneye.al/linja-e-pare-ajrore-shqiptare-rama-air-albania-nis-fluturimet-se-shpejti/|title=Air Albania nis fluturimet së shpejti|date=11 May 2018|language=Albanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''An Historical Description of Three Kingdoms: Congo, Matamba, and Angola''''' ([[Italian language|Italian]] ''Istorica descrizione de' tre' regni Congo, Matamba et Angola'') is an extensive work written by [[Giovanni Cavazzi da Montecuccolo|Giovanni Antonio Cavazzi da Montecuccolo]], an [[Italians|Italian]] [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] [[missionary]], over a long period while working as a missionary in [[Angola]], between 1654 and 1677.  

The work was commissioned by the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Holy Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith]] when Cavazzi returned from his first missionary trip to Angola in 1668.  He completed a draft of the manuscript of the work around 1671, but opposition from the Church, primarily because of many miracle stories, which had fallen out of favor in the church, prevented its publication.  After an interval, the task of editing the work was given to another Capuchin, Fortunato da Alamandini, who edited it, and it was eventually published in 1687 in [[Bologna]].  A second edition appeared in [[Milan]] in 1690

Cavazzi probably began writing this work around 1660, perhaps in response to his witnessing the conversion of [[Queen Nzinga|Queen Njinga]] to Christianity, which he regarded as something of a miracle.&lt;ref&gt;John Thornton, Introduction,[http://www.bu.edu/afam/faculty/john-thornton/cavazzi-missione-evangelica-2 Missione Evangelica] &lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote several drafts of a work which he called "Missione Evangelica" which he completed in 1668.  This work, which is in the possession of the Araldi Family of [[Modena, Italy]], was published in English translation on the internet by John Thornton, with a full introduction, and a comparison between this early manuscript and that of the eventual book.&lt;ref&gt;John Thornton, [http://www.bu.edu/afam/faculty/john-thornton/cavazzi-missione-evangelica-2 Cavazzi Missione Evangelica]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kočevski zbor.jpg|thumbnail|Assembly of the Delegates of the Slovene Nation]]
The '''Assembly of the Delegates of the Slovene Nation''' ({{lang-sl|Zbor odposlancev slovenskega naroda}}) or the '''Kočevje Assembly''' ({{lang|sl|Kočevski zbor}}) was the session held in [[Kočevje]] in what is now southern [[Slovenia]] over the period 1–3 October 1943 by the highest representative body of the anti-fascist Partisan movement in [[Slovenia]] during [[World War II]]. The assembly elected the legislative body of the Slovene liberated areas.

In September 1943, just as the Italians [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|capitulated]] to the Allies, the [[Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation]] conducted public elections in liberated areas of the Italian-annexed [[Province of Ljubljana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.si/books?id=PScNAQAAIAAJ |title=Razvoj ljudske oblasti med NOB v Jugoslaviji: izbrani dokumenti |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Development of People's Authority during the National Liberation War in Yugoslavia: Chosen Documents |first=Vanek |last=Šiftar |publisher=Obzorja [Horizons] |year=1976 |page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 572 of the directly elected and 78 indirectly elected delegates of the [[Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation]] met at Kočevje in what then became the German-occupied [[Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.si/books?id=nSgWAQAAMAAJ |title=Razdvojeni narod: Slovenija 1941-1945: okupacija, kolaboracija, državljanska vojna |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Divided Nation: Slovenia 1941–1945: Occupation, Collaboration, Civil War |first=Tamara |last=Griesser-Pečar |year=2007 |page=164 |isbn= 9789610102083}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its deliberations,{{when|date=April 2013}} the Assembly elected the 120-member legislative body known as the [[Slovene National Liberation Committee]] ({{lang|sl|Slovenski narodnoosvobodilni odbor}}), and the Presidium of the Committee assumed executive powers. The Committee sent representatives to the second session of [[AVNOJ]] held at [[Jajce]], in central [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] on 29 November 1943. They were instrumental in adding the self-determination clause to the resolution on the establishment of the future federal Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="Tomasevich113"&gt;{{cite book |first=Jozo |last=Tomasevich |title=War and Revolution in Yugoslavia, 1941-1945: Occupation and Collaboration |volume=2 |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2001 |location=San Francisco |isbn=0804736154 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fqUSGevFe5MC&amp;printsec=frontcover |ref=Tomasevich_2001 |pages=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Črnomelj Session]] on 19–20 February 1944, the Slovene National Liberation Committee renamed itself to the Slovene National Liberation Council ({{lang|sl|Slovenski narodnoosvobodilni svet}}, {{lang|sl|SNOS}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://books.google.si/books?id=AhkkAQAAIAAJ |title=Slovenci in država: zbornik prispevkov z znanstvenega posveta na SAZU (od 9. do 11. novembra 1994) |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Slovenes and the State: Proceedings from the Scientific Panel at the SAZU (from 9 until 11 November 1994) |publisher=Slovenian Academy of Arts and Sciences |editor-first=Bogo |editor-last=Grafenauer |year=1995 |page=256 |isbn=86-7131-089-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the Slovene equivalent of similar councils established by the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] in other regions of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="Tomasevich113"/&gt; After its creation, SNOS acceded to all decisions of the second session of AVNOJ and also established an interim government.&lt;ref name="Tomasevich113"/&gt;

[[File:Gudbrandsbiblia.jpg|thumb|Title page of the elaborate printed bible of Guðbrandur Þorláksson, bishop, Hólar, 1584]]
The New Testament was the first book printed in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]. It was translated by [[Oddur Gottskálksson]] (whose father was [[Norway|Norwegian]]) and published in 1540 (text here&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://is.wikisource.org/wiki/N%C3%BDja_testamenti_Odds_Gottsk%C3%A1lkssonar|title=Nýja testamenti Odds Gottskálkssonar|publisher=Is.wikisource.org|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Forty-four years later the whole Bible was printed in Icelandic thanks to [[Guðbrandur Þorláksson]], a Protestant [[bishop]] at [[Hólar]].

Afterwards, a number of other translations followed, such the ''Waysenhússbiblía'', a reworking of a 1644 Bible from Hólar and printed by G.&amp;nbsp;F. Risel in Copenhagen. In 1813, in the same city, the [[British and Foreign Bible Society|British Bible Society]] published the ''Grútarbiblía'' (or ''Hendersonsbiblía''), just two years before the founding of the Icelandic Bible Society (Hið íslenzka Biblíufélag) by the British Bible Society's Ebenezer Henderson. 

There came out a new translation in 1841, which was revised in 1863 by Professor (afterwards Bishop) Pétur Pétursson and Sigurður Melsteð, who compared it with the Greek and Hebrew originals and with the Norwegian, Danish, English and French versions. This edition (just the New Testament and Psalms) was edited by Eiríkr Magnusson and was reprinted in 1866, now as one volume with just the New Testament and Psalms and also another with the entire Old and New Testaments. Both the 1863 and 1866 editions were printed by the "Brit. Bible Soc." at [[Oxford University Press|Oxford]], and this seems to be the translation in the illustrated New Testament of the [[Scripture Gift Mission]] in 1903 ([[London]] &amp; [[Akureyri]]). By at least 1906, the British Bible Society (now printing in [[Reykjavík]]) put out a new New Testament translation based on the original texts, by Haraldur Níelsson, and by 1908 released the entire Bible.

The current publisher of the Icelandic Bible is the Icelandic Bible Society. In 1859 they printed the so-called ''Reykjavíkurbiblía'', essentially the ''Viðeyjarbiblía'' from 18 years earlier. By at least 1899 they were printing the Old Testament translations of Þórir Þórðarson, which they used beyond the start of the 21st century.  Their latest full translation, a new one by Guðrún Guðlaugsdóttir, was published in 2007.

The history of film making in the [[Republic of Macedonia]] dates back over 110 years.{{cn|date=March 2016}} The first film to be produced on the territory of the present-day the country was made in 1895 by [[Manakis brothers|Janaki and Milton Manaki]] in [[Bitola]]. From then, continuing to the present, Macedonian film makers, in Macedonia and from around the world, have been producing many films. The country now produces three or four films per year.&lt;ref name="Macedonia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-macedonia-bows-foreign-language-634305 |title=Oscars: Macedonia Bows Out of Foreign Language Category Race |accessdate=2013-09-23 |work=Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the past century, the medium of film has depicted the history, culture and everyday life of the Macedonian people. Over the years many Macedonian films have been presented at film festivals around the world and several of these films have won prestigious awards.

The first Macedonian [[feature film]] was ''[[Frosina]]'', released in 1952. The screenplay was written by [[Vlado Maleski]], who wrote the lyrics for the [[Denes nad Makedonija|Macedonian national anthem]], and it was directed by [[Vojislav Nanović]]. The first feature film in colour was ''[[Miss Stone]]'', a movie about a Protestant missionary in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Macedonia]]. It was released in 1958.

The most famous Macedonian director is [[Milčo Mančevski]], whose debut feature film ''[[Before the Rain (1994 film)|Before the Rain]]'' was nominated for an [[Academy Award]]. 
The highest grossing feature film in the Republic of Macedonia was ''[[Bal-Can-Can]]'', having been seen by over 500,000 people in its first year alone.

The '''[[coat of arms]] of [[Somalia]]''' were adopted on October 10, 1956. The [[Leopard (heraldry)|leopard]]s which support the [[shield]] and the white star were also found on the coat of arms used in [[Italian Somaliland]]. Formerly, the arms of Somalia from June 8, 1919 featured a shield divided horizontally by a wavy white line (Smith, 1980). The top half of the shield was blue, with a leopard in natural color surmounted by a white five-pointed star.

It is put on fire until well heated, then lifted with a hook, and [[dough]] is put into it and covered with a [[sač]]. The sač is covered with ashes and live coals. In that way the [[bread]] is baked on both sides: on the lower side from the heated crepulja and on top from live coals.

On 20 February 1941, the Dutch government in exile in London instituted several new awards for bravery. The new way that wars were fought, with civilian resistance and the merchant navy in great peril, made this necessary. Amongst the new decorations was the "'''Cross of Merit'''", (Dutch: "Kruis van Verdienste") an award for "working in the interest of the Netherlands while faced with enemy actions and distinguishing oneself through valor and resolute behavior". One did not have to be on the front line to win this award.

The cross has often been awarded to those who managed to flee to England and to the armed resistance. It was rarely awarded after the [[Korean War]], but since the [[Afghanistan_War_order_of_battle#Netherlands|fighting of the Netherlands army in Afghanistan]], [[Uruzgan]], this [[World War II]] decoration has been awarded again on a regular basis with the latest on 7 October 2009 to eleven Dutch soldiers. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defensie.nl/actueel/nieuws/2009/10/07/46136801/Dapperheidsonderscheidingen_voor_Afghanistangangers_video Bravery award for Afghanistan veterans] – Website [[Ministry of Defence (Netherlands)|Netherlands Ministry of Defence]]&lt;/ref&gt;
During the second world war in the Far East this cross was awarded to several people employed by the [[Koninklijke Paketvaart-Maatschappij]] (K.P.M.) as some of their merchant navy ships had been commissioned by the Dutch Navy during the [[Battle of the Java Sea]].

In case of repeated awards a large "2" or "3" is pinned to the ribbon.

The Cross of Merit is the fourth-highest military decoration still being awarded for bravery and has precedence after the [[Bronze Cross (Netherlands)|Bronze Cross]].

The '''Group of 24''' ('''G-24'''), a chapter of the [[Group of 77|G-77]], was established in 1971 to coordinate the positions of [[developing country|developing countries]] on international monetary and development finance issues and to ensure that their interests were adequately represented in negotiations on international monetary matters.

The group, which is officially called the '''Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four on International Monetary Affairs and Development''', is not an organ of the [[International Monetary Fund]], but the IMF provides secretariat services for the Group. Its meetings usually take place twice a year, prior to the International Monetary and Financial Committee and Development Committee meetings, to enable developing country members to discuss agenda items beforehand. Although membership in the G-24 is strictly limited to 24 countries, any member of the G-77 can join discussions. [[China]] has been a "special invitee" since the Gabon meetings of 1981. The group also has three active observer countries; [[Indonesia]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]]; and 11 institutional observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.g24.org/observers/|title=Observers {{!}} G-24|work=G-24|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the Group added four new members: [[Ecuador]], [[Haiti]], [[Kenya]], and [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boughton|first=James M.|date=2017-08-30|title=Southern Accents: The Voice of Developing Countries in International Financial Governance|url=https://www.cigionline.org/publications/southern-accents-voice-developing-countries-international-financial-governance|journal=Centre for International Governance Innovation|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chairman of the G-24 is [[Julio Velarde]], Governor of Banco Central De Reserva Del Peru. The First Vice-Chair is [[Kenneth Ofori-Atta]], Minister of Finance, Ghana., and the Second Vice-Chair: [[Abdolnaser Hemmati|Abdolnasser Hemmati]], Governor of the Central Bank of Iran. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.g24.org/organizational-structure-and-governance/|title=Organizational Structure and Governance {{!}} G-24|work=G-24|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Member countries by Region==

Following is the list of members of G-24:

'''Region I (Africa):'''  [[Algeria]], [[Ivory Coast|Côte d'Ivoire]], the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Egypt]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Gabon]], [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Morocco]], [[Nigeria]], and [[South Africa]].

'''Region II (Latin America and the Caribbean):''' [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Haiti]], [[Mexico]], [[Peru]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Venezuela]].

'''Region III (Asia):''' [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Lebanon]], [[Pakistan]], [[Philippines]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.g24.org/members/|title=Members {{!}} G-24|work=G-24|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation of the G-24 ==
The G-24 operates at two levels:

* The political level, consisting of Ministers, their Deputies, the Bureau, and other Washington-based representatives who participate in the Committee of the Whole and in any ad hoc meetings; and
* The operational level, which is run by the G-24 Liaison Office, and includes the G-24 Secretariat and the Research Coordinator.

The governing body of the G-24 meets twice a year, preceding the Spring and Fall meetings of the International Monetary and Financial Committee and the Joint Development Committee of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The plenary G-24 meetings are addressed by the heads of the [[IMF]] and the [[World Bank Group]] as well as by senior officials of the UN system. Issues are first discussed by the Deputies and culminate at the Ministerial level by the approval of a document that sets out the consensus views of member countries. The Ministerial document is released as a public Communiqué at a press conference held at the end of the meetings. Decision-making within the G-24 is by consensus.

==G-24 Research and Publications ==
The Group also maintains a research and work program that revolves around issues of importance to developing countries. In particular, the program focuses on three key areas: The global economy and growth agenda, international financial architecture, and financing for development. The global economy and growth agenda emphasizes structural transformation, trade and technology, and inequality. international financial architecture covers reform and governance of global financial institutions, the global financial safety net and managing capital flows, and financial regulation. financing for development includes taxation and international tax cooperation, infrastructure financing, debt management and sustainability, and financial inclusion. Much of the group's research, including books, policy briefs and working papers can be found on its website.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.g24.org/working-papers/|title=Working Papers {{!}} G-24|work=G-24|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization has matched over 290,000 volunteers to nearly 3,300 organizations worldwide.&lt;ref name="npbio" /&gt; In total 1.5 million+ patients have received health care as a result of its indirect and direct patient care programs.

==History==
In 2005, during his first year at UCLA Dental School, Patel decided to travel to Brazil to provide dental services to underserved communities. But he encountered difficulties in finding volunteer opportunities, having contacted more than 15 Brazilian organizations and receiving no response. He found that other dental and medical students had experienced similar problems. To address this problem, Patel created the Dental Volunteer and later HealthCare Volunteer to help connect students with volunteer opportunities.&lt;ref name="Kivowitz"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/young-humanitarians-win-prestige-49332.aspx|title=Winners of the UCLA Humanitarian Awards|accessdate=April 28, 2008|publisher=UCLA Newsroom|year=2008|author=Elizabeth Kivowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Dental school, Neilesh Patel said he spent many "pizza nights" – subsisting on pizza and pulling all-nighters teaching himself how to program and build a Web site, which became the backbone of HealthCare Volunteer. He said he was driven by the belief that all qualified applicants should have the opportunity to volunteer.

Founded by [[Neilesh Patel|Neilesh Patel DDS]], and Elliot Mendelsohn MD in November, 2005, HealthCare Volunteer has a large listing of health-related volunteering opportunities serving the non-profit sector.&lt;ref name="npbio" /&gt; Volunteers include [[physician]]s, [[dentist]]s, [[medical student]]s, and [[dental assistant]]s, who donate their time to provide services including free surgery and dental care.&lt;ref name="npbio" /&gt; The organization has direct patient care programs in over 10 countries including India, Ecuador, Kenya, Tanzania, Liberia, Cameroon and Paraguay. In 2007,  Patel was selected as a YouthActionNet Fellow in recognition of the organization's efforts, which was awarded at the Embassy of Finland in Washington DC.&lt;ref name="ww"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.nokia.com/PR/200708/1146865_5.html|title=International Youth Foundation and Nokia honor 20 global youth leaders as YouthActionNet(TM) Fellows|accessdate=November 12, 2007|publisher=[[Nokia]]|year=2007|author=[[Nokia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yan"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.youthactionnet.org/yan_awards/awardwinner.cfm|title=Winners of the YouthActionNet Awards, August 2007|accessdate=November 12, 2007|publisher=YouthActionNet|year=2007|author=YouthActionNet |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011040145/http://www.youthactionnet.org/yan_awards/awardwinner.cfm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, Patel was awarded the UCLA Charles E Young Humanitarian Award for his work in global health. Patel reportedly dropped out of the UCLA MBA Program in 2007 after starting classes his first quarter as the first ever student in the integrated DDS/MBA program in order to focus on HV's growth.

Patel and Mendelsohn have also established HealthCare Tourism International, the first non profit medical [[tourism]] [[accreditation]] service.&lt;ref name="hcfn"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/story.cms?id=7040|title=First nonprofit medical tourism accreditation service launched|accessdate=November 12, 2007|publisher=Health Care Finance News|year=2007|author=Molly Merrill |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071105041343/http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/story.cms?id=7040 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = November 5, 2007}} The organization has gained attention, and Patel was recently quoted in the New York Times on the subject of dental tourism.&lt;/ref&gt; Patel started his first non-profit StudentsHelp.org (www.studentshelp.org) at age 17, which helped provide computer services and technical support to needy people around the world.

In 2013, Patel received the Samuel S. Beard Award for Greatest Public Service by an Individual 35 Years or Under, an award given out annually by [[Jefferson Awards for Public Service|Jefferson Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/healthcare-volunteer-founder-neilesh-patel-named-national-jefferson-award-winner-in-washington-dc-212085991.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volunteer networking==
One of the unique features of the HealthCare Volunteer website is its ability to allow volunteers to create online profiles and connect with other volunteers. Once volunteers have signed up and created their profiles, they can form volunteering teams for service at home or abroad.

==Exercising a 'free volunteering' philosophy==
HealthCare Volunteer has sought to reduce the financial burdens for both volunteers and organizations. First, volunteers pay no money to search HealthCare Volunteer for volunteering opportunities nor must organizations pay any money to post their volunteering opportunities on HealthCare Volunteer. Secondly, HealthCare Volunteer strives to exclusively partner with organizations that do not charge their volunteers additional money beyond accommodation and other essential services in order to volunteer. HealthCare Volunteer believes that volunteers are already volunteering their time and effort and should not be required to pay additional fees above the basic costs (travel, accommodation, and basic services).&lt;ref name="Partner Policy"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthcarevolunteer.com/organizations/partnerpolicy.php?PHPSESSID=b61fd64e534e41faf8df1a66e7e15c0f|title=HealthCare Volunteer Partner Philosophy|accessdate=September 10, 2007|publisher=HealthCare Volunteer|year=2007|author=Ravi Raghavan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational awards==
In 2007, HealthCare Volunteer began awarding volunteers who helped advance the mission of HealthCare Volunteer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthcarevolunteer.com/news/12262007.php|title=HealthCare Volunteer 2007 Awards|accessdate=December 26, 2007|publisher=HealthCare Volunteer|year=2007|author=Manjusha Dutta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Marine Biology''' is a [[research institute]] of the [[National Academy of Science of Ukraine]], which located in [[Odessa]], [[Ukraine]]. The institute is organized on the base of the Odessa Branch of the Institute of Biology of the Southern Seas.

== History ==
[[File:Building, Lustdorf Beach 11.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The old building of the Odessa Biological Station in the village of [[Lustdorf]]]]
The institute was established in December 21, 1953 as the '''Odessa Biological Station''' of the [[Institute of hydrobiology of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]] by the resolution of the Council of Ministers of the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. When the Sevastopol Biological Station was reorganised in the [[Institute of Biology of the Southern Seas]] in 1963, the Biological Station in Odessa was also reorganised in the '''Odessa Branch of the Institute of Biology of the Southern Seas''' by the special resolution №&amp;nbsp;796 at June 11, 1963. During the long period (1953-1963), the head of the biological station, and then the head of the branch, was [[professor]] [[Konstantin Vinogradov]]. Later, from 1972 to 1989 Professor [[Yuvenali Zaitsev]] was the head of the branch. During 1989-1994 the branch was ruled by [[geographer]], Professor [[Oleksandr Bronfman]], but Yuvenali Zaitsev started to be the most famous researcher of the institute. Since 1994 professor [[Borys Aleksandrov]] is the head of the institute.

The Odessa branch of the Institute of Biology of the Southern Seas was reorganized into the Institute of Marine Biology by the resolution #161 of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, dated July 2, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Постанова №161 президії Національної Академії наук України, 2 липня 2014 р.&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution started to be valued from August 2, 2014.

== The scientific direction ==
The main scientific direction of the institute is the complex study of the different approaches of [[biology]] and [[ecology]] of marine [[ecosystem]]s. Among them:
* The ecology of [[water body]] subjects to the influence of large [[port]]-industrial complexes and communal agglomerations.
* The hydrobiological amelioration and restoration of damaged ecosystems.
* The mathematical modeling of aquatic ecosystems for the purpose of  obtaining unbiased diagnosis and prognosis of their state
* The creation of computer bases of ecological data on the north-western [[Black Sea]] shelf, coastal areas, [[lagoons]] and [[estuaries]] of the [[Danube]]-[[Dniester]] interfluve.
The institute elaborates the modern methods of the sampling and processing of the [[hydrobiology|hydrobiological]] samples, new methods of the analyzing of the scientific information. The institute provides the scientific expertise, 
improves the methods of protection and management of ecosystems and its sustainable development. The Institute provides training of scientific personnel by the post-graduate and post-doc studies on the [[hydrobiology|hydrobiological]] and [[zoology|zoological]] specialisations.

'''Intelsat 804''' was a [[communications satellite]] operated by [[Intelsat]]. Launched in 1997 it was operated in [[geostationary orbit]] at a longitude of 44 degrees east for around 8 years.

==Satellite==
The fourth of six [[Intelsat VIII]] satellites to be launched, Intelsat 804 was built by [[Lockheed Martin]]. It was a {{convert|3412|kg|lb|adj=on}} spacecraft. The satellite carried a 2x[[LEROS-1B]] [[apogee motor]] for propulsion and was equipped with 38 [[C band (IEEE)|C Band]] [[transponder]]s and 6 [[Ku band]] [[transponder]]s, powered by 2 solar cells more batteries.&lt;ref name="EA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/intlsat.htm|title=Intelsat|first=Mark|last=Wade|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed for a fourteen-year service life.&lt;ref name="gsp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/intelsat-8.htm|title=Intelsat-8 (801, 802, 803, 804) / NSS 803 → NSS 5|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch==
The launch of Intelsat 804 made use of a [[Ariane 4]] rocket flying from [[Guiana Space Centre]], [[Kourou]], [[French Guiana]]. The launch took place at 00:116 UTC on December22, 1997, with the spacecraft entering a [[geosynchronous transfer orbit]].&lt;ref name="launchlog"/&gt; The satellite subsequently fired its apogee motor to achieve [[geostationary orbit]].

==Failure==
On 14 January 2005 at 22:32 UTC, there was a failure of the power system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tbs-satellite.com/tse/online/sat_intelsat_804.html TSE-Intelsat 804]. Retrieved 2017-5-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Menina do alto da serra''' ("High ridge girl"), also known in [[Portugal]] just as '''Menina''' and for this reason sometimes entitled '''Menina (do alto da serra)''', was the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1971]], performed in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] by [[Tonicha]].

The song is a ballad, with Tonicha describing a simple country girl. She presents the girl as an ideal to which everyone should aspire in their lives.

The song was performed fifteenth on the night, following the [[Netherlands]]' [[Saskia &amp; Serge]] with "[[Tijd]]" and preceding [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]'s [[Kruno Slabinac]] with "[[Tvoj dječak je tužan]]". At the close of voting, it had received 83 points, placing 9th (at the time the best Portuguese result) in a field of 18.

It was succeeded as [[Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest|Portuguese representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972|1972 contest]] by [[Carlos Mendes (singer)|Carlos Mendes]] with "[[A festa da vida]]".

The '''Ministry of Local Development''' is the Egyptian government body responsible for local development.

The ministry was established by the decision of the [[President of Egypt]] with decree No. 325 of 1999. One of its objectives is to coordinate various efforts for the development of local communities and administration units in partnership with the [[governorates of Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mld.gov.eg/en/p/3/about-us/|title=ABOUT THE MINISTRY|work=mld.gov.eg|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initiatives==
The ministry's goals are to decentralize power and to provide employment for youth and women especially.&lt;ref name="MLD_Home"&gt;{{cite web |title=Home |url=http://mld.gov.eg/?lang=en |website=Ministry of Local Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their projects include decreasing illiteracy in Egypt, improving public services, generating more civic engagement, preparing local leaders, and in unison with other ministries, providing the land for the building of new housing units.&lt;ref name="MLD_Projects"&gt;{{cite web |title=Projects |url=http://mld.gov.eg/en/projects?page=2 |website=Ministry of Local Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the ministry requested that restrictions on [[Tuk Tuk]] licensing be lifted in order to ease congestion in cities.&lt;ref name="Hisham_2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hisham |first1=Shahd |title=Egypt's local development minister calls for lifting restrictions on tuk tuk licensing |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/310294/Egypt/Politics-/Egypts-local-development-minister-calls-for-liftin.aspx |work=Ahram Online |date=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Morė''' is one of the main attributes of the traditional Lithuanian folk festival ''[[Užgavėnės]]''. It is an artificial woman (''čiūčiala''), stuffed with various materials, who is ultimately burned in a [[bonfire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vaiškūnas|first1=Jonas|title=Ką iš tikrųjų įkūnija Užgavėnių Morė?|url=https://www.delfi.lt/grynas/gyvenimas/jvaiskunas-ka-is-tikruju-ikunija-uzgaveniu-more.d?id=55756613|website=DELFI.lt|accessdate=21 February 2012|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Norwegian Transport Workers' Union''' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]:''Norsk Transportarbeiderforbund'', NTF) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[trade union]] which was established on 2 April 1896. The union organizes workers in [[logistics]] and private goods and passenger transport. The main areas for the union are drivers plus workshop and maintenance personnel in the [[bus]] companies, warehouses and terminal workers, drivers in forwarding and wholesale industry, [[mailroom]] employees and delivering personnel in newspaper companies, [[taxi driver]]s, employees in the environmental industry (waste disposal and recycling), [[freight]] drivers (long and local transport of goods ) and [[stevedores]] workers in the [[port]]s. 

The union has over 20,000 members in 20 unions across Norway. 

The union's head office in Oslo consists of eight officers and nine employees. NTF joined the [[Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions]] (LO) in 1907 and is a member of the [[International Transport Workers' Federation]]. The unions' leader is Roger Hansen.

The band quickly rose to fame, especially after winning Coca-Cola Soundwave contest in 2008, receiving a chance to perform in [[Coke Live Music Festival]] along with [[The Prodigy]] and [[Timbaland]]. The same year they also closed one of the biggest baltic music festivals [[Be2gether]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sweetsalt Biografija|url=http://www.sweetsalt.lt/lt/biografija/|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tabubil lies in the heart of the Min Nation, an area with a distinct ethnic makeup that straddles the [[Indonesia]]n border, and extends towards the southern [[Sepik]] areas and throughout the northern [[Fly River]] system.&lt;ref name="Brown, 1978"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Paula|title=Highland Peoples of New Guinea|year=1978|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=9780521292498|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PwQ4AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=highland+people+of+papua+new+guinea&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early years of colonisation of [[New Guinea]] it was unknown how many people, if any, lived in this remote and seemingly impassable and inhospitable terrain.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Before the 1940s, outside contact with the [[Mountain Ok people|Min people]] was either brief, or merely vicarious.&lt;ref name=minemerge&gt;{{cite news|title=Regional history and ethnic identity in the hub of New Guinea: The emergence of the Min |author="Jorgensen, Dan"|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3654/is_199603/ai_n8738925/print }} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought the Min were pushed north hundreds or even thousands of years ago by war with the southern [[Gogodala people]]s, who were a strong warrior nation that currently reside on the plains of the [[Middle Fly District, Western Province|central Fly area]] of the Western Province.{{By whom|date=January 2010}}

=== Colonisation of Telefomin ===
{{Main article|Telefomin}}
It was not until 1943 that [[USAAF]] gliders landed deep in the [[Star Mountains]] to establish an airstrip station in what is now [[Telefomin]], about 25&amp;nbsp;km north-east of Tabubil. This is the first permanent colonial influence on the Min people, who at the time were [[Cannibal]]s involved in a deep tribal war. Soon after the arrival of the Americans, the [[Telefolmin tribe]] experienced a [[cessation of hostilities]] with its neighbours, the [[Falamin]] and the [[Tifalmin]] due to mutually agreeable conditions that emerged from the construction and introduction of western goods and services.  Conflict between social groups was also forcefully deterred by Australian colonial administrators.  After colonial pacification, trade flourished in the area.&lt;ref name=minemerge/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=== Mining town ===
[[Image:Tabubil-world wind.png|thumb|270px|NASA [[Landsat]] image of Tabubil with a North-West perspective and [[Ok Tedi Mine]] in the background.]]

Tabubil, originally a small camp surrounding an airstrip, was set up as a base of operations for drilling sites by the [[Kennecott Copper Corporation]]. In 1976, [[Australia]]n mining company [[BHP Billiton|BHP]] entered into negotiations with the Papua New Guinea government in an attempt to gain control of the camp and establish it as a gold mining town.&lt;ref name=OTMLHistory&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oktedi.com/aboutus/history.php | title = History of Development | publisher = Ok Tedi Mining Limited | year = 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071022020110/http://www.oktedi.com/aboutus/history.php | archivedate = 2007-10-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; BHP was successful in 1980, and in 1981, [[Ok Tedi Mining Limited]] was established to take control of operations, with a major BHP shareholding.&lt;ref name=OTMLHistory/&gt;

Today, the old Kennecott camp is still standing. {{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Known locally as the "A" houses, they are [[ATCO]] shipping crate styled houses. Later, the "B" and "C" houses were built by BHP for their workers. BHP has built the majority of the town, with structures placed by other companies and the national government making up only a small percentage of the total buildings. {{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

== Culture ==
Tabubil is host to a diverse range of cultures, due to its workforce historically being sourced from many parts of PNG, Australia, Asia, Europe and the Americas. Most expatriates are Australian, but there are also many Filipinos. A [[Canada|Canadian]] mining company, [[Inmet Mining|Inmet Mining Corporation]] owns an 18% stake in the mine,&lt;ref name=KeyStats/&gt; and of Tabubil. &amp;nbsp;A number of Canadians, particularly those from [[Port Hardy]] on [[Vancouver Island]], have also resided in Tabubil. During recent years, however, Ok Tedi Mining Limited has looked closer to home for human resources, with its long existent, but recently enforced ''preferred area'' human resourcing plan.

=== Events ===
The main cultural event of the year is Papua New Guinea's Independence Day. The event is proceeded by a festival known as the "Amamas Week" meaning joyful week, encompassing a week of traditional and contemporary dancing(arranged and performed by school students, local groups and groups from other provinces), music, traditional ceremonies. In the 90s, performers from other countries like Samoa, New Zealand, were also invited to showcase their traditional dances for that joyful week.  {{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

An election is extremely important to local residents, often inciting riots, tribal conflict, and other forms of [[civil disobedience]]. The provincial government has banned the sale of alcohol during an election to try and curb violence. {{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

[[Melbourne Cup]] day has been a well celebrated event since the foundation of the town. As many expatriate residents of the town are from Australia, Melbourne Cup celebrations have been a traditionally important connection to the culture left behind in Australia. {{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

=== Religion ===
The most popular religion in the town is Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 | first =Mary

 | title =Becoming Sinners: Christianity and Moral Torment in a Papua New Guinea Society

Tabubil is host to four major permanent churches, and many other church groups that meet in the large undercover areas beneath the "B" and "C" style houses.

The [[Mission Aviation Fellowship]] has a presence in [[Tabubil Airport]] and the [[YMCA]] and [[YWCA]] hold a strong influence over the town culture and commerce.

=== Media ===
Although many people in Tabubil own computers, Internet use is very rare. There is, however, a wide selection of cable TV stations available from Singapore, Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, PNG, and the USA. There is a local TV station called OTV. Several AM and FM radio stations are available in town.  Radio Fly on Shortwave 3915&amp;nbsp;kHz and 5960&amp;nbsp;kHz.

Mobile (Cellular) phone and data services are provided by Telikom PNG (CitiFon) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.telikompng.com.pg/index.php/citifon/network-coverage |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-01-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202123824/http://www.telikompng.com.pg/index.php/citifon/network-coverage |archive-date=2017-02-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Digicel.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telcoantennas.com.au/site/digicel-papua-new-guinea-coverage-map&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate ==
Tabubil has a [[tropical rainforest climate]]. The town is known unofficially as one of the wettest places on earth, with an average annual rainfall of 8 metres per annum, and a peak rainfall of 10 metres per annum.&lt;ref name=QuickFacts/&gt; The unique weather conditions have caused much adaptation in the local jungle flora and fauna, causing Tabubil to be particularly interesting to the scientific community.

Tabubil often has a transient population that aren't used to the large amounts of rain that fall there. Locals, however, operate quite happily in the rain, as it rains daily, and residents cannot afford to let it disrupt their lives.

=== Urban design ===
Most fixed houses in northern Tabubil are designed to suit the town and its unique conditions much better than their counterparts in the south, as the 'B' and 'C' class houses are newer. Most of these newer houses have a large dry undercover area under the house, and are raised on stilts. Many people think the houses are on stilts due to the possibility of flooding, but they mostly provide protection from the many [[earthquakes]] in the area.

The entire town is slightly sloped on an increment towards the south. This provides excellent water runoff, which is aided by the many '[[Flood control channel|floodway]]s' which are found around town, and allow large volumes of water to cross roads. Most residents, especially on the escarpment side of town, have large ravines in their backyards which can fill up to a depth of two metres during especially wet periods, and pose a safety hazard.

Because of the large rainfall, there are many indoor sporting facilities in town. Indoor facilities for sports such as squash, indoor cricket, gymnastics, basketball, and other sports are available.

=== The climate and nature ===
In a country where biodiversity is extreme, the area around Tabubil is regarded as being especially unique. There are untold numbers of different species of birds, fish, insects, spiders, and small animals.  &amp;nbsp;The area around Tabubil is known for moths that grow to the size of dinner plates, bird eating spiders and many other unique creatures. &amp;nbsp;New species are being discovered constantly.

The sheer abundance of life in the area is attributed to the high rainfall. In town, many plant species, such as [[menta|mint]], that grow elsewhere in the world can be found in large amounts. The plants in Tabubil are larger than usual, and grow much faster than they do elsewhere.

== Economy ==

=== Ok Tedi Mine ===
{{Main article|Ok Tedi Mine}}
[[Image:OkTediMine.jpg|thumb|right|275px|The Ok Tedi mine site]]

Tabubil is the base of operations for the Ok Tedi Copper Mine, the largest economic entity in the Western Province. &amp;nbsp;The mine accounts for over half of the entire province's economy&lt;ref name=AnnReview/&gt; and 25.7% of the country's entire export earnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;Consequently, Tabubil is the richest and most well served settlement in western Papua New Guinea.

The mine, which operates as [[Ok Tedi Mining Limited]] was formerly owned by a joint initiative between the PNG government, and [[Australia]]n mining giant, [[BHP Billiton|BHP]]. &amp;nbsp;In 2002 the mine was restructured,&lt;ref name=KeyStats&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oktedi.com/aboutus/keyStatistics.php | title = Key Statistics | publisher = Ok Tedi Mining Limited | year = 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060820172746/http://www.oktedi.com/aboutus/keyStatistics.php | archivedate = 2006-08-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[PNG Sustainable Development Program]]&lt;ref name=PNGDSP&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pngsdp.com | title =PNG Sustainable Development Program Website| publisher = PNGSDP | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; now owns the BHP share.&lt;ref name=KeyStats/&gt;

=== Town services ===
Tabubil is serviced by a hotel, a hospital, a police station and courthouse, fire station, two primary schools (one international), a community high school, two supermarkets, a bakery, chemist, two banks, and a hardware store. Various other local businesses create an unusually Westernised culture within this remote town.

Various clubs operate in the town, including the Golf Club, the Hash House Harriers, and the Gazebo club. For non drinking related recreation there is an indoor squash court, indoor cricket centre, tennis courts, a public pool, rugby fields, a gym, and many jungle tracks which may or may not be safe to walk along.

=== Commerce ===
The main commercial hub of town is in the Centre, to the northeast of the airport.  This commercial district is based around a town square plan, and was host to the first [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]s, [[EFTPOS]] machines and public telephones in western Papua New Guinea. The largest store in town, the Tabubil Superstore, is located in the Centre. There is also a smaller, newer supermarket in the north of town and several smaller convenience shops known as ''Lik-Lik Shops'' after the [[Tok Pisin]] word for ''small''.

=== Industry ===
Tabubil is powered by a hydro-electric station at Ok Menga, capable of producing 10 megawatts of electricity, and has a backup diesel power generating plant.

The main industrial hub is at the south end of the airport. This area was originally known locally as the 'Lay-Down' area, due to the fact that it was the storage location for much of the materials shipped in for the construction of the town. It is currently officially known as the ward of [[Laytown, Papua New Guinea|Laytown]].

A sawmill (now disused) is located at Sawmill Creek.

== Transportation ==
{{Main article|Transportation in Papua New Guinea}}

Tabubil itself is situated amongst dense jungle on a plateau, beside a steep escarpment leading down to the [[Ok Tedi River]] in the [[Star Mountains]] of [[Papua New Guinea]]. The township is very remote and is only accessible via air, or river barge followed by road.

=== Air travel ===
Tabubil has an [[Tabubil Airport|international airport]]&lt;ref name=AnnReview&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oktedi.com/reports/news/33/2002_Annual_Review_1.7mb.pdf | title = Annual Review | publisher = Ok Tedi Mining Limited | year = 2002 | format = PDF | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070703061845/http://www.oktedi.com/reports/news/33/2002_Annual_Review_1.7mb.pdf | archivedate = 2007-07-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[IATA]] code TBG) with a 1280-metre (4200&amp;nbsp;ft)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Most passenger traffic is handled by daily flights to [[Port Moresby]] or [[Mount Hagen]] and tri-weekly flights to [[Cairns]] in [[Australia]] by [[Asia Pacific Airlines (PNG)|Asia Pacific Airlines]] [[Bombardier Dash 8|Dash 8]]s. Prior to the introduction of Dash 8 services, a [[Beechcraft Super King Air|King Air Super 200]] was used for mine traffic.

[[Asia Pacific Airlines (PNG)|Asia Pacific Airlines]] is a local company with head offices in Tabubil, and a good safety record, additionally [[Airlines PNG]], [[Mission Aviation Fellowship]] and [[Air Niugini]] also fly to Tabubil Regularly. Tabubil was also regularly serviced by [[Talair]] before it was disbanded.

==== History ====
In the late 1970s, Tabubil was a small camp. Before construction of the town, Tabubil's first airstrip was in a different location, and a different angle to the airstrip that exists today.&lt;ref name=Higgins&gt;{{cite web

 |archivedate = 2004-08-19
 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air travel was instrumental in the development of the town, as there were no roads and the [[Kiunga-Tabubil Highway]], which was a major logistical problem, was not constructed yet.&lt;ref name=Higgins/&gt;

=== Road travel ===
There are some sealed main streets in Tabubil, and several unsealed minor roads. The central north-south road in the town, separating the 'B' and 'C' houses is called "Spine Road", and is closed to vehicular traffic by large boulders at the end of each local road, apart from a small section at the south that is used for access to a group of townhouses. This non-vehicular road creates a well used and safe walkway through the town. Market stalls are common on this road, and there are two "lik-lik" stores adjacent to the road, and the town's only public park and playground.

All major roads are sealed and contain numerous "floodways" which allow the large amounts of rain in the town to wash over the road without obstructing traffic.

The most common form of roadkill in town is snakes, which will often stretch across the road seeking heat from the bitumen.

==== Kiunga-Tabubil Highway ====
{{Main article|Kiunga-Tabubil Highway}}
The township is situated upon an unsealed highway. &amp;nbsp;One end of the highway terminates at [[Ok Tedi mine]], about 30&amp;nbsp;km by road to the northwest. &amp;nbsp;The other end of the highway terminates at the river port of [[Kiunga, Papua New Guinea|Kiunga]], the most northern navigable point of the [[Fly River]],&lt;ref name=QuickFacts/&gt; about 100&amp;nbsp;km to the south. Buses, private vehicles, and heavy trucking operations run along this route. This highway is used for transportation of supplies to the town and to the mine from barges on the [[Fly River]]. &amp;nbsp;The highway is heavily used by trucking operations heading to and from the port. [[Slurry]] of copper concentrate from the mine is sent to the river port along a 137&amp;nbsp;km&lt;ref name=QuickFacts/&gt; pipeline which runs parallel to this highway. The [[Kiunga-Tabubil Highway]] is one of the only all-weather roads in the province,&lt;ref name=QuickFacts/&gt; and most other roads in the district feed into this remote highway.

=== River Travel ===
{{Main article|Kiunga, Papua New Guinea}}
Except in cases of severe drought, most supplies to the mine are delivered by barge along the [[Fly River]], which can be accessed by a port in [[Kiunga, Papua New Guinea|Kiunga]] on the southern terminus of the Kiunga-Tabubil Highway. All the produce from the mine and all local exports are sent from this port. The Fly river has a water level which is often too low for shipping, and barges are often banked mid-passage. River barge followed by truck is the only way to supply the township apart from air cargo.

=== Travel by foot ===
It is not uncommon for residents to access other remote areas by foot. &amp;nbsp;Most locals can tell you how many days it would take to walk to most locations within the country. &amp;nbsp;Walking often is the only way for people to get to their local villages anyway, as many local airstrips are in disrepair.&lt;ref name=QuickFacts/&gt; &amp;nbsp;The maintenance of airstrips is a [[Local-Level Governments of Papua New Guinea|Local Level Government]] responsibility,&lt;ref name=QuickFacts/&gt; and many LLGs in the surrounding area are severely underfunded.

The '''Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership''' ('''TTIP''') is a proposed [[trade agreement]] between the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]] and Miss Dadge, with the aim of promoting trade and multilateral economic growth. According to [[Karel de Gucht]], European Commissioner for Trade between 2010 and 2014, the TTIP is the largest bilateral trade initiative ever negotiated, not only because it involves the two largest economies in the world but also "because of its potential global reach in setting an example for future partners and agreements".&lt;ref&gt;Karel de Gucht, ''Foreword'' in Jean-Frédéric Morin, Tereza Novotná, Frederik Ponjaert and Mario Telò, ''The Politics of Transatlantic Trade Negotiations, TTIP in a Globalized World'', Routledge, 2015, p.xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

Negotiations were halted by President Donald Trump,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/world/europe/donald-trump-us-eu-trade.html|title=Europe Averts a Trade War With Trump. But Can It Trust Him?|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who then initiated a trade conflict with the EU. Trump and the EU declared a truce of sorts in July 2018, resuming talks that appeared similar to TTIP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/us/politics/trump-trade-european-union.html|title=Trump's Trade Truce With Europe Has a Familiar Feel: It Mirrors Obama's Path|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reports on the ongoing negotiations and the contents of the negotiated TTIP proposals are [[classified information|classified]] from the public, and can be accessed only by authorised persons.&lt;ref name="Independent 14 August 2015"/&gt; Multiple [[News leak|leaks]] of proposed TTIP contents into the public caused controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Neslen.

[[theguardian.com]]. 1 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Commission]] says that the TTIP would boost the EU's economy by €120&amp;nbsp;billion, the US economy by €90&amp;nbsp;billion and the rest of the world by €100&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="EU-ttip"/&gt; According to Anu Bradford, law professor at [[Columbia Law School]], and Thomas J. Bollyky of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], TTIP aims to "liberalise one-third of global trade" and could create millions of new jobs.&lt;ref name="Bollyky Foreign Affairs"/&gt; A ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' article by [[Dean Baker]] of the US thinktank [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Tina|title=The Perils of Petrocracy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/magazine/04oil-t.html?pagewanted=7|accessdate=5 October 2014|work=[[New York Times]]|date=4 November 2007|quote= … Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a left-leaning Washington policy group.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sussman|first1=Anna Louie|title=Are Women the New Face of Organized Labor?|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/09/07/are-women-the-new-face-of-organized-labor/|accessdate=20 September 2015|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fox|first1=Maggie|title=Obamacare won't slash workers' hours, report finds|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/obamacare-wont-slash-workers-hours-report-finds-f6C10732487|accessdate=31 October 2014|agency=NBC News|date=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the economic benefits per household would be relatively small.&lt;ref name="guardian July 15, 2013"/&gt; According to a [[European Parliament]] report, impacts on labour conditions range from job gains to job losses, depending on economic model and assumptions used for predictions.&lt;ref name="EP Kraatz"&gt;Susanne Kraatz.

The agreement has been criticized and opposed by some [[Trade union|unions]], charities, [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and environmentalists, particularly in Europe.&lt;ref name="guardian August 3, 2015"&gt;Stuart Jeffries. [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/03/ttip-what-why-angry-transatlantic-trade-investment-partnership-guide What is TTIP and why should we be angry about it?]. [[theguardian.com]]. Published on 3 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Daily Beast"/&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'' describes common criticisms of TTIP as "reducing the regulatory barriers to trade for [[big business]], things like [[food safety]] law, [[Environmental law|environmental legislation]], [[Bank regulation|banking regulations]] and the sovereign powers of individual nations",&lt;ref name="The Independent October 6, 2015"/&gt; or more critically as an "assault on European and US societies by transnational corporations".&lt;ref name="The Independent October 6, 2015"/&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted the criticism of TTIP's "undemocratic nature of the closed-door talks", "influence of powerful lobbyists", TTIP's potential ability to "undermine the democratic authority of local government",&lt;ref name="guardian August 5, 2015"&gt;Tim Smedley.

[[theguardian.com]]. 5 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and described it as "the most controversial trade deal the EU has ever negotiated".&lt;ref name="theguardian.com 27 August 2016"/&gt; German economist [[Max Otte]] argued that by putting European workers into direct competition with Americans (and in effect because of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] with Mexicans), TTIP would negatively impact the [[European social model]]s.&lt;ref name="heute April 8, 2016"/&gt; An EU [[direct democracy]] mechanism, the [[European Citizens' Initiative]], which enables EU citizens to call directly on the [[European Commission]] to propose a legal act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/welcome|title=Homepage – European Citizens' Initiative – European Commission|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; acquired over 3.2&amp;nbsp;million signatures against TTIP and [[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement|CETA]] within a year.&lt;ref name="guard 3 Aug 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stop TTIP"/&gt;

==Background==
Economic barriers between the EU and the United States are relatively low, not only due to long-standing membership in the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) but also recent agreements such as the [[EU–US Open Skies Agreement]] and work by the [[Transatlantic Economic Council]]. The [[European Commission]] claims that passage of a trans-Atlantic trade pact could boost overall trade between the respective blocs by as much as 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21565973-after-barack-obamas-re-election-it-time-push-transatlantic-free-trade-hope-and-no|accessdate=18 March 2013|title=Hope and no change, After Barack Obama's re-election, it is time to push for transatlantic free trade|publisher=Economist.com|date=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic gains from a Trade Treaty were predicted in the joint report issued by the [[White House]] and the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=European Commission|accessdate=18 March 2013|url=http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/february/tradoc_150519.pdf|title=Final Report High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some form of [[Transatlantic Free Trade Area]] had been proposed in the 1990s and later in 2006 by [[Chancellor of Germany (1949–)|German Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] in reaction to the collapse of the [[Doha Development Round|Doha]] world trade talks. However, [[protectionism]] on both sides may be a barrier to any future agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,440335,00.html |title=Trans-Atlantic Free Trade?: Merkel for EU Agreement with US – SPIEGEL ONLINE |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=2 October 2006 |accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecipe.org/blog/a-transatlantic-free-trade-area|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116094133/http://www.ecipe.org/blog/a-transatlantic-free-trade-area|title=A Transatlantic Free Trade Area?|archivedate=16 January 2010|work=ecipe.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first initiated in 1990, when, shortly after the end of the [[Cold War]], with the world no longer divided into two blocs, the [[European Community]] (12 countries) and the US signed a "Transatlantic Declaration". This called for the continued existence of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]], as well as for yearly summits, biannual meetings between ministers of State, and more frequent encounters between political figures and senior officials.

Subsequent initiatives taken by the European deciders and the US government included: in 1995, the creation of a pressure group of business people, the [[Transatlantic Business Dialogue]] (TABD) by public authorities on both sides of the Atlantic; in 1998, the creation of an advisory committee, the Transatlantic Economic Partnership; in 2007, the creation of the [[Transatlantic Economic Council]], in which representatives from firms operating on both sides of the Atlantic meet to advise the European Commission and the US government – and finally, in 2011, the creation of a group of high-level experts whose conclusions, submitted on 11 February 2013, recommended the launching of negotiations for a wide-ranging free-trade agreement. On 12 February 2013, President [[Barack Obama]] called in his annual [[State of the Union]] address for such an agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/business/global/obama-pledges-trade-pact-talks-with-eu.html|title=A Running Start for a U.S.-Europe Trade Pact|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2014-02-21|first1=James|last1=Kanter|first2=Jack|last2=Ewing|date=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, [[EU Commission]] [[European Commission President|President]] [[Jose Manuel Barroso]] announced that talks would take place to negotiate the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrew Walker |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21439945 |title=BBC News – EU and US free-trade talks launched |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=13 February 2013 |accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blenkinsop |first=Philip |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/13/us-eu-us-trade-idUSBRE91C0OC20130213 |title=EU, U.S. to start free trade talks |publisher=Reuters |date= 13 February 2013|accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States and European Union together represent 60% of global GDP, 33% of world trade in goods and 42% of world trade in services. There are a number of trade conflicts between the two powers, but both depend on the other's economic market and disputes only affect 2% of total trade. A free trade area between the two would represent potentially the largest regional free-trade agreement in history, covering 46% of [[world GDP]].&lt;ref name="imfgdp-world-eu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2013/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=33&amp;pr.y=11&amp;sy=2012&amp;ey=2012&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=001%2C998&amp;s=NGDPD&amp;grp=1&amp;a=1 |title=Nominal 2012 GDP for the world and the European Union (EU). |accessdate=2013-10-08 |work=World Economic Outlook Database | date=October 2013 |publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/creating-opportunities/bilateral-relations/countries/united-states/ |title=European Commission |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States investment in the European Union is three times greater than US investment in the entire continent of Asia and EU investment in the United States is eight times that of European Union investment in India and China combined. Intra-company transfers are estimated to constitute a third of all transatlantic trade. The United States and European Union are the largest trading partners of most other countries in the world and account for a third of world trade flows. Given the already low tariff barriers (under 3%), to make the deal a success the aim is to remove [[Non-tariff barriers to trade|non-tariff barriers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/united-states/ |title=United States – Trade – European Commission |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed contents==
Documents released by the European Commission in July 2014 group the topics under discussion into three broad areas: Market access; Specific regulation; and broader rules and principles and modes of co-operation.&lt;ref name="eu state of play"&gt;[http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/html/152666.htm State of Play of TTIP negotiations ahead of the 6th round of negotiations], European Commission DG Trade, 11 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="negotiators"&gt;[http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/html/151668.htm List of lead negotiators for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership], European Commission DG Trade&lt;p&gt;[http://www.ustr.gov/sites/default/files/lead%20negotiators%20list%20TTIP.pdf List of lead negotiators for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership], Office of the United States Trade Representative&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU negotiating mandate as of June 2013 gave a fuller view of what the [[Council of the European Union]] ([[Foreign Affairs Council|Foreign Affairs]]) has told its negotiators to try to achieve for each section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eu-secretdeals.info/upload/TTIP-mandate_M-Schaake_website.pdf|title=Secret Global Affairs – Search Enabled Priority|website=eu-secretdeals.info|accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; No corresponding US text is available, but the American side has released a public statement setting out its objectives and the potential benefits it foresees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/press-releases/2014/March/US-Objectives-US-Benefits-In-the-TTIP-a-Detailed-View U.S. Objectives, U.S. Benefits In the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership: A Detailed View] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719050519/http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/press-releases/2014/March/US-Objectives-US-Benefits-In-the-TTIP-a-Detailed-View |date=19 July 2014 }}, Office of the [[United States Trade Representative]], March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The secret contents of the first concrete American proposal on tariff reduction, and an EU counterproposal, which was leaked to [[Correctiv]] in February 2016, suggest 87.5% to 97% of all tariffs would be cut to zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = TTIP: EU offered 97% cut on US tariffs, secret papers show|url = https://euobserver.com/economic/132376|website = EUobserver|access-date = 23 February 2016|date = 22 February 2016|last = von Daniels|first = Justus|last2 = Orosz|first2 = Marta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Market access ===
{{see also|Non-tariff barriers to trade}}
TTIP includes chapters on market access for goods and services that aim to remove "custom duties on goods and restrictions on services, gaining better access to public markets, and making it easier to invest".&lt;ref name="TTIP explained"&gt;[http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/html/152462.htm The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) explained], European Commission DG Trade, 8 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The goods part includes rules on [[market access]] for goods, agriculture and processed agricultural products, and [[rules of origin]].&lt;ref name="eu state of play" /&gt;&lt;ref name="negotiators" /&gt;

====Services and leaked text====
{{See also|Public services|Bank regulation|Regulatory taking|Investor-state dispute settlement}}

For "Trade in Services, Investment and E-commerce", a draft text dated 7 July 2013 was leaked by the German newspaper, ''[[Die Zeit]]'' in March 2014. The leaked text contains seven chapters. In Chapter 1, Article 1 states the overall objective of "a better climate for the development of trade and investment", particularly the "[[liberalisation]] of investment and cooperation on e-commerce".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keionline.org/sites/default/files/eu-kommission-position-in-den.pdf|format=PDF|title=TTIP Draft (02/07/2013) article 1|publisher=Keionline.org|accessdate=2015-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter II, Article 3 to Article 18 contains general principles for investment. Article 14 contains proposed rules that forbid governments to "directly or indirectly [[nationalise]], [[expropriate]]" unless it is for a public purpose, under due process of law, on a non-discriminatory basis, with compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keionline.org/sites/default/files/eu-kommission-position-in-den.pdf|format=PDF |title=TTIP Draft (02/07/2013) article 14(1)|publisher=Keionline.org|accessdate=2015-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 14(2) defines the necessary compensation as being "fair market value of the investment at the time immediately before the expropriation or the impending expropriation became public knowledge plus [[compound interest|interest at a commercial rate]] established on a market basis".

Chapter III, Articles 19 to 23 contains rules on cross border supply of services.

Chapter IV, Articles 24 to 28 would allow free movement of business managers, and other employees of a corporation, for temporary work purposes among all countries party to the agreement.&lt;ref name="TTIP Draft, articles 24-28"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keionline.org/sites/default/files/eu-kommission-position-in-den.pdf |format=PDF|title=TTIP Draft, articles 24–28|publisher=Keionline.org|accessdate=2015-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 1(2) makes it clear, however, that no more general free movement of workers and citizens is allowed.

Chapter V contains eight sections with particular rules for different economic sectors. Section I, articles 29 to 31, set out principles that states must follow in licensing private corporations, and state that requirements that are not proportionate to a reviewable public policy objective are contrary to the treaty. Section II contains general provisions. Section III covers computer services. Section IV, articles 35 to 39, cover liberalisation of [[postal service]]s.&lt;ref name="TTIP Draft, articles 35-39"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keionline.org/sites/default/files/eu-kommission-position-in-den.pdf|format=PDF|title=TTIP Draft, articles 35–39|publisher=Keionline.org|accessdate=2015-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section V, articles 40 to 50, apply to electronic communications networks and services (including telecommunications) and mandate competitive markets, absence of cross-subsidies, subject to defined exceptions including in article 46 a right (but not a requirement) for countries to provide [[universal service]].

Section VI of chapter V covers Financial Services, in articles 51 to 59. It limits the laws that governments can pass to regulate or publicly run insurance and banking. Any regulations that do not fall within the Treaty's terms and objectives would be unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keionline.org/sites/default/files/eu-kommission-position-in-den.pdf|format=PDF|title=TTIP Draft (02/07/2013) articles 51–59|publisher=Keionline.org|accessdate=2015-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legitimate reasons for regulation include, in article 52, "the protection of investors, depositors, policy-holders or persons to whom a [[fiduciary duty]] is owed by a financial service supplier; (b) ensuring the integrity and stability of a Party's financial system". However article 52(2) states "measures shall not be more burdensome than necessary to achieve their aim",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keionline.org/sites/default/files/eu-kommission-position-in-den.pdf|format=PDF|title=TTIP Draft (02/07/2013) art 52(2)|publisher=Keionline.org|accessdate=2015-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Treaty does not include any further reasons to allow regulation. Section VII covers international maritime transport and section VIII covers air transport.

The Annex on "[[Investor-state dispute settlement|Investors-state dispute settlement]]" proposed to allow corporations to bring actions against governments for breach of its rights.&lt;ref name="keionline.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keionline.org/sites/default/files/eu-kommission-position-in-den.pdf|format=PDF|title=TTIP Draft, "Negotiations on Investor-State Dispute Settlement"|publisher=Keionline.org|accessdate=2015-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission launched a public consultation after the draft text was leaked, which led to a number of changes. However, an updated proposed text had yet to be made publicly available.{{when|date=July 2015}} In September 2015, the Commission proposed an "Investment Court System" to replace the ISDS clauses, with the scope for investor challenge much reduced and with "highly skilled judges" rather than arbitrators used to determine cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Commission proposes new Investment Court System for TTIP and other EU trade and investment negotiations | url = http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5651_en.htm | work = The European Commission| date = 16 September 2015 | accessdate = 25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry-specific regulation===
"Improved regulatory coherence and cooperation by dismantling unnecessary regulatory barriers such as bureaucratic duplication of effort".&lt;ref name="TTIP explained" /&gt;

==Negotiations==

===Procedure===
The TTIP Agreement texts are being developed by 24 joint EU-US working groups, each considering a separate aspect of the agreement.  Development typically progresses through a number of phases.  Broad ''position paper''s are first exchanged, introducing each side's aims and ambitions for each aspect.  These are followed by ''textual proposals'' from each side, accompanied (in areas such as tariffs, and market access) by each side's "initial offer." These negotiations and draft documents can evolve (change) through the various stages of their development. When both sides are ready, a ''consolidated text'' is prepared, with remaining differences for discussion expressed in square brackets. These texts are then provisionally closed topic by topic as a working consensus is reached.  However the agreement is negotiated as a whole, so no topic's text is finalised until full consensus is reached.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1126 Commission publishes state of play of TTIP negotiations ahead of 6th round of talks], European Commission DG Trade, 11 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negotiation rounds===
Negotiations are held in week-long cycles alternating between Brussels and the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/documents-and-events/index_en.htm#negotiation-rounds |title=Documents and events – Negotiation rounds |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= [[European Commission|EU Commission]] |accessdate= 4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negotiators were hoping to conclude their work by the end of 2016.&lt;ref name="trade.ec.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2016/april/tradoc_154477.pdf |title=The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) State of Play |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confidentiality measures===
Only a few people can access the documents known as "consolidated texts", the drafts containing the most recent results of the negotiations. On the European side, authorised readers include the European Commission negotiators (most of them from the [[Directorate-General for Trade (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Trade]]),{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s and European Union members' [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s.&lt;ref name=Guardian160218&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/18/mps-can-view-ttip-files-but-take-only-pencil-and-paper-with-them MPs can view TTIP files – but take only pencil and paper with them] {{snd}} [[The Guardian]], 18 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the insistence of the US, the documents are not transmitted any more as electronic or even printed documents.&lt;ref name="Independent 14 August 2015" /&gt;  
They are only available in secure rooms at the European Commission HQ in Brussels, in a number of US embassies,&lt;ref name="Independent 14 August 2015" /&gt; and at the offices of member states' trade ministries.&lt;ref name=Guardian160218 /&gt; In all these secured rooms phones or other types of scanning device are forbidden.&lt;ref name="Independent 14 August 2015" /&gt; Blank sheets of paper, marked with the reader's names, are provided on which visitors can jot down their notes.&lt;ref name=Guardian160218 /&gt; 
On the US side, the procedure is similar: only Senators and [[Office of the United States Trade Representative|USTR]] negotiators may access the documents and must comply with similar conditions.&lt;ref name="Independent 14 August 2015"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ttip-controversy-secret-trade-deal-can-only-be-read-secure-in-reading-room-in-brussels-10456206.html |title=TTIP controversy: Secret trade deal can only be read in secure 'reading room' in Brussels |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= [[The Independent]] |accessdate= 23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US side has insisted on the same security arrangements for the drafts of the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] proposal.&lt;ref name="Independent 14 August 2015" /&gt;

===Hurdles===
The negotiations were planned to be finalized by the end of 2014, but according to economist [[Hosuk Lee-Makiyama]], at least another four or five years of negotiations remained at the end of that year.&lt;ref name="Reuters Jun 16, 2015"&gt;Philip Blenkinsop. [http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-eu-usa-trade-idUKKBN0OW0UW20150616 EU-U.S. trade deal seems distant dream after early optimism]. [[Reuters]]. 16 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014 the Bulgarian government announced that it will not ratify the agreement unless the United States lifted visa requirements for Bulgarian citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinite.com/articles/165030/Bulgaria+Will+Not+Sign+TTIP+Unless+US+Lifts+Visa+Requirements+-+Minister|title=Bulgaria Will Not Sign TTIP Unless US Lifts Visa Requirements – Minister|work=novinite.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German Vice Chancellor and Economy Minister [[Sigmar Gabriel]] said that free trade talks between the European Union and the United States have failed, citing a lack of progress on any of the major sections of the long-running negotiations. "In my opinion the negotiations with the United States have de facto failed, even though nobody is really admitting it" the German broadcaster [[Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen]] quoted the minister, according to a written transcript of an interview aired on 28 August 2016. "[They] have failed because we Europeans did not want to subject ourselves to American demands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/611ff828b5ed44d5ad56ab46e0781e52/german-economy-minister-says-eu-us-trade-talks-have-failed

==Ratification==
The twenty-eight European Union-member governments will have to approve of the partnership, via unanimous voting under TFEU Articles 207 and 218, on the negotiated agreement in the [[Council of the European Union]], at which point the [[European Parliament]] will also be asked for its endorsement. The European Parliament is empowered to approve or reject the agreement. In case the [[Council of the European Union]], following a proposal from the [[European Commission]], designates TTIP to be a "mixed agreement", approval from all Parliaments of the EU Member States in accordance with individual constitutional procedures is necessary before the agreement can enter into force. In the United States, both houses of the [[United States Congress|Congress]] will have to pass the agreement for it to be ratified.&lt;ref&gt;Ian F. Fergusson, [https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33743.pdf Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) and the Role of Congress in Trade Policy, Congress Research Service ](15 June 2015), p. 9, n.15 ("Under TPA, reciprocal FTAs and multilateral trade agreements that go beyond tariff reductions are treated as congressional-executive agreements, which require the approval of both houses of Congress. Such approval expresses Congress' consent to bind the United States to the commitments of the agreement under international law. This type of agreement is distinguished from both an [[executive agreement]], requiring only presidential action, and a [[treaty]], requiring a two-thirds vote of the Senate. Because reciprocal trade agreements typically result in tariff rate (revenue) changes, the House of Representatives is necessarily involved.").&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed benefits==
TTIP aims for a formal agreement that would "liberalize one-third of global trade" and, proponents argue, will create millions of new paid jobs.&lt;ref name="Bollyky Foreign Affairs"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bollyky|first=Thomas J. and Anu Bradford|title=Getting to Yes on Transatlantic Trade|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=10 July 2013|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/139569/thomas-j-bollyky-and-anu-bradford/getting-to-yes-on-transatlantic-trade|accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "With tariffs between the United States and the European Union already low, the London-based [[Centre for Economic Policy Research]] estimates that 80 percent of the potential economic gains from the TTIP agreement depend on reducing the conflicts of duplication between EU and US rules on those and other regulatory issues, ranging from food safety to automobile parts."&lt;ref name="Bollyky Foreign Affairs" /&gt; A successful strategy (according to Thomas Bollyky at the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] and Anu Bradford of [[Columbia Law School]]) will focus on business sectors for which transatlantic trade laws and local regulations can often overlap, e.g., pharmaceutical, agricultural, and financial trading.&lt;ref name="Bollyky Foreign Affairs" /&gt; This will ensure that the United States and Europe remain "standard makers, rather than standard takers", in the global economy, subsequently ensuring that producers worldwide continue to gravitate toward joint US-EU standards.&lt;ref name="Bollyky Foreign Affairs" /&gt;

In March 2013, an economic assessment by the European [[Centre for Economic Policy Research]] estimates that such a comprehensive agreement would result in GDP growth of 68–119&amp;nbsp;billion euros for the European Union by 2027 and GDP growth of 50–95&amp;nbsp;billion euros (about 53.5–101&amp;nbsp;billion US dollars) in the United States in the same time frame. The 2013 report also estimates that a limited agreement focused only on tariffs would yield EU GDP growth of 24&amp;nbsp;billion euros by 2027 and growth of 9&amp;nbsp;billion euros in the United States. If shared equally among the affected people, the most optimistic GDP growth estimates would translate into "additional annual disposable income for a family of four" of "545 euros in the EU" and "655 euros in the US", respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/march/tradoc_150737.pdf|title= Reducing Transatlantic Barriers to Trade and Investment: An Economic Assessment|publisher=Trade.ec.europa.eu|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' article, the CEO of [[Siemens]] AG (with its workforce located 70% in Europe and 30% in the United States) claimed that the TTIP would strengthen United States and EU global competitiveness by reducing trade barriers, by improving intellectual property protections, and by establishing new international "rules of the road".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kaeser |first=Joe |title=Why a US-European trade deal is a win-win |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303973704579350783279285204?KEYWORDS=siemens |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Commission]] says that the TTIP would boost the EU's economy by €120&amp;nbsp;billion, the US economy by €90&amp;nbsp;billion and the rest of the world by €100&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="EU-ttip"/&gt; Talks began in July 2013 and reached the third round of negotiations by the end of that year.&lt;ref name="EU-ttip"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/ |title=Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) – Trade – European Commission |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American economist [[Dean Baker]] of the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]] observed that with conventional trade barriers between the US and the EU already low, the deal would focus on non-conventional barriers, such as overriding national regulations on [[fracking]], [[GMOs]], and finance, but also tightening laws on copyright. He goes on to assert that, with less ambitious projections, the economic benefits per household are unimpressive: "If we apply the projected income gain of 0.21% to the projected median personal income in 2027, it comes to a bit more than $50 a year. That's a little less than 15 cents a day. Don't spend it all in one place".&lt;ref name="guardian July 15, 2013"&gt;The Guardian (15 July 2013). [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/15/us-trade-deal-with-europe-hype The US-EU trade deal: Don't buy the hype] Retrieved 24 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 paper by [[KU Leuven]] economists estimated that a "deep" free-trade agreement, such as TTIP, between the United States and the European Union would increase EU GDP by 1.3% and US GDP by 0.7%.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/free-trade-between-eu-and-us-match-made-heaven|title=Free trade between the EU and US: A match made in heaven|last=Vandenbussche|first=Hylke|last2=Connell|first2=William|date=2018-08-23|website=VoxEU.org|access-date=2018-08-24|last3=Simons|first3=Wouter}}&lt;/ref&gt; These gains would primarily be the result of reductions in [[Non-tariff barriers to trade|non-tarriff barriers to trade]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Secrecy of content and negotiations ===
The content of the drafts of agreement, as well as the reports on negotiation rounds, are [[classified information|classified]] from the public, an arrangement that ''[[The Independent]]'' criticised as "secretive and undemocratic".&lt;ref name="The Independent October 6, 2015"/&gt; As noted [[#Confidentiality measures|above]], elected representatives may only view the texts in a secure "reading room" in Brussels, to avoid any further leaks of information about TTIP negotiations into the public domain.

To answer the criticism, the European Commission has made negotiation documents public, including all EU proposals in the regulatory and rules components of the agreement.&lt;ref name="trade.ec.europa.eu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/section/trade-society/news/ttip-papers-published-as-eu-ombudsman-demands-more-transparency/|title=TTIP papers published as EU Ombudsman demands more transparency|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1230|title=EU negotiating texts in TTIP – Trade – European Commission|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trade Commissioner has described the negotiations as "the most transparent trade talks ever conducted by the EU".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/malmstrom/blog/ttip-state-play_en|title=TTIP – the State of Play – European Commission – European Commission|first=Joakim|last=LARSSON|date=27 April 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible negative impacts ===
==== Politics, economy and society====
''The Guardian'' described TTIP as "the most controversial trade deal the EU has ever negotiated".&lt;ref name="theguardian.com 27 August 2016"/&gt; TTIP negotiations are criticized and opposed by some [[Trade union|unions]], charities, [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and environmentalists, particularly in Europe.&lt;ref name="guardian August 3, 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Daily Beast"&gt;{{cite web|author=Leo Cendrowicz |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/04/22/europeans-fight-u-s-trade-deal-with-fear-of-mchospitals-fracking-under-eiffel-tower.html |title=Europeans Fight U.S. Trade Deal With Fear of McHospitals, Fracking Under Eiffel Tower |publisher=The Daily Beast |date= |accessdate=2015-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'' summarizes the negative impact of TTIP as "reducing the regulatory barriers to trade for big business, things like food safety law, environmental legislation, banking regulations and the sovereign powers of individual nations",&lt;ref name="The Independent October 6, 2015"&gt;Lee Williams [https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/what-is-ttip-and-six-reasons-why-the-answer-should-scare-you-9779688.html What is TTIP? And six reasons why the answer should scare you]. ''[[The Independent]]''. 6 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; or more critically as an "assault on European and US societies by transnational corporations".&lt;ref name="The Independent October 6, 2015"/&gt; German economist [[Max Otte]] stated that the proposed (ISDS) [[Investor-state dispute settlement#Tribunals|court of arbitration and protection of foreign investment]] would mean a "complete dis-empowerment of politics"&lt;ref name="heute April 8, 2016"&gt;[https://www.3sat.de/page/?source=/makro/magazin/doks/186138/index.html TTIP: "Völlige Entmachtung der Politik"]. [[3sat]]. Published on 8 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and that, regarding labour economics, free trade agreements typically enforce lower standards and that TTIP would put European workers into direct competition with Americans (and in effect because of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] with Mexicans), which would impact European social models.&lt;ref name="heute April 8, 2016"/&gt; Otte also concluded: "We really don't want the [[social system]] of these countries [United States and Mexico] here [in Europe]."&lt;ref name="heute April 8, 2016"/&gt;

An October 2014 study by Jeronim Capaldo of the [[Global Development and Environment Institute]] at [[Tufts University]] indicates that there will be losses in terms of net exports, net losses in terms of GDP, loss of labour income, job losses, reduction of the labour share, loss of government revenue and higher financial instability among European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Capaldo|first1=Jeronim|title=The Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership: European Disintegration, Unemployment and Instability|url=http://ase.tufts.edu/gdae/policy_research/TTIP_simulations.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Labour standards, workers' rights and job security ====
Anti-poverty group [[Global Justice Now]] asserts that TTIP would undermine job security as well as current minimum labour standards agreed in the EU.&lt;ref name="guardian October 18, 2015"/&gt; [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] politician [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]], [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]], has described TTIP as resulting in a huge transfer of powers to Brussels and [[corporatocracy|corporate interests]] that will bring about a form of "modern-day [[serfdom]]".&lt;ref name="guardian October 18, 2015"/&gt; According to a [[European Parliament]] report, impacts on labour conditions range from job gains to job losses, depending on economic model and assumptions used for predictions.&lt;ref name="EP Kraatz"/&gt;

In spite of a study by the Munich-based [[Ifo Institute for Economic Research]] (on behalf of the German Federal Ministry of Economics) claiming that up to 400,000 jobs could be created in the EU by TTIP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Topical Terms in Economics: Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement|url=https://www.cesifo-group.de/ifoHome/facts/Aktuelles-Stichwort/Topical-Terms-Archive/Transatlantic-Free-Trade-Agreement.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stefan Körzell, national board member of the [[Confederation of German Trade Unions]] (DGB) has said "Whether TTIP can create jobs, and 'how many' and 'where' is unclear. Previous studies, ranging from those conducted by the European Commission across to the expertise of the Ifo Institute, fluctuate between optimism and very low expectations... Consideration of the negative consequences trade agreements can have, if environmental or labour standards are ignored, is often omitted. As of August 2015, the US had ratified two (prohibitions of child labour and slavery) of the eight [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] [[Social clause|core labour standards]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Viavision: The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership|url=http://www.viavision.org.uk/ftp/1887.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Democracy and national sovereignty, foreign investor protection ====
[[Investor-state dispute settlement]] (ISDS) is an instrument that allows an investor to bring a case directly against the country hosting its investment, without the intervention of the government of the investor's country of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=European Commission |date=3 October 2013|url=http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/october/tradoc_151791.pdf |title=Factsheet on Investor-State Dispute Settlement|accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the late 1980s, certain trade treaties have included provisions for ISDS that allow foreign investors who claim to have been disadvantaged by actions of a signatory state, to sue that state for damages in a [[Arbitral tribunal|tribunal of arbitration]]. More recently such claims have increased in number and value,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/webdiaepcb2013d3_en.pdf|format=PDF|title=Recent Developments in Investor-State Disputes|publisher=Unctad.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some states have become increasingly resistant to such clauses.&lt;ref&gt;Economist (11 October 2014) [https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21623756-governments-are-souring-treaties-protect-foreign-investors-arbitration The arbitration game: Governments are souring on treaties to protect foreign investors] Retrieved 24 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of TTIP say that "ISDS provisions undermine the power of national governments to act in the interests of their citizens",&lt;ref name="guardian August 3, 2015"/&gt; that "TTIP could even undermine the democratic authority of local government",&lt;ref name="guardian August 5, 2015"/&gt; and that it threatens democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Robinson. [https://www.bbc.com/news/business-32116587 Is democracy threatened if companies can sue countries?]. [[BBC News]]. 31 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; France and Germany have said that they want access to investor-state dispute settlement removed from the TTIP treaty.&lt;ref name="guardian June 10, 2015"&gt;Claire Provost and Matt Kennard. [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/10/obscure-legal-system-lets-corportations-sue-states-ttip-icsid The obscure legal system that lets corporations sue countries]. [[theguardian.com]]. 10 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, a coalition of over 200 environmentalists, labor unions and consumer advocacy organizations on both sides of the Atlantic sent a letter to the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative|USTR]] and European Commission demanding the investor-state dispute settlement be dropped from the trade talks, claiming that ISDS was "a one-way street by which corporations can challenge government policies, but neither governments nor individuals are granted any comparable rights to hold corporations accountable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stangler |first=Cole |url=http://inthesetimes.com/article/16044/ttip_the_next_corporate_friendly_trade_deal/ |title=The Next Corporate-Friendly Trade Pact |publisher=In These Times |date=30 December 2013 |accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://action.sierraclub.org/site/DocServer/TTIP_Investment_Letter_Final.pdf?docID=14701 |title=Letter |publisher=Action.sierraclub.org |accessdate=2014-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224075427/http://action.sierraclub.org/site/DocServer/TTIP_Investment_Letter_Final.pdf?docID=14701 |archivedate=24 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some point out the "potential for abuse" that may be inherent in the trade agreement due to its clauses relating to investor protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/14/ttip-deal-british-sovereignty-cameron-ukip-treaty|title=The TTIP deal hands British sovereignty to multinationals|last=Jones|first=Owen|date=14 September 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian Media|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/criticism-grows-over-investor-protections-in-transatlantic-trade-deal-a-945107.html|title= Corporation Carte Blanche: Will US-EU Trade Become Too Free?|last=Schiessl|first=Michaela|date=23 January 2014|work=[[Spiegel International]]|publisher=Spiegel Online|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, [[Martti Koskenniemi]], Professor of International Law at the [[University of Helsinki]], warned that the planned foreign investor protection scheme within the treaty, similar to [[World Bank Group]]'s [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID), would endanger the sovereignty of the signatory states by allowing for a small circle of legal experts sitting in a foreign court of arbitration an unprecedented power to interpret and void the signatory states' legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hs.fi/sunnuntai/Professori+Suomen+valta+s%C3%A4%C3%A4t%C3%A4%C3%A4+lakeja+voi+vaarantua+/a1386995885773|title=Professori: Suomen valta säätää lakeja voi vaarantua |last=Konttinen|first=Jussi|date=15 December 2013|work=[[Helsingin Sanomat]]|publisher=Sanoma Oyj|language=Finnish|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faced with such broad and vociferous criticism, ISDS was abandoned in September 2015; in its place, the European Commission proposed an Investment Court System (ICS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = EU proposes new trade court with US|url = https://euobserver.com/economic/130297|website = EUobserver|access-date = 23 February 2016|last = Nielsen|first = Nikolaj|date = 16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.greenpeace.org/eu-unit/Global/eu-unit/reports-briefings/2016/2016_02_11_Greenpeace%20Position%20Paper%20ICS_Final.pdf|title = From ISDS to ICS: A Leopard Can't Change Its Spots|date = 11 February 2016|access-date = 23 February 2016 |page = 1 |publisher = Greenpeace Position Paper |author = Greenpeace}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not long afterwards, ICS was declared illegal by the German Association of Magistrates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = TTIP investor court illegal, say German judges|url = https://euobserver.com/economic/132142|website = EUobserver|access-date = 6 February 2016|date = 4 February 2016|last = Nielsen|first = Nikolaj}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the commission dismissed the magistrates' judgement as based on a misunderstanding.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title = EU defends TTIP investor court after German backlash|url = https://euobserver.com/economic/132295|website = EUobserver|access-date = 23 February 2016|date = 17 February 2016|last = Nielsen|first = Nikolaj}}&lt;/ref&gt; For its part, the United States wants ISDS reinstated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In February 2016, Labour (UK) leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] said that human rights should be part of TTIP,   
describing TTIP as a threat to national sovereignty, workers, consumers, health and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/ttip-human-rights-workers-corporate-court-law-jeremy-corbyn-david-cameron-pmqs-a6889531.html TTIP 'must include human rights', Jeremy Corbyn tells David Cameron] H. Sheffield, The Independent, 22 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Public health and environment ====
According to a ''The Guardian'' report, TTIP draft leaked in 2016 shows "irreconcilable" differences between EU and the US in some areas, with the US demanding that EU compromise its "environmental, consumer protection and public health standards".&lt;ref name="The Guardian May 1, 2016"&gt;Arthur Neslen. [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/01/leaked-ttip-documents-cast-doubt-on-eu-us-trade-deal Leaked TTIP documents cast doubt on EU-US trade deal]. ''[[The Guardian]]''. 1 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Health care =====
{{See also|Healthcare in Europe|Health care in the United States}}
[[Trade unions in the United Kingdom|British unions]] such as [[Unite the Union|Unite]] and the [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] have opposed TTIP on the grounds that it would undermine the [[National Health Service]] and allows for the further [[privatisation]] of public services. A Unite spokesperson described TTIP as "about deregulation and a [[race to the bottom]] on standards. Unison has fought and won on bringing services back into the public sector. ... We cannot allow TTIP to threaten those successes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chako|first1=Ben|title=TUC says no to TTIP|url=http://www.ukpressonline.co.uk/ukpressonline/getDocument/DWMS_2014_09_11_001?fileType=PDF|accessdate=7 April 2016|work=Morning Star|date=11 September 2014|page=1|format=PDF|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Foreign Secretary [[David Owen]] said that TTIP would have a significant negative impact on the UK's [[National Health Service]] because the Service would be subject to increased competition under the TTIP regime.&lt;ref name="Telegraph 6/4/16"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/06/nhs-would-be-completely-unrecognisable-within-years-if-uk-remain/ NHS would be 'completely unrecognisable' within years if UK remains inside the EU] K. McCann, The Daily Telegraph, 6 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Former UK prime minister [[David Cameron]] said that critics of [[free-trade]] should not use the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) to take people's attention away, and honestly speak about trade deals. UK's [[Department of Business, Innovation and Skills]] said that TTIP provided adequate protection for UK's NHS.&lt;ref name=rt09052016TTIP&gt;[https://www.rt.com/uk/342384-ttip-deal-nhs-cameron/ ‘Slippery fish’ Cameron is duping the public, TTIP is threat to NHS, critics say] RT, 9 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Assistant General Secretary of [[Unite the Union|Unite]] [[Gail Cartmail]] said that TTIP was a real and serious threat to the NHS, adding that the threat would not be neutralised unless [[David Cameron]] gave a cast-iron guarantee that he would exclude the NHS from TTIP.&lt;ref name=rt09052016TTIP /&gt;

===== Consumer protection and food safety =====
{{See also|European Food Safety Authority|Regulation of genetically modified organisms in the European Union|Pesticide regulation in the United States}}

Documents released in May 2015 showed that US negotiators had pressured the EU over proposed pesticide criteria. A number of pesticides containing [[endocrine disrupting chemicals]] were forbidden in draft EU criteria. On 2 May 2013, US negotiators insisted the EU drop the criteria. They stated that a risk-based approach should be taken on regulation. Later the same day [[Catherine Day]] ([[Secretary-General of the European Commission]]) wrote to Karl Falkenberg ([[Directorate-General for the Environment|Director General for the Environment]]) asking for these criteria to be removed.{{r|guardian22may15}} {{As of|2015}}, 82 pesticides used in the US were banned in Europe and US [[animal welfare]] standards are generally lower than those in Europe.&lt;ref name="BBC 10 June 2015"/&gt;

A columnist in ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated that [[food safety]] in the EU might be compromised because of low or different standards in US food regulations,&lt;ref name="guardian August 3, 2015"/&gt; if currently EU-banned food were allowed to be imported.&lt;ref name="guardian October 18, 2015"&gt;Phillip Inman.

[[The Guardian]]. 18 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, the [[BBC]] reported that food safety had become 'a stumbling block' because of differing US and EU attitudes to [[genetically modified crops]], [[pesticides]] ([[Endocrine disruptor|endocrine disrupting chemicals]]), [[growth hormone#Agricultural use|growth promoting hormones]] in beef and [[pathogen]] reduction treatments of [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], that cause public health concerns for consumers and put European farmers at a cost disadvantage.&lt;ref name="BBC 10 June 2015"&gt;Laurence Peter. [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33055665 TTIP talks: Food fights block EU–US trade deal]. [[BBC News]]. 10 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Ban on [[animal testing]] in the EU has been described by ''The Guardian'' as "irreconcilable" with the US approach.&lt;ref name="The Guardian May 1, 2016"/&gt;

===== Environment protection and climate change =====
{{See also|Environmental policy of the European Union|Climate change mitigation|Politics of global warming}}

A draft of the sustainable development section of TTIP was leaked to ''[[The Guardian]]'' in October 2015. Asked to comment on the document, a French environmental attorney described the proposed environmental safeguards as "virtually non-existent" by comparison with the protection granted to investors, and that environmental cases accounted for 60% of the 127 [[Investor-state dispute settlement|ISDS]] cases already brought against EU countries under bilateral trade agreements in the last two decades, according to [[Friends of the Earth Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Nielsen |first= Arthur |date= 23 October 2015 |title= TTIP: EU negotiators appear to break environmental pledge in leaked draft |url= https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/23/ttip-eu-negotiators-appear-to-break-environmental-pledge-in-leaked-draft |website= theguardian.com |accessdate= 23 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]], TTIP could have a "chilling" effect on regulation and thus "undercut urgently needed action on climate that the Paris agreement requires". He says that industries that do not pay for the "social costs" of pollution in effect receive hidden subsidies, and that TTIP would give companies many more opportunities to sue governments over environmental protection mechanisms.&lt;ref name="stiglitz-2016"&gt;{{cite news | first = Joseph E | last = Stiglitz | author-link = Joseph E.

The draft energy chapter of the TTIP was leaked to ''[[The Guardian]]'' in July 2016.&lt;ref name="neslen-2016"&gt;{{cite news | first = Arthur | last = Neslen | title = Leaked TTIP energy proposal could 'sabotage' EU climate policy | date = 11 July 2016 | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/11/leaked-ttip-energy-proposal-could-sabotage-eu-climate-policy | access-date = 11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Guardian'', this draft could "sabotage" European efforts to implement mandatory energy savings measures and to favor the switch to renewable electricity generation.  The draft text obliges the two trade blocs to: "foster industry self-regulation of energy efficiency requirements for goods where such self-regulation is likely to deliver the policy objectives faster or in a less costly manner than mandatory requirements".&lt;ref name="neslen-2016"/&gt;  The draft also mandates that operators of energy networks grant access to gas and electricity "on commercial terms that are reasonable, transparent and non-discriminatory, including as between types of energy".&lt;ref name="neslen-2016"/&gt;  This would open [[feed-in tariff]] schemes to commercial challenge, including [[German Renewable Energy Sources Act|that]] used by Germany.  The [[The Greens (Luxembourg)|Green]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Claude Turmes]] stated: "These proposals are completely unacceptable. They would sabotage EU legislators' ability to privilege renewables and energy efficiency over unsustainable fossil fuels. This is an attempt to undermine democracy in Europe."&lt;ref name="neslen-2016"/&gt;

The EU's draft text for the trade and sustainable development chapter was also leaked to ''[[The Guardian]]'' in July 2016.&lt;ref name="neslen-2016-b"&gt;{{cite news | first = Arthur | last = Neslen | title = TTIP proposal casts doubt on G20 climate pledge, leaked EU draft shows | date =  13 July 2016 | newspaper = The Guardian | url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/13/ttip-proposal-casts-doubt-on-g20-climate-pledge-leaked-eu-draft-shows | access-date = 2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The draft, dated 23 June 2016 and marked "restricted", reveals new loopholes on a [[G20]] pledge to phase out inefficient [[Energy subsidies|fossil fuel subsidies]] by 2025.

==== Banking regulation ====
{{See also|Bank regulation in the United States}}

According to critics, TTIP could weaken the stricter [[bank regulation]]s that are governing banks in the United States as part of the financial reforms that followed the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]].&lt;ref name="The Independent October 6, 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 18 December 2014"&gt;Leala Padmanabhan.

==== Privacy ====
{{See also|Mass surveillance in the United States|Internet censorship in the United States}}

Critics of TTIP argue that its proposals on intellectual property could have a similar effect as the EU-rejected [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement]] (ACTA).&lt;ref name="BBC 18 December 2014"/&gt; The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] and its German counterpart, [[Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure|FFII]], in particular, compared TTIP to the ACTA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=EFF|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/03/transatlantic-declaration-leave-copyright-patent-issues-out-tafta|title=Transatlantic Civil Society Declaration: Leave Copyright and Patent Provisions Out of TAFTA|accessdate= 18 March 2013|date= 18 March 2013|author= Maira Sutton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stop TTIP Martin Schulz 01.jpg|thumb|"Stop TTIP" [[Civil society campaign|campaigner]]s hand 3,284,289 signatures to [[Martin Schulz]], [[President of the European Parliament]], November 2015.]]

In 2014, an online consultation conducted by the European Commission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-292_en.htm |title= European Commission launches public online consultation on investor protection in TTIP |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= 27 March 2014 |website= |publisher= [[European Commission]] |accessdate= 26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; received 150,000 responses.

A self-organised [[European Citizens' Initiative]] against TTIP and [[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement|CETA]] has also been established, acquiring over 3.2&amp;nbsp;million signatures within a year.&lt;ref name="guard 3 Aug 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stop TTIP"/&gt;

===National objections===
From both the European and American sides of the agreement, there are issues which are seen as essential if an accord is to be reached.  According to Leif Johan Eliasson of Saarland University, "For the EU these include greater access to the American public procurement market, retained bans on imports of [[genetically modified organisms]] (GMO) crops and [[Beef hormone controversy|hormone treated beef]], and recognition of [[geographical indications|geographic trademarks on food products]]. For the United States they include greater access for American dairy and other agricultural products (including scientific studies as the only accepted criteria for [[Sanitary and phytosanitary measures and agreements|SPS]] policies)." He observes that measures like the EU ban on hormone treated beef (based as they are on the [[precautionary principle]]) are not considered by the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] to be based on scientific studies.

Eliasson further states that US objectives in a deal include "tariff-free motor vehicle exports," and retained bans on foreign contractors in several areas," including domestic shipping (see [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920]]).&lt;ref name="eliasson2013"&gt;Leif Johan Eliasson, [http://jean-monnet-saar.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/10_07_14_TTIP-Eliasson.pdf What is at stake in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP)? Assessing challenges and possible compromises], Saarland University, 10 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Already, some American producers are concerned by EU proposals to restrict use of "[[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|particular designations]]" (also known as &lt;!-- people may search for: --&gt;PDO or GI/geographical indications) that the EU considers location-specific, such as [[feta]] and [[Parmesan]] cheeses and possibly [[Budweiser Budvar|Budweiser]] beer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21607867-europeans-want-their-food-names-back-americans-are-peeved-stressed-are-cheesemakers Food names: Stressed are the cheesemakers: Europeans want their food names back.

[[Budweiser Budvar]] is already [[Budweiser trademark dispute|party to a trademark dispute]] with [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]] over which has the right to use the term.&lt;/ref&gt; This has provoked debate between European politicians such as [[Renate Künast]] and [[Christian Schmidt (politician)|Christian Schmidt]] over the value of the designations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/trade-society/germans-fret-about-kentucky-fried-bratwurst-under-ttip-311067|title=Germans fret about 'Kentucky Fried Bratwurst' under TTIP|work=EurActiv – EU News &amp; policy debates, across languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to criticism===
[[Karel De Gucht]] responded to criticism in a ''Guardian'' article in December 2013,&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian (2 December 2013) [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/02/transatlantic-free-trade-deal-regulation-by-lawyers-eu-us The lies behind this transatlantic trade deal] Retrieved 1 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; saying "The commission has regularly consulted a broad range of civil society organisations in writing and in person, and our most recent meeting had 350 participants from trade unions, NGOs and business" and that "no agreement will become law before it is thoroughly examined and signed off by the European parliament and 29 democratically elected national governments – the US government and 28 in the EU's council"&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian (18 December 2013) [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/18/wrong-george-monbiot-nothing-secret-eu-trade-deal You're wrong, George Monbiot – there is nothing secret about this EU trade deal] Retrieved 2 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Corporate Europe Observatory]] (cited in the original ''Guardian'' article) had pointed out, based on a [[Freedom of Information]] request, that "more than 93% of the Commission's meetings with stakeholders during the preparations of the negotiations were with big business". They characterized the industry meetings as "about the EU's preparations of the trade talks", and the civil society consultation as "an information session after the talks were launched".&lt;ref&gt;Corporate Europe Observatory (4 September 2013) [http://corporateeurope.org/trade/2013/09/european-commission-preparing-eu-us-trade-talks-119-meetings-industry-lobbyists European Commission preparing for EU-US trade talks] Retrieved 14 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect on third-party countries ==
[[File:Transatlantic Free Trade Area.svg|thumb|A possible future Transatlantic Free Trade Area: &lt;br /&gt;the United States and European Union in dark blue and the other possible members in light blue ([[NAFTA]] and [[EFTA]])]]

Looking beyond TTIP, a wider "transatlantic free trade area" has been postulated.{{by whom|date=April 2016}}{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} This might include, on the American side, the other members of [[North American Free Trade Area]] (Canada and Mexico); and on the European side, the members of the [[European Free Trade Association]] (Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein). Mexico already has a free trade agreement with EFTA [[Free Trade Agreement between Mexico and the European Union|and the EU]] while [[Canada–European Free Trade Association Free Trade Agreement|Canada has one with EFTA]] and has [[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement|negotiated one with the EU]]. These agreements may need to be harmonized with the EU-US agreement and could potentially form a wider free trade area.

In early 2013, Canadian media observers had speculated that the launch of TTIP talks put pressure on Canada to secure ratification of its own three-year-long FTA negotiations with the EU by the close of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Barrie Mckenna And Bertrand Marotte |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/potential-us-eu-free-trade-union-puts-the-squeeze-on-canada/article8592389/ |title=Potential US-EU free-trade union 'puts the squeeze' on Canada |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date=13 February 2013 |accessdate=2014-02-21 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countries with customs agreements with the EU, [[European Union–Turkey Customs Union|like Turkey's]], could face the prospect of opening their markets to American goods, without access for their own goods without a separate agreement with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/transatlantic-alliance-to-cost-turkey-20-billion.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nid=53844&amp;NewsCatID=344 |title=Transatlantic alliance to cost Turkey '$20&amp;nbsp;billion' – ECONOMICS |publisher=Hurriyetdailynews.com |date=13 September 2011 |accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 28, 2005, [[XM Satellite Radio]] announced that it had teamed up with [[Neural Audio Corporation]] to introduce '''XM HD Surround''', XM HD Surround broadcasts XM channels in 5.1 digital [[surround sound]]. For a time XM broadcast a variety of special shows and live music performances in this format. According to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20051231051818/http://www.xmradio.com/newsroom/screen/pr_2005_12_28.html press release], [[Denon]], [[Onkyo]], [[Pioneer Electronics]] (USA) Inc., and [[Yamaha]] will introduce home audio systems capable of playing XM HD Surround in 2006.

The 5.1 surround sound is encoded in the stereo wave for transmission and is thus compatible with any mono/stereo/matrix-style receiver. If played on a 5.1 audio set equipped with [[Neural Surround]] decoder, the [[watermarks]] (i.e. spatial cues) in the waveforms are detected and the signal is recovered to its original 5.1 form. The technology is similar to [[parametric stereo]], in which a mono signal is recovered to stereo. The [[bitrate]] for XMHD surround broadcasts is ~70 kbit/s using [[aacPlus]] from [[Coding Technologies]].
