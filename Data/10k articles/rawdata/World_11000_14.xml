[[File:Apostolic Nunciature to China (2015-).jpg|thumb|Apostolic Nunciature in the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan)]]

An '''Apostolic Nunciature''' is a top-level [[diplomatic mission]] of the [[Holy See]], equivalent to an [[embassy]]. However, it does not issue visas, nor does it have [[Consul (representative)|consulates]].

The head of the Apostolic Nunciature is called a ''[[nuncio]]'', an ecclesiastical diplomatic title. A papal nuncio (officially known as an Apostolic nuncio) is a permanent diplomatic representative (head of diplomatic mission) of the Holy See to a state or to one of two international intergovernmental organizations, the [[European Union]] or [[ASEAN]], having the rank of an [[ambassador]] extraordinary and plenipotentiary, and the ecclesiastical rank of [[titular bishop|titular]] [[archbishop]].  Papal representatives to other intergovernmental organizations are known as "permanent observers" or "delegates".

In several countries that have diplomatic relations with the Holy See, the Apostolic Nuncio is ''ipso facto'' the [[Diplomatic corps#Dean of the Diplomatic Corps|Dean of the Diplomatic Corps]]. The nuncio is first in the [[order of precedence]] among all the diplomats accredited to the country, and he speaks for the diplomatic corps in matters of diplomatic privilege and protocol. Most countries that concede priority to the nuncio are officially Catholic, but some are not.

In addition, the nuncio serves as the liaison between the Holy See and the Church in that particular nation, supervising the diocesan episcopate (usually a national [[conference of bishops]] which has its own elected President, often the highest-ranking (arch)bishop, especially if his seat carries the title of [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] or he has individually been created a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]).  The nuncio has an important role in the selection of bishops.

''Bahrayn'' is the [[dual form]] of Arabic ''bahr'' ("sea"), so ''al-Bahrayn'' originally means "the two seas". However, the name has been lexicalised as a feminine [[proper noun]] and does not follow the grammatical rules for duals; thus its form is always ''Bahrayn'' and never ''Bahrān'', the expected [[nominative]] form. Endings are added to the word with no changes, as in the name of the national anthem ''Bahraynunā'' ("our Bahrain") or the [[demonym]] ''Bahraynī''. The mediaeval grammarian [[Ismail ibn Hammad al-Jawhari|al-Jawahari]] commented on this saying that the more formally correct term ''Bahrī'' (lit. "belonging to the sea") would have been misunderstood and so was unused.&lt;ref name="Faroughy"/&gt;

It remains disputed which "two seas" the name ''Bahrayn'' originally refers to.&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt; The term appears five times in the [[Quran]], but does not refer to the modern island—originally known to the Arabs as ''Awal''—but, rather, to all of Eastern Arabia (most notably [[al-Katif]] and [[al-Hasa]]).&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Houtsma |first=M.

Bahrain was home to the [[Dilmun civilization]], an important [[Bronze Age]] trade centre linking [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Indus River|Indus Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1192 |title=Qal'at al-Bahrain – Ancient Harbour and Capital of Dilmun |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahrain was later ruled by the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Babylonia]]ns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Life and Land Use on the Bahrain Islands: The Geoarchaeology of an Ancient Society |last=Larsen |first=Curtis E. |year=1984 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-46906-5 |pages=52–55 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Q65mRSPPU6UC&amp;pg=PA52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 6th to 3rd century BC, Bahrain was part of the [[Persian Empire]] ruled by the [[Achaemenian]] dynasty. By about 250 BC, [[Parthia]] brought the Persian Gulf under its control and extended its influence as far as Oman. The Parthians established garrisons along the southern coast of the Persian Gulf to control trade routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Federal Research Division|year=2004 |title=Bahrain |url=https://books.google.com/?id=OsSPaxEpUS4C

During the [[classical era]], Bahrain was referred to by the [[ancient Greek]]s as ''[[Tylos]]'', the centre of pearl trading, when the Greek admiral [[Nearchus]] serving under [[Alexander the Great]] landed on Bahrain.{{sfn|Larsen|1983|p=13}} Nearchus is believed to have been the first of Alexander's commanders to visit the island, and he found a verdant land that was part of a wide trading network; he recorded: "That on the island of Tylos, situated in the Persian Gulf, are large plantations of cotton trees, from which are manufactured clothes called ''sindones'', of strongly differing degrees of value, some being costly, others less expensive. The use of these is not confined to India, but extends to Arabia."&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Hermann Ludwig Heeren, Historical Researches Into the Politics, Intercourse, and Trade of the Principal Nations of Antiquity, Henry Bohn, 1854 p38&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek historian [[Theophrastus]] states that much of Bahrain was covered by these cotton trees and that Bahrain was famous for exporting walking canes engraved with emblems that were customarily carried in Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Heeren, ibid, p441&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander had planned to settle Greek colonists on Bahrain, and although it is not clear that this happened on the scale he envisaged, Bahrain became very much part of the Hellenised world: the language of the upper classes was Greek (although [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] was in everyday use), while [[Zeus]] was worshipped in the form of the Arabian sun-god Shams.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Ward, Bahrain: A Travel Guide, Oleander Press p68&lt;/ref&gt; Bahrain even became the site of Greek athletic contests.&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Fisher et al. The Cambridge History of Iran, Cambridge University Press 1968 p40&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek historian [[Strabo]] believed the [[Phoenicians]] originate from Bahrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ju. B. Tsirkin|title=Canaan. Phoenicia. Sidon. |url=http://www.aulaorientalis.org/AuOr%20escaneado/AuOr%2019-2001/2/7.pdf|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] also believed that the homeland of the Phoenicians was Bahrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R.

The name Tylos is thought to be a Hellenisation of the Semitic ''Tilmun'' (from [[Dilmun]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jean Francois Salles in Traces of Paradise: The Archaeology of Bahrain, 2500BC-300AD in Michael Rice, Harriet Crawford Ed, IB Tauris, 2002 p132&lt;/ref&gt; The term Tylos was commonly used for the islands until [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' when the inhabitants are referred to as Thilouanoi.&lt;ref name="Jean Francois Salles p132"&gt;Jean Francois Salles p132&lt;/ref&gt; Some place names in Bahrain go back to the Tylos era; for instance the name of Arad, a residential suburb of [[Muharraq]], is believed to originate from "Arados", the ancient Greek name for Muharraq.{{sfn|Larsen|1983|p=13}}

In the 3rd century, [[Ardashir I]], the first ruler of the [[Sassanid dynasty]], marched on Oman and Bahrain, where he defeated Sanatruq the ruler of Bahrain.&lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;{{cite book |title=Arabia and the Arabs: From the Bronze Age to the Coming of Islam |last=Hoyland |first=Robert G. |year=2001 |publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-19535-5 |page=28 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mZb9g1tSeXYC&amp;pg=PA28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Bahrain was known as [[Mishmahig]] (which in [[Pahlavi language|Middle-Persian/Pahlavi]] means "ewe-fish").&lt;ref&gt;Yoma 77a and Rosh Hashbanah, 23a&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahrain was also the site of worship of an ox deity called [[Awal]]. Worshipers built a large statue to Awal in [[Muharraq]], although it has now been lost. For many centuries after ''Tylos'', Bahrain was known as ''[[Awal]]''. By the 5th century, Bahrain became a centre for [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christianity]], with the village [[Samahij]]&lt;ref&gt;From Persian sa-mahij (سه ماهی) meaning Three Fish.&lt;/ref&gt; as the seat of bishops. In 410, according to the Oriental Syriac Church synodal records, a bishop named Batai was excommunicated from the church in Bahrain.&lt;ref name="Jean Francois Salles p132"/&gt; As a sect, the Nestorians were often persecuted as heretics by the [[Byzantine Empire]], but Bahrain was outside the Empire's control, offering some safety. The names of several [[Muharraq]] villages today reflect Bahrain's Christian legacy, with [[Al Dair]] meaning "the monastery".

===Middle Ages===
In 899, the [[Qarmatians]], a [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili]] Muslim sect, seized Bahrain, seeking to create a [[utopia]]n society based on reason and redistribution of property among initiates. Thereafter, the Qarmatians demanded [[tribute]] from the caliph in [[Baghdad]], and in 930 sacked [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], bringing the sacred [[Black Stone]] back to their base in [[Bahrain (historical region)|Ahsa]], in medieval Bahrain, for ransom. According to historian [[Al-Juwayni]], the stone was returned 22 years later in 951 under mysterious circumstances. Wrapped in a sack, it was thrown into the [[Great Mosque of Kufa]] in Iraq, accompanied by a note saying "By command we took it, and by command we have brought it back." The theft and removal of the Black Stone caused it to break into seven pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/islam/shia/qarma.html |title=Qarmatiyyah |publisher=St. Martin's College |work=Overview of World Religions |accessdate=4 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428055134/http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/islam/shia/qarma.html |archivedate=28 April 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glasse"&gt;Cyril Glasse, ''New Encyclopedia of Islam'', p. 245.

In 1521, the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] allied with Hormuz and seized Bahrain from the Jabrid ruler [[Muqrin ibn Zamil]], who was killed during the takeover. Portuguese rule lasted for around 80 years, during which time they depended mainly on [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Persian governors.&lt;ref name=Rentz/&gt; The Portuguese were expelled from the islands in 1602 by [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] of the [[Safavid dynasty]] of [[Iran|Persia]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cole|Cole]], p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; which gave impetus to [[Shia Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cole|Cole]], p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; For the next two centuries, Persian rulers retained control of the archipelago, interrupted by the 1717 and 1738 invasions of the [[Ibadhis]] of Oman.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;[[#Cole|Cole]], p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; During most of this period, they resorted to governing Bahrain indirectly, either through the city of [[Bushehr]] or through [[Immigration|immigrant]] Sunni Arab clans.

In 1860, the Al Khalifas used the same tactic when the British tried to overpower Bahrain. Writing letters to the Persians and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s, Al Khalifas agreed to place Bahrain under the latter's protection in March due to offering better conditions. Eventually the [[British Raj|Government of British India]] overpowered Bahrain when the Persians refused to protect it. Colonel [[Lewis Pelly|Pelly]] signed a new treaty with Al Khalifas placing Bahrain under British rule and protection.&lt;ref name=NAS/&gt;

Following the [[Qatari–Bahraini War]] in 1868, British representatives signed another agreement with the Al Khalifas. It specified that the ruler could not dispose of any of his territory except to the United Kingdom and could not enter into relationships with any foreign government without British consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last2=University of Exeter.

Unrest amongst the people of Bahrain began when Britain officially established complete dominance over the territory in 1892. The first revolt and widespread uprising took place in March 1895 against Sheikh Issa bin Ali, then ruler of Bahrain.{{sfn | Mojtahed-Zadeh | | 1999 | p=130}} Sheikh Issa was the first of the Al Khalifa to rule without Persian relations. [[Arnold Wilson|Sir Arnold Wilson]], Britain's representative in the Persian Gulf and author of ''The Persian Gulf'', arrived in Bahrain from Muscat at this time.{{sfn | Mojtahed-Zadeh | | 1999 | p=130}} The uprising developed further with some protesters killed by British forces.{{sfn | Mojtahed-Zadeh | | 1999 | p=130}}

Before the development of petroleum, the island was largely devoted to [[Pearl hunting|pearl fisheries]] and, as late as the 19th century, was considered to be the finest in the world.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} In 1903, German explorer, [[Hermann Burchardt]], visited Bahrain and took many photographs of historical sites, including the old ''Qaṣr es-Sheikh'', photos now stored at the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smb-digital.de/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&amp;module=collection&amp;objectId=625685&amp;bt=europeanaapi The old Qaṣr es-Sheikh] (click on photo to enlarge).&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[World War I|First World War]], there were about 400 vessels hunting pearls and an annual export of more than £30,000.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}

In 1911, a group of Bahraini merchants demanded restrictions on the British influence in the country. The group's leaders were subsequently arrested and exiled to India. In 1923, the British introduced [[Bahrain administrative reforms of the 1920s|administrative reforms]] and replaced Sheikh Issa bin Ali with his son. Some clerical opponents and families such as [[Dawasir|al Dossari]] left or were exiled to Saudi Arabia and Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bahrain's Re-Reform Movement |first=Jane |last=Kinninmont |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/67553/jane-kinninmont/bahrains-re-reform-movement |newspaper=Foreign Affairs |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later the British placed the country under the ''de facto'' rule of [[Charles Belgrave]] who operated as an adviser to the ruler until 1957.&lt;ref name="All at sea over 'the Gulf'"&gt;{{cite news |title=All at sea over 'the Gulf' |first=Mahan |last=Abedin |url=http://atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/FL09Ak03.html |work=Asia Times Online |date=9 December 2004 |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archiveeditions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archiveeditions.co.uk/titledetails.asp?tid=8 |title=Near &amp; Middle East Titles: Bahrain Government Annual Reports 1924–1970 |publisher=Cambridge Archives Editions |archivedate=3 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6B8hiC1qB?url=http://www.archiveeditions.co.uk/titledetails.asp?tid=8 |accessdate=2 October 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Belgrave brought a number of reforms such as establishment of the country's first modern school in 1919, the Persian Gulf's first girls' school in 1928&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bahrain Education |url=http://looklex.com/e.o/bahrain.education.htm |accessdate=17 June 2012 |archivedate=3 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6B8l8HHzV?url=http://looklex.com/e.o/bahrain.education.htm |publisher=looklex.com |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the abolition of [[Arab slave trade|slavery]] in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://gulfnews.com/opinions/columnists/treasure-troves-of-history-and-diversity-1.1137150 Treasure troves of history and diversity]".

In 1927, [[Rezā Shāh]], then [[Shah of Iran]], demanded sovereignty over Bahrain in a letter to the [[League of Nations]], a move that prompted Belgrave to undertake harsh measures including encouraging conflicts between [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and Sunni Muslims in order to bring down the uprisings and limit the Iranian influence.&lt;ref name=ICB&gt;{{cite web|title=Bahrain:"How was separated from Iran" ?|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/geography/articles/mishmahig_islands_bahrain.php|publisher=Iran Chamber Society|accessdate=17 June 2012}} Based on extracts from {{cite journal | title=Bahrain: the land of political movements | last=Mojtahedzadeh | first=Piruz | journal=Rahavard, a Persian Journal of Iranian Studies | year=1995 | volume=XI | issue=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belgrave even went further by suggesting to rename the [[Persian Gulf]] to the "Arabian Gulf"; however, the proposal was refused by the British government.&lt;ref name="All at sea over 'the Gulf'"/&gt; Britain's interest in Bahrain's development was motivated by concerns over Saudi and Iranian ambitions in the region.

The country also claims a further {{convert|22|km|nmi|0|abbr=on}} of [[territorial sea]] and a {{convert|44|km|nmi|0|abbr=on}} [[contiguous zone]]. Bahrain's largest islands are [[Bahrain Island]], the [[Hawar Islands]], [[Muharraq Island]], [[Umm an Nasan]], and [[Sitra]]. Bahrain has mild winters and very hot, humid summers. The country's natural resources include large quantities of oil and natural gas as well as fish in the offshore waters.

About 92% of Bahrain is desert with periodic droughts and dust storms, the main natural hazards for Bahrainis.&lt;ref name=TR/&gt; Environmental issues facing Bahrain include desertification resulting from the degradation of limited arable land, coastal degradation (damage to coastlines, [[coral reef]]s, and sea vegetation) resulting from oil spills and other discharges from large tankers, oil refineries, distribution stations, and illegal land reclamation at places such as [[Tubli Bay]]. The agricultural and domestic sectors' over-utilisation of the [[Dammam Aquifer]], the principal aquifer in Bahrain, has led to its [[Soil salinity|salinisation]] by adjacent brackish and saline water bodies. A hydrochemical study identified the locations of the sources of aquifer salinisation and delineated their areas of influence. The investigation indicates that the aquifer water quality is significantly modified as groundwater flows from the northwestern parts of Bahrain, where the aquifer receives its water by lateral underflow from eastern Saudi Arabia, to the southern and southeastern parts. Four types of salinisation of the aquifer are identified: brackish-water up-flow from the underlying brackish-water zones in north-central, western, and eastern regions; seawater intrusion in the eastern region; intrusion of [[sabkha]] water in the southwestern region; and irrigation return flow in a local area in the western region. Four alternatives for the management of groundwater quality that are available to the water authorities in Bahrain are discussed and their priority areas are proposed, based on the type and extent of each salinisation source, in addition to groundwater use in that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Bahrain under the Al-Khalifa is a [[constitutional monarchy]] headed by the [[King of Bahrain|King]], [[Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa|Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa]]. King Hamad enjoys wide executive powers which include appointing the [[Prime Minister of Bahrain|Prime Minister]] and his [[Cabinet of Bahrain|ministers]], commanding the [[Bahrain Defence Force|army]], chairing the [[Judiciary of Bahrain|Higher Judicial Council]], appointing the [[National Assembly (Bahrain)|parliament]]'s [[Consultative Council (Bahrain)|upper house]] and dissolving its elected [[Council of Representatives (Bahrain)|lower house]].&lt;ref name="bici"/&gt;{{rp|page=15}} The head of government is the unelected prime minister, Shaikh Khalīfa bin Salman Al Khalifa, the uncle of the current king who has served in this position since 1971, making him the longest-serving prime minister in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/bahrain/index.html "Bahrain News — The Protests"].

Bahrain has a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] National Assembly (''al-Jam'iyyah al-Watani'') consisting of the Shura Council (''Majlis Al-Shura'') with 40 seats and the Council of Representatives (''Majlis Al-Nuwab'') with 40 seats. The forty members of the Shura are appointed by the king. In the Council of Representatives, 40 members are elected by absolute majority vote in single-member constituencies to serve four-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electionguide.org/country.php?ID=18|title=Bahrain|date=26 July 2010|publisher=[[International Foundation for Electoral Systems]]|accessdate=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appointed council "exercises a ''de facto'' veto" over the elected, because draft acts must be approved so they may pass into law. After approval, the king may ratify and issue the act or return it within six months to the National Assembly where it may only pass into law if approved by two thirds of both councils.&lt;ref name="bici"/&gt;{{rp|page=15}}

===Media===
Bahraini journalists risk prosecution for offenses which include "undermining" the government and religion. [[Self-censorship]] is widespread. Journalists were targeted by officials during anti-government protests in 2011. Three editors from opposition daily [[Al-Wasat (Bahraini newspaper)|''Al-Wasat'']] were sacked and later fined for publishing "false" news. Several foreign correspondents were expelled.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14541053 | work=BBC News | title=Bahrain profile | date=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most domestic broadcasters are state-run. An independent commission, set up to look into the unrest, found that state media coverage was at times inflammatory. It said opposition groups suffered from lack of access to mainstream media, and recommended that the government "consider relaxing censorship". Bahrain will host the Saudi-financed [[Alarab News Channel]], expected to launch in December 2012. It will be based at a planned "Media City". An opposition satellite station, Lualua TV, operates from London but has found its signals blocked.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

According to a January 2006 report by the [[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia]], Bahrain has the fastest-growing economy in the Arab world.&lt;ref name="Ref_2008"&gt;[http://www.arabianbusiness.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7116 Bahrain expected to bustle] Arabian Business, 1 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Bahrain also has the freest economy in the Middle East and is twelfth-freest overall in the world based on the 2011 [[Index of Economic Freedom]] published by the [[Heritage Foundation]]/''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref name="Ref_2011"&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/index/ Index of Economic Freedom] Heritage Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic conditions have fluctuated with the changing price of oil since 1985, for example during and following the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf crisis of 1990–91]]. With its highly developed communication and transport facilities, Bahrain is home to a number of multinational firms and construction proceeds on several major industrial projects. A large share of exports consist of petroleum products made from imported crude oil, which accounted for 51% of the country's imports in 2007.&lt;ref name=TR&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Report: Bahrain 2010|publisher=Oxford Business Group|isbn=978-1-907065-22-4|pages=12–25|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jipEf3jnyIoC&amp;pg=PA25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahrain depends heavily on food imports to feed its growing population; it relies heavily on meat imports from [[Australia]] and also imports 75% of its total fruit consumption needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bahrain fully stocked for Eid al-Adha: official|url=http://al-shorfa.com/en_GB/articles/meii/features/main/2011/11/03/feature-03|accessdate=3 October 2012|newspaper=Al Shorfa|date=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DT/&gt; Since only 2.9% of the country's land is [[arable land|arable]], [[agriculture]] contributes to 0.5% of Bahrain's GDP.&lt;ref name=DT&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bahrain food import bill to zoom 128pc |url=http://www.dt.bh/newsdetails.php?newsid=081111221401&amp;key=301110213629 |accessdate=3 October 2012 |newspaper=Daily Tribune |date=9 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117000029/http://www.dt.bh/newsdetails.php?newsid=081111221401&amp;key=301110213629 |archivedate=17 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Bahrain signed the [[Bahrain–United States Free Trade Agreement|Bahrain–US Free Trade Agreement]], which will reduce certain trade barriers between the two nations.&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14541322 |title=Bahrain profile: Timeline |date=3 October 2012 |publisher=BBC News |archivedate=6 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BD7MX6BI?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14541322 |accessdate=5 October 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, due to the combination of the [[global financial crisis]] and the [[Bahraini uprising (2011–present)|recent unrest]], the gdp growth rate decreased to 1.3%, which was the lowest growth rate since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bahrain economy slows to 1.3 pct q/q growth in Q4|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/21/bahrain-gdp-idUSL6E8EL12B20120321|accessdate=29 June 2012|publisher=Reuters|date=21 March 2012|first=Martin|last=Dokoupil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Muharraq and Manama.jpg|thumb|left|The cities of [[Muharraq]] (''foreground'') and [[Manama]] (background)]]

As a tourist destination, Bahrain received over eight million visitors in 2008, though the exact number varies yearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tourism sector performance |url=http://www.bahrainedb.com/uploadedFiles/Bahraincom/BahrainForBusiness/11.%20AER%20-%20Articles%20-%20Tourism%20Sector%20Performance.pdf |work=Economic Development Board – Bahrain |accessdate=17 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812082521/http://www.bahrainedb.com/uploadedFiles/Bahraincom/BahrainForBusiness/11.%20AER%20-%20Articles%20-%20Tourism%20Sector%20Performance.pdf |archivedate=12 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these are from the surrounding Arab states although an increasing number hail from outside the region due to growing awareness of the kingdom's heritage and its higher profile as a result of the [[Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain International F1 Circuit]].

The kingdom combines modern Arab culture and the archaeological legacy of five thousand years of civilisation. The island is home to forts including [[Qalat Al Bahrain]] which has been listed by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]]. The [[Bahrain National Museum]] has artefacts from the country's history dating back to the island's first human inhabitants some 9000 years ago and the [[Beit Al Quran]] (Arabic: بيت القرآن, meaning: the House of Qur'an) is a museum that holds Islamic artefacts of the [[Qur'an]]. Some of the popular historical tourist attractions in the kingdom are the [[Al Khamis Mosque]], which is one of the oldest mosques in the region, the [[Arad fort]] in Muharraq, [[Barbar temple]], which is an ancient temple from the Dilmunite period of Bahrain, as well as the [[Dilmun Burial Mounds|A'ali Burial Mounds]] and the [[Sar, Bahrain|Saar]] temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Popular Attractions|url=http://www.bahrainguide.org/BG2/popularattractions.html|publisher=Bahrain Guide|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tree of Life, Bahrain|Tree of Life]], a 400-year-old tree that grows in the [[Sakhir]] desert with no nearby water, is also a popular tourist attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tree of Life, Bahrain |url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/As/Bahrain/Southern/TreeOfLife.htm |publisher=Wondermondo |accessdate=25 June 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6B8zQzRGp?url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/As/Bahrain/Southern/TreeOfLife.htm |archivedate=3 October 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bird watching]] (primarily in the [[Hawar Islands]]), [[scuba diving]], and [[horse riding]] are popular tourist activities in Bahrain. Many tourists from nearby Saudi Arabia and across the region visit Manama primarily for the [[shopping malls]] in the capital Manama, such as the [[Bahrain City Centre]] and [[Seef Mall]] in the [[Seef]] district of Manama. The [[Manama Souq]] and ''Gold Souq'' in the old district of Manama are also popular with tourists.&lt;ref name=MoFA&gt;{{cite web|title=Tourism|url=http://www.mofa.gov.bh/Default.aspx?tabid=134|publisher=Bahraini Ministry of Foreign Affairs|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Transport in Bahrain}}
Bahrain has one main [[international airport]], the [[Bahrain International Airport]] (BIA) which is located on the island of Muharraq, in the north-east. The airport handled more than 100,000 flights and more than 8 million passengers in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Traffic Statistics: December 2010 |url=http://www.caa.gov.bh/2010/FlashReportDEC2010.pdf |publisher=Civil Aviations Affairs, Bahrain |accessdate=5 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117000006/http://www.caa.gov.bh/2010/FlashReportDEC2010.pdf |archivedate=17 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahrain's national carrier, [[Gulf Air]] operates and bases itself in the BIA.

Bahrain has a well-developed [[Road transport in Bahrain|road network]], particularly in Manama. The discovery of oil in the early 1930s accelerated the creation of multiple roads and [[highways]] in Bahrain, connecting several isolated villages, such as [[Budaiya]], to Manama.&lt;ref name=Yasser&gt;{{Cite book |last=Elsheshtawy |first=Yasser |year=2008 |title=The evolving Arab city: tradition, modernity and urban development |url=https://books.google.com/?id=O8Zz-2AtuIwC|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-12821-1 |page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the east, a bridge connected Manama to Muharraq since 1929, a new causeway was built in 1941 which replaced the old wooden bridge.&lt;ref name=Yasser/&gt; Currently there are three modern bridges connecting the two locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=326003 |title=Seaview blow for Manama |author=Al A'Ali, Mohammed |date=18 March 2012 |work=Gulf Daily News |archivedate=4 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BA6e17yY?url=http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=326003 |accessdate=3 October 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transits between the two islands peaked after the construction of the Bahrain International Airport in 1932.&lt;ref name=Yasser/&gt; [[Ring roads]] and highways were later built to connect Manama to the villages of the [[Northern Governorate]] and towards towns in central and southern Bahrain.

The four main islands and all the towns and villages are linked by well-constructed roads. There were {{convert|3164|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of roadways in 2002, of which {{convert|2433|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} were paved. A [[causeway]] stretching over {{convert|2.8|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, connect Manama with [[Muharraq Island]], and another bridge joins [[Sitra]] to the main island. The [[King Fahd Causeway]], measuring {{convert|24|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, links Bahrain with the Saudi Arabian mainland via the island of [[Umm an-Nasan]]. It was completed in December 1986, and financed by [[Saudi Arabia]]. In 2008, there were 17,743,495 passengers transiting through the causeway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Passenger Statistics|url=http://www.kfca.com.sa/en/pages.aspx?pageid=288|publisher=King Fahd Causeway Authority|accessdate=25 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117001527/http://www.kfca.com.sa/en/pages.aspx?pageid=288|archive-date=17 January 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1999, Batelco had more than 100,000 mobile contracts.&lt;ref name=RE&gt;{{Cite book|title=Report: Bahrain 2008|year=2008|page=153|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HHmo2jjjb2AC&amp;pg=PA153|isbn=9781902339979|author1=Group|first1=Oxford Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, under pressure from international bodies, Bahrain implemented its telecommunications law which included the establishment of an independent ''[[Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Bahrain|Telecommunications Regulatory Authority]]'' (TRA).&lt;ref name=RE/&gt; In 2004, [[Zain Group|Zain]] (a rebranded version of [[MTC Vodafone]]) started operations in Bahrain and in 2010 [[VIVA Bahrain|VIVA]] (owned by [[Saudi Telecom Company|STC]] Group) became the third company to provide mobile services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=VIVA subscribers surge|url=http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=273916|work=Gulf Daily News|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahrain has been connected to the internet since 1995 with the country's [[domain suffix]] is '[[.bh]]'. The country's connectivity score (a statistic which measures both Internet access and fixed and mobile telephone lines) is 210.4 percent per person, while the regional average in [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf]] is 135.37 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arab Advisors Group reveals Bahrain's communications connectivity leading the region (press release) |url=http://www.ameinfo.com/165459.html |publisher=[[AMEinfo]] |accessdate=12 September 2011 |date=5 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607063909/http://www.ameinfo.com/165459.html |archivedate=7 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Bahraini [[internet users]] has risen from 40,000 in 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITU Internet Indicators 2000|url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/icteye/Reporting/ShowReportFrame.aspx?ReportName=/WTI/InformationTechnologyPublic&amp;ReportFormat=HTML4.0&amp;RP_intYear=2000&amp;RP_intLanguageID=1&amp;RP_bitLiveData=False|publisher=[[International Telecommunications Union]]|accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 250,000 in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITU Internet Indicators 2008|url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/icteye/Reporting/ShowReportFrame.aspx?ReportName=/WTI/InformationTechnologyPublic&amp;ReportFormat=HTML4.0&amp;RP_intYear=2008&amp;RP_intLanguageID=1&amp;RP_bitLiveData=False|publisher=[[International Telecommunications Union]]|accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or from 5.95 to 33 percent of the population. {{as of|2013|August|}}, the TRA has licensed 22 [[Internet Service Providers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Market Information – No. of Licenses Issued |url=http://www.tra.org.bh/en/marketLicenses.aspx |accessdate=29 August 2013 |publisher=Telecommunication Regulatory Authority (Kingdom of Bahrain) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515151105/http://www.tra.org.bh/EN/marketLicenses.aspx |archivedate=15 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science and technology==

=== Policy framework ===
The ''Bahraini Economic Vision 2030'' published in 2008 does not indicate how the stated goal of shifting from an economy built on oil wealth to a productive, globally competitive economy will be attained. Bahrain has already diversified its exports to some extent, out of necessity. It has the smallest hydrocarbon reserves of any Gulf state, producing 48,000 barrels per day from its one onshore field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salacanin|first=S.|date=February 2015|title=Oil and gas reserves: how long will they last?|url=|journal=Bq Magazine|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the country's revenue comes from its share in the offshore field administered by Saudi Arabia. The gas reserve in Bahrain is expected to last for less than 27 years, leaving the country with few sources of capital to pursue the development of new industries. Investment in research and development remained very low in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Apart from the Ministry of Education and the Higher Education Council, the two main hives of activity in science, technology, and innovation are the University of Bahrain (established in 1986) and the Bahrain Centre for Strategic, International, and Energy Studies. The latter was founded in 2009 to undertake research with a focus on strategic security and energy issues to encourage new thinking and influence policy-making.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== New infrastructure for science and education ===
Bahrain hopes to build a science culture within the kingdom and to encourage technological innovation, among other goals. In 2013, the Bahrain Science Centre was launched as an interactive educational facility targeting 6–18-year olds. The topics covered by current exhibitions include junior engineering, human health, the five senses, Earth sciences and biodiversity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In April 2014, Bahrain launched its National Space Science Agency. The agency has been working to ratify international space-related agreements such as the Outer Space Treaty, the Rescue Agreement, the Space Liability Convention, the Registration Convention and the Moon Agreement. The agency plans to establish infrastructure for the observation of both outer space and the Earth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In November 2008, an agreement was signed to establish a Regional Centre for Information and Communication Technology in Manama under the auspices of UNESCO. The aim is to establish a knowledge hub for the six member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council. In March 2012, the centre hosted two high-level workshops on ICTs and education. In 2013, Bahrain topped the Arab world for internet penetration (90% of the population), trailed by the United Arab Emirates (86%) and Qatar (85%). Just half of Bahrainis and Qataris (53%) and two-thirds of those in the United Arab Emirates (64%) had access in 2009.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Investment in education and research ===
In 2012, the government devoted 2.6% of GDP to education, one of the lowest ratios in the Arab world. This ratio was on a par with investment in education in Lebanon and higher only than that in Qatar (2.4% in 2008) and Sudan (2.2% in 2009).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=UNESCO Science Report|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahrain invests little in research and development. In 2009 and 2013, this investment reportedly amounted to 0.04% of GDP, although the data were incomplete, covering only the higher education sector. The lack of comprehensive data on research and development poses a challenge for policy-makers, as data inform evidence-based policy-making.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The available data for researchers in 2013 only cover the higher education sector. Here, the number of researchers is equivalent to 50 per million inhabitants, compared to a global average for all employment sectors of 1,083 per million.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The University of Bahrain had over 20,000 students in 2014, 65% of whom are women, and around 900 faculty members, 40% of whom are women. From 1986 to 2014, university staff published 5 500 papers and books. The university spent about US$11 million per year on research in 2014, which was conducted by a contingent of 172 men and 128 women. Women thus made up 43% of researchers at the University of Bahrain in 2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Bahrain was one of 11 Arab states which counted a majority of female university graduates in science and engineering in 2014. Women accounted for 66% of graduates in natural sciences, 28% of those in engineering and 77% of those in health and welfare. It is harder to judge the contribution of women to research, as the data for 2013 only cover the higher education sector.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Trends in research output ===
In 2014, Bahraini scientists published 155 articles in internationally cataloged journals, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). This corresponds to 15 articles per million inhabitants, compared to a global average of 176 per million inhabitants in 2013. Scientific output has risen slowly from 93 articles in 2005 and remains modest. By 2014, only Mauritania and Palestine had a smaller output in this database among Arab states.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Between 2008 and 2014, Bahraini scientists collaborated most with their peers from Saudi Arabia (137 articles), followed by Egypt (101), the United Kingdom (93), the United States (89) and Tunisia (75).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Ethnic groups===
{{Main|Bahraini people|Ethnic, cultural and religious groups of Bahrain}}
Bahraini people are ethnically diverse. Shia Bahrainis are divided into two main ethnic groups: [[Baharna]] and [[Ajam of Bahrain|Ajam]]. The Shia Bahrainis are [[Baharna]] (Arab), and the [[Ajam of Bahrain|Ajam]] are [[Iranian people|Persian]] Shias. Shia Persians form large communities in Manama and Muharraq. A small minority of Shia Bahrainis are ethnic Hasawis from [[Al-Hasa]].

Sunni Bahrainis are mainly divided into two main ethnic groups: Arabs (al Arab) and [[Huwala]]. Sunni Arabs are the most influential ethnic group in Bahrain, they hold most government positions and the [[Al Khalifa|Bahraini monarchy]] are Sunni Arabs. Sunni Arabs have traditionally lived in areas such as Zallaq, Muharraq, Riffa and Hawar islands. The Huwala are descendants of Sunni Iranians; some of them are Sunni Persians,&lt;ref name=mig&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theses.ncl.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/10443/730/1/Taqi10.pdf |title=Two ethnicities, three generations: Phonological variation and change in Kuwait |work=[[Newcastle University]] |year=2010 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bJLjAKH7-rIC&amp;pg=PA135 Dialect, Culture, and Society in Eastern Arabia: Glossary].

At the beginning of the 20th century, Qur'anic schools (''Kuttab'') were the only form of education in Bahrain.&lt;ref name=MoE/&gt; They were traditional schools aimed at teaching children and youth the reading of the [[Qur'an]]. After [[World War I]], Bahrain became open to western influences, and a demand for modern educational institutions appeared. 1919 marked the beginning of modern public school system in Bahrain when the [[Al-Hidaya Al-Khalifia School]] for boys opened in [[Muharraq]].&lt;ref name=MoE/&gt; In 1926, the Education Committee opened the second public school for boys in [[Manama]], and in 1928 the first public school for girls was opened in Muharraq.&lt;ref name=MoE&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Education in Bahrain |url=http://www.moe.gov.bh/en/history/Index.aspx |publisher=Ministry of Education, Bahrain |accessdate=28 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118203321/http://www.moe.gov.bh/en/history/Index.aspx |archivedate=18 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2011}}, there are a total of 126,981 students studying in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistics for the academic year 2011/2012|url=http://www.moe.gov.bh/archive/statistics/2011/st_class_gov.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Education, Bahrain|accessdate=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BS is a [[United States Department of Defense]] school that provides a K-12 curriculum including [[International Baccalaureate]] offerings. There are also private schools that offer either the [[IB Diploma Programme]] or United Kingdom's [[A-Levels]].

Bahrain also encourages institutions of higher learning, drawing on expatriate talent and the increasing pool of Bahrain nationals returning from abroad with advanced degrees.

The '''Bernese March''' (German '''Berner Marsch'''; French '''La Marche de Berne''') is the traditional anthem of the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Cantons of Switzerland|Canton]] of [[Canton of Bern|Bern]] and is played at official occasions.

The [[March (music)|march]] is of uncertain date; originally sung by Bernese mercenaries, it was adopted as the anthem of the Bernese Republic. It is now normally performed in the instrumental version, because the [[Bernese German]] lyrics are not widely known and no French lyrics exist.

== Lyrics ==
The following is the most frequently reproduced version of the traditional Bernese German lyrics, complemented with a [[Standard German]] and English translation by the authors of this article.

An older variant of the text replaces "Stark und frey in Not und G'fahre" in the first stanza with "Die, wo z'Fuess und z'Sattel fahre" ("Those on foot and those in the saddle").

The '''Botswana People's Party''' (BPP) was formed as the '''Bechuanaland People's Party''' during [[Botswana|Botswana's]] colonial era, in December 1960. As a result of disappointment with the Legislative Council, under the leadership of Kgalemang T. Motsete, an accomplished music composer and educationist, BPP became the first mass party to agitate for full independence.

[[Motsamai Mpho]], who had been tried for treason under the [[Union of South Africa]] Terrorism Act, was the secretary general. Internal dissension during the first national elections in 1965 resulted in a schism and the birth of the [[Botswana Independence Party|Bechuanaland Independence Party]] (now Botswana Independence Party) under Mpho's leadership. Motsete attempted to retain a small group of the BPP's old guard but lost power to Phillip Matante. The first general elections were held in March 1965, and the Bechuanaland Democratic Party (now [[Botswana Democratic Party]]) won a landslide victory, taking 28 of the 31 contested seats. BPP  won three seats.

==History==
The party was formed in 1960 as the Bechuanaland People's Party under the leadership of Motsete, Matante and Mpho.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eisa.org.za/wep/bot1965overview.htm|title=EISA Botswana: Political party formation and independence (1958-1966)|website=www.eisa.org.za|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party's formation was indirectly stimulated by the flow of South African exiles following the [[Sharpeville massacre]] in March 1960. The party's structure was based on the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), but infighting quickly plagued the party. The party became an opposition party to the traditionalist [[Botswana Democratic Party]], then led by [[Seretse Khama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://goddard40.clarku.edu:2069/stable/pdfplus/158757.pdf The New States of Southern Africa by J.T. Spence in The Journal of Modern African Studies, December 1967]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; .

Motsete had political exposure and influence from the [[Pan-Africanism]] and South African political liberation movements, namely the ANC and the [[Pan-African Congress|Pan African Congress]] (PAC). [[Kwame Nkruma]] and [[Ghana|Ghanaian independence]] further influenced the BPP. The main objective of the party was to liberate the people of the [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]] from colonialism; this objective was achieved in September 1966 when the country became independent.

Matante was the first president of BPP. He became the first member of [[Parliament of Botswana|parliament]] for [[Francistown]] and the leader of the opposition during independence in 1966. Matante's death created a power vacuum that led to the reversal of many of the gains that the party had made. In the 2014 general elections the BPP was granted six northern constituencies under the [[Umbrella for Democratic Change]] (UDC), as the north had historically been a BPP stronghold, but lost each one of them. The party's goal became to rebrand for the 2019 elections by establishing youth structures and regaining interest in the party under the leadership of president Mbaakanyi Smart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.botswanaguardian.co.bw/northern-extra/item/1458-bpp-youth-vow-to-rebrand-their-party.html|title=BPP Youth vow to rebrand their party - Botswana Guardian|last=correspondent|first=Kushatha Tabengwa - NE|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

BPP always advocated for opposition unity. In 1989, they had a working relationship with the now defunct Botswana Progressive Party. They were part of the [[Botswana Alliance Movement]] and PACT and joined the UDC. However, BPP continues to advocate for a complete merger of opposition parties, primarily because these pacts have proved to be fragile and prone to defections. Their #RonaKoBPP social media hash tag received recognition across social media platforms.

The party held its 50th elective congress under the theme "Proud of the Past, Confident of the Future", where a new National Executive Committee was elected. For the first time it included people from all parts of the country in an attempt to nationalize the party, weakening the perception that the BPP serves only Botswana in the north.

==Principles==
BPPs principles are: 
* promotion of unity on the basis of equality for all [[Ethnic groups in Botswana|ethnic]] and/or [[Language family|language groups]] in a democratic state with no social, economic, racial, tribal or religious discrimination; 
* well-being and quality of life; 
* proper use of land and minerals identified as the common property of all in the motherland; 
* provision of work and conditions of work that ensure high levels of productivity and happiness for all; 
* right to life, liberty, security and equality before the law; 
* freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly in social, economic, political and cultural life; 
* freedom of worship

The BPP motto is "Lefatshe la Rona", "Shango Yedu", and "Ilizwe nge lethu!"

'''Budget support''' is a particular way of giving international [[development aid]], also known as an aid instrument or aid modality.  With budget support, money is given directly to a recipient country government, usually from a donor government.  Budget support differs from other types of aid modalities such as:
# [[Balance of payments support]], which is currently mainly the domain of the [[International Monetary Fund]].  With balance of payments support the funds go to the central bank for foreign exchange purposes, while with budget support they generally go to the Ministry of Finance (or equivalent) and into the budget for public spending.
# [[Project aid]], where development assistance funds are used by donors to implement a specific project, with donors retaining control of the project's financing and management.

In practice, budget support varies dramatically and is done in a large range of different ways.  One of the broadest distinctions is between general budget support and sector budget support.

'''General budget support''' is unearmarked contributions to the government budget including funding to support the implementation of macroeconomic reforms (structural adjustment programmes, poverty reduction strategies).

Budget support is a method of financing a recipient country’s budget through a transfer of resources from an external financing agency to the recipient government’s national treasury. The funds thus transferred are managed in accordance with the recipient’s budgetary procedures.

Funds transferred to the national treasury for financing programmes or projects managed according to different budgetary procedures from those of the recipient country, with the intention of earmarking the resources for specific uses, are therefore excluded.

'''Sector budget support''', like general budget support, is an un earmarked financial contribution to a recipient government’s budget. However, in sector budget support, the dialogue between donors and partner governments focuses on sector-specific concerns, rather than on overall policy and budget priorities.&lt;ref&gt;OECD DAC&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rationale for budget support ==

The underlying rationale for budget support is variously seen as:

a) Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI) describe how highly fragmented, ad hoc, small projects were not delivering results and cumulatively may have been undermining aid agencies' own objectives.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Lawson, Andrew, David Booth, Alan Harding, David Hoole and Felix Naschold (2002) [https://archive.is/20121224030708/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=3716&amp;title=general-budget-support General Budget Support Evaluability Study: Phase 1 - Final Synthesis Report]. London: Overseas Development Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is some evidence that the effect of ad hoc, small projects is not systematic, but there is a wide range of individual evaluations of project  as well as some more meta-review data such as Wapenhans report (1992) and ‘Assessing Aid’ (1998).&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Thus the ODI highlights the following benefits:&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;
* High transactions costs from the multiplicity of different reporting and accounting requirements, including tied aid;
* Inefficient spending dictated by donor priorities and procurement arrangements;
* Undermining of state systems through the special staffing arrangements and parallel structures;
* Corrosion of democratic accountability as mechanisms are designed to satisfy donor rather than domestic constituencies;
* Hard to sustain positive impact beyond the short term, with high level of reliance on donor funding which undermined sustainability;
* Corruption, fraud and rent-seeking were also a feature of the management of projects and not overcome by their independence from government control.

b) that building recipient government capacity and accountability to their own populations for service delivery, as the only sustainable way of reducing poverty in the long term. Evidence is scarce, since it is hard to tell what level and type of effect budget support is or even could have on these long term and highly political processes.  The findings of the largest review to date are over all positive.  For more information, see the 8-country evaluation of GBS (1994-2004), 4-page summary: http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/16/63/37421292.pdf

In practice the other types of aid instruments are still running concomitantly which means the potential expressed in the underlying rationale is unlikely to be fully tested.

== Risks ==

The risks for donor governments and recipient governments are very different.  The literature describes a range some of which are summarised below.

For the donor government the risks include:
# Political risk of a recipient government doing something high profile and unpalatable
# Fiduciary risk of putting resources into weak systems or supporting poor policies (but this is partly the point of budget support also). This type of risk includes that of corruption in the recipient government.
# Loss of profile- donors tend to like to be able to report on specific outputs that they are responsible for, which is not possible with budget support

For the recipient government the risks include:
# Much greater levels of intrusion by donors in your budget process
# Reduced levels of flexibility about the allocation of resources, which with time may undermine the incentives for improving the efficiency of public spending
# Increased volatility and unpredictability of aid flows
# Increased vulnerability to ‘aid shocks’ if donors decided to withdraw funding

'''''Bus''''' ({{lang-bg|Рейс}}) is a 1980 satirical play by Bulgarian playwright [[Stanislav Stratiev]]. It premiered at [[Sofia]]'s [[Satirical Theatre]] om March 29, 1980. In 2007, the play was presented at the festival in [[Avignon]], France in the French title of ''L' Autobus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://editions-agapante.com/avignon-2007.html|title=Avignon 2007|publisher=Editions-agapante.com|accessdate=15 May 2015|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Nine people are traveling on a public bus to the city center, but the bus suddenly deviates from its route. Passengers begin to realize that they will never get to where they are going. Fear, panic and terror turn them into transparent humanoid mass. The play then deals with questions facing humanity as they face their impending doom.

'''"Como tudo começou"''' ("How everything began") was the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999]], performed in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] by [[Rui Bandeira]].

The song is a ballad, with Bandeira lamenting the end of a relationship. From the lyrics, it seems that he inadvertently caused this to happen. He begs his lover not to leave him, but ultimately appears resigned to his fate.

The song was performed sixteenth on the night (following [[Sweden]]'s [[Charlotte Nilsson]] with "[[Take Me To Your Heaven]]" and preceding [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s [[The Mullans]] with "[[When You Need Me (The Mullans song)|When You Need Me]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 12 points (all from [[France]]), placing 21st in a field of 23.

Due to the rapidly expanding size of the Contest, the decision was taken to restrict participation in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000 contest]] to those countries with the best average results over the previous 5 years, a group which did not include Portugal. As a country broadcasting but not entering that Contest (a so-called "passive participant"), Portugal was re-admitted in the following year. Thus, the song was succeeded as [[Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest|Portuguese representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001|2001 Contest]] by [[MTM (band)|MTM]] with "[[Só sei ser feliz assim]]".

The '''Conseil national de la Résistance''' ('''CNR''') was an underground French [[nationalist]] [[militant]] organization, founded 20 May 1962 in Rome. It was named after the 1943 ''[[Conseil national de la Résistance]]'' [[French resistance]] organization. It was dissolved in 1963, when [[Antoine Argoud]] was arrested by the French secret service in [[Munich]], charged with the attempted [[assassination]] of French [[President of France|president]] [[Charles de Gaulle]], and several of the other members went into exile, facing charges from the government. In 1968, a general amnesty was issued, Argoud was released from prison, and several of the former CNR members returned to France, some even returning to public life.

The Economic Vulnerability Index is a composition of the following eight indicators&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/cdp/ldc/ldc_criteria.shtml UNDESA : LDC Criteria]&lt;/ref&gt;: 1) [[population]] size, 2) remoteness, 3) merchandise [[export]] concentration, 4) share of [[agriculture]], [[forestry]] and [[Fishery|fisheries]] in [[gross domestic product]], 5) [[homelessness]] owing to [[natural disaster]]s, 6) instability of agricultural production, and 7) instability of exports of goods and services, 8) the share of population living in low elevated coastal zone.

The other criteria used to classify countries as least developed are: [[Gross national income]] per capita and the Human Asset Index.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/policy/devplan/profile/criteria.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, only low-income countries with population smaller than 75 million inhabitants can be considered for inclusion in the category.

Retrospective series have been also calculated for 1990–2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ferdi.fr/en/node/899 Ferdi]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is considered part of the personal assets of the owner, who holds the full juridical and economic [[Legal liability|liability]] of the company. The sole proprietorship entity holds a number of advantages, such as that there is no minimum [[Shareholders' equity|equity]], requirements for [[auditing]] or registration fee at the [[Brønnøysund Register Centre]]. Sole proprietorships do not have to have the two or three letter corresponding company type in the official company name. Instead they are required to have the [[surname]] of the proprietor somewhere in the company name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bedin.no/php/d_emneside_eng/cf/hApp_102/hPKey_1613/hParent_17/hDKey_2 | title=Self-employed Business | publisher=Ministry of Trade and Industry | date=3 March 2008 | accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gabreta Forest''' is an ancient forest mentioned by the Greek geographers, [[Strabo]] and [[Ptolemy]]. In the former it is termed the ''hule megale Gabreta'', or "large wood, Gabreta" (Book 7, Chapter 1, Section 5), and in the latter, ''hule Gabreta'', "Gabreta Wood" (Book 2 Chapter 10). It was located in the country of the [[Marcomanni]] and [[Quadi]], south of the [[Sudetes]], which identifies it with today's [[Bohemian Forest|Šumava]] mountains straddling the border between [[Czech Republic]] and [[Bavaria]]. The name is believed to be [[Celt]]ic, as the region is part of [[Bohemia]], from which the Marcomanni and Quadi had driven the Celtic [[Boii]] not long before.{{when?|Before what??|date=February 2015}} One derivation yields ''woody mountain''.{{whose?|Derivation offered by whom?|date=February 2015}}

'''Intelsat K''' (later termed '''Satcom K4''' and '''NSS-K''') was a geostationary communication satellite built by [[Lockheed Martin]]. It was located at orbital position of 21.5 degrees east longitude and was owned by [[SES World Skies]]. The satellite was based on the AS-5000 platform and its life expectancy was 10 years. He retired from service in August 2002 and was transferred to a [[graveyard orbit]].

The satellite was purchased from Intelsat by New Skies and renamed to NSS-K. He is also the former Satom K4 of GE Americom. The satellite was successfully launched into space on June 10, 1992, by means of an [[Atlas-Centaur]] from the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], [[United States]]. It had a launch mass of 2836&amp;nbsp;kg. It was equipped with 16 [[Ku band]] transponders.&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, Gunter. [http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/intelsat-k.htm Intelsat K /NSS K].

The '''Mashriq''' ({{lang-ar|مَـشْـرِق}}, also '''Mashreq''', '''Mashrek''') is the [[historical region]] of the [[Arab world]] to the east of [[Egypt]] (sometimes including Egypt and Sudan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=bank |first1=world |title=Economic interrogation in the mashriq |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTMENA/Resources/MashreqStudypub.pdf |website=siteresources}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comprises the modern states of Egypt, [[Sudan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Yemen]], [[Oman]], [[Kuwait]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], and [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mashriq GEOGRAPHICAL REGION, MIDDLE EAST|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Mashriq|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceps.be/book/european-neighbourhood-policy-mashreq-countries-enhancing-prospects-reform |title=European Neighbourhood Policy in the Mashreq Countries: Enhancing Prospects for Reform |date=2005-09-01 |publisher=Centre for European Policy Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mei.edu/content/introduction-migration-and-mashreq-0 Introduction to Migration and the Mashreq] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203011216/http://www.mei.edu/content/introduction-migration-and-mashreq-0 |date=February 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmvs.org/documentos/IOM_EMM/resources/IOM_MagMash.pdf |title=Migrants from the Maghreb and Mashreq Countries |publisher=IOM International Organization for Migration |date=July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poetically the "place of sunrise", the name is derived from the verb ''sharaqa'' ({{lang-ar|شرق}} "to shine, illuminate, radiate" and "to rise"), referring to the east, where the sun rises.&lt;ref name="Shushtarī2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alvarez|first=Lourdes María|title=Abu Al-Ḥasan Al-Shushtarī|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=atDKUFnFAKMC&amp;pg=PA157|year=2009|publisher=Paulist Press|isbn=978-0-8091-0582-3|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peek|first1=Philip M.|last2=Yankah|first2=Kwesi|title=African Folklore: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SmmUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA442|date=2003-12-12|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-94873-3|page=442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
As the word ''Mashriq'' refers to countries bounded between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Iran]], it is the companion term to ''[[Maghreb]]'' ({{lang-ar|مَـغْـرِب}}), the western part of [[North Africa]]. Egypt occupies an ambiguous position: while it has cultural, ethnic and linguistic ties to both the Mashriq and the Maghreb, it is different from both, and is usually seen as being part of neither; however, when it is grouped with one or the other, it is generally considered as a part of the Mashriq, due to its closer ties to the [[Levant]]. Egypt and the Levant were often ruled as a single unit, as under the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]], the [[Ayyubid dynasty]], the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]], and for a time, under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]]. Similarly, Libya may itself be seen as bifurcated between Mashriq and Maghreb influences, with its eastern part ([[Cyrenaica]]) seen as linked more to Egypt and the Mashriq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gall|first1=Michel Le|last2=Perkins|first2=Kenneth|title=The Maghrib in Question: Essays in History and Historiography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mGzKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|year=2010|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-78838-1|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These geographical terms date from the early Islamic expansion. This region is similar to the [[Bilad al-Sham]] and [[Mesopotamia]]n regions combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clancy-Smith|first=Julia|title=North Africa, Islam and the Mediterranean World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=seH9AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98|date=2013-11-05|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-31213-8|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2014}}, the Mashriq is home to 1.7% of the global population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capmas.gov.eg/pdf/EgyptInFigure/EgyptinFigures/Tables/English/pop/population/index.html Official estimate of the Population of Egypt] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525221856/http://www.capmas.gov.eg/pdf/EgyptInFigure/EgyptinFigures/Tables/English/pop/population/index.html |date=May 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UN estimate for Lebanon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dos.gov.jo/dos_home_e/main/index.htm Official Jordanian population clock] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117225318/http://www.dos.gov.jo/dos_home_e/main/index.htm |date=January 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Main Statistical Indicators |url=http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/DesktopDefault.aspx?lang=en |publisher=State of Palestine – Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UN estimate for Syria&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.worldbank.org/country/iraq |publisher=The World Bank |title=Iraq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Miodio''' is a band that consists of three Italian and two Sammarinese members. They represented [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2008|San Marino]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008]], performing the song [[Complice]]. This was the first time San Marino had entered the competition.  They failied to get past the first semi-final on May 20, only receiving 5 points and placing last of 19.

Miodio was founded in the winter of 2002, and they have published a mini-album with 5 tracks.
This album was produced by the label "Acanto" owned by the producer and composer Andrea Felli. In 2007 they entered into an exclusive contract with Opera Prima, a record label, releasing their first single "It's Ok", which is still played by more than a hundred national radio stations. The song has been also included in the soundtrack of the movie "Il Soffio dell'Anima" and is listed in the iTunes Store.

The group was selected by an internal jury, after applying through an open invitation for entrants to represent San Marino.

Miodio are the winners of the 17th edition of San Marino Festival as well as the winners of the prize 'Viva Music' and 'Best Original Song' at the 2006 Arts Festival in Bologna. They also represented San Marino at the 12th Biennial of Young Artists of Europe held in Naples, where the band presented a 30-minute filmshot, edited and produced by themselves and praised by an international jury.

The band was slated to record their first proper album containing eleven tracks, which was to be released in the summer of 2008, however nothing has materialised as yet.

In 2009 Miodio released the single [[Evoluzione Genetica]] which they performed at Wind Music Awards 2009.

Late in 2009 they entered the revamped Newcomers' section of 2010 [[Festival della canzone italiana]], with the new single called "Perdo contatto".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rai.tv/dl/RaiTV/programmi/media/ContentItem-d30793a0-7619-4ced-a984-b05cb84875b8.html?p=7|title=Rai.tv - Sanremo Festival 2010|accessdate=2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in English: Lose contact).

==Eurovision Song Contest 2008==
In 2008, Miodio was announced as [[San Marino]]'s first participants at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008 contest]]. They were selected internally by Sammarinese broadcaster [[San Marino RTV]] with their song [[Complice]], written by band members Francesco Sancisi and [[Nicola Della Valle]]. They participated in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]], at the first semi-final against 18 other countries. They, however, only received 5 points and finished last (19th) in the first semi-final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/event/artistdetail?song=24497&amp;event=1468|title=Eurovision Song Contest - Moscow 2009|accessdate=2009-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Italo-Romanian Cultural and Economic Movement''' ({{lang-ro|Mișcarea Națională Culturală și Economică Italo-Română}}) or '''National Italo-Romanian Fascist Movement''' ({{lang|ro|Mișcarea Națională Fascistă Italo-Română}}) was a short-lived [[Fascism|Fascist]] movement active in [[Romania]] during the early 1920s.

The movement was formed in 1921 by [[Elena Bacaloglu]], a female journalist who had an [[Italy|Italian]] husband at the time, and was an acquaintance of [[Benito Mussolini]] (she had been briefly the wife of [[Ovid Densusianu]]). The group deliberately mimicked [[Italian fascism]] and stressed the close ethnic bonds between the [[Italian people|Italians]] and the [[Romanians]].&lt;ref&gt;RJB Bosworth, ''The Oxford Handbook of Fascism'', Oxford University Press, p. 402&lt;/ref&gt; The group attracted only around 100 members.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Passmore, ''Women, Gender and Fascism in Europe, 1919-45'', Manchester University Press, 2003, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; The group was based in [[Cluj]], where it was initially established.&lt;ref&gt;Radu Ioanid, ''The sword of the archangel: fascist ideology in Romania'', East European Monographs, 1990, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; It was wound up in 1923, when it merged with the [[National Romanian Fascia]] to form the [[National Fascist Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hist.academic.claremontmckenna.edu/jpetropoulos/ironguard/chronology.htm Chronology of Romanian Fascism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124060223/http://hist.academic.claremontmckenna.edu/jpetropoulos/ironguard/chronology.htm |date=2005-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2677">'''National Public Prosecutor's Office''' ({{lang-pl|Prokuratura Krajowa}}, sometimes also translated as ''State Prosecutor's Office'') is the highest civil organizational unit in [[Poland]]'s [[Prosecutor]]'s offices. It's directed by National Public Prosecutor (''Prokurator Krajowy''). National Public Prosecutor is the second highest prosecutor office in Poland (after [[Public Prosecutor General (Poland)|Public Prosecutor General]]).

In 2010 the '''National Public Prosecutor's Office''' was replaced by the '''General Public Prosecutor's Office''' (''Prokuratura Generalna''). The title "Public Prosecutor General", however, is still reserved for the one who supervises all other prosecutors (the difference is that he is now elected from independent candidates, and no longer a governmental minister).

In 2016, the '''National Public Prosecutor's Office''' was reinstated under the act of January 28, replacing the former '''General Public Prosecutor's Office'''. The office of the Public Prosecutor General is again combined with the office of the Polish Minister of Justice, while the National Public Prosecutor is the head of the National Public Prosecutor's Office and acts as the vice Public Prosecutor General.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dziennikustaw.gov.pl/D2016000017701.pdf|title=DZIENNIK USTAW 2016 R.

An '''Olympic Congress''' is a large gathering of representatives from the different constituencies of the Olympic Movement, organised by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC). As detailed in chapter 1, rule 4 of the [[Olympic Charter]], the IOC President is responsible for convening a Congress, presiding over its proceedings and for determining its procedures.&lt;ref&gt;See chapter 1, Bye-Law to rule 4 (section 1) of the Olympic Charter, {{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/missions/charter_uk.asp |accessdate=July 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080717135528/http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/missions/charter_uk.asp |archivedate=July 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Olympic Congresses are not regular events in the IOC’s calendar. As the Olympic Charter states, "The Olympic Congress gathers representatives of the constituents of the Olympic Movement, at intervals determined by the IOC".&lt;ref&gt;See chapter 1, Rule 4 of the Olympic Charter, {{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/missions/charter_uk.asp |accessdate=July 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080717135528/http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/missions/charter_uk.asp |archivedate=July 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the role of an Olympic Congress is consultative, all recommendations from the Congress must be submitted to the IOC Session for formal adoption. The first Olympic Congress was held in [[Paris]], France in 1894. It was this Congress which founded and established the IOC and laid the groundwork for its statutes. The process of revival of the Olympic Games also began at the Paris Congress of 1894.

After 1894, and until 1930, there were eight Congresses covering various issues related to the burgeoning Olympic Movement.  The last Congress before the Second World War was held in [[Berlin]] in 1930. After this time, there was then an interruption of more than forty years until the 10th Olympic Congress was held in [[Varna]], Bulgaria in 1973. Successive Congresses were held in [[Baden-Baden]], Germany in 1981 and then in Paris, France in 1994.

== Post World War II ==
In his book entitled One Hundred Years of Olympic Congresses, Norbert Müller states that [[Pierre de Coubertin]] viewed Olympic Congresses "as intellectual guidance and justification" and "used them to unite modern sport, science, and the arts".&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Müller, One Hundred Years of Olympic Congresses 1894-1994, International Olympic Committee, Lausanne, 1994, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; But the Congresses, especially those after the Second World War, were the catalyst for some significant developments in the Olympic Movement.

=== Varna, Bulgaria 1973 ===
At the heart of the debate in Varna was the issue of amateurism. This topic featured in the discussions of nearly all the Congresses prior to 1930.  At the Congress in Varna the IOC Eligibility Commission was tasked with examining the issue of eligibility, at that time found under Rule 26 of the Olympic Charter.  The Commission’s work was brought to fruition the following year at the 75th IOC Session when delegates adopted a new eligibility rule. The new rule authorised financial and material assistance for elite sportsmen and women, but prohibited personal profit derived from a sporting activity.

=== Baden-Baden, Germany 1981 ===
The concerns of the athletes took centre place at the Congress in [[Baden-Baden]]. This was the first time that athletes played a leading role in a Congress and could express their opinions on the issues under discussion. This Congress paved the way for the creation of the IOC Athlete’s Commission, which celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2007.

=== Paris, France 1994 ===
The primary concern of the Congress in Paris was the protection of the environment. The delegates focused on developing measures to optimise the Olympic Movement’s contribution to preserving the environment.  The 1994 Congress was the first time members of the media were invited to speak and had an entire discussion theme devoted to their concerns.  It was not surprising that this Congress was later entitled "The Congress of Unity" as the event was a testimony to the good relationship among the various constituents of the Olympic Family.

== 21st century ==

=== Copenhagen, Denmark 2009 ===
In 2005, the IOC President [[Jacques Rogge]] called for the [[13th Olympic Congress]] to be scheduled for 2009. On 8 February 2006, [[Copenhagen]], Denmark was chosen as the host of the 13th Olympic Congress defeating [[Cairo]], Egypt by 59 votes to 40. With this result, no Olympic Congress has ever taken place outside of Europe.

The nine original candidate cities were: Athens (Greece), Busan (South Korea), Cairo (Egypt), Copenhagen (Denmark), Lausanne (Switzerland), Mexico City (Mexico), Riga (Latvia), Taipei (Taiwan) and Singapore. Athens was eliminated in the first round of voting and Riga in the second. Singapore lost a tie-breaker with Taipei in round three. Taipei was eliminated in the following round and Busan in the fifth round. Mexico City dropped out of the running in January 2006, followed by Lausanne a few days before the vote.

The 13th Olympic Congress was held in Copenhagen, Denmark from 3 to 5 October 2009. The theme for the Congress in 2009 was the "Olympic Movement in Society". The 121st Session of the IOC was also held in Copenhagen on 2 October 2009 where the host city of the 2016 Summer Olympics was announced to be Rio de Janeiro (Brazil).

The participants for the 13th Olympic Congress will include  IOC members, honorary and honor members; representatives of the International Federations, National Olympic Committees and organising committees of the Olympic Games; athletes and athlete support staff (coaches, doctors and medical staff); referees, judges and technical officials; the IOC’s Olympic partners; and the media. For the first time, members of the general public were invited to participate in the Olympic Congress. The recommendations from the 13th Olympic Congress will be forwarded to the 122nd IOC Session in Vancouver, Canada for adoption.

Preparations for the 13th Olympic Congress in Copenhagen got underway in 2007. In Guatemala City on July 2007, the IOC President Jacques Rogge made an official "call for contributions" to all the members of the Olympic Family. He also announced that - for the first time in the history of Olympic Congresses - the general public would be invited to express their opinions on the discussion themes.  In order to facilitate this collection of contributions from the Olympic Family and the general public, the IOC launched the Virtual Olympic Congress.

This website was an important component of the "collection phase" in the preparatory process leading to the 2009 Congress in Copenhagen. The Virtual Olympic Congress was first opened in October 2007 for contributions from members of the Olympic Family. Throughout 2008, all participants were allowed to submit a written contribution, of a thousand words or less, until the collection phase ended on 31 December 2008. A synthesis of the results will be presented to the Congress for consideration. It is hoped that this initiative will help focus the discussions in Copenhagen.

== History ==
[[RIA Novosti]] was Russia's international [[news agency]] until 2013, and it continues to be the name of a state-operated domestic Russian-language news agency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1102275.stm#media Country profile: Russia – Media], BBC News, last updated March 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 9, 2013, RIA Novosti was reorganized into a  new Russian international news agency [[Rossiya Segodnya]].&lt;ref name="PutinL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kremlin.ru/acts/19805|title=Указ о мерах по повышению эффективности деятельности государственных СМИ|publisher=[[Kremlin.ru]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dmitry Konstantinovich Kiselev|Dmitry Kiselev]], an [[anchorman]] of the [[Russia-1 (TV channel)|Russia-1]] channel was appointed to be the first president of the new agency.&lt;ref name="LentaL"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2013/12/09/ria/|title=Путин ликвидировал РИА Новости|date=December 9, 2013|newspaper=[[Lenta.ru|Lenta]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sputnik was launched on 10 November 2014 by Rossiya Segodnya, an agency owned and operated by the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]], which was created by an [[Executive Order of the President of Russia]] on December 9, 2013.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera America" /&gt; Sputnik replaces the [[RIA Novosti]] news agency and [[Voice of Russia]] (which was the [[Russia]]n government's international radio broadcasting service from 1993 until November 9, 2014) on an international stage.&lt;ref name="Sputnik orbit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/204231-sputnik-news-agency-launched/|title=Sputnik launched to news orbit: Russia's new intl media to offer alternative standpoint|work=rt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within Russia itself, however, Rossiya Segodnya continues to operate its Russian language news service under the name RIA Novosti.&lt;ref name="Sputnik orbit" /&gt; According to its chief Dmitry Kiselyov, Sputnik was intended to "provide alternative interpretations that are, undoubtedly, in demand around the world".&lt;ref name="foreignpolicy.com"/&gt;

In 2015, Sputnik announced their intention to locate the agency's new [[UK]] [[Radio studio]] in [[Scotland's]] capital [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scotland-targeted-russian-invasion-moscow-6534344#5lg6f1fwIru7fpzz.97|title=Moscow TV station Sputnik News sets up office in Edinburgh|first=Alan|last=McEwen|date=September 28, 2015|work=dailyrecord.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[News agency|agency]] subsequently established its [[Recording studio|radio studio]] and bureau in the city and launched its [[Current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] and [[news program]]me, ''World in Focus'', at a [[News conference|press conference]] on August 10, 2016.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In March 2016, access to Sputnik's online content was blocked by Turkish authorities, as well as denying the Turkish bureau chief Tural Kerimov access to the country.  The move is thought to have been in response to comments by the Russian leadership that were critical of President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] regarding the Turkish administration's record on human rights and freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sputniknews.com/agency_news/20160420/1038333566/turkey-sputnik-ban.html|title=Turkey Bans Bureau Chief of Sputnik Turkey|last=Sputnik|first=|work=sputniknews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-russia-media-idUSKCN0XC0OS|title=Russian state news agency Sputnik says site blocked in Turkey|date=April 15, 2016|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website was subsequently unblocked later that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/Default.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=102584&amp;NewsCatID=341|title=Turkey lifts ban on Russia's Sputnik news website - LOCAL|website=Hürriyet Daily News|access-date=November 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radio services ==
''Radio Sputnik'' is the audio service of the Sputnik platform operating in 30 languages "for a total of over 800 hours a day, covering over 130 cities and 34 countries on "[[FM broadcasting|FM]], [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB/DAB+]] (Digital Radio Broadcasting), [[HD Radio]], as well as mobile phones and the Internet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|publisher=Sputnik News |url=https://sputniknews.com/docs/about/index.html|accessdate=December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also available on various satellite transponders, including a 24 hour English service audible in North America via the Galaxy-19 satellite. Notable presenters on Radio Sputnik include [[Max Keiser]] and [[Stacy Herbert]], who present the weekly economics based talk show ''Double Down'';&lt;ref&gt;[https://sputniknews.com/radio_double_down/ Double Down], Sputnik, Retrieved: June 7, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugene Puryear]], who hosts the talk show ''By Any Means Necessary''; and [[liberalism|liberal]] talk radio host [[Thom Hartmann]], whose ''[[Thom Hartmann Program]]'' is [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] daily on Sputnik.

Regarding future plans for the U.S. broadcast market, the editor-in-chief of ''Sputnik U.S.'' stated in a June 2017 interview that there are no near-term plans for expansion into new markets beyond Washington, DC.&lt;ref name="dcist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dcist.com/2017/06/russian-funded_news_station_replace.php |title=Russian-Funded News Station Replaces Bluegrass on 105.5 FM |date=June 30, 2017 |website=archive.org |access-date=November 3, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630213150/http://dcist.com/2017/06/russian-funded_news_station_replace.php |archivedate=June 30, 2017 |df= }}(replaced discontinued dcist.com link)&lt;/ref&gt; This came on the heels of a late June 2017 announcement&lt;ref name="Sputnik1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sputniknews.com/agency_news/201706301055129290-sputnik-radio-dc-launch/ |title=Good Morning, America!

The American owners of the stations were required to register as a [[foreign agent]] by the [[United States Department of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-13/a-u-s-station-switched-from-bluegrass-to-radio-sputnik-and-got-threats-from-the-feds|title=A U.S. Station Switched From Bluegrass to Radio Sputnik—and Got Threats From the Feds|date=13 December 2017|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dcs-russia-funded-fm-station-expands-to-am-after-partners-register-as-foreign-agents/2017/12/01/cdf1da8c-d3a8-11e7-b7e9-7a29f2f57869_story.html|title=D.C.’s Russia-funded FM station expands to AM after partners register as foreign agents|first=Justin Wm|last=Moyer|date=1 December 2017|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sputnik cannot own an American radio station outright due to [[Federal Communications Commission]] rules against foreign ownership of broadcast assets, as enacted in the [[Communications Act of 1934]]. Prior to July 1, 2017, Radio Sputnik (initially as [[Voice of Russia|its predecessor]]) had broadcast in the Washington DC area on [[WTOP-FM|WTOP]]-HD2 (103.5-HD2) since June 2013 (if not earlier). W288BS translates [[Urban One]]'s [[WKYS]] (93.9)'s digital [[HD Radio|HD3]] signal for analog broadcasting.&lt;ref name="dcist"/&gt;

A report in ''[[The New York Times]]'' addressed Sputnik and [[RT (TV network)|RT]] as "powerful information weapons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/13/magazine/rt-sputnik-and-russias-new-theory-of-war.html?rref=collection/sectioncollection/magazine&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=magazine&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=5&amp;pgtype=sectionfront&amp;_r=0|title= RT, Sputnik and Russia’s New Theory of War: How the Kremlin built one of the most powerful information weapons of the 21st century — and why it may be impossible to stop.|last1= Rutenberg|first1= Jim|date= September 13, 2017|website= www.nytimes.com|access-date= September 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine has described Sputnik as a slick and internet-savvy outlet of [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] propaganda, which "remixes President [[Vladimir Putin]]'s brand of revanchist nationalism for an international audience... beating a predictable drum of anti-Western rhetoric".&lt;ref name="foreignpolicy.com" /&gt; Such views were also voiced by the [[Washington DC]]-based [[think tank]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cepa.org/about-cepa|title=About CEPA – CEPA|work=cepa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Center for European Policy Analysis]] (CEPA), which argues that Sputnik spreads biased information.

Propaganda in a New Orbit" /&gt; According to Kevin Rothrock, Russia editor for [[Global Voices Online|Global Voices]], Sputnik "acts as a spoiler to try and disrupt or blur information unfriendly to Russia, such as Russian troops' alleged [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|involvement in the war in Ukraine]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://qz.com/774779/russian-state-news-organization-sputnik-is-obsessed-with-ufos-and-alien-life/|title=A Russian state news organization has suddenly become obsessed with UFOs|last=Haldevang|first=Max de|access-date=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical comparisons have been made to ''[[Pravda]]'', once the official newspaper of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], in particular Sputnik's apologia for [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Denial of the Holodomor|denial of the 1932–1933 famine in Ukraine]] known as the [[Holodomor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Cathy|title=Russia Denies Stalin’s Killer Famine|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/31/russia-denies-stalin-s-killer-famine.html|accessdate=March 7, 2017|work=The Daily Beast|date=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, Sputnik misreported the contents of [[WikiLeaks]] e-mails in a story that attacked [[Hillary Clinton]]. Quotes from an article produced by [[Kurt Eichenwald]] were incorrectly attributed to [[Sidney Blumenthal]] (due to him quoting Eichenwald in an email) and taken out of context. Sputnik later took down the article.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/vladimir-putin-sidney-blumenthal-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-benghazi-sputnik-508635|title=Dear Mr. Trump, I am not Sidney Blumenthal|work=Newsweek|access-date=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The false story was recited by the then-[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee for [[President of the United States|president]] [[Donald Trump]] at one of his rallies, leading Eichenwald to accuse Trump of rebranding Russian propaganda for his own advantage. However, this has been disputed by the ''[[Washington Post]]'', stating that "It's not that Trump is a [[Putin]] [[wikt:marionette|marionette]], it's that he seems to have pulled bad information off a questionable website and presented it on live television to an audience of thousands without skepticism. This is an indictment of his judgment, not of his loyalty."&lt;ref name="WaPo Bump"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bump|first1=Philip|title=The Trump-Putin link that wasn’t|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/11/the-trump-putin-link-that-wasnt/|accessdate=December 22, 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Passanto of [[BuzzFeed News]] notes that the language used by Trump is more similar to a viral tweet from Twitter user @republic2016, which went out 4 hours before the Sputnik article appeared.&lt;ref name="WaPo Bump" /&gt;

A January 2017 report by The Swedish Institute of International Affairs found that Swedish language version of Sputnik News was one of the main tools by which the Russian government spread false information in Sweden.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/11/russia-waging-information-war-in-sweden-study-finds|title=Russia waging information war against Sweden, study finds|last=Henley|first=Jon|date=2017-01-11|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the report, Sputnik News focused on highly negative stories about NATO and the EU, in particular.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In April 2017, [[Emmanuel Macron]]'s [[French presidential election, 2017|campaign team]] banned both RT and Sputnik from campaign events. A Macron spokesperson said the two outlets showed a "systematic desire to issue fake news and false information".&lt;ref name="Emmanuel Macron’s campaign team bans Russian news outlets from events"&gt;{{citenews |title = Emmanuel Macron’s campaign team bans Russian news outlets from events|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/27/russia-emmanuel-macron-banned-news-outlets-discrimination|work = The Guardian|date = April 27, 2017|accessdate = May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 26, 2017, journalist [[Andrew Feinberg (journalist)|Andrew Feinberg]], who had been Sputnik's White House Correspondent, announced on Twitter that he would no longer be reporting for the agency, citing pressure from Sputnik's Russian editors to write stories and ask questions at the White House that implied that murdered Democratic National Committee staffer [[Seth Rich]] was killed in retaliation for leaking documents to WikiLeaks despite the lack of any evidence to support such a conclusion. In an interview with CNN's Brian Stelter, Feinberg also noted that Sputnik management had insisted on approving or dictating questions he would ask at White House press briefings, and wanted him to ask questions that implied that the April 2017 Sarin gas attack in Syria was a hoax, and that Sputnik tried to prevent reporters from having bylines to avoid accountability for falsehoods in stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/08/21/russian-propaganda-sputnik-reporter-215511|title=My Life at a Russian Propaganda Network|work=Politico|access-date=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, [[Twitter]] banned both RT and Sputnik from advertising on their social networking service amid accusations of [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]], prompting a stern response from the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Russian foreign ministry]]. It said the ban was a “gross violation” by the United States of the guarantees of free speech.“Retaliatory measures, naturally, will follow,” ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.&lt;ref name="Twitter Bans Ads From Russia Today and the Sputnik Network, Citing Election Meddling"&gt;{{cite|title = Twitter Bans Ads From Russia Today and the Sputnik Network, Citing Election Meddling|url = https://www.time.com/4999788/twitter-bans-russia-today-sputnik-ads/|publisher = Time|date = 27 October 2017|accessdate = 26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, [[Alphabet Inc.|Alphabet]] chairman [[Eric Schmidt]] announced that [[Google]] will be "deranking" stories from RT and Sputnik in response to allegations about election meddling by President Putin's government, provoking an angry response from both publications.&lt;ref name="Google to 'derank' Russia Today and Sputnik"&gt;{{cite|title = Google to 'derank' Russia Today and Sputnik|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42065644|publisher = BBC News|date = 21 November 2017|accessdate = 22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perpetuation of falsehoods and conspiracy theories===
