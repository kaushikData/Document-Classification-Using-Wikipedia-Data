{{Campaignbox Terrorism in Egypt}}

The '''2005 Sharm El Sheikh bombings''' were a series of terrorist attacks perpetrated by an [[Islamist]] organization on 23 July 2005 in the Egyptian [[resort town|resort city]] of [[Sharm El Sheikh]], located on the southern tip of the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. Eighty-eight people were killed as a result of the attacks, the majority of them Egyptians, and over 200 were injured, making the attack the deadliest terrorist action in Egypt's history, until it was surpassed by the [[2017 Sinai attack]].

The attack took place on Egypt's [[Egypt#History|Revolution Day]], a public holiday in Egypt, and was part of a strategy of hurting Egypt's economy by disrupting tourism, a major industry.

After the attacks, many arrests took place, especially of the [[Bedouin]] in the Sinai, who allegedly aided the attack, and Egypt started erecting a [[separation barrier]] around the city, cutting it off from possible attacks and the nearby Bedouin community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.walla.co.il/?w=/17/795192 |script-title=he:מצרים בונה גדר ביטחון סביב שארם א-שייח – וואלה! חדשות |publisher=News.walla.co.il |language=Hebrew |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Historically, foreign tourists have been a common target of attacks since the early 1990s. Militants have typically been motivated by a combination of [[Qutbism]] and opposition to the [[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak]] government, and attacking foreigners including non-Muslims while hurting Egypt's tourist trade was seen as serving both goals.

The most bloody attack prior to the Sharm El Sheikh attacks was the November 1997 [[November 1997 Luxor massacre|Luxor massacre]], in which 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians died. The [[2004 Sinai bombings]] killed 34 people in October in [[Taba (Egypt)|Taba]], also on the Sinai Peninsula. In the [[April 2005 Cairo terrorist attacks]] three foreign tourists were killed.

Unlike the October 2004 Taba attacks, the Sharm El Sheikh attack does not appear to have been directed in particular against Israelis, for whom Sharm is a popular destination. However, one [[Israeli Arab]] was killed and another was injured.

==Explosions==
The attacks took place in the early morning, at a time when many tourists and locals were still out at restaurants, cafés and bars. The first bomb blast took place at 1:15&amp;nbsp;am [[daylight saving time in Egypt|Egypt summer time]] (22:15 [[UTC]]) at the Old Market [[bazaar]] in downtown Sharm El Sheikh, killing 17 people, mostly Egyptians. The bomber had to abandon his truck bomb in the market because of a police roadblock. The second bomb was a truck bomb that was driven into the lobby of the [[Ghazala Gardens hotel]], a 176-room four-star establishment in the [[Naama Bay]] area, a strip of beachfront hotels some 6&amp;nbsp;km from the town centre. About 45 people died in the blast. The final bomb was hidden in a suitcase and exploded outside the [[Moevenpick Hotel]], killing six tourists.

The blasts were powerful, shaking windows miles away. Fire and smoke could be seen rising from the explosion sites.

The official government toll a few days after the attacks was put at 64, but hospitals reported that 88 people had been killed. The majority of dead and injured were [[Egyptians]]. Among those killed were 11 [[United Kingdom|Britons]], two [[Germans]], six [[Italian people|Italians]], four [[Turkish people|Turks]], one Czech, one Israeli, and one American. Other casualties, dead and injured, included foreign visitors from France, [[Kuwait]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Qatar]], Russia, and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-07/23/content_3256722.htm |title=Xinhua – English |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibility==
A group calling itself the [[Abdullah Azzam Brigades]] was the first to claim responsibility for the attacks. On a website the group stated that "holy warriors targeted the Ghazala Gardens hotel and the Old Market in Sharm El Sheikh" and claimed it has ties to [[Al-Qaeda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=East |first=Middle |url=http://www.abc.net.au/cgi-bin/common/printfriendly.pl?http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200507/s1421282.htm |title=Police question dozens over Egypt bombings. 25/07/2005. ABC News Online |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=25 July 2005 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptian government said that the bombers were Bedouin militants from the same group that carried out the [[2004 Sinai bombings]] in Taba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/01/AR2005100101293_pf.html |title=Egypt Gets Tough in Sinai in Wake of Resort Attacks |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2 October 2005 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrested suspects claimed to have been motivated by the [[War in Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Daniel |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601100&amp;sid=aAkahHyWCDoA&amp;refer=germany |title=Red Sea Resort Attacks Show Threat of 'Decentralized' Terrorism |publisher=Bloomberg |date=8 October 2006 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Garden of Pomegranates''''' is a 160-page book, written by [[Israel Regardie]] in 1931. The first edition was published in 1932. The book was printed four times, with a second edition being published in 1970 by [[Llewellyn Publications]]. The title pays homage to [[Moses ben Jacob Cordovero]]'s ''[[Pardes Rimonim]]'', or "Pomegranate Orchard."

A third edition was printed in 1999, by Llewellyn Publications. This edition includes two introductions by Regardie, and one from [[Chic Cicero|Chic]] and [[Tabatha Cicero|Sandra Tabatha Cicero]]. The third edition is also furnished with a series of annotations done by the Ciceros, and an additional 320-page [[Hermetic Qabalah|qabalistic]] textbook, titled ''Skrying On The Tree of Life''. 

Regardie dedicates the book to [[Aleister Crowley]] and identifies the text as a theoretical introduction to the foundation of the magical work of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4359">'''''Antillanité''''' is a literary and political movement developed in the 1960s that stresses the creation of a specific [[West Indian]] identity out of a multiplicity of ethnic and cultural elements.

== Background ==
From the early 1960s, a new way of envisaging [[French West Indian]] identity began to be articulated by a number of [[Martinican]] thinkers, which, in contrast to [[Négritude]]'s stress on the retention of [[Africa]]n cultural forms in the [[Caribbean]], dwelt rather on the creation, out of a multiplicity of constituent elements, of a specifically West Indian cultural configuration to which, in time, the name "Antillanité" came to be given.

It seems to have been [[René Ménil]], a former collaborator of [[Aimé Césaire]], one of the principal champions of the Négritude movement, who, in an article entitled "Problèmes d'une culture antillaise" first clearly formulated the idea of a West Indian specificity (''spécificité antillaise'') that would enjoy such success in the years that followed. 

French West Indian culture, according to Ménil, is: "neither African nor [[Chinese people|Chinese]], nor [[India]]n, nor even [[French people|French]], but ultimately West Indian.  Our culture is West Indian since, in the course of history, it has brought together and combined in an original [[syncretism]] all these elements derived from the four corners of the earth, without being any one of those elements in particular."&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Richard. "KI MOUN NOU YE? The Idea of Difference in Contemporary French West Indian Thought." ''New West Indian Guide'' 67.1 and 2 (1993), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical principles ==
Originally intended as a counter to the doctrine of Négritude, and its stress on an African rather than Caribbean identity, Antillanité was positively received by a number of prominent Martinican intellectuals, in particular the Groupe de Recherches de l'Institut Martiniquais d'Etudes headed by [[Édouard Glissant]], which published the results of its discussions on Caribbean identity in the short-lived journal ''[[Acoma (journal)|Acoma]]'' (1971–73).

Like its predecessor, Négritude, Antillanité is, at its base, an assertion of the difference in the face of the encroachments of the same.  The whole of Glissant's theoretical work may be seen as a sustained [[polemic]], conducted in the name of "le Divers," (the different) against the claims of the universal, to which a succession of derogatory epithets are attached in a more or less routine fashion.

For Glissant, "the preoccupation with the universal is the alienated reverse side of the uniquely western pretension to exercise universal control",&lt;ref&gt;Glissant, Edouard. ''Le discours antillais''. Paris: Editions de Seuil, 1981. p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; and it therefore follows that proponents of Antillanité must adopt a "firm opposition to any ideology of universal culture."&lt;ref&gt;Glissant, Edouard. ''Le discours antillais''. Paris: Editions de Seuil, 1981. p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;  Where Antillanité differs most markedly from Négritude is in its conception of the constitution of the different.  For Négritude, the different was monolithic, being essentially African in character; however, in the view of Glissant, the different is, itself, diverse, complex, and heterogeneous, made up of a multiplicity of relations held in place by a complex process of attraction and repulsion.  Thus, it could be said that while Négritude looked inwards, to African heritage, for its models and values Antillanité looked both inwards, and outwards, towards the Caribbean and [[Meso-America]] as a whole, in its quest for self-invention from which proponents conceived identity as an archipelago of signifiers, none of which enjoys primacy over the others and whose unity lies not in the fact of possessing a single source but, rather, in the complex amalgamation of these myriad forces which hold themselves in relation to each other.  One of the major advances made by Antillanité is that it has, in large measure, shed the regressive, matrocentric orientation common to both assimilationism and Négritude.

'''''AustLit: The Australian Literature Resource''''' is an internet-based collaboration between researchers and librarians from Australian universities designed to comprehensively record the history of Australian literary and story making cultures. ''AustLit'' is an encyclopaedia of Australian writers and writing.

== History ==
''AustLit'' was founded in 2000 as a resource and research infrastructure for literary studies. It has been funded by participating universities and the [[Australian Research Council]]. [[The University of Queensland]] leads the consortium. Partner universities include the [[University of New South Wales]], the [[University of Sydney]], [[Flinders University]], the [[University of Wollongong]], [[James Cook University]], and the [[University of Western Australia]]. Significant levels of research and teaching in the field are undertaken at all partner universities. 

== AustLit and research ==
''AustLit'' publishes biographical entries and brief essays on Australian writers, critics and storytellers, organisational histories relating to publishers, theatre companies and other arts organisations, and complete bibliographical histories of works of fiction and criticism. It also has an active digitisation program to generate full text versions of out-of-print literary works and critical articles about Australian literature. 

''AustLit Research Communities'' support detailed explorations of particular aspects of Australia's literary culture. Researchers can work within ''AustLit'' to create datasets around a specific field. These projects range across book, magazine and publishing histories, subject specific surveys of regionally based publishing and thematically based subsets. Research into the history of Australian popular and pulp fiction is supported alongside research into theatre history, drama and multicultural writers.&lt;ref&gt;Jacklin, Michael. "Multicultural Literature in Australian and the AustLit Database". ''InCite'' Vol. 30., No. 4., April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; ''BlackWords'' is a landmark ''AustLit'' research project that details the lives and work of [[Indigenous Australian literature|Indigenous Australian authors]], which includes [[Australian Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islander]] writers and storytellers. 

''AustLit'' has become a key information resource for the study of Australian literature and related fields. Because of its status as the most comprehensive record of a nation's publishing history, ''AustLit'' has become an important source of data for analysing Australian literary history.&lt;ref&gt;Bode, Katherine.

An '''autopen''' or '''signing machine''' is a device used for the automatic signing of a [[signature]] or [[autograph]]. Many celebrities, politicians and public figures receive hundreds of letters a day, many of which request a personal reply; this leads to a situation in which either the individual must artificially reproduce their signature or heavily limit the number of recipients who receive a personal response. Given the exact [[verisimilitude]] to the real hand signature, the use of the autopen allows for a small degree of [[wishful thinking]] and [[plausible deniability]] as to whether a famous autograph is real or reproduced, thus increasing the perception of the personal value of the signature by the lay recipient. However, known or suspected autopen signatures are also vastly less valuable as [[philography|philographic]] collectibles; legitimate hand-signed documents from individuals known to also use an autopen usually require verification and [[provenance]] to be considered valid.

The early autopens used a [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|plastic]] [[Two-dimensional space|matrix]] of the original signature which is a channel cut into an engraved plate in the shape of a wheel. A stylus driven by an electric motor followed  the [[Cartesian coordinate system|x and y axis]] of a [[profile (engineering)|profile]] or shape engraved in the plate (which is why it is called a matrix). The stylus is [[Pantograph|mechanically connected]] to an arm which can hold almost any common  writing instrument, so the favourite pen and ink can be used to suggest authenticity. The Autopen signature is made with even pressure (and indentation in the paper), which is how these machines are distinguishable from original handwriting where the pressure varies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realsig.com/Autopen.htm |title=The Autopen |publisher=The Autopen Company |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005215904/http://www.realsig.com/autopen.htm |archivedate=October 5, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern day autopens use a signature smart card or USB flash drive to store signatures and phrases instead of the plastic matrices. In addition, certain models can replicate entire pages of writing once a custom font has been created in a user's handwriting.

==History==
The first signature duplicating machines were developed by an Englishman named [[John Isaac Hawkins]]. Hawkins received a United States [[patent]] for his device in 1803. In 1804, [[Thomas Jefferson]] began using the device extensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.npr.org/2011/05/27/136717719/obama-wields-his-autopen |first= Andrea |last= Seabrook |title= Obama Wields His ... Autopen? |date= May 27, 2011  |publisher= NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; This early device was known at the time as a [[Polygraph (duplicating device)|polygraph]] (an abstracted version of the [[pantograph]]) and bears little resemblance to today's autopens in design or operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Benac |first= Nancy |agency= [[Associated Press]]|title=Obama's Signature: Is It Real Or Is It Autopenned?|url= https://news.yahoo.com/obamas-signature-real-autopenned-122724800.html |accessdate=January 5, 2013|newspaper=[[Yahoo! News]]|date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The autopen called the Robot Pen was developed in the 1930s, and became commercially available in 1937 (used as a storage unit device, similar in principle to how vinyl records store information) to record a signer's signature. A small segment of the record could be removed and stored elsewhere to prevent misuse. The machine would then be able to mass-produce a template signature when needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_toDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA657&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1933+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2mwmTqGxBtKGsgKS6czyCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwCDhk#v=onepage&amp;q=Popular%20Science%201933%20plane%20%22Popular%20Mechanics%22&amp;f=true |title= Robot Pen Copies Handwriting From A Record |journal= Popular Mechanics |date= May 1937 |page= 657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Robot Pen was commercially available, the first commercially successful autopen was developed by Robert M. De Shazo, Jr., in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://signaturemachine.com/company/about.htm |title= The Autopen: We've Been At It Since The Very Beginning |publisher= Automated Signature Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Shazo developed the technology that became the modern autopen in reference to a Request For Quote (RFQ) from the Navy, and in 1942, received an order for the machine from the Secretary of the Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Rein |first= Lisa |title= Washington’s Signature-Writing Machines Rumble Into The Digital Age |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/washingtons-signature-writing-machines-rumble-into-the-digital-age/2014/04/11/3bb38bc0-afad-11e3-a49e-76adc9210f19_story.html |accessdate= April 11, 2014 |newspaper= [[The Washington Post]]|date= April 11, 2014 |page= A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the beginning of a significant market in government for the autopen, as the machines soon ended up in the offices of members of Congress, the Senate and the Executive branches. At one point, De Shazo estimated there were more than 500 autopens in use in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=Lynne Cheney |last=Cheney |first=Lynne |title=The Autopen |url=http://signaturemachine.com/company/washingtonian.pdf |accessdate=April 11, 2014 |newspaper=[[The Washingtonian (magazine)|The Washingtonian]] |date=August 1983 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423053734/http://signaturemachine.com/company/washingtonian.pdf |archivedate=April 23, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[U.S. Justice Department]] issued a legal opinion upholding the right of the [[U.S. President]] to sign bills by autopen.&lt;ref name="DoJ2005"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/attachments/2015/05/28/op-olc-v029-p0097.pdf|title=Whether The President May Sign a Bill by Directing That His Signature Be Affixed To It|last=Nielson|first=Howard C., Jr.|date=July 7, 2005|publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]]|issue=|doi=|volume=|pmid=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019005307/https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/whether-president-may-sign-bill-directing-his-signature-be-affixed-it|format=PDF|archive-date=19 Oct 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bedsitcom''''' is a British [[Reality television#Hoaxes|reality television hoax]] series that was broadcast on [[Channel 4]] in December 2003. Pitched as "somewhere between a sitcom and a reality TV show",&lt;ref name="How real is reality TV?"/&gt; the show documented the lives of six young people living in a [[Apartment|loft flat]] in London. Its [[Narrative hook|hook]] was that its TV audience was aware that three of the participants—named Mel, Paul and Rufus—were actually actors being directed by a trio of "writers" in a garage on the ground floor.

''Bedsitcom'' was commissioned by the [[Channel Four Television Corporation]] and produced by [[Objective Productions]]. Producers auditioned thousands of people to be the show's genuine subjects and selected from them six young adults to live in the flat with the three actors. These six participants were told that they would be starring in a new reality TV series called ''Making Friends'', and featured on the show three at a time over a period of eight weeks. The programme ran for a single series of eight episodes and featured various storylines, involving dead goldfish, dodgy dealings, promiscuous mothers and telephone psychics.

The show received largely negative feedback from television reviewers, who criticised the show's premise as a "deeply offensive" idea.&lt;ref name="New low hit by reality sickcom"/&gt; It received a viewership peak of 1.2&amp;nbsp;million with its final episode, giving it an audience share of 8.9&amp;nbsp;per cent. ''Bedsitcom'' was not recommissioned for a second series and is currently not available either on DVD or on Channel&amp;nbsp;4's [[Video on demand|on demand]] service, [[4oD]].

Melanie Ash, Paul Gibbon and [[Rufus Jones (actor)|Rufus Jones]] were selected as the three actors to feature in ''Bedsitcom''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/bedsitcom/cast/ |title=Bedsitcom Cast and Crew |publisher=[[TV.com]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108155616/http://www.tv.com/shows/bedsitcom/cast/ |archivedate=8 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=12 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones had previously portrayed the part of Crispin in the 2002 drama ''[[White Teeth#Television adaptation|White Teeth]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/teeth/whos_who_credits.html|title=''White Teeth'' Cast and Credits|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]]|accessdate=9 December 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113203236/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/teeth/whos_who_credits.html|archivedate=13 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbon had played the lead role of Link in the series ''[[Stone Cold (television series)|Stone Cold]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0173255/|title=Stone Cold|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=9 December 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209074826/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0173255/|archivedate=9 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid breaking character, all three used their real names while living in the flat and went through weeks of rehearsals. O'Connor described the entire process as "exhausting".&lt;ref name="How real is reality TV?"/&gt;

To find suitable candidates to live with the three actors, producers auditioned roughly 10,000 people, who were told that they would be taking part in a new reality television programme in London called ''Making Friends''.&lt;ref name="My flatmates are acting a bit weird."&gt;{{Cite news|title=My flatmates are acting a bit weird.|first=Sarah|last=Knapton|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/My+flatmates+are+acting+a+bit+weird.-a0111642046|newspaper=[[Evening Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|location=[[Newcastle upon Tyne]]|date=26 December 2003|accessdate=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six members of the public, named Barrington, Bob, Dave, David, Jessica and Shirine, were selected to feature on the show.

===Writing and filming===
The plots for ''Bedsitcom'' were devised by a team of writers (led by Rob Gibbons, Neil Gibbons and producer Matt Crook) located in a garage on the ground floor of the apartment building that the contestants were staying in. The writers would often appear on screen and explain to the TV audience what their intention for each episode was.{{Sfn|Piper|2004|p=283}} They communicated with Ash, Gibbon and Jones either by ringing them on their mobile phones, or by calling them downstairs to speak to them in person.&lt;ref name="Mark Lawson"/&gt; They would occasionally change their plans for an episode—in "Worst Case Scenario", for example, the writers altered their storyline from having Mel bring various animals into the flat to having the group kill Mel's goldfish after only one night.&lt;ref name="How real is reality TV?"/&gt;

Among the team of writers were [[Jesse Armstrong]] and [[Sam Bain]], who had created the Channel 4 sitcom ''[[Peep Show (TV series)|Peep Show]]'' with O'Connor earlier that year, plus Rob Gibbons and Neil Gibbons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/news/the-peep-show-team-are-magicians|title=The Peep Show team are Magicians|date=11 August 2006|publisher=[[Total Film]]|accessdate=7 April 2011|quote=...&amp;nbsp;The team who make Channel 4’s Peep Show – actors Robert Webb and David Mitchell, alongside director Andrew O’Connor and writers Sam Bain and Jesse Armstrong.&amp;nbsp;...|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414184256/http://www.totalfilm.com/news/the-peep-show-team-are-magicians|archivedate=14 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming of ''Bedsitcom'' began in May 2003 and lasted for approximately eight weeks.&lt;ref name="My flatmates are acting a bit weird."/&gt; The flatmates were filmed for 12 hours a day, with this footage then being edited down to roughly 25 minutes per week of filming.&lt;ref name="How real is reality TV?"/&gt;

==Episodes==
''Bedsitcom'' documented the lives of six young adults living in a loft flat in London.&lt;ref name="Scotsman"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Live feed.

After Bob, Dave and Shirine had learnt the true nature of the show at the end of episode four, they moved out and were replaced by three new members of the public named Barrington, David and Jessica.

"Psychic Shirine{{" '}}s first caller (played by one of the writers) is particularly rude and questions her credentials.

After Bob jokingly asks for a thousand cigarettes and an expensive jacket, the flatmates are surprised when Terry delivers the goods. Shirine finds the entire situation particularly unbelievable and begins to question everything that has occurred in the flat during their time living there. The writers realise that she is close to discovering the true nature of the show, so inform the group through one of the producers that three of them are actors. The writers try to suggest that Dave has starred in the film ''[[24 Hour Party People]]'', and Rufus (actor) accuses Bob of being an actor.

He said that he felt that the premise of the show was a "great idea", but that it did not make "great television".&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt; He also remarked: "We didn't cast it right and the public didn't take to the series."&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;

===Ratings and awards===
Given the level of exposure and promotion that it had been granted, [[Channel Four Television Corporation|Channel Four]] were disappointed by ratings for ''Bedsitcom''. The pilot, shown on 8 December 2003, generated 1&amp;nbsp;million viewers, but this figure had fallen to 700,000 by 10 December. The ratings rose to 1.1&amp;nbsp;million viewers for the fourth episode, "Fag Ends".&lt;ref name="Broadcast"/&gt; On average, the series attracted an audience share of less than 6&amp;nbsp;per cent.{{Sfn|Piper|2004|p=283}} The final episode, "P.I.G", gained a viewership of 1.2&amp;nbsp;million with a market share of 8.9&amp;nbsp;per cent, which was its highest audience for the series.&lt;ref name="Broadcast"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=19 December 2003|title=Bedsitcom ends with just 1.2m|journal=[[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]]|location=[[London]]|publisher=[[International Thomson]]|editor1-first=Lisa|editor1-last=Campbell|oclc=60625607}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bedsitcom'' was nominated for a single award at the 2004 [[Rose d'Or]] festival, a European awards show that commemorates achievement in entertainment television.

The '''Black Sea Jazz Festival''' ({{lang-ka|შავი ზღვის ჯაზ-ფესტივალი}}) is an international [[jazz festival]] held annually, traditionally in July, in [[Batumi]] and nearby locations on [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]'s [[Black Sea]] coast, which, along with [[Tbilisi Jazz Festival]], is one of the country's main jazz events. 

The festival was founded in 2007. The subsequent editions broadened the scope of the festival to include rock, R&amp;B, soul, disco, funk, and hip-hop and hosted both Georgian and international performers as diverse as [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Lisa Stansfield]], [[The Prodigy]], and [[Robert Plant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Snoop Dogg, Lisa Stansfield to perform at Black Sea Jazz Festival|url=http://agenda.ge/news/32537/eng|accessdate=29 April 2016|work=Agenda.ge|date=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Quincy Jones, Lauryn Hill, Chris Brown among headliners for 2016 Black Sea Jazz Festival|url=http://agenda.ge/news/56954/eng|accessdate=29 April 2016|work=Agenda.ge|date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sun, sea and sounds at the Black Sea Jazz Festival|url=http://www.euronews.com/2015/07/30/sun-sea-and-sounds-at-the-black-sea-jazz-festival/|accessdate=29 April 2016|work=Euronews|date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Robert Plant opens Black Sea Jazz Festival in Georgia |url=http://agenda.ge/news/104391/eng |accessdate=31 July 2018 |work=Agenda.ge |date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 10th edition, held from 15 to 24 July 2016, was the largest one in the history of the Black Sea Jazz Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karsaulidze|first1=Eka|title=10th Black Sea Jazz Festival to Host Unprecedented Number of Participants|url=http://georgiatoday.ge/news/3678/10th-Black-Sea-Jazz-Festival-to-Host-Unprecedented-Number-of-Participants|accessdate=29 April 2016|work=Georgia Today|date=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A drug-related '''blackout''' is a phenomenon caused by the intake of any substance or medication in which short-term and long-term memory creation is impaired, therefore causing a complete inability to recall the past.  Blackouts are most frequently associated with [[GABAergic]] drugs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Blackouts are frequently described as having effects similar to that of [[anterograde amnesia]], in which the subject cannot recall any events after the event that caused [[amnesia]].

Research on [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] blackouts was done by [[E. M. Jellinek]] in the 1940s. Using data from a survey of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] (AA) members, he came to believe that blackouts would be a good determinant of [[alcoholism]].  However, there are conflicting views whether this is true.&lt;ref name=pmid8848460&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/0091-3057(95)00197-2 |pmid=8848460 |title=Neurosteroids block the memory-impairing effects of ethanol in mice |journal= Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=51–6 |year=1996 |last1= Melchior |first1=C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative psychological effects of an alcohol-related blackout are often worsened by those who suffer from [[anxiety disorders]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Impairment of the liver will also allow more alcohol to reach the brain and hasten the individual's blackout.

The term "blackout" can also refer to a complete loss of consciousness, or [[syncope (medicine)|syncope]].&lt;ref&gt;http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/blackout{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alcohol and long-term memory==
Various studies have also given rise to proof of links between general alcohol consumption and its effects on memory capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-5371(76)90061-X |title=Alcohol and memory: Storage and state dependency |journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=691–702 |year=1976 |last1=Parker |first1=Elizabeth S |last2=Birnbaum |first2=Isabel M |last3=Noble |first3=Ernest P }}&lt;/ref&gt;   These studies have shown in particular, how the inebriated or intoxicated individual makes poorer associations between words and objects than does the sober individual. Later blackout-specific studies have indicated that alcohol specifically impairs the brain's ability to take [[Short-term memory|short-term memories]] and experiences and transfer them to long-term memory.&lt;ref name=pmid9802525&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.1998.tb03932.x |pmid=9802525 |title=Impairment of Semantic and Figural Memory by Acute Ethanol: Age-Dependent Effects |journal=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research |volume=22 |issue=7 |pages=1437–42 |year=1998 |last1=Acheson |first1=Shawn K |last2=Stein |first2=Roy M |last3=Swartzwelder |first3=H. S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a common misconception that blackouts generally occur only in alcoholics; research suggests that individuals who engage in binge drinking, such as many college students, are often at risk as well. In a 2002 survey of college students by researchers at [[Duke University Medical Center]], 40% of those surveyed who had consumed alcohol recently reported having experienced a blackout within the preceding year.&lt;ref name=pmid12638993&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/07448480209596339 |pmid=12638993 |laysummary=https://today.duke.edu/2003/02/alcohol0203.html |laysource=DukeToday |laydate=February 12, 2003 |title=Prevalence and Correlates of Alcohol-Induced Blackouts Among College Students: Results of an E-Mail Survey |journal=Journal of American College Health |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=117–9, 122–31 |year=2002 |last1=White |first1=Aaron M |last2=Jamieson-Drake |first2=David W |last3=Swartzwelder |first3=H. Scott }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study, a sample of individuals was gathered and divided into groups based on whether they had a fragmentary blackout within the last year or not. Groups were also divided based on those who had received alcohol and those who had not. In their beverage challenge, participants were given one drink per ten minutes until the target of .08%BAC was achieved.  Drinks for the alcohol condition contained a 3:1 ratio of mixer to vodka. After 30 minutes, [[breathalyzer]] samples were recorded and recorded every 30 minutes thereafter.  In the test for narrative recall those who received alcohol and FB+(those who admitted to having a fragmentary blackout within the last year) recalled fewer narrative details after a 30-minute delay, but there were no significant interaction effects.  The next day participants were called and tested on their narrative recall and cued recall and the results were that those who consumed alcohol showed poorer 30-minute delay recall and next-day recall than those who did not consume alcohol, but there were no significant effects on cued recall of details.  Their study also revealed that those who were FB+ and consumed alcohol also performed worse on contextual recall than the other participants.&lt;ref name=pmid21497445&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2011.03.012 |pmid=21497445 |pmc=3101897 |title=Acute alcohol effects on narrative recall and contextual memory: An examination of fragmentary blackouts |journal=Addictive Behaviors |volume=36 |issue=8 |pages=886–9 |year=2011 |last1=Wetherill |first1=Reagan R |last2=Fromme |first2=Kim }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcohol impairs delayed and next-day narrative recall, but not next-day [[Recall_(memory)#Cued_recall|cued recall]] which suggests that information is available in memory but is temporarily inaccessible.  Those with a history of fragmentary blackouts also performed worse on delayed recall than those with no prior blackouts.  Neuroimaging shows that cued recall and free recall are associated with differential neural activation in distinct neural networks: sensory and conceptual.  Together, these findings suggest that the differential effects of alcohol on free and cued recalls may be a result of substance altering neural activity in conceptual rather than sensory networks.  Prior blackout experiences also appear to be related to impaired conceptual networks.&lt;ref name=pmid22420742&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.2011.01702.x |pmid=22420742 |pmc=3370058 |title=Acute Alcohol Effects on Contextual Memory BOLD Response: Differences Based on Fragmentary Blackout History |journal=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research |volume=36 |issue=6 |pages=1108–15 |year=2012 |last1=Wetherill |first1=Reagan R |last2=Schnyer |first2=David M |last3=Fromme |first3=Kim }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of blackouts==
Blackouts can generally be divided into 2 categories, "en bloc" blackouts and "fragmentary" blackouts. En bloc blackouts are classified by the inability to later recall any memories from the intoxication period, even when prompted.  These blackouts are characterized also by the ability to easily recall things that have occurred within the last 2 minutes, yet being unable to recall anything prior to this period.  As such, a person experiencing an en bloc blackout may not appear to be doing so, as they can carry on conversations or even manage to accomplish difficult feats.  It is difficult to determine the end of this type of blackout as sleep typically occurs before they end,&lt;ref name=pmid5804804&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/ajp.126.2.191 |pmid=5804804 |title=Alcoholic "Blackouts": A Review and Clinical Study of 100 Alcoholics |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=126 |issue=2 |pages=191–8 |year=1969 |last1=Goodwin |first1=Donald W |last2=Crane |first2=J. Bruce |last3=Guze |first3=Samuel B }}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is possible for an en bloc blackout to end if the sufferer has stopped drinking in the meantime.  Fragmentary blackouts are characterized by a person having the ability to recall certain events from an intoxicated period, and yet being unaware that other memories are missing until reminded of the existence of those 'gaps' in memory.  Research indicates that such fragmentary blackouts, also known as brownouts, are far more common than en bloc blackouts.&lt;ref name=pmid15083562&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1081/ADA-120029874 |pmid=15083562 |title=Experiential Aspects of Alcohol‐Induced Blackouts Among College Students |journal=The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=205–24 |year=2009 |last1=White |first1=Aaron M |last2=Signer |first2=Matthew L |last3=Kraus |first3=Courtney L |last4=Swartzwelder |first4=H. Scott }}&lt;/ref&gt; Memory impairment during acute intoxication involves dysfunction of episodic memory, a type of memory encoded with spatial and social context.  Recent studies have shown that there are multiple memory systems supported by discrete brain regions, and the acute effects of alcohol and learning and memory may result from alteration of the hippocampus and related structures on a cellular level.  A rapid increase in blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is most consistently associated with the likelihood of a blackout.  However, not all subjects experience blackouts which implies that genetic factors play a role in determining central nervous system (CNS) vulnerability to the effects of alcohol.  The former may predispose an individual to alcoholism, as altered memory function during intoxication may affect an individual’s alcohol expectancy, one may perceive positive aspects of intoxication while unintentionally ignoring the negative aspects.&lt;ref name=pmid20049223&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3390/ijerph6112783 |pmid=20049223 |pmc=2800062 |title=Alcohol-Induced Blackout |journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health |volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=2783–92 |year=2009 |last1=Lee |first1=Hamin |last2=Roh |first2=Sungwon |last3=Kim |first3=Dai Jin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Blackouts are commonly associated with the consumption of large amounts of alcohol; however, surveys of drinkers experiencing blackouts have indicated that they are not directly related to the amount of alcohol consumed. Respondents reported they frequently recalled having "drunk as much or more without memory loss," compared to instances of blacking out.&lt;ref name=pmid5804804/&gt; Subsequent research has indicated that blackouts are most likely caused by a rapid increase in a person's [[Blood alcohol content|blood-alcohol concentration]]. One study, in particular, resulted in subjects being stratified easily into two groups, those who consumed alcohol very quickly, and blacked out, and those who did not black out by drinking alcohol slowly, despite being extremely intoxicated by the end of the study.&lt;ref name=pmid5458472&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=5458472 |year=1970 |author1=Ryback |first1=R. S |title=Alcohol amnesia. Observations in seven drinking inpatient alcoholics |journal=Quarterly journal of studies on alcohol |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=616–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study hospital file data showed, that of 67 participants, 39 had reported a blackout.   The presence or absence of blackouts was cross-tabulated against various measures of alcohol problem severity.  The presence of blackouts was associated to some degree with some indications of severity such as withdrawal and loss of control, but not with duration of problem drinking, physical complications or abnormal liver function.&lt;ref name=pmid15258438&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000077696 |pmid=15258438 |title=A Comparison of Alcohol Abusers Who Have and Have Not Experienced Blackouts |journal=European Addiction Research |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=95–8 |year=2004 |last1=o'Mahony |first1=John F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of blackouts was related to some measures of severity of the problem – withdrawal symptoms and loss of control.  The hypotheses that blackouts either reflect a general vulnerability to the cerebral consequences of alcohol abuse or are associated with other forms of more enduring cognitive impairment did not receive any support.

In another study which looked at subjective responses to alcohol as a prime for 21st birthday alcohol consumption, subjective responses to the initial drink were viewed as a prime for more alcohol consumption during 21st birthday celebrations.  Current findings show that subjective responses to alcohol have direct effects on both the final BAC achieved and on the experiences of blackouts and hangover that are not explained by level of intoxication.  Where a variety of social factors, such as peer pressure and 21st birthday traditions such as 21 shots may influence the amount of alcohol people consume, their subjective experiences with alcohol have clear influences on both consumption and the physiological consequences of drinking.  These physiological responses to alcohol may have a biological vulnerability that extends beyond the dose-dependent effects of alcohol.&lt;ref name=pmid19515300&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.15288/jsad.2009.70.593 |pmid=19515300 |pmc=2696300 |title=Subjective Responses to Alcohol Prime Event-Specific Alcohol Consumption and Predict Blackouts and Hangover |journal=Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=593–600 |year=2009 |last1=Wetherill |first1=Reagan R |last2=Fromme |first2=Kim }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self reports from another study showed that 63% of patients in the study gulped their drinks rather than sipped.  Five patients recollected vomiting during the drinking episode while 32 drank on an empty stomach and 41 drank more than originally planned. During the drinking episode 31% subjects described blackouts, 20% described brownouts, and 49% reported no amnesic episode.&lt;ref name=pmid16882236&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1556-4029.2006.00161.x |pmid=16882236 |title=The Association of Alcohol-Induced Blackouts and Grayouts to Blood Alcohol Concentrations |journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=896–9 |year=2006 |last1=Perry |first1=Paul J |last2=Argo |first2=Tami R |last3=Barnett |first3=Mitchell J |last4=Liesveld |first4=Jill L |last5=Liskow |first5=Barry |last6=Hernan |first6=Jillian M |last7=Trnka |first7=Michael G |last8=Brabson |first8=Mary A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurophysiological and chemical mechanisms==
Memory disruptions by alcohol leading to blackout have been linked to inhibition of [[long-term potentiation]], particularly in the [[hippocampus]], by affecting [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid]] (GABA) and [[N-methyl-D-aspartate]] neurotransmission (''see [[Effects of alcohol on memory#Effects on nervous system|Effects of alcohol on memory]]'').

Alcohol induced blackouts are associated with the development of alcohol abuse and dependence, so it is important to consider potential neurobiological risk factors for experiencing this problem prior to onset of substance use.  Results showed that prior to beginning substance use, blackout and youth showed greater activation during inhibitory processing than nondrinkers and blackout – youth in frontal and cerebellar brain regions.  Activation during correct inhibitory responses relative to go responses in the left and middle frontal gyri at baseline predicted future blackout experience, after controlling for follow-up externalizing behaviors and lifetime alcohol consumption.  The conclusion of this study was that substance-naïve adolescents who later experience alcohol-induced blackouts show increased neural effort during inhibitory processing, as compared to adolescents who go on to drink at similar levels, but do not experience blackouts and healthy, nondrinking controls, suggesting a neurobiological vulnerability to alcohol-induced memory impairments.&lt;ref name=pmid23021773&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2012.09.003 |pmid=23021773 |pmc=3552086 |title=Atypical neural activity during inhibitory processing in substance-naïve youth who later experience alcohol-induced blackouts |journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence |volume=128 |issue=3 |pages=243–9 |year=2013 |last1=Wetherill |first1=Reagan R |last2=Castro |first2=Norma |last3=Squeglia |first3=Lindsay M |last4=Tapert |first4=Susan F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; agonist drugs==
Alcohol acts as an [[agonist]] of the [[GABAA|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; type receptor]], leading to memory disruption (''see [[Effects of alcohol on memory#Effects on nervous system|Effects of alcohol on memory]]''). [[Benzodiazepines]] (such as [[flunitrazepam]], [[midazolam]], and [[temazepam]]), [[barbiturates]] (such as [[phenobarbital]]), and other drugs which also act as [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;]] agonists, are known to cause blackouts as a result of high dose use.

==Predisposition to blackouts==
Research indicates that some users of alcohol, particularly those with a history of blackouts, are predisposed to experience blackouts more frequently than others.&lt;ref name=pmid12921196&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.15288/jsa.2003.64.547 |pmid=12921196 |title=Fragmentary and en bloc blackouts: Similarity and distinction among episodes of alcohol-induced memory loss |journal=Journal of Studies on Alcohol |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=547–50 |year=2003 |last1=Hartzler |first1=Bryan |last2=Fromme |first2=Kim }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One such study indicated a link between [[prenatal]] exposure to alcohol and vulnerability towards blackouts, in addition to the oft-cited link between this type of exposure and [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref name=pmid12695315&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.60.4.377 |pmid=12695315 |title=A 21-Year Longitudinal Analysis of the Effects of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure on Young Adult Drinking |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=377–85 |year=2003 |last1=Baer |first1=John S |last2=Sampson |first2=Paul D |last3=Barr |first3=Helen M |last4=Connor |first4=Paul D |last5=Streissguth |first5=Ann P }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, another study has indicated that there appears to be a genetic predisposition towards blacking out, suggesting that some individuals are made to be susceptible to alcohol-related amnesia.&lt;ref name=pmid14993113&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.61.3.257 |pmid=14993113 |title=Genetic Epidemiology of Alcohol-Induced Blackouts |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=257–63 |year=2004 |last1=Nelson |first1=Elliot C |last2=Heath |first2=Andrew C |last3=Bucholz |first3=Kathleen K |last4=Madden |first4=Pamela A. F |last5=Fu |first5=Qiang |last6=Knopik |first6=Valerie |last7=Lynskey |first7=Michael T |last8=Whitfield |first8=John B |last9=Statham |first9=Dixie J |last10=Martin |first10=Nicholas G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a neurobiological perspective, central serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) neurotransmission has been shown to modulate both alcohol consumption and impulsivity.  Some variations in 5-HT neurotransmission may thus contribute to a risk of AD ([[alcohol dependence]]), especially the forms of AD associated with a high level of impulsivity 2.

As the extracellular concentration of 5-HT is regulated by the activity of the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT), the gene SLC6A4 encoding this protein represents an important potential candidate gene for AD risk.  Using a meta-analysis approach, Feinn et al. found evidence for an association of the short allele of the 5-HTTLPR (SLC6A4) with AD, but the overall effect size estimated by odd ratios was found weak.  As expected in a complex condition like alcohol dependence, the disagreement in the association between AD and 5-HTTLPR likely reflects the impossibility for a single genetic determinant to explain the whole of the risk.&lt;ref name=pmid19759277&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/alcalc/agp044 |pmid=19759277 |title=Impact of Tryptophan Metabolism on the Vulnerability to Alcohol-Related Blackouts and Violent Impulsive Behaviours |journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=79–88 |year=2009 |last1=Vignau |first1=J |last2=Soichot |first2=M |last3=Imbenotte |first3=M |last4=Jacquemont |first4=M.-C |last5=Danel |first5=T |last6=Vandamme |first6=M |last7=Lhermitte |first7=M |last8=Allorge |first8=D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from chemical components which may cause a predisposition to alcohol dependence and blackouts, expectations of alcohol use may predispose drinkers toward alcoholism and blackouts.  In a study of 123 college students significant correlations were found between students’ alcohol expectancies, level of alcohol abuse, and blackout history.  The students who experienced blackouts (38.6%) had much higher positive alcohol expectancies than those without blackouts.  Positive and negative expectancies were positively correlated among the no-blackout group, but negatively correlated among the blackout group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buelow |first1=G. |last2=Harbin |first2=J. |title=The Influence of Blackouts on Alcohol Use Expectancies |journal=Journal of Alcohol and Drug Education |volume=42 |issue=1 |date=Fall 1996 |page=25 |accessdate=October 8, 2012 |url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/dde348084677ce1dd95b64633cbe8b25/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=48458 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Alcohol dependence is not prerequisite to blackouts (either en bloc or fragmentary). Students in one study who reported blackouts were demographically similar to other drinking students.  Importantly, however, students reporting blackouts drank more, and had other symptoms of alcoholic drinking, even though they did not fall into the alcoholic range on the [[Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test]] (MAST).  Half of the students reported having had a blackout during their drinking careers, which closely followed other research findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buelow |first1=G. |last2=Koeppel |first2=J. |year=1995 |title=Psychological Consequences of Alcohol Induced Blackouts among college students|journal=Journal of Alcohol and Drug Education |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=10–20
|accessdate=October 8, 2012 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1996-17468-001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study 25% of healthy college students reported being familiar with alcoholic blackouts.  51% of the students reported that they had had at least one blackout.  Blackouts were reported during activities such as spending money (27%), sexual conduct (24%), fighting (16%), vandalism (16%), unprotected intercourse (6%), and driving a car (3%).   So a significant number of students were engaged in a range of possibly hazardous activities during blackouts.&lt;ref name=pmid15704619&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15704619 |year=2004 |author1=Van Oorsouw |first1=K |title=Alcoholic blackout for criminally relevant behavior |journal=The journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=364–70 |last2=Merckelbach |first2=H |last3=Ravelli |first3=D |last4=Nijman |first4=H |last5=Mekking-Pompen |first5=I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of 545 individuals in another study, 161 (29.5%) reported driving drunk, 139 (25.5%) reported a regretted sexual situation, 67 (12.3%) reported unprotected sex, 60 (11%) reported having damaged property, 55 (10.1%) reported getting into a physical fight, and 29 (5.3%) reported injuring someone while under the influence of alcohol in the past 6 months.&lt;ref name=pmid22770825&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2012.06.004 |pmid=22770825 |pmc=3401606 |title=Trait-based affective processes in alcohol-involved "risk behaviors" |journal=Addictive Behaviors |volume=37 |issue=11 |pages=1230–9 |year=2012 |last1=Wray |first1=Tyler B |last2=Simons |first2=Jeffrey S |last3=Dvorak |first3=Robert D |last4=Gaher |first4=Raluca M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1319">The '''Bustuarii''' (sing. bustuarius) were a kind of [[gladiator]]s in [[Ancient Rome]], who fought about the ''bustum'', or pile of a deceased person, in the ceremony of his obsequies. 

At first, the practice was to sacrifice captives on the tomb, or at the bustum of their warriors: instances of which are in [[Homer]], at the obsequies of [[Patroclus]], and among the Greek tragedians. Their blood was supposed to appease the infernal gods, and render them propitious to the remains of the deceased. In later ages, this custom appeared too barbarous; and in lieu of these victims, they appointed gladiators to fight, whose blood, it was supposed, might have the same effect.

According to [[Valerius Maximus]] and [[Florus]], Marcus and Decimus, sons of [[Lucius Junius Brutus|Brutus]], were the first, at Rome, who honored the funerals of their father with spectacles of this kind, in the year of Rome 489. Some authors in the previous century claimed that the Romans borrowed this custom from the [[Etruria]]ns, though the evidence now points to Campania, and to a campanian influence and thus to a Greek borrowing since the Greeks settled in Campania since the eighth century BC.

{{Culture of Argentina}}
The '''culture of [[Argentina]]''' is as varied as the country's [[Geography of Argentina|geography]] and is composed of a mix of ethnic groups. Modern Argentine culture has been largely influenced by [[Italian people|Italian]], [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and other European immigration, although there are lesser elements of Amerindian and African influences, particularly in the fields of music and art. [[Buenos Aires]], its cultural capital, is largely characterized by both the prevalence of people of European descent, and of conscious imitation of European styles in [[Architecture of Argentina|architecture]].&lt;ref name=frommer&gt;Luongo, Michael. ''Frommer's Argentina''. Wiley Publishing, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Museums, cinemas, and galleries are abundant in all the large urban centers, as well as traditional establishments such as literary bars, or bars offering [[live music]] of a variety of genres.

Argentine writer [[Ernesto Sabato]] reflected on the nature of the culture of Argentina as follows:
{{Cquote|With the primitive Hispanic American reality fractured in [[La Plata Basin]] due to immigration, its inhabitants have come to be somewhat dual with all the dangers but also with all the advantages of that condition: because of our European roots, we deeply link the nation with the enduring values of the Old World; because of our condition of Americans we link ourselves to the rest of the continent, through the folklore of the interior and the old Castilian that unifies us, feeling somehow the vocation of the ''[[Patria Grande]]'' San Martín and Bolívar once imagined.

==Language==
{{Main|Languages of Argentina}}
{{See also|Rioplatense Spanish|List of indigenous languages in Argentina}}
The [[spoken languages]] of Argentina number at least 40, although [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is dominant. Others include native and other immigrant languages; some languages are [[Extinct languages|extinct]] and others are [[Endangered languages|endangered]], spoken by elderly people whose descendants do not speak the languages.&lt;ref name="LAR"&gt;Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005.

The most prevalent dialect is ''[[Rioplatense Spanish|Rioplatense]]'', also known as "Argentine Spanish", whose speakers are located primarily in the basin of the [[Río de la Plata]]. Argentines are amongst the few Spanish-speaking countries (like [[Uruguay]], [[Nicaragua]], [[El Salvador]], and [[Honduras]]) that almost universally use what is known as ''[[voseo]]'' — the use of the [[pronoun]] ''vos'' instead of ''tú'' (Spanish for "you").

In many of the central and north-eastern areas of the country, the “rolling r” takes on the same sound as the ll and y ('zh' - a voiced palatal fricative sound, similar to the "s" in the English pronunciation of the word "vision").

[[South Bolivian Quechua]] is a [[Quechuan language]] spoken by some 800,000 people, mostly immigrants who have arrived in the last years. There are 70,000 estimated speakers in [[Salta Province]]. The language is also known as Central Bolivian Quechua, which has six dialects. It is classified as a Quechua II language, and is referred to as Quechua IIC by linguists.&lt;ref name="LAR"/&gt;

[[Guaraní language|Guaraní]] is also spoken, mainly in the [[Mesopotamia, Argentina|Mesopotamia]], and is an official language in the province of [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romanistik.uni-mainz.de/guarani/texte/Ley5598.pdf Ley Nº 5598] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229101008/http://www.romanistik.uni-mainz.de/guarani/texte/Ley5598.pdf |date=29 February 2012 }} Poder Legislativo de Corrientes, 28 September 2004 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
{{Main|Argentine literature}}
[[File:Argentine literature.jpg|thumb|Argentine literary figures: [[Julio Cortázar]], [[Victoria Ocampo]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]] and [[Adolfo Bioy Casares]]]]
Argentina has a detailed literary history, as well as one of the region's most active publishing industries. Argentine writers have figured prominently in [[Latin American literature]], since becoming a fully united entity in the 1850s, with a strong constitution and a defined nation-building plan. The struggle between the Federalists (who favored a loose [[confederation]] of provinces based on rural conservatism) and the Unitarians (pro-liberalism and advocates of a strong central government that would encourage European immigration), set the tone for Argentine literature of the time.&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;Wilson, Jason. ''Cultural Guide to the City of Buenos Aires'. Oxford, England: Signal Books, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideological divide between gaucho epic ''[[Martín Fierro]]'' by [[José Hernández (writer)|José Hernández]], and ''Facundo''&lt;ref&gt;e-libro.net. Free digital books. {{cite web |url= http://www.e-libro.net/E-libro-viejo/gratis/facundo.pdf |title= ''Facundo'' |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090325041250/http://www.e-libro.net/E-libro-viejo/gratis/facundo.pdf |archivedate= 25 March 2009 |df= dmy-all }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(638&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]], is a great example. Hernández, a federalist, was opposed to the centralizing, modernizing, and Europeanizing tendencies. Sarmiento wrote in support of immigration as the only way to save Argentina from becoming subject to the rule of a small number of dictatorial ''[[caudillo]]'' families, arguing such immigrants would make Argentina more modern and open to Western European influences, and therefore a more prosperous society.&lt;ref&gt;Levene, Ricardo. '' A history of Argentina''. University of Noerth Carolina Press, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

Argentine literature of that period was fiercely nationalist. It was followed by the [[Modernist literature|modernist]] movement, which emerged in France in the late 19th century, and this period in turn was followed by [[vanguardism]], with [[Ricardo Güiraldes]] as an important reference. [[Jorge Luis Borges]], its most acclaimed writer, found new ways of looking at the modern world in metaphor and philosophical debate, and his influence has extended to writers all over the globe. Borges is most famous for his works in short stories, such as ''[[Ficciones]]'' and ''[[The Aleph (short story collection)|The Aleph]]''.

Some of the nation's notable writers, poets, and intellectuals include: [[Juan Bautista Alberdi]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Roberto Arlt]], [[Enrique Banchs]], [[Adolfo Bioy Casares]], [[Silvina Bullrich]], [[Eugenio Cambaceres]], [[Julio Cortázar]], [[Esteban Echeverría]], [[Leopoldo Lugones]], [[Eduardo Mallea]], [[Ezequiel Martinez Estrada|Ezequiel Martínez Estrada]], [[Tomás Eloy Martínez]], [[Victoria Ocampo]], [[Manuel Puig]], [[Ernesto Sabato]], [[Osvaldo Soriano]], [[Alfonsina Storni]], [[María Elena Walsh]] and [[Oliverio Girondo]].

Argentine painters and sculptors have a rich history, dating from both before and since the development of modern Argentina in the second half of the 19th century. Artistic production did not truly come into its own, until after the 1852 overthrow of the repressive regime of [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]]. Immigrants like [[Eduardo Schiaffino]], [[Eduardo Sívori]], [[Reynaldo Giudici]], [[Emilio Caraffa]], and [[Ernesto de la Cárcova]] left behind a realist heritage influential to this day.

[[Impressionism]] did not make itself evident among Argentine artists until after 1900, however, and never acquired the kind of following it did in [[Europe]], though it did inspire influential Argentine [[Post-impressionism|post-impressionists]] such as [[Martín Malharro]], [[Ramón Silva]], [[Cleto Ciocchini]], [[Fernando Fader]], [[Pío Collivadino]], [[Cesáreo Bernaldo de Quirós]], [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], and [[aestheticism]] continued to set the agenda in Argentine painting and sculpture, noteworthy during this era for the sudden fame of sculptor [[Lola Mora]], a student of [[Auguste Rodin]]'s.

As Lola Mora had been until she fell out of favor with local high society, monumental sculptors became in very high demand after 1900, particularly by municipal governments and wealthy families, who competed with each other in boasting the most evocative [[Mausoleum|mausolea]] for their dearly departed. Though most preferred French and Italian sculptors, work by locals [[Erminio Blotta]], [[Ángel María de Rosa]], and [[Rogelio Yrurtia]] resulted in a proliferation of soulful monuments and memorials made them immortal. Not as realist as the work of some of his ''belle-époque'' predecessors in sculpture, Yrurtia's subtle impressionism inspired Argentine students like [[Antonio Pujía]], whose internationally prized female torsos always surprise admirers with their whimsical and surreal touches, while [[Pablo Curatella Manes]]' sculptures drew from cubism.

Becoming an intellectual, as well as artistic circle, painters like [[Antonio Berni]], [[Lino Enea Spilimbergo]], and [[Juan Carlos Castagnino]] were friends as well as colleagues, going on to collaborate on masterpieces like the ceiling at the ''[[Galerias Pacifico]]'' arcade in Buenos Aires, towards 1933.

As in [[Mexico]] and elsewhere, [[muralism]] became increasingly popular among Argentine artists. Among the first to use his drab surroundings as a canvas was [[Benito Quinquela Martín]], whose vaguely cubist pastel-colored walls painted in his Buenos Aires neighborhood of [[La Boca]] during the 1920s and 1930s, have become historical monuments and Argentine cultural emblems, worldwide. [[Lithographs]], likewise, found a following in Argentina sometime after they had been made popular elsewhere. In Argentina, artists like [[Adolfo Bellocq]], used this medium to portray often harsh working conditions in Argentina's growing industrial sector, during the 1920s and 1930s. [[Antonio Seguí]], another lithographer, transferred his [[naïve]] style into murals in numerous nations, as did [[Ricardo Carpani]], though in a realist style.

The vanguard in culturally conservative Argentina, [[Futurism|futurists]] and [[Cubism|cubists]] like [[Xul Solar]] and [[Emilio Pettoruti]] earned a following as considerable as that of less abstract and more sentimental portrait and landscape painters, like [[Raúl Soldi]]. Likewise, traditional [[Abstract art|abstract]] artists such as [[Romulo Macció]], [[Anselmo Piccoli]], [[Eduardo Mac Entyre]], [[Luis Felipe Noé]], and [[Luis Seoane]] co-existed with equal appeal as the most conceptual mobile art creators such as the unpredictable [[Pérez Celis]], [[Gyula Kosice]] of the Argentine [[w:es:Movimiento Madí|Madí Movement]], and [[Marta Minujín]], one of [[Andy Warhol]]'s most esteemed fellow [[Conceptual artists]].

The emergence of avant-garde genres in Argentine sculpture also featured [[Pablo Curatella Manes]] and [[Roberto Aizenberg]], and [[Constructivism (art)|constructivists]] such as [[Nicolás García Uriburu]] and [[Leon Ferrari]], one of the world's foremost artists in his genre, today. In the 1960s and 1970s, many of these figures' abstract art found their way into popular advertising and even corporate logos.

Generally possessing a strong sentimental streak, the Argentine public's taste for [[naïve art]] and simple [[pottery]] cannot be overlooked. Since Prilidiano Pueyrredón's day, artists in the naïve vein like [[Cándido López]] have captured the absurdity of war; [[Susana Aguirre]], and [[Aniko Szabó]], the idiosyncrasies of everyday neighborhoods; [[Guillermo Roux]]'s [[watercolors]], a circus atmosphere; and [[Gato Frías]], childhood memories. Illustrator [[Florencio Molina Campos]]'s tongue-in-cheek depictions of [[gaucho]] life have endured as collectors' items.

To help showcase Argentine and Latin American art and sculpture, local developer and art collector [[Eduardo Constantini]] set aside a significant portion of his personal collection, and in 1998, began construction on Buenos Aires' first major institution specializing in works by Latin American artists. His foundation opened the [[MALBA|Buenos Aires Museum of Latin American Art]] (MALBA) in 2001.

=== Graphic arts ===

In the 1920s,  Buenos Aires was overflowing with creative drawings and design. Argentine illustrators and sketchers were attracting worldwide recognition, including artists such as [[Jose Freire Segundo]], creator of gráfica of Aikal (1940); [[Jose Luis Salinas]], called upon by [[King Features Syndicate|King Features]] to create a comic strip of worldwide fame, ''[[The Cisco Kid|Cisco Kid]]''; and [[Florencio Molina Campos]], the brilliant sketcher of the [[Alpargatas Argentina|Alpargatas]] Almanacs of rural life (1930), who collaborated on three [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney films]].

The culmination was the arrival, in 1927, of French painter, [[poster]] artist and sculptor [[Achille Mauzan|Lucien Achille Mauzan]], who was part of the artistic Art Deco movement. He settled in Buenos Aires and founded his own company ''Editorial Affiches Mauzan'' (Editorial Mauzan Posters) and created between 130 and 150 posters in the six years he spent in Argentina. He marks deeply in the poster art in Argentina,&lt;ref name="(Geniol)" &gt;[http://blogs.monografias.com/el-buenos-aires-que-se-fue/2012/05/23/geniol/ El Buenos Aires que se fue] (in Spanish).

In the 1950s renowned Uruguayan-Argentine journalist, caricaturist [[Hermenegildo Sábat]], portrayed political figures, as well as artists and other personalities. Many of his "Argentine cultural icons" are reproduced in ceramic tile in the [[Buenos Aires Underground]].

===Comics===  
{{Main|Argentine comics}}
Argentine comics were living its "[[Argentine comics#Golden Age|Golden Age]]" between the 1940s and the 1960s. [[Cartoonist]]s and comic creators have contributed prominently to national culture, including [[Alberto Breccia]], [[Dante Quinterno]], [[Oscar Conti|Oski]], [[Francisco Solano López (comics)|Francisco Solano López]], [[Horacio Altuna]], [[Guillermo Mordillo]], [[Roberto Fontanarrosa]], whose grotesque characters captured life's absurdities with quick-witted commentary, and [[Quino]], known for the soup-hating [[Mafalda]], and her [[comic strip]] gang of childhood friends,  the theorist [[Oscar Masotta]] synthesized its contributions in the development of their own models of [[Action fiction|action comics]] ([[Héctor Germán Oesterheld|Héctor Oesterheld]], [[Hugo Pratt]]), humor comics ([[Guillermo Divito|Divito]], [[Quino]]) and folkloric comics ([[Walter Ciocca]]) and the presence of four great artists ([[José Luis Salinas]], [[Arturo Pérez del Castillo]], [[Hugo Pratt]] and [[Alberto Breccia]]).&lt;ref name=Masotta&gt;[[Oscar Masotta|Masotta, Oscar]]: (1970).

===Architecture===
{{Main|Architecture of Argentina}}
{{Double image|right|Buenos Aires - Avenida de Mayo - Palacio Barolo - 2006.jpg|150|Dolfines Guaraní - Koluso.jpg|162|The [[Palacio Barolo|Barolo tower]], arguably Argentina's best-known [[Art Nouveau]] building. [[Dolfines Guaraní]] skyscrapers in [[Rosario]], the country's tallest outside [[Buenos Aires]].}}
The [[architecture of Argentina]] can be said to start at the beginning of the [[Spanish colonisation of the Americas|Spanish colonization]], though it was in the 18th century that the cities of the country reached their splendour. Cities like [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Salta]], [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], and also [[Buenos Aires]] conserved most their historical [[Spanish colonial architecture]] in spite of their urban growth.

The simplicity of the ''[[Río de la Plata|Rioplatense]]'' [[baroque style]] can be clearly appreciated in Buenos Aires, in the works of Italian architects such as André Blanqui and Antonio Masella, in the churches of [[San Ignacio Miní|San Ignacio]], [[Nuestra Señora del Pilar]], the [[Buenos Aires Cathedral|Cathedral]], and the [[Buenos Aires Cabildo|Cabildo]].

Italian and French influences increased after the [[Argentine War of Independence|war for independence]] at the beginning of the 19th century, though the academic style persisted until the first decades of the 20th century. Attempts at renovation took place during the second half of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, when the European tendencies penetrated into the country, reflected in numerous important buildings of Buenos Aires, such as the Santa Felicitam Church, by Ernesto Bunge; the [[Buenos Aires Central Post Office|Central Post Office]] and [[Supreme Court of Argentina|Palace of Justice]], by [[Norbert Maillart]]; and the [[Argentine Congress|National Congress]] and the [[Teatro Colón|Colón Opera House]], by [[Vittorio Meano]].

The architecture of the second half of the 20th century continued adapting French [[neoclassical architecture]], such as the headquarters of the [[Banco de la Nación Argentina|National Bank of Argentina]], and the [[NH Gran Hotel Provincial]], built by [[Alejandro Bustillo]], and the [[Museo de Arte Hispano Fernández Blanco]], by Martín Noel.

Numerous Argentine architects have enriched their own country's cityscapes, and in recent decades, those around the world. [[Juan Antonio Buschiazzo]] helped popularize [[Beaux-Arts architecture]], and [[Francisco Gianotti]] combined [[Art Nouveau]] with [[Italianate]] styles, each adding flair to Argentine cities during the early 20th century. [[Francisco Salamone]] and [[Viktor Sulcic|Viktor Sulĉiĉ]] left an [[Art Deco]] legacy, and [[Alejandro Bustillo]] created a prolific body of [[Rationalist architecture]]. [[Clorindo Testa]] introduced [[Brutalist architecture]] locally, [[César Pelli]]'s and [[Patricio Pouchulu]]'s [[Futurist architecture|Futurist]] creations have graced cities, worldwide. Pelli's 1980s throwbacks to the Art Deco glory of the 1920s, in particular, made him one of the world's most prestigious architects.

Argentina cities have varied architecture. Commonly each house has an individual design, and is very rare to find any [[tract housing]] neighborhood.

The industry produced actors who became the first movie stars of Argentine cinema, often tango performers such as [[Libertad Lamarque]], [[Floren Delbene]], [[Tito Lusiardo]], [[Tita Merello]], [[Roberto Escalada]], and [[Hugo del Carril]].

More recent films from the "New Wave" of cinema since the 1980s have achieved worldwide recognition, such as ''[[The Official Story]]'' ([[Best foreign film oscar]] in 1986), ''[[Man Facing Southeast]]'', ''[[A Place in the World (film)|A Place in the World]]'', ''[[Nine Queens]]'', ''[[Son of the Bride]]'', ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries (film)|The Motorcycle Diaries]]'', ''[[Iluminados por el fuego|Blessed by Fire]]'', ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'', winner of the 2009 [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], and ''[[Wild Tales (film)|Wild Tales]]''. Although rarely rivaling [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] productions in popularity, local films are released weekly, and widely followed in Argentina and internationally. A number of local films, many of which are low-budget productions, have earned prizes in cinema festivals (such as [[Cannes]]), and are promoted by events such as the [[Mar del Plata Film Festival]] and the [[Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema]].

The per capita number of screens is one of the highest in [[Latin America]], and viewing per capita is the highest in the region.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; A new generation of Argentine directors have caught the attention of critics worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/4862388.stm About Gavin Esler's Argentina diary] news.bbc.co.uk 3 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Cinema is an important facet of local culture, as well as a popular pastime, and levels of cinema attendance are comparable to those of European countries.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; Argentine composers [[Luis Enrique Bacalov|Luis Bacalov]], [[Gustavo Santaolalla]], and [[Eugenio Zanetti]] have been honored with [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] nods. [[Lalo Schifrin]] has received numerous [[Grammys]], and is best known for the ''[[Mission:Impossible]]'' theme.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Argentina}}
[[File:Por una cabeza carlos gardel.ogg|right|thumb|"[[Por una Cabeza]]", a [[Tango (music)|tango]] recorded by [[Carlos Gardel]]. Tango originated at the ending of the 19th century in the suburbs of Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;Norese, María Rosalía: ''Contextualización y análisis del tango. Sus orígenes hasta la aparición de la vanguardia''. Universidad de Salamanca, 2002 ({{Google books restricted online copy|page=6}})&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''[[Tango music|Tango]]'', the music and lyrics (often sung in a form of slang called ''[[lunfardo]]''), is Argentina's musical symbol. The [[Milonga (dance)|Milonga]] dance was a predecessor, slowly evolving into modern ''tango''. By the 1930s, tango had changed from a dance-focused music to one of lyric and poetry, with singers such as [[Carlos Gardel]], [[Hugo del Carril]], [[Roberto Goyeneche]], [[Raúl Lavié]], [[Tita Merello]], and [[Edmundo Rivero]]. The golden age of tango (1930 to mid-1950s) mirrored that of [[Jazz music|jazz]] and [[Swing music|swing]] in the United States, featuring large orchestral groups too, like the bands of [[Osvaldo Pugliese]], [[Aníbal Troilo]], [[Francisco Canaro]], [[Julio de Caro]], and [[Juan d'Arienzo]]. Incorporating [[acoustic music]] and later, synthesizers into the genre after 1955, ''[[bandoneón]]'' virtuoso [[Astor Piazzolla]] popularized [[Nuevo tango|"new tango"]] creating a more subtle, intellectual and listener-oriented trend. Today, tango enjoys worldwide popularity; ever-evolving, [[Tango music#Neo-tango|''neo-tango'']] is a global phenomenon with renowned groups like [[Tanghetto]], [[Bajofondo Tango Club|Bajofondo]], and the [[Gotan Project]].

[[File:Mercedes Sosa 2.jpg|thumb|left|Known as the "voice of the voiceless ones",&lt;ref name="tmc"&gt;[http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2007/12/08/3150199.htm Singer Mercedes Sosa: The voice of the 'voiceless ones' outlasts South American dictatorships]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mercedes Sosa]] was one of the preeminent exponents of [[nueva canción]].]]

[[Argentine rock]], called ''rock nacional'', is the most popular music among the youth. Arguably the most listened-to form of Spanish-language rock, its influence and international success are owed to a rich, uninterrupted development. Bands such as [[Soda Stereo]] or [[Sumo (band)|Sumo]], and composers like [[Charly García]], [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]], [[Fito Páez]] and [[Andrés Calamaro]] are referents of national culture. Mid-1960s Buenos Aires and Rosario were cradles of the music, and by 1970, Argentine rock was well established among middle class youth (see: [[Almendra (band)|Almendra]], [[Sui Generis]], [[Pappo]], [[Crucis (band)|Crucis]], [[Pescado Rabioso]]). [[Serú Girán]] bridged the gap into the 1980s, when Argentine bands became popular across Latin America and elsewhere ([[Enanitos Verdes]], [[Fabulosos Cadillacs]] and [[Virus (Argentine band)|Virus]]). There are many subgenres: underground, pop-oriented, and some associated with the working class ([[La Renga]], [[Divididos]], [[Hermética]], [[V8 engine|V8]] and [[Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota|Los Redonditos]]). Current popular bands include [[Babasónicos]], [[Los Auténticos Decadentes]], [[Rata Blanca]], [[Horcas]], [[Attaque 77]], [[Bersuit]], [[Los Piojos]], [[Catupecu Machu]], [[Carajo]] and [[Callejeros]].

[[European classical music]] is well represented in Argentina. Buenos Aires is home to the world-renowned [[Colón Theater]]. Classical musicians, such as [[Martha Argerich]], [[Eduardo Alonso-Crespo]], [[Daniel Barenboim]], [[Eduardo Delgado]], and [[Alberto Lysy]], and classical composers such as [[Juan José Castro]] and [[Alberto Ginastera]], and contemporary composers such as [[Osvaldo Golijov]], [[Gerardo Gandini]], and [[Oscar Edelstein]] are internationally acclaimed. All major cities in Argentina have impressive theaters or opera houses, and provincial or city orchestras. Some cities have annual events and important [[classical music]] festivals like [[Semana Musical Llao Llao]] in [[San Carlos de Bariloche]], and the multitudinous Amadeus in Buenos Aires.

Argentine [[folk music]] is uniquely vast. Beyond dozens of regional dances, a national folk style emerged in the 1930s. [[Juan Perón|Perón]]'s Argentina would give rise to [[Nueva Canción]], as artists began expressing in their music objections to political themes. [[Atahualpa Yupanqui]], the greatest Argentine [[folk musician]], and [[Mercedes Sosa]] would be defining figures in shaping Nueva Canción, gaining worldwide popularity in the process. The style found a huge reception in Chile, where it took off in the 1970s, and went on to influence the entirety of [[Latin American music]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myfavouritemusic.info/tovar42303030303938594c50.html Music: 'El Derecho de vivir en paz'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513055944/http://www.myfavouritemusic.info/tovar42303030303938594c50.html |date=13 May 2011 }} from http://www.msu.edu/~chapmanb/jara/enueva.html&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[Chango Spasiuk]] and [[Soledad Pastorutti]] have brought folk back to younger generations. [[León Gieco]]'s ''folk-rock'' bridged the gap between Argentine folklore and Argentine rock, introducing both styles to millions overseas in successive tours.

===Theatre===
{{Main|Theatre in Argentina}}
[[Buenos Aires]] is one of the world's great capitals of theater.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; The [[Teatro Colón]] is a national landmark for [[opera]] and classical performances; built at the end of the 19th century, its acoustics are considered the best in the world,&lt;ref name=frommer/&gt; and is currently undergoing a major refurbishment in order to preserve its outstanding sound characteristics, the French-romantic style, the impressive Golden Room (a minor auditorium targeted to Chamber Music performances), and the museum at the entrance. With its theatre scene of national and international caliber, [[Corrientes Avenue]] is synonymous with the art. It is thought of as ''the street that never sleeps'', and sometimes referred to as the [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] of Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adams, Fiona.|title=Culture Shock Argentina|publisher=Graphic Arts Center Publishing Company|location=Portland, Oregon|isbn=1-55868-529-4|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many great careers in acting, music, and film have begun in its many theaters. The ''[[Teatro General San Martín]]'' is one of the most prestigious, along Corrientes Avenue, and the ''[[Cervantes Theatre (Buenos Aires)|Teatro Nacional Cervantes]]'' functions as the national stage theater of Argentina. The ''[[Teatro Argentino de La Plata]]'', ''[[Teatro El Círculo|El Círculo]]'' in [[Rosario]], ''[[Teatro Independencia|Independencia]]'' in Mendoza, and ''[[Libertador Theatre|Libertador]]'' in [[Córdoba (Argentina)|Córdoba]] are also prominent. [[Griselda Gambaro]], [[Copi]], [[Roberto Cossa]], [[Marco Denevi]], [[Carlos Gorostiza]], and [[Alberto Vaccarezza]] are a few of the more prominent Argentine playwrights. [[Julio Bocca]], [[Jorge Donn]], [[José Neglia]], and [[Norma Fontenla]] are some of the great [[ballet dancers]] of the modern era.

Besides many of the [[pasta]], sausage, and dessert dishes common to continental Europe, Argentines enjoy a wide variety of Indigenous and [[Criollo people|Criollo]] creations, which include ''[[empanadas]]'' (a stuffed pastry), ''[[locro]]'' (a mixture of [[corn]], [[beans]], [[meat]], [[bacon]], [[onion]], and [[gourd]]), [[humitas]], and [[Mate (beverage)|yerba mate]], all originally indigenous Amerindian staples, the latter considered Argentina's national beverage. Other popular items include [[chorizo]] (a pork sausage), ''facturas'' ([[Viennese cuisine|Viennese-style]] pastry), [[dulce de leche]], a sort of milk [[caramel]] jam and the [[alfajor]].

The Argentine barbecue ''[[asado]]'', includes suculent types of meat, among them chorizo, [[sweetbread]], [[chitterlings]], and ''morcilla'' ([[blood sausage]]). Thin sandwiches, known as [[sandwiches de miga]], are also popular. Argentines have the highest consumption of [[red meat]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.choicesmagazine.org/2006-2/tilling/2006-2-12.htm |title=Choices Article – Modern Beef Production in Brazil and Argentina |publisher=Choicesmagazine.org |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Argentine national beach football team was one of four competitors in the first international championship for the sport, in [[Miami]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/beachsoccerworldcup/destination/history/index.html|title=History (of beach soccer)|publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association|accessdate=1 September 2009}}As of October 2009, Argentina has earned the right to play the 2010 World Cup in South Africa for which it joins Nigeria, Korea Republic and Greece for qualifying in group B.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Basketball]] is the second most popular sport; a number of basketball players play in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] and European leagues including [[Emanuel Ginóbili]], [[Andrés Nocioni]], [[Carlos Delfino]], [[Luis Scola]], [[Pablo Prigioni]], [[Juan Ignacio Sánchez]] and [[Fabricio Oberto]]. The [[Argentina national basketball team|national basketball team]] won the gold medal at the [[Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympics]] and the bronze medal in [[Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]]. Argentina is currently ranked third by the [[International Basketball Federation]].

Argentina has an important [[Rugby union in Argentina|rugby union]] team, ''"[[Argentina national rugby union team|Los Pumas]]"'', with many of its players playing in Europe. Argentina beat host nation [[France national rugby union team|France]] twice in the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]], placing them third in the competition. The Pumas are currently ranked fifth in the [[IRB World Rankings|official world rankings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/rankings/full.html |publisher=irb.com |title=World Rankings |accessdate=30 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810042746/http://www.irb.com/rankings/full.html |archivedate=10 August 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, Argentina has had a strong showing within [[Auto racing]]. [[Juan Manuel Fangio]] was five times Formula One world champion under four different teams, winning 102 of his 184 international races, and is widely ranked as the greatest driver of all time. Other distinguished racers were [[Oscar Alfredo Gálvez]], [[Juan Gálvez]], [[José Froilán González]] and [[Carlos Reutemann]].

[[Field hockey]] with the [[Argentina women's national field hockey team|national team ''Las Leonas'']] is one of the world's most successful, with four Olympic medals, two [[Women's Hockey World Cup|World Cups]], a [[FIH Hockey World League|World League]] and seven [[Hockey Champions Trophy|Champions Trophy]].{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=11}} [[Luciana Aymar]] is recognized as the best female player in the history of this sport.

Argentina reigns undisputed in [[Polo]], having won more international championships than any other country and been seldom beaten since the 1930s.{{sfn|Aeberhard|Benson|Phillips|2000|pp=50–51}} The [[Campeonato Argentino Abierto de Polo|Argentine Polo Championship]] is the sport's most important international team trophy. The country is home to most of the world's top players, among them [[Adolfo Cambiaso]], the best in Polo history.

Other popular sports include [[tennis]], [[Team handball|handball]], [[boxing]], [[volleyball]] and [[golf]].

The [[Vamos vamos Argentina]] chant is a trademark of Argentine fans during sporting events.

In [[economics]], a '''demerit good''' is "a [[Good (economics and accounting)|good]] or [[Service (economics)|service]] whose consumption is considered unhealthy, degrading, or otherwise socially undesirable due to the perceived negative effects on the consumers themselves".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/d/demerit-good%20/ |title=Demerit Good Law &amp; Legal Definition |website=USLegal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/demerit-good.html |title=Definition of demerit good |website=BusinessDictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/glossary/demerit-goods/ |title=Demerit good definition |last=Pettinger |first= Tejvan  |date=November 28, 2012 |website=Economics Help}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is over-consumed if left to market forces. Examples of demerit goods include [[tobacco]], [[alcoholic beverage]]s, [[recreational drugs]], [[gambling]], [[junk food]] and [[prostitution]]. Because of the nature of these goods, [[government]]s often levy [[taxes]] on these goods (specifically, [[sin tax]]es), in some cases regulating or banning consumption or advertisement of these goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sanandres.esc.edu.ar/secondary/economics%20packs/microeconomics_sl/page_119.htm |title=Government responses - demerit goods |publisher=sanandres.esc.edu.ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
There is an important conceptual distinction between a demerit good and a [[negative externality]].  A negative externality occurs when the consumption of a good has measurable negative consequences on others who do not consume the good themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Market_failures/Demerit_goods.html |title=Demerit Goods |website=Economics Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pollution (due, for example, to automobile use) is the canonical example of a negative externality. Another example is cigarettes. It not only affects a deliberate or [[addiction|addicted]] smoker through damage to health, but also indirect smokers exposed to the smoke ([[second hand smoking]]). By contrast, a demerit good is viewed as undesirable because its consumption has negative effects upon the consumer. 

Two fundamental views in [[welfare economics]], [[welfarism]] and [[paternalism]], differ in their conceptual treatment of 'demerit goods'.  Simply, welfarism takes the individual's ''own'' perception of the utility of a good as the final judgement of the utility of the good for that person, and thereby disallows the concept of a 'demerit good' (while allowing the analysis of negative externalities).  As an extreme example, if a [[heroin addict]] purchases heroin, they must have done so because heroin makes them better off, and this transaction is viewed as a net social positive (assuming that the addict does not commit any other crimes as the result of their addiction).  Paternalism, on the other hand, judges that heroin "isn't good for you", and feels free to override the judgement of the addicts themselves (see 'Welfare Economics, Boadway and Bruce, Basil Blackwell 1984).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10103">'''Education policy''' consists of the principles and government policies in the educational sphere as well as the collection of laws and rules that govern the operation of [[education]] systems.

Or simply we can say that An Education Policy is a past or up to date statement or series of statements which explain, recommend or exclude a course of action or actions to be taken to run the system of education. These statements are usually written, but they could be oral. 

Education occurs in many forms for many purposes through many institutions.  Examples include [[early childhood education]], [[kindergarten]] through to 12th grade, two and four year colleges or universities, graduate and professional education, adult education and job training. Therefore, education policy can directly affect the education people engage in at all ages.

Examples of areas subject to debate in education policy, specifically from the field of schools, include school size, class size, school choice, school [[privatization]], tracking, teacher selection, education and certification, teacher pay, teaching methods, curricular content, graduation requirements, school infrastructure investment, and the values that schools are expected to uphold and model.

Issues in education policy also address problems within higher education. The Pell Institute analyzes the barriers experienced by teachers and students within community colleges and universities. These issues involve undocumented students, sex education, and federal grant aides.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Practice guidelines for the treatment of patients with eating disorders (2nd ed). Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;

Education policy analysis is the scholarly study of education policy.  It seeks to answer questions about the purpose of education, the objectives (societal and personal) that it is designed to attain, the methods for attaining them and the tools for measuring their success or failure. Research intended to inform education policy is carried out in a wide variety of institutions and in many academic disciplines.  Important researchers are affiliated with departments of [[psychology]], [[economics]], [[sociology]], and [[Developmental psychology|human development]], in addition to schools and departments of education or public policy.  Examples of education policy analysis may be found in such [[academic journal]]s as ''[[Education Policy Analysis Archives]]'' and in university policy centers such as the [[National Education Policy Center]] housed at the University of Colorado Boulder [[University of Colorado Boulder]].

== Education reform in the United States ==

[[Education reform]] is a topic that is in the mainstream currently in the United States.  Over the past 30 years, policy makers have made a steady increase at the state and federal levels of government in their involvement of US schools.  US states spend most of their budgets funding schools, whereas only a small portion of the federal budget is allocated to education.&lt;ref&gt;Coggins, C. (2017). ''How to be heard: 10 lessons teachers need to advocate for their students and profession''. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; Although states hold the constitutional right on education policy, the federal government is advancing their role by building on state and local education policies.&lt;ref name="eds.a.ebscohost.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=4c281704-1acd-4d75-a285-cc3161b5fac8%2540sessionmgr4005&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=4208|website = eds.a.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the state of Texas during the 84th Legislature, there were several education reform bills filed and sponsored by many education reform groups, such as Texans for Education Reform.  Lawmakers want to create more involvement at the local level, and more transparency in our public schools.  These groups are being pressured and opposed by teachers' unions saying that accountability and transparency policies are targeting educators, and that they are trying to hold them responsible for the education system.&lt;ref name="eds.a.ebscohost.com"/&gt;

== Teacher policy ==
Teacher policy is education policy that addresses the preparation, recruitment, and retention of teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/strengthening-education-systems/quality-framework/technical-notes/teacher-policies/|title=Teacher policies: Preparation, Recruitment and Retention of Quality Teachers/Educators|last=UNESCO|first=|date=|website=UNESCO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A teacher policy is guided by the same overall vision and essential characteristics as the wider education policy: it should be strategic, holistic, feasible, sustainable, and context-sensitive. Overall objectives and major challenges to be addressed, the funding to achieve these objectives, the demographic parameters of the learner population and the human resources required to achieve universally accessible quality education should all be addressed in a comprehensive teacher policy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002352/235272e.pdf|title=Teacher policy development guide: summary|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=14, 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nine key dimensions ===
Nine key dimensions are considered crucial to any comprehensive teacher policy: Teacher Recruitment and Retention, Teacher education (initial and continuing), Deployment, Career Structures/Paths, Teacher Employment and Working Conditions, Teach Reward and Remuneration, Teacher Standards, Teacher Accountability, and School Governance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Teacher Recruitment and Retention ====
An effective education system must have a way to attract and retain outstanding educators. There has been a growing demand for teachers but the supply continues to diminish and many of them leave their profession&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/11/27/why-its-a-big-problem-that-so-many-teachers-quit-and-what-to-do-about-it/|title=Analysis {{!}} Why it’s a big problem that so many teachers quit — and what to do about it|last=Strauss|first=Valerie|date=2017-11-27|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-06-30|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This development is a threat to the “academic and economic welfare of students.” It affects learning and drain taxpayers’ money&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/high-teacher-turnover-hurting-students-study-finds|title=High Teacher Turnover Hurting Students, Study Finds|last=Center|first=Foundation|work=Philanthropy News Digest (PND)|access-date=2018-06-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The federal and state governments along with the districts must invest in complete human capital systems. It is the best approach in preparing and retaining committed and capable mentors for the long-term&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/product/solving-teacher-shortage-brief|title=Solving the Teacher Shortage How to Attract and Retain Excellent Educators|website=Learning Policy Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A reasonable strategy in talent management for the education sector must focus on recruitment, development, and retention of intelligent and efficient teachers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.edweek.org/topschooljobs/k-12_talent_manager/2015/02/balanced_recruitment_retention.html?cmp=SOC-SHR-FB|title=7 Steps for a Balanced Recruitment AND Retention Strategy|last=Douglas|first=Emily|website=Education Week - K-12 Talent Manager|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==== Teacher Education (Initial and Continuing) ====
Teachers need to go back to school periodically to become better educators&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.goethe.de/en/spr/mag/21047328.html|title=“Continuing education must be in-depth”|work=@GI_weltweit|access-date=2018-06-30|language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Good mentors can become outstanding by going further than textbooks. This is the logic behind continuing education. Technology in the form of web-based workshops and lectures will be helpful&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://evolllution.com/opinions/the-value-of-workshops-and-continuing-education-for-teachers/|title=The Value of Workshops and Continuing Education for Teachers|date=2012-08-10|work=The EvoLLLution|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. School administrators and district officials must push their teachers to make use of available resources and opportunities to continue the learning process. Conferences with workshops are also valuable because these activities provide teachers with tools for integration of technology in the classrooms and Continuing Professional Development Units in boosting their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/stkerr/conted.html|title=Teachers' Continuing Professional Development at the University of Washington|website=faculty.washington.edu|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10422">[[File:Ozymandias.jpg|thumb|upright|A draft of ''[[Ozymandias]]'' by Percy Bysshe Shelley]]
The [[sonnet]] was a popular form of poetry during the [[Romantic period]]: [[William Wordsworth]] wrote 523 sonnets, [[John Keats]] 67, [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] 48, and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bhattacharyya |first= Arunodoy |title= The Sonnet and the Major English Romantic Poets|publisher= Firma KLM Private Limited |year= 1976 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The sonnet is a poem of fourteen lines that follows a strict [[rhyme scheme]] and specific structure, the invention of which is credited to the thirteenth century Italian poet [[Giacomo Da Lentini]], and was subsequently made famous by [[Petrarch]]. [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Thomas Wyatt]], in the early 16th century, introduced the sonnet into England. However, it was [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey|the Earl of Surrey]] who developed the rhyme scheme&amp;nbsp;– ''abab cdcd efef gg''&amp;nbsp;– which now characterizes the English or [[Shakespearean sonnet]].

[[Romantic literature in English]] includes both Shakespearean and [[Petrarchan sonnets]].

==Revival==
The sonnet has been a popular literary form since its creation, made famous by  [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Petrarch]], [[Philip Sidney]], [[Edmund Spenser]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Donne]], and [[John Milton]], but during the late 17th century and early 18th century the sonnet fell out of favor. Many sonnets were still being produced but were not as popular.&lt;ref name="Kallich 1973"/&gt; Revival began with poets like [[Thomas Edwards (poet)|Thomas Edwards]] and [[Charlotte Turner Smith]] before later including the other Romantics such as Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats and Shelley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Paula |editor1-last=Feldman |editor2-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Robinson |title=A Century of Sonnets |year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-511561-9|page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Romantic poets were influenced by all their famous predecessors, when writing sonnets, but the most important single influence was Milton, who had written less than  30 sonnets himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bhattacharyya |first= Arunodoy |title= The Sonnet and the Major English Romantic Poets |publisher= Firma KLM Private Limited |year= 1976 |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century Milton kept the sonnet form alive while also expanding the subject matter – which hitherto had mainly been love – by writing about ideas, events, history, and contemporary issues.&lt;ref name="Kallich 1973"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Martin |editor1-last=Kallich |editor2-first=Jack |editor2-last=Gray |editor3-first=Robert |editor3-last=Rodney |title=A Book of the Sonnet  |publisher=Twayne Publishers, Inc |location=New York |year= 1973 |chapter=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Milton, the Romantics wrote relatively few love sonnets and the sonnet of the Romantic era include politics, nature, friendship, art, history, religion, life and death.&lt;ref name="Feldman 1999 4"/&gt; In fact some of the Romantic poets even wrote sonnets about sonnets. Wordsworth’s ''Scorn not the Sonnet'' is an example of this. Keats also wrote about sonnets, most notably in ''On the Sonnet'' (1819), which like Wordsworth's poem defends the form in content and by using it himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kumar |first1=Nand |title=Romantic Poetry |trans-title=A Study in Satire Strain |year=1992 |publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons |location=New Delhi |isbn=81-85431-11-6 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milton especially had a strong influence on Wordsworth after he  heard his sonnets read aloud. Of sonnets he said, “Rather [I] like to employ them occasionally, tho’ I have done it much less in proportion than my great Masters, especially Milton”.&lt;ref name="Bhattacharyya 1976 8"&gt;{{cite book |last= Bhattacharyya |first= Arunodoy |title= The Sonnet and the Major English Romantic Poets |publisher= Firma KLM Private Limited |year= 1976 |page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full|date=September 2018}} Although Wordsworth wrote hundreds of sonnets, he saw himself in Milton's shadow. Wordsworth loved the sonnet form because once the simple rules were mastered he could take as much liberty as he wanted to explore topics of interest.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} He believed that poets should write sonnets to add variety to their work and keep them out of the trap of routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bhattacharyya |first= Arunodoy |title= The Sonnet and the Major English Romantic Poets |publisher= Firma KLM Private Limited |year= 1976 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sonnet form humbled many of the Romantics who are usually noted for their strong “I” assertion in lyric narratives. Coleridge too felt unsure of himself saying, “The sonnet has ever been a favourite species of composition with me; but I am conscious that I have not succeeded in it".&lt;ref name="Bhattacharyya 1976 8"/&gt;{{Full|date=September 2018}}

===Nature===
Although the Romantics wrote sonnets about a variety of subjects, the most common was nature. Petrarch also wrote many sonnets which included descriptions of nature, as did Shakespeare, but their use of nature was often incidental to the main theme relating to love or part of an analogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bhattacharyya |first= Arunodoy |title= The Sonnet and the Major English Romantic Poets |publisher= Firma KLM Private Limited |year= 1976 |page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milton moved away from nature and it is missing from many of his sonnets.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Nature, however, is the main subject of many of the Romantics sonnets.&lt;ref name="Levin 2001 xiv"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Phillis |editor1-last=Levin |title=The Penguin Book of the Sonnet |trans-title=500 Years of A Classic Tradition in English |year=2001 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |page=xiv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the sonnets and poems of the era describe the calm, beauty, power or sublimity of nature and Nature is often personified to emphasise the closeness in the relationship between people to and nature.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} In other poems an analogy is made between man and nature. For instance, in Keats’s ''[[The Human Seasons]]'', the changes of the seasons are compared with the stages of human life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bhattacharyya |first= Arunodoy |title= The Sonnet and the Major English Romantic Poets |publisher= Firma KLM Private Limited |year= 1976 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==

The two classic forms that the Romantics used the most were the [[Petrarchan sonnet]] and the [[Shakespearean sonnet]]. The Petrarchan or Italian form usually follows a rhyme scheme of abba abba cde cde. The poem is usually divided into two sections with the first eight lines, an octave, and the last six, a sestet. There is usually a turn in the poem around line nine.&lt;ref name="Feldman 1999 4"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Paula |editor1-last=Feldman |editor2-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Robinson |title=A Century of Sonnets |year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-511561-9|page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shakespearean form has a rhyme scheme of abab cdcd efef gg. The end rhyming couplet is often used to turn the idea that has been building through the poem.

The Romantics played with these forms. Since the general topic and focus of the sonnet shifted in this era, it makes sense that the form would also change to mirror the content. A sonnet like [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley’s]] ''Ozymandias'' uses neither a complete Shakespearian nor Petrarchan rhyme scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gupta | first=Sen |editor-first=Dr. James| editor-last=Hogg |title=Studies in the Romantics |publisher=Institut für Anglistik und Amerikanistik, Universität Salzburg |year=1978 |page=55 |chapter=Some Sonnets of Shelley}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pattern of ab ab ac dc ed ef ef, is no less a sonnet than those of conventional patterns. The movement away from set structures could be to mirror the feelings of detachment in the poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gupta | first=Sen |editor-first=Dr. James| editor-last=Hogg |title=Studies in the Romantics |publisher=Institut für Anglistik und Amerikanistik, Universität Salzburg |year=1978 |page=56 |chapter=Some Sonnets of Shelley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charlotte Turner Smith]] (1749 – 1806) was one of the first Romantics to bring back the use of the sonnet. She is noted for her experimentation with forms, combining In new ways the Petrarchan and Shakespearean forms, picking and choosing the best features of both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Paula |editor1-last=Feldman |editor2-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Robinson |title=A Century of Sonnets |year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-511561-9|page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her poem, "Sonnet LVI, The Captive Escaped in the Wilds of America", has end lines that turn the whole poem in a new direction using mostly near rhymes. 

The ode might seem a much more likely form for the Romantics, because it is an irregular form and adapted in many ways to the speaker and subject. These elements of the ode were often used to convey rapid changes in thoughts and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Duncan |editor1-last=Wu |title=Romanticism |trans-title=An Anthology |year=1994 |publisher=Blackwell |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-631-19196-8 |page= 165}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the sonnet form gave the Romantic poets the best of both worlds. A poem like Shelley’s "Ode to the West Wind" contains violent shifts reflecting the blowing wind, but it consists of sections made up of sonnets.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The Romantics prove with this that they could master the ways of their predecessors that they so admire and still move on to something new. The form of the sonnet helps Shelley to contain something that is uncontainable.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Following the form of [[Dante]] in his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', Shelley uses a unique [[terza rima]] pattern to create a structure like the flow of the wind, and yet  contain the poem, so there is a sense of closure at the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Stephen |editor1-last=Greenblatt |title=The Norton Anthology of English Literature |edition=8th |volume=D The Romantic Period |year=2006 |publisher=W.W.

The '''flag of [[Liechtenstein]]''' ({{lang-de|Flagge Liechtensteins}}) consists of two horizontal blue and red bands [[Charge (heraldry)|charged]] with a gold crown at the [[Glossary of vexillology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|canton]].  Adopted in 1921 after being officially enshrined into the [[Constitution of Liechtenstein|nation's constitution]], it has been the flag of the Principality of [[Liechtenstein]] since that year.  The crown was added to the flag in 1937 after the country found out at the [[1936 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics held the previous year]] that their flag was identical to the [[flag of Haiti]].

==History==
[[File:Liechtenstein schaan flags 2009-08-15.jpg|thumb|120px|When flown vertically the crown on the flag is rotated so that it always faces upwards. (The flag on the left is that of Liechtenstein)]]
Liechtenstein was formed in 1719 as a [[principality]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and gained complete independence in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Liechtenstein profile|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17536865|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=|accessdate=June 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within this period, the colours blue and red were selected to feature on the flag, instead of the gold and red on [[Coat of arms of Liechtenstein|the coat of arms]] that would have customarily been employed instead.  These new livery colours were first utilized by [[Joseph Wenzel I, Prince of Liechtenstein|Prince Joseph Wenzel I]] in 1764.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Whitney|last=Smith|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Flag of Liechtenstein|url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1355360/flag-of-Liechtenstein|date=July 17, 2013|accessdate=June 26, 2014|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.}} '''{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Constitution of Liechtenstein|new constitution]] for the Principality was formulated and proclaimed in October 1921.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Liechtenstein|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/liechtenstein/history|date=|accessdate=June 26, 2014|publisher=Lonely Planet}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It made the blue and red banner the national flag by granting it "official status".&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;  Fifteen years later, during the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], the country came to the realization that its flag was identical to the [[flag of Haiti]], even though Haiti [[1936 Summer Olympics#Participating nations|did not participate in the Olympics]] that year.  Because of this finding, the government added the prince's crown to the canton.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web|title=Liechtenstein|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ls.html|date=|accessdate=June 26, 2014|work=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite news|title=Flag bearing: a potted history|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/24/us-oly-flags-adv-idUSBRE86N0R420120724|date=July 24, 2012|accessdate=June 26, 2014|first=Venetia|last=Rainey|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This change served two purposes – to signify Liechtenstein's position as a principality, and to distinguish its flag from Haiti's.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt;&lt;ref name=complete&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZauSgqSl6ekC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=flag+of+liechtenstein#v=onepage&amp;q=flag%20of%20liechtenstein&amp;f=false|title=Complete Flags of the World|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Ltd.|date=November 3, 2008|last=Kindersley|first=Dorling|pages=148|accessdate=June 26, 2014|isbn=9781405338615}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This modified design was adopted on June 24, 1937.&lt;ref name=complete/&gt;

===Construction===
[[File:Flag of Liechtenstein (construction).svg|thumb|500px|center|Construction sheet for the Liechtenstein flag.]]

===Symbolism===
The colors and symbols of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings.  The blue represents the [[sky]], while red alludes to the "evening fires" that are lit inside houses throughout the country.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;  The crown – whose colour is disputed – epitomizes the "unity of the people and their [[Monarchy of Liechtenstein|prince]]."&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;  While ''[[The World Factbook]]'' and [[Reuters]] describe it as gold in colour,&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt; other sources – such as [[Whitney Smith]] in the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' – describe it as yellow.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref name=complete/&gt;

==Legal issues==
In February 2004, the [[Financial intelligence|Financial Intelligence Unit]] (FIU) of Liechtenstein called for the capture of a [[Dassault Falcon 50|Falcon 50]] private jet that was owned by the [[Ba'athist Iraq|former regime]] of [[Saddam Hussein]] and kept in [[Amman|Amman, Jordan]].  They sought this action because the plane flew the flag of Liechtenstein and had a registration number from [[Switzerland]], which keeps the civil aviation records of the Principality.  This was carried out shortly afterwards in order to comply with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title={{sic|Lei|chtenstein|nolink=y}} orders seizure of Saddam jet in Amman|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:WAFP&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=100F77D92233EF11&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=105B9A93AF33E3E3|date=February 26, 2004|accessdate=June 26, 2014|agency=Agence France-Presse}} '''{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After being transported to [[Basel]] and revamped entirely, the Liechtensteiner government returned the plane to the new [[Federal government of Iraq|government of Iraq]] on December 5, 2005.

According to Biohack.me, "Grinders are passionate individuals who believe the tools and knowledge of science belong to everyone. Grinders practice functional extreme body modification in an effort to improve the human condition. [Grinders] hack [them]selves with electronic hardware to extend and improve human capacities. Grinders believe in action, [thei]r bodies the experiment."&lt;ref name="biohack6" /&gt;

"Biohacking" can also refer to managing one's own biology using a combination of medical, nutritional and electronic techniques. This may include the use of [[nootropics]], non-toxic substances, and/or [[cybernetic]] devices for recording [[biometric]] data (as in the [[Quantified Self]] movement).&lt;ref name="biohack7"&gt;{{Cite web

Mahogany, satinwood, rosewood, and possibly sycamore veneers, gilded brass, and marble. Located in the [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]] of the [[White House]].]]
A '''guéridon''' is a small table supported by one or more columns, or sculptural human or [[Mythology|mythological]] figures, often with a circular top. The guéridon originated in [[France]] towards the middle of the 17th century. The supports for early guéridons were often modeled on [[ancient Egypt]]ian and [[ancient Greece|Greek]] as well as various African human traditional figures (inspired by [[caryatid]]s).  

While often serving humble purposes, such as to hold a candlestick or vase, the guéridon could be a high-style decorative piece of court furniture. By the time of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s death in 1715, there were several hundred guéridons at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], and within a generation they had taken an infinity of forms: columns, tripods, termini and mythological figures. Some of the simpler and more artistic forms were of wood carved with familiar decorative motives and gilded. Silver, enamel, and indeed almost any material from which furniture can be made, have been used for their construction. A variety of small occasional tables are now called ''guéridons'' in French.

'''''Les Chasses de Maximilien''''' (''The Hunts of Maximilian'') or '''''Les Belles Chasses de Guise''''' (''The Beautiful Hunts of Guise'') is a set of twelve tapestries, each showing a different hunting scene symbolising a different month of the calendar. All the scenes are set in the [[Soignes Forest]] near [[Brussels]] and the tapestries were produced by a studio in that city. They were probably commissioned by a member of the [[House of Habsburg]] such as [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy|Margaret of Austria]] or [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Mary of Hungary]] - the latter two both governed the [[Spanish Netherlands]] from Brussels.

===Bio-bomb===
A high-tech, [[fairy (Artemis Fowl)|fairy]]-manufactured guided missile, also known as a "bio-bomb" or a "blue-rinse" because of its blue colour. Once detonated, it employs the radioactive energy source Solinium 2 (an element not yet discovered by humans), destroying all living tissue in the area while leaving landscape and buildings untouched. It was used on [[Fowl Manor]] in ''[[Artemis Fowl (novel)|Artemis Fowl]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book

=== Book of the People ===
The '''Book of the People''' is the [[Fairy (Artemis Fowl)|Fairy]] [[bible]], known by the fairies themselves simply as the '''Book'''. It is written in [[Gnommish]], the fairy language. As it contains the history of the People and their life teachings, Artemis Fowl manages to secure a copy from an alcoholic fairy in [[Ho Chi Minh City]] and use it to kidnap [[Holly Short]], and to decode Gnommish. The first few lines are included in the first book.

Some of the first lines are:
: The Booke of the People.
: Being instructions to our magic
: and life rules.

: Carry me always, carry me well.
: I am thy teacher of herb and spell.
: I am thy link to power arcane.
: Forget me and thy magic shall wane.

: Ten times ten commandments there be.
: They will answer every mystery.
: Cures, curses, alchemy.
: These secrets shall be thine, through me.

: But, Fairy, remember this above all.
: I am not for those in mud that crawl.
: And forever doomed shall be the one
: Who betrays my secrets one by one.

It also states the proper [[Ritual (Artemis Fowl)|Ritual]] in which one buries an acorn to regain his or her powers. Apart from Artemis and his bodyguard, no humans are said to have seen the Book. If a human touches the Book without the fairy's permission it will combust.

Originally, the book was printed in spirals, which is how ancient fairy texts were read. However, reading in circles gave fairies [[migraines]], so normally printed version have been made (ordinary Gnommish), this is in the typical western version of reading, left-to-right, top-to-bottom.

===Buzz baton===
A fairy weapon, primarily used by the [[Lower Elements Police|LEP]] to incapacitate any foes they may face.&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book

&lt;/ref&gt; They are designed as bludgeoning weapons, and once powered, they will send a 1000 volt shock (10,000 volts in Artemis Fowl and the Atlantis Complex when used by Turnball) into the target- presumably enough to incapacitate a fairy, but insufficient when used against a human. An [[LEPretrieval]] squad attempted to use them against Butler in the Fowl Manor siege,&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; to no avail.

===Centaurian===
A script only known by [[centaur]]s.  The cipher is slightly easier to translate than Gnommish because many of the symbols look similar to their English counterparts. It can be read fluently once familiar, and is more like a recognisable [[font]] than a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Camfoil===
A thin sheet of foil that is wrapped around the body to imitate [[invisibility]] and to blend in with the surrounding environment. The foil is dotted with a series of micro-cameras, which enable the sheet to make an image of the wearer's background. Unfortunately, the entire surface uses circuits, which means that the invisibility can fail in rain or if the sheet is flattened by an object.

In ''[[Artemis Fowl: The Lost Colony]]'', however, [[Eoin Colfer]] states that the cam-foils are made of fairy-made diamonds that reflect light regardless of the direction and angle of viewing. Crushing the beads causes the sheet to fail.

===DNA cannons===
A specialized cannon designed to incapacitate any creature whose DNA is coded into the cannon with a laser. Most notably, the [[Opal Koboi|Koboi Laboratories]] is protected with DNA stun cannons.&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book 
| publisher = Hyperion Books for Children

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iris-cam===
A tiny LEP-issue camera within a [[contact lens]]; once attached to the user's eye, it is virtually invisible. However, to lower visibility, fairies tend to use one that matches their eye color. In ''The Eternity Code'', Artemis uses a hazel-colored lens, causing Jon Spiro to realize that something is "wrong with [his] eyes". It is used as a remote camera, which also has several filters, including thermal and x-ray. It should be noted that whenever one changes filters, a small shock passes through the iris-cam, which may cause discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book 
| publisher =Hyperion Books for Children.
| booknumber =3
| pages =yes  
| startpage =90 
| endpage =93

| year =2008
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of the iris cam won Foaly a school science project, Opal Koboi being runner up with her wing designs.

===LEP Helmet===
Part of the official LEP uniform, the LEP Helmet was developed by [[Foaly]]. The helmet includes a motion-sensor filter which flags moving objects "with an orange corona". The casing of the LEP helmet is made of impregnable polymer.  An LEP helmet contains a visor, a camera, two 400-watt lamps, and a pollution mask, as well as a microphone, and loudspeaker. All LEP helmets have a self-destruct system which can be activated remotely. When activated, the self-destruct system releases acid, which dissolves the helmet and anyone who was wearing it. Section Eight helmets, which are more sophisticated than normal LEP helmets, have more advanced functions, such as a visor with digital display,&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book 
| publisher =Scholastic Inc.
| booknumber =2
| pages =yes  
| startpage =25 
| endpage =
| month =July
| year =2008
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; plus all of a normal LEP helmet's capabilities. Section Eight helmets can also be controlled from Haven and be moved around independently using microbead bags and the officers Section 8 helmet also have flying thrusters as demonstrated by Foaly in the fifth book.&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book

| booknumber =2
| pages =yes  
| startpage =24 
| endpage =
| month =July
| year =2008
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnastrips===
Magnastrips power the automobiles in Haven City. [[LEP]] automobiles have the ability to push other vehicles out of the way in case of emergency&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book 
| publisher = Hyperion Books for Children
| booknumber = 4
| pages =  yes
| startpage = 61
| endpage =

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; During the lockdown in ''[[Artemis Fowl: The Eternity Code]]'', all non-emergency vehicles lost power.&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book

| endpage =
| day = 06
| month = 08
| year = 2008
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medi-Pac===
Invented by [[Foaly]], the medi-pac is an ice pack infused with magic healing crystals. Activated by crumpling the crystals together, it is applied to the wounded area. It is not as effective as magic, but it can be useful in a tight spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book 
| publisher =Scholastic Inc.
| booknumber =2
| pages =yes  
| startpage =195 
| endpage =196
| month =July
| year =2008
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesmer===
A magical power, similar to [[hypnosis]], that most of the fairy families are able to use, since only a small amount of magic is needed to ''mesmerize'' someone. It is even said that some humans have the power to do it. Someone who is under the ''mesmer'' has no control over their actions, and becomes entranced with the voice of the one mesmerizing. It requires direct eye contact, as well as a voice laced with suggestion; thus, the ''mesmer'' is useless against mirrored surfaces such as mirrored sunglasses or mirrored contact lenses, it is shown that a person of high intelligence can resist the mesmer, such as at the beginning of ''Artemis Fowl, the Arctic Incident'' when Holly was using the mesmer against Butler to command him to put down his weapon. Butler had been able to resist the mesmer although he gave in&lt;!--not a mistake--&gt; in the end. It is also notable that the Book forbids fairies from "mesmerizing" other fairies. It is also said that if someone resists the mesmer too much, his or her brain cells might be fried. If a someone is constantly mesmerized their pupils become increasingly ragged until they eventually go blind. In Book 6, ''The Time Paradox'', Butler had a heart attack when he tried to resist Opal Koboi's mesmer. It is also stated in Book 7, ''Artemis Fowl and the Atlantis Complex'', that when a person was mesmerized, "A large part of their brains were switched off and the parts left awake were not going to be winning any Nobel prizes".

===Mind-wipe===
The [[mind-wipe]] is a technology designed to erase parts of sentient memory, usually human. Any sighting of the People by a human being is erased from the memory of any humans involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book 
| publisher =Viking Press
| booknumber =1
| pages =yes  
| startpage =37
| endpage =
| month =04
| year =2001
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The mind-wipe has two forms; the block wipe, which obliterates the memory of a set period of time from the targeted mind, and the fine-tuned wipe, designed to remove only specific memories from the targeted mind. It was also mentioned that a block mind-wipe can cause a drop in IQ. A part of the process not fully understood by the People is that human minds usually invent new memories to fill in the gaps. However, if a human (or fairy for that matter) sees something related to what was mind wiped from them, the brain recalls the lost information. Example: You have been mind wiped to forget that a fairy shot you with a Neutrino 3000. If you later see a Neutrino 3000, "residual memories" may be sparked, and you will start to remember what happened.

[[Artemis Fowl II]], [[Domovoi Butler]] and [[Juliet Butler|Juliet]] all submitted to a fine-tune mind-wipe at the end of ''[[The Eternity Code]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book 
| publisher =Hyperion Books for Children
| booknumber =3

| startpage =156

&lt;/ref&gt; but Artemis and Butler managed to initiate a total recall through a disk containing specific knowledge to trigger recall.&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book

&lt;/ref&gt; as was Butler's, but Butler was able to recall all the memories totally after hearing merely his first name, Domovoi.&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; There was nothing on the disk for Juliet, although Juliet herself achieves total recall in ''[[Artemis Fowl: The Atlantis Complex|The Atlantis Complex]]'', by listening to Turnball mesmerizing people.

===Mood blanket===
The mood blanket is a multi-sensor massage and homeopathic garment meant for centaurs, created by Foaly.

===Mud People===
The terms 'Mud People', 'Mud Men', 'Mud Woman', 'Mud Maid', 'Mud Boy', 'Mud Girl' and 'Mud Kid' are generalizations used by fairies to address humans. This term comes from the age of the Battle of Taillte, when the People were battling the "Mud People" to stay above ground, they gave up due to overwhelming numbers. This term also conveys fairies' dislike and even contempt towards the human race because of their pollution and the fact that humans forced fairies underground (partly because fairies can only have a child every twenty years).&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book 
| publisher =Scholastic Inc.

| endpage =
| month =July

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neutrino 500===
This is the most basic model of the Neutrino in the Artemis Fowl books.  It is used in the short story "LEPrecon".  It is only mentioned in this story and is currently outdated.&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book
| publisher = Hyperion Books for Children
| booknumber = 0.5
| pages =  yes
| startpage = 46
| endpage = 46
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neutrino 2000===
The latest, lightweight model of fairy handguns, with three settings: "Scorched, well done, and crisped to a cinder." The Neutrinos are nuclear powered, so they have almost unlimited ammunition. Neutrinos can only knock out people, they can't kill.&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neutrino 3000===
The new version of the Neutrino 2000 that Foaly designed after the [[Artemis Fowl: The Arctic Incident|B'wa Kell rebellion]]. The guns are registered to only respond to one person, and every shot loosed by the Neutrino 3000 is recorded on a computer log. There are no metal parts, and, as Foaly describes, it is "powered by kinetics, the motion of your body, with a backup mini-nuke cell... The casing is virtually impregnable".&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Omnitool===
A device that is capable of picking most human locks. Seen in ''Artemis Fowl: The Eternity Code'' and ''Artemis Fowl: The Time Paradox''.
Holly's mother had one, which she passed down to Holly. However, Mulch Diggums stole it during the Hamburg Incident as mentioned in ''The Time Paradox''.

===Pressure Elevators===
Powered by "gaseous columns vented from the earth's core", fairies can ride in titanium eggs or more leisurely shuttles to the surface to perform the Ritual or for other business.&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book 
| publisher =Scholastic Inc.
| booknumber =1

&lt;/ref&gt; these irregular pressure releases are watched by the LEP technicians, and "flare-prediction teams" are accurate to about a tenth of a second with a 99.8% accuracy rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retimager===
A piece of fairy technology developed by Foaly that infallibly tells whether or not a person has seen a specific image before. Based on the premise that every image that a person sees leaves an infinitesimal etching on the [[retina]] that never disappears and therefore cannot be fooled by a mind-wipe, two suction cups resembling plungers are used to read the etchings on the subject's retinas. The seals on the suction cups are implanted with micro needles, which inject sedative through the subject's pores.&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book

| day = 06

| year = 2008
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Ritual===
The Ritual is explained in the Book (the "Fairy Bible").  It consists of picking an acorn from an ancient oak tree at a bend in a river during a full moon and planting it far from the ancient oak. When a fairy does this, his or her magic is replenished. In ''[[Artemis Fowl: The Time Paradox]]'', it is shown that magic may be replenished with the help of a warlock, demonstrated by [[List of characters in Artemis Fowl#N|N&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;1]].  In ''[[Artemis Fowl (novel)|Artemis Fowl]]'', Artemis and Butler captured [[Holly Short]] while she was attempting to complete the Ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book 
| publisher =Scholastic Inc.
| booknumber =1
| pages =yes  
| startpage =63 
| endpage =67
| month =July
| year =2008
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
An extract from the Fairy Bible describing the Ritual reads,&lt;br /&gt;
"From the earth thine power flows, &lt;br /&gt;
Given through courtesy, so thanks are owed. &lt;br /&gt;
Pluck thou the magick seed, &lt;br /&gt;
Where full moon, ancient oak and twisted water meet. &lt;br /&gt;
And bury it far from where it was found, &lt;br /&gt;
So return your gift into the ground."

===Sentinel===
A computer system invented by Foaly that monitors all human telecommunications and reviews phone calls with fairy-related "buzzwords".&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book 
| publisher =Hyperion Books for Children
| booknumber =3
| pages =yes  
| startpage =62 
| endpage =
| month =July
| year =2008
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the sheer amount of fairy-related culture, this method was somewhat unreliable for detecting breaches of security.

===Shielding===
A shield is a form of magic which allows the user to stay invisible to most observers. Fairies shield by increasing their heart rate, causing their bodies to vibrate so quickly that they are never in one place long enough to be seen by the naked eye. Usually, when using the shield, the fairy encounters resistance from non-vibrating clothing, equipment, etc., which causes a slight shimmer in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book 
| publisher =Scholastic Inc.
| booknumber =1
| pages =yes  
| startpage =52 
| endpage =53
| month =July
| year =2008
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A shielded fairy would cause any object they were sitting upon to shatter under the high vibrations. Fairies have difficulty shielding in areas with high levels of [[radiation]], like [[Chernobyl disaster|northern Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book 
| publisher =Hyperion Books for Children
| booknumber =3
| pages =yes  
| startpage =69 
| endpage =
| month =July
| year =2008
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
A shielded fairy can also be seen by if an anti-shield filter or by a high-speed camera, but requires viewers to look at the video frame by frame. In ''The Atlantis Complex'', Butler and Juliet see a shielded fairy using a type of sunglasses that Artemis had created which enable the wearer to see through fairy shields. However, rats and two species of monkey can naturally see through the shield.

===Softnose laser===
The softnose laser is an illegal type of laser weapon with a lifetime of less than ten years. They were originally powered with solar cells, but were adapted to be powered by simple AA [[alkaline batteries]] in ''[[The Arctic Incident]]''. The softnose fires a laser at a slower speed, penetrating the target (instead of incapacitating), causing greater damage than a normal laser.&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book 
| publisher =Hyperion Books for Children

| startpage =29 
| endpage =35

&lt;/ref&gt; The B'wa Kell goblin triad was armed with these weapons by [[Opal Koboi]] in the failed storming of Police Plaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solinium 2===
A radioactive element, still not in the human [[periodic table]]. It has a [[half-life]] of 14 seconds and is the main energy source of a bio-bomb.

===Solinium ===
The "bio bomb" used by the LEP utilizes Solinium in order to kill only living tissue. It is standard procedure to spray any LEP property with solinium-based tracker, as shown in ''The Arctic Incident''. Foaly was able to find Mulch Diggums by tracking the gold he stole from the ''Fowl Manor Siege''. Artemis Fowl also used a Solinium-based device, concealed in a button on his bodyguard Butler's jacket, to prevent electronic devices spying on him in Spain, as seen in ''The Lost Colony'' – it is noted by Butler that they "may have ruined a few honeymoon videos", showing the Solinium wipes digital visual recordings as well as preventing them.

===Time-stop===
A tool used by the Fairies in the [[Artemis Fowl (series)|''Artemis Fowl'' series]]. It stops time in a selected area using magic. Historically, time-stop fields were created by five warlocks who created a [[pentagram]] around the intended area. However, the process was mechanized by Foaly; the warlocks send their magic into lithium batteries, in which it can be stored until needed. Time-stops cut off an area entirely from the outside world; communications to the "outside world" are rendered useless, as nothing is able to penetrate the field. Once in a time-stop, it is impossible to change one's state of consciousness. If, upon entering the field, one is conscious, then it will be impossible to fall asleep, and vice versa. However, if one's state of consciousness is artificially changed (using [[hypnotic|sleeping pills]], for example), the person in question will have dropped out of the time-stopped area into the outside world. The person will later wake up after the time-stop has disappeared, while to anyone still in the time-stop, the person will have disappeared.

===Warlock===
A fairy with strong magic skills who is highly trained in the magical arts. In the past warlocks have been used to stop time and wipe minds. In modern times, since Foaly "had them do their thing into lithium batteries," Warlocks are still trained in the magical arts, but their training leans more towards the medical sides, such as emergency medicine. Most warlocks have a strong pacifist creed.

&lt;!-- Add section SafetyNet (from the 2nd book)! and what about the LEP jumpsuit(with heat dispersing microfilaments!?) and camfoil! and the moonbelt! and memory latex...(FYI these are notes for me as well as for you!) phew another one: the suits with microfiliments from book 4 see page 71... and stealth ore!--&gt;
&lt;!-- There is a new suit upgrade in The Time Paradox, and more technology. my copy is loaned out right now, so I'll do it tomorrow. --&gt;
'''Demon Warlock'''&lt;br&gt;
Demon Warlocks are the most powerful warlocks by far, and risked being shunned by other demons owing to the fact normal demons are bloodthirsty and non-magical. Their powers extend to time-travel and firing bolts of magic. In the 21st century, only three Demon Warlocks are still alive: Qwan was the only survivor of the petrification following Leon Abbot's interference in the time-spell; his apprentice Qweffor was melded with Abbot and eventually suppressed in the Leader's mind, and No 1 was the first Warlock born since the time-spell. Following the return of the Demon island Hybras to Earth, No 1 releases Qweffor from Abbot's control, and begins training under Qwan.

==Other concepts==&lt;!-- Should this stuff be put into AF: The Eternity code, because it's just two topics from that book and only that book. Otherwise, we need to expand this section with non-fairy topics. :D --&gt;

===C Cube===
A device made by [[Artemis Fowl II]] from stolen fairy technology in ''[[Artemis Fowl: The Eternity Code]]''. It can read any medium, electronic or organic, because it contains an "omnisensor", a piece of fairy technology that can sense anything. It was stolen by Jon Spiro, and had to be retrieved because it has the potential to compromise the People's security. It is encoded with an Eternity Code (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eternity Code===
Created by Artemis Fowl II, it is a code like any other code, except that it uses a completely new language as a base language, making it next to impossible to translate. As noted by one of [[Jon Spiro]]'s staff members,  Dr. Pearson, and Artemis Fowl II himself, theoretically it would take an eternity to get through the code.&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book

[[File:Anneke Grönloh 1964 Eurovision dress.jpg|thumb|A little black dress from 1964]]

A '''little black dress''' ('''LBD''') is a black [[evening gown|evening]] or [[cocktail dress]], cut simply and often quite short. [[History of fashion design|Fashion historians]] ascribe the origins of the little black dress to the 1920s designs of [[Coco Chanel]] and [[Jean Patou]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steele|first=Valerie|title=Paris Fashion: A Cultural History|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1988|pages=246–248|isbn=0-19-504465-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; intended to be long-lasting, versatile, affordable, accessible to the widest market possible and in a neutral colour. Its ubiquity is such that it is often simply referred to as the "LBD".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=styledotcom |url=http://www.style.com/stylefile/2010/08/the-lbd-gets-official/ |title=The LBD Gets Official |work=Style.com |date=2010-08-19 |accessdate=2013-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2010/04/15/katy-perry-looks-stunning-in-slinky-lbd-115875-22187069/ |title=Katy Perry looks stunning in slinky LBD |work=Mirror.co.uk |date=2010-04-15 |accessdate=2013-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niu.edu/PubAffairs/RELEASES/2007/feb/blackdress.shtml ''"Women’s History Month kicks off in ‘Little Black Dress’ style"'', Northern Illinois University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011134843/http://niu.edu/PubAffairs/RELEASES/2007/feb/blackdress.shtml |date=2010-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "little black dress" is considered essential to a complete [[Clothing|wardrobe]] by many women and fashion observers, who believe it a "rule of fashion" that every woman should own a simple, elegant black dress that can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion: for example, worn with a jacket and pumps for daytime business wear or with more ornate jewelry and accessories for evening or a formal event such as a [[wedding]] or a [[ball (dance party)|ball]].

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
Black has always been [[Black#Associations_and_symbolism|a color rich in symbolism]]. In the early 18th century, black represented romance and artistry. As [[Ann Demeulemeester]] said of it, "Black is poetic. How do you imagine a poet? In a bright yellow jacket? Probably not." In the early 19th century, black was adopted by the [[Romantics]] such as [[Byron]], [[Shelley]], and [[Keats]], due to its melancholic aura. As the [[Victorian era]] began, black transitions from a color of art to one of grief and mourning – widows were expected to wear black for at least four years – and also for service livery, as the uniform for [[maid]]s.

In 1926 [[Gabrielle Chanel|Gabrielle "Coco" Chanel]] published a picture of a short, simple black dress in American ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''. It was calf-length, straight and decorated only by a few diagonal lines. ''Vogue'' called it "Chanel's Ford". Like the [[Model T]], the little black dress was simple and accessible for women of all social classes. ''Vogue'' also said that the LBD would become "a sort of uniform for all women of taste".&lt;ref name="Edelman, Amy Holman (1998). The Little Black Dress. Aurum."/&gt; This, as well as other designs by the house of Chanel helped disassociate black from mourning, and reinvent it as the uniform of the high-class, wealthy, and chic. As Coco herself proclaimed, "I imposed black; it's still going strong today, for black wipes out everything else around."&lt;ref name=picardie92&gt;{{Cite book|title=Coco Chanel: the legend and the life |last=Picardie |first=Justine |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|year=2010|isbn=9780061963858|location=London|pages=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The little black dress continued to be popular through the [[Great Depression]], predominantly through its economy and elegance, albeit with the line lengthened somewhat. [[Hollywood]]'s influence on fashion helped the little black dress's popularity, but for more practical reasons: as [[Technicolor]] films became more common, filmmakers relied on little black dresses because other colors looked distorted on screen and botched the coloring process. During [[World War II]], the style continued in part due to widespread rationing of textiles, and in part as a common uniform (accessorized for businesswear) for civilian women entering the workforce.

[[File:12-promotional-models-Fenasucro-2010.JPG|thumb|200px|Models wearing little black dresses in [[Brazil]], 2010]]
The rise of [[The New Look (style)|Dior's "New Look"]] in the post-war era and the sexual conservatism of the 1950s returned the little black dress to its roots as a uniform and a symbol of the dangerous woman. Hollywood [[femme fatale]]s and [[fallen women]] characters were portrayed often in black halter-style dresses in contrast to the more conservative dresses of housewives or more wholesome Hollywood stars. Synthetic fibres made popular in the 1940s and 1950s broadened the availability and affordability of many designs.

The generation gap of the 1960s created a dichotomy in the design of the little black dress. The younger "[[mod (subculture)|mod]]" generation preferred, in general, a miniskirt on their versions of the dress and designers catering to the [[youth culture]] continued to push the envelope - shortening the skirt even more, creating cutouts or slits in the skirt or bodice of the dress, using sheer fabrics such as [[netting]] or [[Tulle (netting)|tulle]]. Many women aspired to simple black sheath dresses similar to the [[Black Givenchy dress of Audrey Hepburn|black Givenchy dress]] worn by [[Audrey Hepburn]] in the film ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]''.

The popularity of casual fabrics, especially knits, for dress and business wear during the 1980s brought the little black dress back into vogue. Coupled with the fitness craze, the new designs incorporated details already popular at the time such as broad shoulders or [[Overskirt|peplums]]: later in the decade and into the 1990s, simpler designs in a variety of lengths and fullness were popular. The [[Grunge#Presentation and fashion|grunge]] culture of the 1990s saw the combination of the little black dress with both sandals and [[combat boots]], though the dress itself remained simple in cut and fabric.

The new glamour of the late 1990s led to new variations of the dress but, like the 1950s and the 1970s, colour re-emerged as a factor in fashion and formalwear and repeatedly shows an aversion to black. The resurgence of body conscious clothing, muted colour schemes, and the reemergence of predominant black, along with the retrospective trends of the 1980s in the late 2000s paved way to the return of interest to the dress.

==Famous little black dresses==
[[File:Lena Oslo3 cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Eurovision Song Contest]] winner, [[Lena Meyer-Landrut|Lena]], sporting a little black dress and black [[stocking]]s while singing her winning song "[[Satellite (Lena Meyer-Landrut song)|Satellite]]".]]
The [[black Givenchy dress of Audrey Hepburn]] as Holly Golightly in ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany’s]]'', designed by [[Hubert de Givenchy]], epitomized the standard for wearing little black dresses accessorized with pearls (together called "basic black"), as was frequently seen throughout the early 1960s. The dress set a record in 2006 when it was auctioned for £410,000, six times its original estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/2006/12/06/audrey-hepburn-dress/ |title=Audrey Hepburn's Little Black Dress Sells for a Fortune |work=Hellomagazine.com |date=2006-12-06 |accessdate=2013-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Betty Boop]], a cartoon character based in part on the 1920s "[[it girl]]" [[Clara Bow]], was drawn wearing a little black dress in her early films, though with [[Technicolor]] later, Betty's dress became red.&lt;ref name="Edelman, Amy Holman (1998). The Little Black Dress. Aurum."&gt;Edelman, Amy Holman (1998). ''The Little Black Dress''. Aurum.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wallis Simpson]], Duchess of Windsor, was known to own several little black dresses and said much in praise of the garments. One quote of the Duchess: "When a little black dress is right, there is nothing else to wear in its place."&lt;ref name="Edelman, Amy Holman (1998). The Little Black Dress. Aurum."/&gt; [[Edith Piaf]], the French folk icon, performed in a black sheath dress throughout her career: for this habit she was nicknamed "little black sparrow". It was thought that the dress helped audiences focus more on Piaf's singing and less on her appearance.&lt;ref name="Edelman, Amy Holman (1998). The Little Black Dress. Aurum."/&gt;

In an incident at [[London]]'s [[Covent Garden]] theatre in 2004, a director fired the then-[[obseity|obese]] [[soprano]] [[Deborah Voigt]] from an [[opera]] because she could not fit into a "little black cocktail dress", replacing her with the slimmer [[Anne Schwanewilms]].&lt;ref name=Body&gt;Anthony Tommasini, "With Surgery, Soprano Sheds a Brünnhilde Body," ''New York Times'', March 27, 2005, found at [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/27/arts/music/27voig.html New York Times website].

''Masu'' existed in many sizes, typically covering the range from one ''[[Japanese units of measurement|to]]'' (一斗枡 ''ittomasu'', c. 18&amp;nbsp;L) to one ''[[Gō (unit of measurement)|gō]]'' (一合枡 ''ichigōmasu'', c. 0.18&amp;nbsp;L).

Today ''masu'' are largely used for drinking [[sake]], as the advent of modern [[rice cooker]]s and a higher calorie diet in Japan has made them impractical for measuring portions of rice, and the standard size is one ''gō'', or 0.18039&amp;nbsp;L.

A small {{convert|2.5|by|2.5|by|2.25|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip|round=5}}, lidded form of ''masu'', made of [[hinoki]], is sold for serving pepper, salt, sugar, and other dry condiments at the table.

[[File:Rempit4.jpg|thumb|Police stopping hundreds of motorcyclists at the Kerinchi Link in Kuala Lumpur]]

A '''Mat Rempit''' is a Malaysian term for "an individual who participates in immoral activities and public disturbance with a motorcycle as their main transport", usually involving [[underbone]] motorcycles,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Young, fast, and safe|date=6 May 2014|newspaper=[[The Sun (Malaysia)|The Sun]]|location=Malaysia|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/node/251142}}&lt;/ref&gt; colloquially known as [[Kapcai]], or [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]]. Mat Rempits are not involved in street racing but rather go against each other for cheap thrills and to rebel against authorities while some of them perform stunts for fun, such as the wheelie, superman (lying flat on the seat), [[stoppie|wikang]], and scorpion (standing on the seat with one leg during a wheelie).

==Etymology==
The word "Rempit" comes from "ramp-(rev)-it" (ramp the throttle). According to [[Kamus Dewan]], the definition of "Rempit" is "the act of whipping with a cane".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080530105520/http://sbmb.dbp.gov.my/knb/cariankata/ka_rujukan_kamus_dbp.aspx?KataKunci=REMPIT&amp;Type=1 Rujukan Kamus Terbitan DBP]. {{ms icon}} Retrieved on 28 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative source of the word is derived from the noise made by a [[2-stroke]] motorcycle. "Mat" is a Malay slang term used to address or to refer to a male person who is usually of Malay descent but is generally used derogatorily.

Mat Rempits usually travel in groups and create disturbance in bustling city centres on weekend nights. Mat Rempits are usually associated with [[gangster]]ism, gang robbery,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070312202550/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F1%2F27%2Fnorth%2F16701752&amp;sec=north Motorcycle gang robs vendor of RM70]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/community/2007/01/19/mat-rempit-gang-menace-rep-three-robberies-brought-to-my-attention/|title=Mat Rempit gang menace Rep: Three robberies brought to my attention|last=Tan|first=David|date=19 January 2007|website=The Star|access-date=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; street fighting, assault,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Monday/National/2397834/Article/index_html|title=Chaos after m-cyclist dies in crash|last=Alang Bendahara|first=|date=10 November 2008|website=New Straits Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113132707/http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Monday/National/2397834/Article/index_html|archive-date=13 November 2008|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; vandalism, theft and bullying. Most motorcycles used by the Mat Rempits do not meet standard specifications, or have been modified extensively for greater speed, or just to make the exhaust noisier.

Additionally, most Mat Rempits do not have valid motorcycle licenses, do not pay [[road tax]]es, and ride stolen [[motorcycles]].&lt;ref name="rempit_one"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070312050041/http://star-motoring.com/blog/permalink.asp?id=23 Mat Rempit] The Star Online Motoring Blog&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rempit_two"&gt;[http://www.hmetro.com.my/Current_News/HM/Tuesday/Minda/20060808104721/Article/indexs_html Membendung lumba haram] Harian Metro {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210053801/http://www.hmetro.com.my/Current_News/HM/Tuesday/Minda/20060808104721/Article/indexs_html|date=10 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing number of housing estates have also been turned into racing tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2007/01/02/residents-fed-up-with-mat-rempit-ruckus-go-after-them/|title=Residents fed up with Mat Rempit ruckus go after them|last=Tunku Shahariah|first=|date=2 January 2007|website=The Star|access-date=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that there are about 200,000 Mat Rempits in Malaysia.&lt;ref name="rempit_three"&gt;''Rempit – Budaya Menunjuk-nunjuk'' – Kosmo!

==Violence==

[[File:846104-a1abb3ca-6c3c-11e4-a.jpg|thumb|Mat rempit doing a wheelie with his ''[[prostitute|bohsia]]'']]
In April 2009, Malaysia's Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Musa Hassan said that the Mat Rempit had become violent and brazen instead of just being a public nuisance. He said "We have to come down hard on the Mat Rempit who have started to become involved in robberies, snatch thefts and are even attacking innocent road users and we also need to use harsh tactics to catch the Mat Rempit that try to runaway from the roadblocks ." He also added that "Parents must be more responsible and should not allow their underage children to drive cars or ride motorcycles"

Mat Rempits often end up being hospitalised after they fail to perform their actions or stunts such as 'superman', 'spider' and many more. Every weekend, around 10 people are hospitalised after being involved in accidents when riding motorcycles at high speed.

According to [[Selangor]] police chief Datuk Tun Hisan Tun Hamzah, it was the parents who are the ones who should be blamed on this and while [[Kuala Lumpur]] deputy police chief, Datuk Amar Singh said that it was due to lack of parents' attention, Amar also pointed out that especially when they are in a big group, they would act beyond the limit by attacking the authorities and challenging traffic laws indiscriminately, further pointed out that their peers will challenge them to do something outrageous like assaulting police officers and challenging road rules, just to prove that they're not cowards." &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130413151445/http://www.mmail.com.my/story/selangor-cpo-blames-parents-rempit-mentality]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political reaction==
The widespread phenomenon of the subculture has driven some politicians in Malaysia to voice out concern and need to help rehabilitate the people involved in activities pertaining to that culture. [[Khairy Jamaluddin]] and [[Abdul Azeez Abdul Rahim]] as he was formerly mat rempit. Khairy says" should become the "Eyes and Ears" of Malaysian"{{Clarify|reason=Language is unclear|date=February 2017}}

In 2006, a Member of Parliament representing [[Kuala Krau (federal constituency)|Jenderak, Pahang]] suggested that the Mat Rempit should be accepted and guided to save them from indulging in dangerous activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kennysia.com/archives/2006/11/adoptarempit.php kennysia.com: Adopt-A-Rempit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, newspaper Kosmo! reported that the Mat Rempit in the state of [[Kelantan]] would be allowed to show off their skills at a special track to be built by the state government in [[Tanah Merah, Malaysia|Tanah Merah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2008/05/01/kelantan-to-build-track-for-mat-rempit/|title=Kelantan to build track for Mat Rempit|last=|first=|date=1 May 2008|website=The Star|access-date=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The then-Menteri Besar, Datuk [[Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat]] said amidst the criticism that the track was not a waste of money, stating:

{{cquote
|They (the Mat Rempit) always make their mothers and wives worry. With the track they will have a proper place to express their feelings and show their bravery and heroics... }}A  similar approach had been taken note of by neighbourly state [[Kedah]], where its state government is looking into the possibility of building such an infrastructure, to "overcome the menace", saying another option was to create more job opportunities for them as most of them were jobless.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081206161820/http://thestar.com.my/metro/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F5%2F10%2Fnorth%2F21140174&amp;sec=north Archives | The Star Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The former state's Chief Minister [[Azizan Abdul Razak]] said:

==Notable massive operations==
On 3 May 2009, the Bukit Aman Traffic Division of the [[Royal Malaysian Police]], together with the [[Malaysian Road Transport Department|Road Transport Department]], have launched a major integrated operation to crack down on both car and Mat Rempit motorcycle illegal racing. More than 115 motorcycles were [[confiscation|impounded]] in the major operation which was held simultaneously in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Selangor, [[Penang]] and [[Negeri Sembilan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last =  | first =  | author-link =  | last2 =  | first2 =  | author2-link =  | title = 115 motor kena angkut {{ms icon}}  | newspaper = Harian Metro  | pages =  | year =  | date = 4 May 2009  | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
The subculture surrounding the Mat Rempit has been the focus of numerous films and songs in Malaysia. Film depictions of the subculture began in 1984 with ''Gila-Gila Remaja'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.filemkita.com/filem/g/gila-gila_remaja_01.html|title=Gila-Gila Remaja - Filem Malaysia|last=|first=|date=|website=www.filemkita.com|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ali Setan'' (1985),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.filemkita.com/filem/a/ali_setan_01.html|title=Filem - Ali Setan (1985)|website=www.filemkita.com|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Litar Kasih'' (1996),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.filemkita.com/filem/l/litar_kasih_01.html|title=Litar Kasih - Filem Malaysia|last=|first=|date=|website=www.filemkita.com|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''KL Menjerit'' (2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.filemkita.com/filem/k/kl_menjerit_01.html|title=KL Menjerit - Filem Malaysia|last=|first=|date=|website=www.filemkita.com|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its prequel ''KL Menjerit 1'' (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.filemkita.com/filem/k/kl_menjerit1_01.html|title=Filem - KL Menjerit 1 (2005)|website=www.filemkita.com|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Remp-It|REMP-IT]]'' (2006), ''Bohsia: Jangan Pilih Jalan Hitam'' (2009), ''[[Adnan Semp-It]]'' and ''V3 Samseng Jalanan'' (both in 2010).

The relationship between '''multiculturalism and Islam''' is an important aspect in the overall debate on the soundness of the modern doctrine of [[multiculturalism]].

==Debate on issues surrounding multiculturalism==

===Backlash against multicultural policies===
In an article in the ''[[Hudson Review]]'', [[Bruce Bawer]] writes about what he sees as a developing distaste toward the idea and policies of multiculturalism in Europe, especially in the [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Austria]] and [[Germany]]. The belief behind this backlash on multiculturalism is that it creates friction within society.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.hudsonreview.com/bawerWi06.pdf Crisis in Europe]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incompatibility with secular society===
Incompatibility with secular society has been influenced by a stance against multiculturalism advocated by recent philosophers, closely linked to the heritage of [[New Philosophers]].&lt;ref name="Modood"&gt;{{cite book | title=Multiculturalism, Muslims and Citizenship: A European Approach | author=Tariq Modood | publisher=Routledge | edition=1st |date=2006-04-06| isbn=978-0-415-35515-5 | pages=3, 29, 46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fiery polemic on the subject by proponents like [[Pascal Bruckner]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Pascal Bruckner]] - [http://www.signandsight.com/features/1146.html Enlightenment fundamentalism or racism of the anti-racists?] originally appeared in German in the online magazine Perlentaucher on January 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul Cliteur]] has kindled international debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertarian.nl/NL/archives/000198.php  Paul Cliteur, Moderne Papoea’s, Dilemma’s van een multiculturele samenleving, De Uitgeverspers, 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013124744/http://libertarian.nl/NL/archives/000198.php |date=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction of sharia in Western countries===
In Canada, the possible introduction of [[sharia]] family courts became a contentious issue, and received much media attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/3599264.stm ''Will Canada introduce Sharia law?''], ''BBC News'', 26 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Fidler, 2006. [http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/fidler270506.html ''Ontario's "Sharia Law" Controversy: How Muslims Were Hung Out to Dry.'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[London]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] is far more segregated on religious grounds than by race. 25% of London's seven million residents live in religiously segregated neighbourhoods.&lt;ref name="24dash.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.24dash.com/news/Housing/2007-09-04-London-s-neighbourhoods-segregated-by-religion|title=London's neighbourhoods 'segregated by religion'|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402153219/http://www.24dash.com/news/Housing/2007-09-04-London-s-neighbourhoods-segregated-by-religion|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/sep/19/race.socialexclusion|title=Britain 'sleepwalking to segregation'|work=the Guardian|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suspicion towards Muslims===
A survey showed that 18% in Britain think that "a large proportion of British Muslims feel no sense of loyalty to this country and are prepared to condone or even carry out acts of terrorism".&lt;ref&gt;Daily Telegraph. ''[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1527192/Islam-poses-a-threat-to-the-West%2C-say-53pc-in-poll.html Islam poses a threat to the West, say 53% in poll]''. 25 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A TNS/Global poll showed that 31% in Britain would feel comfortable living next to a Muslim, this figure dropped to 21 percent after the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|7/7 bombings in London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2006/09/07/muslims-increasingly-distrusted-234352/|title=Muslims increasingly distrusted|author=metrowebukmetro|work=Metro|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"What happens when Rowling pulls this in, is we as Native people are now opened up to a barrage of questions about these beliefs and traditions…but these are not things that need or should be discussed by outsiders.

Keene observes that Native Americans are barely represented in mainstream media, and journalists often turn to non-Native sources, rather than to Natives themselves, on the rare occasions when they do cover Native issues.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-27423033|title=BBC News - #BBCtrending: Native Americans reject 'super drunk' label|work=BBC News|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the increasing popularity of her blog and appearance on other social media such as [[Twitter]] has made her a widely quoted expert&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=211370951 |title = Powwow Party Flub Leads To Fashion Line | work = | publisher = [[National Public Radio|NPR]] ||accessdate=April 7, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428011727/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=211370951 |archivedate=April 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on matters to do with appropriations, with mentions in the [[BBC]],&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; [[NPR]],&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/fake-native-american-clothing-dark-side-fashion|title=Fake Native American clothing ranges show the darker side of fashion|author=Tansy Hoskins|work=the Guardian|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Phoenix New Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/jackalope/2012/09/aztec_navajo_headdress_fashion_urban_outfitters_sanrio_black_label.php|title=Bloggers Adrienne Keene and Dr. Jessica Metcalfe on Native Headdresses, Patterns, and "Aztec" Labels in Popular Fashion|author=Rebekah Zemansky|date=18 September 2012|work=Jackalope Ranch|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al Jazeera]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/201107062007-009227|title=Don't Trend on My Culture|work=Don't Trend on My Culture|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/07/03/johnny-depp-as-tonto-is-the-lone-ranger-racist/|title=Johnny Depp as Tonto: Is 'The Lone Ranger' Racist? - TIME.com|work=TIME.com|accessdate=6 January 2015|date=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other major news outlets.

==Plot==
During the winter of 1846, a group of ill-fated [[American pioneer|pioneers]], known as the [[Donner Party]], were on their way to [[California]] through a newly discovered mountain pass.

As days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, the members of the [[Donner Party]] slowly dissolved into madness, eventually turning on each other in what became a desperate, [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] slaughter.&lt;ref name="Story Page"/&gt;

The story begins in 2008 as six friends arrive at an isolated cabin to enjoy a long weekend in the snow. An epic snowstorm interrupts their vacation, trapping them on the mountain and resurrecting the haunting [[ghost]]s of the [[Donner Party]]. They struggle to find out whether these are the true demonic 'entities' or if it is simply 'cabin fever' that is bringing out their fears and paranoia, causing friends to turn against each other as their reality deteriorates around them.&lt;ref name="Story Page"/&gt;

The '''Norweilemil''' were an [[indigenous Australian]] people of the [[Northern Territory]].
==Country==
The were a small tribe with, in [[Norman Tindale|Tindale]]'s estimation, some 400 sq. miles of territory  on the southeastern flank of the [[Van Diemen Gulf]], and west of the [[Alligator Rivers|West Alligator River]]. They were also attested around Stuart Point. {{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=234}}
==Practices==
[[Baldwin Spencer]] classifies them with  many other contiguous tribes in that area:-
&lt;blockquote&gt;To the same group of tribes belong, apparently, the [[Ngormbur|Koarnbut]], Quiradara, Norweilemil, [[Puneitja|Punuurlu]], [[Djowei|Kumertuo]], [[Gunwinggu|Geimbio]], Malanji, and, possibly, the [[Larrakia|Larakia]]. These, together with the [[Iwaidja|Iwaldji]], [[Gaagudju|Kakadu]], and the [[Melville Island (Australia)|Melville]] and [[Bathurst Island (Northern Territory)|Bathurst Islander]]s, form a group of tribes sharply marked off, not only by the absence of class organisation, but by the fact that their initiation ceremonies are distinguished by the absence of both circumcision and [[subincision]].{{sfn|Spencer|1914|p=52, cf.p=89}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also adds that, like the others, they do not appear to have used [[bullroarer]]s.{{sfn|Spencer|1914|p=211}}

==Alternative names==
* ''Lemil.'' (?){{sfn|Spencer|1914|p=90}}
* ''Noalanji.''{{efn|Spencer distinguishes the Noalanji from the Norweilemil, a distinction apparently ignored by Tindale.{{sfn|Spencer|1914|p=89}}}}

'''Pasola''' is a mounted spear-fighting competition from western [[Sumba]], [[Indonesia]]. It is played by throwing wooden [[spear]]s at the opponent while riding a [[horse]] to celebrate the [[rice]]-planting season. The word ''pasola'' means spear in the local language and derives from the [[Sanskrit]] ''sula''. According to legend, pasola originated with a woman from the village of Waiwuang. When her husband – a local leader – left home for an extended period, she believed him to be dead and eloped with a new lover from another village. After her husband returned, the woman still chose to stay with her new lover, and the two were married. To forget their leader's sadness, the people of Waiwuang held the festival of pasola. Originally the participants rode horses and threw spears at each other in an attempt to spill blood to the ground,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=uX_KT6_OAoOa8gTT5JSNDw&amp;id=kc4UAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=pasola+cock&amp;q=cock-fight Spirit of Asia – Michael Macintyre – British Broadcasting Corporation, Jan 1, 1980 p. 23]&lt;/ref&gt; as a way of thanking the ancestors for a successful harvest and ensuring another prosperous [[rice]] harvest. The ritual changed over time into more of a mock battle. The spear tips are now blunt and their metal tips removed. Whereas it was once considered an honour to die during pasola, only accidental deaths occasionally occur today. The human and horse blood which used to drench the field is now solely from sacrificed pigs, dogs, and chickens. Armed police are kept on guard to prevent fights from breaking out. Beginning in the 2010s, pasola has been promoted as a "game" for visiting spectators. The event traditionally begins when a certain kind of [[sea worm]] swims to shore, signifying the end of the wet season and the beginning of crop-planting. Today, the elders decide on the date in advance for the sake of tourists. Pasola is always held for four weeks in February and March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesian island sees future in age-old horseback battle |date=3 April 2014 |newspaper=The Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12212">The '''phantom time hypothesis''' is a historical [[conspiracy theory]] asserted by Heribert Illig. First published in 1991, it hypothesizes a conspiracy by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto III]], [[Pope Sylvester II]], and possibly the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine VII]], to fabricate the [[Anno Domini]] dating system retrospectively, in order to place them at the special year of AD 1000, and to rewrite history&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Ulrich Niemitz, [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/volatile/Niemitz-1997.pdf ''Did the Early Middle Ages Really Exist?''] pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; to legitimize Otto's claim to the Holy Roman Empire. Illig believed that this was achieved through the alteration, misrepresentation and forgery of documentary and physical evidence.&lt;ref name="fomenko1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly | year = 2007 | publisher = Mithec | isbn = 2-913621-07-4 | title = History: Chronology 1: Second Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this scenario, the entire [[Carolingian period]], including the figure of [[Charlemagne]], is a fabrication, with a "phantom time" of 297 years (AD 614–911) added to the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The proposal has been universally rejected by mainstream historians.

== Heribert Illig ==
Illig was born in 1947 in [[Vohenstrauß]], [[Bavaria]].
He was active in an association dedicated to [[Immanuel Velikovsky]], [[catastrophism]] and [[historical revisionism]],
''Gesellschaft zur Rekonstruktion der Menschheits- und Naturgeschichte''.
From 1989 to 1994 he acted as editor of the journal ''Vorzeit-Frühzeit-Gegenwart''.
Since 1995, he has worked as a publisher and author under his own publishing company, ''Mantis-Verlag'', and publishing his own journal, ''Zeitensprünge''.
Outside of his publications related to revised chronology, he has edited the works of [[Egon Friedell]].

Before focusing on the early medieval period, Illig published various proposals for revised chronologies of prehistory and of Ancient Egypt.
His proposals received prominent coverage in German popular media in the 1990s. His 1996 ''Das erfundene Mittelalter'' also received scholarly recensions, but was universally rejected as fundamentally flawed by historians.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Fried: ''Wissenschaft und Phantasie. Das Beispiel der Geschichte'', in: Historische Zeitschrift Band 263,2/1996, 291–316.
Matthias Grässlin, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 1. Oktober 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1997, the journal ''Ethik und Sozialwissenschaften'' offered a platform for critical discussion to Illig's proposal, with a number of historians commenting on its various aspects.&lt;ref&gt;EuS 1997 Heft 4.
Theo Kölzer (Bonn University) refused to contribute, and the journal printed his letter of refusal instead in which Kölzer criticizes the journal for lending credibility to Illig's "abstruse" idea.
A favourable review was published by sociologist Gunnar Heinsohn, which later led to a collaboration between Illig and Heinsohn until 2011, when Heinsohn left the board of editors of Illig's journal and published his rejection of Illig's core idea that the figure of Charlemagne is a high medieval fiction.&lt;/ref&gt;
After 1997, there has been little scholarly reception of Illig's ideas, although they continued to be discussed as [[pseudohistory]] in German popular media.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Borgolte]]. In: [[Der Tagesspiegel]] vom 29. Juni 1999. Stephan Matthiesen: ''[http://www.stephan-matthiesen.de/de/texte/archaeologie-geschichte/erfundenes-mittelalter-illig.html Erfundenes Mittelalter – fruchtlose These!]'', in: Skeptiker 2/2001&lt;/ref&gt;
Illig continued to publish on the "phantom time hypothesis" until at least 2013.
Also in 2013, he published on an unrelated topic of [[art history]], on [[German Renaissance]] master [[Anton Pilgram]], but again proposing revisions to conventional chronology, and arguing for the abolition of the art historical category of [[Mannerism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Meister Anton, gen. Pilgram, oder Abschied vom Manierismus'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposal ==
The bases of Illig's hypothesis include:&lt;ref name="Illig 1"&gt;{{cite book
 | first = Heribert | last = Illig
 | title = Wer hat an der Uhr gedreht? |isbn=3-548-75064-8 | publisher = Econ Verlag | year = 2000
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Illig 2"&gt;{{cite book
 | first = Heribert | last = Illig
 | title = Das erfundene Mittelalter |isbn=3-548-36429-2 | publisher = | year =
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The scarcity of [[Archaeology|archaeological]] evidence that can be reliably dated to the period AD 614–911, the perceived inadequacies of radiometric and [[Dendrochronology|dendrochronological]] methods of dating this period, and the over-reliance of medieval historians on written sources.
* The presence of [[Romanesque architecture]] in tenth-century Western Europe, suggesting the Roman era was not as long ago as conventionally thought.
* The relation between the [[Julian calendar]], [[Gregorian calendar]] and the underlying astronomical [[tropical year|solar or tropical year]]. The Julian calendar, introduced by [[Julius Caesar]], was long known to introduce a discrepancy from the tropical year of around one day for each century that the calendar was in use. By the time the Gregorian calendar was introduced in AD 1582, Illig alleges that the old Julian calendar should have produced a discrepancy of thirteen days between it and the real (or tropical) calendar. Instead, the astronomers and mathematicians working for [[Pope Gregory XIII]] had found that the civil calendar needed to be adjusted by only ten days. (The Julian calendar day Thursday, 4 October 1582 was followed by the first day of the Gregorian calendar, Friday, 15 October 1582). From this, Illig concludes that the [[Anno Domini|AD]] era had counted roughly three centuries which never existed.

== Criticism ==
* The most difficult challenge to the theory is through observations in [[Archaeoastronomy|ancient astronomy]], especially those of [[solar eclipse]]s cited by European sources prior to 600 AD (when phantom time would have distorted the chronology). Besides several others that are perhaps too vague to disprove the phantom time hypothesis, two in particular are dated with enough precision to disprove the hypothesis with a high degree of certainty. One is reported by [[Pliny the Elder]] in 59 AD&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder. [http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm#BOOK%20II ''Natural History'' (Book II)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101063545/http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm |date=2017-01-01 }}, accessed 14 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and one by [[Photius]] in 418 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Photius. [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/philostorgius.htm ''Epitome of the Church History of Philosturgius''], accessed 4 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these dates and times have confirmed [[Lists of solar eclipses|eclipses]]. In addition, observations during the [[Tang dynasty]] in China, and [[Halley's Comet]], for example, are consistent with current astronomy with no "phantom time" added.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|surname1=Dieter Herrmann|periodical=Beiträge zur Astronomiegeschichte&amp;nbsp;3|title=Nochmals: Gab es eine Phantomzeit in unserer Geschichte? |year=2000|at=pp.&amp;nbsp;211–14|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dutch"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dutch|first=Stephen|title=Is a Chunk of History Missing?|url=http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/PSEUDOSC/Phantom%20Time.HTM|accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Archaeological remains and dating methods such as [[dendrochronology]] refute, rather than support, "phantom time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Amalie |last=Fößel |title=Karl der Fiktive? |work=[[Damals]], Magazin für Geschichte und Kultur |issue=8 |year=1999 |pages=20f }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Gregorian reform was never purported to bring the calendar in line with the Julian calendar as it had existed at the time of its institution in 45 BC, but as it had existed in 325, the time of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], which had established a method for [[Computus|determining the date]] of [[Easter Sunday]] by fixing the [[vernal equinox]] on March 21 in the Julian calendar. By 1582, the astronomical equinox was occurring on March 10 in the Julian calendar, but Easter was still being calculated from a nominal equinox on March 21. In 45 BC the astronomical vernal equinox took place around March 23. Illig's "three missing centuries" thus correspond to the 369 years between the institution of the Julian calendar in 45 BC, and the fixing of the Easter Date at the Council of Nicaea in AD 325.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Mütz: ''Die „Phantomzeit“ 614 bis 911 von Heribert Illig. Kalendertechnische und kalenderhistorische Einwände.'' In: ''Zeitschrift für Württembergische Landesgeschichte.'' Band 60, 2001, S. 11–23.&lt;/ref&gt;
* If [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Carolingian dynasty]] were fabricated, there would have to be a corresponding fabrication of the history of the rest of Europe, including [[Anglo-Saxon England]], the [[History of the papacy|Papacy]], and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The "phantom time" period also encompasses the life of [[Muhammad]] and the [[Early Muslim conquests|Islamic expansion]] into the areas of the former Roman Empire, including the conquest of [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic Iberia]]. This history too would have to be forged or drastically misdated. It would also have to be reconciled with the history of the [[Tang dynasty]] of China and its contact with Islam, such as at the [[Battle of Talas]].&lt;ref name="Dutch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Cecil|title=Did the Middle Ages Not Really Happen?|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2992/did-the-middle-ages-not-really-happen|accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Project on the Status and Education of Women''' (PSEW) was the first [[United States]] project focused on gender equity in education. Formed in 1971 by the Association of American Colleges (AAC), known today as the [[Association of American Colleges and Universities]] (AACU), PSEW worked to improve access to and equity within higher education for women, addressing the needs of university students, faculty, staff, and administrators. PSEW produced and distributed materials about the status of women in higher education, advised colleges and universities about policies related to affirmative action, women's studies programs, and hiring women faculty, and worked with policymakers to introduce legislation to improve gender equity in American higher education. PSEW's periodical, ''On Campus with Women'' (OCWW), ran from 1971-2013 through the AACU, publishing articles and research related to women in higher education. PSEW also played a significant role in the development and passage of [[Title IX]], the portion of the U.S. [[Education Amendments of 1972]] that prohibits discrimination in education on the basis of sex.&lt;ref name="Finding Aid"&gt;Project on the Status and Education of Women (Association of American Colleges) Records, 1969-1991; Finding Aid. Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass.&lt;/ref&gt;

PSEW was dissolved as a separate project on June 30, 1991 and reincorporated into the AACU as the Program on the Status and Education of Women.&lt;ref name= "Crisis" /&gt; The program was directed by Caryn McTighe Musil until its conclusion in 2012.&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{cite web

==History and Formation==
The Project on the Status and Education of Women was founded in 1971 as the first step in a shift by the Association of American Colleges (now the [[Association of American Colleges and Universities]]) towards attention to student diversity.&lt;ref name= "Gaff"&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Located in the headquarters of the AACU in Washington, D.C., the organization operated with a small staff.&lt;ref name="Finding Aid" /&gt;  PSEW received funding through grants, including from the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] and the [[Ford Foundation]].

PSEW was integral in the passage of Title IX. As part of this effort, the organization visited schools, educated lawmakers on women's issues in academia, and advocated for policies to improve women's situation on campuses. PSEW pursued a focus on sexual harassment and rape on campus, producing educational materials on these subjects in the 1980s. Notably, the organization coined the term "chilly climate", used in many of its works to describe the challenges faced by women in education.&lt;ref name="Finding Aid" /&gt;

===People===
[[Bernice Resnick Sandler]] served as the director of PSEW from 1971-1991. Sandler was also active in the [[Women's Equity Action League]] (WEAL), through which she did similar work promoting gender equity in higher education. After Sandler, Caryn McTighe Musil served as director of the successor Program on the Status and Education of Women (PSEW) until 2012.&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;

Margaret C. Dunkle served as the Associate President of PSEW from 1972-1977. Roberta M. Hall and Grace L. Mastalli were also important staff members.&lt;ref name="Finding Aid" /&gt;

==Main Contributions==
===Publications===
PSEW was founded to aid colleges and universities in developing policies that addressed gender discrimination and sexual harassment. However, their work soon expanded beyond this mission, as PSEW staff began publishing original work on women in higher education.&lt;ref name="Gaff" /&gt; PSEW published over 100 reports, as well as booklets, pamphlets, and their newsletter ''On Campus with Women''.&lt;ref name="Equity"&gt;{{cite web
 | last = Musil
 | first = Caryn
 | title = Gender Equity: Who Needs It?
 | url = https://www.aacu.org/publications-research/periodicals/gender-equity-who-needs-it
 | access-date = 21 March 2017
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their publications addressed a range of subjects including recruiting women students and faculty, issues relevant to minority students, sex discrimination in hiring, sex bias in research, Title IX, financial assistance, sexual harassment on campus, and the academic climate for women. Their materials reached college presidents and faculty as well as policymakers, and not only disseminated information about events and research relating to women in education, but also informed women directly about their own legal rights to education. PSEW published the first papers on women of color in higher education and the first national reports on sex discrimination in college sports, hostile classroom environments, campus gang rape, and sexual harassment.&lt;ref name="Bernice"/&gt;

===="Chilly Climate"====
The organization additionally produced publications addressing a term it coined,&lt;ref name= "Bernice"&gt;{{cite web
 | title = AAC&amp;U Congratulates Bernice Sandler on Induction into National Women's Hall of Fame
 | url = http://www.aacu.org/whats-new/aacu-congratulates-bernice-sandler-induction-national-womens-hall-fame
 | date = 28 October 2013
 | access-date = 21 March 2017
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the "chilly climate" facing women at colleges and universities, a program of discourse which became a defining initiative for the group's contributions to equality in education.&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; The "chilly climate" was illustrated by descriptions of challenges experienced by women students and faculty, from disparaging comments made about women and their academic capacities to the sidelining and interruption of women in class. PSEW's discussion of these challenges to women's experiences in a learning environment contributed to wider dialogue about the unequal learning environments experienced by people from various underserved groups.&lt;ref name="Gaff" /&gt;

The project published several influential works on the topic. In 1982, Hall and Sandler published "The Classroom Climate: A Chilly One for Women?" The paper was funded by a grant from the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) of the [[U.S. Department of Education]]. PSEW held a conference in November 1982 called "The Chilly Classroom Climate: Sharing Strategies for Change" to publicize and discuss its findings. The final paper distributed at the conference sold over 40,000 copies between 1982 and 1990.&lt;ref name="Finding Aid" /&gt;

====''On Campus with Women''====
Perhaps PSEW's most prominent publication was their periodical, ''On Campus with Women'' (OCWW), which published research and articles on issues pertaining to women in higher education. Founded by Sandler at the inception of the PSEW in 1971, its content focused on women's leadership, campus climate, curriculum and pedagogy, and new research on women's participation in higher education. In the fall of 2002, OCWW moved exclusively online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = On Campus with Women
 | url = http://www.aacu.org/ocww/about_ocww.cfm
 | access-date = 20 March 2017
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the publication of ''On Campus with Women'' as a separate periodical ended,&lt;ref name="Bernice" /&gt; and its mission to cover gender issues in higher education was absorbed by the AACU's other journals, such as ''Liberal Education'' and ''Diversity and Democracy''.&lt;ref name="Finding Aid" /&gt;

===Advocacy===
====Title IX====
PSEW played in an integral role in working with Congressional staff and other organizations on the drafting and implementation of Title IX, interfacing with other organizations and Congress to construct and pass the law. PSEW also acted as a resource for universities to consult on potential implementation and policy between the law's June 1972 passage and the 1975 final report on enforcement and regulations from the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]].&lt;ref name="Finding Aid" /&gt; The organization helped colleges and universities to institute policies that limited their risk of violating the Title IX requirements.&lt;ref name="Gaff"/&gt; During this interim period, PSEW often worked with the National Coalition for Women and Girls in Education (NCWGE), a consortium of organizations founded to advocate for implementation regulations of Title IX on the enforcement, implementation, and funding of women's educational programs.&lt;ref name="Finding Aid" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = National Coalition for Women and Girls in Education 
 | url = http://www.ncwge.org
 | access-date = 21 March 2017
  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post-Title IX====
After Title IX became law, PSEW continued to educate policymakers and government officials about women's issues on college campuses. PSEW staff often visited college campuses to identify issues and to work with administrations on the implementation and enforcement of Title IX. PSEW also created educational materials on rape and sexual harassment as resources for campuses.&lt;ref name="Finding Aid" /&gt;

==Legacy and Absorption into AACU==
The Project on the Status and Education of Women was the first national project directed at women of higher education and was one of first programs to address gender differences regarding campus climate. The project's involvement on the continued enforcement and implementation of [[Title IX]] has had lasting effects, as well as its creation and distribution of educational materials related to sexual harassment. Since its formation, PSEW has spearheaded a number of initiatives advocating gender equity in higher education.&lt;ref name="Finding Aid" /&gt;

PSEW was dissolved as a separate project on June 30, 1991 as part of a push to focus on women's issues throughout the programming of the AAC.&lt;ref name= "Crisis"&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandler left her position of leadership and the group was reconstituted as the Program on the Status and Education of Women (PSEW). Upon being absorbed into the AACU, PSEW's primary source of funding no longer came from grants, as they were able to receive funding from the AACU. Musil directed the program until its conclusion in 2012, as the AACU redefined its mission to incorporate issues of gender equity. Some important reports and projects that were created during Musil's tenure were the report "A Measure of Equity: Women's Progress in Higher Education (2008)" and the establishment of the Campus Women Lead, which offered workshops on women's leadership, and the Women's Leadership Project for Inclusive Excellence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. pp. 193-194. {{ISBN|978-0-805-80507-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters assert that an object may have an [[Energy (esotericism)|energy field]] that transfers knowledge regarding that object's history.&lt;ref name="Zusne 1989"/&gt;

There is no scientific evidence that psychometry exists and the concept has been widely criticized.&lt;ref name="Zusne 1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skepdic"&gt;[http://skepdic.com/psychometry.html "Psychometry"]. The Skeptic's Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Joseph Rodes Buchanan.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Rodes Buchanan]]]]
[[Joseph Rodes Buchanan]] coined the word "psychometry" (measuring the [[soul]]) in 1842.&lt;ref name="spence754"&gt;[[Lewis Spence|Spence, Lewis]] ''Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology, Part 2'', Kessinger Publishing, LLC (February 1, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=gq1LhcH48GQC&amp;lpg=PA755&amp;ots=WpVgsnLntR&amp;pg=PA754 p.754]. {{ISBN|0-7661-2817-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jrb"&gt;Mark A. Lause ([[University of Cincinnati]]): ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20041112203715/http://www.geocities.com/CollegePark/Quad/6460/bio/B/uchananJR.html Joseph Rodes Buchanan]'' ([[Internet Archive]])&lt;/ref&gt; Buchanan came up with the idea that all things give off an [[emanationism|emanation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralumun.com/psychometry.htm Psychometry at paralumun.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Past is entombed in the Present!'' The world is its own enduring monument; and that which is true of its physical, is likewise true of its mental career. The discoveries of Psychometry will enable us to explore the history of man, as those of geology enable us to explore the history of the earth. There are mental fossils for psychologists as well as mineral fossils for the geologists; and I believe that hereafter the psychologist and the geologist will go hand in hand — the one portraying the earth, its animals and its vegetation, while the other portrays the human beings who have roamed over its surface in the shadows, and the darkness of primeval barbarism! Aye, the mental telescope is now discovered which may pierce the depths of the past and bring us in full view of the grand and tragic passages of ancient history!&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, 1893, [https://books.google.com/books?id=o0RDAAAAIAAJ&amp;ots=EAuuE0zscq&amp;dq=Manual%20of%20psychometry%20%3A%20the%20dawn%20of%20a%20new%20civilization&amp;pg=PA73 p.73]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Buchanan asserted that his particular psychism would supersede empiric science. He wrote a comprehensive treatise, ''Manual of Psychometry: the Dawn of a New Civilization'' (1885),  detailing how the direct knowledge of psychometry would be applied to and affect the many various branches of science. It also would elevate the various schools of philosophy and arts thereby affecting wide social change and ultimately an [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] of humanity:&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, 1893, pp.4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[thermometer]] measures [[Calorie|caloric]] (''[[Heat|thermo]]'' temperature). The [[barometer]] measures the [[Atmospheric pressure|weight]] (''baro'', weight) of the atmosphere; the [[electrometer]] measures [[Electric charge|electric]] conditions; the psychometer measures the soul (''psyche''). In the case of Psychometry, however, the measuring assumes a new character, as the object measured and the measuring instrument are the same psychic element, and its measuring power is not limited to the psychic as it was developed in the first experiments, but has appeared by successive investigation to manifest a wider and wider area of power, until it became apparent that this psychic capacity was really the measure of all things in the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan 1893, pp.3–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Buchanan continued to promote psychometry throughout his life and his followers believed that it would revolutionize science in a comprehensive way as "the dawn of a new civilization".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/27648/27648-8.txt ''Buchanan's Journal of Man.''], Vol. I. August, 1887. No. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Buchanan's work on psychometry was continued by the geologist William Denton (1823-1883). In 1863, Denton published a book on the subject ''The Soul of Things''. Their work was criticized by [[Joseph Jastrow]] as based on [[delusion]] and [[wishful thinking]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Jastrow|Jastrow, Joseph]]. (1935). ''Wish and Wisdom: Episodes in the Vagaries of Belief''. D. Appleton-Century Company. pp. 314-322. (Published in 1962 by Dover Books as ''Error and Eccentricity in Human Belief'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]] who promoted Psychometry along with his own new science of [[Universology]], built upon Buchanan's ideas. As a lecturer Andrews asserted that such inquiries, as paraphrased by an 1878 ''[[New York Times]]'' article, "demonstrated that the sympathy between the mind and body is an exact science".&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1878/03/17/81722786.pdf A discourse on Seven Sciences.; Cerebral Physiology, Cerebral Psychology, Sarcognomy, Psychometry, Pneumatology, Pathology, and Cerebral Pathology.] ''[[The New York Times]]'',  March 17, 1878&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later nineteenth century demonstrations of psychometry became a popular part of stage acts and [[séance]]s; with participants providing a personal object for "reading" by a [[Mediumship|medium]] or psychic. It is also commonly offered at [[psychic]] fairs as a type of [[psychic reading]].&lt;ref&gt;Marcelle S. Fischler [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/15/nyregion/long-island-journal-where-20-will-buy-a-peek-at-the-future.html LONG ISLAND JOURNAL; Where $20 Will Buy A Peek at the Future] ''nytimes.com'', December 15, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; At [[New Age]] events psychometry has claimed to help visitors "meet the dearly departed" (a form of [[spiritualism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Katherine E. Finkelstein [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/25/us/northport-journal-the-very-determined-meet-the-dearly-departed.html Northport Journal; The Very Determined Meet the Dearly Departed] ''nytimes.com'', August 25, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific reception==

There is no scientific evidence that psychometry exists. Skeptics explain alleged successes of psychometry by [[cold reading]] and [[confirmation bias]].&lt;ref name="Zusne 1989"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Piet Hein Hoebens|Hoebens, Piet Hein]]; [[Marcello Truzzi|Truzzi, Marcello]].

However, psychologist [[Leonard Zusne]] has noted that "enquiries with police officials... reveal that the involvement of psychics has not been very helpful, and that second-hand reports of it are often in gross error."&lt;ref name="Zusne 1989"/&gt;

[[Image:Re Records Quarterly Vol.1 No.1.jpg|thumb|275px|right|''Rē Records Quarterly Vol.1 No.1'' LP and magazine.]]

The '''''RēR Quarterly''''' (also known as '''''Rē Records Quarterly''''' and '''''RēR Records Quarterly''''') was an English "quarterly" sound-magazine comprising an [[LP record]] and a magazine. It was published at irregular intervals between 1985 and 1997 by [[Recommended Records]] and '''November Books''', and edited by English percussionist, lyricist and music theorist, [[Chris Cutler]]. It was sold internationally by Recommended Records via [[mail order]] and in specialist [[record shop]]s.

A total of thirteen issues were published (four volumes of four, four, three and two issues respectively) plus two "collection" issues featuring music selections from volumes 1 and 2. From volume 4 the LP was replaced by a CD and the CD and the magazine (now entitled '''''unFILEd: The RēR Sourcebook''''') were sold separately or together as a set.

==Background==
The idea for ''RēR Quarterly'' began in 1982 when [[Recommended Records]] released the ''[[Recommended Records Sampler]]'', a [[sampler album|sampler]] double album by various artists that contained newly recorded and previously unreleased work by musicians and groups on the Recommended Records catalogue at the time.

The record in each issue of ''RēR Quarterly'' contained previously unreleased music by artists from across the world, including commissioned pieces, projects and live recordings. The [[ISO 216|A4]] magazine (varying from 42 to 112 pages per issue) included artwork and theoretical and practical articles on music, often by the composers and performers featured on the record. In keeping with the goals of Recommended Records and its [[Wiktionary:prime mover|prime mover]], [[Rock in Opposition]], a number of new musicians and groups appeared on the records, many having their music published internationally for the first time.

Editor [[Chris Cutler]] described the ''RēR Quarterly'' as:
{{cquote|... firstly a sound magazine – not a sampler or a compilation, but a window on what was happening, essays in the possibilities of sound, introduction to new people. And secondly a printed magazine without the usual interviews and reviews, avoiding the language and outlook of the vapid music press ...&lt;ref name=CCinterview&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cloudsandclocks.net/interviews/CC_interview99.html |title=An interview with Chris Cutler (1999) |work=Clouds and Clocks |first=Beppe |last=Colli |accessdate=20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Distribution===
''RēR Quarterly'' was distributed primarily to international subscribers by Recommended Records in London. Individual issues were also sold by the record label and other specialist record stores. Subscribers received special Subscription Editions that were numbered and signed, and included "something extra". For example, issue 1/1 included additional artwork by [[Peter Blegvad]] from his and [[John Greaves (musician)|John Greaves]]'s 1977 album, ''[[Kew. Rhone.]]'', and issue 1/2 contained a [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]] of Soviet pop songs from the early 1980s (at that time musicians in the former Soviet Union had little to no exposure in the West).

===Name===
When the ''RēR Quarterly'' was first published in 1985, it was entitled ''The Rē Records Quarterly'', "Rē" being the label Cutler had set up for his own projects in 1978 alongside Recommended Records which served for distribution, mailorder and as a label for outside projects. In 1988 the name changed to ''The RēR Records Quarterly'' since the distinction between the two operations no longer needed to be marked. In 1994 the magazine title was reduced to ''The RēR Quarterly'', which remained until it mutated again into the ''Sourcebook'' series.

===Frequency===
While ''RēR Quarterly'' was intended to be a quarterly sound-magazine, the gaps between issues varied from four months to four years. Cutler remarked that "It was always hard to get sufficient material of quality for the Quarterly, and so it always took a long time to prepare each issue."&lt;ref name=CCinterview /&gt; Most of the pieces featured on the disc and magazine were commissioned, and as the magazine's circulation was small and it received no subsidy (each issue generally ran at a loss), the contributors received very little for their work. In addition, Cutler was not a full-time editor of the magazine and preparing each issue had to be squeezed into his schedule of recording, touring and running Recommended Records.

==Reception==
Paul Oldfield wrote in the English music newspaper, ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in 1985: "Theirs [''RēR Quarterly''] is the pursuit of unimaginable, packed in artwork of giddy luminescence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.squidco.com/rer/ReR.Quarterlies.discog.html |title=RēR Quarterlies |work=SquidCo |accessdate=20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of Vol. 4 No. 1 at [[AllMusic]], François Couture wrote that the music on the CD covers a broad range of styles, and that "[i]t takes wide ears and a solid stomach to switch from [[Cornelius Cardew]]'s sweet-and-sour orchestral music to N.O.R.M.A.'s street band exuberance".&lt;ref name=Couture&gt;{{cite web |last=Couture |first=François |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r%C3%A9r-quarterly-mw0000209585 |title=The RéR Quarterly, Vol. 4, No. 1 |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He praised the tracks by [[Thinking Plague]], Tom Nunn, Al Margolis and N.O.R.M.A., and said the album is "important" because pieces by Les Sales Combles, Diledadafish and Koongoortoog are the only recorded works left by these "occulted projects". Couture described this CD as "an accurate snapshot" of avant-garde music at the time, and gave it 3 stars out of 5.&lt;ref name=Couture/&gt;

Tom Schulte gave the Vol. 4 No. 2 CD 3 stars out of 5 in a review at AllMusic. He wrote that the album highlights include "[w]ave-like shapes of ambient noise" in "Feu Brilliant" by [[Keith Rowe]] and Alaid De Phillips, and extracts from a live radio performance in "After Hours" / "The Colour of Blood" by [[Shelley Hirsch]], [[Jon Rose]] and [[Chris Cutler]].&lt;ref name=Schulte&gt;{{cite web |last=Schulte |first=Tom |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r%C3%A9r-quarterly-vol-4-no-2-mw0000040940 |title=The RéR Quarterly, Vol. 4, No. 2 |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schulte called the latter a "very interesting listen" and described it as a "collage of conversation and instrumentation" that sounds like a "bizarre radio play".&lt;ref name=Schulte/&gt;

{{Sex in SF}}
Sexual themes are frequently used in [[science fiction]] or related [[genres]]. Such elements may include depictions of realistic sexual interactions in a science fictional setting, a protagonist with an alternative sexuality, or exploration of the varieties of [[human sexual activity|sexual experience]] that deviate from the conventional.

Science fiction and [[fantasy]] have sometimes been more constrained than [[literary fiction|non-genre narrative]] forms in their depictions of [[sexuality]] and [[gender]]. However, [[speculative fiction]] also offers the freedom to imagine societies different from real-life [[cultures]], making it an incisive tool to examine [[sexualism|sexual bias]] and forcing the reader to reconsider his or her [[bias|cultural assumptions]].

Prior to the 1960s, explicit sexuality of any kind was not characteristic of genre speculative fiction due to the relatively high number of minors in the target audience. In the 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by the [[civil rights]] movement and the emergence of a [[counterculture]]. [[New Wave science fiction|New Wave]] and [[feminist science fiction]] authors imagined cultures in which a variety of [[gender role|gender models]] and atypical sexual relationships are the norm, and depictions of sex acts and alternative sexualities became commonplace.

There also exists [[:Category:Science fiction erotica|science fiction erotica]], which explores sexuality and the presentation of themes aimed at inducing [[sexual arousal|arousal]].

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==Critical analysis==
As genres of [[popular literature]], science fiction and fantasy often seem even more constrained than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterization and the effects that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender.&lt;ref name="glbtq"/&gt; Sex is often linked to disgust in science fiction and [[horror fiction|horror]],&lt;ref name="EoSF"&gt;{{cite book | chapterurl=http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/sex | chapter=Themes: Sex  | title= [[Science Fiction Encyclopedia]] (SFE) | authors=[[John Clute]], [[David Langford]], [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]] | date=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives.&lt;ref name=EoF&gt;[[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[John Grant (writer)|Grant, John]],''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Sex" p. 854, 1st Ed., (1997), Orbit, Great Britain, {{ISBN|1-85723-897-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also offer more freedom than do non-genre literatures to imagine alternatives to the default assumptions of [[heterosexuality]] and [[patriarchy|masculine superiority]] that permeate many cultures.&lt;ref name="glbtq"/&gt;

In speculative fiction, extrapolation allows writers to focus not on the way things are (or were), as non-genre literature does, but on the way things could be different. It provides science fiction with a quality that [[Darko Suvin]] has called "cognitive estrangement": the recognition that what we are reading is not the world as we know it, but a world whose difference forces us to reconsider our own world with an outsider's perspective.&lt;ref name="Suvin cog estrangment"&gt;[[Darko Suvin]]. ''Metamorphoses of Science Fiction'', Yale Univ Pr: 1979 {{ISBN|978-0-300-02375-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the extrapolation involves sexuality or gender, it can force the reader to reconsider their [[heteronormative]] cultural assumptions; the freedom to imagine societies different from real-life cultures makes science fiction an incisive tool to examine sexual bias.&lt;ref name=EoSF/&gt; In science fiction, such estranging features include [[technologies]] that significantly alter sex or reproduction. In fantasy, such features include figures (for example, [[mythological]] deities and heroic [[archetypes]]) who are not limited by preconceptions of human sexuality and gender, allowing them to be reinterpreted.&lt;ref name="glbtq"&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/literature/scifi_fantasy.html glbtq &gt;&gt; literature &gt;&gt; Science Fiction and Fantasy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528020223/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/scifi_fantasy.html |date=2015-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Science fiction has also depicted a plethora of [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] methods of reproduction and sex.&lt;ref name=EoSF/&gt;

''Uranian Worlds'', by [[Eric Garber]] and Lyn Paleo, is an authoritative guide to science fiction literature featuring gay, lesbian, transgender, and related themes. The book covers science fiction literature published before 1990 (2nd edition), providing a short review and commentary on each piece.&lt;ref name="Uranian worlds"&gt;[[Eric Garber]], Lyn Paleo ''Uranian Worlds: A Guide to Alternative Sexuality in Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror'', 2nd Edition, [[G K Hall]]: 1990 {{ISBN|978-0-8161-1832-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SF literature==

===Proto SF===
[[File:carmilla.jpg|thumb|210px|right|Illustration by [[D. H. Friston]] that accompanied the first publication of lesbian vampire novella ''Carmilla'' in ''The Dark Blue'' magazine in 1872]]
''[[True History]],'' a Greek-language tale by [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] writer [[Lucian]] (120-185 CE), has been called the first ever science fiction story.&lt;ref name="Fredericks, S.C."&gt;Fredericks, S.C.: [http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/8/fredericks8art.htm “Lucian's True History as SF”], ''Science Fiction Studies'', Vol. 3, No. 1 (March 1976), pp. 49-60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georgiadou, Aristoula &amp; Larmour, David H.J in their introduction: "...Lucian's Verae Historiae ("True Histories"), a fantastic journey narrative considered the earliest surviving example of Science Fiction in the Western tradition."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gunn, James E. denotes ''True History'' as "Proto-Science Fiction", p.249&lt;/ref&gt; The narrator is suddenly enveloped by a typhoon and swept up to the Moon, which is inhabited by a [[single-gender world|society of men]] who are at war with the Sun. After the hero distinguishes himself in combat, the king gives him his son, the prince, in marriage. The all-male society reproduces (male children only) by giving birth from the thigh or by growing a child from a plant produced by planting the left testicle in the Moon's soil.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Homosexuality"&gt;Wayne R. Dynes, Warren Johansson, William A. Percy, Stephen Donaldson  ''Encyclopedia of Homosexuality'', Pg. 752, Garland Publishing Inc: 1990 {{ISBN|978-0-8240-6544-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="encylhomos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.williamapercy.com/wiki/index.php/Encyclopedia_of_Homosexuality |title= Encyclopedia of Homosexuality - William A.

In other proto-SF works, sex itself, of any type, was equated with base desires or "beastliness," as in ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' (1726), which contrasts the animalistic and overtly sexual Yahoos with the reserved and intelligent Houyhnhnms.&lt;ref name=EoSF/&gt; Early works that showed sexually open characters to be morally impure include the first [[lesbian vampire]] story "[[Carmilla]]" (1872) by [[Sheridan Le Fanu]] (collected in ''[[In a Glass Darkly]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Garber &amp; Paleo, "Carmilla" p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1915 [[utopian and dystopian fiction|utopian]] novel ''[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]'' by [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] depicts the visit by three men to an all-female society in which women reproduce by [[parthenogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===The pulp era (1920–30s)===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Odd John first edition cover.jpg|thumb|150px|Cover of first edition of [[Odd John]] (1935)]] --&gt;
During the [[pulp magazine|pulp]] era, explicit sexuality of any kind was not characteristic of genre science fiction and fantasy. The frank treatment of sexual topics of earlier literature was abandoned.&lt;ref name=EoSF/&gt; For many years, the editors who controlled what was published, such as [[Kay Tarrant]], assistant editor of ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]'', felt that they had to protect the adolescent male readership that they identified as their principal market.&lt;ref name=EoSF/&gt;  Although the covers of some 1930s pulp magazines showed scantily clad women menaced by tentacled aliens, the covers were often more lurid than the magazines' contents.&lt;ref name=EoSF/&gt;  Implied or disguised sexuality was as important as that which was openly revealed.&lt;ref name=EoSF/&gt; In this sense, genre science fiction reflected the social mores of the day, paralleling common prejudices.&lt;ref name=EoSF/&gt; This was particularly true of pulp fiction, more so than literary works of the time.&lt;ref name=EoSF/&gt;

In [[Aldous Huxley]]'s [[dystopian]] novel ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932), natural reproduction has been abolished, with human [[embryo]]s being raised artificially in "hatcheries and conditioning centres." [[Recreational sex]] is promoted, often as a [[group sex|group activity]], and [[marriage]], [[pregnancy]], natural birth, and [[parenting|parenthood]] are considered too [[vulgarity|vulgar]] to be mentioned in polite conversation.

One of the earliest examples of genre science fiction that involves a challenging amount of unconventional sexual activity is ''[[Odd John]]'' (1935) by [[Olaf Stapledon]]. John is a [[mutant]] with extraordinary mental abilities who will not allow himself to be bound by many of the rules imposed by the ordinary British society of his time. The novel strongly implies that he has consensual [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]] with his mother and that he seduces an older boy who becomes devoted to him but also suffers from the affront that the relationship creates to his own morals. John eventually concludes that any sexual interaction with "normal" humans is akin to bestiality.

''[[War with the Newts]]'', a 1936 satirical science fiction novel by [[Czech Republic|Czech]] author [[Karel Čapek]], concerns the discovery in the Pacific of a sea-dwelling race, an intelligent breed of [[newt]]s - who are initially enslaved and exploited by humans and later rebel and go war against them. The book includes a detailed appendix entitled 'The Sex Life of the Newts', which  examines the Newts' sexuality and reproductive processes in a [[pastiche]] of academese. This is one of the first attempts to speculate on what form sex might have among non-human intelligent beings.

===The Golden Age (1940–50s)===
As the readership for science fiction and fantasy [[Golden Age of Science Fiction|began to age in the 1950s]], writers were able to introduce more explicit sexuality into their work.

[[Philip José Farmer]] wrote ''The Lovers'' (1952), arguably the first science fiction story to feature sex as a major theme, and ''Strange Relations'' (1960), a collection of five stories about human/alien sexual relations. In his novel ''[[Flesh (novel)|Flesh]]'' (1960), a hypermasculine antlered man ritually impregnates legions of virgins in order to counter declining male fertility.

[[Theodore Sturgeon]] wrote many stories that emphasised the importance of love regardless of the current social norms, such as "[[The World Well Lost]]" (1953), a classic tale involving alien [[homosexuality]], and the novel ''[[Venus Plus X]]'' (1960), in which a contemporary man awakens in a futuristic place where the people are [[hermaphrodite]]s.

[[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s time-travel short story "[[All You Zombies]]" (1959) chronicles a young man (later revealed to be [[intersex]]) taken back in time and tricked into impregnating his younger, female self before he underwent a sex change. He then turns out to be the offspring of that union, with the paradoxical result that he is both his own mother and father.

When Heinlein's "[[The Puppet Masters]]" was originally published, it was censored by the publisher to remove various references to sex. The opening scene, where the protagonist is called urgently to HQ on an early morning hour, was re-written to remove all mention of his being in bed with a girl he had casually picked up. The published version did mention that the book's alien invaders cause human beings whose bodies they take over to lose sexual feeling - but removed a later section mentioning that after some time on Earth the invaders "discovered sex" and started engaging in wild orgies and even broadcasting them on TV in areas under their control. Thirty years later, with changing mores, Heinlein published the book's full, unexpurgated text. 

In "[[Time Enough for Love#"Da Capo" |Time Enough for Love]]" (1973), Heinlein's recurring protagonist [[Lazarus Long]] - who never grows old and has an extremely long and eventful life - travels backward in time to the period of his own childhood. As an unintentional result, he falls in love with his own mother. He has no guilt feeling about pursuing and eventually consummating that relationship - considering her simply as an extremely attractive young woman named Maureen who just happens to have given birth to him thousands of years ago (as far as his personal timeline is concerned). The sequel,"[[To Sail Beyond the Sunset]]" takes place after Maureen had discovered the true identity of her lover - and shows that for her part, she was more amused than shocked or angry. 
 
[[Poul Anderson]]'s 1958 novel "War of the Wing-Men", centers on a species of winged intelligent creatures and sexual differencws are central to its plot. Of the two mutually-hostile societies featured in the book, one practices monogamous marriage, while in the other there are every spring several days of a wild indiscriminate orgy - and a complete celibacy for the rest of the year. Ironically, both societies alike consider themselves chaste and the other depraved: "We keep faithful to our mates while they fuck around indiscriminately - disgusting!" ; "We keep sex where it belongs, to one week per year where you are not really yourself. They do it all over the year- disgusting!". Humans who land on the planet intervene in the centuries-long war, by showing members of the two societies that they are not all that different from each other.

Another Poul Anderson novel of the same period, ''Virgin Planet'' (1959), deals in a straightforward manner with homosexuality and [[polyamory]] on an exclusively female world. The plot twist is that the protagonist is the only male on a world of women, and though quite a few of them are interested in sex with him, it is never consummated during his sojourn on the planet.

A mirror image was presented by [[A. Bertram Chandler]] in ''Spartan Planet'' (1969), featuring an exclusively male world, where by definition homosexual relations are the normal (and only) sexual relations. The plot revolves around the explosive social upheaval resulting when the planet is discovered by a spaceship from the wider galaxy, whose crew includes both men and women. 

Until the late 1960s, few other writers depicted alternative sexuality or revised gender roles, nor openly investigated sexual questions.&lt;ref name=EoSF/&gt;

More conventionally,  [[A. Bertram Chandler]]'s books include numerous episodes of free fall sex, his characters (male and female alike) strongly prone to extramarital relations and tending to while away the boring months-long Deep Space voyages by forming complicated love triangles.

===The New Wave era (1960–70s)===
By the late 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by the civil rights movement and the emergence of a counterculture. Within the genres, these changes were incorporated into a movement called "the [[New Wave (science fiction)|New Wave]]," a movement more skeptical of technology, more liberated socially, and more interested in stylistic experimentation. New Wave writers were more likely to claim an interest in "inner space" instead of outer space. They were less shy about explicit sexuality and more sympathetic to reconsiderations of gender roles and the social status of sexual minorities. Notable authors who often wrote on sexual themes included [[Joanna Russ]], [[Thomas M. Disch]], [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]], [[James Tiptree, Jr.]], and [[Samuel R. Delany]]. Under the influence of New Wave editors and authors such as [[Michael Moorcock]] (editor of the influential ''[[New Worlds (magazine)|New Worlds]]'' magazine) and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality and gender multiplied in science fiction and fantasy, becoming commonplace.&lt;ref name=EoSF/&gt;

[[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' (1961) and ''[[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress]]'' (1966) both depict heterosexual group marriages and public nudity as desirable social norms, while in Heinlein's ''[[Time Enough for Love]]'' (1973), the main character argues strongly for the future liberty of homosexual sex.&lt;ref name=EoSF/&gt; Heinlein's character [[Lazarus Long]], travelling back in time to the period of his own childhood,  discovers, to his surprise and (initial) shame, a sexual desire of his own mother - but overcoming this initial shame, he comes to think of her simply as "[[Maureen Johnson (Heinlein character)|Maureen]]", an attractive young woman who is far from indifferent to him. 

[[Samuel R. Delany]]'s [[Nebula Award]]-winning short story "[[Aye, and Gomorrah]]" (1967) posits the development of [[Neutering|neutered]] human astronauts, and then depicts the people who become sexually oriented toward them. By imagining a new gender and resultant [[sexual orientation]], the story allows readers to reflect on the real world while maintaining an estranging distance. In his 1975 science fiction novel entitled ''[[Dhalgren]]'', Delany colors his large canvas with characters of a wide variety of sexualities.&lt;ref name="Dhalgrenrev"&gt;David Soyko, "Dhalgren", on-line review (2002) [http://www.sfsite.com/02b/dh122.htm SFSite]&lt;/ref&gt; Once again, sex is not the focus of the novel, although it does contain some of the first explicitly described scenes of [[gay sex]] in science fiction. Delany depicts, mostly with affection, characters with a wide variety of motivations and behaviours, with the effect of revealing to the reader the fact that these kinds of people exist in the real world. In later works, Delany blurs the line between science fiction and gay pornography. Delany faced resistance from book distribution companies for his treatment of these topics.&lt;ref name=EoSF/&gt;

[[Ursula K. Le Guin]] explores radically alternative forms of  sexuality in ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' (1969) and again in "[[The Birthday of the World|Coming of Age in Karhide]]" (1995), which imagine the sexuality of an alien "human" species in which individuals are neither "male" nor "female," but undergo a monthly sexual cycle in which they randomly experience the activation of either male or female sexual organs and reproductive abilities; this makes them in a sense [[bisexual]], and in other senses [[androgynous]] or [[hermaphroditic]]. It is common for an individual of that species to undergo at some moment of life pregnancy and birth-giving. while at another time having the male role and impregnating somebody else.&lt;ref name=EoSF/&gt; Le Guin has written considerations of her own work in two essays, "Is Gender Necessary?" (1976) and "Is Gender Necessary? Redux" (1986), which respond to [[feminist]] and other criticism of ''The Left Hand of Darkness''. In these essays, she makes it clear that the novel's assumption that Gethenians would automatically find a mate of the gender opposite to the gender they were becoming produced an unintended [[heteronormativity]]. Le Guin has subsequently written many stories that examine the possibilities science fiction allows for non-traditional sexuality, such as the sexual bonding between [[cloning|clones]] in "[[Nine Lives (novelette)|Nine Lives]]" (1968)&lt;ref name="encylhomos"/&gt; and the four-way marriages in "[[The Birthday of the World|Mountain Ways]]" (1996).

In his 1972 novel ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'', [[Isaac Asimov]] describes an alien race with three genders, all of them necessary for sexual reproduction. One gender produces a form of sperm, another gender provides the energy needed for reproduction, and members of the third gender bear and raise the offspring. All three genders are included in sexual and social norms of expected and acceptable behavior. In this same novel, the hazards and problems of [[Sex in space|sex in microgravity]] are described, and while people born on the Moon are proficient at it, people from Earth are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gods Themselves |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |edition=reprinted |year=1990 |publisher=Bantam Books |isbn=9780553288100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''Three Worlds to Conquer'' depicts centaur-like beings living on [[Jupiter]] who have three genders: female, male and "demi-male". In order to conceive, a female must have sex with both a male and a demi-male within a short time of each other. In the society of the protagonist, there are stable, harmonious three-way families, in effect a formalized [[Menage a Trois]], with the three partners on equal terms with each other. An individual in that society feels a strong attachment to all three parents - mother, father and demi-father - who all take part in bringing up the young. Conversely, among the harsh invaders who threaten to destroy the protagonist's homeland and culture, males are totally dominant over both females and demi-males; the latter are either killed at birth or preserved in subjugation for reproduction - which the protagonist regards as a barbaric aberration.  

[[Feminist science fiction]] authors imagined cultures in which homo- and bisexuality and a variety of gender models are the norm.&lt;ref name=EoSF/&gt;  [[Joanna Russ]]'s award-winning short story "[[When It Changed]]" (1972), portraying a female-only [[lesbian]] society that flourished without men, and her novel ''[[The Female Man]]'' (1975), were enormously influential.&lt;ref name="UW pg. x"&gt;Eric Garber, Lyn Paleo ''Uranian Worlds: A Guide to Alternative Sexuality in Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror'', "Preface" p. x  G K Hall: 1983 {{ISBN|0-8161-8573-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russ was largely responsible for introducing radical [[lesbian feminism]] into science fiction.&lt;ref name="UW pg. 118"&gt;Eric Garber, Lyn Paleo ''Uranian Worlds: A Guide to Alternative Sexuality in Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror'', "Joanna Russ", p 118, G K Hall: 1983 {{ISBN|978-0-8161-1832-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bisexual female writer Alice Bradley Sheldon, who used [[James Tiptree, Jr.]] as her [[pen name]], explored the [[sexual impulse]] as her main theme.&lt;ref name=EoSF/&gt; Some stories by Tiptree portray humans becoming sexually obsessed with aliens, such as "[[And I Awoke and Found Me Here on the Cold Hill's Side]]" (1972), or aliens being sexually abused. ''[[The Girl Who Was Plugged In]]'' (1973) is an early precursor of [[cyberpunk]] that depicts a relationship via a [[cybernetics|cybernetically]] controlled body. In her award-winning novella ''[[Houston, Houston, Do You Read?]]'' (1976), Tiptree presents a female-only society after the extinction of men from disease. The society lacks stereotypically "male" problems such as [[war]], but is stagnant. The women reproduce via cloning, and consider men to be comical.

In [[Robert Silverberg]]'s novelette ''[[The Way to Spook City]]'' the protagonist meets and has an affair with a woman named Jill, who seems completely human - and convincingly, passionately female human. Increasingly in love with her, he still has a nagging suspicion that she is in fact a disguised member of the mysterious extraterrestrial species known as "Spooks", who had invaded and taken over a large part of the United States. Until the end, he repeatedly grapples with two questions: Is she human or a Spook? And if she is a Spook, could the two of them nevertheless build a life together?  

[[Elizabeth A. Lynn]]'s science fiction novel ''A Different Light'' (1978) features a [[same-sex relationship]] between two men, and inspired the name of the [[LGBT]] bookstore chain [[A Different Light (bookstore)|A Different Light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/l/elizabeth-a-lynn/|title=Elizabeth A Lynn|first=|last=|date=|work=Fantastic Fiction|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/1997/Issues/10/Lynn.html|title=Locus: Elizabeth A. Lynn: A New Spring|author=|year=1977|work=Locus Magazine|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynn's [[The Chronicles of Tornor]] (1979–80) series of novels, the first of which won the [[World Fantasy Award for Best Novel|World Fantasy Award]], were among the first fantasy novels to include gay relationships as an unremarkable part of the cultural background. Lynn also wrote novels depicting [[sadomasochism]].

[[John Varley (author)|John Varley]], who also came to prominence in the 1970s, is another writer who examined sexual themes in his work.&lt;ref name=EoSF/&gt; In his "[[Eight Worlds]]" suite of stories and novels, humanity has achieved the ability to change sex quickly, easily and completely reversibly - leading to a casual attitude with people changing their sex back and forth as the sudden whim takes them. [[Homophobia]] is shown as initially inhibiting the uptake of this technology, as it engenders drastic changes in relationships, with bisexuality becoming the default mode for society. Varley's [[Gaea trilogy]] (1979-1984) features lesbian protagonists.

Female characters in [[science fiction films]], such as ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'' (1968), continued to be often portrayed as simple [[sex kitten]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Tough girls: women warriors and wonder women in popular culture|last= Inness|first= Sherrie A. |authorlink= |year= 1998|publisher= Published by University of Pennsylvania Press|page= 102|isbn=978-0-8122-3466-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern SF (post-New Wave)===
After the pushing back of boundaries in the 1960s and 70s, sex in genre science fiction gained wider acceptance, and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional science fiction stories with little comment.

[[Jack L. Chalker]]'s [[Well World series]], launched in 1977, depicts a world - designed by the super science of a vanished extraterrestrial race, the Markovians - which is divided into numerous "hexes", each inhabited by different sentient race. Anyone entering one of these hexes is transformed into a member of the local race. This plot device gives a wide scope for exploring the divergent biology and cultures of the various species - including their sex life. For example, a human entering a hex inhabited by an insectoid intelligent race is transformed into a female of that species, feels sexual desire for a male and mates with him. Too late does she discover that in this species, pregnancy is fatal - the mother being devoured from the inside by her [[larvae]]. In a later part, a very [[macho]] villain gains control of a supercomputer whose power includes the ability to "redesign" people's bodies to almost any specification. He uses the computer to give himself a "super-virile" body, capable of a virtually unlimited number of erections and ejaculations - and then proceeds to transform his male enemies into beautiful women and induce in them a strong sexual desire towards himself. However, a computer breakdown restores to these captives their normal minds. Though they are still in women's bodies, these bodies were designed with great strength and stamina, so as to enable them to undergo repeated sexual encounters. Thus, they are well-equipped to chase, catch and suitably punish their abuser. 

Set on an alien planet, [[Octavia E. Butler]]'s acclaimed short story "[[Bloodchild and Other Stories|Bloodchild]]" (1984) depicts the complex relationship between human [[refugee]]s and the insect-like aliens who keep them in a [[nature reserve|preserve]] to protect them, but also to use them as [[host (biology)|host]]s for breeding their young. Sometimes called Butler's "pregnant man story," "Bloodchild" won the [[Nebula Award]], [[Hugo Award]], and [[Locus Award]].&lt;ref name="Holden"&gt;Holden, Rebecca J, and Nisi Shawl. ''Strange Matings: Science Fiction, Feminism, African American Voices, and Octavia E. Butler''. Seattle, WA : Aqueduct Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Other of Butler's works explore [[miscegenation]], [[non-consensual sex]], and [[hybridity]].&lt;ref name=Ferreira&gt;Ferreira, Maria Aline. "Symbiotic Bodies and Evolutionary Tropes in the Work of Octavia Butler." ''Science Fiction Studies'' 37. 3 (November 2010): 401-415.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Robert Silverberg]]'s 1982 novella ''Homefaring'', the protagonist enters the mind of an intelligent [[lobster]] of the very far future and experiences all aspects of lobster life, including sex: "He approached a female, knowing precisely which one was the appropriate one, and sang to her, and she acknowledged his song with a song of her own, and raised her third pair of legs for him, and let him plant his [[gamete]]s beside her [[oviduct]]s. There was no apparent pleasure in it, as he remembered pleasure from his time as a human. Yet it brought him a subtle but unmistakable sense of fulfillment, of the completion of biological destiny, that had a kind of orgasmic finality about it, and left him calm and anchored at the absolute dead center of his soul". When finally returning to his human body and his human lover, he keeps longing for the lobster life, to "his mate and her millions of [[larvae]]". 

Quentin and Alice, the extremely shy and insecure protagonists of [[Lev Grossman]]'s fantasy novel ''[[The Magicians (Grossman novel)|The Magicians]]'', spend years as fellow students at a [[List of fictional magic schools|School of Magic]] without admitting to being deeply in love with each other. Only the experience of being magically turned into [[fox]]es enables them at last to break through their reserve: "Increasingly, Quentin noticed one scent more than the others. It was a sharp, acrid, skunky musk that probably would have smelled like cat piss to a human being, but to a fox it was like a drug. He tackled the source of the smell, buried his snuffling muzzle in her fur, because he had known all along, with what was left of his consciousness, that what he was smelling was Alice. Vulpine hormones and instincts were powering up, taking over, manhandling what was left of his rational human mind. He locked his teeth in the thick fur of her neck. It didn't seem to hurt her any, or at least not in a way that was easily distinguishable from pleasure. He caught a glimpse of Alice's wild, dark fox eyes rolling with terror and then half shutting with pleasure. Their tiny quick breathes puffed white in the air and mingled and disappeared. Her white fox fur was coarse and smooth at the same time, and she made little yipping sounds every time he pushed himself deeper inside her. He never wanted to stop"&lt;ref&gt;"The Magicians", Book One, Chapter "Marie Byrd Land"&lt;/ref&gt;. When resuming their human bodies, Quentin and Alice are initially even more shy and awkward with each other, and only after going through some harrowing magical experiences are they finally able to have human sex.   

[[Lois McMaster Bujold]] explores many areas of sexuality in the multiple award-winning novels and stories of her [[Vorkosigan Saga]] (1986-ongoing), which are set in a fictional universe influenced by the availability of [[uterine replicator]]s and significant [[genetic engineering]]. These areas include an all-male society, [[promiscuity]], [[monastic]] [[celibacy]], hermaphroditism, and bisexuality.

In the [[Mythopoeic Award]]-winning novel ''[[Michael Bishop (author)#Unicorn Mountain|Unicorn Mountain]]'' (1988), [[Michael Bishop (author)|Michael Bishop]] includes a gay male [[AIDS]] patient among the carefully drawn central characters who must respond to an [[irruption]] of dying [[unicorn]]s at their Colorado [[ranch]]. The death of the hedonistic [[LGBT culture#gay male culture|gay culture]], and the [[safe sex]] campaign resulting from the AIDS epidemic, are explored, both literally and metaphorically.&lt;ref name="CluteOrbit2"&gt;[[John Clute|Clute, John]]. "SF Novels of the Year." ''The Orbit Science Fiction Yearbook Two''.  Ed. David S. Garnett. London: Futura Books, 1989. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex has a major role in [[Harry Turtledove]]'s 1990 novel ''[[A World of Difference (novel)| A World of Difference]]'', taking place on the planet Minerva (a more habitable analogue of [[Mars]]). Minervan animals (including the [[Sentience|sentient]] Minervans) are [[Symmetry in biology#Hexamerism and octamerism|hexameristically radially symmetrical]]. This means that they have six eyes spaced equally all around, see in all directions and have no "back" where somebody could sneak on them unnoticed. Females (referred to as "mates" by the Minervans) give birth to litters that consist of one male and five females, and the "mates" always die after reproducing because of torrential bleeding from the places where the six [[fetus]]es were attached; this gives a population multiplication of 5 per generation if all females live to adolescence and reproduce. Females reach puberty while still hardly out of childhood, and typically experience sex only once in the lifetime - leading to pregnancy and death at birth-giving. Thus, in Minervan society male dominance seems truly determined by a biological imperative - though it takes different forms in various Minervan societies: in some females are considered expendable and traded as property, in other they are cherished and their tragic fate mourned - but still their dependent status is taken for granted. The American women arriving on Minerva and discovering this situation consider it intolerable; a major plot element is their efforts, using the resources of Earth medical science, to find a way of saving the Minervan females and let them survive birth-giving. At the end, they do manage to save a particularly sympathetic Minervan female - potentially opening the way for a complete upheaval in Minervan society.

''[[Glory Season]]'' (1993) by [[David Brin]] is set on the planet Stratos, inhabited by a strain of human beings designed to conceive clones in winter, and normal children in summer. All clones are female, because males cannot reproduce themselves individually. Further, males and females have opposed seasons of sexual receptivity; women are sexually receptive in winter, and men in summer. (This unusual [[heterogamous]] reproductive cycle is known to be evolutionarily advantageous for some species of [[aphid#reproduction|aphid]]s.) The novel treats themes of [[separatist feminism]] and [[biological determinism]].

[[Elizabeth Bear]]'s novel ''[[Carnival (Bear novel)|Carnival]]'' (2006) revisits the [[trope (literature)|trope]] of the [[single-gender world]], as a pair of gay male ambassador-spies attempt to infiltrate and subvert the predominately lesbian civilization of New Amazonia, whose [[matriarchy|matriarchal]] rulers have all but [[slavery|enslaved]] their men.&lt;ref name="ion Carnival"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/387818/environmental-fascists-fight-gun-loving-lesbians-for-alien-technology |title=Environmental Fascists Fight Gun-Loving Lesbians for Alien Technology |publisher=[[io9]] |first=Annalee |last=Newitz |authorlink=Annalee Newitz |date=May 6, 2008 |accessdate=January 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SF Site Carnival"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sfsite.com/05b/ca248.htm |title=''Carnival'' by Elizabeth Bear |first=Paul |last=Kincaid |work=SF Site |date=2007 |accessdate=January 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot of ''[[The Tamír Triad]]'' by [[Lynn Flewelling]] has a major [[Transsexual]] element. To begin with the protagonist, Prince Tobin, is to all appearances a male - both in his own perception and in that of others. Boys who swim naked together with Tobin have no reason to doubt his male anatomy. Yet, due to the magical reasons which are an important part of the plot, in the underlying, essential identity Tobin had always been a disguised girl. In the series' cataclysmic scene of magical change this becomes an evident physical fact, and Prince Tobin becomes Queen Tamír, shedding the male body and gaining a fully functioning female one. Yet, it takes Tamír a considerable time and effort to come to terms with her female sexuality.

Lateral Magazine, ''The freedom of a genre: Sexuality in speculative fiction'': 'In another twist of today’s society, ''[[Nontraditional Love]]'' by [[Rafael Grugman]] (2008) puts together an upside-down society where heterosexuality is outlawed, and homosexuality is the norm. A ‘traditional’ family unit consists of two dads with a surrogate mother. Alternatively, two mothers, one of whom bares a child. In a nod to the always-progressive Netherlands, this country is the only country progressive enough to allow opposite sex marriage. This is perhaps the most obvious example of cognitive estrangement. It puts the reader in the shoes of the oppressed by modelling an entire world of opposites around a fairly “normal” everyday heterosexual protagonist. A heterosexual reader would not only be able to identify with the main character, but be immersed in a world as oppressive and bigoted as the real world has been for homosexuals and the queer community throughout history.&lt;ref name=Lateral&gt;[http://www.lateralmag.com/articles/issue-8/the-freedom-of-a-genre-sexuality-in-speculative-fiction The freedom of a genre: Sexuality in speculative fiction], Lateral Magazine, March 2016, Issue 8&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Show Boat''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] in two acts, with music by [[Jerome Kern]] and book and lyrics by [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], based on [[Edna Ferber]]'s best-selling [[Show Boat (novel)|novel of the same name]]. The musical follows the lives of the performers, stagehands and dock workers on the ''Cotton Blossom'', a [[Mississippi River]] [[showboat|show boat]], over 40 years from 1887 to 1927. Its themes include racial prejudice and tragic, enduring love. The musical contributed such classic songs as "[[Ol' Man River]]", "[[Make Believe (Jerome Kern song)|Make Believe]]", and "[[Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man]]".

The musical was first produced in 1927 by [[Florenz Ziegfeld]]. The premiere of ''Show Boat'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] was an important event in the history of American musical theatre. It "was a radical departure in musical storytelling, marrying spectacle with seriousness", compared with the trivial and unrealistic [[operetta]]s, light [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedies]] and "Follies"-type musical [[revue]]s that defined Broadway in the 1890s and early 20th century.&lt;ref name=Lahr&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lahr|first=John| title=Mississippi Mud| journal=The New Yorker |date=October 27, 1993 |pages=123–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here we come to a completely new genre – the musical play as distinguished from musical comedy.  Now … the play was the thing, and everything else was subservient to that play. Now … came complete integration of song, humor and production numbers into a single and inextricable artistic entity.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.theatrehistory.com/american/musical030.html "American Musical Theatre: An Introduction"], theatrehistory.com, republished from ''The Complete Book of Light Opera''.

The quality of ''Show Boat'' was recognized immediately by critics, and it is frequently revived. Awards did not exist for Broadway shows in 1927, when the show premiered, or in 1932 when its first revival was staged. Late 20th-century revivals of ''Show Boat'' have won both the [[Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical]] (1995) and the [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best Musical Revival]] (1991).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olivierawards.com/about/previous-winners/view/item98525/olivier-winners-1991/ "Olivier Winners, 1991"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602021406/http://www.olivierawards.com/about/previous-winners/view/item98525/olivier-winners-1991/ |date=2013-06-02 }} olivierawards.com, accessed August 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In doing research for her proposed novel ''[[Show Boat (novel)|Show Boat]]'', writer [[Edna Ferber]] spent several weeks on the ''[[James Adams Floating Theatre|James Adams Floating Palace Theatre]]'' in [[Bath, North Carolina]], gathering material about a disappearing American entertainment venue, the river [[showboat]]. In a few weeks, she gained what she called a "treasure trove of show-boat material, human, touching, true". [[Jerome Kern]] was impressed by the novel and, hoping to adapt it as a musical, asked the critic [[Alexander Woollcott]] to introduce him to Ferber in October 1926. Woollcott introduced them that evening during the intermission of Kern's latest musical, ''Criss Cross''.&lt;ref name=Block&gt;Block, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferber was at first shocked that anyone would want to adapt ''Show Boat'' as a musical. After being assured by Kern that he did not want to adapt it as the typical frivolous "girlie" show of the 1920s, she granted him and his collaborator [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] the rights to set her novel to music. After composing most of the first-act songs, Kern and Hammerstein auditioned their material for producer [[Florenz Ziegfeld]], thinking that he was the person to create the elaborate production they felt necessary for Ferber's sprawling work.&lt;ref name=Kantor&gt;Kantor and Maslon, pp. 112–19&lt;/ref&gt; Ziegfeld was impressed with the show and agreed to produce it, writing the next day, "This is the best musical comedy I have ever been fortunate to get a hold of; I am thrilled to produce it, this show is the opportunity of my life..."&lt;ref name="Kantor"/&gt;''Show Boat'', with its serious and dramatic nature, was considered an unusual choice for Ziegfeld, who was best known for [[revues]] such as the ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]''.

Though Ziegfeld anticipated opening his [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1927)|new theatre]] on Sixth Avenue with ''Show Boat'', the epic nature of the work required an unusually long gestation period and extensive changes during out-of-town tryouts. Impatient with Kern and Hammerstein and worried about the serious tone of the musical (he strongly disliked the songs ''Ol' Man River'' and ''Mis'ry's Comin' Around''), Ziegfeld decided to open [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1927)|his theatre]] in February 1927 with ''[[Rio Rita (musical)|Rio Rita]]'', a musical by Kern's collaborator [[Guy Bolton]]. When ''Rio Rita'' proved to be a success, ''Show Boat'''s [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] opening was delayed until ''Rita'' could be moved to another theatre.&lt;ref name=Bloom&gt;Bloom and Vlastnik, pp. 290–93&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Note: Although the basic plot of ''Show Boat'' has always remained the same, over the years revisions and alterations were made by the creators, and over time by subsequent producers and directors. Some of these revisions were for length and some for convenience, as when a different actor played a certain role and was unable to perform a specialty piece written for the role's creator. Some have been made to reflect contemporary sensitivities toward race, gender and other social issues.

;Act I
In 1887, the show boat ''Cotton Blossom'' arrives at the river dock in [[Natchez, Mississippi]]. The [[Reconstruction era (United States)|Reconstruction era]] had ended a decade earlier, and white-dominated Southern legislatures have imposed [[racial segregation]] and [[Jim Crow]] rules. The boat's owner, Cap'n Andy Hawks, introduces his actors to the crowd on the levee.  A fistfight breaks out between Steve Baker, the leading man of the troupe, and Pete, a rough [[engineer]] who had been making passes at Steve's wife, the leading lady [[Julie Dozier|Julie La Verne]]. Steve knocks Pete down, and Pete swears revenge, suggesting he knows a dark secret about Julie. Cap'n Andy pretends to the shocked crowd that the fight was a preview of one of the melodramas to be performed. The troupe exits with the showboat band, and the crowd follows.

A handsome riverboat gambler, [[Gaylord Ravenal]], appears on the levee and is taken with eighteen-year-old Magnolia ("Nolie") Hawks, an aspiring performer and the daughter of Cap'n Andy and his wife Parthenia Ann (Parthy). Magnolia is likewise smitten with Ravenal ("[[Make Believe (Jerome Kern song)|Make Believe]]"). She seeks advice from Joe, a black dock worker aboard the boat, who has returned from buying flour for his wife Queenie, the ship's cook. He replies that there are "lots like [Ravenal] on the river." As Magnolia goes inside the boat to tell her friend Julie about the handsome stranger, Joe mutters that she ought to ask the river for advice. He and the other dock workers reflect on the wisdom and indifference of "[[Ol' Man River]]", who doesn't seem to care what the world's troubles are, but "jes' keeps rollin' along".

Magnolia finds Julie inside and announces that she's in love. Julie cautions her that this stranger could be just a "no-account river fellow". Magnolia says that if she found out he was "no-account", she'd stop loving him. Julie warns her that it's not that easy to stop loving someone, explaining that she'll always love Steve, singing a few lines of "[[Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man]]". Queenie overhears – she is surprised that Julie knows that song as she has only heard "colored folks" sing it. Magnolia remarks that Julie sings it all the time, and when Queenie asks if she can sing the entire song, Julie obliges.

During the rehearsal for that evening, Julie and Steve learn that the town sheriff is coming to arrest them. Steve takes out a large pocket knife and makes a cut on the back of her hand, sucking the blood and swallowing it. Pete returns with the sheriff, who insists the show cannot proceed because Julie is a [[mulatto]] who has been [[passing (racial identity)|passing]] as white and local law prohibits [[miscegenation|mixed marriages]]. Julie admits that her mother was black, but Steve tells the sheriff that he also has [[One-drop theory|"black blood"]] in him, so their marriage is legal in Mississippi. The troupe backs him up, boosted by the ship's [[Maritime pilot|pilot]] Windy McClain, a longtime friend of the sheriff. The couple have escaped the charge of miscegenation, but they still have to leave the show boat; identified as black, they can no longer perform for the segregated white audience. Cap'n Andy fires Pete, but in spite of his sympathy for Julie and Steve, he cannot violate the law for them.

Ravenal returns and asks for passage on the boat. Andy hires him as the new leading man and assigns his daughter Magnolia as the new leading lady, over her mother's objections. As Magnolia and Ravenal begin to rehearse their roles and in the process, kiss for the first time (infuriating Parthy), Joe reprises the last few lines of "Ol' Man River".

Weeks later, Magnolia and Ravenal have been a hit with the crowds and have fallen in love. As the levee workers hum "Ol' Man River" in the background, he proposes to Magnolia, and she accepts. The couple joyously sings "[[You Are Love]]". They make plans to marry the next day while Parthy, who disapproves, is out of town. Parthy has discovered that Ravenal once killed a man and arrives with the Sheriff to interrupt the wedding festivities. The group learns that Ravenal was acquitted of murder. Cap'n Andy calls Parthy "narrow-minded" and defends Ravenal by announcing that he also once killed a man. Parthy faints, but the ceremony proceeds.

;Act II
Six years have passed, and it is 1893. Ravenal and Magnolia have moved to [[Chicago]], where they make a precarious living from Ravenal's gambling. At first they are rich and enjoying the good life ("Why Do I Love You?") By 1903, they have a daughter, Kim, and after years of varying income, they are broke and rent a room in a boarding house. Depressed over his inability to support his family, Ravenal abandons Magnolia and Kim.  Frank and Ellie, two former actors from the showboat, learn that Magnolia is living in the rooms they want to rent. The old friends seek a singing job for Magnolia at the Trocadero, the club where they are doing a New Year's show. Julie is working there. She has fallen into drinking after having been abandoned by Steve. At a rehearsal, she tries out the new song "[[Bill (Show Boat)|Bill]]." She appears to be thinking of Steve and sings it with great emotion. From her dressing-room, she hears Magnolia singing "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man" for her audition, the song which Julie taught her years ago. Julie secretly quits her job so that Magnolia can fill it, without learning of her sacrifice. 

Ravenal visit his daughter Kim at the convent where she goes to school to say goodbye before leaving her forever ("Make Believe" (reprise)). On New Year's Eve, Andy and Parthy go to Chicago for a surprise visit to their daughter Magnolia. He goes to the Trocadero without his wife, and sees Magnolia overcome with emotion and nearly booed off stage. Andy rallies the crowd by starting a sing-along of the standard, "[[After the Ball (song)|After the Ball]]". Magnolia becomes a great musical star.

More than 20 years pass, and it is 1927. An aged Joe on the ''Cotton Blossom'' sings a reprise of "Ol' Man River". Cap'n Andy has a chance meeting with Ravenal and arranges his reunion with Magnolia. Andy knows that Magnolia is retiring and returning to the ''Cotton Blossom'' with Kim, who has become a Broadway star. Kim gives her admirers a taste of her performing abilities by singing an updated, [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] version of "Why Do I Love You?" Ravenal sings a reprise of "You Are Love" to the offstage Magnolia. Although he is uncertain about asking her to take him back, Magnolia, who has never stopped loving him, greets him warmly and does. As the happy couple walks up the boat's gangplank, Joe and the cast sing the last verse of "Ol' Man River".

;Plot variants in 1951 film
The [[Show Boat (1951 film)|1951 MGM film]] changed the final scenes of the story, as well as many small details. It reconciles Ravenal and Magnolia a few years after they separate, rather than 23. When Ravenal leaves Magnolia in Chicago, she is pregnant.  By a chance meeting with Julie, Ravenal learns that Magnolia gave birth to his daughter. He returns to her and sees the child Kim playing. Magnolia sees them together and takes him back, and the family returns to the show boat. Joe and the chorus start singing "Ol' Man River" as the scenes unfold, then the paddlewheel starts turning in tempo with the music, as the ship heads down river. Julie is shown, viewing from a distance. She had watched the scene from the shadows.

===History of revisions===
The original production ran four-and-a-half hours during tryouts but was trimmed to just over three by the time it got to Broadway. During previews, two songs, "[[Mis'ry's Comin' Aroun]]" and "Let's Start the New Year", were cut from the show. "Mis'ry's Comin' Aroun" was published in the complete vocal score&lt;ref name=Block2&gt;Block, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and fragments of it are also heard in the scoring, notably in the original 1927 overture and in the miscegenation scene. The song "Be Happy, Too" was also cut after the Washington, D.C., tryout&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ovrtur.com/song/100013326 "Be Happy, Too"], Ovrtur.com, accessed January 16, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The 1988 studio cast album reinstated the entire song, and it was also included in the 1994 [[Hal Prince]] revival. "Let's Start the New Year" was performed in the 1989 [[Paper Mill Playhouse]] production.

Two songs, "Till Good Luck Comes My Way" (sung by Ravenal) and "Hey Feller!" (sung by Queenie), were written mainly to cover scenery changes. They were discarded beginning with the 1946 revival, although "Till Good Luck" was included in the 1993 [[Harold Prince]] revival of the show. The comedy song, "I Might Fall Back On You," was also cut beginning in 1946. It was restored in the 1951 film version and several stage productions since the 1980s. On record, "Hey Feller!" appears only on the 1988 [[EMI]] album. Kern and Hammerstein wrote two new songs for revivals and three more for the 1936 film version.&lt;!-- Please don't repeat information here that is already included in the bullet points below, unless you are reorganizing the information into better narrative paragraphs. --&gt;

The [[Harold Fielding]] production in London in the early 1970s claimed to use the entire original score, but it omitted "Hey, Feller!" and "In Dahomey", among others. This cast album broke ground in being the first two-LP version of ''Show Boat'' ever released.

The score also includes four songs not originally written for ''Show Boat'': "[[Bill (Show Boat)|Bill]]" was originally written by Kern and [[P.&amp;nbsp;G. Wodehouse]] in 1917 and was reworked by Hammerstein for ''Show Boat''. Two other songs not by Kern and Hammerstein, "Goodbye, My Lady Love" by [[Joseph E. Howard]] and "[[After the Ball (song)|After the Ball]]" by [[Charles K. Harris]], were included by the authors for historical atmosphere and are included in revivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tinpanalleyproject.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=25 |title=After the Ball |publisher=Tin Pan Alley Project |accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Year's Eve scene features an instrumental version of "[[There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight]]".

Some of the following numbers have been cut or revised in subsequent productions, as noted below (the songs "Ol' Man River", "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man", and "[[Bill (Show Boat)|Bill]]" have been included in every stage and film production of ''Show Boat''):
* Overture – The original overture, used in all stage productions up to 1946 (and heard on the three-disc EMI/Angel CD for the first time in nearly 50 years), is based chiefly on the deleted song "[[Mis'ry's Comin' Round]]", as Kern wanted to save this song in some form. The song was restored in the Harold Prince 1994 revival of the show. The overture also contains fragments of "Ol' Man River", "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man", and a faster arrangement of "Why Do I Love You?" The overtures for the 1946 revival and the 1966 Lincoln Center revival consist of medleys of songs from the show. All three overtures were arranged by the show's orchestrator, [[Robert Russell Bennett]], who orchestrated most of Kern's later shows.
* "Cotton Blossom" – This number is performed in all the stage productions, and shorter versions were used in the 1936 and 1951 film versions.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Knapp. ''The American Musical'', 2005: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not used in the 1929 film version.
* "Where's the Mate for Me?" – Ravenal's first song; heard in all stage versions, partially sung in the 1936 film version, and sung complete in the 1951 film version. Not sung in the 1929 film version.
* "[[Make Believe (Jerome Kern song)|Make Believe]]" – Performed in all stage versions, and in the 1936 and 1951 film versions, but not the 1929 film version.
* "Life Upon the Wicked Stage" – This comic song is usually included in stage versions but is heard in the 1936 film only in the orchestral score. Not included in the 1929 film, it is sung and danced in the 1951 film version.
* "Till Good Luck Comes My Way" – Kern and Hammerstein cut it from the 1946 revival, but it was reinstated in the 1971 London stage revival. It is performed instrumentally in the 1936 film and is omitted altogether in the 1929 and 1951 films.
* "I Might Fall Back on You" – This was usually cut after 1946, but it has been reinstated in revivals beginning in 1966. It was absent from the 1929 and 1936 films but included in the 1951 film.
* "C'mon Folks (Queenie's Ballyhoo)" – Always included in the show, it was sung in the prologue to the 1929 film version,&lt;ref name="first film"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020402/soundtrack |title=Soundtracks for Show Boat (1929) |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was omitted from the 1936 film and performed instrumentally in the 1951 film.
* "Olio Dance" – This is rarely performed now, since it was composed simply to cover a change of scenery. It is an orchestral piece that partially uses the melody of "I Might Fall Back on You" and can be heard on the EMI 3-CD album (as "Villain Dance"). The 1936 film substituted the new Kern-Hammerstein number "Gallivantin' Around", performed as an [[Olio (musical number)|olio]] by [[Irene Dunne]] (as Magnolia) in blackface. It was omitted from the 1989 PBS [[Paper Mill Playhouse]] production. Some modern productions move the song "I Might Fall Back on You" to this spot.
* "You Are Love" – Kern considered this popular waltz to be the score's weakest song: he tried unsuccessfully to eliminate it from the 1936 film version. It has never been cut from any stage production. It was shortened, and the introductory section was omitted, in both the 1936 and the 1951 films. It was not performed in the 1929 film.
* "Act I Finale" – This was shortened in the 1936 film and omitted from the 1929 and 1951 films. Its midsection, banjo-dominant, buck-and-wing dance theme became a repeating motif in the 1951 film, played onstage during the backstage miscegenation scene, and later as a soft-shoe dance for Cap'n Andy and granddaughter Kim.
* "At the Chicago World's Fair" – Used in all stage productions except for the Harold Prince 1994 revival, it was omitted from all the film versions, but an instrumental version was performed in the 1936 film.
* "Why Do I Love You?" – Used in all stage versions, this number was sung during the exit music to the 1929 film;&lt;ref name="first film"/&gt; it was performed only as background music for the 1936 film and was sung in the 1951 film version. In the 1994 Hal Prince revival, it was sung by Parthy.
* "[[In Dahomey#Song from Show Boat|In Dahomey]]" – This was cut from the score after the 1946 Broadway production and has not been revived as it is viewed as racially offensive as well as unnecessary to the plot. It is sung at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]] by a group of supposedly African natives. They chant in a supposed African language before breaking into modern English, singing about how glad they are to return to their apartments after the day's performance. It was not used in any film version of the show but was included in the complete 1988 EMI recording and in a 1993 studio recording on the Jay label of the 1946 score.
* "Goodbye, My Lady Love" – This is used only in American productions. It is included in the 1936 film, but not in the 1929 or 1951 films.
* "[[After the Ball (song)|After the Ball]]" – Performed in all stage productions and in both the 1936 and 1951 films, but not the 1929 one.
* "Hey, Feller" – Used in nearly all stage productions up until 1946, and sung in the prologue to the 1929 film.&lt;ref name="first film"/&gt; Not used in the 1936 film, but used as background score in the 1951 film during the opening post-credits scene as the show boat arrives.
Additional numbers have been included in films and revivals as follows:
* "[[Mis'ry's Comin' Round]]" – Though this was cut from the original production, Kern ensured that it was published in the complete vocal score.&lt;ref name=Block/&gt; The 1988 album reinstated it, and it was also included in the 1994 Hal Prince revival.
* "Let's Start the New Year" – Cut from the original production but performed in the 1989 Paper Mill Playhouse production.
* "I Have The Room Above Her" is a romantic duet written by Kern and Hammerstein for Ravenal and Magnolia in the 1936 film. It was included in the 1994 Broadway revival.
* "Gallivantin' Around" is a cakewalk-style number written by Kern and Hammerstein for Magnolia for the 1936 film.
* "Ah Still Suits Me" is a comic duet written by Kern and Hammerstein for the 1936 film and sung by the characters Joe and Queenie (Paul Robeson and [[Hattie McDaniel]]). The number was also included in the 1989 Paper Mill Playhouse production.&lt;ref name="Klein"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/11/nyregion/theater-a-show-boat-as-it-s-meant-to-be.html |title=Theater; A 'Show Boat' as It's Meant to Be |last=Klein |first=Alvin |date=June 11, 1989 |publisher=''New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[Nobody Else But Me]]" was written by Kern and Hammerstein for the 1946 Broadway revival, to be sung in the spot where Kim usually sings a reprise of "Why Do I Love You". This was the last song written by Kern; he died shortly before the 1946 production opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/show-boat-1946-broadway-revival-cast |title=Album Review:Show Boat 1946 Broadway Revival Cast |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=May 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1971 London stage revival, the song was sung by Julie, in a new scene written especially for that production. It is not sung in any film version of the show but was frequently heard in stage revivals up until about the 1980s.
* "Dandies on Parade" is a dance number arranged for the 1994 Broadway production by David Krane, largely from Kern's music.

The locations included the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], the [[Regional Enterprise Tower#Nixon Theater|Nixon Theatre]] in [[Pittsburgh]], the [[Ohio Theatre (Cleveland, Ohio)|Ohio Theatre]] in [[Cleveland]], and the [[Erlanger Theatre]] in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=Vancheri&gt;Vancheri, Barbara.

New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 226–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The show opened on Broadway at the [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1927)|Ziegfeld Theatre]] on December 27, 1927. The critics were immediately enthusiastic, and the show was a great popular success, running a year and a half, for a total of 572 performances.

The production was staged by Oscar Hammerstein&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref&gt;Zeke Colvan was officially credited as director of the production, but in his 1977 book ''Show Boat: The History of a Classic American Musical'', musical historian [[Miles Kreuger]] says that when he interviewed Oscar Hammerstein&amp;nbsp;II months before the latter's death, the always modest Hammerstein admitted that now that Colvan was dead, he could finally state that it was he (Hammerstein) who had directed the original production of the show, and that Colvan had actually served as stage manager.&lt;/ref&gt; Choreography for the show was by Sammy Lee. The original cast included [[Norma Terris]] as Magnolia Hawks and her daughter Kim (as an adult), [[Howard Marsh]] as Gaylord Ravenal, [[Helen Morgan]] as Julie LaVerne, [[Jules Bledsoe]] as Joe, [[Charles Winninger]] as Cap'n Andy Hawks, [[Edna May Oliver]] as Parthy Ann Hawks, [[Sammy White (actor)|Sammy White]] as Frank Schultz, [[Eva Puck]] as Ellie May Chipley, and [[Tess Gardella]] as Queenie. The orchestrator was [[Robert Russell Bennett]], and the conductor was [[Victor Baravalle]]. The [[scenic design]] for the original production was by [[Joseph Urban]], who had worked with Ziegfeld for many years in his ''[[Ziegfeld Follies|Follies]]'' and had designed the elaborate new Ziegfeld Theatre itself.

In his opening night review for the ''[[New York Times]]'', [[Brooks Atkinson]] called the book's adaptation "intelligently made", and the production one of "unimpeachable skill and taste". He termed Terris "a revelation"; Winninger "extraordinarily persuasive and convincing"; and Bledsoe's singing "remarkably effective".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?_r=1&amp;html_title=&amp;tols_title=SHOW%20BOAT%20(PLAY)&amp;pdate=19271228&amp;byline=By%20J.%20BROOKS%20ATKINSON&amp;id=1077011431418&amp;oref=slogin|title=Show Boat|last=Atkinson |first=J.

===Paul Robeson===
The character Joe, the [[stevedore]] who sings "Ol' Man River", was expanded from the novel and written specifically by Kern and Hammerstein for [[Paul Robeson]], already a noted actor and singer. Although he is the actor most identified with the role and the song, he was unavailable for the original production due to its opening delay. Jules Bledsoe premiered the part. Robeson played Joe in four notable productions of ''Show Boat'': the 1928 London premier production, the 1932 Broadway revival, the 1936 film version and a 1940 stage revival in [[Los Angeles]].

Reviewing the 1932 Broadway revival, the critic [[Brooks Atkinson]] described Robeson's performance: "Mr.&amp;nbsp;Robeson has a touch of genius. It is not merely his voice, which is one of the richest organs on the stage. It is his understanding that gives 'Old Man River' an epic lift. When he sings...you realize that Jerome Kern's spiritual has reached its final expression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1932/05/20/archives/the-play-show-boat-as-good-as-new.html?sq=Show%2520Boat%2520%2520revival&amp;scp=9&amp;st=cse |title=THE PLAY; Show Boat" as Good as New.  |last=Atkinson |first=J.

===American revivals and 1936 film===
[[File:Show Boat (1936 Film) Opening Title.jpg|thumb|Opening title from the 1936 film version.]] After closing at the Ziegfeld Theatre in 1929, the original production toured extensively. The national company is notable for including [[Irene Dunne]] as Magnolia. [[Hattie McDaniel]] played Queenie in a 1933 West Coast production, joined by tenor [[Allan Jones (actor)|Allan Jones]] as Ravenal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/928-show-boat "Show Boat"], Criterion Collection, Accessed November 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunne was soon offered a contract by [[RKO Studios]] and appeared in the 1936 [[Universal Studios]] film adaptation of ''Show Boat'', as did Jones as Ravenal, McDaniel as Queenie and Robeson as Joe. The film also featured Winninger (Cap'n Andy), Morgan (Julie), White (Frank), and Francis&amp;nbsp;X. Mahoney (Rubberface) recreating their original Broadway stage roles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028249/ Show Boat], IMDB.com, Accessed November 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

''Show Boat'' was [[revival (play)|revived]] by Ziegfeld on Broadway in 1932 at the [[Earl Carroll Theatre|Casino Theatre]] with most of the original cast, but with Paul Robeson as Joe&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glopad.org/pi/en/image/1003422 Advertisement for ''Show Boat''] 1932, Global Performing Arts Database, accessed April 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dennis King (actor)|Dennis King]] as Ravenal.

In 1946, a major new Broadway revival was produced by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II at the show's original home, the Ziegfeld Theatre. The 1946 revival featured a revised score and new song by Kern and Hammerstein, and a new overture and orchestrations by Robert Russell Bennett. The show was directed by Hammerstein and [[Hassard Short]] and featured [[Jan Clayton]] (Magnolia), Charles Fredricks (Ravenal), [[Carol Bruce]] (Julie), [[Kenneth Lee Spencer|Kenneth Spencer]] (Joe), [[Helen Dowdy]] (Queenie), and [[Buddy Ebsen]] (Frank). The successful production ran for 418 performances and then toured extensively. Kern, however, died just weeks before the January 5, 1946 opening, making it the last show he worked on.

Additional New York revivals were produced in 1948 and 1954 at the [[New York City Center]]. The [[Music Theater of Lincoln Center]] company produced ''Show Boat'' in 1966 at the [[David H. Koch Theater|New York State Theater]] in a new production. It starred [[Barbara Cook]] (Magnolia), [[Constance Towers]] (Julie), [[Stephen Douglass]] (Ravenal), [[David Wayne]] (Cap'n Andy), [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]] (Parthy) and [[William Warfield]] (Joe). It was produced by [[Richard Rodgers]], and Robert Russell Bennett once again provided a new overture and revised orchestrations.

1983 brought a production at the [[Kennedy Center]], Washington, D.C., that starred [[Mickey Rooney]] as Cap'n Andy, and another at the [[George Gershwin Theatre|Uris Theatre]] in New York. The latter revival was presented by [[Douglas Urbanski]] and starred [[Donald O'Connor]] as Cap'n Andy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=4269 Broadway.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 the [[Paper Mill Playhouse]] of [[Millburn, New Jersey]], mounted a production which was noted for its intention to restore the show in accordance with the creators' original intentions. The production restored part of the original 1927 overture and one number discarded from the show after the Broadway opening, as well as the song ''Ah Still Suits Me'', written by Kern and Hammerstein for the 1936 film version. It was directed by Robert Johanson and starred [[Eddie Bracken]] as Cap'n Andy. The Paper Mill production was preserved on videotape and broadcast on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]].&lt;ref name="Klein"/&gt;

Livent Inc. presented the most recent major production of ''Show Boat'' on Broadway in 1994. Produced and directed by [[Harold Prince]], it premiered in [[Toronto]], Ontario, in 1993 prior to opening in New York on October 2, 1994, at the [[George Gershwin Theatre]]. It ran for 947 performances, Broadway's longest-running ''Show Boat'' to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=4269 |title=Show Boat |publisher=Internet Broadway Database |accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This production went on tour, playing at the Kennedy Center; and it was also staged in London and Melbourne, Australia. Prince's production revived interest in the show by tightening the book, dropping and adding songs cut in various productions, and highlighting its racial elements. Perhaps the most notable change in the score was Prince's transforming "Why Do I Love You?" from a duet between Magnolia and Ravenal to a lullaby sung by Parthy Ann to Magnolia's baby girl. The change was partly to accommodate the song's being performed by stage actress [[Elaine Stritch]]. The love duet for Magnolia and Ravenal, "I Have the Room Above Her", originally written by Kern and Hammerstein for the 1936 film, was added to the production. Two new mime and dance "Montages" in Act 2 depicted the passage of time through changing styles of dance and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Prince at the Helm | author=Barbara Isenberg |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=October 9, 1994 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-10-09/entertainment/ca-48293_1_show-boat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===London productions===
The original London [[West End theatre|West End]] production of ''Show Boat'' opened May 3, 1928, at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] and featured among the cast, [[Cedric Hardwicke]] as Capt. Andy, [[Edith Day]] as Magnolia, Paul Robeson as Joe, and [[Alberta Hunter]] as Queenie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ovrtur.com/production/2882553 |title=Show Boat, London Production, 1928 |publisher=ovrtur.com |accessdate=June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mabel Mercer]], later famed as a cabaret singer, was in the chorus. Other West End presentations include a 1971 production at the [[Adelphi Theatre]], which ran for 909 performances.&lt;ref name=Kreuger/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/london_shows_chronology/1971.htm Information about 1971 West End revival]&lt;/ref&gt;

A production was transferred from [[Sheffield]]'s [[Crucible Theatre]] to London's [[New London Theatre]] with previews beginning on April 9, 2016, and an official opening on April 25 2016. It was directed by [[Daniel Evans (actor)|Daniel Evans]] using the [[Goodspeed Musicals]] version of the show.

==Adaptations==

===Film and television===
''Show Boat'' has been adapted for film three times, and for television once.

[[File:Show boat.jpeg|thumb|left|French poster from the 1951 MGM film version of "Show Boat"]]
* 1929 ''[[Show Boat (1929 film)|Show Boat]]''. [[Universal Pictures|Universal]]. Released in silent and partial sound versions. Not a film version of the musical; its plot is based on the original Edna Ferber novel. Immediately after the silent film was completed, a prologue with some music from the show was filmed and added to a part-talkie version of the same film, which was released with two sound sequences.
* 1936 ''[[Show Boat (1936 film)|Show Boat]]''. [[Universal Pictures|Universal]]. Directed by [[James Whale]]. A mostly faithful film version of the show, featuring four members of the original Broadway cast. Screenplay by Oscar Hammerstein II; music arrangements by Robert Russell Bennett; music direction and conducting by Victor Baraville.
* 1946 ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]''. [[MGM]]. In this fictionalized film biography of composer Jerome Kern (played by [[Robert Walker (actor, born 1918)|Robert Walker]]), ''Show Boat'''s 1927 opening night on Broadway is depicted in a lavishly staged fifteen-minute medley of six of the show's songs. The number features [[Kathryn Grayson]], [[Tony Martin (entertainer)|Tony Martin]], [[Lena Horne]], [[Virginia O'Brien]], Caleb Peterson, and William Halligan as, respectively, Magnolia, Ravenal, Julie, Ellie, Joe, and Cap'n Andy.
* 1951 ''[[Show Boat (1951 film)|Show Boat]]''. [[MGM]]. Somewhat revised Technicolor film version. Follows the basic storyline and contains many songs from the show but makes many changes in the details of plot and character. The most financially successful and frequently revived of the three film versions.
* 1989 A live performance by the [[Paper Mill Playhouse]] was videotaped for television and shown on [[Great Performances]] on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. It contains more of the songs (and fewer cuts) than any of the film versions. It includes the choral number "Let's Start the New Year", which was dropped from the show before its Broadway opening, and "Ah Still Suits Me", a song written by Kern and Hammerstein for the 1936 film version of the show.&lt;ref name="Klein"/&gt;

===Radio===
''Show Boat'' was adapted for [[live radio]] at least seven times. Due to network censorship rules, many of the radio productions eliminated the miscegenation aspect of the plot. Notable exceptions were the 1940 ''Cavalcade of America'' broadcast&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldtimeradio-in-tx.homedns.org/otr/cavalcade%20of%20america4/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726152905/http://oldtimeradio-in-tx.homedns.org/otr/cavalcade%20of%20america4/ |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1952 ''[[Lux Radio Theatre]]'' broadcast.

* ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]'' ([[CBS Radio]], March 31, 1939). Directed and introduced by [[Orson Welles]]. This was a non-musical version of the story that was based more closely on Edna Ferber's novel than on the musical. From the original stage cast [[Helen Morgan]] repeated her portrayal of Julie, here singing one song not from the musical. Welles portrayed Cap'n Andy, [[Margaret Sullavan]] was Magnolia, and author Edna Ferber made her acting debut as Parthy. This version made Julie into an illegal alien who must be deported.
* ''[[Cavalcade of America]]'' ([[NBC Radio]], May 28, 1940). A half-hour dramatization with Jeanette Nolan, John McIntire, [[Agnes Moorehead]] and the Ken Christy Chorus. Although brief, it was remarkably faithful to the original show.
* ''[[Lux Radio Theatre]]'' (CBS, June 1940). Introduced and produced by [[Cecil B. DeMille]], it featured [[Irene Dunne]], [[Allan Jones (actor)|Allan Jones]], and [[Charles Winninger]], all of whom were in the 1936 film version. In this condensed version some songs from the show were sung, but Julie was played by a non-singing Gloria Holden. This version made the biracial Julie a single woman. Only a few lines of ''Ol' Man River'' were heard, sung by a chorus. While supposedly based on the 1936 film, this production used the ending of the original show, which the film did not use.
* ''[[Radio Hall of Fame (radio program)|Radio Hall of Fame]]'' (1944). This production featured Kathryn Grayson, playing Magnolia for the first time.&lt;ref name=Kreuger/&gt; Also in the cast were Allan Jones as Ravenal, [[Helen Forrest]] as Julie, Charles Winninger as Cap'n Andy, Ernest Whitman as Joe, and [[Elvia Allman]] as Parthy.
* ''[[The Railroad Hour]]'' ([[ABC News Radio|ABC Radio]], 1950). Condensed to a half-hour, this version featured singers [[Dorothy Kirsten]], [[Gordon MacRae]], and Lucille Norman. "Ol' Man River" was sung by MacRae instead of by an African-American singer. Explanation of Julie and Steve's departure went completely unmentioned in this version.
* ''[[Lux Radio Theatre]]'' (CBS, February 1952). A radio version of the 1951 [[MGM]] film featuring [[Kathryn Grayson]], [[Ava Gardner]], [[Howard Keel]], and [[William Warfield]] from the film's cast. [[Jay C. Flippen]] portrayed Cap'n Andy. This version was extremely faithful to the 1951 film adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/Lux17&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2011, a two-part version was broadcast on [[BBC Radio&amp;nbsp;4]] in the Classic Serial spot. Solely based on the novel by [[Edna Ferber]], it was dramatized by Moya O'Shea, and was produced and directed by Tracey Neale. It starred [[Samantha Spiro]] as Magnolia, Ryan McCluskey as Ravenal, [[Nonso Anozie]] as Joe, [[Tracy Ifeachor]] as Queenie, Laurel Lefkow as Parthy, Morgan Deare as Cap'n Andy and [[Lysette Anthony]] as Kim. Original music was by [[Neil Brand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00yn83n "'Show Boat', Episode 1 of 2, 20 Feb 2011 and 26 Feb 2011"] bbc.co.uk, accessed Febriaru 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* On June 16, 2012, a revival of the musical by [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]] was broadcast by [[WFMT]]-Radio of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lyricopera.org/watchandlisten/broadcasts.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603011156/http://www.lyricopera.org/watchandlisten/broadcasts.aspx |archivedate=2012-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This production of ''Show Boat'' reinstated the songs ''Mis'ry's Comin' Round'', ''Till Good Luck Comes My Way'' and ''Hey, Feller!''. It marked the first time a virtually complete version of ''Show Boat'' had ever been broadcast on radio.

===Concert hall===
* In 1941, the [[Cleveland Orchestra]], under the direction of [[Artur Rodziński]], premiered the orchestral work ''Show Boat: A Scenario for Orchestra '', a 22-minute orchestral work weaving together many themes from the show. Rodziński and the orchestra recorded it that same year&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/KernShowBoat-AScenarioForOrchestra&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been several modern recordings of the work since, notably one by [[John Mauceri]] and the [[Hollywood Bowl Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/1453173/a/Hollywood+Bowl+On+Broadway.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected recordings==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2015}}
[[File:TillCloudsRollBy01.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Lena Horne]] as Julie LaVerne in a scene from ''Show Boat'' in ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]'' (1946)]]
* '''1928''' – original [[London]] cast album, with the show's original orchestrations. This was released in England on 78 rpm records years before being sold in the United States. Because the U.S. had not yet begun making [[original cast album]]s of Broadway shows, the 1927 Broadway cast as a whole was never recorded performing the songs, although Jules Bledsoe, Helen Morgan, and Tess Gardella did record individual numbers from it. The cast on the 1928 London album included [[Edith Day]], Howett Worster, Marie Burke and [[Alberta Hunter]]. Due to contractual restrictions, cast member [[Paul Robeson]] was replaced on the album as Joe by his understudy, baritone Norris Smith. But that same year, Robeson, with the same chorus that accompanied him in the show, did record "Ol' Man River" in its original orchestration. That recording was later released separately. His rendition appears on the [[EMI]] [[CD]] "Paul Robeson Sings 'Ol' Man River' and Other Favorites".
* '''1932''' – [[studio recording|studio cast recording]] on 78rpm by [[Brunswick Records]]. Later re-released by [[Columbia Records]] on 78rpm, 33-1/3rpm and briefly on CD. This recording featured Helen Morgan, Paul Robeson, [[James Melton]], Frank Munn, and Countess Olga Albani, and was issued in conjunction with the 1932 revival of the show, although it was not strictly an "original cast" album of that revival. The orchestra was conducted by [[Victor Young]], and the original orchestrations and vocal arrangements were not used.
* '''1946''' – Broadway revival cast recording. Issued on 78rpm, LP and CD. The 78-RPM and LP versions were issued by Columbia, the CD by [[Sony]]. This was the first American recording of ''Show Boat'' which used the cast, conductor, and orchestrations of a major Broadway revival of the show. (Robert Russell Bennett's orchestrations for this revival thoroughly modified his original 1927 orchestrations.) [[Jan Clayton]], [[Carol Bruce]], [[Charles Fredericks (actor)|Charles Fredericks]], [[Kenneth Lee Spencer|Kenneth Spencer]], and Colette Lyons were featured. [[Buddy Ebsen]] also appeared in the revival, but not on the album. Includes the new song "Nobody Else But Me".
* '''1951''' – [[MGM Records]] [[soundtrack album]], with cast members of the [[Show Boat (1951 film)|1951 film version]]. The first film soundtrack of ''Show Boat'' to be issued on records. Appeared both on 45rpm and 33-1/3rpm, later on CD in a much expanded edition. Actress [[Ava Gardner]], whose singing voice was replaced by Annette Warren's in the film, is heard singing on this album. The expanded version on CD contains both Warren's and Gardner's vocal tracks. This marked the recording debut of William Warfield, who played Joe and sang "Ol' Man River" in the film. Orchestrations were by [[Conrad Salinger]], [[Robert Franklyn]], and [[Alexander Courage]].
* '''1956''' – [[RCA Victor]] studio cast album conducted by [[Lehman Engel]]. This album featured more of the score on one LP than had been previously recorded. It featured a white singer, famed American [[baritone]] [[Robert Merrill]], as both Joe and Gaylord Ravenal. Other singers included [[Patrice Munsel]] as Magnolia and [[Rise Stevens]] as Julie. Issued on CD in 2009, but omitting Frank and Ellie's numbers, which had been sung on the LP version by [[Janet Pavek]] and [[Kevin Scott (singer-actor)|Kevin Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002QEXN0M&lt;/ref&gt; The original orchestrations were not used.
* '''1958''' – RCA Victor studio cast album. The first ''Show Boat'' in stereo, this recording starred Howard Keel (singing "Ol' Man River" as well as Gaylord Ravenal's songs), [[Anne Jeffreys]], and [[Gogi Grant]], and did not use the original orchestrations. It was issued on CD in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003PIUC9I?qi&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1959''' – EMI British [[Show Boat (1959 Studio cast album)|studio cast album]]. It featured Marlys Walters as Magnolia, Don McKay as Ravenal, [[Shirley Bassey]] as Julie, [[Dora Bryan]] as Ellie, and [[Inia Te Wiata]] singing "Ol' Man River".
* '''1962''' – Columbia studio cast album. Starring [[Barbara Cook]], [[John Raitt]], [[Anita Darian]], and William Warfield, this was the first "Show Boat" recording issued on CD. Although Robert Russell Bennett was uncredited, this used several of his orchestrations for the 1946 revival of the show, together with some modifications.
* '''1966''' – Lincoln Center cast album. Issued by RCA Victor, it featured Cook, [[Constance Towers]], [[Stephen Douglass]], and William Warfield. Robert Russell Bennett's orchestrations were modified even further. Also available on CD.
* '''1971''' – London revival cast album. Jazz singer [[Cleo Laine]], soprano Lorna Dallas, tenor Andre Jobin, and bass-baritone [[Thomas Carey (baritone)|Thomas Carey]] were the leads. It used completely new orchestrations bearing almost no resemblance to Robert Russell Bennett's. This was the first 2-LP album of ''Show Boat''. It included more of the score than had been previously put on records. Issued later on CD.
* '''1988''' – EMI studio cast album. This is a three-CD set which, for the first time, contained the entire score of the show, with the authentic 1927 orchestrations, uncensored lyrics, and vocal arrangements. The cast includes [[Frederica von Stade]], [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Teresa Stratas]], [[Karla Burns]], [[Bruce Hubbard]], and [[Paige O'Hara]]. The album is conducted by [[John McGlinn]].
* '''1993''' – Toronto revival cast recording, starring [[Rebecca Luker]], [[Mark Jacoby]], [[Lonette McKee]], [[Robert Morse]], [[Elaine Stritch]] and Michel Bell (as Joe).

There have been many other studio cast recordings of ''Show Boat'' in addition to those mentioned above. The soundtrack of the 1936 film version has appeared on a so-called "bootleg" CD label called Xeno.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Racial issues==

===Integration===
''Show Boat'' boldly portrayed racial issues and was the first [[Racial integration|racially integrated]] musical, in that both black and white performers appeared and sang on stage together.&lt;ref name=Disclaimer&gt;Despite its technical correctness, that ''Show Boat'' deserves this title has been disputed by some. See note No. 5 and corresponding text&lt;/ref&gt; [[Florenz Ziegfeld|Ziegfeld’s]] ''[[Ziegfeld Follies|Follies]]'' featured solo [[African American]] performers such as [[Bert Williams]], but would not have included a black woman in the chorus. ''Show Boat'' was structured with two choruses – a black chorus and a white chorus. One commentator noted that "Hammerstein uses the African-American chorus as essentially a [[Greek chorus]], providing clear commentary on the proceedings, whereas the white choruses sing of the not-quite-real."&lt;ref name=Blogger&gt;Keeling, Richard (a.k.a. musickna) (December 8, 2005). [http://heronwatermusic.blogspot.com/2005/12/show-boat.html Music – "Show Boat"]. ''[[Blogger.com]]''. Retrieved January 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Show Boat'' Jerome Kern used the [[thirty-two-bar form|AABA-chorus form]] exclusively in songs sung by African American characters (''Ole Man River'', ''Can't Help Lovin' dat Man''), a form that later would be regarded as typical of 'white' popular music.&lt;ref&gt;Appen, Ralf von / Frei-Hauenschild, Markus [http://www.gfpm-samples.de/Samples13/appenfrei.pdf "AABA, Refrain, Chorus, Bridge, Prechorus — Song Forms and their Historical Development"]. In: ''Samples. Online Publikationen der Gesellschaft für Popularmusikforschung/German Society for Popular Music Studies e.V.'' Ed. by Ralf von Appen, André Doehring and Thomas Phleps. Vol. 13 (2015), p. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Show Boat'' was the first Broadway musical to seriously depict an [[interracial marriage]], as in Ferber's original novel, and to feature a character of [[mixed race]] who was "[[Passing (racial identity)|passing]]" for white.  (Although the musical comedy ''[[Whoopee!]]'' (1930), starring [[Eddie Cantor]], supposedly depicted a romance between a mixed-blood [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] man and a white woman, the man turns out to be white.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=10796 Whoopee!], ibdb.com, Accessed November 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Language and stereotypes===

====The word "nigger"====
The show has generated controversy for the subject matter of interracial marriage, the historical portrayal of blacks working as laborers and servants in the 19th-century South, and the use of the word ''[[nigger]]s'' in the lyrics (this is the first word in the opening chorus of the show). Originally the show opened with the black chorus onstage singing:

::Niggers all work on the Mississippi,
::Niggers all work while the white folks play.
::Loadin' up boats wid de bales of cotton,
::Gittin' no rest till de Judgement Day.&lt;ref&gt;Hammerstein, Oscar II (1927). ''[http://www.allmusicals.com/lyrics/showboat/cottonblossom.htm]'' Cotton Blossom Lyrics from Show Boat&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent productions, "niggers" has been changed to "colored folk", to "darkies", and in one choice, "Here we all", as in "Here we all work on the Mississippi. Here we all work while the white folks play." In the 1966 [[Lincoln Center]] production of the show, produced two years after the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] was passed, this section of the opening chorus was omitted rather than having words changed. The 1971 London revival used "Here we all work on the Mississippi". The 1988 CD for EMI restored the original 1927 lyric, while the [[Harold Prince]] revival chose "colored folk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Paper Mill Playhouse production, videotaped and telecast by PBS in 1989, used the word "nigger" when said by an unsympathetic character, but otherwise used the word "Negro".

Many critics believe that Kern and Hammerstein wrote the opening chorus to give a sympathetic voice to an oppressed people, and that they intended its use in an ironic way, as it had so often been used in a derogatory way. They wanted to alert the audience to the realities of [[racism]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Show Boat'' begins with the singing of that most reprehensible word – nigger – yet this is no [[coon song]]... [it] immediately establishes race as one of the central themes of the play. This is a [[protest song]], more ironic than angry perhaps, but a protest nonetheless. In the singers' hands, the word nigger has a sardonic tone... in the very opening, Hammerstein has established the gulf between the races, the privilege accorded the white folks and denied the black, and a flavor of the contempt built into the very language that whites used about African Americans. This is a very effective scene.... These are not [[caricature]] roles; they are wise, if uneducated, people capable of seeing and feeling more than some of the white folk around them.&lt;ref name=Blogger/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The racial situations in the play provoke thoughts of how hard it must have been to be black in the South. In the dialogue, some of the blacks are called "niggers" by the white characters in the story. (Contrary to what is sometimes thought, black [[slavery]] is not depicted in the play; U.S. slavery was abolished by 1865, and the story runs from the 1880s to the late 1920s.) At first, it is shocking to believe they are allowed to use a word that negative at all in a play... But in the context in which it is used, it is appropriate due to the impact it makes. It reinforces how much of a derogatory term "nigger" was then and still is today.&lt;ref name=Rosetta&gt;Cronin, Patricia (June 1997). [http://www.mijohn.com/hsjc/rosetta/showb.htm "Timeless 'Show Boat' Just Keeps on Rolling Along"]. Retrieved January 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The word has not been used in any of the film versions of the musical. In the show, the Sheriff refers to Steve and Julie as having "nigger blood." In the 1936 and 1951 film versions, this was changed to "Negro blood". Likewise, the unsympathetic Pete calls Queenie a "nigger" in the stage version but refers to her as "colored" in the 1936 film, and does not use either word in the 1951 film.

====African-American English====
Those who consider ''Show Boat'' racially insensitive often note that the dialogue and lyrics of the black characters (especially the [[stevedore]] Joe and his wife Queenie) and choruses use various forms of [[African American Vernacular English]]. An example of this is shown in the following text:

::Hey!
::Where yo' think you're goin'?
::Don't yo' know dis show is startin' soon?
::Hey!
::Jes' a few seats left yere!
::It's light inside an' outside dere's no moon
::What fo' you gals dressed up dicty?
::Where's yo' all gwine?
::Tell dose stingy men o' yourn

Whether or not such language is an accurate reflection of the vernacular of blacks in Mississippi at the time, the effect of its usage has offended some critics, who see it as perpetuating racial stereotypes.&lt;ref name=Showing_Grit&gt;Philip, M.

"''Porgy'' and the Racial Politics of Music", ''New York Times'', December 13, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; But such critics sometimes acknowledged that Hammerstein's intentions were noble, since "'Ol' Man River' was the song in which he first found his lyrical voice, compressing the suffering, resignation, and anger of an entire race into 24 taut lines and doing it so naturally that it's no wonder folks assume the song's a Negro spiritual."&lt;ref name=Show_Boat_to_Sondheim&gt;Steyn, Mark (December 5, 1997).

The theatre critics and veterans [[Richard Eyre]] and Nicholas Wright believe that ''Show Boat'' was revolutionary, not only because it was a radical departure from the previous style of plotless [[revues]], but because it was a show written by non-blacks that portrayed blacks sympathetically rather than condescendingly:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Instead of a line of chorus girls showing their legs in the opening number singing that they were happy, happy, happy, the curtain rose on black dock-hands lifting bales of cotton and singing about the hardness of their lives. Here was a musical that showed poverty, suffering, bitterness, racial prejudice, a sexual relationship between black and white, a love story which ended unhappily – and of course show business. In "Ol' Man River" the black race was given an [[anthem]] to honor its misery that had the authority of an authentic spiritual.&lt;ref name=Changing_Stages&gt;Eyre, Richard; &amp; Wright, Nicholas. ''[http://www.randomhouse.com/knopf/authors/eyre/excerpt.html Changing Stages: A View of British and American Theatre in the Twentieth Century].'' Random House. Retrieved December 31, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Revisions and cancellations===
Since the musical's 1927 premiere, ''Show Boat'' has both been condemned as a prejudiced show based on racial caricatures and championed as a breakthrough work that opened the door for public discourse in the arts about racism in America. Some productions (including one planned for June 2002 in [[Connecticut]]) have been cancelled because of objections.&lt;ref name=FOX&gt;Norvell, Scott; &amp; S., Jon (March 18, 2002). [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,48114,00.html "The Show Can't Go On"]. ''[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]''. Retrieved January 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Such cancellations have been criticized by supporters of [[Performing arts|the arts]]. After planned performances by an amateur [[opera]] company in [[Middlesbrough]], [[England]] were "stopped because [they] would be 'distasteful' to ethnic minorities", a local newspaper declared that the actions were "surely taking political correctness too far".&lt;ref name=Lathan&gt;Lathan, Peter (October 24, 1999). [http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/articles/241099.htm "A More Subtle Form of Censorship"]. ''The British Theatre Guide''. Retrieved January 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A British theatre writer was concerned that "the kind of censorship we've been talking about – for censorship it is – actually militates against a truly integrated society, for it emphasizes differences. It puts a wall around groups within society, dividing people by creating metaphorical ghettos, and prevents mutual understanding".&lt;ref name=Lathan/&gt; Specifically, the cancellation was based on protests of plans to have all the black roles to be played in this production by white actors in blackface, as the company had no black members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-489325/Production-Show-Boat-sunk-race-row-blacked-actors.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Production of Show Boat is sunk after race row over 'blacked-up' actors | date=October 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As attitudes toward race relations have changed, producers and directors have altered some content to make the musical more [[political correctness|"politically correct"]]: "''Show Boat'', more than many musicals, was subject to cuts and revisions within a handful of years after its first performance, all of which altered the dramatic balance of the play."&lt;ref name=Blogger/&gt;

===1993 revival===
The 1993 Hal Prince revival, originating in Toronto, was deliberately staged to cast attention on racial disparities; throughout the production, African-American actors constantly cleaned up messes, appeared to move the sets (even when [[hydraulics]] actually moved them), and performed other menial tasks.&lt;ref name=Princereview&gt;Saviola, Gerard C. [http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG97/showboat/sbreview.html "''Show Boat'' – Review of 1994 production"], ''[[American Studies]] at [[University of Virginia]]'', April 1, 1997, accessed January 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; After a New Year's Eve ball, all the streamers fell on the floor and African Americans immediately began sweeping them away. A montage in the second act showed time passing using the revolving door of the [[Palmer House]] in Chicago, with newspaper headlines being shown in quick succession, and snippets of slow motion to highlight a specific moment, accompanied by brief snippets of ''Ol' Man River''. African-American dancers were seen performing a specific dance, and this would change to a scene showing white dancers performing the same dance. This was meant to illustrate how white performers "appropriated" the music and dancing styles of African Americans. Earlier productions of ''Show Boat'', even the 1927 stage original and the 1936 film version, did not go this far in social commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Richards | first = David | title = Show Boat; Classic Musical With a Change in Focus | newspaper = The New York Times | date = October 3, 1994 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/03/theater/theater-review-show-boat-classic-musical-with-a-change-in-focus.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm | accessdate = November 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the production in Toronto, many black community leaders and their supporters expressed opposition to the show, protesting in front of the theatre, "shouting insults and waving placards reading SHOW BOAT SPREADS LIES AND HATE and SHOW BOAT = CULTURAL GENOCIDE".&lt;ref name=Time&gt;Henry, William A. III (November 1, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Various theatre critics in New York, however, commented that Prince highlighted racial inequality in his production as to show its injustice, as well as to show the historical suffering of blacks. A critic noted that he included "an absolutely beautiful piece of music cut from the original production and from the movie ["Mis'ry's Comin' Round"] ... a haunting gospel melody sung by the black chorus. The addition of this number is so successful because it salutes the dignity and the pure talent of the black workers and allows them to shine for a brief moment on the center stage of the showboat".&lt;ref name=Princereview/&gt;

===Analysis===
Many commentators, both black and non-black, view the show as an outdated and stereotypical commentary on race relations that portrays blacks in a negative or inferior position. Douglass K. Daniel of [[Kansas State University]] has commented that it is a "racially flawed story",&lt;ref name=AEJMC&gt;Daniel, Douglass K. [http://list.msu.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A3=ind9710a&amp;L=AEJMC&amp;E=7BIT&amp;P=532016&amp;B=--&amp;T=TEXT%2FPLAIN;%20charset=US-ASCII "They Just Keep Rolling Along: Images of Blacks in Film Versions of Show Boat"]. ''[[Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication]], Minorities and Communication Division''. Retrieved December 31, 2005{{Dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[African-Canadian]] writer [[M. Nourbese Philip|M.&amp;nbsp;Nourbese Philip]] claims:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The affront at the heart of ''Show Boat'' is still very alive today. It begins with the book and its negative and one-dimensional images of Black people and continues on through the colossal and deliberate omission of the Black experience, including the pain of a people traumatized by four centuries of attempted genocide and exploitation. Not to mention the appropriation of Black music for the profit of the very people who oppressed Blacks and Africans. All this continues to offend deeply. The ol' man river of racism continues to run through the history of these productions and is very much part of this (Toronto) production. It is part of the overwhelming need of white Americans and white Canadians to convince themselves of our inferiority – that our demands don't represent a challenge to them, their privilege and their superiority.&lt;ref name=Showing_Grit/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Supporters of the musical believe that the depictions of racism should be regarded not as stereotyping blacks but rather [[satire|satirizing]] the common national attitudes that both held those stereotypes and reinforced them through discrimination. In the words of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' theatre critic [[John Lahr]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Describing racism doesn't make ''Show Boat'' racist. The production is meticulous in honoring the influence of black culture not just in the making of the nation's wealth but, through music, in the making of its modern spirit."&lt;ref name=Lahr /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As described by [[Joe Bob Briggs]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who attempt to understand works like ''Show Boat'' and ''[[Porgy and Bess#Racial controversy|Porgy and Bess]]'' through the eyes of their creators usually consider that the show "was a statement AGAINST racism. That was the point of Edna Ferber's novel. That was the point of the show. That's how Oscar wrote it...I think this is about as far from racism as you can get."&lt;ref name=DriveIn&gt;[[Joe Bob Briggs|Briggs, Joe Bob]] (May 7, 1993). ''[http://www.joebobbriggs.com/index.php?/body-of-influence-1993.html Joe Bob Goes to the Drive In]''. ''[[Joe Bob Goes to the Drive In|The Joe Bob Report]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Rabbi Alan Berg, Kern and Hammerstein's score to ''Show Boat'' is "a tremendous expression of the ethics of tolerance and compassion".&lt;ref name=Berg&gt;Laporte, Elaine. [http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/2914/edition_id/51/format/html/displaystory.html Why do Jews sing the blues?]. ''The Jewish News Weekly of Northern California'', February 9, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; As Harold Prince (not Kern, to whom the quote has been mistakenly attributed) states in the production notes to his 1993 production of the show:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Throughout pre-production and rehearsal, I was committed to eliminate any inadvertent stereotype in the original material, dialogue which may seem "Uncle Tom" today... However, I was determined not to rewrite history. The fact that during the 45-year period depicted in our musical there were [[lynchings]], imprisonment, and forced labor of the blacks in the United States is irrefutable. Indeed, the United States still cannot hold its head high with regard to racism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Oscar Hammerstein's commitment to idealizing and encouraging tolerance theatrically started with his libretto to ''Show Boat''. It can be seen in his later works, many of which were set to music by [[Richard Rodgers]].&lt;ref name=Gomberg&gt;Gomberg, Alan (February 16, 2004). [http://www.talkinbroadway.com/rialto/past/2004/02_16_04.html ''Making Americans: Jews and the Broadway Musical'' – Book Review]. ''What's New on the Rialto?''. Retrieved January 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Carmen Jones]]'' is an attempt to present a modern version of the classic [[Carmen|French opera]] through the experiences of African Americans during [[African-American history#Two World Wars|wartime]], and ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' explores [[interracial marriage]] and prejudice. Finally, ''[[The King and&amp;nbsp;I]]'' deals with different cultures' preconceived notions regarding each other and the possibility for cultural inclusiveness in societies.

Regarding the original author of ''Show Boat'', Ann Shapiro states that

&lt;blockquote&gt;Edna Ferber was taunted for being [[Jewish]]; as a young woman eager to launch her career as a journalist, she was told that the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' did not hire women reporters. Despite her experience of antisemitism and sexism, she idealized America, creating in her novels an American myth where strong women and downtrodden men of any race prevail... ''[Show Boat]'' create[s] visions of racial harmony... in a fictional world that purported to be America but was more illusion than reality. Characters in Ferber's novels achieve [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] and acceptance that was periodically denied Ferber herself throughout her life.&lt;ref name=Shapiro&gt;Shapiro, Ann R. (2001). [http://muse.jhu.edu/cgi-bin/access.cgi?uri=/journals/shofar/v020/20.2shapiro.html "Edna Ferber, Jewish American Feminist"]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies]]'', vol. 20, #2, pp. 52–60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whether or not the show is racist, many contend that productions of it should continue as it serves as a history lesson of American race relations. According to African-American opera singer [[Phillip Boykin]], who played the role of Joe in a 2000 tour,
{{Quote|Whenever a show deals with race issues, it gives the audience sweaty palms. I agree with putting it on the stage and making the audience think about it. We see where we came from so we don't repeat it, though we still have a long way to go. A lot of history would disappear if the show was put away forever. An artist must be true to an era. I'm happy with it.&lt;ref name=Tucson&gt;Regan, Margaret.

A '''skirt lifter''', also known as a dress lifter, skirt grip, dress suspender, hem-holder, page or porte-jupe, was a device for lifting a long [[skirt]] to avoid dirt or to facilitate movement. It clamped on to the hem and was attached to the belt by a cord, ribbon, or chain.&lt;ref name="milford"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Milford-Cottam|first1=Daniel|title=Edwardian Fashion|date=2014|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9780747814764|page=22|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EhfDCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=%22skirt%20lifter%22&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22skirt%20lifter%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first skirt lifters date from around 1846 and they were most popular in the 1860s-1880s.&lt;ref name="abijaoude"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abijaoude|first1=Joanna|title=Skirt lifter, c. 1876|url=http://blog.fidmmuseum.org/museum/2013/08/skirt-lifter-c-1876.html|publisher=[[FIDM Museum]]|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Costume designer [[Penny Rose]] chose a skirt lifter as her hypothetical donation to the imaginary museum in an August 2017 episode of [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[The Museum of Curiosity]]''.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Museum of Curiosity: Series 11, Episode 5|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b091wf81|publisher=BBC Radio 4|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spectrum continuation analysis (SCA)''' is a generalization of the concept of [[Fourier series]] to '''non-periodic''' functions of which only a fragment has been sampled in the time domain.

Recall that a Fourier series is only suitable to the analysis of '''periodic''' (or finite-domain) functions ''f''(''x'') with period 2π. It can be expressed as an infinite series of sinusoids:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} F_n \,e^{inx}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; is the amplitude of the individual harmonics.

'''In SCA however''', one decomposes the spectrum into optimized discrete frequencies. As a consequence, and as the period of the sampled function is supposed to be infinite or not yet known, each of the discrete periodic functions that compose the sampled function fragment can not be considered to be a multiple of the fundamental frequency:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} F_n \,e^{i \omega_n x}.&lt;/math&gt;
 
As such, SCA does not necessarily deliver &lt;math&gt; 2 \pi &lt;/math&gt; periodic functions, as would have been the case in Fourier analysis.
For real-valued functions, the SCA series can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty\left[A_n \cos(\omega_n x)+B_n \sin(\omega_n x)\right] + C(x) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are the series amplitudes. The amplitudes can only be solved if the series of values &lt;math&gt;\omega_n&lt;/math&gt; is previously optimized for a desired objective function (usually least [[errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]]).
&lt;math&gt;C(x)&lt;/math&gt; is not necessarily the average value over the sampled interval: one might prefer to include predominant information on the behavior of the offset value in the time domain.

==Etymology==
SCA deals with the prediction problem of continuing a frequency spectrum beyond a sampled (usually [[stochastic]]) time series fragment. Unlike ordinary Fourier analysis that infinitely repeats an observed function period or time domain, SCA filters the exact composing frequencies out of the observed spectrum and let them continue (resp. precede) in the time domain. 
In the scientific terminology, therefore preference is given to the term ''continuation'' rather than for instance ''extrapolation''.

==Algorithm==
An algorithm is required to cope with several problems: detrending, decomposition, frequency resolution optimization, superposition, transformation and computational efficiency.

* '''Detrending or trend estimation'''.
* '''Decomposition'''.

Since [[discrete Fourier transform]] is inherently related to Fourier analysis, this type of spectral analysis is by definition not suitable for spectrum decomposition in SCA. DFT (or [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]]) may provide however an initial approximation, which often speeds up the decomposition.

* '''Improving frequency resolution'''.

After decomposition of a discrete frequency, it should be filtered for optimal resolution (i.e. varying three parameters: frequency value, amplitude and phase).

* '''Transformation'''.

==Spectrum dispersion==
Compared to [[Discrete Fourier transform|DFT]] (or [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]]), which is characterized by perfect spectral resolution, but poor temporal information, SCA favours temporal information, but yields higher spectrum dispersion. This property shows where the analytic strength of SCA is located. For instance, discrete composing frequency resolution is by definition far better in SCA than in DFT.

The '''Spillings Hoard''' ({{lang-sv|Spillingsskatten}}) is the world's largest [[Viking Age|Viking]] silver treasure, found on Friday 16{{nbsp}}July 1999 in a field at the Spilling farm northwest of [[Slite]], on northern [[Gotland]], Sweden. The silver hoard consisted of two parts with a total weight of {{convert|67|kg|lb|abbr=on}} before [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] and consisted of, among other things, 14,295 coins most of which were [[Islam]]ic from other countries. A third deposition containing over {{convert|20|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of [[bronze]] scrap-metal was also found. The three caches had been hidden under the floorboards of a Viking outhouse sometime during the 9th century.

== Discovery ==
On Friday 16{{nbsp}}July 1999, a team of reporters from the Swedish television [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]] were in the [[socken]] of Othem on Gotland to film a cultural feature from [[Almedalen Week]]. They chose to do a segment on the problem with [[Looting#Archaeological removals|looting]] of archaeological sites with archaeologist Jonas Ström acting as their guide along with Kenneth Jonsson, a professor of [[numismatics]], who happened to be on the island at that time.{{sfn|Pettersson|2009|p=14}} Spillings farm was selected for the filming since about 150 silver coins and bronze objects had been found there earlier by the landowner Björn Engström.&lt;ref name=Moscow&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lynn|first1=Jonathan|title=Biggest Viking Hoard Unveiled|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/biggest-viking-hoard-unveiled/245672.html|website=www.themoscowtimes.com|publisher=[[The Moscow Times]]|date=26 June 2002|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With filming complete, Ström and Jonsson decided to continue their survey of the field. Twenty minutes after the TV-crew had left, they heard a strong signal from their [[metal detector]], which led them to the smaller of the two silver caches. A couple of hours later and only {{convert|3|m|ft|}} from the first find, they received another signal from the detector:&lt;ref name=silverharvest /&gt;

{{quote|"The display blinked 'overload' and then it turned itself off."|Jonas Ström&lt;ref name=silverharvest&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reistad|first1=Helena|title=Silverskörd. Vi har tre månader på oss att se världens största vikingatida silverskatt – sedan åker den tillbaka till Gotland|trans-title=Silver harvest.

The site was hurriedly cordoned off, back-up crew from the museum was sent for, permission for an archaeological excavation was immediately sought at the [[Gotland Municipality|County Administrative Board]] and guards were posted. However, instead of keeping the find a secret, the [[Gotland Museum]] decided to go public with the find immediately. During the first weekend, over 2,000 people visited the excavation site.{{sfn|Pettersson|2009|p=16}}

Some days later, the metal detector indicated a third metal cache approximately {{convert|1.5|m|ft|}} from the first find. The archaeologists concentrated on uncovering the two first finds before starting with the third. Due to the size of the hoards and the fragility of the objects, the bottom layers of the depositions were encapsulated in plaster. Only when they tried to lift the finds out of the soil did the archaeologists realize how heavy the hoards were. The smaller weighed {{convert|27|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and the larger one {{convert|40|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. An attempt to X-ray the finds at the local hospital failed because they contained so much silver that the X-ray plates remained blank.{{sfn|Pettersson|2009|pp=16–18}}

The larger find was intact but the smaller had been damaged by a plough. A previous landowner who visited the excavation commented that he had found metal wires around the find-spot several years earlier, but thinking that they were only steel wire, he had thrown them away. It was therefore concluded that the treasure had originally been even larger.{{sfn|Pettersson|2009|p=18}}

With the two first caches taken care of, the third deposition was excavated almost a year after the first discovery. It contained over {{convert|20|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of bronze scrap-metal, most of which had been partially melted into a 'cake'. This find was deemed even more valuable since very few finds contain such large amounts of bronze intended for smelting.{{sfn|Pettersson|2009|p=18}}

== Further excavations ==
[[File:Location of depositories in stone foundation, Spillings.jpg|thumb|Location of depositories in the stone foundation at Spillings]]
Additional excavations were conducted in the summer of 2000 and in 2003-06. Remnants of wood, iron rivets and mounts as well as a lock mechanism were found, leading to the conclusion that the caches had been stored in chests.{{sfn|Pettersson|2009|pp=18–20}}

An extended survey and excavation revealed the foundations of a building and indicated that the hoards had been placed under the floorboards of what would probably have been a warehouse, shed or storage rather than a dwelling since it had no hearth. Carbon dating showed that the building had been in use between 540 and 1040.{{sfn|Pettersson|2009|p=20}} The foundations and the remaining [[posthole]]s indicated a regular Viking Age structure, about {{convert|10|by|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} with a slanting [[Cladium mariscus|sedge]]-covered roof, much like other similar finds on Gotland. It had been built on an older Iron Age foundation.{{sfn|Pettersson|2009|p=47}}

== Find ==
The silver deposits were roughly square-shaped with rounded corners, about {{convert|40|to|45|x|50|cm|in|abbr=on}}, suggesting that they had been in sacks of cloth, leather or pelt, inside boxes or chests of wood.{{sfn|Pettersson|2009|p=16}} In the bronze deposit were found substantial pieces of wood and iron, such as fittings, ironwork, nails and a lock-device, showing that the bronze had been kept in a sturdy chest. A carbon dating of the chest dated it to approximately 675, making it older than the objects stored inside it.{{sfn|Pettersson|2009|p=32}}

Although silver hoards and treasures are not unusual on Gotland, this was an exceptionally large find. One explanation may be found in the location near some of the island's best and most significant harbours during the Viking Age. The silver in the caches would have been enough to pay the tax to the Swedish king for all of Gotland for five years.{{sfn|Pettersson|2009|pp=20–24}}

The following surveys and excavations of the fields surrounding the find-site showed that the site had been inhabited continuously over 1,000 years up until the 19th century. Over 700 more objects were retrieved, such as objects of bronze and copper, fired clay, [[Viking art#Metal|clothes pins]], a piece of glass, tile pieces, chains, needles, glass beads, slag, iron nails, polished [[Gemstone|semi-precious stones]] and brick.{{sfn|Pettersson|2009|pp=34–36}}

US$242,400) was paid to the landowner for the treasure, although the real value of it is much higher. It was the largest amount of money ever paid for a find in Sweden, according to director of the [[Swedish National Heritage Board]] Sven Göthe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=TT|title=Hittade vikingaskatt – får 2,1 miljoner i hittelön|trans-title=Found Viking treasure – gets 2.1 million in finder's fee|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/hittade-vikingaskatt---far-21-miljoner-i-hittelon/|website=www.expressen.se|publisher=[[Expressen]]|date=21 December 2002|language=Swedish|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hoard was dated to have been hidden some time after 870–71.{{sfn|Pettersson|2009|p=16}} The treasure is on permanent display in the Gotland Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skattkammaren|trans-title=The Treasury|url=http://www.gotlandsmuseum.se/skattkammaren/|website=www.gotlandsmuseum.se|publisher=Gotland Museum|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2015}}, more than {{convert|1000|kg|lb}} of silver from over 700 caches deposited between the 9th and 12th centuries have been found on Gotland. This includes 168,000 silver coins from the [[Arab world]], [[North Africa]] and [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name=gefle&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomsson|first1=Lena|title=Gotland &amp; Spillingsskatten – obegripligt negligerade|trans-title=Gotland &amp; The Spilling Hoard – inexplicably neglected|url=http://www.gd.se/kultur/bocker/gotland-spillingsskatten-obegripligt-negligerade|website=www.gd.se|date=9 February 2010|publisher=Gefle Dagblad|language=Swedish|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Silver depositions ==
The caches contained silver objects ranging from coins, bars, thread and [[hacksilver]] to be used as raw material, to jewelry such as fingerings, bangles and pendants. Much of the material had been bundled up to correspond with the mark-weight system of the Viking Age, in which {{convert|200|g|lb}} made one [[Mark (unit)|mark]].{{sfn|Pettersson|2009|p=24}}

Almost 60% of the find consisted of 486 [[bangle]]s or parts thereof, making it the largest ever find of such silver jewellery {{as of|2015|lc=y}}. Most of the bracelets weighed around 100 grams under the mark-weight system and were of traditional Gotlandic design, a number of them have very detailed ornamentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Unikt mynt hittat i Spillingsskatten |trans-title=Unique coin found in the Spillings Hoard|url=http://www.hallekis.com/arkiv1/xx020629e.htm |work=Hällekis Kuriren |date=29 June 2002 |accessdate=2009-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also bangles of British and Western Scandinavian design as well as plain, undecorated fingerings of Finnish and British design, known as ''ring money''.{{sfn|Pettersson|2009|p=26}}

[[File:Khazar coin Spillings Hoard.jpg|thumb|150px|Khazar coin, {{circa}} 800]]
Of the 14,295 coins found, 14,200 were Islamic [[dirham]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fadlan|first1=Ibn|author-link= Ahmad ibn Fadlan |title=Ibn Fadlan and the Land of Darkness: Arab Travellers in the Far North|date=2012|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=0-14-197504-0|pages=Appendix 1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UPCworiqUqcC&amp;dq=spillings+hoard|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; four were Nordic (from [[Hedeby]]), one was [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] and 23 were from [[Iran|Persia]]. The earliest, a Persian coin, dates from 539 and the latest from 870.&lt;ref name="Moscow" /&gt; Many of the coins (as well as the bangles) had marks that may have been made when the purity of the silver was [[Touchstone (assaying tool)|tested]].&lt;ref name=silk&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waugh|first1=Daniel C.|title=The Silk Road|url=http://www.silkroadfoundation.org/newsletter/vol9/srjournal_v9.pdf|website=www.silkroadfoundation.org|publisher=The Silkroad Foundation|page=168|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were several imitations and fakes among the coins. The illegal copies were made from good silver, but made in other places than where the originals were minted. All in all, 69 different minting locations from 15 present-day countries were identified in the hoard.{{sfn|Pettersson|2009|pp=28–31}}

During the conservation work of the larger hoard (No 2) it became evident that the larger objects had been placed at the bottom of the cache and the smaller ones, ending with the cut coins, had been strewn on top.{{sfn|Pettersson|2009|p=22}}

=== Moses coin ===
One of the most noted coins in the hoard, dated to {{circa}} 800,{{sfn|Pettersson|2009|p=29}} is from the [[Khazars|Khazar Kingdom]] and designated the "Moses Coin". According to written sources the Khazars are believed to be Hebrews, but few objects have been found to support this claim.&lt;ref name="Moscow" /&gt; The coin is inscribed with "Moses is the messenger of God" instead of the usual Muslim text "Muhammad is the messenger of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brook|first1=Kevin Alan|title=The Jews of Khazaria|date=2006|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=1-4422-0302-1|page=80|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hEuIveNl9kcC&amp;dq=spillings+hoard|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bronze deposition ==
[[File:The s k cake Spillings Bronze Hoard.jpg|thumb|The "cake" from the bronze cache]]
Excavated in the same manner as the silver hoards, the bronze cache was encapsulated on site and transported to the Gotland Museum for further examination. The objects were removed layer after layer from top to bottom until the large melted 'cake', about {{convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter was uncovered. Most of the bronze objects were broken, fragmented or partially melted, suggesting that they were kept in the heartwood chest to be used as raw material for new artifacts. Individual finds consisted of parts of, and some complete, necklaces, bangles, fingerings, pins for clothes and mounts for drinking horns. The bronze objects span a period of 200–300 years and are mostly of [[Baltic states|Baltic]] origin or possibly Russian with only a few of them Scandinavian. Even though several scholars have been involved in identifying the deposition, no consensus have been reached regarding why the hoard was collected or the dating of it. Two theories are that it was either the stock of a foundryman living on Gotland, or booty from a Viking raid that was hidden under the floor of the outhouse.{{sfn|Pettersson|2009|pp=31–34}}

'''Tbilisi Open Air''' is an annual international music festival, with the emphasis on electronic and rock music, first held in [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], on May, 15–17 2009. After that the festival is organized each year and is widely considered as the biggest music festival in [[Caucasus]] region. The festival mainly maintains several-day outdoor event format.

As the organizers of Tbilisi Open Air clarify, ''the defining idea behind the festival is freedom. This is freedom from stress, clichés, social controls, freedom to create and express, freedom to experience what is valued by every single one of us as individuals''.&lt;ref name="www.finchannel.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finchannel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=35736&amp;Itemid=13|title=FINCHANNEL.com|publisher=|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2016 ==

In 2016, TOA presented 3 day line up with over 60 artists. Festival had 3 stages - Main stage, LTFR/Night stage and Pirate Bay stage. Total attendance was over 30 000. Festival was held on 29-31 July, on a location near Lisi Lake, which received nickname "Lisi Wonderland".

== 2015  ==



In 2015, TOA presented 5 day line up with over 60 artists. This was by far the biggest musical event which has ever happened in Caucasus or Middle Earth and the festival broke all records in social media, having three times bigger feedback than in 2013. Also this was the first time when except main stage, 2 additional stages were built - golden stage and [[Bassiani]] stage. Attendance was over 50 000 which was also a record for the whole region.

== 2014  ==

In 2014 the festival returned to three-day outdoor festival format. Total attendance was 21 000. Although criticized for smaller line-up compared to former years, the organizers announced this was "a decision essential to switch back to the fields and prepare for 2015, which should be the biggest event both by line-up and scale". Due to heavy rain and storm on the 2nd day of the festival, [[Chinawoman]] and [[Lapalux]] were cancelled on 7 June and were added to the 8 June line-up.

== 2013 ==

In 2013 the festival was held on the Dinamo Arena Stadium. Total attendance was 19 000. With [[Deep Purple]] as headliner, the line-up was the biggest happening in the region and received a lot of local and foreign media interest, especially from [[Armenia]], [[Russia]], [[Turkey]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. Despite this, after the event the organizers of the festival stated their opinion that Tbilisi Open Air belonged more to outdoor fields than Stadiums or any kind of buildings. "We received invaluable experience, but the heart of the festival stays with the fields" - stated organizer [[Achiko Guledani]] - "next time we will try to accept the challenge to bring even bigger line-up there."

== Camping  ==



In 2012 Tbilisi Open Air started allowing tent camping as an option for festival lodging. The campground site is adjacent to the venue grounds and has its own entrance from the venue. Since then festival receives campers from different countries.

== Weather  ==

The festival is held most often in June. Temperatures during the festival's history have ranged from 25&amp;nbsp;°C in May to 32&amp;nbsp;°C on June. Tbilisi has mostly welcoming weather in summer and the same holds true for the event.

== Management  ==

Tbilisi Open Air is run by [[Altervision Group]] which mainly consists of former and active musicians/producers. The first concept of the festival was created by [[Achiko Guledani]], [[Vaho Babunashvili]] and [[Beqa Japaridze]] in 2009. Nowadays the decision making board of Tbilisi Open Air consists of 7-8 people. The festival is booked by [[David Tsintsadze]].

'''The Baker Street Irregulars''' is an organization of [[Sherlock Holmes]] enthusiasts founded in 1934 by [[Christopher Morley]].&lt;ref name="BSI Harvard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/deepLink?_collection=oasis&amp;uniqueId=hou02178 |title=Baker Street Irregulars 1923-2007: Guide |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=''[[Houghton Library]], [[Harvard Library]]'' |publisher=[[Harvard University]] |access-date=2015-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nonprofit organization numbers some 300 individuals worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Baker Street Irregulars Trust |date=March 2015 |publisher=[[ZoomInfo]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has published ''[[The Baker Street Journal]]'' — an "irregular quarterly of Sherlockiana" — since 1946.&lt;ref name="BSI Harvard"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:BSI-Pratt-Morley-Stout-1944.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Baker Street Irregulars [[Fletcher Pratt]], [[Christopher Morley]] and [[Rex Stout]] (1944)]]

The BSI was an outgrowth of Christopher Morley's informal group, "3 Hours for Lunch" which discussed art and literature.&lt;ref name="annotated"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conan Doyle|first1=Sir Arthur|authorlink1=Sir Arthur Conan Doyle|last2=Klinger|first2=Leslie S.|authorlink2=Leslie S. Klinger|title=[[The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes|The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Vol. 1]]|publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]|year=2005|pages=lxiii-lxvi|ISBN=0-7394-5304-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first inaugural meeting of the BSI was held in 1934 at Christ Cella's restaurant in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="bunson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bunson|first=Matthew|authorlink=Matthew Bunson|title=Encyclopedia Sherlockiana: an A-to-Z guide to the world of the great detective |year=1997 |publisher=Macmillan |pages=20-21 |ISBN=0-02-861679-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial attendees included [[William Gillette]], [[Vincent Starrett]], [[Alexander Woollcott]], and [[Gene Tunney]].&lt;ref name="annotated"/&gt; Morley kept meetings quite irregular but after ceding leadership to Edgar W. Smith, meetings became more regular.&lt;ref name="annotated"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tor"&gt;{{cite web|last=Faye|first=Lyndsay|title=Inside the Baker Street Irregulars|url=https://www.tor.com/2012/03/22/inside-the-baker-street-irregulars/|website=[[Tor.com]]|date=March 22, 2012|accessdate=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization long resisted admitting women, something not altered until 1991.&lt;ref name="annotated"/&gt; This policy spawned a female-centered organization, the Adventuresses of Sherlock Holmes.&lt;ref name="tor"/&gt;

Members of the society participate in [[Sherlockian game|"the game"]]&lt;ref name="dirda"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dirda|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Dirda|title=Sherlock Lives!|url=http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2012/02/02/sherlock-lives/|work=[[The New York Review of Books]]|date=February 2, 2012|accessdate=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which postulates that Holmes and [[Doctor Watson]] were real and [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] was merely Watson's "literary agent".&lt;ref name="grann"/&gt;

==Membership==
Membership is by invitation only&lt;ref name="tor"/&gt; based on criteria unknown to the public.&lt;ref name="annotated"/&gt; Members take on a name inspired by the canon&lt;ref name="kings"/&gt; with the head of the organization known as "Wiggins".&lt;ref name="annotated"/&gt; Since its inception, the organization has only had 683 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lynch|first=Michelle N.|title=Exeter man admitted to exclusive Sherlock Holmes literary society|url=http://www.readingeagle.com/news/article/exeter-man-admitted-to-exlusive-sherlock-holmes-literary-society|work=[[Reading Eagle]]|date= January 28, 2018|accessdate= January 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[The Baker Street Journal]]==
The original iteration of the BSJ was started in 1946 as an [[academic journal]] but it ceased in 1946.&lt;ref name="annotated"/&gt; In 1951, Edgar Smith began publishing it again as a quarterly and it has continued publication since that time.&lt;ref name="annotated"/&gt;

==Scion societies==
The BSI has spawned numerous "scion societies",&lt;ref name="bunson"/&gt; many of which are officially recognized by the BSI. The first was The Five Orange Pips of [[Westchester County, New York]] in 1935.&lt;ref name="annotated"/&gt; Others include Canada's [[The Bootmakers of Toronto]].

'''''The Case of the Kidnapped Collie''''' is the 26th book in the ''[[Hank the Cowdog]]'' book series.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fantasticfiction.com/e/john-r-erickson/case-of-kidnapped-collie.htm ''The Case of the Kidnapped Collie''] at Fantastic Fiction&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The book starts off with Hank watching Slim and High Loper working on the machine shed. Later on Hank and Drover are sleeping under the [[gas tank]] when Pete the local [[barn cat]] comes around and begins playing with Hank's tail. Pete then begins talking to Hank in his sleep and Hank wakes up and gets angry at Pete. Later on a Chevy pickup truck comes up and on the back is the [[collie]], Beulah, and her boyfriend the [[English pointer]], Plato. Plato is here to sniff out birds such as [[quail]] and [[pheasants]] so the humans can shoot them. With Plato scaring up birds, Hank tries to scare up birds as well, but he decides that quails and pheasants are too small. So he scares a group of turkeys and while most of the turkeys go running, one fights with Hank.  Sally May then gets angry at Hank for scaring up the turkeys. Later on Plato comes to Hank and says that Beulah has been captured by a [[coyote]] or as Hank usually calls them '[[cannibal]]s'. He and Plato go off into the wilderness and find that Beulah has been taken captive by the coyotes, Scraunch the Terrible, who has a half-scarred face. Beulah says that Scraunch jumped her while she was getting a drink. Scraunch then says that he's going to make Beulah one of his wives. So, Hank via song tells Beulah that once he's done singing he'll punch Scraunch. He and Scraunch get into a fight while Plato and Beulah run. In the end the humans come in time to find Scraunch walking away after stuffing Hank into a log.

== Background ==
[[File:Dr. Robert Hazen.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;[[Robert Hazen|Dr. Robert Hazen]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

As the Clarence B. Robinson Professor at [[George Mason University]], [[Robert Hazen]] developed innovative courses to promote [[scientific literacy]] in both scientists and non-scientists.&lt;ref name=DistinguishedPresentation&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hemley|first1=R. J.|title=Presentation of the Distinguished Public Service Medal of the Mineralogical Society of America for 2009|journal=American Mineralogist|date=25 March 2010|volume=95|issue=4|pages=666–666|doi=10.2138/am.2010.557|bibcode=2010AmMin..95..666H}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a collaboration with physicist [[James Trefil]], he wrote three undergraduate textbooks: ''The Sciences: An Integrated Approach'' (1993),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trefil|first1=James|last2=Hazen|first2=Robert M.|title=The sciences : an integrated approach|date=1994|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-0471303008|edition=A preliminary}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Physical Sciences: An Integrated Approach'' (1995),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hazen|first1=Robert M.|last2=Trefil|first2=James|title=The Physical science : an integrated approach|date=1996|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=9780471002499}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Physics Matters: An Introduction to Conceptual Physics'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trefil|first1=James|last2=Hazen|first2=Robert M.|title=Physics matter : an introduction to conceptual physics|date=2004|publisher=J.

A fan of the overall series of [[The Great Courses]] is [[Bill Gates]], who said the courses have "incredible professors" who cover "every topic that you can think of".&lt;ref name="TIME-20180104"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gates |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Gates |title=The 4 Learning Hacks Bill Gates Swears By |url=http://time.com/5066247/bill-gates-learning-hacks/ |date=4 January 2018 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=9 May 2018 |quote=... One of my favorite sources for interesting lectures is The Teaching Company. They get incredible professors to teach courses on pretty much every topic you can think of.

'''''The Last Sherlock Holmes Story''''' is a [[Sherlock Holmes pastiches|Sherlock Holmes pastiche]] [[novel]] by [[Michael Dibdin]].

The novel is an account of Holmes' attempt to solve the [[Jack the Ripper]] murders. Holmes suspects the Ripper to be his nemesis, [[Professor Moriarty|James Moriarty]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://capturescrime.blogspot.com/2009/12/last-sherlock-holmes-story-by-michael.html The Last Sherlock Holmes Story by Michael Dibdin]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a twist ending, revealing that Holmes himself had invented the character of Moriarty due to insanity, and was himself committing the crimes, a twist which some reviewers have found to be clever&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trashfiction.co.uk/sherlock_last.html ''The Last Sherlock Holmes Story''] review at Trashfiction.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; while others found disappointing. There is also an ambiguity to the revelation as, despairing, Holmes tries to explain to his companion [[Dr. Watson|Dr. John H. Watson]] that Moriarty has fooled Watson and framed Holmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76207.The_Last_Sherlock_Holmes_Story ''The Last Sherlock Holmes Story''] review at goodreads&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epinions.com/review/The_Last_Sherlock_Holmes_Story_by_Michael_Dibdin/content_38862687876 ''The Last Sherlock Holmes Story''] review at epinions&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tierradentroo''' is a National archeologicalic park in the jurisdiction of the municipality of [[Inza, Cauca|Inza]], [[Departments of Colombia|Department]] of [[Cauca Department|Cauca]], [[Colombia]]. The park is located 100&amp;nbsp;km away from the capital of the Department, [[Popayán]].

The area is very well known for its [[preColumbian]] [[hypogeumhypogea]], which were found in several excavations, and are divided in many archeological places. some of them are: Alto del Aguacate (Avocado Hill), Alto de San Andrés, Alto de Segovia, Alto del Duende and El Tablón.

The typical hypogeum has an entry oriented towards the west, a spiral staircase and a main chamber, usually 5 to 8 meters below the surface, with several lesser chambers around, each one containing a corpse. The walls are painted with geometric, [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] and [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphic]] patterns in red, black and white. Some statues and remains of pottery and fabrics can be seen scarcely due to [[grave robbery]] before the hypogea were constituted as protected areas.

The pre-Columbian culture that created this [[funeral]] complex inhabited this area during the first millennium A.C. Tierradentro Archaeological park features hypogea dating from 6th to 9th centuries AD.   The details in the sculptures and [[pictorial|pictoric]] patterns are similar to the [[San Agustín, Huila|San Agustín]] culture.

The park generates significant revenue to the local economy due to the high volume of tourists, both Colombian and foreigners. These sites form a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The site was listed on the [[World Monuments Fund]]'s [[2012 World Monuments Watch]] list of 100 Most Endangered Sites.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Monuments Fund]]: [http://www.wmf.org/watch/watch-sites-1996?country_name=Colombia&amp;tid_1=All World Monuments Watch 1996-2012]. – Retrieved on 13 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''visual language''' is a system of communication using visual elements. Speech as a means of communication cannot strictly be separated from the whole of human communicative activity which includes the visual&lt;ref&gt;Colin Cherry, On Human Communication, MIT, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; and the term 'language' in relation to vision is an extension of its use to describe the perception, comprehension and production of visible signs.

== Overview ==
An image which dramatizes and communicates an idea presupposes the use of a visual [[language]]. Just as people can 'verbalize' their thinking, they can 'visualize' it. A [[diagram]], a [[map]], and a [[painting]] are all examples of uses of visual language. Its structural units include line, shape, colour, form, motion, texture, pattern, direction, orientation, scale, angle, space and proportion.

The elements in an image represent concepts in a spatial context, rather than the linear form used for words. Speech and visual communication are parallel and often interdependent means by which humans exchange information.

== Visual language ==
Visual units in the form of lines and marks are constructed into meaningful shapes and structures or signs. Different areas of the cortex respond to different elements such as colour and form. [[Semir Zeki]]&lt;ref&gt;Semir Zeki, Inner Vision: an Exploration of Art and the Brain, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; has shown the responses in the brain to the paintings of [[Michelangelo]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]], [[René Magritte|Magritte]], [[Kazimir Malevich|Malevich]] and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]].

=== Imaging in the mind ===
What we have in our minds in a waking state and what we imagine in dreams is very much of the same nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hiller|first=Susan (ed.)|title=Dream Machines|year=2000|publisher=Hayward Gallery|location=London|isbn=1-85332-202-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dream images might be with or without spoken words, other sounds or colours. In the waking state there is usually, in the foreground, the buzz of immediate perception, feeling, mood and as well as fleeting memory images.&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, Gerald and Giulio Tononi, Consciousness: How Matter Becomes Imagination, 2000,Allen Lane,London {{ISBN|0-14-028147-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a mental state between dreaming and being fully awake is a state known as 'day dreaming' or a meditative state, during which "the things we see in the sky when the clouds are drifting, the centaurs and stags, antelopes and wolves" are projected from the imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, Ernst, Art and Illusion: A Study in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation, 1960, Phaidon Press, London&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rudolf Arnheim]]&lt;ref&gt;in Kepes, Gyorgy,ed., Sign, Image and Symbol,1966, Studio Vista, London&lt;/ref&gt; has attempted to answer the question: what does a mental image look like? In Greek philosophy, the School of Leucippus and Democritus believed that a replica of an object enters the eye and remains in the soul as a memory as a complete image. Berkeley explained that parts, for example, a leg rather than the complete body, can be brought visually to the mind. Arnheim considers the psychologist, [[Edward B. Titchener]]'s account to be the breakthrough in understanding something of how the vague incomplete quality of the image is 'impressionistic' and carries meaning as well as form.

=== Meaning and expression ===
[[Abstract art]] has shown that the qualities of line and shape, proportion and colour convey meaning directly without the use of words or pictorial representation. [[Wassily Kandinsky]]&lt;ref&gt;Wassily Kandinsky, Point and Line to Plane : Contribution to the Analysis of the Pictorial Elements, 1947, trans, Howard Deastyne and Hilla Rebay, Solomon Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt; showed how drawn lines and marks can be expressive without any association with a representational image. From the most ancient cultures and throughout history visual language has been used to encode meaning: "The Bronze Age Badger Stone on Ilkly Moor is covered in circles, lines, hollow cups,winged figures, a spread hand, an ancient swastika, an embryo, a shooting star? … It's a story-telling rock, a message from a world before (written) words."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyatt|first=Derek|date=Autumn 1995|title=To Strengthen the Tribe|journal=Modern Painters|volume=8|issue=3|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Gregory]] suggests that, "Perhaps the ability to respond to absent imaginary situations," as our early ancestors did with paintings on rock, "represents an essential step towards the development of abstract thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gregory|first=R. L.|authorlink=Richard Gregory|title=The Intelligent Eye|year=1970|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|isbn=0-297-00021-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perception ===
The sense of sight operates selectively. [[Perception]] is not a passive recording of all that is in front of the eyes, but is a continuous judgement of scale and colour relationships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Itten|first=Johannes|authorlink=Johannes Itten|title=The Elements of Color: A Treatise on the '''Colour System''' of Johannes Itten Based on his Book "The Art of Colour"|year=1983|origyear=1970|others=trans. Ernst van Hagen|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold|location=Wokingham|isbn=0-442-30581-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and includes making categories of forms to classify images and shapes in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnheim|first=Rudolf|authorlink=Rudolf Arnheim|title=Visual Thinking|year=1970|publisher=Faber|location=London|isbn=0-571-09365-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children of six to twelve months are to be able through experience and learning to discriminate between circles, squares and triangles.The child from this age onwards learns to classify objects, abstracting essential qualities and comparing them to other similar objects. Before objects can be perceived and identified the child must be able to classify the different shapes and sizes that a single object may appear to have when it is seen in varying surroundings and from different aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon, M D, The Psychology of Perception, Penguin, London, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innate structures in the brain===
The perception of a shape requires the grasping of the essential structural features, to produce a "whole" or ''[[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]]''. The theory of the ''gestalt'' was proposed by [[Christian von Ehrenfels]] in 1890. He pointed out that a melody is still recognisable when played in different keys and argued that the whole is not simply the sum of its parts but a total structure. [[Max Wertheimer]] researched von Ehrenfels' idea, and in his "Theory of Form" (1923) – nicknamed "the dot essay" because it was illustrated with abstract patterns of dots and lines – he concluded that the perceiving eye tends to bring together elements that look alike (similarity groupings) and will complete an incomplete form (object hypothesis). An array of random dots tends to form configurations (constellations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Behrens|first=Roy R.|year=1998|title=Art, Design and Gestalt Theory|journal=Leonardo|volume=31|issue=4|pages=299–303|doi=10.2307/1576669|jstor=1576669|publisher=Leonardo, Vol. 31, No. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; All these innate abilities demonstrate how the eye and the mind are seeking pattern and simple whole shapes. When we look at more complex visual images such as paintings we can see that art has been a continuous attempt to "notate" visual information.

=== Visual thinking ===
{{main article|Visual thinking}}
Thought processes are diffused and interconnected and are cognitive at a sensory level. The mind thinks at its deepest level in sense material, and the two hemispheres of the brain deal with different kinds of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas R Blakeslee, ''The right brain: a new understanding of the unconscious mind and its creative power'', Macmillan, London, 1980. {{ISBN|0-333-29090-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brain is divided into two hemispheres and a [[Corpus callosum|thick bundle of nerve fibres]] enable these two halves to communicate with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Roger W Sperry, Some effects of disconnecting the cerebral hemispheres, Nobel Lecture, Science 217, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Gazzaniga, Tales from Both Sides of the Brain, Hopewell, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In most people the ability to organize and produce speech is predominantly located in the left side. Appreciating spatial perceptions depends more on the right hemisphere, although there is a left hemisphere contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solbaram.org/articles/humind.html|title=How the Human Brain Developed and How the Human Mind Works|last=Davidmann|first=Manfred|date=1998-04-20|work=Towards a Better Future: The Works of Manfred Davidmann}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to understand how designers solve problems, [[L. Bruce Archer]] proposed "that the way designers (and everybody else, for that matter) form images in their [[mind's eye]], manipulating and evaluating ideas before, during and after externalising them, constitutes a cognitive system comparable with but different from, the verbal language system. Indeed we believe that human beings have an innate capacity for cognitive modelling, and its expression through sketching, drawing, construction, acting out and so on, that is fundamental to human thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Archer|first=L. Bruce|authorlink=L. Bruce Archer|year=1979|title=Whatever Became of Design Methodology?|journal=Design Studies|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17–18|doi=10.1016/0142-694X(79)90023-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art in education===
The visual language begins to develop in babies as the eye and brain become able to focus, and be able to recognize patterns. Children's drawings show a process of increasing perceptual awareness and range of elements to express personal experience and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Betty Edwards, Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, Tarcher, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the visual aspect of language communication in education has been referred to as [[graphicacy]],&lt;ref&gt;Visual Education, Schools Council, York, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; as a parallel discipline to literacy and numeracy. The ability to think and communicate in visual terms is part of, and of equal importance in the learning process, with that of literacy and numeracy. The visual artist, as [[Michael Twyman]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael Twyman, Graphic Images in Relation to Learning, Typography Unit, Reading University, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out, has developed the ability to handle the visual language to communicate ideas. This includes both the understanding and conception and the production of concepts in a visual form.
