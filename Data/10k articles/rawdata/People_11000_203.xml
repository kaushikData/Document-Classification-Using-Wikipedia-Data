'''Alfred H. Caspary''' (1877–1955), of [[New York City]], was a [[Philately|philatelist]] responsible for assembling one of the finest collections of [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States|United States postage stamps]]. He also served in a number of philatelic positions in the United States and in [[England]].

==Collecting interests==
Caspary is remembered for his collection of United States stamps, which included postmaster provisionals of both the United States of America and the [[Confederate States of America]], The collection also included United States carrier and local stamps. 

Around the time Ferrary’s [[Buenos Aires 1859 1p "In Ps" tete-beche pair]] reached the market in 1923 and was acquired by [[Alfred Lichtenstein (philatelist)|Alfred Lichtenstein]], another example of the Buenos Aires “Barquitos” “in Pesos” tete-beche was discovered in Germany and sold to Alfred H. Caspary. The Caspary pair proved that Position 33 in the plate of 48 was upside down relative to all others.

When Caspary died, the collection was broken up and sold by the H.R. Harmer auction house between 1955 and 1958, realizing record prices for many of the finest items in the collection.

After Caspary’s death, H. R. Harmer sold his South American collection in June 1958. Following Caspary the “In Peso” vertical tete-beche pair was owned in succession by Lars Amundsen, Joseph Schatzkes, John R. Boker Jr., and Gabriel Sanchez. It entered the Islander Collection at the October 28, 1982 Corinphila auction of the Sanchez collection, realizing CHF 181,500 (approximately US $89,000).

==Philatelic activity==
Alfred Caspary was one of the founders of the [[Philatelic Foundation]] and served as a member. At the Committee of the [[Royal Philatelic Society London]], Caspary was named an advisor.

==Honors and awards==
His signature was carried by a distinguished group of American philatelists to the Philatelic Congress of Great Britain in 1954 as he was too ill to make the trip to England in 1952 to sign the [[Roll of Distinguished Philatelists]].  The signature was then photographed and transferred to the roll. In 1977 Caspary was named to the [[American Philatelic Society Hall of Fame]].

==Early life==
Littlejohn was born in [[Monterey, California]] to an African American and Native American (Cherokee) father and an Irish mother. She was raised by hippy parents who were passionate about education. Littlejohn grew up in a family of six children and was the second youngest and the only female of the group. Growing up in a rural cabin with few amenities, Littlejohn did not watch television until the age nine.  She developed a deep interested in literature at a young age, becoming fond of authors such as [[Toni Morrison]], [[Isabel Allende]], [[Gabriel Garcia Marquez]], and [[Ernest Hemingway]].&lt;ref name= Core&gt;{{cite web|author= Jeff O'Connell|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0801/is_7_66/ai_n14821362|title= Core curriculum: do your abs pass the test?

==Early career==
In high school, Littlejohn participated in sports including track, martial arts and basketball.

After training for several years and learning gymnastics at age 25, Littlejohn entered her first fitness competition, the NPC San Jose Fitness and Figure Championships in 2001, where she took first place in fitness and figure. Following her first victory, Littlejohn decided to compete solely in figure competitions.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Competitive career==
Littlejohn's highest professional competitive achievements were runner-up at the 2006 Ms. Figure Olympia and winning the 2006 inaugural IFBB Palm Beach Pro Figure Championships.

'''Carlos Franqui''' (December 4, 1921 – April 16, 2010) was a [[Cuba]]n writer, poet, journalist, art critic, and political activist.  After the [[Fulgencio Batista]] coup in 1952, he became involved with the [[26th of July Movement]] which was headed by [[Fidel Castro]]. Upon the success of the [[Cuban Revolution]] in 1959, he was placed in charge of the rebellion's newspaper ''[[Revolución (newspaper)|Revolución]]'', which became an official government publication. When he came to have political differences with the regime, he left Cuba with his family. In 1968 he broke with the Cuban government when he signed a letter condemning the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] invasion of [[Czechoslovakia]]. He became a vocal critic of the Castro government, writing frequently until his death on April 16, 2010.

==Early years==
Born in a cane field, he entered a [[vocational school]], where he joined the [[Communist Party of Cuba]]. He gave up the opportunity to enter the [[University of Havana]] to become a professional organizer for the party at the age of 20. After successfully organizing the party in several small towns, he left the organization and became an unaffiliated leftist.&lt;ref name="lieurac"&gt;{{cite web|year=2001 |url=http://www.lieurac.com/franqui_en.html |title=Carlos Franqui, the story of a revolution |format=MOVIE |publisher=lieurac |accessdate=September 7, 2007 |first=Michel |last=Le Bayon |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930010855/http://www.lieurac.com/franqui_en.html |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He turned to journalism to make a living and became involved in several literary and artistic movements. He developed friendships with Cuban artists, including writer [[Guillermo Cabrera Infante]] and painter [[Wifredo Lam]].

==Role in the Cuban revolution==
After the [[Fulgencio Batista]] coup in 1952, he became involved with the [[26th of July Movement]] headed by Fidel Castro. He co-edited the underground newspaper ''Revolución'' in Havana, taking responsibility for public information. One article in particular reported the landing of the ''[[Granma (yacht)|Granma]]'' and confirmed that Castro was safe in the Sierra Maestra. For this he was jailed and tortured by the police. Upon his release, he went into exile first in Mexico and then in [[Florida]], but was soon drafted by Castro into the Sierra Maestra to continue work on ''Revolución'' and also on [[Radio Rebelde]], the guerilla movement's clandestine radio station.&lt;ref name="rebel1"&gt;{{cite web |date=April 1993 |url = http://donmoore.tripod.com/central/cuba/rebel1.html|title = Revolution!

Upon the success of the [[Cuban Revolution]] in 1959, he was placed in charge of ''Revolución'', which became an official organ of the government. During his tenure as editor, he maintained a degree of independence from the official line and emphasized the arts and literature, launching the literary supplement ''Lunes de Revolución'', which was directed by [[Guillermo Cabrera Infante]] and featured high quality work by Cuban and international authors. His position allowed him to travel extensively outside of Cuba.&lt;ref name=portrait&gt;{{cite book | last = Carlos Franqui| title = Family Portrait with Fidel | year = 1985 | publisher = Random House UK Ltd. | isbn= 0-224-02268-7 |page= 65}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his European travels, he met artists and intellectuals, including [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Joan Miró|Miró]], [[Alexander Calder|Calder]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], and [[Julio Cortázar]]. A significant number of these artists traveled to Cuba. One of the most memorable visits was that of Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir.&lt;ref name=portrait/&gt;

Franqui had frequent disagreements with the government, which eventually led to his resignation from "Revolución".{{when|date=February 2016}} The paper was closed a few months later.{{when|date=February 2016}} After his resignation, Franqui dedicated himself to art projects. In 1967 he organized the ''[[Salón de Mayo]]'' exhibit in Havana, where many of the world's leading artists were represented.

==Exile from Cuba==
He continued to have problems with the Cuban government. He was allowed to leave Cuba with his family{{when|date=February 2016}}–an émigré rather than an exile–and settled in Italy where he worked as an unpaid cultural representative of Cuba. In 1968, he officially broke with the Cuban government when he signed a letter condemning the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] invasion of [[Czechoslovakia]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Many [[Cuban exile]]s shunned Franqui because of the active role he had played in the Cuban revolution.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Now definitively an exile, his literary production increased. Franqui authored several accounts of the Cuban Revolution, including, ''El Libro de los Doce'' (The Book about the Twelve) and ''Diario de la Revolución Cubana'' (The Diary of the Cuban Revolution). He collaborated with [[Joan Miró]], [[Antoni Tàpies]], [[Alexander Calder]], and others on graphic arts publications as well as other works about contemporary art, some of which he edited in Italian under pen names. He wrote several books of poetry as well.

He continued to campaign against repression in Cuba and other countries. He was officially branded a traitor by the Cuban government, which accused him of having ties to the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. After breaking relations with Cuba the Cuban government began airbrushing Franqui's image from photographs that documented the revolution's early years. 
[[Image:Castro Franqui Franqui erased.jpg||center|700px]]
Franqui responded with a poem:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year = 2007|url = http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/research/digitaltampering/|title = digital tampering|publisher = |accessdate = September 7, 2007|first = Hany|last = Farid|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100804022639/http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/research/digitaltampering/#|archive-date = August 4, 2010|dead-url = yes|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;I discover my photographic death.
Do I exist?
I am a little black,
I am a little white,
I am a little shit,
On Fidel's vest.&lt;/poem&gt;

In the early 1990s, he moved to [[Puerto Rico]],&lt;ref name="lieurac"/&gt; where he lived in semi-retirement. In 1996, he founded ''[[Carta de Cuba]]'', a quarterly journal featuring work produced in Cuba by independent journalists and writers. He edited the publication until his death on April 16, 2010, in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date= April 17, 2010|url = http://www.elpais.com/articulo/Necrologicas/Carlos/Franqui/escritor/critico/arte/cubano/elpeputec/20100417elpepinec_2/Tes |title = Carlos Franqui, writer and critic of Cuban art| work = El Pais | accessdate = April 17, 2010 | last=Salas |first= Roger |language=es }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Gnosticism}}
'''Cerinthus''' ({{lang-el|Κήρινθος}}; fl. c. 50-100 AD) was a [[gnostic]] and to some, an [[early Christian]], who was prominent as a [[heresiarch]] in the view of the early [[Church Fathers]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;See, in particular, Irenaeus, ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]]'', Book I, III and relative [[Cerinthus#External links|External links]]&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the Church Fathers, he used the [[Gospel of Cerinthus]], and denied that the Supreme God made the physical world.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From the Lost Teachings of Polycarp: Identifying Irenaeus' Apostolic Presbyter and the Author of As Diognetum|last=Hill|first=Charles E.|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|year=2006|isbn=3-16-148699-4|location=Tubingen, Germany|pages=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Cerinthus' interpretation, the Christ descended upon Jesus at [[baptism of Jesus|baptism]] and guided him in ministry and the performing of miracles, but left him at the [[death and resurrection of Jesus|crucifixion]].&lt;ref name="Gundry"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Survey of the New Testament|last=Gundry|first=Robert|publisher=Zondervan|year=2012|isbn=978-0-310-49474-4|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|pages=536, 539}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, [[Www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103126.htm|Against Heresies, 1.26.1]]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to the [[Ebionites]], he maintained that Jesus was not born of a virgin, but was a mere man, the biological son of Mary and Joseph.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103126.htm Against Heresies, 1.26.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Christian tradition describes Cerinthus as a contemporary to and opponent of [[John the Evangelist]], who may have written the [[First Epistle of John]]&lt;ref&gt;1 John 2:18, 19; 4:3&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Second Epistle of John]] to warn the less mature in faith and doctrine about the changes Cerinthus was making to the original gospel. According to early Christian sources, the Apostle John wrote his gospel specifically to refute the teachings of Cerinthus.&lt;ref&gt;Hill (2006), pp. 29, 30 citing Irenaeus, Against Heresies, 3.11.1&lt;/ref&gt;

All that is known about Cerinthus comes from the writing of his theological opponents.

==Biography==
Cerinthus flourished during the second half of the first century, though the date of his birth and his death are unknown. None of Cerinthus' actual writings seem to have survived. Our most detailed understanding of the man Cerinthus' teachings are from the 4th century Bishop [[Epiphanius of Salamis]], a few centuries after his death, though Irenaeus of Lyon (c. 135-202) briefly outlines Cerinthus' beliefs in his five books against Gnosticism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103126.htm|Against Heresies, 1.26.1, 2]]; [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103311.htm 3.11.1-3]&lt;/ref&gt; Publication of surviving fragments of [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus of Rome's]] (c. 170-235) ''Capita Adversus Caium''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gwynn|first=John|date=July 1888|title=Commentary on Revelation|url=|journal=Hermantha|volume=6|pages=397–418|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrate Epiphanius drew heavily from Hippolytus' ''Refutation of the Thirty-two Heresies''.&lt;ref&gt;ibid, pp. 406-409. Epiphanius' account of Cerinthus being angry at Paul for not circumcising Titus, for instance, seems to be based on Hippolytus' ''Capita Adversus Caium''. Williams (2009), p. 119 Cf. Gwynn (1888), p. 487&lt;/ref&gt;

Irenaeus writes that Cerinthus was educated in the Gnosis of the Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;Griggs (1990), p. 47, citing Against Heresies, 1.26.1&lt;/ref&gt; According to Epiphanius, Cerinthus was the instigator of trouble against the Apostles  Paul and Peter at Jerusalem, and had sent out men to Antioch commanding that gentile converts must be circumcised and keep the [[Law of Moses|Law]], prompting the convention of the [[Council of Jerusalem|Jerusalem Council]] (c. 50).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Panarion of Epiphanius of Salamis, Book I|last=Williams|first=Frank|publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV|year=2009|isbn=978-90-04-17017-9|location=Leiden|pages=117–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; After these things, Epiphanius says that Cerinthus founded a school in the Roman province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia Minor]], which at its height spread into the province of [[Galatia (Roman province)|Galatia]]. According to Galatian tradition, Paul wrote his epistle to the Galatians against Cerinthus' followers who were troubling the church.&lt;ref&gt;ibid, pp. 120, 121&lt;/ref&gt;

In Asia, early Christian writers identify Cerinthus as an adversary of the Apostle John. According to Irenaeus, his teacher [[Polycarp]] (a disciple of the Apostle John) told the story that John the Apostle rushed out of a [[Thermae|bathhouse]] at Ephesus without bathing when he found out Cerinthus was inside, exclaiming, "Let us fly, last even the bath-house fall down, because Cerinthus, the enemy of the truth, is inside!"&lt;ref&gt;Against Heresies, 3.3.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From the Lost Teachings of Polycarp|last=Hill|first=Charles E.|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|year=2006|isbn=3-16-148699-4|location=Tubingen, Germany|pages=28, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irenaeus also relates that John sought by proclamation of his gospel "to remove that error which by Cerinthus had been disseminated among men".&lt;ref&gt;Against Heresies, 3.11.1. See Hill (2006), pp. 29, 30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
We do not have a fully developed understanding of Cerinthus' teachings. The earliest surviving account of Cerinthus is that in [[Irenaeus|Irenæus]]' refutation of Gnosticism, ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103126.htm|1.26.1]]; [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103302.htm 3.2.1, 2]; [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103303.htm 3.3.4]; 3.11&lt;/ref&gt; which was written about 170 AD. According to Irenæus, Cerinthus, a man educated in the wisdom of the Egyptians, claimed [[angel]]ic inspiration.

[[Epistula Apostolorum|The Epistula Apostolorum]], a little-known 2nd-century text discovered in 1895, which is roughly contemporary  (c. 160-170) with the above work of Irenaeus, was written polemically against the teachings of Cerinthus, beginning with an admonition to those who might follow the teachings of Simon and Cerinthus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Early Egyptian Christianity: From its Origins to 451 C.E.|last=Griggs|first=C. Wilfred|publisher=E.J. Brill|year=1990|isbn=90-04-09159-9|location=London, New York, Kobenhavn, Koln|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scripture===
Cerinthus utilized a gospel identical to [[Gospel of the Ebionites|that of the Ebionites]], which the early church fathers identify as an abridged and falsified version of the [[Gospel of Matthew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mercer Dictionary of the Bible|last=Koch|first=Glenn A.|work=Ebionites, Gospel of|publisher=Mercer University Press|year=1990|isbn=0-86554-373-9|editor-last=MIlls|editor-first=Watson E.|location=|pages=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Irenaeus, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103126.htm Against Heresies, 1.26.2]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[Marcion of Sinope]], a 2nd-century Gnostic who was hostile to the God of the Hebrews proclaimed in the Law and prophets,&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103127.htm Against Heresies, 1.27.2]&lt;/ref&gt; Cerinthus recognized Jewish scripture and professed to follow the God of the Hebrews, though Cerinthus denied that he made the world.&lt;ref name="Against Heresies, 1.26.1"&gt;Irenaeus, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103126.htm Against Heresies, 1.26.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation===
Cerinthus taught that the visible world and heavens were not made by the supreme being, but by a lesser power ([[Demiurge]]) distinct from him. He taught that this power was ignorant of the existence of the [[Supreme Being|Supreme God]].

His use of the term demiurge (literally, craftsman) for the creator fits [[Platonism|Platonic]], [[Neopythagorean]], [[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonic]], and [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] schools of philosophy, which dominated the learned environment of the eastern Mediterranean, see also [[Hellenistic Judaism]]. Unlike true [[Gnostics]] that followed him, Cerinthus taught that the demiurge was good, more like Philo's [[logos]] than the evil demiurge taught by [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]].

===Jesus===
Cerinthus distinguished between the man [[Jesus]] and the [[Christ]]. He denied the supernatural [[virgin birth of Jesus]], making him the biological son of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] and [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], and taught that the Christ descended upon him in the form of a dove from the Supreme Ruler at baptism (see also [[Adoptionism]]) and left him again at his crucifixion—never to embody the flesh.&lt;ref name="Against Heresies, 1.26.1"/&gt; Cerinthus is also said to have taught that Jesus will be raised from the dead at the [[End time|Last Day]], [[Resurrection of the Dead|when all men will rise with Him]].

In describing Jesus as a natural-born man, Cerinthus agreed with the [[Ebionites]].&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103126.htm Against heresies, 1.26.2]&lt;/ref&gt; In portraying Christ as a spirit that came from heaven, undertook its divine task in the material world, and then returned, he anticipates the fully developed Christian Gnosticism in later decades. Irenaeus numbers Cerinthus among those Gnostics who denied that Jesus is the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos (Word)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103311.htm Against Heresies, 3.11.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish law===
{{see also|Biblical law in Christianity}}
Cerinthus instructed his followers to maintain strict adherence to [[Mosaic law]] for the attainment of salvation. This [[soteriology|soteriological worldview]] is termed [[Legalism (theology)|legalism]]. This view contradicts the [[Christian soteriology|soteriology]] conveyed at the [[Council of Jerusalem]] (c. 50 AD), when [[Paul of Tarsus]] established the understanding that Christians are not required to be [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcised]] to attain [[salvation]]. The [[Acts of the Apostles|Book of Acts]] chapter {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|15|NIV}} lists only four lifestyle requirements for Gentile converts to Christianity for the purpose of their attending synagogue, after which they would learn the law of Moses as it was preached every Shabbat (Acts 15:21). Many scholars see these four requirements set out by the Jerusalem Council as a parallel to [[Noahide Law]]. Conversely, certain Jewish Christian sects, including the [[Cerinthians]], recognized Mosaic law as both practicable and necessary.

===Eschatology===
[[Eusebius|Eusebius of Ceasarea]], in his ''Ecclesiastical History'', relates how, according to Caius of Rome, Cerinthus,&lt;blockquote&gt;...by means of revelations which he pretends were written by a great apostle, brings before us marvelous things which he falsely claims were shown him by angels; and he says that after the resurrection the kingdom of Christ will be set up on earth, and that the flesh dwelling in Jerusalem will again be subject to desires and pleasures. And being an enemy of the Scriptures of God, he asserts, with the purpose of deceiving men, that there is to be a period of a thousand years for marriage festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm Ecclesiastical History, 3.28.2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is, however, improbable that this statement is true of Cerinthus' beliefs. Caius of Rome is identified with those whom [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] styles the ''[[Alogi]]'', who, "refusing to accept an 'apocryphon' because of the deep and difficult sayings in the Revelation . . . say that they are not John's composition but Cernthus', and have no right to a place in the church."&lt;ref&gt;Ephiphanius, [https://books.google.com/books?id=brxgNsxJKkUC&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;ots=lzr2-qtwl5&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Panarion, "Against the sect which does not accept the gospel according to John and his Revelation", 51, 3.4]&lt;/ref&gt; Caius' view was refuted by his contemporary, [[Hippolytus of Rome]], in a lost work entitled ''Capita Adversus Caium'' (Heads Against Caius),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03144a.htm The Catholic Encyclopedia, "Caius"]&lt;/ref&gt; of which only fragments&lt;ref&gt;The fragments preserved contain Caius' objections to Rev. 8:8, 12; 9:2, 3, 15; 20:2, 3 accompanied by Hippolytus' refutation.&lt;/ref&gt; preserved in a commentary of Dionysius Bar-Salibi survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gwynn|first=J.|date=1888|title=Hippolytus and his 'Heads against Gaius'|url=|journal=Hermantha|volume=6|pages=397–418|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works attributed to Cerinthus==
Cerinthus may be the alleged recipient of the [[Apocryphon of James]] (codex I, text 2 of the [[Nag Hammadi library]]), although the name written is largely illegible.  A late second century heretical Christian sect (later dubbed the ''[[Alogi]]'') headed by Caius of Rome alleged Cerinthus was the true author of the [[Gospel of John]] and [[Book of Revelation]]. According to [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03144a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Caius]: "Additional light has been thrown on the character of Caius's dialogue against [[Proclus (Montanist)|Proclus]] by Gwynne's publication of some fragments from the work of Hippolytus "Contra Caium" (Hermathena, VI, p.&amp;nbsp;397 sq.); from these it seems clear that Caius maintained that the [[Apocalypse of John]] was a work of the Gnostic Cerinthus." The [[Book of Revelation]] (Apocalypse) is unanimously attributed to John by the early Christians before that time; third century theologian [[Tertullian]] indicates that all John's foster churches (i.e., the churches of Asia Minor) when traced back to the beginning all rested on the Apostle John as its author, and that it receives the same recognition in all the other churches.&lt;ref&gt;Against Marcion,4.5, Tertullian writes, ''"On the whole, then, if that is evidently more true which is earlier, if that is earlier which is from the very beginning, if that is from the beginning which has the apostles for its authors, then it will certainly be quite as evident, that that comes down from the apostles,  which has been kept as a sacred deposit  in the churches of the apostles,"'' and after detailing the churches of Peter and Paul, he continues, ''"We have also St. John's foster churches.  For although Marcion rejects his Apocalypse, the order  of the bishops (thereof), when traced up to their origin, will yet rest on John as their author. In the same manner is recognised the excellent source  of the other churches."''&lt;/ref&gt; Irenaeus makes consistent remarks.&lt;ref&gt;Against Heresies, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103530.htm 5.30.1], when expressing the correct reading of the number of the Beast; Cf. [[Www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103530.htm|5.28.2]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cerinthus in literature ==
Cerinthus is featured in ''John's Story: The Last Eyewitness'', part of Christian writer [[Tim LaHaye]]'s ''[[Tim Lahaye#The Jesus Chronicles|The Jesus Chronicles]]''. In the book Cerinthus, much to the disciple John's frustration, has begun spreading his gnostic teachings to the populace, whereupon John is moved to write his counter-argument: the [[Gospel of John]].

While pursuing an acting career in Hollywood, she changed her name to "Chloe Bennet", after having trouble booking gigs with her last name.

{{Quote box |quote="I think what's really dangerous with what, continuously, is happening with Asian-Americans in Hollywood is there's a narrative that white Hollywood, or just any other ethnicity really in Hollywood gives to Asian-Americans that, 'You're the butt of the joke.'

Bennet has described the American film and television industry as racist against Asians. In a 2016 interview, she noted, "Oh, the first audition I went on after I changed my name [from Wang to Bennet], I got booked. So that's a pretty clear little snippet of how Hollywood works."&lt;ref name="changed her"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tharp |first=Sharon |date=September 1, 2017 |url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chloe-bennet-changed-her-name-because-hollywood-racism-w500747 |title=Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D's Chloe Bennet Changed Her Last Name Because 'Hollywood Is Racist' |work=[[Us Weekly]]|accessdate=May 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, after actor [[Ed Skrein]] stepped down from his role as Major Ben Daimio in the then-in production film ''[[Hellboy (2019 film)|Hellboy]]'' following backlash over the fact that Skrein, a white man, was playing Daimio, a character who is [[Japanese-American]] in the ''[[Hellboy]]'' comics, Bennet wrote a since-deleted post on [[Instagram]] in which she applauded Skrein's decision, and addressed her own experiences as an Asian actor in Hollywood, saying, "Changing my last name doesn't change the fact that my BLOOD is half Chinese, that I lived in China, speak Mandarin or that I was culturally raised both American and Chinese. It means I had to pay my rent, and Hollywood is racist and wouldn't cast me with a last name that made them uncomfortable."&lt;ref name="changed her" /&gt;

His duties corresponded to the offices of [[Clerk of the Crown in Chancery|Clerk of the Crown]] and [[Clerk of the Hanaper]] in the [[Court of Chancery|English Chancery]].&lt;ref name="Gardiner1966"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1966/feb/03/petition-representation-of-irish-peers#column_573|title=PETITION: REPRESENTATION OF IRISH PEERS|last=Gardiner, Baron Gardiner|first=Gerald|authorlink=Gerald Gardiner, Baron Gardiner|date=3 February 1966|work=HL Deb|publisher=Hansard|nopp=Y |page=vol 272 col.573|accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Latterly, the office's most important functions were to issue [[writ of election|writs of election]] to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster Parliament]], both for the Commons and for [[Irish representative peers]] in the Lords.

==Functions==
In 1859 commissioners investigating the Irish Chancery described duties of the office thus:&lt;ref name="comm1859p6t7"&gt;Chancery Commission 1859, [http://www.dippam.ac.uk/eppi/documents/13990/page/362004 pp.6–7]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
The office of the Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper in Chancery is regulated by the Act of 6 and 7 Wm. IV., cap. 74, which provides that the office shall consist of the Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper, and two clerks to be appointed by him.

The duties of the office are threefold :—first, those connected with the petty-bag or law side of the Court; secondly, preparing and issuing certain writs specified in the schedule to the Act of 4 Geo. IV., cap. 61; and thirdly, swearing gentlemen into office before the Lord Chancellor.

The business of the petty-bag or law-side of the Court, is confined to proceedings to enforce the performance of a recognizance entered into in the Court, and to proceedings in cases of debt against officers of the Court, there being an antiquated privilege appertaining to officers of the Court of Chancery, that they are not amenable in cases of debt to the ordinary tribunals of the country, but must be sued in their own Court.

Prior to the acts, enumerated thus in 1817 by commissioners into legal costs:&lt;ref name="commissioners1817"/&gt;
*As clerk of the Crown, it is his duty, as appears by his patent, to make out and [[Engrossing (disambiguation)|engross]] all [[letters patent]] for the appointment of [[High sheriff|sheriff]]s; all [[Justice of the peace|commissions of the peace]] and [[gaol delivery]], and all process in recognizances of [[The Staple|the staple]]; with some other duties, not now of frequent recurrence. 
*As clerk of the Hanaper, he makes out all letters patent for lands granted by the Crown; all patents of nobility, spiritual and temporal; all [[Right of presentation|presentation]]s by the Crown, to ecclesiastical dignities, and [[benefice]]s; he is also to prepare and engross all [[charters of incorporation]], grants of fairs, markets, letters of [[denization]], pensions, offices, &amp;c.; and all [[injunction]]s, and [[writs of execution]] of decrees in Chancery, [[writs of attachment]], and commissions of rebellion, with other Chancery writs.

Until 1836, the Clerk was appointed by [[letters patent]], and could himself appoint a deputy.&lt;ref name="act1836"/&gt; There were no statutory qualifications required for the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1907/apr/17/irish-chancery-court-appointments|title=Irish Chancery Court Appointments—Professional Qualifications.|last=Corbett|first=Thomas Lorimer |authorlink=Thomas Lorimer Corbett|date=17 April 1907|work=Hansard|nopp=Y |page=HC Deb vol 172 cc946–7|accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mandate from [[Edward IV]] enumerates "that the Clerc of the Hanapier continuelly receive the fees of the sele of writts, comisssions, and patents, and also all suche fynes as shall be made in the Chaunsery, and thereupon pay the Chaunsellor his fees, wages and rewardes accustomed, and deliver the remnant unto the Kyng's [[Exchequer of Ireland|Ex[checquer]]]. upon his accomptes, which he shall make yerly therof".&lt;ref name="19-edward-iv"/&gt; It also mandates the clerk to appoint deputies in the [[Court of King's Bench (Ireland)|King's Bench]] and [[Court of Common Pleas (Ireland)|Common Pleas]] to collect the fees and fines from those courts.&lt;ref name="19-edward-iv"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chancery.tcd.ie/document/close/19-edward-iv/8|title=Close Roll 19 Edward IV ; No.8|date=1479–80|work=CIRCLE|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The office of Clerk of the Hanaper is of old date in Ireland. In this office the writs relating to the suits of the subject, and the return thereon, were anciently kept in ''hanaperio'', a hamper; while those relating to the crown were placed in ''parva baga'', a little bag; whereon arose the names Hanaper and Petty Bag Offices.

The offices of clerk of the hanaper and clerk of the crown in Chancery were originally separate but came to be held by the same person in the seventeenth century and were later formally merged.&lt;ref name="Hand119"&gt;{{cite journal |volume=7 |first=G.

In 1789, the [[Attorney-General for Ireland]] told the [[Irish House of Commons]] that it had "been a matter of necessity to purchase home the office of Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper to the court of Chancery; the person who had held that employment had been for twenty years an absentee, during which time the business had been done in such an irregular and slovenly manner, that a reform was indispensable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Parliamentary Register: Or, History of the Proceedings and Debates of the House of Commons of Ireland ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3XRAAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA259|volume=IX|year=1790|publisher=Printed by P.

The Dutch have left behind a substantial legacy despite the limited size of their country. The Dutch people are generally seen as the pioneers of [[capitalism]]{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}, and their emphasis on a modern economy, [[secularism]], and a [[free market]] ultimately had a huge influence on the great powers of the West, especially the [[British Empire]], its [[Thirteen Colonies]], and ultimately the United States.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The traditional arts and culture of the Dutch encompasses various forms of [[traditional music]], [[dance]]s, [[architectural style]]s and clothing, some of which are globally recognizable. Internationally, Dutch painters such as [[Rembrandt]], [[Vermeer]] and [[Van Gogh]] are held in high regard. The dominant religion of the Dutch is [[Christianity]] (both [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Reformed Churches|Protestant]]), although in modern times the majority are no longer religious.

==History==
{{main|History of the Netherlands|History of Belgium|History of Flanders}}

===Emergence===
As with all ethnic groups, the [[ethnogenesis]] of the Dutch (and their predecessors) has been a lengthy and complex process. Though the majority of the defining characteristics (such as language, religion, architecture or cuisine) of the Dutch ethnic group have accumulated over the ages, it is difficult (if not impossible) to clearly pinpoint the exact emergence of the Dutch people; the interpretation of which is often highly personal. The text below hence focuses on the history of the Dutch ethnic group; for ''Dutch national history'', please see the history-articles of [[History of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]]. For Dutch colonial history, see the article on the [[Dutch Empire]].

====General====
{{Further|Germanic peoples|Migration Period|Foederati}}
In the first centuries CE, the Germanic tribes formed tribal societies with no apparent form of [[autocracy]] (chiefs only being elected in times of war), beliefs based [[Germanic paganism]] and speaking a dialect still closely resembling [[Proto-Germanic|Common Germanic]]. Following the end of the migration period in the West around 500, with large federations (such as the [[Franks]], [[Vandals]], [[Alamanni]] and [[Saxons]]) settling the decaying [[Roman Empire]], a series of monumental changes took place within these Germanic societies. Among the most important of these are their conversion from [[Germanic paganism]] to [[Christianity]], the emergence of a new political system, centered on kings, and a continuing process of emerging mutual unintelligibility of their various dialects.

====Specific====
{{Further|Franks|Old Frankish|Old Dutch}}
[[File:Clovis crop.jpg|thumb|left|The conversion of the Frankish king [[Clovis I|Clovis]] to Christianity would have great significance in helping shape the identity of the future Dutch people.&lt;ref&gt;'Clovis' conversion to Christianity, regardless of his motives, is a turning point in Dutch history as the elite now changed their beliefs. Their choice would way down its way on the common folk, of whom many (especially in the Frankish heartland of Brabant and Flanders) were less enthusiastic than the ruling class. Taken from ''Geschiedenis van de Nederlandse stam, part I: till 1648''. Page 203, 'A new religion', by [[Pieter Geyl]]. Wereldbibliotheek Amsterdam/Antwerp 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The general situation described above is applicable to most if not all modern European ethnic groups with origins among the [[Germanic tribes]], such as the Frisians, Germans, English and the North-Germanic (Scandinavian) peoples. In the Low Countries, this phase began when the [[Franks]], themselves a union of multiple smaller tribes (many of them, such as the [[Batavians|Batavi]], [[Chauci]], [[Chamavi]] and [[Chattuarii]], were already living in the Low Countries prior to the forming of the Frankish confederation), began to incur the northwestern provinces of the [[Western Roman Empire|Roman Empire]]. Eventually, in 358, the [[Salian Franks]], one of the three main subdivisions among the Frankish alliance&lt;ref&gt;Britannica: "They were divided into three groups: the Salians, the Ripuarians, and the Chatti, or Hessians."([http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/217113/Frank Link])&lt;/ref&gt;  settled the area's Southern lands as [[foederati]]; Roman allies in charge of border defense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349677/history-of-Low-Countries Encyclopædia Britannica Online; entry 'History of the Low Countries'. 10 May. 2009];''The Franks, who had settled in Toxandria, in Brabant, were given the job of defending the border areas, which they did until the mid-5th century''&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistically [[Old Frankish]] or [[Low Franconian]] gradually evolved into [[Old Dutch]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/409930/Dutch-language Encyclopædia Britannica Online; entry 'Dutch language' 10 May. 2009]; "''It derives from Low Franconian, the speech of the Western Franks, which was restructured through contact with speakers of North Sea Germanic along the coast.''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/640154/West-Germanic-languages/74783/Characteristics#ref=ref603810 Encyclopædia Britannica Online; entry 'West Germanic languages'. 10 May. 2009];''restructured Frankish—i.e., Dutch;''&lt;/ref&gt; which was first attested in the 6th century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onzetaal.nl/kalender/records/r2308.php W. Pijnenburg, A. Quak, T. Schoonheim &amp; D. Wortel, Oudnederlands Woordenboek]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119045215/http://www.onzetaal.nl/kalender/records/r2308.php |date=19 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas religiously the Franks (beginning with the [[upper class]]) converted to [[Christianity]] from around 500 to 700. On a political level, the Frankish warlords abandoned tribalism&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349677/history-of-Low-Countries Encyclopædia Britannica Online; entry 'History of the Low Countries'. 10 May. 2009]; ''The administrative organization of the Low Countries (...) was basically the same as that of the rest of the Frankish empire.''&lt;/ref&gt; and founded a number of kingdoms, eventually culminating in the [[Frankish Empire]] of [[Charlemagne]].

However, the population make-up of the Frankish Empire, or even early Frankish kingdoms such as [[Neustria]] and [[Austrasia]], was not dominated by Franks. Though the Frankish leaders controlled most of Western Europe, the Franks themselves were confined to the Northwestern part (i.e. the [[Rhineland]], the Low Countries and Northern [[France]]) of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349677/history-of-Low-Countries Encyclopædia Britannica Online; entry 'History of the Low Countries'. 10 May. 2009];''During the 6th century, Salian Franks had settled in the region between the Loire River in present-day France and the Coal Forest in the south of present-day Belgium. From the late 6th century, Ripuarian Franks pushed from the Rhineland westward to the Schelde. Their immigration strengthened the Germanic faction in that region, which had been almost completely evacuated by the Gallo-Romans.''&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the Franks in Northern France were assimilated by the general [[Gallo-Roman]] population, and took over their dialects (which became [[French language|French]]), whereas the Franks in the Low Countries retained their language, which would evolve into Dutch. The current Dutch-French language border has (with the exception of the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] in France and [[Brussels]] and the surrounding municipalities in Belgium) remained virtually identical ever since, and could be seen as marking the furthest pale of [[gallicization]] among the Franks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/209945/Fleming Encyclopædia Britannica Online; entry 'Fleming and Walloon'. 12 May. 2009];''The northern Franks retained their Germanic language (which became modern Dutch), whereas the Franks moving south rapidly adopted the language of the culturally dominant Romanized Gauls, the language that would become French. The language frontier between northern Flemings and southern Walloons has remained virtually unchanged ever since.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convergence===
{{Further|History of urban centers in the Dutch Low Countries|Burgundian Netherlands|Middle Dutch}}
The medieval cities of the Low Countries, which experienced major growth during the 11th and 12th century, were instrumental in breaking down the already relatively loose local form of feudalism. As they became increasingly powerful, they used their economical strength to influence the politics of their nobility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349677/history-of-Low-Countries Encyclopædia Britannica Online (use fee site); entry 'History of the Low Countries'. 10 May. 2009];''Thus, the town in the Low Countries became a communitas (sometimes called corporatio or universitas)—a community that was legally a corporate body, could enter into alliances and ratify them with its own seal, could sometimes even make commercial or military contracts with other towns, and could negotiate directly with the prince.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349677/history-of-Low-Countries Encyclopædia Britannica Online; entry 'History of the Low Countries'. 10 May. 2009];''The development of a town's autonomy sometimes advanced somewhat spasmodically as a result of violent conflicts with the prince. The citizens then united, forming conjurationes (sometimes called communes)—fighting groups bound together by an oath—as happened during a Flemish crisis in 1127–28 in Ghent and Brugge and in Utrecht in 1159.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349677/history-of-Low-Countries Encyclopædia Britannica Online; entry 'History of the Low Countries'. 10 May. 2009];''All the towns formed a new, non-feudal element in the existing social structure, and from the beginning merchants played an important role. The merchants often formed guilds, organizations that grew out of merchant groups and banded together for mutual protection while traveling during this violent period, when attacks on merchant caravans were common.''&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 14th century, beginning in and inspired by the County of Flanders,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349677/history-of-Low-Countries Encyclopædia Britannica Online; entry 'History of the Low Countries'. 10 May. 2009];''The achievements of the Flemish partisans inspired their colleagues in Brabant and Liège to revolt and raise similar demands; Flemish military incursions provoked the same reaction in Dordrecht and Utrecht''&lt;/ref&gt; the cities in the Low Countries gained huge autonomy and generally dominated or greatly influenced the various political affairs of the fief, including marriage succession.

While the cities were of great political importance, they also formed catalysts for medieval Dutch culture. Trade flourished, population numbers increased dramatically, and (advanced) education was no longer limited to the clergy; Dutch epic literature such as ''[[Elegast]]'' (1150), the ''[[Song of Roland|Roelantslied]]'' and ''[[Reynard the Fox|Van den vos Reynaerde]]'' (1200) were widely enjoyed. The various city guilds as well as the necessity of ''[[Water board (Netherlands)|water boards]]'' (in charge of dikes, canals, etc.) in the Dutch delta and coastal regions resulted in an exceptionally high degree of communal organization. It is also around this time, that ethnonyms such as ''Diets'' and ''Nederlands'' emerge.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Etymologisch Woordenboek van het Nederlands entry ''"Diets"''. {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the 14th century, the dukes of Burgundy gained a foothold in the Low Countries through the marriage in 1369 of [[Philip the Bold]] of Burgundy to the heiress of the Count of Flanders. This was followed by a series of marriages, wars, and inheritances among the other Dutch fiefs and around 1450 the most important fiefs were under Burgundian rule, while complete control was achieved after the end of the [[Guelders Wars]] in 1543, thereby unifying the fiefs of the Low Countries under one ruler. This process marked a new episode in the development of the Dutch ethnic group, as now political unity started to emerge, consolidating the strengthened cultural and linguistic unity.

===Consolidation===
{{Further|Timeline of Burgundian and Habsburg acquisitions in the Low Countries|Dutch Revolt|Early Netherlandish painting}}
[[File:Plakkaat van Verlatinghe.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Act of Abjuration]], signed on 26 July 1581, was the formal declaration of independence of the Dutch Low Countries.]]
Despite their linguistic and cultural unity, and (in the case of [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[County of Holland|Holland]]) economic similarities, there was still little sense of political unity among the Dutch people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=F3cxooRES2sC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;lpg=PA183&amp;dq=Johan+Huizinga+1960:62 |title=J. Huizinga (1960: 62) |publisher=Books.google.nl |date= |accessdate=27 August 2010|isbn=9789055892754 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the centralist policies of Burgundy in the 14th and 15th centuries, at first violently opposed by the cities of the Low Countries, had a profound impact and changed this. During [[Charles the Bold]]'s many wars, which were a major economic burden for the Burgundian Netherlands, tensions slowly increased. In 1477, the year of Charles' sudden [[Battle of Nancy|death at Nancy]], the Low Countries rebelled against their new liege, [[Mary of Burgundy]], and presented her with a set of demands.

The subsequently issued [[Great Privilege]] met many of these demands, which included that Dutch, not French, should be the administrative language in the Dutch-speaking provinces and that the [[States-General of the Netherlands|States-General]] had the right to hold meetings without the monarch's permission or presence. The overall tenure of the document (which was declared void by Mary's son and successor, [[Philip the Handsome|Philip IV]]) aimed for more autonomy for the counties and duchies, but nevertheless all the fiefs presented their demands together, rather than separately. This is evidence that by this time a sense of common interest was emerging among the provinces of the Netherlands. The document itself clearly distinguishes between the Dutch speaking and French speaking parts of the [[Seventeen Provinces]].

Following Mary's marriage to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], the Netherlands were now part of the Habsburg lands. Further centralized policies of the Habsburgs (like their Burgundian predecessors) again met with resistance, but, peaking with the formation of the collateral councils of 1531 and the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549]], were still implemented. The rule of [[Philip II of Spain]] sought even further centralist reforms, which, accompanied by religious dictates and excessive taxation, resulted in the [[Dutch Revolt]]. The Dutch provinces, though fighting alone now, for the first time in their history found themselves fighting a common enemy. This, together with the growing number of Dutch intelligentsia and the [[Dutch Golden Age]] in which [[Culture of the Netherlands|Dutch culture]], as a whole, gained international prestige, consolidated the Dutch as an ethnic group. This group partly assimilated Frisian and [[West Low German|Lower Saxon]] populations in the north and east of the Republic.

===National identity===
By the middle of the 16th century an overarching, 'national' (rather than 'ethnic') identity seemed in development in the Habsburg Netherlands, when inhabitants began to refer to it as their 'fatherland' and were beginning to be seen as a collective entity abroad; however, the persistence of language barriers, traditional strife between towns, and provincial particularism continued to form an impediment to more thorough unification.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. G. Parker, ''The Dutch Revolt'' (1985), 33–36, and Knippenberg &amp; De Pater, ''De eenwording van Nederland'' (1988), 17 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Following excessive [[taxation]] together with attempts at diminishing the traditional autonomy of the cities and estates in the Low Countries, followed by the religious oppression after being transferred to [[Habsburg Spain]], the Dutch revolted, in what would become the [[Eighty Years' War]]. For the first time in their history, the Dutch established their independence from foreign rule.&lt;ref name="GrNed"&gt;Source, the aforementioned 3rd chapter (p3), together with the initial paragraphs of chapter 4, on the establishment of the Dutch Republic.&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the war it became apparent that the goal of liberating all the provinces and cities that had signed the [[Union of Utrecht]], which roughly corresponded to the Dutch-speaking part of the Spanish Netherlands, was unreachable. The Northern provinces were free, but during the 1580s the South was recaptured by Spain, and, despite various attempts, the armies of the Republic were unable to expel them. In 1648, the [[Peace of Münster]], ending the [[Eighty Years' War]], acknowledged the independence of the [[Dutch Republic]], but maintained Spanish control of the [[Southern Netherlands]]. Apart from a brief reunification from 1815 until 1830, within the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] (which included the [[Francophone]]s/[[Walloons]]) the Dutch have been separated from the Flemings to this day.

==Ethnic identity==
[[File:Dutch street.jpg|thumb|upright|A typical November scene in the Dutch town [[Middelburg]], [[Netherlands]]]]
The ideologies associated with [[Romantic Nationalism|(Romantic) Nationalism]] of the 19th and 20th centuries never really caught on in the Netherlands, and this, together with being a relatively [[Monoethnicity|mono-ethnic]] society up until the late 1950s, has led to a relatively obscure use of the terms ''nation'' and ''ethnicity'' as both were largely overlapping in practice. Today, despite other ethnicities making up 19.6% of the Netherlands' population, this obscurity continues in colloquial use, in which ''Nederlander'' sometimes refers to the ethnic Dutch, sometimes to anyone possessing [[Dutch nationality law|Dutch citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;Figures based on a publication by the [[Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment]] [http://www.rivm.nl/vtv/object_map/o2194n21847.html (link)].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, many Dutchmen will object to being called ''Hollanders'' as a national denominator on much the same grounds as many [[Welshmen]] or [[Scottish people|Scots]] would object to being called ''[[English people|English]]'' instead of [[United Kingdom|British]].

However, the (re)definition of Dutch cultural identity has become a subject of public debate in recent years following the increasing influence of the [[European Union]] and the influx of non-Western immigrants in the post-[[World War II]] period. In this debate 'typically Dutch traditions' have been put to the foreground.&lt;ref&gt;Shetter (2002), 201&lt;/ref&gt;

In sociological studies and governmental reports, ethnicity is often referred to with the terms ''autochtoon'' and ''[[allochtoon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Knipscheer and R. Kleber, ''Psychologie en de multiculturele samenleving'' (Amsterdam 2005), 76 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  These legal concepts refer to place of birth and citizenship rather than cultural background and do not coincide with the more fluid concepts of ethnicity used by cultural anthropologists.

===Greater Netherlands===
As did many European ethnicities during the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Pan-Germanism]], [[Pan-Slavism]] and many other [[Pan-nationalism|Greater state movements]] of the day.&lt;/ref&gt; the Dutch also saw the emerging of various [[Greater Netherlands]]- and [[Pan-nationalism|pan]]-movements seeking to unite the Dutch-speaking peoples across the continent. During the first half of the 20th century, there was a prolific surge in writings concerning the subject. One of its most active proponents was the historian [[Pieter Geyl]], who wrote ''De Geschiedenis van de Nederlandsche stam'' (Dutch: ''The History of the Dutch tribe/people'') as well as numerous essays on the subject.

During World War II, when both Belgium and the Netherlands fell to [[Battle of France|German occupation]], fascist elements (such as the [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands|NSB]] and [[Verdinaso]]) tried to convince the [[Nazi]]s into combining the Netherlands and [[Flanders]]. The Germans however refused to do so, as this conflicted with their ultimate goal of a 'Germanic Europe'.{{clarify|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SmQ-gj50D4kC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=%22nederlanders+en+Vlamingen%22&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a Het nationaal-socialistische beeld van de geschiedenis der Nederlanden] by I. Schöffer. Amsterdam University Press. 2006. Page 92.&lt;/ref&gt; During the entire Nazi occupation, the Germans denied any assistance to Greater Dutch [[ethnic nationalism]], and, by decree of [[Hitler]] himself, actively opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;For example he gave explicit orders not to create a voluntary Greater Dutch [[Waffen SS]] division composed of soldiers from the Netherlands and Flanders. ([http://www.gutenberg-e.org/esk01/images/esk02c.html Link to documents])&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1970s marked the beginning of formal cultural and linguistic cooperation between Belgium (Flanders) and the Netherlands on an international scale.

==Statistics==
The total number of Dutch can be defined in roughly two ways. By taking the total of all people with full Dutch ancestry, according to the current CBS definition, resulting in an estimated 16,000,000 Dutch people,{{notetag|name=n1}} or by the sum of all people with both full and partial Dutch ancestry, which would result in a number around 25,000,000.

{{Main|Dutch language}}
Dutch is the main language spoken by most Dutch people. It is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] spoken by around 22 million people. Old Frankish, a precursor of the Dutch standard language, was first attested around 500,&lt;ref&gt;"''Maltho thi afrio lito''" is the oldest attested (Old) Dutch sentence, found in the Salic Law, a legal text written around 500. (Source; the [https://books.google.com/books?id=8e1HAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Maltho+thi+afrio+lito&amp;dq=Maltho+thi+afrio+lito Old Dutch dictionary]) {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a Frankish legal text, the [[Lex Salica]], and has a written record of more than 1500 years, although the material before around 1200 is fragmentary and discontinuous.

As a West Germanic language, Dutch is related to other languages in that group such as [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]], [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]]. Many West Germanic dialects underwent a series of sound shifts. The [[Anglo-Frisian nasal spirant law]] and [[Anglo-Frisian brightening]] resulted in certain early Germanic languages evolving into what are now English and West Frisian, while the [[Second Germanic sound shift]] resulted in what would become (High) German. Dutch underwent none of these sound changes and thus  occupies a central position in the [[West Germanic languages]] group.

Standard Dutch has a sound inventory of 13 vowels, 6 [[diphthongs]] and 23 consonants, of which the [[voiceless velar fricative]] (''[[hard and soft G in Dutch|hard ch]]'') is considered a well known sound, perceived as typical for the language. Other relatively well known features of the Dutch language and usage are the frequent use of digraphs like [[Oo (digraph)|Oo]], [[Ee (digraph)|Ee]], [[Letter combination of uu|Uu]] and [[Aa (digraph)|Aa]], the ability to form [[Compound (linguistics)|long compounds]] and the use of slang, including [[profanity]].

General consensus {{citation needed|date=December 2017}} among linguists is that the Dutch language has 28 main dialects. These dialects are usually grouped into six main categories; [[Hollandic]], [[West Flemish|West-Flemish/Zealandic]], [[East Flemish]], [[Brabantic]], [[Limburgish]] and [[Dutch Low Saxon|Dutch Saxon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://taalunieversum.org/taal/vragen/antwoord/8/ Taaluniversum website] on the Dutch dialects and main groupings. {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these dialects, Hollandic and Dutch Saxon are solely spoken by Northerners. Brabantic, East Flemish, [[West Flemish|West-Flemish/Zealandic]] and Limburgish are cross border dialects in this respect. Lastly, the dialectal situation is characterised by the major distinction between [[Hard and soft G in Dutch|'Hard G' and 'Soft G' speaking areas]] (see also [[Dutch phonology]]).

Dutch immigrants also exported the Dutch language. Dutch was spoken by some settlers in the United States as a native language from the arrival of the first permanent Dutch settlers in 1615, surviving in isolated ethnic pockets until about 1900, when it ceased to be spoken except by first generation Dutch immigrants. The Dutch language nevertheless had a significant impact on the region around [[New York City|New York]]. For example, the first language of [[President of the United States|American president]] [[Martin Van Buren]]&lt;!-- Even though he had a "tussenvoegsel" in his name, he spelled his name with a capital V; the Dutch name style convention does not apply.--&gt; was Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicoline Sijs van der|title=Cookies, Coleslaw, and Stoops: The Influence of Dutch on the North American Languages|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|year=2009|quote=Martin van Buren's mother tongue was Dutch|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Edward L. Widmer]]|title=Martin Van Buren|publisher=Times Books|year=2005|quote=Van Buren grew up speaking Dutch, a relic of the time before the Revolution when the inland waterways of North America were a polyglot blend of non-Anglophone communities. His family has resisted intermarriage with Yankees for five generations, and Van Buren trumpeted the fact proudly in his autobiography|pages=6–7|series=The American Presidents Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Dutch immigrants of the 20th century quickly began to speak the language of their new country. For example, of the inhabitants of New Zealand, 0.7% say their home language is Dutch,&lt;ref&gt;2006 New Zealand Census.&lt;/ref&gt; despite the percentage of Dutch heritage being considerably higher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/NewZealandPeoples/Dutch/4/en As many as 100,000 New Zealanders are estimated to have Dutch blood in their veins] (some 2% of the current population of New Zealand).&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch is currently an [[official language]] of the Netherlands, Belgium, [[Suriname]], [[Aruba]], [[Sint Maarten]], [[Curaçao]], the [[European Union]] and the [[Union of South American Nations]] (due to Suriname being a member). In [[South Africa]], [[Afrikaans]] is spoken, a daughter language of Dutch, which itself was an official language of South Africa until 1983. The Dutch, Flemish and Surinamese governments coordinate their language activities in the ''Nederlandse Taalunie'' ([[Dutch Language Union]]), an institution also responsible for governing the Dutch Standard language, for example in matters of [[orthography]].

===Etymology of autonym and exonym===
{{main|Theodiscus}}
The origins of the word ''Dutch'' go back to Proto-Germanic, the ancestor of all Germanic languages, ''*theudo'' (meaning "national/popular"); akin to Old Dutch ''dietsc'', [[Old High German]] ''diutsch'', [[Old English]] ''þeodisc'' and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''þiuda'' all meaning "(of) the common ([[Germanic peoples|Germanic]]) people". As the tribes among the Germanic peoples began to differentiate its meaning began to change. The [[Anglo-Saxons]] of [[England]] for example gradually stopped referring to themselves as ''þeodisc'' and instead started to use ''Englisc'', after their tribe. On the continent ''*theudo'' evolved into two meanings: ''Diets'' (meaning "Dutch (people)" (archaic)&lt;ref&gt;Until World War II, ''Nederlander'' was used synonym with ''Diets''. However the similarity to ''Deutsch'' resulted in its disuse when the [[History of the Netherlands (1939-1945)|German occupiers]] and Dutch [[fascist]]s extensively used that name to stress the Dutch as an ancient Germanic people. (Source; Etymologisch Woordenboek) {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Deutsch'' ([[German language|German]], meaning "German (people)"). At first the English language used (the contemporary form of) ''Dutch'' to refer to any or all of the Germanic speakers on the European mainland (e.g. the Dutch, the Frisians and the -various- Germans). Gradually its [[semantic shift|meaning shifted]] to the Germanic people they had most contact with, both because of their geographical proximity, but also because of the rivalry in trade and overseas territories: the people from the Republic of the Netherlands, the Dutch.

In the [[Dutch language]], the Dutch refer to themselves as ''Nederlanders''. ''Nederlanders'' derives from the Dutch word "''Neder''", a cognate of [[English language|English]] "''Nether''" both meaning "''low''", and "''near the sea''" (same meaning in both English and Dutch), a reference to the geographical texture of the Dutch homeland; the western portion of the [[North European Plain]].&lt;ref&gt;See J. Verdam, ''Middelnederlandsch handwoordenboek'' (The Hague 1932 (reprinted 1994)): "Nederlant, znw. o. I) Laag of aan zee gelegen land. 2) het land aan den Nederrijn; Nedersaksen, -duitschland." {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.pandora.be/michel.vanhalme/hermes29.htm|title=Hermes in uitbreiding|website=Users.pandora.be|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''neder-'' corresponds with the English ''nether-'', which means "low" or "down".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=nether |title=Archived copy |accessdate=6 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206145915/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=nether |archivedate=6 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not as old as ''Diets'', the term ''Nederlands'' has been in continuous use since 1250.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Names===
{{Main|Dutch name}}
Dutch surnames (and surnames of Dutch origin) are generally easily recognizable.
There are several main types of surnames in Dutch:
*[[Patronymic surname]]s; the name is based on the personal name of the father of the bearer. Historically this has been by far the most dominant form. These type of names fluctuated in form as the surname was not constant. If a man called [[Willem Janszoon|Willem Janssen]] (''William, John's son'') had a son named Jacob, he would be known as [[Jacob Willemszoon de Wet|Jacob Willemsen]] (''Jacob, Williams' son''). Following civil registry, the form at time of registry became permanent. Hence today many Dutch people are named after ancestors living in the early 19th century when civil registry was introduced to the [[Low Countries]]. These names rarely feature ''[[tussenvoegsels]]''.
*[[Toponymic surname]]s; the name is based on the location on which the bearer lives or lived. In Dutch this form of surname nearly always includes one or several ''tussenvoegsels'', mainly ''van'', ''van de'' and variants. Many immigrants removed the spacing, leading to derived names for well known people like [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]].&lt;ref&gt;See the history section of the [[Vanderbilt family]] article, or visit this [http://longislandgenealogy.com/vanderbilt/surnames.htm link]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520223532/http://longislandgenealogy.com/vanderbilt/surnames.htm |date=20 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While "van" denotes "of", Dutch surnames are sometimes associated with the [[upper class]] of society or aristocracy (cf. [[William the Silent|William of Orange]]). However, in Dutch ''van'' often reflects the original place of origin (Van Der Bilt – He who comes from [[De Bilt]]); rather than denote any aristocratic status.&lt;ref&gt;"It is a common mistake of Americans, or [[English-speaking world|anglophones]] in general, to think that the 'van' in front of a Dutch name signifies nobility." ('''[http://www.last-names.net/Articles/Place.asp Source.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611142832/http://www.last-names.net/Articles/Place.asp |date=11 June 2007 }}'''); "''Von'' may be observed in German names denoting nobility while the ''van'', ''van der'', ''van de'' and ''van den'' (whether written separately or joined, capitalized or not) stamp the bearer as Dutch and merely mean 'at', 'at the', 'of', 'from' and 'from the' ('''[http://www.genealogy.com/18_smith.html Source: Genealogy.com]'''), ([http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/nfd/component.php?act=detail&amp;naam=van+de+/+den+/+der Institute for Dutch surnames], in [[Dutch language|Dutch]])&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Occupational surname]]s; the name is based on the occupation of the bearer. Well known examples include Molenaar, Visser and Smit. This practice is similar to English surnames (the example names translate perfectly to [[Miller]], [[Fisher (surname)|Fisher]] and [[Smith (surname)|Smith]]).&lt;ref&gt;Most common names of occupational origin. Source 1947 Dutch census. {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Cognominal surname]]s; based on nicknames relating to [[Human physical appearance|physical appearance]]/other [[physical feature|feature]]s, on the appearance or character of the bearer (at least at the time of registration). For example "De Lange" (the tall one), "De Groot" (the big one), "De Dappere" (the brave one).
*Other surnames may relate to animals. For example; De Leeuw (''The Lion''), Vogels (''Birds''), Koekkoek (''Cuckoo'')  and Devalck (''The Falcon''); to a desired social status; e.g., Prins (''Prince''), De Koninck/Koning (''King''), De Keyzer/keizer (''Emperor''); color; e.g. Rood (''red'') Blauw (''blue'') de Wit (''the white''). There is also a set of made up or descriptive names; e.g. Naaktgeboren (''born naked'').

Dutch names can differ greatly in spelling. The surname ''Baks'', for example is also recorded as ''Backs'', ''Bacxs'', ''Bax'', ''Bakx'',  ''Baxs'', ''Bacx'', ''Backx'', ''Bakxs'' and ''Baxcs''. Though written differently, pronunciation remains identical. Dialectal variety also commonly occurs, with ''De Smet'' and ''De Smit'' both meaning ''Smith'' for example. Surnames of Dutch migrants in foreign environments (mainly the [[English-speaking world]] and [[Francophonie]]) are often adapted, not only in pronunciation but also in spelling.

===Religion===
{{Main|History of Dutch religion}}
{{Further|Religion in the Netherlands}}
Prior to the arrival of Christianity, the ancestors of the Dutch adhered to a form of [[Germanic paganism]] augmented with various [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic elements]]. At the start of the 6th century, the first ([[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Hiberno-Scottish]]) missionaries arrived. They were later replaced by [[Anglo-Saxon Christianity|Anglo-Saxon missionaries]], who eventually succeeded in converting most of the inhabitants by the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01505a.htm The Anglo-Saxon Church] – [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] article&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Christianity has been the dominant religion in the region.

In the early 16th century, the [[Protestant Reformation]] began to form and soon spread in the [[Westhoek (region)|Westhoek]] and the County of Flanders, where secret open-air sermons were held, called ''hagenpreken'' ("[[Hedge (barrier)|hedgerow]] [[oration]]s") in Dutch. The ruler of the Dutch regions, [[Philip II of Spain]], felt it was his duty to fight Protestantism and, after the wave of iconoclasm, sent troops to crush the rebellion and make the Low Countries a Catholic region once more.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;The Dutch Republic Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477–1806, {{ISBN|0-19-820734-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Protestants in the southern Low Countries fled North ''[[en masse]]''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Most of the Dutch Protestants were now concentrated in the free Dutch provinces north of the river [[Rhine]], while the Catholic Dutch were situated in the Spanish-occupied or -dominated South. After the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, Protestantism did not spread South, resulting in a difference in religious situations that lasts to this day.

{{legend|#008000|[[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]}}
{{legend|#FF0000|[[Protestantism]] ([[Calvinism|Calvinist]])}}]]
Contemporary Dutch are generally nominally Christians.&lt;ref&gt;A 2004 study conducted by Statistics Netherlands shows that 50% of the population claim to belong to a Christian denomination, 9% to other denominations and 42% to none. In the same study, 19% of the people claim go to church at least once a month, another 9% less than once a month, and 72% hardly ever or never. [http://www.cbs.nl/nr/rdonlyres/775b8373-86f8-4a17-8872-c4ecfbcb2766/0/2006a3pub.pdf Statistical Yearbook of the Netherlands 2006, page 43]&lt;/ref&gt; People of Dutch ancestry in the United States and South Africa are generally more religious than their European counterparts; for example, the numerous Dutch communities of [[western Michigan]] remain strongholds of the [[Reformed Church in America]] and the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America|Christian Reformed Church]], both descendants of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]].

===Cultural divergences===
One cultural division within Dutch culture is that between the Protestant North and the Catholic South, which encompasses various cultural differences between the Northern Dutch on one side and the Southern Dutch on the other. This subject has historically received attention from historians, notably [[Pieter Geyl]] (1887–1966) and Carel Gerretson (1884–1958). The historical pluriformity of the Dutch cultural landscape has given rise to several theories aimed at both identifying and explaining cultural divergences between different regions. One theory, proposed by A.J. Wichers in 1965, sees differences in mentality between the southeastern, or 'higher', and northwestern, or 'lower' regions within the Netherlands, and seeks to explain these by referring to the different degrees to which these areas were feudalised during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;A.M. van der Woude, ''Nederland over de schouder gekeken'' (Utrecht 1986), 11–12. {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another, more recent cultural divide is that between the ''Randstad'', the urban agglomeration in the West of the country, and the other provinces of the Netherlands.

In Dutch, the cultural division between North and South is also referred to by the [[colloquialism]] "''[[Grote rivieren|below/above the great rivers]]''" as the rivers [[Rhine]] and [[Meuse]] roughly form a natural boundary between the Northern Dutch (those Dutch living North of these rivers), and the Southern Dutch (those living South of them). The division is partially caused by (traditional) [[religion|religious]] differences, with the North predominantly Protestant and the South having a majority of Catholics. Linguistic (dialectal) differences (positioned along the [[Rhine river|Rhine]]/[[Meuse river]]s [sic].) and to a lesser extent, historical [[economic development]] of both regions are also important elements in any dissimilarity.

On a smaller scale cultural pluriformity can also be found; be it in local architecture or (perceived) character. This wide array of regional identities positioned within such a relatively small area, has often been attributed to the fact that many of the current Dutch provinces were de facto independent states for much of their history, as well as the importance of local Dutch dialects (which often largely correspond with the provinces themselves) to the people who speak them.&lt;ref&gt;Dutch Culture in a European Perspective; by D. Fokkema, 2004, Assen.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northern Dutch culture====
[[File:NorthernDutch.png|thumb|Northern Dutch cultural area.&lt;ref name="nl.wikipedia.org"&gt;This image is based on the rough definition given by in the 2005 " number 3" edition of the magazine "Neerlandia"  by the [[:nl:Algemeen Nederlands Verbond|ANV]]; it states the dividing line between both areas lies where "the great rivers divide the Brabantic from the Hollandic dialects and where Protestantism traditionally begins".&lt;/ref&gt;]]Northern Dutch culture is marked by [[Protestantism]]. Though today many do not adhere to Protestantism anymore, or are only nominally part of a congregation, Protestant-(influenced) values and custom are present. Generally, it can be said the Northern Dutch are more [[pragmatism|pragmatic]], favor a direct approach, and display a less-exuberant lifestyle when compared to Southerners.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Voor wie Nederland en Vlaanderen wil leren kennen''. By J. Wilmots&lt;/ref&gt; On a global scale, the Northern Dutch have formed the dominant vanguard of the Dutch language and culture since the [[Fall of Antwerp (1584–1585)|fall of Antwerp]], exemplified by the use of "Dutch" itself as the [[demonym]] for the country in which they form a majority; the [[Netherlands]]. Linguistically, Northerners speak any of the [[Hollandic]], [[Zealandic]], and [[Dutch Low Saxon]] dialects natively, or are influenced by them when they speak the Standard form of Dutch. Economically and culturally, the traditional centre of the region have been the provinces of [[North Holland|North]] and [[South Holland]], or today; the [[Randstad]], although for a brief period during the 13th or 14th century it lay more towards the east, when various eastern towns and cities aligned themselves with the emerging [[Hanseatic League]]. The entire Northern Dutch cultural area is located in the [[Netherlands]], its ethnically Dutch population is estimated to be just under 10,000,000.{{notetag|name=n2}} Northern Dutch culture has been less influenced by French influence than the Southern Dutch culture area.&lt;ref name="Fred M. Shelley 2013, page 97"&gt;Fred M. Shelley, Nation Shapes: The Story Behind the World's Borders, 2013, page 97&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Frisians=====
{{Main|Frisians|Friesland|West Frisian language}}
Frisians, specifically [[West Frisians]], are an ethnic group; present in the North of the Netherlands; mainly concentrating in the Province of [[Friesland]]. Culturally, modern Frisians and the (Northern) Dutch are rather similar; the main and generally most important difference being that Frisians speak West Frisian, one of the three sub-branches of the [[Frisian languages]], alongside Dutch.

West Frisians in general do not feel or see themselves as part of a larger group of Frisians, and, according to a 1970 inquiry, identify themselves more with the Dutch than with [[East Frisians|East]] or [[North Frisian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Frisia. 'Facts and fiction' (1970), by D. Tamminga. {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of centuries of cohabitation and active participation in Dutch society, as well as being bilingual, the Frisians are not treated as a separate group in Dutch official [[statistics]].

====Southern Dutch culture====
[[File:SouthernDutch.png|thumb|Southern Dutch cultural area.&lt;ref name="nl.wikipedia.org"/&gt;]]
The Southern Dutch sphere generally consists of the areas in which the population was traditionally Catholic. During the early [[Middle Ages]] up until the [[Dutch Revolt]], the Southern regions were more powerful, as well as more culturally and economically developed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; At the end of the Dutch Revolt, it became clear the [[Habsburg]]s were unable to reconquer the North, while the North's military was too weak to conquer the South, which, under the influence of the [[Counter-Reformation]], had started to develop a political and cultural identity of its own.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Geoffrey Parker, ''The Dutch Revolt'': "Gradually a consistent attitude emerged, a sort of 'collective identity' which was distinct and able to resist the inroads, intellectual as well as military, of both the Northern Dutch (especially during the crisis of 1632) and the French. This embryonic 'national identity' was an impressive monument to the government of the archdukes, and it survived almost forty years of grueling warfare (1621–59) and the invasions of Louis XIV until, in 1700, the Spanish Habsburgs died out." (Penguin edition 1985, p. 260). See also J. Israel, ''The Dutch Republic, 1477–1806'', 461–463 (Dutch language version).&lt;/ref&gt; The Southern Dutch, including Dutch Brabant and Limburg, remained Catholic or returned to Catholicism. The Dutch dialects spoken by this group are [[Brabantic]], [[South Guelderish]], [[Limburgish]] and [[East Flemish|East]] and [[West Flemish]]. In the Netherlands, an oft-used adage used for indicating this cultural boundary is the phrase ''boven/onder de rivieren'' (Dutch: above/below the rivers), in which 'the rivers' refer to the [[river Rhine]] and [[Meuse river|Meuse]]. Southern Dutch culture has been influenced more by French culture, opposed to the Northern Dutch culture area.&lt;ref name="Fred M. Shelley 2013, page 97"/&gt;

=====Flemings=====
{{Main|Flemish}}
Within the field of [[ethnography]], it is argued that the Dutch-speaking populations of the Netherlands and Belgium have a number of common characteristics, with a mostly shared [[language]], some generally similar or identical [[customs]], and with no clearly separate [[ancestry|ancestral origin]] or [[origin myth]].&lt;ref&gt;National minorities in Europe, W. Braumüller, 2003, page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the popular perception of being a single group varies greatly, depending on subject matter, locality, and personal background. Generally, the Flemish will seldom identify themselves as being Dutch and vice versa, especially on a national level.&lt;ref&gt;Nederlandse en Vlaamse identiteit, Civis Mundi 2006 by S.W Couwenberg. {{ISBN|90-5573-688-0}}. Page 62. Quote: "Er valt heel wat te lachen om de wederwaardigheden van Vlamingen in Nederland en Nederlanders in Vlaanderen. Ze relativeren de verschillen en beklemtonen ze tegelijkertijd. Die verschillen zijn er onmiskenbaar: in taal, klank, kleur, stijl, gedrag, in politiek, maatschappelijke organisatie, maar het zijn stuk voor stuk varianten binnen één taal-en cultuurgemeenschap." The opposite opinion is stated by L. Beheydt (2002): "Al bij al lijkt een grondiger analyse van de taalsituatie en de taalattitude in Nederland en Vlaanderen weinig aanwijzingen te bieden voor een gezamenlijke culturele identiteit. Dat er ook op andere gebieden weinig aanleiding is voor een gezamenlijke culturele identiteit is al door Geert Hofstede geconstateerd in zijn vermaarde boek ''Allemaal andersdenkenden'' (1991)." L. Beheydt, "Delen Vlaanderen en Nederland een culturele identiteit?", in P. Gillaerts, H. van Belle, L. Ravier (eds.),  ''Vlaamse identiteit: mythe én werkelijkheid'' (Leuven 2002), 22–40, esp. 38. {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is partly caused by the popular stereotypes in the Netherlands as well as Flanders, which are mostly based on the "cultural extremes" of both Northern and Southern culture, including in religious identity. Though these stereotypes tend to ignore the transitional area formed by the Southern provinces of the Netherlands and most Northern reaches of Belgium, resulting in overgeneralizations.&lt;ref&gt;Dutch Culture in a European Perspective: Accounting for the past, 1650–2000; by D. Fokkema, 2004, Assen.&lt;/ref&gt; This self-perceived split between Flemings and Dutch, despite the common language, may be compared to how [[Austrians]] do not consider themselves to be [[German people|Germans]], despite the similarities they share with southern Germans such as [[Bavarians]]. In both cases, the Catholic Austrians and Flemish do not see themselves as sharing the fundamentally Protestant-based identities of their northern counterparts.

In the case of Belgium, there is the added influence of [[nationalism]] as the Dutch language and culture [[Taalstrijd|were oppressed]] by the [[French language|francophone]] government. This was followed by a [[Flemish movement|nationalist backlash]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries that saw little help from the Dutch government (which for a long time following the [[Belgian Revolution]] had a reticent and contentious relationship with the newly formed Belgium and a largely indifferent attitude towards its Dutch-speaking inhabitants)&lt;ref&gt;Geschiedenis van de Nederlanden, by J.C.H Blom and E. Lamberts, {{ISBN|978-90-5574-475-6}}; page 383. {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, hence, focused on pitting "Flemish" culture against French culture, resulting in the forming of the Flemish [[nation]] within Belgium, a consciousness of which can be very marked among some Dutch-speaking Belgians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BNnm-Bog4awC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=Flemish+monolinguals#v=onepage&amp;q=Flemish%20monolinguals&amp;f=false |title=Languages in contact and conflict ... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 1 January 1995|accessdate=27 August 2010|isbn=9781853592782 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest genetic differences within the Netherlands are observed between the North and the South (with the three [[Grote rivieren|major rivers]] - Rijn, Waal, Maas - as a border), with the [[Randstad]] showing a mixture of these two ancestral backgrounds. The European North-South cline correlates highly with this Dutch North-South cline and shows several other similarities, such as a correlation with height (with the North being taller on average), blue/brown eye colour (with the North having more blue eyes), and genome-wide homozygosity (with the North having lower [[Homozygous|homozygosity]] levels). The correlation with genome-wide homozygosity likely reflects the [[serial founder effect]] that was initiated with the ancient successive out-of-Africa migrations. This does not necessarily mean that these events (north-ward migration and evolutionary selection pressures) took place within the borders of the Netherlands; it could also be that Southern Europeans have migrated more to the South of the Netherlands, and/or Northern Europeans more to the Northern parts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The North-South differences were likely maintained by the relatively strong [[Pillarisation|segregation]] of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] South and the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] North during the last centuries. During the last 50 years or so there was a large increase of [[Irreligion|non-religious]] individuals in the Netherlands. Their spouses are more likely to come from a different genetic background than those of religious individuals, causing non-religious individuals to show lower levels of genome-wide [[Homozygous|homozygosity]] than Catholics or Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abdellaoui|first1=Abdel|last2=Hottenga|first2=Jouke-Jan|last3=Xiangjun|first3=Xiao|last4=Scheet|first4=Paul|last5=Ehli|first5=Erik|last6=Davies|first6=Gareth|last7=Hudziak|first7=James|last8=Smit|first8=Dirk|last9=Bartels|first9=Meike|last10=Willemsen|first10=Gonneke|last11=Brooks|first11=Andrew|last12=Sullivan|first12=Patrick|last13=Smit|first13=Johannes|last14=de Geus|first14=Eco|last15=Penninx|first15=Brenda|last16=Boomsma|first16=Dorret|title=Association Between Autozygosity and Major Depression: Stratification Due to Religious Assortment|journal=Behavior Genetics|date=25 August 2013|volume=43|pages=455–467|doi=10.1007/s10519-013-9610-1|pmc=3827717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since World War II, Dutch [[Emigration|emigrants]] have mainly departed the Netherlands for Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, the United States, Belgium, Australia, and South Africa, in that order. Today, large Dutch communities also exist in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Turkey, and New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Nidi.knaw.nl" /&gt;

In the early-to-mid-16th century, [[Mennonites]] began to move from the [[Low Countries]] (especially [[Friesland]] and [[Flanders]]) to the [[Vistula]] delta region in [[Royal Prussia]], seeking religious freedom and exemption from military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pgsa.org/Inter/dutch_populace.php |title=Article on Dutch settlers in Poland published by the Polish Genealogical Society of America and written by Z.

The [[Russian Mennonite|Mennonites]] emigrated to [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. They were offered land along the [[Volga River]]. Some settlers left for [[Siberia]] in search for fertile land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercator-education.org/research-projects/endangered-languages/immigrants-from-the-netherlands-in-siberia Article published by the Mercator Research center on Dutch settlers in Siberia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193737/http://www.mercator-education.org/research-projects/endangered-languages/immigrants-from-the-netherlands-in-siberia |date=2 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian capital itself, [[Moscow]], also had a number of Dutch immigrants, mostly working as craftsmen. Arguably the most famous of which was [[Anna Mons]], the mistress of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]].

Historically Dutch also lived directly on the eastern side of the German border, most have since been assimilated (apart from ~40,000 recent border migrants), especially since the establishment of Germany itself in 1872. Cultural marks can still be found though. In some villages and towns a [[Dutch Reformed]] church is present, and a number of border districts (such as [[Kleve (district)|Cleves]], [[Borken (district)|Borken]] and [[Viersen (district)|Viersen]]) have towns and village with an etymologically Dutch origin. In the area around [[Cleves]] ([[German language|Ger]].''Kleve'', [[Dutch language|Du.]] ''Kleef'') [[South Guelderish|traditional dialect]] is Dutch, rather than surrounding [[High German|(High/]][[Low German|Low) German]]. More to the South, cities historically housing many Dutch traders have retained Dutch [[Exonym and endonym|exonyms]] for example [[Aachen]] (''Aken'') and Cologne/Köln (''Keulen'') to this day.

Although Portuguese explorers made contact with the [[Cape of Good Hope]] as early as 1488, much of present-day [[South Africa]] was ignored by Europeans until the [[Dutch East India Company]] established its first outpost at [[Cape Town]], in 1652.&lt;ref name="vaque1989"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Charles C. |editor1-last=Thomas McGhee |editor2-first=N/A |editor2-last=N/A |title=The plot against South Africa |year=1989|edition=2nd |publisher=Varama Publishers |location=Pretoria |isbn=0-620-14537-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="swapo"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fryxell|first=Cole|title=To Be Born a Nation|pages=9–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch settlers began arriving shortly thereafter, making the Cape home to the oldest Western-based civilisation south of the [[Sahara Desert|Sahara]].&lt;ref name="zastudy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Irving|title=Area Handbook for the Republic of South Africa|pages=42–591}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest mulatto communities in the country were subsequently formed through unions between colonists, their slaves, and various [[Khoikhoi]] tribes.&lt;ref name="zimstudy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Harold|title=Zimbabwe: A Country Study|pages=237–317}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the development of a major South African ethnic group, [[Cape Coloureds]], who adopted the Dutch language and culture.&lt;ref name="swapo"/&gt; As the number of Europeans—particularly women—in the Cape swelled, South African whites closed ranks as a community to protect their privileged status, eventually marginalising Coloureds as a separate and inferior racial group.&lt;ref name="roskinstudies"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roskin|first=Roskin|title=Countries and concepts: an introduction to comparative politics|pages=343–373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ''vrijburgers'' eventually turned to cattle ranching as [[trekboers]], creating their own distinct sub-culture centered around a semi-nomadic lifestyle and isolated patriarchal communities.&lt;ref name="zastudy"/&gt; By the eighteenth century there had emerged a new people in Africa who identified as "[[Afrikaner]]s", rather than Dutchmen, after the land they had permanently adopted.&lt;ref name="Dowden"&gt;{{cite book | author = Dowden, Richard | title = Africa: Altered States, Ordinary Miracles|year= 2010|pages= 380–415 | publisher = Portobello Books| isbn= 978-1-58648-753-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afrikaners are dominated by two main groups, the [[Cape Dutch]] and [[Boer]]s, which are partly defined by different traditions of society, law, and historical economic bases.&lt;ref name="zastudy"/&gt; Although their language ([[Afrikaans]]) and religion remain undeniably linked to that of the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dutchtoday.com/content/view/20/25/ |title=Is Afrikaans Dutch? |publisher=DutchToday.com |date= |accessdate=10 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624025204/http://www.dutchtoday.com/content/view/20/25/ |archivedate=24 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afrikaner culture has been strongly shaped by three centuries in South Africa.&lt;ref name="Dowden"/&gt; Afrikaans, which developed from [[Middle Dutch]], has been influenced by English, [[Portuguese-based creole languages#Southeast Asia|Malay-Portuguese creole]], and various African tongues. Dutch was taught to South African students as late as 1914 and a few upper-class Afrikaners used it in polite society, but the first Afrikaans literature had already appeared in 1861.&lt;ref name="zastudy"/&gt; The [[Union of South Africa]] granted Dutch official status upon its inception, but in 1925 Parliament openly recognised Afrikaans as a separate language.&lt;ref name="zastudy"/&gt; It differs from Standard Dutch by several pronunciations borrowed from Malay, German, or English, the loss of case and gender distinctions, and in the extreme simplification of grammar (e.g. ''voël'' becomes ''vogel'', and ''reën'' becomes ''regen'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/8437/Afrikaans-language |title=Afrikaans language – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dialects are no longer considered quite mutually intelligible.&lt;ref name="kwintessential.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/language/about/afrikaans.html |title=The Afrikaans Language &amp;#124; about &amp;#124; language |publisher=Kwintessential.co.uk |date= |accessdate=10 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120907035914/http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/language/about/afrikaans.html |archivedate=7 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s, Dutch immigration to South Africa began to increase exponentially for the first time in over a hundred years. The country registered a net gain of around 45,000 Dutch immigrants between 1950 and 2001, making it the sixth most popular destination for citizens of the Netherlands living abroad.&lt;ref name="Nidi.knaw.nl" /&gt;

===Southeast Asia===

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Rijsttafel TMnr 60053682.jpg|thumb|Dutch family in [[Java]], 1927]]
Since the 16th century, there has been a Dutch presence in [[South East Asia]], Taiwan and [[Japan]]. In many cases the Dutch were the first Europeans the natives would encounter. Between 1602 and 1796, the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] sent almost a million Europeans to work in the Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/files/22635/11546101681netherlands_voc_archives.doc/netherlands+voc+archives.doc |title=Data |website=portal.unesco.org |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081217030156/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/files/22635/11546101681netherlands_voc_archives.doc/netherlands+voc+archives.doc |archivedate=17 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority died of disease or made their way back to Europe, but some of them made the Indies their new home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchmalaysia.net/press/Easternization.html |title=Easternization of the West: Children of the VOC |publisher=Dutchmalaysia.net |date= |accessdate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interaction between the Dutch and native population mainly took place in  [[Dutch period in Ceylon|Sri Lanka]] and the [[Islands of Indonesia|modern Indonesian Islands]]. Most of the time Dutch soldiers intermarried with local women and settled down in the colonies. Through the centuries there developed a relatively large Dutch-speaking population of mixed Dutch and Indonesian descent, known as [[Indo people|Indos]] or Dutch-Indonesians. The expulsion of Dutchmen following the [[Indonesian National Revolution|Indonesian Revolt]], means that currently the majority of this group lives in the Netherlands. Statistics show that Indos are in fact the largest minority group in the Netherlands and number close to half a million (excluding the third generation).&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} Willems, Wim, ’De uittocht uit Indie 1945–1995’ (Uitgeverij Bert Bakker, Amsterdam, 2001) {{ISBN|90-351-2361-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia and New Zealand===
{{main|New Zealand European|Dutch Australian|Dutch New Zealander}}
Though the Dutch were the first [[Europe]]ans to visit Australia and New Zealand, colonization did not take place and it was only after [[World War II]] that a sharp increase in Dutch emigration to Australia occurred. Poor economic prospects for many Dutchmen as well as increasing demographic pressures, in the post-war Netherlands were a powerful incentive to emigrate. Due to Australia experiencing a shortage of [[agriculture|agricultural]] and [[metal industry]] workers it, and to a lesser extent New Zealand, seemed an attractive possibility, with the Dutch government actively promoting emigration.&lt;ref name="nederland-australie2006.nl"&gt;[http://www.nederland-australie2006.nl/geschiedenis/au/html/landverhuizers_index.html Nederland-Australie 1606–2006 on Dutch emigration]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628051331/http://www.nederland-australie2006.nl/geschiedenis/au/html/landverhuizers_index.html |date=28 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of Dutch migration to Australia can still be felt. There are many Dutch associations and a Dutch-language newspaper continues to be published. The Dutch have remained a tightly knit community, especially in the large cities. In total, about 310,000 people of Dutch ancestry live in Australia whereas New Zealand has some 100,000 Dutch descendants.&lt;ref name="nederland-australie2006.nl"/&gt;

===North America===
{{Main|Dutch Americans|Dutch Canadians}}

The Dutch had settled in America long before the establishment of the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. declared its independence in 1776; the first Dutch settlement was built in 1614: Fort Nassau, where presently Albany, New York is positioned.&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time the Dutch lived in Dutch colonies, owned and regulated by the Dutch Republic, which later became part of the [[Thirteen Colonies]].

Nevertheless, many Dutch communities remained virtually isolated towards the rest of America up until the [[American Civil War]], in which the Dutch fought for the North and adopted many American ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C005615/data/english_text/vanraalte8.html |title=How the Dutch became Americans, American Civil War.

Most future waves of Dutch immigrants were quickly assimilated. There have been five American presidents of Dutch descent: [[Martin Van Buren]] (8th, first president who was not of British descent, first language was Dutch), [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (32nd, elected to four terms in office, he served from 1933 to 1945, the only U.S. president to have served more than two terms),[[Theodore Roosevelt]] (26th), as well as [[George H. W. Bush]] (41st) and [[George W. Bush]] (43rd), the latter two descendant from the [[Schuyler family]].

The first Dutch people to come to Canada were [[Dutch Americans]] among the [[United Empire Loyalist]]s. The largest wave was in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when large numbers of Dutch helped settle the Canadian west. During this period significant numbers also settled in major cities like [[Toronto]].

While interrupted by World War I, this migration returned in the 1920s, but again halted during the [[Great Depression]] and World War II. After the war a large number of Dutch immigrants moved to Canada, including a number of [[war bride]]s of the Canadian soldiers who liberated the Low Countries.

==Notes==
{{notefoot|refs=
{{notetag|name=n1|In the 1950s (the peak of traditional emigration) about 350,000 people left the Netherlands, mainly to [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[Argentina]] and [[South Africa]]. About one-fifth returned. The maximum Dutch-born emigrant stock for the 1950s is about 300,000 (some have died since). The maximum emigrant stock (Dutch-born) for the period after 1960 is 1.6 million. Discounting pre-1950 emigrants (who would be about 85 or older), at most around 2 million people born in the Netherlands are now living outside the country. Combined with the 13.1 million ethnically Dutch inhabitants of the Netherlands, there are about 16 million people who are Dutch (of Dutch ancestry), in a minimally accepted sense.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3373">'''Elisha Beadles''' (1670–1734) was a member of the [[Quaker]] movement and a translator.

==Early life==
Beadles was born in 1670. His parents were Elizabeth (née Jenkins) and John Beadles. His mother was the daughter of Quaker Walter Jenkins who had inherited the [[The Pant, Llanvihangel-Ystern-Llewern|Pant estate]] in [[Llanvihangel-Ystern-Llewern]], Monmouthshire and was jailed in Cardiff in 1660 or 1661 for refusing to swear and had died and was buried in 1662. Beadle's mother, Jenkin's only child, inherited Pant. Beadle's father was a Quaker from [[Kempston]], [[Bedfordshire]], England.&lt;ref name="DWB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Elisha Beadles|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-BEAD-ELI-1670.html|author=Thomas Mardy Rees|year=1959|website=Dictionary of Welsh Biography|publisher=National Library of Wales|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wedmore" /&gt;

==Career==
He moved to [[Pontymoile]], where he worked as a [[mercer (occupation)|mercer]] and [[apothecary]].&lt;ref name="Wedmore" /&gt; Beadles was described as "extremely prosperous", having £691 in inventory, when most apothecaries had inventories valued up to £10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alun Withey|title=Physick and the family: Health, medicine and care in Wales, 1600-1750|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FsvDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA111|date=January 18, 2013|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-9498-9|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became involved in the establishment of Quakerism in the area at the turn of the century and attended the first recorded monthly meeting in the area in 1703.&lt;ref name="Wedmore"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edmund Tolson Wedmore|title=Thomas Pole|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bg0MAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA36|year=1907|publisher=Headley Brothers|pages=34, 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote and translated works about the Quaker movement, including documenting for the [[Meeting for Sufferings]] in London the manner in which the movement was developing in South Wales in 1720. He created the 1715 translation ''Y Gyfraith a roddwyd allan o Zion, a Gorchmynion Arglwydd y Bywyd (yr hwn ydyw yr Arglwydd or Nef) gwedi i hysbysu i dynion'' of his Grandfather Jenkins' English devotional book, ''The law given forth out of Zion''.&lt;ref name="DWB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wedmore" /&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1699, he married Anne Handley.&lt;ref name="DWB" /&gt; Thought to be connected with other emigrating Welsh Quakers, several of Beadles' children sailed to America in the 1720s and 1730s. Handley was in Philadelphia and died during a voyage to the British Isles, drowning off the Irish coast in December 1728. Richard died in Jamaica in June 1729. Their brother, Elisha, settled in New York and worked as a baker to the government of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://digitalcommons.georgefox.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1044&amp;context=quakerstudies|title=In Search of a new Jerusalem: A Preliminary Investigation into the Causes and Impact of Welsh Quaker Emigration to Pennsylvania, c.1660 - 1750 |journal=Quaker Studies|volume=9|number=1|author=Richard Allen|pages=44–45|accessdate=9 August 2017|via= Digital Commons, George Fox University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Hütter, Eckhard Thiel and others from the [[Charité|Charité Hospital]] in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], published a report on the case in the ''New England Journal of Medicine''.&lt;ref name="Hütter G, Nowak D, Mossner M, Ganepola S, Ganepola A, Allers K, Schneider T, Hofmann J, Kücherer C, Blau O, Blau IW, Hofmann WK, Thiel E 2009 692-698"/&gt; Their patient Timothy Ray Brown, a [[United States of America|US citizen]] born in Seattle, Washington, and living in Berlin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/technologie/medizin/unerwarteter-erfolg-bei-hiv-therapie;2086830 |title=Unerwarteter Erfolg bei HIV-Therapie |publisher=Berliner Handelsblatt/ECONOMY.ONE GmbH |date=2008-11-12 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; had both [[acute myelogenous leukemia]] (AML) and HIV. The physicians found a bone marrow donor with a [[CCR5#CCR5-Δ32|CCR5-Δ32]] mutation in [[Zygosity#Homozygous, heterozygous, hemizygous, and nullizygous|both genomic copies]] of a gene encoding a cell-surface [[chemokine receptor]] called [[CCR5]]. Because "most of HIV strains" use the CCR5 receptor to enter a host cell, the mutation confers resistance to HIV infection.&lt;ref name="Wall Street Journal 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hütter G, Nowak D, Mossner M, Ganepola S, Ganepola A, Allers K, Schneider T, Hofmann J, Kücherer C, Blau O, Blau IW, Hofmann WK, Thiel E 2009 692-698"/&gt; The patient himself was heterozygous for CCR5-Δ32. Following the transplant procedure, the patient's [[T helper cell|CD4+ T-cells]] circulating in the blood were homozygous for CCR5-Δ32. The [[macrophage]]s in his bowel, which continued to express wildtype CCR5 (because they hadn't been replaced yet from bone marrow precursors), also had no detectable virus. After 600 days without antiretroviral drug treatment, the patient's blood, bone marrow and bowel HIV levels were below the limit of detection; the virus was thought to be present in other tissues.  However, the patient actually had a brain biopsy, in addition to biopsies of his intestines, liver, lymph nodes, bone marrow—basically, every part of the body that can be biopsied. All were negative for virus. There is no virus in this person's body out to two and a half years off of all anti-HIV drugs.  His antibody levels—called titers—are declining just the way expected if the patient was vaccinated against HIV and then the levels of antibodies were examined. They'd be very strong in the beginning, but would weaken if they are not re-exposed to the virus.  It is believed this patient has no HIV in his body and therefore there is nothing to re-expose him, so the concentration of HIV antibodies in his blood is decreasing. It is predicted that, in a couple of years, his HIV antibody test will be negative.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebody.com/content/art53624.html?getPage=3&lt;/ref&gt;

The mortality risk associated with bone marrow transplants is thought to contraindicate the use of this experimental treatment for HIV-positive individuals without leukemia or lymphoma.&lt;ref name="Wall Street Journal 2008"/&gt; Some researchers such as Edward Berger believe that resistance to CCR5 inhibition may emerge if [[CXCR4]] strains of HIV emerge (these use CXCR4 rather than CCR5 as a coreceptor, from which they become independent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=HIV 'cure' won't save sick millions |publisher=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16032-hiv-cure-wont-save-sick-millions.html |date=2008-11-14 |accessdate=2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the treatment though the patient had low levels of the CXCR4 virus but after the treatment this type of HIV could not be detected either which Hütter called "very surprising".&lt;ref name="CNN20090211"&gt;{{cite news |title=Man appears free of HIV after stem cell transplant |publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/02/11/health.hiv.stemcell/index.html?eref=rss_latest |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; People without CCR5 can be more sensitive to some infections such as [[West Nile virus]].&lt;ref name="pmid16418398"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Glass WG, McDermott DH, Lim JK, etal |title=CCR5 deficiency increases risk of symptomatic West Nile virus infection |journal=J. Exp. Med. |volume=203 |issue=1 |pages=35–40 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16418398 |pmc=2118086 |doi=10.1084/jem.20051970 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jay Levy]], one of the first researchers to isolate and describe HIV in the early 1980s, wrote an editorial accompanying Hütter's publication in the ''New England Journal of Medicine''.&lt;ref name=NEJMLevy&gt;{{cite journal |author=Levy JA |title=Not an HIV Cure, but Encouraging New Directions |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=360 |issue=7 |pages=724–725 |year=2009 |pmid= 19213687|doi= 10.1056/NEJMe0810248|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/360/7/724}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting the reduction in detectable HIV in the patient's blood and the return of the patient's circulating CD4+ T-cell population to normal levels, with all of the cells expressing the resistant variant of CCR5, Levy cautions that calling this treatment a cure would be premature.&lt;ref name=NEJMLevy/&gt; This is because HIV is known to hide in latent form in a variety of organs not easily sampled, including the heart and brain. The high risks of a bone marrow transplant also make this treatment risky since many bone marrow patients die.&lt;ref name=NEJMLevy/&gt; And the CXCR4 virus that was detectable in the blood of the patient before the treatment "could eventually emerge".&lt;ref name=NEJMLevy/&gt; Levy does believe though that this case "could pave the way for innovative approaches that provide long-lasting viral control with limited toxicities for persons with HIV infection".&lt;ref name=NEJMLevy/&gt;

As of June 4, 2010, Dr. Hütter's patient was in very good health and had been HIV- and cancer-free (combined) for two years.&lt;ref name=NEJMLevy/&gt; In the March 10, 2011, issue of the medical journal ''[[Blood (journal)|Blood]]'', Hütter wrote, "it is reasonable to conclude that cure of HIV infection has been achieved in this patient."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allers|first=Kristina|title=Evidence for the cure of HIV infection by CCR5Δ32/Δ32 stem cell transplantation|journal=Blood|date=March 10, 2011|volume=117|issue=10|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Hütter concurred with this assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hütter G, Ganepola S | title=Eradication of HIV by transplantation of CCR5-deficient hematopoietic stem cells | journal= [[The Scientific World Journal]] | volume=11 | year=2011 | pages=1068–1076 | doi= 10.1100/tsw.2011.102 | url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2011/750420/abs/ | id= | pmid=21552772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Hütter received an award on June 3, 2010, from the AIDS Policy Project, a national advocacy group focused on an AIDS cure, and San Francisco Supervisor [[Ross Mirkarimi]] on behalf of the people of San Francisco.&lt;ref name=AwardNews0610&gt;http://www.positivelypositive.ca/hiv-aids-news/GERMAN_DOCTOR_HONORED_FOR_FIRST_FUNCTIONAL_CURE_FOR_HIVAIDS.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The text read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Dr. Gero Hütter: In recognition of your historic achievement of being the first doctor to functionally cure AIDS/HIV through an innovative procedure that entails a remarkable example of the use of stem cell transplants. We join you with hope that your achievement will globally inspire researchers to explore new techniques and technologies for an AIDS cure. On behalf of the people of San Francisco, the AIDS Policy Project, and all those engaged in the combat against the HIV disease, the City and County of San Francisco extends its highest commendation!" &amp;mdash;Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi, Member, San Francisco Board of Supervisors, June 3, 2010&lt;ref name=AwardNews0610/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Helene''' "'''Lenchen'''" '''Demuth''' (31 December 1820 - 4 November 1890) was the [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]] of [[Jenny Marx|Jenny]] and [[Karl Marx]], later serving as the household manager and political confidante of [[Friedrich Engels]].

==Biography==

Helene Demuth was born of peasant parents on December 31, 1820 in [[Sankt Wendel]] in today's [[Saarland]]. As a teenage girl she was adopted into the [[Jenny von Westphalen|von Westphalen]] household, to work as a maid. In 1843 Karl Marx married [[Jenny von Westphalen]]. Helene Demuth joined their household in April 1845 in Brussels, where she was sent by Jenny's mother.&lt;ref name=Draper55a&gt;Hal Draper, "Helene Demuth," in ''The Marx-Engels Glossary: Volume III of the Marx-Engels Cyclopedia.'' New York: Schocken Books, 1986; pg. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; She stayed with the Marxes as a lifelong housekeeper, friend, and political confidante, and was commonly known to the family by the nicknames Lenchen or Nim.&lt;ref name=Draper55a /&gt;

After Marx's death in March 1883, Helene Demuth moved to Engels's home, where she ran the household.&lt;ref name=Draper55a /&gt; The pair worked in tandem to organize and arrange for the publication of Marx's literary estate, discovering in the process the manuscript from which Engels was able to reconstruct the [[Capital, Volume II|second volume]] of [[Das Kapital]].

In October 1890, Helene was diagnosed with cancer. She died in London on November 4 that year at the age of 69. In accordance with Jenny Marx's wishes, she was buried in the Marx family grave and later re-interred in the [[Tomb of Karl Marx]] at [[Highgate Cemetery]].

On June 23, 1851 Helene Demuth gave birth to a boy believed by most scholars to have been sired by Karl Marx.&lt;ref name=PadoverXXV&gt;Saul Padover (trans. and ed.), "Introduction: Marx, the Human Side," to Karl Marx, ''On Education, Women, and Children.'' New York: McGraw Hill Book Co., 1975; pg. xxv.&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably in an effort to preserve the Marxes' marriage, Karl Marx's closest personal friend, Frederick Engels, a bachelor living in [[Manchester]], claimed fatherhood of the boy, who was given his name.&lt;ref name=PadoverXXV /&gt; The baby, [[Frederick Demuth|Frederick Lewis Demuth]] (1851−1929), was placed in a [[working class]] foster home in London shortly after birth and was later trained as a toolmaker.&lt;ref name=Draper55b&gt;Draper, "Frederick Demuth," in ''The Marx-Engels Glossary,'' pg. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; His probable half-sister [[Eleanor Marx]] came to know him some time after her father's death and made him a family friend.&lt;ref name=Draper55b /&gt;

'''Hermes Trismegistus''' ({{lang-grc|[[Wiktionary:Ἑρμῆς|Ἑρμῆς]] ὁ Τρισμέγιστος}}, "thrice-greatest Hermes"; {{lang-la|Mercurius ter Maximus}}) is the purported author of the [[Hermetica|''Hermetic Corpus'']], a series of sacred texts that are the basis of [[Hermeticism]].

==Origin and identity==

Hermes Trismegistus may be associated with the [[Ancient Greek religion|Greek]] god [[Hermes]] and the [[Ancient Egyptian deities|Egyptian god]] [[Thoth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Budge|first=E.A. Wallis|title=The Gods of the Egyptians Vol. 1|year=1904|url=https://archive.org/stream/godsofegyptianso00budg#page/414/mode/2up|pages=414–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greeks in the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] of Egypt recognized the equivalence of Hermes and Thoth through the [[interpretatio graeca]].&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;Hart, G., ''The Routledge Dictionary of Egyptian Gods and Goddesses'', 2005, Routledge, second edition, Oxon, p 158&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the two gods were worshiped as one, in what had been the Temple of Thoth in Khemenu, which was known in the [[Hellenistic period]] as [[Hermopolis]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Donald, "Classical Architecture" in Riggs, Christina (ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Roman Egypt'' (Oxford University Press, 2012), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hermes, the Greek god of interpretive communication, was combined with Thoth, the Egyptian god of wisdom, to become the patron of [[astrology]] and [[alchemy]]. In addition, both gods were [[psychopomp]]s, guiding souls to the afterlife.{{cn|date=April 2018}} The Egyptian priest and [[polymath]] [[Imhotep]] had been deified long after his death and therefore assimilated to Thoth in the [[Classical Greece|classical]] and Hellenistic periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Artmann |first=Benno |title=About the Cover: The Mathematical Conquest of the Third Dimension |url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2006-43-02/S0273-0979-06-01111-6/S0273-0979-06-01111-6.pdf |date=22 November 2005 |page=231 |volume=43 |number=2 |journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|Bulletin (New Series) of the American Mathematical Society]] |access-date=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renowned scribe [[Amenhotep, son of Hapu|Amenhotep]] and a wise man named Teôs were coequal deities of wisdom, science, and medicine; and, thus, they were placed alongside Imhotep in shrines dedicated to Thoth–Hermes during the Ptolemaic Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;''Thoth or the Hermes of Egypt: A Study of Some Aspects of Theological Thought in Ancient Egypt'', p.166–168, Patrick Boylan, Oxford University Press, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Mycenaean Greek]] reference to a deity or semi-deity called ''ti-ri-se-ro-e'' (Linear B: {{lang|gmy|𐀴𐀪𐀮𐀫𐀁}}; ''Tris Hḗrōs'', "thrice ''or'' triple hero")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dismanibus156.wordpress.com/2008/05/14/heroes-and-hero-cults-i/hero |title=Heroes and HERO cults I &amp;#124; V(otum) S(olvit) L(ibens) M(erito) |publisher=Dismanibus156.wordpress.com |date=2008-05-14 |accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; was found on two [[Linear B]] clay tablets at [[Pylos]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://projectsx.dartmouth.edu/history/bronze_age/lessons/les/26.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915150918/http://projectsx.dartmouth.edu/history/bronze_age/lessons/les/26.html|date=September 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and could be connected to the later epithet "thrice great", ''Trismegistos'', applied to Hermes/Thoth. On the aforementioned PY Tn 316 tablet—as well as other Linear B tablets found in Pylos, [[Knossos]], and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]]—there appears the name of the deity "Hermes" as ''e-ma-ha'' (Linear B: {{lang|gmy|𐀁𐀔𐁀}}), but not in any apparent connection with the "Trisheros". This interpretation of poorly understood Mycenaean material is disputed, since Hermes Trismegistus is not referenced in any of the copious sources before he emerges in Hellenistic Egypt.

[[Cicero]] enumerates several deities referred to as "Hermes": a "fourth [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] (Hermes) was the son of the Nile, whose name may not be spoken by the Egyptians"; and "the fifth, who is worshiped by the people of Pheneus [in [[Arcadia]]], is said to have killed [[Argus Panoptes]], and for this reason to have fled to Egypt, and to have given the Egyptians their laws and alphabet: he it is whom the Egyptians call [[Thoth|Theyt]]".&lt;ref&gt;''De natura deorum'' III, Ch. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The most likely interpretation of this passage is as two variants on the same [[syncretism]] of Greek Hermes and Egyptian Thoth (or sometimes other gods): the fourth (where Hermes turns out "actually" to have been a "son of the Nile," i.e. a native god) being viewed from the Egyptian perspective, the fifth (who went from Greece to Egypt) being viewed from the Greek-Arcadian perspective. Both of these early references in Cicero (most ancient Trismegistus material is from the early centuries AD) corroborate the view that Thrice-Great Hermes originated in Hellenistic Egypt through syncretism between Greek and Egyptian gods (the ''Hermetica'' refer most often to Thoth and Amun).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/nd3.shtml#56 |title=Cicero: De Natura Deorum III |publisher=Thelatinlibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hermes mercurius trismegistus siena cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Hermes Trismegistus, floor mosaic in the [[Cathedral of Siena]]]]

The Hermetic literature among the Egyptians, which was concerned with conjuring spirits and animating statues, inform the oldest Hellenistic writings on Greco-[[Babylon]]ian astrology and on the newly developed practice of alchemy.&lt;ref&gt;Fowden 1993: pp65–68&lt;/ref&gt; In a parallel tradition, [[Hermetic philosophy]] rationalized and systematized religious [[cult|cult practices]] and offered the adept a means of personal [[ascension of Jesus Christ|ascension]] from the constraints of physical being. This latter tradition has led to the confusion of Hermeticism with [[Gnosticism]], which was developing contemporaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/Merkur.html |title=Stages of Ascension in Hermetic Rebirth |publisher=Esoteric.msu.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a divine source of wisdom, Hermes Trismegistus was credited with tens of thousands of highly esteemed writings, which were reputed to be of immense antiquity. [[Plato]]'s ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]'' state that in the temple of [[Neith]] at [[Sais]] there were secret halls containing historical records which had been kept for 9,000 years. [[Clement of Alexandria]] was under the impression that the Egyptians had forty-two sacred writings by Hermes, writings that detailed the training of Egyptian priests. Siegfried Morenz has suggested, in ''Egyptian Religion'': "The reference to Thoth's authorship... is based on ancient tradition; the figure forty-two probably stems from the number of Egyptian [[Nome (Egypt)|nomes]], and thus conveys the notion of completeness." The [[neoplatonism|neoplatonic]] writers took up Clement's "forty-two essential texts".

The ''[[Hermetica]]'' is a category of [[papyrus|papyri]] containing spells and initiatory induction procedures. The dialogue called the ''[[Asclepius]]'' (after the Greek god of healing) describes the art of imprisoning the souls of demons or of angels in statues with the help of herbs, gems, and odors, so that the statue could speak and engage in prophecy. In other papyri, there are recipes for constructing such images and animating them, such as when images are to be fashioned hollow so as to enclose a [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] name inscribed on gold leaf.

==Thrice Great==
Fowden asserts that the first datable occurrences of the epithet "thrice great" are in the ''Legatio'' of [[Athenagoras of Athens]] and in a fragment from [[Philo of Byblos]], circa AD 64–141.&lt;ref&gt;Fowden, G., "The Egyptian Hermes", Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1987, p 216&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a later work, Copenhaver reports that this epithet is first found in the minutes of a meeting of the council of the [[Ibis]] [[cult]], held in 172 BC near [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Copenhaver, B. P., "Hermetica", Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1992, p xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; Hart explains that the epithet is derived from an epithet of Thoth found at the Temple of [[Esna]], "Thoth the great, the great, the great."&lt;ref name="Hart" /&gt; The date of Hermes Trismegistus's sojourn in Egypt during his last incarnation is not now known, but it has been fixed at the early days of the oldest dynasties of Egypt, long before the days of [[Moses]]. Some authorities regard him as a contemporary of [[Abraham]], and claim that Abraham acquired a portion of his mystical knowledge from Hermes himself (''[[Kybalion]]'').

Many Christian writers, including [[Lactantius]], [[Augustine]], [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Marsilio Ficino]], [[Tommaso Campanella|Campanella]], and [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]], considered Hermes Trismegistus to be a wise [[pagan]] prophet who foresaw the coming of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heiser|first1=James D.|title=Prisci Theologi and the Hermetic Reformation in the Fifteenth Century|date=2011|publisher=Repristination Press|location=Malone, Tex.|isbn=978-1-4610-9382-4|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Enoch in the Islamic Tradition|last = Jafar|first = Imad|date = 2015|journal = Sacred Web: A Journal of Tradition and Modernity|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume =  XXXVI|page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They believed in a [[prisca theologia]], the doctrine that a single, true theology exists, which threads through all religions. It was given by God to man in antiquity&lt;ref&gt;Yates, F., "Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition", Routledge, London, 1964, pp 14–18 and pp 433–434&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanegraaff, W. J., "New Age Religion and Western Culture", SUNY, 1998, p 360&lt;/ref&gt; and passed through a series of prophets, which included [[Zoroaster]] and [[Plato]]. In order to demonstrate the verity of the ''prisca theologia,'' Christians appropriated the Hermetic teachings for their own purposes. By this account, Hermes Trismegistus was either a contemporary of Moses,&lt;ref&gt;Yates, F., "Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition", Routledge, London, 1964, p 27 and p 293&lt;/ref&gt; or the third in a line of men named Hermes, i.e. Enoch, Noah, and the Egyptian priest king who is known to us as Hermes Trismegistus&lt;ref name="Yates"&gt;Yates, F., "Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition", Routledge, London, 1964, p52&lt;/ref&gt; on account of being the greatest priest, philosopher, and king.&lt;ref name="Yates" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copenhaver, B.P., "Hermetica", Cambridge University Press, 1992, p xlviii&lt;/ref&gt;

This last account of how Hermes Trismegistus received that epithet is derived from statements in the ''[[Emerald Tablet|Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus]]'', that he knows the three parts of the wisdom of the whole universe,&lt;ref&gt;(Scully p. 322)&lt;/ref&gt; the three parts being [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], and [[theurgy]]. It was Marsilio Ficino who stated that "they called him Trismegistus because he was the greatest philosopher and the greatest priest and the greatest king".&lt;ref&gt;Copenhaver, Hermetica, p. xlviii&lt;/ref&gt;

Another explanation, in the ''[[Suda]]'' (10th century), is that "He was called Trismegistus on account of his praise of the trinity, saying there is one divine nature in the trinity."&lt;ref&gt;Copenhaver, ''Hermetica'', p. xli&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hermetic writings==
The ''Asclepius'' and the ''Corpus Hermeticum'' are the most important of the ''[[Hermetica]]'', the surviving writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus. During the [[Renaissance]], it was accepted that Hermes Trismegistus was a contemporary of [[Moses]]. However, after [[Isaac Casaubon|Casaubon's]] dating of the Hermetic writings as being no earlier than the second or third century AD, the whole of Renaissance Hermeticism collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;Haanegraaff, W. J., New Age Religion and Western Culture, Brill, Leiden, New York, 1996, p 390&lt;/ref&gt; As to their actual authorship:

{{quote|... they were certainly not written in remotest antiquity by an all wise Egyptian priest, as the Renaissance believed, but by various unknown authors, all probably Greeks, and they contain popular Greek philosophy of the period, a mixture of [[Platonism]] and [[Stoicism]], combined with some Jewish and probably some Persian influences.&lt;ref&gt;(Yates ''Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition'' pp. 2–3)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Hermetic revival==
{{about||the main article|Hermeticism|the texts of the Corpus Hermeticum|Hermetica}}

During the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]] the ''[[Hermetica]]'' enjoyed great prestige and were popular among alchemists. The "hermetic tradition" consequently refers to alchemy, magic, astrology, and related subjects. The texts are usually divided into two categories: the philosophical and the technical hermetica. The former deals mainly with [[philosophy]], and the latter with practical magic, potions, and alchemy. Magic spells to protect objects, for example, are the origin of the expression "[[hermetically sealed]]".{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The classical scholar [[Isaac Casaubon]], in ''De rebus sacris et ecclesiasticis exercitationes XVI'' (1614), showed, through an analysis of the Greek language used in the texts, that those texts believed to be of ancient origin were in fact much more recent: most of the philosophical ''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]'' can be dated to around AD 300.  However, the 17th century scholar [[Ralph Cudworth]] argued that Casaubon's allegation of forgery could only be applied to three of the seventeen treatises contained within the ''Corpus Hermeticum''.&lt;ref&gt;Cudworth, Ralph - The True Intellectual System of the Universe. First American Edition by Thomas Birch, 1837. Available at Googlebooks.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bodl Arab.d.221 roll332 frame11.jpg|thumbnail|right|Pages from a 14th-century Arabic manuscript of the [[Cyranides]], a text attributed to Hermes Trismegistus]]

[[Sayyid Ahmed Amiruddin]] has pointed out that Hermes Trismegistus is the builder of the [[Pyramids of Giza]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sayyidamiruddin.com/2013/01/02/the-tombs-of-prophets-seth-and-idris-the-great-pyramids-of-giza/|title=The Tombs of Prophets Seth and Idris: The Great Pyramids of Giza|date=2013-01-02|work=Sayyid Amiruddin|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a major place in [[Islam]]ic tradition. He writes, "Hermes Trismegistus is mentioned in the [[Quran]] in verse [[Maryam (surah)|19]]:56-57: {{'}}''Mention, in the Book, Idris, that he was truthful, a prophet. We took him up to a high place''{{' "}}. The Jabirian corpus contains the oldest documented source for the [[Emerald Tablet]] of Hermes Trismegistus, translated by [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (Geber) for the [[Hashemite]] [[Caliph]] of [[Baghdad]] [[Harun al-Rashid]] the [[Abbasid]]. [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]], a [[Shiite]], identified as Jābir al-[[Sufi]], was a student of [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], [[Husayn ibn 'Ali]]'s great grandson. Thus, for the [[Abbasid]]'s and the [[Alid]]'s, the writings of Hermes Trismegistus were considered sacred, as an inheritance from the [[Ahl al-Bayt]] and the [[Prophets]]. These writings were recorded by the [[Ikhwan al-Safa]], and subsequently translated from [[Arabic]] into [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Hebrew]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[English language|English]]. In these writings, Hermes Trismegistus is identified as [[Idris (prophet)|Idris,]] the infallible Prophet who traveled to outer space from [[Egypt]], and to heaven, whence he brought back a cache of objects from the Eden of [[Adam]] and the [[Black Stone]] from where he landed on earth in [[India]].&lt;ref name="Quran p.46"&gt;Prophets in the Quran: An Introduction to the Quran and Muslim Exegesis, p.46. Wheeler, Brannon. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ancient Arab genealogists, the [[Prophet Muhammad]], who is also believed to have traveled to the heavens on the night of [[Isra and Mi'raj]], is a direct descendant of Hermes Trismegistus. [[Ibn Kathir]] said, "As for Idris... He is in the genealogical chain of the Prophet Muhammad, except according to one genealogist... Ibn Ishaq says he was the first who wrote with the Pen. There was a span of 380 years between him and the life of Adam. Many of the scholars allege that he was the first to speak about this, and they call him Thrice-Great Hermes [Hermes Trismegistus]".&lt;ref name="Quran p.46" /&gt; [[Ahmad al-Buni]] considered himself a follower of the hermetic teachings; and his contemporary [[Ibn Arabi]] mentioned Hermes Trismegistus in his writings. The Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya of [[Ibn Arabi]] speaks of Hermes's travels to "vast cities (outside earth), possessing technologies far superior then ours"&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Ahmad. Dajjal, page 10&lt;/ref&gt; and meeting with the [[Twelfth Imam]], the Ninth (generation) from the Third ([[al-Husayn]] the third Imam) (referring here to the Masters of Wisdom from the [[Emerald Tablet]]), who also ascended to the heavens, and is still alive like his ancestor Hermes Trismegistus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ahmedamiruddin.wordpress.com/ |title=Sayyid A. Amiruddin &amp;#124; An Authorized Khalifah of H.E Mawlana Shaykh Nazim Adil al-Haqqani |publisher=Ahmedamiruddin.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A late Arabic writer wrote of the [[Sabaeans]] that their religion had a sect of star worshipers who held their doctrine to come from Hermes Trismegistus through the prophet Adimun.&lt;ref name=stapleton&gt;{{cite book |title= Chemistry in Iraq and Persia in the Tenth Century AD: Memoirs of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Volume 8 |last=Stapleton |first=H.E.|date=1927 |author2= R.F.

[[Antoine Faivre]], in ''[[The Eternal Hermes]]'' (1995), has pointed out that Hermes Trismegistus has a place in the [[Islam]]ic tradition, although the name ''[[Hermes]]'' does not appear in the ''Qur'an''. [[Hagiographer]]s and chroniclers of the first centuries of the Islamic [[Hijra (Islam)|Hegira]] quickly identified Hermes Trismegistus with Idris,&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Van Bladel, ''The Arabic Hermes. From pagan sage to prophet of science'', Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 168 "Abu Mas'har’s biography of Hermes, written approximately between 840 and 860, would establish it as common knowledge."&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Prophets of Islam|nabi]]'' of [[sura]]hs 19.57 and 21.85,  whom the ''[[Arabs]]'' also identified with [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] (cf. Genesis 5.18–24). Idris/Hermes was termed "Thrice-Wise" Hermes Trismegistus because he had a threefold origin. The first Hermes, comparable to [[Thoth]], was a "civilizing hero", an initiator into the mysteries of the divine science and wisdom that animate the world; he carved the principles of this sacred science in [[Egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyphs]]. The second Hermes, in [[Babylon]], was the initiator of [[Pythagoras]]. The third Hermes was the first teacher of [[alchemy]]. "A faceless prophet," writes the Islamicist [[Pierre Lory]], "Hermes possesses no concrete or salient characteristics, differing in this regard from most of the major figures of the Bible and the Quran."&lt;ref&gt;(Faivre 1995 pp. 19–20)&lt;/ref&gt; A common interpretation of the representation of "Trismegistus" as "thrice great" recalls the three characterizations of Idris: as a messenger of god, or a prophet; as a source of wisdom, or ''hikmet'' (wisdom from ''hokmah''); and as a king of the world order, or a "sultanate". These are referred to as ''müselles bin ni'me''.

==Bahá'í writings==
[[Bahá'u'lláh]], founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], identifies Idris with Hermes in his ''Tablet on the Uncompounded Reality''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/brown_hermes_apollonius |title=Hermes Trismegistus and Apollonius of Tyana in the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh |publisher=Bahai-library.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He does not, however, specifically name Idris as the prophet of the [[Sabians]].

==New Age revival==
Modern occultists suggest that some Hermetic texts may be of Pharaonic origin, and that the legendary "forty-two essential texts" that contain the core Hermetic religious beliefs and philosophy of life, remain hidden in a secret library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/952966194|title=The forbidden universe|last=Clive,|first=Prince,|isbn=9781472124784|oclc=952966194}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The book ''[[Kybalion]]'', by "[[The Three Initiates]]", addresses Hermetic principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48179182|title=The kybalion : a study of the hermetic philosophy of ancient Egypt and Greece|last=Initiates.|first=Three|date=c. 2000|publisher=Yogi Publication Society, Masonic Temple|isbn=9780911662252|oclc=48179182}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The '''Ibans''' or '''Sea Dayaks''' are a branch of the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] peoples of [[Borneo]], in [[South East Asia]]. Most Ibans are located in the [[Malaysia]]n state of [[Sarawak]]. It is believed that the term "Iban" was originally an [[exonym]] used by the [[Kayan people (Borneo)|Kayans]], who referred to the Sea Dayaks in the upper [[Rajang River|Rajang river]] region when they initially came into contact with them as the "Hivan".

Ibans were renowned for practicing [[headhunting]] and tribal/territorial expansion, and had a fearsome reputation as a strong and successful warring tribe in the past. Since the arrival of Europeans and the subsequent colonisation of the area, headhunting gradually faded out of practice although many other tribal customs and practices as well as the [[Iban language]] continue to thrive. The Iban population is concentrated in [[Sarawak]], [[Brunei]], and in the [[Indonesia]]n province of [[West Kalimantan]]. They traditionally live in [[longhouse]]s called ''rumah panjai''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/borneo-trip-planner-top-five-places-to-visit/story-e6frfqai-1226681932365 |title=Borneo trip planner: top five places to visit |date=2013-07-21 |publisher=News.com.au |accessdate=2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pontianakpost.com/rumah-betang |title=Rumah Betang |author=Leo Sutrisno |date=2015-12-26 |publisher=Pontianak Post |accessdate=2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ibanic Dayak regional groups==

[[File:Sarawak; Sea Dayaks with weapons and head-dresses. Photograp Wellcome V0037431.jpg|thumb|right|Iban men complete with traditional attire, spears, [[Mandau (knife)|Ilang]] and [[Klebit Bok]].]]
Although Ibans generally speak various dialects which are mutually intelligible, they can be divided into different branches which are named after the geographical areas where they reside.
* The majority of Ibans who live around the [[Lundu, Sarawak|Lundu]] and [[Samarahan Division|Samarahan]] region are called [[Sebuyaus]].
* Ibans who settled in areas in [[Serian, Sarawak|Serian]] district (places like ''Kampung Lebor'', ''Kampung Tanah Mawang'' and others) are called [[Remun]]s. They may be the earliest Iban group to migrate to Sarawak.
* Ibans who originated from [[Sri Aman]] area are called [[Balaus]].
* Ibans who come from [[Betong, Sarawak|Betong]], [[Saratok]] and parts of [[Sarikei]] are called ''Saribas''.
* The original Iban [[Lubok Antu District|Lubok Antu]] Ibans are classed by anthropologists as Ulu Ai/batang ai Ibans.
* Ibans from Undup are called Undup Ibans. Their dialect is somewhat a cross between the Ulu Ai dialect and the Balau dialect.
* Ibans living in areas from Sarikei to [[Miri, Malaysia|Miri]] are called Rajang Ibans. This group is also known as "Bilak Sedik Iban". They are the majority group of the Iban people. They can be found along the [[Rajang River]], [[Sibu]], [[Kapit]], [[Belaga, Sarawak|Belaga]], [[Kanowit]], Song, Sarikei, Bintangor, [[Bintulu]] and Miri. Their dialect is somewhat similar to the Ulu Ai or lubok antu dialect.

In [[West Kalimantan]] ([[Indonesia]]), Iban people are even more diverse. The Kantu, Air Tabun, Semberuang, Sebaru, Bugau, [[Dayak Mualang|Mualang]], and many other groups are classed as "Ibanic people" by anthropologists. They can be related to the Iban either by the dialect they speak or their customs, rituals and their way of life.

==Language==
{{Main article|Iban language}}
The [[Iban language|Iban language]] (''jaku Iban'') is spoken by the Iban, a branch of the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] ethnic group formerly known as "Sea Dayak" who live in the [[Malaysia]]n state of [[Sarawak]], the [[Indonesia]]n province of [[West Kalimantan]] and in [[Brunei]]. It belongs to [[Malayic languages]] a [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] branch of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]], and is related to [[Malay language|Malay]], more closely to [[Sarawak Malay|Sarawakian Malay]]. It is thought that the homeland of the [[Malayic languages]] is in western Borneo, where the Ibanic languages remain. The Malayan branch represents a secondary dispersal, probably from central [[Sumatra]] but possibly also from [[Borneo]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Austronesians: historical and comparative perspectives.'' Peter Bellwood, James J. Fox, [[Darrell Tryon]]. ANU E Press, 2006. {{ISBN|1-920942-85-8}}, {{ISBN|978-1-920942-85-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iban language is also a subject tested in PMR and SPM, the Malaysian public examination for Form 3 and Form 5 students respectively. Students comment that questions from these exams mostly cover the classic Iban language, making them a daunting task for many who are more fluent in the contemporary tongue. The language is mostly taught to students in rural areas with a majority Iban population, including [[Baleh, Sarawak|Baleh]] (Kapit), [[Betong Division|Betong]], [[Sri Aman]], [[Saratok]], [[Lubok Antu]], [[Pelagus]] (Kapit), [[Pakan, 

Sarawak|Pakan]] and [[Julau]].
The Iban speaks more or less one language with a variation in intonation according to the region from which each comes from. They have a rich oral literature, noted by Freeman{{fact|date=July 2018}}, who stated: "The Iban probably has more oral literature than the Greek." There is a body of oral poetry which is recited by the Iban depending on the occasion.

==Iban ritual festivals and rites==
{{main article|Gawai Dayak}}
[[File:Sarawak; Sea Dayak tribesmen at a head feast. Photograph. Wellcome V0037464.jpg|thumb|right|An Iban head feast.]]
Significant traditional festivals, or {{lang|iba|gawai}}, to propitiate the above-mentioned gods can be grouped into seven categories which are related to the main ritual activities among the Iban Dayak:
* Farming-related festivals to propitiate the deity of agriculture Sempulang Gana, 
* War-related festivals to honor the deity of war Sengalang Burong, 
* Fortune-related festivals dedicated to the deity of fortune Anda Mara, 
* Procreation-related festival (Gawai Melah Pinang) for the deity of creation Selampandai, 
* Health-related festivals for the deity of shamanism Menjaya and Ini Andan and 
* Death-related festival (Gawai Antu or Ngelumbong) to invite the dead souls for final separation ritual between the living and the dead.
* Weaving-related festival (Gawai Ngar) for patrons of weaving.
For simplicity and cost savings, some of the {{lang|iba|gawai}} have been relegated into the medium category of propitiation called {{lang|iba|gawa}} such as Gawai Tuah into Nimang Tuah, Gawai Benih into Nimang Benih and Gawa Beintu-intu into their respective nimang category wherein the key activity is the timang inchantation by the bards. Gawai Matah can be relegated into a minor rite simply called matah. The first dibbling ({{lang|iba|nugal}}) session is normally preceded by a miring offering ceremony of medium size with {{lang|iba|kibong padi}} (paddy's net) is erected with three flags. The paddy's net is erected by splitting a bamboo trunk into four pieces along its length with their tips inserted into the groud soil. Underneath the paddy's net, all the paddy seeds in baskets or gunny sacks are kept before being distributed by a line of ladies into dibbled holes by a line men in front. 

With headhunting banned and with the advance of Christianity, only some lower ranking ritual festivals are often celebrated by the Iban today such as Sandau Ari (Mid-Day Rite), Gawai Kalingkang (Bamboo Receptacle Festival), Gawai Batu (Whetstone Festival), Gawai Tuah (Fortune Festival) and Gawai Antu (Festival for the Dead Relatives) which can be celebrated without the {{lang|iba|timang jalong}} (ceremonial cup chanting) which reduces its size and cost. 

It is common that all those festivals are to be celebrated after the rice harvesting completion which is normally by the end of May during which rice is plenty for holding feasts along with poultry like pigs, chickens, fish from rivers and jungle meats like deer etc. Therefore, it is fitting to call this festive season among Dayak collectively as the [[Gawai Dayak]] festival which is celebrated every year on 1 June, at the end of the harvest season, to worship the Lord Sempulang Gana and other gods. On this day, the Iban get together to celebrate, often visiting each other.

For hundreds of years, the ancestors of the Iban practiced [[Animism|animistic]] beliefs, although after the arrival of [[James Brooke]], many were influenced by European missionaries and converted to [[Christianity]]. Although the majority are now [[Christian]]; many continue to observe both Christian and traditional ceremonies, particularly during marriages or festivals, although some ancestral practice such as 'Miring' are still prohibited by certain churches. After being Christianized, the majority of Iban people have changed their traditional name to a Hebrew-based "Christian name" such as David, Christopher, Janet, Magdalene, Peter or Joseph, but a minority still maintain their traditional Iban name or a combination of both with the first Christian name followed by a second traditional Iban name such as David Dunggau, Kenneth Kanang, Christopher Changgai, Janet Jenna or Joseph Jelenggai.
There are several reasons why some Iban and other Dayaks convert to Christianity:
* Observing the various {{lang|iba|penti pemali}} (prohibitions) and superstitions dictated by the traditional augury can make life complicated and introduce delays that will slow down one's progress with life and work.
* The healing ({{lang|iba|pelian}}) offered by the {{lang|iba|manangs}} is not effective in curing many diseases, e.g. smallpox, cholera ({{lang|iba|muang ai}}), dengue, etc.
* Christianity is considered a new branch of knowledge to be adopted and adapted to the traditional customs and way of life, leading to the realization that bad old practices such as headhunting are self-destructive to the survival of the Dayak race as a whole.{{fact|date=July 2018}}
* Christianity comes with Western education, which can be used to seek employment on sojourns and upgrade one's standard of living to escape poverty.
* Defeats of Dayaks at the hands of Europeans with better weapons, such as guns and cannons against traditional hand-held weapons such as swords, shields, spears and blowpipes, despite strict adherence to traditional augury practices.
* Some Ibans consider Christianity an extension of human knowledge because it can accommodate some of their traditional practices, e.g. some the ritual festivals can be celebrated in the Christian ways.
* Some churches and pastors prohibit Christian Iban to practice their ancestors' traditional customary ceremonies to honour the {{lang|iba|Petara (gods)}}, spirits and ancestors but they somehow replace the ceremonial procedures with Christian prayers and practices which propiate the Christian God and thereby still retaining the ceremonial title with the same purpose and function. (However, there is a certain degree of flexibility regarding individual observance).

For the majority of Ibans who are Christians, some Christian festivals such as [[Christmas]], [[Good Friday]], [[Easter]] are also celebrated. Most Ibans are devout Christians and follow the Christian faith strictly. Since conversion to Christianity, some Iban people celebrate their ancestors' festivals using Christian ways and the majority still observes Gawai Dayak (the Dayak Festival), which is a generic celebration in nature unless a {{lang|iba|gawai}} proper is held and thereby preserves their ancestors' culture and tradition.

Despite the difference in faiths, Ibans of different faiths do help each other during Gawai and at Christmas. Differences in faith are never a problem in the Iban community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tamara Thiessen|title=Bradt Travel Guide - Borneo|year=2008|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=18-416-2252-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=July 2018}} The Ibans believe in helping and having fun together. Some elder Ibans are worried that among most of their younger Iban generation, their culture has faded since the conversion to Christianity and the adoption of a more Western style of life. Nevertheless, most Iban embrace modern progress and development.

===Cuisine===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
{{lang|ibn|Pansoh}} or {{lang|ibn|[[lulun]]}} is a dish of rice or other food cooked in bamboo cylindrical sections ({{lang|ibn|ruas}}) with one top end cut open to insert food while the bottom end remains closed and uncut to act as a container. A middle aged bamboo tree is normally chosen because its wall still contain water compared to the old, matured bamboo tree which is dryer and thus get burnt by fire more readily. The bamboo also imparts the famous and addicting, special bamboo taste or flavour to the cooked food or rice. Glutinous rice is often cooked in bamboo for routine diet or during celebrations. It is believed in the old days, bamboo cylinders were used to cook food in the absence of metal pots.

{{lang|ibn|Kasam}} is preserved meat or fish. In the absence of refrigerators, often jungle meats from wild games or river fish are preserved by cutting them into small pieces and mixed with salt before being placed into a ceramic jar or glass jar nowadays. Therefore, ceramic jars were precious in the old days as food, tuak or general containers. The preserved meats can last for at least several months.

[[File:Dinner with Iban family (8035179786).jpg|thumb|right|An Iban family serving guest ''tuak''.]]
[[Tuak]] is an Iban wine traditionally made from cooked glutinous rice ({{lang|ibn|[[asi pulut]]}}) mixed with home-made yeast ({{lang|ibn|[[chiping]]{{dn|date=March 2018}}/[[Finger millet|ragi]]}}) for fermentation. It used to serve guests, especially as a welcoming drink when entering a longhouse. Nowadays,{{when|date=August 2018}} there are various kinds of tuak, made with rice alternatives such as [[sugar cane]], [[ginger]] and [[Maize|corn]]. However, these raw materials are rarely used unless available in large quantities. Tuak and other types of drinks (both alcohol and non-alcoholic) can be served on several rounds in a ceremony called {{lang|ibn|[[nyibur temuai]]}} (serving drinks to guests) as {{lang|ibn|[[ai aus]]}} (thirst quenching drink), {{lang|ibn|[[ai basu kaki]]}} foot washing drink), {{lang|ibn|[[ai basa]]}} (respect drink) and {{lang|ibn|[[ai untong]]}} (profit drink). Another type of a stronger alcoholic drink is called {{lang|ibn|[[langkau]]}}, which contains a higher alcohol content because it is actually made of tuak which has been distilled over fire to boil off the alcohol, cooled and collected into containers.

===Music===
{{copyedit|date=August 2018}}

{{main article|Agung}}
Iban music is percussion-oriented. The Iban have a musical heritage consisting of various types of [[Agung#In agung ensembles|agung ensembles]] - percussion ensembles composed of large hanging, suspended or held, bossed/knobbed [[gong]]s which act as drones without any accompanying melodic instrument. The typical Iban agung ensemble will include a set of {{lang|ibn|engkerumungs}} (small agungs arranged together side by side and played like a [[xylophone]]), a {{lang|ibn|tawak}} (the so-called "bass"), a {{lang|ibn|bendai}} (which acts as a [[Snare drum|snare]]) and also a set of {{lang|ibn|ketebung}} or {{lang|ibn|bedup}} (a single sided drum/percussion instrument).

There are various kinds of {{lang|ibn|taboh}} (music), depending the purpose and types of {{lang|ibn|ngajat}}, like {{lang|ibn|alun lundai}}.{{huh|date=August 2018}} The {{lang|ibn|gendang}} can be played in some distinctive types corresponding to the purpose and type of each ceremony with the most popular ones are called {{lang|ibn|gendang rayah}} and {{lang|ibn|gendang pampat}}.

Sape is originally a traditional music by [[Orang Ulu]] (Kayan, Kenyah and Kelabit). Nowadays, both the Iban as well as the [[Orang Ulu]] [[Kayan (Borneo)|Kayan]], Kenyah and Kelabit play an instrument resembling the guitar called the [[Sape (instrument)|sape]]. Datun Jalut and {{lang|ibn|nganjak lansan}} are the most common traditional dances performed in accordance with a sape tune. The [[Sape (instrument)]] is the official musical instrument for the Malaysian state of Sarawak. It is played similarly to the way rock guitarists play [[guitar solo]]s, albeit a little slower, but not as slow as [[blues]].&lt;ref name=Philip&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Hornbill Figure from Borneo.jpg|thumb|right|A 19th century Iban carving of a [[hornbill]].]]

Traditional carvings ({{lang|ibn|ukir}}) include hornbill effigy carving, {{lang|ibn|terabai}} shield, {{lang|ibn|engkeramba}} (ghost statue), knife stilt normally made of deer horn, knife scabbard, decorative carving on the metal blade itself during {{lang|ibn|ngamboh}} blacksmithing e.g. {{lang|ibn|butoh kunding}}, and frightening mask (India guru). Another related category is designing motives either by engraving or drawing with paints such wooden planks, walls or house posts. Even the traditional coffins will be beautifully decorated using both carving and ukir-painting.

The Ibans like to tattoo themselves all over their body. There are motifs for each part of the human body. The purposes are to protect the tattoo bearers or to signify certain events in their life. Some motifs are based on marine lives such as crayfish ({{lang|ibn|rengguang}}), prawn ({{lang|ibn|undang}}) and crab ({{lang|ibn|ketam}}) while other motifs are based on dangerous creatures like cobra ({{lang|ibn|tedong}}), scorpion ({{lang|ibn|kala}}), ghost dog ({{lang|ibn|pasun}}) and dragon ({{lang|ibn|naga}}). Other normal motifs include items which Iban travellers meet during their journey such as aeroplane on the chest. Some Ibans call this art of tattoing as {{lang|ibn|kalingai}} or {{lang|ibn|ukir}}. To signify that an individual has killed an enemy ({{lang|ibn|udah bedengah}}), he is entitled to tattoo his throat ({{lang|ibn|engkatak}}) or his upper-side fingers ({{lang|ibn|tegulun}}). Some traditional Iban do have piercings on the penis (called {{lang|ibn|[[ampallang|palang]]}}) or ear lobes.

[[File:Iban weaver.jpg|thumb|right|An Iban woman prepares cotton for spinning.]]
Woven products are known as {{lang|ibn|betenun}}. Several types of woven blankets made by the Ibans are {{lang|ibn|pua kumbu, pua ikat, kain karap}} and {{lang|ibn|kain sungkit}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ibanology.wordpress.com/2013/04/08/pua-kumbu-the-legends-of-weaving/ |title=Pua Kumbu – The Legends Of Weaving |publisher=Ibanology |accessdate=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using weaving, the Iban makes blankets, bird shirt ({{lang|ibn|baju burong}}), {{lang|ibn|kain kebat, kain betating}} and {{lang|ibn|selampai}}. Weaving is the women's warpath while {{lang|ibn|kayau}} (headhunting) is the men's warpath. They {{lang|ibn|pua kumbu}} do have conventional or ritual motives depending on the purpose of weaving it. Those who finish the weaving lessons are called {{lang|ibn|tembu kayu}} (finish the wood) [&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ibanology.wordpress.com/2013/04/08/pua-kumbu-the-legends-of-weaving|title=Pua Kumbu – The Legends Of Weaving|date=8 April 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]. Among well known ritual motives are Gajah Meram (Brodding Elephant), Tiang Sanding (Ritual Pole), Meligai (Shrine) and Tiang Ranyai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ibanology.wordpress.com/2013/04/23/restoring-panggau-libau-a-reassessment-of-engkeramba-in-saribas-iban-ritual-textiles-pua-kumbu|title=Restoring Panggau Libau: a reassessment of engkeramba’ in Saribas Iban ritual textiles (pua’ kumbu’).|date=23 April 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iban call this skill {{lang|ibn|pandai beranyam}} (skilful in plaiting) various items namely mats ({{lang|ibn|tikai}}), baskets and hats. The Ibans weave mats of numerous types namely {{lang|ibn|tikai anyam dua tauka tiga, tikai bebuah}} (motived mat),&lt;ref&gt;See examples here https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.269499373193118.1073741835.101631109979946&amp;type=3,&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|ibn|tikai lampit}} made of rattan and {{lang|ibn|tikai peradani}} made of rattan and {{lang|ibn|tekalong}} bark. Materials to make mats are {{lang|ibn|beban}} to make the normal mat or the patterned mat, rattan to make {{lang|ibn|tikai}} rotan, {{lang|ibn|lampit}} when the rattan splits sewn using a thread or {{lang|ibn|peradani}} when criss-crossed with the {{lang|ibn|tekalong}} bark, {{lang|ibn|senggang}} to make {{lang|ibn|perampan}} used for drying and {{lang|ibn|daun biru }}to make a normal {{lang|ibn|tikai}} or {{lang|ibn|kajang}} (canvas) which is very light when dry. The names of Iban baskets are {{lang|ibn|bakak}} (medium-sized container for transferring, lifting or medium-term storage), {{lang|ibn|singtong}} (container for raping ripen paddy worn at the waist), {{lang|ibn|raga}} (small container), {{lang|ibn|tubang}} (cylindrical backpack), {{lang|ibn|lanji}} (tall cylindrical backpack) and probably {{lang|ibn|selabit}} (almost rectangular shaped backpack). Another category of plaiting which are normally carried out by men is to make fish traps called {{lang|ibn|bubu gali}}, {{lang|ibn|bubu dudok}}, {{lang|ibn|engsegah}} and {{lang|ibn|abau}} using betong bamaboo splits except {{lang|ibn|bubu dudok}} is made from {{lang|ibn|ridan}} which can be bent without breaking. The Iban also makes special baskets called {{lang|ibn|garong}} for the dead during Gawai Antu with numerous feet to denote the rank and status of the deceased which indicates his ultimate achievement during his lifetime. The Iban also make {{lang|ibn|pukat}} (rectangular net) and {{lang|ibn|jala}} (conical net) after nylon have ropes become available.

Iban also have their own hunting apparatus which include making {{lang|ibn|panjuk}} (rope and spring trap), {{lang|ibn|peti}} (bamboo blade trap) and {{lang|ibn|jarin}} (deer net). Nowadays, they use shotguns and dogs for animal hunting. Dogs are reared by the Ibans in longhouses especially in the past for hunting ({{lang|ibn|ngasu}}) purposes and warning of any danger approaching. Shotguns can be bought from the Brooke government. The Ibans make their own blowpipes, and obtain honey from the {{lang|ibn|tapang}} tree.

The Ibans also can make their boats. The canoes for normal use is called {{lang|ibn|perau}} but big war boats are called {{lang|ibn|bangkong}} or bong which is probably fitted with long paddles and a wind sail made of {{lang|ibn|kajang}} canvas. It is said that {{lang|ibn|bangkong}} is used to sail along the sea coasts of northern Borneo or even to travel across the seas e.g. to Singapore.

Besides that, the Ibans make various blades called {{lang|ibn|[[Niabor|nyabur]], [[Mandau (knife)|ilang]], pedang, [[Parang Chandong|duku chandong]], duku penebas, lungga}} (small blade), {{lang|ibn|sangkoh, jerepang,}} Beirut, and {{lang|ibn|mata lanja sumpit}}. Although silversmithing originates from the {{lang|ibn|Embaloh}}, some Ibans became skilled in this trade to make silverware for body ornaments. The Iban always buy brasswares such {{lang|ibn|tawak}} (gong), {{lang|ibn|bendai}} (snare) and {{lang|ibn|engkerumong}} {{lang|ibn|tabak}} (tray) and {{lang|ibn|baku}} (small box) from other peoples because they do not have the skills of brasssmithing. The Iban makes their own {{lang|ibn|kacit pinang}} to split the ereca nuts and {{lang|ibn|pengusok pinang}} to grind the split pieces of the ereca nut. They also make {{lang|ibn|ketap}} (finger-held blade) to reap ripen paddy stalks and {{lang|ibn|iluk}} (hand-held blade) to weed.

==Agriculture and economy==
Ibans plant rice paddies once a year with twenty seven stages.&lt;ref&gt;Iban Agriculture by JD Freeman&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Report on the Iban by JD Freeman&lt;/ref&gt; Other crops planted include {{lang|ibn|ensabi}}, cucumber ({{lang|ibn|rampu amat and rampu betu}}), {{lang|ibn|brinjal}}, corn, {{lang|ibn|lingkau}}, and cotton before commercial threads are sold in the market.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

For cash, the Ibans find jungle produce for sale in the market. Later, they plant rubber, pepper and cocoa. Nowadays, many Ibans work in the town areas to seek employment or involve in trade or business.{{facts|date=August 2018}}

==Military==
Two highly decorated Iban Dayak soldiers from Sarawak in Malaysia are Temenggung Datuk [[Kanang anak Langkau]] (awarded Seri Pahlawan Gagah Perkasa)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarawaktribune.com/news/48061/Remembering-fallen-heroes-on-Hero-Memorial-Day/ |title=Remembering Fallen Heroes on Hero Memorial Day |author=Ma Chee Seng &amp; Daryll Law |date=2015-08-06 |publisher=New Sarawak Tribune |accessdate=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Awang anak Raweng]] of Skrang (awarded a George Cross).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2015/09/06/ailing-war-hero-may-miss-royal-audience-this-year/ |title=Ailing war hero may miss royal audience this year |author=Rintos Mail &amp; Johnson K Saai |date=2015-09-06 |publisher=The Borneo Post |accessdate=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wingedsoldiers.co.uk/malaysian-troops-trackers.html |title=Sarawak (Malaysian) Rangers, Iban Trackers and Border Scouts |publisher=Winged Soldiers |accessdate=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; So far, only one Dayak has reached the rank of general in the military, Brigadier-General Stephen Mundaw in the Malaysian Army, who was promoted on 1 November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2010/11/02/stephen-mundaw-becomes-first-iban-brigadier-general/ |title=Stephen Mundaw becomes first Iban Brigadier General |date=2010-11-02 |publisher=The Borneo Post |accessdate=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaysia’s most decorated war hero is Kanang Anak Langkau due to his military services helping to liberate Malaya (and later Malaysia) from the communists. Among all the heroes were 21 holders of Panglima Gagah Berani (PGB) which is the bravery medal with 16 survivors. Of the total, there are 14 Ibans, two Chinese army officers, one Bidayuh, one Kayan and one Malay. But the majorities in the Armed Forces are Malays, according to a book – Crimson Tide over Borneo. The youngest of the PGB holder is ASP Wilfred Gomez of the Police Force.

There were six holders of Sri Pahlawan (SP) Gagah Perkasa (the Gallantry Award) from Sarawak, and with the death of Kanang Anak Langkau, there is one SP holder in the person of Sgt. Ngalinuh (an [[Orang Ulu]]).

'''John Langton''' (died 1337) was a [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]] of England and [[Bishop of Chichester]].

==Life==
Langton was a clerk in the royal chancery, serving as the first [[Master of the Rolls]] from May 1286, and became chancellor in 1292.&lt;ref name=Handbook85&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained several ecclesiastical appointments (including as Vicar of [[St. Mary's Church, Horncastle]]), but owing to the resistance of Pope [[Pope Boniface VIII|Boniface VIII]] he failed to secure the [[Bishop of Ely|bishopric of Ely]] in 1298, although he was supported by King [[Edward I of England]] and visited Rome to attain his end.&lt;ref name=BHOEly&gt;Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=33863 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066–1300: Volume 2: Monastic Cathedrals (Northern and Southern Provinces): Ely: Bishops]''&lt;/ref&gt; Resigning his office as chancellor in 1302,&lt;ref name=Handbook85/&gt; he was chosen Bishop of Chichester on 5 April 1305, consecrated bishop on 19 September 1305,&lt;ref name=Handbook239&gt;Fryde, et al.

''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Langton was one of the [[Ordinances of 1311|ordainers]] elected in 1310, and it was probably his connection with this body&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Buck "Langton, John" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; that led to his losing the office of chancellor about this time.&lt;ref name=Handbook85/&gt; He continued, however, to take part in public affairs, mediating between the king and [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster]] in 1318, and attempting to do so between Edward and his rebellious [[baron]]s in 1321.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; He died on 19 July 1337.&lt;ref name=Handbook239/&gt; Langton built the chapterhouse at Chichester, and was a benefactor of the [[University of Oxford]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24785">This '''list of Wazamono''' is a list of 228 swordsmiths&lt;ref name=sesko-legends/&gt; (or 180 depending on the method of counting&lt;ref name=nagayama/&gt;) of [[katana]] and other weapons in the book {{nihongo|''Kaihō kenjaku''|懐宝剣尺|Pocket Treasured Sword Length}}&lt;ref name=nagayama/&gt; or ''Kaihō-kenshaku'', released in 1815&lt;ref name=nagayama/&gt; by [[Yamada Asaemon]].&lt;ref name=sesko-legends&gt;{{cite book|last=Sesko|first=Markus|title=Legends and Stories Around the Japanese Sword|publisher=BoD – Books on Demand|year=2011|isbn=978-384236603-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFTNe-WjyBcC&amp;pg=PA115|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nagayama&gt;{{Harvnb|Nagayama|1997|pp=37–39|loc=(Wazamono list in Eng.-Japanese)}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Yamada Asaemon V was one among a direct line of official sword testers for the [[bakufu]] during the [[Edo period]], every generation of whom inherited that name).

The work lists 12 {{nihongo|''saijō ōwazamono''|最上大業物|"supreme sharpness swords"}}, 21 {{nihongo|''ōwazamono''|大業物|"great sharpness swords"}}, 50 {{nihongo|''ryōwazamono''|良業物|"good sharp swords"}}, 80 {{nihongo|''wazamono''|業物|wazamono|"sharp swords"}}, and 60 (65?) makes with mixed levels of sharpness.

As is well-known, the names of Japanese swords take after its maker. Thus by "sword" here, the "make of the sword", i.e., the signature mark of the swordsmith is meant.

The authoritative list, compiled by the [[samurai]] whose job was testing a katana, had been and is still used as a [[Specification (technical standard)|benchmark]] for a katana. However, this list has also been used by those who sell fake katana.

The list does cover both ''shintō'' ("new sword") as well as the ''kotō'' ("old sword").  However it omits pieces by the most preeminent smiths from the ''kotō'' period (900 to 1596 AD), blades by e.g. Sōshū [[Masamune]] (相州正宗), Sōshū [[Sadamune]] (相州貞宗), [[Bizen Nagamitsu]] (備前長光) and Ise [[Muramasa]] (伊勢村正). Such treasure swords never underwent test-cutting during the Edo period, being considered too valuable as historical art objects to risk damage.

In the following list, the generation designation is converted to [[Roman numeral]], thus {{Nihongo|''Shodai''|初代}}="I (first generation)"; {{Nihongo|''Nidai''|二代}}="II (second generation)", etc.

'''Michael A. "Mike" Brown''' (born April 18, 1950) is a former [[politician]] in [[Ontario]], Canada and was the [[Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] from October 2005 until October 2007. He sat in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Ontario legislature]] representing the northern [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] of [[Algoma—Manitoulin (provincial electoral district)|Algoma—Manitoulin]] for the [[Ontario Liberal Party]] from 1987 to 2011.

==Background==
Brown was educated at the [[University of Western Ontario]] and [[Humber College]], and worked as a funeral director before entering public life.  He is a former member of the Manitoulin Planning Board, and is a past president of the Manitoulin Island Country Club.

==Politics==
Brown was elected to the Ontario legislature in the [[Ontario general election, 1987|provincial election of 1987]], defeating [[New Democratic Party of Ontario|New Democrat]] Ron Boucher and [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative]] Ben Wilson.&lt;ref name="1987 results"&gt;{{cite news |title=Results from individual ridings |newspaper=The Windsor Star |date=September 11, 1987 |page=F2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Algoma—Manitoulin riding had been held by the Progressive Conservatives for several years, and Brown's victory was part of a larger trend towards the Liberal Party in northern Ontario.

The Liberals were defeated by the NDP in the [[Ontario general election, 1990|provincial election of 1990]]. Most ridings in northern Ontario were won by the NDP, and Brown was only able to defeat NDP candidate Lois Miller by 207 votes.&lt;ref name="1990 results"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ontario election: Riding-by-riding voting results |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=September 7, 1990 |page=A12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was re-elected by a larger margin in the [[Ontario general election, 1995|provincial election of 1995]], which was won by the Progressive Conservatives.&lt;ref name="1995 results"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://results.elections.on.ca/results/1995_results/valid_votes.jsp?e_code=36&amp;rec=0&amp;district=Algoma-Manitoulin&amp;flag=E&amp;layout=G |title=Summary of Valid Ballots by Candidate |publisher=Elections Ontario |date=June 8, 1995 |accessdate=2014-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426215608/http://results.elections.on.ca/results/1995_results/valid_votes.jsp?e_code=36&amp;rec=0&amp;district=Algoma-Manitoulin&amp;flag=E&amp;layout=G |archivedate=April 26, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, he endorsed [[Dwight Duncan]]'s bid to lead the Ontario Liberal Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Windsor MPP enters race for Ontario Liberal leadership: Duncan first politician to run for top post |last=Brennan |first=Richard |newspaper=The Ottawa Citizen |date=June 25, 1996 |page=A4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the Tory government of [[Mike Harris]] introduced a measure to reduce the number of ridings in the province from 130 to 103.  Brown's constituency of Algoma—Manitoulin was joined with the neighbouring constituency of [[Algoma (provincial electoral district)|Algoma]] to create a much larger riding bearing the Algoma—Manitoulin name.  He faced New Democrat Lynn Watson and Progressive Conservative Keith Currie in the [[Ontario general election, 1999|election of 1999]]. Although Currie actually received a plurality of votes in the old Algoma riding, Brown's dominance over the eastern corner of the constituency was such that he was able to win re-election without difficulty.&lt;ref name="1999 results"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://results.elections.on.ca/results/1999_results/valid_votes.jsp?e_code=37&amp;rec=0&amp;district=Algoma-Manitoulin&amp;flag=E&amp;layout=G |title=Summary of Valid Ballots by Candidate |publisher=Elections Ontario |date=June 3, 1999 |accessdate=2014-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426215529/http://results.elections.on.ca/results/1999_results/valid_votes.jsp?e_code=37&amp;rec=0&amp;district=Algoma-Manitoulin&amp;flag=E&amp;layout=G |archivedate=April 26, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Tories again won the election; Brown served as Deputy [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] from 2000 to 2001.

The Liberals won a majority government in the [[Ontario general election, 2003|provincial election of 2003]], although Brown was actually re-elected with a reduced majority over New Democrat Peter Denley.&lt;ref name="2003 results"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://results.elections.on.ca/results/2003_results/valid_votes.jsp?e_code=38&amp;rec=0&amp;district=Algoma-Manitoulin&amp;flag=E&amp;layout=G |title=Summary of Valid Ballots by Candidate |publisher=Elections Ontario |date=October 2, 2003 |accessdate=2014-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426215527/http://results.elections.on.ca/results/2003_results/valid_votes.jsp?e_code=38&amp;rec=0&amp;district=Algoma-Manitoulin&amp;flag=E&amp;layout=G |archivedate=April 26, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 23, 2003, he was named [[parliamentary assistant]] to [[David Ramsay (Canadian politician)|David Ramsay]], the [[Ontario Minister of Natural Resources]].  He was elected speaker of the [[38th Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] on October 11, 2005, defeating Tory [[Ted Arnott]] in a two-way contest. The vacancy in the position was caused when [[Alvin Curling]] was named ambassador to the [[Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manitoulin MPP elected Speaker of Ontario legislature |newspaper=Sudbury Star |date=October 12, 2005 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown stood for re-election as Speaker when the [[39th Legislative Assembly of Ontario|39th Legislative Assembly]] first convened following the [[Ontario general election, 2007|2007 provincial election]] but he was defeated by fellow Liberal [[Steve Peters (Ontario politician)|Steve Peters]] on the fourth ballot. Brown's loss was attributed to the perception that he favoured the ruling party when meting discipline to unruly politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MPPs pick ex-cabinet minister as Speaker; Peters promises to be tough but fair in new job |last=Ferguson |first=Rob |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=November 29, 2007 |page=A19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ontario general election, 2011|2011 provincial election]] he lost to NDP candidate [[Michael Mantha]] by nearly 4,000 votes.&lt;ref name="2011 results"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.on.ca/NR/rdonlyres/7849B894-4C4F-490E-9E8C-271BCF0C0D4D/5712/SummaryofvalidvotescastforeacndGE2011.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330163815/http://elections.on.ca/NR/rdonlyres/7849B894-4C4F-490E-9E8C-271BCF0C0D4D/5712/SummaryofvalidvotescastforeacndGE2011.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 30, 2013 |format=PDF |title=Summary of Valid Ballots Cast for Each Candidate |publisher=Elections Ontario |date=October 6, 2011 |accessdate=2014-03-02 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Amnesty International]] reports he was born in [[Saudi Arabia]]; that he was captured in [[Peshawar|Peshawar, Pakistan]], in May 2004;&lt;ref name=AmnestyInternationalOffTheRecord/&gt; that he was transferred from Pakistani custody on June 15, 2004, to CIA custody with three other men, including [[Marwan Jabour]].

==Disappearance==
On April 22, 2009 ''[[Propublica]]'' published a list of CIA captives and its estimate of their current status.&lt;ref name=Propublica2009-04-22&gt;

The location and status of most of the individuals on that list were described simply as "unknown".  They estimated that Mohammed Al Afghani had been transferred to the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]].
The Department of Defense has acknowledged holding an individual they named as "[[Muhammad Rahim al Afghani]]"—but they said he was captured in [[Lahore]], Pakistan in 2007.&lt;ref name=DoDIsn10030&gt;

'''Patricia Sullivan''' is an [[United States|American]], a resident of [[Florida]], who became a leader in the modern [[Tea Party movement]].&lt;ref&gt;

Tuesday, they'll host a coffee -- Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll is slated to attend -- and have an appearance by conservative activist and syndicated columnist Star Parker, said Tea Party Network Chairwoman Patricia Sullivan.
| author      = Dara Kam
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan ran for the [[United States House of Representatives]] under the Tea Party banner in 2010.&lt;ref name=OrlandoSentinel&gt;
{{cite news

| quote       = "Compared to the districts we have now, it's clear you have followed what we asked for," said Patricia Sullivan of Eustis, who ran for Congress under the tea party banner last year. She did note, though, that Lake County appeared to get "the short end of the stick" because it was divided between several Senate and congressional seats.
| page        = 
| author      = 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' quoted her opinion over proposed [[Congressional redistricting]].

In February 2011, [[Florida Governor]] [[Rick Scott]] traveled to Sullivan's hometown of [[Eustis, Florida]] to release the state's 2011 budget.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Scott's office sought out Tea Party leaders for suggestions for where he should release the budget.  The ''Orlando Sentinel'' described his choice of Sullivan's town as a political coup on her part.
Scott's decision was described by the chair of the [[Lake County, Florida|Lake County]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] as an attempt "to get an army together to back his tax cuts."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
7,000 people came to Eustis for the budget.

On November 30, 2011, when the resignation of [[Herman Cain]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Presidential contender, seemed imminent, the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' sought Sullivan's opinion as to who would replace him as a lead contender.&lt;ref name=BostonGlobe2011-11-30&gt;

| quote       = Patricia Sullivan, a Tea Party leader from Florida, said she does not know whom she would support if Cain were to drop out. But she knows which candidate definitely will not get her vote: Romney.  "Absolutely not", said Sullivan, who is chairwoman of The Tea Party Network, a coalition of 79 Tea Party groups in Florida. "Romney is like the antithesis of Cain. Romney is a champion for Romney. Cain is a champion for the people."  Sullivan said she likes Gingrich’s combative style in debates, but does not view him as an alternative to Cain. She said she is concerned that he may not be as conservative as some believe.
| page        = 
| author      = Michael Levenson
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
She didn't state who she would support as an alternative to Cain, but she offered criticism of [[Mitt Romney]].

Six days later, following the Cain's resignation, Marc Caputo, of the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' sought Sullivan's opinion as a key member of Cain's support team.&lt;ref name=TampaBayTimes2011-12-06&gt;

| accessdate  = 2012-01-15
| quote       = Patricia Sullivan, a Lake County tea party organizer who was part of Cain's campaign, said the candidate left a legacy that spoke to the power of the grass roots.  "What I'm doing is I'm taking a step back and I'm reassessing what I want from a candidate," she said. "Because what I wanted I can't have. I wanted a champion for the people."  When asked who was definitely off her list, Sullivan listed Romney, Paul, Jon Huntsman and Michele Bachmann. That leaves Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and former House Speaker Gingrich.
| page        = 
| author      = Marc Caputo
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
At that time she ruled out Mitt Romney, [[Ron Paul]], [[Jon Huntsman, Jr.|Jon Huntsman]] and [[Michele Bachmann]].
Sullivan came second to [[Blaise Ingoglia]] in the [[Florida Republican Party]]'s choice of chairman.&lt;ref&gt;

"We voted on a resolution, welcoming tea party members into our Republican Executive Committees. Now let's walk the walk and unite our voices," she told the GOP gathering.

A '''people''' is a plurality of [[person]]s considered as a whole, as is the case with an [[ethnic group]] or [[nation]]. Collectively, for example, the contemporary [[Frisians]] and [[Danes]] are two related [[Germanic peoples]], while various [[Middle East]]ern ethnic groups are often linguistically categorized as [[Semitic people]]s.

[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]]]]

Various [[sovereign state|states]] govern, or claim to govern, in the name of ''the people''. Both the [[Roman Republic]] and the [[Roman Empire]] used the [[Latin]] term ''[[SPQR|Senatus Populusque Romanus]]'', (the Senate and People of Rome). This term was fixed to Roman legionary standards, and even after the [[Roman Emperor]]s achieved a state of total personal [[autarchy]], they continued to wield their power in the name of the Senate and People of Rome.

A [[People's Republic]] is typically a [[Marxism|Marxist]] or [[Socialism|socialist]] [[one-party state]] that claims to govern on behalf of the people even if it in practice often turns out to be a [[dictatorship]]. [[Populism]] is another umbrella term for various political tendencies that claim to represent the people, usually with an implication that they serve the ''common people'' instead of the [[Elitism|elite]].

Chapter One, Article One of the [[Charter of the United Nations]] states that peoples have the right to [[self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml |title=Charter of the United Nations: Chapter I: Purposes and Principles |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=22 April 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YNQicd2P?url=http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml |archive-date=8 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In law ==
{{further information|Popular sovereignty}}
In [[criminal law]], in certain jurisdictions, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of ''the People''. Several U.S. states, including [[California]], [[Illinois]], and [[New York (state)|New York]], use this style.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[People v. Anderson|California v. Anderson]]'' 6 Cal. 3d 628; 493 P.2d 880; 100 Cal. Rptr. 152; 1972 Cal. LEXIS 154 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; Citations outside the jurisdictions in question usually substitute the name of the state for the words "the People" in the case captions.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, ''[[Bluebook|The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation]]'', rule 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Four states&amp;nbsp;— [[Massachusetts]], [[Virginia]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Kentucky]]&amp;nbsp;— refer to themselves as ''the [[Commonwealth]]'' in case captions and legal process.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Commonwealth (United States)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Other states, such as [[Indiana]], typically refer to themselves as ''the State'' in case captions and legal process. Outside the United States, criminal trials in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[Philippines]] are prosecuted in the name of the people of their respective states.

The political theory underlying this format is that criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the [[sovereignty|sovereign]]; thus, in these [[U.S. states]], the "people" are judged to be the sovereign, even as in the [[United Kingdom]] and other dependencies of the [[British monarchy|British Crown]], criminal prosecutions are typically brought in the name of [[the Crown]]. "The people" identifies the entire body of the [[citizen]]s of a jurisdiction invested with political power or gathered for political purposes.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'', 5th ed., "People".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Pertemba was born in 1948 in [[Khumjung]], [[Solukhumbu District|Solukhumbu]] where his father farmed with about forty yaks. He was sent to live with his grandpapents near [[Cho Oyo]] in the [[Gokyo]] valley when he was five and then his aunts living near [[Tengboche Monastery]] looked after him. He studied with the monks there but when he was eight he became very ill and almost died.&lt;ref name="pertemba"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pertemba Sherpa|editor1-last=Bonington|editor1-first=Chris|editor2-last=Salkeld|editor2-first=Audrey|title=Great Climbs|date=1994|publisher=Mitchell Beazley|isbn=1-85732-573-7 |pages=192-197|chapter=The Sherpa View}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started his education in 1961 at a school founded by [[Edmund Hillary]] was first opened and where he stayed for five years.&lt;ref name=pertemba /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Board of Himalayan Trust Nepal, Pertemba Sherpa, Vice Chairman|url=http://www.himalayantrust.co.nz/board-of-himalayan-trust-nepal/|publisher=[[Himalayan Trust]]|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reaney|first1=Patricia|title=Life for Nepal's Sherpas Hit Peak With Hillary's Arrival, Guide Says|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-07-09/news/mn-5238_1_sherpa-people|accessdate=31 August 2014|work=Los Angeles times|date=9 July 1989}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bonington|first1=Chris|title=Sir Chris Bonington|url=http://www.geographical.co.uk/Magazine/People/Sir_Chris_Bonington_Nov07.html|publisher=Geographical|accessdate=31 August 2014|date=November 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616064341/http://www.geographical.co.uk/Magazine/People/Sir_Chris_Bonington_Nov07.html|archivedate=16 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failing to get a scholarship to continue his education, in 1966 he got a job in the kitchen at [[Lukla Airport]] and then, helped by his knowledge of English, he moved to [[Kathmandu]] to join the first trekking agency in [[Nepal]], Jimmy Roberts' Mountain Travel. He first was a high-altitude porter on a number of expeditions before he became a [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]] leader or [[Sardar|sirdar]].&lt;ref name=pertemba /&gt;&lt;ref name=fisher /&gt;&lt;ref name=shh&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sacred Summits|title=Mr. Pertemba Sherpa|url=http://www.sherpaheritagehouse.org/pertemba-sherpa.pdf|website=Sherpa Heritage House|publisher=Sherpa Heritage House|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mountaineering and trekking==
He took part as a climber in [[Chris Bonington]]'s 1970 [[Annapurna]] and 1975 Everest Southwest Face expeditions (the latter as sirdar). Bonington said he consulted Pertemba frequently, sometimes to the irritation of the lead climbers when he accepted the sirdar's opinion over theirs of the capabilities of the Sherpas and even on the best route to be followed.&lt;ref name=hard73&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bonington|first1=Chris|title=Everest the Hard Way|date=1976|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|location=London|isbn=0340208333|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was expedition co-leader on the American first ascent of [[Gauri Sankar]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=fisher&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fisher|first1=James F.|title=Sherpas: Reflections on Change in Himalayan Nepal|date=1990|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520909946|page=98|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0LjDjCcempQC&amp;pg=PA98|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has climbed [[Mount Everest]] three times although he stopped climbing in 1995 while continuing to lead climbing and trekking expeditions.&lt;ref name=shh /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congratulations !!!

Hulseman developed and introduced the red solo cup, which crucial product of the Solo Cup Company and a part of everyday life for many Americans.&lt;ref name=ctribune/&gt; The cup became an icon of college and [[Tailgate party|tailgate parties]] and an essential element in popular [[drinking games]], including [[beer pong]].&lt;ref name=syracuse/&gt; The red cup was further popularized by [[Toby Keith]]'s 2011 hit single, "[[Red Solo Cup]]".&lt;ref name=syracuse/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

==Biography==
===Early and personal life===
Hulseman was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]], on April 5, 1932.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; His mother, Dorothy (née Hall), was a singer known by the stage name Dora Hall, while his father, Leo Hulseman, established the Solo Cup Company, a manufacturer of disposable cups, bowls and plates, in 1936.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Robert Hulseman survived polio as a teenager, which left one of his legs shorter than the other, which was surgically corrected, and affected the left side of his body.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

He met his wife, Sheila, with whom he had ten children, while both were students at [[Marquette University]].&lt;ref name=ctribune/&gt; He also briefly served in the United States Army.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

===Career===
His father, Leo Hulseman, a former [[Dixie Cup]] employee, had founded the Solo Cup Company in 1936.&lt;ref name=syracuse/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Robert Hulseman joined his father's company as a factory worker when he was 18-years old and worked his way through a series of jobs.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Hulseman later developed the Solo Cup Company's plastic business, which would lead to the development of the plastic red solo cup during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

Robert Hulseman created the solo cup during the mid-1970s and utilized his own children and family as a [[focus group]].&lt;ref name=ctribune/&gt; Hulseman would place small plastic cups of varying colors on his kitchen table for his kids to peruse, including blue, red, peach and yellow.&lt;ref name=ctribune/&gt; While the peach cups were not a hit, the red solo cups proved popular with both his children and consumers.&lt;ref name=ctribune/&gt; Hulseman, himself, favored blue solo cups.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

Husleman initially launched the red solo cups in smaller 5, 7 and 9 ounce sizes.&lt;ref name=ctribune/&gt; However, he eventually introduced the iconic 16 ounce red solo cup, which proved to be the most popular size long term.&lt;ref name=ctribune/&gt; When the 16 ounce red cups were first sold, very few consumers drank beers that size. However, consumer tastes changed to match the size of the popular plastic cups.&lt;ref name=ctribune/&gt; Today, the plastic solo cups are manufactured in dozens of colors, but the red solo cups remain the company's best seller.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

Hulseman became President of the Solo Cup Company, which he inherited from his father, in 1980, succeeding his father.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; He later became the company's CEO as well.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

In 1986, Hulseman and his employee, Jack Clements, developed the Traveler Lid for use on coffee cups and other hot beverage containers.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; The Traveler Lid provides space for foam or whipped cream for hot drinks, such as cappuccinos and lattes, and prevents the foam from reaching the consumer's nose.&lt;ref name=syracuse/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; While both Clements and Hulseman designed the lid, Clements retains the rights to its [[patent]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; The [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) in [[New York City]] honored the Traveler Lid as part of its 122 "Humble Masterpieces" of design exhibition in 2004.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

He retired as CEO in 2006, two years after the family company had acquired rival [[Sweetheart Cup Company]], another manufacturer of [[disposable cup]]s.&lt;ref name=syracuse/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

Hulseman was also a devote [[Catholic]] and a [[philanthropist]], known to support [[anti-poverty]] initiatives and [[Catholic schools]].&lt;ref name=syracuse/&gt; He and his family attended Mass weekly at Saints Faith, Hope and Charity Roman Catholic Church in [[Winnetka, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=ctribune/&gt;

The Solo Cup Company was acquired by the [[Dart Container|Dart Container Corporation]] in 2012.&lt;ref name=ctribune/&gt;

Hulseman's health deteriorated during his later years following a series of strokes.&lt;ref name=ctribune/&gt; He died from stroke complications at his home in [[Northfield, Illinois]], on December 21, 2016, at the age of 84.&lt;ref name=ctribune/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; He was survived by nine children and 30 grandchildren.&lt;ref name=syracuse/&gt; His wife, Sheila, whom he had been married to for 60 years, died in August 2015 and one of his children, Jean Hulseman Kloos, died in August 2016.&lt;ref name=syracuse/&gt;

Country singer Toby Keith paid tribute to Hulseman on [[Twitter]], writing, "Raise one for this good man today."&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

'''Said Buryatsky''' aka Buryatyali (February 10, 1982&amp;nbsp;– March 2, 2010) was an [[Islamist]] militant leader in the Russian [[North Caucasus]]. Buryatsky had been among the most-wanted men in Russia, and he was considered an [[ideologue]] leader of the Islamist rebels in [[Chechnya]] and southern Russia.&lt;ref name=Tel/&gt; He was known in the region as a Russian counterpart of Osama bin Laden.&lt;ref name=Tel/&gt; Buryatsky had been identified in [[YouTube]] videos, wearing camouflage while preaching radical Islam with an assault rifle.&lt;ref name=Tel/&gt;

Buryatsky, whose birth name was Alexander Alexandrovitch Tikhomirov,&lt;ref name=Ivan/&gt; was born February 10, 1982 in [[Ulan-Ude]], the capital of [[Buryatia]]. His father was a [[Buryats|Buryat]] [[Buddhist]], and his mother was a [[Russia]]n [[Christian]].&lt;ref name=Geo/&gt; Raised as Buddhist, he reportedly converted to [[Islam]] at the age of 15. He studied at a Muslim theological institute in [[Orenburg]], run by one of Russia's official Muslim Spiritual Boards, and then, from 2002-2005, studied in [[Cairo]] and [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref name=rfe&gt;{{Cite web |title=Militant Website Confirms Buryatsky's Death  |date=7 March 2010 |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Militant_Website_Confirms_Buryatskys_Death/1976923.html | publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buryatsky moved to the [[North Caucasus]] in late 2007 or early 2008, where he became an important [[ideologue]] of the [[Caucasus Emirate]]. He criticized [[Sufi]] Muslims, critics of the Emirate, and spoke out against the commanders who disagreed with [[Dokka Umarov]].&lt;ref name=mlm&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buryatsky was reportedly responsible for the reactivation of the [[Riyad-us Saliheen Brigade of Martyrs|Riyadus-Salikhin]] [[shahid]] brigade of [[suicide bombers]] originally formed by [[Chechen people|Chechen]] field commander [[Shamil Basayev]].&lt;ref name="rfe"/&gt; He was being investigated for involvement with the [[2009 Nevsky Express bombing]], leaving 28 dead and 90 wounded; however, he was never brought to trial.&lt;ref name=Tel/&gt;

On March 2, 2010, Buryatsky was killed in the village of Ekazhevo in [[Ingushetia]] (Russia), during a Russian military operation involving units of the [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB) and the [[Russian Interior Ministry]].&lt;ref name="mlm"/&gt; A spokesman said that FSB troops had found a bomb factory inside the same house where the militants had been cornered in Ingushetia.&lt;ref name=Tel/&gt;

Black was the founding chair of the BCS Specialist Group [[BCSWomen]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcs.org/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.8353 Dr Sue Black|Committee|BCSWomen], [[British Computer Society]].&lt;/ref&gt; and remained in that position until 2008.

===Campaigns===
Black ran a successful campaign over several years to secure funding for the restoration of [[Bletchley Park]], the UK [[World War II]] centre for decrypting enemy messages.&lt;ref name="saving" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;Cellan-Jones, Rory, ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/technology/2009/03/bletchley_parks_social_media_w.html Bletchley Park's social media war]'', [[BBC News]], 18 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, she started raising awareness of the site by creating a blog,&lt;ref&gt;Brain, Jon, ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7523743.stm Neglect of Bletchley condemned]'', [[BBC News]], 24 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; after visiting the site and noting the appalling condition of the buildings, seeing the Bombe machine being rebuilt, and hearing that over 10,000 people had worked there during the war. The photograph of one of the huts with a blue tarpaulin protecting the deteriorating structure helped galvanise interest and activism among concerned computer scientists. The initial outreach was followed up with an active Twitter presence that attracted even more followers and interested parties. Bletchley Park staff also engaged with other [[Web 2.0]] (i.e. user-generated) technologies such as Facebook and Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Thomson | first=Rebecca | url=http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2009/03/19/235325/bletchley-park-wins-crucial-funding-using-facebook-and.htm | title=Bletchley Park wins crucial funding using Facebook and Twitter | newspaper=[[Computer Weekly]] | date=19 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.archimuse.com/mw2010/papers/black/black.html |title=Can Twitter Save Bletchley Park? |last=Black |first=Sue |date=13–17 April 2010 |work=Museums and the Web 2010 |publisher=[[Archives &amp; Museum Informatics]] |last2=Bowen |first2=Jonathan P.&lt;!--http://www.archimuse.com/mw2010/bios/au_3817.html--&gt; |editor-last=Bearman |editor-first=David |location=[[Denver]], United States |last3=Griffin |first3=Kelsey &lt;!--http://www.archimuse.com/mw2010/bios/au_445017569.html--&gt; |editor2-first=Jennifer |editor2-last=Trant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2015, Black published a book about the process, ''Saving Bletchley Park'',&lt;ref name="saving"/&gt; initially funded via [[Unbound (publisher)|Unbound]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Saving Bletchley Park|url = https://unbound.co.uk/books/saving-bletchley-park|website = Unbound|accessdate = 30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that became the fastest [[Crowdfunding|crowdfunded]] book of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.womanthology.co.uk/celebrating-the-incredible-codebreakers-of-bletchley-park-dr-sue-black-computer-scientist-writer-and-speaker/|title=Celebrating the incredible codebreakers of Bletchley Park – Dr. Sue Black OBE, Computer Scientist, Writer and Speaker – Womanthology|website=Womanthology|access-date=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tej Bahadur Chitrakar''' ([[Devanagari]]: तेज बहादुर चित्रकार; 1898-1971) was a Nepalese artist who had a prolific artistic career in the early 20th century. He was one of the leaders in the development of contemporary art in Nepal in the early 20th century. Chitrakar spearheaded the trend of creating art using new techniques for its aesthetic value, and introduced a new style in the milieu of traditional art which is essentially religious and follows descriptions laid down in ancient texts.&lt;ref name="book1"&gt;''Images of a Lifetime--: A Historical Perspective'', 20 November-5 December 2005, Siddhartha Art Gallery, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siddharthaartgallery.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=70&amp;Itemid=11|title=History|author=Administrator|work=siddharthaartgallery.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nepalitimes.com/news.php?id=2051#.VOddhy7RNLE|title=Giving their art and soul|publisher=Nepali Times|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
Tej Bahadur was born in [[Lalitpur District, Nepal|Lalitpur]] as a second son to Shivadas and Ashamati in the [[chitrakar]] caste of [[Newar]] community. The caste [[chitrakar]] were traditionally entrusted by the state or the Malla ruler as sole custodian of tradition of religious paintings in the valley since 14th century AD. The extraordinary family background and his own talent since his early childhood led him to the Government college of Fine Art in 1918 at Calcutta (now Kolkata) as one of the earliest Nepali to receive the degree in Fine Art with distinction in portraiture in Oil in 1927. His education was sponsored by the then prime minister Chandra Shumsher. He returned to Nepal in 1929 AD.

He heralded a change in Nepalese art scene from traditional religious art to modern Western-style paintings. He also began teaching art at
Durbar High School and later became head of Juddha Art School&lt;ref name="book1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madan Chitrakar, Tej Bahadur Chitrakar Icon of a Transition, TeBaChi Studies Center, 2004, {{ISBN|9789993387978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artnepal.net/lalitkala|title=Lalit Kala Campus|work=artnepal.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He initiated 'Chitrakala Udhyog Sangh'  (now defunct) to promote Nepali art. Many of his enduring paintings today are in the collection of prestigious Art galleries worldwide.

==Honors==
In 2009, the Postal Services Department, Government of Nepal issued a commemorative postage stamp (Denomination - Rs. 15) depicting a portrait of Tej Bahadur Chitrakar to honor his contribution to the development of art in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediabd.com/newissue/fdc_details.php?country_id=3&amp;entry_id=46&amp;page=3 |title=New Issue :: View FDC Details :: Nepal :: Tej Bahadur Chitrakar (1898-1971 )|author=Mosharaf Husain |work=mediabd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2009-2010 season, Strassberger directed Mozart's ''[[Le nozze di Figaro]]'' at the [[Norwegian National Opera]], [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]'s ''[[Les Huguenots]]'' at the [[Bard SummerScape Festival]], and [[Hector Berlioz]]'s ''[[Les nuits d'été]]'' at [[Opera Azuriales]].

'''His approach to the repertoire'''

Opera News magazine featured Strassberger in its '[https://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2012/8/Features/Thaddeus_Strassberger.html Next Wave' feature] in August 2012.&lt;blockquote&gt; "Strauss and Hofmannsthal, Verdi and Solera — even going back to da Ponte and Mozart — you feel as if everyone is in this constant state of gloom and doom: the theaters are shutting down next year, the quality isn't what it was, we don't have the voices we used to have. When Verdi presented the score of ''Nabucco'' to Bartolomeo Merelli, they said, 'There's no budget.' Verdi said, 'I've got Strepponi and the whole cast,' and they said, 'You'll have to use sets from the warehouse,' and Verdi said, 'That's all right. Let's get it onstage.' That's no different from an American company saying you have to rub two sticks together to get the production on because our NEA budget got cut this year." &lt;/blockquote&gt;In the June 2012 issue of the British magazine, ''Opera'', which examines recent repertoire trends which reveal a move towards the rare and unusual, Strassberger makes the following observation regarding the staging of some of them:
 
:"I love these works and they give me the freedom to turn up as a director and put them on stage without having to un-engineer what people thought they were going to be.  The audience can focus on what they are experiencing rather than making comparisons with the past."&lt;ref&gt;Yehudi Shapiro, "Rarity Value", ''Opera'' (London), June 2012. Vol. 63, No. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work with opera singer training programs===
Strassberger has also served on the staffs of several programs for opera singers in training. In 2006 he joined the faculty of the [[International Vocal Arts Institute]] (IIVA) in [[Tel Aviv]] where he directed the school's opera productions for two years. He has also directed operas at the IIVA in [[Chiari, Lombardy]], [[Italy]] and for the [[Opera Theatre of Lucca]]. In 2019, he works with Banff Centre's Opera in the 21st Century&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.banffcentre.ca/programs/opera-21st-century-instrumentalists/20190603|title=Opera in the 21st Century: Instrumentalists|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; developing new work with [[Paola Prestini]] and [[Royce Vavrek]].

{{Chinese name|[[Wang (surname)|Wang]]}}

'''Wang Guangmei''' ({{zh|c=王光美|p=Wáng Guāngmĕi|w=Wang Kuang-mei}}; 26 September 1921 – 13 October 2006) was a Chinese politician, philanthropist and the wife of [[Liu Shaoqi]], who served as the [[President of the People's Republic of China]] from 1959 to 1968.

==Life==
===Early years===
Wang Guangmei was born in 1921, and grew up in a distinguished and prominent Chinese family. Her father was a government minister and a diplomat; her mother was an educator. She studied [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[English language|English]], learning to speak all three, and earned a degree in physics from the [[Fu Jen Catholic University|Catholic University of Peking]] in Beijing. She also studied at an American missionary university, and was described as a sophisticated woman. In the mid-1940s, Wang Guangmei traveled to the Communist Party headquarters in [[Yan'an]] and served as an interpreter during efforts by the American statesman [[George Marshall]] to negotiate a truce between the Nationalist government and the Communist rebels. At this occasion, she gained the admiration of many Americans, which would later play a role in charges that she was an American spy.

There, at the age of 24, she met [[Liu Shaoqi]], who was nearly twice her age and had previously been married on five occasions. For years she served as his secretary, and he was named a key deputy to Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] after the Communists took power in 1949. In 1959, Liu was named [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese President]], making him the second-most powerful man in the country.

===First lady===
After Liu became president in 1959, Wang became a very visible diplomatic companion to him. Wang Guangmei became once widely known in China as its beautiful, articulate, sophisticated first lady. In the early 1960s, the couple traveled abroad on state visits to [[Kingdom of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[Burmese Way to Socialism|Burma]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Indonesia]]. In 1963, she joined a work team investigating corruption in the countryside, a mounting problem after the [[Great Leap Forward]], Mao's development programme of 1958–61.

===Cultural Revolution===

Liu and his wife became targets of the [[Cultural Revolution]], instigated by Chairman Mao. In mid-1966, when Mao's [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] erupted into prominence — and Liu and other leaders tried to fathom what Mao had in mind — Wang headed a work team to restore order among the students at Beijing's [[Tsinghua University]]. The effort backfired when she came under attack by a militant opponent who accused her of being a counterrevolutionary. Her husband was also under fire by Mao and his deputies for being the leading "[[capitalist roader]]".

Wang Guangmei's public role had also antagonized Mao's wife [[Jiang Qing]], who was growing politically ambitious. In April 1967, at Jiang's instigation, the Red Guards forced Wang to put on a tight-fitting [[qipao]] dress she had worn at a banquet in Indonesia, with silk stockings, high heels and a mocking necklace made out of [[table tennis|ping-pong]] balls, as proof of her bourgeoise, counterrevolutionary attitude.{{sfnp|Lawrence|2004|p=198}}&lt;ref&gt;https://internalreference.com/crimes-of-fashion-56d6fd77b38c&lt;/ref&gt;

The disgraced President Liu died in prison. Wang was put under house arrest, then imprisoned. Her four children were also punished. Imprisoned in [[Qincheng Prison]] during the cultural revolution, Wang was kept in ignorance of her family's fate. After four years, her children plucked up the courage to ask Mao for permission to see their parents. It was through his terse consent, "Their father is dead but they may see the mother", that Wang learned of her husband's death. Wang spent about 12 years in prison, and was released in 1979 — just before Mao's widow Jiang Qing and her [[Gang of Four]], who were blamed for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution, were put on trial.

===Later years===

Soon, Liu's reputation was rehabilitated, and Wang received compensation for her suffering during the Cultural Revolution. In 1980, she appeared in court during the trial of the Gang of Four as a victim of Jiang Qing's prosecution. Later, Wang was elected a permanent member of the National People's Political Consultative Conference. She founded the "Hope Project", a program aimed at aiding the poor throughout China. She even donated some of her family's valuable antiques, a few dating back to the Qing and Song dynasties, to charity.

Wang died on October 13, 2006, at the No. 305 Military Hospital in Beijing. Her funeral was held at the [[Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery|Babaoshan Revolutionary Martyrs' Cemetery]] in Beijing on October 21, 2006.

==Family==
Wang is survived by four children, some of whom have risen to prominent positions.

Her eldest son, retired Gen. [[Liu Yuan (politician)|Liu Yuan]], was a prominent officer in the People's Liberation Army.

Her daughter Liu Ting graduated from [[Boston University]] and [[Harvard Business School]], and is chairman and president of the Asia Link Group, consultants in corporate finance.

[[File:William Dow.jpg|thumb|William Dow]]
'''William Dow''' (March 27, 1800 – December 7, 1868) was a British-born brewer and financier of [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada.

Born at [[Muthill]], [[Perthshire]], he was the eldest son of Dr William Dow (1765-1844), [[Brewmaster]], and Anne Mason. Since 1652, his family had been brewing in [[Perthshire]]. Having gained an extensive experience in brewing under his father, he emigrated to Montreal, [[Lower Canada]] from [[Scotland]] in about 1818. He was employed as foreman of Thomas Dunn's brewery in Montreal and quickly became a partner. His younger brother, Andrew, who had also trained as a brewer, joined him, and on the death of Dunn, the company became known as ''William Dow and Company'', later known as [[Dow Breweries]]. It soon was a strong competitor to [[Molson]]'s, the biggest brewery in the city. Dow was also a [[financier]] and in 1860 he built his home, ''Strathearn House'', in Montreal's [[Golden Square Mile]].

'''Zadock Pratt Jr.''' (October 30, 1790 &amp;ndash;  April 5, 1871) was a [[Tanner (occupation)|tanner]], banker, soldier, and member of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Pratt served in the [[New York militia]] from 1819&amp;ndash;1826, and was [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] of the 116th regiment from 1822 until his resignation from the militia on September 4, 1826.&lt;ref name="1868 Biography, p. 9"&gt;[[#bio2|1868 Biography]], p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Catskill Mountains]], Pratt built the largest [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]] in the world at its time, and built the town of [[Prattsville, New York|Prattsville]] to accommodate the labor force necessary for the tannery, raising the town's population from around 500 to over 2000. Pratt was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1836 and 1842. During his second term, in 1845 he first proposed the [[transcontinental railroad]]. In 1848, Pratt tried but failed to receive the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]/[[Barnburners and Hunkers|Hunker]] nomination for the [[New York state election, 1848|1848 New York state gubernatorial election]]. He was a delegate to the [[1852 Democratic National Convention]].

In 1843, Pratt established the Prattsville Bank with, which printed its own bills that were kept on par with the [[US dollar]], but he closed the bank nine years later in 1852. Pratt financed multiple smaller tanneries in the Catskills, and also one in [[Pennsylvania]] as a joint venture with [[Jay Gould]]. In 1860 he retired from active business pursuits, and died in 1871.

==Early life and family==
Zadock Pratt was born on October 30, 1790, in [[Stephentown]], [[New York (state)|New York]], to Hannah Pratt ([[née]] Pickett) and Zadock Pratt Sr. He was the 5th of 7 children.&lt;ref&gt;[[#bio|Capen]], pp. 14, 15, 17&lt;/ref&gt; In 1797, Pratt moved with his father's family to Midleburg, New York.&lt;ref name="1868 Biography, p. 3"&gt;[[#bio2|1868 Biography]], p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1802, at age 12, Pratt moved with his parents to [[Windham, New York]], which soon became [[Lexington, New York|Lexington]], and is current day [[Jewett, New York|Jewett]]. As a child, he received limited schooling at the public school, and instead worked much on his father's farm and in his tannery.&lt;ref&gt;[[#bio|Capen]], p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; In his father's yard there were "two limes" and eight vats, and the bark was ground with a circular millstone by horse power.&lt;ref name="1868 Biography, p. 3"/&gt;

In 1810, at age 20, Pratt became an apprentice to Luther Hayes, a sadler in [[Durham, New York|Durham]]. Following his apprenticeship, he became a traveling saddler for a year, during which he saved $100.&lt;ref&gt;[[#bio2|1868 Biography]], p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1812, he returned to Lexington where he continued his work as a saddler, working fourteen-hour days. In 1814, Pratt built a general store in Prattsville where he would barter with residents for goods, and would make periodic trips to [[New York City]] to trade the goods.&lt;ref name="Capen, p. XV"&gt;[[#bio|Capen]], p. XV&lt;/ref&gt;

Pratt volunteered for the [[War of 1812]] in 1814.  He was a Steward of a company stationed at [[Brooklyn Heights]]. He was awarded $11 for his claim of arms and clothing which were destroyed during the war.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} In 1857, he would receive a warrant of {{convert|160|acre|km2}} of land for his service.&lt;ref&gt;[[#bio2|1868 Biography]], p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; In 1815, after war ended, he returned to Lexington, sold his store.&lt;ref name="Capen, p. XV"/&gt; On May 7, 1817, he entered the tanning business with  his older brother Ezra, and his younger brother Bennett.&lt;ref&gt;[[#bio2|1868 Biography]], p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; October 18, 1818, Pratt married Beda Dickerman of [[Hamden, Connecticut]], who died of [[tuberculosis]] six months later on  April 19, 1819. Pratt and his brother Ezra then bought out Bennett's share of the tanning business for $2200.&lt;ref&gt;[[#bio|Capen]], p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |width=30em | align=left  | quote=Wealth makes the man,&amp;mdash;and want of it, the fellow.|source=Zadock Pratt&lt;ref name="Capen, p. 47"&gt;[[#bio|Capen]], p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;}}
During the winter of 1819–20, Pratt and three of his neighbors went on a trading expedition to Canada to sell their leather and other goods. They were successful, and traded their leather for gold and furs from Canadian settlers{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}, and from Native Americans at [[Rice Lake (Ontario)|Rice Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#bio|Capen]], pp. 38–47&lt;/ref&gt; On his return, he stopped at the bank in [[Catskill (town), New York|Catskill, New York]], where he learned that his tannery had burned down in his absence&lt;ref name="Capen, p. 47"/&gt; The building was uninsured, and was a loss of $1000; the cause was never determined.&lt;ref name="1868 Biography, p. 6"&gt;[[#bio2|1868 Biography]], p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; However, he resolved to rebuild it.&lt;ref name="Capen, p. 47"/&gt; Friends of Pratt's and his brothers donated money for the rebuilding, and it was quickly built.&lt;ref&gt;[[#bio|Capen]], p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1821, Pratt was appointed a magistrate of Lexington.&lt;ref&gt;[[#bio|Capen]], p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; In 1823, Pratt married Esther Dickerman, sister of his first wife. Esther died less than a year later on April 22, 1824, also of [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name="Capen, p. 50"&gt;[[#bio|Capen]], p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pratt's tannery===
Pratt had been planning a tanning business much larger than what he was currently engaged in, and Esther's death put him into action. He dissolved his partnership with his brother, and, with $14000 in capital, began seeking a location for his new tannery.&lt;ref name="Capen, p. 50"/&gt; He spent the summer of 1824 exploring the surrounding counties with his dog for the best place for his planned operations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#bio|Capen]], p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; He decided on a region in the very western part of Windham, in what is current day [[Prattsville, New York|Prattsville]], for its large forests of [[Tsuga|hemlock]], which was necessary for tanning at the time, as well as its proximity to the [[Schoharie Creek]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#bio|Capen]], pp. 54, 55&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prattsville Commercial Building]], built about 1824, listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 24, he moved all of his belongings to the site and purchased the large meadow for $1300. The following day he broke ground on the tannery, and with the help of laborers, dammed the creek in the following weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#bio|Capen]], pp. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

The tannery was 550' long, and 43' wide. There were 350 vats, 6 heaters, 12 leaches, two [[bark mill]]s driven by a great wheel, and three hide mills.&lt;ref&gt;[[#bio2|1868 Biography]], p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Tannery foreman [[Osmer B. Wheeler]] later went on to open his own tannery, in [[Forestburgh, New York]], and became a member of the [[New York State Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eYkDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA106 ''Biographical Sketches of the State Officers and Members of the Legislature of the State of New York in 1859''] by William D.

==First term as Congressman==
In 1836, Pratt earned the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nomination for New York's 8th congressional district. He won general election by just short of 3,000 votes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#bio|Capen]], pp. 135,136&lt;/ref&gt; On September 10, 1837 Pratt was appointed to the Committee of the Militia, and on December 11, was appointed to the committee on public buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#bio|Capen]], p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 19, 1838, Pratt introduced a bill to drastically lower postage rates, and argued that high postage costs disproportionately affected the poor, and that it was effectively a tax on intelligence, as it hindered the free passage of information.&lt;ref&gt;[[#bio|Capen]], pp. 151, 152&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was passed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} He felt so strongly about the price of postage that on his grave he had inscribed "WHILE MEMBER OF CONGRESS; MOVED THE REDUCTION OF POSTAGE; A.D. 1838".

On February 25, 1839, Pratt suggested that public buildings no longer be built out of [[sandstone]], but instead [[granite]] of [[marble]], because they absorb very little water compared to sandstone, and therefore required less maintenance He also noted that marble was cheaper than granite, when including building costs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#bio|Capen]], pp. 144–146&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 4, 1838, he announced that he declined re-election, although his constituents strongly wanted him to serve another term.&lt;ref&gt;[[#stoddard|Stoddard (1848)]], p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second term as Congressman==
[[File:Zadock Pratt full length portrait cropped.jpg|thumb|left|A full-length portrait of Pratt that was engraved on steel in 1845.]]
Pratt did not intend to run for Congress again after declining to run for re-election following his first term as Congressman.&lt;ref&gt;[[#bio|Capen]], p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1842 he accepted the nomination.

==Legacy as a Congressman==

==Zadock Pratt's wives==
Pratt had five wives throughout his life. 
His first wife was Beda Dickerman, whom he married in 1818.  She died of [[tuberculosis]] seven months later.  In 1821 Pratt married his first wife's sister, Esther Dickerman.  Esther died two and a half years later, also from tuberculosis.  Pratt married his third wife, Abigail P. Watson of [[Rensselaerville]], on January 12, 1829. Pratt had his only children with Abigail, a boy and a girl.  George Watson Pratt was born on April 18, 1831.  Three years later Julia P. Pratt was born on January 26, 1834.  On February 5, 1834 Abigail, Pratt's third wife, died at twenty-eight years old from complications from the birth of her daughter.  Some time later, Pratt married Abigail's sister Mary.  They were married until July 17, 1868 when Mary died of unknown causes.  One year later Pratt married his fifth wife, Susie A. Grimm of Brooklyn, October 16, 1869.  They were married in Grace Episcopal Church, Prattsville; Zadock had given the land and half the money to build the church.  They were married until Zadock's death.

==Later life and death==
[[File:Gould-Jay 03.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Jay Gould]] in 1855, one year before he met Pratt.]]
[[File:Old Zadock Pratt portrait trimmed.gif|thumb|left|125px|An undated photo of an aged Zadock Pratt.]]
In 1856, Zadock Pratt, at 66 years old, met a teenage [[Jay Gould]], and hired him to survey a tanning site in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Northrop 1892, p. 41"&gt;[[#gould|Northrop (1892)]], p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris 2005, p. 22"&gt;[[#tycoons|Morris (2005)]], p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;  Gould found large tracts of hemlock forest for sale, which impressed Pratt,&lt;ref name="Northrop 1892, p. 41"/&gt; who then made Gould a partner and manager of the new tannery.&lt;ref name="Morris 2005, p. 22"/&gt; By another account, Gould decided that he wanted to build a tannery, found a site, and then sought out Pratt's assistance.&lt;ref&gt;[[#gould|Northrop (1892)]], p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

There was $120,000 capital for the project, all of which came from Pratt.&lt;ref name="Northrop 1892, p. 43"&gt;[[#gould|Northrop (1892)]], p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; He left the tannery to Gould, which expanded rapidly, and the surrounding settlement was called [[Gouldsboro, Pennsylvania|Gouldsboro]]&lt;ref name="Northrop 1892, p. 43"/&gt; (also spelled Gouldsborough).&lt;ref&gt;[[#tycoons|Morris (2005)]], p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pratt became dissatisfied with the returns on his investment, and was concerned that Gould was embezzling.&lt;ref name="Northrop 1892, p. 45"&gt;[[#gould|Northrop (1892)]], p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Gould had become acquainted with Charles M. Leupp, a rich merchant from New York City, and had convinced Leupp to loan him the money to buy out Pratt's share. Gould offered Pratt $60,000 for his share of the tannery, which Pratt accepted, transferring Pratt's stake to Leupp.&lt;ref name="Northrop 1892, p. 45"/&gt;

In 1861, Pratt donated to Prattsville the {{convert|20|acre|m2}} where [[Pratt Rock]] now is.&lt;ref&gt;[[#bio2|1868 Biography]], p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Pratt became ill with a fever while he and his wife were visiting relatives in [[Bergen City, New Jersey|Bergen]], [[New Jersey]], which had recently been annexed by [[Jersey City]]. While recovering he fell down stairs and broke his thigh. He died due to the injury on April 5, 1871. He is buried in the City Cemetery in Prattsville.  [[Pratt Rock]] depicts his life through a series of stone carvings.  His former home at Prattsville, the [[Zadock Pratt House]], was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1986, and has operated as a house museum since 1959.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;
