The '''Amazon Basin''' is a major {{convert|620000|km2|sqmi}} large [[sedimentary basin]] located roughly at the middle and lower course of the [[Amazon River]], south the [[Guiana Shield]] and north of the [[Amazonian Craton|Central Brazilian Shield]]. It is bound to the west by the [[Púrus Arch]], separating the Amazon Basin from the [[Solimões Basin]] and in the east by the [[Gurupá Arch]], separating the basin from the [[Marajó Basin]].&lt;ref name=Ferreira2015_p1&gt;Ferreira et al., 2015, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The basin developed on a [[rift]] that originated possibly about [[Geologic time scale|550 million years ago]] during the [[Cambrian]]. Parts of the rift were reactivated during the opening of the [[South Atlantic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burke |first=Kevin C. |last2=Lytwyn |first2=Jennifer |date=1993 |title=Origin of the Rift Under the Amazon Basin as a Result of Continental Collision During Pan-African Time |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00206819309465563 |journal=International Geology Review |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |volume=35 |issue=10 |pages=881-897 |doi=10.1080/00206819309465563 |access-date=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basin has an elongated shape with a WSW-ENE orientation. It long axis runs from the vicinity of [[Manaus]] to the area near the confluence of [[Xingu River]] with the Amazon River.

An '''astrarium''', also called a '''planetarium''', is the [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanical]] representation of the cyclic nature of [[astronomical object]]s in one timepiece. It is an [[astronomical clock]].

==History==
===Greek and Roman World===
[[Image:NAMA Machine d'Anticythère 1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The [[Antikythera mechanism]] (main fragment)]]The first astraria were mechanical devices. [[Archimedes]] is said to have used a primitive version that could predict the positions of the [[Sun]], the [[Moon]], and the [[planet]]s. On May 17, 1902, an archaeologist named [[Valerios Stais]] discovered that a lump of oxidated material, which had been recovered from a shipwreck near [[Antikythera]], held within it a mechanism with [[gear|cogwheels]]. This mechanism, known as the [[Antikythera mechanism]], was recently redated to end of the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Antikythera Mechanism Research Project |url=http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/ |website=www.antikythera-mechanism.gr |language=en |access-date=2008-03-17 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ay917M8F?url=http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/ |archive-date=2012-09-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive study of the fragments, using X-rays, has revealed enough details (gears, pinions, crank) to enable researchers to build partial replicas of the original device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Solid Models of the Antikythera Mechanism {{!}} Antikythera Mechanism Research Project |url=http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/data/models/solid-models.html |website=www.antikythera-mechanism.gr |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfr.ee.teiath.gr/historia/historia/graphics/instr/images/antik06.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206040835/http://sfr.ee.teiath.gr/historia/historia/graphics/instr/images/antik06.jpg |archivedate=2006-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ircamera.as.arizona.edu/NatSci102/text/extgreek_files/image004.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216100016/http://ircamera.as.arizona.edu/NatSci102/text/extgreek_files/image004.jpg |archivedate=2008-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Engraved on the major gears are the names of the planets, which leaves little doubt as to the intended use of the mechanism.

By the end of the [[Roman Empire]], the know-how and science behind this piece of clockwork was lost.

===Middle Ages and Renaissance===
The first modern documented astrarium clock was completed in 1364 by [[Giovanni Dondi dell'Orologio|Giovanni de' Dondi]] (1318–1388), a scholar and physician of the [[Middle Ages]] interested in astronomy and [[horology]]. The original clock, consisting of 107 wheels and [[pinion]]s, has been lost, perhaps during the sacking of Mantua in 1630, but de' Dondi left detailed descriptions which have survived, enabling a reconstruction of the clock. It displays the mean time, sidereal, (or star), time and the motions of the sun, moon and the five then-known planets [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Saturn]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], and [[Jupiter]]. It was conceived according to a [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] conception of the solar system. De' Dondi was inspired by his father [[Jacopo Dondi dell'Orologio|Jacopo]] who designed the [[astronomical clock]] in the Piazzi dei Signori, Padua, in 1344 - one of the first of its type.

In later ages more astraria were built. A famous example is the one built in 1774 by [[Eise Eisinga]] from Dronrijp, Friesland, the Netherlands. It displayed all the planets and was fixed to the ceiling in a house in [[Franeker]] where it can still be visited.

In modern times, the astrarium has grown into a tourist attraction as a commercially exploited [[planetarium]]-showing in [[IMAX]] theaters.  With such presentations as 'The history of the Universe', as well as other astronomical phenomena.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6022">'''Brownian motors''' are nano-scale or molecular devices by which thermally activated processes (chemical reactions) are controlled and used to generate directed motion in space and to do mechanical or electrical work.  These tiny engines operate in an environment where [[viscosity]] dominates [[inertia]], and where [[thermal noise]] makes moving in a specific direction as difficult as walking in a hurricane:  the forces impelling these motors in the desired direction are minuscule in comparison with the random forces exerted by the environment. Because this type of motor is so strongly dependent on random thermal noise, Brownian motors are feasible only at the nanometer scale.

The term "Brownian motor" was originally coined by Peter Hänggi in 1995: A distinct feature of a Brownian motor is—in contrast to a molecular motor—that the output response is typically coupled only loosely to the input perturbation and action of fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hänggi|first1=Peter|last2=Marchesoni|first2=Fabio|title=Artificial Brownian motors: Controlling transport on the nanoscale|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|date=30 March 2009|volume=81|issue=1|pages=387–442|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.81.387|arxiv=0807.1283|bibcode=2009RvMP...81..387H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In biology, many protein-based [[molecular motors]] in the cell may in fact be Brownian motors. These molecular motors convert the chemical energy present in [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] into mechanical energy. One example of a Brownian motor would be an ATPase motor that hydrolyzes ATP to generate fluctuating anisotropic energetic potentials. The anisotropic potentials along the path would bias the motion of a particle (like an ion or polypeptide); the result would essentially be diffusion of a particle whose net motion is strongly biased in one direction. The translocation of the particle would only be [[loose coupling|loosely coupled]] to hydrolysis of ATP.

The dynamics and activity of Brownian motors are current topics of study in theoretical and experimental [[biophysics]]. Brownian motors are sometimes modeled using the [[Fokker-Planck equation]] or with [[Monte Carlo method]]s. Many researchers are presently engaged in understanding how molecular-scale motors operate in environments with non-negligible thermal noise. The thermodynamics of such motors is constrained by the ramifications of the [[Fluctuation Theorem]]s, Pumping Quantization Theorems,&lt;ref name='chernyak-09prl'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Robust quantization of a molecular motor motion in a stochastic environment|author=V.

'''C.R. Narayan Rao'''  (15 August 1882 &amp;ndash; 2 January 1960) was an [[India]]n [[zoology|zoologist]] and [[herpetology|herpetologist]]. He was among the founding editors of the journal ''Current Science''. In recognition of his pioneering work on Indian amphibians, the genus ''[[Raorchestes]]'' was named after him.

==Background==
Born in [[Coimbatore]], he studied in [[Bellary]] and at the [[Madras Christian College]] under Professor Henderson who headed the department of zoology. After obtaining his graduate and post-graduate degrees and a gold medal for proficiency, he obtained a diploma in teaching. He taught in Coimbatore and [[Ernakulam]], before moving to the Central College in [[Bangalore]] where he organized the department of zoology and headed it until his retirement in 1937.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Current Science|author=Seshachar, B.R.|title=Obituary.

==Contributions==
His role in science and research is considered significant since he was involved in the integration of research into university education. Along with Sir [[Martin Onslow Forster]] and other Indian scientists he helped found the journal ''Current Science'' in July 1932 along the lines of the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. He was its first editor. In one of his first editorials, he pleaded for the coordination of scientific activities in India, a plea that helped create the [[Indian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name=obit /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Current Science: some early history|author=Krishnan, Riki &amp; P.

Professor Rao specialized on frogs and their taxonomy. He named and described several frog species, and his work on the Archenteric and Segmentation Cavities of frogs are regarded as important contributions to our understanding of amphibian development. He described the new [[Microhylidae|Microhylid]] genus ''[[Ramanella]]''. The genus [[Raorchestes]] is named in his honour.&lt;ref name=Biju&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Biju| first = S.

Professor Rao presided over the zoology section of the Indian Science Congress in 1938 at [[Lahore]]. His account of the ovarian ovum of the [[slender loris]] was presented to the [[Royal Society]] by [[James Peter Hill]] in the latter's [[Croonian Lecture]].&lt;ref name=obit /&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F078968-0036, Frankfurt-Main, Börse.jpg|thumb|240px|“Computer and Money” was one of the topics in ''Chippie'' ([[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]], 1988).]]

'''''Chippie''''' (''hr2-Computermagazin'') was a [[Germany|German]] [[radio program]]. It was one of the first programs on computer topics, produced by the [[Hessischer Rundfunk]] (Hessian Broadcasting).

==History==
''Chippie'' started in 1990. At first it was broadcast together with the youth magazine ''Radio unfrisiert'', who won the [[Civis media prize]] that year. Later it got its own one-hour slot. The show was hosted by Claudia Bultje and Patrick Conley. Topics on the program were, for example: "Computer in Theater, Opera and Rock Concert" (2 May 1992), "Computer and Money" (5 September 1992), "Computers and Sex" (24 October 1992) and "Data Networks" (2 July 1994).

The first computer magazine in German radio was ''[[Bit, byte, gebissen]]'' (BR, 1985). Today well-known programs are the ''Chaosradio'' (RBB) and ''Matrix'' (ORF).

The '''Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching''', also referred to as the '''Cognitive Theory of Interactive Teaching''', was developed by Allan Collins and Albert L. Stevens (Collins &amp; Stevens, 1981).  Allan Collins was a chief scientist at Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc., a research firm in Cambridge Massachusetts. He is also a specialist in the field of [[cognitive science]] and human semantic processing.  Albert L. Stevens was a senior scientist at Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. He was also director of the company's [[Artificial Intelligence]], [[Education Technology]] and Training Systems Division.  He is also a specialist in cognitive science. (Reigeluth, 1983)
The Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching according to Collins and Stevens (1981) requires the learner to construct theories and principles through dialogue, the teaching of self-questioning techniques and the teaching of [[metacognitive]] or [[self-monitoring]] skills, all with the intent of clarifying misconceptions so the theory or principle is well articulated and developed.  The essence of the cognitive theory of Inquiry teaching is that of developing students' metacognitive skills. Inquiry teaching deliberately attempts to develop these stills through instruction.

The theory is a prescriptive model rooted in the discovery tradition and cognitive sciences. It was derived form an analysis of the transcripts of teachers, described as interactive teachers, using a variety of teaching strategies. These strategies were in some way related to one of the following methodology: the inquiry method of the teaching, discovery method of teaching and Socratic method of teaching.  The transcripts studied represent a variety of topics taught by teachers across different subject areas (Reigeluth, 1983). Collins and Stevens believed that their Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching is domain independent or that it can be applied across subject areas or the curriculum.

== Historical background ==
Inquiry teaching is rooted in the didactic methodologies of the ancient Greek. According Mayer and Alexander (2011), inquiry teaching is rooted in the didactic methodology of the ancient Greek, where the teacher poses a problem and assists the student in solving that problem by asking a series of question. They have also pointed out that this method of instruction can be seen in the works of Plato and Socrates.
Bransford, Franks and Sherwood (1989), as cited by Mayer and Alexander (2011), have indicated that it was not until the 1960s that the role of teachers started to change from where the teacher provided the student with the questions as well as the answers. After the 1960s, instruction provided greater opportunity for students to engage in creating their own answers to questions posed (Mayer &amp; Alexander, 2011).

== Characteristics ==
The purpose of the Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching according to Collins (1986) is to provide learners with the opportunity to “actively engage in articulating theories and principles that are critical to deep understanding of a domain” (p.1). Collins (1986) believes that the knowledge attained will allow the learner to actively and meaningfully engage in solving problems and making predictions.  He also indicated that the knowledge acquire is not simply content knowledge. Figure 1 summarizes Collins and Stevens Theory of Inquiry Teaching.

The Cognitive Theory of Inquiry (Interactive) Teaching according to the Reigeluth (1983) consists of three parts: 
# The teachers goals
# The teaching strategies employed by teachers
# The controlling structures used to govern their teaching.

There are two main goals teachers using the inquiry method seek to achieve, according to Collin and Stevens (1981): 
# The teaching of a particular rule or theory
# Teaching students how to derive the rule or theory.

These two main goals are associated with several sub-goals. The list below identifies the two main goals and their associated sub-goal as posited by Collins and Stevens (1981):
#The teaching of a particular rule or theory
#* Analyzing and addressing misconceptions of students hypotheses
#* Students are taught how to make prediction in new situations
#Teaching students how to derive the rule or theory
#* Students are taught what questions to ask
#* Students are taught the nature of the theory or rule
#* Students are taught how to test the rule or theory
#* Student are taught how to articulate and defend the rule or theory

== Teaching strategies employed by teachers ==
Collins and Stevens (1981) have highlighted ten teaching strategies used by teachers using inquiry teaching. They believed that these ten teaching strategies, listed below, are the most important ones identified in their investigation. These ten teaching strategies identified by Collin and Stevens (1981, p. 18) are:
#Selecting positive and negative exemplars
#Varying cases systematically
#Selecting counterexamples 
#Generating hypothetical cases 
#Forming hypotheses 
#Testing hypotheses 
#Considering alternative predictions 
#Entrapping students 
#Tracing consequences to a contradiction 
#Questioning authority
 
== Controlling structures used to govern their teaching ==
Colling and Stevens (1981) indicated that the time allocated between the teachers' goals and sub-goals is critical to the effectiveness of inquiry teaching. Collins and Stevens (1977), as cited by Collins and Stevens (1981) had made an attempt at developing a theory of controlling structures after getting feedback from several tutors. This controlling structure theory consisted of four parts. The four parts this theory includes the following: 
#"a set of strategies for selecting cases with respect to the main goals,
#a student model,
#an agenda,
#a set of priority rules for adding goals and sub-goals to the agenda." (p. 47)
Collins and Stevens (1981) have suggested that base on the goals of the teacher, cases are selected to ensure that student develop mastery of the principles or theories being taught. They have also indicated that teachers appear to develop some strategies for selecting cases to develop students' mastery of the principles or theories. These are some of the strategies used by teachers for selecting cases as mentioned by Collins and Stevens (1981):
#cases that demonstrated the more important factors were selected before those that have less important factors
#the cases selected were sequenced from concrete factors to abstract factors
#the selection of cases dependent on their importance and frequency: more important or frequent to less important and less frequent
According to Collins and Stevens the controlling structure used to govern the dialogue in the Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching is demonstrated in the following manner:
#A case is chosen, which is a theory or principle, based on the main goal of the teacher. The teacher then questions students to determine their understanding of the theory. Students' answers reveal their understanding or lack of understanding. Next, the teacher tags the theory or principle based what students know, their error and what they do not know. Collins and Stevens referred to this as the students' model.
#Armed with the students' model, the teacher can then add information to facilitate and improve students understanding of what is known. This is determined by the level of sophistication of students' answers.
#Sub-goals are developed to diagnose and address students' errors and misconceptions.
#An agenda is developed prioritizing how students' errors and misconception well be address using the sub-goals developed.
Collins and Stevens (1977), as cited in Collins and Stevens (1981), have identified how priorities have been set by teachers. Priorities have been set based on the following:
#"Errors before omissions.
#Prior steps before later steps.
#Shorter fixes before longer fixes.
#More important factors before less important factors" (p. 49)
Criticism of the Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching
Reigeluth (1983) has put forward the following criticisms about Cognitive Theory of Inquiry:
#He believes that the theory is not suitable for all kinds of content as proposed by Collins and Stevens (1981), who believed that the theory is domain independent and that it can be used to facilitate the development of rules and theories needed for deep understand of the domain. The theory, as he indicated, is more applicable to instruction involving the construction or understanding of rules, principles and theories. The theory may not be suitable for the teaching of facts or concept.
#He believes that the theory is not self-sufficient, in that it requires the use of other forms of instruction to facilitate the development students background information, which is critical to the discovery process proposed by Collins and Stevens (1981)
#The theory may not be efficient in specific rules and principle, particularly those involving algorithms, where an expository approach may be more efficient.

== Conclusion ==
The Collins and Stevens Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching, despite the short coming identified by Reigeluth (1983), provides some strategies for teaching high-order thinking skills. Reigeluth (1983) also points out that the Collins and Stevens Cognitive Theory of Teaching provides some strategies for instruction that other theories have overlooked. Strategies such as considering alternative prediction, entrapping students, tracing consequences to a contradiction and questioning authority are invaluable skill in critical thinking. 
The focus of education today is to develop learners who are independent critical thinkers. There was once the belief that critical thinking skills could not be taught and that these skills develop naturally independent of instruction. The Collins and Stevens Cognitive Theory of Inquiry of Teaching indicate that learners can be taught strategies to develop and apply critical thinking skills.
Dewey (1938), as cited by McGregor (2007), pointed out that if students are provided with factual information without the cognitive skills that would enable them to understand, appreciate, transfer and connect ideas, the information gained would become meaningless in the future. It implies therefore, that instruction should seek to nurture the development of critical thinking skill.
Dewey (1910) as cited by McGregor (2007), has also indicated that there is a connection between thinking and learning. He posited that "thoughts involved in developing ideas and understandings are often assumed and implicated. To develop thoughtful learning these processes need to be more explicit and connected to the processes of coming to know and understand" (p. 47).

'''Criminal investigation''' is an [[applied science]] that involves the study of facts, used to identify, locate and prove the [[guilt (law)|guilt]] of an accused criminal. A complete criminal investigation can include [[Search and seizure|searching]], [[interview]]s, [[interrogation]]s, [[Evidence (law)|evidence]] collection and preservation and various methods of investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Fundamentals of Criminal Investigation (Sixth Edition). Charles E. O'Hara and Gregory L. O'Hara; 1994; {{ISBN|0-398-05889-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern-day criminal investigations commonly employ many modern scientific techniques known collectively as [[forensic science]].

Criminal investigation is an ancient science that may have roots as far back as c. 1700 BCE in the writings of the [[Code of Hammurabi]]. In the code it is suggested that both the accuser and the accused had the right to present evidence they collected.&lt;ref&gt;Victimology:Theories and Applications, Ann Wolbert Burgess, Albert R. Roberts, Cheryl Regehr,Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning, 2009, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern era criminal investigations are most often done by government [[Police|police forces]]. [[Private investigator]]s are also commonly hired to complete or assist in criminal investigations.

An early recorded professional criminal investigator was the English [[constable]]. Around 1250 CE it was recorded that the constable was to "...record...matters of fact, not matters of judgment and law."&lt;ref&gt;Henry of Bratton (1968). Bracton On the Laws and Customs of England; volume 4 pg 136. Cambridge, MS: Belknap Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation priority bias problems and proposed solutions ==
After observing recent changes in the demographic composition of particular crimes during higher priority of their investigation, such as the increase of the percentage of women convicted for joining and fighting for [[terrorism|terrorist]] organizations from a very low percentage (similar to those of murder and rape) to almost as many women as men (women in the 40-50 percent range in some jurisdictions) as the priority of investigating terror crimes increased, certain criminologists are expressing the notion that there may be more crimes that would change their demographics if they got higher priority. These criminologists theorize that in the case of limited budgets, criminal investigators rely on profiled and statistical likelihood of particular groups of people being convicted for the type of crimes that are being investigated, and ignore complaints that are filed about people that they consider less likely to commit the crimes or give the tracking or individual matching to the evidence lower priority. According to the hypotheses, even a minimal or nonexistent difference in the likelihood of committing crimes can be hidden behind a difference of a factor by many multiples in the likelihood of being convicted due to [[self-fulfilling prophecy|self-fulfilling prophecies]] in the statistics. These criminologists feel that criminals who are not getting caught due to being profiled as unlikely offenders are a major problem. Some of these criminologists propose an increased number of police officers. Others argue that investigations of the evidence are more expensive than police patrols and that not all crimes can be investigated, suggesting that profiling of [[criminal psychology]] should be replaced with randomized priorities of individual suspects within similar types of crime. The latter criminologists also argue that such randomization would not only fight hidden crimes by exposing the currently unsuspected criminals to the risk of being punished, but also that the abolition of profiling by forensic psychology and forensic psychiatry would be a monetary saving that could be used for investigation of technical evidence, tracking of criminals who are hiding and other investigation work that can reduce the need to ignore complaints for budget reasons.&lt;ref&gt;"Morality, Rationality and Efficiency: New Perspectives on Socio-economics", 2016 by Richard M.

{{Governance}}
'''Earth system governance''' is a recently developed [[Paradigm shift|paradigm]] that builds on earlier notions of [[environmental policy]] and [[Environmental protection|nature conservation]], but puts these into the broader context of human-induced transformations of the entire [[earth system science|earth system]]. It conceptualizes the system of formal and informal rules, rule-making mechanisms and actor-networks at all levels of human society (from local to global) that are set up to steer societies towards preventing, mitigating, and adapting to global and local environmental change and earth system transformation, within the normative context of [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;Biermann, Frank, Michele M. Betsill, Joyeeta Gupta, Norichika Kanie, Louis Lebel, Diana Liverman, Heike Schroeder, and Bernd Siebenhüner, with contributions from Ken Conca, Leila da Costa Ferreira, Bharat Desai, Simon Tay, and Ruben Zondervan. 2009. ''[http://earthsystemgovernance.org/publication/biermann-frank--earth-system-governance-science-plan Earth System Governance: People, Places and the Planet. Science and Implementation Plan of the Earth System Governance Project]''. Earth System Governance Report 1, IHDP Report 20. Bonn, IHDP: The Earth System Governance Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
The notion of governance refers to forms of steering that are less hierarchical than traditional governmental policy-making (even though most modern governance arrangements will also include some degree of hierarchy), rather decentralized, open to self-organization, and inclusive of non-state actors that range from industry and non-governmental organizations to scientists, indigenous communities, city governments and international organizations.

The integrative new paradigm of earth system governance has evolved into an active research area that brings together a variety of social science disciplines including political science, sociology, economics, ecology, policy studies, geography, [[sustainability science]], and law.

==Conferences==
Major international conferences on ‘Earth System Governance’ have been held in Amsterdam (2007, 2009), Berlin (2008, 2010), Colorado (2011), Lund (2012, 2017), Tokyo (2013), Norwich (2014), Canberra (2015) and Nairobi (2016). In 2017, the 8th Annual Earth System Governance Conference took place in Lund, Sweden. This conference was co-hosted by Lund University during its 350 year celebration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthsystemgovernance.net/lund2017/ 2017 Lund Conference on Earth System Governance]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 it is due to be held in Utrecht, The Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.earthsystemgovernance.org/events/2018-utrecht-conference-on-earth-system-governance/|title=2018 Utrecht Conference on Earth System Governance|website=www.earthsystemgovernance.org|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Policy engagement ==
On 16–19 May 2011, more than twenty Nobel Laureates, several leading policy-makers and some of the world’s most renowned thinkers and experts on global sustainability met for the Third Nobel Laureate Symposium on Global Sustainability&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2011/05/18/at-stockholm-gathering-of-minds-planet-earth-vs-humanity/ Third Nobel Laureate Symposium on Global Sustainability]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in Stockholm. The Nobel Laureate Symposium concluded with the [[Stockholm Memorandum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalsymposium2011.org/news-and-media/memorandum Stockholm Memorandum: Tipping the Scales towards Sustainability]&lt;/ref&gt; calling for "strengthening of Earth System Governance" as a priority for coherent global action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sei-international.org/mediamanager/documents/News/Press-releases/TheStockholmMemorandum.pdf The Stockholm Memorandum]&lt;/ref&gt; This memorandum has been submitted to the High-level Panel on Global Sustainability appointed by the UN Secretary General and fed into the preparations for the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development]] (Rio+20).

== History ==
The new paradigm of earth system governance was originally developed in the Netherlands by Professor [http://www.earthsystemgovernance.org/people/person/frank-biermann Frank Biermann] in his inaugural lecture at the VU University Amsterdam, which was published later in 2007&lt;ref&gt;Frank Biermann. 2007. [http://www.glogov.org/images/doc/Glogov.orgWorkingPaper19EarthSystemGovernance.pdf ‘Earth system governance’ as a crosscutting theme of global change research]. Global Environmental Change. Volume 17, Issues 3-4, August–October 2007, pp. 326-337.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this pioneering contribution, Biermann was invited by the [[International Human Dimensions Programme|International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change]] to develop a long-term comprehensive international programme in this field, which became in 2009 the global [[Earth System Governance Project]].

Key researchers who have applied the earth system governance framework in their work include [http://www.colostate.edu/academics/michele-betsill.aspx Michele Betsill], [[John Dryzek]], [[Peter M. Haas]], [http://unu.edu/faculty/norichika-kanie Norichika Kanie], [http://www.lucsus.lu.se/html/lennart_olsson.aspx Lennart Olsson], and [http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/people/Faculty/oran_young.htm Oran Young]. In 2011, Lund University appointed Biermann as guest professor of Earth System Governance, making him the worldwide first chair holder in this rapidly developing field of research.

== The Earth System Governance Project ==
{{Main|Earth System Governance Project}}
In 2009, the UN-sponsored global change research networks have set up a long-term research programme in earth system governance, the [[Earth System Governance Project]].
The Earth System Governance Project currently consists of a network of ca. 300 active and about 2,300 indirectly involved scholars from all continents, and is the largest social science research network in the area of governance and global environmental change. The Earth System Governance Project is essentially a scientific effort, but also aims to assist policy responses to the pressing problems of global environmental change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebrokeronline.eu/Articles/Managing-global-change/Earth-System-Governance-Project/] The Broker Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.cri.cn/6966/2011/05/19/1461s638279.htm Nobel Laureates Hand in Recommendations to UN Panel on Global Sustainability]&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://earthsystemgovernance.org/ipo International Project Office] of the Earth System Governance Project is based at Lund University, Sweden.

Research centres on ‘Earth System Governance’ have been set up or designated at [[VU University Amsterdam]]; the [[Australian National University]]; [[Chiang Mai University]]; [[Colorado State University]]; [[Lund University]]; [[University of East Anglia]]; [[University of Oldenburg]]; the [[Stockholm Resilience Centre]]; the [[University of Toronto]]; the [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]] and [[Yale University]]. In addition, strong networks on earth system governance research exist in China, Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, and Russia.

'''Error level analysis''' is the analysis of [[compression artifacts]] in digital data with [[lossy compression]] such as [[JPEG]].

== Principles ==
When used, lossy compression is normally applied uniformly to a set of data, such as an image, resulting in a uniform level of compression artifacts.

Alternatively, the data may [[Digital compositing|consist of parts]] with different levels of compression artifacts. This difference may arise from the different parts having been repeatedly subjected to the same lossy compression a different number of times, or the different parts having been subjected to different kinds of lossy compression. A difference in the level of compression artifacts in different parts of the data may therefore indicate that the data has been edited.

In the case of JPEG, even a composite with parts subjected to matching compressions will have a difference in the compression artifacts.&lt;ref name=WangDonTan&gt;{{cite conference

| location   = Seoul, Korea
| quote = We are hardly able to tell the tampered region from the unchanged one sometimes just by human visual perception of JPEG compression noise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to make the typically faint compression artifacts more readily visible, the data to be analyzed is subjected to an additional round of lossy compression, this time at a known, uniform level, and the result is subtracted from the original data under investigation. The resulting difference image is then inspected manually for any variation in the level of compression artifacts. In 2007, N. Krawetz denoted this method "error level analysis".&lt;ref name=WangDonTan/&gt;

Additionally, digital data formats such as JPEG sometimes include [[metadata]] describing the specific lossy compression used. If in such data the observed compression artifacts differ from those expected from the given metadata description, then the metadata may not describe the actual compressed data, and thus indicate that the data have been edited.

File:Felis silvestris silvestris small gradual decrease of quality - difference image.png|The difference between the two images shows a variation of the JPEG compression artifacts
&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Limitations ==

By its nature, data without [[lossy compression]], such as a [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG image]], cannot be subjected to error level analysis. Consequently, since editing could have been performed on data without lossy compression with lossy compression applied uniformly to the edited, composite data, the presence of a uniform level of compression artifacts does not rule out editing of the data.

Additionally, any non-uniform compression artifacts in a composite may be removed by subjecting the composite to repeated, uniform lossy compression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://fotoforensics.com/tutorial-ela.php |website= fotoforensics.com |title= FotoForensics |accessdate= 2015-09-20 |quote= If an image is resaved multiple times, then it may be entirely at a minimum error level, where more resaves do not alter the image. In this case, the ELA will return a black image and no modifications can be identified using this algorithm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, if the image color space is reduced to 256 colors or less, for example, by conversion to [[GIF]], then error level analysis will generate useless results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://fotoforensics.com/faq.php#What%20can%20I%20upload%20for%20analysis |title= FotoForensics - FAQ |website= fotoforensics.com |accessdate= 2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More significant, the actual interpretation of the level of compression artifacts in a given segment of the data is subjective, and the determination of whether editing has occurred is therefore not robust.&lt;ref name=WangDonTan/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Controversy ==

In May 2013, Dr [[Neal Krawetz]] used error level analysis on the 2012 [[World Press Photo of the Year]] and concluded on his [[Hacker Factor]] blog that it was "a composite" with modifications that "fail to adhere to the acceptable journalism standards used by [[Reuters]], [[Associated Press]], [[Getty Images]], [[National Press Photographer's Association]], and other media outlets". The [[World Press Photo]] organizers responded by letting two independent experts analyze the image files of the winning photographer and subsequently confirmed the integrity of the files. One of the experts, 
[[Hany Farid]], said about error level analysis that "It incorrectly labels altered images as original and incorrectly labels original images as altered with the same likelihood". Krawetz responded by clarifying that "It is up to the user to interpret the results. Any errors in identification rest solely on the viewer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-05/16/photo-faking-controversy |title= 'Fake' World Press Photo isn't fake, is lesson in need for forensic restraint |first= Ian |last= Steadman |website= [[Wired UK]] |date= 2013-05-16 |accessdate= 2015-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, the [[citizen journalism]] team [[Bellingcat]] wrote that error level analysis revealed that the [[Russian Ministry of Defense]] had edited satellite images related to the [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2015/05/31/mh17-forensic-analysis-of-satellite-images-released-by-the-russian-ministry-of-defence/ |website= bellingcat.com |title= bellingcat -   MH17 - Forensic Analysis of Satellite Images Released by the Russian Ministry of Defence |date= 2015-05-31 |accessdate= 2015-09-29 |quote= Error level analysis of the images also reveal the images have been edited}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a reaction to this, image forensics expert [[Jens Kriese]] said about error level analysis: "The method is subjective and not based entirely on science", and that it is "a method used by hobbyists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/expert-criticizes-allegations-of-russian-mh17-manipulation-a-1037125.html |work= [[Spiegel Online]] |first= Benjamin |last= Bidder |title= 'Bellingcat Report Doesn't Prove Anything': Expert Criticizes Allegations of Russian MH17 Manipulation |date= 2015-06-04 |accessdate= 2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his Hacker Factor Blog, the inventor of error level analysis Neal Krawetz criticized both Bellingcat's use of error level analysis as "misinterpreting the results" but also on several points Jens Kriese's "ignorance" regarding error level analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/categories/1-Image-Analysis |title= Image Analysis  - The Hacker Factor Blog |website= hackerfactor.com |accessdate= 2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[baking]], a '''farinograph''' measures specific properties of [[flour]]. It was first developed and launched in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brabender History|url=http://www.brabender.com/english/food/company/history.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627024838/http://www.brabender.com/english/food/company/history.html|archivedate=27 June 2012|deadurl=yes|publisher=Brabender}}&lt;/ref&gt; The farinograph is a tool used for measuring the [[shear (fluid)|shear]] and [[viscosity]] of a mixture of [[dough|flour and water]]. The primary units of the farinograph are Brabender Units, an [[arbitrary unit]] of measuring the viscosity of a fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6IO3eV7KfDIC&amp;pg=PA374&amp;lpg=PA374&amp;dq=brabender+unit&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I9trYG4Fla&amp;sig=PJYZMHvkdpMKMRmsc6V7MNUCLUk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1ionSo-tII-Ntgf2tfXeBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7#PPA374,M1|title=Starch in Food: Structure, Function and Applications|first=Ann-Charlotte|last=Eliasson|page=244|via=Google Books|date=20 September 2004|accessdate=26 July 2017|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780849325557}}&lt;/ref&gt; The farinograph is a variation of the [[Brabender Plastograph]] that has been specialized for the baking industry, and it is used around the world for the objective measurement of a variety of flours.

A baker can formulate end products by using the farinograph's results to determine the following:{{cn|date=November 2014}}
*Water absorption
*Dough viscosity, including peak water to [[gluten]] ratio prior to gluten breakdown
*Peak mixing time to arrive at desired water/gluten ratio
*The stability of flour under mixing
*The tolerance of a flour's gluten

==Method==
The farinograph is drawn on a curved graph with the vertical axis labeled in Brabender Units (BU) and the horizontal axis labeled as time in minutes. The graph is generally hockey-stick shaped, with the curve being more or less acute depending on the strength of the gluten in the flour.
[[File:Farinograph2.jpg|right|frame|The graph is from a gluten rich bread flour, as its stability time is relatively long and the MTI is still above the 500 BU line. A weaker flour, such as a cake or pastry flour with a much lower gluten content would have a much steeper decline after peak time.]]

The points of interest on the graph are fivefold:
#Arrival Time (Absorption) - Absorption is the point chosen by the baking industry which represents a target water to flour ratio in [[bread]]. This ratio is marked at the 500 BU line and is taken as a [[rule of thumb]] for desired taste, texture, and dough performance during [[Proofing (baking technique)|proofing]] and baking. All other measurements are based on this 500 BU standard. (For comparison, the accepted BU is 1000 or greater for [[noodles]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/ggpages/gopher/Quality/PNW/aboutpnw.prn|title=About PNW Regional Quality Data|first=Bob|last=Graybosch|date=January 1996|website=wheat.pw.usda.gov|accessdate=26 July 2017|publisher=Grain Genes, U.S. Department of Agriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus on the graph above, Arrival time is the point on the graph where the top of the curve reaches the 500 BU point and indicates the rate of absorption (minutes/BU).
#Peak time - Peak time is reached at the highest point on the curve, and indicates when the dough has reached is maximum viscosity before gluten strands begin to break down.
#Mixing Tolerance Index (MTI) - MTI is found by taking the difference in BU between the peak time point (on the graph above 3 minutes, 30 seconds) and 5 minutes after peak time is reached. This is used by bakers to determine the amount that a dough will soften over a period of mixing. MTI may be expressed as a value in BU or as a percentage of BU lost over time (&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{BU^n-BU^{n-x}}{BU^n}&lt;/math&gt;).
#Departure Time - Departure time is defined as the point at which the top of the curve goes below the 500 BU line. This point is generally considered the point at which gluten is breaking down and dough has become over mixed.
#Stability - Stability is the point between arrival time and departure time and generally indicates the strength of a flour (how much gluten a flour has and how strong it is).

==Applications==
The Farinograph is used worldwide by bakers and food technicians in building bakery formulations. The farinograph gives bakers a good snapshot of the flour's properties and how the flour will react in different stages of baking, which helps them pick a certain flour for any given purpose. Millers use the Brabender Farinograph to access the properties of the flour, to ascertain whether changes need to be made in the mill. The miller also uses the farinograph to prepare dough for further testing for extensibility after a resting period (akin to proofing) with the Brabender Extensograph.

The industrial application of these five points is far reaching. A baker may use, for example, the arrival time as a bare minimum time when planning full product floor time for a batch of dough. A baker may also use MTI as guideline to judge the response of a dough to the addition of other ingredients. Peak time may be used as a target mix time for optimal gluten structure and resilience. Stability may be used as a method of determining desired cell structure before irreparable gluten breakdown occurs.

Professor '''Johannes Frederik Johnstrup''' (12 March 1818, in [[Christianshavn]], [[Denmark]] &amp;ndash; 31 December 1894) was a [[Danish people|Danish]] [[Geology|geologist]] and [[Paleontology|paleontologist]]. He was the founder of [[Meddelelser om Grønland]].&lt;ref name="Notes "&gt;{{cite journal|last=Noe-Nygaard|first=A. |author2=C. Vibe |author3=[[Tyge W. Böcher|T. W.

Johnstrup received his Bachelor of Science in 1844.  He became an associate professor of [[mineralogy]] and [[natural science]] at the [[Sorø Academy]] in 1846. When the academy closed in 1848, he became assistant lecturer in [[Kolding]].  Three years later, he taught in [[Sorø]] and in 1866, he became professor of mineralogy and geology at the [[University of Copenhagen]] and the [[Technical University of Denmark|Polytechnic Institution]].

In 1876, he led an expedition to [[Iceland]] to study [[Askja]] and the volcanoes at [[Mývatn]] with [[Þorvaldur Thoroddsen]] as his guide.&lt;ref&gt;Hintze, V. ''[http://runeberg.org/dbl/6/0323.html Thoroddsen, Thorvaldur] entry in [[Carl Frederik Bricka|C. F.

In 1878, with Heinrich Rink, Johnstrup founded the governmental institution, [[Commission for Scientific Investigations in Greenland|Commission for the Direction of Geological and Geographical Investigations in Greenland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bravo|first=Michael|author2=Sverker Sörlin|title=Narrating the Arctic: a cultural history of Nordic scientific practices|publisher=Science History Publications|date=2002 |pages=238|isbn=0-88135-385-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wjlteumklQC&amp;pg=PA238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later, he led the Danish Geological Survey. He developed Denmark's Mineralogical Museum, and led the construction of a new building in 1893.

Johnstrup authored a number of treatises by which he greatly promoted the understanding of Denmark's geological conditions, particularly the glacial phenomena. In 1894, he became an honorary doctorate at the University.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1615">In [[sociology|sociological]] research, '''functional prerequisites''' are the [[basic needs]] ([[food]], [[wikt:shelter|shelter]], [[clothing]], and [[money]]) that an individual requires to live above the [[poverty line]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Talcott Parsons]], [[Bryan S. Turner (sociologist)|Bryan S. Turner]].  ''The Social System''  page 26-27.  Routledge &amp; Keagan Paul Ltd. 1951&lt;/ref&gt; Functional prerequisites may also refer to the factors that allow a [[society]] to maintain [[social order]].

On the other hand, Parsons argued any successful social system has four functional prerequisites:
* Adaptation
* Goal attainment
* Integration
* Pattern maintenance

Adaptation – To survive, any society needs the basics of food and shelter. Having these gives any society control over its environment. A society needs a functioning economy to provide this.

Goal attainment – all societies must provide collective goals of some sort for its members to aspire to. Governments set goals such as New Labour setting a target of 50% of school graduates to attend university. To facilitate meeting such goals, governments provide resources, laws, and other institutional mechanisms.

Integration – all societies need a legal system that mediates conflict and protects the social system from breaking down.

Pattern maintenance – Institutions like education and the family reaffirm essential values needed for society to function. (For Parsons the key institution in passing on such basic values is religion.)

'''Huchra's lens''' is the lensing galaxy of the [[Einstein Cross]] (''[[Quasar]] 2237+30''); it is also called ''ZW 2237+030'' or ''QSO 2237+0305 G''.  It exhibits the phenomenon of [[gravitational lensing]] that was postulated by [[Albert Einstein]] when he realized that [[gravity]] would be able to bend [[light]] and thus could have lens-like effects. The galaxy is named for [[astronomer]] [[John Huchra]].&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Overbye|first=Dennis|title=John Huchra Dies at 61; Maps Altered Ideas on Universe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/14/us/14huchra.html|accessdate=5 January 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Info Exame''''' (or simply ''Info'', stylized as ''INFO'') was a high-popular Brazilian technology magazine. Its name was ''Exame Informática'' initially, a reference to its creation as the technology supplement for ''[[Exame (magazine)|Exame]]'', a business magazine. It was popular with technology non-experts because of its simple-language approach to IT-related topics. The headquarters was in Sao Paulo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brazil Export-Import, Trade and Business Directory Volume 1 Strategic Information and Contacts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ebDZDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA220|accessdate=3 December 2016|date=27 January 2016|publisher=IBP, Inc. Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-329-81313-7|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the magazine, the INFO brand was a reference in digital tendencies, sciences, culture and entrepreneurism. It is the inspiration for those who want to understand – in an instigating and good-humored way – the impact innovations have on our lives and our business.

The magazine ceased its publication in August 2015, becoming again a supplement in the ''Exame'' magazine. Its website now redirects to Exame website technology section. 

==Main Topics==
*'''Enter''': Opening section of the magazine that combines notes, short interviews, curiosities and in vogue services on the Internet, while also presenting innovative profiles and people.;
**''Ideias'': A section opinions from our three renowned columnists. Besides them, every month INFO magazine brings a special guest to be part of this section.;
**''Inovação'': The section that presents the magazine’s biggest stories, with reports on the most-varied subjects, such as entrepreneurism, behavior, tendencies in digital culture and new technologies.;
**''Tests'': Section dedicated to products tested by INFOlab. With a technical evaluation of its operation, the magazine evaluates and scores products in relation to cost / benefit. From smartphones to ultrabooks, and including refrigerators, TV, sound and even bicycles and soccer boots.;
**''Ctrl+Z'': The magazine closes by going back in time, showing cool products published in INFO. CTRL-Z takes the reader back to a remarkable past.;

==INFOlab==
Is a special magazine's team destined to test the last-generation products bought by the magazine before their market release.
===Grade System===
It is a system used by the laboratory's team to classify the products reviewed. This grade system was announced in 2002 and it was the official grade system until the end of the magazine:
*"IMPECCABLE" (10): it's the highest level possible, but it has never been reached by any product in the magazine's history;
*"Excellent" (9 - 9.9);
*"Very Good" (8 - 8.9);
*"Good" (7 - 7.9);
*"Intermediate" (6 - 6.9);
*"Regular" (5 - 5.9);
*"Weak" (4 - 4.9);
*"Very Weak" (3 - 3.9);
*"Terrible" (2 - 2.9);
*"Bomb" (1 - 1.9);
*"JUNK" (0): it's the worst level that any product can reach. Fortunately, this level has never been reached before.
===Yearly Review===
On December of every year the magazine makes a special edition with 30 pages or more only with reviews about the products that will be released in the following year.
===Historical Products===
Here is a list of the worldly best-selling products that passed through ''Info Laboratory'' before getting huge fame:
*'''[[Palm III]]''': the first palmtop to sell more than 3 million of units, it was fifth creation from [[Palm, Inc]];
*'''[[iMac]]''': the most powerful and well-succeeded computer's line from [[Apple Inc]];
*'''[[Treo 600]]''': it was the first generation of the ''Treo'' smartphone's line. It was created by "Palm, Inc";
*'''[[BlackBerry]]''': the most popular smartphone in the world got a good general review (7.5/10), but failed in the graphics review (4/10) because of his low-resolution; 
*'''[[iPod]]''': it was the first generation of the iPod's Classic Line, with only 5GB;
*'''[[iPod Touch]]''': the iPod's last generation reached third best review of the magazine ("VERY GOOD") in the general review (8.5/10);
*'''[[iPhone]]''': Apple's mobile-phone reached the same level ("VERY GOOD") of its "iPod brother", the ''iPod Touch'', with the grade 8/10.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12348">The '''International Society for Forensic Genetics - ISFG''' is an international non-profit scientific society founded in 1968. The main goal of the society is to advance the field of forensic genetics, also termed [[DNA profiling]], through dissemination of scientific results and opinions, communication amongst scientists and education. The bi-annual international ISFG congresses, international workshops and seminars, the society’s scientific journal (''[[Forensic Science International: Genetics]]''), and the scientific recommendations on current topics all work towards this goal.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, John M. (2012) "Advanced Topics in Forensic DNA Typing: Methodology", Elsevier Academic Press: San Diego. p. 168 (Print {{ISBN|9780123745132}}, Electronic {{ISBN|9780123878236}})&lt;/ref&gt; The society’s website contains up to date information on all activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ISFG - isfg.org |url=https://www.isfg.org |website=www.isfg.org |accessdate=September 11, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The International Society for Forensic Genetics - ISFG – was founded in 1968 in [[Mainz]], Germany, under the name ''Gesellschaft für forensische Blutgruppenkunde'' (Society for Forensic Haemogenetics). The society was founded as a [[non-profit organisation]] according to German civil law. The original aim of the society was to promote the science of genetic markers in human blood for use in [[forensic science]]. In 1989, the society was transformed to an international society (‘International Society for Forensic Haemogenetics - ISFH’). In 1991, based on the transition from traditional serological markers in blood to universal DNA polymorphisms the name was changed into ‘International Society for Forensic Genetics’. Currently the ISFG strives to support all research interests in forensic genetics, also including non-human DNA studies, RNA-based test systems, and large-scale [[Sequencing#DNA sequencing|sequencing]] technologies.&lt;ref name="Morling, Niels 2013 pp. 365-368"&gt;Morling, Niels (2013) History of the International Society for Forensic Genetics - ISFG. Chapter in Siegel, J.A. &amp; Saukko, P.J. (editors) Encyclopedia of Forensic Sciences, Second Edition. Elsevier Academic Press: San Diego. pp. 365-368 (Print {{ISBN|9780123821652}}, Electronic {{ISBN|9780123821669}})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership and activities ==
=== Membership ===
In May 2015, the ISFG had approximately 1,200 individual members from more than 50 countries. The members are typically in academic institutions, criminal justice and police organizations, as well as private companies. The members’ fields of expertise include [[forensic biology]], [[molecular genetics]], [[population genetics]], [[blood group]] serology, [[forensic pathology]], [[parentage testing]], [[biostatistics]], [[criminal law]], [[medical ethics]].

=== International ISFG congresses ===
The ISFG organises biennial international congresses, with educational workshops preceding the congress. This is achieved with the help of local forensic institutes or universities that will form a local organizing committee and host the congress under the joint leadership of the ISFG board and the local congress president. From 1985-2005, conference volumes with short articles based on these presentations were originally published as books under the title ''Advances in Forensic Haemogenetics'' and later as ''Progress in Forensic Genetics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ISFG - Publications/Congress Proceedings |url=http://www.isfg.org/Publications/Congress+Proceedings |website=www.isfg.org |accessdate=September 11, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, the proceedings have been published electronically as part of the ''Forensic Science International: Genetics Supplement Series'' and can be accessed online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Forensic Science International: Genetics Supplement Series |url=http://www.fsigeneticssup.com |website=www.fsigeneticssup.com |accessdate=September 11, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Past ISFG meetings have been held mainly in Europe but also in cities on other continents such as New Orleans and San Francisco in the US, Buenos Aires in Argentina, and Melbourne, Australia. The ISFG meetings often serve as a focal point for a dialogue of relevant scientific issues, as in the 2007 [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)]] panel discussion,&lt;ref name="ButlerBudowle2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butler|first1=J.M.|last2=Budowle|first2=B.|last3=Gill|first3=P.|last4=Kidd|first4=K.K.|last5=Phillips|first5=C.|last6=Schneider|first6=P.M.|last7=Vallone|first7=P.M.|last8=Morling|first8=N.|title=Report on ISFG SNP Panel Discussion|journal=Forensic Science International: Genetics Supplement Series|volume=1|issue=1|year=2008|pages=471–472|issn=1875-1768|doi=10.1016/j.fsigss.2007.10.159}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the debate on the limits of low template DNA in forensic genetics.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, John M. (2014) "Advanced Topics in Forensic DNA Typing: Interpretation", Elsevier Academic Press: San Diego. (Print {{ISBN|9780124052130}}, Electronic {{ISBN|9780124058545}}), p. 318-319.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The DNA Commission ===
The DNA Commission of the ISFG functions as an international DNA expert advisory group and is formed based on emerging needs when dealing with new DNA technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, John M. (2013) Forensic DNA advisory groups: DAB, SWGDAM, ENFSI, and BSAG. Chapter in Siegel, J.A. &amp; Saukko, P.J. (editors) Encyclopedia of Forensic Sciences, Second Edition. Elsevier Academic Press: San Diego. pp. 339-343 (Print {{ISBN|9780123821652}}, Electronic {{ISBN|9780123821669}})&lt;/ref&gt; For each topic the ISFG board will invite scientists with specific expertise and form a commission to discuss open issues and formulate recommendations that provide guidance to forensic geneticists. While not binding, these recommendations are a first step to establishing standards for new genetic typing methods. Topics have included best practices for paternity and relationship testing. ISFG recommendations are a valuable tool for forensic geneticists and as such are highly cited by other scientists.&lt;ref&gt;King, C. (2011) For high impact forensics, the clues point to Europe. Science Watch Featured Analyses July August. http://archive.sciencewatch.com/ana/fea/11julaugFea/ Retrieved July 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the implementation of [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) based short tandem repeat (STR) DNA testing, the ISFG was instrumental in the standardization of allele designations,&lt;ref name="Schneider2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schneider|first1=Peter M.|title=Scientific standards for studies in forensic genetics|journal=Forensic Science International|volume=165|issue=2-3|year=2007|pages=238–243|issn=0379-0738|doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2006.06.067}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was a key component in inter-laboratory data comparability and the creation of [[DNA database|national DNA databases]].&lt;ref&gt;Butler, John M. (2012) "Advanced Topics in Forensic DNA Typing: Methodology", Elsevier Academic Press: San Diego. p. 123-126 (Print {{ISBN|9780123745132}}, Electronic {{ISBN|9780123878236}})&lt;/ref&gt; DNA commission topics also have included best practices for paternity and relationship testing now integrated into forensic genetics textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, John M. (2014) "Advanced Topics in Forensic DNA Typing: Interpretation" Elsevier Academic Press: San Diego. (Print {{ISBN|9780124052130}}, Electronic {{ISBN|9780124058545}}), p. 364-366.&lt;/ref&gt; All published recommendations of the DNA and the Paternity Testing Commissions can be accessed openly on the [http://www.isfg.org/Publications ISFG website].

=== Language-based working parties ===
The ISFG has language-based working groups for Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Korean and Spanish-Portuguese members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ISFG - Working Groups |url=http://www.isfg.org/Working%20Groups |website=www.isfg.org |accessdate=September 11, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They meet regularly and typically work on topics of regional or national interest. The English Speaking Working Group (ESWG) offers an annual exercise for paternity testing laboratories. The Relationship Testing Workshop is open to all members of the ESWG and each year, blood samples, a questionnaire and a paper challenge are sent to the participating laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Website of the Relationship Testing Workshop |url=http://www.rtw-eswg.forensic.ku.dk |website=www.rtw-eswg.forensic.ku.dk |accessdate=September 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spanish and Portuguese Speaking Working Group of the International Society for Forensic Genetics|Spanish and Portuguese Speaking Working Group of the ISFG]] (GHEP-ISFG) ) was founded in 1989 and has been actively supporting and coordinating the development of forensic DNA typing in Spain, Portugal and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Alonso, A., Albarran, C. (2000) The Spanish and Portuguese ISFG Working Group: Ten Years Coordinating DNA Typing In Spain, Portugal and Latin America. Profiles in DNA, August 2000, 7-8; http://www.gep-isfg.org/archivos/201301/03Profiles%20in%20DNA.GEP%20History.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The GHEP focuses on quality and scientific methodology and has organised many collaborative exercises on a variety of topics and shared the results with the scientific community through several publications. GHEP has also established a proficiency testing program, which as of December 2014 has been accredited by ENAC [[:es:Entidad Nacional de Acreditación ENAC|National Accreditation Entity in Spain]] under the standard ISO/IEC 17043: 2010.&lt;ref name="GómezAlonso2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gómez|first1=Josefina|last2=Alonso|first2=Antonio|last3=Garcı́a|first3=Oscar|last4=Carracedo|first4=Angel|title=The proficiency testing program on DNA typing of the Spanish and Portuguese working group of the International Society for Forensic Genetics|journal=International Congress Series|volume=1239|year=2003|pages=837–840|issn=0531-5131|doi=10.1016/S0531-5131(02)00395-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The European DNA Profiling Group ===
The European DNA Profiling Group (EDNAP) was established in 1988 by scientists from European countries.&lt;ref name="Morling, Niels 2013 pp. 365-368"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EDNAP - EDNAP |url=http://www.isfg.org/EDNAP |website=www.isfg.org |accessdate=September 11, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial purpose of EDNAP was to harmonize DNA technologies for criminal investigations so that DNA results could be exchanged across the borders in Europe. In 1991, the group was included among the working groups of the ISFG. It consists of approximately 20 European laboratories and collaborates closely with the DNA Working Group of the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome to ENFSI |url=http://www.enfsi.eu/ |website=www.enfsi.eu |accessdate=September 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EDNAP organises collaborative exercises in order to explore the possibility of standardization of new forensic genetic methods. The results of the exercises are published in peer-reviewed journals. One valuable resource resulting from these activities is the "EDNAP mitochondrial DNA Population Database", short EMPOP, which is being maintained by the Institute for Legal Medicine of the Innsbruck Medical University, Austria.&lt;ref name="ParsonDür2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parson|first1=Walther|last2=Dür|first2=Arne|title=EMPOP—A forensic mtDNA database|journal=Forensic Science International: Genetics|volume=1|issue=2|year=2007|pages=88–92|issn=1872-4973|doi=10.1016/j.fsigen.2007.01.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This database allows for the determination of the statistical weight of evidence for forensic [[Human mitochondrial genetics#Use in identification|mitochondrial DNA]]-typing results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EMPOP |url=http://empop.org |website=empop.org |accessdate=September 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honorary members ==
The general assembly of ISFG members has appointed a number of distinguished honorary members, among them Erik Essen-Möller, Alsbäck/Lysekil, Sweden; [[Ruth Sanger]], London, UK; Otto Prokop, Berlin, Germany; Konrad Hummel, Freiburg, Germany; Sir [[Alec Jeffreys]], Leicester, UK.

Over a period of 24 years (January  1957 – December 1980), [[Martin Gardner]] wrote 288 consecutive "Mathematical Games" columns for ''[[Scientific American]]'' magazine. Subsequently, he alternated with other authors, producing 9 more columns under that title (February 1981 – June 1986), for a total of 297.  These are listed in chronological order below.&lt;ref name=mathcols/&gt;

The subjects of twelve of the columns provided the cover art for the magazine in the month they were published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://martin-gardner.org/SciAm12.html A Gardner's Dozen—Martin's Scientific American Cover Stories]&lt;/ref&gt;  These columns are indicated in the table below by  the word [cover] and a link to the associated cover.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="80705">'''Microsoft codenames''' are given by [[Microsoft]] to products it has in development, before these products are given the names by which they appear on store shelves. Many of these products (new versions of [[Windows]] in particular) are of major significance to the [[Information Technology|IT]] community, and so the terms are often widely used in discussions prior to the official release. Microsoft usually does not announce a final name until shortly before the product is publicly available. It is not uncommon for Microsoft to reuse [[codename]]s a few years after a previous usage has been abandoned.

There has been some suggestion that Microsoft may move towards defining the real name of their upcoming products earlier in the product development lifecycle so as to avoid needing product codenames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.seattletimes.com/brierdudley/2006/05/02/fun_with_microsoft_code_names_1/ | title=Fun with Microsoft code names | date=May 2, 2006 | accessdate=2006-07-23 | first=Brier |last=Dudley | work=Brier Dudley's blog | publisher=The Seattle Times Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11784">An '''[[open format]]''' is a [[file format]] for storing [[Data (computing)|digital data]], defined by a published [[specification]] usually maintained by a [[standards organization]], and which can be used and implemented by anyone. For example, an open format can be implemented by both [[proprietary software|proprietary]] and [[free software|free]] and [[open source software]], using the typical [[software license]]s used by each. In contrast to open formats, [[Proprietary format|closed format]]s are considered trade secrets. Open formats are also called '''free file formats''' if they are not encumbered by any copyrights, patents, trademarks or other restrictions (for example, if they are in the [[public domain]]) so that anyone may use them at no monetary cost for any desired purpose.&lt;ref name="Free File Format Definition"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.linfo.org/free_file_format.html | title=Free File Format Definition | publisher=LINFO.org | accessdate=11 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Meker–Fisher burner''', or '''Meker burner''', is a [[laboratory equipment|laboratory]] [[Gas burner|burner]] that produces multiple open gas [[flame]]s, used for heating, sterilization, and combustion. It is used when laboratory work requires a hotter flame than attainable using a [[Bunsen burner]], or used when a larger-diameter flame is desired, such as with an [[inoculation loop]] or in some glassblowing operations. The burner was introduced by French chemist Georges Méker in an article published in 1905.&lt;ref name=mw&gt;G. Meker. Nouveaux bruleurs de laboratoire et leur application au chauffage a temperature elevee. J. Phys. Theor. Appl., 1905, 4 (1), pp. 348–354.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Meker–Fisher burner heat output can be in excess of {{convert|12000|BTU|abbr=on|lk=on}} per hour (about 3.5 k[[Watt|W]]) using [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LP gas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.durhamgeo.com/testing/laboratory/ovens-bunsen.htm Durham Geo].&lt;/ref&gt; Flame temperatures of up to {{convert|1100|-|1200|°C|°F|-2}} are achievable. Compared with a Bunsen burner, the lower part of its tube has more openings with larger total cross-section, admitting more air and facilitating better mixing of air and gas. The tube is wider, and its top is covered with a plate [[mesh]], which separates the flame into an array of smaller flames with a common external envelope, ensures uniform heating, and also preventing [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting#Flashback|flashback]] to the bottom of the tube, which is a risk at high air-to-fuel ratios and limits the maximal rate of air intake in a Bunsen burner. The flame burns without noise, unlike the Bunsen or [[Teclu burner]]s.&lt;ref name=mw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zco6AAAAIAAJ|page=38|title=Domestic Science, Volume 2|first= Charles W. |last=Hale| publisher=Cambridge University Press|location= London|year= 1915|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael C. Mitchell''' (born January 4, 1946 in [[Portland, Oregon]]) is an American planner, designer, lecturer and environmentalist. His work focuses primarily on the planning and design of destinations, attractions, leisure and [[rural development]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaub &amp; Williams, Published in SW Law, Wednesday, 14 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==MCM Group International==

MCM Group is an international planning and design firm headquartered in [[Los Angeles]]. Founded in 1984 by Michael C. Mitchell after the close of the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Olympic Games]], where he served as the head of planning and operations, the firm has sought to expand those planning techniques as a model to address prominent social problems.&lt;ref&gt;GAA Foundation: MCM Group International, Cangma Mountain Development, 2015. Installation view at Palazzo Mora, 2016. The collection of Time Space Existence – Biennale Architectura 2016&lt;/ref&gt; MCM Group provides feasibility consulting, planning, architecture, landscape design and sustainable engineering services. Mitchell has developed offices in [[Tokyo]], [[Moscow]], Middle East offices in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]], an African base in [[Nairobi, Kenya]] and currently four offices in China, with its headquarters in [[Beijing]].

==Earlier career==

At [[Portland State University]], Mitchell became one of the organizers of the First [[Earth Day]] in 1970, coordinating universities throughout America's northwest states.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} After his work on the First [[Earth Day]], he was one of ten university students selected from across the nation by President [[Richard Nixon]]'s Administration to form a national Youth Advisory Board on environmental matters, S.C.O.P.E (Student Council on Pollution and the Environment)&lt;ref&gt;Flippen, J. Brooks, "Nixon and the Environment," University of New Mexico Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; was assigned to the [[U.S. Department of Interior]] where Mitchell was a reviewer on the creation of the first [[Environmental Impact Statement]] (EIS).

Mitchell continued his work with what became the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]](EPA), writing an environmental education program for students{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympic Games==

In the early 1980s Mitchell was recruited by the [[Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee]], where he served as the Group Vice-President of Planning and Control (Finance). Among his duties included overseeing the planning of the Olympic venues and supervising the architectural department's venue planning. During the Olympics he was responsible for the Games Operations Center and oversaw the closeout of the Games after their completion.&lt;ref&gt;Shaub &amp; Williams, Published in SW Law, Wednesday, 14 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GAA Foundation: MCM Group International, Cangma Mountain Development, 2015.

He has since served as a senior planning consultant to six other Olympic Games and four World Fairs.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==LA84 Foundation==

As head of the close-out operations after the completion of the Los Angeles [[1984 Summer Olympics]], Mitchell oversaw the creation of the [[LA84 Foundation]] which was formed out of the $225 million surplus from the operations of the Games. The Foundation is now a national leader in supporting youth programs, providing recreation and learning opportunities to disadvantaged youth, training youth coaches and convening national conferences on youth sports issues.&lt;ref&gt;LA84 Foundation and the Legacy of the 1984 Olympics, "L.A. Summer Games were a risk that is still paying off," Los Angeles Times, July 28, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Live Aid==

In the Spring of 1985, Mitchell was contacted by [[Bob Geldof]], an English rock musician, that had been working on issues of drought and famine in [[Africa]]. Geldof asked Mitchell to produce a worldwide televised music show to raise funds to help alleviate the catastrophic consequences of the worst African famine in a century.

Mitchell became the Executive Producer of the worldwide [[Live Aid]] broadcast (under a newly formed venture Worldwide Sports and Entertainment)&lt;ref&gt;Fein, Esther B., New York Times, July 12, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; and President of the Live Aid Foundation in America.&lt;ref&gt;[[Medium (website)]], medium.com/@liveaid1985/live-aid-responding-to-the-critics -"The Day The Music Changed The World: Live Aid was a multi-venue rock music concert held on July 13, 1985," Published Nov 18, 2014, retrieved November 24, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The July 13, 1985 broadcast was the world's first large globally interactive show seen by 1.5 billion viewers in 150 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Michael, Rolling Stones, 8/15/ 1985, "Live Aid 1985: The Day the World Rocked, an expression of musicians' concern for the starving of Ethiopia, this was the biggest concert ever"&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]] utilized three satellites to beam from one location around the world, [[Live Aid]] utilized thirteen satellites sending and receiving concerts from seven locations from around the world and producing one international feed back to the 150 nations. Despite 1985 being at the height of the [[Cold War]], Mitchell established a global broadcast with a live concert from the [[Soviet Union]] featuring [[Autograph]], and a delayed Live Aid showing in China.&lt;ref&gt;Fein, Esther B., New York Times, July 12, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Medium (website)]], medium.com/@liveaid1985/live-aid-responding-to-the-critics - "The Day The Music Changed The World: Live Aid was a multi-venue rock music concert held on July 13, 1985," Published Nov 18, 2014, retrieved November 24, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Michael, Rolling Stones, 8/15/ 1985, "Live Aid 1985: The Day the World Rocked, an expression of musicians' concern for the starving of Ethiopia, this was the biggest concert ever"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fein, Esther B., New York Times, July 14, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Live Aid 1985, "A Day of Magic," CNN, May 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Medium, "The Day The Music Changed The World," November 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teltsch, Kathleen, "Live Aid Turns to Plans for Future", N.Y. Times, July 20, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Mitchell – Special Message (ABC- Live Aid 7/13/1985) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeA30drlxs4&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s Administration supported the Live Aid Foundation by providing wheat from America's reserves and awarded Mitchell a Presidential Citation for the Live Aid Foundation's contributions to humanity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mcmgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/document-Live-Aid-Foundation.jpg, retrieved 11/26/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==NFIE==

Mitchell continued his contributions to social and education programs by accepting an appointment to the Board of the National Education Association's Foundation for the Improvement of Education (NFIE), serving on the board from 1987 – 1997. Since its beginning in 1969, the Foundation has served as a laboratory of learning, offering funding and other resources to public school educators, their schools, and districts to solve complex teaching and learning challenges&lt;ref&gt;Marple, Jorea M., An Insider's Guide to making School Systems Work, The Scarecrow Press Inc., Lanham, Maryland and Oxford, 2002, pp149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mcmgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NFIE_0001.pdf, retrieved 11/26/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fund for Democracy and Development==

During the dissolution of the Soviet Union starting in 1990, Russia and Ukraine experienced a severe shortage of medical and food supplies. Working throughout both countries witnessing first-hand the growing crisis, Mitchell and his close friend, Yankel Ginzburg, an American artist and humanitarian, who had family in Tver, Russia, responded to requests by Russia's leadership for assistance, co-founding the "Fund for Democracy and Development" to provide aid to alleviate the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Taube, Herman, "The Art and Life of Yankel Ginzburg," 1994 pp 16, 61, 62, Library of Congress catalogue C872-1918&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell served as the founding board chairman in 1991 and L. Ronald Scheman (co-founder of the [[Pan American Development Foundation]], where his work included providing financial assistance to low-income rural communities), served as the first President. Past President [[Richard M. Nixon]] served as the honorary chairman of the Fund.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, May 29, 1992, "Nixon to Lead Relief Group Visiting Russia and Ukraine"&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1991 to 1994 the Fund is credited with channeling 240 million dollars worth of staples and food supplies to the former Soviet Union. As gratitude for the contributions of the Fund, the Russian government commissioned a monument park to reflect American goodwill.&lt;ref&gt;Taube, Herman, "The Art and Life of Yankel Ginzburg," 1994 pp 16, 61, 62, Library of Congress catalogue C872-1918&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amur Tiger Sanctuary==

With offices established in Moscow and St. Petersburg, Mitchell contributed to several rural development and environmental projects across the former Soviet Union. Mitchell's planning of development projects in rural Russia included work in Siberia on sustainable resource and forest management practices.

While undertaking those projects in conjunction with local wildlife scientists Mitchell convinced the Prime Minister of Russia, [[Viktor Chernomyrdin]], to establish the [[Amur Tiger]] Sanctuary in 1993, which was initially funded through the Global Survival Network (GSN), an environmental organization he co-founded with Steve Galster now of [[Freeland Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freeland.org/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sanctuary included introducing armed ranger patrols to stop the threat that poachers played in the region. The initial work that Mitchell and the Executive Director of GSN, Steve Galster, did to establish the sanctuary was soon funded by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), now known as [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], and is currently carried out with the support of the [[Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (Russia)]]. As a result of this work, the wild Siberian Tiger population has rebounded from their critical endangered level.&lt;ref&gt;WWF Russia, Protection of Siberian Tiger and its Habitat&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exposing animal and human trafficking==

In order to strengthen the Sanctuary efforts to stop poaching, Mitchell worked with Steve Galster conducting undercover video interviews with the poachers. Through these undercover meetings, he and Galster discovered a link between animal poachers and human traffickers. What began as an effort to preserve habitat became an international exposé on trafficking. From 1995-1997 they undertook a two-year undercover investigation personally holding meetings with traffickers and trafficked women to expose the international relationship between animal and human trafficking.

Information and undercover video derived from their investigation were used to create a GSN written report, "Crime &amp; Servitude"&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, Gillian, Author, "Crime &amp; Servitude: An Exposé of the Traffic in Women for Prostitution from the Newly Independent States," Publisher, Global Survival Network (1997), ASIN: B0006QTIII&lt;/ref&gt; and a video documentary, "Bought &amp; Sold."&lt;ref&gt;GSN (Global Survival Network) footage for "Bought &amp; Sold: An Investigative Documentary about the International Trade in Women, " 1995-1998, Texas Archival Resources Online&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released in 1997 and received widespread media coverage in the US and abroad, including specials on ABC Primetime Live, CNN, and BBC.

The documentary also helped to catalyze legislative reform on trafficking as well as new financial resources to address the problem.&lt;ref&gt;University of Texas Libraries, The Riche Media Collection, 3209 B01550, latest revision as of 14:55, 14 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Galster took what was learned during that undercover period and continues this work, founding the [[Freeland Foundation]], which is the lead implementing partner of Asia's Regional Response to Endangered Species Trafficking (ARREST),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freeland.org/arrest/&lt;/ref&gt; a program sponsored by the U.S. government in partnership with [[ASEAN]] and over fifty governmental and non-governmental organizations.

The material that was collected during those two years is housed at the Human Rights Documentation Initiative (HRDI), The University of Texas at Austin

==United Nations Day of Tolerance==

Beginning in 1985, Mitchell began an association with Irving Sarnoff, the Executive Director of Friends of the United Nations (FOTUN), and his co-Founder, Dr. Noel Brown, Director of the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP), North America. The Friends of the United Nations is an NGO dedicated to advocating support for programs of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;"International Instruments of the United Nations," adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, 1945-1995, compiled and Edited by Irving Sarnoff, Founder: Friends of the United Nations, United nations Publications, {{ISBN|92-1-100612-0}}, Copyright United nations, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of their work on international social issues Mitchell was asked to create a celebration for the United Nations [[International Day for Tolerance]] in 1999. The International Day for Tolerance is an annual observation declared by [[UNESCO]] in 1995 to generate public awareness of the dangers of intolerance.

Mitchell organized the 1999 event honoring [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], former leader of the Soviet Union and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], actor, politician and Chairman of the USC Schwarzenegger Institute of State and Global Policy. Keynote speakers included [[John Kerry]], U.S. Senator and U.S. Secretary of State.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, Secretary General Statements and Messages, SG/SM/7213, OBV/123, "Struggle for Tolerance is Struggle for Humanity Itself" 15 November 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rural development==

One of the first projects integrating agricultural development, sustainability, community and social values, and economic growth was in a region of [[Qingdao, China]] where his company, MCM Group, brought international blueberry agricultural experts to develop what is considered now one of the world's largest blueberry farms (The Qingdao Cangma Mountain Development).&lt;ref&gt;GAA Foundation: "MCM Group International, Cangma Mountain Development, 2015" Installation view at Palazzo Mora, 2016. The collection of Time Space Existence – Biennale Architectura 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The project  included hi-technology organic agriculture, agritourism, educational programs, local culture and residential development to provide the local rural community with a successful economic transition.

The '''Natural Resource Governance Institute''' (NRGI) is an independent [[nonprofit organisation]] dedicated to improving countries' [[governance]] over their [[natural resource]]s (in particular [[oil]], [[gas]] and [[mineral]]s) to promote sustainable and inclusive development.&lt;ref&gt;[https://resourcegovernance.org/about-us Self-description by the National Resource Governance Institute. Retrieved February 18th, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters of NRGI are based in [[New York City|New York]].

== History ==

The Natural Resource Governance Institute was established through the merger of the Revenue Watch Institute and the Natural Resource Charter in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://resourcegovernance.org/about-us/what-we-do/strategic-plan Strategic Plan of the National Resource Governance Institute. Retrieved February 18th, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; Originally based in [[New York City|New York]], NRGI has opened offices in [[London]], [[Accra]], [[Lima]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Jakarta]] and [[Dar Es Salaam]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://resourcegovernance.org/about-us/contact-us Offices of NRGI. Retrieved on February 18th, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; This partly reflects its focus on [[Colombia]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Indonesia]], [[Mexico]] [[Mongolia]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nigeria]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Tunisia]] as "priority countries".&lt;ref&gt;[https://resourcegovernance.org/countries Priority countries in NRGI's work. Retrieved February 18th, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation and Activities ==

The Natural Resource Governance Institute is led by a president, with [[Daniel Kaufmann (economist)|Daniel Kaufmann]] currently serving in that role.&lt;ref&gt;[https://resourcegovernance.org/about-us/leadership Leadership Team at NRGI. Retrieved February 18th, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; Its activities are supervised by a board of directors, with [[Ernesto Zedillo]] as chair and [[Smita Singh]] as vice-chair.&lt;ref&gt;[https://resourcegovernance.org/about-us/leadership/board Board of Directors at NRGI. Retrieved February 18th, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, NRGI's leadership team and its board of directors benefit are supported by an Advisory Council co-chaired by [[Michael Spence]] and [[Joseph Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://resourcegovernance.org/about-us/leadership/advisory-council Advisory Council of NRGI. Retrieved February 18th, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent figures affiliated with NRGI include [[Paul Collier]], [[Ernest Aryeetey]], [[Elena Panfilova]], [[Alicia Bárcena Ibarra]], [[Peter Eigen]], [[Antonio La Viña]], [[Ilgar Mammadov]], [[José Antonio Ocampo]], [[Anya Schiffrin]], [[Andrés Velasco]], and [[Tony Venables]].

In line with its mission, NRGI supports civil society organisations, government institutions, private sector enterprises, and the media with technical advice, advocacy, applied research, policy analysis, and capacity development with regard to natural resource governance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://resourcegovernance.org/about-us/what-we-do/strategic-plan Strategic Plan of the National Resource Governance Institute. Retrieved February 18th, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Key tools developed in that context include for example the 2017 Resource Governance Index, a map of resource projects, the Natural Resource Charter Benchmarking Framework, or the 2010 Revenue Watch Index.&lt;ref&gt;[https://resourcegovernance.org/analysis-tools/tools?search=&amp;page=1 Tools developed by NRGI.

== The Natural Resource Charter ==

The Natural Resource Charter is a document aimed at providing advice and policy options with regard to the management of resource wealth in order to help resource-rich countries use their natural resources for sustainable development. NRGI promotes the implementation of the Natural Resource Charter and provides policy advice with regard to this implementation process. The Natural Resource Charter consists of the following 12 ''Precepts'', which are organised into three parts based on the chain of decisions involved in natural resource management:&lt;ref&gt;[https://resourcegovernance.org/approach/natural-resource-charter NRGI (2018). Natural Resource Charter (2nd ed.). Retrieved February 23rd, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Domestic foundations for resource governance
:(1) Resource management should secure the greatest benefit for citizens through an inclusive and comprehensive national strategy, clear legal framework and competent institutions.
:(2) Resource governance requires decision makers to be accountable to an informed public.
* Economic decisions required to manage resources for prosperity
:(3) The government should encourage efficient exploration and production operations, and allocate rights transparently.
:(4) Tax regimes and contractual terms should enable the government to realize the full value of its resources consistent with attracting necessary investment, and should be robust to changing circumstances.
:(5) The government should pursue opportunities for local benefits, and account for, mitigate and offset the environmental and social costs of resource extraction projects.
:(6) Nationally owned companies should be accountable, with well-defined mandates and an objective of commercial efficiency.
:(7) The government should invest revenues to achieve optimal and equitable outcomes, for current and future generations.
:(8) The government should smooth domestic spending of revenues to account for revenue volatility.
:(9) The government should use revenue as an opportunity to increase the efficiency of public spending at the national and sub-national levels.
:(10) The government should facilitate private sector investments to diversify the economy and to engage in the extractive industry.
* International foundations for resource governance
:(11) Companies should commit to the highest environmental, social and human rights standards, and to sustainable development.
:(12) Governments and international organizations should promote an upward harmonization of standards to support sustainable development.

== Resource Governance Index ==

The Resource Governance Index, developed by NRGI, measures the quality of countries' resource governance and ranks them accordingly. The index is constructed by sending a 149-item questionnaire to 150 experts in 81 countries, who research the issues raised in the questionnaire, compile documentation and complete the questionnaire. The quality of the survey data is then assessed by NRGI and enriched by further data on countries "enabling environments".&lt;ref&gt;[https://resourcegovernance.org/analysis-tools/publications/2017-resource-governance-index NRGI (2017). 2017 Resource Governance Index. Retrieved February 23rd, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, NRGI calculates the index as a composite score out of the:
* Value realization score;
* Revenue management score;
* Enabling environment score;
with higher scores indicating a better resource governance process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12209">The '''Regional Studies Association''' ('''RSA''') is an international learned society that is concerned with the analysis of regions and regional issues. The Regional Studies Association works with its international and interdisciplinary membership to facilitate the highest standards of theoretical development, empirical analysis and policy debate of issues at this sub-national scale, incorporating both the urban and rural and different conceptions of space such as city regions and interstitial spaces. We are, for example, interested in issues of economic development and growth, conceptions of territory and its governance and in thorny problems of equity and injustice.

[[File:RSA logo.jpg|thumb|Regional Studies Association logo]]

It runs a programme of international conferences and events based on excellence that has been growing steadily over the years and plays a major role in the Association’s aim in supporting its members disseminate their research. These events also create debates and offer opportunities for those who wish to be part of a community where high quality events are also the place to network within a friendly atmosphere, present their work to international audiences and strengthen their careers. In 2017, the RSA organised events in Ireland, Brazil, China, Romania, Belgium, Australia, UK &amp; Russia. The RSA was a key partner in the European Week of Regions and Cities and we were coordinating the #EURegionsWeek 2017 University sessions and EU Cohesion Policy Master Class. 

The association publishes 5 journals with the publisher [[Taylor and Francis]]: [[Regional Studies (journal) |''Regional Studies'']],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsa.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=cres20|title=Regional Studies :|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Spatial Economic Analysis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsa.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=rsea20|title=Spatial Economic Analysis :|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Territory, Politics, Governance'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsa.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=rtep20|title=Territory, Politics, Governance :|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[open access journal]] ''Regional Studies, Regional Science'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsa.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=rsrs20|title=Regional Studies, Regional Science :|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Area Development and Policy'', that engages with the transformation of the modern world as a result of development of the global South/Greater [[BRICS]]. The ''Regions and Cities'' Book Series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfbuiltenvironment.com/books/series/Regions_and_Cities|title=Built Environment - Routledge|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is published by [[Routledge]] in association with the RSA. The Book Series Editor-in-Chief is Joan Fitzgerald (Northeastern University, USA). ''Regions'' magazine is the membership magazine and the voice of the RSA membership.

It has allocated financial resources to support its members and offer a range of funding opportunities to suit different career stages. These opportunities provide members with the chance to apply for financial help to support their research, run networking events, receive awards for excellence and help towards the costs of travel to attend non-RSA events and present their work to international audiences. The RSA offers the following funding opportunities: '''Travel Grant''' up to £500&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/rsa-travel-grant|title=RSA Travel Grant}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''Policy Expo'''  up to £15,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/policy-expo-grant-scheme|title=RSA Policy Expo Grant Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''Membership Research Grant (MeRSA)''' up to £5,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/rsa-MeRSA-Grant|title=RSA Membership Research Grant Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''Fellowship Research Grant (FeRSA)''' up to £7,500&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/rsa-fellowship-research-grant-scheme|title=RSA Fellowship Research Grant Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''Early Career Research Grant''' up to £10,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/early-career-grant-scheme|title=RSA Early Career Research Grant Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Research Network Grant Scheme''' up to £10,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/research-network-grants|title=RSA Research network grant}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The RSA's Research Networks are formed by RSA members to organise a series of events to examine an issue of collective interest. 

There is an extensive '''international network''' of around 70 Ambassadors, five Divisions (China, Latin America, Northern Europe, India and Russia), five country Sections (Hungary, Poland, Scotland, Ireland and Wales) and six UK regional Branches which support members in their own locales. We also have a non-profit Foundation in Belgium (RSA Europe). These international networks work together with the Association to expend the opportunities and benefits offered to its members but also to those who do not yet know the Association. These networks are set up to organise a range of activities that are open to all to attend and they have the role of informing and disseminating information on regional studies at a regional and/or national level. They also act as an invaluable link to the Association for those who work in a language other than English but also for those who cannot attend all the major events directly organised by the Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/networks|title=RSA International Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The RSA's Chair is Professor Mark Tewdwr-Jones, Director of Newcastle City Futures and Chair of Town Planning, Newcastle University, UK. The RSA’s previous Chair (2012-2017) was Professor Andrew Beer, Dean, Research &amp; Innovation at UniSA Business School, Australia. He succeeded Professor [[David Bailey (academic economist and commentator)|David Bailey]] who served as Chair over 2006–12. Sally Hardy is Chief Executive for the past 30 years. The RSA President is Ron Martin, University of Cambridge, UK. The previous RSA President was [[Peter Hall (urbanist)|Sir Peter Hall]] until 2014.

[[Peter Hall (urbanist)|Sir Peter Hall]] was awarded the RSA's Prize for Outstanding Contribution to the field of Regional Studies at the RSA's Presidential Lunch held at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in September 2008. In subsequent years the association has awarded an annual Sir Peter Hall Prize for outstanding contribution to the field of Regional Studies, with recipients including Ann Markusen, John Bachtler, John Goddard, [[Michael Storper]], [[Allen J. Scott]], Ray Hudson, Brian Robson, Susan Christopherson and [[Saskia Sassen]]  in 2017. The RSA also awards excellence in the field with its Best Book Award, Nathaniel Lichfield Award, RSA and Routledge Early Career Award, as well as its Best Paper and Best Referee Awards for all its academic journals (''Regional Studies; Spatial Economic Analysis; Territory, Politics, Governance; Regional Studies, Regional Science; Area Development and Policy'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding|title=RSA Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The RSA is a member society of the Academy of Social Sciences, previously known as the [[Academy of Learned Societies in the Social Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acss.org.uk/about6.htm |title=Academy of Social Sciences |publisher=Acss.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association is also a recognised United Nations NGO with Consultative Status (ECOSOC).

'''Robert Methven Petrie''' (May 15, 1906 &amp;ndash; April 8, 1966) was a [[Canadian]] [[astronomer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Obituary: Robert Methven Petrie|journal=Physics Today|date=August 1966|volume=19|issue=8|pages=95–96|url=http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v19/i8/p95_s2?bypassSSO=1|doi=10.1063/1.3048428|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927090334/http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v19/i8/p95_s2?bypassSSO=1|archivedate=2013-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Scotland]] but emigrated to [[Canada]] at the age of five.  He grew up in [[Victoria, British Columbia]] and studied physics and mathematics at the [[University of British Columbia]].  He began working summer jobs at the [[Dominion Astrophysical Observatory]] and became fascinated with [[astronomy]].

He obtained his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1932.  He taught there until 1935, when he joined the staff of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory.  In 1951 he became its director.

He extensively studied [[spectroscopic binary|spectroscopic binaries]].

The crater [[Petrie (crater)|Petrie]] on the [[Moon]] is named after him. The [[Canadian Astronomical Society]] established the [[Petrie Prize Lecture|R. M. Petrie Prize Lecture]] to honor his astrophysical research.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The [[electromagnetic spectrum]] [[wavelength]] range is from 387.2 to 694.3 nanometers. The spectrograph is fed from the [[Cassegrain reflector|Cassegrain]] [[Focus (optics)|focus]] through either one of two separate [[optical fiber]] sets, yielding two different spectral resolutions (HE and HR modes). The instrument is entirely computer-controlled. A standard data reduction pipeline automatically processes the data upon every [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] readout cycle.

''HR mode'' is the high resolution mode. This mode incorporates a 40 micrometre exit slit to achieve high [[spectral resolution]] of R = 75000.
 
''HE mode'' is the high efficiency mode. This mode is used when a higher throughput is desired particularly in the case of faint objects [[spectral resolution]] is set to R = 40000.

The R2 [[Echelle grating|échelle]] [[diffraction grating]] has 52.65 grooves per millimeter and was manufactured by [http://gratings.newport.com/information/about.asp Richardson Gratings]. It is [[Blazed grating|blazed]] at 65° its size is 20.4&amp;nbsp;cm x 40.8&amp;nbsp;cm. It is mounted in a fixed configuration. The [[spectrum]] is projected onto the [http://www.e2v.com/home/ E2V Technologies] type 44-82 [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] detector of 4096 x 2048 [[pixels]] kept at a constant temperature of –100&amp;nbsp;°C. This grating yields 41 [[spectral orders]], of which 39 are currently extracted, to obtain wavelengths between 387.2&amp;nbsp;nm and 694.3&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="SOPHIE"/&gt;

==Performance==
{{technical|date=October 2015}}

In [[information theory]], '''Shannon's source coding theorem''' (or '''noiseless coding theorem''') establishes the limits to possible [[data compression]], and the operational meaning of the [[Shannon entropy]].

The '''source coding theorem''' shows that (in the limit, as the length of a stream of [[independent identically-distributed random variables|independent and identically-distributed random variable (i.i.d.)]] data tends to infinity) it is impossible to compress the data such that the code rate (average number of bits per symbol) is less than the Shannon entropy of the source, without it being virtually certain that information will be lost. However it is possible to get the code rate arbitrarily close to the Shannon entropy, with negligible probability of loss.

The '''source coding theorem for symbol codes''' places an upper and a lower bound on the minimal possible expected length of codewords as a function of the [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] of the input word (which is viewed as a [[random variable]]) and of the size of the target alphabet.

== Statements ==
''Source coding'' is a mapping from (a sequence of) symbols from an information [[Information theory#Source theory|source]] to a sequence of alphabet symbols (usually bits) such that the source symbols can be exactly recovered from the binary bits (lossless source coding) or recovered within some distortion (lossy source coding).  This is the concept behind [[data compression]].

=== Source coding theorem ===
In information theory, the '''source coding theorem''' (Shannon 1948)&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt; informally states that (MacKay 2003, pg. 81,&lt;ref name="MacKay"/&gt; Cover 2006, Chapter 5&lt;ref name="Cover"/&gt;):

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{mvar|N}} [[Independent and identically distributed random variables|i.i.d.]] random variables each with [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] {{math|''H''(''X'')}} can be compressed into more than {{math|''N&amp;thinsp;H''(''X'')}} [[bit]]s with negligible risk of information loss, as {{math|''N'' → ∞}}; but conversely, if they are compressed into fewer than {{math|''N&amp;thinsp;H''(''X'')}} bits it is virtually certain that information will be lost.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Source coding theorem for symbol codes ===
Let {{math|Σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, Σ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} denote two finite alphabets and let {{math|Σ{{su|b=1|p=∗}}}} and {{math|Σ{{su|b=2|p=∗}}}} denote the [[Kleene star|set of all finite words]] from those alphabets (respectively).

Suppose that {{mvar|X}} is a random variable taking values in {{math|Σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and let {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} be a [[Variable-length code#Uniquely decodable codes|uniquely decodable]] code from {{math|Σ{{su|b=1|p=∗}}}} to {{math|Σ{{su|b=2|p=∗}}}} where {{math|{{!}}Σ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{!}} {{=}} ''a''}}. Let {{mvar|S}} denote the random variable given by the length of codeword {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;(''X'')}}.

If {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is optimal in the sense that it has the minimal expected word length for {{mvar|X}}, then (Shannon 1948):

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{H(X)}{\log_2 a} \leq \mathbb{E}S &lt; \frac{H(X)}{\log_2 a} +1 &lt;/math&gt;

== Proof: Source coding theorem ==
Given {{mvar|X}} is an [[independent identically-distributed random variables|i.i.d.]] source, its [[time series]] {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is i.i.d. with [[entropy]] {{math|''H''(''X'')}} in the discrete-valued case and [[differential entropy]] in the continuous-valued case. The Source coding theorem states that for any {{math|''ε'' &gt; 0}}, i.e. for any [[information theory#Rate|rate]] {{math|''H''(''X'') + ''ε''}} larger than the [[entropy]] of the source, there is large enough {{mvar|n}} and an encoder that takes {{mvar|n}} i.i.d. repetition of the source, {{math|''X''&lt;sup&gt;1:''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and maps it to {{math|''n''(''H''(''X'') + ''ε'')}} binary bits such that the source symbols {{math|''X''&lt;sup&gt;1:''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are recoverable from the binary bits with probability at least {{math|1 − ''ε''}}.

'''Proof of Achievability.''' Fix some {{math|''ε'' &gt; 0}}, and let

:&lt;math&gt;p(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = \Pr \left[X_1 = x_1, \cdots, X_n = x_n \right].&lt;/math&gt;

The typical set, {{math|''A''{{su|b=''n''|p=''ε''}}}}, is defined as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;A_n^\varepsilon =\left\{(x_1, \cdots, x_n) \ : \ \left|-\frac{1}{n} \log p(x_1, \cdots, x_n) - H_n(X)\right| &lt; \varepsilon \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Asymptotic equipartition property#AEP for discrete-time i.i.d. sources|Asymptotic Equipartition Property]] (AEP) shows that for large enough {{mvar|n}}, the probability that a sequence generated by the source lies in the typical set, {{math|''A''{{su|b=''n''|p=''ε''}}}}, as defined approaches one. In particular, for sufficiently large {{mvar|n}}, &lt;math&gt;P((X_1,X_2,\cdots,X_n) \in A_n^\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; can be made arbitrarily close to 1, and specifically, greater than &lt;math&gt;1-\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; (See 
[[Asymptotic equipartition property#AEP for discrete-time i.i.d. sources|AEP]] for a proof).

The definition of typical sets implies that those sequences that lie in the typical set satisfy:

:&lt;math&gt;2^{-n(H(X)+\varepsilon)} \leq p \left (x_1, \cdots, x_n \right ) \leq 2^{-n(H(X)-\varepsilon)}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that:

*The probability of a sequence &lt;math&gt;(X_1,X_2,\cdots X_n)&lt;/math&gt; being drawn from {{math|''A''{{su|b=''n''|p=''ε''}}}} is greater than {{math|1 − ''ε''}}.
*&lt;math&gt;\left| A_n^\varepsilon \right| \leq 2^{n(H(X)+\varepsilon)}&lt;/math&gt;, which follows from the left hand side (lower bound) for &lt;math&gt; p(x_1,x_2,\cdots x_n)&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\left| A_n^\varepsilon \right| \geq (1-\varepsilon) 2^{n(H(X)-\varepsilon)}&lt;/math&gt;, which follows from upper bound for &lt;math&gt; p(x_1,x_2,\cdots x_n)&lt;/math&gt;  and the lower bound on the total probability of the whole set {{math|''A''{{su|b=''n''|p=''ε''}}}}.

Since &lt;math&gt;\left| A_n^\varepsilon \right| \leq 2^{n(H(X)+\varepsilon)}, n.(H(X)+\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; bits are enough to point to any string in this set.

The encoding algorithm: The encoder checks if the input sequence lies within the typical set; if yes, it outputs the index of the input sequence within the typical set; if not, the encoder outputs an arbitrary {{math|''n''(''H''(''X'') + ''ε'')}} digit number. As long as the input sequence lies within the typical set (with probability at least {{math|1 − ''ε''}}), the encoder doesn't make any error. So, the probability of error of the encoder is bounded above by {{mvar|ε}}.

'''Proof of Converse.''' The converse is proved by showing that any set of size smaller than {{math|''A''{{su|b=''n''|p=''ε''}}}} (in the sense of exponent) would cover a set of probability bounded away from {{math|1}}.

== Proof: Source coding theorem for symbol codes ==
For {{math|1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n''}} let {{math|''s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} denote the word length of each possible {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Define &lt;math&gt;q_i = a^{-s_i}/C&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|C}} is chosen so that {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 1}}.  Then

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
H(X) &amp;=    -\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \log_2 p_i \\
     &amp;\leq -\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \log_2 q_i \\
     &amp;=    -\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \log_2 a^{-s_i} + \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \log_2 C \\
     &amp;=    -\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \log_2 a^{-s_i} + \log_2 C \\
     &amp;\leq -\sum_{i=1}^n - s_i p_i \log_2 a \\
     &amp;\leq  \mathbb{E} S \log_2 a \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where the second line follows from [[Gibbs' inequality]] and the fifth line follows from [[Kraft's inequality]]:

:&lt;math&gt;C = \sum_{i=1}^n a^{-s_i} \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;

so {{math|log ''C'' ≤ 0}}.

For the second inequality we may set

:&lt;math&gt;s_i = \lceil - \log_a p_i \rceil &lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt; - \log_a p_i \leq s_i &lt; -\log_a p_i + 1 &lt;/math&gt;

and so

:&lt;math&gt; a^{-s_i} \leq p_i&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; \sum  a^{-s_i} \leq \sum p_i = 1&lt;/math&gt;

and so by Kraft's inequality there exists a prefix-free code having those word lengths. Thus the minimal {{mvar|S}} satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbb{E} S &amp; = \sum p_i s_i \\
&amp; &lt; \sum p_i \left( -\log_a p_i +1 \right) \\
&amp; = \sum - p_i \frac{\log_2 p_i}{\log_2 a} +1 \\
&amp; = \frac{H(X)}{\log_2 a} +1 \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Extension to non-stationary independent sources ==

=== Fixed Rate lossless source coding for discrete time non-stationary independent sources===
Define typical set {{math|''A''{{su|b=''n''|p=''ε''}}}} as:

:&lt;math&gt;A_n^\varepsilon = \left \{x_1^n \ : \ \left|-\frac{1}{n} \log p \left (X_1, \cdots, X_n \right ) - \overline{H_n}(X)\right| &lt; \varepsilon \right \}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then, for given {{math|''δ'' &gt; 0}}, for {{mvar|n}} large enough, {{math|Pr(''A''{{su|b=''n''|p=''ε''}}) &gt; 1 − ''δ''}}. Now we just encode the sequences in the typical set, and usual methods in source coding show that the cardinality of this set is smaller than &lt;math&gt;2^{n(\overline{H_n}(X)+\varepsilon)}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, on an average, {{math|{{overline|''H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}(''X'') + ''ε''}} bits suffice for encoding with probability greater than {{math|1 − ''δ''}}, where {{mvar|ε}} and {{mvar|δ}} can be made arbitrarily small, by making {{mvar|n}} larger.

'''Soyuz 7K-OKS''' (also known as '''Soyuz 7KT-OK''')&lt;ref name="astronautix"/&gt; is a version of the [[Soyuz spacecraft]] and was the first spacecraft designed for [[space station]] flights. Its only manned flights were conducted in 1971, with [[Soyuz 10]] and [[Soyuz 11]]. 

==Design==

The two craft of the Soyuz 7K-OKS generation were modified from the original [[Soyuz 7K-OK]]. The new "probe and drogue" [[Spacecraft docking and berthing mechanisms|docking mechanism]], which was first used by these two missions, featured an internal docking hatch that allowed for the first time internal transfer between Soviet spacecraft. This "probe and drogue" docking mechanism introduced with Soyuz 7K-OKS is still in use today at the [[ISS]]. The external toroidal fuel tank, a holdover from the original lunar mission models of the Soyuz, was dropped from the 7K-OKS since it was unneeded for Earth orbital flights.&lt;ref name="astronautix"&gt;{{cite web|title=Soyuz 7KT-OK|url=http://astronautix.com/craft/soy7ktok.htm|publisher=Astronautix|accessdate=8 November 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103001120/http://astronautix.com/craft/soy7ktok.htm|archivedate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flights==

The Soyuz 7K-OKS flew only twice, [[Soyuz 10]] and [[Soyuz 11]].&lt;ref name="astronautix"/&gt;

On its maiden flight, the 7KT-OK successfully launched into earth orbit, but failed to dock completely with the [[Salyut 1]] space station. Upon reentry, the spacecraft encountered problems with toxic fumes.&lt;ref name="astronautix2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Soyuz 10|url=http://www.astronautix.com/flights/soyuz10.htm|publisher=Astronautix|accessdate=8 November 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505082833/http://www.astronautix.com/flights/soyuz10.htm|archivedate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This generation of Soyuz spacecraft is notable for the first successful manning of the first space station [[Salyut 1]] by Soyuz&amp;nbsp;11 – this success was however overshadowed by the death of the crew, who were killed when the capsule depressurized during the [[re-entry]] phase.&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Soyuz 11|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1971-053A|work=National Space Science Data Center|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|accessdate=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Science|phil/hist}}

In common usage, '''technoscience''' refers to the entire long-standing global [[human activity]] of [[technology]] combined with the relatively recent [[scientific method]] that occurred primarily in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries. Technoscience thus comprises the history of human application of technology and modern scientific methods, ranging from the early development of basic technologies for [[hunting]], [[agriculture]], or [[husbandry]] (e.g. the well, the bow, the plow, the harness) and all the way through atomic applications, [[biotechnology]], [[robotics]], and [[computer science]]s. This more common and comprehensive usage of the term ''technoscience'' can be found in general textbooks and lectures concerning the history of science.

An alternate, more narrow usage occurs in some philosophic [[science and technology studies]]. In this usage, '''technoscience''' refers specifically to the technological and [[Sociology of science|social context of science]].  Technoscience recognises that scientific knowledge is not only [[Sociology of scientific knowledge|socially coded]] and [[History of science|historically situated]] but sustained and made durable by material (non-human) [[wikt:network|networks]]. Technoscience states that the fields of science and technology are linked and grow together, and scientific knowledge requires an infrastructure of technology in order to remain stationary or move forward.

The latter, philosophic use of the term technoscience was popularized by French philosopher [[Gaston Bachelard]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Gaston Bachelard, ''La materialisme rationel'', Paris: PUF, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Don Ihde, ''Expanding Hermeneutics: Visualism in Science'', Northwestern University Press, 1999, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James M. M. Good, Irving Velody, ''The Politics of Postmodernity'', Cambridge University Press, 1998, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularized in the French-speaking world by Belgian philosopher [[Gilbert Hottois]] in the late 1970s/early 1980s, and entered English academic usage in 1987 with [[Bruno Latour|Bruno Latour's]] "Science in Action".&lt;ref&gt;* [[Bruno Latour]] (1987). ''Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers Through Society''. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-79291-2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In translating the concept to English, [[Bruno Latour]] also combined several arguments about "Technoscience" that had circulated separately within [[Science and Technology Studies|Science and Technology Studies(STS)]] before into a comprehensive framework:

# the intertwinement of scientific and technological development as e.g. shown by the lab studies;
# the power of laboratories (and engineering workshops) to change the world as we know and experience it;
# the seamless webs that connect scientists, engineers and societal actors in actual practice (cf. Law's concept of [[heterogeneous engineering]]);
# the propensity of technoscientific world to create new nature-culture hybrids, and hence to complicate the borders between nature and culture.&lt;ref&gt;* [[Bruno Latour]] (1987). ''Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers Through Society''. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-79291-2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual levels of philosophical technoscience==

We look at the concept of technoscience by considering three levels: a descriptive-analytic level, a deconstructivist level, and a visionary level.&lt;ref&gt;For the idea of discerning levels see Mangelsdorf's initial article version of 17 June 2005: http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Technoscience&amp;oldid=6476436&lt;/ref&gt;

'''On a descriptive-analytic level''', technoscientific studies examine the decisive role of science and technology in how knowledge is being developed. What is the role played by large research labs in which experiments on organisms are undertaken, when it comes to a certain way of looking at the things surrounding us? To what extent do such investigations, experiments and insights shape the view on ‘nature’, and on ‘our’ bodies? How do these insights link to the concept of living organisms as [[biofact (philosophy)|biofact]]s? To what extent do such insights inform technological [[innovation]]? Can the laboratory be understood as a metaphor for social structures in their entirety?

'''On a deconstructive level''', theoretical work is being undertaken on technoscience to address scientific practices critically, e.g. by [[Bruno Latour]] ([[sociology]]), by [[Donna Haraway]] ([[history of science]]), and by [[Karen Barad]] ([[theoretical physics]]). It is pointed out that scientific descriptions may be only allegedly objective; that descriptions are of a performative character, and that there are ways to de-mystify them. Likewise, new forms of [[Knowledge representation|representing]] those involved in research are being sought.

'''On a visionary level''', the concept of technoscience comprises a number of social, literary, artistic and material technologies from western cultures in the third millennium. This is undertaken in order to focus on the interplay of hitherto separated areas and to question traditional boundary-drawing: this concerns the boundaries drawn between scientific disciplines as well as those commonly upheld for instance between research, technology, the arts and politics. One aim is to broaden the term ‘[[technology]]’ (which by the Greek etymology of ‘[[Techne|techné]]’ connotes all of the following: arts, handicraft, and skill) so as to negotiate possibilities of participation in the production of [[knowledge]] and to reflect on strategic alliances. Technoscience can be juxtaposed with a number of other innovative interdisciplinary areas of scholarship which have surfaced in these recent years such as [[technoetic]], [[technoethics]] and [[technocriticism]].

==Facets==
===Social===
As with any subject, technoscience exists within a broader social context that must be considered. Science &amp; Technology Studies researcher Sergio Sismondo argues, “Neither the technical vision nor the social vision will come into being without the other, though with enough Concerted Effort both may be brought into being together".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sismondo |first=Sergio |year=2004 |title=An Introduction to Science and Technology Studies |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=978-0-631-23444-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the frequent separation between innovators and the consumers, Sismondo argues that development of technologies, though stimulated by a technoscientific themes, is an inherently social process.

Technoscience is so deeply embedded in our everyday lives that its developments exist outside a space for [[critical thinking|critical thought]] and evaluation, argues Daniel Lee Kleinman (2005). Those who do attempt to question the perception of progress as being only a matter of more technology are often seen as “champions of technological stagnation. The exception to this mentality is when a development is seen as threatening to human or environmental well-being. This holds true with the popular opposition of [[GMO]] crops, where the questioning of the validity of monopolized farming and patented genetics was simply not enough to rouse awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Klienmen, Daniel Lee. Science and Technology in Society : From Biotechnology to the Internet. Blackwell Pub, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political===
Science and technology are tools that continually change social structures and behaviors. Technoscience can be viewed as a form of government or having the power of government because of its impact on society. The impact extends to public health, safety, the environment, and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Langdon Winner, The Whale and the Reactor: The Search for Limits in an Age of High Technology (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Innovation]]s create fundamental changes and drastically change the way people live. For example, C-SPAN and social media give [[voting in the United States|American voters]] a near real-time view of [[United States Congress|Congress]]. This has allowed journalists and the people to hold their elected officials accountable in new ways.

===Environmental===
Chlorine [[chemist]]s and their scientific knowledge helped set the agenda for many environmental problems: [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] in the [[Hudson River]] are polychlorinated [[biphenol]]s;&lt;ref&gt;“Hudson River PCBs — Background and Site Information".United States Environmental Protection Agency. Retrieved 2007-12-31. http://www.epa.gov/hudson/background.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[DDT]], [[dieldrin]], and [[aldrin]] are chlorinated [[pesticide]]s; CFCs that deplete the [[ozone layer]] are [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s. Industry actually manufactured the chemicals and consumers purchased them. Therefore, one can determine that chemists are not the sole cause for these issues, but they are not blameless.&lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse, Edward. The Future of Technological Civilization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46549">The '''theory of conjoint measurement''' (also known as '''conjoint measurement''' or '''additive conjoint measurement''') is a general, formal theory of continuous [[quantity]]. It was independently discovered by the French economist [[Gérard Debreu]] (1960) and by the American mathematical psychologist [[R. Duncan Luce]] and statistician [[John Tukey]] {{harv|Luce|Tukey|1964}}.

The theory concerns the situation where at least two natural attributes, ''A'' and ''X'', non-interactively relate to a third attribute, ''P''. It is not required that ''A'', ''X'' or ''P'' are known to be quantities. Via specific relations between the levels of ''P'', it can be established that ''P'', ''A'' and ''X'' are continuous quantities. Hence the theory of conjoint measurement can be used to quantify attributes in empirical circumstances where it is not possible to combine the levels of the attributes using a side-by-side operation or [[Concatenation (mathematics)|concatenation]]. The quantification of psychological attributes such as attitudes, cognitive abilities and utility is therefore logically plausible. This means that the scientific measurement of psychological attributes is possible. That is, like physical quantities, a magnitude of a psychological quantity may possibly be expressed as the product of a [[real number]] and a unit magnitude.

Application of the theory of conjoint measurement in psychology, however, has been limited. It has been argued that this is due to the high level of formal mathematics involved (e.g., {{harvnb|Cliff|1992}}) and that the theory cannot account for the "noisy" data typically discovered in psychological research (e.g., {{harvnb|Perline|Wright|Wainer|1979}}). It has been argued that the [[Rasch model]] is a stochastic variant of the theory of conjoint measurement (e.g., {{harvnb|Brogden|1977}}; {{harvnb|Embretson|Reise|2000}}; {{harvnb|Fischer|1995}}; {{harvnb|Keats|1967}}; {{harvnb|Kline|1998}}; {{harvnb|Scheiblechner|1999}}), however, this has been disputed (e.g., Karabatsos, 2001; Kyngdon, 2008). Order restricted methods for conducting probabilistic tests of the cancellation axioms of conjoint measurement have been developed in the past decade (e.g., Karabatsos, 2001; Davis-Stober, 2009).

The theory of conjoint measurement is (different but) related to [[conjoint analysis (marketing)|conjoint analysis]], which is a statistical-experiments methodology employed in [[marketing]] to estimate the parameters of additive utility functions. Different multi-attribute stimuli are presented to respondents, and different methods are used to measure their preferences about the presented stimuli. The coefficients of the utility function are estimated using alternative regression-based tools.

==Historical overview==
In the 1930s, the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] established the Ferguson Committee to investigate the possibility of psychological attributes being measured scientifically. The British physicist and measurement theorist [[Norman Robert Campbell]] was an influential member of the committee. In its Final Report (Ferguson, ''et al.'', 1940), Campbell and the Committee concluded that because psychological attributes were not capable of sustaining concatenation operations, such attributes could not be continuous quantities. Therefore, they could not be measured scientifically. This had important ramifications for psychology, the most significant of these being the creation in 1946 of the ''operational theory of measurement'' by Harvard psychologist [[Stanley Smith Stevens]]. Stevens' non-scientific theory of measurement is widely held as definitive in psychology and the behavioural sciences generally {{harv|Michell|1999}}.

Whilst the German mathematician [[Otto Hölder]] (1901) anticipated features of the theory of conjoint measurement, it was not until the publication of Luce &amp; Tukey's seminal 1964 paper that the theory received its first complete exposition. Luce &amp; Tukey's presentation was algebraic and is therefore considered more general than Debreu's (1960) [[topological]] work, the latter being a special case of the former {{harv|Luce|Suppes|2002}}. In the first article of the inaugural issue of the ''Journal of Mathematical Psychology'', {{harvnb|Luce|Tukey|1964}} proved that via the theory of conjoint measurement, attributes not capable of concatenation could be quantified. N.R. Campbell and the Ferguson Committee were thus proven wrong. That a given psychological attribute is a continuous quantity is a logically coherent and empirically testable hypothesis.

Appearing in the next issue of the same journal were important papers by [[Dana Scott]] (1964), who proposed a hierarchy of cancellation conditions for the indirect testing of the solvability and Archimedean [[axioms]], and David Krantz (1964) who connected the Luce &amp; Tukey work to that of Hölder (1901).

Work soon focused on extending the theory of conjoint measurement to involve more than just two attributes. {{harvnb|Krantz|1968}} and [[Amos Tversky]] (1967) developed what became known as [[polynomial conjoint measurement]], with {{harvnb|Krantz|1968}} providing a schema with which to construct conjoint measurement structures of three or more attributes. Later, the theory of conjoint measurement (in its two variable, polynomial and ''n''-component forms) received a thorough and highly technical treatment with the publication of the first volume of ''Foundations of Measurement'', which Krantz, Luce, Tversky and philosopher [[Patrick Suppes]] cowrote {{harv|Krantz|Luce|Suppes|Tversky|1971}}.

Shortly after the publication of Krantz, et al., (1971), work focused upon developing an "error theory" for the theory of conjoint measurement. Studies were conducted into the number of conjoint arrays that supported only single cancellation and both single and double cancellation ({{harvnb|Arbuckle|Larimer|1976}}; {{harvnb|McClelland|1977}}). Later enumeration studies focused on polynomial conjoint measurement ({{harvnb|Karabatsos|Ullrich|2002}}; {{harvnb|Ullrich|Wilson|1993}}). These studies found that it is highly unlikely that the axioms of the theory of conjoint measurement are satisfied at random, provided that more than three levels of at least one of the component attributes has been identified.

Joel Michell (1988) later identified that the "no test" class of tests of the double cancellation axiom was empty. Any instance of double cancellation is thus either an acceptance or a rejection of the axiom. Michell also wrote at this time a non-technical introduction to the theory of conjoint measurement {{harv|Michell|1990}} which also contained a schema for deriving higher order cancellation conditions based upon Scott's (1964) work. Using Michell's schema, Ben Richards (Kyngdon &amp; Richards, 2007) discovered that some instances of the triple cancellation axiom are "incoherent" as they contradict the single cancellation axiom. Moreover, he identified many instances of the triple cancellation which are trivially true if double cancellation is supported.

The axioms of the theory of conjoint measurement are not stochastic; and given the ordinal constraints placed on data by the cancellation axioms, order restricted inference methodology must be used {{harv|Iverson|Falmagne|1985}}. George Karabatsos and his associates (Karabatsos, 2001; {{harvnb|Karabatsos|Sheu|2004}}) developed a [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] methodology for [[psychometric]] applications. Karabatsos &amp; Ullrich 2002 demonstrated how this framework could be extended to polynomial conjoint structures. Karabatsos (2005) generalised this work with his multinomial Dirichlet framework, which enabled the probabilistic testing of many non-stochastic theories of [[mathematical psychology]]. More recently, Clintin Davis-Stober (2009) developed a frequentist framework for order restricted inference that can also be used to test the cancellation axioms.

Perhaps the most notable (Kyngdon, 2011) use of the theory of conjoint measurement was in the [[prospect theory]] proposed by the Israeli – American psychologists [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]] (Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979). Prospect theory was a theory of decision making under risk and uncertainty which accounted for choice behaviour such as the [[Allais Paradox]]. David Krantz wrote the formal proof to prospect theory using the theory of conjoint measurement. In 2002, Kahneman received the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]] for prospect theory (Birnbaum, 2008).

==Measurement and quantification==

===The classical / standard definition of measurement===

In [[physics]] and [[metrology]], the standard definition of measurement is the estimation of the ratio between a magnitude of a continuous quantity and a unit magnitude of the same kind (de Boer, 1994/95; Emerson, 2008). For example, the statement "Peter's hallway is 4m long" expresses a measurement of an hitherto unknown length magnitude (the hallway's length) as the ratio of the unit (the metre in this case) to the length of the hallway. The real number "4" is a real number in the strict mathematical sense of this term.

For some other quantities, it is easier or has been convention to estimate ratios between attribute ''differences''. Consider temperature, for example. In the familiar everyday instances, temperature is measured using instruments calibrated in either the Fahrenheit or Celsius scales. What are really being measured with such instruments are the magnitudes of temperature differences. For example, [[Anders Celsius]] defined the unit of the Celsius scale to be 1/100th of the difference in temperature between the freezing and boiling points of water at sea level. A midday temperature measurement of 20 degrees Celsius is simply the ratio of the Celsius unit to the midday temperature.

Formally expressed, a scientific measurement is:

&lt;math&gt; Q = r \times [Q]&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Q'' is the magnitude of the quantity, ''r'' is a real number and [''Q''] is a unit magnitude of the same kind.

===Extensive and intensive quantity===

Length is a quantity for which natural concatenation operations exist. That is, we can combine in a side-by-side fashion lengths of rigid steel rods, for example, such that the additive relations between lengths is readily observed. If we have four 1&amp;nbsp;m lengths of such rods, we can place them end to end to produce a length of 4&amp;nbsp;m. Quantities capable of concatenation are known as ''extensive quantities'' and include mass, time, electrical resistance and plane angle. These are known as ''base'' quantities in physics and metrology.

Temperature is a quantity for which there is an absence of concatenation operations. We cannot pour a volume of water of temperature 40&amp;nbsp;°C into another bucket of water at 20&amp;nbsp;°C and expect to have a volume of water with a temperature of 60&amp;nbsp;°C. Temperature is therefore an ''intensive'' quantity.

Psychological attributes, like temperature, are considered to be intensive as no way of concatenating such attributes has been found. But this is not to say that such attributes are not quantifiable. The theory of conjoint measurement provides a theoretical means of doing this.

===Theory===

Consider two natural attributes ''A'', and ''X''. It is not known that either ''A'' or ''X'' is a continuous quantity, or that both of them are. Let ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' represent three independent, identifiable levels of ''A''; and let ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' represent three independent, identifiable levels of ''X''. A third attribute, ''P'', consists of the nine ordered pairs of levels of ''A'' and ''X''. That is, (''a'', ''x''), (''b'', ''y''),..., (''c'', ''z'') (see Figure 1). The quantification of ''A'', ''X'' and ''P'' depends upon the behaviour of the relation holding upon the levels of ''P''. These relations are presented as axioms in the theory of conjoint measurement.

====Single cancellation or independence axiom====

[[Image:Wikipage single cancellation.JPG|thumb|350px|right|Figure One: Graphical representation of the single cancellation axiom. It can be seen that ''a'' &gt; ''b'' because (''a'', ''x'') &gt; (''b'', ''x''), (''a'', ''y'') &gt; (''b'', ''y'') and (''a'', ''z'') &gt; (''b'', ''z'').]]
The single cancellation axiom is as follows. The relation upon ''P'' satisfies ''single cancellation'' if and only if for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''A'', and ''x'' in ''X'', (''a'', ''x'') &gt; (''b'', ''x'') is implied for every ''w'' in ''X'' such that (''a'', ''w'') &gt; (''b'', ''w''). Similarly, for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X'' and ''a'' in ''A'', (''a'', ''x'') &gt; (''a'', ''y'') is implied for every ''d'' in ''A'' such that (''d'', ''x'') &gt; (''d'', ''y''). What this means is that if any two levels, ''a'', ''b'', are ordered, then this order holds irrespective of each and every level of ''X''. The same holds for any two levels, ''x'' and ''y'' of ''X'' with respect to each and every level of ''A''.

Single cancellation is so-called because a single common factor of two levels of ''P'' cancel out to leave the same ordinal relationship holding on the remaining elements. For example, ''a'' cancels out of the inequality (''a'', ''x'') &gt; (''a'', ''y'') as it is common to both sides, leaving ''x'' &gt; ''y''. Krantz, et al., (1971) originally called this axiom ''independence'', as the ordinal relation between two levels of an attribute is independent of any and all levels of the other attribute. However, given that the term ''independence'' causes confusion with statistical concepts of independence, single cancellation is the preferable term. Figure One is a graphical representation of one instance of single cancellation.

Satisfaction of the single cancellation axiom is necessary, but not sufficient, for the quantification of attributes ''A'' and ''X''. It only demonstrates that the levels of ''A'', ''X'' and ''P'' are ordered. Informally, single cancellation does not sufficiently constrain the order upon the levels of ''P'' to quantify ''A'' and ''X''. For example, consider the ordered pairs (''a'', ''x''), (''b'', ''x'') and (''b'', ''y''). If single cancellation holds then (''a'', ''x'') &gt; (''b'', ''x'') and (''b'', ''x'') &gt; (''b'', ''y''). Hence via transitivity (''a'', ''x'') &gt; (''b'', ''y''). The relation between these latter two ordered pairs, informally a ''left-leaning diagonal'', is determined by the satisfaction of the single cancellation axiom, as are all the "left leaning diagonal" relations upon ''P''.

====Double cancellation axiom====
[[Image:Wikipage double cancellation.JPG|thumb|350px|right|Figure Two: A Luce–Tukey instance of double cancellation, in which the consequent inequality (broken line arrow) does not contradict the direction of both antecedent inequalities (solid line arrows), so supporting the axiom.]]

Single cancellation does not determine the order of the "right-leaning diagonal" relations upon ''P''. Even though by transitivity and single cancellation it was established that (''a'', ''x'') &gt; (''b'', ''y''), the relationship between (''a'', ''y'') and (''b'', ''x'') remains undetermined. It could be that either (''b'', ''x'') &gt; (''a'', ''y'') or (''a'', ''y'') &gt; (''b'', ''x'') and such ambiguity cannot remain unresolved.

The double cancellation axiom concerns a class of such relations upon ''P'' in which the common terms of two antecedent inequalities cancel out to produce a third inequality. Consider the instance of double cancellation graphically represented by Figure Two. The antecedent inequalities of this particular instance of double cancellation are:

&lt;math&gt;\left(a, y\right) &gt; \left(b, x\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;\left(b, z\right)&gt; \left(c, y\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Given that:

&lt;math&gt; \left(a, y\right) &gt; \left(b, x\right)&lt;/math&gt;

is true if and only if &lt;math&gt; a + y &gt; b + x &lt;/math&gt;; and

&lt;math&gt;\left(b, z\right) &gt; \left(c, y\right)&lt;/math&gt;

is true if and only if &lt;math&gt; b + z &gt; c + y &lt;/math&gt;, it follows that:

&lt;math&gt;a + y + b + z &gt; b + x + c + y&lt;/math&gt;.

Cancelling the common terms results in:

&lt;math&gt;\left(a, z\right)&gt; \left(c, x\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence double cancellation can only obtain when ''A'' and ''X'' are quantities.

Double cancellation is satisfied if and only if the consequent inequality does not contradict the antecedent inequalities. For example, if the consequent inequality above was:

&lt;math&gt;\left(a, z\right)&lt; \left(c, x\right)&lt;/math&gt;, or alternatively,

&lt;math&gt;\left(a, z\right)= \left(c, x\right)&lt;/math&gt;,

then double cancellation would be violated {{harv|Michell|1988}} and it could not be concluded that ''A'' and ''X'' are quantities.

Double cancellation concerns the behaviour of the "right leaning diagonal" relations on ''P'' as these are not logically entailed by single cancellation. {{harv|Michell|2009}} discovered that when the levels of ''A'' and ''X'' approach infinity, then the number of right leaning diagonal relations is half of the number of total relations upon ''P''. Hence if ''A'' and ''X'' are quantities, half of the number of relations upon ''P'' are due to ordinal relations upon ''A'' and ''X'' and half are due to additive relations upon ''A'' and ''X'' {{harv|Michell|2009}}.

The number of instances of double cancellation is contingent upon the number of levels identified for both ''A'' and ''X''. If there are ''n'' levels of ''A'' and ''m'' of ''X'', then the number of instances of double cancellation is ''n''! × ''m''!. Therefore, if ''n'' = ''m'' = 3, then 3! × 3! = 6 × 6 = 36 instances in total of double cancellation. However, all but 6 of these instances are trivially true if single cancellation is true, and if any one of these 6 instances is true, then all of them are true. One such instance is that shown in Figure Two. {{harv|Michell|1988}} calls this a ''Luce–Tukey'' instance of double cancellation.

If single cancellation has been tested upon a set of data first and is established, then only the Luce–Tukey instances of double cancellation need to be tested. For ''n'' levels of ''A'' and ''m'' of ''X'', the number of Luce–Tukey double cancellation instances is &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n}{3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\tbinom{m}{3}&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if ''n'' = ''m'' = 4, then there are 16 such instances. If ''n'' = ''m'' = 5 then there are 100. The greater the number of levels in both ''A'' and ''X'', the less probable it is that the cancellation axioms are satisfied at random ({{harvnb|Arbuckle|Larimer|1976}}; {{harvnb|McClelland|1977}}) and the more stringent test of quantity the application of conjoint measurement becomes.

====Solvability and Archimedean axioms====

[[Image:Wikipage triple cancellation.JPG|thumb|350px|right|Figure Three: An instance of triple cancellation.]]

The single and double cancellation axioms by themselves are not sufficient to establish continuous quantity. Other conditions must also be introduced to ensure continuity. These are the ''solvability'' and ''Archimedean'' conditions.

''Solvability'' means that for any three elements of ''a'', ''b'', ''x'' and ''y'', the fourth exists such that the equation ''a'' ''x'' = ''b'' ''y'' is solved, hence the name of the condition. Solvability essentially is the requirement that each level ''P'' has an element in ''A'' and an element in ''X''. Solvability reveals something about the levels of ''A'' and ''X'' — they are either dense like the real numbers or equally spaced like the [[integers]] {{harv|Krantz|Luce|Suppes|Tversky|1971}}.

The ''Archimedean condition'' is as follows. Let ''I'' be a set of consecutive integers, either finite or infinite, positive or negative. The levels of ''A'' form a ''standard sequence'' if and only if there exists ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X'' where ''x'' ≠ ''y'' and for all integers ''i'' and ''i'' + 1 in ''I'':

&lt;math&gt;\left(a_i, x\right) = \left(a_{i+1}, y\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

What this basically means is that if ''x'' is greater than ''y'', for example, there are levels of ''A'' which can be found which makes two relevant ordered pairs, the levels of ''P'', equal.

The Archimedean condition argues that there is no infinitely greatest level of ''P'' and so hence there is no greatest level of either ''A'' or ''X''. This condition is a definition of continuity given by the ancient Greek mathematician [[Archimedes]] whom wrote that "Further, of unequal lines, unequal surfaces, and unequal solids, the greater exceeds the less by such a magnitude as, when added to itself, can be made to exceed any assigned magnitude among those which are comparable with one another " (''On the Sphere and Cylinder'', Book I, Assumption 5). Archimedes recognised that for any two magnitudes of a continuous quantity, one being lesser than the other, the lesser could be multiplied by a whole number such that it equalled the greater magnitude. [[Euclid]] stated the Archimedean condition as an axiom in Book V of the [[Euclid's Elements|Elements]], in which Euclid presented his theory of continuous quantity and measurement.

As they involve infinitistic concepts, the solvability and [[Archimedean axiom]]s are not amenable to direct testing in any finite empirical situation. But this does not entail that these axioms cannot be empirically tested at all. Scott's (1964) finite set of cancellation conditions can be used to indirectly test these axioms; the extent of such testing being empirically determined. For example, if both ''A'' and ''X'' possess three levels, the highest order cancellation axiom within Scott's (1964) hierarchy that indirectly tests solvability and Archimedeaness is double cancellation. With four levels it is triple cancellation (Figure 3). If such tests are satisfied, the construction of standard sequences in differences upon ''A'' and ''X'' are possible. Hence these attributes may be dense as per the real numbers or equally spaced as per the integers {{harv|Krantz|Luce|Suppes|Tversky|1971}}. In other words, ''A'' and ''X'' are continuous quantities.

==Relation to the scientific definition of measurement==

Satisfaction of the conditions of conjoint measurement means that measurements of the levels of ''A'' and ''X'' can be expressed as either ratios between magnitudes or ratios between magnitude differences. It is most commonly interpreted as the latter, given that most behavioural scientists consider that their tests and surveys "measure" attributes on so-called "interval scales" {{harv|Kline|1998}}. That is, they believe tests do not identify absolute zero levels of psychological attributes.

Formally, if ''P'', ''A'' and ''X'' form an ''additive conjoint structure'', then there exist functions from ''A'' and ''X'' into the real numbers such that for ''a'' and ''b'' in ''A'' and ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X'':

&lt;math&gt;\left(a, x \right)\succsim\left(b, y \right)\iff \phi_A \left(a\right) + \phi_X \left(x\right)\geqslant\phi_A \left(b\right) + \phi_X \left(y\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\phi'_A \, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi'_X \, &lt;/math&gt; are two other real valued functions satisfying the above expression, there exist &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt; 0, \beta_A \, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_X \, &lt;/math&gt; real valued constants satisfying:

&lt;math&gt;\phi'_A = \alpha \phi_A + \beta_A \, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi'_X = \alpha \phi_X + \beta_X \, &lt;/math&gt;.

That is, &lt;math&gt;\phi'_A, \phi_A, \phi'_X \, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi_X \, &lt;/math&gt; are measurements of ''A'' and ''X'' unique up to affine transformation (i.e. each is an [[interval scale]] in Stevens’ (1946) parlance). The mathematical proof of this result is given in {{harv|Krantz|Luce|Suppes|Tversky|1971|pp=261–6}}.

This means that the levels of ''A'' and ''X'' are magnitude differences measured relative to some kind of unit difference. Each level of ''P'' is a difference between the levels of ''A'' and ''X''. However, it is not clear from the literature as to how a unit could be defined within an additive conjoint context. {{harvnb|van der Ven|1980}} proposed a scaling method for conjoint structures but he also did not discuss the unit.

The theory of conjoint measurement, however, is not restricted to the quantification of differences. If each level of ''P'' is a product of a level of ''A'' and a level of ''X'', then ''P'' is another different quantity whose measurement is expressed as a magnitude of ''A'' per unit magnitude of ''X''. For example, ''A'' consists of masses and ''X'' consists of volumes, then ''P'' consists of densities measured as mass per unit of volume. In such cases, it would appear that one level of ''A'' and one level of ''X'' must be identified as a tentative unit prior to the application of conjoint measurement.

If each level of ''P'' is the sum of a level of ''A'' and a level of ''X'', then ''P'' is the same quantity as ''A'' and''X''. For example, ''A'' and ''X'' are lengths so hence must be ''P''. All three must therefore be expressed in the same unit. In such cases, it would appear that a level of either ''A'' or ''X'' must be tentatively identified as the unit. Hence it would seem that application of conjoint measurement requires some prior descriptive theory of the relevant natural system.

==Applications of Conjoint Measurement==

Empirical applications of the theory of conjoint measurement have been sparse ({{harvnb|Cliff|1992}}; {{harvnb|Michell|2009}}).

Several empirical evaluations of the double cancellation have been conducted. Among these, {{harvnb|Levelt|Riemersma|Bunt|1972}} evaluated the axiom to the [[psychophysics]] of binaural loudness. They found the double cancellation axiom was rejected. {{harvnb|Gigerenzer|Strube|1983}} conducted a similar investigation and replicated Levelt, ''et al.''' (1972) findings. {{harvnb|Gigerenzer|Strube|1983}} observed that the evaluation of double
cancellation involves considerable redundancy that complicates its empirical testing. Therefore, {{harvnb|Steingrimsson|Luce|2005}} evaluated instead the equivalent [[Thomsen Condition]] axiom, which avoids this redundancy, and found the property supported in binaural loudness. {{harvnb|Luce|Steingrimsson|2011}},  summarized the literature to that date, including the observation that the evaluation of the Thomsen Condition also involves an empirical challenge that they find remedied by the [[Conjoint Commutativity]] axiom, which they show to be equivalent to the Thomsen Condition. {{harvnb|Luce|Steingrimsson|2011}} found conjoint commutativity supported for binaural loudness and brightness.

{{harvnb|Michell|1990}} applied the theory to [[L.L. Thurstone]]'s (1927) theory of paired comparisons, multidimensional scaling and Coombs' (1964) theory of unidimensional unfolding. He found support of the cancellation axioms only with Coombs' (1964) theory. However, the statistical techniques employed by Michell (1990) in testing Thurstone's theory and multidimensional scaling did not take into consideration the ordinal constraints imposed by the cancellation axioms {{harv|van der Linden|1994}}.

{{harv|Johnson|2001}}, Kyngdon (2006), Michell (1994) and {{harv|Sherman|1993}} tested the cancellation axioms of upon the interstimulus midpoint orders obtained by the use of Coombs' (1964) theory of unidimensional unfolding. Coombs' theory in all three studies was applied to a set of six statements. These authors found that the axioms were satisfied, however, these were applications biased towards a positive result. With six stimuli, the probability of an interstimulus midpoint order satisfying the double cancellation axioms at random is .5874 (Michell, 1994). This is not an unlikely event. Kyngdon &amp; Richards (2007) employed eight statements and found the interstimulus midpoint orders rejected the double cancellation condition.

{{harvnb|Perline|Wright|Wainer|1979}} applied conjoint measurement to item response data to a convict parole questionnaire and to intelligence test data gathered from Danish troops. They found considerable violation of the cancellation axioms in the parole questionnaire data, but not in the intelligence test data. Moreover, they recorded the supposed "no test" instances of double cancellation. Interpreting these correctly as instances in support of double cancellation (Michell, 1988), the results of {{harvnb|Perline|Wright|Wainer|1979}} are better than what they believed.

{{harvnb|Stankov|Cregan|1993}} applied conjoint measurement to performance on sequence completion tasks. The columns of their conjoint arrays (''X'') were defined by the demand placed upon working memory capacity through increasing numbers of working memory place keepers in letter series completion tasks. The rows were defined by levels of motivation (''A''), which consisted in different amount of times available for completing the test. Their data (''P'') consisted of completion times and average number of series correct. They found support for the cancellation axioms, however, their study was biased by the small size of the conjoint arrays (3 × 3 is size) and by statistical techniques that did not take into consideration the ordinal restrictions imposed by the cancellation axioms.

Kyngdon (2011) used Karabatsos's (2001) order-restricted inference framework to test a conjoint matrix of reading item response proportions (''P'') where the examinee reading ability comprised the rows of the conjoint array (''A'') and the difficulty of the reading items formed the columns of the array (''X''). The levels of reading ability were identified via raw total test score and the levels of reading item difficulty were identified by the [[Lexile]] Framework for Reading {{harv|Stenner|Burdick|Sanford|Burdick|2006}}. Kyngdon found that satisfaction of the cancellation axioms was obtained only through permutation of the matrix in a manner inconsistent with the putative Lexile measures of item difficulty. Kyngdon also tested simulated ability test response data using polynomial conjoint measurement. The data were generated using Humphry's extended frame of reference Rasch model {{harv|Humphry|Andrich|2008}}. He found support of distributive, single and double cancellation consistent with a distributive polynomial conjoint structure in three variables {{harv|Krantz|Tversky|1971}}.

The '''''Walter Lewin Lectures on Physics''''' are a set of three courses including video lectures on [[physics]] by former [[MIT]] Physics Professor [[Walter Lewin]]. He explains the basics of [[classical mechanics]], [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], [[vibrations]], [[wave]]s and introductory topics on [[astrophysics]].  It was prepared in the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and has been used by millions of students, teachers and self-learners around the world.

In late 2014, MIT indefinitely removed Lewin's lectures from OpenCourseWare and [[MITx]] due to a sexual harassment case.&lt;ref name="Globe_MIT_removes_lectures"&gt;{{cite news | work=Boston Globe | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/12/09/mit-removes-online-lectures-popular-retired-professor-after-sexual-harassment-charge/cbHVoxUCWd1YRKbpJw8rfL/story.html |title = MIT removes professor’s online lectures after harassment charge | date=December 9, 2014 | author=Juan Esteban Cajigas Jimenez}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lectures are still featured on other independent educational websites under the [[Creative Commons license]].

==Overview==
[[File:Prof Walter Lewin Elastic Collisions.ogv|thumb|Walter Lewin explaining one-dimensional [[elastic collision]]s during a physics lecture.]]
Many of Walter Lewin's lectures have been shown for over six years on UWTV in [[Seattle]], reaching an audience of over four million people.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} For fifteen years he was on [[MIT]] Cable TV helping [[First year|freshmen]] with their weekly homework assignments. His programs, which were aired 24 hours per day, were also frequently watched by upper-class students. His special lectures given at [[MIT]] for science teachers and for middle school students can be viewed on Lewin's YouTube channel. The three sets of video lectures are separated into [[classical mechanics]], [[electromagnetism|electricity and magnetism]] and [[wave|vibrations and waves]]. All of the video lectures were available for free from [[MIT OpenCourseWare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walter Lewin|url=http://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/lewin_walter.html|publisher=MIT Department of Physics|accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 8, 2014 all the material from his courses including the video lectures were pulled from OpenCourseWare after MIT announced that it determined that Lewin had engaged in sexual harassment of an MITx learner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MIT indefinitely removes online physics lectures and courses by Walter Lewin|url=https://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/lewin-courses-removed-1208|publisher=MIT News Office|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the video lectures continue to be available on Lewin's YouTube channel.

== Classical mechanics ==
8.01 is a first-semester [[freshman]] [[physics]] class in [[Newtonian mechanics]], [[fluid mechanics]], and kinetic gas theory at [[MIT]]. In addition to the basic concepts of Newtonian mechanics, [[fluid mechanics]], and kinetic gas theory, a variety of interesting topics are covered in this course: [[binary star]]s, [[neutron star]]s, [[black hole]]s, [[resonance]] [[phenomena]], [[musical instrument]]s, [[Gravitational collapse|stellar collapse]], [[supernovae]], Astronomical observations from very high flying [[balloons]] (lecture 35), and a peek into the intriguing [[quantum]] world.

== Electricity and magnetism ==
8.02 is a second-semester freshman [[physics]] class in [[electromagnetism]] at [[MIT]]. The 36 video lectures on [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]], by Professor Lewin, were recorded on the [[MIT]] campus during the Spring of 2002. Prof. Lewin is well-known at [[MIT]] and beyond for his dynamic and engaging lecture style.

This class includes many topics, specially the classical theory of [[electromagnetism]]. In addition to the basic concepts of [[electromagnetism]], a vast variety of interesting topics are covered in this course: [[lightning]], [[artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]], [[electric shock]] treatment, [[electrocardiogram]]s, [[metal detector]]s, [[musical instrument]]s, [[magnetic levitation]], [[Shinkansen|bullet trains]], [[electric motor]]s, [[radio]]s, [[TV]], [[car]] coils, [[superconductivity]], [[aurora borealis]], [[rainbow]]s, [[radio telescope]]s, [[interferometer]]s, [[particle accelerator]]s (a.k.a. atom smashers or [[collider]]s), [[mass spectrometer]]s, red [[sunset]]s, [[Diffuse sky radiation|blue skies]], haloes around [[Sun]] and [[Moon]], [[color]] perception, [[Doppler effect]], [[Big Bang|Big-Bang]] [[cosmology]].

== Vibrations and waves ==
8.03 deals with lots of topics in [[physics]] dealing with [[vibrations]] and [[wave]]s. Topics include: mechanical [[vibrations]] and [[wave]]s; [[simple harmonic motion]], [[Superposition principle|superposition]], forced vibrations and [[resonance]], [[coupled oscillation]]s and normal modes; vibrations of continuous systems; [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[refraction]]; phase and [[group velocity]]. [[Optics]]; wave solutions to [[Maxwell's equations]]; [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]; [[Snell's Law]], [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]], [[Huygens' principle]], [[Fraunhofer diffraction]] and [[Diffraction grating|gratings]].

In addition to the traditional topics of mechanical [[vibrations]] and [[wave]]s, coupled oscillators, and electro-magnetic [[radiation]], students  also learn about [[musical instruments]], red [[sunset]]s, glories, [[coronae]], [[rainbows]], haloes, [[X-ray]] binaries, [[neutron]] stars, [[black holes]] and [[Big-Bang]] [[cosmology]].

'''Weapon systems engineering''' involves using engineering tools in [[technology]] to create and guarantee the safety and performance of weapons. It is currently being used by the [[military]] and the government to create new weapons to protect the [[United States]]. It is used to make nuclear and non-[[Nuclear weapon|nuclear weapons]] and ensure their safety throughout their lifespan. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nnsa.energy.gov/aboutus/ourprograms/defenseprograms/futurescienceandtechnologyprograms/engineering|title=Engineering|website=NNSA|accessdate=February 15th, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Companies Involved ==
Many companies help our government and military to manufacture new weapons and strategies. One is Parsons. The [[Missile Defense Agency]], MDA, is a research agency that develops and tests the missile defense agency to defend the United States and its allies. Parsons helps with this through the MDA [[missile]] contract. They provide missile system support including tests and evaluating the performance. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.parsons.com/project/weapons-missile-systems-engineering/|title=Weapons and Missile Systems Engineering – Various U.S. Locations - Parsons|work=Parsons|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] awarded multi-million-dollar contracts with Tekla Research and Avian-Precise Co. to support the "[[Naval Air Systems Command|Naval Air Systems]] Command's Systems Engineering Department". Tekla is to help NAVAIR assess [[technology]], cost, and design. Avian-Precise is to help the command sustain a weapons system related to all U.S. naval platforms and systems. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.executivebiz.com/2018/02/navy-selects-tekla-research-avian-precise-co-for-navair-systems-engineering-support-idiqs/|title=Navy Selects Tekla Research, Avian-Precise Co. for NAVAIR Systems Engineering Support IDIQs|work=ExecutiveBiz|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inventions ==
The electromagnetic railgun launcher is a new long-range weapon using electricity instead of chemicals to launch projectiles. [[Projectile|Projectiles]] can be launched at approximately 4,500 miles per hour using magnetic fields. These new weapons are allowing the military to eliminate [[Explosive material|explosives]] where possible. It is being used by the Navy as well for its ability to be effective and affordable. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://science.dodlive.mil/2015/02/13/the-future-moves-at-mach-6/|title=The Future Moves at Mach 6|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy is working on modernizing their weapons, including nuclear weapons. Two weapons on the list to work on creating are a "low-yield warhead for submarine-launched ballistic missiles" and a "nuclear capable submarine-launched cruise missile". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.defensenews.com/space/2018/02/02/the-us-could-be-getting-2-new-nuclear-capabilities-here-are-the-details/|title=The US could be getting 2 new nuclear capabilities.

The [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] is using Weapons Systems Engineering to help protect our soldiers. They have designed a [[Humvee]] to be equipped to contain a gun with an automated tracking system. This would be controlled by another [[soldier]] or a computer program. This along with other new systems, vehicles, etc. is all possible because of the new advancements in Weapon Systems Engineering. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://taskandpurpose.com/army-wingman-autonomous-vehicle-program/|title=The Army Is Finally Engineering A Wingman Who Won’t Screw Soldiers Over|last=Keller|first=Jared|date=2018-02-14|work=Task &amp; Purpose|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May the Army will test out automated Humvee's to certify them as combat ready vehicles. According to the Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) this is the first step toward weaponized robotics. The Army is not looking to make killing machines, but machines controlled by humans. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.meritalk.com/articles/army-ready-to-certify-armed-robotic-wingman-vehicles-for-combat/|title=Army Ready to Certify Armed, Robotic ‘Wingman’ Vehicles for Combat – MeriTalk|website=www.meritalk.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] Research Lab (AFRL) assigned [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed Martain]] the job of creating "an aircraft-mounted high-power fibre laser". They must make a weapon that is small enough and light enough, but also can be effective. The laser will be mounted on jet fighters with the ability to disable enemies targeting systems. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.airforce-technology.com/features/agents-shield-us-air-forces-new-aircraft-mounted-laser-weapon/|title=Agents of SHiELD – the US Air Force’s new aircraft-mounted laser weapon - Airforce Technology|date=2018-02-19|work=Airforce Technology|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zinaïda Mikolaïevna Aksentieva''' (June 25, 1900 – April 8, 1969) was a Ukrainian/Soviet astronomer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3vNLAAAAMAAJ Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR, 1919-1979:], 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Aksentieva or Aksentyeva was born in [[Odessa]] in 1900. She graduated from [[Odessa University]] in 1924. She worked on mapping gravity and her observatory was one of the first to be able to accurately find the centre of the earth. She worked in [[Poltava Observatory]]. She became observatory director in 1951. Her areas of study were tidal deformation of the earth and [[gravimeter]] Earth profiles.

She has a [[List of craters on Venus|crater on Venus]] that is named in her honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/bul/2129/report.pdf Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature 1994], Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature, 1995, International Astronomical Union, United States Government Printing Office&lt;/ref&gt;

Aksentieva died in 1969 in [[Poltava]] where her observatory was.
