'''''3D&amp;T''''', formerly known as "Defensores de Tóquio", is a [[Brazil]]ian [[tabletop role-playing game]], created by [[Marcelo Cassaro]]. It is designed to be a very simple, beginner-friendly game system.

==History==

=== Origin ===
The name of the game is a pun on the famous ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' or "D&amp;D"; the original version of the game – ''Defensores de Tóquio'' ("Defenders of Tokyo") – was a satire of [[tokusatsu]], [[fighting game]]s, and [[anime]] series. It was created by [[Marcelo Cassaro]] and published by Trama Editorial, later known as Editora Talismã. It spawned "AD&amp;T" - as implied by the name, an "advanced" edition (and a pun on [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons|AD&amp;D]]). Finally, "3D&amp;T" means "Defenders of Tokyo 3rd edition". The major change on the 3rd edition was that it was turned into a [[generic game]], dropping its satire roots. It was a huge success, becoming as popular as ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' and ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' among Brazilian roleplayers.

An even simpler version, like [[GURPS Lite]] called "3D&amp;T Fastplay", was made freely available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dragaobrasil.com.br/3d&amp;t/fastplay.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731015325/http://www.dragaobrasil.com.br/3d&amp;t/fastplay.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=31 July 2008|title=Dragão Brasil -- Site Oficial da Revista Dragão Brasil|date=31 July 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A revision, "3D&amp;T Manual Revisado, Ampliado e Turbinado", was released in 2003.

Dissatisfied with the poor management at Talismã – also publishers of RPG magazine ''Dragão Brasil'', of which he was editor-in-chief – Marcelo Cassaro left to start a new RPG magazine, ''RPG Master'' for Mythos Editora, a magazine entirely dedicated to 3D&amp;T (although the news releases for other systems)&lt;ref&gt;Talu (June 27, 2005), [http://www.rederpg.com.br/portal/modules/news/article.php?storyid=2864 RPGMaster #01 - Tópico a Tópico] RedeRPG&lt;/ref&gt; and soon after, ''Dragon Slayer'', fully devoted to the [[d20 System]]; meanwhile, Talismã kept publishing 3D&amp;T, despite ''not'' having the rights to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamboeditora.com.br:80/noticias/3d&amp;t-bastidores.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226213310/http://www.jamboeditora.com.br:80/noticias/3d&amp;t-bastidores.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 February 2009|title=Jambô Editora|date=26 February 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, ''Dragon Slayer'' was very successful and remains in print, while Talismã closed their doors.

===4D&amp;T===
As a successor to 3D&amp;T, a new system named 4D&amp;T was published in 2006 by [[Editora JBC]] (Brazilian publisher of manga). It completely dropped 3D&amp;T's own fast, in this the player uses 4 [[six-sided dice]]. The book was published under the [[Open Game License]]. This edition is itself a change of the [[d20 System]], but with six-sided dice.

Although it has succeeded on its own, it has been poorly received by 3D&amp;T players, given the original purpose of the system was to be as simple as possible.

===3D&amp;T Alpha===
In May 2008, Cassaro was told by Guilherme Dei Svaldi, editor-in-chief at Jambô Editora, that he found 3D&amp;T to remain very popular, despite being out of print for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.doutorcareca.com.br/?p=239 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-01-05 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130115044514/http://www.doutorcareca.com.br/?p=239 |archive-date=2013-01-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This surprised Cassaro, and gave him the idea of bringing 3D&amp;T back; it was released again in September 2008, under the name "3D&amp;T Alpha"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamboeditora.com.br/noticias/3d&amp;t-anuncio.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223231244/http://www.jamboeditora.com.br/noticias/3d&amp;t-anuncio.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 February 2009|title=Jambô Editora|date=23 February 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the new name inspired by ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 3]]'', which Cassaro and [[Erica Awano]] had adapted into a 4-issue comic book series published by Trama in 1998/99&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fenixdown.com.br/2011/11/gamics-002/&lt;/ref&gt;). It is also available as a free [[e-book]] from Jambô's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jamboeditora.com.br/produtos/3d%26t.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-09-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724101436/http://www.jamboeditora.com.br/produtos/3d%26t.htm |archive-date=2010-07-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this new version, the combat rules remain basically the same; the advantage/disadvantage system was fine-tuned; and, most importantly, the magic system was completely revamped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jamboeditora.com.br/noticias/3d%26t-anuncio.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-09-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122142930/http://www.jamboeditora.com.br/noticias/3d%26t-anuncio.php |archive-date=2008-11-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, now the book is printed in [[Page orientation|landscape]] format.

In 2010 the first major setting for 3D&amp;T Alpha was announced: '''Mega City,''' by Gustavo Brauner. It was finally published in mid-2012, bringing as setting a [[Megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]] in which five different smaller settings coexist: 
*'''''Super Mega City''''' (featuring superheroes and supervillains, similar to characters from [[DC Comics]] and [[Marvel Comics]])
*'''''Torneio das Sombras''''' (''Tournament of the Shadows'', featuring martial artists similar to the ones in video games like [[Street Fighter]], [[Tekken]] and [[The King of Fighters]])
*'''''Megadroide''''' (''Megadroid'', featuring characters equipped with futuristic technology inspired in Japanese pop culture like [[Mega Man]] and [[Astro Boy]]; a later handbook expanded this setting to include references to [[Mecha]] and [[Tokusatsu]] genres)
*'''''Crônicas de Nova Memphis''''' (''Nova Memphis Chronicles'', featuring supernatural creatures such as vampires, werewolves, angels and demons, similar to the [[World of Darkness]] RPG setting)
*'''''Mega City Contra-Ataca''''' (''Mega City Strikes Back'', featuring regular people such as police officers, scientists, athletes and journalists among several other occupations, for more realistic adventures)
'''Mega City''' allows to either choose one of the smaller settings to play, or to combine some of them (or even all of them), teaching how to balance the different kinds of characters.

A second major setting was released in the same year: '''Brigada Ligeira Estelar''' ''(Star Light Brigade),'' by Alexandre Lancaster. It's a [[mecha]]/[[space opera]]/[[swashbuckling]] setting, bringing an empire spread in seventeen solar systems that together form the '''Constellation of Sabre''' – main target of invaders from outer space called ''The Forsaken,'' while the empire itself is divided by political intrigue. ''Brigada'' brings a heavy influence of classic sci-fi anime like [[Mobile Suit Gundam]], [[Captain Harlock]], [[Legend of the Galactic Heroes]] and [[Star Blazers]], having as player characters [[mecha]] ace pilots, [[space pirates]], space [[condottieri]], swashbuckling [[noblemen]] and others.

== Overview ==
A game aimed at beginners, 3D&amp;T focus on simplicity and ease of play.

As in [[GURPS]], each character is built with a pre-determined number of "points" (typically 5) to distribute between the main stats, magic power and advantages and disadvantages.

There are 5 stats:
* "Força" - Strength (which does not only measures the physical might of the character but also skill in melee combat)
* "Habilidade" - Ability (which measures manual dextery, speed and mental abilities)
* "Resistência" - Resistance (which measures the "health" of the character, and defines its Hit Points)
* "Armadura" - Armor (which measures how well the character can protect him/herself)
* "Poder de Fogo" - Firepower (which measures skill with ranged attacks - anything from firearms to bows and throwing daggers)

The magical powers of characters are defined by "Elemental Paths" ("Caminhos Elementais", in the original), which measure how well the mage can control the elements - there are 6 "Elemental Paths": Fire ("Fogo"), Water ("Água"), Earth ("Terra"), Air ("Ar"), Light ("Luz") and Darkness ("Trevas").

Advantages and disadvantages are special powers which characters can possess; advantages cost points, and disadvantages ''give'' more points to spend. Finally, there is also a special kind of advantages, called "skills" ("Perícias"), which are things that your character can do, but with no relation to combat: "Animals","Arts", "Crime", "Investigation","Languages", "Machines","Manipulation", "Medicine", "Science","Sports" and "Survival."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2398">'''Advance Party''' is the name given to a concept of three films which are all to follow a set of rules proposed by executive producers [[Gillian Berrie]], [[Lone Scherfig]] and [[Anders Thomas Jensen]].  The concept came out of discussion between [[Lars von Trier]], Berrie, Scherfig and Jensen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgowfilm.org.uk/redroad/characters.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013171909/http://www.glasgowfilm.org.uk/redroad/characters.html |archivedate=2006-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each film is to be made by different first-time directors and producers.  The production companies Sigma Films (Glasgow) and [[Zentropa]] (Denmark) are behind the concept.&lt;ref name="JG10"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/18/donkeys-development-hell-red-road|title=Disasters to Donkeys: how a cursed film shoot came good|last=Graham|first=Jane|date=18 November 2010|work=The Guardian|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scherfig and Jensen created a list of characters and gave them back stories, which the three directors could then use to build their story.

Casting for all three films was to be done at the same time by the three different directors, due to the intended shared cast.

==Films==
''[[Red Road (film)|Red Road]]'' was the first film in the trilogy to be released in 2006, directed by [[Andrea Arnold]] (Glasgow).  The second, directed by [[Morag McKinnon]] (Glasgow), ''[[Donkeys (film)|Donkeys]]'', was completed and released in 2010&lt;ref name="JG10"/&gt; and [[Mikkel Nørgaard]]'s (Copenhagen) film is reportedly in "development limbo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/chicago/Details.do?page=1&amp;xyurl=xyl://TOCWebArticles1/114/film/rules_of_the_road.xml |accessdate=2007-06-21 |title=Rules of the ''Road'' |work=Time Out Chicago |date=2007-05-03 |author=Ben Kenigsberg }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''American Sharia''''' is a 2015 [[United States|American]] [[Buddy cop film|buddy cop]] [[comedy-drama]] [[action film]] directed by [[Omar Regan]], written by Omar Regan, and stars Omar Regan, [[Baba Ali]] and [[Eric Roberts]]. The film is about rogue government officials using [[Islamophobia]] to maintain power&lt;ref name="aquila-style"&gt;{{cite news |last=Shahid|first=Omar|url=http://www.aquila-style.com/focus-points/halalywood/62379/|title=Halalywood: The rise of the Islamic entertainment industry|work= |location= |publisher=''Aquila Style''|date=April 3, 2014|accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while two Muslim police officers attempting to solve a case involving the disappearance of several Muslims.

==Plot==
Officer Richardson ([[Eric Roberts]]) profiles every Muslim he sees as a terrorist. He goes on an arrest frenzy, which makes the community activists, Jihad (Adam Saleh) and Osama (Sheikh Akbar) take to the streets and rally the people to stand up for their rights.

The Chief of Police (Joshua Salaam) wants to gain the trust of the Muslim community in order to get re-elected, but Attorney Leila Rodriguez (Yasemin Kanar) is standing in the way with a discrimination lawsuit against Officer Richardson and the Motor City Police Department. The Chief calls, Mohammed ([[Omar Regan]]) who keeps his faith to himself and his own prejudices against Islam, following constant exposure to Islamophobia, and partners him with a Middle Eastern, Detective Abdul ([[Baba Ali]]), who proudly shows his religious values. Together, they have to solve a case involving the disappearance of several Muslims as well as a respectable Muslim leader who is charged with an assault arrest. The Chief wants them to "Speak Muslim To The Muslims" which he thinks will guarantee his re-election and results in ending rising Islamophobic tensions between the police and the community.

==Cast==
*[[Omar Regan]] as Mohammed
*[[Baba Ali]] as Abdul
*[[Eric Roberts]] as Officer Richardson
*Joshua Salaam as Police Chief
*Yasemin Kanar as Attorney Leila Rodriguez
*Adam Saleh as Jihad
*Sheikh Akbar as Osama

==Production==
===Development and pre-production===
[[Omar Regan]] is the director, producer and writer of ''American Sharia'', and it is the first production under his company Halalywood Entertainment.&lt;ref name="arabamericannews"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hijazi|first=Samer|url=http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/news/id_9027/Halalywood-comes-to-metro-Detroit-with-film-production-of-%22American-Sharia%22.html|title='Halalywood' comes to metro Detroit with film production of "American Sharia"|work=|location=|publisher=''[[The Arab American News]]''|date=July 3, 2014|accessdate=February 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201021714/http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/news/id_9027/Halalywood-comes-to-metro-Detroit-with-film-production-of-%22American-Sharia%22.html|archive-date=2015-02-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Regan wrote the story&lt;ref name="theasiantoday"&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|url=http://www.theasiantoday.com/article.aspx?articleId=4463|title=Omar Regan presents 'American Sharia'!|work=|location=|publisher=''[[The Asian Today]]''|date=February 12, 2015|accessdate=June 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405211223/http://www.theasiantoday.com/article.aspx?articleId=4463|archive-date=2015-04-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it then took about two years to get the film project started. Before production for the film even began, Regan created a two-minute trailer in hope of selling the project to investors. In December 2013, the campaign for the film was launched, Regan used [[Kickstarter]] to generate funds for the film and the film earned $122,000 in donations in less than 40 days.&lt;ref name="arabamericannews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kickstarter"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/americansharia/american-sharia|title="American Sharia" by Omar Regan|publisher=[[Kickstarter]]|date=December 2013|accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="filmstarts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmstarts.de/kritiken/228219.html|title=American Sharia|publisher=Filmstarts.de|date=December 2013|accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film cost £124,000 to make.&lt;ref name="easterneye"&gt;{{cite news |last=Choudhury|first=Imran|url=http://www.easterneye.eu/features/features-news/First+%27Halalywood%27+film+American+Sharia+on+UK+tour/4576|title=First 'Halalywood' film American Sharia on UK tour|work= |location= |publisher=''[[Eastern Eye]]''|date=February 12, 2015|accessdate=June 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, Regan told ''Asian World News'' "I had some life experience which really affected me. In 2009, the government killed my father. He was Muslim and they said he wanted to establish Sharia in America. They shot him 20 times! He was the victim of Islamaphobia. He’s gone and there was no way to defend himself. Later, they put a small clip on the news confirming he really wasn’t a terrorist. I didn't want to make a hate film in response to that, but instead to re-educate the public.

===Filming and post-production===
{{quote box|align=right|width=33%|quote=''American Sharia'' is a Hollywood motion picture that sets out to use comedy to reverse the prejudices held against Islam and help promote the religion in a more positive way.

In February 2015, Regan told Asian Image, "''American Sharia'' is a Hollywood motion picture that sets out to use comedy to reverse the prejudices held against Islam and help promote the religion in a more positive way. It's an alternative form of entertainment, during a time where we are surrounded and exposited to increasing negativity and profanity."

When the project became financially secure, Regan decided to bring the production to the diverse communities of [[Metro Detroit]]. The film crew is composed of people from diverse backgrounds, religions and ethnicities.&lt;ref name="arabamericannews"/&gt;

City officials in Dearborn Heights were lenient regarding the production of the film, allowing the cast and crew to shoot at several prime locations, including at the Berwyn Senior Citizen Center. Scenes were also shot at the Alsadek Market on Warren Aveue in Dearborn and in and around [[Downtown Detroit]]. At the end of June 2014, the production of the film completed in [[Dearborn Heights, Michigan|Dearborn Heights]] after a month-long shoot around Metro Detroit that employed dozens of Muslims and Arab Americans from California, New York and Michigan. On the last day of production at the Berwyn Senior Citizen Center, more than 100 extras turned out, many dressed in Islamic attire, to shoot a scene depicting a homeless shelter being raided by the police.&lt;ref name="arabamericannews"/&gt;

In February 2015, Regan told ''Asian Image'', "''American Sharia'' is a Hollywood motion picture that sets out to use comedy to reverse the prejudices held against Islam and help promote the religion in a more positive way.

==Reception==
Aneesa Malik of ''Asian World News'' said of the film "action packed comedy that’s a sure fire way to tickle your funny bone... It explores real-life situations where Muslims are mistakenly seen to be 'radicalised' and uses comedy to defy such assumptions."&lt;ref name="asianworldnews"/&gt; ''[[The Asian Today]]'' called the film "an action comedy that lifts the curtain on real Muslim lives."&lt;ref name="theasiantoday"/&gt; ''Urban Asian'' called it a "hilarious new film".&lt;ref name="urbanasian"/&gt; ''Desi News'' called it a "family-friendly film".&lt;ref name="desinews"/&gt;

Aalia Khan the ''Asian Sunday Newspaper'' rated the film 1/5 and said, "...the cheesy comedy and stiff acting paved the way for this movie to be a much hyped let down... On the other hand it was a good effort in trying to shed light on some of the misunderstandings surrounding Islam."&lt;ref name="asiansunday2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Khan|first=Aalia|url=http://www.asiansunday.co.uk/american-sharia/|title=American Sharia review|work= |location= |publisher=''Asian Sunday Newspaper''|date=March 2, 2015|accessdate=June 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Bennett of ''Chortle'' said, "This limited circuit is probably where ''American Sharia'' will stay, as it's hard to see the movie to making a mainstream crossover."&lt;ref name="chortle"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bennett|first=Steve|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/review/2015/02/17/21867/american_sharia|title=American Sharia|work= |location= |publisher=''Chortle''|date=February 17, 2015|accessdate=June 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The game retells key moments from the ''[[Attack on Titan]]'' manga (1 through 19-), in addition to new scenarios involving the key characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2015/08/21/koei-tecmos-attack-on-titan-game-includes-the-entire-story-from-the-anime/|title=Koei Tecmo’s Attack On Titan Game Includes The Entire Story From The Anime|last=Sato|work=[[Siliconera]]|date=August 21, 2015|accessdate=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 845, when Eren was just 10 years old, the "Colossal Titan" suddenly appeared. Large enough to breach the Wall, it allowed other Titans to rampage through the city. One of them ate Carla, Eren's mother. With the so-called "Armored Titan" now preventing access, Wall Maria was abandoned and humanity were forced to fall back to Wall Rose. Having lost his family, his home and his dreams, Eren swore revenge on the Titans. Aiming to become a member of the Scout Regiment, he joined the "104th Cadet Corps."

Five years after Eren enlisted, the "Colossal Titan" suddenly appeared again. Eren tried to fight it alone but failed to defeat it. He returned to headquarters and then takes a squad out himself, but the mission was a failure with Eren suffering a terrible injury to his leg and many soldiers being killed. When Armin was about to be eaten by a Titan, Eren sacrifices his life to save him. Immediately before the Trost District Wall was destroyed by the Colossal Titan, elite members of the Scout Regiment were on a mission outside the Wall. The principle role of the Scout Regiment was to scout beyond the Wall, seeking a way to take back Wall Maria which was lost 5 years previously. Setting up supply bases in destroyed towns and villages, they sought to secure a route for a large force to make their way to the Shiganshina District, where the Wall was destroyed. Fighting with the Titans outside the wall as they go, they sought to secure the route while making new discoveries along the way.

The brave resistance offered by the Garrison Regiment, combined with the return of the Scout Regiment, was enough to keep Wall Rose safe from the Titans. Within the Walls, however, the same chaos descended as was experienced when Wall Maria was lost 5 years previously. Not only has the Colossal Titan attacked humanity again, but the damaged Wall has been repaired - unbelievably - by the "power of the Titans." Is Eren an ally for humanity or just another enemy? As the debate continues within the Walls, the Scout Regiment - newly joined by Eren - begin their 57th mission to the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/attackontitan/drama.html|title=Attack on Titan|website=Attack on Titan Official Site|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Authoritarian literature''' &lt;ref&gt;Gardner, John. ''The Art of Fiction''. New York: Random House 1983. Vintage Books ed. New York: Random House 1991. pp. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; is a term used by [[John Gardner (novelist)|John Gardner]] to designate the body of literature written by persons living under an [[authoritarian]] governmental regime. Literary works produced in these regimes share common characteristics that make the designation useful. Authoritarian regimes revere their leaders, who historically were typically referred to as kings, along with advisors to the king. These leaders were considered innately better than ordinary people. The authoritarian leader, and his approved circle, if not directly writing about a subject themselves, were the only ones who could designate, approve, and sanction writers as acceptable authorities. Government authorities also financially supported writers under a [[patronage]] system. The writers in such a system therefore must necessarily be careful to ensure the composition of their work met (or would meet) the approval of authorities. Failure to comply risked official warnings, loss of governmental sanction, and sometimes even imprisonment or loss of life.

Fiction produced under authoritarian regimes tends to be didactic. Subject matter can vary in terms of plot, but the didactic point of the work is almost always to illustrate what authorities would consider the proper comportment of individuals within the authoritarian society. This didactic point is conveyed to readers in order to idealize the existing social structure and thus, hopefully, perpetuate it. Authoritarian fiction is considered to be demonstrative in purpose rather than explorative. The author's narrative voice is also usually authoritarian in order to impart something known by the author that is presumably not known by the reader. Since most people don't enjoy and resist being spoken to as an inferior, the more successful (or popular) authors of such literature are the ones who best disguise, or sugarcoat, their didactic purpose. One common way to achieve such indirectness is through the use of the form [[allegory]].

==Examples==

Good examples of authoritarian literature include ''[[Beowulf]]'', ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'', and in [[English literature]] we see vestiges as late as [[Charles Dickens]]. While didacticism forms a significant component of [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]]'s, [[George Orwell|Orwell]]'s and [[C. S. Lewis]]' fiction as well, their works can not strictly be considered as authoritarian literature because they were not writing at the whim of political leaders. Dickens was not writing for the British government either, but he used the same forms of his predecessors, who did write for the court, particularly in his earlier novels, such as ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' and ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'', where we most easily observe a certain preachiness. Dickens constructed his plots for the sake of demonstration rather than the purpose of exploration. However, Charles Dickens is a transitional figure, and in his later novels, such as ''[[Great Expectations]]'', we can "feel the two impulses warring in the writer's mind".&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, John. ''The Art of Fiction''. New York: Random House 1983. Vintage Books ed. New York: Random House 1991. pp. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary Works==

Authoritarian literature is, of course, not a purely historical phenomenon. It persists as the dominant form of everyday literature of [[Middle East]]ern countries ([[Turkey]], [[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], and arguably [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Iran]]'s literature excepted), and, until recently, [[Chinese literature]]. To understand the nature of authoritarian literature's purpose is to better understand the reason for the forms in which we see literature currently being produced in these countries.

The antithesis to Authoritarian literature is Anti-Authoritarian literature. Practitioners of this genre in the aforementioned countries are routinely subjected to harsh sanctions, and many choose to go into exile in order to write freely. Still other writers suffer censorship and imprisonment at their government's hands (e.g. [[Sunallah Ibrahim]] and [[Abdul Rahman Munif]]). Authoritarian literature authors, however, who write works of fiction that support or praise governments, as expected, often see promotion to positions of authority within their respective country's governing cultural body

'''''Blade II''''' is a 2002 [[Action game|action]]/[[beat 'em up]] [[video game]] developed by [[Mucky Foot Productions]] and published by [[Activision]] for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. Originally scheduled for North American release on the same day as the theatrical release of the ''[[Blade II]]'' film (March 22), it was ultimately released on September 3, the same day the film was released on [[DVD]].

The game is not a direct adaptation of the film, but is actually a sequel, taking place between the events of ''Blade II'' and ''[[Blade: Trinity]]''. Set six months after the events of the film, it follows [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] and [[Abraham Whistler|Whistler]] as they attempt to prevent the [[vampire]]s from creating a race of super-vampires even more powerful than the Reapers. 

The developers championed the game as introducing a new type of never-before-seen melee combat into video gaming. However, most reviewers disliked the system, and the game as a whole was met with mainly negative reviews on both the PlayStation 2 and the Xbox. The game was also a commercial failure, selling less than half a million units across both platforms.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Blade II gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Blade fighting in 360° combat. The green meter on the bottom left is his [[Health (gaming)|health]], the blue meter is his [[Serum (blood)|Serum]] level, and the red meter is his Rage. The [[glyph]]s on the bottom left represent the three stages of his Rage meter.]]

''Blade II'' is an [[action game|action]]/[[beat 'em up]] game played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]], with the player controlling [[Blade (comics)|Blade]]'s movement via the left [[analog stick]]. The game primarily focuses on melee combat, although it does allow the use of firearms. 

Combat is controlled via the right analog stick, allowing for what the developers call a "360° combat system" – the player moves the stick in the direction in which they want to attack and Blade punches or kicks in that direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Blade II PlayStation 2 Instruction Manual ''(UK)'' | chapter=Controls | pages=5–6 | publisher=[[Activision]] | year=2002 | id=SLES-51013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player has no control over what kind of attack Blade executes, only the direction in which he attacks.&lt;ref name="July"/&gt; Blade can also block, chain attacks together into [[Combo (video gaming)|combos]] and perform "finishing moves," such as grabbing an enemy in a headlock and driving a stake into their head.

A major feature of the game is Rage mode. Fighting slowly and methodically charges up Blade's Rage meter through three levels: "Sword", "Shield" and "Strength". If the player activates Rage mode on the first level, Blade will take out his [[sword]] and use it for a limited amount of time. If activated on the second level, Blade uses his sword and becomes invincible. If activated on the third level, Blade uses his sword, becomes invincible and increases in strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Blade II PlayStation 2 Instruction Manual ''(UK)'' | chapter=Rage | page=12 | publisher=Activision | year=2002 | id=SLES-51013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the game Blade is equipped with only a "[[Machine pistol|mach pistol]]," but as the player advances they can unlock other weapons and accessories; a [[shotgun]], a [[glaive]], stronger [[body armor]], [[brass knuckles|silver knuckles]], [[Ultraviolet|UV grenades]], and [[Serum (blood)|serum]] to increase Blade's [[Health (gaming)|health]] regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Blade II PlayStation 2 Instruction Manual ''(UK)'' | chapter=Weapons | pages=15–16 | publisher=Activision | year=2002 | id=SLES-51013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="[[Deacon Frost]], former leader of the Vampire Nation, is just so much ash now. But these [[vermin]] never lay still for long. Damaskinos came, and attempted to [[Biological engineering|bio-engineer]] the Ultimate Vampire. Immune to [[silver]], resistant to [[garlic]], they were all but unbeatable. But they weren't immune to sunlight...We defeated them. Barely. Now the forces of darkness seem to be stirring again. We've received intel on an exchange of blood between a local [[mafia]] group and a known vampire clan."&lt;ref name="Diary"&gt;{{cite book | title=Blade II PlayStation 2 Instruction Manual ''(UK)'' | chapter=Daywalker's Journal | page=4 | publisher=Activision | year=2002 | id=SLES-51013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Blade II'' takes place six months after the events of the film, with [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] having vanquished Nomak and the Reapers.&lt;ref name="July"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diary"/&gt;

The game opens with Blade (voiced by Tom Clark) and [[Abraham Whistler|Whistler]] (Don Delciappo) receiving information that a blood exchange is taking place between a [[mafia]] outfit and a [[vampire]] clan in the parking lot of Karkov Towers, a multi-company tower block and possible vampire safe house. Blade arrives just in time to see the exchange, with a suited vampire disappearing into the tower carrying a briefcase. According to Whistler, the briefcase contains a vial of [[DNA]] and must be recovered. Blade fights his way into the tower through the underground car park, and then passes through the "Exploitika" [[nightclub]] before destroying the [[Mainframe computer|computer mainframe]] of a vampire-run company called Nth Phase. Eventually, he finds the vampire with the briefcase, who reveals that the DNA is actually that of Damaskinos, former overlord of the Vampire Nation, and a [[DNA sequencer]] is currently unraveling the DNA. Blade is able to destroy the machine and then meets Whistler on the roof. Whistler gives him a canister of poison, which Blade puts into the ventilation system, killing every vampire in the building.

Upon returning to their base, however, Blade and Whistler discover that their ally, Dr. Grant ([[Kate Magowan]]) has been kidnapped by the Byron vampire clan. Following her [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] signal leads to a [[Metro station|subway station]] where Blade fights his way through the vampires into the [[Sewerage|sewers]], where he is joined by Whistler, who plants a series of bombs. Blade detonates the explosives, and follows the sewers to Gaunt Moor [[History of psychiatric institutions|Asylum]], where the Byrons have taken Grant. Blade rescues her and she explains the vampires are torturing humans so as to capture "[[dark energy]]", an experiment they have called "Project: Vorpal". Blade escorts her out of the building and returns to investigate Vorpal. He discovers the vampires are using the dark energy to attempt to create a super vampire warrior much stronger than even a reaper. However, Blade is able to destroy the [[Incubator (culture)|incubation chamber]] and Grant then reveals the Arcan clan is really behind the project, not the Byrons.

Blade heads to the Arcan's mountain base. He infiltrates the facility and destroys the dark energy storage chambers. He then meets up with Grant, who he escorts to the dark energy receiver. However, before she is able to take it offline she is caught in an explosion. As she dies, she tells Blade he must destroy the core. He heads there, meeting Whistler, who plants a series of bombs. The duo flee the base and set off the explosions, destroying the core and putting an end to Project: Vorpal.

==Development==
''Blade II'' was first announced on January 22, 2001 when [[Activision]] revealed they had partnered with UK based developers [[Mucky Foot Productions]] to produce the game for several as-yet unnamed [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|next generation consoles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/01/22/activision-gets-mucky-for-blade | title=Activision Gets Mucky for Blade | publisher=IGN | date=January 22, 2001 | accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/blade-sequel-announced/1100-2677093/ | title=Blade sequel announced | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | date=January 22, 2001 | accessdate=October 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 2, in an interview with [[IGN]], the game's director, Mike Diskett, revealed the gameplay would be melee-based, but players would also have access to Blade's sword and firearms. Diskett explained that Mucky Foot had pitched a game to Activision called ''Sky Ships''. Activision passed on publishing the game but were impressed with Mucky Foot's work and offered them the ''Blade'' franchise. Diskett also explained the combat system in ''Blade II'' had originally been created for ''Sky Ships'', and revealed the game would be released for PlayStation 2 and Xbox.&lt;ref name="Diskett"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/02/02/mucky-foot-illuminates-blade-ii | title=Mucky Foot Illuminates Blade II | publisher=IGN | date=February 2, 2001 | accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote="Having seen [[Blade (film)|the movie]] we had the idea that ''Blade'' was, in a way, a better game than it is a movie. It's very action based and there isn't much of a story line. It's almost like a mock up of a computer game. Even down to the fact that when the bad guys get killed they actually disintegrate. You don't have corpses lying around. There are so many aspects of it that fit perfectly as a computer game."|source=— Mike Diskett; director&lt;ref name="Diskett"/&gt;}}

The game was officially unveiled on November 20, when Activision announced it was not going to be a direct adaptation of the film, but a stand-alone story which takes place after the events of the film. The 360° combat system was also demonstrated for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/11/20/activision-unsheathes-blade-2 | title=Activision Unsheathes Blade 2 | publisher=IGN | date=November 20, 2001 | accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-reveals-blade-2/1100-2826200/ | title=Activision reveals Blade 2 | last=Ahmed | first=Shahed | publisher=GameSpot | date=November 20, 2001 | accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was next shown at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] in May 2002, where the Rage system was revealed. On May 23, IGN published a full preview. Writer Jeremy Dunham liked the idea of the 360° combat system but found it difficult to get used to, and especially difficult to switch from one target to another. He also found the [[Virtual camera system|camera system]] to have faults, often getting caught behind walls and doors. However, he praised the game for capturing the spirit of the film well (something which he felt the first [[Blade (video game)|game]] had failed to do) and admitted he was looking forward to the final build.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/05/23/e3-2002-blade-ii-hands-on | title=E3 2002: Blade II: Hands-On | last=Dunham | first=Jeremy | publisher=IGN | date=May 23, 2002 | accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="Taking our cue from both of the films, we have successfully recreated all of the elements that people will associate with the films. We've managed to incorporate the unique styling and the films' fast-paced action while still maintaining solid playability."|source=— Fin McGechie; [[Game artist|lead artist]]&lt;ref name="McGechie"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/06/20/blade-ii-interview | title=Blade II Interview | last=Goldstein | first=Hilary | publisher=IGN | date=June 20, 2002 | accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

On June 20, IGN published an interview with [[Game artist|lead artist]] Fin McGechie. He went into detail about the origins of the 360° combat system, which was born from the developers' frustrations with games that allow players to lock onto only one target at a time and force them to manually switch when they want to attack something else.&lt;ref name="McGechie"/&gt;

IGN published another preview on July 26. By this stage, the combat system had been finalized, but writer Hilary Goldstein was unconvinced by it. He criticized the fact that the player couldn't control what type of attack Blade did at any given time (punch, kick, elbow etc.). Instead all that the player could do was control the direction in which he attacked. He also criticized the lack of a lock-on during melee combat, and felt the system in general seemed unfinished; "it sounds simple, but somehow it doesn't translate properly to gameplay as most combat looks more chaotic than it needs to be. With no way to lock onto specific targets in hand-to-hand combat, it can get confusing whom you're attacking. The combat-style, while different, is counter-intuitive to the way gamers are used to enjoying action games. That could mean a whole new style of gameplay for one person, but may be incredibly frustrating for a stubborn old-school gamer like myself."&lt;ref name="July"/&gt;

The game was released in North America on September 3, the same day the film was released on [[DVD]].&lt;ref name="July"/&gt;

''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'}}s Martin Taylor was critical of the combat system, arguing that to achieve combos, the player had to play too slowly: "The way the system is implemented has turned Blade's [[martial arts]] abilities from a brutal dance of death to more of an awkward waltz of confusion." He was also highly critical of the fact that the sword is only accessible in Rage mode, he found the [[Video game graphics|graphics]] average and the voice acting "worryingly bad." He concluded, "''Blade II'' is a missed opportunity. What should have been a good chance for some ''[[Devil May Cry (video game)|Devil May Cry]]''-style combat with fantastic characters and recognizable environments has instead turned out to be an extremely dull and awkward jaunt through some dull levels."&lt;ref name="EuroPS2"/&gt;

[[GameSpy]]'s Kevin Murphy, too, criticized the PS2 version's limited use of the sword: "This ultimately hurts the game, as it's really fun hacking with the sword." He also disliked the combat system; "Players are just pushing the right analog stick around and don't have any control over the actual moves Blade uses, just the direction of his attack. While this is a wonderful control scheme when enemies surround you, it's just not as good as letting the player decide to punch, kick, or throw." He concluded "''Blade II'' isn't all bad. It has its moments and fans of the character will be content, but not overjoyed with the title. Hardcore and casual gamers alike, however, will tire of it very quickly."&lt;ref name="GSpyPS2"/&gt; Steve Steinberg wrote of the Xbox version's combat system, "it probably made more sense in theory than it does in actual application," calling it "the stick version of button-mashing." He also criticized the [[Artificial intelligence|AI]], saying: "The game would have been far better with fewer, but more intelligent, enemies. As it is, it's just you against wave after wave of poorly developed enemies." He concluded, "Ultimately, ''Blade II'' plays more like a [[Platform game|platformer]] for adults than like an action title [...] Clean up some of the rough language, give Blade a big, bulbous, cutesy head, and replace the millions of vampires per level with an equal number of collectible trinkets and you'll have something the [[Nintendo]] crowd can tackle when they're done with the latest ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' romp."&lt;ref name="GSpyXB"/&gt;

[[GameSpot]]'s Jeff Gerstmann said, "''Blade II'' has some of the worst enemy AI so far this year." He was critical of the graphics, the sound and the controls, concluding, "If you find yourself out shopping for some ''Blade II''-related items, take a pass on the game and stick to the movie. Poor AI, dull design, and lackluster presentation all add up to make ''Blade II'' a game that you should definitely skip."&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt;

IGN's Jeremy Dunham said of the PS2 version, "there isn't much to find beyond the horrendous controls and suspiciously bad gameplay." He was critical of the control system, saying "Admirable as the attempt at a new attack system may be, we think that a more traditional method of attack would have been a better way to go." He was also critical of the graphics, and concluded, "''Blade II'' has turned into our most recent poster child for how NOT to make a movie-licensed videogame."&lt;ref name="IGNPS2"/&gt; Hilary Goldstein was equally unimpressed with the Xbox version. He too was critical of the combat system, finding it too limiting: "The combat system seems to be begging for more. Chains, grabs, fluidity. But those things are absent. Because you have to use the thumbstick, and because the thumbstick represents the direction of an attack and the attack itself, combat seems very stilted." He was also critical of the story, missions and AI, referring to the game as "a momentary distraction in video game life."&lt;ref name="IGNXB"/&gt;

===Sales===
''Blade II'' was a commercial failure, selling less than half a million units across both platforms. Its failure was indirectly responsible for the closure of Mucky Foot Productions. When Mucky Foot acquired the ''Blade'' franchise, they had already developed two commercial failures; ''[[Urban Chaos]]'' and ''[[Startopia]]'', both of which had been published by [[Eidos Interactive|Eidos]]. Mucky Foot wanted to make ''Urban Chaos 2'', but Eidos were not especially interested. According to company director [[Gary Carr (video game developer)|Gary Carr]], 

{{quote|Mucky Foot had two [[Strike zone|strikes]]. We weren't actually making money. We were just taking lots of money to make games, which weren't selling lots. We took [the ''Blade''] contract on to kind of - I suppose - keep Mucky Foot alive. At the time, Eidos were turning their back on us - they were starting to retract. We could see them physically retracting from us. We signed the game for our own survival, to some degree.&lt;ref name="Footprints"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/issues/issue_146/4839-Footprints.3 | title=Footprints (Page 3) | last=Gillen | first=Kieron | publisher=''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' | date=April 22, 2008 | accessdate=March 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, because the game had to be ready to ship to coincide with the DVD release of the film in North America, development was rushed, and the game was released before the developers were fully happy with it. After finishing with ''Blade II'', Mucky Foot began work on two more film adaptations; ''[[Bulletproof Monk]]'' for [[Empire Interactive]] and ''[[The Punisher (2004 film)|The Punisher]]'' for [[THQ]]. However, THQ were unimpressed with ''Blade II'', and cancelled ''The Punisher'', which left Mucky Foot in the position of being unable to complete ''Bulletproof Monk'' without letting staff go, which they were unwilling to do. They spent several months re-pitching ''Sky Ships'', the game which had developed into ''Blade II'', to various publishers, but were unable to generate any interest, and the company closed in October 2003.&lt;ref name="Footprints"/&gt;

[[File:Las Vegas Strip.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The [[Las Vegas Strip]] is renowned for its high concentration of casino resort hotels]]

A '''casino''' is a facility which houses and accommodates certain types of [[gambling]] activities. The industry that deals in casinos is called the '''gaming industry'''. Casinos are most commonly built near or combined with hotels, restaurants, retail shopping, cruise ships or other tourist attractions. There is much debate over whether the social and economic consequences of casino gambling outweigh the initial revenue that may be generated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2010/07/29/should-internet-gambling-be-legalized "Should Internet Gambling Be Legalized?"] (July 29, 2010). ''[New York Times]'', Retrieved 7/20/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Some casinos are also known for hosting live entertainment events, such as stand-up comedy, concerts, and sporting events.

==Etymology and usage==
The term "casino" is a confusing linguistic [[false friend]] for translators.

''Casino'' is of [[Italian language|Italian origin]]; the root ''casa'' means a house. The term casino may mean a small country [[villa]], [[Summerhouse (building)|summerhouse]], or [[social club]].&lt;ref name=casitalian&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=William N.|title=Gambling in America: An Encyclopedia of History, Issues, and Society|date=2015|page=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QAI9BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=casino+word+italian+casa+villa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DDO0I9XXek&amp;sig=eaYdPaCRmSGLtEQYWSDD6XzjeGA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwB2oVChMIk8LsiYaxxwIVgowNCh2yOwsl#v=onepage&amp;q=casino%20word%20italian%20casa%20villa&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, the term ''casino'' came to include other public buildings where pleasurable activities took place; such edifices were usually built on the grounds of a larger Italian villa or [[palazzo]], and were used to host civic town functions, including dancing, gambling, music listening, and sports; examples in Italy include [[Villa Farnese]] and [[Villa Giulia]], and in the US the [[Newport Casino]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. In modern-day Italian a ''casino'' is either a brothel (also called ''casa chiusa'', literally "closed house"), a [[mess]], or a noisy environment, while a gaming house is spelt ''casinò'', with an accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50034083?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=casino&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 |title=Casino }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=casitalian/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Preble, Rossi|first1=Keith, Francesco|title=Il vero italiano: Your Guide To Speaking "Real" Italian|date=2014|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IDU3BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=casino+word+italian+noisy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=J6WEIfn4EI&amp;sig=nSQtoePZAyzyfeaa6vHaIF4Kc0E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBWoVChMIgNzOhKyxxwIVDDc-Ch3qSwLA#v=onepage&amp;q=casino%20word%20italian%20noisy&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all casinos were used for gaming. The [[Catalina Casino]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalonball.com/casino.asp |title=Avalon Casino Ballroom |publisher=Avalonball.com |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701101606/http://avalonball.com/casino.asp |archivedate=2009-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a famous landmark overlooking Avalon Harbor on [[Santa Catalina Island, California]], has never been used for traditional games of chance, which were already outlawed in California by the time it was built. The Copenhagen Casino was a theatre, known for the mass public meetings often held in its hall during the [[1848 Revolution]], which made Denmark a [[constitutional monarchy]]. Until 1937, it was a well-known Danish theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kb.dk/en/nb/samling/dra/dra-specialkataloger.html|title=Special catalogues in the Drama Collection |accessdate=2007-07-09 |work=The Royal Library }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hanko Casino in [[Hanko, Finland]]—one of that town's most conspicuous landmarks—was never used for gambling. Rather, it was a banquet hall for the [[Russian nobility]] which frequented this spa resort in the late 19th century and is now used as a restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sailingshipadventures.com/DisplayPages/ItineraryPopUp.cfm?ItineraryID=2135 |title=Itinerary Details |publisher=''sailingshipadventures.com'' |accessdate=August 17, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123080936/http://www.sailingshipadventures.com/DisplayPages/ItineraryPopUp.cfm?ItineraryID=2135 |archivedate=November 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In military and non-military usage in German and Spanish, a ''casino'' or ''kasino'' is an officers' [[mess]].

==History of gambling houses==

The precise origin of gambling is unknown. It is generally believed that gambling in some form or another has been seen in almost every society in history. From the Ancient [[Greeks]] and Romans to Napoleon's [[France]] and Elizabethan [[England]], much of history is filled with stories of entertainment based on games of chance.

The first known European gambling house, not called a casino although meeting the modern definition, was the [[Ridotto]], established in [[Venice]], Italy in 1638 by the [[Great Council of Venice]] to provide controlled gambling during the carnival season. It was closed in 1774 as the city government felt it was impoverishing the local gentry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomassen|first1=Bjørn|title=Liminality and the Modern: Living Through the In-Between|date=2014|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|page=160|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Sd7BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=ridotto+1638+casino&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ycf-bQdcM5&amp;sig=sRJvGUBC40KsjX3kWOI19UYw7Bk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwB2oVChMIr-2H6IOxxwIVC9keCh18tAti#v=onepage&amp;q=ridotto%201638%20casino&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In American history, early gambling establishments were known as [[Western saloon|saloons]]. The creation and importance of saloons was greatly influenced by four major cities: [[New Orleans]], [[St. Louis]], [[Chicago]] and [[San Francisco]]. It was in the saloons that travelers could find people to talk to, drink with, and often gamble with. During the early 20th century in America, gambling became outlawed and banned by state legislation and social reformers of the time. However, in 1931, gambling was legalized throughout the state of [[Nevada]]. America's first legalized casinos were set up in those places. In 1976 [[New Jersey]] allowed gambling in [[Atlantic City]], now America's second largest gambling city.

==Gambling in casinos==

Most jurisdictions worldwide have a minimum [[gambling age]] (16 to 21 years of age in most countries which permit the operation of casinos).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.spotoncasinos.com/news/how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-go-to-a-casino/| title=How Old Do You Have To Be To Go To A Casino? | accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Customers gamble by playing [[casino game|games of chance]], in some cases with an element of skill, such as [[craps]], [[roulette]], [[baccarat (card game)|baccarat]], [[blackjack]], and [[video poker]]. Most games played have mathematically determined [[odds]] that ensure the house has at all times an overall advantage over the players. This can be expressed more precisely by the notion of [[expected value]], which is uniformly negative (from the player's perspective). This advantage is called the ''[[Casino game#House advantage|house edge]]''. In games such as [[poker]] where players play against each other, the house takes a commission called the [[Rake (poker)|rake]]. Casinos sometimes give out complimentary items or [[Comps (casino)|comps]] to gamblers.

''Payout'' is the percentage of funds ("winnings") returned to players.

Casinos in the United States say that a player staking money won from the casino is ''playing with the house's money''.

Video Lottery Machines (slot machines) have become one of the most popular forms of gambling in casinos. {{As of | 2011}} investigative reports have started calling into question whether the modern-day slot-machine is addictive.&lt;ref&gt;

==Design==
Casino design—regarded as a psychological exercise—is an intricate process that involves optimising floor plan, décor and atmospherics to encourage gambling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livecasino.co.uk/resource/casino-design/ Creating Compulsion: An Investigation Into Casino Design, Architecture and Ambience] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104222350/http://www.livecasino.co.uk/resource/casino-design/ |date=November 4, 2013 }}, LiveCasino.co.uk, Retrieved 2/9/2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors influencing gambling tendencies include sound, odour and lighting. Natasha Dow Schüll, an anthropologist at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], highlights the decision of the audio directors at Silicon Gaming to make its slot machines resonate in "the universally pleasant tone of C, sampling existing casino soundscapes to create a sound that would please but not clash".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jun/08/slot-machine-lose-lose-situation S] l [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jun/08/slot-machine-lose-lose-situation ot machines: a lose lose situation] (June 8, 2013).

Dr Alan Hirsch, founder of the Smell &amp; Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago, studied the impact of certain scents on gamblers, discerning that a pleasant albeit unidentifiable odour released by Las Vegas slot machines generated about 50% more in daily revenue. He suggested that the scent acted as an aphrodisiac, causing a more aggressive form of gambling.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.timeoutchicago.com/things-to-do/casinos-gambling/14902383/the-psychology-behind-casino-design The psychology behind casino design] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801080041/http://www.timeoutchicago.com/things-to-do/casinos-gambling/14902383/the-psychology-behind-casino-design |date=2013-08-01 }}", (August 24, 2011).

===Significant sites===
While there are casinos in many places, a few places have become well known specifically for gambling. Perhaps the place almost defined by its casino is Monte Carlo, but other places are known as gambling centers.

====Monte Carlo, Monaco====
{{Main|Monte Carlo Casino}}
[[Monte Carlo Casino]], located in [[Monte Carlo]] city, in [[Monaco]], is a famous casino and a tourist attraction popular with well-off visitors. The casino is mentioned in the song [[The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo (song)|The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo]] as well as [[The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo (film)|the film of the same name]].

Monte Carlo Casino has been depicted in many books, including [[Ben Mezrich]]'s ''[[Busting Vegas]]'', where a group of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] students beat the casino out of nearly $1 million. This book is based on real people and events; however, many of those events are contested by main character [[Semyon Dukach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://thepogg.com/thepogg-interviews-semyon-dukach-mit-card-counting-team-captain/| title=ThePOGG Interviews - Semyon Dukach - MIT Card Counting Team Captain | accessdate=2012-10-11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Monte Carlo Casino has also been featured in multiple [[James Bond]] novels and films.

====Campione d'Italia====
{{Main|Casinò di Campione}}
Casinò di Campione is located in the tiny [[Itay|Italian]] enclave of [[Campione d'Italia]], within [[Canton of Ticino|Ticino]], [[Switzerland]]. The casino was founded in 1917 as a site to gather information from foreign diplomats during the First World War. Today it is owned by the Italian government, and operated by the municipality. With gambling laws being less strict than in Italy and Switzerland, it is among most popular gambling destination besides Monte Carlo. The income from the casino is sufficient for the operation of Campione without the imposition of taxes, or obtaining of other revenue.&lt;ref name=nytehs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/15/enclave-hunting-in-switzerland/ |title=Enclave-Hunting in Switzerland |date=May 15, 2012 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |author=Frank Jacobs}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, the casino moved into new premises of more than {{convert|55000|m2}}, making it the largest casino in Europe.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;https://www.economist.com/news/business/21586616-casinos-are-licence-print-money-right-not-one-losing-streak Gambling: Losing streak&lt;/ref&gt; The new casino was built alongside the old one, which dated from 1933 and has since been demolished.&lt;ref name=nytehs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://como-lake.arounder.com/en/casinos/casino-campione-d-italia | title = Casinó Campione d'Italia | work = Arounder | publisher = VRWAY Communication | accessdate = 2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Macau====
{{Main|Gambling in Macau}}
[[File:Venetian Macau.jpg|thumb|[[The Venetian Macao]]]]
The former [[Portuguese empire|Portuguese colony]] of [[Macau]], a [[Special administrative region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative region]] of [[China]] since 1999, is a popular destination for visitors who wish to gamble. This started in Portuguese times, when Macau was popular with visitors from nearby [[British Empire|British]] [[Hong Kong]], where gambling was more closely regulated. [[The Venetian Macao]] is currently the largest casino in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casino.org/blog/the-worlds-largest-casino/|title=10 Of The World's Largest Casinos: The Biggest Casinos Ever!|date=25 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macau also surpassed Las Vegas as the largest gambling market in the world.

====Estoril, Cascais, Portugal====
{{Main|Casino Estoril}}
[[File:Casino Estoril - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The [[Casino Estoril]], in [[Portuguese Riviera]], is Europe's largest casino by capacity.]]
The [[Casino Estoril]], located in the municipality of [[Cascais]], on the [[Portuguese Riviera]], near [[Lisbon]], is the largest casino in Europe by capacity.

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], it was reputed to be a gathering point for [[spy|spies]], dispossessed [[royal family|royals]], and wartime adventurers; it became an inspiration for [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[James Bond|James Bond 007]] novel ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]''.

====Singapore====

[[Singapore]] is an up-and-coming destination for visitors wanting to gamble, although there are currently only two casinos (both foreign owned), in Singapore. The [[Marina Bay Sands]] is the most expensive standalone casino in the world, at a price of US$8 billion, and is among the [[List of most expensive buildings in the world|world's ten most expensive buildings]]. The [[Resorts World Sentosa]] has the world's largest [[oceanarium]].

====United States====
{{main|Gambling in the United States}}
With currently over 1,000 casinos, the United States has the largest number of casinos in the world. The number continues to grow steadily as more states seek to legalize casinos. 40 states now{{when|date=December 2017}} have some form of casino gambling. Relatively small places such as [[Las Vegas]] are best known for gambling; larger cities such as [[Chicago]] are not defined by their casinos in spite of the large turnover.

The [[Las Vegas Valley]] has the largest concentration of casinos in the United States. Based on revenue, [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] ranks second, and the [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicago region]] third.

Top American casino markets by revenue (2015 annual revenues):&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.americangaming.org/sites/default/files/2016%20State%20of%20the%20States_FINAL.pdf American Gaming Association: State of the States 2016 Report (page 12)], accessed May 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nevada Gaming Control Board]] divides [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]], which is coextensive with the Las Vegas metropolitan area, into seven market regions for reporting purposes.

[[Native American gambling enterprises|Native American gaming]] has been responsible for a rise in the number of casinos outside of Las Vegas and Atlantic City.

==Security==
{{main|Casino security}}
[[File:noidnoentry.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.75|A sign at the [[OLG Casino Thousand Islands|Thousand Islands Casino]]]]
Given the large amounts of currency handled within a casino, both patrons and staff may be tempted to cheat and steal, in collusion or independently; most casinos have security measures to prevent this. [[Security camera]]s located throughout the casino are the most basic measure.

Modern casino security is usually divided between a physical security force and a specialized surveillance department. The physical security force usually patrols the casino and responds to calls for assistance and reports of suspicious or definite criminal activity. A specialized surveillance department operates the casino's [[closed circuit television]] system, known in the industry as the [[Eye in the sky (camera)|eye in the sky]]. Both of these specialized casino security departments work very closely with each other to ensure the safety of both guests and the casino's assets, and have been quite successful in preventing crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamblinginfo.com/6_Casino_Management.htm|title=Casino Management and Operations|publisher=Gambling Info|accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some casinos also have catwalks in the ceiling above the casino floor, which allow surveillance personnel to look directly down, through one way glass, on the activities at the tables and slot machines.

When it opened in 1989, [[The Mirage]] was the first casino to use cameras full-time on all table games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Knightly |first= Arnold M. |date=February 2007 |title=Blink and you'll miss him |journal=Casino City Times|pages=1 |url=http://www.casinocitytimes.com/news/article/casino-business-blink-and-youll-miss-him-164381 |accessdate= 2011-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to cameras and other technological measures, casinos also enforce security through rules of conduct and behavior; for example, players at card games are required to keep the cards they are holding in their hands visible at all times.

==Business practices==
Over the past few decades, casinos have developed many different marketing techniques for attracting and maintaining loyal patrons. Many casinos use a loyalty rewards program used to track players' spending habits and target their patrons more effectively, by sending mailings with free slot play and other promotions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.boston.com/2009-08-27/news/29264771_1_slot-promotions-tribes "Tribes to pay Conn. $25m in slot accord"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512043241/http://articles.boston.com/2009-08-27/news/29264771_1_slot-promotions-tribes |date=2012-05-12 }}, (August 27, 2009). ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', Retrieved July 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crime==
Casinos have been linked to [[organised crime]], with early casinos in Las Vegas originally dominated by the [[American Mafia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/2442c84a-f8e3-11df-99ed-00144feab49a|title=When the mob ruled Vegas|author=Doug McKinlay|date=2010-12-07|publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/from-siegel-to-spilotro-mafia-influenced-gambling-regulation-in-las-vegas/|title=From Siegel to Spilotro, Mafia influenced gambling, regulation in Las Vegas|author=Jeff German|date=2014-03-09|publisher=Las Vegas Review-Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Macau by Triad syndicates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/17/world/asia/macau-dark-side/index.html|title=The dark side of Asia's gambling Mecca|author=Katie Hunt|date=2013-06-18|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11731468|title=Murky world of Chinese high-rollers and organised crime|author=Emma Reynolds|date=2016-10-19|publisher=New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some police reports, incidences of reported crime often double and triple in communities within three years of a casino opening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_742867.html#ixzz1Qbh6hiXF "Gambling addiction leads many down criminal road"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625025307/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_742867.html |date=2011-06-25 }}, [[Jeremy Boren]], (June 19, 2011). ''[[The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'', Retrieved 7/20/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2004 report by the US Department of Justice, researchers interviewed people who had been arrested in Las Vegas and Des Moines and found that the percentage of problem or pathological gamblers among the arrestees was three to five times higher than in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;McCorkle, Richard C., "Gambling and Crime Among Arrestees: Exploring the Link" (July 2004). ''U.S. Department of Justice'. Retrieved 7/20/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been said that economic studies that show a positive relationship between casinos and crime usually fail to consider the visiting population at risk when they calculate the crime rate in casino areas. Such studies thus count the crimes committed by visitors, but do not count visitors in the population measure, and this overstates the crime rates in casino areas. Part of the reason this methodology is used, despite it leading to an overstatement of crime rates is that reliable data on tourist count are often not available.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Douglas M. "Do Casinos Really Cause Crime?" (Jan 2008). ''Econ Journal Watch'' [http://econjwatch.org/articles/do-casinos-really-cause-crime]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Casino Employee Occupational Health and Safety ==
There has been some research into [[Casino Employee Occupational Health and Safety|occupational health issues in the casino industry]]. Particular issues that have been reported on include alcohol abuse, second-hand tobacco smoke, and some musculo-skeletal  problems associated with card-dealing.

A '''casino hotel''' is an establishment consisting of a [[casino]] with temporary lodging provided in an on-premises [[hotel]]. Customers receive the benefits of both gambling facilities and lodging. Since the casino and hotel are located on the same premises, all the gambler's necessities can be provided in one location.

The casino may offer common forms of gambling including [[slot machines]], [[poker]], [[blackjack]], and [[sports betting]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The hotel, which is usually nearby or connected to the casino, provides lodging, food and beverages, [[swimming pools]], [[valet parking]], and other popular hotel services.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In [[gambling]] terminology a '''crimp''' is a bend that has been intentionally made on the corner(s) of a [[playing card]] to facilitate identification. 

A [[card cheat]] will typically bend some of the important cards during the game. Below are just several of the most popular examples.

In [[poker]], for instance, a cheat may ''crimp'' one of the cards to mark off the exact location where he wishes his secret conspirator to cut the deck. Similarly, if the card cheat is not working with a confederate, he may bend one or more cards to force a cut upon an unsuspecting victim. In either case the deck will most likely be cut at the exact predetermined spot in the same way an old book always tends to open at the same page. 

Another poker scenario (also popular in numerous other games) is to ''crimp'' some of the high-value cards during the early rounds. On subsequent rounds the cheat will be able to identify some of those cards during the deal. This enables the cheat to employ a [[second deal]] and deal some of those cards to the desired hand, or simply to identify some of the cards held by other players. In any event, the cheat has a mathematical edge over the other players.

In [[casino]] [[blackjack]] a [[crossroader]] may ''crimp'' all the 10-value cards. this will enable the cheat to sometimes identify the dealer's [[hole card]] (the dealer has one card face up, called the [[upcard|up card]], and one card face down, called the [[hole card]]). In those instances the cheat(s) will know the dealer's total and play their hand(s) accordingly.

'''''Dhaka Racing''''' is a [[3D Racing game|3D car racing game]] developed and published by eSophers Ltd in 2002. Designed by Ashik Noon and Adnan Karim. It is the first 3D game developed in Bangladesh. The game features the streets of [[Dhaka]] as race tracks where you can race with the cars of Dhaka. You can also race with [[rickshaws]].&lt;ref name="hang"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailystarnews.com/magazine/2002/06/03/venture.htm | title=Hang on, it's race time | accessdate=18 May 2014 | newspaper=The Daily Star }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final version of the game has been released at the BCS (Bangladesh Computer Society) Computer Fair, BICC (Bangabandhu International Conference Centre), Agargaon on January 12, 2003. It also received the Best Product Award of that fair from the Honorable President of Bangladesh [[Iajuddin Ahmed]].

== Gameplay ==
The game features some of the famous and busy streets of [[Dhaka]]. Players have to choose one from 8 different vehicles including the traditional Bangladeshi vehicles like [[Rickshaw]], [[Auto rickshaw]] etc. Players can select one from four different locations of Dhaka for racing - Manik Mia Avenue, Chandrima/Zia Uddyan, Ramna Park area and the runway of [[Zia International Airport]], along with a special track from [[Sylhet]] [[Osmani International Airport]] area.&lt;ref name="DS06"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/rising/2006/01/03/special.htm | title=The first 3D game developers of Bangladesh | agency=The Daily Star | accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also an option for playing in different weather conditions. The gameplay also features a separate option called ''Rickshaw Mania'' where the player can have a race as a rickshaw driver against other rickshaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ঢাকার রাস্তায় রিক্সা আর গাড়ির রেস|accessdate=18 May 2014|newspaper=Daily Ittefaq|url=http://dhakaracing.50megs.com/cgi-bin/i/images/Ittefaq20030129.JPG|date=29 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The founders, chief designers and programmers of the game, Ashik Noon and Adnan Karim were only final year students of computer science and engineering at the [[North South University]] during the development of the game. Ashik and Adnan took as many as 500 pictures of various streets of Dhaka to make the game realistic.&lt;ref name="hang" /&gt; The graphics modeling was done through [[Autodesk 3ds Max]] while the game's logic, artificial intelligence, car movement and behavior was programmed on [[Visual C++]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=দুই তরুণের বিস্ময়কর উদ্ভাবন|accessdate=18 May 2014|newspaper=Daily Ittefaq|url=http://dhakaracing.50megs.com/cgi-bin/i/images/IttefaqToththoProjukti20020731.jpg|date=31 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=গাড়ি ছোটান মানিক মিয়া অ্যাভেনিউতে|accessdate=18 May 2014|newspaper=Prothom Alo|url=http://dhakaracing.50megs.com/cgi-bin/i/images/IttefaqToththoProjukti20020731.jpg|date=7 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

Initially, a demo version of the game was released in Mar 2002. Few months later on Jan 12th 2003, the full version came into the market. The game received Best Product award in BCS Computer Fair 2003. To protect it from piracy, the developers later only allowed the game to be downloaded online through payments.&lt;ref name="DS06" /&gt;

Dhaka Race received widespread acclaim and pioneered the 3D gaming industry of Bangladesh. Then [[President of Bangladesh]], Dr. [[A. Q. M. Badruddoza Chowdhury]] gave a special award to Ashik Noon and Adnan Karim for developing the first 3D game in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="hang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DS06" /&gt; ICT Minister of Bangladesh, Dr. [[Abdul Moyeen Khan]] also appreciated the game.

Later this same team developed multiple 3D Games like Bangladesh 71 (a FPS 3D game on the Liberation War of Bangladesh), JPGL Boat Racing Game (a multiple player boat racing game for British American Tobacco, Kolkata Racing (a 3D racing game for Sonolite Multimedia, India) for local and international markets.

In [[sound recording]], '''dubbing''' is the transfer or copying of previously recorded audio material from one medium to another of the same or a different type. It may be done with a machine designed for this purpose, or by connecting two different machines: one to play back and one to record the signal. The purpose of dubbing may be simply to make multiple copies of audio programs, or it may be done to preserve programs{{clarify|reason=programs? Should it be audio?|date=October 2018}} on old media which are deteriorating and may otherwise be lost.  

One type of dubbing device combines two different storage media, such as an audio [[cassette deck]] that incorporates a [[Compact Disc]] recorder. Such a device enables the transfer of audio programs from an obsolete medium to a widely used medium. It may also simply be used to transfer material between two types media which are popular in different settings, so that material originating in one type of environment can be used in another. An example of the latter would be the dubbing of a Digital BetaCam videocassette to DVD.

Another type of dubbing device is designed to rapidly produce many copies of a program. It may combine a single playback unit with multiple recording units to simultaneously create two, four, eight, sixteen, or more copies during the playback of a single original program. This type of device can often perform the copying process at many times the standard playback speed. Typical [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] dubbing decks of either analog ([[Compact cassette|cassette]]) or digital (CD) programs can operate at 48 times the standard playback speed, thus producing complete copies of a program in sixty or ninety seconds. Sometimes this high-speed dubbing incurs some loss of quality compared to the best normal (1×) speed dub.

The [[verb]] "dub" as used here long predates and is unrelated to the [[Jamaica]]n musical style [[dub music]]; the origin of both words stems from the [[dubplate]]. It is also different with the term dubbing, which is mostly a type of [[Grinding (dance)|frottage dance]] usually found in the Caribbean clubs.

==Victor S/8 ==
[[Image:Victor S8 Dubbing.jpg|250px|thumb|Victor S/8 marking]]

Some of the earliest dubbings were made by the Victor Talking Machine Co. In 1916, Victor developed an acoustical dubbing process to create new masters from pressings where damage had occurred to the originals. Such dubbings are marked with the symbol “s/8” stamped in the inner rim. These are occasionally (but not always) noted in the New York files{{Clarify|date=June 2013}}. Pressings made from these dubbed masters are sonically inferior to the originals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://victor.library.ucsb.edu/index.php/resources/detail/57|title=Victor Master Numbering Systems|work=ucsb.edu|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Sundiata Keita''''' or '''''Epic of Sundiata''''' (also referred to as the '''''Sundiata Epic''''' or '''''Sunjata Epic''''') {{IPAc-en|s|ʊ|n|ˈ|dʒ|ɑː|t|ə}} is an [[epic poem]] of the [[Malinke people]] and tells the story of the hero [[Sundiata Keita]] (died 1255), the founder of the [[Mali Empire]].  The epic is an instance of [[oral tradition]], going back to the 13th century and narrated by generations of [[griot]] poets or ''jeliw'' (''djeli'').  There is no single or authoritative version.&lt;ref&gt;Bulman, Stephen P. D. 1997. A checklist of published versions of the Sunjata epic. ''History in Africa'' 24. 71–94.&lt;/ref&gt; Material pertaining to the epic first began to be collected during the early 20th century in [[French Sudan]], notably by the French elite school [[École William Ponty]], resulting in the "modern" version of the tale as considered standard today, as published in "novelistic" form in French translation by [[Djibril Tamsir Niane]] in 1960 (English translation 1965).

==Historical context and significance==
The amount of historicity of the events portrayed in the epic is open to debate.  There are some limited 14th-century Arabic historiographic sources available on the early history and of the Mali Empire, notably the records of [[Ibn Khaldun]].  Therefore, the evidence of oral tradition may be critical in reconstructing the historical events of the period.  Oral tradition necessarily undergoes significant changes over the course of several centuries, but scholars have nevertheless attempted to pinpoint elements in the epic that might reflect historical events.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Conrad |first=David C. |year=1992 |title=Searching for History in the Sunjata Epic: The Case of Fakoli |journal=History in Africa |volume=19 |pages=147–200 |jstor=3171998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Written summaries of the epic existed in Arabic before 1890. During the 1890s, versions of the epic were collected by French officials and published in French and German translation beginning in 1898. Western-educated West Africans began to produce literary versions of the tale beginning in the 1930s. This was notably the case at the French elite school, [[École William Ponty]], which staged a drama based on the story in 1937. This period represents the first interaction of the oral tradition with literacy and modernity, and the transformations undergone by the narrative in the context of the 1937 presentation ... eventually resulted in the form of the epic which became most influential in the 1940s and 1950s, before the first "novelistic" treatment by Niane (1960). The first line-by-line transcription of the epic as told by a griot was made in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Bulman |first=Stephen |year=2004 |contribution= A school for epic?

As an oral historical epic, Sundiata conveys information not only about the history of the Mali Empire, but also about the culture of the Mande ethnic group. Mande family structures had two elements—constructive (''badenya'') or destructive (''fadenya'').{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} ''Fadenya'', or "father-child-ness," is the rivalry between half-siblings, and is represented in the epic of Sundiata by the animosity between Sundiata, son of Sogolon, and Dankaran Touman, son of Sassouma (king Nare Marghan's first wife). The destructive forces of fadenya eventually cause Sundiata and his mother to be exiled from Mali, in the fear that Sassouma would hurt Sogolon's family. ''Badenya'', or "mother-child-ness," is the affection between children of the same mother. This is represented in the epic by the support of Sundiata's sister, Kolonkan, in watching over him against Sassouma's attempts at witchcraft, and by his siblings' later support of him in his battle to reclaim Mali. Maternal support is also important for Sundiata to overcome his physical impairment and begin to walk in response to his mother's pleading. The importance of the mother is underscored by the narrator, who says "the child is worth no more than the mother is worth."&lt;ref&gt;Niane 1965, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, Sundiata needed both the opposing forces of ''fadenya'' and ''badenya'' to fulfill his destiny, indicating that both elements are necessary to Mande culture .

The epic of Sundiata is still an integral part of Mande traditional culture and the story continues to be retold by griots and through masked ritual performances.  Today the epic of Sundiata has also become part of the official [[national mythology]] of the republics of [[Mali]], [[Gambia]], [[Senegal]] and [[Guinea]] and is studied in history lessons in primary school curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Jansen |first=Jan |year=2001 |title=The Sunjata Epic: The Ultimate Version |journal=Research in African Literatures |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=14–46 |jstor=3820580 |doi=10.1353/ral.2001.0016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
In the ''Epic of Sundiata'' (also spelled Son-Jara or Sundjata) [[Naré Maghann Konaté]] (also called Maghan Kon Fatta or Maghan the Handsome) was a Mandinka king who one day received a soothsaying hunter at his court. The hunter predicted that if Konaté married an ugly woman, she would give him a son who would one day be a mighty king. Naré Maghann Konaté was already married to [[Sassouma Berete|Sassouma Bereté]] and had a son by her, [[Dankaran Touman|Dankaran Toumani Keïta]].  However, when two Traoré hunters from the Do kingdom presented him an ugly, hunchbacked woman named Sogolon, he remembered the prophecy and married her. She soon gave birth to a son, Sundiata Keita, who was unable to walk throughout his childhood. Sassouma was jealous of the child and mother and would make fun of Sundiata for his inability to walk and the ugliness he inherited from his mother.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Feremu, Sokana. Sundiata - Short Version.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his physical weakness, the king still granted Sundiata his own [[griot]] at young age; this was in order to have them grow together and provide constant consultation as was custom.&lt;ref&gt;Niane 1965, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the death of Naré Maghann Konaté (c. 1224), his first son, Dankaran Tuman, assumed the throne despite Konaté's wishes that the prophecy be respected. Sundiata and his mother, who now had given birth to two daughters and adopted a second son from Konaté's third wife Namandjé, suffered the scorn of the new king and his mother. After an insult against Sogolon, Sundiata requested an iron rod from the [[blacksmith]] Nounfari, which broke when he tried to use it in order to pull himself upright and walk. Only when he used a branch of S'ra (African baobab or Adansonian tree) was he able to walk. In one version of the epic, Sundiata is able to walk after his father dies and his mother orders him to do so.  He then becomes a great hunter.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nonetheless, the hatred of Sassouma Bereté and Dankaran Toumani Keita soon drove Sundiata, his mother, and his two sisters into exile in the Mema kingdom. In one version of the epic, Sundiata and his mother are not exiled. Sogolon feels that she and her son are in danger because of Sassouma's jealousy and left to keep them safe. Neighboring kingdoms are unwilling to harbor Sundiata and Sogolon in fear of what Sassouma and her son would do, but the Mema people take them in.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While living in the Mema kingdom, Sundiata began to grow "as strong as a lion", and he fought with the greatest general of the Mema people, Moussa Tounkara.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sundiata became such a great warrior to the degree that he was made heir to the Mema throne. However, Sogolon encouraged him to "fulfill his destiny" and return to Mali to become king.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Soumaoro Kanté]], cruel sorcerer king of [[Sosso]], attacked the Mandinka kingdom, causing Dankaran Toumani to take flight in fear. Before reaching Mali, Soumaoro had conquered nine kingdoms in the [[Ghana Empire]]. He was a notoriously cruel leader.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The oppressed Mandinka people then sent for the exiled Sundiata. Forging a coalition of neighboring small kingdoms, Sundiata waged a war against the Sosso, finally Sundiata was later crowned with the title "[[Mansa (title)|Mansa]]," or "king of kings", as the first ruler of the [[Mali Empire]]. He soon set about organizing the nucleus of the empire, presenting the [[Gbara]] of nobles and notables at his coronation with an oral constitution known as the [[Kouroukan Fouga]]. His model for government would guide the empire into greatness.  His exploits have even been compared to those of [[Alexander the Great]] by some [[griots]].&lt;ref&gt;Niane 1965, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was being interviewed by Daniel Kilkelly from [[Digital Spy]] at the [[British Soap Awards]] 2016. He said that the episode would only feature the characters of Ste, Harry and Tony; a special constructed episode dubbed a "three hander".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a795843/hollyoaks-spoilers-ste-hays-special-three-hander-episode/|title=Hollyoaks spoilers: Ste Hay's crystal meth plot will lead to a special three-hander episode|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=29 May 2016|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the show's second "three hander" stylised episode, the first airing in 2011, which focused on the characters of [[Jacqui McQueen]] ([[Claire Cooper]]), [[Rhys Ashworth]] ([[Andrew Moss]]) and [[Gilly Roach]] ([[Anthony Quinlan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title='Hollyoaks' star praises Jacqui, Gilly plot conclusion|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a349825/hollyoaks-star-praises-jacqui-gilly-plot-conclusion/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=16 July 2016|date=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richardson had revealed that the three-hander would feature his character, going cold turkey. Richardson had stated, "We were filming for four days, mainly in Tony's flat, and I had to show Ste in a frantic comedown state, so it was pretty exhausting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a799393/hollyoaks-spoilers-kieron-richardson-reveals-ste-harry-tony-three-hander-details/|title=Hollyoaks spoilers: Kieron Richardson reveals harrowing new details of Ste's three-hander special|work=[[Digital Spy]]|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=28 June 2016|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richardson said in an interview with ''[[What's on TV]]'', "It’s very exciting and intense. We filmed a special episode with just Ste, his boyfriend, Harry [Parry Glasspool] and friend Tony [Nick Pickard] and it was so powerful. I made myself feel poorly for real. It’s unlike any episode of Hollyoaks you’ve ever seen. It’s a bit of a nod to the film Trainspotting. Harry and Tony are trying to fight for Ste’s life. They lock him in the flat to try and stop him getting more drugs and the comedown is horrific. The audience goes through it all with Ste."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/hollyoaks/hollyoaks-news/special-episode-hollyoaks-shows-stes-drugs-hell-tony-harry-fight-life-334550/|title=Kieron Richardson: ‘I made myself feel poorly for real’ in special Hollyoaks episode|work=[[What's on TV]]|last=Gardner|first=Alison|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Radio Times]]'', Richardson was worried about the topic being controversial for the show's timeslot, he said "I am scared. I'm thinking that there might be reshoots because it's too extreme. I've literally gone for it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=David|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-05-29/hollyoaks-kieron-richardson-on-stes-controversial-crystal-meth-storyline---fingers-crossed-it-all-makes-it-onto-the-screen|title=Hollyoaks: Kieron Richardson on Ste's controversial crystal meth storyline - "Fingers crossed it all makes it onto the screen"|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=29 May 2016|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
"Episode 4429" appeared in an article published via Digital Spy. It compiled ten unmissable soap storylines airing the week the episode was broadcast. Their reporter, Kilkelly, warned that viewers could expect harrowing scenes in the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/feature/a800869/soap-spoilers-eastenders-coronation-street-emmerdale-hollyoaks-10-big-moments-july-11/|title=Soap spoilers: 10 big moments that you have to see this week|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=11 July 2016|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richardson received a considerable amount of praise via the social networking website [[Twitter]]. His performance mostly drew an emotional reaction from viewers conversing on the platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a801257/hollyoaks-fans-praise-kieron-richardson-for-emotional-three-hander-episode/|title=Hollyoaks fans praise Kieron Richardson for emotional three-hander episode|work=[[Digital Spy]]|last=Davies|first=Megan|date=13 July 2016|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duncan Lindsay of ''Metro'' said "Hollyoaks is often regarded as the underdog of the soap world – without much justification – but continually proves that it can deliver high octane and powerful drama as well as its rivals. The three hander on E4, led by emotive performances from Kieron Richardson, has shown, once more, that it deserves far more credit."&lt;ref name="proven"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/07/13/how-the-hollyoaks-special-has-proven-that-the-soap-deserves-far-more-credit-6004936/|title=How the Hollyoaks special has proven that the soap deserves far more credit|last=Lindsay|first=Duncan|date=13 July 2016|accessdate=14 July 2016|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsay went on to say "the episode flew by and left us gripped from start to finish."&lt;ref name="proven"/&gt; While he added "The effective episode has revealed that Hollyoaks deserves the credit it gets but also highlights that living in the shadows of its equally strong counterparts remains the biggest injustice in the soap world."&lt;ref name="proven"/&gt; Lindsay had earlier stated "With secrets from the past coming out, big decisions made and Ste at an all time low, it’s an unmissable visit to Hollyoaks that will answer the following questions. Will Ste come out the other side? Will Harry stand by him? Will the truth about Cameron’s involvement come out?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/07/05/hollyoaks-spoilers-all-over-for-ste-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-special-episode-that-sees-him-hit-rock-bottom-5979630/|title=Hollyoaks spoilers: All over for Ste?

Carl Greenwood of ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' stated "Hollyoaks has made history with its first three-hander episode."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwood|first=Carl|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/hollyoaks-makes-history-harrowing-three-8415624|title=Hollyoaks makes history with harrowing three-hander episode as Ste Hay's crystal meth addiction is tackled|work=Daily Mirror|date=13 July 2016|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenwood also reported that "fans praise 'incredible' Kieron Richardson after emotionally powerful performance moves them to tears."&lt;ref name="moved"/&gt; He also stated, "Actor Kieron Richardson knocked his performance out of the park as Ste as he veered from begging for help and viciously attacking his loved ones for trying to keep him from getting his next fix."&lt;ref name="moved"&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwood|first=Carl|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/hollyoaks-fans-praise-incredible-kieron-8416465|title=Hollyoaks fans praise 'incredible' Kieron Richardson after emotionally powerful performance moves them to tears|work=Daily Mirror|date=13 July 2016|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

You really mustn’t miss this!"&lt;ref name="five"/&gt;

'''''Everywhere'''''{{efn|Working title}} (stylized '''EVERYWHERƎ''') is an upcoming [[open world]] video game.

== Gameplay ==
Multiple narratives will be presented so that each player can customize of their own volition. It is set in an [[open world]] environment,&lt;ref name="open world" /&gt; and will feature seamless [[cooperative multiplayer]].&lt;ref name="real life" /&gt;

== Development ==
Conceptualized in 2016, the game started development with a team of three ex-[[Rockstar North]] employees – [[Leslie Benzies]], Matthew Smith and Colin Entwistle – numbering about thirty staff by January 2017. ''Everywhere'' is being developed using the game engine [[Amazon Lumberyard]] from studios based in [[Edinburgh]], [[Budapest]] and [[Los Angeles]]. It is created with the intention of offering a less restrictive experience than that of other games. The game draws most of its influence from [[real life]], according to Benzies.&lt;ref name="real life" /&gt;&lt;ref name="budapest" /&gt;

A '''false ending''' has two contexts: in literature, film and video games it is a narrative device where the plot seems to be heading to its conclusion, but in reality, there's still more to the story; in a musical composition, however, it is a complete stop of the work or song for one or more seconds before continuing.

The presence of a false ending can be anticipated through a number of ways: the medium itself might betray that it isn't the true ending (i.e. it's only halfway into a book or a song, a film's listed running time hasn't fully elapsed, only half the world has been explored in a video game, etc.), making only stories with indeterminate running length or a multi-story structure able to pull this off effectively; another indicator is the feeling that too much of the story is incomplete when the false ending comes, making it feel like there has to be more.

==Film==

In ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'' , it seems like the criminal case that the movie revolves around is completely closed with no loose ends until one of the witnesses admits that she lied about important details to give more importance towards the trial of the people who raped her, exposing a cover-up conspiracy. In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', the director keeps using editing techniques that are indicative of endings in scenes that could be used as such, but continues until the movie finally ends. ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' has two false endings. Another example is in ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', where, at a very climatic stage in the film, the screen fades away and says ''[[Cliffhanger|To be continued]]'', which is then followed by the word "Immediately."

Some movies come to a formal ending, followed by the rolling of the credits, which is almost universally used to indicate that the film has ended, only to have the actors reappear in one or more [[mid-credits scene]]s. In comedy films, these sequences may be [[blooper]]s or [[outtake]]s. In other types of films, the mid-credit scenes may continue the narrative set out in the movie. The [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] movies have become notorious for this, in some cases featuring a mid-credits scene and an end-credits scene in the same movie.

In the police comedy ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'' (2007), two police officers realize that a cult is controlling their town. After the two officers defeat the head of the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance and his members, who have been causing problems in the town, the pair are celebrating their success at the police station, and the movie appears to be wrapping up. Then a surviving member of the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance enters the station and shoots an old musket, which triggers an old-fashioned mine.

==Television==

==Video games==
Some examples in video games include ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'' and ''[[Wild ARMs]]''. Both involve confrontations with the major antagonists at what seems like their final lairs, but instead a crisis occurs and the story continues. A third is in ''[[Naval Ops: Warship Gunner]]'', upon sinking the ''Druna Skass'' a second time (Which can only happen if the player plays though the game again, as the game resets itself to the beginning if you sink it once), the player is greeted by another supership, that looks just like the ''Druna Skass''. Yet another example is the [[survival horror]] game ''[[Obscure II]]'', in which the player must wait until the credits roll to their conclusion before gameplay resumes.

[[Role-playing video game]]s are notorious for having such plot devices. It usually involves the game's main antagonist being defeated, only for a previously mentioned character to be revealed as the "real" villain. One example is ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]]'', in which the main character is apparently about to have a boss fight with the former villain Zant, but Zant reveals he has been working for another Villain.
Another example is "[[Kid Icarus: Uprising]]" where after you defeat Medusa, credits roll but are quickly interrupted by Hades, the villain for the rest of the game.

In video games, it is difficult to use the false ending device effectively. Nevertheless, in the hands of a skilled designer, there are several methods that allow it to be done. In several video games, such as those with multiple playable characters and story lines, the game may appear to end after defeating a difficult boss, or clearing what appears to be the "Final" level, complete with credits, an [[Closing credits|outro]], and a return to the start screen. These endings are different from bad endings, as everything may appear to be resolved. However, fulfilling conditions such as clearing all the storylines, reloading the save file, or reaching the "ending" in a [[New Game+]] mode may give the player the option to continue on to the real ending.

An example of this is ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'', and its sequel ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]''. In the former, while there are six stories to play, only the main character's, [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character) | Sonic's]] is the most complete. The other characters' stories are simply side-stories. However, if "all" of the stories are completed, a final story appears that wraps up the game and acts as the "true" ending. In the latter, there are two stories to play, one for the heroes, and one for the villains. Of note is the plot device is hidden in a false [[Chaos Emerald]] being used that would destroy the space colony in which the villain [[Doctor Eggman]] is using as a base. It is at first implied that Eggman took the false Emerald, but in reality, when the last story is played, again, after the two normal stories are completed, a true conclusion is offered.

Another example could be the survival horror game ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'', where, depending on your choice, you get to play with one of the two characters and get a certain ending for one of them to later discover, when you finish playing the second path with the second character, you fight the real final boss and the "true" ending (That may vary depending of which character you have chosen first) is shown. The main difference between both of the "true" endings are that places and times are exchanged, as well as the final dialogue from the game.

''The Consequence'', the second Kidman DLC for 2014's ''[[The Evil Within]]'', features a secret false ending in a similar manner to those shown in the ''Resident Evil'' franchise. At one point, Juli Kidman encounters the brain of the game's main antagonist, Ruben Victoriano, sealed [[Brain in a jar|inside a glass container]] hooked up to the STEM system in Beacon Hospital. Should the player choose to shoot the container and break it, the game cuts to black, then begins the credits sequence, cutting short on a postcard depicting Juli, Joseph and Sebastian on a postcard, before promptly returning to the game as Kidman exclaims "What the fuck?!", indicating the whole sequence was a hallucination.

==Music==
False endings are a known device in classical music. [[Josef Haydn]] was fond of them, for example inducing applause at the wrong place in the finales of his [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)#Fourth_movement|String Quartet, Op. 33 No. 2]] (nicknamed "The Joke")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2009/may/29/haydn-playful-composer-tom-service |title=Haydn composed existential comedy |first=Tom |last=Service |authorlink=Tom Service |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=29 May 2009 |accessdate=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Symphony No. 90 (Haydn)|Symphony No. 90]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sarahhicksconductor.com/web/buzz_details.aspx?ItemId=554184 |title= Haydn’s Head Fake |date=16 May 2010 |first=Sarah |last=Hicks |authorlink=Sarah Hicks |accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first movement of [[Prokoviev]]'s [[Classical Symphony]] contains false endings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/artist/composition/4176 |title=Symphony No. 1 in D major, Op. 25, "Classical" |first=Richard |last=Rodda |website=[[Kennedy Center]] |accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unsourced|section|date=February 2018}}
In music, a number of [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]] [[song]]s use false endings in which the music is arranged so that the song appears to be coming to its ending (e.g., reaching a final [[Cadence (music)|cadence]] on the [[tonic (music)|chord of the home key]] and then stopping), but then the music recommences. Examples include [[The Rascals]]' "[[Good Lovin']]"; [[The Four Tops]]' "[[Bernadette (Four Tops song)|Bernadette]]", "[[White Room]]" by [[Cream (band)|Cream]]; "[[The Peace!]]" by [[Morning Musume]]; "[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]" by [[Led Zeppelin]]; "[[Rain (Beatles song)|Rain]]" by [[The Beatles]]; "[[Monday, Monday]]" by [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]]; and "[[But You Know I Love You]]" by [[The First Edition (band)|The First Edition]]. Another notable example of a musical false ending is "[[(Everything I Do) I Do It for You]]" by [[Bryan Adams]] - because the original song was six and a half minutes long, the false ending became the end of the single/video edit of the song (the album version had a fadeout ending).

In addition, several other songs have also had false endings, such as "[[Angels (Amy Grant song)|Angels]]" by [[Amy Grant]], a #1 Christian hit in 1984. Another example is "[[Keep on Dancing (The Gentrys song)|Keep On Dancing]]", a 1965 Top 10 hit for the group [[The Gentrys]] from Memphis, Tennessee. In both songs, there is a pause of two seconds before the music starts all over again. Also, "[[When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)]]" by [[The Beach Boys]], has a sudden stop and resumes 1 second later as the band counts numbers of years of age until the song fades, counting from 19 to 30. The [[Alice in Chains]] track "Rain When I Die" has a fade-out false ending lasting about 20 seconds, then the music comes back, and then it fades once more, thus providing the real ending. "[[Weather with You]]" by [[Crowded House]] appears to be ending and then another small instrumental is followed by a final chorus.

The '''Gambia Radio &amp; Television Service''' is the national broadcaster of the West African state of [[the Gambia]]. Gambia Radio &amp; Television Service currently broadcasts in [[English language|English]] and native local languages.

==History==
The history of GRTS stems from the [[merger]]ship of the older and more established [[Radio Gambia]] and the rather recent Television Channel.

Radio Gambia was the first media [[Broadcasting|broadcaster]] in the Gambia, opened in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alhaji Alieu Ebrima Cham Joof|Joof, Alhaji Alieu Ebrima Cham]], ''"The calendar of historical events in the Gambia, 1455 - 1995"'', p 13, (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Its historical base is [[Bakau]] (a town in the Gambia).

In December 1995, GRTS was commissioned by the Gambian government which began test transmissions under the [[Gamtel|Gambia Telecommunications Company]] (Gamtel). In 1996, it adopted its own television channel. The Station operates as a [[public service]] station based on the tradition of Radio Gambia. The Station's programmes are mostly news, public service announcements, education, entertainment and religious related ([[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] only, mostly Islam and nothing on [[Traditional African religion]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grts.gm/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=22&amp;Itemid=53|title=GRTS – Gambia Radio and Television Services|website=www.grts.gm|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2010, the Station was awarded the ''National Order of the Republic of the Gambia'' with the rank of ''"Commander"'' (CRG).&lt;ref&gt;[[The Daily Observer]] : [http://observer.gm/africa/gambia/article/national-award-recipients-approved National Award recipients approved] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104095532/http://observer.gm/africa/gambia/article/national-award-recipients-approved |date=2015-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44534">The '''history of Hungarian animation''' begins in 1914 and carries through to the modern day. Starting with short promotional cartoons prior to the two World Wars, Hungarian animation underwent a sporadic and halting development during the turbulent war years which were characterized in large part by the emigration of much of the field's top talent. This exodus slowed dramatically during the 1950s when the [[Hungarian Communist Party]] took power and the [[Iron Curtain]] took shape.

With Communism came nationalization of the Hungarian animation studio—a fact that was to prove a mixed blessing for the nascent industry. While political pressures would strongly dictate the kinds of topics that animation could cover in the early years, state funding meant that even the relatively small postwar nation would be able to prove itself on the international stage.&lt;ref&gt;Hankiss, Elemér. ''[http://www.filmkultura.hu/regi/2000/articles/essays/dizsreri.hu.html A kiválóság szigete]''. FilmKultúra. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dizseri&gt;Dizseri, Eszter. ''Kockáról kockára : a magyar animáció krónikája 1948-1998''. Balassi Kiadó. Budapest. 1999. {{ISBN|978-963-506-289-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, subsequent to the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 revolution]], the softening effects of [[Goulash Communism]] helped enable artists to begin to express themselves such that by the late 1970s, Pannónia Film Stúdió would rank among the top 5 major cartoon studios alongside [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney]], [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Soyuzmultfilm]], and [[Toei Animation|Toei]].&lt;ref name=lendvai&gt;Lendvai, Erzsi. ''[http://www.filmkultura.hu/regi/articles/essays/anim.hu.html A magyar animációs film]'' (English: "[https://web.archive.org/web/20080208021418/http://www.filmkultura.iif.hu:8080/articles/essays/anim.en.html Animated cartoons in Hungary]"). FilmKultúra. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the end of Communism in 1989, state control of the animation industry dropped away and market forces prompted the rise of numerous independent animation studios. Lacking state funding and receiving mixed international response, Hungarian animation studios today have had to develop financing strategies consisting largely of working as production and development companies performing labor-intensive animation activities such as compositioning and inking for foreign studios. Despite this, Hungarian films continue to be produced every few years.

==Overview==
The history of Hungarian animation extends from its origin in István Kató Kiszly's 1914 cut-out caricatures to the modern time. Although a few boldly experimental films were made in the early years, it would not be until the 1930s that actual animation studios would be formed (under figures like [[Gyula Macskássy]] and [[János Halász]]) to produce promotional material in the form of [[newsreel]]s and advertisements. International conflicts during both world wars as well as turbulent political climates in the pre-[[Iron Curtain]] period led to the emigration of many of Hungary's animation artists who famously established themselves in places like France, the U.K., and America. During the Communist era, all animation efforts are nationalized first as Magyar Szinkronfilmgyártó Vállalat in 1948 and later as [[Pannónia Film Stúdió]] in 1959. State control of animation on the one hand constrained artistic freedom of expression while simultaneously ensuring the survival of the medium.&lt;ref name=lendvai/&gt;

During the 1950s, the first modern generation of Hungarian animators came to prominence, creating primarily short animations depicting the Hungarian folk tales and legends that would be a politically safe mainstay of Hungarian animation output throughout the Communist era. This generation would be responsible for creating the first colored animation. A second generation of animators would emerge in the 1960s under the less repressive system of [[Goulash Communism]], and sociopolitical sentiment was for the first time gently hinted at as cartoons developed philosophical themes characterized by morbidity and black humor. Foreign animation studios began to reach out to Pannónia Film Stúdió during this period to subcontract some of the more laborious elements of cartoon production such as compositioning and inking. This introduced the concept of cartoon series/serials, and soon a number of Hungarian serials were created introducing the country's first recognizable cartoon character stars. This period also saw the production of the first [[adult animation]]. The 1970s saw the rise of a third generation of animators even more intent on commentary on the social conditions in the country. Animations during this period were often marked by a muted subsurface emphasis on anxiety and a claustrophobic fear of persecution while the animation works of older (first and second generation) animators tended to emphasize morality and a development of the grotesque. This third generation would see the emergence of the country's first feature-length films as Pannónia Film Stúdió rose to international renown as one of the top 5 major cartoon studios alongside [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney]], [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Soyuzmultfilm]], and [[Toei Animation|Toei]].&lt;ref name=lendvai/&gt;

The 1980s would prove to be a peak of Hungarian animation efforts. Increasingly bold use of irony and allegory portrayed the Hungarian condition under Communist rule and during this period a number of Hungarian films received high accolades and prestigious awards including [[Ferenc Rofusz]]' 1981 Oscar for ''[[A Légy]]'' ("The Fly").&lt;ref name=howard&gt;Howard, Doug. ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20090312002759/http://www.amcham.hu/BusinessHUngary/15-01/articles/15-01_28.asp Beyond the frames: Will this art survive?]''. Business Hungary. Vol.15, No.1. American Chamber of Commerce in Hungary. January 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The decade would also mark a renaissance in technical experimentation with the exploration of many non-traditional graphic media such as plasticine, sand, coal, textiles, and computer animation. During this period the first feature-length films based on serials were created and proved to be quite popular.&lt;ref name=lendvai/&gt; In 1989, Communist rule was cast off and with it State control of the animation arts in 1990. Due to free market pressures, a number of independent animation studios sprang up in the wake. The novel issue of commercial financing proved to be a complex one as new studios struggled to make ends meet. A variety of solutions were adopted ranging from the active courting of foreign contract work, to specialization in the labor-intensive traditional hand-animation forms, to employee ownership.&lt;ref name=howard/&gt; In 2002, the new Hungarian government began to take a role in the medium as well with funding from the Ministry of National Cultural Heritage going toward the development of further animations of Hungarian folk tales and legends which since the Communist era have become a source of national pride.&lt;ref name=howard/&gt;

==Pre-animation history==
*1709 - Professor István Simándi of [[Sárospatak]] assembled and used his own projector (a variant of the [[magic lantern]]) for educational purposes. With this machine Simándi aimed to bring about the same animation effect as [[Transparency (projection)|transparencies]] do today.&lt;ref&gt;Bartók, István. Kőszeghy, Péter, ed.

*1889 - Hungarian-born Adolph Cukor (better known as [[Adolph Zukor]]) emigrates to the United States where he becomes invested in cinema in 1903. By 1912, Cukor established [[Famous Players Film Company]] which in turn became [[Famous Players-Lasky]] and eventually [[Paramount Pictures]]. As president of Paramount, Zukor produced numerous [[Color Classics]] cartoons during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;James, Ryan.

The earliest period of Hungarian animation was marked by experimentation and the development of the first animation studio headed by pioneers, [[Gyula Macskássy]] and [[János Halász]].&lt;ref name=beckerman&gt;Beckerman, Howard. ''Animation: the whole story''. Allworth Press. 1 September 2003. {{ISBN|978-1-58115-301-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animations were primarily promotional in nature although throughout the 1930s more and more complex narrative structures were developed. Between 1932 and 1945, 150 promotional cartoons are produced including ''Családi kávépótló'' ("Family Coffee Substitute"), ''Estétől reggelig'' ("Evening to Morning"), ''A láthatatlan vendég'' ("Invisible Visitor"), ''Zeusz inkognitóban'' ("Zeus in Cognito"), ''Vidám suszterinas'' ("The hilarious shoemaker's boy"), ''Szerencsés flottás'' ("Lucky Jim"), and ''Izzó szerelem'' ("Glowing Love")&lt;ref name=lendvai/&gt;&lt;ref name=koltai&gt;Koltai, Ágnes.

*Late 1930s - Hungarian animation within Hungary continues through the efforts of animators like István Balogh, Viktor Kálmán, Félix Kassowitz, and István Valker.

==Modern animation==

===First generation animation===
Folktale animation is common and this period sees a rise in Hungarian animation establishing such animators as [[József Nepp]], [[Attila Dargay]], Tibor Csermák, Gábor Kovásznai, József Gémes, Szabolcs Szabó, György Várnai, [[Marcell Jankovics]], Péter Szoboszlay, [[Zsolt Richly]], [[Sándor Reisenbüchler]], Béla Vajda, Tamás Szabó Sipos, János Mata, and also puppet animators like Ottó Foky and István Imre.&lt;ref name=lendvai/&gt;

*1941-1951 - Gyula Macskássy and Edit Fekete create the first color animation, ''A kiskakas gyémánt félkrajcárja'' ("The Little Cock's Diamond Halfpenny").&lt;ref name=kowe/&gt; The film begins life as a black and white production in the Cartoon and Puppet Department of the wartime Newsreel and Documentary Studios, but due to delays relating to the war, the film isn't completed until 1951.

===Second-generation animation===
Foreign animation teams begin to reach out to Pannónia Film Studio as a way to cut costs on some of the more labor-intensive aspects of cartoon production. In domestic productions, however, with the artistic community under strain from an authoritarian Communist government, morbidity and black humor become more common as cartoons were used to hint at and reflect the philosophy and conditions of the day. Due to Western influence, such cartoon serials emerged as Gyula Macskássy and György Várnai's ''Peti és a gépember'' ("Peti and the Robot"), ''Marci és a Cső'' ("Marci in the Jungle"), ''Vili és Bütyök'' ("Vili and Bütyök"), ''Üzenet a jövőből'' ("Messages from the Future"), ''[[Kérem a következőt!]]'' ("Next, Please!"), ''Varjúdombi mesék'' ("Tales from Crow Hill"), Tamás Szabó Sipos's ''Magyarázom...'' ("Let Me Explain..."), and Ottó Foky's ''Egy világhírű vadász emlékiratai'' ("The Magic Snake"). With the emergence of cartoon serials came the country's first recognizable cartoon character stars such as Gergő, Peti, Gustav, [[Frakk]], Kukori and Kotkoda, Mirr-Murr, Elek Mekk, Dr. Bubó, Mikrobi, [[Kockásfülű nyúl]], TV Maci, and [[Mézga család]], each of whom featured in several cartoons. Animation for adult entertainment also emerged during this period with such series as Gyula Macskássy and György Várnai's ''Ember és ember'' ("Man and Human").&lt;ref name=lendvai/&gt;&lt;ref name=wright/&gt;
* 1961 – [[József Nepp]] creates ''Szenvedély'' ("Passion").
* 1961 – Tibor Csermák creates ''A piros pöttyös labda'' ("The Ball with White Dots"),&lt;ref name=wright/&gt; which wins the 1961 [[Venice Film Festival]] [[Golden Lion]] for best Children's Film.&lt;ref name=kowe/&gt;

* 1970 - Gyula Macskássy creates ''Az öngyilkos'' ("Self-Destroyer")

===Third generation animation===
With the artistic community still under government pressure, a third generation of films is marked by a muted subsurface emphasis on anxiety and a claustrophobic fear of persecution. Older (first and second generation) animators tended to emphasize morality and a development of the grotesque.&lt;ref name=lendvai/&gt;

*1970-1971 - Marcell Jankovics creates ''Mással beszélnek'' ("The Line is Engaged").

===The 1980s===
A decade considered to have been responsible for the peak of Hungarian animation, the 1980s would see increasingly bold use of irony and allegory in portraying the Hungarian condition under Communist rule and would mark a renaissance in technical experimentation with the exploration of many non-traditional graphic media. Of particular note, several new experimental serials emerged during this period including Sándor Békési's ''Vázák meséi'' ("Tales of Vases"), Csaba Varga's ''Szekrénymesék'' ("The Wardrobe's Tales"), and plasticine animations including Csaba Varga's ''Auguszta'' ("Augusta") and [[Ferenc Cakó]]'s ''Zénó''.

===Current animation industry===
The end of the century saw the end of Communism in Hungary. Although state support for Hungary's one animation studio (Pannónia Film Stúdió) came to an end, the free market quickly prompted the development of a number of independent animation studios. In order to gain funding in the absence of the state, studios such as [[Kecskemétfilm|Kecskemétfilm Kft]] turn to employee ownership strategies while other studios work primarily as contractors for foreign markets doing work such as compositioning and inking.&lt;ref name=dizseri/&gt;&lt;ref name=howard/&gt; Yet other studios such as the American-Hungarian joint venture [[Studio 2 (Hungary)|Studio 2]] have focused instead on traditional hand-drawn cell animation techniques to preserve this now niche animation style. Among other animation studios that were founded since the withdrawal of state control are included Pannónia rajzfilmgyártók, Videovox, Funny Film, Animex, Dana Film, Reflex, Puppet Film, Aladin stúdió, Firka, and the German-Hungarian joint venture Loonland. Several feature-length films have been released since the late 1980s including ''Albert mondja...'' ("Albert Says...") and ''Majmok kastélya'' ("Monkey Castle") among others. Animators who have risen to prominence since the end of the Communist era include Péter Szoboszlay, László Hegyi Füstös, Mária Horváth, Líviusz Gyulai, István Orosz, [[Dóra Keresztes]], László Haris, Péter Molnár, Zoltán Szilágyi Varga, Árpád Miklós, Gizella Neuberger, Béla Weisz, and László Ujváry.&lt;ref name=lendvai/&gt;

It was featured on the ''Complex City Guide'' list of "50 Best Concert Venues of America" in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kimble|first=Jillian|title=The 50 Best Concert Venues In America|url=http://www.complex.com/city-guide/2013/05/the-50-best-concert-venues-in-america/irving-plaza|work=Complex City Guide|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Polish Army veterans==
The building was purchased by the Polish Army Veterans of America District 2 in 1948, and turned into a Polish-American community center. Generals and other distinguished Poles graced its stage including, in 1976, the future [[Pope John Paul II]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1976/09/05/archives/polish-cardinal-warmly-greeted-wojtyla-winds-up-his-tour-of-the-us.html "Polish Cardinal Warmly Greeted; Wojtyla Winds Up His Tour of the U.S. in New York"] ''[[New York Times]]'' (September 5, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rock venue==
In 1978, the hall was converted to a [[rock music|rock]] music venue by future [[Peppermint Lounge]] promoters Tom Goodkind and Frank Roccio, who after a year began to share promotional efforts with a "Club 57" crew headed by Jane Friedman and Louis Tropia.&lt;ref&gt;Rockwell, John. [http://squattheatre.com/article04m.html "After Politics, There's Rock, Disco or Pop Clubs to Visit"] ''[[New York Times]]'' (August 8, 1980) -"Two organizations book concerts into the facility, with two different telephone numbers."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/273446431.html?dids=273446431:273446431&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+02%2C+2003&amp;author=Thomas+S.+Goodkind.&amp;pub=Newsday+%28Combined+editions%29&amp;desc=Survivors+of+the+Downtown+Scene%2C+Unite&amp;pqatl=google | title=Survivors of the Downtown Scene, Unite | first=Thomas S. | last=Goodkind | date=2003-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodkind and Roccio brought in acts such as the [[B-52s]], [[Talking Heads]], the [[Ramones]] and, with Friedman and Tropia, a wealth of British bands, establishing the venue as a premier American location for [[punk rock|punk]] and [[New wave music|new wave]].

The venue was reopened by Chuck Terzella in October 1983,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Pareles |last=Jon |authorlink=Jon Pareles |coauthors= |title=Rock: Devoto at Irving Plaze|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/05/arts/rock-devoto-at-irving-plaza.html |work= |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=October 5, 1983 |accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; with management by Frank Gallagher and the English DJ Andy Dunkley,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/music/human-85.php |title=Human Jukebox |accessdate=2010-03-24 |last=Christgau |first=Robert|coauthors= |date= Jan 8, 1985 |publisher=Village Voice,}}&lt;/ref&gt; presenting [[reggae]] and other ethnic music, plus [[college rock]], proclaiming in their ads "We don't have video".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ephemeralnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/irvingplazaad1984.jpg |format=JPG |title=Display ad in the ''East Village Eye'' c.

Chris Williamson, who already promoted the punk and hard rock oriented "Rock Hotel" nights at the Ritz, then took over in November 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonicyouth.com/mustang/cc/sy112286.jpg Poster for Sonic Youth show November 22, 1986]&lt;/ref&gt; He began programming [[alternative rock]] occasionally using the designation "Rock Motel". A New Year's Eve Rock Hotel show with [[The Dictators]] turned nasty after the band initiated a food fight and a bouncer lost his cool and beat some patrons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HxsQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QIsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3475,425030&amp;dq=irving-plaza+-display-ad+-classified-ad+-harlem&amp;hl=en "Stop Breaking Down"] ''[[The Village Voice]]'' (January 13, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Plans by the Polish Veterans to convert the building to condos fell through. They had to spend $25,000 on bringing the venue up to firecode before, in April 1987, Chris Williamson re-opened the club, featuring improved sound and lights, with an inaugural multi-night stand of [[Big Audio Dynamite]]&lt;!--number of nights disputed:see talk--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://andwhatsnext.com/bands/80s-artists/big-audio-dynamite/bowie-frampton-jimmy-cliff-dave-stewart-and-big-audio-dynamite |title=Bowie, Frampton, Jimmy Cliff, Dave Stewart and Big Audio Dynamite |accessdate=2010-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="curtains"&gt;{{cite news| title=Curtains|first=David|last= Browne| work=City Lights|publisher=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|date=December 25, 1988| url=https://archive.org/download/DailyNewscurtains-Dec251988/IrvingPlazacurtainsDailyNews.gif}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williamson continued putting on shows into 1988—including hosting the popular "Milky Way" [[hip hop]] nights—but, as Irving Place gentrified, there was increasing local opposition to the hall. A plan by Williamson to present a play in the winter of 1988 fell through and, in December 1988, it was announced that the club would close and be demolished and turned into condos.&lt;ref name="curtains" /&gt; The last show was The Ramones on December 31, 1988. Dee Dee Ramone praised the venue: "It was funky without being a dump."&lt;ref name="curtains" /&gt;

Ron Delsener took on management in the early 1990s. [[Live Nation]], a spinoff of [[Clear Channel Communications]], renovated and reopened Irving Plaza under the name "Fillmore New York At Irving Plaza" on April 11, 2007, reviving the name of the former [[Fillmore East]] in Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]], which had been open from 1968 to 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E6DE1130F933A05750C0A9619C8B63|title=Arts, Briefly; New Name for Irving Plaza|work=[[New York Times]]|date=March 30, 2007|accessdate=2009-06-14|last=Sisario|first=Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in May 2010 Live Nation conceded that the new name had not caught on and due to "unrelenting demand" the name "Irving Plaza" would be restored as from June 23, 2010. A replica of the original [[Marquee (sign)|marquee]] has been commissioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/01/arts/music/01irving.html|title=Rethinking, Irving Plaza Keeps Its Maiden Name |last1=Sisario |first1=Ben |last2= |first2= |date=May 31, 2010 |website=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, Irving Plaza became the venue for the services of [[Hillsong Church]] New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hillsongnyc.com/ hillsongnyc.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2015, [[Paul McCartney]] played a surprise show announced only that morning on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Lithuania Bushido Federation''' ({{lang-lt|Lietuvos Bušido federacija}}), also known as '''Bushido Lithuania''', is the largest [[combat sports]] promotion in [[Lithuania]].

LBF was founded in 1999 with the name ''Lietuvos Bušido RINGS federacija'' as the Lithuanian stable-branch of the [[Japan]]ese promotion [[RINGS]] and held its first event in 2000. RINGS fighter [[Volk Han]] was influential in starting the promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bushido.lt/?id=10|title=Bushido.lt – Fighting network|website=bushido.lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, LBF unites 34 Lithuanian sports clubs and has been holding the international [[mixed martial arts]] series ''Bushido Fighting Championship'', domestic MMA series ''S.W.A.T.'', international [[kickboxing]] series ''King of Kings'', international MMA series with [[Hero's]] Lithuania brand, as well as events carrying the brands of their partners such as [[K-1]], [[Shooto]], [[ADCC Submission Wrestling World Championship|ADCC]], [[Pancrase]], [[ZST]] and [[Shootboxing]].

This MMA organisation will partner [[Rizin Fighting Federation]] for the RIZIN FIGHTING WORLD GRAND-PRIX event to be held on December 29 and 31 2015. The former [[Pride Fighting Championships|Pride FC]] Heavyweight champion [[Fedor Emelianenko]] will headline the NYE Rizin FF main event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rizin FF - Rizin Fighting Federation 1|url = http://www.sherdog.com/events/Rizin-FF-Rizin-Fighting-Federation-1-48357|website = Sherdog|accessdate = 2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rizin FF - Rizin Fighting Federation 2|url = http://www.sherdog.com/events/Rizin-FF-Rizin-Fighting-Federation-2-48359|website = Sherdog|accessdate = 2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Milton Griepp''' (born c. 1954) is an American businessman who has spent the bulk of his career involved with [[American comic book]]s. He was the co-founder and CEO of [[Capital City Distribution]], a [[Direct market|distributor]] of comic books and related material, from 1980 to 1996. In 2001, he founded the online [[trade magazine]] ''[[ICv2]]'' and acts as its CEO.

== Biography ==
While attending the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] for a masters degree in [[sociology]], Griepp worked in the comics division of [[Wisconsin Independent News Distributors]], located in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="Comic Shop"&gt;Gearino, pp. 79–81.&lt;/ref&gt; When the company was purchased by [[Big Rapids Distribution]] in 1978, Griepp and his coworker John Davis were absorbed as well. They both lost their jobs when Big Rapids went bankrupt in 1980, and Griepp drew [[Unemployment benefits# United States|unemployment benefits]] for two months.&lt;ref name="Comic Shop"/&gt;

At that time, Davis approached him to propose a partnership as comic book distributors. They founded [[Capital City Distribution]] in April 1980 when Griepp was 26 years old.&lt;ref name="Comic Shop"/&gt; With Griepp as CEO, the new business absorbed some of Big Rapids' assets&lt;ref name="ICv2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Booker&gt;Booker, M. Keith, editor. ''Comics through Time: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas'' (ABC-CLIO, 2014), p. 929.&lt;/ref&gt; and grew to be the largest comic book distributor in the United States.&lt;ref name="Comic Shop109"&gt;Gearino, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Griepp crafted a monthly newsletter, ''Internal Correspondence'', which was sent to all of their retail customers.&lt;ref&gt;Gearino, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Their main rival, [[Diamond Comics Distributors]], overtook it in size through acquisitions in 1988.&lt;ref name="Comic Shop109"/&gt; That year, Capital City and Diamond represented at least 70% of the comic book distribution market.&lt;ref&gt;Duin, Steve &amp; [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Richardson, Mike]] (1998) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MihlAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=milton+griepp Comics: Between the Panels]''. [[Dark Horse Comics]]. Retrieved August 13, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

When trade magazine ''[[Hero Illustrated]]'' published a list of the 100 most important people in the comic industry in mid-1993, Griepp was ranked tenth because of his push for innovation in distribution technology.&lt;ref&gt;Staff ([[cover date]] September 1993), "Hero's Top 100 – The 100 Most Important People in Comics" ''[[Hero Illustrated]]'' #3 p82. [[Warrior Publications]]. [[Lombard, Illinois]].&lt;/ref&gt; Griepp encouraged retailers to enter the [[Information Age|computer age]] and was the first to offer online reordering options. His position fell to number 19 the following year because of turmoil caused by a [[Comic book collecting#Bust of the speculator market|bursting bubble in the industry]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff ([[cover date]] September 1994), "Hero's Top 100 – The 100 Most Important People in Comics" ''[[Hero Illustrated]]'' #15 p62. [[Warrior Publications]]. [[Lombard, Illinois]].&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond acquired Capital City in 1996 during a period of industry consolidation.&lt;ref name="ICv2"&gt;[http://icv2.com/about/ "Who We Are: Milton Griepp," ICv2.com.] Accessed October 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Davis and Former Capital City Employees Join Diamond," ''The Comics Journal'' #192 (Dec. 1996), pp. 13–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gearino, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

After next working as a publishing and retailing consultant, in 1999–2000 Griepp ran Next Planet Over, a San Francisco-based e-commerce company.&lt;ref name="ICv2" /&gt;

In 2001, he founded ''[[ICv2]]'' (''Internal Correspondence version 2''), an online [[trade magazine]] which also conducts annual industry conferences. Comic professionals consider his annual [[white paper]] on comic sales the industry standard.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Calvin (July 16, 2014), "[https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/comics/article/63319-comics-graphic-novels-market-hit-870-million-in-2013.html Comics, Graphic Novels Market Hit $870 Million in 2013]," [[Publishers Weekly]]. Retrieved August 14, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Griepp has served as a board member for organizations such as the parent company of the digital comics distribution platform [[comiXology]], the non-profit [[Comic Book Legal Defense Fund]], and [[Free Comic Book Day]].&lt;ref name="ICv2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BC list 1"&gt;[[Rich Johnston|Johnston, Rich]] (November 2012). "Top 100 Power List", ''[[Bleeding Cool]] Magazine'' #1 p. 92. [[Avatar Press]]. [[Rantoul, Illinois]].&lt;/ref&gt; These roles led to him being ranked number 92 on ''[[Bleeding Cool]] Magazine''{{`s}} 2012 "Top 100 Power List" for the comic industry.&lt;ref name="BC list 1"/&gt;

'''Mullaghanish''' ({{lang-ga|Mullach an Ois}}) is a 649 m high mountain in the [[Derrynasaggart Mountains|Derrynasaggart range]], located just northeast of [[Ballyvourney]] in [[County Cork]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

==Transmission site==
This site is home to one of [[RTÉ Television|Telefís Éireann's]] original five main television transmitters. Coming on air in December 1962, initially on low power, it was in full operation by September 1963 with a [[625-line]] VHF service for the Southwest of Ireland, namely counties [[County Cork|Cork]], [[County Kerry|Kerry]] and [[County Limerick|Limerick]]. Today it is owned and operated by [[RTÉ Network Limited|2RN]] a subsidiary of [[Radio Telefís Éireann|RTÉ]]. In 2009 in preparation for the transmission of digital terrestrial television ([[Digital terrestrial television|DTT]]), a new mast was erected at Mullaghanish with a height of 225m, making it the tallest television transmitter in Ireland, the original 170m mast was subsequently removed. Analogue television transmissions from this site ended on 24 October 2012, and the national [[Digital terrestrial television|DTT]] service, [[Saorview]], is now broadcast from Mullaghanish at an [[Effective radiated power|ERP]] of 200&amp;nbsp;kW, making this the most powerful television transmitter in all of Ireland, a distinction formerly attributed to the [[Cairn Hill transmission site|Cairn Hill]] (analogue) transmitter in County Longford.&lt;br /&gt;
As well as digital television, six national FM radio services are broadcast from the site, all using vertical polarisation. Local station, Radio Kerry, is broadcast from a directional antenna pointing west, into its target service area of [[County Kerry]], and [[Newstalk]] is broadcast in mono.&lt;br /&gt;
The Mullaghanish transmitter also has the highest number of [[Broadcast relay station|relays]] (20) of any television transmitter in Ireland reflecting the difficult [[topography]] of its service area.

'''Music hall''' is a type of British theatrical [[entertainment]] that was popular from the early [[Victorian era]], beginning around 1850. It ended, arguably, after the [[World War I|First World War]], when the halls [[Rebranding|rebranded]] their entertainment as [[Variety show|Variety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/culture/variety-acts-and-turns-of-the-early-1930s/2012421.article#survey-answer |title=Variety Acts and Turns of the Early 1930s |date=2014 |work= |publisher=''[[Times Higher Education]]'' |accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perceptions of a distinction in Britain between bold and scandalous Victorian ''Music Hall'' and subsequent, more respectable ''Variety'' differ. Music hall involved a mixture of popular songs, comedy, [[#Speciality acts|speciality acts]], and [[variety show|variety]] entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item106422.html |title=Saturday night at the Victoria Theatre, The Graphic, October 26 1872 |date=2018 |work= |publisher=[[British Library]] |accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is derived from a type of theatre or venue in which such entertainment took place. American [[vaudeville]] was in some ways analogous to British music hall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/vshtml/vsforms.html |title=Forms of Variety Theater |date=1996 |work= |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring rousing songs and comic acts.

Originating in saloon bars within [[public house]]s during the 1830s, music hall entertainment became increasingly popular with audiences. So much so, that during the 1850s some public houses were demolished, and specialised music hall theatres developed in their place. These theatres were designed chiefly so that people could consume food and alcohol and smoke tobacco in the auditorium while the entertainment took place. This differed somewhat from the conventional type of theatre, which until then seated the audience in stalls with a separate bar-room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/the-story-of-music-halls/ |title=The Story of Music Hall: The origins of Music Hall |date=2016 |work= |publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]] |accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major music halls were based around London. Early examples included: the [[Canterbury Music Hall]] in [[Lambeth]], [[Wilton's Music Hall]] in [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]], and The Middlesex in [[Drury Lane]], otherwise known as the Old Mo.

By the mid-19th century, the halls cried out for many new and catchy songs. As a result, professional songwriters were enlisted to provide the music for a plethora of star performers, such as [[Marie Lloyd]], [[Dan Leno]], [[Little Tich]], and [[George Leybourne]]. All manner of other entertainment was performed: male and female impersonators, [[Lion comique|lions comiques]], mime artists and impressionists, trampoline acts, and comic pianists (such as [[John Orlando Parry]] and [[George Grossmith]]) were just a few of the many types of entertainments the audiences could expect to find over the next forty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/m/music-hall-character-acts/ |title=Music Hall Character Acts |date=2016 |work= |publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]] |accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Music Hall Strike of 1907]] was an important industrial conflict. It was a dispute between artists and stage hands on one hand, and theatre managers on the other, culminating in a strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.stagebeauty.net/th-muswar.html |title=The Music Hall War |date=2018 |work= |publisher=Stage Beauty website |accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The halls had recovered by the start of the First World War and were used to stage charity events in aid of the war effort. Music hall entertainment continued after the war, but became less popular due to upcoming jazz, swing, and big-band dance music acts. Licensing restrictions had also changed, and drinking was banned from the auditorium. A new type of music hall entertainment had arrived, in the form of variety, and many music hall performers failed to make the transition. They were deemed old-fashioned, and with the closure of many halls, music hall entertainment ceased and modern-day variety began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pen-and-sword.co.uk/Old-Time-Variety-Hardback/p/3046 |title=Old Time Variety |date=2011 |work= |publisher=[[Pen and Sword Books]] |accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and development==
[[File:1830 Eagle Tavern.jpg|thumb|The Eagle Tavern in 1830]]
Music hall in London had its origins in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/music-hall-and-variety]&lt;/ref&gt; It grew with the entertainment provided in the new style saloon bars of [[public house]]s during the 1830s. These venues replaced earlier semi-rural amusements provided by fairs and suburban [[pleasure garden]]s such as [[Vauxhall Gardens]] and the [[Cremorne Gardens, London|Cremorne Gardens]]. These latter became subject to urban development and became fewer and less popular.&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;Diana Howard ''London Theatres and Music Halls 1850–1950'' (1970)
&lt;/ref&gt;

The saloon was a room where for an admission fee or a greater price at the bar, singing, dancing, drama or comedy was performed. The most famous London saloon of the early days was the [[Royal Grecian Theatre|Grecian Saloon]], established in 1825, at The Eagle (a former tea-garden), 2 Shepherdess Walk, off the [[City Road]] in east London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianlondon.org/publications3/nightside-25.htm ''The Night Side of London: The Eagle Tavern'' J. Ewing Ritchie (1858)] accessed 1 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[John Hollingshead]], proprietor of the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]] (originally the Strand Music Hall), this establishment was "the father and mother, the dry and wet nurse of the Music Hall". Later known as the Grecian Theatre, it was here that [[Marie Lloyd]] made her début at the age of 14 in 1884. It is still famous because of an English nursery rhyme, with the somewhat mysterious lyrics:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Up and down the City Road&lt;br /&gt;In and out The Eagle&lt;br /&gt;That's the way the money goes&lt;br /&gt;[[Pop goes the weasel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-pop1.htm ''Pop Goes the Weasel'' World Wide Words] accessed 1 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Wilton's Music Hall - Interior.jpg|thumb|left|The interior of [[Wilton's Music Hall|Wilton's]] (here, being set for a wedding).
The lines of tables give some idea of how early music halls were used as supper clubs.]]
Another famous [[song and supper room|"song and supper" room]] of this period was [[Evans Music-and-Supper Rooms]], 43 King Street, [[Covent Garden]], established in the 1840s by W.H. Evans. This venue was also known as 'Evans Late Joys' – Joy being the name of the previous owner. Other song and supper rooms included the [[Coal Hole, Strand|Coal Hole]] in [[Strand, London|The Strand]], the Cyder Cellars in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden and the Mogul Saloon in [[Drury Lane]].&lt;ref name=Howard/&gt;

The music hall as we know it developed from such establishments during the 1850s and were built in and on the grounds of public houses. Such establishments were distinguished from theatres by the fact that in a music hall you would be seated at a table in the auditorium and could drink alcohol and smoke tobacco whilst watching the show. In a theatre, by contrast, the audience was seated in stalls and there was a separate bar-room. An exception to this rule was the [[Britannia Theatre]], [[Hoxton]] (1841) which somehow managed to evade this regulation and served drinks to its customers. Though a theatre rather than a music hall, this establishment later hosted music hall variety acts.&lt;ref name=making&gt;[http://www.craxford-family.co.uk/crauart1.php The Making of the Britannia Theatre – Alan D. Craxford and Reg Moore] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120723024600/http://www.craxford-family.co.uk/crauart1.php |date=23 July 2012 }} accessed 1 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

===Early music halls===
[[File:Canterbury Hall circa 1856.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Canterbury Music Hall|Canterbury Hall]], opened 1852 in [[Lambeth]]]]The establishment often regarded as the first true music hall was the [[Canterbury Music Hall|Canterbury]], 143 [[Westminster Bridge Road]], [[Lambeth]] built by [[Charles Morton (impresario)|Charles Morton]], afterwards dubbed "the Father of the Halls", on the site of a skittle alley next to his pub, the Canterbury Tavern. It opened on 17 May 1852 and was described by the musician and author [[Benny Green (saxophonist)|Benny Green]] as being "the most significant date in all the history of music hall".&lt;ref&gt;[[Benny Green (saxophonist)|Benny Green]] (ed) (1986) ''The Last Empires: A Music Hall Companion'' pp. 7 (Pavilion, 1986) {{ISBN|1-85145-061-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hall looked like most contemporary pub concert rooms, but its replacement in 1854 was of then unprecedented size. It was further extended in 1859, later rebuilt as a variety theatre and finally destroyed by German bombing in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/canterbury.htm ''Canterbury Music Hall'' (Arthur Lloyd)] accessed 23 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early music hall was The Middlesex, [[Drury Lane]] (1851). Popularly known as the 'Old Mo', it was built on the site of the Mogul Saloon. Later converted into a theatre it was demolished in 1965. The [[New London Theatre]] stands on its site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andreas-praefcke.de/carthalia/uk/uk_london_newlondon.htm New London Theatre] accessed 31 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Several large music halls were built in the [[East End of London|East End]]. These included the London Music Hall, otherwise known as The Shoreditch Empire, 95–99 [[Shoreditch High Street]], (1856–1935). This theatre was rebuilt during 1894 by [[Frank Matcham]], the architect of the [[Hackney Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Shoreditch.htm ''Shoreditch Empire'' (Arthur Lloyd)] accessed 23 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Another in this area was the Royal Cambridge Music Hall, 136 [[Commercial Street, London|Commercial Street]] (1864–1936). Designed by [[Finch Hill|William Finch Hill]] (the designer of the Britannia theatre in nearby Hoxton), it was rebuilt after a fire in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Shoreditch.htm ''Royal Cambridge Music Hall'' (Arthur Lloyd)] accessed 23 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Spencer Gore Balcony at the Alhambra 1910-11.jpg|thumb|''Balcony at the Alhambra'' by [[Spencer Gore (artist)|Spencer Gore]]; 1910-11]]
The construction of [[Weston's Music Hall]], [[High Holborn]] (1857), built up on the site of the Six Cans and Punch Bowl Tavern by the licensed victualler of the premises, Henry Weston, signalled that the [[West End of London|West End]] was fruitful territory for the music hall. During 1906 it was rebuilt as a variety theatre and renamed as the [[Holborn Empire]]. It was closed as a result of German action in [[the Blitz]] on the night of 11–12 May 1941 and the building was pulled down in 1960.&lt;ref name=BL&gt;[http://www.collectbritain.co.uk/personalisation/object.cfm?uid=014EVA000000000U00715000 ''British Library on Weston's''] accessed 31 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Significant West End music halls include:
* The [[Oxford Music Hall]], 14/16 [[Oxford Street]] (1861) – built on the site of an old coaching inn called the Boar and Castle by Charles Morton, the pioneer music hall developer of The Canterbury, who with this development brought music hall to the [[West End of London|West End]]. Demolished in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/TheOxfordMusicHall.htm ''Oxford Music Hall'' (Arthur Lloyd)] accessed 23 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[London Pavilion]] (1861). [[Facade]] of 1885 rebuild still extant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41455 ''Shaftesbury Avenue'', Survey of London: volumes 31 and 32: St James Westminster, Part 2 (1963), pp. 68–84] accessed: 24 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Alhambra Theatre|The Alhambra, Leicester Square]] (1860), in the former premises of the [[Royal Panopticon|London Panopticon]]. This sophisticated venue was noted for its alluring ''[[corps de ballet]]'' and was a focal point for West End pleasure seekers. It was demolished in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Alhambra.htm ''Alhambra Theatre'' (Arthur Lloyd)] accessed 23 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vesta Victoria at the Old Bedford MET DP806033.jpg|thumb|''[[Vesta Victoria]] at the Old Bedford'' (sketch) by [[Walter Sickert]]; c. 1890]]
Other large suburban music halls included:
* The Old Bedford, 93–95 High Street, [[Camden Town]] (1861). Built on the site of the tea gardens of a pub called the Bedford Arms. The Bedford was a favourite haunt of the artists known as the [[Camden Town Group]] headed by [[Walter Sickert]], who featured interior scenes of music halls in his paintings, including one entitled 'Little Dot Hetherington at The Old Bedford'. The Old Bedford was demolished in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Bedford.htm ''The Bedford Music Hall'' (Arthur Lloyd)] accessed 23 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* Collins', [[Islington Green]] (1862). Opened by [[Sam Collins (music hall)|Sam Collins]], in 1862, as the Lansdowne Music Hall, converting the pre-existing Lansdowne Arms public house, it was renamed as Collins' Music Hall in 1863. It was colloquially known as 'The Chapel on the Green'. Collins was a star of his own theatre, singing mostly Irish songs specially composed for him. It closed in 1956, after a fire, but the street front of the building still survives (see below).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Collins.htm ''Collins Music Hall'' (Arthur Lloyd)] accessed 23 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* Deacons in [[Clerkenwell]] (1862).

A noted music hall entrepreneur of this time was [[Carlo Gatti]] who built a music hall, known as Gatti's, at [[Hungerford Market]] in 1857. He sold the music hall to [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] in 1862, and the site became [[Charing Cross railway station]]. With the proceeds from selling his first music hall, Gatti acquired a restaurant in [[Westminster Bridge Road]], opposite The Canterbury music hall. He converted the restaurant into a second Gatti's music hall, known as "Gatti's-in-the-Road", in 1865. It later became a cinema. The building was badly damaged in the Second World War, and was demolished in 1950. In 1867, he acquired a [[public house]] in [[Villiers Street]] named "The Arches", under the arches of the elevated railway line leading to Charing Cross station. He opened it as another music hall, known as "[[Charing Cross Music Hall|Gatti's-in-The-Arches]]". After his death his family continued to operate the music hall, known for a period as the Hungerford or Gatti's Hungerford Palace of Varieties.

It became a cinema in 1910, and the [[Players' Theatre]] in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gattis.htm ''Gatti's In the Road, and Under the Arches, Music Halls'' (Arthur Lloyd)] accessed 23 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1865, there were 32 music halls in London seating between 500 and 5,000 people plus an unknown, but large, number of smaller venues.

In 1878, numbers peaked, with 78 large music halls in the metropolis and 300 smaller venues. Thereafter numbers declined due to stricter licensing restrictions imposed by the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] and [[London County Council|LCC]], and because of commercial competition between popular large suburban halls and the smaller venues, which put the latter out of business.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry White (2007) ''London in the Nineteenth Century'': 280&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variety theatre===
A new era of [[variety theatre]] was developed by the rebuilding of the [[London Pavilion]] in 1885. Contemporary accounts noted:
{{quote|Hitherto the halls had borne unmistakeable evidence of their origins, but the last vestiges of their old connections were now thrown aside, and they emerged in all the splendour of their new-born glory.
The highest efforts of the architect, the designer and the decorator were enlisted in their service, and the gaudy and tawdry music hall of the past gave way to the resplendent "theatre of varieties" of the present day, with its classic exterior of marble and freestone, its lavishly appointed auditorium and its elegant and luxurious foyers and promenades brilliantly illuminated by myriad electric lights|sign=Charles Stuart and A. J. Park ''The Variety Stage'' (1895)}}

One of the most famous of these new palaces of pleasure in the West End was the [[Empire, Leicester Square]], built as a theatre in 1884 but acquiring a music hall licence in 1887. Like the nearby Alhambra this theatre appealed to the men of leisure by featuring alluring ballet dancers and had a notorious promenade which was the resort of courtesans. Another spectacular example of the new variety theatre was the Tivoli in the [[Strand, London|Strand]] built 1888–90 in an eclectic neo-Romanesque style with Baroque and Moorish-Indian embellishments. "[[The Tivoli]]" became a brand name for music-halls all over the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Benny Green (1986) ''The Last Empires: A Music Hall Companion'': 42-3&lt;/ref&gt; During 1892, the Royal English Opera House, which had been a financial failure in [[Shaftesbury Avenue]], applied for a music hall licence and was converted by [[Walter Emden]] into a grand music hall and renamed the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre of Varieties]], managed by [[Charles Morton (impresario)|Charles Morton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Archive/January2005/PageTwo.htm Pages about Morton's management in feature on the theatre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706015934/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Archive/January2005/PageTwo.htm |date=6 July 2008 }} (Arthur Lloyd) accessed 27 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Denied by the newly created [[London County Council|LCC]] permission to construct the promenade, which was such a popular feature of the Empire and Alhambra, the Palace compensated in the way of adult entertainment by featuring apparently nude women in [[tableau vivant|tableaux vivants]], though the concerned LCC hastened to reassure patrons that the girls who featured in these displays were actually wearing flesh-toned body stockings and were not naked at all.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Weightman (1992) ''Bright Lights, Big City'': 94–95&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the grandest of these new halls was the [[Coliseum Theatre]] built by [[Oswald Stoll]] in 1904 at the bottom of [[St Martin's Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/LondonColiseum.htm "London Coliseum (Arthur Lloyd)"] accessed 24 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the [[London Palladium]] (1910) in Little Argyll Street.

The acceptance of music hall as a legitimate cultural form was established by the first [[Royal Variety Performance]] before King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] during 1912 at the Palace Theatre. However, consistent with this new respectability the best-known music hall entertainer of the time, [[Marie Lloyd]], was not invited, being deemed too "saucy" for presentation to the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/music_hall_tour/the_story_of_the_music_halls/royal.php ''The Royal Variety Performance''] (London Theatre Museum) accessed 24 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==='Music Hall War' of 1907===
[[File:1907 Music hall strike poster.jpg|thumb|upright|right|1907 poster from the ''Music Hall War'' between artists and theatre managers]]
The development of syndicates controlling a number of theatres, such as the Stoll circuit, increased tensions between employees and employers. On 22 January 1907, a dispute between artists, stage hands and managers of the [[Holborn Empire]] worsened. Strikes in other London and suburban halls followed, organised by the Variety Artistes' Federation. The strike lasted for almost two weeks and was known as the ''Music Hall War''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/music_hall_tour/the_story_of_the_music_halls/strike.php ''Music Hall Strike of 1907'' (Theatre Museum London)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124100946/http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/music_hall_tour/the_story_of_the_music_halls/strike.php |date=24 November 2007 }} accessed 15 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It became extremely well known, and was advocated enthusiastically by the main spokesmen of the trade union and Labour movement&amp;nbsp;– [[Ben Tillett]] and [[Keir Hardie]] for example. Picket lines were organized outside the theatres by the artistes, while in the provinces theatre management attempted to oblige artistes to sign a document promising never to join a trade union.

The strike ended in arbitration, which satisfied most of the main demands, including a minimum wage and maximum working week for musicians.

Several music hall entertainers such as [[Marie Dainton]], [[Marie Lloyd]], [[Arthur Roberts (comedian)|Arthur Roberts]], [[Joe Elvin]] and [[Gus Elen]] were strong advocates of the strike, though they themselves earned enough not to be concerned personally in a material sense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dgillan.screaming.net/stage/th-frames.html?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.dgillan.screaming.net/stage/th-muswar.html ''The Music Hall War'' (Stage Beauty)] accessed 24 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd explained her advocacy:{{quote|We (the stars) can dictate our own terms.

===Recruiting===

[[File:Women of Britain Say - "Go" - World War I British poster by the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee, art by E J Kealey (Restoration).jpg|thumb|upright|May 1915 poster by E. J. Kealey, from the ''Parliamentary Recruiting Committee'']]
World War I may have been the high-water mark of music hall popularity. The artists and composers threw themselves into rallying public support and enthusiasm for the war effort. Patriotic music hall compositions such as "Keep the Home Fires Burning" ([http://www.firstworldwar.com/audio/John_McCormack_-_Keep_The_Home_Fires_Burning.mp3 1914]), "Pack up Your Troubles" ([http://www.firstworldwar.com/audio/Murray_Johnson_-_Pack_Up_Your_Troubles.mp3 1915]), "[[It's a Long Way to Tipperary]]" ([http://www.firstworldwar.com/audio/John_McCormack_-_It%27s_A_Long_Way_To_Tipperary.mp3 1914]) and "We Don't Want to Lose You (but we think you ought to Go)", were sung by music hall audiences, and sometimes by soldiers in the trenches.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n3PHdGaUqIkC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=%22i+didn+t+like+you+much+before+you+joined+the+army%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=-C4vzcPQjw&amp;sig=F_6yX14pfx4z-7gIsdqMD3nNS0s ''Popular Music in England, 1840–1914: A Social History'' Dave Russell (1997 Manchester University Press)] {{ISBN|0-7190-5261-0}} accessed 24 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Many songs promoted recruitment ("All the boys in khaki get the nice girls", 1915); others satirised particular elements of the war experience. "What did you do in the Great war, Daddy" ([http://www.firstworldwar.com/audio/Tom_Clare_-_What_Did_You_Do_In_The_War,_Daddy.mp3 1919]) criticised profiteers and slackers; [[Vesta Tilley]]'s "I've got a bit of a blighty one" ([http://www.firstworldwar.com/audio/Vesta_Tilley_-_I%27ve_A_Bit_Of_A_%27Blighty_One%27.mp3 1916]) showed a soldier delighted to have a wound just serious enough to be sent home. The rhymes give a sense of grim humour (''When they wipe my face with sponges / and they feed me on [[blancmange]]s / I'm glad I've got a bit of a blighty one'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btinternet.com/~radical/thefolkmag/vesta.htm|title=''Vesta Tilley Biography''|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020191013/http://www.btinternet.com/~radical/thefolkmag/vesta.htm|archivedate=2012-10-20}} accessed 13 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Tilley became more popular than ever during this time, when she and her husband, [[Walter de Frece]], managed a military recruitment drive. In the guise of characters like 'Tommy in the Trench' and 'Jack Tar Home from Sea', Tilley performed songs such as "The army of today's all right" and "Jolly Good Luck to the Girl who Loves a Soldier". This is how she got the nickname ''Britain's best recruiting sergeant''&amp;nbsp;– young men were sometimes asked to join the army on stage during her show. She also performed in hospitals and sold [[war bond]]s. Her husband was [[knight]]ed in 1919 for his own services to the war effort, and Tilley became Lady de Frece.&lt;ref&gt;''Vesta Tilley'', Sarah Maitland (1986 Virago) p. 14 {{ISBN|0-86068-795-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the reality of war began to sink home, the recruiting songs all but disappeared&amp;nbsp;– the Greatest Hits collection for 1915 published by top music publisher Francis and Day contains no recruitment songs. After conscription was brought in 1916, songs dealing with the war spoke mostly of the desire to return home. Many also expressed anxiety about the new roles women were taking in society.

Possibly the most notorious of music hall songs from the First World War was "[[Oh, What a Lovely War!|Oh! It's a lovely war]]" ([http://www.firstworldwar.com/audio/Courtland_And_Jeffries_-_Oh,_It%27s_A_Lovely_War.mp3 1917]), popularised by [[Drag king|male impersonator]] [[Ella Shields]].

===Decline===
Music hall continued during the [[interwar period]], but no longer as the single dominant form of popular entertainment in Britain. The improvement of cinema, the development of radio, and the cheapening of the gramophone damaged its popularity greatly. It now had to compete with [[jazz]], [[swing music|swing]] and [[big band]] dance music. Licensing restrictions also changed its character.

In 1914, the [[London County Council]] (LCC) enacted that drinking be banished from the auditorium into a separate bar and during 1923 even the separate bar was abolished by parliamentary decree. The exemption of the theatres from this latter act prompted some critics to denounce this legislation as an attempt to deprive the working classes of their pleasures, as a form of social control, whilst sparing the supposedly more responsible upper classes who patronised the theatres (though this could be due to the licensing restrictions brought about due to the [[Defence of the Realm Act 1914]], which also applied to public houses as well).&lt;ref&gt;Lucinda Jarret (1997): ''Stripping in Time: A History of Erotic Dancing'': 107&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the music hall gave rise to such major stars as [[George Formby, Jr.|George Formby]], [[Gracie Fields]], [[Max Miller (comedian)|Max Miller]], [[Will Hay]], and [[Flanagan and Allen]] during this period.

In the early 1950s, [[rock and roll]], whose performers initially topped music hall bills, attracted a young audience who had little interest in the music hall acts while driving the older audience away. The final demise was competition from television, which grew very popular after the Queen's coronation was televised. Some music halls tried to retain an audience by putting on [[striptease]] acts. In 1957, the playwright [[John Osborne]] delivered this elegy:&lt;ref&gt;John Osbourne (1957) ''The Entertainer'': 7. Faber and Faber, London&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The music hall is dying, and with it, a significant part of England. Some of the heart of England has gone; something that once belonged to everyone, for this was truly a folk art.|sign=John Osbourne, ''The Entertainer'' (1957)}}

[[Moss Empires]], the largest British music hall chain, closed the majority of its theatres in 1960, closely followed by the death of music hall stalwart Max Miller in 1963, prompting one contemporary to write that: "Music-halls&amp;nbsp;... died this afternoon when they buried Max Miller".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/StollMoss-Theatres-Ltd-Company-History.html ''Stoll-Moss Theatres Ltd'' (Company History)] accessed 2 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarkson Rose (1964) ''Red Plush and Greasepaint'': 136&lt;/ref&gt; Miller himself had sometimes said that the genre would die with him. Many music hall performers, unable to find work, fell into poverty; some did not even have a home, having spent their working lives living in digs between performances.

Stage and film musicals, however, continued to be influenced by the music hall idiom, including ''[[Oliver!]]'', ''[[Dr Dolittle]]'' and ''[[My Fair Lady]]''. The [[BBC]] series ''[[The Good Old Days (UK TV series)|The Good Old Days]]'', which ran for thirty years, recreated the music hall for the modern audience, and the ''[[Paul Daniels]] Magic Show'' allowed several speciality acts a television presence from 1979 to 1994. Aimed at a younger audience, but still owing a lot to the music hall heritage, was the late '70s series ''[[The Muppet Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qsulis.demon.co.uk/Website_Louise_Gold/The_Muppet_Show_Music_Hall.htm ''The Muppet Show Music Hall''] accessed 2 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music halls of Paris==
[[File:Degas - Café Concert - at Les Ambassadeurs 1876-77.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Café-Concert by [[Edgar Degas]] (1876-77)]]
[[File:Mistinguett Moulin Rouge.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Mistinguett]] at the [[Moulin Rouge]] (1911)]]
The music hall was first imported into France in its British form in 1862, but under the French law protecting the state theatres, performers could not wear costumes or recite dialogue, something only allowed in theaters. When the law changed in 1867, the Paris music hall flourished, and a half-dozen new halls opened, offering acrobats, singers, dancers, magicians, and trained animals. The first Paris music call built specially for that purpose was the [[Folies-Bergere]] (1869);  it was followed by the [[Moulin Rouge]] (1889), the [[Alhambra-Maurice Chevalier|Alhambra]] (1866), the first to be called a music hall, and the  [[Paris Olympia|Olympia]] (1893).  The ''Printania'' (1903) was a music-garden, open only in summer, with a theater, restaurant, circus, and horse-racing. Older theaters also transformed themselves into music halls, including the [[Bobino]] (1873), the [[Bataclan (theatre)|Bataclan]] (1864), and the [[Alcazar (Paris)|Alcazar]] (1858). At the beginning, music halls offered dance reviews, theater and songs, but gradually songs and singers became the main attraction. {{Sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=1005-1006}}

[[File:Baker Charleston.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Josephine Baker]] dances the Charleston at the ''[[Folies Bergère]]'' (1926)]]
[[File:Olympia facade.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Olympia (Paris)|Olympia]] Music Hall]] 
Paris music halls all faced stiff competition in the [[interwar period]] from the most popular new form of entertainment, the [[Movie theater|cinema]]. They responded by offering more complex and lavish shows. In 1911, the Olympia had introduced the giant stairway as a set for its productions, an idea copied by other music halls. The singer [[Mistinguett]] made her debut the Casino de Paris in 1895 and continued to appear regularly in the 1920s and 1930s at the [[Folies Bergère]], [[Moulin Rouge]] and Eldorado. Her risqué routines captivated Paris, and she became one of the most highly-paid and popular French entertainers of her time.{{Sfn|Fierro|1996|page=1006}}

One of the most popular entertainers in Paris during the period was the American singer [[Josephine Baker]]. Baker sailed to Paris, France. She first arrived in Paris in 1925 to perform in a show called  "''[[Negrophilia#The Bal Nègre|La Revue Nègre]]''" at the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]].&lt;ref&gt;"''Le Jazz-Hot'': The Roaring Twenties", in William Alfred Shack, ''Harlem in Montmartre: A Paris Jazz Story Between the Great Wars'', University of California Press, 2001, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  She became an immediate success for her [[burlesque|erotic dancing]], and for appearing [[Nudity|practically nude]] on stage. After a successful tour of Europe, she returned to France to star at the [[Folies Bergère]]. Baker performed the 'Danse sauvage,' wearing a costume consisting of a skirt made of a string of artificial bananas.

The music-halls suffered growing hardships in the 1930s. The Olympia was converted into a movie theater, and others closed. Others continued to thrive. In 1937 and 1930, the Casino de Paris presented shows with [[Maurice Chevalier]], who had already achieved success as an actor and singer in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]].

In 1935, a twenty-year old singer named [[Édith Piaf]] was discovered in the [[Quartier Pigalle|Pigalle]]  by nightclub owner [[Louis Leplée]], whose club, Le Gerny, off the [[Champs-Élysées]], was frequented by the upper and lower classes alike. He persuaded her to sing despite her extreme nervousness. Leplée taught her the basics of stage presence and told her to wear a black dress, which became her trademark apparel. Leplée ran an intense publicity campaign leading up to her opening night, attracting the presence of many celebrities, including Maurice Chevalier. Her nightclub appearance led to her first two records produced that same year, and the beginning of a legendary career.

Competition from movies and television largely brought an end to the Paris music hall.  However, a few still flourish, with tourists as their primary audience.  Major music halls include the [[Folies-Bergere]], [[Crazy Horse Saloon]], [[Casino de Paris]], [[Olympia (Paris)|Olympia]], and [[Moulin Rouge]]. {{Sfn|Fierro|1996|page=1006}}

==History of the songs==
The musical forms most associated with music hall evolved in part from traditional folk song and songs written for popular drama, becoming by the 1850s a distinct musical style. Subject matter became more contemporary and humorous, and accompaniment was provided by larger house-orchestras as increasing affluence gave the lower classes more access to commercial entertainment and to a wider range of musical instruments, including the piano. The consequent change in musical taste from traditional to more professional forms of entertainment arose in response to the rapid industrialisation and urbanisation of previously rural populations during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The newly created urban communities, cut off from their cultural roots, required new and readily accessible forms of entertainment.&lt;ref name=song&gt;[http://www.musichallcds.com/music_hall_songs.htm ''The Songs of the Music Hall'' (Music Hall CDs)] accessed 2 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Music halls were originally tavern rooms which provided entertainment, in the form of music and speciality acts, for their patrons. By the middle years of the nineteenth century, the first purpose-built music halls were being built in London. The halls created a demand for new and catchy popular songs that could no longer be met from the traditional [[folk song]] repertoire. Professional songwriters were enlisted to fill the gap.

The emergence of a distinct music hall style can be credited to a fusion of musical influences. Music hall songs needed to gain and hold the attention of an often jaded and unruly urban audience. In America, from the 1840s, [[Stephen Foster]] had reinvigorated folk song with the admixture of Negro [[spiritual (music)|spiritual]] to produce a new type of popular song. Songs like "[[Old Folks at Home]]" (1851)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~amerimus/ofah.htm "Old Folks at Home"], Center for American Music, accessed 2 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Oh, Dem Golden Slippers]]" ([http://lcweb2.loc.gov/music/sm/smaudio/7901966.wav James Bland, 1879])&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/smhtml/audiodir.html#7901966 "Golden Slippers"] Music for the Nation (Library of Congress) (1998), accessed 2 November 2007. "Oh, Dem Golden Slippers" was a minstrel parody by James Bland of an earlier spiritual by the Fisk Jubilee Singers, [[Golden Slippers]].&lt;/ref&gt; spread round the globe, taking with them the idiom and appurtenances of the [[minstrel show|minstrel]] song. Other influences on the rapidly developing music hall idiom were [[Irish music|Irish]] and European music, particularly the [[jig]], [[polka]], and [[waltz]].

Typically, a music hall song consists of a series of verses sung by the performer alone, and a repeated chorus which carries the principal melody, and in which the audience is encouraged to join.
[[File:GeorgeLeybourne2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Leybourne as 'Champagne Charlie']]
In Britain, the first music hall songs often promoted the alcoholic wares of the owners of the halls in which they were performed. Songs like "Glorious Beer",&lt;ref&gt;"Beer, Beer, Glorious Beer" words and music by Harry Anderson, Steve Leggett, and Will Goodwin, published 1901&lt;/ref&gt; and the first major music hall success, ''[[Champagne Charlie (song)|Champagne Charlie]]'' (1867) had a major influence in establishing the new art form. The tune of "Champagne Charlie" became used for the [[Salvation Army]] hymn "Bless His Name, He Sets Me Free" (1881). When asked why the tune should be used like this, [[William Booth]] is said to have replied "Why should the devil have all the good tunes?'' "The people the Army sought to save, knew nothing of the [[hymn tune]]s or gospel melodies used in the churches, but 'the music hall had been their melody school.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.salvationarmy.org/heritage.nsf/0/42d53ced9ec1583080256954004bff3e!OpenDocument&amp;ExpandSection=1 "Why Should The Devil Have All The Best Tunes?" (Salvation Army History)] accessed 2 November 2007. The origin of the quotation is problematic, it is first attributed to [[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546), and also to sermons preached by both [[Rowland Hill (preacher)|Rowland Hill]] (1744–1833), and [[John Wesley]] (1703–1791)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1870s, the songs were free of their folk music origins, and particular songs also started to become associated with particular singers, often with exclusive contracts with the songwriter, just as many pop songs are today. Towards the end of the style the music became influenced by [[ragtime]] and [[jazz]], before being overtaken by them.

Music hall songs were often composed with their working class audiences in mind. Songs like "[[My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)]]'", "[[Wot Cher! Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Road|Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Road]]", and ''[[Waiting at the Church]]'' expressed in melodic form situations with which the urban poor were very familiar. Music hall songs could be romantic, patriotic, humorous or sentimental, as the need arose.&lt;ref name=song/&gt; The most popular music hall songs became the basis for the [[pub song]]s of the typical [[Cockney]] "[[Knees Up Mother Brown|knees up]]".

Although a number of songs show a sharply ironic and knowing view of working class life, there were, too, those which were repetitive, derivative, written quickly and sung to make a living rather than a work of art.

The typical music hall comedian was a man or woman, usually dressed in character to suit the subject of the song, or sometimes attired in absurd and eccentric style. Until well into the twentieth century, the acts were essentially vocal, with songs telling a story, accompanied by a minimum of patter. They included a variety of genres, including:
* [[Lion comique]]s: essentially, men dressed as "toffs", who sang songs about drinking champagne, going to the races, going to the ball, womanising and gambling, and living the life of an aristocrat.
* Male and [[female impersonator]]s, the latter more in the style of a [[pantomime dame]] than a modern [[drag queen]]. Nevertheless, these included some more sophisticated performers such as [[Vesta Tilley]] and [[Ella Shields]], whose male impersonations communicated real social commentary.

==Speciality acts==
[[File:King, Hetty - 1910 (male impersonator).jpg|thumb|200px|Male impersonator [[Hetty King]]]]
[[File:Falk, Benjamin J. (1853-1925) - Eugen Sandow (1867-1925).jpg|thumb|200px|Strongman [[Eugen Sandow]]]]
The vocal content of the music hall bills, was, from the beginning, accompanied by many other kinds of act, some of them quite weird and wonderful. These were known collectively as ''speciality acts'' (abbreviated to "spesh"), which, over time, have included:

* Adagio: essentially a sort of cross between a dance act and a [[juggling]] act, consisting usually of a male dancer who threw a slim, pretty young girl around. Some aspects of modern dance choreography evolved from Adagio acts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dancesport.uk.com/training/exhibit.htm DanceSport UK] accessed 10 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Trapeze|Aerial acts]], of the sort usually seen at the circus
* Animal acts: Talking dogs, [[flea circus]]es, and all manner of animals doing tricks.
* Cycling acts: again, a development of a circus act, consisting of either a solo or a troupe of trick cyclists. There was even seven-piece a cycling band called Seven Musical Savonas, who played fifty instruments between them, and Kaufmann's Cycling Beauties, a troupe of girls in Victorian swim wear.
* [[Drag artist]]s: female entertainers dressed as men, such as [[Vesta Tilley]], [[Ella Shields]], and [[Hetty King]]; or male entertainers dressed as women, such as Bert Erroll, [[Julian Eltinge]], [[Danny La Rue]], and Rex Jameson in the character of Mrs Shufflewick.
* Electric acts, using the newly discovered phenomenon of [[static electricity]] to produce tricks such as lighting gas jets and setting fire to handkerchiefs through the performers fingertips. Dr Walford Brodie (1869/70-1939) was the most notable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aboutaberdeen.com/Dr-Walford-Bodie |title=Dr Walford Brodie |date=2018 |work= |publisher=About Aberdeen website |accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Escapology|Escapologists]], such as [[Harry Houdini]].
* [[Fire eater]]s and other eating acts, such as eating glass, [[razor|razor blades]], [[goldfish]], etc.
* [[Juggling]] and [[plate spinning]] acts. Another variation was the [[Diabolo]].
* [[Impalement arts|Knife throwing]] and [[sword swallowing]]. The most spectacular of its time was the Victorina Troupe, who swallowed a sword fired from a rifle.
* [[Magic (illusion)|Magic]] acts, such as [[David Devant]].
* A memory act of the type performed by Datas, "the Living Encyclopaedia" (1875-1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baker |first=Richard Anthony |date=2014 |title=British Music Hall: An Illustrated History |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ruWwBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA243&amp;lpg=PA243&amp;dq=datas+and+music+hall&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XddgqP2pDi&amp;sig=IqITOaLCnYeNPlqhEgwu3RRn54k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJn5aeiKTcAhWpDMAKHWsFDEkQ6AEISjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=datas%20and%20music%20hall&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Pen and Sword Books]] |page=242 |isbn=1783831189}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mentalism]] acts. Commonly a male mentalist, blindfolded on stage, and an attractive female assistant passing among the audience. The assistant would collect objects from the audience, and the mentalist would identify each by "reading" the assistants mind. This was usually accomplished by a clever system of codes and clues from the assistant.
* [[Mime artist]]s and [[impressionist (entertainment)|impressionists]].
* Comic [[pianist]]s, such as [[John Orlando Parry]] and [[George Grossmith]].
* [[Puppet]] acts, including human puppets and living doll acts.
* [[Shadow puppet]] acts.
* [[Stilts|Stilt]] walkers.
* [[Strongman (strength athlete)|Strongmen]] such as [[Eugen Sandow]], and [[Strongwoman|strongwomen]] such as [[Joan Rhodes]], performing [[feats of strength]].
* [[Trampoline]] acts.
* [[Ventriloquism|Ventriloquists]], or ''Vent'' acts as they were called in the business, such as [[Fred Russell (ventriloquist)|Fred Russell]], [[Arthur Prince (ventriloquist)|Arthur Prince]], Coram (Thomas Mitchell).
* [[Wild West]]/[[Cowboy]] acts.
* [[Wrestling]] and [[jujitsu]] exhibitions were both popular speciality acts, forming the basis of modern [[professional wrestling]].

==Cultural influences of music hall: Literature, drama, screen, and later music==
The music hall has been evoked in many films, plays, TV series, and books.
* In [[James Joyce]]'s short story "[[The Boarding House]]" (1914), Mrs Mooney's boarding-house in Hardwicke Street accommodates "occasionally (...) ''artistes'' from the music halls". The Sunday night "reunions" with Jack Mooney in the drawing-room create a certain atmosphere.
* About half of the film ''[[Those Were the Days (1934 film)|Those Were the Days]]'' (1934) is set in a music hall. It was based on a farce by [[Arthur Wing Pinero|Pinero]] and features the music hall acts of [[Lily Morris]], [[Harry Bedford (music hall)|Harry Bedford]], the gymnasts [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gAyRRsJ73o Gaston &amp; Andre], [[G. H. Elliott]], Sam Curtis, and Frank Boston &amp; Betty.
* A music hall with a 'memory man' act provides a pivotal plot device in the classic 1935 [[Alfred Hitchcock]] thriller ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0026029|title=The 39 Steps (1935)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Arthur Askey comedy film ''[[I Thank You (film)|I Thank You]]'' (1941) features old-time music hall star Lily Morris as an ex-music hall artiste now ennobled as "Lady Randall". In the last scene of the film, however, she reverts to type and gives a rendition of "[[Waiting at the Church]]" at an impromptu concert at [[Aldwych tube station]] organised by Askey and his side-kick [[Richard Murdoch|Richard "Stinker" Murdoch]].
* The Victorian era of music hall was celebrated by the 1944 film, ''[[Champagne Charlie (film)|Champagne Charlie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0036704|title=Champagne Charlie (1944)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The comedy of [[Benny Hill]], first seen on British television in 1951, was heavily influenced by the traditions and conventions of Music hall comedy and he actively kept those traditions (comedy, songs, patter, pantomime, and female impersonations) alive on his more-than-100 television specials broadcast from 1955 through 1991.
* [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s 1952 film ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'', set in 1914 London, evokes the music hall world of Chaplin's youth where he performed as comedian before he achieved worldwide celebrity as a film star in America. The film depicts the last performance of a washed-up music hall clown called Calvero at The Empire theatre, Leicester Square. The film premiered at the [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire Cinema]], which was built on the same site as the Empire theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0044837|Limelight}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Good Old Days (UK TV series)|The Good Old Days]]'' (1953 to 1983) was a popular BBC television light entertainment programme recorded live at the [[Leeds City Varieties]], which aimed to recreate an authentic atmosphere of the Victorian–Edwardian music hall with songs and sketches of the era performed by present-day performers in the style of the original artistes. The audience dressed in period costume and joined in the singing, especially the singing of ''Down at the Old Bull and Bush'' which closed the show. The show was compered by [[Leonard Sachs]], who introduced the acts. In the course of its run, it featured about 2,000 artists. The show was first broadcast on 20 July 1953. ''The Good Old Days'' was inspired by the success of the ''Ridgeway's Late Joys'' at the Players' Theatre Club in London: a private members' club that ran fortnightly programmes of variety acts in London's West End.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whirligig-tv.co.uk/tv/history/history.htm ''1950's British TV Milestones'' (Whirligig, 2003)] accessed 24 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Osborne]]'s play ''[[The Entertainer (play)|The Entertainer]]'' (1957) portrays the life and work of a failing, third-rate music hall stage performer who tries to keep his career going even as his personal life falls apart. The story is set at the time of the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, against the backdrop of the dying music hall tradition, and has been seen as symbolic of Britain's general post-war decline, its loss of its Empire, its power, and its cultural confidence and identity. It was made into a film in 1960 starring [[Laurence Olivier]] in the title role of Archie Rice.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0053796|title=The Entertainer}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[Grip of the Strangler]]'' (1958), set in Victorian London, the raunchy can-can dancers and loose women of the sleazy "Judas Hole" music hall are terrorised by the Haymarket Strangler, played by [[Boris Karloff]].
* The variously titled [[Ken Dodd]] TV series recorded between 1959 and 1988 were heavily influenced by those traditions; up to his death in 2018, Dodd continued to tour a variety show including quick-fire stand-up comedy, songs, ventriloquism and sometimes other speciality acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Arise, Sir Ken | website = telegraph.co.uk | publisher = Telegraph Media Group | date = 31 December 2016 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comedy/comedians/ken-dodd-retire-at-88-never | access-date = 9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Theatre of the Absurd]] (c. late 1950s) was influenced by music hall in its use of comedy, with avant-garde cultural forms (such as [[surrealism]]) being a more obvious influence.
* [[J. B. Priestley]]'s 1965 novel ''[[Lost Empires]]'' also evokes the world of Edwardian music hall just before the start of World War I; the title is a reference to the [[Moss Empires|Empire theatres]] (as well as foreshadowing the decline of the British Empire itself). It was adapted as a television miniseries, shown in both the UK and in the U.S. as a PBS presentation. Priestley's 1929 novel ''[[The Good Companions]]'', set in the same period, follows the lives of the members of a "[[Concert party (entertainment)|concert party]]" or touring [[Pierrot troupe]].
* [[Herman's Hermits]], led by [[Peter Noone]], incorporated music hall into their repertoire, scoring a major hit with their cover of the [[Harry Champion]] music hall standard, "[[I'm Henery the Eighth, I Am]]", in 1965 (Noone's version includes only the chorus; not the many verses of the original).
* Music hall had a discernible influence on [[The Beatles]] through [[Paul McCartney]], himself the son of a performer in the music hall tradition (Jim McCartney, who led Jim Mac's Jazz Band). Examples of McCartney's songs to display a music hall influence include: "[[When I'm Sixty-Four]]" (1967), "[[Your Mother Should Know]]" (1967), "[[Honey Pie]]" (1968), and "[[Maxwell's Silver Hammer]]" (1969).
* The parodic film ''[[Oh! What a Lovely War]]'' (1969), based on the stage musical ''[[Oh, What a Lovely War!]]'' (1963) by [[Joan Littlewood]]'s [[Theatre Workshop]], featured the music hall turns and songs that had provided support for the British war effort in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0064754|title=Oh! What a Lovely War}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The popular British television series ''[[Upstairs, Downstairs (1971 TV series)|Upstairs, Downstairs]]'' (1971–1975) and its spin-off ''[[Thomas &amp; Sarah]]'' (1979) each dealt frequently with the world of the Edwardian music hall, sometimes through references to actual Edwardian era performers such as [[Vesta Tilley]], or to characters on the show attending performances, and other times through the experiences of the popular character [[Sarah Moffat]], who left domestic service several times and often ended up going on stage to support herself when she did.
* British rockers [[Queen (band)|Queen]] incorporated music hall styles into several of their songs, such "[[Killer Queen]]" (1974) and "[[Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy]]" (1976).
* [[Garry Bushell]]'s [[punk pathetique]] band, The Gonads (formed 1977), did rock versions of music hall songs. Many punk pathetique acts were indebted to the music hall tradition.
* Between 1978 and 1984, BBC television broadcast two series of programmes called ''The Old Boy Network''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/o/oldboynetworkthe_1299002400.shtml ''The Old Boy Network''] accessed 10 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; These featured a star (usually a music hall/variety performer, but also some younger turns like [[Eric Sykes]]) performing some of their best known routines while giving a slide show of their life story. Artistes featured included [[Arthur Askey]], [[Tommy Trinder]], [[Sandy Powell (comedian)|Sandy Powell]], and [[Chesney Allen]].
* In [[Vivian Stanshall]] and [[Ki Longfellow|Ki Longfellow-Stanshall's]] musical, ''[[Stinkfoot, a Comic Opera]]'' (1985), the lead performer is an ageing music hall artiste named Soliquisto.
* [[Sarah Waters]]'s book ''[[Tipping the Velvet]]'' (1998) revolves around the world of music halls in the late Victorian era, and in particular around two fictional "mashers" ([[drag kings]]) named Kitty Butler and Nan King.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/tippingthevelvet/ BBC Drama – description] accessed 10 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* The modern Players' Theatre Club provides a brief impression of contemporary music hall in the film ''[[The Fourth Angel]]'' (2001), where [[Jeremy Irons]]' character creates an alibi by visiting a show.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0254334|title=The Fourth Angel}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The name of music hall singer [[Ida Barr (music hall)|Ida Barr]] (1882-1967) was appropriated some 40 years after her death by [[Chris Green (writer/performer)|Christopher Green]] for an unrelated, non-[[Tribute act|tribute]] [[Drag queen|drag act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thereviewshub.com/latitude-festival-2017-ida-barr/ |title=Latitude Festival 2017 |date=2017 |work= |publisher=The Reviews Hub |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surviving music halls==
[[File:Hackney_Empire%2C_Hackney%2C_E8_%283749526243%29.jpg|thumb|The Hackney Empire, 2009]]
London was the centre of music hall with hundreds of venues, often in the entertainment rooms of public houses. With the decline in popularity of music hall, many were abandoned, or converted to other uses such as cinemas, and their interiors lost. There are a number of purpose-built survivors, including the [[Hackney Empire]], an outstanding example of the late music hall period ([[Frank Matcham]] 1901). This has been restored to its Moorish splendour and now provides an eclectic programme of events from opera to "Black Variety Nights". A mile to the south is [[Hoxton Hall]], an 1863 example of the saloon style. It is unrestored but maintained in its original layout, and currently used as a community centre and theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artandarchitecture.org.uk/stories/rhys-jones_hackney.html?ixsid=J7TWorWcJK9 ''Hackney Empire'' Art and Architecture] accessed 1 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the neighbouring borough, Collins Music Hall (built about 1860) still stands on the north side of [[Islington Green]]. The hall closed in the 1960s and currently forms part of a bookshop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=471 "Islington: Social and cultural activities",] ''A History of the County of Middlesex'': Volume 8: Islington and Stoke Newington parishes (1985), pp. 45–51, accessed: 1 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Clapham]], [[Grand Theatre, Clapham|The Grand]], originally the Grand Palace of Varieties (1900), has been restored, but its interior reflects its modern use as a music venue and nightclub.&lt;ref&gt;''The Stage Guide and Directory'' (1912)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Greenwich Theatre]] was originally the Rose and Crown Music Hall (1855), and later became Crowder's Music Hall and Temple of Varieties. The building has been extensively modernised and little of the original layout remains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Greenwich.htm ''Theatres and Halls in Greenwich, London'' (Arthur Lloyd)] accessed: 1 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:London-coliseum.jpg|thumb|left|1904 London Coliseum, Matcham theatre with London's widest proscenium arch]]
In the nondescript Grace's Alley, off Cable Street, [[Stepney]], stands [[Wilton's Music Hall]]. This 1858 example of the "giant pub hall" survived use as a church, fire, flood and war intact, but was virtually derelict, after its use as a rag warehouse, in the 1960s. The Wilton's Music Hall Trust has embarked on a fund-raising campaign to restore the building.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Honri ''John Wilton's Music Hall, The Handsomest Room in Town'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007, the [[World Monuments Fund]] added the building to its list of the world's "100 most endangered sites".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,2098219,00.html ''In praise of Wilton's music hall''] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 8 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The music video of the [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] single "[[Relax (song)|Relax]]" was shot here. Many of these buildings can be seen as part of the annual [[London Open House]] event.

There are also surviving music halls outside London, a notable example being the [[Leeds City Varieties]] (1865) with a preserved interior. This was used for many years as the setting for the BBC television variety show ''[[The Good Old Days (UK TV series)|The Good Old Days]]'', based on the music-hall genre. The [[Bradford Alhambra|Alhambra Theatre, Bradford]] was built in 1914 for theatre impresario Francis Laidler, and later owned by the [[Oswald Stoll|Stoll]]-[[Edward Moss|Moss]] Empire. It was restored in 1986, and is a fine example of the late [[Edwardian era|Edwardian style]]. It is now a ''receiving theatre'' for touring productions and opera.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/BradfordTheatres/BradfordAlhambraTheatre.htm ''Alhambra Theatre and Majestic Cinema, Morely Street, Bradford, West Yorkshire'' (Arthur Lloyd)] accessed 1 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Nottingham]], the [[Malt Cross]] music hall retains its restored cast-iron interior. It is run as a cafe bar by a Christian charitable trust promoting responsible drinking, also as the location of a safe space late at night and for operating a street pastor service. It is an award-winning and popular venue true to its original purpose of providing a venue for up-and-coming musical acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maltcross.com|title=Malt Cross - Cafe bar &amp; events venue, Nottingham city centre|work=maltcross.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Grand Opera House, Belfast]], Frank Matcham 1895, was preserved and restored in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goh.co.uk/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=44 ''Over 106 Years of Theatre Going at Northern Ireland's Premier Theatre'' (Grand Opera House)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011040/http://www.goh.co.uk/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=44 |date=28 September 2007 }} accessed 1 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gaiety Theatre, Isle of Man|Gaiety Theatre]], [[Isle of Man]] is another Matcham design from 1900&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iom.com/gaietytheatre/ ''The Gaiety Theatre'' (Isle of Man)] accessed 1 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; that remains in use after an extensive restoration programme in the 1970s. In [[Glasgow]], the [[Britannia Music Hall]] (1857), by architects Thomas Gildard and H.M. McFarlane, remains standing, with much of the theatre intact but in a poor state, having closed in 1938. There is a preservation trust attempting to rescue the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glasgowmerchantcity.net/britanniapanopticontrust.htm ''Scotland's Last Surviving Music Hall'' (Britannia Theatre Trust)] accessed 1 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the few fully functional music hall entertainments is at the [http://www.bricklanemusichall.co.uk Brick Lane Music Hall] in a former church in [[North Woolwich]]. The Players' Theatre Club is another group performing a Victorian-style music hall show at a variety of venues, and [[The Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America]] stage music hall-style entertainments.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

'''''Nexus: The Jupiter Incident''''' is a [[List of science fiction themes|science fiction themed]] real-time tactics computer game developed by the Hungarian-based [[Mithis Entertainment]]. The game focuses on [[Military tactics|tactics]] and ship management instead of resource collection and base construction.

==Gameplay and features==
In each of the game's missions, the player is given a small number of large space ships (always less than ten, and sometimes just one or two), along with accompanying fighters and bombers. The ships are large and cumbersome, and the battles between fleets protracted, giving the game a noted cinematic feel.&lt;ref name=gamespot&gt;{{cite web |author=Jason Ocampo |date=March 9, 2005 |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nexus-the-jupiter-incident-review/1900-6120086/ |title=Nexus: The Jupiter Incident Review |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nexus uses the Blacksun Engine, made specifically for the game. Based on [[DirectX 9]], it makes extensive use of vertex and pixel shaders, a parametric particle system, and other visual effects.

==Story==
The game is set in the 22nd Century. The player is Marcus Cromwell, a famed spacecraft captain whose father, Richard Cromwell, the first spaceborn human, captained the colony ship ''Noah's Ark'' through a wormhole near [[Mars]] that was presumed destroyed when the wormhole collapsed. Cromwell sets out on the SpaceTech heavy corvette, the ''Stiletto'', for [[Jupiter]].

The events that unfold are "The Jupiter Incident", which escalates into an interstellar war. Cromwell engages in battle with several ships and responds to a Kissaki Syndicate (a rival corporation) research base's SOS call. Inside, he finds a cruiser-sized ship of alien origin, named the ''Angelwing'' by the Kissaki. The ship's logs show the corporation has another hidden base close to [[Pluto]], with the base that sent out the SOS call being a distraction for the top-secret research being carried out at the Pluto base.

A normal ship would require almost 4 years to make the trip; however, the ''Angelwing'' can make the trip in several weeks using its special IP Drive. After a battle with the Syndicate fleet for the control of the ''Angelwing'', Cromwell is given command of the cruiser and ordered to investigate the secret base. At Pluto, an [[artificial intelligence]], named Angel, uploads herself into the ''Angelwing'' and commands Cromwell to escape from a strange entity - later known as a Mechanoid - through a nearby [[wormhole]], the same wormhole that collapsed near Mars.

Cromwell finds himself in the Noah system populated by the colonists from ''Noah's Ark'', who survived the wormhole collapse and started a colony. The '''Noah Colony''' fights as a mercenary race for an advanced but peaceful alien race, called the '''Vardrags''', against another powerful race, the bloodthirsty, reptilian '''Gorgs''', and a local group of renegade Vardrag elites, known as the '''Raptors'''.

After a successful raid at the Raptor's base, they are then enlisted again to fight against the Gorg Empire. In fights against the Gorg, the Ghosts occasionally seem to help the ''Angelwing''. However, all the races would soon find themselves facing their greatest threat: a virulent race of [[nanomachines]] called the '''Mechanoids'''. Nothing seems capable of stopping the Mechanoid invasion, and the Vardrag homeworld and Earth are overrun. Only an organic, insectile race, known as the energy-consuming '''Locusts''', are immune to the Mechanoids. With technology adapted from the Locusts, Cromwell is able to rescue Earth and all the other solar systems and shut down the main control system of the Mechanoids, the '''Entity'''.

The fate of Angel, who fought the Mechanoids, is left ambiguous, as she was not shown leaving the Entity and returning to the Angelwing.

===Aliens===
'''Vardrags''' One of the most advanced races in the game. Their main home system is Chakaris (which was eventually evacuated after the attack of the mechanoids on Chakaris III). They are very peaceful and have many strong allies, like the Noah colonists and the Ghosts. Their squadrons are led by the fearful Raptors. Though they do not know much of war tactics, they could gather very useful information on the enemy and could subsequently defeat them. Catacalysm missile is one of the deadliest creations of this alien group.

'''Gorgs''' Terrific and bloodthirsty and enemies of Vardrags and their allies. Though most of the clans of the Gorgs are brave, some, like the Raghara clan, execute many cowardly attacks. They do not even fear the Black Moon. The siege laser is one of the deadliest weapons of this alien group. Notable ships are ''Titan'' base and ''Warcry'' (Gorg Emperor's ship).

'''Ghosts''' Terribly intelligent creatures. Their home system is Mist and generally perform stealth missions for the Vardrags. Their ships have a special ability of camouflage.

'''Locust''' Insect like creatures. Like ants or honey bees, their community is divided into warriors, workers and queen. The Energy Skeeter is their most powerful weapon.

'''Raptors''' They are actually the fearsome allies of Vardrags, but some turn rogue against their masters and revolt against them. They are subsequently massacred by the Noah colonists.

==History==
''Nexus: The Jupiter Incident'' was developed by the Hungarian-based Mithis Entertainment, intended by the publisher [[Cdv Software Entertainment|CDV]] originally as ''[[Imperium Galactica]] 3''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=James Yee |date=October 10, 2012 |url=http://www.kickstarter-conversations.com/2012/10/nexus-2-interview.html |title=Nexus 2 Interview |publisher=[[Kickstarter]] |quote=''Nexus had a long history already before it was published. The game was developed by Mithis, a Hungarian games development studio in Budapest. They had signed the game at the time with German publisher CDV. CDV decided that they wanted a license for the game and they acquired the license for Imperium Galactica. So, the game we know as Nexus would have been Imperium Galactica 3 as far as CDV was concerned.'' |accessdate=July 26, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131118102020/http://www.kickstarter-conversations.com/2012/10/nexus-2-interview.html |archivedate=November 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the business relationship between Mithis and CDV broke apart and also the Imperium Galactica license got lost, the game was revised together with Most Wanted Entertainment as tactical strategy game.

The game was finally released in Europe in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Stew Shearer |date=April 26, 2014 |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/goodoldreviews/11352-Nexus-The-Jupiter-Incident-Rigid-Space |title=Nexus: The Jupiter Incident - Rigid Space |publisher=''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in North America in 2005 for Windows.

===Sequel===
A technical demonstration video for the sequel, ''Nexus: The Jupiter Incident 2'', was "[[Internet leak|leaked]]" to the Internet in 2006.

On August 16, 2011 Most Wanted Entertainment announced a sequel, named ''Nexus 2'', on the [[crowdfunding]] website ''GamesPlant'' with a funding goal of €400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bluesnews.com/a/2457/most-wanted-team-up-with-gamesplant-to-bring-nexus-2-to-fans|title=Most Wanted team up with GamesPlant to bring Nexus 2 to fans |publisher=Blue's News |year=2011 |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The €104,867 pledged fell short of the €400,000 goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.games-plant.com/nexus2/ |title=Nexus 2 |publisher=''GamesPlant'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104204447/http://www.games-plant.com/nexus2/ |archivedate=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the original Nexus was [[Digital distribution|digitally]] re-released on [[GOG.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Fallout-Junge |date=September 26, 2012 |url=http://www.gamersglobal.de/news/59156/gog-nexus-the-jupiter-incident-60-prozent-guenstiger |title=GOG: Nexus - The Jupiter Incident 60 Prozent günstiger |language=German |publisher=Gamers Global}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 28, 2012 a second campaign on [[Kickstarter]] was launched to fund the development of a sequel named ''Nexus 2: The Gods Awaken'', but ultimately failed to raise the required amount, with only $161,731 of the $650,000 goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mostwanted/nexus-2-the-gods-awaken |title=Nexus 2: The Gods Awaken (PC &amp; MAC) |publisher=[[Kickstarter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016 a [[Patch (software)|patch]] was released for the game fixing long standing issues, like [[widescreen]] support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spacesimcentral.com/ssc/topic/5480-nexus-just-got-really-nice-update/ |title=Nexus just got really nice update |publisher=SpaceSimCentral.com |date=March 21, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913044437/http://spacesimcentral.com/ssc/topic/5480-nexus-just-got-really-nice-update/ |archivedate=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''No More Love, No More Death''''' is a 1993 [[Hong Kong action cinema|Hong Kong action film]] directed by [[Herman Yau]] and starring [[Jacky Cheung]], [[Rosamund Kwan]] and [[Carina Lau]]. The film is a prequel to the 1992 film, ''[[With or Without You (1992 film)|With or Without You]]'', and was produced in response to the popularity of Cheung's character, "Prince".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldscreen.com.tw/goods.php?offset=3&amp;goods_id=8612|title=〈聞天祥專欄〉配角變主角！10部讓他們從綠葉變一哥的電影}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[Triad (organized crime)|Triad]] leaders White Tiger (Chan Yuen) and Green Dragon ([[Michael Chan (actor)|Michael Chan]]) become enemies while fighting for the objection of Yuk-fung (Yip San). Tiger abducts the child Prince and fabricates a story of how his mother was abducted by Dragon. Since then, prince was determined to study martial arts in order to kill Dragon and rescue his mother. Prince was trained by Tiger to be a killer, and killing Dragon have become Prince's goal. One day, when Prince ([[Jacky Cheung]]) had the chance to kill Dragon, he sees his dream lover, Tweedy ([[Rosamund Kwan]]), and as a result, fails to kill Dragon, breaking his reputation of never making mistakes on missions. Prince's assistant, Ching-ching ([[Carina Lau]]), whom is deeply in love with him, arranges Tweedy to seemingly disappear for a while for the sake of him. However, Prince mistakenly believes that Ching-ching betrayed him and killed Tweedy and begins to drink heavily. Because he thinks Tweedy is dead, Prince feels hopeless. Later, Tiger calls Dragon out to meet with him, telling him that Prince is actually Dragon's son, a fact that Prince did not expect. When Tiger and Dragon were arguing who is truly Prince's father, Tiger points his gun at Prince and blames Prince for his resentments. During a battle, Ching-ching gets shot and killed by Tiger in order to protect Prince. Afterwards, Prince sadly carries Ching-ching away, reminiscing a time when Ching-ching asked him whether he will cry when she dies. Later, Tweedy also tells Prince that Ching-ching entrusted her to not meet with him until he kills Dragon. Prince did not say a word, and silently watches the distant sunset with Tweedy.

'''P.{{nbsp}}D.{{nbsp}}Q.{{nbsp}}Bach''' is a fictitious composer invented by musical [[satirist]] "Professor" [[Peter Schickele]]. Schickele developed a five-decade-long career, performing the "discovered" works of the "only forgotten son" of the [[Bach family]]. Schickele's music combines [[Parody music|parodies]] of [[musicology|musicological]] scholarship, the conventions of [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Classical period (music)|classical]] music, and [[slapstick]]. The name "P.{{nbsp}}D.{{nbsp}}Q." is a parody of the three-part names given to some members of the [[Bach family]] that are commonly reduced to initials, such as C.{{nbsp}}P.{{nbsp}}E., for [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]]. ''PDQ'' is an [[initialism]] for "[[wikt:PDQ|pretty damned quick]]".

Schickele began working on the character while studying at the [[Aspen Music Festival and School]] and at [[Juilliard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schlueter|first1=Paul|title=P. D. Q. Bach satirist a seriously good humor man|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2002-12-28/entertainment/3426419_1_pdq-juilliard-musical|website=www.mcall.com|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has performed a variety of P. D. Q. Bach shows over the years. ''[[The Village Voice]]'' mentions the juxtaposition of collage, bitonality, musical satire, and orchestral surrealism in a "bizarre melodic stream of consciousness". "In P.D.Q. Bach he has single-handedly mapped a musical universe that everyone knew was there and no one else had the guts (not simply the bad taste) to explore."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Classical Trash|url = http://www.villagevoice.com/music/classical-trash-6422519|website = Village Voice|access-date = 2016-02-21|first = Kyle|last = Gann}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012 he has decreased touring due to age. He performed two concerts to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his first concert at [[The Town Hall (New York City)|The Town Hall]] in New York on December 28 and 29, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/20/arts/music/peter-schickele-brings-pdq-bach-back-to-the-stage.html "Peter Schickele Brings P.

Oestreich]],''[[The New York Times]]'', December 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to give live concert performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schickele.com/concerts/|title=Peter Schickele Concert Schedule|author=|date=|work=schickele.com|accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Schickele gives a humorous fictional biography of the composer&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;Schickele, Peter. ''The Definitive Biography of P. D. Q. Bach''&lt;/ref&gt; according to which P. D. Q. Bach was born in Leipzig on April 1, 1742,&lt;ref name="bio3"&gt;Schickele, Peter. ''The Definitive Biography of P. D. Q. Bach'', page 3: "the night of the 1st of April, 1742," "giving birth to his twenty-first child," "at one minute after midnight"&lt;/ref&gt; the son of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[Anna Magdalena Bach]]; the twenty-first of Johann's twenty children.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; He is also referred to as "the youngest and oddest of Johann Sebastian’s 20-odd children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Schickele: 50 Years of P.D.Q. Bach: A Triumph of Incompetence!|url=http://www.corningcivicmusic.org/index.php?page=S1415C6|website=Corning Civic Music Association|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died May 5, 1807,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schickele.com/pdqbio.htm|title=P.D.Q. Bach Bio|author=|date=|work=schickele.com|accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; though his birth and death years are often listed on album literature in reverse, as "(1807–1742)?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schickele.com/shoppe/pdqrec/evening.htm|title=An Evening With P.D.Q. Bach (1807-1742)?|author=|date=|work=schickele.com|accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schickele, P. D. Q. "possessed the originality of [[Johann Christian Bach|Johann Christian]], the arrogance of [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|Carl Philipp Emanuel]], and the obscurity of [[Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach|Johann Christoph Friedrich]]."&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;{{rp|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3hmSAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT23&amp;lpg=PT23 23]}}

==Music==
{{Main|List of works by P. D. Q. Bach}}
Schickele's works attributed to P. D. Q. Bach often incorporate comical rearrangements of well-known works of other composers. The works use instruments not normally used in orchestras, such as the [[bagpipes]], [[slide whistle]], [[kazoo]], and fictional or [[experimental musical instrument|experimental]] instruments such as the pastaphone (made of uncooked [[manicotti]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1D9153CF936A15751C1A96F948260|title=Oh, No! Still More (Quite a Bit More!) From P. D. Q. Bach|author=Blau, Eleanor|date=25 December 1998|accessdate=18 August 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Tromboon|tromboon]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dolmetsch.com/defst4.htm Tromboon] at [[Arnold Dolmetsch|Dolmetsch]] Music Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; [[hardart]], [[whirly tube|lasso d'amore]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dolmetsch.com/defsl.htm Lasso d'amore] at [[Arnold Dolmetsch|Dolmetsch]] Music Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; and left-handed sewer flute.

[[File:Tromboon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Tromboon]]
There is often a startling juxtaposition of styles within a single P. D. Q. Bach piece. The ''Prelude to Einstein on the Fritz'', which alludes to [[Philip Glass]]' opera ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]'', provides an example. The underlying music is [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s first prelude from ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', but at double the normal speed, with each phrase repeated interminably in a [[Minimalist music|minimalist]] manner that parodies Glass's. On top of this mind-numbing structure is added everything from [[jazz]] phrases to snoring to heavily harmonized versions of "[[Three Blind Mice]]" to the chanting of a meaningless phrase ("Koy Hotsy-Totsy," alluding to the art film ''[[Koyaanisqatsi]]'' for which Glass wrote the score). Through all these mutilations, the piece never deviates from Bach's original harmonic structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gann|first1=Kyle|title=Classical Trash|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/classical-trash-6422519|website=The Village Voice|accessdate=14 December 2015|date=19 January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The humor in P. D. Q. Bach music often derives from violation of audience expectations, such as repeating a tune more than the usual number of times, [[resolution (music)|resolving]] a musical chord later than usual or not at all, unusual key changes, excessive dissonance, or sudden switches from [[High culture|high art]] to [[Popular culture|low art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title = Music-engendered laughter: an analysis of humor devices in PDQ Bach | author = David Huron | url = http://www.musicog.ohio-state.edu/Huron/Publications/MP040049.PDF |format=PDF| booktitle = Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Music | year = 2004 | pages = 700–704 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further humor is obtained by replacing parts of certain classical pieces with similar common songs, such as the opening of [[Symphony No. 2 (Brahms)|Brahms' Symphony No. 2]] with "[[Beautiful Dreamer]]", or rewriting Tchaikovsky's ''[[1812 Overture]]'' as the ''[[1712 Overture]]'', with "[[Yankee Doodle]]" replacing Tchaikovsky's melody, and "[[Pop Goes the Weasel]]" replacing "[[La Marseillaise]]".

=== Compositional periods ===
Schickele divides P. D. Q. Bach's fictional musical output into three periods: the Initial Plunge, the Soused Period, and Contrition. During the Initial Plunge, P. D. Q. Bach wrote the ''Traumerei'' for solo piano, an ''Echo Sonata'' for "two unfriendly groups of instruments", and a ''Gross Concerto for Divers Flutes, two Trumpets, and Strings''. During the Soused (or Brown-Bag) Period, P. D. Q. Bach wrote a ''Concerto for [[Horn &amp; Hardart]]'', a ''[[Sinfonia concertante|Sinfonia Concertante]]'', a ''Pervertimento for Bicycle, Bagpipes, and Balloons'', a ''Serenude'', a ''Perückenstück'' (literally German for "Hairpiece"), a Suite from ''The Civilian Barber'' (spoofing [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''[[The Barber of Seville]]''), a ''Schleptet'' in E-flat major, the half-act opera ''[[The Stoned Guest]]'' (the character of "The Stone Guest" from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]''), a ''Concerto for Piano vs. Orchestra'', ''Erotica Variations'' ([[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Eroica Variations]]''), ''Hansel and Gretel and Ted and Alice'', an opera in one unnatural act ([[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Humperdinck]]'s ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hansel and Gretel]]'' and the 1969 film ''[[Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice]]''), ''The Art of the Ground Round'' ([[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''[[The Art of Fugue]]''), a ''Concerto for Bassoon vs. Orchestra'', and a ''[[Grand Serenade for an Awful Lot of Winds and Percussion]]''.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

During the Contrition Period, P. D. Q. Bach wrote the [[cantata]] ''Iphigenia in Brooklyn'' ([[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]]'s ''[[Iphigénie en Aulide|Iphigenia in Aulis]]'', etc.), the [[oratorio]] ''The Seasonings'' ([[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]]'s ''[[The Seasons (Haydn)|The Seasons]]''), ''Diverse Ayres on Sundrie Notions'', a ''Sonata for Viola Four Hands'',&lt;ref name="fourhands"&gt;The term ''four hands'' refers to the playing of one instrument, most commonly a piano, by two players at once.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[chorale prelude]] ''Should'', a ''Notebook for Betty Sue Bach'' ([[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''[[Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach]]'' and [[Buddy Holly]]'s "[[Peggy Sue (song)|Peggy Sue]]"), the ''Toot Suite'', the ''Grossest Fugue'' ([[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Große Fuge|Grosse Fuge]]''), a ''Fanfare for the Common Cold'' ([[Aaron Copland|Copland]]'s ''[[Fanfare for the Common Man]]'') and the canine cantata ''Wachet Arf!'' (Bach's ''[[Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, BWV 140|Wachet auf]]'').&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

A final work is the mock religious work ''Missa Hilarious'' ([[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Missa Solemnis]]'') (Schickele no. N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O – the chemical formula of [[nitrous oxide]] or "laughing gas").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portrait of P. D. Q. Bach|url=http://www.schickele.com/shoppe/pdqrec/portrait.htm|website=The Peter Schickele Web Site|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tromboon==
{{Listen|filename=Tromboon-sample.ogg|title=Tromboon example}}
[[File:Tromboon-det.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tromboon detail; the bassoon reed is on the left]]
The '''tromboon''' is a musical instrument made up of the [[reed (instrument)|reed]] and [[bocal]] of a [[bassoon]], attached to the body of a [[trombone]] in place of the trombone's [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]]. It combines the sound of [[Reed (instrument)#Double reeds|double reeds]] and the [[Slide (wind instrument)|slide]] for a distinctive and unusual instrument. The name of the instrument is a [[portmanteau]] of "trombone" and "bassoon". The sound quality of the instrument is best described as comical and loud.

The tromboon was developed by Peter Schickele, a skilled bassoonist himself, and featured in some of his live concert and recorded performances. Schickele called it "a hybrid&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; that's the nicer word&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; constructed from the parts of a bassoon and a trombone; it has all the disadvantages of both".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Use of music therapy for surgical recovery==

According to Britain's ''[[The Daily Telegraph]],'' Seivewright underwent a [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|quadruple-bypass operation]] in 2000, and used a work by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] for purposes of [[music therapy]]. The ''Telegraph'' reported that Seivewright 

:"was determined that if he didn't wake up, the last music he listened to would be the 'greatest music ever written': the opening orchestral movement [sic] of Bach's [[Matthäuspassion|St Matthew Passion]]." 

(The opening movement ''"Kommt, ihr Töchter, helft mir klagen,"'' actually a [[choir|chorus]] with orchestra, is evidently meant.) However, the operation was successful, and though Seivewright attributed this to his surgeon, the ''Telegraph'' commented that "Bach's music floating around in his subconscious was certainly a contributory factor."&lt;ref name=teleg&gt;{{cite web

Prostitution is common in [[Managua]]. Prostitutes work on the streets, in nightclubs and bars, or in [[massage parlor]]s.

Prostitutes are known locally as "zorras".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Live in Nicaragua - The Lay of the Land|url=http://www.liveinnicaragua.com/pages/chapter01.html|website=Live in Nicaragua|accessdate=2 January 2018|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
From 1880 to 1927 there were no prostitution laws. Prostitutes, [[pimps]] and madams were charged with [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]]. Prostitution was legalised and regulated from April 1927.  Prostitutes has to register and have a weekly health check. Those who did not comply were fined by the police, or after 1933 the [[National Guard (Nicaragua)|National Guard]].&lt;ref name="gonzalezr"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gonzalez-Rivera|first1=Victoria|title=Before the revolution : women's rights and right-wing politics in Nicaragua, 1821-1979|date=2011|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, Pa.|isbn=978-0271048710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1955 a law was passed prohibiting the promotion of prostitution. By then the national Guard had taken control of prostitution in the country. The only people jailed for controlling prostitution were those who wouldn't pay the required bribes.&lt;ref name="gonzalezr" /&gt;

Starting in the 1960s President [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle|Somoza's]] business empire moved into prostitution and gambling houses. The National Guard (who Somoza was the head of), through being bribed, ensured these establishments flourished. After Somoza was deposed in 1979 by the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] (FSLN)), one of their first actions was the destruction and burning of "a great number of brothels, bars and gambling houses". The FSLN had previously advocated the elimination of prostitution in its 1969 manifesto, but this was never enacted.&lt;ref name="gonzalezr" /&gt;

==Facilitadoras judiciales==
Nicaragua became the first country to train sex workers to be official representatives of the government and the judicial system.&lt;ref name="costa"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Custer|first1=Jeff|title=Nicaragua trains sex workers as judicial facilitators - Inside Costa Rica|url=http://insidecostarica.com/2015/06/04/nicaragua-trains-sex-workers-judicial-facilitators/|website=Inside Costa Rica|accessdate=2 January 2018|date=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a pilot scheme, 16 sex workers were trained as "Facilitadoras judiciales" (judicial facilitators).&lt;ref name="costa" /&gt; This led to a further 60 sex workers being trained.&lt;ref name="tico"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morel|first1=Blanca|title=Nicaragua prostitutes study law to help others in trouble|url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2015/04/07/nicaragua-prostitutes-study-law-to-help-others-in-trouble|website=Tico Times|accessdate=2 January 2018|date=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eventual aim is to have at least six sex workers trained in every municipality (153).&lt;ref name="qcosta"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicaragua Certifies Prostitutes as Paralegals|url=http://qcostarica.com/nicaragua-certifies-prostitutes-as-paralegals/|website=Q Costa Rica|accessdate=2 January 2018|date=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scheme was organised by the Sunflowers ''Sex Workers’ Association'' and is part of a larger initiative that has trained 4,300 facilitators in the country.&lt;ref name="tico" /&gt; The scheme is endorsed by the Nicaraguan Judicial System.&lt;ref name="costa" /&gt; Vice-president Marvin Aguilar said "We are the only country in the world that treats sex workers as ‘judicial facilitators’.  The only country in the world that does not try and arrest them, where the activity is not criminalized.”&lt;ref name="costa" /&gt;

The judicial facilitators have the following tasks:
* Help local judges in proceedings
* They disseminate civic-legal laws and regulations among the population
* Advise and accompany the population in judicial and administrative proceedings
* Carry out mediations in cases that the Law allows
* They send the corresponding authorities the cases that are not within their competence.

==HIV==
{{main|HIV/AIDS in Nicaragua}}
With only 0.2 [[percent]] of the adult population estimated to be [[HIV]]-positive, [[Nicaragua]] has one of the lowest HIV prevalence rates in [[Central America]]. HIV was first detected in Nicaragua in 1987, after concentrated [[epidemic]]s had been reported in other Central American nations. The onset of the epidemic was likely delayed by Nicaragua’s 10-year civil war and the U.S.-led economic blockade, both of which left the country isolated for several years. Relative control over commercial sex work, low infection rates among injecting drug users, and a ban on the commercial sale of blood also slowed HIV transmission.&lt;ref name="usaid"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/lac/nicaragua_profile.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090421234455/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/lac/nicaragua_profile.pdf |archive-date= 21 April 2009 |title= Health Profile: Nicaragua |last= |first= |date= June 2008 |website= [[United States Agency for International Development]] |publisher= |access-date= 7 September 2008 |quote= }} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A September 2005 study on HIV among commercial sex workers reported by UNAIDS demonstrated a prevalence of only 0.2 percent in that group.&lt;ref name="usaid" /&gt; This had increased to 2.6% in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HIV prevalence amongst sex workers |url=http://www.aidsinfoonline.org/gam/stock/shared/vc/vcshare.html?id=d9c0ff12-f62c-44e7-8e2c-dbe736bbea30 |website=www.aidsinfoonline.org |publisher=UNAIDS |accessdate=22 July 2018 |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child Prostitution==
[[Child prostitution]] is widespread, particularly in [[Managua]], port cities, along the Honduran and Costa Rican borders, and near highways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_10/issue_07/travel_01.html |title=Child prostitution: the ugliest part of tourism |website=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2017-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040422200216/http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_10/issue_07/travel_01.html |archivedate=2004-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/tda2004/nicaragua.htm Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) - U.S. Department of Labor]. Dol.gov. Retrieved on 2011-03-30.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The law permits juveniles 14 years of age or older to engage in prostitution.&lt;ref name="state1" /&gt; According to Casa Alianza, between 1,200 and 1,500 girls and young women work in the brothels of Managua, and almost half are under the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_10/issue_07/travel_01.html Child prostitution: the ugliest part of tourism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625130547/http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_10/issue_07/travel_01.html |date=2012-06-25 }}. Thepanamanews.com. Retrieved on 2011-03-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Every night, hundreds of teenage girls line the Masaya Highway commercial corridor on the capital's south side. [[Street children]] engage in prostitution, often to support a drug habit.

Nicaragua is a destination for [[Child sex tourism|child sex tourists]] from the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicaragua Trafficking in Persons Report 2017|url=https://ni.usembassy.gov/our-relationship/official-reports/trafficking-persons-report-2017-share/|publisher=US Department of state|accessdate=2 January 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law imposes a penalty of five to seven years' imprisonment for convicted sex tourism offenders.&lt;ref name="state1" /&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Nicaragua}}
Nicaragua is principally a source and transit country for women, and children subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. Nicaraguan women and children are subjected to sex trafficking within the country and in other [[Central American]] countries, [[Mexico]], and the United States. Many trafficking victims are recruited in rural areas or border regions with false promises of high-paying jobs in urban centres and tourist locales, where they are subjected to sex trafficking. Victims’ family members are often complicit in their exploitation, and traffickers have reportedly increased recruitment activity on social media sites. Nicaraguan women and children are subjected to sex trafficking in the [[North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region|RAAN]] and [[South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region|RAAS]], where the lack of strong law enforcement institutions and a higher crime rate increase the vulnerability of the local population. 

Nicaraguans from Northern-Central departments who migrate to other Central American countries and Europe are reportedly vulnerable to sextrafficking. During the reporting period, Nicaraguans were reported as among the primary nationalities of victims identified in Guatemala. In addition, children left by these migrants in Nicaragua reportedly become vulnerable to sex trafficking. 

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Nicaragua as a [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2 Watch List]] country.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Nicaragua 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282720.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5219">The '''Si Stebbins stack''' is a cyclic mathematical card stack. It was popularized by the magician Si Stebbins, and can be constructed from a standard 52-card deck.&lt;ref&gt;Tamariz, Juan. ''Mnemonica''. Hermetic  Press, 2004, p. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently used in card magic, its properties allow the position and value of each card in a deck to be determined.

== Order of stack ==
Each card in a Si Stebbins stack alternates suit in the CHaSeD order (Clubs Hearts Spades Diamonds), and has a numerical value three greater than the preceding card. The Aces are given the numerical value of 1 and the Jack, Queen, and King of each suit are given the values 11, 12, and 13 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Stebbins, Si. ''Card Tricks And The Way They Are Performed''. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, in a deck in Si Stebbins order, {{cards|Ac|}} is followed by the {{cards|4H|}}, {{cards|7s|}}, {{cards|10d|}}, and {{cards|Kc|}}.

The deck stack is considered cyclic as any card in the deck can be used to determine the value and position of any other card in the deck.&lt;ref&gt;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CyclicGroup.html&lt;/ref&gt; The bottom card of the deck is in order with the top card of the deck making the order of cards an endlessly repeating cycle. A deck in Si Stebbins order can be cut any number of times without disturbing the order.&lt;ref&gt;Stebbins, Si. ''Card Tricks And The Way They Are Performed''. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Si-stebbins1.jpg|thumb|Si-stebbins1]]

== Arranging a deck in Si Stebbins order ==
The arrangement can be started at any card but in the pamphlet ''Card Tricks And The Way They Are Performed'' Stebbins recommends starting with the {{cards|6H|}} and arranging the deck in the following order reading from top left to bottom right:&lt;ref&gt;Stebbins, Si. ''Card Tricks And The Way They Are Performed''. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Hearts !! Spades !! Diamonds !! Clubs
|-
| 6 || 9 || Queen || 2
|-
| 5 || 8 || Jack || Ace
|-
| 4 || 7 || 10 || King
|-
| 3 || 6 || 9 || Queen
|-
| 2 || 5 || 8 || Jack
|-
| Ace || 4 || 7 || 10
|-
| King || 3 || 6 || 9
|-
| Queen || 2 || 5 || 8
|-
| Jack || Ace || 4 || 7
|-
| 10 || King || 3 || 6
|-
| 9|| Queen || 2 || 5
|-
| 8 || Jack || Ace || 4
|-
| 7 || 10 || King || 3
|}

==Using the stack to determine a selected card==
The value of a card selected from a deck in Si Stebbins order can be determined by the card immediately preceding or following it.

In ''Card Tricks And The Way They Are Performed'' Stebbins instructs the performer to have a card selected and cut the cards above the selection to the bottom of the deck. Then, by looking at the bottom card, the spectators selection can be revealed.

For instance, if the card on the bottom is the {{cards|9d|}}, the performer will add three to the numeric value making 12 (or Queen) and move to the next suit in the order (Clubs). The selected card is the {{cards|Qc|}}.&lt;ref&gt;Stebbins, Si. ''Card Tricks And The Way They Are Performed''. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Mathematical card stacks in which each card's value progresses by 3, 4, or 5 are detailed in magic literature as early as the 16th Century.&lt;ref&gt;Tamariz, Juan. ''Mnemonica''. Hermetic  Press, 2004, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The system was originally published in the [[United States]] in [[Boston]] or [[New York City]] around 1898 by Si Stebbins (real name William Coffrin), in a pamphlet titled ''Si Stebbins' Card Tricks And The Way He Performs Them'' and a later edition ''Card Tricks And The Way They Are Performed''.&lt;ref&gt;Tamariz, Juan. ''Mnemonica''. Hermetic  Press, 2004, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite contrary claims, Stebbins maintained that the stack was his invention:
{{quote|...I am the ORIGINATOR of this system for doing these tricks, and the first Vaudeville Artist to present them in the better class theaters of the United States.

In fact, the first time they were ever presented to an American vaudeville audience was by myself, at the Columbia Theater, St. Louis, Mo., during the season of 1898-9, and on the Keith and Orpheum Circuits the season of 1900.

I am printing this statement to refute the claims of a few would-be imitators.
|Si Stebbins|Card Tricks And The Way They Are Performed. p.9}}

[[Howard Thurston]] claimed to have invented the system in his 1903 book ''Howard Thurstons Card Tricks'' referring to it as "The 'Thurston' System of Expert Card Manipulation." and thanking Stebbins "...for many valuable 
suggestions and ideas with regard to its conception."&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, Howard. ''Howard Thurstons Card Tricks''. 1903, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The card stack is generally known as Si Stebbins today, and is referred to as such in many card magic books including ''The Encyclopedia of Card Tricks'' and ''Expert Card Technique''.&lt;ref&gt;Hugard, Jean. ''Expert Card Technique''. Dover Press 1st Edition, 1974, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2448">'''Siyaw Chemane''' ([[Hawrami dialects|Hawrami]]: {{lang|ku|Siyaw Çemane}}, {{lang|ckb|سیاو چەمانە|rtl=yes}}) is a style of singing practiced by ethnic Kurds that originated in the mountainous sub-region of [[Hawraman]] along the border between [[Iranian Kurdistan]] and [[Iraqi Kurdistan]]. Some reaserchers claim that the style was originally used to recite hymns by members of the Zoroastrian faith, and later, members of Islamic [[Sufi]] faiths. Originally, Siyaw Chemane is performed without the use of any instruments, with the exception of the occasional use of a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[daf|hand-drum]]. Today, the Siyaw Chemane style is used mostly for storytelling and entertainment. Some modern [[Kurds|Kurdish]] artists have adopted the style and added instruments to record songs that blend Siyaw Chemane with other Kurdish music.&lt;ref&gt;Izady, Mehrdad. The Kurds: A Concise Handbook, Taylor &amp; Francis.{{ISBN|0-8448-1727-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Siyaw Chemane is performed in the [[Hawrami dialects|Hawrami]] dialect of [[Gorani language (Zaza-Gorani)|Gorani]]. However, some modern artists have adopted the style for use with [[Sorani]], which is more commonly spoken by ethnic [[Kurds]].

==Etymology==

''Siyaw Chemane'' literally means dark eyes in [[Hawrami dialects|Hawrami]]. In the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] culture, big dark and black-colored eyes are regarded as a trait of beauty particularly for women. [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] love songs often talk about dark eyes. The ''Siyaw Chemane'' style of singing is often an expression of love - whether love for God or love for another person - and may be the reason for its association with dark eyes.

==Similar Methods of Singing==
There are some similar methods of singing in Kurdish music, specially in Music of south of Kurdistan, [[Kermanshah Province|Kermanshah (Kermashan) Province]], [[Ilam Province]] and [[Laks (Iran)|Lak]] inhabitant regions of [[Luristan Province]] in [[Iranian Kurdistan]] and [[Diyala Province]] in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]]. Siyaw Chamane is so close and similar to [[Houreh]] singing, and also [[Mour]] singing, and [[Benmelli]] singing which are belong to those regions of south of Kurdistan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9064">Television stations in [[Slovakia]] broadcast in [[DVB-T]] format. Broadcasting is mostly in the Slovak language, state owned channels have some dedicated broadcasting for ethnic minorities (always subtitled). Foreign language (with the exception of Czech) movies and shows are dubbed (rarely subtitled). Czech production is mostly broadcast in original, with the exception of juvenile programs. Often, foreign language movies are broadcast with Czech dubbing. Czech television channels are also rather popular in Slovakia, received either directly in border regions or carried by cable companies.

'''''The Call of the Wild''''' is a 2007 [[documentary film]] by the independent filmmaker [[Ron Lamothe]]. The premise details the odyssey of [[Christopher McCandless]] as Lamothe takes a road trip across [[North America]] to the places McCandless visited.&lt;ref name="San Francisco Chronicle"/&gt;  Within the film, Lamothe reaches conclusions about McCandless' death which contradict both [[Sean Penn]]'s film ''[[Into the Wild (film)|Into the Wild]]'' (2007) and [[Jon Krakauer]]'s book ''[[Into the Wild (book)|Into the Wild]]'' (1997), on which Penn's film was based.&lt;ref name=Allmovie&gt;{{cite web|last=Southern|first=Nathan|title=The Call of the Wild (2007)|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-call-of-the-wild-v422332/|publisher=[[Allmovie]]|accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denver Film Society"/&gt;

== Content ==
In 2006, Ron Lamothe, decided to make a [[road trip]] documentary on Christopher McCandless. Lamothe was inspired by McCandless' story even before the book ''Into the Wild'' (1997) was published, as both he and McCandless were born in 1968 and graduated from college in 1990. They also shared the same roommate at one time in their lives, and Lamothe took a life-changing trip to [[Africa]] during the same time as McCandless' travels. 

After a brief swim in [[Walden Pond]], Lamothe begins his journey to [[Annandale, Virginia]], where McCandless grew up and went to high school. Lamothe then journeys to [[Emory University]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], where McCandless graduated in May 1990, and attends the 2006 graduation ceremony. Also attending the ceremony is filmmaker [[Sean Penn]], who coincidentally was then filming a [[Blockbuster (entertainment)#Blockbuster films|major motion picture]] about McCandless. Lamothe interviews a few graduates on their plans after college in hopes of finding a "McCandless" in the crowd while comparing the graduates to the free-spirited [[Generation X]].

Lamothe then ventures to [[California]] and visits [[Slab City]], where McCandless had stayed during the [[Christmas and holiday season|Christmas holidays]] in 1991. Lamothe tours [[Salvation Mountain]] and interviews Leonard Knight, who built the site and claims to have met McCandless during McCandless' stay. 

On June 3, Lamothe and a friend travel to [[Lake Mead National Recreation Area|Lake Mead]] and discuss the casting choice of [[Emile Hirsch]] as McCandless in the upcoming film. They incidentally pass through Penn's production as he sees two yellow [[Datsun B-210]] props, the same car McCandless drove and later lost during a [[flash flood]]. Lamothe has the entire Lake Mead to himself without being bothered by Penn's crew, who chose to film in a different location.

Lamothe then decides to visit [[Carthage, South Dakota]], where McCandless took on a job working at a [[grain elevator]] in September 1990 and in April 1992. Like McCandless, Lamothe travels to Carthage solely by [[hitchhiking]]. Lamothe travels through [[Colorado]] with an ex-drug dealer—who used to live in [[Alaska]]-and along [[I-80 (Nebraska)|I-80]] through [[Nebraska]] to [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]] with a group of young adults who enjoy collecting mushrooms alongside the road. After days of hitchhiking, Lamothe finally makes it to Carthage but learns that no one in the town will take interviews for his documentary, since they are under contract by [[Paramount Vantage]] for Penn's film. However, Lamothe does get to interview the truck driver who gave McCandless a ride from Carthage to [[Enderlin, North Dakota]], as his life story was not owned by Paramount.

After departing Carthage, Lamothe travels through [[Canada]] but this time as the driver. He agrees to pick up any hitchhiker he sees but unfortunately doesn't find any along the way. 

Finally, Lamothe arrives in [[Fairbanks, Alaska]], where he interviews a few locals at a bar who only have criticisms about McCandless. Lamothe sets out on the [[Stampede Trail]] on foot, but when he tries to cross the [[Teklanika River]], his camera becomes damaged, leading him to think his film is ruined. However, unknown to Lamothe, his camera is fine as he attempts to film as much of Bus 142 (where McCandless died in August 1992) as possible. After a few nights at the bus, Lamothe travels back home to Massachusetts and returns to his normal life.&lt;ref name=Allmovie/&gt;

=== New findings ===
Lamothe documents several later findings that contradict Krakauer's book and Penn's film. He reports that McCandless was not poisoned by wild potato seeds as Krakauer had suspected, and that such poisoning had been disproved by toxicology reports. However, later findings reported by Krakauer and Anchorage reporter Craig Medred&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adn.com/article/20150110/fiction-jon-krakauers-wild&lt;/ref&gt; may supersede those earlier reports.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2013/09/how-chris-mccandless-died.html&lt;/ref&gt; Penn's film depicted McCandless being poisoned by wild foods he mistakenly had eaten.&lt;ref name="San Francisco Chronicle"/&gt;

Lamothe also reveals that McCandless did not destroy his driver's license nor [[Social Security number|social security card]], nor did he burn all his cash as depicted in the book and film. In a hidden pocket on McCandless' backpack was found his wallet with all forms of [[Identity document|ID]] and [[US$]]300 in cash.&lt;ref name="San Francisco Chronicle"/&gt;

Lamothe further suspects that McCandless had an arm or shoulder injury not shown in the famous self-portrait photo by the bus, in which McCandless' shirt sleeve has the appearance of being empty. Lamothe believes, based on McCandless' S.O.S. note, that McCandless had injured his arm or [[Dislocated shoulder|dislocated his shoulder]], and thus could not have swum across the [[Teklanika River]] to escape.&lt;ref name=Allmovie/&gt;

==Reception==
The film screened October 8 and 9, 2007 as part of the San Francisco Documentary Film Festival,&lt;ref name="San Francisco Chronicle"&gt;{{cite news|last=Harmanci|first=Reyhan|title=Movie: 'Call of the Wild'|url=http://www.sfgate.com/thingstodo/article/Movie-Call-of-the-Wild-2520681.php|accessdate=August 17, 2013|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=September 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Film Lounge"/&gt; and the [[University of Alaska]] hosted the [[Fairbanks]] premiere of the film December 10, 2007.&lt;ref name="University of Alaska"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cole|first=Terrence|title=Event, film offers alternate view on McCandless story|url=http://uafcornerstone.net/news/a_news/20071206130716.html|accessdate=August 17, 2013|newspaper=[[University of Alaska]]|date=December 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Denver Film Festival#Information|Denver Film Society]] offered that the film mounted "a thoughtful challenge to Jon Krakauer's ''Into the Wild'' (and actor-director Sean Penn's screen adaptation thereof), ''The Call of the Wild'' presents an alternative to the popular account of Chris McCandless, the self-styled 'aesthetic voyager' who died alone in the Alaskan wilderness in 1992 at age 24."   They further noted Lamothe's, while filming, having several "run-ins" with Penn who was, in the same time-frame and locations, himself involved in the making of a production about McCandless, and made note of how Penn's production had "the clout to thwart Lamothe at many a turn." They concluded: "ultimately, however, what lies at the film's core is Lamothe's own journey of discovery. The conceit allows him to explore the concept of wilderness and its influence on the American psyche, as well as its reflection on our cultural landscape; the generation gap as measured by changing rites of passage; and the disparity between independent and Hollywood filmmaking."&lt;ref name="Denver Film Society"&gt;{{cite web|last=staff|title=The Call Of The Wild|url=http://www.denverfilm.org/filmcenter/detail.aspx?id=21455|publisher=[[Denver Film Festival#Information|Denver Film Society]]|accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United Kingdom|British]] [[film critic]] Neil Young wrote that the film was a "disarmingly fresh, utterly engrossing documentary" in how it addressed "specific details of McCandless's controversial life (and even more controversial demise)" by director Ron Lamothe covering "a surprisingly expansive amount of geographic and thematic terrain as he journeys cross-county – driving, then hitchhiking – in McCandless's footsteps."  In watching the production, Young offered "the film becomes not so much about McCandless or Lamothe (though it's certainly to some degree a portrait of both) but a more general rumination on the ambitions and limitations of the generation to which both belonged (the picture is part-dedicated to 'Generation X') and also a celebration of rural America's more eccentric backwaters."&lt;ref name="Film Lounge"&gt;{{cite news|title=DVD review: Call of the Wild |url=http://www.jigsawlounge.co.uk/film/reviews/december-roundup-1-the-call-of-the-wild-plus-briefer-comments-on-cthulhu-hohokam-etc/ |accessdate=August 17, 2013 |newspaper=[[Neil Young (disambiguation)|Neil Young's Film Lounge]] |date=July 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Suite101]]'' compares the different media depicting McCandless' journey and death. They note Sean Penn's version makes McCandless into a societal hero who burns his identity and money in a personal quest to exile himself from the material demands and obligations of modern society. The feel that although slightly different, the depictions by Krakauer and Lamothe were more down-to-Earth, and note that while Krakauer's version has McCandless divest himself of all identification, Lamothe's version attempted to be more accurate in its revealing that McCandless' wallet was discovered inside the wreckage of the bus, and that it contained his social security card, birth certificate, driver's licence, health card, map, and even library card, as well as $300 cash.&lt;ref name=Suite101&gt;{{cite news|last=Alexandre|first=Ayza P |language=French|title="Into the Wild": la vérité sur l'aventure de McCandless|url=http://suite101.fr//article/into-the-wild-la-verite-sur-laventure-de-mccandless-a21984|accessdate=August 17, 2013|newspaper=[[Suite101]]|date=December 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Juneau Empire]]'' wrote that release of the Krakauer book and the Penn and Lamothe films "cemented the mystique of Christopher McCandless" and there has been an increase of visitors coming to Alaska to retrace his steps.  They also reported that 25 miles east of the site of the wrecked bus, residents of the [[Healy, Alaska]], feared the influx of unprepared visitors "making dangerous pilgrimages for a character portrayed as a spiritual visionary rather than an ill-prepared misfit, as many Alaskans view McCandless."  While the wrecked 1940s-era [[International Harvester]] bus had been used for decades as a shelter by hunters, hikers, and other backwoods travelers, there is an area-wide worry about the safety of unprepared visitors "who are determined to make it to the bus no matter what." &lt;ref name="Juneau Empire"&gt;{{cite news |last=D'Oro |first=Rachel |title='Into the Wild' pilgrimages increase |url=http://juneauempire.com/stories/063008/sta_297709091.shtml |accessdate=August 17, 2013 |newspaper=[[Juneau Empire]] |date=June 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Washington Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=staff|title=‘Into the Wild’ tours on rise|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/jul/01/into-the-wild-tours-on-rise/|date=July 1, 2008|publisher=[[The Washington Times]]|accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[SFist]]'' wrote that while the film's first half appears to be more about Ron Lamothe and less about Christopher McCandless, the "documentary gets good at the end and there are some interesting theories and revelations (the popular theory that McCandless died from poison seeds/berries is refuted)", and the film could have used better editing. They also felt that the amount of time Lamothe spent documenting the people who picked him up while he hitchhiked in a manner emulating McCandless', was "a use of screen time that seems beyond self-indulgent."&lt;ref name="SFist"&gt;{{cite news|last=staff|title=DocFest: Call Of The Wild|url=http://sfist.com/2007/10/03/docfest_call_of.php|accessdate=August 17, 2013|newspaper=[[SFist]]|date=October 3, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214052240/http://sfist.com/2007/10/03/docfest_call_of.php|archivedate=February 14, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Kentucky Educational Television]]'' made note that, through the following of Christopher McCandless' footsteps, Ron Lamothe's film "uncovers never-before-seen evidence that sheds new light on the case, and the mystery surrounding his death", directly contradicting Jon Krakauer's interpretations in the book ''Into the Wild'' and those made in Sean Penn's film adaption of Krakauer's book.&lt;ref name="Kentucky Educational Television"&gt;{{cite news|last=Soileau|first=Ellen|title=Documentary traces voyager’s journey, tragic end Uncovers real story behind Into the Wild|url=http://www.ket.org/pressroom/2009/23/cawi__.html|accessdate=August 17, 2013|newspaper=[[Kentucky Educational Television]]|date=May 22, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608135512/http://www.ket.org/pressroom/2009/23/cawi__.html|archivedate=June 8, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fair details==
The World of Pet Supplies fair is held every year between the 20 and 23 April. The event in 2011 was the 26th fair, with more visitors and exhibitors expected than in the previous year, given the [[popularity]] that this event has gained. The largest fair of this type is held in [[Hong Kong]], in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. Here, pet owners can get anything for their pets from dog wheels to accessories, grooming supplies, cages, [[aquarium]] supplies and everything is needed in a [[house]] which accommodates [[pets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petsuppliesdeal.com/dog.html|title=Dog Pet Supplies|date=|accessdate= 2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the fair officially starts on the 20th of April, the afternoon of the day prior to the opening is reserved for the registration of the [[buyers]]. Everyone who wants to attend this fair must be registered and in most cases a pre-registration is required. The latter can be done via the official website of the fair. The three main days of the fair are the 20th, 21st and 22nd. The fair is then open from 9am to 6:30pm, and the buyers may register in the same days with 30 minutes before the fair starts or ends. The last day of the World of Pet Supplies fair is shorter and the event takes place only from 9am to 5pm.

The World of Pet Supplies is sponsored by different political bodies such as the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, [[Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce]], The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, The Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong, The Hong Kong Exporters' Association, The Indian Chamber of Commerce, Hong Kong and the Trade and Industry Department along with the HKSAR Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hktdc.com/fair/hkhousewarefair-en/s/681/HKTDC-Hong-Kong-Houseware-Fair/Fair-Details.html|title=Fair Details|date=|accessdate= 2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organizers of this event, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council is a statutory body that has been functioning since 1966. The HKTDC has the mission to promote [[trade]] within Hong Kong by encouraging the financial activity of the [[small and medium-sized enterprises]]. The aim of the corporation is to support the manufacturers, traders and service providers whose businesses are based in Hong Kong. Of its 40 international offices, 11 are situated on [[Chinese mainland]]. By organizing this type of trade event, the HKTDC is aiming to promote Hong Kong as a platform for doing business with China and throughout [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hktdc.com/mis/ahktdc/en/s/abt-hktdc-about.html|title=The World's Full Service Trade Promotion Organisation|date=|accessdate= 2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Society for the Voluntary Control of Fair and Exhibition Statistics (FKM) more than 2,000 exhibitors have been present at this fair and the event managed to attract over 25,000 visitors and potential buyers. According to FKM, the majority of visitors came from Asia (approximately 52%) and [[Europe]] (18%) followed by America (13%). As expected, most of the exhibitors present at the fair up until now have been from Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland (1,356 out of a total of 2,149).

In order to be eligible for admission, visitors must be older than 18. Exhibitors on the other hand must comply with more complex criteria. Firstly, exhibitors that wish to participate at this fair must be legally registered companies/businesses carrying on business either in Hong Kong or in their [[country of origin]] in accordance with applicable [[laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hktdc.com/fair/hkhousewarefair-en/s/431-For_Exhibitor/HKTDC-Hong-Kong-Houseware-Fair/Rules-&amp;-Regulations.html|title=Rules &amp; Regulations|date=|accessdate= 2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prove so, exhibitors are likely to be asked for their latest registration certificate or other documents that can provide proof of a [[bona fide]] business. There is also a fee that must be paid by every exhibitor and which depends on the type of booth the exhibitor wants to use. The smallest fee is of $4,680 for a standard booth of 9 m2. Exhibitors who need wide spaces to display their products may get a raw space of at least 27 m2, for $455/m2.

World of Pet Supplies is the special highlight of the HKTDC [[Hong Kong Houseware Fair]] and is held at the same time as the HKTDC Hong Kong International Home Textiles Fair. The zones of the fair are themed and there is a Hall of Elegance with products intended for designer collections and brand names, ASEAN which is a group of pavilions from countries belonging to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and World of Fine Dining which includes bar accessories, [[kitchenware]] and [[tableware]] of [[High Quality|high quality]]. The World of Pet Supplies is the fair designed for selling and buying products that are pet related.

'''XPAND 3D''' developed [[LCD shutter glasses|active-shutter 3D]] solutions for multiple purposes. The company was founded by Maria Costeira and Ami Dror in 1995 as X6D Limited. The company deployed over 15,000 cinemas world wide. 

== XPAND 3D Cinema ==
The XPAND cinema 3D systems can be both [[active shutter 3D system|active]] or [[Polarized 3D system|passive]] 3D system.

In passive 3D system, silver screen is used and polarized filters on both projector and 3D glasses send either left or right image to appropriate eye and thus creating stereoscopic image in viewer's brains.

== Home use ==
XPAND 3D glasses are one of several brands of 3D shutter glasses that can be used in both in theaters and at home, in both [[Digital cinema]] and [[3DTV]] respectively. 

== Other applications of XPAND technology ==
Other than its cinema and consumer electronic divisions, the 3D technologies developed by XPAND are used in education and professional environments. 

== Standardization of 3D protocols ==
In August 2011 [[Panasonic]], [[Samsung]] and [[Sony]] along with XPAND 3D announced an agreement called the "Full HD 3D Glasses Initiative" to develop a standard for 3D glasses on consumer products including televisions, computers and projectors, based on XPAND's technology.  Previously the companies had their own standards for 3D glasses and they were incompatible with each other.  The press release in the announcement said, "Universal glasses with the new IR/RF protocols will be made available in 2012, and are targeted to be backward compatible with 2011 3D active TVs."&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/5828667/the-manufacturers-are-finally-standardizing-3d-glassestogether The Manufacturers Are Finally Standardizing 3D Glasses…Together] at Gizmodo.com&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4658">'''Zamrock''' is a musical genre that emerged in the 1970s in [[Zambia]]. It is described as a combination of traditional African music with [[psychedelic rock]] and [[funk]]. 

It has been described as the combined sound of [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[James Brown]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/22/zamrock-zambia-music-rerelease|title=Why Zamrock is back in play|last=S|first=Henning Goranson|last2=Press|first2=berg for Think Africa|date=2013-07-22|website=the Guardian|access-date=2017-05-25|last3=Network|first3=part of the Guardian Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Zamrock bands were also influenced by the heavy repetitive riffs of bands like [[Black Sabbath]], [[Blue Cheer]], the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]], [[Deep Purple]], and [[Cream (band)|Cream]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.musicinafrica.net/magazine/salt-thunder-mind-altering-rock-1970s-zambia|title=Salt &amp; thunder: The mind-altering rock of 1970s Zambia|date=2015-12-11|work=Music In Africa|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Rikki Ililonga]] and his band [[Musi-O-Tunya]] are generally credited as the creators of this genre. Other notable artists include [[Witch (Zamrock band)|WITCH]],&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/5657 WITCH] on Dusted Magazine (Apr. 15, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Peace]], [[Amanaz]], [[Chrissy "Zebby" Tembo]], and [[Paul Ngozi|Paul Ngozi and his Ngozi Family]].&lt;ref name="azambianband"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://theappendix.net/issues/2014/7/were-a-zambian-band | title=We’re a Zambian Band | publisher= theappendix.net | accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Zamrock's roots can be traced back to the 1950s, with northern singers from the [[Copperbelt Province]] such as [[Stephen Tsotsi Kasumali]], [[William Mapulanga]], and [[John Lushi]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Zamrock as a musical movement came of age in the turbulent first decade after Zambia's independence from British colonialism, rising and falling in tandem with the country's economic success.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nowagainrecords.com/announcing-welcome-to-zamrock/|title=Announcing: Welcome To Zamrock!|website=Now-Again|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zambia's boom from its copper mines led to a bust when copper prices fell and the country was devastated by the [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|AIDS epidemic]] of the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After the country announced its independence in 1964, then-president [[Kenneth Kaunda]] decreed that 95% of music played on radio stations had to be Zambian in origin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The rush to urbanization in mine-adjacent regions meant a variety of new artistic styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theappendix.net/issues/2014/7/were-a-zambian-band|title=We’re a Zambian Band|last=Smith|first=Chris|date=2014-08-05|website=The Appendix|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The country's newfound wealth brought with it urban sensibilities and a surge in interest in electric guitar use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Zamrock player [[Paul Ngozi]] of the Ngozi Family is credited with creating the [[kalindula]] sound, a rhythmic pop music sound with fuzzy electric guitar leads centred around the bass guitar of the same name.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While the price of copper fell and Zambia's economy crashed, Zambia found itself surrounded by political turmoil in neighbouring states. When the country offered to shelter refugees, Zambia's power stations were bombed. Once-prosperous cities were at the mercy of blackouts and curfews.&lt;ref name="azambianband" /&gt; Musicians were reduced to playing unstable sets during daylight hours while their ticket prices became unaffordable for most.&lt;ref name="azambianband" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2014/01/zamrock-introduction-feature|title=Zamrock: An Introduction|last=|first=|date=|website=daily.redbullmusicacademy.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every member of [[Witch (Zamrock band)|WITCH]] except Emanuel “Jagari” Chanda died of AIDS by 2001.&lt;ref name="azambianband" /&gt;

A resurgence of interest across the globe in recent years, including reissues in North America and the production of a documentary, has allowed some Zamrock performers, including Jagari, to tour, perform, and record new material.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
