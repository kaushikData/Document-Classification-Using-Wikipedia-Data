===Consonants===
*[[voiced dental fricative]]: ð, a sound near to English voiced "th", generally after vowels, like in 'taðuk' (cockroach).
*palatal stops: front 'g' and 'k', like in 'kačče' (chin) and girib (cry).
*[[voiced velar fricative]]: γ, like in 'jeγarek' (hailstone).
*[[alveolar trill]]: like in 'borre' (flail).

==Grammar==

===Verbs===
Infinitive markers: -san, -tan, -dan.

===Nouns===
Stresses on different vowels make nouns definite or indefinite. Example:&lt;br&gt;
že (woman), tuhu (house).&lt;br&gt;
Definite: žení (the woman), tevedí (the house).&lt;br&gt;
Indefinite: žéni (a woman), tevédi (a house).

The plural is marked by the suffixes: -gal, -al, -u and -yu. Examples:&lt;br&gt;
sib (apple) → sib-yu (apples)&lt;br&gt;
morb (hen) → morb-u (hens)&lt;br&gt;
âdam (person) → âdam-gal (persons)

'''Alipur Sign Language''' is an endangered [[village sign language]] of [[India]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/7175?hl=en|title=Alipur Sign Language|last=|first=|date=|website=The Endangered Languages Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is spoken in the village of [[Alipur, Karnataka]], a [[Shia]] Muslim enclave with a high degree of [[Hearing loss|congenital deafness]]. There are between 150 and 250 deaf people in Alipur,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://elar.soas.ac.uk/Collection/MPI126665|title=Investigation of an endangered village sign language in India|last=Sobaji|first=Panda|date=|website=Endangered Languages Archive at SOAS University of London|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are approximately 10,000 hearing people speaking the language&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; on a population of 26,000 (in 2015). The language has no official statute and deaf children receives no formal education. This fact plus the increasing influence of the [[Indian Sign Language]] threaten the survival of Alipur Sign Language (or APSL&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uclan.ac.uk/research/explore/projects/sign_languages_in_unesco_atlas_of_world_languages_in_danger.php|title=Alipur Sign Language (APSL)|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Central Lancashire|series=CATALOGUING ENDANGERED SIGN LANGUAGES|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Sibaji Panda was the first person to officially document the language in 2012.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1515/9781614511496.353|title=Sign Languages in Village Communities|last=Panda|first=Sibaji|publisher=DE GRUYTER|year=2012|isbn=9781614511496|series=Sign Language Typology [SLT]|location=Basel|pages=253–260|chapter=Alipur Sign Language: A sociolinguistic and cultural profile|doi=10.1515/9781614511496.353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his study, Panda found out that the proportion of deaf population in Alipur was of approximately 0.75%, against 0.41% on national average (data from the 2011 census).

The deaf community of Alipur helped Panda in his researches, particularly Mir Fazil Raza, a 49 year old former gram [[Panchayati raj|panchayat chief]], who helped set up the Alipur Unity Society. Mr. Faza helped with translation from English to the sign language, conducted survey with the help of other members of the community, and served as an informator for the documentation of the language.

Endogamous marriages in the village have led to this large population of deaf, but a deaf man cannot marry a deaf woman. Since there is no public records in the village, it is difficult to established the veracity of this information.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Linguistic Typology|last=Zeshan|first=Ulrike,|last2=Escobedo Delgado|first2=Cesar Ernesto|last3=Dikyuva|first3=Hasan|last4=Panda,|first4=Sibaji|last5=de Vos|first5=Connie|publisher=DE GRUYTER|year=2016|volume=17|location=Basel|pages=357–396|chapter=Cardinal numerals in rural sign languages: Approaching cross-modal typology|issn=1613-415X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sign language is used by many hearing person, with level of fluency that greatly varies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The language has a variety of ways to express numbers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2013/07/27/village-sign-languages-vanishing-fast/JKD8eE0LRHpbWW8YZsYPvO/story.html|title=Village sign languages, vanishing fast|last=Friedman|first=Joshua J.|date=July 28, 2013|website=Boston Globe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; using additions and subtractions to express complex numbers. Mouth movements can be added to express bigger numbers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The majority of the village inhabitants are Muslim in a region with a Hindu majority. The Shia population descent from [[Iran]]ian migrants and are proud of their culture and history.

The younger generation is less interested in using the village sign language. Mobility and technology gives them access to the Internet and they travel to Bengaloru where they learn Indian Sign Language and [[American Sign Language]]. The lack of formal education is nevertheless a barrier for them to be able to use script-based applications (like text messaging) and there aren't many employment opportunities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A better understanding of the situation of the language could be beneficial for the population. There is hope to re-open the school for special need children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1515/9781614511496.313|title=Sign Languages in Village Communities|last=Dikyuva,|first=Hasan|last2=Delgado|first2=Cesar Ernesto Escobedo|last3=Panda|first3=Sibaji|last4=Zeshan|first4=Ulrique|publisher=DE GRUYTER|year=2012|isbn=9781614511496|series=Sign Language Typology [SLT]|location=Basel|pages=313–404|chapter=Working with village sign language communities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''As-salāmu ʿalaykum''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{script/Arabic|السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ}} {{IPA-ar|æs.sæˈlæːmu ʕæˈlæjkʊm|}}) is a greeting in [[Arabic]] that means "peace be upon you". The greeting is a religious salutation among [[Muslim]]s when greeting. &lt;ref name="Ccnmtl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/mmt/mxp/notes/5140.html |title="As-Salaamu-Alaikum" and "Wa-Alaikum-as-Salaam" |publisher=Ccnmtl.columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical response to the greeting is ''wa ʿalaykumu s-salām'' ({{script/Arabic|وَعَلَيْكُمُ السَّلَام}} {{IPA-ar|wæ ʕæˈlæjkʊmu s.sæˈlæm|}}) "and peace be upon you".

This greeting appears in greatly abbreviated forms in many languages from [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] to [[Urdu]] as some variant of ''salām'' ({{lang|ar|سَلَام}}; cf. [[Persian language|Persian]] {{lang|fa|سلام}} {{IPA-fa|sæˈlɒːm|}}).

==Pronunciation==
The phrase is normally pronounced according to local [[Arabic dialects|dialects]] of speakers and is very often shortened.

For example:
* In Egypt: {{IPA-arz|sæˈlæːmu ʕæˈleːku, we ʕæˈleːkom es.sæˈlæːm|}}.
* By native English speaking Muslims: {{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|l|æ|m|u|_|ə|ˈ|l|aɪ|k|ʊ|m|,_|w|ɑː|_|ə|ˈ|l|aɪ|k|ʊ|m|_|ʊ|s|ə|ˈ|l|æ|m}}

==Grammatical variants==
The expression uses the second person plural masculine, even when used to address one person. It may be modified by choosing the appropriate [[Arabic grammar#Enclitic pronouns|enclitic pronoun]] to address a person in the masculine and feminine singular form, the dual form, or the feminine plural form. The conjugations are as follow (note: according to the standard pronunciation rules of [[Classical Arabic]], the last short vowel in each word is not pronounced unless it is followed by another word):

* masculine singular ''as-salāmu ʿalayka'' ({{script/Arabic|عَلَيْكَ}}) 
* feminine singular: ''as-salāmu ʿalayki''  ({{script/Arabic|عَلَيْكِ}})
* dual: ''as-salāmu ʿalaykumā'' ({{script/Arabic|عَلَيْكُمَا}})
* feminine plural: ''as-salāmu ʿalaykunna'' ({{script/Arabic|عَلَيْكُنَّ}})

A third-person variant, [[Peace be upon him (Islam)|'' ʿalayhi as-salām'' "peace be upon him"]], is often used by Muslims for prophets other than Muhammad and for named angels.

== In Islam ==
{{Fiqh|etiquette}}

It is also preferred to use the greeting when arriving and also while leaving. It was reported that [[Abu Hurairah]] said "When one of you joins a gathering, let him say 'Peace'. When he wants to get up and leave, let him say 'Peace'. The former is not more important than the latter" (Hasan hadith reported in [[Jami` at-Tirmidhi|Jāmiʿ at-Tirmidhi]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/ref/4052|title=Is it ''mustahabb'' for one who gets up to leave a gathering to say ''salaam'' to those who are still sitting?|author=[[Muhammad Al-Munajjid|Sheikh Muhammad Salih Al-Munajjid]] |publisher=[[IslamQA]].info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* According to [[hadith]], [[Muhammad]] was asked who should begin the greeting and he said, "The one who is riding should greet the one who is walking and the one who is walking should greet the one who is sitting and the smaller group should greet the larger group" (''[[Sahih al-Bukhari|Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī]]'', 6234; Muslim, 2160).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=As Salaamu Alaikom? |url=http://www.inspiredmindsunlimited.com/as-salaamu-aylaykom.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120155617/http://www.inspiredmindsunlimited.com/as-salaamu-aylaykom.html |archive-date=2010-11-20}}{{deadlink|date=January 2018}}{{reliable source|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is also stated that one should give the Salam greeting upon entering a house. This is based upon a verse of the Quran: "But when you enter the houses, greet one another with a greeting from God blessed and good" ([[An-Nur]] 24:61).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quran.com/24/61 |title=Surat An-Nur [24:61&amp;#93; - The Noble Qur'an - القرآن الكريم |publisher=Quran.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shortening the greeting to acronyms, such as ''A.S.'', ''As'kum'' (in [[Malaysia]]), or ''AsA'' is becoming common amongst Internet users in chat rooms and by people using [[Short Message Service|SMS]]. This trend is similar to writing (S) or SAWS in place of [[Peace be upon him (Islam)|''ṣallā llāhu ʿalayhi wa-sallam'']].

==Usage by non-Arabic speakers==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
* In [[India]], the greeting mostly among Muslims is accompanied by raising the right hand to the chest (arz hai "regards"; adaab "respect") or a simple handshake or hug, the shorter greeting "Salam" is used in informal situations. Goodbye is supplanted by a "Khuda hafiz" (secular/less formal or to an acquaintance) or "Allah hafiz" (less secular/generally to strangers, formal), both of which mean "May God keep you safe".
* In [[Afghanistan]], [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Iran]], ''Salām'' is used.
* In [[Albania]] and [[Kosovo]], a dimunitive form in the Albanian language, ''Selamun Alejkem'' or ''Selamun Alejqum'' is rarely used, the 'q' being a voiceless palatal stop typical of [[Turks in the Balkans|Balkan Turkish]] and Thracian Turkish phonology.&lt;ref&gt;https://humstatic.uchicago.edu/slavic/archived/papers/Friedman-TurkEncyc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Amharic]], the native [[Amharic]] term ''Selam'' is used in place of ''Tadias'', which is the equivalent of "What's up".
* In [[Turkey]] and [[Kazakhstan]], many religious people use this statement and shake hands and it is the same for saying "goodbye"; more secular and non-religious people say ''Selam'' as an equivalent to "Hello" or "Hi". However, many Turks pronounce it differently as "Selamün aleyküm".
* In [[Pakistan]], the greeting is also associated with shaking right hands and is also often accompanied with a hug when meeting infrequently (only between the same gender). In some places, people put a hand on their heart as they shake your hand and greet. Also, the full greeting is preferred versus the shorter greeting, "salam".
* In [[Bangladesh]], Assalamu alaykum is a simple greeting.
* In [[Uzbekistan]], Assalomu aleykum is used as an informal greeting.
* In [[Indonesia]], the greeting is usually{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} accompanied with a kind of two-handed "handshake", whereby the shaker's palms remain closed, and the fingers alone open to admit the other's proffered hand – which briefly touches the proffered's fingers or fingertips alone. In this way more adherent males and females may greet though touching – but remain true to the [[Islam]]ic or cultural teachings forbidding physical contact between the genders. Occasionally, the right hand will touch the left breast or heart area after this.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In Indonesia's [[Javanese people|Javanese/Sasak]] culture, a remnant of feudalism is retained, where an elder's proffered right hand is taken and pressed briefly against the forehead. Some may instead briefly kiss the hand or the main ring. This is very common for young children to greet older relatives (of their parents' age, though, on occasion, if very polite children, younger). In slang words, this greeting is sometimes referred as "samlekom".
* In [[Chechnya]] and other parts of Caucasus, Salam Aleykum is used to say hi.
* In [[Senegal]] which has a majority of Islam with [[Sufi]]-orientation, it is a common greeting. Spelled and pronounced in [[Wolof language|Wolof]]: "(a)sala maaleykum", and the reply "maa lekum salaam."
* In [[Xinjiang, China]], "Essalam eleykum" is used as a greeting by [[Uyghurs]], and the reply is "We'eleykum essalam".
* In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Brazil]], the expression "[[salamaleque]]" gained a totally distinct and curious meaning: because of the habit of Arabic cultures to bow down and wave the hand from the front ahead in greeting a person, the expression "salamaleque" is applied to exaggerated movements or acts in order to appear to be formal or entertaining or even fancy. "Os rapazes chegaram cheios de salamaleques".

He also rendered his services in the Assam Secretariat in Shillong from 1943 to 1947. In independent India appearing in the Assam Civil Service Examination held in 1949 for the first lime, he stood second in rank to bag a post of sub-deputy collector.

==46th President of Asam Sahitya Sabha==
In the session of 1979 of Asam Sahitya Sabha Atul Chandra Barua served as the 46th President in Session 1979-80 held in Sualkuchi.

==Retirement and afterwards==

In bringing fructification the dream project of the Singhapurush [[Radha Govinda Baruah]] the [[Nehru Stadium, Guwahati|Nehru Stadium]], Atul Chandra Barua played a pivotal role in the matter of allotment of the plot of Land for the purpose. He was also the moving force behind the establishment of the Ambikagiri Sishu Udyan at Nabagiri Road in [[Chandmari]]. 
Besides these Atul Chandra Barua also established the socio-literary organization Mukul Sangha in Shillong which is still standing erect with profound stature in society since its inception in 1945. In 1950, he formed the Jironi Mel its founder secretary; amongst many other organizations. The Guwahati Alochoua Chakra established by him in 1955 is now a very prominent one and holds meetings on a regular basis proffering opportunities to the budding and veteran writers to mingle together to derive mutual benefits. 
In spite of being an extremely busy person with administrative responsibilities of important nature, Atul Chandra Barua could find time enough to write and publish more than 30 books, besides editing about 15 literary and socially relevant journals and magazines including two vernacular dictionaries, of which Chalanta Abhidhan was an achievement of a great order, which was also jointly edited by stalwarts like Dr Maheswar Neog, Kirtinath Hazarika, etc. The first book named ‘Sarad Chandra Goswamir Samu Jiboni’ which was published in the year1946. Some others were ‘Purani Puthir Sadu’(1951), ‘Sahitya Ruprekha’(1957), ‘Ulat-Palat’(1957),  ‘Nabi Katha’(1963), Ojapali, its Different type and Functions (1982).
A lover of his birthplace to the core of his heart, Atul Chandra Barua undertook extensive and intensive research in the field of the culture of Darrang which is termed as 'Darrangi Kala Kristi' and for his yeoman service; he was conferred with the title 'Darrang Ratna'. He dedicated his post-retirement life for the cause of Darrangi culture until he breathed his last. 
An able administrator Atul Chandra Barua could visualize the future of Guwahati city even during the 50s and 60s. He was an advocate for maintenance and preservation of the water-bodies and open spaces in Guwahati, although he could not achieve that cherished desire for reasons galore. Activities that worked opposite to his wishes had become the order of the day, as a consequence of which the agonies of artificial floods have to be faced by the Guwahati denizens as a perennially celebrated festival. Had the same counsel of this visionary been put into action Guwahati today would have been a different place to live in. 
Although the great literary organization Asam Sahitya Sabha has been smeared with black soot by a few black sheep, its stature cannot be diminished by the misdeeds perpetrated by these people. Atul Chandra Barua was elected the president of the Sabha in 1979 at a time when Assam was facing a difficult phase. In the session of 1979 of [[Asam Sahitya Sabha]] Atul Chandra Barua served as the 46th President in Session 1979-80&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asamsahityasabha.org/?nextpresident]&lt;/ref&gt; held in [[Sualkuchi]], Atul Chandra Barua as its president played a very significant role to steer the organization for being a savior or Assamese society by protecting and preserving the art, culture, literature and language to stand alone as a unique part of India. Under his able and visionary leadership the Assam Sahitya Sabha also became a great force to be reckoned with in moving the historic six-year-long Assam Agitation spearheaded by the All Assam Students' Union (AASU) to reach the destination successfully. 
During his presidency and afterwards too, Atul Chandra Barua maintained good rapport with the society and various factions of the greater Assamese culture to forge unity amongst all the people of Assam irrespective of caste, culture, creed, religion, ethnicity etc. 
The selflessness of Atul Chandra Barua's personality was the most venerable one and for this aspect only. Prafulla Chandra Barua wrote a cheque in the name of Atul Chandra Barua as donation for the construction of the Lakhiram Barua Sadan in [[Guwahati]]. Moreover; his contribution in garnering financial aid for construction of the Radha Nath Handiqui Bhawan at Jorhat is also remembered by everyone. 
The relentless and silent deeds of Atul Chandra Barua for the all-round development of Assam would remain ingrained in public mind for years to come. It is, however, necessary to make the young and the posterior generation aware of the contributions of such a person to inspire them to become conscious citizens to be engaged ill the nation-building process. 
This is the birth centenary year of this beacon. Atul Chandra Barua's life is one to be emulated and we all are in a way duty-bound to be engaged for the well-being of the society following his footsteps.

'''Banket''', a [[South Africa]]n [[mining]] term, applied to the beds of [[auriferous]] [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], chiefly occurring in the [[Witwatersrand]] gold-fields. The name was given to these beds from their resemblance to a pastry, known in Dutch as ''banket'', resembling [[almond]] hard-bake. The word is the same as [[banquet]], and is derived ultimately from bank or bench, meaning table-feast, hence applied to any delicacy or to various kinds of [[confectionery]], a use now obsolete in English.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Banket|volume=3|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blinkenlights''' is a [[neologism]] for [[Blinkenlights#Actual blinkenlights|diagnostic lights]] usually on the [[front panel]]s on old [[mainframe computer]]s, [[minicomputer]]s, many early [[microcomputer]]s, and modern [[network hardware]]. It has been seen on many artifacts of modern office machinery as well, most notably photocopiers.

== Etymology ==

The [[Jargon File]] provides the following [[etymology]]:&lt;ref name=jar&gt;[http://jargon-file.org/archive/jargon-4.4.6.dos.txt Blinkenlights] entry in The Jargon File, version 4.4.6, 25 October 2003. ''jargon-file.org''. Retrieved 2015-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

This term derives from the last word of the famous [[blackletter]]-Gothic sign in mangled mock [[German language|German]] that once graced many computer rooms in the [[English language|English-speaking]] world. One version read:

{{quote box | align = center | quote = 
: '''[[:wikt:en:Achtung|ACHTUNG]]!'''
: ALLES [[:wikt:en:tourist|TURISTEN]] UND NON[[:wikt:en:Techniker|TEKNISCHEN]] LOOKENPEEPERS!
: DAS [[:wikt:en:Computer|KOMPUTERMASCHINE]] IST NICHT FÜR DER GEFINGERPOKEN UND MITTENGRABEN! ODERWISE IST EASY TO [[:wikt:en:schnappen|SCHNAPPEN]] DER SPRINGENWERK, BLOWENFUSEN UND POPPENCORKEN MIT SPITZENSPARKEN.

: ZO RELAXEN UND WATSCHEN DER [[:wikt:en:blinkenlight|BLINKENLICHTEN]].
}}

This silliness dates back to least as far as 1955 at [[IBM]] and had already gone international by the early 1960s, when it was reported at the [[University of London]]'s ATLAS computing site.
There are several variants of it in circulation, some of which actually do end with the word ''blinkenlights''.

Although the sign might initially appear to be in [[German language|German]] and uses an approximation of [[German grammar]], it is composed largely of words that are either near-homonyms of English words or (in the cases of the longer words) actual English words that are rendered in a faux-German spelling. As such, the sign is generally comprehensible by many English speakers regardless of whether they have any fluency in German. Much of the humor in these signs was their intentionally incorrect language.

[[Michael J. Preston (professor of English)|Michael J. Preston]] recites the gem as being posted above [[photocopier]]s in offices as a warning not to mess with the machine in the first print reference from 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last         = Preston| first        = Michael J.| year         = 1974| title        = Xerox-lore| url          = http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=inu.30000108623293| journal      = Keystone Folklore| publisher    = Pennsylvania Folklore Society| volume       = | issue        = 19| pages        = 11–26| doi          = | accessdate   = 2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sign is also reported to have been seen on an [[electron microscope]] at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in the 1950s.  Such pseudo-German parodies were common in [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] machine shops during and following [[World War II]], and an example photocopy is shown in the ''Jargon File''.

The ''[[Jargon File]]'' also mentions that German hackers have developed their own versions of the blinkenlights poster, in fractured English:&lt;ref name=jar/&gt;

{{quote | align = center |quote = 
'''ATTENTION'''&lt;br&gt;This room is fullfilled mit special electronische equippment. &lt;br&gt;Fingergrabbing and pressing the cnoeppkes from the computers is allowed for die experts only! &lt;br&gt;So all the “lefthanders” stay away and do not disturben the brainstorming von here working intelligencies. &lt;br&gt;Otherwise you will be out thrown and kicked anderswhere! &lt;br&gt;Also: please keep still and only watchen astaunished the blinkenlights.
}}

== Actual blinkenlights ==

The bits and digits in the earliest mechanical and [[vacuum tube]]-based computers were typically large, small in number, making it easy to see and often hear activity.  Then, for decades, computers incorporated arrays of indicator lamps in their control panels, indicating the values carried on the address, data, and other internal [[Bus (computing)|buses]], and in various registers. These could be used for diagnosing or "single-stepping" a halted machine, but even with the machine operating normally, a skilled operator could interpret the high-speed blur of the lamps to tell which section of a large program was executing, whether the program was caught in an [[endless loop]], and so on.

With rising processor [[clock rates]], increased memory sizes, and improved interactive debugging tools, such panel lights gradually lost their usefulness, though today most devices have indicators showing power on/off status, hard disk activity, network activity, and other indicators of "signs of life".

The original IBM PC could have a diagnostics card plugged into it that used [[LEDs]] to show what part of the memory it was using, and show the [[memory address]] and [[data code]] on 7-segment displays whenever the card was manually locked or automatically triggered.

The [[Connection Machine]], a 65,536-processor parallel computer designed in the mid-1980s, was a black cube with one side covered with a grid of red blinkenlights; the sales demo had them evolving [[Conway's Game of Life]] patterns.&lt;ref name=jar/&gt;

The [[Central processing unit|CPU]] load monitors on the front of [[BeBox]]es were also called “blinkenlights”.{{cn|date=January 2015}}

Several computer components, such as the Ballistix Tactical Tracer memory modules&lt;ref name=Ballistix&gt;{{cite web|title=Crucial Ballistix Tactical Tracer|url=http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/memory-ballistix-tactical-tracer|website=www.crucial.com|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Crucial Technology]] and the [[NVidia]] Titan GTX,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geforce.com/whats-new/guides/geforce-experience-nvidia-geforce-gtx-led-visualizer-user-guide#1 |title=GeForce Experience GeForce GTX LED Visualizer User Guide|website=www.geforce.com|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; have user-controllable lights that can be configured to show useful information, such as the memory capacity used and the temperature of the components.

This word gave its name to several projects, including [[screen saver]]s, hardware gadgets, and other nostalgic things. Some notable enterprises include [[Project Blinkenlights]] and the [[Blinkenlights Archaeological Institute]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30560">[[Image:IV-V-I in C.png|thumb|248px|IV-V-I progression in the key of C major. The chords shown are F major, G major and C major.{{audio|IV-V-I in C.mid|Play}}]]
A '''chord progression''' or '''harmonic progression''' is a succession of musical [[chord (music)|chord]]s, which are two or more notes, typically sounded simultaneously. Chord progressions are the foundation of [[harmony]] in Western musical tradition from the [[Common practice period|common practice era]] of [[Classical music]] to the 21st century. Chord progressions are the foundation of Western [[popular music]] styles (e.g., [[pop music]], [[rock music]]) and [[traditional music]] (e.g., [[blues]] and [[jazz]]). In these genres, chord progressions are the defining feature on which melody and rhythm are built.

In tonal music, chord progressions have the function of establishing or contradicting a [[tonality]], the technical name for what is commonly understood as the "key" of a song or piece. Chord progressions are usually expressed by [[Roman numeral analysis|Roman numerals]] in Classical music theory; for example, the common chord progression I vi/ii V7. In many styles of popular and traditional music, chord progressions are expressed using the name and "quality" of the chords. For example, the previously mentioned chord progression, in the key of C Major, would be written as C Major A minor/D minor G7 in a [[fake book]] or [[lead sheet]]. In the first chord, C Major, the "C" indicates that the chord is built on the root note "C"; the word "Major" indicates that a major chord is built on this "C" note. 

In rock and blues, musicians also often refer to chord progressions using [[Roman numerals]], as this facilitates transposing a song to a new key. For example, rock and blues musicians often think of the [[12 bar blues]] as consisting of I, IV and V chords. Thus a simple version of the 12-bar blues might be expressed as I/I/I/I  IV/IV/I/I/V/IV/I/I. By thinking of this blues progression in Roman numerals, a [[backup band]] or [[rhythm section]] could be instructed by a [[bandleader]] to do the chord progression in any key. For example, if the bandleader asked the band to play this chord progression in the key of C Major, the chords would be C/C/C/C F/F/C/C G/F/C/C. If the bandleader wanted to play the song in the key of G Major, the chords would be G/G/G/G C/C/G/G D/C/G/G, and so on.

The complexity of a chord progression varies from genre to genre and over different historical periods. Some pop and rock songs from the 1980s to the 2010s have fairly simple chord progressions. [[Funk]] emphasizes the groove and rhythm as the key element, so entire funk songs may be based on one chord. Some jazz-funk songs are based on a two-, three- or four-chord vamp. Some [[punk rock|punk]] and [[hardcore punk]] songs use only a few chords. On the other hand, [[bebop]] jazz songs may have [[32 bar song form]]s with one or two chord changes every bar.

==Basics==
[[File:Chord progression.png|thumb|338px|The key note or [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] of a piece of music is called note number one, the first step of the ascending scale. Chords built on each [[scale degree]] are numbered in the same way so that, for example, in the key of C, the progression E minor - F - G can be generally described as a three - four - five progression.]]

A chord may be built upon any note of a [[musical scale]], therefore a seven-note scale allows seven basic chords (for that scale's key), each degree of the scale becoming the root of its own chord.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Whitefield Chadwick]], ''Harmony: A Course of Study'', 72nd Ed. B.F.Wood Music Co., 1922, Introduction p. xv&lt;/ref&gt; A chord built upon the note '''E''' is an '''E''' chord of some type (major/minor/diminished, etc.) The harmonic ''function'' of any particular chord depends on the context of the particular chord progression in which it is found.&lt;ref name="Schoenberg"&gt;Arnold Schoenberg, ''Structural Functions of Harmony'', Norton &amp; Co, 1954, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; (''See'' [[Diatonic function]])

The diatonic (scale-based, not including notes other than the seven notes of the given scale) harmonization of any [[major scale]] results in three major [[triad (music)|triads]]. They are based on the first, [[Perfect fourth|fourth]], and [[Perfect fifth|fifth]] [[scale degree]]s (the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]], called the I chord in Roman numeral analysis; the [[subdominant]], the ii or IV chord in Roman numeral analysis; and [[dominant (music)|dominant]], the V or V7 chord&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, 1922, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; ''see [[three-chord song]]''). These three triads include, and therefore can [[harmonization|harmonize]], every note of that scale. Many simple [[traditional music]], [[folk music]] and [[rock and roll]] songs use only these three chord types (e.g., [[Wild Thing (The Troggs song)|Wild Thing]], which uses I, IV and V chords).

The same scale also provides three [[Relative key|relative minor]] chords, one related to each of the three major chords. These are based upon the sixth, second and third degrees of the major scale and stand in the same relationship to one another (in the relative minor key) as do the three majors, so that they may be viewed as the first (i), fourth (iv) and fifth (v) degrees of the relative minor key. For example, if we are in the key of C Major, its relative minor key is the key of A minor. In the key of A minor, the i, iv and v chords would be A minor, D minor and E minor. In practice, the dominant chord's third is often sharpened (raised) by one semitone to give a major chord; as well, this V chord may have a [[dominant seventh]] added, making it a V7 chord. The chords in this alteration would be A minor, d minor and E major (or E7).

Separate from these six [[common chord (music)|common chords]] there is one degree of the scale, the seventh, that results in a [[Diminished triad|diminished chord]].&lt;ref&gt;C.H. Kitson, ''Elementary Harmony, Part One'', O.U.P., 1920, Chapters 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in the key of C Major, the seventh note of the scale, B, would be the root note of a diminished triad (the notes B, D and F).

In addition, extra [[chromaticism|chromatic]] notes may be added to any chord. Chromatic notes are notes that are not in the key. Returning to our example of a song in C Major, this is a key with no sharps or flats. The key of C Major is the "white notes" on a piano. Any of the chords in the key of C Major can have one or more notes in their triad sharpened or flattened, which would require the use, in C Major, of the "black keys". Perhaps the most basic chromatic alteration in simple folk songs is the use of the sharpened fourth scale degree. In a song in C Major, the diatonic fourth scale degree is F. Sharpening this fourth degree by one semitone gives F#. Thus with the F#, the ii chord (normally the notes D, F and A) becomes the notes D, F#, A (a D Major chord; the technical term for this chord is a [[secondary dominant]]) these notes are also selected from the original scale the harmony remains [[diatonic]]. If new [[chromatic]] intervals are introduced then a change of scale or [[Modulation (music)|modulation]] occurs, which may bring the sense of a change of tonal center (commonly called moving to a new key). This in turn may lead to a [[Resolution (music)|resolution]] back to the original key, so that the entire sequence of chords helps create an extended [[musical form]] and a sense of movement and interest for the listener.

Although all this allows for a large number of possible progressions (depending upon the length of the progression), in practice, progressions are often limited to a few bars' length and certain progressions are favored above others: there is a certain amount of fashion in this and a chord progression (e.g., the 12 bar blues progression) may even define an entire genre.{{fact | date=June 2017}}

In western [[Classical music|classical]] notation, chords built on the scale are numbered with [[Roman numeral analysis|Roman numerals]]. A '''D''' chord will be figured '''I''' in the key of '''D''', for example, but '''V''' in the key of '''G'''. Minor chords are signified by lower case Roman, so that '''D minor''' in the key of '''C''' would be written '''ii'''. Other forms of [[chord notation]] have been devised, from [[figured bass]] to the [[chord chart]]. These usually allow or even require a certain amount of [[Improvisation (music)|improvisation]].

==Simple progressions==
[[Diatonic]] scales such as the [[major and minor]] scales lend themselves particularly well to the construction of common chords because they contain a large number of [[perfect fifth]]s. Such scales predominate in those regions where harmony is an essential part of music, as, for example, in the [[common practice period]] of western classical music. In considering [[Arabic music|Arab]] and [[Music of India|Indian]] music, where diatonic scales are used, there are also available a number of non-diatonic scales, the music has no chord changes, remaining always upon the key-chord, an attribute which has also been observed in [[hard rock]], [[hip hop]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=10.1525/mp.2002.19.3.285|title=Black Atlantic Rhythm: Its Computational and Transcultural Foundations|author=Jeff Pressing|journal=Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal|volume=19|date=2002|pages=285–310|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|doi=10.1525/mp.2002.19.3.285}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[funk]], [[disco]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yosemiteuhsd.com/finearts/rock/15_funk_disco.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719204120/http://www.yosemiteuhsd.com/finearts/rock/15_funk_disco.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[jazz]], etc.

Alternation between two chords may be thought of as the most basic chord progression.  Many well-known pieces are built harmonically upon the mere repetition of two chords of the same scale.&lt;ref name="Schoenberg"/&gt;  For example, many of the more straightforward melodies in classical music consist entirely or mostly of alternation between the tonic ('''I''') and the dominant ('''V''', sometimes with an [[Dominant seventh chord|added seventh]]), as do folk songs such as "[[Polly Wolly Doodle]]"{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} and popular songs such as "[[Achy Breaky Heart]]".{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} [[The Isley Brothers]]' "[[Shout (Isley Brothers song)|Shout]]" uses '''I - vi''' throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdVPE.asp?ppn=MN0063604 |title=The Isley Brothers "Shout" Sheet Music in F Major (transposable) - Download &amp; Print - SKU: MN0063604 |website=Musicnotes.com |date=2010-08-23 |accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three-chord progressions==
[[Image:Beethoven AlmanachDerMusikgesellschaft 1834.jpg|thumb|[[Beethoven]] imagined in the process of composing his [[Pastoral Symphony|''Pastoral'' Symphony]]]]
Three-chord tunes, though, are more common, since a melody may then dwell on any note of the scale. They are often presented as successions of four chords, in order to produce a binary harmonic rhythm, but two of the four chords are then the same. Often the chords may be selected to [[Harmonization|fit a pre-conceived melody]], but just as often it is the progression itself that gives rise to the melody.

They may be varied by the addition of sevenths (or other scale degrees) to any chord or by substitution of the relative minor of the '''IV''' chord to give, for example, '''I - ii - V'''.  This sequence, using the chord based on the second [[scale degree]], is also used [[cadence (music)|cadentially]] in a common chord progression of [[jazz harmony]], the so-called [[ii-V-I turnaround]], on which are based the more ornate [[Coltrane changes]].

Such progressions provide the entire harmonic foundation of much African and American popular music, and they occur sectionally in many pieces of classical music (such as the opening bars of [[Beethoven]]'s [[Pastoral Symphony|''Pastoral'' Symphony]]{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}). Any of these progressions may be [[Transposition (music)|transposed]] into any key so that, for instance, the progression '''I - IV - V''' in the key of '''A''' will be played '''A - D - E''', while in the key of '''C''' the chords will be '''C - F - G'''.

Where such a simple sequence does not represent the entire harmonic structure of a piece, it may readily be extended for greater variety.  Frequently an opening phrase of the type '''I - IV - V - V''', which ends on an [[Resolution (music)|unresolved]] [[Dominant (music)|dominant]], may be "answered" by a similar version that resolves back onto the home chord, giving a structure of double the length:
:'''I - IV - V - V'''
:'''I - IV - V - I'''

Additionally, such a passage may be alternated with a different progression to give a simple [[Binary form|binary]] or [[ternary form]] such as that of the popular [[thirty-two-bar form]] (see [[musical form]]).

==Blues changes==
[[Image:Serenade Blues 1.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Blues progressions influenced a great deal of 20th century American popular music]]
The [[twelve bar blues]] and its many variants use an elongated, three-line form of the '''I - IV - V''' progression that has also generated countless hit records, including the most significant output of [[rock and roll]]ers such as [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Little Richard]]. In its most elementary form (there are many variants) the chords progress as follows:
:'''I''' - '''I''' -  '''I''' -  '''I'''
:'''IV''' - '''IV''' - '''I''' - '''I'''
:'''V''' - '''IV''' - '''I''' - '''I'''

[[Image:ii-V-I turnaround in C.png|thumb|left|248px|[[ii-V-I turnaround]] in C. The chords shown are D minor, G7 and C major. {{audio|ii-V-I turnaround in C.mid|Play}}]]
Again, blues progressions have formed the entire harmonic basis of many recorded songs but may also be confined to a single section of a more elaborate form, as frequently with The Beatles in such songs as "[[You Can't Do That]]", "[[I Feel Fine]]", and "[[She's A Woman]]".{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}  They have also been subjected to densely chromatic elaboration, as in the [[Bird blues]].

Steedman (1984) proposed that a set of recursive [[rewrite rule]]s generate all [[well-formed scale|well-formed]] [[Transformation (music)|transformation]]s of jazz, both basic blues chord changes and slightly modified sequences (such as the "[[rhythm changes]]"). Important transformations include:
* replacement of (or addition to) a chord with its dominant, subdominant or the [[tritone substitution]].
* use of chromatic passing chords.
* extensively applying the [[ii-V-I turnaround]].
* chord alterations such as minor chords, diminished sevenths, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Steedman M.J., "A Generative Grammar for Jazz Chord Sequences", ''Music Perception'' '''2''' (1) (1984) 52-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1950s progression==
{{Main article|50s progression}}
[[Image:Mills Brothers.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[The Mills Brothers]]' recording of "[[Till Then (1944 song)|Till Then]]" looked forward both to the end of World War II and to the popular music of the 1950s. ''(Courtesy of the Fraser MacPherson estate c/o Guy MacPherson)'']]
Another common way of extending the '''I - IV - V''' sequence is by adding the chord of the sixth scale degree, giving the sequence '''I - vi - IV - V''' or '''[[I−vi−ii−V|I - vi - ii - V]]''', sometimes called the [[50s progression]] or doo-wop progression.

[[Image:50s progression in C.png|thumb|248px|50s progression in C, ending with C {{audio|50s progression in C.mid|Play}}]]
In fact this sequence had been in use from the earliest days of classical music (used often by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}), but after generating popular hits such as [[Rodgers and Hart]]'s "[[Blue Moon (song)|Blue Moon]]" (1934),{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} [[Jerome Kern]] and [[Dorothy Fields]]' 1936 "[[The Way You Look Tonight]]",{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} and [[Hoagy Carmichael]]'s "[[Heart and Soul (1938 song)|Heart and Soul]]" (1938),&lt;ref&gt;"[https://archive.is/20130111064707/http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdFPE.asp?ppn=MN0096746&amp; Heart and Soul (1938)] ", ''MusicNotes.com''. Chords marked. {{subscription required|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it became associated with the black American vocal groups of the 1940s, [[The Ink Spots]] and [[The Mills Brothers]] ("[[Till Then (1944 song)|Till Then]]"),{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} and thus later became the entire basis of the 1950s [[doo-wop]] genre, a typical example being [[The Monotones]]' "[[The Book of Love (song)|The Book of Love]]".{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Taken up into the pop mainstream, for example with [[Felice and Boudleaux Bryant]]'s "[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]]",{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} a hit for [[The Everly Brothers]], in the 1960s it continued to generate records as otherwise disparate as [[The Paris Sisters]]' "I Love How You Love Me" (written by [[Barry Mann|Mann]] and Kolber) and [[Boris Pickett]]'s "[[Monster Mash]]". {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

It continued to be used sectionally, as in the last part of The Beatles' "[[Happiness is a warm gun|Happiness Is a Warm Gun]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/happiness-is-a-warm-gun/ |title=Happiness Is A Warm Gun |publisher=The Beatles Bible |date= |accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also to form the harmonic basis of further new songs for decades ("[[Every Breath You Take]]" by [[The Police (band)|The Police]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s "[[True Blue (Madonna song)|True Blue]]").{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

&lt;/score&gt;|width=340|caption=A [[circle progression]] in C major}}Introducing the '''ii''' chord into these progressions emphasises their appeal as constituting elementary forms of [[circle progression]].  These, named for the [[circle of fifths]], consist of "adjacent roots in ascending fourth or descending fifth relationship"&amp;mdash;for instance, the sequence '''vi - ii - V - I''' ascends with each successive chord to one a fourth above the previous. Such a motion, based upon close harmonic relations, offers "undoubtedly the most common and the strongest of all harmonic progressions".&lt;ref name="B&amp;S"&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice'', Vol. I, p.178. Seventh Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The succession of cadences gives an impression of inevitable return to the key-note of the piece.

''Jazz Chord Progressions'', p.56. {{ISBN|0-7935-7038-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The III7-VI7-II7-V7 (or V7/V/V/V - V7/V/V - V7/V - V7) leads back to C major (I) but is itself indefinite in key.]]
Short cyclical progressions may be derived by selecting a sequence of chords from the series completing a circle from the tonic through all seven diatonic chords:&lt;ref name="B&amp;S"/&gt;
* '''I - IV - vii&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; - iii - vi - ii - V - I''' (in C major) {{audio|Progression majeure en cercle.ogg|Circle progression in C major}}
*'''I - V - I'''     {{audio|Progression en cercle I-V-I.ogg|Circle progression excerpt: I - V - I}}
* '''I - IV - V - I'''  {{audio|Progression en cercle I IV V I.ogg|Circle progression excerpt: I - IV -V - I}}

This type of progression was much used by classical composers, who introduced increasingly subtle inflections.  Particularly, substitution of major for minor chords giving, for example, '''I - VI - II - V''' allowed a more sophisticated [[chromaticism]] as well as the possibility of [[modulation (music)|modulation]].  These harmonic conventions were taken up by American popular entertainers, giving rise to many variations on those harmonic staples of early [[jazz]] that have been dubbed the [[ragtime progression]] and the [[stomp progression]].  All such progressions may be found used sectionally, as for example in the much-used "[[rhythm changes]]" of [[George Gershwin]]'s "[[I Got Rhythm]]".

==Harmonizing the scale==
As well as the cyclical underpinning of chords, the ear tends to respond well to a linear thread; chords following the scale upwards or downwards.  These are often referred to as step progressions because they follow the steps of the scale, making the scale itself a bassline. In the 17th century, descending bass lines found favour for [[Division (music)|"division]]s on the ground", so that [[Pachelbel's canon]], the [[Bach orchestral suites]] (the famous ''[[Air on a G String]]''{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}), and [[Handel]]'s organ concerti all contain very similar harmonizations of the descending major scale.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}  When this was reintroduced into mid-20th century pop music, it brought with it many baroque trappings (The Beatles' "[[For No One]]",{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} [[Procol Harum]]'s "[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]",{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} and [[The Steve Miller Band]]'s "Dear Mary" and "Baby's House"{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}).

At its simplest, this descending sequence may simply introduce an extra chord, either '''III''' or '''V''', into the '''I - VI - IV - V''' type of sequence described above.  This chord allows the harmonization of the seventh step, and so of the bass line '''I - VII - VI....'''  This strategy underlies [[Percy Sledge]]'s "[[When a Man Loves a Woman (song)|When A Man Loves A Woman]]"{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} and Bob Marley's "[[No Woman, No Cry]]".{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}  The baroque examples descend for an octave, while "[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]" manages a stately two octaves, before "turning around" through the dominant chord to recommence upon the key note.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Ascending major progressions are not as common but many exist: the verse of "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]" ascends by steps to the fifth, '''I-ii-iii-IV-V''' (or I-ii-I/iii-IV-V) before descending again to the key-note, '''IV - iii - ii - I''' (or IV-I/iii-ii-I)&amp;mdash;the latter being another common type of harmonization of a descending major scale.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}  [[The Four Pennies]]' hit "[[Juliet (The Four Pennies song)|Juliet]]"{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} and The Beatles' "[[Here, There and Everywhere]]" both use similar ascending progressions.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The descending '''chromatic''' scale has also formed the basis of many progressions, from the ''{{lang|la|[[Mass in B minor structure#Crucifixus|Crucifixus]]}}'' of Bach's [[Mass in B minor]],{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} through Beethoven's ''[[Variations, WoO. 80|Thirty-two Piano Variations]]'',{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} to songs such as Bob Dylan's "[[Simple Twist of Fate]]",{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} [[George Harrison]]'s "[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]",{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} and [[Lucio Battisti]]'s "Paradiso",{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} a hit for [[Amen Corner (band)|Amen Corner]] when translated as "[[(If Paradise Is) Half as Nice]]".{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The finale measures of the first movement of Ravel's Piano Concerto in G feature the harmonization of a descending hybrid scale (phrygo-major). In this special case, Ravel used a parallel series of major triads to brilliant effect.:(G F{{music|sharp}} E D C B{{music|flat}} A{{music|flat}} G)

==Minor and modal progressions==
[[Image:Andalusian.png|thumb|right|348px|A typical Andalusian cadence ''por arriba'' (i.e. in A minor). G is the subtonic and G{{music|sharp}} is the leading tone. {{Audio|Figure_andalusian.ogg|(Listen)}}]]
Similar strategies to all the above work equally well in minor modes: there have been one-, two- and three-minor-chord songs, minor blues.
A notable example of a descending minor chord progression is the four-chord [[Andalusian cadence]],
'''i''' - '''VII''' - '''VI''' - '''V'''.

Folk and blues tunes frequently use the [[Mixolydian]] scale, which has a flat seventh degree, altering the position of the three major chords to '''I'''-'''{{music|b}}VII'''-'''IV'''. For example, if the major scale of '''C''', which gives the three chords '''C, F''' and '''G''' on the first, fourth and fifth degrees, is played with '''G''' as the tonic, then the same chords will now appear on the first, fourth and seventh degrees. These "Mixolydian" harmonies also appeared in the pop music of the 1960s, notably with The Beatles' album ''[[Help!]]''{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} and The Rolling Stones' ''[[Beggar's Banquet]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The minor-third step from a minor keynote up to the relative major encouraged ascending scale progressions, particularly based on an ascending [[pentatonic scale]]. Typical of the type is the sequence '''i''' - '''III''' -'''IV (or iv)''' - '''VI'''.

According to Tom Sutcliffe:&lt;ref name="sutcliffe"&gt;{{cite web | last = Sutcliffe | first = Tom | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Appendix A (Pt. 4): Pop and Rock Music Modal Blues Progressions | work = Syntactic Structures in Music | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.harmony.org.uk/book/pop_and_rock_music_blues_modal_progressions.htm | doi = | accessdate = 2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |... during 1960s some pop groups started to experiment with modal chord progressions as an alternative way of harmonizing blues melodies... This created a new system of harmony that has influenced subsequent popular music.}}

This came about partly from the similarity of the [[blues scale]] to [[Musical mode|modal scales]] and partly from the characteristics of the guitar and the use of parallel major chords on the pentatonic minor scale. With barre chords on guitar, the same chord shape can be moved up and down the neck without changing the fingering. This phenomenon is also linked to the rise in the use of [[power chords]] in [[heavy metal music]]. Power chords contain just a fifth, or a fifth with the root doubled. Without a third, power chords enable more flexibility in the chord progression.

==Chord progressions in classical music==
{{see also|Root (chord)#Root progressions in music}}

Early European art music developed through [[organum|embellishment of a single line of melody]] and classical theory still emphasises the correct "horizontal" progress of single-note parts, sometimes known as [[voice leading]]. Generally, to the melody in the upper part is added first a [[bass line]] and then two inner lines to complete the chords in [[four-part harmony]] suitable for a choir or string section, terminating with cadences, avoiding some [[chord inversion]]s and favouring others, maintaining an orderly and melodic conjunct, contrary and oblique motion of each part relative to the others in order to achieve unity of texture by avoidance of inappropriate intervals, parallel fifths and octaves etc. Much practice is given to the art of harmonic transition and development that is essential to classical music's use of harmony as a means of achieving unity in a large-scale form. While (as noted above) classical music has its cliche progressions, they are seldom named and discussed:{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} perhaps only [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] among the authors of popular text-books of harmony has made some attempt to do so.

'''Chumashan''' (meaning "[[Santa Cruz Island]]er") is a family of languages that were spoken on the [[Southern California|southern]] [[California]] [[West Coast of the United States|coast]] by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Chumash people]], from the  [[Coastal plain]]s and valleys of [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]] to [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], neighboring inland and  [[Transverse Ranges]] valleys and canyons east to bordering the [[San Joaquin Valley]], to three adjacent [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]]: [[San Miguel Island|San Miguel]], [[Santa Rosa Island, California|Santa Rosa]], and [[Santa Cruz Island|Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chumashan languages may be, along with [[Yukian languages|Yukian]] and perhaps languages of southern Baja such as [[Waikuri language|Waikuri]], one of the oldest language families established in California, before the arrival of speakers of [[Penutian]], [[Uto-Aztecan]], and perhaps even [[Hokan languages|Hokan]] languages. Chumashan, Yukian, and southern Baja languages are spoken in areas with long-established populations of a distinct physical type. The population in the core Chumashan area has been stable for the past 10,000 years. However, the attested range of Chumashan is recent (within a couple thousand years).  There is internal evidence that Obispeño replaced a [[Hokan languages|Hokan language]] and that Island Chumash mixed with a language very different from Chumashan; the islands were not in contact with the mainland until the introduction of plank canoes in the first millennium AD.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Golla, Victor. (2011). ''California Indian Languages''. Berkeley: University of California Press. {{ISBN|978-0-5202-6667-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the Chumashan languages are now [[Extinct language|extinct]], although they are well documented in the unpublished fieldnotes of linguist [[John Peabody Harrington]]. Especially well documented are [[Barbareño language|Barbareño]], [[Ineseño language|Ineseño]], and [[Ventureño language|Ventureño]]. The last native speaker of a Chumashan language was Barbareño speaker [[Mary Yee]], who died in 1965.

==Family division==

===Languages===

Six Chumashan languages are [[attested language|attested]], all now extinct.  However, most of them are in the process of revitalization, with language programs and classes.  Contemporary Chumash people now prefer to refer to their languages by native names rather than the older names based on the local missions.

I. Northern Chumash
: 1. '''[[Obispeño language|Obispeño]]''' (also known as Northern Chumash) ''(†)''
: Also known as Tilhini by students of the language, after the name of the major village near which the mission was founded.
II. Southern Chumash
: a. Island Chumash (mixed with non-Chumash)
:: 2. '''[[Island Chumash language|Island Chumash]]''' (also known as Ysleño, Isleño, Cruzeño) ''(†)'' Was spoken on the three inhabited islands in the Santa Barbara [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]]: [[Santa Rosa Island, California|Santa Rosa]], [[San Miguel Island|San Miguel]], and [[Santa Cruz Island|Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
: b. Central Chumash
:: 3. '''[[Purisimeño language|Purisimeño]]''' ''(†)''
:: 4. '''[[Ineseño language|Ineseño]]''' (also spelled Inezeño) ''(†)''
:: Now called Samala or Sʰamala by the Santa Ynez Band.  This word has an S with a puff of air after it, not a "sh" sound.  It is the name for the language and the people.
:: 5. '''[[Barbareño language|Barbareño]]''' ''(†)''
:: Now called Shmuwich or Šmuwič by students of the language and community members.  This is the name for the language and the people; it means "coastal." 
:: 6. '''[[Ventureño language|Ventureño]]''' ''(†)''
:: Now called Mitsqanaqa'n by students of the language and community members, after the name of a major village near which the mission was founded.

{{anchor|Cuyama}}Obispeño was the most divergent Chumashan language. The Central Chumash languages include Purisimeño, Ineseño, Barbareño and Ventureño.  There was a dialect continuum across this area, but the form of the language spoken in the vicinity of each mission was distinct enough to qualify as a different language.

There is very little documentation of Purisimeño. Ineseño, Barbareño and Ventureño each had several dialects, although documentation usually focused on just one.  Island Chumash had different dialects on [[Santa Cruz Island]] and [[Santa Rosa Island, California|Santa Rosa Island]], but all speakers were relocated to the mainland in the early 19th century. [[John Peabody Harrington]] conducted fieldwork on all the above Chumashan languages, but obtained the least data on Island Chumash, Purisimeño, and Obispeño.  There is no linguistic data on Cuyama, though ethnographic data suggests that it was likely Chumash (Interior Chumash).

[[File:Chumashan Language Map.svg|250px|framed|right|There are six or seven Chumashan languages, depending in part on how one interprets the status of the poorly attested Interior Chumash (Cuyama) as a distinct language.]]

====Post-contact====
The languages are named after the local [[Franciscan]] [[Spanish missions in California]] where Chumashan speakers were relocated and aggregated between the 1770s and 1830s:
*[[Obispeño]]—[[Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa]]
*[[Purisimeño]]—[[Mission La Purísima Concepción]]
*[[Ineseño]]—[[Mission Santa Inés]]
*[[Barbareño]]—[[Mission Santa Barbara]]
*[[Ventureño]]—[[Mission San Buenaventura]]

====Genetic relations====

[[Roland Dixon]] and [[Alfred L. Kroeber]] suggested that the Chumashan languages might be related to the neighboring [[Salinan]] in a ''Iskoman'' grouping.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon and Kroeber 1913&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Sapir]] accepted this speculation and included Iskoman in his classification of [[Hokan languages|Hokan]].&lt;ref&gt;Sapir 1917&lt;/ref&gt; More recently it has been noted that Salinan and Chumashan shared only one word, which the Chumashan languages probably borrowed from Salinan (the word meant 'white clam shell' and was used as currency).&lt;ref&gt;Klar 1977&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the inclusion of Chumashan into Hokan is now disfavored by most specialists, and the consensus is that Chumashan has no identified linguistic relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Mithun 1999:390&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

The Chumashan languages are well known for their [[consonant harmony]] (regressive sibilant harmony). Mithun presents a scholarly synopsis of Chumashan linguistic structures.&lt;ref&gt;Mithun 1999:390-392&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vowels ===

The Central Chumash languages all have a symmetrical six-vowel system.  The distinctive high central vowel is written various ways, including {{IPA|/ɨ/}} "barred I," {{IPA|/ə/}} "schwa" and {{IPA|/ï/}} "I umlaut."  Contemporary students/users of the languages favor {{IPA|/ɨ/}} or {{IPA|/ə/}}.

:: '''ʼosos''' "heel" — I/B/V
:: '''ʼasas''' "chin" — I/B/V
* ''' Low-vowel harmony as a process: ''' Many prefixes include a low vowel which shows up as /'''a'''/ when the vowel of the following syllable is high.  When the vowel of the following syllable is low, the vowel of the prefix assimilates to (or "harmonizes" with) the front-central-back quality of the following vowel.  The verb prefix '''kal-''' "of cutting" illustrates this process in the following Barbareño examples, where the /'''l'''/ may drop out:
:: '''kamasix''' "to cut into three pieces" — '''kal-''' + '''masix''' "three"
:: '''keseqen''' "to cut out" — '''kal-''' + '''seqen''' "to remove"
:: '''qoloq''' " to make or bore a hole, cut a hole in — '''kal-''' + '''loq''' "to be perforated"
:: '''katun''' "to cut into two pieces" — '''kal-''' + '''=tun''' "of two, being two"

=== Consonants ===

The Central Chumash languages have a complex inventory of consonants.  All of the consonants except /'''h'''/ can be glottalized; all of the consonants except /'''h'''/, /'''x'''/ and the liquids can be aspirated.

A '''damaging quotation''' is a ''short utterance'' by a public figure used by opponents as a [[discrediting tactic]]. These utterances are often, but not always, taken out of context (a tactic sometimes referred to as [[contextomy]]) or otherwise changed to distort their original [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. These quotations may be inserted or alluded to in [[negative political ad]]s to discredit the character or intellectual ability of the originator. More typically, however, they are used in political [[logical argument|arguments]] by both politicians and political [[Pundit (politics)|pundit]]s often in ways which are [[fallacy|fallacious]]. These quotations are compiled into books or posted on the internet and are repeated in other contexts such as in [[talk radio]] or in the [[United States]] by stand-up comedians in late-night television monologues. The publication of these quotations is justified as a necessary part of maintaining an informed citizenry. In cases where the quotation in question is taken widely out of context it can be difficult for a candidate to find recourse, even though it is very easy to check the accuracy and the context of a quotation by using internet resources (such as [[Web search engine|search engine]]s); in popular jargon, the quotation (especially if humorous) can grow into a [[Internet meme|meme]].

== Categories ==
There are various common categories of quotations: [[malapropism]]s or grammatical errors, exaggerations about past achievements, lack of conviction, consorting with the enemy, [[moral turpitude]], indifference towards victims of crime, racist or discrimanatory, etc. 

In the case of [[malapropism]]s, it is a rhetorical fallacy (called [[ad hominem|argument ad hominem]]) to conclude that the entire argument of whoever made the utterance is incorrect. Yet it has become common in partisan [[argument]] in the [[United States]]. For instance: former [[Vice President of the United States|U.S. Vice President]] [[Al Gore]], during an interview with [[Wolf Blitzer]] on CNN (March 9, 1999) stated, "During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet. I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country's economic growth and environmental protection, improvements in our educational system." This has frequently been distorted by opponents to say that Gore claimed, "I invented the Internet." Partisans have so often used this distorted quotation to discredit him that Internet pioneer [[Vint Cerf]] (and others who participated in ''actually'' inventing the Internet) have made a point of noting Gore's support and the error of the discreditors. See [http://www.sethf.com/gore/].

With the availability of inexpensive [[computers]] and the widespread use of the [[Internet]], it has become easy for anyone to accumulate and distribute these quotation lists. Like the "[[Yogiisms]]" of baseball great [[Yogi Berra]], or the [[Colemanballs]] collected by ''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]'', a damaging quotation purports to give insight into the thinking of the speaker, frequently a politician or of the politicians or political groups that used it as means of attack. As such they belong to the colorful history of political [[satire]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4132">A '''dramatic soprano''' is a type of [[opera]]tic [[soprano]] with a powerful, rich, emotive voice that can sing over, or cut through, a full orchestra. Thicker [[vocal folds]] in dramatic voices usually (but not always) mean less agility than lighter voices but a sustained, fuller sound. Usually this voice has a lower [[tessitura]] than other sopranos, and a darker [[timbre]]. They are often used for [[hero]]ic, often long-[[suffering]], [[tragic]] women of opera. Dramatic sopranos have a [[vocal range|range]] from approximately low A ([[Scientific pitch notation|A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]) to "high C" (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Coffin"&gt;Coffin (1960) {{page number needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some dramatic sopranos, known as '''Wagnerian sopranos''', have an exceptionally big voice that can assert itself over a large orchestra (of more than 80 or even 100 pieces). These voices are substantial, often denser in tone, extremely powerful and, ideally, evenly balanced throughout the [[vocal register]]s. [[List of works for the stage by Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] sopranos usually play mythic heroines. Successful Wagnerian sopranos are rare and often Wagnerian roles are performed by Italianate dramatic sopranos.&lt;ref name="Coffin" /&gt;

{{Slavery}}

A '''galley slave''' is a [[slave]] rowing in a [[galley]], either a [[Convict|convicted criminal]] sentenced to work at the oar (''[[French language|French]]'': '''galérien'''), or a kind of human chattel, often a [[prisoner of war]], assigned to his duty of rowing.&lt;ref name="Lionel Casson, 1966, 35"&gt;{{harvnb|Casson|1966|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Antiquity ==
Ancient navies generally preferred to rely on free men&lt;!-- free men, not freedmen! --&gt; to man their galleys. Slaves were usually not put at the oars except in times of pressing manpower demands or extreme emergency,&lt;ref name="Jan M. Libourel 119"&gt;{{harvnb|Libourel|1973|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some of these cases they would earn their freedom by this. There is no evidence that ancient navies ever made use of condemned criminals as oarsmen,&lt;ref&gt;With the possible exception of a single instance in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] ({{cite book |last=Casson|first=Lionel |title=Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World |year=1971 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |location=Princeton |pages=325–326}}).&lt;/ref&gt; despite the popular image from novels such as ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben-Hur]]''.

=== Greek navies ===

In [[Classical Athens]], a leading naval power of [[Classical Greece]], rowing was regarded as an honorable profession of which men should possess some practical knowledge,&lt;ref name="Rachel L. Sargent 264f."&gt;{{harvnb|Sargent|1927|pp=264f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sailors were viewed as instrumental in safeguarding the state.&lt;ref name="Rachel L. Sargent 266"&gt;{{harvnb|Sargent|1927|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Aristotle]], the common people on the rowing benches won the [[Battle of Salamis]], thereby strengthening the [[Athenian democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], Polit. v. 4. 8 (1304a) "On the other hand, the victory of Salamis, which was gained by the common people who served in the fleet, and won for the Athenians the empire of the sea, strengthened the democracy."&lt;/ref&gt;

The special characteristics of the [[Trireme]], with each of its 170 oars being handled by a single oarsman, demanded the commitment of skilled freemen; rowing required coordination and training on which success in combat and the lives of all aboard depended.&lt;ref name="Lionel Casson, 1966, 36"&gt;{{harvnb|Casson|1966|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, practical difficulties such as the prevention of desertion or revolt when bivouacking (triremes used to be hauled on land at night) made free labour more secure and more economical than slaves.&lt;ref name="Rachel L. Sargent 273"&gt;{{harvnb|Sargent|1927|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 5th and 4th centuries BC, Athens generally followed a naval policy of enrolling citizens from the lower classes ([[Thetes]]), [[metics]] (foreigners resident in Athens) and hired foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sargent|1927|pp=266–268}}; {{harvnb|Ruschenbusch|1979|pp=106 &amp; 110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it has been argued that slaves formed part of the rowing crew in the [[Sicilian Expedition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Graham|1992|pp=258–262}}&lt;/ref&gt; a typical Athenian trireme crew during the [[Peloponnesian War]] consisted of 80 citizens, 60 [[metic]]s and 60 foreign hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruschenbusch|1979|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, when put under military pressure by the [[Sparta]]ns in the final stages of the conflict, Athens, in an all-out effort, mobilized all men of military age, including all slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], "Hellenica", 1.6.24&lt;/ref&gt; After the victorious [[Battle of Arginusae]] the freed slaves were even given Athenian citizenship,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|2001|pp=359–366}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a move interpreted as an attempt to keep them motivated rowing for Athens.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|2001|p=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; On two other occasions during the war, captured enemy galley slaves were given freedom by the victors.&lt;ref name="Rachel L. Sargent 266"/&gt;

In [[Sicily]], the tyrant [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysios]] (ca. 432–367 BC) once set all slaves of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] free to man his galleys, employing thus freedmen, but otherwise relied on citizens and foreigners as oarsmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sargent|1927|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slaves accompanying officers and [[hoplite]] marines as personal attendants into war are assumed by modern scholars to have also assisted in the rowing when need arose,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sargent|1927|pp=273f.}}; {{harvnb|Casson|1966|pp=36f.}}; {{harvnb|Graham|1992|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no definite proof on this point,&lt;ref name="Rachel L. Sargent 274"&gt;{{harvnb|Sargent|1927|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they should not be regarded as regular members of the crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Casson|1966|pp=36f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When travelling over the sea on personal matters, it was common that both master and slave pulled the oar.&lt;ref name="Rachel L. Sargent 274"/&gt;

=== Roman and Carthaginian navies ===

In Roman times, reliance on rowers of free status continued. Slaves were usually not put at the oars, except in times of pressing manpower demands or extreme emergency.&lt;ref name="Jan M. Libourel 119"/&gt; 

Thus, in the drawn-out [[Second Punic War]] with [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], both navies are known to have resorted to slave labour. In the aftermath of [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], a levy of slaves was equipped and trained by private Roman individuals for [[Titus Otacilius]]’ squadron in Sicily (214 BC).&lt;ref name="Jan M. Libourel 117f."&gt;{{harvnb|Libourel|1973|pp=117f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the capture of [[Cartagena, Spain|New Carthage]] five years later, local slaves were impressed by [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio]] in his fleet on the promise of freedom after the war to those who showed good will as rowers.&lt;ref name="Jan M. Libourel 117f."/&gt; At the end of the war, Carthage, alarmed over the impending invasion by Scipio, bought five thousand slaves to row its fleet (205 BC).&lt;ref name="Jan M. Libourel 117"&gt;{{harvnb|Libourel|1973|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the introduction of [[polyreme]]s at the time, particularly of the [[quinquereme]], facilitated the use of little-trained labour, as these warships only needed a skilled man for the position nearest the loom{{clarifyme|date=February 2016}}, while the remaining rowers at the oar followed his lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Casson|1966|p=38}}; {{harvnb|Libourel|1973|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, the Romans seemed to avoid the use of slave rowers in their subsequent wars with the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic east]]. Livy records that naval levies in the [[Roman-Syrian War|War against Antiochos]] consisted of freedmen and colonists (191 BC),&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] 36.2.15&lt;/ref&gt; while in the [[Third Macedonian War]] (171 BC–168 BC) Rome’s fleet was manned by freedmen with Roman citizenship and allies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] 42.27.3, 42.31.6–7 and 43.12.9&lt;/ref&gt; In the final showdown of the civil war between [[Octavian]] and [[Sextus Pompey]], the adversaries enlisted among others slaves, but set them free before putting them to the oars,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Casson|1966|pp=41f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that the prospect of freedom was judged instrumental in keeping the rowers motivated. In [[Roman Empire|Imperial times]], provincials who were free men became the mainstay of the Roman rowing force.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Casson|1966|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early modern era ==
===Europe===
[[File:Battle of Lepanto 1571.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A painting of the 1571 [[Battle of Lepanto]] in the [[Ionian Sea]], where both sides relied on tens of thousands of slaves, prisoners or convicts as oarsmen.]]

Only in the [[Late Middle Ages]] did slaves begin to be increasingly employed as rowers. It also became the custom among the Mediterranean powers to sentence condemned criminals to row in the war-galleys of the state (initially only in time of war). Traces of this practice appear in France as early as 1532, but the first legislative enactment comes in the ''Ordonnance d'Orléans'' of 1561. In 1564 [[Charles IX of France]] forbade the sentencing of prisoners to the galleys for fewer than ten years. A [[branding persons|brand]] of the letters ''GAL'' identified the condemned galley-slaves.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Naval forces from both Christian and Muslim countries often turned [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] into galley-slaves. Thus, at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571, 12,000 Christian galley slaves were freed from the Ottoman Turks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Patrick|2007|pp=718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Knights Hospitallers]] made use of [[Slaves' Prison|galley slaves]] and [[debtors' prison|debtors]] ({{lang-it|buonavoglie}}) to row their galleys during their rule over the [[Malta|Maltese Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Melita Historica|last=Grima|first=Joseph F.|date=2001|title=The Rowers on the Order's Galleys (c. 1600-1650) |url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.13(2000-03)/MH.13(2001)2/01.pdf|volume=13|issue=2|pages=113-126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1622, Saint [[Vincent de Paul]], as a former slave himself (in [[Tunis]]), became chaplain to the galleys, and ministered to the galley slaves.

In 1687 the governor of [[New France]], [[Jacques-René de Brisay de Denonville, Marquis de Denonville|Jacques-René de Brisay de Denonville]], seized, chained, and shipped 50 [[Iroquois]] chiefs from [[Fort Frontenac]] to [[Marseille]], France, to be used as galley slaves.

King [[Louis XIV of France]], who wanted a bigger fleet, ordered that the courts should sentence men to the galleys as often as possible, even in times of peace; he even sought to transform the [[death penalty]] to sentencing to the galleys for life (and unofficially did so - a letter exists to all French judges, that they should, if possible, sentence men to life in the galleys instead of death).{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

By the end of the reign of Louis XIV in 1715 the use of the galley for war purposes had practically ceased, but the [[French Navy]] did not incorporate the corps of the galleys until 1748. From the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], [[Toulon]] functioned as a naval military port, [[Marseille]] having become a merchant port, and served as the headquarters of the galleys and of the convict rowers (''galériens''). After the incorporation of the galleys, the system sent the majority of these latter to [[Toulon]], the others to [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] and to [[Brest, France|Brest]], where they worked in the [[arsenal]]. 

Convict rowers also went to a large number of other French and non-French cities: [[Nice]], [[Le Havre]], [[Nîmes]], [[Lorient]], [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], [[Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue]], [[La Spezia]], [[Antwerp]] and [[Civitavecchia]]; but Toulon, Brest and Rochefort predominated. At Toulon the convicts remained (in chains) on the galleys, which were moored as [[hulk (ship)|hulk]]s in the harbour. Their shore prisons had the name ''[[Bagnio|bagnes]]'' ("baths"), a name given to such penal establishments first by the Italians (''bagno''), and allegedly deriving from the prison at [[Constantinople]] situated close by or attached to the great baths there. 

All French convicts continued to use the name ''galérien'' even after galleys went out of use; only after the [[French Revolution]] did the new authorities officially change the hated name — with all it signified — to ''forçat'' ("forced"). The use of the term ''galérien'' nevertheless continued until 1873, when the last ''bagne'' in France (as opposed to the bagnes relocated to [[French Guiana]]), the bagne of Toulon, closed definitively. In Spain, the word ''galeote'' continued in  use as late as the early 19th century for a criminal condemned to [[penal servitude]]. In Italian the word ''galera'' is still in use for a prison.

A vivid account of the life of galley-slaves in France appears in [[Jean Marteilhes]]'s ''[[Memoirs of a Protestant]]'', translated by [[Oliver Goldsmith]], which describes the experiences of one of the [[Huguenot]]s who suffered after the [[revocation of the Edict of Nantes]] in 1685.

Madame de Sevigne, a revered French author, wrote from Paris on April 10, 1671 (Letter VII): "I went to walk at Vincennes, en Troche* and by the way met with a string of galley-slaves ; 
they were going to Marseilles, and will be there in about a 
month. Nothing could have been surer than this mode of 
conveyance, but another thought came into my head, which 
was to go with them myself. There was one Duval among 
them, who appeared to be a conversible man. You will see 
them when they come in, and I suppose you would have 
been agreeably surprised to have seen me in the midst of 
the crowd of women that accompany them." 

Galley-slaves lived in unsavoury conditions, so even though some sentences prescribed a restricted number of years, most rowers would eventually die, even if they survived the conditions, shipwreck and slaughter or torture at the hands of enemies or of pirates. Additionally, nobody ensured that prisoners were freed after completing their sentences. As a result, imprisonment for 10 years could in reality mean imprisonment for life because nobody except the prisoner would either notice or care.

===Africa===
The [[Barbary pirates]] of the 16th to 19th centuries used galley [[Slavery in Libya|slaves]], often captured Europeans from Italy or Spain. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan in Istanbul used galley slaves also.

===Asia===
In [[Southeast Asia]], from the mid-18th to the late-19th centuries, the ''[[lanong]]'' and ''[[garay (ship)|garay]]'' warships of the [[Iranun people|Iranun]] and [[Banguingui]] pirates were crewed entirely with male galley slaves captured from previous raids. Conditions were brutal and it was not uncommon for galley slaves to die on voyages from exhaustion. Slaves were kept bound to their stations and were fed poorly. Slaves who mistimed their strokes were [[Caning|caned]] by overseers. Most of the slaves were [[Tagalogs]], [[Visayans]], and "Malays" (including [[Bugis]], [[Mandarese people|Mandarese]], [[Iban people|Iban]], and [[Makassar people|Makassar]]). There were also occasional European and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] captives.&lt;ref name="warren2"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Francis Warren|title =Iranun and Balangingi: Globalization, Maritime Raiding and the Birth of Ethnicity|publisher =NUS Press|year =2002|pages=53&amp;ndash;56|isbn =9789971692421|url =https://nuspress.nus.edu.sg/products/iranun-and-balangingi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In fiction ==
A short account of his 10 years as a galley-slave is given by the character Farrabesche in "The Village Rector" by [[Honoré de Balzac]]. He is sentenced to the galleys as a result of his life as a "chauffeur" (in this case the word refers to a brigand who threatened landowners by roasting them).

In one of his ill-fated adventures, [[Miguel de Cervantes]]'s [[Don Quixote]] frees a row of prisoners sent to the galleys, including [[Ginés de Pasamonte]]. The prisoners, however, beat him. (Cervantes himself had been captured in 1575 and served as a galley slave in [[Algiers]] for five years before he was ransomed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Miguel de Cervantes#Military service and captivity]]&lt;/ref&gt;)

In [[The Sea Hawk]], a 1919 novel of historical fiction by [[Rafael Sabatini]], as well as the 1924 film based on the novel, the protagonist, Sir Oliver Tressilian, is sold into galley slavery by a relative. In the 1940 film of the same name (but with an entirely different plot), the protagonist, Sir Geoffery Thorpe, played by [[Errol Flynn]], is captured by Spanish military personnel and receives a life sentence as a galley slave. The sets in the 1940 film appear historically accurate.

[[Lew Wallace]]'s [[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Judah Ben-Hur]] is sent to the galleys as a murderer but manages to survive a shipwreck and save the fleet leader, who frees and [[adoption in ancient Rome|adopts]] him. Both films based on the novel depict the historically inaccurate Roman galley slaves.

In the 1943 novel [[The Long Ships]] the protagonist Orm Tostesson is captured while raiding in Andalusia and serves as a galley slave for a number of years. 

The 1947 French film ''[[Monsieur Vincent]]'' shows Saint [[Vincent de Paul]] taking the place of a weakened slave at his oar.

[[Steven Saylor]]'s [[Roma Sub Rosa]] novel ''[[Arms of Nemesis]]'' contains an appalling description of the conditions under which galley slaves lived and worked, assuming that they existed.

[[C. S. Forester]] wrote of an encounter with Spanish galleys in ''[[Mr. Midshipman Hornblower]]'' when the becalmed British fleet is attacked off Gibraltar by galleys. The author writes of the stench emanating from these galleys due to each carrying two hundred condemned prisoners chained permanently to the rowing benches.

[[Patrick O'Brian]] wrote of encounters with galleys in the Mediterranean in ''[[Master and Commander]]'' emphasising the galley's speed and manoeuvrability compared to sailing ships when there was little wind. 

In [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Les Miserables]]'', Jean Valjean was a galley prisoner, and was in danger of returning to the galleys.  Police inspector Javert's father was also a galley prisoner.

[[Robert E. Howard]] transplanted the institute of galley slavery to his mythical [[Hyborian Age]], depicting [[Conan the Barbarian]] as organizing a rebellion of galley slaves who kill the crew, take over the ship and make him their captain in one novel (Conan the Conqueror).

'''Granulation''' is a jewellery manufacturing technique whereby a surface is covered in spherules or granules of precious metal. The technique is thought to have its origins in [[Sumer]] about 5,000 years ago. In the first millennium B.C. the technique was used by [[Etruscans]] living in present-day Italy. Greek craftsmen also employed the technique, but it was the work coming from [[Etruria]] which became famous, in part due to the mysteries surrounding the process. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.langantiques.com/university/index.php/Granulation_and_its_Techniques&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three basic techniques that may be used to attach granules to a metal surface: hard soldering, fusing and colloidal soldering. The metals used in granulation are usually gold and/or silver alloys of high purity - alloys below 18 [[Carat (purity)|kt]]. gold and sterling silver being unsuitable. With each technique the process begins with the making of the granules themselves. The granules are usually made from the same material as the base to which they will be affixed. Very narrow fringes may be cut along the edge of a thin sheet of metal, a further cut producing small squares or rectangles of metal. After being melted into globules, these may be sorted into various sizes by the use of appropriate meshes. Another option is to use thin wire coiled around a mandrel, the coil then being cut into small rings - this creates even-sized granules when melted. 

'''Hard soldering''' metal items together exploits the [[capillary action]] of solder with a lower melting point flowing between the items to be bonded. Soldering is routinely used by bench jewellers and is an ancient technique, but is applied with great difficulty to small metal grains. Extremely small pieces of solder are positioned close to the point of contact between the granule and the metal, and then heated to melting point. The necessity of repeating this process many hundreds of times renders the technique impractical and expensive, complicated by the possibility of dislodging granules already attached. An improvement to this method is filing the solder to powder size and mixing it with the flux. The work area is painted with [[tragacanth]] and the granules are bedded on this using a fine brush. Having dried, the work is sprinkled with the flux-solder powder and heated to melting point. Surplus solder will lodge in the gaps between the granules, an effect which cannot be avoided.

'''Fusing''' joins metals composed of the same alloy by the use of heat alone. A sheet of metal of thickness near the diameter of the granules ensures an even heat distribution. The granules are positioned using a diluted flux and fine brush, after which the sheet is fired in a [[Reducing atmosphere|reducing]] oven. At melting temperature the granules and sheet metal fuse, leaving no flux or solder. This technique was used by the Etruscans in the first millennium B.C. Modern techniques achieve fusing by using electric current and the process is known as [[fusion welding]]. The electric current passes through each granule, generating sufficient heat to weld the granules to the base. This method may be used on finished items, even those with set stones. 

'''Colloidal or [[eutectic]] soldering''' was used by the Etruscans, and employs a colloidal mixture of tragacanth gum and copper salts. The mixture lowers the melting points of both granules and base, and causes the copper to diffuse into both at the point of contact, creating a strong metallic bond. The colloidal solder is painted onto the surface of the base, and the granules arranged on the wet solder using a fine brush, after which the piece is left to dry. It is then fired in a reducing kiln causing the tragacanth to burn off and release the copper salt. At the eutectic temperature (890&amp;nbsp;°C) the copper diffuses into the granules and base, joining them together.

The '''Hani languages''' are a group of closely related but distinct languages of the [[Loloish]] (Yi) branch of the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman linguistic group]]. They are also referred to as the '''Hanoid''' languages by Lama (2012) and as the '''Akoid''' languages by Bradley (2007).

Approximately 1.5 million people speak these languages, mainly in [[China]], [[Laos]], [[Burma]] (Myanmar), and [[Vietnam]]; more than 90% of the speakers of these languages live in China. Various ethnicities that use Hani languages are grouped into a single class [[Chinese nationalities|recognized nationality]] named ''Hani'' after the largest subgroup. In China, the languages of this group—which include [[Hani language|Hani proper]], [[Akha language|Akha]], and [[Honi language|Hao-Bai]] (Honi and Baihong)—are considered dialects ({{zh|''fangyan'' 方言}}). Western scholars, however, have traditionally classified them as separate languages.

==Varieties==
In China, Akha and other related languages are considered to be derivatives of Hani. They are not mutually intelligible, which means that speakers of one language do not necessarily understand speakers of the other language. In 2007, according to [[Ethnologue]], there were almost 1.5 million speakers of all Hani varieties. Slightly more than half (760,000) of these speakers can speak Hani properly (considering age etc.).
Lama (2012) groups the principal varieties of the Hani languages identified by Bradley (2007) as follows: Yunnan locations and speaker populations are from ''Haniyu Jianzhi'' 哈尼语简志  according to information from 1986. 
*'''Ha-Ya 哈雅''' had 850,000 speakers in 1982. The ''representative dialect'' is Dazhai 大寨 and is spoken in [[Lüchun County]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=120979 绿春县大兴镇大寨村委会大寨村]&lt;/ref&gt;

London &amp; New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; considers the Hani-Akha (Ha-Ya) and Haoni-Baihong (Hao-Bai) languages to be part of an ''Akoid'' subgroup.

In China, all of the [[Hanoish languages|'''Bi-Ka''' languages]] ({{zh|碧卡}}) are considered to form a single Hani dialect cluster ({{zh|方言}} ''fangyan''), and the speakers are officially classified as ethnic [[Hani people|Hani]]  (''Haniyu Jianzhi'' 哈尼语简志 1986). Recognized dialects include [[Biyue language|Biyue]] 碧约 (autonym: ''bi31 jɔ31''), [[Kaduo language|Kaduo]] 卡多, and [[Enu language|Enu]] 峨努. In Yunnan, China, they are spoken in Mojiang, Jiangcheng, Jingdong, and other counties, with a total of 370,000 speakers. The representative dialect is that of Caiyuan 菜园, [[Mojiang County]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=159437 墨江哈尼族自治县联珠镇回归村委会上菜园自然村]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=159438 墨江哈尼族自治县联珠镇回归村委会下菜园自然村]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
===China===
In China, Hani languages are spoken mostly in areas east of the [[Mekong]] River in the south-central [[Yunnan]] province, concentrated in the [[Pu'er City|Pu'er]] and [[Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture|Honghe]] prefectures as well as in parts of other surrounding prefectures. Hani is also spoken in [[Lai Châu Province]] of northwestern Vietnam, northern Laos, and [[Shan State]] of northeastern Burma.

===Vietnam===
Edmondson (2002) reports that the Hani of Vietnam is distributed in 2 provinces of northwestern Vietnam. The earliest Hani pioneers to Vietnam probably numbered around 5 to 6 families, and arrived in [[Mường Tè District]] from [[Jinping Miao, Yao, and Dai Autonomous County|Jinping County]] and [[Lüchun County]] in [[List of administrative divisions of Yunnan|Yunnan]] about 325 years ago. The Hani of [[Phong Thổ District]] and [[Bát Xát District]] arrived later, about 175 years ago from Yunnan. The Hani of Vietnam claim to be able to communicate in the Hani language with ethnic Hani from different areas of Vietnam despite significant geographical barriers. Edmondson (2002), however, reported different Hani speech varieties in various parts of northwestern Vietnam, which differ mostly lexically.

'''International Components for Unicode''' ('''ICU''') is an [[open-source software|open-source]] project of mature [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] libraries for [[Unicode]] support, software [[Internationalization and localization|internationalization]], and software globalization. ICU is widely portable to many operating systems and environments. It gives applications the same results on all platforms and between C, C++, and Java software. The ICU project is sponsored, supported, and used by [[IBM]] and many other companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://site.icu-project.org/home#TOC-What-is-ICU- ICU homepage - What is ICU?]&lt;/ref&gt;

ICU provides the following services: [[Unicode]] text handling, full character properties, and [[character set]] conversions; Unicode [[regular expression]]s; full Unicode sets; character, word, and line boundaries; language sensitive [[collation]] and searching; [[unicode normalization|normalization]], upper and lowercase conversion, and script [[transliteration]]s; comprehensive [[Locale (computer software)|locale]] data and resource bundle architecture via the [[Common Locale Data Repository]] (CLDR); multi-[[calendar]] and [[time zone]]s; and rule-based formatting and parsing of dates, times, numbers, currencies, and messages. ICU provided [[complex text layout]] service for Arabic, Hebrew, Indic, and Thai historically, but that was deprecated in version 54, and was completely removed in version 58 in favor of [[HarfBuzz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://userguide.icu-project.org/layoutengine Layout Engine - ICU User Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

ICU provides more extensive internationalization facilities than the standard libraries for C and C++. ICU 62 supports [[Unicode 11.0]], and older versions supports Unicode 10.0, but not for older platforms such as [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]], [[IBM AIX|AIX]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], or [[z/OS]].

ICU has historically used [[UTF-16]], and still does only for Java; while for C/C++ [[UTF-8]] is supported,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://userguide.icu-project.org/strings/utf-8|title=UTF-8 - ICU User Guide|website=userguide.icu-project.org|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the correct handling of "illegal UTF-8".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/13311|title=#13311 (change illegal-UTF-8 handling to Unicode "best practice") |website=bugs.icu-project.org|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and development==
After [[Taligent]] became part of [[IBM]] in early 1996, [[Sun Microsystems]] decided that the new Java language should have better support for internationalization. Since Taligent had experience with such technologies and were close geographically, their Text and International group were asked to contribute the international classes to the [[Java Development Kit]] as part of the [[JDK]] 1.1 internationalization [[API]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icu-project.org/docs/papers/history_of_java_internationalization.html | title=Getting Java ready for the world: A brief history of IBM and Sun's internationalization efforts |author=Laura Werner |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large portion of this code still exists in the {{Javadoc:SE|package=java.text|java/text}} and {{Javadoc:SE|package=java.util|java/util}} packages. Further internationalization features were added with each later release of Java.

The Java internationalization classes were then ported to C++ and C&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://userguide.icu-project.org |title=ICU User Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a library known as ICU4C ("ICU for C"). The ICU project also provides ICU4J ("ICU for Java"), which adds features not present in the standard Java libraries. ICU4C and ICU4J are very similar, though not identical; for example, ICU4C includes a Regular Expression API, while ICU4J does not. Both frameworks have been enhanced over time to support new facilities and new features of Unicode and [[Common Locale Data Repository]] (CLDR).

ICU was released as an open source project in 1999 under the name IBM Classes for Unicode. It was later renamed to International Components For Unicode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://site.icu-project.org/projectinfo | title=ICU Project Management Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, 2016, the ICU project joined the Unicode consortium as technical committee ''ICU-TC'', and the library sources are now distributed under the Unicode license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.unicode.org/2016/05/icu-joins-unicode-consortium.html|title=ICU joins the Unicode Consortium|date=2016-05-16|publisher=[[Unicode|Unicode, Inc.]]|accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1880">'''International premium rate service (IPRS)''' refers to internationally available telephone-based [[Premium-rate telephone number|premium service]]s. It is analogous to "900" or "976" numbers in [[NANP|North America]], which always incur a recipient-defined charge in excess of regular call charges. Internationally, this service has been allocated [[List of country calling codes|country code]] +979. IPRS numbers are known as UIPRNs.

The [[ITU]] recommendation for IPRS defines four charge categories, across which the +979 numbering space is divided:

{| border cellspacing=3 style="border: 1px solid #808080; border-collapse: collapse;"
! scope="col" width="50" | Range
! scope="col" width="100" | Charge band
! scope="col" width="75" | Designation
|-
| +979 1|| align="center" | 1 ||"High"
|-
| +979 3|| align="center" | 2 ||"Medium"
|-
| +979 5|| align="center" | 3 ||"Low"
|-
| +979 9|| align="center" | Special ||"Special"

UIPRNs are only available to premium service providers who will provide their service to more than one country.

The format of the numbers will be 979 a bcdefghi, where the a digit, 1, 3, 5 or 9, will indicate the charging band, and the remaining digits will be the IPRS subscriber's number.  1, 3 and 5 indicate charge bands 1, 2 and 3, respectively, while 9 will indicate a special charge band.

The service is not yet known to be active{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}. Once it is activated, it may not be available from every country{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}, even though there is minimal or no cost to the receiving customer, as interchange rates would need to be negotiated for countries to allow origination of calls.

[[File:Itzik Feffer, Albert Einstein and Solomon Mikhoels 1943.jpg|thumb|260px|Itzik Feffer (left), [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Solomon Mikhoels]] in the United States in 1943.]]
'''Itzik Feffer''' (September 10&lt;!--cf. The Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1979)--&gt;, 1900 &amp;ndash; August 12, 1952), also '''Fefer''' ([[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] איציק פֿעפֿער, [[Russian language|Russian]] Ицик Фефер, Исаàк Соломòнович Фèфер) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Yiddish]] poet executed on the [[Night of the Murdered Poets]] during [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge|purges]].

==Early life==
Itzik Feffer was born in [[Shpola]], a town in [[Zvenigorod]] ''[[uyezd]]'' (district) of [[Kiev]] [[guberniya]], [[Imperial Russia]].

==Career==

===World War II===
During the [[World War II|Second World War]], he was a military [[reporter]] with the rank of [[colonel]] and was vice chairman of the Soviet [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee|Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee (JAC)]]. He and [[Solomon Mikhoels]] traveled to the United States in 1943 in a well-documented fund-raising trip.

===Arrest and death===
In 1948, after the assassination of the JAC Chairman [[Solomon Mikhoels]], Feffer, along with other JAC members, was arrested and accused of [[treason]]. Feffer had been an informer for the [[NKVD]] (predecessor of the [[KGB]]) since 1943.  Feffer reportedly cooperated with the investigation, providing false information that would lead to the arrest and indictment of over a hundred people{{Ref|3}}, but at the trial, he made openly nationalistic statements and expressed pride in his [[Jewish]] identity. Feffer had also allegedly been one of the "most loyal and conformist Yiddish poets", who had helped to enforce strict ideological control over other Yiddish writers, and had a history of denouncing colleagues for their "nationalistic hysteria".{{Ref|3}} However, in 1952, Feffer, along with other defendants, was tried at a closed JAC trial, and executed on August 12, 1952, at [[Lubyanka prison]].

Feffer was rehabilitated posthumously in 1955, after Stalin's death.

==Paul Robeson==
The American concert singer and actor [[Paul Robeson]] met Feffer on July 8, 1943, in New York during a [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]] event chaired by [[Albert Einstein]], one of the largest pro-Soviet rallies ever held in the United States. After the rally, Paul Robeson and his wife [[Eslanda Robeson]], befriended Feffer and Mikhoels.

Six years later, in June 1949, during the 150th anniversary celebration of the birth of [[Alexander Pushkin]], Robeson visited the Soviet Union to sing in concert. According to [[David Horowitz]]{{unreliable source?|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--Exactly what makes David Horowitz a reliable source of information about what Feffer told Robeson in sign language? The fact that he is best-known for anti-Communist and right-wing polemics hardly makes him a neutral source on this subject.--&gt;,

{{quote|In America, the question "What happened to Itzik Feffer?" entered the currency of political debate. There was talk in intellectual circles that Jews were being killed in a new Soviet purge and that Feffer was one of them. It was to quell such rumors that Robeson asked to see his old friend, but he was told by Soviet officials that he would have to wait. Eventually, he was informed that the poet was vacationing in the [[Crimea]] and would see him as soon as he returned. The reality was that Feffer had already been in prison for a half year, and his Soviet captors did not want to bring him to Robeson immediately because he had become emaciated from lack of food. While Robeson waited in Moscow, Stalin's police brought Feffer out of prison, put him the care of doctors, and began fattening him up for the interview. When he looked sufficiently healthy, he was brought to Moscow. The two men met in a room that was under secret surveillance. Feffer knew he could not speak freely. When Robeson asked how he was, he drew his finger nervously across his throat and motioned with his eyes and lips to his American comrade. ''They're goin to kill us,'' he said. ''When you return to America you must speak out and save us.''&lt;ref&gt;David Horowitz, ''Radical Son: A Generational Odyssey'', page 74.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During his concert in Tchaikovsky Hall on June 14 - which was broadcast across the entire country - Robeson publicly paid tribute to Feffer and the late Mikhoels, singing the [[Fareinigte Partizaner Organizacje|Vilna Partisan]] song "[[Zog Nit Keynmol]]" in both Russian and Yiddish.&lt;ref&gt;Duberman 352-354.[http://claudet.club.fr/GhettosCamps/Disques/Mitsui.html Paul Robeson Live Concert in Moscow at Tchaikovsky Hall] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013042251/http://claudet.club.fr/GhettosCamps/Disques/Mitsui.html |date=2008-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recordings of the concert survived, but Robeson's spoken words are lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|jzPShrawxLc|Recording of Robeson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary work==

Feffer was a prolific poet who wrote almost exclusively in [[Yiddish]], and his poems were widely translated into [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]. He is considered one of the greatest Soviet poets in the Yiddish language and his poems were widely admired inside and outside Russia.

===Di Shotns fun Varshever Geto===
His epic poem {{lang|yi|Di Shotns fun Varshever Geto}} ("The Shadows of the Warsaw Ghetto" is a tribute to the 750 Jews who [[Warsaw ghetto uprising|rebelled against the Nazi liquidation of the ghetto]] and gave their lives fighting tyranny during World War II.

{{Culture of Peru}}

[[Peru]] is a [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] nation. Its [[official language|official]] [[language]] is [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. In the zones in which they are predominant, [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and other aboriginal languages also have co-official status according to Article 48 of the [[Constitution of Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.congreso.gob.pe/Docs/files/CONSTITUTION_27_11_2012_ENG.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Spanish, Quechua and Aymara, there are many Amazonian languages such as [[Urarina language|Urarina]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07 ]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aguaruna language|Aguaruna]] and [[Peruvian Sign Language]].

==Spanish ==

In Peru, the most common language is [[Spanish language|Spanish]], which is spoken by the majority of Peruvians (85.92% of the total population). Spanish is predominant in the media and in government.

The only aboriginal Andean languages in use in the highlands today are those of the [[Aymara languages|Aymara]] families (the latter including [[Jaqaru]]/[[Kawki]]). The Amazon region, however, is home to a wide range of family languages.{{clarify|date=November 2010}}

There are currently fourteen defined language families in Peruvian territory, in addition to many more isolated and unclassified languages, such as [[Urarina]].[http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07]

It is known that the number of languages that were used in Peru easily surpasses 300; some observers speak of 700. Yet from the time of European conquest, epidemics and periods of forced work (in addition to the influence of the [[hegemonic]] [[Spanish language]]), fewer than 150 can be counted today. &lt;!-- Aún así, el número es mayor, pero desproporcionado. --&gt;The following is an incomplete list of languages spoken today, and a number that became [[Language death|extinct]] in the twentieth century or that are [[Endangered language|endangered]].

===Number of speakers===

The aboriginal languages of Peru are spoken mainly in the central [[Andes]] and in the [[Amazon forests]]. A considerable number of languages were once spoken on the northern coast and in the northern Andes, but other than some in the northern highlands (Cajamarca, Inkawasi-Cañaris and Chachapoyas), all others have died out{{what|date=January 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newsela.com/articles/peru-save-languages/id/26733/|title=Newsela {{!}} Many native languages in Peru are in danger of disappearing|website=newsela.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; - Mochica is thought to have gone extinct in the 1950s.

In the Peruvian Amazon over forty languages, which are usually grouped into 14 families and diversifying about 120 recognizable local varieties are spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iinei.inei.gob.pe/iinei/RedatamCpv2007.asp?id=CensosNacionales |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910140319/http://iinei.inei.gob.pe/iinei/RedatamCpv2007.asp?id=CensosNacionales |archivedate=2013-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other languages==

In addition to the above, in Peru there is a large community of immigrants, some of whom maintain their native languages. These include the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (Cantonese dialect), and in smaller numbers, the [[German language|Germans]] (central Andes), [[Italian language|Italian]], the [[Arabic language|Arabic speakers]], and the [[Urdu language|Urdu speakers]]. The last two are products of the recent wave of immigrants from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Pakistan]]. Lately, the influence of [[English language|English]] has grown considerably due to the number of tourists and American and British residents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1358">'''Liveware''' was used in the computer industry as early as 1966 to refer to computer users, often in humorous contexts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/l/liveware.htm Liveware] (from the 'webopedia.com' website.

It is a slang term used to denote people using (attached to) computers, and is based on the need for a human, or liveware, to operate the system using hardware and software. Other words meaning the same or similar to liveware include [[wetware (brain)|wetware]], [[meatware]] and jellyware. Meatware and jellyware are most often used by internal customer support personnel as slang terms when referencing human operating errors.
The term liveware is found in the [[Culture series|''Culture'' novels]] by [[Iain M. Banks]]. A [[List of ships (The Culture)#Matter|Culture Ship]] is named "Liveware Problem".

'''Lozi''', also known as '''siLozi''' and '''Rozi''', is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]] of the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo language family]] within the [[Sotho–Tswana languages|Sotho–Tswana branch]] of [[Guthrie classification of Bantu languages#Zone S|Zone S (S.30)]], that is spoken by the [[Lozi people]], primarily in southwestern [[Zambia]] and in surrounding countries. This language is most closely related to [[Northern Sotho language|Northern Sotho]] (''Sesotho sa Leboa''), [[Tswana language|Tswana]] (''Setswana''), [[Kgalagadi language|Kgalagari]] (''SheKgalagari'') and [[Sotho language|Sotho]] (''Sesotho''/Southern Sotho). Lozi and its dialects are spoken and understood by approximately six percent of the population of Zambia. ''Silozi'' is the [[exonym and endonym|endonym]] (the name of the language used by its native speakers) as defined by the [[United Nations]]. ''Lozi'' is the [[exonym and endonym|exonym]].

The Lozi language developed from a mixture of two languages: [[Luyana language|Luyana]] and Kololo. The Luyana people originally migrated south from the [[Kingdom of Luba]] and [[Kingdom of Lunda]] in the [[Katanga Province|Katanga area]] of the [[Congo River]] basin, either  late in the 17th century or early in the 18th century. The language they spoke, therefore, was closely related to Luba and Lunda. They settled on the floodplains of the upper [[Zambezi]] in what is now western [[Zambia]] and developed a kingdom, [[Barotseland]], and also gave their name to the [[Barotse Floodplain]] or ''Bulozi''.

The Kololo were a Sotho people who used to live in what is now Lesotho. The Kololo were forced to flee from [[Shaka Zulu]]'s [[Mfecane]] during the 1830s. Using tactics they had copied from the Zulu armies, the Kololo conquered the Luyana on the Zambezi floodplains and imposed their rule and language. However, by 1864 the indigenous population revolted and overthrew the Kololo. By that time, the Luyana language had been largely forgotten; the new hybrid language is called Lozi or Silozi and is closer to [[Sesotho]] than to any other neighbouring languages in Zambia.

Lozi is also spoken in [[Zimbabwe]], [[Botswana]], and [[Namibia]] ([[Zambezi Region]]).

== Orthography ==

Lozi uses the [[Latin script]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omniglot.com/writing/lozi.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20130929101318/http://www.panafril10n.org/wikidoc/pmwiki.php/PanAfrLoc/Zambia&lt;/ref&gt; which was introduced by [[Christian mission|missionaries]]. In 1977, Zambia standardised the language's orthography.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20131110235805/http://www.panafril10n.org/wikidoc/pmwiki.php/PanAfrLoc/Lozi#toc7&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Life in Malaysia}}
{{Template: English language}}

'''Malaysian English''' ('''MyE'''), formally known as '''Malaysian Standard English''' ('''MySE'''), is a form of [[English language|English]] used and spoken in [[Malaysia]]. While Malaysian English can encompass a range of English spoken in Malaysia, some consider to be it distinct from the colloquial form commonly called [[Manglish]]. According to the [[EF English Proficiency Index|English Proficiency Index]], the average level of English in Malaysia is B1 on the [[CEFR]] scale. Due to the lack of use of English and the lack of English medium schools (which were phased out after [[13 May Incident|the 1969 race riots]]) to accommodate English speakers, the language has been in decline since the 1970s.

==Varieties==
Malaysian English may be categorized into three levels: the [[acrolect]], [[mesolect]] and [[basilect]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Encyclopedia of Malaysia|The Encyclopedia of Malaysia: Languages &amp; Literature]]'', p 61, edited by Prof. Dato' Dr Asmah Haji Omar (2004) {{ISBN|981-3018-52-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baskaran, M. |title= The Malaysian English mosaic |doi=10.1017/S0266078400000857 |journal=English Today |volume=10 |issue=1 |date= January 1994 |pages=27&amp;ndash;32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The acrolect is used by those with near-native level of proficiency in English, and only a relatively small percentage of Malaysians are fluent in it. The acrolect is internationally intelligible, and it is used for official purposes or formal occasions and written communications.  It conforms to standard [[British English]], but some words that are specific to Malaysia may be used.&lt;ref name="sung"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EvCmBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA208&amp;lpg=PA208 |title=Conditions for English Language Teaching and Learning in Asia|editors= Kiwan Sung, Bernard Spolsk |pages=208–209 |date=28 January 2015 |publisher= Cambridge Scholars Publishing |isbn=9781443872928}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="irsn"/&gt;

The mesolect is a localised form of English that is used by competent speakers of English or as an informal medium of communication between different ethnic groups of Malaysia. It may use some colloquial terms, and its grammar and syntax may show some deviations from standard English.&lt;ref name="hashim2"/&gt;

The basilect is used very informally by those with limited proficiency and vocabulary in English, and it has features of an extended [[pidgin]] or [[Creole language|creole]] with syntax that deviates substantially from Standard English.&lt;ref name="hashim2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="irsn"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2012/138928/ |title=The Many Faces of Malaysian English |authors=Jantmary Thirusanku and Melor Md. Yunus |journal =IRSN Education |volume= 2012 |date=2012 |doi=10.5402/2012/138928 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basilect may be hard to understand internationally, and it is often referred to as [[Manglish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=juAzDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13 |title=English in Malaysia: Current Use and Status|editor= Toshiko Yamaguchi, David Deterding |page=13 |isbn=9789004314306 |publisher=Brill |date=7 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other similar situations, a [[post-creole speech continuum|continuum]] exists between these three varieties, and speakers may [[code-switching|code-switch]] between them, depending on context. Most professionals and other English-educated Malaysians speak mesolect English informally between themselves, but they may also use a basilect depending on the circumstances. All three varieties may be seen as part of Malaysian English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ngPPJtDJ3gwC&amp;pg=PT70&amp;lpg=PT70#v=onepage |title=English in Southeast Asia: Features, Policy and Language in Use|editors= Ee Ling Low, Azirah Hashim |page=56 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |date=24 January 2012|isbn= 978-9027249029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but some prefer to see Malaysia English as a form distinct from the basilect Manglish, which tends to ignore English grammar,&lt;ref name="star"/&gt; while others may see the basilect as the "real" Malaysian English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/viewpoints/mind-our-english/2013/10/08/just-dont-call-it-manglish/ |title= Just don't call it Manglish! | author=Alistair King|work=The Star |date=8 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also no consensus on what Standard Malaysian English would be. Some regard the mesolect as substandard and a local dialect.&lt;ref name="sung"/&gt;

===Manglish===
{{Main|Manglish}}
Manglish refers to the [[colloquialism|colloquial]], informal spoken form of [[pidgin]] English in Malaysia that some considered to be distinct from more "correct" forms of Malaysian English.&lt;ref name="star"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/viewpoints/mind-our-english/2011/10/14/primer-on-manglish/ |title= Primer on Manglish |author=Lim Chin Lam |work= The Star |date= 14 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It exists in a wide variety of forms and primarily as a spoken form of English. It is the most common form of spoken English on the street, but it is discouraged in schools, where only Malaysian Standard English is taught. Its [[Lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] is strongly influenced by local languages, with many non-English nouns and verbs commonly used, and it is significantly different grammatically from Standard English.&lt;ref name="hashim2"/&gt; There are colloquialisms in English that are not common outside of Malaysia, which are also used colloquially as substitutes in other languages in Malaysia. In Manglish, Malay or Chinese grammatical structure may be used with English words, which is often done quite spontaneously, sometimes for comic effect.

==Features==
Since Malaysian English originates from [[British English]] when the [[British Empire]] ruled what is now Malaysia, it shares many of the features of British English. However, it also has components of [[American English]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Languages of India|Indian languages]], and other languages in its vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar.

Malaysia English shows a tendency towards simplification in its pronunciation and grammar, a feature also found in other new Englishes. For example, in pronunciation, [[diphthong]]s tend to become [[monophthong]]s in Malaysian English, stops may be used instead of [[dental fricative]]s and the final [[consonant cluster]]s often become simplified.&lt;ref name="yamaguchi"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=juAzDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12 |title=English in Malaysia: Current Use and Status|editor= Toshiko Yamaguchi, David Deterding |pages=12&amp;ndash;13 |isbn=9789004314306 |publisher=Brill |date=7 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 6 short monophthongs in Malaysian English, compared to 7 in British English, and [[vowel length|long and short vowels]] tend to have the same length (for example, "beat" and "bit" are homophones in Malaysian English). There are, however, slight differences in pronunciation in the states in the central and southern parts of the Malay Peninsula from those in the north and the east of Malaysia.&lt;ref name="hashim2"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ngPPJtDJ3gwC&amp;pg=PT70&amp;lpg=PT70#v=onepage |title=English in Southeast Asia: Features, Policy and Language in Use|authors=Azirah Hashim, Rachel Tan |editors=Ee Ling Low, Azirah Hashim |pages=57–59 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |date=24 January 2012|isbn= 978-9027249029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some variations in its vocabulary.

===Pronunciation===
*Malaysian English is generally [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]].
*Malaysian English has a broad ''s'', and words like "cab" and "tab" have {{IPA|/ɑː/}}, rather than {{IPA|/æ/}}.
*The {{IPA|/t/}} in words like "butter" is usually not [[intervocalic alveolar flapping|flapped]] (unlike in American English) or realised as a [[glottal stop]] (unlike in many forms of British English, including Cockney).
*There is no [[phonological history of English fricatives#''H''-dropping|''h''-dropping]] in words like ''head''.
*Malaysian English does not have [[phonological history of English consonant clusters|English consonant-cluster reductions]] after {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, and {{IPA|/d/}}. For example, "new", "tune" and "dune" are pronounced {{IPA|/ˈnjuː/}}, {{IPA|/ˈtjuːn/}}, and {{IPA|/ˈdjuːn/}}. That contrasts with many varieties from [[East Anglia]] and the [[East Midlands]] of British English and with most forms of American English.
*The 'th' fricatives (θ and ð) are pronounced as stops: [t] for [θ] and [d] for [ð].
*The 'l' is generally clear.
*The diphthongs are monophthongized 'ow' ([əʊ] or [oʊ]) becomes [o] and 'ay' ([eɪ]) becomes [e].

===Grammar===
The grammar in Malaysian English may become simplified in the mesolectal and basilectal varieties. For example, [[article (grammar)|articles]] and past-tense markers may sometimes be omitted, question structures may be simplified, and the distinction between [[count noun|countable]] and [[mass noun]]s may be blurred.&lt;ref name="yamaguchi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sung"/&gt; In the basilectal variety, omission of the [[object pronoun]] or the [[subject pronoun]] is common. The [[modal auxiliary]] system is also often reduced, and sometimes, a verb may be absent.&lt;ref name="hashim"/&gt; The colloquial form often has Malay or Chinese grammatical structure.

[[Grammatical particle|Particles]] are commonly used in colloquial Malaysian English, a notable one being an [[enclitic]] "lah" used at the end of a sentence.&lt;ref name="hashim"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ngPPJtDJ3gwC&amp;pg=PT76&amp;lpg=PT76#v=onepage |title=English in Southeast Asia: Features, Policy and Language in Use|authors=Azirah Hashim, Rachel Tan |editors=Ee Ling Low, Azirah Hashim |pages=62–65 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |date=24 January 2012|isbn= 978-9027249029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vocabulary===
In the acrolect, which is internationally comprehensible, non-English terms are still used, typically words for which there is no direct equivalence in English or those that express local reality; for example, ''[[bumiputera (Malaysia)|bumiputera]]'', ''[[kampong (village)|kampong]]'', as well as titles such as [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] and [[Tunku]]. Words from the Chinese or Indian languages may also be used, such as ''[[ang pow]]'' or ''[[dhoti]]''.  In the mesolect, local words and phrases for which there are English equivalents may also used like ''tidak apa'' or ''ulu''. In the basilect, the use of local terms may be extensive even if most words used are English, and local expressions or exclamations such as ''alamak'' often form part of the speech.&lt;ref name="irsn"/&gt;

==Word usage==
In the first half of the 20th century, Malaysian English was similar to [[British English]] but spoken with a Malaysian accent. However, in the postcolonial era (since 1957), the influx of American TV programmes has influenced the usage of Malaysian English. There is no official language board, council or organization to ensure the correct and standard usage of Malaysian English because after independence, [[Malay language|Malay]] replaced English as the official language. The [[University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate]] continues, however, to set and mark the [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] [[O-Level]] English Language "1119" paper, which is a compulsory subject for the [[Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia|Malaysian Certificate of Education]] (the English Language paper set by the Malaysian Ministry of Education is the same as the English Language "1119" paper for GCE O-Level).

To a large extent, Malaysian English is descended from British English, largely because of the country's [[British Malaya|colonisation by Britain]] from the 18th century. However, influence from American mass media, particularly in the form of television programmes and films has made most Malaysians to be familiar with many [[American English]] words. For instance, both "lift/elevator" and "lorry/truck" are understood, but the British form is preferred. Only in some very limited cases the American English form more widespread: "chips" instead of "crisps", "fries" instead of "chips" and "diaper" instead of "nappy".

Typically, for words or phrases that are based on other English words, the Malaysian English speaker may be unaware that the word or phrase is not used in British or American English. Such words are also present in the vocabulary of some continuums of [[Singapore Standard English]].

Many words of Malay origin have made it into the standard form of Malaysian English used in the media, literature and formal speech. For example, [[Chief Ministers of Malaysia|Menteri Besar]] (Malay for Chief Minister) even has a plural form in English - Menteri''s'' Besar.&lt;ref name="Bernama.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsgeneral.php?id=474426|title= Najib chairs 108th Meeting of Mentaris Besar and Chief Ministers|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140240/http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsgeneral.php?id=474426 |archivedate=29 June 2011 |work=Bernama - Malaysian National News Agency|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syntax==
Syntactical differences are few although in colloquial speech 'shall' and 'ought' are wanting, 'must' is marginal for obligation and 'may' is rare. Many syntactical features of Malaysian English are found in other forms of English such as British English and North American English:

*Can I come too? for "May I come too?"
*Have you got any? for "Do you have any?"
*I've got one of those already. for "I already have one of those."
*It's your shot. for "It's your turn."

==Phonology==
Officially, Malaysian English uses the same pronunciation system as British English. However, most Malaysians speak with a distinctive [[accent (dialect)|accent]] that has recently evolved to become more American by the influx of American TV programmes, the large number of Malaysians pursuing higher education in the United States, and by the large number of English-speaking Malaysians in cities employed in American companies. For example, that increased the emphasis on "r" in words such as "refer" and "world".

==Role of Malaysian English in Independent Malaysia==
Even though Malaysian English is not the official language of Malaysia, it is still used among Malaysians in business. About 80% of urban businesses in Malaysia conduct their transactions in English (both Malaysian English and [[Manglish]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} However, American English has quite a strong foothold in international businesses in Malaysia. Malaysian English is also widely used in advertising sectors, especially commercial advertisements aired in private TV stations, primarily [[Media Prima]] TV stations. Plus, [[Malaysian Chinese]] and [[Malaysian Indian]] people have tendencies to speak in English instead of Malay when they are interviewed on television. In terms of education, private universities and colleges in Malaysia mostly use Malaysian English for their identities. Most of Malaysian companies and organizations have adopt their [[legal name]] in English instead of Malay to keeping up with modernization in recent years.

In music industry, singers such as [[Siti Nurhaliza]], [[Yuna (singer)|Yuna]] and [[Reshmonu]] also performs songs in English. There are several English newspapers in Malaysia namely [[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]], [[The Sun (Malaysia)|The Sun]], [[New Straits Times]] and [[Malay Mail]]. There are also many English radio stations such as [[Hitz.fm]], [[Mix FM (Malaysia)|Mix FM]], [[LiteFM]], [[Fly fm]], [[TraXX FM|Traxx FM]] and [[Red FM (Malaysia)|Red FM]]. However, Malaysia does not have any [[television station]] which broadcasts purely in English. The Government National Language policy requires local TV stations to air at least 25% Malaysian-made programmes (either [[Malay language|Malay]] or English). Some privately owned TV stations (such as [[TV3 (Malaysia)|TV3]], [[NTV7]], [[8TV (Malaysia)|8TV]] and [[Astro Hitz.TV]]) do air some English Malaysian-made programmes. A few Malaysian-made TV programmes in Malay carry English subtitles and vice versa.

[[File:Matthias T. J. Grimme.jpg|thumb|Matthias T. J. Grimme]] 
'''Matthias T. J. Grimme''' (born 24. June 1953, in [[Hamburg]], Germany), stage name {{Nihongo|''Tatsu Otoko''|竜男|"Dragon Man"}}, is a German author, publisher of [[Sadism and masochism in fiction|sadomasochistic literature]] and magazines, a photographer and a [[bondage rigger|rope artist]] in [[Japanese bondage|Japanese style]] [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]].

== Life and work ==

After completing high school, Grimme studied [[nursing]] and [[social work]]. Afterwards he worked for about 15 years in various psychiatric institutions.

He worked as an organizer for the German [[men's movement]] and was a co-leader of men's groups. He published several books and stories about men and their relation to themselves.

Since 1989 he has been co-publisher of the biggest German SM magazine ''Schlagzeilen''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schlagzeilen.com/ SM magazine ''Schlagzeilen'']. Accessed 12 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He is author and editor of many articles about [[BDSM]], [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]], and [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]]. He is well known as the author of ''Das SM-Handbuch'' (''The SM Handbook'') and ''Das Bondage-Handbuch'' (''The Bondage Handbook''), which are the German standard handbooks for BDSM practitioners. Grimme is also co-owner of the BDSM publishing house Charon-Verlag.

Grimme is one of the few internationally known German bondage riggers. He appeared in many German documentary television films (for example in 1994 in "Das soll Liebe sein" in the [[ARD (broadcaster)#Television|ARD]] series ''Unter deutschen Dächern''&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|tt0994980}} Accessed 12 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;), and he participated in several bondage productions (for example in a five-part bondage q=workshop by Charon-Verlag).

Starting in 2000, Grimme visited Tokyo several times, becoming only the second-ever westerner to do public bondage shows in Japan (''East meets West'', ''Department H'', ''Loft plus One'', ''Tokyo Jail'', etc.). He met Japanese [[bondage rigger]]s, including Eikichi Osada, Akechi Denki, Chiba Sensei, [[Randa Mai]], Yukimura Haruki, Osada Steve, Kinoko Hajime, Kazami Ranki, Mira Kurumi and Yusuji Watanabe. Grimme's bondage style, the "Hamburg School of Bondage," is a mixture of what he has seen in Tokyo and his own inspiration.

Grimme was co-organizer of the first public SM parties in Germany, "Les Fleurs du Mal" (until 1998). Since 1999, he has been co-organizer of the "Respekt!" parties in Hamburg. He works as a BDSM performer and as an SM and bondage teacher, running his own workshops in Germany and abroad. Since 2000, he has been producing photographs and films for his "Bondage Project". Together with his bondage partner Nicole he creates ''Rope Art''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shadownight.de/lustbound/lustboundengl.html Website ''Rope Art'']. Accessed 12 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012, he has been spokesperson of the BVSM ([[Bundesvereinigung Sadomasochismus]], National Association of Sadomasochism). Until 2013, he operated the [[Body piercing|piercing]] and branding studio "Stahl Stich/Kiss of Fire" together with Andrea Grimme.

Grimme has been married to Andrea Grimme since 1999. He lives in Hamburg. Since 2000 he has worked together with his bondage partner and model Nicole (stage name ''Ropecat'') in performances and workshops.

During [[BoundCon]] 2017, Grimme received a Lifetime Achievement Award for special merits in the bondage scene and for his lifework.

{{distinguish|text=the Italian term [[melodramma]], used for opera, or the Andrea Bocelli song "[[Melodramma (song)|Melodramma]]"}}

[[Image:Perilsofpauline.jpg|thumb|upright|Poster for ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|The Perils of Pauline]]'' (1914), a classic melodramatic film series]]

A '''melodrama''' is a dramatic work in which the plot, which is typically sensational and designed to appeal strongly to the emotions, takes precedence over detailed characterization. Characters are often simply drawn, and may appear [[stereotype]]d. Melodramas are typically set in the private sphere of the home, and focus on morality and family issues, love, and marriage, often with challenges from an outside source, such as a "temptress”, an aristocratic villain.

In scholarly and historical musical contexts, ''melodramas'' are Victorian dramas in which orchestral music or song was used to accompany the action. The term is now also applied to stage performances without incidental music, novels, movies, and television and radio broadcasts. In modern contexts, the term "melodrama" is generally pejorative,&lt;ref name=PeterBrooks&gt;{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Peter|title=The Melodramatic Imagination: Balzac, Henry James, Melodrama, and the Mode of Excess|year=1995|page=xv|publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it suggests that the work in question lacks subtlety, character development, or both. By extension, language or behaviour which resembles melodrama is often called ''melodramatic''; this use is nearly always pejorative.

==Etymology==
The term originated from the early 19th-century French word ''mélodrame.'' It is derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''μέλος, melos'', "song, strain" (compare "melody," from ''μελωδία melōdia'', "singing, song"), and French ''drame'', drama (from [[Late Latin]] ''drāma'', eventually deriving from [[classical Greek]] ''δράμα, drama'', theatrical plot, usually of a Greek tragedy).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Costello |editor-first=Robert B. |year=1991 |title=Random House Webster's College Dictionary |location=New York |publisher=Random House |page=845 |isbn=978-0-679-40110-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor1-last=Stevenson |editor1-first=Angus |editor2-last= Lindberg |editor2-first=Christine A.|year=2010 |title=New Oxford American Dictionary, Third Edition |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=1091 |isbn=978-0-19-539288-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Pickett |editor-first=Joseph P. |year=2006 |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', fourth edition'' |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |pages=544, 1095 |isbn=978-0-618-70173-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melodrama originated in the 5th century BC.

==Characteristics==
The relationship of melodrama to [[Realism (arts)|realism]] is complex.  The protagonists of melodramatic works may either be ordinary (and hence realistically drawn) people who are caught up in extraordinary events, or highly exaggerated and unrealistic characters. Peter Brooks writes that melodrama, in its high emotions and dramatic rhetoric, represents a "victory over repression."&lt;ref&gt; Brooks, Peter (1995). The Melodramatic Imagination: Balzac, Henry James, Melodrama, and the Mode of Excess. Yale University Press. p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Singer, late Victorian and Edwardian melodrama combined a conscious focus on realism in stage sets and props with "anti-realism" in character and plot. Melodrama in this period strove for "credible accuracy in the depiction of incredible, extraordinary" scenes.&lt;ref name=BenSinger&gt;{{cite book|last=Singer|first=Ben|title=Melodrama and Modernity: Early Sensational Cinema and Its Contexts|year=2001|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|pages=44–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Novelist [[Wilkie Collins]] is noted for his attention to accuracy in detail (e.g. of legal matters) in his works, no matter how sensational the plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peters|first1=Catherine|title=The King of Inventors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melodramas put most of their attention on the victim and a struggle between [[good and evil]] choices, such as a man being encouraged to leave his family by an "evil temptress".&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Melodrama and Women's Films" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Other stock characters are the "fallen woman", the single mother, the orphan and the male who is struggling with the impacts of the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Melodrama and Women's Films" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;  The melodrama examines family and social issues in the context of a private home, with its intended audience being the female spectator; secondarily, the male viewer is able to enjoy the onscreen tensions in the home being resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Melodrama and Women's Films" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Melodrama generally looks back at ideal, nostalgic eras, emphasizing "forbidden longings". &lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Melodrama and Women's Films" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

=== Origins ===
Melodramas are rooted in medieval [[morality plays]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Melodrama and Women's Films" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; The melodrama approach was revived in the 18th and 19th-century French romantic drama and the sentimental novels that were popular in both England and France.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Melodrama and Women's Films" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; These dramas and novels focused on moral codes in regards to family life, love, and marriage, and they can be seen as a reflection of the issues brought up by the [[French Revolution]], the [[industrial revolution]] and the shift to modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Melodrama and Women's Films" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Many melodramas were about a middle-class young woman who experienced unwanted sexual advances from an aristocratic miscreant, with the [[sexual assault]] being a metaphor for class conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Melodrama and Women's Films" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; The melodrama reflected post-industrial revolution anxieties of the middle class, who were afraid of both aristocratic power brokers and the impoverished working class "mob".&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Melodrama and Women's Films" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; 

Beginning in the 18th century, melodrama was a technique of combining spoken recitation with short pieces of accompanying music. In such works, music and spoken dialogue typically alternated, although the music was sometimes also used to accompany [[pantomime]]. The earliest known examples are scenes in J. E. Eberlin's Latin school play ''Sigismundus'' (1753). The first full melodrama was [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[Pygmalion (melodrama)|Pygmalion]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Melodrama}}&lt;/ref&gt; the text of which was written in 1762 but was first staged in [[Lyon]] in 1770. The overture and an Andante were composed by Rousseau, but the bulk of the music was composed by [[Horace Coignet]]. A different musical setting of Rousseau's ''Pygmalion'' by [[Anton Schweitzer]] was performed in Weimar in 1772, and Goethe wrote of it approvingly in ''[[Dichtung und Wahrheit]]''. ''Pygmalion'' is a [[monodrama]], written for one actor. Some 30 other monodramas were produced in Germany in the fourth quarter of the 18th century. When two actors have involved the term [[duodrama]] may be used. [[Georg Benda]] was particularly successful with his duodramas ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos (Benda)|Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' (1775) and ''[[Medea (Benda)|Medea]]'' (1778). The sensational success of Benda's melodramas led Mozart to use two long melodramatic monologues in his opera ''[[Zaide]]'' (1780). Other later, and better-known examples of the melodramatic style in operas are the grave-digging scene in Beethoven's ''[[Fidelio]]'' (1805) and the incantation scene in Weber's ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' (1821).&lt;ref name=Apel&gt;Apel, Willi, ed.

After the [[English Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1660, most British theatres were prohibited from performing "serious" drama, but were permitted to show [[comedy]] or plays with music.  Charles II issued [[letters patent]] to permit only two London theatre companies to perform "serious" drama.  These were the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] and [[Lisle's Tennis Court]] in [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], the latter of which moved to the [[Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]] in 1720 (now the [[Royal Opera House]]). The two patent theatres closed in the summer months.  To fill the gap, the [[Theatre Royal, Haymarket]] became a third patent theatre in London in 1766. Further letters patent were eventually granted to one theatre in each of several other English towns and cities.  To get around the restriction, other theatres presented dramas that were underscored with music and, borrowing the French term, called it melodrama.  The [[Theatres Act 1843]] finally allowed all the theatres to play drama.&lt;ref&gt;Fisk, Deborah Payne (2001). "The Restoration Actress", in Owen, Sue, ''A Companion to Restoration Drama''. Oxford: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 19th century: operetta, incidental music, and salon entertainment ===
In the early 19th century, the influence of opera led to musical overtures and [[incidental music]] for many plays. In 1820, [[Franz Schubert]] wrote a melodrama, ''Die Zauberharfe'' ("The Magic Harp"), setting music behind the play written by G. von Hofmann. It was unsuccessful, like all Schubert's theatre ventures, but the melodrama [[genre]] was at the time a popular one. In an age of underpaid musicians, many 19th-century plays in London had an orchestra in the pit. In 1826, [[Felix Mendelssohn]] wrote his well-known [[overture]] to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', and later supplied the play with incidental music.

In [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[La Traviata]]'', Violetta receives a letter from Alfredo's father where he writes that Alfredo now knows why she parted from him and that he forgives her ("Teneste la promessa..."). In her speaking voice, she intones the words of what is written, while the orchestra recapitulates the music of their first love from Act I: this is technically melodrama. In a few moments Violetta bursts into a passionate despairing aria ("Addio, del passato"): this is opera again.

In a similar manner, Victorians often added "incidental music" under the dialogue to a pre-existing play, although this style of composition was already practiced in the days of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] (''[[Egmont (Beethoven)|Egmont]]'') and [[Franz Schubert]] (''[[Rosamunde]]''). (This type of often-lavish production is now mostly limited to film (see [[film score]]) due to the cost of hiring an orchestra. Modern recording technology is producing a certain revival of the practice in theatre, but not on the former scale.) A particularly complete version of this form, [[Sir Arthur Sullivan|Sullivan's]] incidental music to [[Alfred Tennyson|Tennyson's]] ''[[The Foresters]]'', is available online,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/foresters/for_webop.html The Foresters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903095411/http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/foresters/for_webop.html |date=2006-09-03 }} from Gilbert and Sullivan online archive&lt;/ref&gt; complete with several melodramas, for instance, No. 12 found here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gsarchive.net/sullivan/foresters/act1sc2.html|title = The Foresters - Act I Scene II|deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180403035622/http://www.gsarchive.net/sullivan/foresters/act1sc2.html |archivedate=3 April 2018|website = Gilbert and Sullivan Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few [[operetta]]s exhibit melodrama in the sense of music played under spoken dialogue, for instance, [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Ruddigore]]'' (itself a parody of melodramas in the modern sense) has a short "melodrame" (reduced to dialogue alone in many productions) in the second act;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gsarchive.net/ruddigore/web_opera/rudd24d.html|title= ''Ruddigore'': Dialogue following No. 24|website = Gilbert and Sullivan Archive|last1 = Gilbert|first1= W. S. |last2 = Sullivan|first2 = Arthur}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Offenbach]]'s ''[[Orpheus in the Underworld]]'' opens with a melodrama delivered by the character of "Public Opinion"; and other pieces from operetta and musicals may be considered melodramas, such as the "Recit and Minuet"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gsarchive.net/sorcerer/web_opera/sorc04.html| title = ''The Sorcerer'': No. 4: Recitative &amp; Minuet |website = Gilbert and Sullivan Archive|last1 = Gilbert|first1= W. S. |last2 = Sullivan|first2 = Arthur}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Gilbert and Sullivan's ''[[The Sorcerer]]''. As an example from the American musical, several long speeches in [[Alan Jay Lerner|Lerner]] and [[Frederick Loewe|Loewe]]'s ''[[Brigadoon (musical)|Brigadoon]]'' are delivered over an accompaniment of evocative music. The technique is also frequently used in Spanish [[zarzuela]], both in the 19th and 20th centuries, and continued also to be used as a "special effect" in opera, for instance [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten]]''.

In Paris, the 19th century saw a flourishing of melodrama in the many theatres that were located on the popular [[Boulevard du Crime]], especially in the [[Théâtre de la Gaîté (boulevard du Temple)|Gaîté]]. All this came to an end, however, when most of these theatres were demolished during the [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|rebuilding of Paris by Baron Haussmann]] in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatreonline.com/guide/detail_theatre.asp?i_Region=0&amp;i_Theatre=256#Le%20l'%E2ge%20d'or%20du%20Boulevard%20du%20Crime The golden age of the Boulevard du Crime] Theatre online.com (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th century, the term melodrama had nearly exclusively narrowed down to a specific genre of salon entertainment: more or less rhythmically spoken words (often poetry) – not sung, sometimes more or less enacted, at least with some [[dramatic structure]] or plot – synchronised to an accompaniment of music (usually piano). It was looked down on as a genre for authors and composers of lesser stature (probably also the reason why virtually no realisations of the genre are still remembered). Probably also the time when the connotation of cheap overacting first became associated with the term. As a cross-over genre mixing narration and chamber music, it was eclipsed nearly overnight by a single composition: [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'s ''[[Pierrot Lunaire]]'' (1912), where [[Sprechgesang]] was used instead of rhythmically spoken words, and which took a freer and more imaginative course regarding the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] prerogative.

===Czech===
Within the context of the [[Czech National Revival]], the melodrama took on a specifically nationalist meaning for Czech artists, beginning roughly in the 1870s and continuing through the [[First Czechoslovak Republic]] of the interwar period.  This new understanding of the melodrama stemmed primarily from such nineteenth-century scholars and critics as [[Otakar Hostinský]], who considered the genre to be a uniquely "Czech" contribution to music history (based on the national origins of [[Georg Benda]], whose melodramas had nevertheless been in German).  Such sentiments provoked a large number of Czech composers to produce melodramas based on Czech romantic poetry such as the ''[[Kytice]]'' of [[Karel Jaromír Erben]]. 

The romantic composer [[Zdeněk Fibich]] in particular championed the genre as a means of setting Czech declamation correctly:  his melodramas ''Štědrý den'' (1874) and ''Vodník'' (1883) use rhythmic durations to specify the alignment of spoken word and accompaniment.  Fibich's main achievement was ''Hippodamie'' (1888–1891), a trilogy of full-evening staged melodramas on the texts of [[Jaroslav Vrchlický]] with multiple actors and orchestra, composed in an advanced Wagnerian musical style. [[Josef Suk (composer)|Josef Suk]]'s main contributions at the turn of the century include melodramas for two stage plays by [[Julius Zeyer]]:  ''Radúz a Mahulena'' (1898) and ''Pod Jabloní'' (1901), both of which had a long performance history.

Following the examples of Fibich and Suk, many other Czech composers set melodramas as stand-alone works based on poetry of the National Revival, among them [[Karel Kovařovic]], [[Otakar Ostrčil]], [[Ladislav Vycpálek]], [[Otakar Jeremiáš]], Emil Axman, and Jan Zelinka. [[Vítězslav Novák]] included portions of melodrama in his 1923 opera ''Lucerna'', and [[Jaroslav Ježek (composer)|Jaroslav Ježek]] composed key scenes for the stage plays of the [[Liberated Theatre|Osvobozené divadlo]] as melodrama (most notably the opening prologue of the anti-Fascist farce ''Osel a stín'' (1933), delivered by the character of [[Dionysus]] in [[bolero]] rhythm).  The practice of Czech melodramas tapered off after the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Nazi Protectorate]].

=== Victorian ===
The [[Victorian era|Victorian]] stage melodrama featured six [[stock character]]s: the hero, the villain, the heroine, an aged parent, a sidekick and a servant of the aged parent engaged in a sensational plot featuring themes of love and murder. Often the good but not very clever hero is duped by a scheming villain, who has eyes on the [[damsel in distress]] until fate intervenes at the end to ensure the triumph of good over evil.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;Williams, Carolyn. "Melodrama", in ''The New Cambridge History of English Literature: The Victorian Period'', ed. Kate Flint, Cambridge University Press (2012), pp. 193–219 {{ISBN|9780521846257}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two central features were the [[coup de théàtre]], or reversal of fortune, and the [[claptrap]]: a back-to-the-wall oration by the hero which ''forces'' the audience to applaud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Jonathan|last = Rose|title = The Literary Churchill: Author, Reader, Actor|publisher = Yale University Press|date = 2015|pages= 11 and  174|isbn= 9780300212341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English melodrama evolved from the tradition of populist drama established during the Middle Ages by [[Mystery play|mystery]] and [[morality play]]s, under influences from Italian [[commedia dell'arte]] as well as German ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' drama and Parisian melodrama of the post-Revolutionary period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Michael Richard|last = Booth|date =1991|title =Theatre in the Victorian Age|publisher = Cambridge University Press|page = 151|isbn = 978-0521348379}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable French melodramatist was [[René Charles Guilbert de Pixérécourt|Pixérécourt]] whose ''La Femme &amp;agrave; deux maris'' was very popular.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Tulard (1985) ''Naploleon: The Myth of the Saviour''. London, Methuen: 213-14&lt;/ref&gt;

The first English play to be called a melodrama or 'melodrame' was ''A Tale of Mystery'' (1802) by [[Thomas Holcroft]]. This was an example of the [[Gothic literature|Gothic]] genre, a previous theatrical example of which was ''[[The Castle Spectre]]'' (1797) by [[Matthew Gregory Lewis]]. Other Gothic melodramas include ''The Miller and his Men'' (1813) by [[Isaac Pocock]], ''The Woodsman's Hut'' (1814) by [[Samuel James Arnold|Samuel Arnold]] and ''The Broken Sword'' (1816) by [[William Dimond]].

Supplanting the Gothic, the next popular subgenre was the nautical melodrama, pioneered by [[Douglas Jerrold]] in his ''[[Black-Eyed Susan]]'' (1829). Other nautical melodramas included Jerrold's ''The Mutiny at the Nore'' (1830) and ''[[The Red Rover]]'' (1829) by [[Edward Fitzball]] (Rowell 1953).&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt; Melodramas based on urban situations became popular in the mid-nineteenth century, including ''The Streets of London'' (1864) by [[Dion Boucicault]]; and ''Lost in London'' (1867) by Watts Phillips, while prison melodrama, temperance melodrama, and imperialist melodrama also appeared – the latter typically featuring the three categories of the 'good' native, the brave but wicked native, and the treacherous native.&lt;ref&gt;J. Rose, ''The Literary Churchill'' (Yale 2015) p. 11-13&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[sensation novel]]s of the 1860s and 1870s not only provided fertile material for melodramatic adaptations, but are melodramatic in their own right. A notable example of this genre is ''[[Lady Audley's Secret]]'' by [[Elizabeth Braddon]] adapted, in two different versions, by [[George Roberts (writer)|George Roberts]] and [[C.H. Hazlewood]].  The novels of Wilkie Collins have the characteristics of melodrama, his best-known work ''[[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White]]'' being regarded by some modern critics as "the most brilliant melodrama of the period".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Wilkie, ed. Julian Symons|title=The Woman in White (Introduction)|date=1974|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The villain is often the central character in melodrama and crime was a favourite theme. This included dramatizations of the murderous careers of [[Burke and Hare]], [[Sweeney Todd]] (first featured in ''The String of Pearls'' (1847) by [[George Dibdin Pitt]]), the murder of [[Maria Marten]] in the Red Barn and the bizarre exploits of [[Spring Heeled Jack]]. The misfortunes of a discharged prisoner is the theme of the sensational ''[[The Ticket-of-Leave Man (play)|The Ticket-of-Leave Man]]'' (1863) by [[Tom Taylor]].

Early silent films, such as ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|The Perils of Pauline]]'' had similar themes. Later, after silent films were superseded by the 'talkies', stage actor [[Tod Slaughter]], at the age of 50, transferred to the screen the Victorian melodramas in which he had played a villain in his earlier theatrical career. These films, which include ''[[Maria Marten or Murder in the Red Barn]]'' (1935), ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (1936 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'' (1936) and ''[[The Ticket of Leave Man]]'' (1937) are a unique record of a bygone art-form.

==Generic offshoots==
*[[Northrop Frye]] saw both advertising and propaganda as melodramatic forms, which the cultivated cannot take seriously.&lt;ref&gt;N. Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (Princeton 1971) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;
*Politics at the time calls on melodrama to articulate a world-view.  Thus [[Richard Overy]] argues that 1930s Britain saw civilisation as melodramatically under threat -  "In this great melodrama Hitler's Germany was the villain; democratic civilization the menaced heroine";&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. Rose, ''The Literary Churchill'' (Yale 2015) p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; - while Winston Churchill provided the necessary larger-than-life melodramatic hero to articulate back-to-the-wall resistance during [[The Blitz]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Webb, ''I Heard My Country Calling'' (2014) p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}

Classic melodrama is less common than it used to be on television and in movies in the Western world. However, it is still widely popular in other regions, particularly in Asia and in Hispanic countries. Melodrama is one of the main genres (along with romance, comedy and fantasy) used in Latin American television dramas ([[telenovelas]]), particularly in [[Venezuela]], [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]], and in Asian television dramas, particularly in [[South Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], [[China]], [[Pakistan]], [[Thailand]], [[India]], [[Turkey]] and (in a fusion of the Hispanic and Asian cultures) the [[Philippines]]. Expatriate communities in the diaspora of these countries give viewership a global market.

=== Film ===
Melodrama films are a [[subgenre]] of [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]]s characterised by a plot that appeals to the heightened emotions of the [[audience]]. They generally depend on [[stock character|stereotyped character]] development, [[interaction]], and highly emotional themes. Melodramatic films tend to use plots that often deal with crises of human emotion, failed [[romance (love)|romance]] or [[friendship]], strained familial situations, [[tragedy]], [[illness]], [[neuroses]], or emotional and physical [[:wikt:hardship|hardship]]. Victims, couples, virtuous and heroic characters or suffering [[protagonists]] (usually [[heroines]]) in melodramas are presented with tremendous social pressures, threats, repression, fears, improbable events or difficulties with friends, [[community]], [[Employment|work]], lovers, or family. The melodramatic format allows the character to work through their difficulties or surmount the problems with resolute [[endurance]], [[sacrificial]] acts, and steadfast [[bravery]].

Film critics sometimes use the term pejoratively to connote an unrealistic, pathos-filled, [[campy]] tale of romance or domestic situations with stereotypical characters (often including a central female character) that would directly appeal to feminine audiences."&lt;ref&gt;Dirks T ''[http://www.filmsite.org/melodramafilms.html Melodrama Films]'' filmsite.org website opinion&lt;/ref&gt; Melodramas focus on family issues and the themes of duty and love.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Melodrama and Women's Films" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; As melodramas emphasize the family unit, women are typically depicted in a subordinate, traditional role, and the woman is shown as facing self-sacrifice and repression.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Melodrama and Women's Films" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; In melodramas, men are shown in the domestic, stereotypically female home environment; as such, to resolve the challenges presented by the story, the male must learn to negotiate this "female" space.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Melodrama and Women's Films" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; Since men who are learning to operate in the domestic sphere appear "less male...and more feminized", this makes melodramas appealing to female viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Melodrama and Women's Films" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; Melodramas place their attention on a victim character.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Melodrama and Women's Films" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since melodramas are set in the home and in a small town, it can be challenging for the filmmaker to create a sense of action given that it all takes place in one claustrophobic sphere; one way to add in more locations is through [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] to the past.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Melodrama and Women's Films" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;The sense of being trapped often causes challenges for children, teen and female characters. &lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Melodrama and Women's Films" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; The sense of being trapped leads to obsessions with unobtainable objects or other people, and to inner aggressiveness or "aggressiveness by proxy".&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Melodrama and Women's Films" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists have noted four categories of themes: those with a female patient, a maternal figures, an "impossible love", and the paranoid melodrama.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Melodrama and Women's Films" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most film melodramas from the 1930s and 1940s, known as "weepies" or "tearjerkers", were adaptations of women's fiction, such as romance novels and historical romances.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Melodrama and Women's Films" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; Melodramas focus on women's subjectivity and perspective and female desire; however, due to the [[Hay's Code]], this desire could not be explicitly shown on screen from the 1930s to the late 1960s, so female desire is de-eroticized.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Melodrama and Women's Films" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 242-244&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the 1940s the British [[Gainsborough melodramas]] were successful with audiences. A director of 1950s melodrama films was [[Douglas Sirk]] who worked with Rock Hudson on ''[[Written on the Wind]]'' and ''[[All That Heaven Allows]]'', both staples of the genre. Melodramas like the 1990s TV [[Moment of Truth movies|''Moment of Truth'' movies]] targeted audiences of American women by portraying the effects of [[alcoholism]], [[domestic violence]], [[rape]] and the like. Typical of the genre is [[Anjelica Huston]]'s 1999 film ''[[Agnes Browne]]''.&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;Levy, Emanuel (31 May 1999) [http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117914225.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 "Agnes Browne (period drama)"] ''Variety''&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]], who was very much influenced by Sirk, contributed to the genre by engaging with class in ''[[The Merchant of Four Seasons]]'' (1971) and ''[[Mother Küsters Goes to Heaven]]'' (1975), with sexual orientation in ''[[The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant]]'' (1972) and with racism, xenophobia and ageism in ''[[Fear Eats the Soul]]'' (1974). More recently, [[Todd Haynes]] has renewed the genre with his 2002 film ''[[Far from Heaven]]'' and his 2015 film ''[[Carol (film)|Carol]]''.

'''Nanak Singh''', (b. July 4, 1897 as '''Hans Raj)''', was a [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] [[poet]], [[songwriter]], and [[novelist]]. His literary works in support of India's independence movement led the British to arrest him. He published novels that won him literary acclaim.

==Early life==
Nanak Singh was born to a poor Punjabi Hindu family in the [[Jhelum district]] of Pakistan as 'Hans Raj'. He later changed his name to Nanak Singh after adopting Sikhism. Although he did not receive a formal education, he started writing at an early age by writing verses on historical events. Later, Singh started to write devotional songs, encouraging Sikhs to join the [[Gurdwara Reform Movement]]. In 1918, he published his first book ''Sat guru Meh ma''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hcsingh.com/poems-and-political-phi/nanaksingh/ ]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which contained hymns in praise of the [[Sikh Gurus]]. It is considered his first commercially successful literary work.

==Indian Independence movement==
On April 13, 1919 British troops shot and killed 379 peaceful rally participants in what became known as the [[Jallianwala Bagh Massacre]] on [[Vaisakhi|Baisakhi]] (Punjabi New Year) day in [[Amritsar]]. Singh was present with two friends who were killed in the massacre. This incident impelled Singh to write ''Khomeini Visayans'' – ''Bloody [[Baisakhi]] ([[Vaisakhi|Punjabi New Year]])'', an epic poem that mocked colonial rule. The British Government became concerned about his provocative publication and banned the book.

Singh participated in India’s independence struggle by joining the [[Akali movement]]. He became the editor of Alkali papers. This was noticed by the [[British Government]]. Singh was charged with participation in unlawful political activities and was sent to Borstal Jail, Lahore. He described the savagery and oppression of the British on peaceful Sikhs during the [[Guru ka Bagh]] Mocha demonstration in his second poetry collection, ''Zakhmi Dil''. It was published in January 1923, and was banned within two weeks of publication.

Singh wrote several novels during his time in jail, including over 40,000 pages in longhand [[Gurmukhi]] (Punjabi) script. 

He was publicly recognized with many awards, including Punjab's highest literary award in 1960. His great historical novel, ''Ik Mian Do Talwaran'' (''One Sheath and Two Swords'', 1959), won him India’s highest literary honor, the [[Sahitya Akademi Award|''Sahitya Akademi Award'']], in 1962.

==Prolific writer==
In 1945 he wrote his popular novel ''Pavitara Papi'', which won him acclaim.  It was translated into [[Hindi]] and other Indian languages, and into English by his grandson [[Navdeep Singh Suri]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2003/10/20/stories/2003102002811200.htm |title=English translation of Punjabi novel released in U.K |publisher=The Hindu |date=2003-10-20 |accessdate=2012-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 the book was adapted into the successful motion picture, ''([[Pavitra Paapi]])'', by his admirer [[Balraj Sahani]].
 
Quoting [[Tribune (magazine)|the ''Tribune'']], "Nanak Singh was the best selling novelist in India for thirty to forty years. He wrote over 50 books including novels and collection of short stories. He made significant contributions to various literary genres. For him character was the determination of incident and incident the illustration of character. His greatest contribution to Punjabi fiction is its secularization. He depicted excerpts from contemporary life, cloaked with a veil of romantic idealism." {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In his novel ''Chitta Lahu'' (White Blood), Singh writes, "It seems to imply that in the lifeblood of our society, red corpuscles have disappeared." In 2011, Singh's grandson, Dilraj Singh Suri, translated ''Chitta Lahu'' into English (titled ''White Blood''). Natasha Tolstoy, the granddaughter of novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]], translated Singh's novel ''[[Chitta Lahu]]'' into [[Russian language|Russian]]. She visited Nanak Singh in [[Amritsar]] to present to him the first copy of the translated novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20041223/aplus.htm#1 |title=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India - Amritsar PLUS |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nanosyntax''' is an approach to [[syntax]] in which the terminal nodes of [[Concrete syntax tree|syntactic parse trees]] may be reduced to units smaller than a [[morpheme]]. Each unit may stand as an irreducible element and not be required to form a further "subtree."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nanosyntax.auf.net/blog/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510181826/http://nanosyntax.auf.net/blog/ |date=May 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some recent work in [[theoretical linguistics]] suggests that the "atoms" of syntax are much smaller than [[word]]s or morphemes. From that it immediately follows that the responsibility of syntax is not limited to ordering "preconstructed" words. Instead, within the framework of nanosyntax,&lt;ref&gt;Starke, Michal. 2011. "Towards an Elegant Solution to Language Variation: Variation Reduces to the Size of Lexically Stored Trees." MS. Barcelona, Spain.&lt;/ref&gt; the words are derived entities built in syntax, rather than primitive elements supplied by a lexicon.

The beginnings of nanosyntax can be traced to a 1993 article by [[Kenneth Hale]] and [[Samuel Jay Keyser|S. Jay Keyser]] titled "On Argument Structure and the Lexical Representation of Syntactic Relations,"&lt;ref&gt;Hale, Kenneth and S. Jay Keyser. 1993. "On Argument Structure and the Lexical Representation of Syntactic Relations." In ''The View from Building 20,'' edited by Kenneth Hale and S. Jay Keyser, pp. 53-109. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press. {{ISBN|978-0-262-58124-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; which first introduced the concept of l-syntax.

The '''Piawi ''' languages are a small independent [[language family|family]] of [[Papuan languages]] in the classification of [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]], which had been part of [[Stephen Wurm]]'s [[Trans–New Guinea languages|Trans–New Guinea]] proposal.

==Classification==
Piawi consists of only two languages:

* '''Piawi''' family: [[Pinai-Hagahai language|Pinai-Hagahai]], [[Haruai language|Haruai]] (Waibuk)

Davies and Comrie 1985 noted some pronominal similarities with the [[Engan languages]] in [[Trans–New Guinea]], which Ross took into consideration, but no lexical similarities. Comrie believes the family is as isolate. [[William A. Foley]] suggested that Piawi and [[Arafundi languages|Arafundi]] may be related (Comrie 1992),&lt;ref&gt;Comrie, Bernard. "The recognition of the Piawi language family." In Tom Dutton, Malcolm Ross and [[Darrell Tryon]], eds. ''The language game: Papers in memory of Donald C. Laycock''. 111-113. Canberra: Pacific Linguistics, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; and according to Ross a connection with Arafundi or [[Ramu languages|Ramu]] appears more promising than Engan. Timothy Usher confirms the link to Arafundi.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/newguineaworld/families/arafundi-and-upper-yuat-rivers NewGuineaWorld Arafundi and Upper Yuat Rivers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pronouns==
Below is a comparison of proto-Piawi, proto-Ramu, Arafundi, and proto-North Engan pronouns, per Ross. Initial nasals are ubiquitous, and indeed are very common throughout New Guinea, so they are in themselves not good evidence of a relationship.

His work ''[[Smarakasilakal]]'' (''Memorial Stones'') won the [[Sahitya Akademi Award|Central]] and [[Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award|State Akademi Awards]].&lt;ref name=academi&gt;[http://www.sahitya-akademi.gov.in/old_version/awa10311.htm#malayalam Awards &amp;amp; Fellowships-Akademi Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828042835/http://www.sahitya-akademi.gov.in/old_version/awa10311.htm |date=28 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early and personal life==
Kunjabdulla was born in 1940 in Karakkad near Onchiyam in [[Vatakara]], [[Malabar District]] (present-day [[Kozhikode district]], [[Kerala]]) as the son of C. K. Mammu and Saina, Kunjabdulla.{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}} He completed his primary education from Karakkad Mappila Lower Primary School and high school from Govt. Fisheries Technical School, [[Madappally, Vatakara|Madappally]]. He joined [[Government Brennen College, Thalassery]] and completed his pre-degree and a bachelor's degree in science.{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}} He wanted to continue his studies at Brennen College and to do his masters in Malayalam. He was dissuaded by the late critic [[M. N. Vijayan]], who was a teacher at the college's Department of Malayalam. "You don't have to do an MA to be a writer; all you need to know are the letters," his teacher advised him.{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}} He heeded the advice and went to the [[Aligarh Muslim University]] to study [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MBBS]]. He was a registered medical practitioner and served in government sector from 1970 to 1973 and at Vatakara from 1974 to 1976. He married Haleema and had three children.{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}}

Despite a conservative Muslim backgrounnd, Kunjabdulla was known for his wanton and unconventional life-style.{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}} He literally chose to celebrate life. [[Sethu (writer)|Sethu]] once said: "His calibre to depict commoners was astonishing. With this magic, he could have written great works. However, he chose to celebrate life and did not care to write great works unlike many of his contemporaries. His lifestyle can be cited as the reason for this hindrance."&lt;ref name=Sethu&gt;[[Sethu (writer)|Sethu]] (28 October 2017). [http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/2017/oct/28/punathil-kunjabdulla-he-exemplified-joie-de-vivre-1685166.html "Punathil Kunjabdulla: He exemplified joie de vivre"]. ''[[The New Indian Express]]''. Retrieved 2017-10-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Though he was born in a Muslim family, he never wanted to lead a religious life but wanted to live like a human being. He always described himself as a Hindu by culture, despite being born a Muslim.&lt;ref name=Scroll&gt;Anand Kochukudy (29 October 2017). [https://scroll.in/article/855767/both-life-and-literature-were-unconventional-for-malayalam-writer-punathil-kunjabdulla-1940-2017 "Both life and literature were unconventional for Malayalam writer Punathil Kunjabdulla (1940-2017)"]. [[Scroll.in]]. Retrieved 2017-10-29.&lt;/ref&gt; He liked alcohol and pork and never hesitated to admit it publicly.{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}}
 
In the 2001 Kerala assembly elections, Punathil unsuccessfully contested for [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] from [[Beypore]] constituency. He pitted against industrialist-turned-politician V. K. C. Mammed Koya of the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] and veteran politician M C Mayin Haji of the [[Indian Union Muslim League]]. He finished third, securing 10,934 votes. Kunjabdullah’s decision to contest on BJP ticket was a surprise for many. He later said in an interview: "They were the first to offer me a ticket. If the Congress or the CPM had offered me a ticket first, I would have accepted it. It is my commitment to the people and not any kind of affinity towards any particular party, that inspires me."&lt;ref&gt;Jestin Abraham (29 October 2017).

Suffering from various ailments during his final years, he died at Baby Memorial Hospital in [[Calicut]] on 27 October 2017, aged 77.&lt;ref name="Lal1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohan Lal|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: Sasay to Zorgot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KnPoYxrRfc0C&amp;pg=PA4119|accessdate=28 October 2017|year=1992|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-260-1221-3|page=4119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Hindu 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Noted Malayalam writer Punathil Kunjabdulla is no more | website=The Hindu | date=2017-10-27 | url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/noted-malayalam-writer-punathil-kunjabdulla-no-more/article19930601.ece | access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==
Kunjabdulla was inspired by [[S. K. Pottekkatt]] and [[Thakazhi]].{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}} He sent his first short story ''Bhagyakuri'' (1958) to ''[[Mathrubhumi Illustrated Weekly]]'' while he was still at school, hoping to get published in the children's section.{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}} However its associate editor [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]] chose to publish it in the general category.&lt;ref name=Scroll/&gt; Kunjabdulla has called MT his only guru, both in life and writing.&lt;ref&gt;K. Rekha (27 October 2017).

Retrieved 1 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Smarakasilakal]]'' (Memorial Stones), published in 1977, is set in a region near Vatakara where he grew up. The novel tells the story of Khan Bahadur Pookkoya Thangal, the head of a feudal family, and the patriarchal structure at work within the family.{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}}

Through the novel ''Marunnu'' (Medicine), which narrates the story on the life of MBBS students and of a medical college, Kunjabdulla introduced to Malayalam literature the world of hospitals and doctors.{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}} ''Paralokam'' also picked up on themes of death, another novel richly informed by his own life experiences as a doctor. He was a prolific writer of short stories as well. His story ''Kshethravilakkukal'' (Temple Lights) was chosen by [[M. Krishnan Nair (author)|M. Krishnan Nair]] in a collection of best short stories in the language{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}}. Kunjabdulla co-authored the novel ''Navagrahangulude Thadavara'' with [[Sethu (writer)|Sethu]]. They discussed it together, wrote separately and then edited it together. According to Sethu, it was a work with a difference, though born ahead of the times.&lt;ref name=Sethu/&gt;

The writer in Kunjabdulla had a great affinity towards Karakkad village in Vatakara where he was born. Many of his stories were reflections of his village and the characters like Vandikkaran Kunjhan, Bappu Kanaran, Moosa Musaliyar and Sankarakurup were real life people in his village.&lt;ref&gt;Ajith Kannan (28 October 2017). [http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/2017/oct/28/characters-carved-out-from-karakkad-in-vadakara-1685162.html "Characters carved out from Karakkad in Vadakara"]. ''The New Indian Express''. Retrieved 2017-10-29.&lt;/ref&gt; The years he spent at [[Aligarh]] also left deep impressions on Kunjabdullah. He was known as ''Aligadhinte Kathakaran'' as he introduced Aligarh in Malayalam literature. As an MBBS student, he spent 9 years in Aligarh Muslim University (1962-1970) and during his stay at Room No. 31 at VM Hal of AMU, he would write short stories on Aligarh and publish them in Malayalam journals. His experiences in the [[Uttar Pradesh]] city helped him write some of his most widely read short stories. ''Aligadhile Tadavukaran'' (The Prisoner in Aligarh), ''Marunnu'' (Medicine), ''Aligadh Kathakal'' (Aligarh Stories) are some of the famous books on Aligarh that he wrote. ''Cycle Savairi'' (Cycle Riding), ''Jeevachavangal'' (Living Cadavers) ''MoulanaInam Khureshi'', ''Kathi'' (Knife), ''Velichaththinte Maranam'' (Death of Light) and ''Smasanathilekku Nayikkunna Njan'' (Leading by me Towards the Graveyard) are some of the most known short stories on his Aligarh days.&lt;ref&gt;T.

Like Pookunjeebi in ''Smarakasilakal'' many of his female characters were strong personalities. Instead of depicting women in moodily love, he celebrated lust, passion of love and beauty through his women characters. The women characters in ''Kure Sthreekal'', ''Pranaya Kathakal'' and ''Ente Kamukimarum Mattu Kathakalum'' represented life as it is and the underlying tone was the lust.&lt;ref&gt;Saritha S.

In some [[common law]] nations, a '''recognizance''' is a conditional [[Obligation (law)|obligation]] undertaken by a person before a court. It is an obligation of record, entered into before a court or magistrate duly authorized, whereby the party bound acknowledges (recognizes) that they owe a personal debt to the state. A recognizance is subject to a "[[defeasance]]"; that is, the obligation will be avoided if person bound does some particular act, such as appearing in court on a particular day, or [[breach of the peace|keeping the peace]]. The concept of a recognizance exists in [[Scots law|Scotland]], [[Hong Kong law|Hong Kong]], [[Canadian law|Canada]] and the [[United States law|United States]]. People who are released on their own recognizance are subject to appearing before a judge on a certain day in the near future.

Recognizances are most often encountered regarding [[bail]] in criminal cases. In the United States, by filing a [[bail bond]] with the court, the defendant will usually be released from imprisonment pending a [[court trial|trial]] or appeal. If the defendant is released without bail having been set, the defendants are released "on their own recognizance". Release on recognizance is sometimes abbreviated as ''RoR'', ''OR'' (''Own Recognizance'', particularly in the United States), or ''PR'' (''Personal Recognizance'').

{{refimprove|date=July 2008}}

In [[BDSM]], a '''safeword''' is a code word, series of code words or other signal used by a person to communicate their physical or emotional state, typically when approaching, or crossing, a physical, emotional, or moral boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/beyond-safe-words-when-saying-no-in-bdsm-isnt-enough|title=Beyond Safe Words: When Saying 'No' in BDSM Isn't Enough|work=Broadly|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some safewords are used to ''stop'' the [[BDSM scene|scene]] outright, while others can communicate a willingness to continue, but at a reduced level of intensity.  Safewords are usually agreed upon before playing a scene by all participants, and many organized BDSM groups have standard safewords that all members agree to use to avoid confusion at organized play events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark |first=Tracy |url=http://www.salon.com/2012/01/29/real_abuse_in_bdsm/ |title=When safe words are ignored |publisher=Salon.com |date=2012-01-29 |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who practise the more permissive philosophy of [[risk-aware consensual kink]] may abandon the use of safewords, especially those that practice forms of [[edgeplay]] or extreme forms of [[dominance and submission]]. In such cases, the choice to give up the use of safewords is a consensual act on the part of the bottom or submissive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eCNHBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT118&amp;dq=Safeword%20bdsm&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHhLbst73QAhXHJsAKHRykCcUQ6AEIRjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Safeword%20bdsm&amp;f=false|title=Queer BDSM Intimacies: Critical Consent and Pushing Boundaries|first=R.|last=Bauer|date=28 October 2014|publisher=Springer|accessdate=22 November 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Çürükkaya lives in Germany and has published eight books, one translated into German and English.

==Biography==
Selim Çürükkaya in 1954 in what was then Tanzut, born to a village in [[Bingöl Province]] in the river valley between the towns of [[Palu, Elazığ|Palu]] and Murat [[Genç, Bingöl|Genç]]{{Clarify|date=August 2011}}. He attended primary school in the village and learned Turkish. After completing primary school, the village was renamed to İkizgöl. After primary school he went to live with an uncle in Ceyhan (in the Province of Adana), in order to visit the middle school. He stopped going to school and worked in a coal merchant and cafes. In the early 1970s he moved back to Bingol to finish high school. The village was temporarily destroyed by a landslide and elsewhere, 17 km from Bingöl, under the name Yeniköy been rebuilt.

In 1974 Çürükkaya joined the PKK and in the following year, while a student at [[Tunceli Teachers School]], travelled around southeast Turkey recruiting members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Blood and belief: the PKK and the Kurdish fight for independence |last=Marcus |first=Aliza |page=36 |year=2007 |publisher=[[NYU Press]] |isbn=978-0-8147-5711-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced in May 1980 by a military court in [[Diyarbakır]] to a long prison sentence. In his books he tells of torture and resistance. According to Daniel, he participated in several hunger strikes. His wife Aysel was placed in the same prison. In April 1991 he was released. He left Turkey and went to Mahsum-Korkmaz Academy in the Lebanese Bekaa Valley. He held various functions in the PKK, including as chief financial executive.&lt;ref name=nikbay2007/&gt; Çürükkaya fell out with [[Abdullah Öcalan]] because of his leadership style and the persecution and murder of intra-party critics. Çürükkaya was arrested on the orders of Ocalan and sentenced to death.&lt;ref name=nikbay2007&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding and responding to the terrorism phenomenon: a multi-dimensional perspective |last=Nikbay |first=Ozgur |author2=Suleyman Hancerli  |page=150 |year=2007 |publisher=[[IOS Press]] |isbn=978-1-58603-750-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He escaped from prison, came to Germany and had to hide from the organization. In Germany, Günter Wallraff sat for him and visited Öcalan in Syrian exile, to effect a pardon Çürükkayas.

In his book on  [[Abdullah Öcalan]], Selim claimed that Öcalan was also raping girls, and that he was acting like a sex- and murder machine among young (Kurdish) girls. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/pkk-verfuehrte-maedchen_aid_175164.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual jihad''' ({{lang-ar|جهاد النكاح}}, jihad al-nikah)  refers to the purported practice in which [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] women sympathetic to [[Salafi jihadism]] travel to warzones such as [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]] and voluntarily offer themselves to be "married" to jihadist militants, often repeatedly and in temporary marriages, serving sexual comfort roles to help boost the fighters' morale.&lt;ref&gt;SPECKHARD, A., YAYLA, A..

Publicity first arose in 2013, and the veracity of the practice became the subject of greater debate in September 2013 after the Interior Minister of the 98% Muslim nation of [[Tunisia]] made a public statement identifying it as a significant issue.&lt;ref name="beast10"&gt;Salama, Vivian (25 September 2013).

==Reports and allegations==
The term originated from a [[fatwa]] titled ''Jihad ul Nikaah'' and attributed to Saudi [[Wahhabi]] cleric Sheikh [[Mohamad al-Arefe]] around 2013, that called for  Sunni women supporters to come forward for sex jihad and boost the [[mujaheddin]] fighting the [[Bashar al Assad]] regime in Syria.&lt;ref name="alco1"&gt;(23 May 2013).

Allegations of this practice are related to the Tunisian government's war effort against Al Qaida-linked terrorism in the mountainous [[Jebel ech Chambi]] region bordering Algeria. The Tunisian coalition government alleges that the practice began with Tunisian girls sympathetic to the Islamic [[jihad]] movement there, and then spread with Tunisian girls volunteering comfort to Syrian jihadis.&lt;ref name=BBCSexJihad&gt;{{cite news|title=Tunisia's 'sexual jihad' - extremist fatwa or propaganda?

In April 2013, the Grand Mufti of Tunisia, [[Othman Battikh]], claimed that Tunisian girls were visiting Syria to take part in a sexual jihad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.alalam.ir/news/1466404 El Alam: "Mufti: serving Syrian terrorists sexually is haram - Giving sexual services to terrorists under the name of religion (jihad) in Syria constitutes adultery, which is religiously haram (forbidden), according to the Mufti of Tunisia."] April 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCSexJihad/&gt; In July 2013, President [[Moncef Marzouki]] replaced him as Mufti with Battikh alleging that he was replaced as punishment for speaking out.&lt;ref name=BBCSexJihad/&gt; The Tunisian allegation is that this practice is based on the concept that "the Law of Necessity allows forbidden things in exceptional circumstances." {{citation needed|date=February 2014}} On the basis of the fatwa, it was reported in Tunisian media that young Tunisian Sunni Muslim girls traveled to Syria to comfort jihadis. At least thirteen Tunisian girls were reported to have traveled to the rebel-held north Syria for sex jihad.&lt;ref name="dm04042013"/&gt;

In July 2013, on a Facebook page claiming to be connected to the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], a commentator promoted "sexual jihad". The page has been deemed a "hoax," and a senior Muslim Brotherhood supported called the page a "smear campaign".&lt;ref name="ibt13072013"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/489850/20130713/egypt-protests-sex-jihad-women-morsi-cairo.htm|title=Egypt: Is 'Sexual Jihad' Claim Part of Anti-Morsi Black Propaganda Campaign?|last=Sridharan|first=Vasudevan|date=13 July 2013|work=International Business Times|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.alarabiya.net/en/variety/2013/07/13/Pro-Mursi-protesters-are-awaiting-signal-for-sexual-Jihad-report-.html Al Arabiya: "Pro-Mursi protesters are awaiting signal for ‘sexual Jihad’: report"] 13 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 19, 2013, [[Lofti bin Jeddou]], the Interior Minister of Tunisia, stated in the [[Constituent Assembly of Tunisia|National Constituent Assembly]] that Sunni Tunisian women traveling to Syria for sex jihad were having sex with 20, 30 and even up to 100 rebels, and that some of the women had returned home pregnant.&lt;ref name="thp20092013"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/09/20/sexual-jihad-tunisian-women-return-syria-pregnant-rebels_n_3960370.html|title=Sexual Jihad Sees Tunisian Women Return From Syria Pregnant By Rebels, Says Minister|last=Nelson|first=Sara C|date=20 September 2013|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 6, 2013, a Tunisian official downplayed this prior claim, saying at most 15 Tunisian women traveled to Syria, though some were forced to have sex with several Islamist militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2013/10/06/Official-few-Tunisian-women-waging-Syria-sex-jihad-.html |title=Official: few Tunisian women waging Syria 'sex jihad' |publisher=Al Arabiya |date=6 October 2013 |accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tunisian Jihadist [[Abu Qusay]], who was interviewed by Tunisian TV after his return from Syria, confirmed that stories about "Jihad al-Nikah" or what is also referred to as "sexual Jihad" are not just a rumors but are real, as he himself had experienced it firsthand.

According to several media outlets, after this supposed fatwa ISIL fighters told families to "hand over [their] daughters for sex". Despite Sheikh Mohamad al-Arefe's denial, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reported that "leaflets in the captured cities of [[Mosul]] and [[Tikrit]] claim the women—virgins or not—must join jihad (...) and cleanse themselves by sleeping with militants. Those that refuse to do so are violating God's will, it is claimed, and will be beaten or killed.

In June 2014, it was reported by the Egyptian Daily newspaper ''[[Al-Masry Al-Youm]]'' that a Kuwaiti television show ''[[Kuwait wa al-Nas]]'' had reported that activists on social media were circulating reports that the Islamist group ISIL (the [[Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant]]) put up posters calling on the people of Mosul to bring them their unmarried girls to participate in "jihad al-nikah" or sex jihad. The statement was not independently verified by either ''Al-Masry Al-Youm'' or by ''Kuwait wa al-Nas''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/466402 Al-Masryalyoum: "إعلامي كويتي: «داعش» يطالب أهالي الموصل بتقديم غير المتزوجات لـ«جهاد النكاح"] 18-06-2014 (Arabic) | Arabic:  نطالب أهالي هذه الولاية بتقديم النساء غير المتزوجات ليقمن بدورهم في جهاد النكاح لإخوانهن المجاهدين في المدينة، ومن يتخلف سنقيم عليه الشريعة وتطبيق قوانين الشريعة  | Translation: ''We call upon the people of this county to bring their unmarried girls so they can fulfill their duty in sex jihad for their warrior brothers in the city and anyone who will not appear will feel the full force of the sharia  [Islamic law] upon him."''&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, the Iraqi Ministry of Human Rights announced that one member of ISIL had killed at least 150 females, including pregnant women, in [[Fallujah]] who refused to participate in sexual jihad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ISIS Just Executed More Than 150 Women In Fallujah|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/isis-just-executed-more-than-150-women-in-fallujah-2014-12|agency=[[NOW News]]|publisher=[[Business Insider]]|date=Dec 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.turkishpress.com/news/415983/ | title=Iraq: 150 women executed after refusing to marry ISIL militants | publisher=Turkish Press | date=December 16, 2014 | accessdate=November 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; No images have surfaced of the massacre, and no one has been able to independently verify it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Photo of 'women murdered for refusing sex jihad' is fake|url=http://observers.france24.com/en/20141218-photos-fake-corpses-sex-jihad|work=The France 24 Observers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Middle East Media Research Institute]] argued that denials of this "real phenomenon" by blaming it on Syrian propaganda was a result of secularist and Islamist tensions in Tunisia, and that it was declared as valid part of Wahhabi ideology by several religious clerics in their interview to Tunisia's most widely circulated independent daily, ''[[Al-Shurouq]]''.&lt;ref name=sexjihad4&gt;[https://www.memri.org/reports/tunisian-daily-al-shurouqs-campaign-against-sexual-jihad "Tunisian Daily Al-Shurouq's Campaign Against 'Sexual Jihad'"], [[Middle East Media Research Institute|MEMRI]], 1 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; == See also ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8673">The '''Texas Tommy''' is a vigorous social dance for couples that originated in San Francisco in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Albert and Josephine Butler, "Texas Tommy," in ''The Encyclopedia of Social Dance'' (New York: Albert Butler Ballroom Dance Service, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After the great [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] and fire, the [[Barbary Coast, San Francisco, California|Barbary Coast]], the red-light district of the city, was rebuilt and given new life as a tourist attraction, a place of dance halls, theaters, shops, and restaurants. Dance exhibitions and variety shows designed to attract tourists replaced prostitution as the chief business of the area. Many of the dance crazes that swept America during the 1900s and 1910s originated in this section of San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;H.E. Cooper, "Rag on the Barbary Coast," ''The Dance Magazine'' (New York), December 1927, pp. 31, 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The Thalia, the largest and most popular dance hall on the Pacific coast,&lt;ref&gt;Located at 732 Pacific Street, between Kearny and Montgomery streets.&lt;/ref&gt; was the birthplace of the Texas Tommy.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Asbury, ''The Barbary Coast: An Informal History of the San Francisco Underworld'' (New York: Knopf, 1933), p. 293. Reprinted by Thunder Mouth's Press, in 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; ("Tommy" was a slang term for prostitute.)

Around 1910, the Texas Tommy was a hit at a lowlife hot spot called Purcell's, a Negro cabaret, but it became respectable when it was danced at the upscale Fairmont Hotel, the most popular venue for ballroom dancing in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Along with the Texas Tommy, patrons at the Fairmont helped to popularize the Bunny Hug, the Turkey Trot, and the Grizzly Bear.&lt;/ref&gt; Who invented the Texas Tommy is obscure. Most likely the signature moves of the dance were being performed by patrons at Purcell's, and some innovative visitor adapted them for the ballroom floor. Some historians say that Johnny Peters, an African American, developed the Texas Tommy some time before 1910. In any event, after sheet music for "The Texas Tommy Swing" was published on 1 February 1911, the Fairmont's house band frequently played the song for its patrons. It was not long before the Texas Tommy was danced on Broadway, in ''Ziegfeld Follies of 1911'', performed by Vera Maxwell, Harry Watson Jr., and the ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Norton, ''A Chronology of American Musical Theater'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002), vol. 1, p. 966.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also included as a number in ''Darktown Follies'', an all-black musical produced Off-Broadway in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall and Jean Stearns, ''Jazz Dance: The Story of American Vernacular Dance'' (New York: Macmillan, 1968), p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; Peters and Ethel Williams, who were masters of the dance, executed it on stage, as they had done regularly at the Fairmont.&lt;ref&gt;Julie Malnig, ''Ballroom, Boogie, Shimmy, Sham, Shake: A Social and Popular Dance Reader'' (Evanston: University of Illinois Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Some social dance historians have argued that the Texas Tommy was the first swing dance. The argument is that it was the first social dance using the basic 8-count rhythm of swing dance to include a breakaway step from the closed position of other couple dances of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Conyers, "Texas Tommy," in ''The Grove Dictionary of American Music'', 2nd ed., edited by Charles Hiroshi Garrett (New York: Oxford University Press, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Ethel Williams, who helped to popularize the dance in New York in 1913, described it as a "kick and a hop three times on each foot followed by a slide." The basic steps are followed by a breakaway, an open position that allowed for acrobatics, antics, improvisations, and showing off. Working from an old film of the dance, she also described it as having a basic pattern of "a loose step, hop-kick, step, hop-kick, run, run, run, run" and identified a "useful variation" of four step-kicks that "agrees with the open and improvisational manner that the Texas Tommy was described to have in many of the written references."&lt;ref&gt;Rebeca Ruth Strickland, "The Texas Tommy: Its History, Controversies, and Influence on American Vernacular Dance," M.A. thesis, Florida State University, 31 March 2006, p. 59. Electronic Theses, Treatises, and Dissertations, paper 1538, http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available.&lt;/ref&gt;

One reviewer of the Texas Tommy number in ''Ziegfeld Follies of 1911'' described the dance in these words: "The Texas Tommy dancers are perhaps more acrobatic than eccentric . . . the whirl which spins his partner towards the footlights with such momentum that without aid she must assuredly fly across them must be nicely adjusted so that in neither force nor direction shall she escape the restraining grasp of his hand outstretched just at the right moment to arrest her."&lt;ref&gt;Caroline and Charles H. Coffin, ''Dancing and Dancers of Today: The Modern Revival of Dancing as an Art'' (New York: Dodd, Mead, 1912).&lt;/ref&gt; A more modern writer put it in simpler terms, saying that it was "a whirling couple dance with a momentum that nearly catapulted the female partner across the orchestra pit."&lt;ref&gt;Constance Valis Hill, ''Tap Dancing America: A Cultural History'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Texas Tommy (dance move)|Texas Tommy]] was later used to name a typical [[swingout]] dance move that was a characteristic of the Lindy Hop in the 1930s.

== Original sheet music ==
The "Texas Tommy Swing" was composed by Sid Brown, with lyrics by Val Harris, and was published by the World's Fair Publishing Company in San Francisco in January or February 1911. The sheet music cover was designed in the form of the front page of a newspaper, with the headline reading "The Dance That Makes the Whole World Stare." The faux newspaper included reprints of three articles from the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'', headlined "Pavlowa Endorsed Texas Tommy Swing," "Mrs. Oelriches Liked Texas Tommy Swing," and "The Story of the Dance," which is transcribed here:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A breath from the cotton fields - the [[Grizzly Bear (dance)|grizzly bear]], the [[Bunny Hug|loving hug]], the walk-back and the [[Turkey Trot|turkey-trot]] all blend in Texas Tommy Swing.

The Texas Tommy Swing invades the north and east like a dainty zephyr from the perfumed cotton fields of the sunny South.  The rhythm of the Grizzy Bear, the inspiration of the Loving Hug, the grace of the Walk-Back and the abandon of the Turkey-Trot all belend in the harmony of the Texas Tommy Swing, which was really the parent of all the others.

The dance originated more than forty years ago among the negroes of the old Southern plantations.  Every little movement has a meaning all its own to the heart truly in tune with nature.  The graceful harmonies of the song and dance reflect the joyous spirit of the negro race, the care-free actions of the Dinahs and the Sams who gathered outside the cabin doors on moonlit nights and to the twang of the banjo or the scrape of the fiddle, vented the rhapsodies of mind and body in a purely natural way.

Here and there a raucous discord like the squaking voice of a chicken in distress breaks in upon the frivolous melody of the theme or a plaintive note brings a reminder of the tear always so close to the laugh in the negro nature.

Southern darkies brought the dance and a suggestion of the melody to San Francisco several years ago, and there upon the Barbary Coast it was rounded into perfect harmony.  It took the place by storm.  Eastern people interested in dancing took it up.  Stage favorites seized upon its absorbing rhapsodies.

Society men and women accepted and adopted it.  [[Anna Pavlova|Pavlowa]], the [[Czar]]'s favorite dancer, went into raptures over it and incorporated it in her repertoire.  Leaders of the four hundred all over the country regard it as one of the sights of San Francisco and endorse it to their friends on their return.

In tangible and concrete form this inspiring, historic and dramatic song and dance is now presented to the public for the first time, in Texas Tommy Swing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7427">'''The Farmer and the Viper''' is one of [[Aesop's Fables]], numbered 176 in the [[Perry Index]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/176.htm Aesopica site]&lt;/ref&gt; It has the moral that kindness to the evil will be met by betrayal and is the source of the idiom 'to nourish a viper in one's bosom'. The fable is not to be confused with [[The Snake and the Farmer]], which looks back to a situation when friendship was possible between the two.

==The story==
The story concerns a [[farmer]] who finds a [[Viperidae|viper]] freezing in the snow.  Taking pity on it, he picks it up and places it within his coat. The viper, revived by the warmth, bites his rescuer, who dies realizing that it is his own fault. The story is recorded in both Greek and Latin sources. In the former, the farmer dies reproaching himself "for pitying a scoundrel," while in the version by [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]] the snake says that he bit his benefactor "to teach the lesson not to expect a reward from the wicked." The latter sentiment is made the moral in Medieval versions of the fable. [[Odo of Cheriton]]'s snake answers the farmer's demand for an explanation with a counter-question, "Did you not know that there is enmity and natural antipathy between your kind and mine? Did you not know that a serpent in the bosom, a mouse in a bag and fire in a barn give their hosts an ill reward?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mythfolklore.net/aesopica/odo/59.htm Fable 59]&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times the fable has been applied in the religious sphere to teach that if one participates in unrighteous activities one is not immune to harm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lds.org/new-era/1990/05/the-aaronic-priesthood-whats-so-great-about-it?lang=eng Church of Latter Day Saints]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesop's fable was so widespread in Classical times that allusions to it became proverbial. One of the very earliest is in a poem by the 6th century BCE Greek poet [[Theognis of Megara]], who refers to a friend who has betrayed him as the 'chill and wily snake that I cherished in my bosom'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Elegiac Poems of Theognis'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0479%3Avolume%3D1%3Atext%3D11%3Asection%3D2 lines 601-2]&lt;/ref&gt; In the work of [[Cicero]] it appears as ''In sinu viperam habere'' (to have a snake in the breast) and in [[Erasmus]]' 16th century collection of proverbial phrases, the ''[[Adagia]]'', as ''Colubrum in sinu fovere'' (to nourish a serpent in one's bosom).&lt;ref&gt;''Thesaurus proverbiorum medii aevi'', Berlin 2000, p. 129 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pjQryVw7Z5QC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=in+sinu+viperam+habere&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nUmRarbFha&amp;sig=KwoXX_DP3cf5Kax1j7QHkhJwIH8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XuxTTcPSE4-1hAfH7-HNCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=in%20sinu%20viperam%20habere&amp;f=false Available on Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; The usual English form is 'to nourish a snake (or viper) in one's bosom', a phrase used by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (''Merchant's Tale'', line 1786), [[William Shakespeare]] (''Richard II'' 3.2.129–31,) [[John Milton]] (''Samson Agonistes'', line 763) and [[John Dryden]] (''All for Love'' 4.1.464–66), among the foremost.

==Variations on a theme==
[[File:Serpens griset.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|An illustration of La Fontaine's fable by Ernest Griset]]
In one of the fable's alternative versions, the farmer takes the snake home to revive it and is bitten there. [[Eustache Deschamps]] told it this way in a moral [[Ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]] dating from the end of the 14th century in which the repeated refrain is "Evil for good is often the return."&lt;ref&gt;''Poésies morales et historiques d'Eustache Deschamps," Paris 1832,  [http://booksnow2.scholarsportal.info/ebooks/oca4/25/posiesmoralese00descuoft/posiesmoralese00descuoft_bw.pdf pp.187-8]&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Caxton]] amplified this version by having the snake threaten the farmer's wife and then strangle the farmer when he tried to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/caxton/110.htm ''Fables of Esope'' 1.10]&lt;/ref&gt; In still another variation, the farmer kills the snake with an axe when it threatens his wife and children. [[La Fontaine's Fables|La Fontaine]] tells it thus as "Le villageois et le serpent" (VI.13).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/25357/25357-h/25357-h.htm#Page_102 An English version is on the Guttenberg site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian fabulist [[Ivan Krylov]], who often used La Fontaine's fables for a variation of his own, adapted the story to address contemporary circumstances in his "The Peasant &amp; The Snake".  Written at a time when many Russian families were employing French prisoners from [[Napoleon I]]'s invasion of 1812 to educate their children, he expressed his distrust of the defeated enemy. In his fable the snake seeks sanctuary in a peasant home and pleads to be taken in as a servant. The peasant replies that he cannot take the risk of endangering his family and kills the snake.&lt;ref&gt;"Kriloff's Fables," translated into the original metres by C.Fillingham Coxwell, London 1920, pp. 94-5 [https://books.google.com/books?id=-qAz2YUf0qoC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Archived online]&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{wikisource|Egotism; or, The Bosom-Serpent|Egotism or The Bosom-Serpent}}
In [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s short story "[[Egotism; or, The Bosom-Serpent|Egotism or The Bosom-Serpent]]" (1843), the proverbial phrase as used in Milton's [[Samson Agonistes]] was given a new psychological twist. Sampson was alluding to cherishing the proverbial 'snake in the bosom', in this case the woman who had betrayed him. In Hawthorne's story a husband separated from his wife, but still dwelling upon her, becomes inturned and mentally unstable. The obsession that is killing him (and may even have taken physical form) vanishes once the couple are reconciled. 

[[Khushwant Singh]]'s short story "The Mark of Vishnu" (1950) adapts the situation of the fable to an Eastern background. A [[Brahmin]] priest, assured in the belief that a [[cobra]] has a godly nature and will never harm others if treated courteously, is nevertheless killed by the snake when trying to heal and feed it.&lt;ref&gt;''The collected short stories of Khushwant Singh'', Delhi 1989, pp.13-16 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=V_gOp_Kr358C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=The+mark+of+Vishnu+Khushwant+Singh&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Hdyhud7pG4&amp;sig=GvjSSux1HNqGFFbdVlaxTSgOHNY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=d_lTTa_qFYiShAe-lcnJCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20mark%20of%20Vishnu%20Khushwant%20Singh&amp;f=false Available on Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oscar Brown Jr.]] adapted the fable in the form of a poem he called "The Snake"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Al Wilson The Snake Lyrics |url=https://genius.com/Al-wilson-the-snake-lyrics |website=Genius Lyrics |publisher=Genius Media Group, Inc. |accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then in 1963 set it to music. The [[The Snake (song)|song]] was recorded in several popular versions in the 1960s and 1970s.

'''Transpiranto''' is a [[artistic language#Jokelangs|parody language]], a caricature of the international auxiliary language [[Esperanto]]. The name contains a play on the Swedish verb ''transpirera'', to perspire. The parody language was developed from 1929 by contributors to the publication [[Grönköpings Veckoblad]] (a Swedish satirical monthly whose title includes the word 'weekly'), through a series of comical translations of well-known Scandinavian songs and poems, more than 200 in all.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The first two Transpiranto poems were written by [[Nils Hasselskog]].

In recent years, several poems originally written in Esperanto have been rendered into Transpiranto by Martin Weichert, and have been published in the Swedish Esperanto journal ''La Espero'', and via the internet. 

Texts in Transpiranto consist of short phrases taken straight from English, German, French, Spanish, Italian and Latin, alternating with more strictly Esperanto-like fragments, and with Swedish slang.

Esperanto has been compared to Transpiranto by the linguist Bengt Sigurd, a contributor to a Swedish anthology about language issues.&lt;ref&gt;Sigurd, Bengt. 1993.

'''Ursula Bellugi''' is a Professor and Director of the Laboratory for Cognitive Neuroscience at the [[Salk Institute]] in [[La Jolla, California]].  Broadly stated, she conducts research on the [[neurolinguistics|biological bases of language]].  More specifically, she has studied the neurological bases of [[American Sign Language]] extensively, and her work has led to the discovery that the left hemisphere of the human brain becomes specialized for language, whether spoken or signed, a striking demonstration of neuronal plasticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Klima |first1= Edward |authorlink1= |last2= Bellugi|first2= Ursula |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title= The Signs of Language |trans-title=|url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= Paperback |series= |volume= |year= 1988 |origyear= |publisher= Harvard University Press |location= Cambridge, MA |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |trans-chapter=|chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate=|postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Bellugi |first1= Ursula |authorlink1= |last2= Studdert-Kennedy|first2= M. |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title= Signed and Spoken Language: Biological Constraints on Linguistic Form |trans-title=|url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year= 1980 |origyear= |publisher= Weinheim |location= Deerfield Beach, FL |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |trans-chapter=|chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate=|postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Poizner |first1= H. |authorlink1= |last2= Klima |first2= Edward |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= Bellugi, Ursula |title= What the Hands Reveal about the Brain |trans-title=|url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year= 1987 |origyear= |publisher= MIT Press/Bradford Books |location= Cambridge, MA |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |trans-chapter=|chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate=|postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bellugi |first=Ursula |title=Language, modality and the brain |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |volume=10 |pages=380–388 |doi=10.1016/0166-2236(89)90076-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has also investigated the language abilities of individuals with [[Williams Syndrome]], a puzzling genetically based disorder that leaves language, facial recognition and social skills remarkably well-preserved in contrast to severe inadequacy in other cognitive aptitudes. The search for the underlying biological basis for this disorder is providing new opportunities for understanding how brain structure and function relate to cognitive capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Bellugi |first1= Ursula |authorlink1= |last2= Hickok |first2= Greg |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title= Clues to the neurobiology of language |trans-title=|url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |origyear= |publisher= |location= Washington DC; Library of Congress |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |trans-chapter=|chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate=|postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hickok |first=Greg |author2=Bellugi, Ursula  |title=The signs of aphasia |journal=Handbook of neuropsychology |volume=2 |pages=38–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bellugi |first=Ursula |author2=Lichtenberger, L. |author3=Mills, D. |author4=Galaburda, A.  |author5=Korenberg, J.R. |year= 1999 |title=Bridging cognition, brain and molecular genetics: Evidence from Williams syndrome |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |volume=22 |pages=197–208 |pmid=10322491 |doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(99)01397-1 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Journey from cognition to brain to gene |last= Bellugi |first= Ursula |authorlink= |author2=St. George, M. |year= 2001 |publisher= MIT Press |location= Cambridge, MA |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bellugi |first=Ursula |author2=Järvinen-Pasley, A. |author3=Doyle, T. |author4=Reilly, J. |author5=Korenberg, J. |year= 2007 |title=Affect, social behavior and brain in Williams syndrome |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=16 |pages=99–104 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00484.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Korenberg |first= J.R. |author2=Bellugi, U. |author3=Salandanan, L.S. |author4=Mills, D.L. |author5=Reiss, A.L. |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Human Genome |title= Williams syndrome: A neurogenetic model of human behavior |url= |accessdate= |edition= |publisher= |volume= |location= |id= |doi= |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chailangkarn|first=Thanathom|last2=Trujillo|first2=Cleber A.|last3=Freitas|first3=Beatriz C.|last4=Hrvoj-Mihic|first4=Branka|last5=Herai|first5=Roberto H.|last6=Yu|first6=Diana X.|last7=Brown|first7=Timothy T.|last8=Marchetto|first8=Maria C.|last9=Bardy|first9=Cedric|date=2016-08-18|title=A human neurodevelopmental model for Williams syndrome|url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v536/n7616/full/nature19067.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=536|issue=7616|pages=338–343|doi=10.1038/nature19067|issn=0028-0836|pmc=4995142|bibcode=2016Natur.536..338C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellugi is the daughter of mathematician and optical engineer [[Maximilian Herzberger]]. Bellugi received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[Antioch College]] in 1952 and an [[Ed.D.]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1967.  Since then, she has held positions as a tenure-track professor at the [[Salk Institute]] (1970 forward) and as an [[adjunct professor]] at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (1977 forward) and [[San Diego State University]] (1995 forward). A lot of her researches were conducted in collaboration with her husband [[Edward Klima]], another linguist who also specialized in the study of American Sign Language.

'''Guanano''' ('''Wanano'''), or '''Piratapuyo''', is a [[Tucanoan languages|Tucanoan language]] spoken in the northwest part of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]] in [[Brazil]] and in [[Department of Vaupés|Vaupés]] in [[Colombia]]. It is spoken by two peoples, the {{Interlanguage link multi|Wanano|es|3=Guanano}} and the  {{Interlanguage link multi|Piratapuyo|es}}. They do not intermarry, but their speech is 75% lexically similar.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ethnologue.com/language/pir&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
The language family that Wanano belongs to is the Tucanoan family, located in northwest Amazonia (Stenzel 2004, 20). The Tukanoan family can be sub-categorized into two groups: Western Tukanoan Languages and Eastern Tucanoan Languages, Wanano belonging to the Eastern Tucanoan family (Stenzel 2004, 20). The Eastern Tukanoan group is much larger than the Western Tukanoan family with 16 languages and around 28,000 speakers, while the Western Tucanoan family has 4 languages with around 3,000 speakers (Stenzel 2004, 20).

Wanano/Piratapuyo belongs to the Northern branch of the Eastern Tucanoan languages, along with [[Tucano language|Tucano]].

==The Wanano People ==

=== Geographic Distribution ===
The Wanano people live in northwestern Amazonia, on the Vaupés River. The diaspora of the Wanano people is spread between Brazil and Colombia, the total population is estimated at 1560 (Stenzel 2004, 23), however the population in Brazil is estimated at 447 (Moore 2008, 41). The number of speakers is quite high, it is still the first language of most of the population. It is seen as a healthy indigenous language. (Stenzel 2004, 38).

=== Early history ===
The Jesuits were the first ones to make their way into the area that is inhabited by the Wanano people today. In the late 1700s they established their base in São Gabriel da Cachoeira. Missionary expeditions along with resettlement continued throughout the 1900s. Boarding schools were set up in larger settlements like São Gabriel and students were sent to study there (Stenzel 2004, 28). People from these missionaries would go into villages and encourage the indigenous peoples to abandon their beliefs and practice Christianity, along with speak Portuguese.

The first documentation of Wanano people came from naturalist Alfred Wallace during his 1852 expedition along the Vaupés River. (Stenzel 2004, 29). Later in 1904, a German ethnologist Theodor Kock-Grünberg conducted research in the Wanano region. He observed their interactions with other indigenous groups, including ceremonies that included dance and burial practices. (Stenzel 2004, 29). Something that has been noted by Stenzel in her research that is an important detail to include is the Wanano people are very multilingual (Stenzel 2004, 31).

=== Wanano Language Documentation Projects ===
The first known work on the Wanano language was a grammatical outline recorded by a Salesian missionary named Antônio Giacone in 1967 (Stenzel 2004, 14). Since then a lot of work has been conducted by Nathan and Carolyn Waltz who have worked with the SIL organization in Colombia from 1963 to 1996 (Stenzel 2004, 14). They have published a pedagogical grammar (Waltz 1976), papers on the aspects of Wanano phonology (Waltz and Waltz 1967, Waltz 1982, Waltz 2002), a volume containing a study of Wanano kinship terms, a grammatical sketch of the language and a long interlinearized text (Waltz and Waltz 1997) and the grammatical overview of Wanano found in the Caro y Cuervo collection (Waltz and Waltz 2000) (Stenzel 2004, 15). In 2007, Nathan Waltz published a Wanano – Spanish dictionary (Waltz 2007).  More research has been done on the Wanano language by Dr. Kristine Stenzel who has been conducting research in the Upper Rio Negro area since 2000. She has published a book on the grammar of Kotiria (Wanano) that discusses the morphology and syntax of the language (Stenzel 2015). Along with this book she has written many articles about different aspects of the Wanano language and people (Stenzel 2005a, 2005b, 2006, 2007, 2008a, 2008b, 2008c, 2009a, 2009b, 2009c, 2010, 2012, 2014) (Stenzel 2015).

Wanano was described in a language documentation project funded by Programa de Documentação de Línguas e Culturas Indígenas (ProDocLin) at the Museu do Índio. The project was coordinated by Dr. Kristine Stenzel and was a teaching workshop of Kotiria pedagogical grammar (Saltarelli 2014).

Dr. Kristine Stenzel has also written articles regarding anthropological aspects of the Wanano people (2010, 2013) (Stenzel 2015) as well in her 2004 dissertation where she discusses cultural aspects such as marriage and multilingualism (Stenzel 2004). Anthropologist Janet Chernela has also studied the Wanano society and published a book called “The Wanano Indians of the Brazilian Amazon” which takes a deeper look into Wanano society (Chernela 1996).

===Suprasegmental Elements===
Syllables may be marked with either a high or low [[stress accent]].  [[Nasalization]] is suprasegmental and moves from left to right through a word.

==Morphology ==
Wanano is a nominative accusative language with an [[subject–object–verb|SOV]] sentence structure that contains the following grammatical categories: nouns, verbs, particles, pronouns, and interrogatives. These are outlined in Stenzel’s Reference Grammar of Wanano (2004). Under nouns Stenzel goes into further detail regarding the animates: human vs non-human animates and inanimates: mass nouns vs count nouns (xi).  Stenzel discusses the pronouns which will be examined further below. For verbs Wanano have suffix morphemes that indicate evidentiality, as well as imperative, interrogative and irregular morphemes. While there are adverbial morphemes in Wanano, there are no adjectives.

=== Pronouns ===

Pronouns in Wanano are categorized by personal, possessive, interrogative and demonstrative. A like English, gender is seen in 3rd person pronouns only. The pronouns are categorized into deictic for 1st and 2nd person and anaphoric for 3rd person.

===== Other Morphological Aspects of Wanano =====

Gender coding of nouns is a morphological aspect discussed in the grammar of Wanano. Nouns with human referents are obligatorily marked for gender, most noun roots with human referents are masculine, otherwise feminine if marked by morpho-phonological means (Stenzel, 2004, 128). The gender coding suffix -ko that appears at the end of the noun is feminine while   -kʉ is masculine, for example phʉ-ko-ro (mother) and phʉ-kʉ-ro (father) (Stenzel, 2004, 130). Sometimes these endings can be reduced to o for feminine and ʉ for masculine. Examples of this are ~ducho-ro (grandmother) and ~duchʉ-ro (grandfather) (Stenzel, 2004, 129).

A mass noun is a noun that has no plural form, not meaning singular but that it is an uncountable referent. For example, you cannot count water however you can weigh it to measure its mass. By adding the morpheme –ro to the root of a mass noun or verb in Wanano, it changes into a count noun (Stenzel, 2004, 139). Some examples of this are ko (water) is turned into to ko-ro (rainstorm) with the addition of –ro. Tha (grass) is turned into tha-ro (field). (Stenzel, 2004, 139).

==Syntax==
Wanano is a nominative-accusative case system, this means that the subject of the transitive and intransitive verbs are marked the same way.

=== Intransitive ===
Intransitive verbs are verbs that require a single nominal argument. Below are some examples.

1)

As we can see from the examples above, Wanano is a nominative accusative language. For example, in example 1, 1SG yʉˈʉ is the same as in example 8. In example 9, the 3SG to is the same as in example 3. As well as in example 6  ANPH-SG ti is the same as in example 5.

=== Transitive motion verbs ===
Transitive motion verbs frequently occur with adjunct expressions coded only by the locative -pʉ and there are certain motion verbs in Wanano which can be syntactically transitive. In other words, they take a second, oblique argument coded by '''-'''pʉ-re. (Stenzel, 2004, 234)

Examples.

1)     ̴ayo   ̴o-pʉ-re yʉˈʉ khoˈa-wiˈi-kʉ-ka

Wanano is typologically nominative-accusative, and that it codes the grammatical rather than the semantic roles of core arguments. (Stenzel, 2004, 255)

== Semantics ==

=== Plural morphemes in Wanano ===
The most common plural morpheme used in Wanano is -a/ ̴da. The alternation between the two is still unclear however there is a tendency for   ̴da to be used for animates with human referents, for example pho’da (children), while –a is used for other animates (Stenzel, 2004, 131). When pluralizing male or females the morphemes - ̴sʉba (male) and   ̴sa   ̴dubia (female) are used. Some examples of this are: dubi-a                             ̴bʉ-a

female-PL                          male-PL

females or women           males or men yucho   ̴sa   ̴dubi-a                                   ̴yuchʉ- ̴sʉba

(Stenzel, 2004, 132)

For pluralizing animals, since they are non-human the morpheme –a is used. There are some exceptions where –ya is used. Some examples of this are: phido-ro               ̴phido-a

snake                      snake-PL

bora-ro                 boraro-a

die-ro                    die-ya

dog                         dogs

(Stenzel, 2004, 134).

If you take the word for dogs, for example, die-ya, and you want to say female dogs, you add the word for women (  ̴dubia).

Dieya- ̴dubia

Female dogs.

[[File:Sill (PSF).png|thumb|1) Sill; 2) lintel.]]
A '''window sill''' (also written as '''windowsill''' or '''window-sill''') is the surface at the bottom of a [[window]].

A dictionary of architecture categorically defined the characteristics of a '''windowsill''' as:
# The lowest form of window casement. Windowsills hold pieces in place and slope downward to drain water. In a well-hung window, the lower sash rests on the chin;
# The horizontal piece below a window unit in masonry construction or in wood framing. The window sill of the window frame sits on the window sill of the wall opening;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sturgis |first=Russell |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Building: Biographical, Historical, and Descriptive |volume=vol. 3 |location=New York |publisher=The Macmillan Co. |year=1901 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The lowermost, interior trim work on a [[window]];
# Meets the dictionary definition of a shelf "A flat, usually rectangular structure composed of a rigid material, such as wood, glass, or metal, fixed at right angles to a wall or other vertical surface and used to hold or store objects."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/shelf Shelf]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15262">In [[linguistics]], a '''yes–no question''', formally known as a '''polar question''' or a '''general question''',&lt;ref&gt;William Chisholm, Louis T. Milic, John A.C. Greppin. Interrogativity. – John Benjamins Publishing, 1982. &lt;/ref&gt; is a [[question]] whose expected answer is either [[yes and no|"yes" or "no"]].  Formally, they present an [[exclusive disjunction]], a pair of alternatives of which only one is acceptable. In English, such questions can be formed in both positive and negative forms (e.g. "Will you be here tomorrow?" and "Won't you be here tomorrow?").&lt;ref name=Grimes&gt;{{cite book|title=The Thread of Discourse|author=Joseph Evans Grimes|pages=66–67|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1975|isbn=978-90-279-3164-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yes–no questions are in contrast with non-polar [[wh-question]]s, with the [[five Ws]], which do not necessarily present a range of alternative answers, or necessarily restrict that range to two alternatives.  (Questions beginning with "which", for example, often presuppose a set of several alternatives, from which one is to be drawn.)&lt;ref name=Grimes /&gt;

== How such questions are posed ==
{{main|Interrogative}}
Yes–no questions are formed in various ways in various languages. In [[English language|English]], a special word order ([[verb–subject–object]]) is used to form yes–no questions. In the [[Greenlandic language]], yes–no questions are formed with a special verb morphology. In [[Latin]], yes–no questions are indicated by the addition of a special [[grammatical particle]] or an [[enclitic]]. In some languages, such as in [[Modern Greek]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and the [[Jakaltek language]], the ''only'' way to distinguish a yes–no question from a simple [[Sentence (linguistics)|declarative statement]] is the rising [[question intonation]] used when saying the question. (Such questions are labelled [[Sentence (linguistics)|declarative questions]] and are also available as an option in those languages that have other ways of asking yes–no questions.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Intonation|author=Alan Cruttenden|pages=155–156|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-521-59825-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Latin]], the enclitic particle ''[[wikt:-ne#Latin|-ne]]'' (sometimes just "-n" in [[Old Latin]]) can be added to the emphatic word to turn a declarative statement into a yes–no question. It usually forms a neutral yes–no question, implying neither answer (except where the context makes it clear what the answer must be).&lt;ref name=HaleBuck&gt;{{cite book|title=A Latin Grammar|author1=William G. Hale  |author2=Carl D. Buck |lastauthoramp=yes |pages=136|year=1903|publisher=University of Alabama Press|isbn=0-8173-0350-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example:&lt;ref name=Progovac&gt;{{cite book|title=Negative and Positive Polarity|author=Ljiljana Progovac|pages=151–152|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0-521-44480-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Tu id veritus es.''
*: "You feared that."
* ''Tu-nē id veritus es?''
*: "Did you fear that?"

In [[Esperanto]], the word ''ĉu'' added to the beginning of a statement makes it a polar question.
* ''Vi estas blua.''
*: "You are blue."
* ''Ĉu vi estas blua?''
*: "Are you blue?"

Yes–no questions are also formed in Latin with ''[[wikt:nonne#Latin|nonne]]'' to imply that the interrogator thinks the answer to be the affirmative and with ''[[wikt:num#Latin|num]]'' to imply that the interrogator thinks the answer to be the negative.&lt;ref name=HaleBuck /&gt;  For examples:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
''num negāre audēs?''
&lt;/poem&gt;("You dare not deny, do you?")|sign=[[Catullus]]|source=1,4,8&lt;ref name=HaleBuck /&gt;}}
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
''Mithridātēs nōnne ad Cn. Pompeium lēgātum mīsit?''
&lt;/poem&gt;("Didn't Mithridates send an ambassador to Gneaus Pompey?")|sign=[[Pompey]]|source=16,46&lt;ref name=HaleBuck /&gt;}}

In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], yes–no questions typically take an [[A-not-A]] form.&lt;ref name=Progovac /&gt; The resulting response is usually an [[echo response]].

In many Germanic languages, yes-no questions are formed using subject inversion.
In Dutch:
* ''Ik ben een jongen''
*: "I am a boy"
* ''Ben ik een jongen?''
*: "Am I a boy?"

==Ambiguities==
There is an ambiguity in English as to whether certain questions actually ''are'' yes–no questions in the first place. Syntactically identical questions can be semantically different. It can be seen by considering the following ambiguous example:&lt;ref name="Gutiérrez-Rexach"&gt;{{cite book|title=Semantics|author=Javier Gutiérrez-Rexach|pages=410–411|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-26637-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Did John play chess or checkers?
The question could be a yes–no question or could be a '''choice question''' (also called '''alternative question'''). It could be asking the yes–no question of ''whether'' John played ''either'' of the games, to which the answer is yes or no; or it could be asking the choice question (which does not have a yes–no response) of ''which'' of the two games John played (with the presupposition that he played one or the other), to which the answer is the name of the game. Another such ambiguous question is "Would you like an apple or an orange?" to which the responses can be "An apple", "An orange", "Yes", and "No", depending from whether the question is seen as a choice question or a yes–no question. (The "yes." answer involves a further ambiguity, discussed below.)&lt;ref name="Gutiérrez-Rexach" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Elementary Russian Syntax|author=Michael K. Launer|location=Columbus, OH|publisher=Slavica publishers|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related ambiguity is questions with the form of yes–no questions but intended not to be. They are a class of questions that encompass ''indirect speech acts''. The question "Can you reach the mustard?" is an example. In form and semantics, it is a straightforward yes–no question, which can be answered either "Yes, I can" or "No, I cannot". There is, however, an indirect speech act (which Clark calls an ''elective construal'') that can optionally be inferred from the question, namely "please pass the mustard". Such indirect speech acts flout [[Gricean maxims|Grice's maxim of manner]]. The inference on the part of the listener is optional, one that can legitimately remain untaken.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite book|title=Using Language|author=Herbert H. Clark|pages=216–218, 300|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-521-56745-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clark describes one study where a researcher telephoned fifty restaurants around [[Palo Alto, California]], asking without embellishment the question "Do you accept credit cards?" The three forms of reply given were:&lt;ref name=Clark /&gt;
* "Yes, we do." – The respondent assumed a straightforward yes–no question, taking the form of the question at face value.
* "Yes, we accept Mastercard and Visa." – The respondent assumed a straightforward yes–no question but provided additional information, either as explanation ("The answer is 'yes' because we accept these two.") or as anticipation or inference of a further request as to what credit cards are accepted.
* "We accept Mastercard and Visa." – The respondent not only took the question to be the indirect speech act but also assumed that the question was ''not'' a yes–no question, despite its form and so did not provide a yes–no answer at all.

Another part of the same study was the question "Do you have a price on a fifth of Jim Beam?" Out of 100 merchants, 40 answered "Yes".&lt;ref name=Clark /&gt;  A [[non-response bias]] forced researchers to disregard the survey question asking [[tobacconist]]s "Do you have Prince Albert?" as although the researchers' intent was to observe whether the merchants specified that they offered the tobacco brand as packaged in a can and/or a pouch, the merchants frequently hung up the phone, presumably because they believed themselves to be the victims of a popular [[prank call]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1994/vp941023/10210265.htm Penny Candy and Radio in the Good Old Days], By Tony Stein, ''The Virginian-Pilot'', October 23, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

== Answers ==
According to Grimes, the answer "yes" asserts a positive answer and the answer "no" asserts a negative answer, irrespective of the form of the question.&lt;ref name=Grimes&gt;{{cite book|title=The Thread of Discourse|author=Joseph Evans Grimes|pages=66–67|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1975|isbn=978-90-279-3164-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, simple "yes" or "no" [[word sentence]] answers to yes–no questions can be ambiguous in English. For example, a "yes" response to the question "You don't beat your wife?" could mean either "yes, I don't beat my wife" or "yes, I do beat my wife" depending from whether the respondent is replying with the [[truth-value]] of the situation or to the polarity used in the question. The ambiguity does not exist in languages that employ [[echo answer]]s. In the [[Welsh language]], for example, the response "ydw" ("I am") has no such ambiguity when it is used to reply to a question.&lt;ref name=Nodine&gt;{{cite web|title=How to say "Yes" and "No"|work=A Welsh Course|author=Mark H Nodine|date=2003-06-14|url=http://cs.cf.ac.uk./fun/welsh/Lesson02.html|publisher=Cardiff School of Computer Science, [[Cardiff University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other languages also do not follow the custom, given by Grimes, with respect to the answers "yes" and "no". In [[New Guinea Pidgin]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Huichol language|Huichol]], the answer given has the logical polarity implied by the form of the question. "Bai Renjinal i ranewe, o nogat?", a positive form of a question translated as "Will Reginald escape?", is answered "yes" (agreement, he will escape) or "[[wikt:nogat|nogat]]" (disagreement, he will not escape).  Phrased negatively, however, as "Bai Rejinal i no ranewe, o nogat?" ("Won't Reginald escape?") the senses of the answers take the opposite polarity to English, following instead the polarity of the question. An answer of "yes" is agreement that he ''will not'' escape, and a response of "nogayt" is disagreement, a statement that he ''will'' escape.&lt;ref name=Grimes /&gt;

A further ambiguity with yes–no questions, in addition to that of polarity, is the ambiguity of whether an ''exclusive'' or ''inclusive'' disjunction is meant by the word "[[wikt:or#English|or]]", as it can represent either. Conventionally, in English yes–no questions the "or" represents an exclusive disjunction. However, as with the "Would you like an apple or an orange?" question mentioned earlier, to which one possible answer, as a yes–no question, is "yes.", yes–no questions can also be taken to be ''inclusive'' disjunctions. The informativeness of the "or" in the question is low, especially if the second alternative in the question is "something" or "things". The "exclusive" and "inclusive" can be determined often in spoken language (the speaker will often lower their pitch at the end of an "exclusive" question, as opposed to raising it at the end of an "inclusive" question), but it is a frequent source of humour for [[computer scientist]]s and others familiar with [[Boolean logic]], who will give responses such as "yes" to questions such as "Would you like chicken or roast beef for dinner?". However, the ambiguity is not confined to humour. The apple-or-orange question may be legitimately asking whether either is wanted, for example, and "Would you like an apple or something?" is indeed ''expecting'' either "yes" or "no" as a proper answer rather than the answer "Something" that an exclusive disjunction would be requesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Co-compounds and Natural Coordination|author=Bernhard Wälchli|pages=82|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-927621-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="computers"&gt;{{cite book|title=Problem Solving with Computers|author=Greg W. Scragg|pages=310|publisher=Jones &amp;amp; Bartlett Publishers|year=1996|isbn=978-0-86720-495-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Discourse Markers|author=Deborah Schiffrin|pages=180–181|chapter=Discourse connectives: ''and'', ''but'', ''or''|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0-521-35718-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This ambiguity does not exist only in English.  It exists in West Greenlandic [[Greenlandic language|Kalaallisut]], for example. The question "Maniitsu-mi Nuum-mi=luunniit najugaqar-pa" ("Does he live in Maniitsoq or Nuuk?") is ambiguous as to whether exclusive or inclusive disjunction is meant. Commonly, this is clarified either by intonation (if the question is spoken) or the inclusion of an explicit question-word such as "sumi" ("where").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=West Greenlandic|author=Michael D. Fortescue|pages=9–10|year=1984|publisher=Croom Helm Ltd|isbn=0-7099-1069-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suggestibility ==
Yes–no questions are believed to carry some suggestibility load. For instance, in response to yes-no questions, children tend to display a compliance tendency: they comply with the structure of the question, negative or positive, by responding in the same way.

For example, if preschoolers are asked, "Is this book big?", they will tend to respond "Yes, it is". But if they are asked, "Is this book not big?" they are more likely to say, "No, it is not".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mehrani|first=Mehdi|journal=First Language|year=2011|volume=31|issue=4|doi=10.1177/0142723710391886|url=http://fla.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/01/04/0142723710391886.full.pdf|title=What is biased?
